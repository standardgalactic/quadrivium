EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD 
FROM
THE 
EDITORIAL 
TEAM
Editor’s Review pg.62
H
ello from the team, and Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri! 
In between stuffing our bellies with good food, the 
team has been battling a busy month. Some of our sharp-
eyed readers might have picked up on some differences in 
the magazine this issue. 
This month, we’ve decided to spice it up with some 
additional features. Through a collaborative effort, we present to 
you a refreshed look. With the team being so involved in multiple 
aspects of the magazine, we’ve reflected this on our glory panel as 
well. (You know, the page with all our names?)
Besides keeping the magazine fresh, the team was also 
invited to Computex in Taiwan. With a slew of new products and 
technologies being introduced, we’ve met with some big names, 
bringing you the hottest and latest trends right from the show floor. 
Flip to page 38 to see which swanky new products will be coming 
to Malaysia. 
Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) also took centre stage 
this month on the gaming arena. The biggest gaming tradeshow 
of the year; we religiously followed every announcement to tell 
you about the newest updates on gaming hardware, as well as 
upcoming game releases. 
Budding computer DIY enthusiast? Then you wouldn’t 
want to miss the Gizmos section. While you decide on which CPU 
or GPU should feature in your dream machine, we thought we’d 
help you look up some worthy accessories to match. 
As usual, our lab rats had the chance to geek out with 
more new gadgets. Amongst those that have arrived in our labs 
this month include the ASUS Strix ROG GL553 gaming laptop, the 
Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, the Huawei P10 Lite and the new Intel 
Optane Memory chip. The lab testing team will be waiting for you 
at page 60. 
Just before we sign off, what do you think about the new 
‘gods’ that rule Silicon Valley? Founders of tech giants Facebook et 
al like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are changing the landscape 
of the 21st century. Would you consider them to be modern day 
deities? Or perhaps they are merely names creating buzz? Our 
special feature this month looks at the ‘demi-gods’ of Silicon Valley. 
Hail to page 52. 
That’s all from us. We hope you like the new features! 
From all of us, maaf zahir dan batin! 
Errata: In our June issue, we have mistakenly written that the Illegear Q5 EVO 
had 6GB of RAM for memory. The system is shipped with 8GB of RAM out of 
the box. Also the model that we received met the minimum requirements for 
VR gaming, but it is not officially supported by Illegear. 
We apologize for the confusion.

Yes! Absolutely. There are services we call VPN (Virtual Private Network), which allows you to fool your network 
in thinking you are accessing a webpage from a different country. It’s used for a lot of people for testing, or privacy 
purposes. There are both free and paid services available like TunnelBear and Hola, which are free.
That ultimately depends on what is the type and size capacity you’re looking for. While SDHC cards range 
between 2GB to 32GB, SDXC can go from 32GB onwards. It also depends on the transfer speed as each MicroSD 
card comes with minimum transfer speeds. For example, Class 10 cards have a minimum speed of 10MB/s like 
UHS 1 while UHS 3 is 30MB/s. Ultimately, it’s how much storage you need and how fast you would want the 
transfer speed to be. 


Moto Keeps it Premium
Sporty looks paired with a decent price
ollowing suit with many other 
brands, Moto releases its 
latest smartphone after its 
introduction during MWC 2017. 
The Moto G5 Plus is the fifth-generation 
to come out from Moto.
The G5 Plus promises a premium 
look and feel with its metallic design, 
the first of the Moto G series to sport 
it. Taking inspiration from the Moto Z 
series, the G5 Plus also comes with 
a top-grade aluminium finish with 
diamond cutting and bead-blasted 
to perfection, making it easy on your 
eyes and your fingers. There is also a 
5.2-inch Full HD display screen with 
Corning Gorilla Glass 3, protecting it 
from any potential damage. However, 
one of the main talking points of the 
Moto G5 Plus is the camera.
Aside from having 12-megapixels, 
it also comes with Dual Autofocus 
Pixels, which gives you the ability 
to focus on your subject in mere 
milliseconds. A neat design feature is 
the circular Saturn ring design, allowing 
you to capture images even when in 
horrible outdoor lighting conditions.
Within the core of the Moto 
G5 Plus lies the Snapdragon 625 
processor, an Adreno 506 GPU and 
a 3,000mAh irremovable battery. It 
also features the latest Android OS 
software, the Nougat 7.0.
The G5 Plus also comes with a 
host of intuitive features that makes it 
stand out from the hoi polloi. Dubbed 
as Moto Actions, simple movements 
with the device held in one hand can 
perform various tasks like turning 
on the flashlight or even switching 
between camera modes. As with 
most smartphones these days, the G5 
Plus also comes with quick-charging 
technology, known as TurboPower.
The Moto G5 Plus is only available 
exclusively 
on 
Lazada 
Malaysia, 
retailing at RM1,299.

is now in Malaysia, along 
with the new Nokia range 
of Android smartphones; The Nokia 3, 
5 and 6, in addition to the new Nokia 
3310 feature phone.

or 
many 
years 
now, 
recycling 
has 
become 
a 
constant issue around the 
world. With empty plots of 
land being used as garbage dump 
sites depleting, people are looking 
at the sea as a possible alternative. 
That is not the way, especially for 
overall major brands like OKI. Having 
achieved a 74% ratio in recyclable 
products in 2016, OKI is focusing 
on lengthening the lifespan of its 
components. This will reduce parts 
that go to waste, and even simplified 
its 
components 
for 
disassembly 
while ensuring its reusability.
On this front, OKI has developed 
a form of material labelling, which 
is in line with the ISO 11469, a 
generic marking and identification 
of plastic products.
Conserving resources through its 
hard ware and software development 
is another aspect OKI focuses on. 
It aims to make its products more 
compact, while improving printer 
drivers for consumables.
Compact is key here, as it is also 
applied to OKI’s exclusive digital 
LED technology, which limits the 
amount of plastic used.
When it comes to keeping the 
environment safe, OKI ensures 
its printers were made to reduce 
paper usage through its duplex 
F
printer function. Its toner-saving 
function also lessens consumption, 
while the design of its printers 
focuses on separating the toner 
from 
the 
drum. 
With 
different 
replacement 
schedules 
to 
guarantee a full lifespan of each 
drum, this further stamps OKI’s mark 
against unnecessary wastage.
Global 
warming 
is 
another 
problem OKI is tackling; it has 
started 
to 
develop 
products 
that follows the guidelines of 
the International ENERGY STAR 
Programme. OKI’s LED technology 
produces 
sufficient 
lighting 
on minimal power to conserve 
on 
energy, 
while 
supporting 
environmental protection. Deep 
sleep and eco mode are some 
of features in OKI’s printers that 
keeps energy consumption low.
Another way OKI takes on high-
energy consumption is through its 
micro-capsule toners, which limits 
energy output considerably when 
printing. With OKI keeping the 
designs of its products simple, it 
simplifies the recycling process. It 
also reduces the number of steps 
and time taken to disassemble.
Since 2000, OKI has used 100% 
recyclable packaging, developing 
standards 
for 
packaging 
materials on par with product 
advertorial
development standards. It has 
also extended the lifespan of its 
products and consumables to 
help save and conserve both its 
own and global resources.
Never one to shy away from 
the responsibility of recycling and 
environmental safety, OKI keeps 
its 
environmental 
protection 
initiatives 
and 
achievements 
public. 
It 
also 
actively 
exchanges 
information 
with 
other 
environmental 
protection 
agencies to work and develop on 
even more reliable technologies 
and products for the future.
OKI also sees noise pollution 
as a potential problem so it not 
only keeps the design of its 
printers 
compact 
but 
to 
also 
meet governmental standards for 
electromagnetic noise and safety. 
With noise levels kept to a minimum 
when in operation, this reflects 
the high value OKI places on its 
printers in an office environment.

Cyberjaya celebrates 20 years with new announcements for accelerating 
transformation into Global Tech Hub
Kaspersky Labs promises to protect you and your company
A
rising 
threat 
against 
Internet 
security 
is 
ransomware, a special kind 
of cyber-attack that comes 
with a ransom to be paid once hackers 
have gained access to your computer 
system or network. 
One of the recent ransomware 
attacks that has spread globally 
is WannaCry, crippling more than 
200,000 
organisations 
in 
150 
countries, including Malaysia. 
WannaCry targets local networks 
and systems that have not yet updated 
to the latest security upgrades.
Kaspersky Lab held a free 
educational 
workshop 
on 
how 
companies can combat against the 
threat of WannaCry with the fear and 
uncertainty surrounding it. Kaspersky 
Lab also provides information on 
whether your network is infected, 
is safe and how to safeguard your  
data in the future while retrieving 
ransomed data.
To 
keep 
users 
updated, 
Kaspersky Lab came up with its 
latest release – Kaspersky Office 
Security software, which provides 
ramped-up Ransomware protection. 
Targeted towards small businesses, 
this software allows small business 
owners to stay on top of the ever-
growing number of cyberthreats, 
including WannaCry. 
There 
is 
also 
the 
latest 
edition of Kaspersky Small Office 
Security that provides enhanced  
protection against another growing 
threat – ‘cryptors’. 
The System Watcher comes with 
anti-ransomware capabilities and will 
block malicious encryption attempts 
while simultaneously triggering an 
automatic backup and restore.

It's Here!
Voted ‘Best New Smartphone’ at MWC 2017
fter teasing us for months, 
Sony 
Mobile 
has 
finally 
brought its latest flagship, 
the Xperia XZ Premium, to 
our shores. Tagging along is the mid-
range Xperia XA1 Ultra, an upgrade to 
its predecessor, the XA1. While the XZ 
Premium is dropping for a hefty RM3,399, 
the XA1 Ultra is retailing at RM1,899.
What makes the XZ Premium a 
worthwhile product is what lies in its core 
– the Snapdragon 835 processor. It is the 
first smartphone in Malaysia to carry this 
latest processor from Qualcomm.
Located at the back of the 
device is its 19-megapixel Motion 
Eye camera that comes together with 
Triple Image Sensing technology as 
well as Predictive Hybrid Autofocus. 
It is capable of capturing super slow-
motion videos at 960 fps.
Another noteworthy feature would 
be its 5.5-inch 4K HDR display with 
A
"The first 
smartphone 
in Malaysia 
to carry the 
latest from 
Qualcomm."
TRILUMINOS and X-Reality technology, 
something you would only see on Sony 
BRAVIA TVs. Pair that with 4GB of RAM 
and 64GB UFS internal storage space, 
the XZ Premium is here to challenge 
other flagships from the top brands. 
Meanwhile, the XA1 Ultra is 
powered by a MediaTek Helio P20 
processor, 4GB of RAM and comes 
with 64GB eMMC internal storage. 
Its 6-inch Full HD display screen is 
partnered up with Image Enhance 
technology for better viewing while its 
23-megapixel camera comes with the 
Exmore RS mobile image sensor with 
Hybrid Autofocus for better picture-
taking capabilities.
Both devices can fit two nanoSIMs 
and will have Android Nougat OS, as 
well as the Qnovo Adaptive Charging 
capabilities for faster charging. The 
advantage of the XZ Premium is its 
IP65/68 rating and scratch protection 
by the  Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on both 
its front and back.
The XZ Premium comes in three 
colours: Luminous Chrome, Deepsea 
Black and Bronze Pink, while the XA1 
Ultra comes in four different colours 
namely Gold, White, Pink and Black.

o say data is an integral part of a business 
would be an understatement. With millions 
of pieces of information being transferred 
across various systems, businesses can 
generate terabytes of data daily; that data needs 
to live somewhere. 
There are many options on the market, with 
cloud storage service providers making the choice 
selection even harder. However, the convenience 
of public cloud has come at the price of concern in 
security and privacy. 
There are also companies who opt to keep data 
in-house, but with current workforce increasingly 
working outside of the office network infrastructure 
– the need to have these employees access critical 
data is essential. 
Network Attached Storage (NAS) is the preferred 
option for many smaller businesses. It provides 
enough flexibility, allowing easy data access through a 
connected cloud service; it also allows administrators 
full control of the privacy settings of data. 
There are many enterprise-level NAS in the 
market – some with rudimentary storage capabilities, 
others with flashy apps. Businesses should instead 
consider reliability and solid functionality when 
choosing a NAS.
T
advertorial
The hearT of 
Businesses
Enterprise NAS doesn’t need to be flashy, just practical and reliable
Hard disk snapshot, backup and replication 
capabilities are vital for business-oriented NAS. 
This is especially true with the increasing number 
of ransomware targeting businesses of all sizes; 
backup is still the most effective guard. Managing a 
NAS should not be complicated either. It is essential 
for administrators to be able to manage the system’s 
performance, apps, security and privacy functions 
on a single platform. 
Netgear’s line-up of enterprise NAS comes with 
the essential features that most businesses need. 
Thanks to the small form factor, it does not take 
up valuable floor space. The ReadyNAS portfolio of 
solutions strikes the right balance between security 
and convenience. 
A NAS cannot work on its own – it relies heavily 
on good storage solutions. Resiliency is the key, as 
well as minimal performance degradation . After all, it 
means nothing if you cannot access or transfer the 
data quick enough. Losing precious time can make 
or break the organization.
While there are flash-based solutions in the 
market, the cost is still relatively high compared 
to conventional hard disk drives (HDD). HDD is 
still the most commonly used form of storage. In 
a business setting, HDDs are practical – it is both 
resilient and cost effective. 
Toshiba HDDs proves its worth with solid 
performance 
numbers. 
The 
range 
comes 
in 
iterations up to 8TB and transfer speeds up to 
230MB/s. It strikes the

Demands For Flexibility
Microsoft Teams to boost productivity in the Malaysian workplace 
icrosoft’s study found that 
Malaysian employees do 
not feel that their workplace 
allows them to keep up with the 
demands of the digital workplace.
The study showed that 70% 
of 
Malaysia 
respondents 
consider 
themselves to be mobile workers and 
spend at least 20% of their time working 
outside of their offices. However, only 
41% feel  that their organisation’s culture 
and managers empowers them to work 
together productively and collaboratively. 
The Microsoft Asia Workplace 
2020 
Study, 
conducted 
between 
February and March 2017, involved 
nearly 4,200 working professionals from 
14 markets in Asia Pacific. This includes 
319 respondents from Malaysia, with 
the aim to understand shifting employee 
behaviours and gaps in the workplace in 
terms of productivity, collaboration and 
flexi-work practices. 
Microsoft introduced Teams in 
November 2016. An integrated solution 
within the Office 365 suite, it is a chat 
platform that allows for easy integration 
with other apps, including the entire 
suite of O365, Skype, other 3rd party 
apps and social media platforms. 
Teams is made to increase 
productivity in the workplace; reducing 
time for meetings or emails with real 
time document editing, brainstorming, 
and other team work capabilities right 
on a single platform.
The Teams app can be accessed 
on Android, iOS, Windows  desktop and

Squeeze Me
HTC U11 bring new meaning to hands-on
fter the announcement of 
the HTC U11 in a recent 
global launch in Taipei, 
Malaysia is one of the first 
countries to witness the availability of 
this new flagship smartphone. It is the 
first smartphone with revolutionary new 
squeeze interaction. 
Users just need to squeeze the 
sides of the phone to launch or run any 
app or action they have assigned to the 
smartphone.
“Having been present in the 
industry for the past two decades and 
in conjunction with our 20th anniversary 
this year, we have remained true to 
our roots to be an innovator in the 
smartphone industry that is able to meet 
the demands of customers today and 
tomorrow. HTC has constantly evolved 
throughout the years by marking many 
firsts in the industry which have now been 
widely adopted by other smartphone 
makers," says Faisal Siddiqui, President, 
HTC South Asia.
"Today, we have continued that 
vision to allow our consumers to get 
the most out of their smartphones 
by introducing revolutionary features 
such as the all-new HTC Edge Sense 
to 
give 
consumers 
the 
ultimate  
user-experience."
The new HTC Sense Edge gives a 
whole new meaning of "getting a grip". 
Thanks to eight sensors situated along 
the body, users just need to squeeze 
the sides to launch any action they have 
programmed into the smartphone. It is 
also intelligent enough to sense how 
intense the squeeze is, with different 
levels of intensity assigned to different 
actions, such as launching the selfie 
camera or calling up Google Assistant.
The HTC U11 will be priced at RM 
3,099 (inclusive of GST), in Amazing 
Silver, Sapphire Blue and Brilliant Black. 
A fourth colour, Solar Red, will be 
available in the near future.

habits. It does so with the ability 
to collect, analyse and translate 
data to score driving behaviours. 
This will provide insurers with the  
capability to price motor insurance 
premiums more accurately through  
the data processed.
Some companies that are already 
using iFleet’s services includes a home-
grown logistics provider known as SnT 
Global. With bigger logistics companies 
feeling the pressure of coping with 
the ever-growing rate of online sales 
and package deliveries, the market

Keeping it Zen
ASUS’ ZenBooks and VivoBooks are here
o keep in line with the trend 
of 2017, ASUS introduces 
a new lineup of ZenBooks 
and 
VivoBooks, 
promising 
uncompromised 
performance 
in 
a 
slender body. From the sheer elegance of 
the ZenBook 3 Deluxe and the ZenBook 
3 Pro to the flexible VivoBook S15 and 
VivoBook Pro 15, ASUS has gone all out 
in making its new lineup portable and 
lightweight for all.
The ASUS ZenBook has three 
iterations: The ZenBook 3 Deluxe, 
ZenBook 3 Pro and the ZenBook Flip S. 
The flagship ZenBook 3 Deluxe features 
a 14-inch laptop and weighs only 1.1kg. 
When closed, it is only 12.9mm thin, 
giving it the title of ‘world’s thinnest 
laptop’. What’s running under its hood is 
also a sight with the 7th gen. Intel Core 
i7 processor, 16GB of DDR3 RAM, 1TB 
of PCIe SSD, and two USB Type-C ports 
that are Thunderbolt-enabled.
The ZenBook 3 Pro also features 
similar specifications: the 7th gen. Intel-
Core i7 processor, a NVIDIA GeForce 
GTX 1050 GPU, 512GB PCIe SSD and 
16GB of RAM.  It also comes with a 
15.6-inch FHD NanoEdge display screen 
with Harman Kardon surround-sound 
audio. Lastly, The ZenBook Flip S is the 
T
only model in the series with flexibility. 
It comes with the 7th gen. Intel-Core i7 
processor in it alongside a 512GB PCIe 
SSD. However, the main selling point 
is its 360-degree display, allowing you 
to turn the ZenBook Flip S into four 
different modes.
While the VivoBook Pro 15 is all 
about performance, The VivoBook S15 is 
all about portability. The VivoBook Pro 15 
comes with a 15.6-inch Full HD display, the 
7th gen. Intel-Core i7 processor, GeForce 
GTX 1050 GPU and topped off with 4GB 
of RAM. Meanwhile, the VivoBook S15 
features a much slimmer and lighter form, 
sharing the same specs as the VivoBook 
Pro 15, apart from the GTX 1050 GPU. The 
VivoBook S15 will come with the GeForce 
GTX 940MX GPU instead.
As the ZenBook 3 Deluxe is 
already available at RM8,299, the 
ZenBook 3 Pro and the ZenBook Flip S 
will only be available at the beginning 
of August, alongside the VivoBook 
Pro 15. These laptops will retail at 
RM7,299, RM6,699 and RM4,799

Fingerprint Security: 
Three Myths Busted
Unlocking your phone with your finger? It may 
not be the best way to secure your data
ingerprints have long been viewed as the ultimate identifier, unique only to you and impossible 
to steal; which is why fingerprint readers have become integral to smartphone and mobile device 
security.
Following this train of thought, these gadgets must now be at their most secure. Well, not quite. We 
debunk three myths in this short feature to bring some clarity to the subject of fingerprint security.
Myth 1: Fingerprint security is more secure than passwords
Meanwhile, the FBI keeps a file of an estimated 
100 million prints, of which more than 30 million are 
'civil prints' - i.e. not linked to criminal activity.
These two cited examples are just one of the 
many roads to repositories of sensitive information, 
which will appeal to cybercriminals. If this information 
can be accessed, it is entirely possible for them to 
be stolen and used maliciously, just like stolen credit 
cards and pin numbers.
Contrary to what many people assume, biometric 
readers are not foolproof. They have their own set 
of unique vulnerabilities, the technology can be 
exploited and fingerprints can be stolen (even from 
photographs).
For example in America, it is the Department 
of Homeland Security's policy to collect fingerprints 
from non-US citizens between the ages of 14 and 79 
as they enter the country.

DNA Detections can identify specific known

$8 tRIllIoN ‘to bE lost to

Businesses are set lose US$8 trillion to 
cybercrime over the course of the next five 
years, according to a new report.
Juniper Research found that enterprises 
around the world are more at risk due to even 
greater levels of internet connectivity, as well 
as “inadequate enterprise wide security”.
The paper, titled The Future of Cybercrime 
and 
Security: 
Enterprise 
Threats 
and 
Mitigation 2017-2022, claims that some 2.8 
billion personal data records are likely to be 
stolen in 2017, with that number doubling to 
five billion three years later.

security news at: www.welivesecurity.com
Myth 2: you can’t copy a fingerprint
In 2013, Apple ushered in the era of biometrics to the 
mainstream market by announcing the addition of a 
fingerprint scanner to its iPhone 5s. It promised to keep 
your phone super-protected while providing a Touch ID 
method of purchasing things from iTunes and the App 
Store – effectively removing the need for passwords (not 
totally, mind you).
But within two days of the iPhone 5s launch, German 
security researcher Starburg, used publicly-available 
software, called VeriFinger, to recreate the fingerprints 
of Germany’s Minister of Defence using high-resolution 
photos. They claim that the copy was good enough to trick 
fingerprint systems for biometric authentication.
More recently, in 2016, biometrics firm Vkansee 
demonstrated that the “technology can be spoofed”. All 
you need is clay and some Play-Doh and you can capture 
enough fingerprint details to dupe a sensor into thinking 
it’s the real deal. However, the firm did state that the 
process is rather convoluted and unlikely to result in 
breaches of this type. Nevertheless, it does suggest that 
fingerprints can be copied.
Myth 3: Fingerprints will replace passwords 
in the future
Given that fingerprints can be stolen, copied and used to 
bypass today’s readers, it’s clear we have a long way to 
go before passwords are made obsolete. Even then, the 
likelihood is that passwords are going to be around for a 
long time.
What this highlights is that there is no single solution 
to security. Many experts are advising the adoption 
of an approach that embraces multiple measures so 
that ultimately, there is more than one entry point into 
whatever you protect.
In practice, this means a mix of fingerprints, 
passwords and additional security in the shape of  
two-factor authentication may be required. This is especially 
important in instances where the information or asset  
– digital or physical – is of a particularly sensitive nature.
Cybercriminals will most likely put off in attacking 
thanks to the increased complexity required to access  
your data.

he concept of curated online 
shopping 
(also 
known 
as 
concierge shopping) is gaining 
traction in Malaysia. Several 
companies recently opened shop to 
cater to the needs of consumers who 
are time-constrained, but still need 
to go on a grocery run. Honestbee 
is one of the new players on the 
block. The SIngaporean outfit is 
looking to tap into the Malaysian 
market while fulfiling the consumer’s 
demand for an easier and more  
convenient shopping experience 
Marianne Chuo, Country Manager 
of honestbee Malaysia, shares that 
Malaysia has the potential to grow the 
online concierge and delivery service 
locally. In fact, the company projects 
that the market will grow up to US$ 
650 million by 2019. Currently, only 
6% of Malaysian shoppers are actively 
purchasing their groceries online. 
There is still an educational process 
required to tell the public that online 
grocery concierge services are reliable 
and convenient. 
“At honestbee, we focus on our 
superior on-demand delivery timing, 
where deliveries are made within a 
one-hour time slot. With a wide range 
of partners, our customers can easily 
navigate through honestbee with just 
a few clicks on our website,” says

as they target individuals, as well as  
corporates and institutions. 
“We work directly to establish 
solid partnerships with renowned 
outlets and specialty stores. Our 
partners include Ben’s Independent

honestbee 
is 
committed 
in 
delivering the best experience for 
the customer. While catering to the 
variety of different tastes out there. At 
the same time, it will be adding more 
partners to the list soon. 
With regards to the challenge 
faced by honestbee in the market, the 
company admits delivering  a  high-quality  
user-experience is at the top of 
their must-do list. For that, their 
professionally-trained team ensures 
the app is user-friendly, and is easily 
accessible by all. 
On the tech side of things, Chuo 
reveals that the honestbee platform 
is shared among the markets it is 
operating in. This means they share the 
same backend, with their tech team 
centralised at their HQ in Singapore. 
The company developed its system 
from the ground up and in-house, as 
they seek out the best talent globally 
and bring them into Singapore. This 
ensures that their tech will always be 
at its best, no matter when or where 
the rollout is. 
A feature that honestbee has 
that very few of their competitors offer 
is the ability to order from different 
stores at one-go. Chuo shares that this 
allows multiple orders to be collected 
into a single order, and will arrive at 
the customer’s door at the same time. 
honestbee is also the only player in the 
market that offers both groceries and 
food delivery service in one app. This 
advantage is big, and differentiates the 
company from the others. 
The shopping service on the app 
and the website are also uniformly 
similar, as the two portal stems from 
the same backend service. This allows 
honestbee to control the shopping 
experience down to the granular level, 
delivering the best experience possible. 
On the question of competitors, 
Chuo says that it is hard not to expect 
new players in the industry. “We hope 
to focus on improving our operations as 
well as growing our business to be the 
leading online concierge and delivery 
service in Asia,” she adds. 
Since 
its 
launch 
in 
2015, 
honestbee has spread its wings across 
Asia, with countries like Singapore, 
Hong Kong and Taipei being part  
of the list.
In Malaysia, the service was 
launched in early February and has 
since gained traction as one of the 
leading concierge shopping service in 
the Klang Valley.

 MSI transcends new heights  
at Computex 2017
Next Gaming 
Dimension 
ith a huge following in the 
global gaming community, 
MSI is back yet again with 
another exciting product 
launch at Computex 2017. The brand 
unveils a range of gaming laptops that 
are set to appeal to a variety of gamers. 
The three main highlights are 
the GT75VR Titan, GE63VR Raider and 
GE73VR Raider – a collection of laptops 
that promises to take you to the “Next 
Gaming Dimension”. 
All three gaming laptops feature 
the distinctive red trim and a flourishing 
brushed metal body. The GT75VR Titan 
stands out the most among the three 
with its aggressive ‘muscular’ chassis 
and futuristic red-trimmed ventilations. 
The GT75VR Titan also houses 
a revolutionary Rapid Mechanical 
Keyboard. As this notebook is smaller 
than the gargantuan GT83VR, the 
MSI’s R&D team spared no resources 
in making the implementation of the 
keyboard to the smallest body possible. 
The GT75VR Titan comes equipped 
with a powerful Core i7 7820HK CPU 
with over 4GHz overclock capability, 
in addition to its Cooler Boost Titan 
cooling module. It comes available in 
three GPU options: GeForce GTX 1080, 
GTX 1070 SLI, or GTX 1070.
Moving over to the GE series 
of laptops, this range has been a  
crowd-favourite since its inception. 
Made with gaming enthusiasts in mind, 
the GE63VR Raider and GE73VR Raider 
has been given a brand-new design and 
aesthetics, inspired by sports cars. Its 
muscular lines and protruding curves in 
the middle give it a much sportier vibe, 
as the red-emitting lines on each side 
provide a subtle novelty. 
Both GE Raider laptops will be 
available in two display sizes: 15-
inch and 17-inch. It comes with a 
GeForce GTX 1070 GPU that has an 
overclocking ability, paired with its 
latest Giant Speakers enhanced by 
Dynaudio. This marks as the first time 
ever for MSI to implement a full-size  
speaker chamber into a gaming laptop. 
Complementing 
this 
all-star 
launch are two newly upgraded GS 
series of gaming notebook, namely 
the GS63VR Stealth Pro and GS73VR 
Stealth Pro. 
Both laptops are equipped with 
the Cooler Boost Trinity and GeForce 
GTX 1070 GPU, famed for giving 
the best gaming performance while 
keeping things cool.
Taking gaming a step further 
is MSI’s massive selection of Intel 
X299 
compatible 
motherboards 
and powerful GeForce GTX 1080Ti 
GPUs neatly displayed at its booth  
in Computex 2017.

COVER 
STORY

Thin and light models are becoming an industry norm
Slim is In
By Sharil Abdul Rahman

COVER STORY
alk into any IT mall and you will see tons of 
laptops on display.  There you will see vendors 
urging you to buy their machines, whether 
through the power of persuasion or great deals. 
Just like the many models gracing catwalks across the 
globe, most new laptops are designed to be thin and light. 
The market is rapidly moving towards this slim form within 
the last 10 years, constantly shaving mere millimetres to be 
‘the thinnest in town’ according to every other brand; this 
sounds all too familiar. Users can thank  the industry’s desire 
for miniaturisation, while providing optimum design, power 
delivery and performance.
This begs the question: are consumers asking for it, or 
it is part and parcel of the notebook industry’s progression? 
On-the-road Computing 
Laptops were conceived from the need for portable 
computing devices in order to do work outside of the office. 
In their early days, they were big, clunky and could only 
last for a short amount of time away from the wall plug. 
Modern laptops, on the other hand, are thinner, lighter and 
can outperform the older models easily. 
To many, the thin laptop design ideology came into 
maturity during the mid-90s. Back then, the concept was just 
starting to emerge from design studios, thanks to innovative 
manufacturers who were willing to push the envelope of 
design and innovation. It is also helped by the fact that the 
processors from Intel and AMD are becoming more power 
efficient, so that they were sipping power from the battery 
instead of gulping it all down.
The slim and light market was originally a niche market. 
Manufacturers were focusing more on mass market models, 
which were more in tune with market needs at the time. This 
resulted in thick and heavy laptops that were fondly known 
as ‘tanks’ to some, or ‘bricks’ by others. Companies like 
Dell and HP were infamous with their heavy  – yet robust – 
laptops, which were carted around by professionals in their 
backpacks. 
Niche Market Needs
The market for slimmer designs can be attributed to 
consumers looking for thin and light machines that can give 
more than ‘just enough’ for daily computing use. They are 
looking for laptops that can last all day on a single battery 
charge, perform well in daily computing tasks and yet will 
not break their back carrying it around the city. 
One of the earliest models from the 1990s was the 
Sony VAIO PCG-505. Designed to be ‘SuperSlim’, the laptop 
featured a 10.4-inch SVGA screen, Pentium MMX processor 
and a four-panel magnesium body – all for a ‘paltry’ sum 
of US$2,000 (about RM5,109 in 1995). The machine does 
basic jobs – document processing, simple office productivity 
and web browsing using the built-in modem – but it is no 
powerhouse in mobile computing.

50
JULY 2017

From Niche To Mainstream
These days, however, the market has shifted to wanting 
portability without sacrificing processing power. Not only 
are laptops getting thinner by the day, they are becoming 
more powerful. Intel’s Core series chips in particular have 
revolutionised mobile computing, as they allow thin and 
light machines to have better processing power as compared  
to desktop machines. 
Take, for example, the Acer Swift 7. It is currently one 
of the thinnest laptops in the market, measuring at only 
9.98mm. That’s just about as thin as our PC.com magazine! 
The design does not mean it is a slouch in performance. By 
using the latest Intel Core i5 processor, it is as capable as 
any laptop in the market right now. 
Of course, the most popular thin and light machine is 
the Apple Macbook Air. When it was first released in 2008, 
consumers around the world clamoured to get a unit for 
themselves. It is still one of the more recognised models 
made by Apple, and is still being used by users all around 
the world to this day. The combination of design, keyboard 
usability, functionality and portability has made the Apple 
Macbook Air a crowd favourite, even to the extent of some 
manufacturers making blatant copies.
Even brands are agreeing with the notion that thin and 
light are becoming mainstream. Johnson Seet, Director of 
Products, Acer Sales & Services Sdn Bhd, says: “Technology 
has advanced tremendously that super slim form and 
functionality are no longer mutually-exclusive. Acer is 
showing the way with our ultra-slim, lightweight Swift 
series laptops. Packing innovative features and superior 
performance in an elegant design with great portability, the 
Swift series is leading the trend in style.”
High Performance Thin Machines
Next in the pipeline is the concept of high-end gaming 
laptops in a thin and (comparatively) lightweight design 
when compared to current generation gaming laptops. This 
is made possible by a new concept from NVIDIA called 
Max-Q, that combines high-end desktop-class processors, 
high-performance gaming GPUs and high-efficiency cooling 
into a compact chassis. 
At Computex 2017, ASUS introduced the Zephyrus, 
the company's take on the Max-Q design. It is only 17mm at 
its thickest point, and yet it has components that can rival 
even the beefiest gaming machine (desktop or laptop) on 
the market right now. The Intel Core i7 7700HQ processor 
is  paired with the NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU, allowing the 
Zephyrus to be a formidable performer. It is so thin, you may 
just forget that it is even in your backpack.
The Choice for Many
Before, the market for thin laptops was slim (no pun intended). 
Now, the tables have turned. More and more consumers are 
looking for a thin and light laptop to be their daily driver. 
In the next decade or so, we will be looking at more 
devices in the thin and light design category. While desktop 
replacements will still have a purpose, thin and light laptops 
will be the mainstay and the choice of many users.
At least until we have our foldable screen  
devices, that is.

Gods 2.0
ilicon Valley; a name synonymous to the home of tech 
giants. This prestigious address in the San Francisco 
Bay Area has lured many but rewarded very few in an 
ever-booming tech scene. 
It wasn’t always a premium location, though. When 
development first started in 1971, it was viewed as a sleepy 
hub for manufacturers of microprocessors and circuits, housing 
old timers such as IBM and Intel. The world has since changed; 
technology is inseparable from our daily lives, while the industry 
is enjoying a healthy dose of competition. 
In the latest ‘World’s Most Valuable Brand’ ranking, 
carmakers are slowly being ousted by the rise of a new breed of 
superstars from the tech industry. More than just the executive 
leader of a company, these CEOs are under constant scrutiny 
for their every move. Their visions and actions dictate the next 
big trend and with close to 50 tech companies on the Fortune 
500 List, it’s not difficult to see why the people spearheading 
changes will be the tech moguls.
If biographies are to be trusted, most of the top-
ranking tech companies today came from humble 
beginnings. Apple started out in a family garage 
while Facebook had its start in a Harvard dorm 
room. The rest, as they say, is history – both 
companies have since amassed an almost cult-
like following within the span of a decade.* 
Just as Silicon Valley needs no introduction, 
names like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and 
Elon Musk need no further clarification. With 
a social standing closer to Hollywood A-listers, 
these are the names accountable for billions of 
users worldwide. 
With a recent count of over two billion users, 
Zuckerberg has advanced a media sharing site to a 
multi-billion-dollar business. Ranked 10th on Forbes 
list of ‘The World’s Most Powerful People’, the 
Harvard dropout is also estimated to be the 
fifth richest person in the world. Since 
its 
conception, 
Facebook’s 
own portfolio has expanded 
beyond social media, delving 
into instant messaging with the 
acquisition of Whatsapp, virtual 
reality with Oculus and photo-
sharing platform, Instagram. 
S
In the age of tech worshipping, the darlings of Silicon Valley are modern deities
Kingpin of the largest e-payment system in the world, 
Musk was the head honcho behind Paypal before moving 
beyond the digital world. The brains behind Tesla, SpaceX 
and at least six other companies, Musk has set his sights 
beyond the stars – literally. From reimagining electric-powered  
vehicles to revolutionising space travels, Musk’s determination 
has put him in 21st on Forbes list of ‘The World’s  
Most Powerful People’.
In fact, 13 out of the 74 listed on Forbes’ ‘The World’s 
Most Powerful People’ list were CEOs or founders of tech 
company. With entries including Microsoft, Google, Amazon.
com, Samsung, Apple and Baidu to name a few, these people 
are recognised amongst world leaders, including presidents 
and prime ministers.
With so much perceived power, it’s hard to not defy the 
tech magnates. There is no question that technology is changing 
the future and the people dictating that change are possibly 
about as close to playing god as humanly possible. 
As glorified as it sounds, the process isn’t without 
the blood, sweat and tears. Find any books on the 
biographies of these Silicon Valley darlings 
and you’d find detailed accounts of their 
perseverance through plenty of failed 
projects. These success stories have also 
set an almost impossible benchmark for  
aspiring entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley promises much 
digital hopes, dreams and potential. 
However, with such vast imparity 
in the industry, it begs the question: 
Are these ‘gods’ so far ahead that 
they leave young hopefuls 
with delusions rather 
than dreams and an 
unattainable future?

to the possibility of having cutting-edge technologies in a small camera body. It means better quality 
photos, more versatility in shooting both still images and videos. Most importantly, the operability 
and portability that comes along with it.

Image Quality
EOS M6 comes in a Graphite Black body and a 
Vintage Silver body
EOS M6 is packed with a powerful system that delivers 
high quality and crisp images
The beautiful EOS M6 is packed with exceptional 
features such as the Dual Pixel CMOS AF, 
Combination IS, a powerful image stabilisation 
technology that reduces camera shake when 
shooting movies; AF tracking and high-speed 
continuous shooting of up to 7 fps for capturing 
fast-moving subject; 3 dials and a controller 
wheel that give you the flexibility to change 
settings effortlessly. All of these result in a 
better photography experience that all would 
truly enjoy. Let’s take a closer look at what the 
new camera has to offer.
The new EOS M6 comes with a powerful Dual Pixel 
CMOS AF system, translating to high speed, high 
precision autofocus that predicts movement 
away from or towards the photographer; a 
massive 24.2 megapixel APS-C sensor delivering 
high quality images that are crisp and with low 
noise coupled with an impressive ISO range from 
100 to 25600.
Making a Movie
Those inspiring holiday videos? You can easily 
make one too. With an in-camera digital image 
stabilisation system, create videos that are 
shake-free, even when you are walking along with 
it. Complement that with beautiful background 
blur, rich expression in low-light conditions, and 
fast autofocus, to achieve quality videos and 
time-lapse movies perfect for your Facebook and 
Instagram accounts. 
Record videos and shoot photos using the camera’s 
touch panel that can be tilted 180-degree upwards and 
45-degree downwards
A Variety of Lens Options
Like the rest of the models in the EOS M series 
such as the EOS M3, EOS M5 and EOS M10, the 
EOS M6 is compatible with a host of EOS M lenses. 
One of two kit options, EF-M15-45mm f/3.5-6.3 IS 
STM lens, is a compact zoom lens with a quiet 
stepping motor (STM) that comes with low-noise 
focusing ability, perfect for recording videos. 
This lens is also ideal for landscapes and group 
photos, thanks to its wide angle zoom. The EF-
M18-150mm f/3.5-6.3 IS STM lens is also compact 
and extremely portable. It gives you the flexibility 
to capture everything from wide landscapes to 
close-up shot of your pet at home, with excellent 
image quality in every shot.

The EF-M55-200mm f/4.5-6.3 IS STM lens is 
compatible to any of the EOS M mirrorless cameras

(141mm equivalent)/ Aperture-priority AE (f/5.6, 1/800 sec, 
EV+0.3)/ ISO 400/ WB: Daylight
Looking Through the LCD Screen or 
External Viewfinder
The EOS M6 is all about flexibility and ease of use, 
which is why this mirrorless camera comes with 
an option of shooting through a 3.0-inch touch 
panel LCD screen that can be tilted 180-degree 
upwards 
and 
45-degree 
downwards, 
or 
a 
detachable EVF-DC2 electronic viewfinder (EVF) 
that mirrors the vision of the camera’s sensor, 
just like a DSLR. EVF-DC2 is sold separately and 
is available in black at the moment.
Get Connected Constantly
The beauty in transferring crisp, quality photos 
from your camera to your phone is getting the kind 
of beautiful photos that you couldn’t have captured 
with a phone camera and then uploading online or 
sharing directly with your friends within seconds. 
This is possible with the EOS M6, which has a 
Bluetooth function that can connect the camera 
to a smartphone constantly as long as the power 
is turned on. With the Canon Camera Connect 
app, you can even use your phone as a remote for 
playback or shooting photos with EOS M6.
EOS M6 is an interesting camera because it 
combines the past and present. The mirrorless 
camera takes on a nostalgic look, reminiscent 
of a vintage camera, yet is packed with modern 
features that are powerful and makes photography 
effortlessly easy and convenient. Even for seasoned 
photography enthusiasts, EOS M6 is able to serve 
as a powerful alternative camera, perfect for travel 
and everyday use.

Canon EOS 77D
Canon Ecosystem Support
The mount on the EOS 77D supports the 
variety of lenses that Canon has released. 
The brand has also released new STM 
lenses that pairs perfectly with this 
camera, as it gives a linear speed during 
focusing and zoom actions while photo- 
and video-taking. 
Lighter than Air
The EOS 77D is one 
of the lightest DSLR 
cameras from Canon 
thus far – just a little 
over 500 grams!

Loads of Features
Aside from the latest Canon APS-C

megapixels, it has the latest imaging 
processor (DiGiC 7), and the latest STM 
kit lens. It also comes with a top LCD 
panel to show important information 
that is useful for the photographer or 
videographer. Plus, the grip is one of 
the more comfortable handholds for a 
camera we have used in a while.
Perfect for Vlogs
The Canon EOS 77D is one of the  
recently-launched models from the 
Japanese imaging company. The features 
of the camera make it very enticing for 
those who shoot both photos and videos, 
either for work or play. The camera 
inherits many features from older models. 
It has a lighter body that is very good for 
video bloggers who need to have their 
cameras at arm’s length.

Great Photos, Good Videos
The EOS 77D carries the legacy of great imaging 
prowess that Canons are known for. The images have 
the traditional warm-tint that is present with Canon 
cameras, but that is more of a personal taste than 
design. It also captures videos, but it is limited to Full 
HD footage. In an age of 4K videos, this is a handicap. 
Evolution, Not Revolution
The EOS 77D is more of an evolution 
than a revolution. The features are 
not new, just that they're re-packaged 
into a new design. However, the new 
package is welcomed as the EOS 77D 
is a solid performer that is a great buy

So Much Better than the Beach
Illegear Laguna
Design Hits & Misses 
Not one to rest on its laurels, Illegear has 
come up with the successor to the Z5 
with the Laguna gaming laptop. Taking 
certain design elements from the Z5, the 
Laguna features a similar keyboard and 
touchpad placement. As comfortable 
as it is, we wouldn’t recommend it as 
the touchpad isn’t at the centre of the 
keyboard, which makes typing weird 
and awkward. This is also due to the 
touchpad being carved into the body 
Random Noises

The fans start to emit 
audible sounds when you 
have multiple programs 
running simultaneously.
Mild-Mannered
When gaming, the GPU and CPU of the 
Laguna will rise from its steady 40-50 
degrees to between 70-85 degrees.
Slimming Pills 
Not Needed
When 
closed, 
the 
Laguna 
is 
much 
slimmer 
compared 
to its predecessor; 
this is great for when 
you want to bring  
it around.
God of Gaming
Through the benchmark results alone, the 
Laguna took us by surprise as it exceeded 
our high standards. Not surprising since 
it is packing some major heat like the 
NVIDIA GTX 1070 GPU and 16GB of 
RAM. Dota 2 gave us a consistent 120 
fps without any lag or screen-tearing. 
Overwatch has very similar stats as we

What’s the Difference in the End?
Having only been around for a handful of years, Illegear has managed to come up with a strong line-up of gaming laptops to 
suit the many needs and wants. From a budget-friendly device to an over-the-top achiever, Illegear features a wide range, all of 
which are customisable. In the end, the Laguna was made for top quality games as the GTX 1070 can handle almost anything 
you throw at it. 
Redesigned Thermal 
Cooling
Although it may be slightly 
loud, the Laguna’s new and 
improved thermal cooling 
components 
are 
largely 
the reason why it can be 
considered one of the top 
models of its price range.

Loud and Clear
The built-in speakers on the Laguna are actually pretty decent. It had 
pretty clear highs with sturdy mids and deep lows; an all-rounder of a gaming 
laptop if we do say so. It also comes with a built-in subwoofer, located at the bottom for that added 
‘oomph’. This is exceptionally great for movies thanks to its 15.6-inch Full HD display screen, making your movies 
pop with great colour and clarity. However, be sure your movie or video quality is 720p resolution at the very least.

Speedy
Compared to its other siblings, Harry is 
certainly the speedier of the bunch. The 
interface is fast and responsive; handling 
several tasks isn’t a problem. The only 
downside - it slows down a pinch when 
running resource-heavy apps. Running 
navigation on this phone is swift too  
– it reroutes almost immediately, with 
not much considerable lag.
Hungry
With much going for its performance, 
2500mAh, it will last a full day if you 
use it sparingly. If you were constantly 
on your phone, it’s best to bring a 
charger to keep it juiced up. Graphic 
heavy applications can drain the battery 
quickly. 
Keep the Lights On
The 13-megapixels rear camera works 
great for close up shots and in bright 
conditions. Shots are clear and colours 
are crisp. In low light though, the pictures 
become visibly grainy. The 5-megapixels 
front shooter is also decent for a 
quick selfie. The pictures won’t be the 
sharpest, but it holds up well for social 
media posting.

Greetings and Salutations, Moto
Moto G5 Plus
Action-packed Device
One outstanding feature that we love 
about the Moto G5 Plus is its Moto 
Action, which made life infinitely 
better after discovering it. Aside from 
the usual quick unlock via fingerprint 
sensor, the G5 Plus comes with easy and  
simple-to-remember actions to unlock 
the camera and flashlight. You can 
rotate the phone from left to right twice 
to unlock the camera and do it again 
to switch cameras; doing the chopping 
motion will turn the flashlight on or off.
Good Value Camera
Selling at RM1,299, you’re getting a decent 
camera with the G5 Plus. Its 12-megapixel 
rear camera comes with a large f/1.7 
aperture, which can capture more light as 
compared to its predecessor. The Saturn 
ring eclipsing the camera is a nice design 
touch as it lets you capture great-looking 
pictures in horrible lighting conditions. 
A quick switch over to the front-facing 
camera reveals the 5-megapixel wide-
angle lens, making group selfies clean and 
clear with minimal noise.
Made for the Masses
The G5 Plus comes with a Snapdragon 
625 octa-core 2.0GHz processor, which 
is relatively quick and snappy without 
sapping too much of your battery when 
fully-juiced. It also comes with 4GB of 
RAM, making it great for multitasking 
and even your day-to-day social media 
stalking as well as video streaming. With 
its attractive price, the G5 Plus is a great 
device to have with a reliable camera and 
above average specs. 
Designed to Please
The G5 Plus comes in either 
Lunar Grey or Fine Gold and 
its aluminium finish makes 
it comfortable to hold.
Not for Diving
Even if the G5 Plus can’t be 
fully submerged underwater, 
the phone can survive 
light showers, accidental  
splashes and spills.
My Name is Turbo
Although the G5 Plus comes 
with a 3,000mAh battery, 
it can’t last you 24 hours. 
However, it does come with 
a TurboPower charger that 
juices the phone up in 15 
minutes, which gives you six 
hours of battery life.

Small Desktop, Anyone?
Asus Vivo Mini UN65U
Just Enough I/O
The Vivo Mini comes with a complete 
selection of ports. This includes four 
USB ports (two at the front and two at 
the back), an SD card slot at the side, 
HDMI, Display Port and even a LAN 
port for networking. Of course, there is 
a built-in WiFi for wireless connectivity. 
All this in a box that is barely bigger 
than a notebook.
Just Enough Performance
Underneath the plastic exterior lies 
an Intel Core i5 7200U CPU. It is a 7th 
generation processor, but it is more suited 
for low power productivity rather than 
high-power gaming. Still, it can run most 
AAA games (albeit at really low settings) 
with ease. 8GBs of RAM does help with 
running everything smoothly, but if you 
need more storage, you can easily add on 
to the 128GB SSD that is already inside 
with a 2.5-inch hard drive. 
No USB Type-C?
We expected at least one 
USB Type-C port on board; 
sadly there are none.
Lightweight
The Vivo Mini UN65U is very 
light that you can cart it 
around the office easily.
Unobtrusive Design
ASUS has created a product  
that looks good.
Compact Desktop
Thanks to the compact nature of the 
ASUS Vivo Mini, your desktop will be 
clear of any unwanted clutter (apart 
from the ones you create yourself). The 
small footprint of the computer means

Lite in Performance
Huawei P10 Lite
Wait, Let Me Take a Selfie
The 12-megapixels rear camera takes 
really clear pictures. In fact, it performs 
really well in low light, bringing out clear 
details. The colours may not be as crisp 
or as true to life - but for documenting 
memories, it does a very good job. The 
8MP front shooter is great for selfies. 
With a beauty mode that smoothens 
your flaws, as well as flash, you can look 
good even if it’s a dark room. 
Leave the Charger
Packed with a 3000mAh battery, it holds 
up well to a long day’s work and play. 
Running several applications concurrently 
does tend to heat it up fast, but it quickly 
cools down too. 
Did You Cover the Top?
If the top part of the phone is 
covered, the phone automatically 
disables the screen. This is pretty 
handy, so you don’t accidentally 
launch applications. No more 
pocket dials!
Smooth Finishing
The 2.5D double-sided 
curve glass makes it 
really nice to hold. With 
a slim profile, it doesn’t 
feel bulky either.
Smooth Performance, Until  
it Lags
For day-to-day use, the P10 Lite works 
like a dream. Scroll through social 
media, chat, watch videos, play some 
light games, navigate – it all works 
smoothly. Don’t hold any hopes for being 
able to run games, play videos, and have 
several apps running in the background 
all at once though; it will seize up.

gaming laptop: the ROG Strix series. The 
GL553VD comes at a very modest price 
alongside respectable specs that make 
it a worthy consideration. Not only is it 
fitted with Intel’s top-of-the line Kaby 
Lake i7 processor, it also comes with the 
NVIDIA GTX 1050 GPU, which gave us 
a consistent and reliable performance 
when it comes to gaming and working.
We Need More Minerals 
RAM
Sadly, the GL553VD only comes with 8GB 
DDR4 RAM, which is a bit of a downer. 
Sure, we can game comfortably but when 
it came to gaming while multi-tasking, it 
began to slow down. Thankfully, it was 
not to the point where it is insufferable. If 
you’re considering this gaming laptop, may 
we suggest you upgrade it to at least 16GB 
or to a maximum of 32GB.
Perfect Wide-Angle
The GL553VD comes with a 15.6-inch 
Full HD display screen with a 178-degree 
which is great for gaming and other 
activities.  There is no screen tearing 
of colour distortion at any viewing 
angle, which is perfect for hardcore 
gamers. The bezel of the screen also 
comes with a matte finish; this made 
gaming, working and watching movies 
even greater as the bezel will not 
distract us while we are focused on  
gaming or work.
Two-Dimensional Speakers
With or without headphones, the built-in 
speakers are great for movies and music but 
not so great for gaming as the sound becomes 
garbled when the volume is turned up.
Connect All Your Devices
The GL553VD comes with a Type-C reversible 
port, two USB3.0 ports and one USB2.0 port so 
you can connect your smartphone to charge it 
and even other devices like a mouse, keyboard 
and an external HDD.

Insanely Quiet
One feature that we like on the GL553VD is the extremely quiet cooling fans. Even leaving our game on pause for about 15 
minutes, it still ran pretty smoothly without overheating. The ROG-exclusive Cooling Overboost feature that comes pre-installed 
is quite useful as you can adjust fan speeds to suit your needs. The only part that we didn’t enjoy was the palm rest, which tends 
to heat up. Perhaps that is normal for gaming laptops, though we wish they can rectify this heat problem. 
A Good Starting Point
With the GTX 1050, the GL553VD 
gets the job done when it comes 
to MOBA and team shooter 
games. It is not so great when it 
comes to more graphic-intensive 
games, however. 
Keeping it Light
For a gaming laptop, the 
GL553VD is lightweight at 
only 3kg, with a relatively 
small footprint.
Chiclet Keys? Really?
We are firmly against using the built-in keyboard as we believe it is inadequate compared to proper mechanical gaming keyboards. 
We are also not a fan of the chiclet gaming keyboard that comes with the GL553VD. Sure, typing on it is perfectly fine but when 
it came to gaming, the keys are too soft with no curvature point between them, resulting in us pressing the wrong keys during 
important points in the game.

Acer KG251Q Monitor
Great for AMD Users
If you’re using any of the AMD Radeon 
GPUs, you’ll be glad to know that the 
KG251Q monitor comes with AMD 
FreeSync technology. Much like NVIDIA’s 
G-Sync technology, FreeSync will render 
screen tearing and broken frames a thing 
of the past. By syncing the display’s 
framerate to the graphic card, you will 
get consistent framerates along with 
smooth and fluid screen rendering and 
transitions without any issues.
Made to Game
The KG251Q is predominantly a gaming 
monitor. With the use of AMD FreeSync, 
you'll be able to reach up to 144Hz 
refresh rate for better framerates and 
even a 1ms response time, allowing 
the image to refresh itself quickly. 
Priced at RM659, you might be a little 
hesitant in paying that amount for a 
gaming monitor. However, with a long 
list of features, the KG251Q is a worthy 
investment, especially if you’re using an 
AMD GPU with FreeSync-enabled. 
Keeping it Clean
One thing we enjoy 
about 
the 
KG251Q 
is its three-pronged 
stand, giving you a 
steady balance while 
still taking up very  
little space.
Time to Mount Up
To free up desk space, 
the KG251Q can also 
be mounted onto the 
wall thanks to the VESA  
wall mount.
Adjust with Ease
KG251Q can be tilted 5-degrees 
forward or 15-degrees backwards, 
for 
greater 
flexibility 
when  
gaming or working.

Slim and Neat
The in-thing for monitors these days is 
to have no bezel whatsoever, giving you

to enjoy while still looking easy on the 
eye. It also comes with Acer ComfyView, 
reducing the amount of light reflected 
on the screen to ease the strain on your 
eyes.

Viewsonic VP2468
Inspired Design
Bring this to your work station and marvel 
at the minimal design. It has a very thin 
bezel all around the 24-inch display 
making it look smaller than it actually is. 
The stand gives users full control for tilt, 
pitch and even rotation as the monitor 
can be rotated 90-degrees, making 
reading long documents easy. We wish 
the base was heavier however, as abrupt 
movements can shift the monitor easily. 
For Professionals
The VP2468 is designed to be used 
by professionals, as it comes with a  
14-bit 3D look-up table. It can generate 
up to 4.39 trillion different colours for 
accurate image reproduction, crucial

Turbo Boost Your Storage
Intel Optane 32GB
m.2 On Board
The Intel Optane uses the m.2 PCIe 
slot design, which can be easily 
placed into any free PCIe slot on 
your motherboard to increase the 
I/O operations that your system 
can handle. It will act like a cache 
rather than a normal NVMe storage. 
What this means is that you will get  
SSD-like speeds in accessing your 
data with your current storage.
3D XPoint Tech
The 
Optane 
memory 
decreases 
the latency of data accessed on 
your system by a factor of over a 
hundred, making your system faster 
than ever before, thanks to the 3D 
Xpoint technology from Intel. We 
would like to see more access and 
customisation from Intel in accessing 
the Optane memory from the desktop 
in the future though; more granular 
access would be appreciated 
16/32GB Only
As it is meant to 
be a cache, Optane 
comes in only 16GB or  
32GB flavours.
Boost Your System
A simple design meant to boost your 
system performance? Yes, please
Optane-Supported?
Make sure your motherboard is  
Optane-supported as motherboards 
need to be certified to accept this 
memory add-on.
Boost Your Storage
Acting as a cache on the motherboard is 
exactly what the Intel Optane memory 
is designed for. It can turbocharge your 
storage by acting as a temporary space 
for copied content before using it in 
applications/games on your system. 
While the concept is not new, Intel’s 
implementation is the first time that the 
form factor is designed to be used on 
the motherboard itself.

Your Buck Goes Bang with 
this Simple Trick
AMD Ryzen 5 1400
Something New
The R5 series shares a lot of function and 
performance with its flagship brother. 
This means that you will get dual channel 
DDR4 support, native USB 3.0 and 3.1  
built-in processor, and finally, NVME 
storage for fast storage access. Sadly, no 
in-built graphics yet.
Unlock the Potential
This Ryzen processor features unlocked 
multipliers, and this is the same with 
Ryzen 1400. While it is limited to 
3.4GHz boost clock, we could easily get 
a stable 3.8Ghz with just a clock tweak 
and voltage tweak in the motherboard 
BIOS, and there is still headroom for 
higher overclock. You just need some 
good third-party cooler for these 
processors to go the distance for better 
cooling performance. 
Multi-thread 
Support
Thanks to its four cores, 
you get proper multi-
threading support – up 
to eight threads with the 
Ryzen 5 1400.

that are reluctant to part with around 
RM2.6K to get the R7 1800X, AMD has a 
few options up its sleeve for the mid-range

Affordable MOBA Beast
Budget-Focused Built
Acer has now come out with a gaming 
desktop through its Aspire series, a 
more budget-friendly alternative to 
its more insane Predator series (the 
Predator 21x is crazy expensive!). With 
the price set at RM4,399, the Aspire 
GX-781 comes with a GTX 1050 paired 
with an i7 processor, 8GB of RAM and 
even a HDD+SSD combo, making it a 
respectable mid-tower at a somewhat 
affordable price. However, does it 
perform well above its paygrade?
Worthy Benchmark Scores
In terms of running the GX-781 through 
our set of benchmarks, it performed 
admirably well (which isn’t all that 
surprising with what it's packing 
underneath). However, its price is more 
attractive as it can clearly handle itself 
when put under pressure. Overall, 
the GX-781 is a great machine for its 
intended design and purpose. 
Great for MOBAs
Installing games to test on the machine 
(we love our job), the GX-781 is pretty 
great with most MOBA and team shooter 
games like Dota 2, LoL, Overwatch and 
CS:GO. We got a good 60-70 fps from 
each game, which is pretty good with all 
things considered. Sadly, running more 
graphic-intensive games on it isn’t that 
great as you would need to reduce the 
video settings to get better frames out 
of the games. 
Charge Wirelessly
You can charge your phone  
wirelessly with the GX-781 thanks 
to the Qi Wireless charging dock 
located at the top of the case, right 
behind the power button.
More Than Enough Ports
The GX-781 comes with a total of seven 
USB ports – the front of the case houses 
a USB Type-C reversible connector port, 
an SD card reader and another USB 
port while the back has another five 
ports, making it even easier to connect  
all your devices.
Limited Upgradablitiy
Although the GX-781 only comes with the 
standard 8GB of RAM, you can upgrade it 
to a total of 32GB to give you that extra 
kick of performance.

Solid Heart for Data
Toshiba MN05ACA800 8TB HDD
Optimised for Power
For this review, we used Netgear’s 
ReadyNAS. As it can be attested on 
the performance panel, this is a steady 
performer in terms of power. Even after 
non-stop usage for several days, the 
disk doesn’t overheat easily, and has 
power management features that will 
optimise operating environments during 
off-peak activity periods.
Run it 24/7
When it comes to enterprise data, 
downtime is almost unacceptable. This 
8TB drive is designed especially for 
NAS, operating 24/7. With a 550TB 
transferred-per-year rated workload, 
and a 2,000,000-hour MTBF (mean time 
between failure) rating, This HDD is 
made to last the long run.  
Hefty
At 770g, it is definitely on 
the heavier end of HDDs. 
Although bearing in mind, 
this does pack in 8TBs' 
worth though.
Pack it In
Most hard disks come in the 
standard 3.5-inch design, 
most commonly with 1TB, 
4TB or 6TB iterations. To be 
able to pack 8TB in the same 
form factor, you get the 
most out of the same-sized  
hard disk. 
Decent Speeds
With transfer speeds up to 230MB/s, 
and rotation speed of 7,200 rpm, this 
hard disk is designed to be one of the 
faster HDD offerings in the market. Of 
course for speed and performance many 
will opt for SSDs but when it comes to 
storing data reliably and at a lower cost, 
this 8TB of HDD is more than worth the 
money.

“Simple set up, with all the basic functions to safeguard your data, it’s a solid NAS that would 
serve well for small and medium businesses. ” - Satoko 
Easy Setup
Once you’re connected to the LAN, your 
computer will detect the NAS and take 
you to a setup wizard. Following the 
steps was easy though it will take some 
time for all the storage to be configured. 
The system also comes with snapshot, 
antivirus, encryption, as well as backup 
and recovery capabilities, ensuring a 
simple operation for backing up data.
Access Your Data Anywhere
The

outside of the network range. It also 
allows for integration with third party 
cloud providers like Dropbox, Google 
Drive, Amazon S3, Amazon Cloud Drive, 
making it simple to sync your data  
across platforms.  
Safe and Secure
The admin platform is easy to navigate, 
with various functions and features 
commonly expected for an enterprise 
level NAS. You could easily see the 
performance, or manage the settings 
of your disks and system logs all on a 
single platform. There are also options 
for you to add users, manage apps, as 
well as have full control over the privacy 
and sharing functions. 
Single-Glance Panel 
The front panel shows you all 
the main status of the NAS 
as well as free space on the 
installed drives. Makes it easy 
to tell when it’s setting up, or 
syncing the local storage.
No Screws 
Needed
The drive tray is designed 
so any HDD installed can 
easily snap on. 
Enough Ports for 
Everyone
With six slots available  
- assuming each slot takes 
10TB drives - you can fit 60TB 
on this NAS. It comes with 
eSATA and USB 2.0 ports, and 
there are more than enough 
ports for further extension 
beyond the potential 60TB.

music will sound just as good as it does 
through any other pair of headphones  
or speakers.

‘Super Bass’, the XB7 comes with 
Sony’s ExtraBass feature. With a

you’re listening to some much-needed 
basslines. The ClearAudio+ feature also 
optimises your music quality, giving 
great highs with a respectable mid and

detect the office network and link up to 
the app. Once it’s connected, everything 
was fine and dandy. The video is still 
flipped upside-down. It did not detect 
which way is up; it assumes that it is 
ceiling-mounted.
Alert! Alert!
You can set the motion and audio 
sensors to send you notifications. Keep 
in mind it's quite sensitive. If the area 
of detection is busy, you will receive a 
lot of notifications thanks to the auto-
snapshot function. The camera can also 
be set to follow subjects – which freaked 
out a few people in the office when 
the camera tracks and pans, following 
them around! One thing We couldn’t 
figure out is why you couldn’t record  
video on this?

VERDICT:
SPECS
“Apart from a slightly fiddly initial setup – it was easy and straightforward monitoring, with 
many interesting features. A solid IP camera. ” - Satoko
Straightforward App
The application has a straightforward 
interface that does what it says on the 
tin. Watch your stream live, manually 
pan the cameras, sound the alarm  
– all accesible at your fingertips. You 
could set facial recognition so the 
camera recognises who is on the safe 
list. Besides that, there are quite a lot 
of customisation for home positions, 
notifications etc.
Easy Access
The app allows you to access the 
camera anytime wherever you are. 
Once you manage to get it connected, 
that is.
Shhhhh
Too many notifications? You 
could set it to private mode 
so it won’t disturb you in  
your sleep.
Let There Be Light!
The light automatically turns 
on when it gets dark. So you 
definitely can see the visuals 
on the live stream even if it’s in 
a dark room.

oing for thin laptops is no longer a compromise for the consumer. Today, thin and light laptops can carry their weight as they 
are no longer limited in performance and features. In fact, modern-day thin and light laptops can stand up against other 
laptops in the market. Some of them can be just as capable in the long run.
We gather four current-generation slim and portable laptops from four different manufacturers – Dell, Acer, ASUS 
and HP – and how they fare in a head-to-head comparison.

ell is no longer boring, if the XPS 13 2-in-1 is any 
indication. It is thin, and can be converted to multiple 
modes to suit the scenario. It is no slouch when it 
comes to performance, sporting an Intel Core i7 
processor, 8GB of RAM across all models and the Dell Infinity 
display. This technology fits a 13.3-inch screen into a 12.2-inch 
body. You get minimal bezel all around; it is almost like an 
infinity pool as the screen seems to bleed to the edges.
For a 2-in-1 design, the Dell XPS 13 has enough space 
for a sprinkle of ports. You get two USB Type-C ports – one 
on each side – that work for charging and external display 
through Thunderbolt. A microSD slot is there for any external 
data, and a combo headphone/microphone jack completes the 
package. Oh, the USB Type-C ports come with the required 
dongles to support both normal USB and HDMI.
There is a drawback; Dell has made the magnets that 
keeps the two halves together very strong. How strong? This 
is one laptop that you can’t open with a single hand – it is 
strictly a two-handed operation. This can be tricky when you 
need it open at your desk while you have something in your 
other hand. Otherwise, this is a great laptop to have as your 
daily driver.

HP Spectre x360
ith its alluring colour selection, the HP Spectre x360 
is one of the more premium-looking devices in this 
roundup. The gold accents around the edges give 
it a very subtle, yet appealing look, turning heads 
wherever you go.
Like the Dell, the Spectre x360 is a convertible 
laptop. This means that it can change to laptop mode, tent 
mode and tablet mode. Each mode gives the user of the  
Spectre x360 freedom of usage, as different modes can be 
used for different situations.
Underneath the aluminium-clad body lies Intel’s latest 
7th generation Core processor, 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB 
of fast SSD storage. HP has managed to shrink the bezel of the 
Spectre x360 to fit a larger screen into a smaller body. All this, 
while keeping the thickness of the machine less than 15mm.
One downside of the Spectre x360 is its capricious 
ability to heat up faster than average. This renders 
the device a no-go for your lap. Its fans do tend to  
get audible once the temperature increases, something HP 
should work on.

he smallest of the bunch is also the most expensive of 
the lot. The ZenBook 3 certainly feels posh and upmarket. 
When you take it out of its box, the thickness – or lack 
thereof – stands out. The full metal body of the ZenBook 3 
will blend in with the surroundings of high-end establishments, 
while the blue/gold colour scheme will catch everybody’s eyes.
Even though it has a thin body, it has enough juice to be a 
mobile powerhouse. You get an Intel Core i7 7500U processor, 
16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. This is definitely not 
your father’s portable work machine. Plus, the capabilities of 
the ZenBook 3 can be expanded through the USB Type-C port 
with Thunderbolt. For example, an external graphics card board 
can be connected to make it more of a desktop work/gaming 
machine when needed.
This screen is the smallest of the lot at only 12.5-inches. 
But, it has the benefit of high definition capabilities with good 
colour reproduction. The keyboard is also surprisingly usable, 
given that it is physically smaller than the rest.
It is not without its drawbacks, however. The biggest is 
that there is only one USB Type-C port that acts as both data and 
power port for the device. This will put a damper on productivity, 
especially when you’re on-the-go.

he thinnest machine here is also the largest in terms of 
footprint. The Acer Swift 7 may be wider, but it is the 
thinnest among the four, measuring at 9.98mm at the 
thickest part. Even so, Acer crammed a lot of technology 
in something thinner than this magazine.
Underneath the metal body is Intel’s Core i5 7th generation 
processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The screen is a 
13.3-inch unit, but unlike the others, the bezel around the screen 
isn’t as thin. It is still a good screen however, covered with 
Corning Gorilla Glass for protection against scratches.
Thankfully, Acer gave the Swift 7 two USB Type-C ports, 
so you can charge and connect your external data storage at 
the same time to transfer data in and out. Acer also used the 
extra surface area to its advantage by putting in an extra-large 
trackpad. Nice touch there, Acer.
What brings the Swift 7 down is the thickness of the 
device itself. It looks fragile at first glance, so users will be more 
than hesitant to tote this. The flex on the screen and body is 
also higher than the others. However, the usability of the device 
outweighs the negative aspects.

CONCLUSION
The thin and light category of laptops has grown significantly in the past few years. No longer are they relegated to having 
barely enough processing power – some of the machines available on sale today are miniature powerhouses when compared 
to others. 
The four models – from Dell, HP, ASUS and Acer – are testament to how far the segment has evolved and grown. We are 
definitely going to be seeing more of these machines coming into our labs soon. 
In the meantime, the four here represent the best that the thin and light segment has on offer. After great deliberation, we 
crown the winner of this month’s showdown: HP Spectre x360. The combination of performance level, feature set and value 
for money makes this a great option for anyone looking for a stylish, yet capable machine for day-to-day use.

alaysian consumers are choosing smartphones 
that have bigger screen size. A study by 
GfK reveals that over 45% of the 8.5 
million units of smartphones purchased 
within the last 12 months measure over 5-inches.
The Point of Sales tracking also notes that consumers 
collectively spent about RM6.8 billion (bn) worth of 
smartphones in 2016, a significant increase from RM5.4bn 
in 2015. The biggest spike in sales is contributed by mid-
range models costing between RM900 and RM1,050.
“Since Malaysian consumers are largely motivated by price, 
we believe that the mid-range category of smartphones will 
continue to dominate the market this year. Furthermore, we 
anticipate further sales surge for this popular device, with the 
country’s recovering economy being a key contributing factor,” 
says Stanley Kee, Managing Director for Southeast Asia, GfK.

Asia the Way to Go
Expedia increases focus and investments on Asia as a region
ost people would be 
excited at the thought 
of travelling, especially 
if it means taking a 
break from your hectic day-to-
day schedule. For a company 
like Expedia, who are in the 
business 
of 
travel, 
identifying 
new trends and exploring new 
technologies 
can 
benefit 
the 
growth of its online platform. 
In a recent unveiling of its 
Innovation Lab for Asia – the 
first of its kind in the region – in 
Singapore, Expedia reveals its 
intense focus on transforming 
travel 
through 
innovation 
and 
technological 
application.
The transformation of travel for 
Expedia is not just about making 
the average experience better. 
Through analysis and powerful 
data insights help improve each 
user’s unique experience. Only by 
understanding 
the 
data-driven 
insights, 
improvement 
can 
be 
done 
quickly 
and 
seamlessly.
M
“Expedia’s 
global 
success 
comes from a culture that values 
innovation 
and 
investment 
in 
technology. The key differentiator 
is 
that 
we 
do 
every 
single 
improvement based on powerful 
data insights. It has been our 
driving force for the past 20 
years. We invested US$1.2billion 
in 
technology 
in 
2016 
and 
with our 2000 engineers and 
700 data scientists we deliver 
personalised 
experiences 
that 
come with more choice, flexibility 
and 
savings 
for 
both 
our 
customers and partners”, says 
Arthur Chapin, Senior VP Product 
and 
Design, 
Expedia 
group.
“We are already preparing for 
the time when machines will be 
able to not just analyse but also 
understand when to act on real-
time data. The companies that 
are going to win in the end are 
those that structure themselves 
to prepare for these changes, act 
on them and be first to market.”
Expedia places great emphasis 
on addressing the question on 
what have they solved for their 
customers. This is done around a 
hypothesis-and-test world, which is 
referred to ‘test and learn’ internally. 
This has changed the way the 
company thinks about innovation, 
having moved from four release 
cycles per year, to weekly releases-
allowing for an agile development.
“People don’t travel to go to a 
place, people travel for an outcome 
and the next big thing in travel 
will be a better use of information 
to make the travel inspiration 
and 
booking 
experience 
more 
personalised 
and 
predictive 
in 
real-time”, 
enthuses 
Chapin.
Expedia’s 
strategy 
of 
understanding its customers in 
Asia is not surprising, considering 
that is sees significant growth 
in 
emerging 
markets 
such 
as 
Malaysia 
and 
Thailand. 
Dara Khosrowshahi, President 
and CEO of Expedia, Inc, who was

JULY 2017
“People don’t 
travel to go to 
a place, people 
travel for an 
outcome and 
the next big 
thing in travel”
also in town during the launch, 
shares the projection: two thirds 
of the world’s population will live in 
Asia by 2030, Asia travel market is 
expected to grow four times faster 
than North America and two-and-
a-half times faster than Europe.
“Travel is a force of good. It has 
the power to change the world. 
There is no place for bigotry and 
intolerance 
among 
those 
who 
travel and open themselves to 
different cultures, customs and 
viewpoints. It’s encouraging to 
see that the majority agrees, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
the 
growth 
rates 
of 
the 
travel 
industry, 
which 
is 
growing 
faster 
than 
global GDP”, says Khosrowshahi. 
“Our 
culture 
of 
data-driven 
insights is making it clear to us 
that the success in the next 10-20 
years will depend on how well we 
do in Asia. The investments we are 
making here, such as the Expedia 
Innovation 
Lab, 
allows 
us 
to 
understand our customers in Asia 
better; invest in our people and in 
technology that serves better both 
the travellers and our partners”. 
To better capitalise on this 
growth, the Expedia group and 
Asia 
created 
a 
joint 
venture 
company – AAE Travel Pte Ltd – 
since 2011. The company has been 
overseeing 
both 
Expedia 
and 
AirAsiaGo points of sale across 
the region. To date, Expedia is 
the majority shareholder in the 
company with 75% equity shares.
“For us, AirAsia has been a 
fantastic partner. We had a decent 
position in Asia and looking at the 
North America growth rates, we 
were happy with our business in 
Asia. Tony Fernandes, however 
took one look and said, ‘That’s not 
good guys!’. We had no idea that 
Asia offered such a significant and 
rapid growth until our partnership 
with AirAsia. It kicked us into an 
aggressive stage of growth through 
its scale and deep insights into 
this region,” Khosrowshahi shares. 
It is clear to see that opportunities 
in Asia will be the company’s focus 
in the mid-term future, with plans 
to grow the region into the second 
largest market for the online travel 
company in the next five years.

Hello Alice
Machine learning will predict users’ needs and curate hyper 
targeted content
eet Alice: the first-ever 
artificial 
intelligence 
platform 
for 
female 
entrepreneurs. 
The 
platform by Circular Board, in 
partnership with Dell and Pivotal, 
is a virtual advisor that connects 
entrepreneurs in real-time.
Driven by data analytics, Alice 
is on a mission to significantly 
increase 
female 
founders 
to 
succeed 
at 
unprecedented 
levels. As the platform populates, 
machine learning will allow her 
to predict users’ needs to guide 
them to referrals, events, mentors 
and access points.
“Alice is a female founder’s best 
mentor, guide and consultant. 
The current start-up ecosystem 
continues 
to 
cycle 
resources 
among a very small percentage 
of well-connected entrepreneurs, 
making 
it 
difficult 
for 
less 
traditional founders to navigate,” 
says Carolyn Rodz, Founder and 
CEO of Circular Board. 
“Alice instantly filters millions of 
resources down to personalised, 
verified 
content 
that 
enables 
founders to scale to new heights.”
The 
collaboration 
began 
in 2016, where Circular Board 
approached Dell with an idea 
to disrupt the start-up world 
by 
building 
an 
entirely 
new 
ecosystem for women founders. 
Built on its existing commitment 
to support growing businesses, 
Dell grabbed a leadership seat 
at the table to lend its expertise, 
capital and innovative spirit.
“Entrepreneurship is part of 
Dell’s DNA. We’re always looking 
for ways to bring entrepreneurs 
the best technology solutions to 
help empower them in the new 
world of digital transformation,” 
says Karen Quintos, EVP and 
Chief Customer Officer, Dell. 
“Through the power of the Dell 
Technologies network and the 
expertise of the Circular Board, 
we’re driving innovation to help 
women entrepreneurs take their 
businesses to the next level.”
Pivotal, 
the 
company 
accelerating 
start-ups 
and 
enterprises digital transformation, 
developed and deployed Alice’s 
software in near record-setting 
time – just over three months from 
concept to launch. The Circular 
Board team successfully adopted 
both of Pivotal’s next-gen software 
development methodology and 
cloud 
technology, 
to 
ensure 
machine 
learning 
capabilities 
allow 
Alice 
to 
evolve 
and 
continue to provide targeted 
resources and mentorship.
“Circular 
Board 
is 
leading 
the 
way 
in 
helping 
female 
entrepreneurs turn ideas into 
fast-growing businesses,” shares 
Rob Mee, CEO, Pivotal. 
“Working with us, the Circular 
Board team have successfully 
adopted Pivotal’s next-generation 
methods and technologies to 
ensure 
their 
ecosystem 
and 
platform thrives. We’re thrilled to 
be able to help Circular Board on 
this important mission.”

Safeguarding 
From Exploit
Exploit kits are a form of malicious toolkit that exploit security holes, 
known as vulnerabilities, in order to infect the user with malware
alware 
authors 
have 
been using Microsoft 
Office 
document 
exploits 
for 
several 
years. However, their focus has 
recently 
shifted 
to 
document 
malware. Some examples include 
the Microsoft Word Intruder and 
Ancalog Builder, which spreads 
malware onto computers using 
booby-trapped 
Word 
files. 
AK 
Builder, the latest addition to 
the exploit kit family, generates 
malicious 
Word 
documents 
in 
Rich Text. It uses exploits to 
deliberately 
corrupt 
files 
that 
automatically trigger bugs in Office 
and underlying bugs in Windows.
In a recent research conducted 
by SophosLabs, it found two 
variations of the AK Builder,  
which are differentiated by the 
Office vulnerabilities they target. 
SophosLabs 
identified 
that 
AK-1 was most active between 
the middle of 2015 and 2016. It 
generated about 760 malicious 
documents, which were used 
to distribute to more than 50 
different malware families. The 
emergence of its successor AK-2 
seemed to spell the end of the

Why is the AK Builder 
successful? 
As the AK Builder is coded in a 
simple Python script, it is easy 
to steal the builder to start a 
new ‘development branch’, which 
means although an individual 
developed the malware, other 
attackers can simply access the 
code, modify it and release their 
own versions into the wild.
AK Builder is also advertised 
in YouTube videos and sold in 
underground 
forums 
for 
only 
US$550 
per 
kit. 
The 
sheer 
affordability 
and 
availability 
of black market tools make it 
possible for criminals to gain 
access to the AK Builder to 
generate exploited documents.
Additionally, 
unlike 
the 
Microsoft Word Intruder and 
the Ancalog builder, the AK 
Builder has always supported 
encrypted decoys. This is an 
important feature in successful 
attacks as displaying decoy 
content can help hide malicious 
activities in the background. It 
is also less suspicious if this 
content is displayed after the 
victim opens what he thinks is 
a Word document.

How to defend against the 
AK Builder?
Enterprises can adopt a multi-
pronged approach with these 
recommended steps: 
1. Patch 
promptly 
as 
the 
booby-trapped 
Office 
documents 
generated 
by 
exploit kits,  attack security 
holes that were  patched 
years ago.
2. Consider 
implementing 
a 
holistic, 
next-generation 
security solution to manage 
exploits 
and 
fileless 
malware
3. Beware 
of 
unsolicited 
attachments, and only open 
documents 
from 
known 
senders
4. Remove or disable privileged 
accounts 
in 
the 
system, 
and only install applications 
from known publishers 
5. Consider using a stripped-
down document viewer. For 
example, Microsoft’s Word 
Viewer 
is 
usually 
less 
vulnerable than Word itself, 
especially since it doesn’t 
support macros.

HUAWEI MALAYSIA’S MATTHEW NG SHARES THE BRAND’S STORY
SPOTLIGHT
By Sharil
BREAKING
BOUNDARIES
WITH INNOVATION

JULY 2017

smartphone is no longer a 
luxury – it is now a necessity. 
Malaysia 
has 
a 
mobile 
penetration rate of almost 
140%, which translates to 
about 1.4 phones for every Malaysian. 
The fact is, the smartphone market is 
still growing in Malaysia – even if it 
is not as prolific as previous years. 
The sentiment is still high enough 
that 
brands 
like 
Huawei 
are focusing on 
increasing 
its 
brand 
exposure 
locally, especially 
in the high-end 
segment. 
Matthew Ng, 
Deputy 
Country 
Director of Huawei 
Malaysia, agrees 
that 
Malaysia 
is still a high-
potential market. 
The demand for 
the Huawei P10 
family in Malaysia 
is so high, sales 
for the new model 
have reached 62% 
of the total sales for the Huawei P9; this 
is within the first three months of its 
initial sale. Surprisingly, this number is 
split between the P10 and the P10 Plus, 
without any bias to any one model. 
“In the latest numbers shared by 
Ipsos, we have hit a high of 90% of 
awareness in the local market. What 
Huawei did in the last one and a half 
years is to be true to our core value – 
customer centricity. This means we will 
give customers what they want and 
what they need,” Matthew commented 
when asked about the mindshare 
growth for the brand in Malaysia. 
Huawei Malaysia is not one 
to rest on its laurels. The brand will 
be working with partners to open up 
new Huawei-branded stores across 
Malaysia in 2017, with a total number 
of 250 by the end of the year. Each store 
will be a partner-owned full-branded 
Huawei stores. 
The company feels that its 
collaboration has borne fruit, especially 
with the Leica tie-up. The long-term 
partnership signed between the two 
brands has resulted in the Leica/Huawei 
lab in Germany being set up. The lab will 
be researching everything about digital 
imaging, including but not limited to 
photography, lens design, VR and so on. 
When commenting on innovation 
in the smartphone industry, Ng believes 
that innovation still reigns strong, rather 
than being taken for granted. “Huawei 
as a brand subscribes to the belief 
that it will deliver the best product the 
customers need every time. This is why 
our products deliver just the right amount 
of features without overwhelming 
customers for the sake of innovation.”
Ng joined the company at an 
opportune time. Entrusted with the 
right set of products, acumen and 
brand awareness, Ng has grown the 
brand to where it is today. Following 
the company’s core idea of ‘customer 
centricity’, he has brought the brand to 
new heights thanks to his knowledge 
of the Malaysian market. 
With over 2,000 employees in 
Malaysia, Huawei has been integral in 
the development of Malaysia’s telco 
industry. 
Aside 
from 
the 
Carrier 
Network 
Group 
and the Enterprise 
Business 
Group 
withint 
Huawei, 
Ng 
oversees 
the 
Consumer Business 
Group.
“Q3 will be an 
exciting time for the 
brand, as we will be 
stepping into a new 
market segment. We 
will be announcing 
the 
Nova 
brand 
in 
Malaysia 
for 
the 
sub-RM1,000 
smartphone market. 
A certain amount 
of investment will 
be made to solidify Huawei’s position 
in the market, especially in this new 
segment,” says Ng. 
2017 will be a very exciting year 
for Huawei, as we can expect to see 
it spread its wings further, to push 
boundaries and to see where the 
company can soar here in Malaysia.

he issue of cybersecurity has 
come under scrutiny once 
again. The Asia Pacific region, 
home to scores of established 
and up and coming businesses has 
become vulnerable to multiple threats 
from cyberspace.
According 
to 
Malwarebytes’ 
recent Asia Pacific State of Malware 
Report 2017, Malaysia ranked 5th in 
volume of malware detected in the 
country. Malaysia also ranked 11th 
to malware threats, with a 27.6% 
malware reported rate (which is higher 
than the worldwide average of 20.8%) 
in Microsoft Security intelligence 
Report, volume 21. During the recent 
“wannaCry” cyber attack, a Malaysian 
academic institution, local businesses, 
and organisations were affected.  
in a business environment where 
firms face such heightened levels of 
security breaches, organisations are 
investing in more sophisticated and 
robust infrastructure. From advanced 
machine 
learning 
and 
artificial 
intelligence to cloud-based monitoring 
and 
analysis 
technologies, 
there 
are many sophisticated solutions 
being adopted to fight cybercrime. 
Yet, 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
these 
solutions are increasingly dependent 
on one often overlooked business  
commodity – employees.
with the rise in BYOD and flexible 
working practices, employees are often 
the biggest threat to safeguarding 
a company’s data and iP against

Technology Alone Cannot 
Prevent A Security Breach
The need for companies to focus on the frontline

criminals. 
Staff 
negligence 
and indifference to iT policy is one 
of the most significant inhibitors to 
cloud security. Almost two-thirds of 
companies attribute “employees lack 
of cybersecurity knowledge” as the 
biggest inside threat and only one in ten 
Asia Pacific companies fully understand 
how cyberattacks are performed.
in research by the Ponemon 
institute for Citrix, titled “The need 
for a new iT Security Architecture: 
Global Study”, over half (60%) of 
respondents from the Asia Pacific 
region states that employees and third 
parties often bypass security policies  
and technologies.
This lack of education and 
awareness leads to two types of 
companies emerging – one that knows 
it has been hacked and one that does 
not. if individual employees are not fully 
aware of how breaches occur and do 
not take steps to not only protect iP, but 
also monitor and alert managers about 
cyber issues, the door is continually left 
open for cyber-attacks.
what are some ways organisations 
can do this, and allow staff to work 
the way they want to while ensuring 
confidential data and competitive iP is 
safeguarded in the data centre? 
How can they promote a resilient 
and active security culture, while 
empowering staff with knowledge  
and education? 
Some of the steps that can be 
taken are listed here.
1. Embedding security into 
everyday operations 
Security needs to be integrated as 
part of the day-to-day business to 
ensure it stays front-of-mind and 
becomes ingrained in core business 
processes. it’s the ‘human firewall’ 
effect, whereby employees become 
integral to the security solutions 
rather than the problem.
Security policies should be 
developed collaboratively across the 
company ,  with input from as many 
stakeholders as possible playing an 
equal part. Regular training is also 
best approached on a collective 
basis and should be more than one 
standard session per year.
Some 
organisations 
take 
this approach one step further, 
developing fake phishing emails 
and distributing them to staff. This 
alerts iT teams to more susceptible 
employees, who will then be enrolled 
in additional training on how to spot 
a sophisticated scam.
employers have a duty to arm 
all employees with the necessary 
tools 
and 
training 
to 
protect 
their organisations. By preparing 
certifications, 
comprehensive 
curriculums 
and 
learning 
opportunities to develop employees 
and 
their 
security 
awareness, 
their ability to recognise and  
respond to potential attacks will  
be enhanced.

101
JULY 2017
2. Adopting a hearts and minds 
approach 
Taking it a step further, smart 
organisations should take a  more 
active role in engaging and uniting 
employees against breaches and 
security issues. Creating a culture 
of security advocates who are 
well-informed and compelled to 
protect the intellectual property 
of their employer, is vital to  
long-term protection. 
This can be enabled and 
promoted in various ways, including 
the use of fake phishing attempts 
or mock breaches to develop the 
security awareness of employees, 
and their ability to recognise 
potential attacks.
These mock attacks are a 
highly effective tool; firstly, as 
a test bed to gauge the level of 
vulnerability of your organisation. 
it is also as an interactive way 
of educating employees on best 
practices, safe behaviours and as a 
way of motivating team members.
This 
approach 
gives 
the 
individual more responsibility and 
accountability in preventing attacks.
3. Have a holistic view on security, 
across the network - securing 
data from the bottom up 
Crucially, any approach must be 
underpinned by the appropriate 
technology infrastructure to support 
and protect a modern, collaborative 
and mobile workforce. This ensures 
data is safe within the data centre. 
without 
this 
foundation, 
any 
‘security-minded’ company culture 
will have its vulnerabilities.
when 
surveyed, 
41% 
of 
respondents from the region stated 
that visibility into all business-
critical applications and systems 
was critical for a successful  
security framework. 
Core 
security 
pillars 
should 
include identity and access, network 
security, app security, data security, 
and monitoring and response. Any 
technology deployed to support your 
business’ security needs should 
provide you with a view across the 
organisation. From the network, 
apps and data, down to an employee 
level, to help ensure critical assets 
are secured. employees will be able 
to work productively from anywhere, 
without security being compromised. 
These solutions also deliver access 
from a centralised system, while 
addressing privacy, compliance, and 
risk management mandates.
As 
workforces 
become 
increasingly mobile and the spotlight on 
cybersecurity evolves further, it’s clear 
that robust infrastructure is only fully 
effective when supported by proactive, 
educated and breach-savvy staff.
in fact, a majority of the 
respondents (70%) to the Ponemon 
Global iT survey from the Asia Pacific 
region stated that it was time for a new 
security framework. These respondents 
also called for the number one goal of 
this new framework to be a unified 
view of users across the enterprise 
space (53%).
To ensure companies and their 
teams can work effectively and 
productively from anywhere, steps 
must be taken so staff are no longer 
considered a threat. This is very much 
within reach for all businesses and 
promises to be a key agenda item 
as cybersecurity continues to gain a 
presence on the international agenda 
and in our working lives.

POST-ULTIMATE VAULT 
HUNTER MODE

By Teh Wi-Liam
Tales From The Borderlands
honestly do not know how I missed this game. To be fair, I 
did miss out on all the hype Gearbox Software had to offer 
in terms of Borderlands, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands: 
The Pre-Sequel. Although I did manage to bring myself up to 
speed with Borderlands 2, I still somehow overlooked Tales 
from the Borderlands… until now. After trawling through the 
PS Store for a free game to play, I chanced upon it and have 
not looked back. I will try my best to keep this spoiler-free but 
on the off-chance you’ve already played this, you know the 
twist is real.
Keeping Things Comical
If you’ve ever played a Borderlands game, you would know 
Gearbox Software likes to keep its dialogue snappy and sappy, 
while throwing in something crude and downright disturbing 
or funny. Tales from the Borderlands is no different; it was 
not short on humour and witty remarks, while keeping the 
flow of the story going.
The game puts you in the control of Rhys: a Hyperion 
employee who is sick of his corporate job after getting duped 
out of a promotion and Fiona, a con artist on Pandora, a garbage 
land of sand and sadness. The story takes you between the 
past and the present where you will be telling two sides of the 
story from both Rhys’ and Fiona’s perspectives.
In the past, you will be re-telling the actions of your 
adventure through five episodes. At the same time, you will 
be jumping back to the present where Rhys and Fiona are 
captured by an anonymous abductor.
Throughout the episodes, you’ll make new friends, 
enemies and even have some enemies turn into friends and 
vice-versa. Tales from the Borderlands is a rollercoaster ride 
of emotions, much like its predecessor.
No Rest for the Wicked
A direct quote from Lilith – a Vault Hunter – from the ending of 
Borderlands 2, all five episodes of Tales from the Borderlands 
come with a unique title that somehow already tells you what 
the episode is all about; you just have to read between the 
lines. Also, if you jumped right over after completing both 
Borderlands and Borderlands 2, you will notice a lot of familiar 
faces like Mordecai, Brick and Scooter (there is one more 
character but for the sake of those who have yet to play, I’ll 
just keep it on the down low because it is a real shocker). 
Making a special appearance too is Butt Stallion, an NPC from 
Borderlands 2. You will get to interact with her in Tiny Tina’s 
Assault on Dragon Keep, a DLC for the game. This is a nod to 
the popular tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons.
I’m Here for the Easter Eggs!
One thing I absolutely love about Gearbox Software and its 
Borderlands series is its take on Easter Eggs and pop culture 
references. The amount of jokes and rehashes you’ll find in 
Borderlands 2 alone is ridiculous. What makes them even

all the interesting quirks both Telltale Games and Gearbox 
Software has to offer. Sadly, Fiona doesn’t offer any unique 
feature to her character other than being able to use a gun 
hidden in her right sleeve.
You’ll be Begging for More
Sadly, that is what I’m doing but as far as I know, neither 
Telltale Games nor Gearbox Software has said anything about 
a second season being renewed for Tales from the Borderlands. 
However, I am still holding out a sliver of hope that maybe, 
it 
might 
actually 
happen. 
Probably 
after Borderlands 3, 
I’m hoping. With all 
that’s said and done, 
this is one game that 
I highly recommend 
getting. And the best 
part, it’s completely 
free so the only thing 
you will be wasting 
is internal storage 
space on your PS4.

funnier and sometimes downright disturbing is that Gearbox 
Software does such a bad interpretation of the popular 
characters from various mediums and it knows about it, it 
probably just couldn’t be arsed as to why it doesn’t do them 
any justice, and rightly so!
Some popular Easter Eggs from Borderlands 2 include 
an optional boss named Rakk Man who’s hiding out in the 
Rakk Cave (you must know who I’m referring to by now) and 
even an absurdly misinterpreted rendition of Snow White and 
the Seven Dwarfs. To give it the Borderlands treatment, the 
optional mission calls for you to bring Laney White back but 
seven midgets – with names I will not mention for the sake of 
keeping this article clean – will not let her go so you will have 
to kill them. One of my favourite Easter Eggs would definitely 
be a quest called ‘Splinter Group’, which calls for you to deliver 
pizza down in the sewers to four ‘mutants’ who share names 
somewhat similar to famous painters.
With all that said, one such Easter Egg that I managed to 
discover from Tales from the Borderlands – which I then lost 
my shizzle for a good minute or so along with my sanity and 
childhood – was in Episode 5. Without going into much detail, 
all I can say is that you will never see the Power Rangers 
original TV series quite the same ever again.
Sticking to its Craft
One thing I must commend Telltale Games for its compelling 
storytelling. From The Walking Dead to The Wolf Among Us 
and especially Tales from the Borderlands, Telltale Games 
does a great job in keeping the pace of the story intact while 
still providing enough QTEs to keep you on your toes and not to 
be complacent (I have been victim to it more than once, which 
resulted in me dying and having to replay the entire chapter 
again). When you’re in control of Rhys and his trusty ECHO 
eye implant, you’re allowed to scan the room and read up on

s much as I am a huge fan of Sony and the PlayStation, I never actually owned a PS3, a 
PlayStation Portable (PSP) or even a PS Vita. To be frank, the only portable gaming device I ever 
owned was a Nintendo Gameboy and that’s only because it was the only portable console that 
could support Pokémon. With that said, I’ve never heard of Loco Roco seeing as it debuted on the PSP 
and has since been remastered for the PS4. Released just over a month ago, the remastered version 
of Loco Roco struck me as a colourful mini-game of sorts seeing as the file size took only 2GB of my 
internal storage. But, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t impressed with what I saw after.

there long enough to create a name for themselves that even 
the Moja Corps wants to attack them, they would already 
know the ins and outs of the puzzles like the back of their 
hands (if the characters had any).
Surely I Cannot be Liking This
As much as I hate to admit it, Loco Roco is a decent game 
with an easy-to-understand storyline. Sadly, the same 
can’t be said for most games these days as each storyline 
becomes more and more convoluted and layered to the point 
of exasperation and denial. Loco Roco is clearly not a game for 
anyone, especially if you’re already questioning your level of 
masculinity as the child-like usage of graphics along with an 
equally cringeworthy soundtrack.
However, 
if 
you’re looking for 
something that is 
somewhat 
easy 
without any chance 
of your controller 
spiralling towards 
the wall or TV in 
anger, Loco Roco 
could be the type 
of game you need 
to calm down. I 
know it sure helped 
me with its simple 
puzzles, which sort 
of gave my brain 
a reboot to how I 
view gaming. 
 
Is this Really a Game?
From a spectrum of colours to a somewhat addictive 
soundtrack, Loco Roco is not your typical PS4 game. Sure, at 
first glance you would think it was meant for children but there 
are a quite a few older gamers who are huge fans of the game.
The game starts you off with control over the entire 
planet, which is named Loco Roco.and you will be under attack 
by the evil Moja Corps (what makes you think conquering a 
planet named Loco Roco will make you sound like an evil 
villain is beyond me). A puzzle game at its core, the objective 
of Loco Roco is to guide its people to find others like them to 
form a huge blob as they merge together. 
Why am I Enjoying This?!
From the get-go, I was adamant about not enjoying this game 
since it looks like it was made for toddlers and children. Yes, I 
am guilty of prejudging before getting to understand the game. 
Ironically, Loco Roco did pose a greater challenge in terms of 
puzzle complexity as compared to other puzzle games. It also 
reminds me of the kind of platform games you can see in the 
arcade with children banging away on the controller while 
their parents are cheering them on or in the corner with their 
head in their hands, thinking where did it all go wrong.
With over 40 levels to play through, you must guide the 
Loco Roco to safety, all the while collecting other inhabitants 
of the planet through slippery slopes, staggering platforms 
and passages that come with its own set of puzzles for you to 
solve. The catch to Loco Roco is that you will not be controlling 
the different coloured blobs but rather, you’re in control of the 
entire planet so you will have to use the left and right analog 
stick to tilt your screen to save your inhabitants. Seeing as 
these… creatures – I’m not sure what to call them – are 
already on the planet and it’s safe to assume they’ve been

RELIVING 
A CLASSIC

Crazy Taxi Classic
hh Crazy Taxi, oh how my childhood lives and 
breathes this game. Way before I even knew what 
a cyber café was, arcades were my salvation. The 
tacky disco lights were the backdrop to the God-
awful combination of 90s jams and gunfire, screeching tyres 
and howling demons, a reminder that arcades at a time were 
considered the place to be and the place to be seen. Some 
had Resident Evil while others had Daytona and Initial D, but 
not me. My game, was Crazy Taxi. I always thought being 
a taxi driver was cool; I got to meet new and interesting 
people, the pay seemed okay (that was until I figured out 
why taxi drivers earned so much – by conning foreigners) 
and I got to drive for a living. But after giving Crazy Taxi a go 
when I was 10, I knew I was never cut out for it. After many 
moons have passed, I revisit my former flame to see if I still 
have what it takes to drive like a crazy taxi – pun intended – 
driver (or as we call them, taxi drivers).
A Trip Down Memory Lane
What was originally an arcade game turned into a full-blown 
multi-platform video game, Crazy Taxi was considered one of 
the greatest due to its sheer lack of a storyline and depth but 
made up for it with its… craziness (I had to). This open world 
racing game puts you in the hands of a taxi driver as you drive 
around the city looking for passengers to pick up. You get to

Aren’t there guidelines or rules that taxi drivers are supposed 
to dress appropriately?
Nostalgia Hits
From the crazy driving to the unruly passengers and downright 
insane AI-controlled traffic, the nostalgia of Crazy Taxi hit like 
a ton of bricks. If 
you ever played 
this game during 
your fun, carefree 
days where times 
were simpler, you 
would enjoy it out 
of pure nostalgia 
alone. Mind you, 
the game doesn’t

This brought back memories as I can still recall failing 
at Arcade Mode more times than I can count. This culminated 
in the realisation that I would stop spending my parents 
hard-earned cash to blow it all in one day at the arcade. Oh, 
how I just love lying to myself sometimes.
I’m Driving Over Here!
As the name states, you would have to be a crazy driver 
to meet the crazy demands of the passengers. You will be 
given no more than a minute at most to take them to their 
destinations, which varies depending on the colour of the 
passenger’s icon. If you make it to their destination on time, 
you will be paid along with extra tips if you perform crazy 
stunts for the passengers like near-misses and leaping over 
screaming pedestrians and other cars. What’s great about 
Crazy Taxi is the realism in the game, at which there is 
none. Which passenger in their right mind would encourage 
the driver to drive against the flow of traffic or even drive 
through a busy sidewalk no less (as much as I would enjoy 
that, it would mean that I am an accomplice to voluntary 
manslaughter and I quite like my life outside of prison).
However, if you fail to meet the passengers’ ‘timely’ 
requirements (I mean seriously, I had to drop a pregnant 
woman at the picnic grounds. And she was encouraging my 
ludicrous driving; that has to be unhealthy for the unborn 
child), they will insult you with a barrage of incoherent words 
and jump out of your taxi.
Remember when I mentioned about the realism of Crazy 
Taxi? Another aspect is the type of driver you get to choose, 
of which there are four. My personal favourite – I remember

A 
LOVE-HATE 
RELATIONSHIP

Dota 2 – Siltbreaker
ota 2 – the love of my life, the bane of my existence. 
The very reason why I have so few friends and a scarred 
history of broken monitors and peripherals. One of the 
ways Valve keeps the players coming back to Dota 2 is not 
only through its patch updates that helps to balance the game 
out (or make it worse), it’s also the seasonal offerings it brings 
to the game that sends the fans into a frenzy. From the humble 
Halloween ‘Diretide’ beginnings to the Christmas ‘Frostivus’ 
events and even the Chinese New Year ‘New Bloom’, Valve has 
always kept the game up-to-date on modern day happenings.
Take my Money, Gaben!
For only RM44, you can be the proud owner of this year’s The 
International 7 (TI7) Battle Pass, which is chock-full of goodies 
like aesthetic upgrades, rare chests and even Siltbreaker, 
Valve’s very own take on its first ever co-op campaign game. 
Siltbreaker comes in two Acts with Act 1 only recently being 
released and Act 2 is expected to be come out some time in 
July, right before The International.
Fair warning, this game mode may cause you to lose 
friends forever.
Where are my Healers?!
I took part in Act 1 dubbed ‘The Sands of Fate’ along with 
three other friends who are my usual party members when it’s 
game night (oh God, I sound like a real geek). The objective of 
Siltbreaker is to traverse the realm of Dark Reef and battle your 
way through waves of enemies and unexpected challenges. 
What the game doesn’t tell you is that keeping a cool head 
is required as my friends are known for being… how do I put

There is No I in Team
No truer words have ever been spoken and I stand by it; Siltbreaker 
is a lot harder than it looks and that is saying something. With 
Dota 2 constantly evolving and players are getting smarter and 
better by the day, it’s hard to keep up with the constant grind 
of making sure your mechanical skills are up to scratch while 
trying 
to 
enjoy 
Siltbreaker. Instead 
of coming up with 
an event that was 
supposed to be fun 
and carefree, Valve 
decides to make 
the game equally 
c h a l l e n g i n g , 
especially if you 
throw in imbeciles. 
Why, Gaben? Why 
do you torment us 
so and why do we 
let you?

GREAT
this delicately… retarded (am I even allowed to use that word 
now with all the #SocialJusticeWarriors around). To paint 
you a scenario, it took us a bit over an hour to complete the 
mission, which included the team having zero deaths (which 
obviously ended pretty badly).
Once you pass the first area known as ‘Howling Weald’ 
(which comes with its own side quest of completing in under 
nine minutes; we did it in 20), you will come to ‘Crossroads 
Garrison’ where your first boss fight awaits. What followed for 
the next hour was my friends and I constantly dying over and 
over because neither one of us decided to take a hero that had 
any real capabilities in the teamfight. Instead, we all had the 
shared mentality of going for glory, thus picking heroes like 
Sven, Drow Ranger and Abaddon (clearly, I’m talking about my 
idiotic friends).
Keeping a Cool Head
After falling to the boss in ‘Crossroads Garrison’, we had to 
take a 10-minute break to re-evaluate our life choices and 
why we decided to be friends in the first place. Once that was 
over, only then did we find out that you gain a respawn charge 
with every passed checkpoint. You can also keep a total of five 
respawn charges or be revived by your teammates. None of 
us clearly knew that as we were running around like headless 
chickens (and to think, I won a tournament with these people).
As you complete Act 1, you will receive a prize depending 
on how many quests you managed to complete. Each quest 
comes with a total of three stars and if you managed to gain 
three stars for all the quests (that would mean you cannot die, 
at all), you will receive Battle Pass points, which will then be 
added to your overall Battle Pass level. This will unlock even 
more items, which will make you want to play more.
It’s a vicious cycle.

JULY 2017
laying host to a large audience 
in the amphitheatre, Sony 
Interactive 
Entertainment 
(SIE) was easily one of 
the most eagerly anticipated press 
conferences of E3. It started out 
with the latest trailer of Uncharted: 
The Lost Legacy. It features the 
main characters Chloe Frazer from 
Uncharted 2 and Nadine Ross from 
Uncharted 4, venturing through the 
vast lands of India and the world over, 
in search of the Tusk of Ganesha. The 
Lost Legacy is slated for release on  
22 August 2017.
Building on the worldwide success 
of Horizon Zero Dawn, SIE showcased 
a new DLC that will be made available 
later this year dubbed ‘The Frozen 
Wilds’. It features snowy alps, an all-
new terrain and even new animatronic 
dinosaurs to battle.
Just when you think the hype isn’t 
enough, SIE also threw in the official 
Shadow of Colossus remake trailer, 
complete with modern-day graphical 
advancements 
and 
mechanics. 
Although scheduled for an early 2018 
release, Shadow of Colossus will have 
 IP sequels galore from Sony

Marvel was also on hand to 
showcase two new games that 
will be made available on the PS4  
– Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite as 
well as Marvel: Spider-Man. While 
Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite will be 
released on 17th September 2017 
with the help of Unreal Engine 4. 
Marvel: Spider-Man is currently 
being developed by Insomiac Games 
and will be released in 2018 with no 
confirmed date as yet.
Meanwhile, God of War will be 
the eighth instalment to the series 
while also serving as the sequel 
2010’s God of War III. This time, 
Kratos will be heading away from 
Greek mythology and moving towards 
Norse mythology along with his son 
Atreus. God of War will be released 
in early 2018 according to Sony.
Other games to make an 
appearance 
during 
SIE’s 
press 
conference include Call of Duty: 
World War II featuring the Allied 
forces in an epic gunfire with the 
Nazis; Destiny 2 had a new trailer 
that featured a monologue from the 
main antagonist, Dominus Ghaul; and 
Detroit: Become Human was also 
featured with the idea of a neo-noir 
thriller game. Zombie apocalypse is 
also a hot topic with Days Gone, while 
Monster Hunter World will be making 
a return.
In true SIE fashion, the showcase 
also featured heavily on virtual reality 
(VR) as we see Final Fantasy XV getting 
a PSVR game titled ‘Monsters of the 
Deep’, which is essentially a fishing 
game. Other PSVR games include 
Skyrim (big surprise), a military first-
person shooter game called Bravo 
Team, a psychological thriller known as 
Inpatient and Star Child, which didn’t 
really have much to go on except that 
it was excessively colourful.

o say Ubisoft didn’t disappoint 
at E3 was an understatement, 
as it brought back one of its 
most popular game titles ever 
– Beyond Good & Evil 2. Sadly, it will 
not be ready by this year or the next 
as it is currently being developed from 
scratch. The ride didn’t stop there as it 
also introduced another showstopper: 
Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. 
However, it is made exclusively for the 
Nintendo Switch so current owners can 
look out for this come 29 August 2017.

Bones was a noteworthy takeaway 
from Ubisoft’s press conference as 
it showed all the aspects of piracy

Assassin’s Creed lore.
Ubisoft also showcased the  virtual 
reality (VR) game of Transference, which 
also has Frodo Baggins Elijah Woods as 
the Creative Director. South Park also 
gets a sequel to its widely popular RPG 
game – South Park: The Stick of Truth 
with a sequel titled ‘The Fractured but

in October 2017.

where Switch users play with other 
players from different platforms.
Mario makes yet another appearance

Clarity Like Never Before
Samsung QLED TV  
Quantum Dot Technology
Just when you thought Samsung couldn’t get any 
more popular after the release of its Galaxy S8 and 
S8+ smartphones, it goes ahead and introduces 
its QLED TVs in a spectacular fashion. Being the 
first in the industry to feature quantum dot (QD) 
technology into TVs, Samsung is paving the way 
by constantly innovating our lives with its devices.
Super Slim Bezels
Encased in a metallic body, the Q8C features a 
65 inch QLED 4K Ultra HD display paired with a 
borderless design. Watching movies is a must as 
you will now have nothing in the way of the screen. 
Not to mention its sleek, metallic design can blend 
into any modern household with ease - giving an 
added touch of class and elegance.
Brighter Than Ever
QD technology encompasses very small semiconductor particles that are only nanometres in size. It is 
capable of emitting light of specific frequencies if electricity or light is applied to them. In Samsung’s 
case, its QD technology helps to create an even brighter TV without causing friction with the colour 
and contrast.
Dark as Night
Thanks to HDR, it provides great colour contrast to the Q8C, allowing you to spot even the darkest of 
objects in a black background setting. The Q8C comes with a wide-viewing-angle without compromising 
on its colour consistency. Most TVs lose out on colour and contrast when viewed from a side angle. The 
Q8C provides the same consistency, no matter where you’re watching it from.

Sleek Lines
The 
Panasonic 
Aero 
Series 
Air-Conditioner 
features a very sleek and modern look which 
will sit nicely in any room in your house. The 
pearl finish meanwhile gives the Aero Series a 
luxurious look. What makes this Air-Conditioner 
special are its flexible twin flaps that can direct 
and concentrate cool air better than competitors 
in the market. 
Better Cooling Performance
The twin flaps directs the cooler air upwards 
to indirectly cool the room without drying out 
the skin. With this mode, the air-conditioner will 
switch from a direct-cooling mode (which directs 
the cool air straight to the room) to a shower 
cooling mode. This mode is gentler on the skin 
and also cools the room better.
Halting Contaminants 
Thanks to the nanoe-G Air Purification system, 
filtering out particulate matters is a piece of cake. Up to 99% of PM2.5 particulate matter will be 
filtered out with the nanoe-G filter. PM2.5 consists of extremely small particles, measuring less 
than 2.5 micrometres. These particulate matters are said to pose health problems as they are fine 
enough to enter your lungs.
Energy Saving Inverter
By using an inverter unit, the Panasonic Aero Series Air-Conditioner will prevent wasteful energy 
consumption by varying the compressor operations to maintain the temperature. Even at full power, 
the energy usage of an inverter unit will be much lower than a non-inverter unit. At the same time, 
the cooling performance of an inverter unit is 1.5-times faster than a non-inverter unit.

1.   Decide on what will the TV be 
used for. Depending on the usage, 
there are different technologies to

screen

between them and the TV, we 
would recommend several options. 
If the distance is substantial, we 
would recommend a larger sized 
TV. If the distance is small, we would 
recommend a curved TV 
5.   We do recommend users 
to 
supplement 
their 
viewing 
experience 
with 
an 
external 
sound 
system. 
Depending 
on 
the preference of the customer, 
we would either recommend a 
soundbar or a full theatre system
6.   For customers who love movies 
and has a dedicated room/corner 
for their TV, we would recommend 
an OLED-based TV as the colour 
reproduction is far greater than the 
average TV
7.   Otherwise we would recommend 
Samsung’s QLED TV as it gives 
better colour for brightly-lit rooms
8.   4K is a must right now; the 
difference between a Full HD TV 
and a 4K TV is only a few hundred 
ringgit. It is also a futureproof step 
as more content are being released 
in 4K resolution
9.   To complete the TV experience, 
pair the TV with a BluRay player 
to watch HD content. We also 
recommend 
a 
lightning 
surge 
protector power strip to safeguard 
your TV investment from accidental 
electrical discharges from storms or 
the power line. Lastly, a wall bracket 
will complete the set if the users do 
not want to use a TV stand in their 
living room
