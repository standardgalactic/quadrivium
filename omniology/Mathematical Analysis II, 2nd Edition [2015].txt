Preface
The purpose of this textbook is to present an array of topics that are found in
the syllabus of the typical second lecture course in Calculus, as oﬀered in many
universities. Conceptually, it follows our previous book Mathematical Analysis I,
published by Springer, which will be referred to throughout as Vol. I.
While the subject matter known as ‘Calculus 1’ concerns real functions of real
variables, and as such is more or less standard, the choices for a course on ‘Calculus
2’ can vary a lot, and even the way the topics can be taught is not so rigid. Due
to this larger ﬂexibility we tried to cover a wide range of subjects, reﬂected in
the fact that the amount of content gathered here may not be comparable to the
number of credits conferred to a second Calculus course by the current programme
speciﬁcations. The reminders disseminated in the text render the sections more
independent from one another, allowing the reader to jump back and forth, and
thus enhancing the book’s versatility.
The succession of chapters is what we believe to be the most natural. With
the ﬁrst three chapters we conclude the study of one-variable functions, begun in
Vol. I, by discussing sequences and series of functions, including power series and
Fourier series. Then we pass to examine multivariable and vector-valued functions,
investigating continuity properties and developing the corresponding integral and
diﬀerential calculus (over open measurable sets of Rn ﬁrst, then on curves and
surfaces). In the ﬁnal part of the book we apply some of the theory learnt to the
study of systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations.
Continuing along the same strand of thought of Vol. I, we wanted the present-
ation to be as clear and comprehensible as possible. Every page of the book con-
centrates on very few essential notions, most of the time just one, in order to
keep the reader focused. For theorems’ statements, we chose the form that hastens
an immediate understanding and guarantees readability at the same time. Hence,
they are as a rule followed by several examples and pictures; the same is true for
the techniques of computation.
The large number of exercises, gathered according to the main topics at the
end of each chapter, should help the student test his improvements. We provide
the solution to all exercises, and very often the procedure for solving is outlined.

Preface
Some graphical conventions are adopted: deﬁnitions are displayed over grey
backgrounds, while statements appear on blue; examples are marked with a blue
vertical bar at the side; exercises with solutions are boxed (e.g., 12. ).
This second edition is enriched by two appendices, devoted to diﬀerential and
integral calculus, respectively. Therein, the interested reader may ﬁnd the rigorous
explanation of many results that are merely stated without proof in the previous
chapters, together with useful additional material. We completely omitted the
proofs whose technical aspects prevail over the fundamental notions and ideas.
These may be found in other, more detailed, texts, some of which are explicitly
suggested to deepen relevant topics.
All ﬁgures were created with MATLABTM and edited using the freely-available
package psfrag.
This volume originates from a textbook written in Italian, itself an expanded
version of the lecture courses on Calculus we have taught over the years at the
Politecnico di Torino. We owe much to many authors who wrote books on the
subject: A. Bacciotti and F. Ricci, C. Pagani and S. Salsa, G. Gilardi to name a
few. We have also found enduring inspiration in the Anglo-Saxon-ﬂavoured books
by T. Apostol and J. Stewart.
Special thanks are due to Dr. Simon Chiossi, for the careful and eﬀective work
of translation.
Finally, we wish to thank Francesca Bonadei – Executive Editor, Mathem-
atics and Statistics, Springer Italia – for her encouragement and support in the
preparation of this textbook.

Numerical series
This is the ﬁrst of three chapters dedicated to series. A series formalises the idea of
adding inﬁnitely many terms of a sequence which can involve numbers (numerical
series) or functions (series of functions). Using series we can represent an irrational
number by the sum of an inﬁnite sequence of increasingly smaller rational numbers,
for instance, or a continuous map by a sum of inﬁnitely many piecewise-constant
functions deﬁned over intervals of decreasing size. Since the deﬁnition itself of
series relies on the notion of limit of a sequence, the study of a series’ behaviour
requires all the instruments used for such limits.
In this chapter we will consider numerical series: beside their unquestionable
theoretical importance, they serve as a warm-up for the ensuing study of series
of functions. We begin by recalling their main properties. Subsequently we will
consider the various types of convergence conditions of a numerical sequence and
identify important classes of series, to study which the appropriate tools will be
provided.
1.1 Round-up on sequences
We brieﬂy recall here the deﬁnition and main properties of sequences, whose full
treatise is present in Vol. I.
A real sequence is a function from N to R whose domain contains a set
{n ∈N
:
n ≥n0} for some integer n0 ≥0. If one calls a the sequence, it is
common practice to denote the image of n by an instead of a(n); in other words
we will write a : n →an. A standardised way to indicate a sequence is {an}n≥n0
(ignoring the terms with n < n0), or even more concisely {an}.
The behaviour of a sequence as n tends to ∞can be classiﬁed as follows. The
sequence {an}n≥n0 converges (to ℓ) if the limit lim
n→∞an = ℓexists and is ﬁnite.
When the limit exists but is inﬁnite, the sequence is said to diverge to +∞or
−∞. If the sequence is neither convergent nor divergent, i.e., if lim
n→∞an does not
exist, the sequence is indeterminate.

1 Numerical series
The fact that the behaviour of the ﬁrst terms is completely irrelevant justiﬁes
the following deﬁnition. A sequence {an}n≥n0 satisﬁes a certain property even-
tually, if there is an integer N ≥n0 such that the sequence {an}n≥N satisﬁes the
property.
The main theorems governing the limit behaviour of sequences are recalled
below.
Theorems on sequences
1. Uniqueness of the limit: if the limit of a sequence exists, it is unique.
2. Boundedness: a converging sequence is bounded.
3. Existence of the limit for monotone sequences: an eventually-monotone
sequence is convergent if bounded, divergent if unbounded (divergent to
+∞if increasing, to −∞if decreasing).
4. First Comparison Theorem: let {an}, {bn} be sequences with ﬁnite or
inﬁnite limits lim
n→∞an = ℓand lim
n→∞bn = m. If an ≤bn eventually, then
ℓ≤m.
5a. Second Comparison Theorem - ﬁnite case: let {an}, {bn} and {cn} be
sequences with lim
n→∞an = lim
n→∞cn = ℓ∈R. If an ≤bn ≤cn eventually,
then lim
n→∞bn = ℓ.
5b. Second Comparison Theorem - inﬁnite case: let {an}, {bn} be sequences
such that lim
n→∞an = +∞. If an ≤bn eventually, then lim
n→∞bn = +∞. A
similar result holds if the limit is −∞: lim
n→∞bn = −∞implies lim
n→∞an =
−∞.
6. Property: a sequence {an} is inﬁnitesimal, that is lim
n→∞an = 0, if and only
if the sequence of absolute values {|an|} is inﬁnitesimal.
7. Theorem: if {an} is inﬁnitesimal and {bn} bounded, {anbn} is inﬁnitesimal.
8. Algebra of limits: let {an}, {bn} be such that lim
n→∞an = ℓand lim
n→∞bn = m
(ℓ, m ﬁnite or inﬁnite). Then
lim
n→∞(an ± bn) = ℓ± m ,
lim
n→∞an bn = ℓm ,
lim
n→∞
an
bn
= ℓ
m,
if bn ̸= 0 eventually,
whenever the right-hand sides are deﬁned.
9. Substitution Theorem: let {an} be a sequence with lim
n→∞an = ℓand sup-
pose g is a function deﬁned on a neighbourhood of ℓ:
a) if ℓ∈R and g is continuous at ℓ, then lim
n→∞g(an) = g(ℓ);
b) if ℓ/∈R and lim
x→ℓg(x) = m exists, then lim
n→∞g(an) = m.

1.1 Round-up on sequences

10. Ratio Test: let {an} be a sequence for which an > 0 eventually, and suppose
the limit
lim
n→∞
an+1
an
= q
exists, ﬁnite or inﬁnite. If q < 1 then lim
n→∞an = 0; if q > 1 then lim
n→∞an =
+∞.
Let us review some cases of particular relevance.
Examples 1.1
i) Consider the geometric sequence an = qn, where q is a ﬁxed number in R. In
Vol. I, Example 5.18, we proved
lim
n→∞qn =
⎧
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎩
0
if |q| < 1,
1
if q = 1,
+∞
if q > 1,
does not exist
if q ≤−1.
(1.1)
ii) Let p > 0 be a given number and consider the sequence
n√p. Using the
Substitution Theorem with g(x) = px we have
lim
n→∞
n√p = lim
n→∞p1/n = p0 = 1 .
iii) Consider now
n√n; again using the Substitution Theorem,
lim
n→∞
n√n = lim
n→∞exp log n
n
= e0 = 1.
iv) The number e may be deﬁned as the limit of the sequence an =

1 + 1
n
n
,
which converges since it is strictly increasing and bounded from above.
v) At last, look at the sequences, all tending to +∞,
log n , nα , qn , n! , nn
(α > 0, q > 1) .
In Vol. I, Sect. 5.4, we proved that each of these is inﬁnite of order bigger than
the preceding one. This means that for n →∞, with α > 0 and q > 1, we have
log n = o(nα) ,
nα = o(qn) ,
qn = o(n!) ,
n! = o(nn) .

1.2 Numerical series
To introduce the notion of numerical series, i.e., of “sum of inﬁnitely many num-
bers”, we examine a simple yet instructive situation borrowed from geometry.
Consider a segment of length ℓ= 2 (Fig. 1.1). The middle point splits it into two
parts of length a0 = ℓ/2 = 1. While keeping the left half ﬁxed, we subdivide the
right one in two parts of length a1 = ℓ/4 = 1/2. Iterating the process indeﬁnitely
one can think of the initial segment as the union of inﬁnitely many segments of
lengths 1, 1
2, 1
4, 1
8,
1
16, . . . Correspondingly, the total length of the starting segment
can be thought of as sum of the lengths of all sub-segments, in other words
2 = 1 + 1
2 + 1
4 + 1
8 + 1
16 + . . .
(1.2)
On the right we have a sum of inﬁnitely many terms. This inﬁnite sum can be
deﬁned properly using sequences, and leads to the notion of a numerical series.
Given the sequence {ak}k≥0, one constructs the so-called sequence of partial
sums {sn}n≥0 in the following manner:
s0 = a0 ,
s1 = a0 + a1 ,
s2 = a0 + a1 + a2,
and in general,
sn = a0 + a1 + . . . + an =
n

k=0
ak .
Note that sn = sn−1 + an. Then it is natural to study the limit behaviour of such
a sequence. Let us (formally) deﬁne
∞

k=0
ak = lim
n→∞
n

k=0
ak = lim
n→∞sn .
The symbol
∞

k=0
ak is called (numerical) series, and ak is the general term of
the series.

1.2 Numerical series

Deﬁnition 1.2 Given the sequence {ak}k≥0 and sn =
n

k=0
ak, consider the
limit lim
n→∞sn.
i) If the limit exists (ﬁnite or inﬁnite), its value s is called sum of the
series and one writes
∞

k=0
ak = s = lim
n→∞sn .
-
If s is ﬁnite, one says that the series
∞

k=0
ak converges.
-
If s is inﬁnite, the series
∞

k=0
ak diverges, to either +∞or −∞.
ii) If the limit does not exist, the series
∞

k=0
ak is indeterminate.
Examples 1.3
i) Let us go back to the interval split inﬁnitely many times. The length of the
shortest segment obtained after k + 1 subdivisions is ak =
1
2k , k ≥0. Thus, we
consider the series
∞

k=0
1
2k . Its partial sums read
s0 = 1 ,
s1 = 1 + 1
2 = 3
2 ,
s2 = 1 + 1
2 + 1
4 = 7
4 ,
...
sn = 1 + 1
2 + . . . + 1
2n .
Using the fact that an+1 −bn+1 = (a −b)(an + an−1b + . . . + abn−1 + bn), and
choosing a = 1 and b = x arbitrary but diﬀerent from one, we obtain the identity
1 + x + . . . + xn = 1 −xn+1
1 −x
.
(1.3)
Therefore
sn = 1 + 1
2 + . . . + 1
2n = 1 −
1
2n+1
1 −1
2
= 2
	
1 −
1
2n+1

= 2 −1
2n ,
and so
lim
n→∞sn = lim
n→∞
	
2 −1
2n

= 2 .
The series converges and its sum is 2, which eventually justiﬁes formula (1.2).

6
1 Numerical series
ii) The partial sums of the series
∞

k=0
(−1)k satisfy
s0 = 1 ,
s1 = 1 −1 = 0 ,
s2 = s1 + 1 = 1 ,
s3 = s2 −1 = 0 ,
...
s2n = 1 ,
s2n+1 = 0 .
The terms with even index are all equal to 1, whereas the odd ones are 0.
Therefore lim
n→∞sn cannot exist and the series is indeterminate.
iii) The two previous examples are special cases of the following series, called
geometric series,
∞

k=0
qk ,
where q is a ﬁxed number in R. The geometric series is particularly important.
If q = 1, then sn = a0 +a1+. . .+an = 1+1+. . .+1 = n+1 and lim
n→∞sn = +∞.
Hence the series diverges to +∞.
If q ̸= 1 instead, (1.3) implies
sn = 1 + q + q2 + . . . + qn = 1 −qn+1
1 −q
.
Recalling Example 1.1 i), we obtain
lim
n→∞sn = lim
n→∞
1 −qn+1
1 −q

⎨
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎩

if q ≤−1 .

Sometimes the sequence {ak} is only deﬁned for k ≥k0: Deﬁnition 1.2 then
modiﬁes in the obvious way. Moreover, the following fact holds, whose easy proof
is left to the reader.
Property 1.4 A series’ behaviour does not change by adding, modifying or
eliminating a ﬁnite number of terms.

1.2 Numerical series
7
Note that this property, in case of convergence, is saying nothing about the
sum of the series, which generally changes when the series is altered. For instance,
∞

k=1
1
2k =
∞

k=0
1
2k −1 = 2 −1 = 1 .
Examples 1.5
i) The series
∞

k=2
1
(k −1)k is called series of Mengoli. As
ak =
1
(k −1)k =
1
k −1 −1
k,
it follows that
s2 = a2 =
1
1 · 2 = 1 −1
2
s3 = a2 + a3 =
	
1 −1
2

+
	1
2 −1

= 1 −1
3,
and in general
sn = a2 + a3 + . . . + an =
	
1 −1
2

+
	1
2 −1
3

+ . . . +
	
1
n −1 −1
n

=1 −1
n .
Thus
lim
n→∞sn = lim
n→∞
	
1 −1
n

= 1
and the series converges to 1.
ii) For the series
∞

k=1
log

1 + 1
k

we have
ak = log

1 + 1
k

= log k + 1
k
= log(k + 1) −log k ,
so
s1 = log 2 ,
s2 = log 2 + (log 3 −log 2) = log 3 ,
...
sn = log 2 + (log 3 −log 2) + . . . +

log(n + 1) −log n

= log(n + 1) .
Hence
lim
n→∞sn = lim
n→∞log(n + 1) = +∞
and the series diverges (to +∞).
2
The two instances just considered belong to the larger class of telescopic
series. These are deﬁned by ak = bk+1 −bk for a suitable sequence {bk}k≥k0.

8
1 Numerical series
Since sn = bn+1 −bk0, the behaviour of a telescopic series is the same as that of
the sequence {bk}.
There is a simple yet useful necessary condition for a numerical series to con-
verge.
Property 1.6 Let
∞

k=0
ak be a converging series. Then
lim
k→∞ak = 0 .
(1.4)
Proof.
Let s = lim
n→∞sn. Since ak = sk −sk−1,
lim
k→∞ak = lim
k→∞(sk −sk−1) = s −s = 0 .
2
Observe that condition (1.4) is not suﬃcient to guarantee convergence. The
general term of a series may tend to 0 without the series having to converge.
For example we saw that
∞

k=1
log

1 + 1
k

diverges (Example 1.5 ii)), while the
continuity of the logarithm implies that lim
k→∞log

1 + 1
k

= 0.
Example 1.7
It is easy to see that
∞

k=1

1−1
k
k
does not converge, because the general term
ak =

1 −1
k
k
tends to e−1 ̸= 0.
2
If a series
∞

k=0
ak converges to s, the quantity
rn = s −sn =
∞

k=n+1
ak
is called nth remainder.
Now comes another necessary condition for convergence.
Property 1.8 Let
∞

k=0
ak be a convergent series. Then
lim
n→∞rn = 0 .
Proof.
Just note lim
n→∞rn = lim
n→∞(s −sn) = s −s = 0 .
2

1.3 Series with positive terms
9
It is not always possible to predict the behaviour of a series
∞

k=0
ak using merely
the deﬁnition. It may well happen that the sequence of partial sums cannot be com-
puted explicitly, so it becomes important to have other ways to establish whether
the series converges or not. In case of convergence it could also be necessary to
determine the actual sum explicitly. This may require using more sophisticated
techniques, which go beyond the scopes of this text.
1.3 Series with positive terms
We deal with series
∞

k=0
ak for which ak ≥0 for any k ∈N.
Proposition 1.9 A series
∞

k=0
ak with positive terms either converges or di-
verges to +∞.
Proof.
The sequence sn is monotonically increasing since
sn+1 = sn + an+1 ≥sn ,
∀n ≥0 .
It is then suﬃcient to use Theorem 3 on p. 2 to conclude that lim
n→∞sn
exists, and is either ﬁnite or +∞.
2
We list a few tools for studying the convergence of positive-term series.
Theorem 1.10 (Comparison Test) Let
∞

k=0
ak and
∞

k=0
bk be positive-term
series such that 0 ≤ak ≤bk, for any k ≥0.
i) If
∞

k=0
bk converges, also
∞

k=0
ak converges and
∞

k=0
ak ≤
∞

k=0
bk .
ii) If
∞

k=0
ak diverges, then
∞

k=0
bk diverges as well.

10
1 Numerical series
Proof.
i) Denote by {sn} and {tn} the sequences of partial sums of
∞

k=0
ak,
∞

k=0
bk
respectively. Since ak ≤bk for all k,
sn ≤tn ,
∀n ≥0 .
By assumption, the series
∞

k=0
bk converges, so lim
n→∞tn = t ∈R. Propos-
ition 1.9 implies that lim
n→∞sn = s exists, ﬁnite or inﬁnite. By the First
Comparison Theorem (Theorem 4, p. 2) we have
s = lim
n→∞sn ≤lim
n→∞tn = t ∈R .
Therefore s ∈R, and the series
∞

k=0
ak converges. Furthermore s ≤t.
ii) By contradiction, if
∞

k=0
bk converged, part i) would force
∞

k=0
ak to
converge too.
2
Examples 1.11
i) Consider
∞

k=1
1
k2 . As
1
k2 <
1
(k −1)k ,
∀k ≥2 ,
and the series of Mengoli
∞

k=2
1
(k −1)k converges (Example 1.5 i)), we conclude
that the given series converges to a sum ≤2. One can prove the sum is precisely
π2
6 (see Example 3.18).
ii) The series
∞

k=1
1
k is known as harmonic series. Since log(1+x) ≤x , ∀x > −1 ,
(Vol. I, Ch. 6, Exercise 12), it follows
log

1 + 1
k

≤1
k ,
∀k ≥1 ;
but since
∞

k=1
log

1 + 1
k

diverges (Example 1.5 ii)), we conclude that the har-
monic series diverges.

the Comparison Test tells us the generalised harmonic series diverges for 0 < α <
1 and converges for α > 2. The case 1 < α < 2 will be examined in Example 1.19.
2
Here is a useful criterion that generalises the Comparison Test.
Theorem 1.12 (Asymptotic Comparison Test) Let
∞

k=0
ak and
∞

k=0
bk be
positive-term series and suppose the sequences {ak}k≥0 and {bk}k≥0 have the
same order of magnitude for k →∞. Then the series have the same behaviour.
Proof.
Having the same order of magnitude for k →∞is equivalent to
lim
k→∞
ak
bk
= ℓ∈R \ {0} .
Therefore the sequences
ak
bk

k≥0
and
 bk
ak

k≥0
are both convergent,
hence both bounded (Theorem 2, p. 2). There must exist constants
M1, M2 > 0 such that

ak
bk
 ≤M1
and

bk
ak
 ≤M2
for any k > 0, i.e.,
|ak| ≤M1|bk|
and
|bk| ≤M2|ak| .
Now it suﬃces to use Theorem 1.10 to ﬁnish the proof.
2
Examples 1.13
i) Consider
∞

k=0
ak =


k=0
k + 3
2k2 + 5 and let bk = 1
k . Then
lim
k→∞
ak
bk
= 1
2
and the given series behaves as the harmonic series, hence diverges.
ii) Take the series
∞

k=1
ak =
∞

k=1
sin 1
k2 . As sin 1
k2 ∼1
k2 for k →∞, the series has
the same behaviour of
∞

k=1
1
k2 , so it converges.

1 Numerical series
Eventually, here are two results – of algebraic ﬂavour and often easy to employ –
which prescribe suﬃcient conditions for a series to converge or diverge.
Theorem 1.14 (Ratio Test)
Let the series
∞

k=0
ak have ak > 0, ∀k ≥0.
Assume the limit
lim
k→∞
ak+1
ak
= ℓ
exists, ﬁnite or inﬁnite. If ℓ< 1 the series converges; if ℓ> 1 it diverges.
Proof.
First, suppose ℓﬁnite. By deﬁnition of limit we know that for any ε > 0,
there is an integer kε ≥0 such that
∀k > kε
⇒

ak+1
ak
−ℓ
 < ε
i.e.,
ℓ−ε < ak+1
ak
< ℓ+ ε .
Assume ℓ< 1. Choose ε = 1−ℓ
2
and set q = 1+ℓ
2 , so
0 < ak+1
ak
< ℓ+ ε = q ,
∀k > kε .
Repeating the argument we obtain
ak+1 < qak < q2ak−1 < . . . < qk−kεakε+1
hence
ak+1 < akε+1
qkε qk ,
∀k > kε .
The claim follows by Theorem 1.10 and from the fact that the geometric
series, with q < 1, converges (Example 1.3).
Now consider ℓ> 1. Choose ε = ℓ−1, and notice
1 = ℓ−ε < ak+1
ak
,
∀k > kε .
Thus ak+1 > ak > . . . > akε+1 > 0, so the necessary condition for conver-
gence fails, for lim
k→∞ak ̸= 0.
Eventually, if ℓ= +∞, we put A = 1 in the condition of limit, and there
exists kA ≥0 with ak > 1, for any k > kA. Once again the necessary
condition to have convergence does not hold.
2
Theorem 1.15 (Root Test) Given a series
∞

k=0
ak with ak ≥0, ∀k ≥0,
suppose
lim
k→∞
k√ak = ℓ
exists, ﬁnite or inﬁnite. If ℓ< 1 the series converges, if ℓ> 1 it diverges.
Proof.
This proof is essentially identical to the previous one, so we leave it to the
reader.
2

1.3 Series with positive terms
13
Examples 1.16
i) For
∞

k=0
k
3k we have ak = k
3k and ak+1 = k + 1
3k+1 , therefore
lim
k→∞
ak+1
ak
= lim
k→∞
1
3
k + 1
k
= 1
3 < 1 .
The given series converges by the Ratio Test 1.14.
ii) The series
∞

k=1
1
kk has
lim
k→∞
k√ak = lim
k→∞
1
k = 0 < 1 .
The Root Test 1.15 ensures that the series converges.
2
We remark that the Ratio and Root Tests do not allow to conclude anything
if ℓ= 1. For example,
∞

k=1
1
k diverges and
∞

k=1
1
k2 converges, yet they both satisfy
Theorems 1.14 and 1.15 with ℓ= 1.
In certain situations it may be useful to think of the general term ak as the value
at x = k of a function f deﬁned on the half-line [k0, +∞). Under the appropriate
assumptions, we can relate the behaviour of the series to that of the integral of f
over [k0, +∞). In fact,
Theorem 1.17 (Integral Test) Let f be continuous, positive and decreasing
on [k0, +∞), for k0 ∈N. Then
∞

k=k0+1
f(k) ≤
 +∞
k0
f(x) dx ≤
∞

k=k0
f(k) .
(1.6)
Therefore the integral and the series share the same behaviour:
a)
 +∞
k0
f(x) dx converges
⇐⇒
∞

k=k0
f(k) converges;
b)
 +∞
k0
f(x) dx diverges
⇐⇒
∞

k=k0
f(k) diverges.
Proof.
Since f decreases, for any k ≥k0 we have
f(k + 1) ≤f(x) ≤f(k) ,
∀x ∈[k, k + 1] ,
and as the integral is monotone,
f(k + 1) ≤
 k+1
k
f(x) dx ≤f(k) .

14
1 Numerical series
Then for all n ∈N with n > k0 we obtain
n+1

k=k0+1
f(k) ≤
 n+1
k0
f(x) dx ≤
n

k=k0
f(k)
(after re-indexing the ﬁrst series). Passing to the limit for n →+∞and
recalling f is positive and continuous, we conclude.
2
From inequalities (1.6) it follows easily that
 +∞
k0
f(x) dx ≤
∞

k=k0
f(k) ≤f(k0) +
 +∞
k0
f(x) dx .
Comparing with the improper integral of f allows to estimate, often accurately,
the remainder and the sum of the series, and use this to estimate numerically these
values:
Property 1.18 Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.17, if
∞

k=k0
f(k)
converges then for all n ≥k0
 +∞
n+1
f(x) dx ≤rn ≤
 +∞
n
f(x) dx ,
(1.7)
and
sn +
 +∞
n+1
f(x) dx ≤s ≤sn +
 +∞
n
f(x) dx .
(1.8)
Proof.
If
∞

k=k0
f(k) converges, (1.6) can we re-written substituting k0 with any
integer n ≥k0. Using the ﬁrst inequality,
rn = s −sn =
∞

k=n+1
f(k) ≤
 +∞
n
f(x) dx ,
while changing k0 to n + 1 in the second one yields
 +∞
n+1
f(x) dx ≤rn .
This gives formula (1.7), from which (1.8) follows by adding sn to each
side.
2

1.3 Series with positive terms
15
Examples 1.19
i) The Integral Test is used to study the generalised harmonic series (1.5) for all
admissible values of the parameter α. Note in fact that the function 1
xα , α > 0,
fulﬁlls the hypotheses and its integral over [1, +∞) converges if and only if α > 1.
In conclusion,
∞

k=1
1
kα
 converges if α > 1 ,
diverges if 0 < α ≤1 .
ii) In order to study
∞

k=2
1
k log k
we take the map f(x) =
1
x log x; its integral over [2, +∞) diverges, since
 +∞
2
1
x log x dx =
 +∞
log 2
1
t dt = +∞.
Consequently, the series
∞

k=2
1
k log k is divergent.
iii) Suppose we want to estimate the precision of the sum of
∞

k=1
1
k3 computed
up to the ﬁrst 10 terms.
We need to calculate
 +∞
n
f(x) dx with f(x) = 1

 +∞

x3 dx =

By (1.7) we obtain
r10 = s −s10 ≤

and
r10 ≥
 +∞

x3 dx =

2 (11)2 = 0.004132 . . .
The sum may be estimated with the help of (1.8):
s10 +

2 (10)2 .
Since
s10 = 1 + 1
23 + . . . +

we ﬁnd 1.201664 ≤s ≤1.202532 . The exact value for s is 1.202057 . . .

1.4 Alternating series
These are series of the form
∞

k=0
(−1)kbk
with
bk > 0 ,
∀k ≥0.
For them the following result due to Leibniz holds.
Theorem 1.20 (Leibniz’s
Alternating
Series
Test) An alternating
series
∞

k=0
(−1)kbk converges if the following conditions hold
i)
lim
k→∞bk = 0 ;
ii) the sequence {bk}k≥0 decreases monotonically .
Denoting by s its sum, for all n ≥0 one has
|rn| = |s −sn| ≤bn+1
and
s2n+1 ≤s ≤s2n .
Proof.
As {bk}k≥0 is a decreasing sequence,
s2n = s2n−2 −b2n−1 + b2n = s2n−2 −(b2n−1 −b2n) ≤s2n−2
and
s2n+1 = s2n−1 + b2n −b2n+1 ≥s2n−1 .
Thus the subsequence of partial sums made by the terms with even index
decreases, whereas the subsequence of odd indexes increases. For any n ≥
0, moreover,
s2n = s2n−1 + b2n ≥s2n−1 ≥. . . ≥s1
and
s2n+1 = s2n −b2n+1 ≤s2n ≤. . . ≤s0 .
Thus {s2n}n≥0 is bounded from below and {s2n+1}n≥0 from above. By
Theorem 3 on p. 2 both sequences converge, so let us put
lim
n→∞s2n = inf
n≥0 s2n = s∗
and
lim
n→∞s2n+1 = sup
n≥0
s2n+1 = s∗.
Since
s∗−s∗= lim
n→∞

s2n −s2n+1

= lim
n→∞b2n+1 = 0 ,
we conclude that the series
∞

k=0
(−1)kbk has sum s = s∗= s∗. In addition,
s2n+1 ≤s ≤s2n ,
∀n ≥0 ,

1.4 Alternating series
17
in other words the sequence {s2n}n≥0 approximates s from above, while
{s2n+1}n≥0 approximates s from below. For any n ≥0 we have
0 ≤s −s2n+1 ≤s2n+2 −s2n+1 = b2n+2
and
0 ≤s2n −s ≤s2n −s2n+1 = b2n+1 ,
so |rn| = |s −sn| ≤bn+1.
2
Examples 1.21
i) Consider the generalised alternating harmonic series
∞

k=1
(−1)k 1
kα , where
α > 0. As lim
k→∞bk = lim
k→∞
1
kα = 0 and the sequence
 1
kα

k≥1 is strictly decreasing,
the series converges.
ii) Condition i) in Leibniz’s Test is also necessary, whereas ii) is only suﬃcient.
In fact, for k ≥2 let
bk =
 1/k
k even ,
(k −1)/k2
k odd .
It is straightforward that bk > 0 and bk is inﬁnitesimal. The sequence is not
monotone decreasing since bk > bk+1 for k even, bk < bk+1 for k odd. Neverthe-
less,
∞

k=2
bk =
∞

k=2
(−1)k 1
k +

k ≥3
k odd

k2
converges, for the two series on the right converge.
iii) We want to approximate the sum of
∞

k=0
(−1)k
k!
to the third digit, meaning
with a margin less than 10−3. The series, alternating for bk =
1
k!, converges by
Leibniz’s Test. From |s −sn| ≤bn+1 we see that for n = 6
0 < s6 −s ≤b7 =
1
5040 <
1
5000 = 0.0002 < 10−3 .
As s6 = 0.368056 . . ., the estimate s ∼0.368 is correct up to the third place. 2
To study series with arbitrary signs the notion of absolute convergence is useful.
Deﬁnition 1.22 The series
∞

k=0
ak converges absolutely if the positive-
term series
∞

k=0
|ak| converges.

Example 1.23
The series
∞

k=0
(−1)k 1
k2 converges absolutely because
∞


k2 converges.
2
The next fact ensures that absolute convergence implies convergence.

lutely then it also converges, and


1.5 The algebra of series
19
Remark 1.25 There are series that converge, but not absolutely. The alternating
harmonic series
∞

k=1
(−1)k 1
k is one such example, for it has a ﬁnite sum, but does not
converge absolutely, since the harmonic series
∞

k=1
1
k diverges. In such a situation
one speaks about conditional convergence.
2
The previous criterion allows one to study alternating series by their absolute
convergence. As the series of absolute values has positive terms, all criteria seen
in Sect 1.3 apply.
1.5 The algebra of series
Two series
∞

k=0
ak,
∞

k=0
bk can be added, multiplied by numbers and multiplied
between themselves. The sum is deﬁned in the obvious way as the series whose
formal general term reads ck = ak + bk:
∞

k=0
ak +
∞

k=0
bk =
∞

k=0
(ak + bk) .
Assume the series both converge or diverge, and write s =
∞

k=0
ak, t =
∞

k=0
bk
(s, t ∈R ∪{±∞}). The sum is determinate (convergent or divergent) whenever
the expression s + t is deﬁned. If so,
∞

k=0
(ak + bk) = s + t
and the sum converges if s + t ∈R, diverges if s + t = ±∞.
If one series converges and the other is indeterminate the sum is necessarily
indeterminate.
Apart from these cases, the nature of the sum cannot be deduced directly from
the behaviour of the two summands, and must be studied case by case.
Let now λ ∈R \ {0}; the series λ
∞

k=0
ak is by deﬁnition the series with gen-
eral term λak. Its behaviour coincides with that of
∞

k=0
ak. Anyhow, in case of
convergence or divergence,
∞

k=0
λak = λs .

20
1 Numerical series
In order to deﬁne the product some thinking is needed. If two series converge
respectively to s, t ∈R we would like the product series to converge to st. This
cannot happen if one deﬁnes the general term ck of the product simply as the
product of the corresponding terms, by setting ck = akbk. An example will clarify
the issue: consider the two geometric series with terms ak =
1
2k and bk =
1
3k . Then
∞

k=0
1
2k =

One way to multiply series and preserve the above property is the so-called
Cauchy product, deﬁned by its general term
ck =
k

j=0
ajbk−j = a0bk + a1bk−1 + · · · + ak−1b1 + akb0 .

each term ck becomes the sum of the entries on the kth anti-diagonal.
The reason for this particular deﬁnition will become clear when we will discuss
power series (Sect. 2.4.1).
It is possible to prove that the absolute convergence of

e) Does not converges.
f) This is an alternating series with bk =
k2
k3 + 1. It is straightforward to check
lim
k→∞bk = 0 .
That the sequence bk is decreasing eventually is, instead, far from obvious. To
show this fact, consider the map
f(x) =
x2
x3 + 1 ,
and consider its monotonicity. Since
f ′(x) = x(2 −x3)
(x3 + 1)2
and we are only interested in x positive, we have f ′(x) < 0 if 2 −x3 < 0,
i.e., x >
3√
2. Therefore, f decreases on the interval (
3√
2, +∞). This means
f(k + 1) < f(k), so bk+1 < bk for k ≥2. In conclusion, the series converges by
Leibniz’s Test 1.20.
13. Series’ approximation:
a) n = 5.
b) The series is alternating with bk = 2k

The minimum number of terms needed is n = 7.

14. Absolute convergence:
a) There is convergence but not absolute convergence. In fact, the alternating
series converges by Leibnitz’s Test 1.20, whereas the series of absolute values
is generalised harmonic with exponent α = 1

b) Does not converge.

as

convergence. The series does not converge absolutely, for

Series of functions and power series
The idea of approximating a function by a sequence of simple functions, or known
ones, lies at the core of several mathematical techniques, both theoretical and
practical. For instance, to prove that a diﬀerential equation has a solution one
can construct recursively a sequence of approximating functions and show they
converge to the required solution. At the same time, explicitly ﬁnding the values
of such a solution may not be possible, not even by analytical methods, so one idea
is to adopt numerical methods instead, which can furnish approximating functions
with a particularly simple form, like piecewise polynomials. It becomes thus crucial
to be able to decide when a sequence of maps generates a limit function, what sort
of convergence towards the limit we have, and which features of the functions in
the sequence are inherited by the limit. All this will be the content of the ﬁrst part
of this chapter.
The recipe for passing from a sequence of functions to the corresponding series
is akin to what we have seen for a sequence of real numbers; the additional com-
plication consists in the fact that now diﬀerent kinds of convergence can occur.
Expanding a function in series represents one of the most important tools of
Mathematical Analysis and its applications, again both from the theoretical and
practical point of view. Fundamental examples of series of functions are given by
power series, discussed in the second half of this chapter, and by Fourier series, to
which the whole subsequent chapter is dedicated. Other instances include series of
the classical orthogonal functions, like the expansions in Legendre, Chebyshev or
Hermite polynomials, Bessel functions, and so on.
In contrast to the latter cases, which provide a global representation of a func-
tion over an interval of the real line, power series have a more local nature; in fact,
a power series that converges on an interval (x0 −R, x0 + R) represents the limit
function therein just by using information on its behaviour on an arbitrarily small
neighbourhood of x0. The power series of a functions may actually be thought of
as a Taylor expansion of inﬁnite order, centred at x0. This fact reﬂects the intu-
itive picture of a power series as an algebraic polynomial of inﬁnite degree, that
is a sum of inﬁnitely many monomials of increasing degree. In the ﬁnal sections
we will address the problem of rigorously determining the convergence set of a

2 Series of functions and power series
power series; then we will study the main properties of power series and of series
of functions, called analytic functions, that can be expanded in series on a real
interval that does not reduce to a point.
2.1 Sequences of functions
Let X be an arbitrary subset of the real line. Suppose that there is a real map
deﬁned on X, which we denote fn : X →R, for any n larger or equal than a
certain n0 ≥0. The family {fn}n≥n0 is said sequence of functions. Examples
are the families fn(x) = sin(x + 1
n), n ≥1 or fn(x) = xn, n ≥0, on X = R.
As for numerical sequences, we are interested in the study of the behaviour of
a sequence of maps as n →∞. The ﬁrst step is to analyse the numerical sequence
given by the values of the maps fn at each point of X.
Deﬁnition 2.1 The sequence {fn}n≥n0 converges pointwise at x ∈X if
the numerical sequence {fn(x)}n≥n0 converges as n →∞. The subset A ⊆X
of such points x is called set of pointwise convergence of the sequence
{fn}n≥n0. This deﬁnes a map f : A →R by
f(x) = lim
n→∞fn(x) ,
∀x ∈A .
We shall write fn →f pointwise on A, and speak of the limit function f of
the sequence.
Note f is the limit function of the sequence if and only if
lim
n→∞|fn(x) −f(x)| = 0 ,
∀x ∈A .
Examples 2.2
i) Let fn(x) = sin

x + 1
n

, n ≥1, on X = R. Observing that x + 1
n →x as
n →∞, and using the sine’s continuity, we have
f(x) = lim
n→∞sin

x + 1
n

= sin x ,
∀x ∈R ,
hence A = X = R.
ii) Consider fn(x) = xn, n ≥0, on X = R; recalling (1.1) we have
f(x) = lim
n→∞xn =
 0
if −1 < x < 1 ,
1
if x = 1 .
(2.1)
The sequence converges for no other value x, so A = (−1, 1].
2
The notion of pointwise convergence is not suﬃcient, in many cases, to transfer
the properties of the single maps fn onto the limit function f. Continuity (but also
diﬀerentiability, or integrability) is one such case. In the above examples the maps
fn(x) are continuous, but the limit function is continuous in case i), not for ii).

2.1 Sequences of functions
35
A more compelling convergence requirement, that warrants continuity is passed
onto the limit, is the so-called uniform convergence. To understand the diﬀerence
with pointwise convergence, let us make Deﬁnition 2.1 explicit. This states that
for any point x ∈A and any ε > 0 there is an integer n such that
∀n ≥n0 , n > n
=⇒
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ε .
In general n depends not only upon ε but also on x, i.e., n = n(ε, x). In other
terms the index n, after which the values fn(x) approximate f(x) with a margin
smaller than ε, may vary from point to point. For example consider fn(x) = xn,
with 0 < x < 1; then the condition
|fn(x) −f(x)| = |xn −0| = xn < ε
holds for any n > log ε
log x. Therefore the smallest n for which the condition is valid
tends to inﬁnity as x approaches 1. Hence there is no n depending on ε and not
on x.
The convergence is said uniform whenever the index n can be chosen inde-
pendently of x. This means that, for any ε > 0, there must be an integer n such
that
∀n ≥n0 , n > n
=⇒
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ε ,
∀x ∈A .
Using the notion of supremum and inﬁmum, and recalling ε is arbitrary, we can
reformulate as follows: for any ε > 0 there is an integer n such that
∀n ≥n0 , n > n
=⇒
sup
x∈A
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ε .
Deﬁnition 2.3 The sequence {fn}n≥n0 converges uniformly on A to the
limit function f if
lim
n→∞sup
x∈A
|fn(x) −f(x)| = 0 .
Otherwise said, for any ε > 0 there is an n = n(ε) such that
∀n ≥n0 , n > n
=⇒
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ε ,
∀x ∈A .
(2.2)
We will write fn →f uniformly on A.
Let us introduce the symbol
∥g∥∞,A = sup
x∈A
|g(x)| ,
for a bounded map g : A →R; this quantity is variously called inﬁnity norm,
supremum norm, or sup-norm for short (see Appendix A.2.1, p. 521, for a compre-
hensive presentation of the concept of norm of a function). An alternative deﬁnition
of uniform convergence is thus
lim
n→∞∥fn −f∥∞,A = 0 .
(2.3)

36
2 Series of functions and power series
Clearly, the uniform convergence of a sequence is a stronger condition than
pointwise convergence. By deﬁnition of sup-norm in fact,
∀x ∈A ,
|fn(x) −f(x)| ≤∥fn −f∥∞,A
so if the norm on the right tends to 0, so does the absolute value on the left.
Therefore
Proposition 2.4 If the sequence {fn}n≥n0 converges to f uniformly on A,
it converges pointwise on A.
The converse is false, as some examples show.
Examples 2.5
i) The sequence fn(x) = sin

on R. In fact, using known trigonometric identities, we have, for any x ∈R,

moreover, equality is attained for x = −1

and passing to the limit for n →∞we obtain the result (see Fig. 2.1, left).
ii) As already seen, fn(x) = xn, n ≥0, does not converge uniformly on I = [0, 1]
to f deﬁned in (2.1). For any n ≥0 in fact, ∥fn−f∥∞,I = sup
0≤x<1
xn = 1 (Fig. 2.1,
right). Nevertheless, the convergence is uniform on every sub-interval Ia = [0, a],
0 < a < 1, for
∥fn −f∥∞,Ia = sup
x∈[0,a]
|xn −0| = an →0
as n →∞.
Therefore the sequence converges to zero uniformly on Ia. More generally one can
show the sequence converges uniformly to zero on any interval [−a, a], 0 < a < 1.
2
The following criterion is immediate to check, and useful for verifying uniform
convergence.
Proposition 2.6 Let the sequence {fn}n≥n0 converge pointwise on A to a
function f. Take a numerical sequence {Mn}n≥n0, inﬁnitesimal for n →∞,
such that
|fn(x) −f(x)| ≤Mn ,
∀x ∈A .
Then fn →f uniformly on A.
The property has been used in the previous examples, with Mn = 2 sin 1
2n for
case i), and Mn = an for ii).

2.2 Properties of uniformly convergent sequences
As announced earlier, under uniform convergence the limit function inherits con-
tinuity from the sequence.
Theorem 2.7 Let the sequence of continuous maps {fn}n≥n0 converge uni-
formly to f on the real interval I. Then f is continuous on I.
Proof.
By uniform convergence, given ε > 0, there is an n = n(ε) ≥n0 such that
for any n > n and any x ∈I
|fn(x) −f(x)| < ε
3 .
Fix x0 ∈I and take n > n. As fn is continuous at x0, there is a δ > 0 such
that, for each x ∈I with |x −x0| < δ,
|fn(x) −fn(x0)| < ε
3 .
Let therefore x ∈I with |x −x0| < δ. Then
|f(x) −f(x0)| ≤|f(x) −fn(x)| + |fn(x) −fn(x0)| +
+|fn(x0) −f(x0)| < ε
3 + ε
3 + ε
3 = ε ,
so f is continuous at x0 .
2
This result can be used to say that pointwise convergence is not always uniform.
In fact if the limit function is not continuous while the single terms in the sequence
are, the convergence cannot be uniform.

Suppose fn →f pointwise on I = [a, b]. If the maps are integrable, it is not true,
in general, that
 b

Uniform convergence is a suﬃcient condition for transferring integrability to
the limit.
Theorem 2.9 Let I = [a, b] be a closed, bounded interval and {fn}n≥n0 a
sequence of integrable functions over I such that fn →f uniformly on I.
Then f is integrable on I, and
 b
a
fn(x) dx →
 b
a
f(x) dx
as n →∞.
(2.4)
Proof.
The integrability of the limit function is immediate if each fn is continuous,
for in that case f itself is continuous by the previous theorem. In general,
one needs to approximate the functions by means of step functions, as
prescribed by the deﬁnition of an integrable map; the details are left to
the reader’s good will.
In order to prove (2.4), let us ﬁx ε > 0; then there exists an n = n(ε) ≥n0
such that, for any n > n and any x ∈I,
|fn(x) −f(x)| <
ε
b −a .

Note that (2.4) can be written as

showing that uniform convergence allows to exchange the operations of limit and
integration.
2.2.2 Interchanging limits and derivatives
When considering limits of diﬀerentiable functions, certain assumptions on uniform
convergence guarantee the diﬀerentiability of the limit.
Theorem 2.10 Let {fn}n≥n0 be a sequence of C1 functions over the interval
I = [a, b]. Suppose there exist maps f and g on I such that
i) fn →f pointwise on I;
ii) f ′
n →g uniformly on I.
Then f is C1 on I, and f ′ = g. Moreover, fn →f uniformly on I (and clearly,
f ′
n →f ′ uniformly on I).
Proof.
Fix an arbitrary x0 ∈I and set
˜f(x) = f(x0) +
 x
x0
g(t) dt .
(2.5)
We show ﬁrst that fn →˜f uniformly on I. For this, let ε > 0 be given. By
i), there exists n1 = n1(ε; x0) ≥n0 such that for any n > n1 we have
|fn(x0) −f(x0)| < ε
2 .
By ii), there is n2 = n2(ε) ≥n0 such that, for any n > n2 and any t ∈[a, b],
|f ′
n(t) −g(t)| <
ε
2(b −a) .
Note we may write each map fn as
fn(x) = fn(x0) +
 x
x0
f ′
n(t) dt ,
because of the Fundamental Theorem of Integral Calculus (see Vol. I,
Cor. 9.42). Thus, for any n > n = max(n1, n2) and any x ∈[a, b], we have
|fn(x) −˜f(x)| =

Therefore fn →˜f uniformly on I, hence also pointwise, by Proposition
2.4. But fn →f pointwise on I by assumption; by the uniqueness of the
limit then, ˜f coincides with f. From (2.5) and the Fundamental Theorem
of Integral Calculus it follows that f is diﬀerentiable with ﬁrst derivative g.
2
Under the theorem’s assumptions then,
lim
n→∞f ′
n(x) =

lim
n→∞fn(x)
′
,
∀x ∈I ,
so the uniform convergence (of the ﬁrst derivatives) allows to exchange the limit
and the derivative.
Remark 2.11 A more general result, with similar proof, states that if a sequence
{fn}n≥n0 of C1 maps satisﬁes these two properties:
i)
there is an x0 ∈[a, b] such that lim
n→∞fn(x0) = ℓ∈R;
ii) the sequence {f ′
n}n≥n0 converges uniformly on I to a map g (necessarily con-
tinuous on I),
then, setting
f(x) = ℓ+
 x
x0
g(t) dt ,
fn converges uniformly to f on I. Furthermore, f ∈C1 and f ′(x) = g(x) for any
x ∈[a, b].
2
Remark 2.12 An example will explain why mere pointwise convergence of the
derivatives is not enough to conclude as in the theorem, even in case the sequence
of functions converges uniformly. Consider the sequence fn(x) = x −xn/n; it
converges uniformly on I = [0, 1] to f(x) = x because
|fn(x) −f(x)| =

xn
n
 ≤1
n ,
∀x ∈I ,
and hence
∥fn −f∥∞,I ≤1

as n →∞.
Yet the derivatives f ′
n(x) = 1 −xn−1 converge to the discontinuous function

2.3 Series of functions
41
g(x) =
 1
if x ∈[0, 1) ,
0
if x = 1 .
So {f ′
n}n≥0 converges only pointwise to g on [0, 1], not uniformly, and the latter
does not coincide on I with the derivative of f.
2
2.3 Series of functions
Starting with a sequence of functions {fk}k≥k0 deﬁned on a set X ⊆R, we can
build a series of functions
∞

k=k0
fk in a similar fashion to numerical sequences and
series. Precisely, we consider how the sequence of partial sums
sn(x) =
n

k=k0
fk(x)
behaves as n →∞. Diﬀerent types of convergence can occur.
Deﬁnition 2.13 The series of functions
∞

k=k0
fk converges pointwise at x
if the sequence of partial sums {sn}n≥k0 converges pointwise at x; equivalently,
the numerical series
∞

k=k0
fk(x) converges. Let A ⊆X be the set of such points
x, called the set of pointwise convergence of
∞

k=k0
fk; we have thus deﬁned
the function s : A →R, called sum, by
s(x) = lim
n→∞sn(x) =
∞

k=k0
fk(x) ,
∀x ∈A .
The pointwise convergence of a series of functions can be studied using at each
point x ∈X what we already know about numerical series. In particular, the
sequence {fk(x)}k≥k0 must be inﬁnitesimal, as k →∞, in order for x to belong
to A. What is more, the convergence criteria seen in the previous chapter can be
applied, at each point.
Deﬁnition 2.14 The series of functions
∞

k=k0
fk converges absolutely on
A if for any x ∈A the series
∞

k=k0
|fk(x)| converges.

42
2 Series of functions and power series
Deﬁnition 2.15 The series of functions
∞

k=k0
fk converges uniformly to
the function s on A if the sequence of partial sums {sn}n≥k0 converges uni-
formly to s on A.
Both the absolute convergence (due to Theorem 1.24) and the uniform conver-
gence (Proposition 2.4) imply the pointwise convergence of the series. There are
no logical implications between uniform and absolute convergence, instead.
Example 2.16
The series
∞

k=0
xk is nothing but the geometric series of Example 1.3 where
q is taken as independent variable and re-labelled x. Thus, the series converges
pointwise to the sum s(x) =
1
1−x on A = (−1, 1); on the same set there is absolute
convergence as well. As for uniform convergence, it holds on every closed interval
[−a, a] with 0 < a < 1. In fact,
|sn(x) −s(x)| =

1 −xn+1
1 −x
−
1
1 −x
 = |x|n+1
1 −x ≤an+1
1 −a ,
where we have used the fact that |x| ≤a implies 1 −a ≤1 −x. Moreover,
the sequence Mn =
an+1
1−a tends to 0 as n →∞, and the result follows from
Proposition 2.6.
2
It is clear from the deﬁnitions just given that Theorems 2.7, 2.9 and 2.10 can
be formulated for series of functions, so we re-phrase them for completeness’ sake.
Theorem 2.17 Let {fk}k≥k0 be a sequence of continuous maps on a real
interval I such that the series
∞

k=k0
fk converges uniformly to a function s on
I. Then s is continuous on I.
Theorem 2.18 (Integration by series) Let I = [a, b] be a closed bounded
interval and {fk}k≥k0 a sequence of integrable functions on I such that
∞

k=k0
fk
converges uniformly to a function s on I. Then s is integrable on I, and

fk(x) dx =


k=k0

(2.6)

2.3 Series of functions
43
This is worded alternatively by saying that the series is integrable term by term.
Theorem 2.19 (Diﬀerentiation of series) Let {fk}k≥k0 be a sequence of
C1 maps on I = [a, b]. Suppose there are maps s and t on I such that
i)
∞

k=k0
fk(x) = s(x) ,
∀x ∈I;
ii)
∞

k=k0
f ′
k(x) = t(x) ,
∀x ∈I and the convergence is uniform on I.
Then s ∈C1(I) and s′ = t. Furthermore,
∞

k=k0
fk converges uniformly to s on
I (and
∞

k=k0
f ′
k converges uniformly to s′).
That is to say,
∞

k=k0
f ′
k(x) =
 ∞

k=k0
fk(x)
′
,
∀x ∈I ,
and the series is diﬀerentiable term by term.
The importance of uniform convergence should be clear by now. But checking
uniform convergence is another matter, often far from easy. Using the deﬁnition
requires knowing the sum, and as we have seen with numerical series, the sum is not
always computable explicitly. For this reason we will prove a condition suﬃcient
to guarantee the uniform convergence of a series, even without knowing its sum in
advance.
Theorem 2.20 (Weierstrass’ M-test) Let {fk}k≥k0 be a sequence of maps
on X and {Mk}k≥k0 a sequence of real numbers such that, for any k ≥k0,
|fk(x)| ≤Mk ,
∀x ∈X .
Assume the numerical series
∞

k=k0
Mk converges. Then the series
∞

k=k0
fk con-
verges uniformly on X.

44
2 Series of functions and power series
Proof.
Fix x ∈X, so that the numerical series
∞

k=k0
|fk(x)| converges by the
Comparison Test, and hence the sum
s(x) =
∞

k=k0
fk(x) ,
∀x ∈X ,
is well deﬁned. It suﬃces to check whether the partial sums {sn}n≥k0
converge uniformly to s on X. But for any x ∈X,
|sn(x) −s(x)| =


k=n+1
Mk .
As the series
∞

k=k0
Mk converges, the right-hand side is just the nth re-
mainder of a converging series, which goes to 0 as n →∞.
In conclusion,
lim
n→∞sup
x∈X
|sn(x) −s(x)| = 0
so
∞

k=k0
fk converges uniformly on X.

(it is generalised harmonic of exponent 3/2). Therefore the given series converges

2.4 Power series
Power series are very special series in which the maps fk are polynomials. More
precisely,

2.4 Power series
45
Deﬁnition 2.22 Fix x0 ∈R and let {ak}k≥0 be a numerical sequence. One
calls power series a series of the form
∞

k=0
ak(x −x0)k = a0 + a1(x −x0) + a2(x −x0)2 + · · ·
(2.7)
The point x0 is said centre of the series and the numbers {ak}k≥0 are the
series’ coeﬃcients.
The series converges at its centre, irrespective of the coeﬃcients.
The next three examples exhaust the possible types of convergence set of a
series. We will show that such set is always an interval (possibly shrunk to the
centre).
Examples 2.23
i) The series
∞

k=1
kkxk = x + 4x2 + 27x3 + · · ·
converges only at x = 0; in fact at any other x ̸= 0 the general term kkxk
is not inﬁnitesimal, so the necessary condition for convergence is not fulﬁlled
(Property 1.6).
ii) Consider
∞

k=0
xk
k! = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + · · · ;
(2.8)
it is known as exponential series, because it sums to the function s(x) = ex.
This fact will be proved later in Example 2.46 i).
The exponential series converges for any x ∈R. Indeed, with a given x ̸= 0, the
Ratio Test for numerical series (Theorem 1.14) guarantees convergence:
lim
k→∞

xk+1
(k + 1)! · k!
xk
 = lim
k→∞
|x|
k + 1 = 0 ,
∀x ∈R \ {0} .
iii) Another familiar example is the geometric series
∞

k=0
xk = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · ·
(recall Example 2.16). We already know it converges, for x ∈(−1, 1), to the
function s(x) =
1
1−x.
2
In all examples the series converge (absolutely) on a symmetric interval with
respect to the centre (the origin, in the speciﬁc cases). We will see that the con-
vergence set A of any power series, independently of the coeﬃcients, is either a
bounded interval (open, closed or half-open) centered at x0, or the whole R.

46
2 Series of functions and power series
We start by series centered at the origin; this is no real restriction, because the
substitution y = x −x0 allows to reduce to that case.
Before that though, we need a technical result, direct consequence of the Com-
parison Test for numerical series (Theorem 1.10), which will be greatly useful for
power series.
Proposition 2.24 If the series
∞

k=0
akxk, x ̸= 0, has bounded terms, in par-
ticular if it converges, then the power series
∞

k=0
akxk converges absolutely for
any x such that |x| < |x|.
Proof.
As akxk is bounded, there is a constant M > 0 such that
|akxk| ≤M ,
∀k ≥0 .
For any x with |x| < |x| then,
|akxk| =
akxk x

does not converge when |x| ≤1 because, in case x = ±1, the general term is not
inﬁnitesimal.
2
Proposition 2.24 has an immediate, yet crucial, consequence.
Corollary 2.26 If a power series
∞

k=0
akxk converges at x1 ̸= 0, it con-
verges absolutely on the open interval (−|x1|, |x1|); if it does not converge
at x2 ̸= 0, it does not converge anywhere along the half-lines (|x2|, +∞) and
(−∞, −|x2|).

Figure 2.2. Illustration of Corollary 2.26
The statement is depicted in Fig. 2.2, for x1 > 0 and x2 < 0.
Now we are in a position to prove that the convergence set of a power series is
a symmetric interval, end-points excluded.
Theorem 2.27 Given a power series
∞

k=0
akxk, only one of the following
holds:
a) the series converges at x = 0 only;
b) the series converges pointwise and absolutely for any x ∈R; moreover, it
converges uniformly on every closed and bounded interval [a, b];
c) there is a unique real number R > 0 such that the series converges
pointwise and absolutely for any |x| < R, and uniformly on all intervals
[a, b] ⊂(−R, R). Furthermore, the series does not converge on |x| > R.
Proof.
Let A denote the set of convergence of
∞

k=0
akxk.
If A = {0}, we have case a).
Case b) occurs if A = R. In fact, Corollary 2.26 tells the series converges
pointwise and absolutely for any x ∈R. As for the uniform convergence
on [a, b], set L = max(|a|, |b|). Then
|fk(x)| = |akxk| ≤|akLk| ,
∀x ∈[a, b] ;
and we may use Weierstrass’ M-test 2.20 with Mk = |ak|Lk.
Now suppose A contains points other than 0 but is smaller that the whole
line, so there is an x /∈A. Corollary 2.26 says A cannot contain any x with
|x| > |x|, meaning that A is bounded. Set R = sup A, so R > 0 because A
is larger than {0}. Consider an arbitrary x with |x| < R: by deﬁnition of
supremum there is an x1 such that |x| < x1 < R and
∞

k=0

1 converges.
Hence Corollary 2.26 tells the series converges pointwise and absolutely at
x. For uniform convergence we proceed exactly as in case b). At last, by
deﬁnition of sup the set A cannot contain values x > R, but neither values

x < −R (again by Corollary 2.26). Thus if |x| > R the series

Going back to Theorem 2.27, we remark that R = 0 in case a); in case b),
R = +∞, while in case c), R is precisely the strictly-positive real number of the
statement.
Examples 2.29
Let us return to Examples 2.23.
i) The series
∞

k=1
kkxk has convergence radius R = 0.
ii) For
∞

k=0
xk
k! the radius is R = +∞.
iii) The series
∞

k=0
xk has radius R = 1.
2
Beware that the theorem says nothing about the behaviour at x = ±R: the
series might converge at both end-points, at one only, or at none, as in the next
examples.
Examples 2.30
i) The series
∞

k=1
xk
k2
converges at x = ±1 (generalised harmonic of exponent 2 for x = 1, alternat-
ing for x = −1). It does not converge on |x| > 1, as the general term is not
inﬁnitesimal. Thus R = 1 and A = [−1, 1].
ii) The series
∞

k=1
xk
k
converges at x = −1 (alternating harmonic series) but not at x = 1 (harmonic
series). Hence R = 1 and A = [−1, 1).

2.4 Power series
49
iii) The geometric series
∞

k=1
xk
converges only on A = (−1, 1) with radius R = 1.
2
Convergence at one end-point ensures the series converges uniformly on closed
intervals containing that end-point. Precisely, we have
Theorem 2.31 (Abel) Suppose R > 0 is ﬁnite. If the series converges at
x = R, then the convergence is uniform on every interval [a, R] ⊂(−R, R].
The analogue statement holds if the series converges at x = −R.
If we now center a power series at a generic x0, the previous results read as
follows. The radius R is 0 if and only if
∞

k=0
ak(x−x0)k converges only at x0, while
R = +∞if and only if the series converges at any x in R. In the remaining case
R is positive and ﬁnite, and Theorem 2.27 says the set A of convergence satisﬁes
{x ∈R : |x −x0| < R} ⊆A ⊆{x ∈R : |x −x0| ≤R} .
The importance of determining the radius of convergence is evident. The next
two criteria, easy consequences of the analogous Ratio and Root Tests for numerical
series, give a rather simple yet useful answer.

When ℓ= +∞, we have ℓ|x| > 1 and the series does not converge for any
x ̸= 0, so R = 0; when ℓ= 0, ℓ|x| = 0 < 1 and the series converges for any
x, so R = +∞. At last, when ℓis ﬁnite and non-zero, the series converges
for all x such that ℓ|x| < 1, so for |x| < 1/ℓ, and not for |x| > 1/ℓ; therefore
R = 1/ℓ.

if the limit

exists, the radius R is given by formula (2.9).
The proof, left to the reader, relies on the Root Test 1.15 and follows the same
lines.
Examples 2.34
i) The series
∞

k=0

k = 1; it does not
converge for x = 1 nor for x = −1.

2.4 Power series

set y = (x −2)2 and consider the power series in y
∞

k=2
2k + 1
(k −1)(k + 2)yk
(2.11)
centred at the origin. Since
lim
k→∞
k
 
2k + 1
(k −1)(k + 2) = 1
the radius is 1. For y = 1 the series (2.11) reduces to
∞

k=2
2k + 1
(k −1)(k + 2) ,
which diverges like the harmonic series (
2k+1
(k−1)(k+2) ∼2
k , k →∞), whereas for
y = −1 the series (2.11) converges (by Leibniz’s Test 1.20). In summary, (2.11)
converges for −1 ≤y < 1.
Going back to the variable x, that means −1 ≤(x −2)2 < 1. The left inequality
is always true, while the right one holds for −1 < x −2 < 1. So, the series (2.10)
has radius R = 1 and converges on the interval (1, 3) (note the centre is x0 = 2).
iv) The series
∞

k=0
xk! = x + x + x2 + x6 + x24 + · · ·
is a power series where inﬁnitely many coeﬃcients are 0, and we cannot substitute
as we did before; in such cases the aforementioned criteria do not apply, and it
is more convenient to use directly the Ratio or Root Test for numerical series.
In the case at hand

k→∞|x|(k+1)!−k!

k→∞|x|k!k =

Thus R = 1. The series converges neither for x = 1, nor for x = −1.
v) Consider, for α ∈R, the binomial series

If α = n ∈N the series is actually a ﬁnite sum, and Newton’s binomial formula

and the series has radius R = 1. The behaviour of the series at the endpoints
cannot be studied by one of the criteria presented above; one can prove that the
series converges at x = −1 only for α > 0 and at x = 1 only for α > −1.

2.4.1 Algebraic operations
The operations of sum and product of two polynomials extend in a natural manner
to power series centred at the same point x0; the problem remains of determining
the radius of convergence of the resulting series. This is addressed in the next
theorems, where x0 will be 0 for simplicity.
Theorem 2.35 Given Σ1 =
∞

k=0
akxk and Σ2 =
∞

k=0
bkxk , of respect-
ive radii R1, R2, their sum Σ =
∞

k=0
(ak + bk)xk has radius R satisfying
R ≥min(R1, R2). If R1 ̸= R2, necessarily R = min(R1, R2).
Proof.
Suppose R1 ̸= R2; we may assume R1 < R2. Given any point x such that
R1 < x < R2, if the series Σ converged we would have
Σ1 =
∞

k=0
akxk =
∞

k=0
(ak + bk)xk −
∞

k=0
bkxk = Σ −Σ2 ,
hence also the series Σ1 would have to converge, contradicting the fact
that x > R1. Therefore R = R1 = min(R1, R2).
In case R1 = R2, the radius R is at least equal to such value, since the
sum of two convergent series is convergent (see Sect. 1.5).
2
In case R1 = R2, the radius R might be strictly larger than both R1, R2 due
to possible cancellations of terms in the sum.
Example 2.36
The series
Σ1 =


k=1

though, has radius R = 4.

2.4 Power series
53
The product of two series is deﬁned so that to preserve the distributive property
of the sum with respect to the multiplication. In other words,
(a0 + a1x + a2x2 + . . .)(b0 + b1x + b2x2 + . . .)
= a0b0 + (a0b1 + a1b0)x + (a0b2 + a1b1 + a2b0)x2 + . . . ,

where

This multiplication rule is called Cauchy product: putting x = 1 returns precisely
the Cauchy product (1.9) of numerical series. Then we have the following result.
Theorem 2.37 Given Σ1 =

k=0
akxk and Σ2 =

bkxk , of respective radii
R1, R2, their Cauchy product has convergence radius R ≥min(R1, R2).
2.4.2 Diﬀerentiation and integration
Let us move on to consider the regularity of the sum of a power series. We have
already remarked that the functions fk(x) = ak(x −x0)k are C∞polynomials
over all of R. In particular they are continuous and their sum s(x) is continuous,
where deﬁned (using Theorem 2.17), because the convergence is uniform on closed
intervals in the convergence set (Theorem 2.31). Let us see in detail how term-by-
term diﬀerentiation and integration ﬁt with power series. For clarity we assume
x0 = 0 and begin with a little technical fact.

Proof.
Call R1, R2 the radii of "

2 respectively. Clearly R2 ≤R1 (for |akxk| ≤
|kakxk|). On the other hand if |x| < R1 and x satisﬁes |x| < x < R1,
the series

akxk converges and so |ak|xk is bounded from above by a
constant M > 0 for any k ≥0. Hence

Theorem 2.39 Suppose the radius R of the series
∞

k=0
akxk is positive, ﬁnite
or inﬁnite. Then
a) the sum s is a C∞map over (−R, R). Moreover, the nth derivative of s
on (−R, R) can be computed by diﬀerentiating
∞

times. In particular, for any x ∈(−R, R)

identical radii, because

kakxk−1 = 1
x
∞

k=1
kakxk for any x ̸= 0. The
derivatives’ series converges uniformly on every interval [a, b] ⊂(−R, R);
thus Theorem 2.19 applies, and we conclude that s is C1 on (−R, R) and
that (2.13) holds. Iterating the argument proves the claim.
b) The result follows immediately by noticing

k=0
akxk is the derivatives’
series of

ak(x −x0)k has radius R > 0. The series’
coeﬃcients depend on the derivatives of the sum s(x) as follows:

∀k ≥0 .
Proof.

For x = x0 only the term indexed by h = 0 contributes, and the above
expression becomes
s(k)(x0) = k! ak ,
∀k ≥0 .

2.5 Analytic functions
The previous section examined the properties of the sum of a power series, summar-
ised in Theorem 2.39. Now we want to take the opposite viewpoint, and demand
that an arbitrary function (necessarily C∞) be the sum of some power series. Said
better, we take f ∈C∞(X), X ⊆R, x0 ∈X and ask whether, on a suitable interval
(x0 −δ, x0 + δ) ⊆X with δ > 0, it is possible to represent f as the sum of a power
series
f(x) =
∞

k=0
ak(x −x0)k ;
(2.19)
by Proposition 2.41 we must necessarily have
ak = f (k)(x0)
k!
,
∀k ≥0 .
In particular when x0 = 0, f is given by
f(x) =
∞

k=0
f (k)(0)
k!
xk .
(2.20)
Deﬁnition 2.42 The series (2.19) is called the Taylor series of f centred
at x0. If the radius is positive and the sum coincides with f around x0 (i.e.,
on some neighbourhood of x0), one says the map f has a Taylor series ex-
pansion, or is an analytic function, at x0. If x0 = 0, one speaks sometimes
of Maclaurin series of f.
The deﬁnition is motivated by the fact that not all C∞functions admit a power
series representation, as in this example.
Example 2.43
Consider
f(x) =

e−1/x2
if x ̸= 0 ,
0
if x = 0 .
It is not hard to check f is C∞on R with f (k)(0) = 0 for all k ≥0. Therefore
the terms of (2.20) all vanish and the sum (the zero function) does not represent
f anywhere around the origin.
2

2.5 Analytic functions
57
The partial sums in (2.19) are precisely the Taylor polynomials of f at x0:
sn(x) =
n

k=0
f (k)(x0)
k!
(x −x0)k = T fn,x0(x) .
Therefore f having a Taylor series expansion is equivalent to the convergence to
f of the sequence of its own Taylor polynomials:
lim
n→∞sn(x) = lim
n→∞T fn,x0(x) = f(x) ,
∀x ∈(x0 −δ, x0 + δ) .
In such a case the nth remainder of the series rn(x) = f(x)−sn(x) is inﬁnitesimal,
as n →∞, for any x ∈(x0 −δ, x0 + δ):
lim
n→∞rn(x) = 0 .
There is a suﬃcient condition for a C∞map to have a Taylor series expansion
around a point.
Theorem 2.44 Take f ∈C∞(x0 −δ, x0 + δ), δ > 0. If there are an index
k0 ≥0 and a constant M > 0 such that
|f (k)(x)| ≤M k!
δk ,
∀x ∈(x0 −δ, x0 + δ)
(2.21)
for all k ≥k0, then f has a Taylor series expansion at x0 whose radius is at
least δ.
Proof.
Write the Taylor expansion of f at x0 of order n ≥k0 with Lagrange
remainder (see Vol. I, Thm 7.2):
f(x) = T fn,x0(x) +
1
(n + 1)!f (n+1)(xn)(x −x0)n+1 ,
where xn is a certain point between x0 and x. By assumption, for any
x ∈(x0 −δ, x0 + δ) we have
|rn(x)| =
1
(n + 1)!|f (n+1)(xn)| |x −x0|n+1 ≤M
	|x −x0|
δ

n+1
.
If we assume |x −x0|/δ< 1, then
lim
n→∞rn(x) = 0
and the claim is proved.

58
2 Series of functions and power series
Remark 2.45 Condition (2.21) holds in particular if all derivatives f (k)(x) are
uniformly bounded, independently of k: this means there is a constant M > 0 for
which
|f (k)(x)| ≤M ,
∀x ∈(x0 −δ, x0 + δ) .
(2.22)
In fact, from Example 1.1 v) we have
k!
δk →∞as k →∞, so k!
δk ≥1 for k bigger
or equal than a certain k0.
A similar argument shows that (2.21) is true more generally if
|f (k)(x)| ≤M k ,
∀x ∈(x0 −δ, x0 + δ) .
(2.23)
Examples 2.46
i) We can eventually prove the earlier claim on the exponential series, that is to
say
ex =
∞

k=0
xk
k!
∀x ∈R .
(2.24)
We already know the series converges for any x ∈R (Example 2.23 ii)); addition-
ally, the map ex is C∞on R with f (k)(x) = ex, f (k)(0) = 1 . Fixing an arbitrary
δ > 0, inequality (2.22) holds since
|f (k)(x)| = ex ≤eδ = M ,
∀x ∈(−δ,δ ) .
Hence f has a Maclaurin series and (2.24) is true, as promised.
More generally, ex has a Taylor series at each x0 ∈R:
ex =
∞

k=0
ex0
k! (x −x0)k ,
∀x ∈R .
ii) Writing −x2 instead of x in (2.24) yields
e−x2 =

iii) The trigonometric functions f(x) = sin x, g(x) = cos x are analytic for any
x ∈R. Indeed, they are C∞on R and all derivatives satisfy (2.22) with M = 1.
In the special case x0 = 0,

xk = αf(x) .
Hence f ′(x) = α(1 + x)−1f(x). Now take the map g(x) = (1 + x)−αf(x) and
note
g′(x) = −α(1 + x)−α−1f(x) + (1 + x)−αf ′(x)
= −α(1 + x)−α−1f(x) + α(1 + x)−α−1f(x) = 0
for any x ∈(−1, 1). Therefore g(x) is constant and we can write
f(x) = c(1 + x)α .
The value of the constant c is ﬁxed by f(0) = 1, so c = 1.
v) When α = −1, formula (2.27) gives the Taylor series of f(x) =

(−1)kxk .
Actually, f is analytic at all points x0 ̸= −1 and the corresponding Taylor series’
radius is R = |1 + x0|, i.e., the distance of x0 from the singular point x = −1;
indeed, one has
f (k)(x) = (−1)kk!(1 + x)−(k+1)
and it is not diﬃcult to check estimate (2.21) on a suitable neighbourhood of x0.
Furthermore, the Root Test (Theorem 2.33) gives

2.6 Power series in C
The deﬁnition of power series extends easily to the complex numbers. By a power
series in C we mean an expression like
∞

k=0
ak(z −z0)k ,
where {ak}k≥0 is a sequence of complex numbers, z0 ∈C and z is the complex
variable. The notions of convergence (pointwise, absolute, uniform) carry over
provided we substitute everywhere the absolute value with the modulus.
The convergence interval of a real power series is now replaced by a disc in the
complex plane, centred at z0 and of radius R ∈[0, +∞].
The term analytic map determines a function of one complex variable that is
the sum of a power series in C. Examples include rational functions of complex
variable
f(z) = P(z)
Q(z) ,
where P, Q are coprime polynomials over the complex numbers; with z0 ∈dom f
ﬁxed, the convergence radius of the series centred at z0 whose sum is f coincides
with the distance (in the complex plane) between z0 and the nearest zero of the
denominator, i.e., the closest singularity.
The exponential, sine and cosine functions possess a natural extension to C,
obtained by substituting the real variable x with the complex z in (2.24), (2.25) and
(2.26). These new series converge on the whole complex plane, so the corresponding
functions are analytic on C.

The limit function f is identically zero on I.
For the uniform convergence, we study the maps fn on I and notice

n(x) = 0 for xn =

and the convergence is not uniform on [0, +∞). Nonetheless, with δ > 0 ﬁxed
and n large enough, fn is decreasing on [δ, +∞), so
sup
x∈[δ,+∞)
|fn(x)| = fn(δ) →0
as
n →+∞.
The convergence is uniform on all intervals [δ, +∞) with δ > 0.

f ′
n(x) =

d) We have pointwise convergence to f(x) = 0 for all x ∈[0, +∞), and uniform
convergence on every [δ, +∞), δ > 0.
e) Note fn(0) = 1/2. As n →∞the maps fn satisfy
fn(x) ∼
!
(4/3)nx
if x < 0 ,
(4/5)nx
if x > 0 .
Anyway for x ̸= 0
f(x) = lim
n→∞fn(x) = 0 .
Hence the sequence converges pointwise on R to the limit
f(x) =
 0
if x ̸= 0,
1/2
if x = 0.
The convergence is not uniform on R because the limit is not continuous on that
domain. But we do have uniform convergence on every set Aδ = (−∞, −δ] ∪
[δ, +∞), δ > 0, since

2. Notice fn(1) = fn(−1) = 0 for all n. For any x ∈(−1, 1) moreover, 1 −x2 < 1;
hence
lim
n→∞fn(x) = 0 ,
∀x ∈(−1, 1) .
Then the sequence converges to f(x) = 0 , ∀x ∈[−1, 1].
What about uniform convergence? For this we consider the odd maps fn, so it
suﬃces to take x ∈[0, 1]. Then
f ′
n(x) = n(1 −x2)n −2nx2(1 −x2)n−1 = n(1 −x2)n−1(1 −x2 −2nx2) ,
and fn(x) has a maximum point x = 1/√1 + 2n (and by symmetry a minimum
point x = −1/√1 + 2n). Therefore

From this argument the convergence cannot be uniform on the interval [0, 1] either,

we have pointwise convergence on R, but not uniform: the limit is not continuous
despite the fn are. Similarly, no uniform convergence on [0, 1]. Therefore, if we put
a = 0, it is not possible to exchange limit and integration automatically. Compute
the two sides of the equality independently:

Hence the equality holds even if the sequence does not converge uniformly on [0, 1].
If we take a = 1/2, instead, we have uniform convergence on [1/2, 1], so the
equality is true by Theorem 2.18.

k3 +
√
k

k3−x ,
k →∞.
The series is like the generalised harmonic series of exponent 3 −x, so it
converges if 3 −x > 1, hence x < 2, and diverges if 3 −x ≤1, so x ≥2.

Then the series converges if ex < 1, i.e., x < 0, and diverges if ex > 1, so
x > 0. If x = 0, the series diverges because the general term is always 1. The
convergence set is the half-line (−∞, 0).
c) If x = 1, the general term does not tend to 0 so the series cannot converge. If
x ̸= 1, as k →∞we have
fk(x) ∼

x−k
if x > 1,

In either case the series converges. Thus the convergence set is (0, +∞) \ {1}.
d) If |x| < 2, the convergence is absolute as |fk(x)| ∼

The set of convergence is (−2, 2).
e) Observe that
|fk(x)| ∼

k1−x ,

The series converges absolutely if 1 −x > 1, so x < 0. By Leibnitz’s Test, the
series converges pointwise if 0 < 1−x ≤1, i.e., 0 ≤x < 1. It does not converge
(it is indeterminate, actually) if x ≥1, since the general term does not tend
to 0. The convergence set is thus (−∞, 1).

Fourier series
The sound of a guitar, the picture of a footballer on tv, the trail left by an oil tanker
on the ocean, the sudden tremors of an earthquake are all examples of events, either
natural or caused by man, that have to do with travelling-wave phenomena. Sound
for instance arises from the swift change in air pressure described by pressure waves
that move through space. The other examples can be understood similarly using
propagating electromagnetic waves, water waves on the ocean’s surface, and elastic
waves within the ground, respectively.
The language of Mathematics represents waves by one or more functions that
model the physical object of concern, like air pressure, or the brightness of an
image’s basic colours; in general this function depends on time and space, for in-
stance the position of the microphone or the coordinates of the pixel on the screen.
If one ﬁxes the observer’s position in space, the wave appears as a function of the
time variable only, hence as a signal (acoustic, of light, . . . ). On the contrary, if we
ﬁx a moment in time, the wave will look like a collection of values in space of the
physical quantity represented (think of a picture still on the screen, a photograph
of the trail taken from a plane, and so on).
Propagating waves can have an extremely complicated structure; the desire to
understand and be able to control their behaviour in full has stimulated the quest
for the appropriate mathematical theories to analyse them, in the last centuries.
Generally speaking, this analysis aims at breaking down a complicated wave’s
structure in the superposition of simpler components that are easy to treat and
whose nature is well understood. According to such theories there will be a collec-
tion of ‘elementary waves’, each describing a speciﬁc and basic way of propagation.
Certain waves are obtained by superposing a ﬁnite number of elementary ones, yet
the more complex structures are given by an inﬁnite number of elementary waves,
and then the tricky problem arises – as always – of making sense of an inﬁnite
collection of objects and how to handle them.
The so-called Fourier Analysis is the most acclaimed and widespread frame-
work for describing propagating phenomena (and not only). In its simplest form,
Fourier Analysis considers one-dimensional signals with a given periodicity. The
elementary waves are sine functions characterised by a certain frequency, phase

and amplitude of oscillation. The composition of a ﬁnite number of elementary
waves generates trigonometric polynomials, whereas an inﬁnite number produces
a series of functions, called Fourier series. This is an extremely eﬃcient way of rep-
resenting in series a large class of periodic functions. This chapter introduces the
rudiments of Fourier Analysis through the study of Fourier series and the issues
of their convergence to a periodic map.
Beside standard Fourier Analysis, other much more sophisticated tools for ana-
lysing and representing functions have been developed, especially in the last dec-
ades of the XX century, among which the so-called Wavelet Analysis. Some of
those theories lie at the core of the recent, striking success of Mathematics in sev-
eral groundbreaking technological applications such as mobile phones, or digital
sound and image processing. Far from obfuscating the classical subject matter,
these latter-day developments highlight the importance of the standard theory as
foundational for all successive advancements.
3.1 Trigonometric polynomials
We begin by recalling periodic functions.
Deﬁnition 3.1 A map f : R →R is periodic of period T > 0 if
f(x + T ) = f(x) ,
∀x ∈R.
If f is periodic of period T it is also periodic of period kT , with k ∈N \ {0},
including that f might be periodic of period T/k, k ∈N \ {0}. The minimum
period of f is the smallest T (if existent) for which f is periodic. Moreover, f is
known when we know it on an interval [x0, x0 + T ) (or (x0, x0 + T ]) of length T .
Usually one chooses the interval [0, T ) or

−T
2 , T
2

. Note that if f is constant, it
is periodic of period T , for any T > 0.
Any map deﬁned on a bounded interval [a, b) can be prolonged to a periodic
function of period T = b −a, by setting
f(x + kT ) = f(x) ,
k ∈Z , ∀x ∈[a, b) .
Such prolongation is not necessarily continuous at the points x = a + kT , even if
the original function is.
Examples 3.2
i) The functions f(x) = cos x, g(x) = sin x are periodic of period 2kπ with
k ∈N \ {0}. Both have minimum period 2π.
ii) f(x) = cos x
4 is periodic of period 8π, 16π, . . .; its minimum period is 8π.
iii) The maps f(x) = cos ωx, g(x) = sin ωx, ω ̸= 0, are periodic with minimum
period T0 = 2π
ω .
iv) The mantissa map f(x) = M(x) is periodic of minimum period T0 = 1.

Proposition 3.3 Let f be periodic of period T > 0; for any x0 ∈R then,
 T

f(x) dx .
In particular, if x0 = −T/2,
 T

f(x) dx =
 T/2
−T/2
f(x) dx .
Proof.
By the properties of deﬁnite integrals,

f(x) dx =

f(x) dx +

The periodic function f(x) = a sin(ωx + φ), where a, ω,φ are constant, is
rather important for the sequel. It describes in Physics a special oscillation of sine
type, and goes under the name of simple harmonic. Its minimum period equals
T = 2π
ω and the latter’s reciprocal
ω
2π is the frequency, i.e., the number of wave
oscillations on each unit interval (oscillations per unit of time, if x denotes time);
ω is said angular frequency. The quantities a and φ are called amplitude and
phase (oﬀset) of the oscillation. Modifying a > 0 has the eﬀect of widening or
shrinking the range of f (the oscillation’s crests and troughs move apart or get
closer, respectively), while a positive or negative variation of φ translates the wave
left or right (Fig. 3.1). A simple harmonic can also be represented as a sin(ωx+φ) =

In the sequel we shall concentrate on periodic functions of period 2π because
all results can be generalised by a simple variable change, thanks to Proposition
3.4. (More details can be found in Sect. 3.6.)
The superposition of simple harmonics whose frequencies are all multiple of
one fundamental frequency, say 1/2π for simplicity, gives rise to trigonometric
polynomials.
Deﬁnition 3.5 A trigonometric polynomial of order or degree n is a
ﬁnite linear combination
P(x) = a0 + a1 cos x + b1 sin x + . . . + an cos nx + bn sin nx
= a0 +
n

k=1
(ak cos kx + bk sin kx) ,
where ak, bk are real constants and at least one of an, bn is non-zero. Rep-
resenting simple harmonics in terms of their amplitude and phase, a trigono-
metric polynomial can be written as
P(x) = a0 +
n

k=1
αk sin(kx + ϕk) .

3.2 Fourier Coeﬃcients and Fourier series
79
The name stems from the observation that each algebraic polynomial of degree
n in X and Y generates a trigonometric polynomial of the same degree n, by
substituting X = cos x, Y = sin x and using suitable trigonometric identities. For
example, p(X, Y ) = X3 + 2Y 2 gives
p(cos x, sin x) = cos3 x + 2 sin2 x
= cos x 1 + cos 2x

+ 2 1 −cos 2x

= 1 + 1
2 cos x −cos 2x + 1
4(cos x + cos 3x)
= 1 + 3
4 cos x −cos 2x + 1
4 cos 3x = P(x).
Obviously, not all periodic maps can be represented as trigonometric polynomials
(e.g., f(x) = esin x). At the same time though, certain periodic maps (that include
the functions appearing in applications) may be approximated, in a sense to be
made precise, by trigonometric polynomials: they can actually be expanded in
series of trigonometric polynomials. These functions are called Fourier series
and are the object of concern in this chapter.
3.2 Fourier Coeﬃcients and Fourier series
Although the theory of Fourier series can be developed in a very broad context,
we shall restrict to a subclass of all periodic maps (of period 2π), namely those
belonging to the space ˜C2π, which we will introduce in a moment. First though, a
few preliminary deﬁnitions are required.
Deﬁnition 3.6 A map f periodic of period 2π is piecewise continuous if
it is continuous on [0, 2π] except for at most a ﬁnite number of points x0. At
such points there can be a removable singularity or a singularity of the ﬁrst
kind, so the left and right limits
f(x+
0 ) = lim
x→x+
0
f(x)
and
f(x−
0 ) = lim
x→x−
0
f(x)
exist and are ﬁnite.
If, in addition,
f(x0) = 1
2

f(x+
0 ) + f(x−
0 )

,
(3.1)
at each discontinuity x0, f is called regularised.

80
3 Fourier series
Deﬁnition 3.7 We denote by ˜C2π the space of maps deﬁned on R that are
periodic of period 2π, piecewise continuous and regularised.
The set ˜C2π is an R-vector space (i.e., αf + βg ∈˜C2π for any α,β ∈R and all
f, g ∈˜C2π); it is not hard to show that given f, g ∈˜C2π, the expression
(f, g) =
 2π
0
f(x)g(x) dx
(3.2)
deﬁnes a scalar product on ˜C2π (we refer to Appendix A.2.1, p. 521, for the
general concept of scalar product and of norm of a function). In fact,
i) (f, f) ≥0 for any f ∈˜C2π, and (f, f) = 0 if and only if f = 0;
ii) (f, g) = (g, f), for any f, g ∈˜C2π;
iii) (αf + βg, h) = α(f, h) + β(g, h), for all f, g, h ∈˜C2π and any α,β ∈R.
The only non-trivial fact is that (f, f) = 0 forces f = 0. To see that, let x1, . . . , xn
be the discontinuity points of f in [0, 2π]; then
0 =
 2π
0
f 2(x) dx =
 x1
0
f 2(x) dx +
 x2
x1
f 2(x) dx + . . . +
 2π
xn
f 2(x) dx .
As f is continuous on every sub-interval (xi, xi+1), we get f(x) = 0 on each of
them. At last, f(xi) = 0 at each point of discontinuity, by (3.1).
Associated to the scalar product (3.2) is a norm
∥f∥2 = (f, f)1/2 =
  2π
0
|f(x)|2 dx
1/2
called quadratic norm. As any other norm, the quadratic norm enjoys the fol-
lowing characteristic properties:
i) ∥f∥2 ≥0 for any f ∈˜C2π and ∥f∥2 = 0 if and only if f = 0;
ii) ∥αf∥2 = |α| ∥f∥2, for all f ∈˜C2π and any α ∈R;
iii) ∥f + g∥2 ≤∥f∥2 + ∥g∥2, for any f, g ∈˜C2π.
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
|(f, g)| ≤∥f∥2 ∥g∥2 ,
∀f, g ∈˜C2π ,
(3.3)
holds.
Let us now recall that a family {fk} of non-zero maps in ˜C2π is said an ortho-
gonal system if
(fk, fℓ) = 0
for k ̸= ℓ.

if k ̸= ℓ.

∀k,ℓ≥0, k ̸= ℓ,

∀k,ℓ≥0 .
(3.6)
The above orthonormal system in ˜C2π plays the role of the canonical orthonor-
mal basis {ek} of Rn: each element in the vector space is uniquely writable as
linear combination of the elements of the system, with the diﬀerence that now
the linear combination is an inﬁnite series. Fourier series are precisely the expan-
sions in series of maps in ˜C2π, viewed as formal combinations of the orthonormal
system (3.5).
A crucial feature of this expansion is the possibility of approximating a map
by a linear combination of simple functions. Precisely, for any n ≥0 we consider
the (2n + 1)-dimensional subset Pn ⊂˜C2π of trigonometric polynomials of degree
≤n. This subspace is spanned by maps ϕk and ψk of F with index k ≤n, forming
a ﬁnite orthogonal system Fn. A “natural” approximation in Pn of a map of ˜C2π
is provided by its orthogonal projection on Pn.

and the coeﬃcients ak, bk become
ak = (f,ϕ k)
(ϕk, ϕk)
for k ≥0 ,
bk = (f,ψ k)
(ψk, ψk)
for k ≥1 .
(3.9)
There is an equivalent representation with respect to the ﬁnite orthonormal
system ˆFn made by the elements of ˆF of index k ≤n; in fact
Sn,f(x) =

where

similarly one proves bkψk(x) = ˆbk ˆψk(x).

3.2 Fourier Coeﬃcients and Fourier series
83
To understand the properties of the orthogonal projection of f on Pn, we stress
that the quadratic norm deﬁnes a distance on ˜C2π:
d(f, g) = ∥f −g∥2 ,
f, g ∈˜C2π .
(3.11)
The number ∥f −g∥2 measures how “close” f and g are. The expected properties
of distances hold:
i) d(f, g) ≥0 for any f, g ∈˜C2π, and d(f, g) = 0 precisely if f = g;
ii) d(f, g) = d(g, f), for all f, g ∈˜C2π;
iii) d(f, g) ≤d(f, h) + d(h, g), for any f, g, h ∈˜C2π.
The orthogonal projection of f on Pn enjoys therefore the following properties,
some of which are symbolically represented in Fig. 3.2.
Proposition 3.9 i) The function f −Sn,f is orthogonal to every element
of Pn, and Sn,f is the unique element of Pn with this property.
ii) Sn,f is the element in Pn with minimum distance to f with respect to
(3.11), i.e.,
∥f −Sn,f∥2 = min
P ∈Pn ∥f −P∥2 .
Hence Sn,f is the polynomial of Pn that best approximates f in quadratic
norm.

Proof.
This proposition transfers to ˜C2π the general properties of the orthogonal
projection of a vector, belonging to a vector space equipped with a dot
product, onto the subspace generated by a ﬁnite orthogonal system. For
the reader not familiar with such abstract notions, we provide an adapted
proof.

be a generic element of Pn. Then f −P is orthogonal to every element in
Pn if and only if, for any k ≤n,
(f −P,ϕ k) = 0
and
(f −P,ψ k) = 0 .
Using the orthogonality of ϕk, ψk, that is equivalent to
(f,ϕ k) −˜ak(ϕk, ϕk) = 0
and
(f,ψ k) −˜bk(ψk, ψk) = 0 .

Hence ˜ak = ak and ˜bk = bk for any k ≤n, recalling (3.9). In other words,
P = Sn,f.
To prove ii), note ﬁrst that
∥f + g∥2
2 = ∥f∥2
2 + ∥g∥2
2 + 2(f, g) ,
∀f, g ∈˜C2π
by deﬁnition of norm. Writing ∥f −P∥2 as ∥(f −Sn,f)+ (Sn,f −P)∥2, and
using the previous relationship with the fact that f −Sn,f is orthogonal
to Sn,f −P ∈Pn by i), we obtain
∥f −P∥2
2 = ∥f −Sn,f∥2
2 + ∥Sn,f −P∥2
2 ;
the equation is to be considered as a generalisation of Pythagoras’ Theorem
to spaces with a scalar product (Fig. 3.2). Then
∥f −P∥2
2 ≥∥f −Sn,f∥2

∀P ∈Pn ,
and equality holds if and only if Sn,f −P = 0 if and only if P = Sn,f. This
proves ii).

sequence Sn,f converges to f as n →∞. These are the partial sums of the series

(ak cos kx + bk sin kx) ,

3.2 Fourier Coeﬃcients and Fourier series
85
where the coeﬃcients ak, bk are given by (3.8). We are thus asking about the
convergence of the series.
Deﬁnition 3.10 The Fourier series of f ∈˜C2π is the series of functions
a0 +
∞

k=1
(ak cos kx + bk sin kx) ,
(3.13)
where a0, ak, bk (k ≥1) are the real numbers (3.8) and are called the Fourier
coeﬃcients of f. We shall write
f ≈a0 +
∞

k=1
(ak cos kx + bk sin kx) .
(3.14)
The symbol ≈means that the right-hand side of (3.14) represents the Fourier
series of f; more explicitly, the coeﬃcients ak and bk are prescribed by (3.8). Due
to the ample range of behaviours of a series (see Sect. 2.3), one should expect the
Fourier series of f not to converge at all, or to converge to a sum other than f.
That is why we shall use the equality sign in (3.14) only in case the series pointwise
converges to f. We will soon discuss suﬃcient conditions for the series to converge
in some way or another.
It is possible to deﬁne the Fourier series of a periodic, piecewise-continuous
but not-necessarily-regularised function. Its series coincides with the one of the
regularised function built from f.

3 Fourier series
3.3 Exponential form
The exponential form is an alternative, but equivalent, way of representing a Four-
ier series; it is more concise and sometimes easier to use, but the price for this is
that it requires complex numbers.
The starting point is the Euler identity (Vol. I, Eq. (8.31))
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ , θ
∈R ;
(3.15)
setting θ = ±kx, k ≥1 integer, we may write cos kx and sin kx as linear combin-
ations of the functions eikx, e−ikx:
cos kx = 1
2(eikx + e−ikx) ,
sin kx = 1
2i(eikx −e−ikx) .
On the other hand, 1 = ei0x trivially. Substituting in (3.14) and rearranging terms
yields
f ≈
+∞

k=−∞
ckeikx ,
(3.16)
where
c0 = a0 ,
ck = ak −ibk
2
,
c−k = ak + ibk
2
,
for k ≥1 .
(3.17)
It is an easy task to check
ck = 1
2π
 2π
0
f(x)e−ikx dx ,
k ∈Z .
Expression (3.16) represents the Fourier series of f in exponential form, and the
coeﬃcients ck are the complex Fourier coeﬃcients of f.
The complex Fourier series embodies the (formal) expansion of a function f ∈
˜C2π with respect to the orthogonal system of functions eikx, k ∈Z. In fact,
(eikx, eiℓx) = 2πδkl =
! 2π
if k = ℓ,
0
if k ̸= ℓ,
where
(f, g) =
 2π

f(x)g(x) dx
is deﬁned on ˜C∗
2π, the set of complex-valued maps f = fr + ifi : R →C whose real
part fr and imaginary part fi belong to ˜C2π.

3.4 Diﬀerentiation
89
For this system the complex Fourier coeﬃcients of f become
ck =
(f, eikx)
(eikx, eikx) ,
k ∈Z ,
(3.18)
in analogy to (3.9). Since this formula makes sense for all maps in ˜C∗
2π, equa-
tion (3.16) might deﬁne Fourier series on ˜C∗
2π as well.
It is straighforward that f ∈˜C∗
2π is a real map (fi = 0) if and only if its
complex Fourier coeﬃcients satisfy c−k = ck, for any k ∈Z. If so, the real Fourier
coeﬃcients of f are just
a0 = c0 ,
ak = ck + c−k ,
bk = i(ck −c−k) ,
for k ≥1 .
(3.19)
3.4 Diﬀerentiation
Consider the real Fourier series (3.13) and let us diﬀerentiate it (formally) term
by term. This gives
α0 +
∞

k=1
(αk cos kx + βk sin kx) ,
with
α0 = 0 ,
αk = kbk ,
βk = −kak ,
for k ≥1 .
(3.20)
Supposing f ∈˜C2π is C1 on R, in which case the derivative f ′ still belongs to
˜C2π, the previous expression coincides with the Fourier series of f ′. In fact,
α0 = 1
2π
 2π

f ′(x) dx = 1

and similarly, βk = −kak.
In summary,
f ′ ≈


k=1
(k bk cos kx −k ak sin kx) .
(3.21)
A similar reasoning shows that such representation holds under weaker hypotheses
on the diﬀerentiability of f, e.g., if f is piecewise C1 (see Deﬁnition 3.24).

90
3 Fourier series
The derivatives’ series becomes all the more explicit if we exploit the complex
form (3.16). From (3.15) in fact,
d
dθ eiθ = (−sin θ) + i cos θ = i(cosθ + i sin θ) = ieiθ .
Therefore
d
dx eikx = ikeikx ,
whence
f ′ ≈
+∞

k=−∞
ikckeikx .
If f is Cr on R, r ≥1, this fact generalises in the obvious way:
f (r) ≈
+∞

k=−∞
(ik)rckeikx ;
Thus, the kth complex Fourier coeﬃcient γk of the rth derivative of f is
γk = (ik)rck .
(3.22)
3.5 Convergence of Fourier series
This section is devoted to the convergence properties of the Fourier series of a
piecewise-continuous, periodic map of period 2π (not regularised necessarily). We
shall treat three kinds of convergence: quadratic, pointwise and uniform. We omit
the proofs of all theorems, due to their prevailingly technical nature1.
3.5.1 Quadratic convergence
We begin by the deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.14 Let f and fk, k ≥0, be square-integrable functions deﬁned
on a closed and bounded interval [a, b]. The series
∞

ratic norm to f on [a, b] if

hence, if the last expression is inﬁnitesimal as n →∞, so is the ﬁrst one.
Quadratic convergence of the Fourier series of a map in ˜C2π is guaranteed by
the next fundamental result, whose proof we omit.
Theorem 3.15 The Fourier series of f ∈˜C2π converges to f in quadratic
norm:
lim
n→+∞∥f −Sn,f∥2 = 0 .
Let us describe some consequences.
Corollary 3.16 Any f ∈˜C2π satisﬁes Parseval’s formula:
 2π

|f(x)|2 dx = 2πa2
0 + π
+∞

k=1

This is an easy corollary of the above theorem. By (3.12) in fact,

Corollary 3.17 (Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma) Given f ∈˜C2π,

Proof.
From Parseval’s identity (3.23) the series
∞

(a2

k) converges. Therefore
its general term a2
k + b2
k goes to zero as k →+∞, and the result follows. 2

while the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma says

Corollary 3.16 is useful to compute sums of numerical series.
Example 3.18
The map f(x) = x, deﬁned on (−π,π ) and prolonged by periodicity to all R
(sawtooth wave) (Fig. 3.5), has a simple Fourier series. The map is odd, so
ak = 0 for all k ≥0, and bk = 2
k (−1)k+1, hence
f ≈

We remark, at last, that additional assumptions of the regularity on f allow to
estimate the remainder of the Fourier series in terms of n, and furnish informations
on the speed at which the Fourier series tends to f in quadratic norm. For instance,
if f ∈˜C2π is Cr on R, r ≥1, it can be proved that
∥f −Sn,f∥2 ≤1
nr ∥f (r)∥2 .
This is coherent with what will happen in Sect. 3.5.4.
3.5.2 Pointwise convergence
We saw that the Fourier series of f ∈˜C2π converges to f in quadratic norm, so in a
suitable integral sense; this, though, does not warrant pointwise convergence. We
are thus left with the hard task of ﬁnding conditions that ensure pointwise con-
vergence: alas, not even assuming f continuous guarantees the Fourier series will
converge. On the other hand the uniform convergence of the Fourier series implies
pointwise convergence (see the remark after Deﬁnition 2.15). As the trigonometric
polynomials are continuous, uniform convergence still requires f be continuous (by
Theorem 2.17). We shall state, without proving them, some suﬃcient conditions
for the pointwise convergence of the Fourier series of a non-necessarily continuous
map. The ﬁrst ones guarantee convergence on the entire interval [0, 2π]. But before
that, we introduce a piece of notation.
Deﬁnition 3.19 i) A function f is called piecewise regular on an interval
[a, b] ⊂R in case
a) it is diﬀerentiable everywhere on [a, b] except at a ﬁnite number of points
at most;
b) it is piecewise continuous, together with its derivative f ′.
ii) f is piecewise monotone if the interval [a, b] can be divided in a ﬁnite
number of sub-intervals where f is monotone.

94
3 Fourier series
Theorem 3.20 Let f ∈˜C2π and suppose one of the following holds:
a) f is piecewise regular on [0, 2π];
b) f is piecewise monotone on [0, 2π].
Then the Fourier series of f converges pointwise to f on [0, 2π].
The theorem also holds under the assumption that f is not regularised; in such
a case (like for the square wave or the sawtooth function),
at a discontinuity point x0, the Fourier series converges to the regularised value
f(x−
0 ) + f(x+
0 )
2
of f, and not to f(x0).
Now let us see a local condition for pointwise convergence.
Deﬁnition 3.21 A
piecewise-continuous
map
admits
left
pseudo-
derivative and right pseudo-derivative at x0
∈R if the following
respective limits exist and are ﬁnite
f ′(x−
0 ) = lim

f(x) −f(x−
0 )
x −x0
,
f ′(x+
0 ) = lim
x→x+
0
f(x) −f(x+
0 )
x −x0
.
(Fig. 3.6 explains the geometric meaning of pseudo-derivatives.) If in addition f
is continuous at x0, the pseudo-derivatives are nothing else than the left and right
derivatives.
Note that a piecewise-regular function on [0, 2π] admits pseudo-derivatives at
each point of [0, 2π]; despite this, there are functions that are not piecewise regular
yet admit pseudo-derivatives everywhere in R (an example is f(x) = x2 sin 1
x, for
x ̸= 0, x ∈[−π,π ] and f(0) = 0).

3.5 Convergence of Fourier series
95
Theorem 3.22 Let f ∈˜C2π. If at x0 ∈[0, 2π] the left and right pseudo-
derivatives exist, the Fourier series of f at x0 converges to the (regularised)
value f(x0).
Example 3.23
Let us go back to the square wave of Example 3.11. Condition a) of Theorem
3.20 holds, so we have pointwise convergence on R. Looking at Fig. 3.3 we can
see a special behaviour around a discontinuity. If we take a neighbourhood of
x0 = 0, the x-coordinates of points closest to the maximum and minimum points
of the nth partial sum tend to x0 as n →∞, whereas the y-coordinates tend to
diﬀerent limits ℓ± ∼±1.18; the latter are not the limits f(0±) = ±1 of f at 0.
Such anomaly appears every time one considers a discontinuous map in ˜C2π, and
goes under the name of Gibbs phenomenon.
2
3.5.3 Uniform convergence
As already noted, there is no uniform convergence for the Fourier series of a dis-
continuous function, and we know that continuity is not suﬃcient (it does not
guarantee pointwise convergence either).
Let us then introduce a new class of maps.
Deﬁnition 3.24 A function f ∈˜C2π is piecewise C1 if it is continuous on
R and piecewise regular on [0, 2π].
The square wave is not piecewise C1 (since not continuous), in contrast to the
rectiﬁed wave.
We now state the following important theorem.
Theorem 3.25 Let f ∈˜C2π be piecewise C1. Its Fourier series converges
uniformly to f everywhere on R.
More generally, the following localization principle holds.
Theorem 3.26 Let f ∈˜C2π be piecewise regular on [0, 2π]. Its Fourier series
converges uniformly to f on any closed sub-interval where the map is continu-
ous.

96
3 Fourier series
Example 3.27
i) The rectiﬁed wave has uniformly convergent Fourier series on R (Fig. 3.4).
ii) The Fourier series of the square wave converges uniformly to the function on
every interval [ε,π −ε] or [π + ε, 2π −ε] (0 < ε < π /2), because the square wave
is piecewise regular on [0, 2π] and continuous on (0, π) and (π, 2π).
2
3.5.4 Decay of Fourier coeﬃcients
The equations of Sect. 3.4, relating the Fourier coeﬃcients of a map and its deriv-
atives, help to establish a link between the coeﬃcients’ asymptotic behaviour, as
|k| →∞, and the regularity of the function. For simplicity we consider complex
coeﬃcients. Let f ∈˜C2π be of class Cr on R, with r ≥1; from (3.22) we obtain,
for any k ̸= 0,
|ck| =
1
|k|r |γk| .
The sequence |γk| is bounded for |k| →∞; in fact, using (3.18) on f (r) gives
γk = (f (r), eikx)
(eikx, eikx) ;
the inequality of Schwarz tells
|γk| ≤∥f (r)∥2∥eikx∥2
∥eikx∥2
2
=
1
√
2∥f (r)∥2 .
Thus we have proved
|ck| = O
	 1
|k|r

as |k| →∞.
The result for real coeﬃcients, i.e.,
|ak|, |bk| = O
	 1
kr

for k →+∞,
is similarly found using (3.19) or a direct computation. In any case, if f has period
2π and is Cr on R, its Fourier coeﬃcients are inﬁnitesimal of order at least r with
respect to the test function 1/|k|.
Vice versa, it can be proved that the speed of decay of Fourier coeﬃcients
determines, in a suitable sense, the function’s regularity.
3.6 Periodic functions with period T > 0
In case a function f belongs to ˜CT , i.e., is deﬁned on R, piecewise continuous on
[0, T ], regularised and periodic of period T > 0, its Fourier series assumes the form

Mk converges (like the generalised harmonic series of exponent 3, because

pointwise. Alternatively, one could invoke Theorem 3.20.
Instead of computing directly the Fourier coeﬃcients of f ′ with the deﬁnition,
we shall check if the convergence is uniform for the derivatives’ Fourier series; thus,
we will be able to use Theorem 2.19. Actually one sees rather immediately f is
C1(R) with
f ′(x) =

if π

while f ′ is piecewise C1 on R (f ′′ has a jump discontinuity at ± π

Functions between Euclidean spaces
This chapter sees the dawn of the study of multivariable and vector-valued func-
tions, that is, maps between the Euclidean spaces Rn and Rm or subsets thereof,
with one of n and m bigger than 1. Subsequent chapters treat the relative diﬀer-
ential and integral calculus and constitute a large part of the course.
To warm up we brieﬂy recall the main notions related to vectors and matrices,
which students should already be familiar with. Then we review the indispensable
topological foundations of Euclidean spaces, especially neighbourhood systems of
a point, open and closed sets, and the boundary of a set. We discuss the properties
of subsets of Rn, which naturally generalise those of real intervals, highlighting the
features of this richer, higher-dimensional landscape.
We then deal with the continuity features of functions and their limits; despite
these extend the ones seen in dimension one, they require particular care, because
of the subtleties and snags speciﬁc to the multivariable setting.
At last, we start exploring a remarkable class of functions describing one- and
two-dimensional geometrical objects – present in our everyday life – called curves
and surfaces. The careful study of curves and surfaces will continue in the second
part of Chapter 6, at which point the diﬀerential calculus apparatus will be avail-
able. The aspects connected to integral calculus will be postponed to Chapter 9.
4.1 Vectors in Rn
Recall Rn is the vector space of ordered n-tuples x = (xi)i=1,...,n, called vectors.
The components xi of x may be written either horizontally, to give a row vector
x = (x1, . . . , xn) ,
or vertically, producing a column vector
x =
⎛
⎝
x1
...
xn
⎞
⎠= (x1, . . . , xn)T .

4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
These two expressions will be equivalent in practice, except for some cases where
writing vertically or horizontally will make a diﬀerence. For typesetting reasons
the horizontal notation is preferable.
Any vector of Rn can be represented using the canonical basis {e1, . . . , en}
whose vectors have components all zero except for one that equals 1
ei = (δij)1≤j≤n
where δij =

1
if i = j
0
if i ̸= j
.
(4.1)
Then
x =
n

i=1
xiei .
(4.2)
The vectors of the canonical basis are usually denoted by i, j in R2 and i, j, k in
R3. It can be useful to identify a vector (x1, x2) = x1i + x2j ∈R2 with the vector
(x1, x2, 0) = x1i + x2j + 0 k ∈R3: the expression x1i + x2j will thus indicate a
vector of R2 or R3, according to the context.
In Rn the dot product of two vectors is deﬁned as
x · y = x1y1 + . . . + xnyn =
n

i=1
xiyi .
This in turn deﬁnes the Euclidean norm
∥x∥= √x · x =
+
,
,
-
n

i=1
x2
i ,
for which the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
|x · y| ≤∥x∥∥y∥
(4.3)
and the triangle inequality
∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥
(4.4)
hold. Two vectors x and y satisfying x · y = 0 are called orthogonal, and a
vector x such that ∥x∥= 1 is said a unit vector, or of length 1. The canonical
basis of Rn is an example of an orthonormal system of vectors, i.e., a set of n
normalised and pairwise orthogonal vectors; its elements satisfy in fact
ei · ej = δij ,
1 ≤i, j ≤n .
From (4.2) we have
xi = x · ei
for the ith component of a vector x.
It makes sense to associate x ∈Rn to the unique point P in Euclidean n-
space whose coordinates in an orthogonal Cartesian frame are the components of

4.1 Vectors in Rn

x; this fact extends what we already know for the plane and space. Under this
identiﬁcation ∥x∥is the Euclidean distance between the point P, of coordinates
x, and the origin O. The quantity ∥x −y∥=

(x1 −y1)2 + . . . + (xn −yn)2 is
the distance between the points P and Q of respective coordinates x and y.
In R3 the cross or wedge product x ∧y of two vectors x = x1i + x2j + x3k
and y = y1i + y2j + y3k is the vector of R3 deﬁned by
x ∧y = (x2y3 −x3y2)i + (x3y1 −x1y3)j + (x1y2 −x2y1)k .
(4.5)
It can also be computed by the formula
x ∧y = det
⎛
⎝
i
j
k
x1
x2
x3
y1
y2
y3
⎞
⎠
(4.6)
by expanding the determinant formally along the ﬁrst row (see deﬁnition (4.11)).
The cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to both (Fig. 4.1, left):
(x ∧y) · x = 0 ,
(x ∧y) · y = 0 .
(4.7)
The number ∥x∧y∥is the area of the parallelogram with the vectors x, y as sides,
while ∥(x ∧y) · z∥represents the volume of the prism of sides x, y, z (Fig. 4.1).
We have some properties:
y ∧x = −(x ∧y) ,
x ∧y = 0
⇐⇒
x = λy for some λ ∈R ,
(x + y) ∧z = x ∧z + y ∧z ,
(4.8)
the ﬁrst of which implies x ∧x = 0.
Furthermore,
i ∧j = k ,
j ∧k = i ,
k ∧i = j ;
these and previous ones prove for instance that if x = x1i + x2j, y = y1i + y2j
then x ∧y = (x1y2 −x2y1)k.

4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
A triple (v1, v2, v3) of pairwise non-aligned, unit vectors is said positively
oriented (or right-handed) if
(v1 ∧v2) · v3 > 0 ,
i.e., if v3 and v1 ∧v2 lie on the same side of the plane spanned by v1 and v2. A
practical way to decide whether a triple is positively oriented is to use the right-
hand rule: the pointing ﬁnger is v1, the long ﬁnger v2, the thumb v3. (The left
hand works, too, as long as we take the long ﬁnger for v1, the pointing ﬁnger for
v2 and the thumb for v3.)
The triple (v1, v2, v3) is negatively oriented (or left-handed) if (v1, v2, −v3)
is oriented positively
(v1 ∧v2) · v3 < 0 .
4.2 Matrices
A real matrix A with m rows and n columns (an m × n matrix) is a collection of
m × n real numbers arranged in a table
A =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
a11
a12
. . .
a1n
a21

amn
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠
or, more concisely,
A = (aij) 1≤i≤m
1≤j ≤n
∈Rmn .
The vectors formed by the entries of one row (resp. column) of A are the row
vectors (column vectors) of A. Thus m × 1 matrices are vectors of Rm written as
column vectors, while 1 × n matrices are vectors of Rn seen as row vectors. When
m = n the matrix is called square of order n. The set of m × n matrices is a
vector space: usually indicated by Rm,n, it is isomorphic to the Euclidean space
Rmn. The matrix C = λA + μB, λ, μ ∈R, has entries
cij = λaij + μbij ,
1 ≤i ≤m , 1 ≤j ≤n .
If A is m × n and B is n × p, the product C = AB has by deﬁnition m rows and
p columns; its generic entry is the dot product of a row vector of A with a column
vector of B:
cij =
n

k=1
aikbkj ,
1 ≤i ≤m , 1 ≤j ≤p .
In particular, if B = x is n × 1, hence a column vector in Rn, the matrix product
with the vector Ax is well deﬁned: it is a column vector in Rm. If p = m, we have

4.2 Matrices
115
square matrices AB of order m and BA of order n. If n = m, AB ̸= BA in
general, because the product of matrices is not commutative.
The ﬁrst minor Aij (1 ≤i ≤m, 1 ≤j ≤n) of an m × n matrix A is the
(m −1) × (n −1) matrix obtained erasing from A the ith row and jth column.
The rank r ≤min(m, n) of A is the maximum number of linearly independent
rows thought of as vectors of Rn (or linearly independent columns, seen as vectors
of Rm).
Given an m × n matrix A, its transpose is the n × m matrix AT with entries
aT
ij = aji ,
1 ≤i ≤n , 1 ≤j ≤m ;
otherwise put, AT is obtained from A by orderly swapping rows and columns;
clearly, (AT )T = A. Whenever deﬁned, the product of matrices satisﬁes (AB)T =
BT AT . The dot product of vectors in Rn is a special case of matrix product
x · y = xT y = yT x, provided we think x and y as column vectors.
In Rm,n there is a norm, associated to the Euclidean norm,
∥A∥= max{∥Ax∥: x ∈Rn, ∥x∥= 1} ,
(4.9)
that satisﬁes the inequalities
∥Ax∥≤∥A∥∥x∥
and
∥AB∥≤∥A∥∥B∥
(4.10)
for any x ∈Rn and B ∈Rn,p.
Square matrices
From now on we will consider square matrices of order n. Among them a par-
ticularly important one is the identity matrix I = (δij)1≤i,j≤n, which satisﬁes
AI = IA = A for any square matrix A of order n. A matrix A is called sym-
metric if it coincides with its transpose
aij = aji ,
1 ≤i, j ≤n ;
it is normal if AAT = AT A, and in particular orthogonal if AAT = AT A = I.
To each square matrix A one can associate a number det A, the determinant
of A, which may be computed recursively using Laplace’s rule: det A = a if n = 1
and A = (a), whereas for n > 1
det A =
n

j=1
(−1)i+jaij det Aij ,
(4.11)
where i ∈{1, . . . , n} is arbitrary, but ﬁxed. For instance
det
	
a
b

d

= ad −bc .

116
4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
The following properties hold:
det(AB) = det A det B ,
det(λA) = λn det A ,
det AT = det A ,
det A′ = −det A
if A′ is A with two rows (or columns) exchanged. Immediate consequences are
that det I = 1 and | det A| = 1 for A orthogonal.
The matrix A is said non-singular if det A ̸= 0. This is equivalent to the
invertibility of A, i.e., the existence of a matrix A−1 of order n, called the inverse
of A, such that
AA−1 = A−1A = I .
If A and B are invertible,
det(A−1) = (det A)−1 ,
(AB)−1 = B−1A−1 ,
(AT )−1 = (A−1)T ;
from the last equation it follows, as special case, that the inverse of a symmetric
matrix is still symmetric. Every orthogonal matrix A is invertible, for A−1 = AT .
There are several equivalent conditions to invertibility, among which:
•
the rank of A equals n;
•
the linear system Ax = b has a solution x ∈Rn for any b ∈Rn;
•
the homogeneous linear system Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution x = 0.
The last one amounts to saying that 0 is no eigenvalue of A.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
The eigenvalues of A are the zeroes (in C) of the characteristic polynomial
of degree n
χ(λ) = det(A −λI) .
In other words, the eigenvalues are complex numbers λ for which there exists a
vector v ̸= 0, called (right) eigenvector of A associated to λ, such that
Av = λv
(4.12)
(here and henceforth all vectors should be thought of as column vectors). The
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra predicts the existence of p distinct eigenvalues
λ(1), . . . , λ(p) with 1 ≤p ≤n, each having algebraic multiplicity (as root of the
polynomial χ) μ(i), such that μ(1) + . . . + μ(p) = n. The maximum number of
linearly independent eigenvectors associated to λ(i) is the geometric multiplicity
of λ(i); we denote it by m(i), and observe m(i) ≤μ(i). Eigenvectors associated to
distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent. Therefore when the algebraic and
geometric multiplicities of each eigenvalue coincide, there are in total n linearly
independent eigenvectors, and thus a basis made of eigenvectors. In such a case
the matrix is diagonalisable.
The name means that the matrix can be made diagonal. To see this we number
the eigenvalues by λk, 1 ≤k ≤n for convenience, repeating each one as many times

4.2 Matrices
117
as its multiplicity; let vk be an eigenvector associated to λk, chosen so that the
set {vk}1≤k≤n is made of linearly independent vectors. The equations
Avk = λkvk ,
1 ≤k ≤n ,
can be rewritten in matrix form
AP = P Λ ,
(4.13)
where Λ = diag (λ1, . . . , λn) is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues as entries,
and P = (v1, . . . , vn) is the square matrix of order n whose columns are the
eigenvectors of A. The linear independence of the eigenvectors is equivalent to the
invertibility of P , so that (4.13) becomes
A = P Λ P−1 ,
(4.14)
and consequently A is similar to a diagonal matrix.
Returning to the general setting, it is relevant to notice that as A is a real
matrix (making the characteristic polynomial a real polynomial), its eigenvalues
are either real or complex conjugate; the same is true for the corresponding eigen-
vectors. The determinant of A coincides with the product of the eigenvalues
det A = λ1λ2 · · · λn−1λn .
The eigenvalues of A2 = AA are the squares of those of A, with the same eigen-
vectors, and the analogue fact will hold for the generic power of A. At the same
time, if A is invertible, the eigenvalues of the inverse matrix are the inverses of
the eigenvalues of A, while the eigenvectors stay the same; by assumption in fact,
(4.12) is equivalent to
v = λA−1v ,
so
A−1v = 1
λv .
The spectral radius of A is by deﬁnition the maximum modulus of the ei-
genvalues
ρ(A) = max
1≤k≤n |λk| .
The (Euclidean) norm of A satisﬁes
∥A∥=
#
ρ(AT A) ;
a special case is that of symmetric matrices A, for which ∥A∥= ρ(A); if A is
additionally orthogonal, then ∥A∥=

ρ(I) = 1.
Symmetric matrices
Symmetric matrices A have pivotal properties concerning eigenvalues and eigen-
vectors. Each eigenvalue is real and its algebraic and geometric multiplicities coin-
cide, rendering A always diagonalisable. The eigenvectors, all real, may be chosen

118
4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
to form an orthonormal basis (in fact, eigenvectors relative to distinct eigenvalues
are orthogonal, those with same eigenvalue can be made orthonormal); the matrix
P associated to such a basis is thus orthogonal, so (4.14) reads
A = P Λ PT .
(4.15)
Hence the transformation x →P T x = y deﬁnes an orthogonal change of basis in
Rn, from the canonical basis {ei}1≤i≤n to the basis of eigenvectors {vk}1≤k≤n; in
this latter basis A is diagonal. The inverse transformation is y →P y = x.
Every real symmetric matrix A is associated to a quadratic form Q, which
is a function Q : Rn →R satisfying Q(λx) = λ2Q(x) for any x ∈Rn, λ ∈R; to
be precise,
Q(x) = 1
2x · Ax = 1
2xT Ax .
(4.16)
The eigenvalues of A determine the quadratic form Q: substituting to A the
expression (4.15) and setting y = P T x, we get
Q(x) = 1
2xT P Λ PT x = 1
2(P T x)T Λ(P T x) = 1
2yT Λy .
Since Λy = (λkyk)1≤k≤n if y = (yk)1≤k≤n, we conclude
Q(x) = 1
2
n

k=1
λky2
k .
(4.17)
Consequently, one can classify A according to the sign of Q:
•
A is positive deﬁnite if Q(x) > 0 for any x ∈Rn, x ̸= 0; equivalently, all
eigenvalues of A are strictly positive.
•
A is positive semi-deﬁnite if Q(x) ≥0 for any x ∈Rn; equivalently, all
eigenvalues of A are non-negative.
•
A is indeﬁnite if Q assumes on Rn both positive and negative values; this is
to say A has positive and negative eigenvalues.
The notion of negative-deﬁnite and negative semi-deﬁnite matrices are clear.
Positive-deﬁnite symmetric matrices may be characterised in many other equi-
valent ways. For example, all ﬁrst minors of A (those obtained by erasing the same
rows and columns) have positive determinant. In particular, the diagonal entries
aii are positive.
A crucial geometrical characterisation is the following: if A is positive deﬁnite
and symmetric, the level sets
{x ∈Rn : Q(x) = c > 0}
of Q are generalised ellipses (e.g., ellipses in dimension 2, ellipsoids in dimension
3), with axes collinear to the eigenvectors of A.

4.3 Sets in Rn and their properties
The study of limits and the continuity of functions of several variables require that
we introduce some notions on vectors and subsets of Rn.
Using distances we deﬁne neighbourhoods in Rn.
Deﬁnition 4.2 Take x0 ∈Rn and let r > 0 be a real number. One calls
neighbourhood of x0 of radius r the set
Br(x0) = {x ∈Rn : ∥x −x0∥< r}
consisting of all points in Rn with distance from x0 smaller than r. The set
Br(x0) = {x ∈Rn : ∥x −x0∥≤r}
is called closed neighbourhood of x0 of radius r.
Therefore Br(x0) is the disc (n = 2) or the ball (n = 3) centred at x0 of radius r,
while Br(x0) is a disc or ball without boundary.
If X is a subset of Rn, by C X = Rn \ X we denote the complement of X.
Deﬁnition 4.3 A point x ∈Rn is called
i) an interior point of X if there is a neighbourhood Br(x) contained in
X;
ii) an exterior point of X if it belongs to the interior of C X;
iii) a boundary point of X if it is neither interior nor exterior for X.
Fig. 4.3 depicts the various possibilities.
Boundary points can also be deﬁned as the points whose every neighbourhood
contains points of X and C X alike. It follows that X and its complement have
the same boundary set.
Deﬁnition 4.4 The set of interior points of X forms the interior of X,
denoted by
◦
X or int X. Similarly, boundary points form the boundary of
X, written ∂X. Exterior points form the exterior of X. Eventually, the set
X ∪∂X is the closure of X, written X.
To be absolutely accurate, given a topological space X the set ∂X deﬁned above
should be called ‘frontier’, because the term ‘boundary’ is used in a diﬀerent sense
for topological manifolds (deﬁning the topology of which is a rather delicate mat-

ter). Section 6.7.3 will discuss explicit examples where X is a surface. We shall
not be this subtle and always speak about the boundary ∂X of X.
From the deﬁnition,
◦
X ⊆X ⊆X .
When one of the above inclusions is an equality the space X deserves one of the
following names:
Deﬁnition 4.5 The set X is open if all its points are interior points,
◦
X =
X. It is closed if it contains its boundary, X = X.
A set is then open if and only if it contains a neighbourhood of each of its points,
i.e., when it does not contain boundary points. Consequently, X is closed precisely
if its complement is open, since a set and its complement share the boundary.
Examples 4.6
i) The sets Rn and ∅are simultaneously open and closed (and are the only such
subsets of Rn, by the way). Their boundary is empty.
ii) The half-plane X = {(x, y) ∈R2 : x > 1} is open. In fact, given (x0, y0) ∈X,
any neighbourhood of radius r ≤x0 −1 is contained in X (Fig. 4.4, left). The
boundary ∂X is the line x = 1 parallel to the y-axis (Fig. 4.4, right), hence the
complementary set C X = {(x, y) ∈R2 : x ≤1} is closed.
Any half-plane X ⊂R2 deﬁned by an inequality like
ax + by > c
or
ax + by < c ,
with one of a, b non-zero, is open; inequalities like
ax + by ≥c
or
ax + by ≤c
deﬁne closed half-planes. In either case the boundary ∂X is the line ax + by = c.

iii) Let X = B1(0) = {x ∈Rn : ∥x∥< 1} be the n-dimensional ball with centre
the origin and radius 1, without boundary. It is open, because for any x0 ∈X,
Br(x0) ⊆X if we set r ≤1 −∥x0∥: for ∥x −x0∥< r in fact, we have
∥x∥= ∥x −x0 + x0∥≤∥x −x0∥+ ∥x0∥< 1 −∥x0∥+ ∥x0∥= 1 .
The boundary ∂X = {x ∈Rn : ∥x∥= 1} is the ‘surface’ of the ball (the
n-dimensional sphere), while the closure of X is the ball itself, i.e., the closed
neighbourhood B1(0).
In general, for arbitrary x0 ∈Rn and r > 0, the neighbourhood Br(x0) is open,
it has boundary {x ∈Rn : ∥x−x0∥= r}, and the closed neighbourhood Br(x0)
is the closure.
iv) The set X = {x ∈Rn : 2 ≤∥x −x0∥< 3} (an annulus for n = 2, a spherical
shell for n = 3) is neither open nor closed, for its interior is
◦
X = {x ∈Rn : 2 < ∥x −x0∥< 3}
and the closure
X = {x ∈Rn : 2 ≤∥x −x0∥≤3} .
The boundary,
∂X = {x ∈Rn : ∥x −x0∥= 2} ∪{x ∈Rn : ∥x −x0∥= 3} ,
is the union of the two spheres delimiting X.
v) The set X = [0, 1]2 ∩Q2 of points with rational coordinates inside the unit
square has empty interior and the whole square [0, 1]2 as boundary. Since rational
numbers are dense in R, any neighbourhood of a point in [0, 1]2 contains inﬁnitely
many points of X and inﬁnitely many of the complement.

Interior points of X are certainly limit points in X, whereas no exterior point can
be a limit point. A boundary point of X must necessarily be either a limit point
of X (belonging to X or not) or an isolated point. Conversely, a limit point can
be interior or a non-isolated boundary point, and an isolated point is forced to lie
on the boundary.
Example 4.8
Consider X the set X = {(x, y) ∈R2 : y2
x2 ≤1 or x2 + (y −1)2 ≤0} .
Requiring
y2
x2 ≤1, hence
|y|
|x| ≤1, deﬁnes the region lying between the lines
y = ±x (included) and containing the x-axis except the origin (due to the
denominator). To this we have to add the point (0, 1), the unique solution to
x2 + (y −1)2 ≤0. See Fig. 4.5.
The limit points of X are those satisfying y2 ≤x2. They are either interior, when
y2 < x2, or boundary points, when y = ±x (origin included). An additional
boundary point is (0, 1), also the only isolated point.

Let us deﬁne a few more notions that will be useful in the sequel.
Deﬁnition 4.9 A set X is bounded if there exists a real number R > 0
such that
∥x∥≤R ,
∀x ∈X ,
i.e., if X is contained in a closed neighbourhood BR(0) of the origin.
Deﬁnition 4.10 A set X is said compact if it is closed and bounded.
Examples 4.11
i) The unit square X = [0, 1]2 ⊂R2 is compact; it manifestly contains its bound-
ary, and if we take x ∈X,
∥x∥=
#
x2
1 + x2
2 ≤
√
1 + 1 =

2 .
In general, the n-dimensional cube X = [0, 1]n ⊂Rn is compact.
ii) The elementary plane ﬁgures (such as rectangles, polygons, discs, ovals) and
solids (tetrahedra, prisms, pyramids, cones and spheres) are all compact.
iii) The closure of a bounded set is compact.
2
Let a , b be distinct points of Rn, and call S[a, b] the (closed) segment with
end points a, b, i.e., the set of points on the line through a and b that lie between
the two points:
S[a, b] = {x = a + t(b −a) : 0 ≤t ≤1}
= {x = (1 −t)a + tb : 0 ≤t ≤1} .
(4.19)
Deﬁnition 4.12 A set X is called convex if the segment between any two
points of X is all contained in X.
Given r +1 points a0, a1, . . . , ar in Rn, all distinct (except possibly for a0 = ar),
one calls polygonal path of vertices a0, a1, . . . , ar the union of the r segments
S[ai−1, ai], 1 ≤i ≤r, joint at the end points:
P[a0, . . . , ar] =
r0
i=1
S[ai−1, ai] .
Deﬁnition 4.13 An open set A ⊆Rn is (path-)connected if, given two
arbitrary points x, y in A, there is a polygonal path joining them that is
entirely contained in A.
Figure 4.6 shows an example.

ii) An open and convex set A in Rn is obviously connected.
iii) Any annulus A = {x ∈R2 : r1 < ∥x −x0∥< r2}, with x0 ∈R2, r2 > r1 ≥0,
is connected but not convex (Fig. 4.7, left). Finding a polygonal path between
any two points x, y ∈A is intuitively quite easy.
iv) The open set A = {x = (x, y) ∈R2 : xy > 1} is not connected (Fig. 4.7,
right).

It is a basic fact that an open non-empty set A of Rn is the union of a family
{Ai}i∈I of non-empty, connected and pairwise-disjoint open sets:
A =

with
Ai ∩Aj = ∅for i ̸= j .
Each Ai is called a connected component of A.

4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
Every open connected set has only one connected component, namely itself.
The set A of Example 4.14 iv) has two connected components
A1 = {x = (x, y) ∈A : x > 0}
and
A2 = {x = (x, y) ∈A : x < 0} .
Deﬁnition 4.15 We call region any subset R of Rn made by the union of
a non-empty, open, connected set A and part of the boundary ∂A
R = A ∪Z
with
∅⊆Z ⊆∂A .
When Z = ∅the region is open, when Z = ∂A it is closed.
A region may be deﬁned equivalently as a non-empty set R of Rn whose interior
A =
◦
R is connected and such that A ⊆R ⊆A.
Example 4.16
The set R = {x ∈R2 :

4 −x2 −y2 < 1} is a region in the plane, for
R = {x ∈R2 :
√
3 < ∥x∥≤2} .
Therefore A =

R is the open annulus {x ∈R2 :
√

R2 : ∥x∥= 2} ⊂∂A.

4.4 Functions: deﬁnitions and ﬁrst examples
We begin discussing real-valued maps, sometimes called (real) scalar functions.
Let n be a given integer ≥1. A function f deﬁned on Rn with values in R is a
real function of n real variables; if dom f denotes its domain, we write
f : dom f ⊆Rn →R .
The graph Γ(f) = {(x, f(x)) ∈Rn+1 : x ∈dom f} is a subset of Rn+1.
The case n = 1 (one real variable) was dealt with in Vol. I exhaustively, so in
the sequel we will consider scalar functions of two or more variables. If n = 2 or 3
the variable x will also be written as (x, y) or (x, y, z), respectively.
Examples 4.17
i) The map z = f(x, y) = 2x −3y, deﬁned on R2, has the plane 2x −3y −z = 0
as graph.
ii) The function z = f(x, y) = y2 + x2
y2 −x2 is deﬁned on R2 without the lines y = ±x.
iii) The function w = f(x, y, z) =

z −x2 −y2 has domain dom f = {(x, y, z) ∈
R3 : z ≥x2 + y2}, which is made of the elliptic paraboloid z = x2 + y2 and the
region inside of it.

n = 1, since dom f =

In principle, a scalar function can be drawn only when n ≤2. For example,
f(x, y) =

9 −x2 −y2 has graph in R3 given by z =

9 −x2 −y2. Squaring the
equation yields
z = 9 −x2 −y2
hence
x2 + y2 + z2 = 9 .
We recognise the equation of a sphere with centre the origin and radius 3. As
z ≥0, the graph of f is the hemisphere of Fig. 4.8.
Another way to visualise a function’s behaviour, in two or three variables, is
by ﬁnding its level sets. Given a real number c, the level set
L(f, c) = {x ∈dom f : f(x) = c}
(4.20)
is the subset of Rn where the function is constant, equal to c. Figure 4.9 shows
some level sets for the function z = f(x, y) of Example 4.9 ii).
Geometrically, in dimension n = 2, a level set is the projection on the xy-plane
of the intersection between the graph of f and the plane z = c. Clearly, L(f, c) is
not empty if and only if c ∈im f. A level set may have an extremely complicated
shape. That said, we shall see in Sect. 7.2 certain assumptions on f that guarantee
L(f, c) consists of curves (dimension two) or surfaces (dimension three).
Consider now the more general situation of a map between Euclidean spaces,
and precisely: given integers n, m ≥1, we denote by f an arbitrary function on
Rn with values in Rm
f : dom f ⊆Rn →Rm .

If m = 1, we have the scalar functions of above. If m ≥2 we shall say f is a real
vector-valued function.
Let us see some interesting cases. Curves, seen in Vol. I for m = 2 (plane
curves) and m = 3 (curves in space), are special vector-valued maps where n = 1;
surfaces in space are vector-valued functions with n = 2 and m = 3. The study of
curves and surfaces is postponed to Sects. 4.6, 4.7 and Chapter 6 in particular. In
the case n = m, f is called a vector ﬁeld. An example with n = m = 3 is the
Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld.
Let fi, 1 ≤i ≤m, be the components of f with respect to the canonical basis
{ei}1≤i≤m of Rm:
f(x) =

fi(x)

1≤i≤m =
m

i=1
fi(x)ei .
Each fi is a real scalar function of one or more real variables, deﬁned on dom f
at least; actually, dom f is the intersection of the domains of the components of f.
Examples 4.18
i) Consider the vector ﬁeld on R2
f(x, y) = (−y, x) .
The best way to visualise a two-dimensional ﬁeld is to draw the vector cor-
responding to f(x, y) as position vector at the point (x, y). This is clearly not
possible everywhere on the plane, but a suﬃcient number of points might still
give a reasonable idea of the behaviour of f. Since f(1, 0) = (0, 1), we draw
the vector (0, 1) at the point (1, 0); similarly, we plot the vector (−1, 0) at (0, 1)
because f(0, 1) = (−1, 0) (see Fig. 4.10, left).
Notice that each vector is tangent to a circle centred at the origin. In fact, the
dot product of the position vector x = (x, y) with f(x) is zero:
x · f(x) = (x, y) · (−y, x) = −xy + xy = 0 ,

making x and f(x) orthogonal vectors. Additionally, ∥f(x)∥= ∥x∥, so the
length of f(x, y) coincides with the circle’s radius.
This vector ﬁeld represents the velocity of a wheel spinning counter-clockwise.
ii) Vector ﬁelds in R3 can be understood in a similar way. Figure 4.10, right,
shows a picture of the vector ﬁeld
f(x, y, z) = (0, 0, z) .
All vectors are vertical, and point upwards if they lie above the xy-plane, down-
wards if below the plane z = 0. The magnitude increases as we move away from
the xy-plane.
iii) Imagine a ﬂuid running through a pipe with velocity f(x, y, z) at the point
(x, y, z). The function f assignes a vector to each pont (x, y, z) in a certain
domain Ω (the region inside the pipe) and so is a vector ﬁeld of R3, called the
velocity vector ﬁeld. A concrete example is in Fig. 4.11.

4.5 Continuity and limits
The notion of continuity for functions between Euclidean spaces is essentially the
same as what we have seen for one-variable functions (Vol. I, Ch. 3), with the
proviso that the absolute value of R must be replaced by an arbitrary norm in Rn
or Rm (which we shall indicate with ∥· ∥for simplicity).
Deﬁnition 4.19 A function f : dom f ⊆Rn →Rm is said continuous at
x0 ∈dom f if for any ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that
∀x ∈dom f,
∥x −x0∥< δ
⇒
∥f(x) −f(x0)∥< ε ;
that is to say,
∀x ∈dom f,
x ∈Bδ(x0)
⇒
f(x) ∈Bε(f(x0)).
A map f is continuous on a set Ω ⊆dom f if it is continuous at each point
x ∈Ω.
The following result is used a lot to study the continuity of vector-valued func-
tions. Its proof is left to the reader.
Proposition 4.20 The map f = (fi)1≤i≤m is continuous at x0 ∈dom f if
and only if all its components fi are continuous.
Due to this result we shall merely provide some examples of scalar functions.
Examples 4.21
i) Let us verify f : R2 →R, f(x) = 2x1 + 5x2 is continuous at x0 = (3, 1). Using
the fact that |yi| ≤∥y∥for all i (mentioned earlier), we have
|f(x) −f(x0)| = |2(x1 −3) + 5(x2 −1)| ≤2|x1 −3| + 5|x2 −1| ≤7∥x −x0∥.

4.5 Continuity and limits
131
Given ε > 0 then, it is enough to choose δ = ε/7 to conclude. The same argument
shows f is continuous at each x0 ∈R2.
ii) The above function is an aﬃne map f : Rn →R, i.e., a map of type f(x) =
a · x + b (a ∈Rn, b ∈R). Aﬃne maps are continuous at each x0 ∈Rn because
|f(x) −f(x0)| = |a · x −a · x0| = |a · (x −x0)| ≤∥a∥∥x −x0∥
(4.21)
by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (4.3).
If a = 0, the result is trivial. If a ̸= 0, continuity holds if one chooses δ = ε/∥a∥
for any given ε > 0.
2
The map f is uniformly continuous on Ω if we may choose δ independently
of x0 in the above deﬁnition; this is made precise as follows.
Deﬁnition 4.22 A function is said uniformly continuous on Ω ⊆dom f
if for any ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that
∀x′, x′′ ∈Ω,
∥x′ −x′′∥< δ
⇒
∥f(x′) −f(x′′)∥< ε .
(4.22)
For instance, the above aﬃne function f is uniformly continuous on Rn.
A continuous function on a closed and bounded set (i.e., a compact set) Ω is
uniformly continuous therein (Theorem of Heine-Cantor, given in Appendix A.1.3,
p. 515).
Often one can study the continuity of a function of several variables without
turning to the deﬁnition. To this end the next three criteria are rather practical.
i) If the map ϕ is deﬁned and continuous on a set I ⊆R, then
f(x) = ϕ(x1)
is deﬁned and continuous on Ω = I × Rn−1 ⊆Rn.
In general, any continuous map of m variables is continuous if we think of it
as a map of n > m variables.
For example, the following functions are continuous:
f1(x, y) = ex
on dom f1 = R2 ,
f2(x, y, z) =

1 −y2
on dom f2 = R × [−1, 1] × R .
ii) If f and g are continuous on Ω ⊆Rn, then also f + g, f −g and fg are
continuous on Ω, while f/g is continuous on the subset of Ω where g ̸= 0.
Examples of continuous maps:
h1(x, y) = ex + sin y
on dom h1 = R2 ,

132
4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
h2(x, y) = y log x
on dom h2 = (0, +∞) × R ,
h3(x, y, z) = arctan y
x2 + z2
on dom h3 = R3 \

{0} × R × {0}

.
iii) If f is continuous on Ω ⊆Rn and g is continuous on I ⊆R, the composite
map g ◦f is continuous on dom g ◦f = {x ∈Ω : f(x) ∈I}.
For instance,
h1(x, y) = log(1 + xy)
on dom h1 = {(x, y) ∈R2 : xy > −1} ,
h2(x, y, z) =

x3 + y2

on dom h2 = R2 ×

R \ {1}

,
h3(x) =
4
x4
1 + . . . + x4n
on dom h3 = Rn .
In particular, Proposition 4.20 and criterion iii) imply the next result, which
is about the continuity of a composite map in the most general setting.
Proposition 4.23 Let
f : dom f ⊆Rn →Rm ,
g : dom g ⊆Rm →Rp
be functions and x0 ∈dom f a point such that y0 = f(x0) ∈dom g. Consider
the composite map
h = g ◦f : dom h ⊆Rn →Rp ,
where x0 ∈dom h. Then if f is continuous at x0 and g is continuous at y0,
h is continuous at x0.
The deﬁnition of ﬁnite limit of a vector-valued map, for x →x0 ∈Rn, is
completely analogous to the one-variable case. From now on we will suppose f is
deﬁned on dom f ⊆Rn and x0 ∈Rn is a limit point of dom f.
Deﬁnition 4.24 One says that f has limit ℓ∈Rm (or tends to ℓ) as x
tends to x0, in symbols
lim
x→x0 f(x) = ℓ,
if for any ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
∀x ∈dom f,
0 < ∥x −x0∥< δ
⇒
∥f(x) −ℓ∥< ε ,
(4.23)
i.e.,
∀x ∈dom f,
x ∈Bδ(x0) \ {x0}
⇒
f(x) ∈Bε(ℓ) .

4.5 Continuity and limits
133
As for one real variable, if f is deﬁned on x0, then
f continuous at x0
⇐⇒
lim
x→x0 f(x) = f(x0) .
The analogue of Proposition 4.20 holds for limits, justifying the component-by-
component approach.
Examples 4.25
i) The map
f(x, y) = x4 + y4
x2 + y2
is deﬁned on R2 \ {(0, 0)} and continuous on its domain, as is clear by using
criteria i) and ii) on p. 131. What is more,
lim
(x,y)→(0,0) f(x, y) = 0 ,
because
x4 + y4 ≤x4 + 2x2y2 + y4 = (x2 + y2)2
and by deﬁnition of limit

x4 + y4
x2 + y2
 ≤x2 + y2 < ε
if
0 < ∥x∥< √ε ;
therefore the condition is true with δ = √ε.
ii) Let us check that
lim
(x,y)→(0,0)
|x| + |y|
x2 + y2 = +∞.
Since
x2 + y2 ≤x2 + 2|x| |y| + y2 = (|x| + |y|)2,
so that ∥x∥≤|x| + |y|, we have
f(x, y) = |x| + |y|
∥x∥2
= |x| + |y|
∥x∥
1
∥x∥≥
1
∥x∥,
and f(x, y) > A if ∥x∥< 1/A; the condition for the limit is true by taking
δ = 1/A.
2
A necessary condition for the limit of f(x) to exist (ﬁnite or not) as x →x0, is
that the restriction of f to any line through x0 has the same limit. This observation
is often used to show that a certain limit does not exist.
Example 4.26
The map
f(x, y) = x3 + y2
x2 + y2
does not admit limit for (x, y) →(0, 0). Suppose the contrary, and let

134
4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
L =
lim
(x,y)→(0,0) f(x, y)
be ﬁnite or inﬁnite. Necessarily then,
L = lim
x→0 f(x, 0) = lim
y→0 f(0, y) .
But f(x, 0) = x, so lim
x→0 f(x, 0) = 0, and f(0, y) = 1 for any y ̸= 0, whence
lim
y→0 f(0, y) = 1 .
2
One should not be led to believe, though, that the behaviour of the function
restricted to lines through x0 is suﬃcient to compute the limit. Lines represent
but one way in which we can approach the point x0. Diﬀerent relationships among
the variables may give rise to completely diﬀerent behaviours of the limit.
Example 4.27
Let us determine the limit of
f(x, y) =

xex/y
if y ̸= 0 ,
0
if y = 0 ,
at the origin. The map tends to 0 along each straight line passing through (0, 0):
lim
x→0 f(x, 0) = lim
y→0 f(0, y) = 0
because the function is identically zero on the coordinate axes, and along the
other lines y = kx, k ̸= 0,
lim
x→0 f(x, kx) = lim
x→0 xek = 0 .
Yet along the parabolic arc y = x2 , x > 0, the map tends to inﬁnity, for
lim
x→0+ f(x, x2) = lim
x→0+ xe1/x = +∞.
Therefore the function does not admit limit as (x, y) →(0, 0).
2
A function of several variables can be proved to admit limit for x tending to x0
(see Remark 4.35 for more details) if and only if the limit behaviour is independent
of the path through x0 chosen (see Fig. 4.12 for some examples). The previous
cases show that if that is not true, the limit does not exist.

4.5 Continuity and limits
135
For two variables, a useful suﬃcient condition to study the limit’s existence
relies on polar coordinates
x = x0 + r cos θ ,
y = y0 + r sin θ .
Proposition 4.28 Suppose there exist ℓ∈R and a map g depending on the
variable r such that, on a neighbourhood of (x0, y0),
|f(x0 + r cos θ , y0 + r sin θ) −ℓ| ≤g(r)
with
lim
r→0+ g(r) = 0 .
Then
lim
(x,y)→(x0,y0) f(x, y) = ℓ.
Examples 4.29
i) The above result simpliﬁes the study of the limit of Example 4.25 i):
f(r cos θ, r sin θ) = r4 sin4 θ + r4 cos4 θ
r2
= r2(sin4 θ + cos4 θ)
≤r2(sin2 θ + cos2 θ) = r2 ,
recalling | sin θ| ≤1 and | cos θ| ≤1. Thus
|f(r cos θ, r sin θ)| ≤r2
and the criterion applies with g(r) = r2.
ii) Consider
lim
(x,y)→(0,1)
x log y

x2 + (y −1)2 .
Then
f(r cos θ, 1 + r sin θ) = r cos θ log(1 + r sin θ)
r
= cos θ log(1 + r sin θ) .
Remembering that
lim
t→0
log(1 + t)
t
= 1 ,
for t small enough we have

log(1 + t)
t
 ≤2 ,
i.e., | log(1 + t)| ≤2|t|. Then
|f(r cos θ, 1 + r sin θ)| = | cos θ log(1 + r sin θ)| ≤2r| sin θ cos θ| ≤2r .
The criterion can be used with g(r) = 2r, to the eﬀect that
lim
(x,y)→(0,1)
x log y

x2 + (y −1)2 = 0 .

4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
We would also like to understand what happens when the norm of the inde-
pendent variable tends to inﬁnity. As there is no natural ordering on Rn for n ≥2,
one cannot discern, in general, how the argument of the map moves away from
the origin. In contrast to dimension one, where it is possible to distinguish the
limits for x →+∞and x →−∞, in higher dimensions there is only one “point”
at inﬁnity ∞. Neighbourhoods of the point at inﬁnity are by deﬁnition
BR(∞) = {x ∈Rn : ∥x∥> R}
with
R > 0 .
Each BR(∞) is the complement of the closed neighbourhood BR(0) of radius R
centred at the origin.
With this, the deﬁnition of limit (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) assumes the usual form.
For example a function f with unbounded domain in Rn has limit ℓ∈Rm as x
tends to ∞, written
lim
x→∞f(x) = ℓ∈Rm ,
if for any ε > 0 there is an R > 0 such that
∀x ∈dom f ,
∥x∥> R
⇒
∥f(x) −ℓ∥< ε ,
i.e.,
∀x ∈dom f ,
x ∈BR(∞)
⇒
f(x) ∈Bε(ℓ) .
Eventually, we discuss inﬁnite limits. A scalar function f has limit +∞(or
tends to +∞) as x tends to x0, written
lim
x→x0 f(x) = +∞,
if for any R > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
∀x ∈dom f,
0 < ∥x −x0∥< δ
⇒
f(x) > R ,
(4.24)
i.e.,
∀x ∈dom f,
x ∈Bδ(x0) \ {x0}
⇒
f(x) ∈BR(+∞).

lim
x→x0 f(x) = −∞
and
lim
x→∞f(x) = −∞
descend from the previous ones, substituting f(x) > R with f(x) < −R.
In the vectorial case, the limit is inﬁnite when at least one component of f
tends to ∞. Here as well we cannot distinguish how f grows. Precisely, f has
limit ∞(or tends to ∞) as x tends to x0, which one indicates by
lim
x→x0 f(x) = ∞,

4.5 Continuity and limits
137
if
lim
x→x0 ∥f(x)∥= +∞.
Similarly we deﬁne
lim
x→∞f(x) = ∞.
4.5.1 Properties of limits and continuity
The main theorems on limits of one-variable maps, discussed in Vol. 1, Ch. 4,
carry over to several variables. Precisely, we still have uniqueness of the limit,
local invariance of tha function’s sign, the various Comparison Theorems plus
corollaries, the algebra of limits with the relative indeterminate forms. Clearly,
x →c should be understood by thinking c as either a point x0 ∈Rn or ∞.
We can also use the Landau formalism for a local study in several variables.
The deﬁnition and properties of the symbols O, o, ≍, ∼depend on limits, and
thus extend. The expression f(x) = o(∥x∥) as x →0, for instance, means
lim
x→0
f(x)
∥x∥= 0 .
An example satisfying this property is f(x, y) = 2x2 −5y3.
Some continuity theorems of global nature, see Vol. I, Sect. 4.3, have a counter-
part for scalar maps of several variables. For example, the theorem on the existence
of zeroes goes as follows.
Theorem 4.30 Let f be a continuous map on a region R ⊆Rn. If f assumes
on R both positive and negative values, it necessarily has a zero on R.
Proof.
If a, b ∈R satisfy f(a) < 0 and f(b) > 0, and if P[a, . . . , b] is an arbitrary
polygonal path in R joining a and b, the map f restricted to P[a, . . . , b] is
a function of one variable that satisﬁes the ordinary Theorem of Existence
of Zeroes. Therefore an x0 ∈P[a, . . . , b] exists with f(x0) = 0.
2
From this follows, as in the one-dimensional case, the Mean Value Theorem.
We also have Weierstrass’s Theorem, which we will see in Sect. 5.6, Theorem 5.24.
For maps valued in Rm, m ≥1, we have the results on limits that make sense
for vectorial quantities (e.g., the uniqueness of the limit and the limit of a sum of
functions, but not the Comparison Theorems).
The Substitution Theorem holds, just as in dimension one (Vol. I, Thm. 4.15);
for continuous maps this guarantees the continuity of the composite map, as men-
tioned in Proposition 4.23.

i) We prove that

|x|+|y| = 1 .
As (x, y) →∞, we have |x| + |y| →+∞, hence t = −

|x|+|y| →0; but the
exponential map t →et is continuous at the origin, so the result follows.
ii) Let us show
lim

x4 + y4
x2 + y2 = +∞.
This descends from
x4 + y4
x2 + y2 ≥1
4∥x∥2 ,
∀x ∈R2 , x ̸= 0
(4.25)
and the Comparison Theorem, for (x, y) →∞is clearly the same as ∥x∥→+∞.
To get (4.25), note that if x2 ≥y2, we have
∥x∥2 = x2 + y2 ≤2x2 ,
so
x4 + y4
x2 + y2 ≥x4
2x2 = 1
2x2 ≥1
4∥x∥2 ;
at the same result we arrive if y2 ≥x2.

4.6 Curves in Rm
A curve can describe the way the boundary of a plane region encloses the region
itself – think of a polygon or an ellipse, or the trajectory of a point-particle mov-
ing in time under the eﬀect of a force. Chapter 9 will provide us with a means
of integrating along a curve, hence allowing us to formulate mathematically the
physical notion of the work of a force.
Let us start with the deﬁnition of curve. Given a real interval I and a map
γ : I →Rm, we denote by γ(t) =

xi(t)

1≤i≤m =
m

i=1
xi(t)ei ∈Rm the image of
t ∈I under γ.
Deﬁnition 4.32 A continuous function γ : I ⊆R →Rm is called a curve.
The set Γ = γ(I) ⊆Rm is said trace of the curve.
If the trace of the curve lies on a plane, one speaks about a plane curve.
The most common curves are those in the plane (m = 2)
γ(t) =

x(t), y(t)

= x(t) i + y(t) j ,

4.6 Curves in Rm
139
and curves in space (m = 3)
γ(t) =

x(t), y(t), z(t)

= x(t) i + y(t) j + z(t) k .
We wish to stress the diﬀerence occurring between a curve, which is a function
of one real variable, and its trace, a set in Euclidean space Rm. A curve provides
a way to parametrise its trace by associating to the parameter t ∈I one (and only
one) point of the trace. Still, Γ may be the trace of many curves, because it may be
parametrised in distinct ways. For instance the plane curves γ(t) = (t, t), t ∈[0, 1],
and δ(t) = (t2, t2), t ∈[0, 1] have the segment AB of end points A = (0, 0) and
B = (1, 1) as common trace; γ and δ are two parametrisations of the segment.
The mid-point of AB, for example, corresponds to the value t = 1
2 for γ, t =
√
2
2
for δ.
A curve γ is said simple if γ is a one-to-one map, i.e., if distinct parameter’s
values determine distinct points of the trace.
If the interval I = [a, b] is closed and bounded, as in the previous examples, the
curve γ will be named arc. We call end points of the arc the points P0 = γ(a),
P1 = γ(b); precisely, P0 is the initial point and P1 the end point, and γ joins
P0 and P1. An arc is closed if its end points coincide: γ(a) = γ(b); although
a closed arc cannot be simple, one speaks anyway of a simple closed arc (or
Jordan arc) when the point γ(a) = γ(b) is the unique point on the trace where
injectivity fails. Figure 4.13 illustrates a few arcs; in particular, the trace of the
Jordan arc (bottom left) shows a core property of Jordan arcs, known as Jordan
Curve Theorem.

4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
Theorem 4.33 The trace Γ of a Jordan arc in the plane divides the plane
in two connected components Σi and Σe with common boundary Γ, where Σi
is bounded, Σe is unbounded.
Conventionally, Σi is called the region “inside” Γ, while Σe is the region
“outside” Γ.
Like for curves, there is a structural diﬀerence between an arc and its trace.
It must be said that very often one uses the term ‘arc’ for a subset of Euclidean
space Rm (as in: ‘circular arc’), understanding the object as implicitly parametrised
somehow, usually in the simplest and most natural way.
Examples 4.34
i) The simple plane curve
γ(t) = (at + b, ct + d) ,
t ∈R , a ̸= 0
has the line y = c
ax + ad −bc
a
as trace. Indeed, putting x = x(t) = at + b and
y = y(t) = ct + d gives t = x −b
a
, so
y = c
a(x −b) + d = c
ax + ad −bc
a
.
ii) Let ϕ : I →R be a continuous function on the interval I; the curve
γ(t) = ti + ϕ(t)j ,
t ∈I
has the graph of ϕ as trace.
iii) The trace of
γ(t) =

x(t), y(t)

= (1 + cos t, 3 + sin t) ,
t ∈[0, 2π]
is the circle with centre (1, 3) and radius 1, for in fact

x(t) −1
2 +

y(t) −
3
2 = cos2 t + sin2 t = 1. The arc is simple and closed, and is the standard
parametrisation of the circle starting at the point (2, 3) and running counter-
clockwise.
More generally, the closed, simple arc
γ(t) =

x(t), y(t)

= (x0 + r cos t, y0 + r sin t) ,
t ∈[0, 2π]
has trace the circle centred at (x0, y0) with radius r.
If t varies in an interval [0, 2kπ], with k ≥2 a positive integer, the curve has the
same trace seen as a set; but because we wind around the centre k times, the
curve is not simple.
Instead, if t varies in [0, π], the curve is a circular arc, simple but not closed.
iv) Given a, b > 0, the map
γ(t) =

x(t), y(t)

= (a cos t, b sin t) ,
t ∈[0, 2π]

4.6 Curves in Rm

is a simple closed curve parametrising the ellipse with centre in the origin and
semi-axes a and b:
x2
a2 + y2
b2 = 1 .
v) The trace of
γ(t) =

x(t), y(t)

= (t cos t, t sin t) = t cost i + t sin t j ,
t ∈[0, +∞]
is a spiral coiling counter-clockwise around the origin, see Fig. 4.14, left. Since the
point γ(t) has distance

x2(t) + y2(t) = t from the origin, so it moves farther
aﬁeld as t grows, the spiral a simple curve.
vi) The simple curve
γ(t) =

x(t), y(t), z(t)

= (cos t, sin t, t) = cos t i + sin t j + t k ,
t ∈R
has the circular helix of Fig. 4.14, right, as trace. It rests on the inﬁnite cylinder
{(x, y, z) ∈R3 : x2 + y2 = 1} along the z-axis with radius 1.
vii) Let P and Q be distinct points of Rm, with m ≥2 arbitrary. The trace of
the simple curve
γ(t) = P + (Q −P)t ,
t ∈R
is the line through P and Q, because γ(0) = P, γ(1) = Q and the vector γ(t)−P
has constant direction, being parallel to Q −P.
There is a more general parametrisation of the same line
γ(t) = P + (Q −P) t −t0
t1 −t0
,
t ∈R ,
(4.26)
with t0 ̸= t1; in this case γ(t0) = P, γ(t1) = Q.

4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
Some of the above curves have a special trace, given as the locus of points in
the plane satisfying an equation of type
f(x, y) = c ;
(4.27)
otherwise said, they parametrise level sets of f. With suitable assumptions on f,
one can start from an implicit equation like (4.27) and obtain a curve γ(t) =

x(t), y(t)

of solutions. The details may be found in Sect. 7.2.
Remark 4.35 We posited in Sect. 4.5 that the existence of the limit of f, as x
tends to x0 ∈Rn, is equivalent to the fact that the restrictions of f to the trace
of any curve through x0 admit the same limit; namely, one can prove that
lim
x→x0 f(x) = ℓ
⇐⇒
lim
t→t0 f

γ(t)

= ℓ
for any curve γ : I →dom f such that γ(t0) = x0 for some t0 ∈I.

Curves in polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinates
Representing a curve using Cartesian coordinates, as we have done so far, is but
one possibility. Sometimes it may be better to use polar coordinates in dimension
2, and cylindrical or spherical coordinates in dimension 3 (these were introduced
in Vol. I, Sect. 8.1, and will be discusses anew in Sect. 6.6.1).
A plane curve R2 can be deﬁned by a continuous map γp : I ⊆R →[0, +∞)×R,
where γp(t) =

r(t), θ(t)

are the polar coordinates of the point image of the value
t of the parameter. It corresponds to the curve γ(t) = r(t) cos θ(t) i+r(t) sin θ(t) j
in Cartesian coordinates. The spiral of Example 4.34 v) can be parametrised, in
polar coordinates, by γp(t) = (t, t), t ∈[0, +∞).
Similarly, we can represent a curve in space using cylindrical coordinates,
γc(t) =

r(t), θ(t), z(t)

, with γc : I ⊆R →[0, +∞) × R2 continuous, or using
spherical coordinates, γs(t) =

r(t), ϕ(t), θ(t)

, with γs : I ⊆R →[0, +∞) × R2
continuous. The circular helix of Example 4.34 vi) is γc(t) = (1, t, t), t ∈R,
while a meridian arc of the unit sphere, joining the North and the South poles, is
γs(t) = (1, t, θ0), for t ∈[0, π] and with given θ0 ∈[0, 2π].
4.7 Surfaces in R3
Surfaces are continuous functions deﬁned on special subsets of R2, namely plane
regions (see Deﬁnition 4.15); these regions play the role intervals had for curves.
Deﬁnition 4.36 Let R ⊆R2 be a region. A continuous map σ : R →R3 is
said surface, and Σ = σ(R) ⊆R3 is the trace of the surface.

4.7 Surfaces in R3
143
The independent variables in R are usually denoted (u, v), and
σ(u, v) =

x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)

= x(u, v)i + y(u, v)j + z(u, v)k
is the Cartesian representation of σ.
A surface is simple if the restriction of σ to the interior of R is one-to-one.
A surface is compact if the region R is compact. It is the 2-dimensional
analogue of an arc.
Examples 4.37
i) Consider vectors a, b ∈R3 such that a ∧b ̸= 0, and c ∈R3. The surface
σ : R2 →R3
σ(u, v) = au + bv + c
= (a1u + b1v + c1)i + (a2u + b2v + c2)j + (a3u + b3v + c3)k
parametrises the plane Π passing through the point c and parallel to a and b
(Fig. 4.15, left).
The Cartesian equation is found by setting x = (x, y, z) = σ(u, v) and observing
x −c = au + bv ,
i.e., x −c is a linear combination of a and b. Hence by (4.7)
(a ∧b) · (x −c) = (a ∧b) · a u + (a ∧b) · b v = 0 ,
so
(a ∧b) · x = (a ∧b) · c .
The plane has thus equation
αx + βy + γz = δ ,
where α,β and γ are the components of a ∧b, and δ = (a ∧b) · c.

4 Functions between Euclidean spaces
ii) Any continuous scalar function ϕ : R →R deﬁned on a plane region produces
a surface σ : R →R3
σ(u, v) = ui + vj + ϕ(u, v)k ,
whose trace is the graph of ϕ. Such a surface is sometimes referred to as topo-
graphic (with respect to the z-axis).
The surface σ : R = {(u, v) ∈R2 : u2 + v2 ≤1} →R3,
σ(u, v) = ui + vj +

1 −u2 −v2 k
produces as trace the upper hemisphere centred at the origin and with unit
radius (Fig. 4.15, right).
Permuting the components u, v, ϕ(u, v) of σ clearly gives rise to surfaces whose
equation is solved for x or y instead of z.
iii) The plane curve γ : I ⊆R →R3 given by γ(t) =

γ1(t), 0, γ3(t)

, γ1(t) ≥0
for any t ∈I has trace Γ in the half-plane xz where x ≥0.
Rotating Γ around the z-axis gives the trace Σ of the surface σ : I ×[0, 2π] →R3
deﬁned by
σ(u, v) = γ1(u) cos v i + γ1(u) sin v j + γ3(u)k .
One calls surface of revolution (around the z-axis) a surface thus obtained.
The generating arc is said meridian (arc). For example, revolving around the
z-axis the parabolic arc Γ parametrised by γ : [−1, 1] →R3, γ(t) = (4 −t2, 0, t)
yields the lateral surface of a plinth, see Fig. 4.16, left.
Akin surfaces can be deﬁned by revolution around the other coordinate axes.
iv) The vector-valued map
σ(u, v) = (x0 + r sin u cosv)i + (y0 + r sin u sin v)j + (z0 + r cos u)k
on R = [0, π] × [0, 2π] is a compact surface with trace the spherical surface
of centre x0 = (x0, y0, z0), radius r > 0. Slightly more generally, consider the
(surface of the) ellipsoid, centred at x0 with semi-axes a, b, c > 0, deﬁned by
(x −x0)2
a2
+ (y −y0)2
b2
+ (z −z0)2
c2
= 1 ;
This surface is parametrised by
σ(u, v) = (x0 + a sin u cos v)i + (y0 + b sin u sin v)j + (z0 + c cos u)k .
v) The function σ : R →R3,
σ(u, v) = u cosv i + u sin vj + vk
with R = [0, 1]× [0, 4π], deﬁnes a compact surface; its trace is the ideal parking-
lot ramp, see Fig. 4.16, right. The name helicoid is commonly used for this
surface deﬁned on R = [0, 1] × R.
All surfaces considered so far are simple.

We will see in Sect. 7.2 suﬃcient conditions for an implicit equation
f(x, y, z) = c
to be solved in one of the variables, i.e., to determine the trace of a surface which
is locally a graph.
For surfaces, too, there is an alternative representation making use of cylindrical
or spherical coordinates. The lateral surface of an inﬁnite cylinder with axis z
and radius 1, for instance, has cylindrical parametrisation σc : [0, 2π] × R →
R3, σc(u, v) =

r(u, v), θ(u, v), z(u, v)

= (1, u, v). Similarly, the unit sphere at
the origin has a spherical parametrisation σs : [0, π] × [0, 2π] →R3, σs(u, v) =

r(u, v), ϕ(u, v), θ(u, v)

= (1, u, v). The surfaces of revolution of Example 4.37

4.8.1 Solutions
1. Properties of sets:
a) The interior of A is
◦
A = {(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1} ,
which is the open square (0, 1)2. Its closure is
A = {(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 ≤x ≤1, 0 ≤y ≤1} ,
i.e., the closed square [0, 1]2. The boundary is
∂A = {(x, y) ∈R2 : x = 0 or x = 1, 0 ≤y ≤1} ∪
∪{(x, y) ∈R2 : y = 0 or y = 1, 0 ≤x ≤1} ,
which is the union of the four sides (perimeter) of [0, 1]2.
Then A is neither open nor closed, but connected, convex and bounded, see
Fig. 4.17, left.

those on the parabola x = y2.
b) The map is deﬁned where the radicand is ≥0, so the domain is
{(x, y) ∈R2 : y ≤1
3x if x > 0, y ≥1
3x if x < 0, y ∈R if x = 0} ,
which describes the points lying between the two branches of the hyperbola
y =
1
3x.
c) The map is deﬁned for 3x + y + 1 ≥0 and 2y −x > 0, implying the domain is
{(x, y) ∈R2 : y ≥−3x −1} ∩{(x, y) ∈R2 : y > x
2} .

These are the points of the plane outside the sphere at the origin of radius 3.
e) dom f = R2 \ {0} .
f) The map is deﬁned for z > 0 and x ̸= 0; there are no constraints on y. The
domain is thus the subset of R3 given by the half-space z > 0 without the
half-plane x = 0.

h) The components x(t) = t −2
t + 2 and y(t) = log(9 −t2) of the curve are well
deﬁned for t ̸= −2 and t ∈(−3, 3) respectively. Therefore γ is deﬁned on the
intervals I1 = (−3, −2) and I2 = (−2, 3).
i) The surface is deﬁned for 0 < u2 + v2 < 1, i.e., for points of the punctured
open unit disc on the plane uv.

x2 + y2 ≤1 .
Hence
|f(x, y)| =
|x| |y|

x2 + y2 ≤|y| ,
and by the Squeeze Rule we conclude the limit is 0.
b) If y = 0 or x = 0 the map f(x, y) =
xy
x2 + y2 is identically zero. When com-
puting limits along the axes, then, the result is 0:
lim
x→0 f(x, 0) = lim
y→0 f(0, y) = 0 .
But along the line y = x the function equals 1

In conclusion, the limit does not exist.
c) Let us compute the function f(x, y) = x

k ̸= 0; from
f(x, kx) = 1
k log(1 + x)
follows
lim
x→0 f(x, kx) = 0 .
Along the parabola y = x2 though, f(x, x2) = 1
x log(1 + x), i.e.,
lim
x→0 f(x, x2) = 1 .
The limit does not exist.
d) 0 .
e) Does not exist.
f) Does not exist.
g) Since

The required limit is 0.
4. Continuity sets:
a) The function is continuous on its domain as composite map of continuous
functions. For the domain, recall that arcsin is deﬁned when the argument lies
between −1 and 1, so
dom f = {(x, y) ∈R2 : −1 ≤xy −x −2y ≤1} .
Let us draw such set. The points of the line x = 2 do not belong to dom f. If
x > 2, the condition −1 + x ≤(x −2)y ≤1 + x is equivalent to
1 +

x −2 = x −1
x −2 ≤y ≤x + 1
x −2 = 1 +

this means dom f contains all points lying between the graphs of the two
hyperbolas y = 1 +

x −2 and y = 1 +

x −2. Similarly, if x < 2, the domain is
1 +
3
x −2 ≤y ≤1 +

x −2 .
Overall, dom f is as in Fig. 4.20.
b) The continuity set is C = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : z ̸= x2 + y2}.
5. Let us compute
lim
(x,y)→(0,0) f(x, y). Using polar coordinates,
f(r cos θ, r sin θ) = rα−2| cos θ|α sin(r sin θ) ;
but | sin t| ≤|t|, valid for any t ∈R, implies
|f(r cos θ, r sin θ)| ≤rα−1| cos θ|α| sin θ| ,
so the limit is zero if α > 1, and does not exist if α ≤1. Therefore if α > 1 the
map is continuous on R2, if 0 ≤α ≤1 it is continuos only on R2 \ {0}.
6. The system
 z = x2
z = 4y2
gives x2 = 4y2. The cylinders’ intersection projects onto the plane xy as the two
lines x = ±2y (Fig. 4.21). As we are looking for the branch containing (2, −1, 4),
we choose x = −2y. One possible parametrisation is given by t = y, hence
γ(t) = (−2t, t, 4t2) ,
t ∈R .

Diﬀerential calculus for scalar functions
While the previous chapter dealt with the continuity of multivariable functions
and their limits, the next three are dedicated to diﬀerential calculus. We start in
this chapter by discussing scalar functions.
The power of diﬀerential tools should be familiar to students from the ﬁrst Cal-
culus course; knowing the derivatives of a function of one variable allows to capture
the function’s global behaviour, on intervals in the domain, as well as the local
one, on arbitrarily small neighbourhoods. In passing to higher dimension, there
are more instruments available that adapt to a more varied range of possibilities.
If on one hand certain facts attract less interest (drawing graphs for instance, or
understanding monotonicity, which is tightly related to the ordering of the reals,
not present any more), on the other new aspects come into play (from Linear
Algebra in particular) and become central. The ﬁrst derivative in one variable is
replaced by the gradient vector ﬁeld, and the Hessian matrix takes the place of
the second derivative. Due to the presence of more variables, some notions require
special attention (diﬀerentiability at a point is a more delicate issue now), whereas
others (convexity, Taylor expansions) translate directly from one to several vari-
ables. The study of so-called unconstrained extrema of a function of several real
variables carries over eﬀortlessly, thus generalising the known Fermat and Weier-
strass’ Theorems, and bringing to the fore a new kind of stationary points, like
saddle points, at the same time.
5.1 First partial derivatives and gradient
The simplest case where partial derivatives at a point can be seen is on the plane,
i.e., in dimension two, which we start from.
Let f : dom f ⊆R2 →R be a function of two variables deﬁned in a neighbour-
hood of the point x0 = (x0, y0). The map x →f(x, y0), obtained by ﬁxing the
second variable to a constant, is a real-valued map of one real variable, deﬁned

around the point x0 ∈R. If this is diﬀerentiable at x0, one says f admits partial
derivative with respect to x at x0 and sets

Similarly, if y →f(x0, y) is diﬀerentiable at y0, f is said to admit partial deriv-
ative with respect to y at x0 and one deﬁnes

The geometric meaning of partial derivatives is explained in Fig. 5.1.
This can be generalised to functions of n variables, n ≥3, in the most obvious
way. Precisely, let a map in n variables f : dom f ⊆Rn →R be deﬁned on the
neighbourhood of x0 = (x01, . . . , x0n) =

(or simply fi(x0), if no confusion arises).
Deﬁnition 5.1 Assume f admits partial derivatives at x0 with respect to all

point x0 ∈Rn,
∇f(x0) = a .
iv) Take a function f not depending on the variable xi on a neighbourhood of
x0 ∈dom f. Then ∂f

In particular, f constant around x0 implies ∇f(x0) = 0.

The function

: x →∂f
∂xi
(x) ,
deﬁned on a suitable subset dom ∂f
∂xi
⊆dom f ⊆Rn and with values in R, is called
(ﬁrst) partial derivative of f with respect to xi. The gradient function of f,
∇f : x →∇f(x),
whose domain dom ∇f is the intersection of the domains of the single ﬁrst partial
derivatives, is an example of a vector ﬁeld, being a function deﬁned on a subset of
Rn with values in Rn.
In practice, each partial derivative ∂f
∂xi
is computed by freezing all variables of
f diﬀerent from xi (taking them as constants), and diﬀerentiating in the only one
left xi. We can then use on this function everything we know from Calculus 1.

Partial derivatives with respect to the xi, i = 1, . . . , n, are special cases of
the directional derivative along a vector. Let f be a map deﬁned around a point
x0 ∈Rn and let v ∈Rn be a given non-zero vector. Then f admits partial
derivative, or directional derivative, along v at x0 if
∂f
∂v (x0) = lim
t→0
f(x0 + tv) −f(x0)

(5.2)
exists and is ﬁnite.
Another notation for this is Dvf(x0). The condition spells out the fact that
the map t →f(x0 + tv) is diﬀerentiable at t0 = 0 (the latter is deﬁned in a
neighbourhood of t0 = 0, since x0+tv belongs to the neighbourhood of x0 where f
is deﬁned, for t small enough). See Fig. 5.2 to interpret geometrically the directional
derivative.

v = ei; thus
∂f
∂ei
(x0) = ∂f

(x0),
i = 1, . . . , n ,
as is immediate by comparing (5.2) with (5.1), using Δx = t.
In the next section we discuss the relationship between the gradient and direc-
tional derivatives of diﬀerentiable functions.
5.2 Diﬀerentiability and diﬀerentials
Recall from Vol. I, Sect. 6.6 that a real map of one real variable f, diﬀerentiable
at x0 ∈R, satisﬁes the ﬁrst formula of the ﬁnite increment
f(x) = f(x0) + f ′(x0)(x −x0) + o(x −x0) ,
x →x0 .
(5.3)
This is actually equivalent to diﬀerentiability at x0, because if there is a number
a ∈R such that
f(x) = f(x0) + a (x −x0) + o(x −x0) ,
x →x0 ,
necessarily f is diﬀerentiable at x0, and a = f ′(x0). From the geometric viewpoint,
furthermore, diﬀerentiability at x0 amounts to the existence of the tangent line to
the graph of f at the point P0 =

x0, f(x0)

:
y = t(x) = f(x0) + f ′(x0)(x −x0) .
In presence of several variables, the picture is more involved and the existence of
the gradient of f at x0 does not guarantee the validity of a formula like (5.3), e.g.,
f(x) = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) + o(∥x −x0∥) ,
x →x0 ,
(5.4)
nor the existence of the tangent plane (or hyperplane, if n > 2) to the graph of f
at P0 =

x0, f(x0)

∈Rn+1. Consider for example the function
f(x, y) =
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩
x2y
x2 + y2
if (x, y) ̸= (0, 0) ,
0
if (x, y) = (0, 0) .
The map is identically zero on the coordinate axes (f(x, 0) = f(0, y) = 0 for any
x, y ∈R), so
∂f
∂x(0, 0) = ∂f
∂y (0, 0) = 0 ,
i.e.,
∇f(0, 0) = (0, 0) .

5.2 Diﬀerentiability and diﬀerentials

If we had (5.4), at x0 = (0, 0) we would ﬁnd

2 ̸= 0 .
Not even the existence of every partial derivative at x0 warrants (5.4) will hold. It
is easy to see that the above f has directional derivatives along any given vector v.
Thus it makes sense to introduce the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.4 A function f is diﬀerentiable at an interior point x0 of the
domain, if ∇f(x0) exists and the following formula holds:
f(x) = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) + o(∥x −x0∥) ,
x →x0 .
(5.5)
In the case n = 2,
z = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) ,
(5.6)
i.e.,
z = f(x0, y0) + ∂f
∂x(x0, y0)(x −x0) + ∂f
∂y (x0, y0)(y −y0) ,
(5.7)
deﬁnes a plane, called the tangent plane to the graph of the function f at P0 =

x0, y0, f(x0, y0)

. This is the plane that best approximates the graph of f on a
neighbourhood of P0, see Fig. 5.3. The diﬀerentiability at x0 is equivalent to the
existence of the tangent plane at P0. In higher dimensions n > 2, equation (5.6)
deﬁnes the hyperplane (aﬃne subspace of codimension 1, i.e., of dimension n −1)
tangent to the graph of f at the point P0 =

x0, f(x0)

.
Equation (5.5) suggests a natural way to approximate the map f around x0
by means of a polynomial of degree one in x. Neglecting the higher-order terms,
we have in fact
f(x) ∼f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0)
on a neighbourhood of x0. This approximation, called linearisation of f at x0,
often allows to simplify in a constructive and eﬃcient way the mathematical de-
scription of a physical phenomenon.
Here is yet another interpretation of (5.5): put Δx = x −x0 in the formula,
so that
f(x0 + Δx) = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · Δx + o(∥Δx∥) ,
Δx →0 ,

in other words
Δf = f(x0 + Δx) −f(x0) = ∇f(x0) · Δx + o(∥Δx∥) ,
Δx →0 .
Then the increment Δf of the dependent variable is, up to an inﬁnitesimal of order
bigger than one, proportional to the increment Δx of the independent variable.
This means the linear map Δx →∇f(x0) · Δx is an approximation, often suﬃ-
ciently accurate, of the variation of f in a neighbourhood of x0. This fact justiﬁes
the next deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.5 The linear map dfx0 : Rn →R
dfx0(Δx) = ∇f(x0) · Δx
is called diﬀerential of f at x0.

Consider f(x, y) = √1 + x + y and set x0 = (1, 2). Then ∇f(x0) =
 1

and
the diﬀerential at x0 is the function
dfx0(Δx,Δy ) = 1

Choosing for instance (Δx,Δy ) =

Just like in dimension one, diﬀerentiability implies continuity also for several
variables.

5.2 Diﬀerentiability and diﬀerentials
163
Proposition 5.7 A diﬀerentiable map f at x0 is continuous at x0.
Proof.
From (5.4),
lim
x→x0 f(x) = lim
x→x0

f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) + o(∥x −x0∥)

= f(x0) .
2
This property shows that the deﬁnition of a diﬀerentiable function of several
variables is the correct analogue of what we have in dimension one.
In order to check whether a map is diﬀerentiable at a point of its domain,
the following suﬃcient condition if usually employed. Its proof may be found in
Appendix A.1.1, p. 511.
Proposition 5.8 Assume f admits continuous partial derivatives on a
neighbourhood of x0. Then f is diﬀerentiable at x0.
Here is another feature of diﬀerentiable maps.
Proposition 5.9 If a function f is diﬀerentiable at x0, it admits at x0 dir-
ectional derivatives along any vector v ̸= 0, and moreover
∂f
∂v (x0) = ∇f(x0) · v = ∂f
∂x1
(x0) v1 + · · · + ∂f
∂xn
(x0) vn .
(5.8)
Proof.
Using (5.4),
f(x0 + tv) = f(x0) + t∇f(x0) · v + o(∥tv∥) ,
∥tv∥→0 .
Since ∥tv∥= |t|∥v∥, we have o(∥tv∥) = o(t) , t →0, and hence
∂f
∂v (x0) = lim
t→0
f(x0 + tv) −f(x0)
t
= lim
t→0
t∇f(x0) · v + o(t)
t
= ∇f(x0) · v .
2
Note that (5.8) furnishes the expressions
∂f
∂xi
(x0) = ei · ∇f(x0),
i = 1, . . . , n ,
which might turn out to be useful.
Formula (5.8) establishes a simple-yet-crucial result concerning the behaviour
of a map around x0 in case the gradient is non-zero at that point. How does
the directional derivative of f at x0 vary, when we change the direction along

164
5 Diﬀerential calculus for scalar functions
which we diﬀerentiate? To answer this we ﬁrst of all establish bounds for ∂f
∂v (x0)
when v is a unit vector (∥v∥= 1) in Rn. By (5.8), recalling the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality (4.3), we have

∂f
∂v (x0)
 ≤∥∇f(x0)∥
i.e.,
−∥∇f(x0)∥≤∂f
∂v(x0) ≤∥∇f(x0)∥.
Now, equality is attained for v = ± ∇f(x0)
∥∇f(x0)∥, and then ∂f
∂v(x0) reaches its (posit-
ive) maximum or (negative) minimum according to whether v is plus or minus the
unit vector parallel to ∇f(x0). In summary we have proved the following result,
shown in Fig. 5.4 (see Sect. 7.2.1 for more details).
Proposition 5.10 At points x0 where the gradient of f does not vanish, f
has the greatest rate of increase, starting from x0, in the direction of the
gradient, and the greatest decrease in the opposite direction.
The next property will be useful in the sequel. The proof of Proposition 5.9
showed that the map ϕ(t) = f(x0 + tv) is diﬀerentiable at t = 0, and
ϕ′(0) = ∇f(x0) · v .

More generally,
Property 5.11 Let a, v ∈Rn be given points and suppose f is diﬀerentiable
at a + t0v, t0 ∈R. Then the map ϕ(t) = f(a + tv) is diﬀerentiable at t0, and
ϕ′(t0) = ∇f(a + t0v) · v .
(5.10)
Proof.
Set Δt = t −t0, so that a + tv = (a + t0v) + Δt v and then ϕ(t) =
f(a + t0v + Δtv) = ψ(Δt). Now apply (5.9) to the map ψ.
2
Formula (5.10) is nothing else but a special case of the rule for diﬀerentiating
a composite map of several variables, for which see Sect. 6.4.
5.2.1 Mean Value Theorem and Lipschitz functions
Let a , b be distinct points in Rn and
S[a, b] = {x(t) = (1 −t)a + tb : 0 ≤t ≤1}
be the segment between a and b, as in (4.19). The result below is the n-dimensional
version of the famous result for one-variable functions due to Lagrange.
Theorem 5.12 (Mean Value Theorem or Lagrange Theorem) Let f :
dom f ⊆Rn →R be deﬁned and continuous at any point of S[a, b], and
diﬀerentiable at any point of S[a, b] with the (possible) exception of the end-
points a and b. Then there exists an x ∈S[a, b] diﬀerent from a, b such
that
f(b) −f(a) = ∇f(x) · (b −a) .
(5.11)
Proof.
Consider the auxiliary map ϕ(t) = f

x(t)

, deﬁned - and continuous - on
[0, 1] ⊂R, as composite of the continuous maps t →x(t) and f, for any
x(t). Because x(t) = a+t(b−a), and using Property 5.11 with v = b−a,
we obtain that ϕ is diﬀerentiable (at least) on (0, 1), plus
ϕ′(t) = ∇f

x(t)

· (b −a) ,
0 < t < 1 .
Then ϕ satisﬁes the one-dimensional Mean Value Theorem on [0, 1], and
there must be a t ∈(0, 1) such that
ϕ(1) −ϕ(0) = ϕ′(t) .
Putting x = x(t) in the above gives precisely (5.11).

166
5 Diﬀerential calculus for scalar functions
As an application, we will ﬁnd a result known to the reader at least in dimension
one.
Proposition 5.13 Let R be a region in Rn and f : R ⊆Rn →R a continu-
ous map on R, diﬀerentiable everywhere on A =
◦
R. Then
∇f = 0
on A
⇐⇒
f is constant on R .
Proof.
We have seen that f constant on R, hence on A a fortiori, implies ∇f = 0
at each point of A (Example 5.2 iv)).
Conversely, let us ﬁx an arbitrary a in A, and choose any b in R. There
is a polygonal path P[a0, . . . , ar] with a0 = a, ar = b, going from one
to the other (directly from the deﬁnition of open connected set if b ∈A,
while if b ∈∂A we can join it to a point of A through a segment). On
each segment S[aj−1, aj], 1 ≤j ≤r forming the path, the hypotheses of
Theorem 5.12 hold, so from (5.11) and the fact that ∇f = 0 identically,
follows
f(aj) −f(aj−1) = 0 ,
whence f(b) = f(a) for any b ∈R. That means f is constant.
2
Consequently, if f is diﬀerentiable everywhere on an open set A and its gradient
is zero on A, then f is constant on each connected component of A.
The property we are about to introduce is relevant for the applications. For
this, let R be a region of dom f.
Deﬁnition 5.14 The map f is Lipschitz on R if there is a constant L ≥0
such that
|f(x1) −f(x2)| ≤L∥x1 −x2∥,
∀x1, x2 ∈R .
(5.12)
The smallest number L verifying the condition is said Lipschitz constant
of f on R.
By deﬁnition of least upper bound we easily see that the Lipschitz constant of
f on R is
sup
x1,x2∈R
x1̸=x2
|f(x1) −f(x2)|
∥x1 −x2∥
.
To say that f is Lipschitz on R tantamounts to the assertion that the supremum
is ﬁnite.
Examples 5.15
i) The aﬃne map f(x) = a · x + b (a ∈Rn, b ∈R) is Lipschitz on Rn, as shown
by (4.21). It can be proved the Lipschitz constant equals ∥a∥.

5.2 Diﬀerentiability and diﬀerentials
167
ii) The function f(x) = ∥x∥, mapping x ∈Rn to its Euclidean norm, is Lipschitz
on Rn with Lipschitz constant 1, as
∥x1∥−∥x2∥
 ≤∥x1 −x2∥,
∀x1, x2 ∈Rn .
This is a consequence of x1 = x2 + (x1 −x2) and the triangle inequality (4.4)
∥x1∥≤∥x2∥+ ∥x1 −x2∥,
i.e.,
∥x1∥−∥x2∥≤∥x1 −x2∥;
swapping x1 and x2 yields the result.
iii) The map f(x) = ∥x∥2 is not Lipschitz on all Rn. In fact, choosing x2 = 0,
equation (5.12) becomes
∥x1∥2 ≤L∥x1∥,
which is true if and only if ∥x1∥≤L. It becomes Lipschitz on any bounded region
R, for

 ∥x1∥−∥x2∥

≤2M
∥x1∥−∥x2∥
 ,
∀x1, x2 ∈R ,
where M = sup{∥x∥: x ∈R} and using the previous example.
2
Note if R is open, the property of being Lipschitz implies the (uniform) con-
tinuity on R.
There is a suﬃcient condition for being Lipschitz, namely:
Proposition 5.16 Let f be diﬀerentiable over a convex region R inside
dom f, with bounded (ﬁrst) partial derivatives. Then f is Lipschitz on R.
Precisely, for any M ≥0 such that

∂f
∂xi
(x)
 ≤M ,
∀x ∈R, i = 1, . . . , n ,
one has (5.12) with L = √n M.
Proof.
Pick x1, x2 ∈R. By assumption the segment S[x1, x2] is contained in R
and f is diﬀerentiable (hence, continuous) at any point of S[x1, x2]. Thus
by the Mean Value Theorem 5.12 there is an x ∈R with
f(x1) −f(x2) = ∇f(x) · (x1 −x2) .
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (4.3) tells us
|f(x1) −f(x2)| ≤∥∇f(x)∥∥x1 −x2∥.

5 Diﬀerential calculus for scalar functions
The assertion that the existence and boundedness of the partial derivatives
implies being Lipschitz is a fact that holds under more general assumptions: for
instance if R is compact, or if the boundary of R is suﬃciently regular.
5.3 Second partial derivatives and Hessian matrix
Let f admit partial derivative in xi on a whole neighbourhood of x0. If ∂f
∂xi
admits
ﬁrst derivative at x0 with respect to xj, we say f admits at x0 second partial
derivative with respect to xi and xj, and set
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(x0) =
∂
∂xj
	 ∂f
∂xi

(x0) .
If i ̸= j one speaks of mixed second partial derivatives, while for i = j second
partial derivatives are said of pure type and denoted by the symbol ∂2f
∂x2
i
. Other
ways to denote second partial derivatives are
D2
xjxif(x0) ,
D2
jif(x0) ,
fxjxi(x0) ,
fji(x0) .
In case i is diﬀerent from j, and assuming f admits at x0 mixed derivatives
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(x0) and
∂2f
∂xi∂xj
(x0), these might diﬀer. Take for example
f(x, y) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
xy x2 −y2
x2 + y2
if (x, y) ̸= (0, 0),
0
if (x, y) = (0, 0),
a function such that ∂2f
∂y∂x(0, 0) = −1 while ∂2f
∂x∂y(0, 0) = 1.
We have arrived at an important suﬃcient condition, very often fulﬁlled, for
the mixed derivatives to coincide.
Theorem 5.17 (Schwarz) If the mixed partial derivatives
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
and
∂2f
∂xi∂xj
(j ̸= i) exist on a neighbourhood of x0 and are continuous at x0,
they coincide at x0.
Proof.

is called Hessian matrix of f at x0 (Hessian for short).
The Hessian matrix is also commonly denoted by Hessf(x0), or Hf(x0).
If the mixed derivatives are continuous at x0, the matrix Hf(x0) is symmet-
ric by Schwarz’s Theorem. Then the order of diﬀerentiation is irrelevant, and
fxixj(x0), fij(x0) is the same as fxjxi(x0), fji(x0).
The Hessian makes its appearance when studying the local behaviour of f at
x0, as explained in Sect. 5.6.
Examples 5.19
i) For the map f(x, y) = x sin(x + 2y) we have
∂f
∂x(x, y) = sin(x + 2y) + x cos(x + 2y) ,
∂f
∂y (x, y) = 2x cos(x + 2y) ,
so that
∂2f
∂x2 (x) = 2 cos(x + 2y) −x sin(x + 2y) ,
∂2f
∂x∂y(x) = ∂2f
∂y∂x(x) = 2 cos(x + 2y) −2x sin(x + 2y) ,
∂2f

5.4 Higher-order partial derivatives
The second partial derivatives
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
of f have been deﬁned as ﬁrst partial deriv-
atives of the functions ∂f
∂xi
; under Schwarz’s Theorem, the order of diﬀerentiation
is inessential. Similarly one deﬁnes the partial derivatives of order three as ﬁrst de-
rivatives of the maps
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(assuming this is possible, of course). In general, by

5.5 Taylor expansions; convexity
171
successive diﬀerentiation one deﬁnes kth partial derivatives (or partial deriv-
atives of order k) of f, for any integer k ≥1. Supposing that the mixed partial
derivatives of all orders are continuous, and thus satisfy Schwarz’s Theorem, one
indicates by
∂kf
∂xα1
1 ∂xα2
2 . . . ∂xαn
n
(x0)
the kth partial derivative of f at x0, obtained diﬀerentiating α1 times with respect
to x1, α2 times with respect to x2, . . . , αn times with respect to xn. The exponents
αi are integers between 0 and k such that α1 +α2+. . .+αn = k. Frequent symbols
include Dαf(x0), that involves the multi-index α = (α1, α2, . . . , αn) ∈Nn, but
also, e.g., fxxy to denote diﬀerentiation in x twice, in y once.
One last piece of notation concerns functions f, called of class Ck (k ≥1)
over an open set Ω ⊆dom f if the partial derivatives of any order ≤k exist and
are continuous everywhere on Ω. The set of such maps is indicated by Ck(Ω).
By extension, C0(Ω) will be the set of continuous maps on Ω, and C∞(Ω) the
set of maps belonging to Ck(Ω) for any k, hence the functions admitting partial
derivatives of any order on Ω. Notice the inclusions
C∞(Ω) ⊂. . . ⊂Ck(Ω) ⊂Ck−1(Ω) ⊂. . . ⊂C0(Ω) .
Thanks to Propostion 5.8, a function in C1(Ω) is diﬀerentiable everywhere on Ω.
Instead of the open set Ω, we may take the closure Ω, and assume Ω is con-
tained in dom f. If so, we write f ∈C0(Ω) if f is continuous at any point of Ω;
for 1 ≤k ≤∞, we write f ∈Ck(Ω), or say f is Ck on Ω, if there is an open set
Ω′ with Ω ⊂Ω′ ⊆dom f and f ∈Ck(Ω′).
5.5 Taylor expansions; convexity
Taylor expansions allow to approximate, locally, a function using a polynomial in
the independent variables by the knowledge of certain partial derivatives, just as in
dimension one. We already encountered examples; for a diﬀerentiable map formula
(5.5) holds, which is the Taylor expansion at ﬁrst order with Peano’s remainder.
Note
T f1,x0(x) = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0)
is a polynomial of degree less or equal than 1 in the xi, called Taylor polynomial
of f at x0 of order 1. Besides, if f is C1 on a neighbourhood of x0, then (5.11)
holds with a = x0 and b = x arbitrarily chosen in the neighbourhood, so
f(x) = f(x0) + ∇f(x) · (x −x0) ,
x ∈S[x, x0] .
(5.14)

172
5 Diﬀerential calculus for scalar functions
Viewing the constant f(x0) as a 0-degree polynomial, the formula gives the Taylor
expansion of f at x0 of order 0, with Lagrange’s remainder.
Increasing the map’s regularity we can ﬁnd Taylor formulas that are more and
more precise. For C2 maps we have the following results, whose proofs are given
in Appendix A.1.2, p. 513 and p. 514.
Theorem 5.20 A function f of class C2 around x0 admits at x0 the Taylor
expansion of order one with Lagrange’s remainder:
f(x) = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) + 1
2(x −x0) · Hf(x)(x −x0) ,
(5.15)
where x is interior to the segment S[x, x0].
Formulas (5.4) and (5.15) are two diﬀerent ways of writing the remainder of f
in the degree-one Taylor polynomial T f1,x0(x).
The expansion of order two is given by
Theorem 5.21 A function f of class C2 around x0 admits at x0 the follow-
ing Taylor expansion of order two with Peano’s remainder:
f(x) = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) + 1
2(x −x0) · Hf(x0)(x −x0)
+o(∥x −x0∥2) ,
x →x0 .
(5.16)
The expression
T f2,x0(x) = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) + 1
2(x −x0) · Hf(x0)(x −x0)
is a polynomial of degree ≤2 in the xi, called Taylor polynomial of f at
x0 of order 2. It gives the best quadratic approximation of the map on the
neighbourhood of x0 (see Fig. 5.5 for an example).
For clarity’s sake, let us render (5.16) explicit for an f(x, y) of two variables:
f(x, y) = f(x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x −x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y −y0)
+1
2fxx(x0, y0)(x −x0)2 + fxy(x0, y0)(x −x0)(y −y0) + 1

(x −x0)2 + (y −y0)2
,
(x, y) →(x0, y0) .
For the quadratic term we used the fact that the Hessian is symmetric by Schwarz’s
Theorem.
Taylor formulas of arbitrary order n can be written assuming f is Cn around
x0. These, though, go beyond the scope of the present text.

5.5.1 Convexity
The idea of convexity, both global and local, for one-variable functions (Vol. I,
Sect. 6.9) can be generalised to several variables.
Global convexity goes through the convexity of the set of points above the
graph, and namely: take f : C ⊆Rn →R with C a convex set, and deﬁne
Ef =

(x, y) ∈Rn+1 : x ∈C, y ≥f(x)

.
Then f is convex on C if the set Ef is convex.
Local convexity depends upon the mutual position of f’s graph and the tangent
plane. Precisely, f diﬀerentiable at x0 ∈dom f is said convex at x0 if there is a
neighbourhood Br(x0) such that
f(x) ≥f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) ,
∀x ∈Br(x0) ;
f is strictly convex at x0 if the inequality is strict for any x ̸= x0.
It can be proved that the local convexity of a diﬀerentiable map f at any point
in a convex subset C ⊆dom f is equivalent to the global convexity of f on C.
Take a C2 map f around a point x0 in dom f. Using Theorem 5.21 and the
properties of the symmetric matrix Hf(x0) (see Sect. 4.2), we can say that
Hf(x0) is positive semi-deﬁnite
⇐⇒
f is convex at x0
Hf(x0) is positive deﬁnite
=⇒
f is strictly convex at x0 .

5.6 Extremal points of a function; stationary points
Extremum values and extremum points (local or global) in several variables are
deﬁned in analogy to dimension one.
Deﬁnition 5.22 A point x0 ∈dom f is a relative (or local) maximum
point for f if, on a neighbourhood Br(x0) of x0,
∀x ∈Br(x0) ∩dom f,
f(x) ≤f(x0).
The value f(x0) is a relative maximum of f.
Moreover, x0 is said an absolute, or global, maximum point for f if
∀x ∈dom f,
f(x) ≤f(x0),
and correspondingly f(x0) is the absolute maximum of f. Either way, the
maximum is strict if f(x) < f(x0) when x ̸= x0.
Inverting the inequalities deﬁnes relative and absolute minimum points.
Minimum and maximum points alike are called extrema, or extremum points,
for f.
Examples 5.23
i) The map f(x) = ∥x∥has a strict global minimum at the origin, for f(0) = 0
and f(x) > 0 for any x ̸= 0. Clearly f has no maximum points (neither relative,
nor absolute) on Rn.
ii) The function f(x, y) = x2(e−y2 −1) is always ≤0, since x2 ≥0 and e−y2 ≤1
for all (x, y) ∈R2. Moreover, it vanishes if x = 0 or y = 0, i.e., f(0, y) = 0 for
any y ∈R and f(x, 0) = 0 for all x ∈R. Hence all points on the coordinate axes
are global maxima (not strict).
2
Extremum points as of Deﬁnition 5.22 are commonly called unconstrained, be-
cause the independent variable is “free” to roam the whole domain of the function.
Later (Sect. 7.3) we will see the notion of “constrained” extremum points, for which
the independent variable is restricted to a subset of the domain, like a curve or a
surface.
A suﬃcient condition for having extrema in several variables is Weierstrass’s
Theorem (seen in Vol. I, Thm. 4.31); the proof is completely analogous.
Theorem 5.24 (Weierstrass) Let f be continuous on a compact set K ⊆
dom f. Its image f(K) is a closed and bounded subset of R, and in particular,
f(K) is a closed interval if K is connected.
Consequently, f has on K a maximum and a minimum value.

5.6 Extremal points of a function; stationary points
175
For example, f(x) = ∥x∥admits absolute maximum on every compact set
K ⊂Rn.
There is also a notion of critical point for functions of several variables.
Deﬁnition 5.25 A point x0 at which f is diﬀerentiable is critical or sta-
tionary for f if ∇f(x0) = 0. If, instead, ∇f(x0) ̸= 0, x0 is said a regular
point for f.
By (5.8) a stationary point annihilates all directional derivatives of f.
In two variables stationary points have a neat geometric interpretation. Re-
calling (5.7), a point is stationary if the tangent plane to the graph is horizontal
(Fig. 5.6).
It is Fermat’s Theorem that justiﬁes the interest in ﬁnding stationary points;
we state it below for the several-variable case.
Theorem 5.26 (Fermat) Let f be diﬀerentiable at the extremum point x0.
Then x0 is stationary for f.
Proof.
By assumption the map of one variable
x →f(x01, . . . , x0,i−1, x, x0,i+1, . . . , x0n)
is, for any i, deﬁned and diﬀerentiable on a neighbourhood of x0i; the latter
is an extremum point. Thus, Fermat’s Theorem for one-variable functions
gives ∂f
∂xi
(x0) = 0 .

5 Diﬀerential calculus for scalar functions
In the light of this result, we make a few observations on the relationship
between extrema and stationary points.
i) Having an extremum point for f does not mean f is diﬀerentiable at it, nor
that the point is stationary. This is exactly what happens to f(x) = ∥x∥of Ex-
ample 5.23 i): the origin is an absolute minimum, but f does not admit partial
derivatives there. In fact f behaves, along each direction, as the absolute value,
for f(0, . . . , 0, x, 0, . . . , 0) = |x|.
ii) For maps that are diﬀerentiable on the whole domain, Fermat’s Theorem
provides a necessary condition for an extremum point; this means extremum points
are to be found among stationary points.
iii) That said, not all stationary points are extrema. Consider f(x, y) = x3y3: the
origin is stationary, yet neither a maximum nor a minimum point. This map is
zero along the axes in fact, positive in the ﬁrst and third quadrants, negative in
the others.
Taking all this into consideration, it makes sense to search for suﬃcient con-
ditions ensuring a stationary point x0 is an extremum point. Apropos which, the
Hessian matrix Hf(x0) is useful when the function f is at least C2 around x0. With
these assumptions and the fact that x0 is stationary, we have Taylor’s expansion
(5.16)
f(x) −f(x0) = Q(x −x0) + o(∥x −x0∥2) ,
x →x0 ,
(5.17)
where Q(v) = 1
2v · Hf(x0)v is the quadratic form associated to the symmetric
matrix Hf(x0) (see Sect. 4.2).
Now we do have a suﬃcient condition for a stationary point to be extremal.
Theorem 5.27 Let f be C2 on some neighbourhood of x0, a stationary point
for f. Then
i) if x0 is a minimum (respectively, maximum) point for f, Hf(x0) is pos-
itive (negative) semi-deﬁnite;
ii) if Hf(x0) is positive (negative) deﬁnite, the point x0 is a local strict min-
imum (maximum) for f.
Proof.
i) To ﬁx ideas let us suppose x0 is a local minimum for f, and Br(x0) is a
neighbourhood of x0 where f(x) ≥f(x0). Choosing an arbitrary v ∈Rn,
let x = x0 + εv with ε > 0 small enough so that x ∈Br(x0). From (5.17),
Q(x −x0) + o(∥x −x0∥2) ≥0 ,
x →x0 .
But Q(x−x0) = Q(εv) = ε2Q(v), and o(∥x−x0∥2) = o(ε2∥v∥2) = ε2o(1)
as ε →0+. Therefore
ε2Q(v) + ε2o(1) ≥0 ,
ε →0+ ,

5.6 Extremal points of a function; stationary points
177
i.e.,
Q(v) + o(1) ≥0 ,
ε →0+ .
Taking the limit ε →0+ and noting Q(v) does not depend on ε, we get
Q(v) ≥0. But as v is arbitrary, Hf(x0) is positive semi-deﬁnite.
ii) Let Hf(x0) be positive deﬁnite. Then Q(v) ≥α∥v∥2 for any v ∈Rn,
where α = λ∗/2 and λ∗> 0 denotes the smallest eigenvalue of Hf(x0)
(see (4.18)). By (5.17),
f(x) −f(x0) ≥α∥x −x0∥2 + ∥x −x0∥2o(1)
=

α + o(1)

∥x −x0∥2 ,
x →x0 .
On a neighbourhood Br(x0) of suﬃciently small radius, α+o(1) > 0 hence
f(x) ≥f(x0).
2
As corollary of the theorem, on a neighbourhood of a minimum point x0 for
f, where Hf(x0) is positive deﬁnite, the graph of f is well approximated by the
quadratic map g(x) = f(x0) + Q(x −x0), an elliptic paraboloid in dimension 2.
Furthermore, the level sets are approximated by the level sets of Q(x −x0); as we
recalled in Sect. 4.2, these are ellipses (in dimension 2) or ellipsoids (in dimension
3) centred at x0.
Remark 5.28 One could prove that if f is C2 on its domain and Hf(x) every-
where positive (or negative) deﬁnite, then f admits at most one stationary point
x0, which is also a global minimum (maximum) for f.

The Hessian matrices are diagonal, whence Hf(x1) is negative deﬁnite while
Hf(x2) positive deﬁnite. In summary, x1 and x2 are local extrema (a local
maximum and a local minimum, respectively). Fig. 5.7 shows the graph and the
level curves of f.
ii) The function
f(x, y, z) = 1

,
imposing ∇f(x, y, z) = 0 produces only one stationary point x0 = (1, 0, 1). Then

det(A −λI) = (2 −λ)

= 0 ,
solved by λ1 = 1, λ2 = 2, λ3 = 3. Therefore the Hessian at x0 is positive deﬁnite,
making x0 a local minimum point.

5.6.1 Saddle points
Recalling what an indeﬁnite matrix is (see Sect. 4.2), statement i) of Theorem 5.27
may be formulated in the following equivalent way.

5.6 Extremal points of a function; stationary points
179
Proposition 5.30 Let f be of class C2 around a stationary point x0. If
Hf(x0) is indeﬁnite, x0 is not an extremum point.
A stationary point x0 for f such that Hf(x0) is indeﬁnite is called a saddle
point. The name stems from the shape of the graph in the following example
around x0.
Example 5.31
Consider f(x, y) = x2 −y2: as ∇f(x, y) = (2x, −2y), there is only one stationary
point, the origin. The Hessian matrix
Hf(x, y) =
	 2
0
0
−2

is independent of the point, hence indeﬁnite. Therefore the origin is a saddle
point.
It is convenient to consider in more detail the behaviour of f around such a
point. Moving along the x-axis, the map f(x, 0) = x2 has a minimum at the
origin. Along the y-axis, by contrast, the function f(0, y) = −y2 has a maximum
at the origin:
f(0, 0) = min
x∈R f(x, 0) = max
x∈R f(0, y) .
Level curves and the graph (from two viewpoints) of the function f are shown
in Fig. 5.8 and 5.9.
2
The kind of behaviour just described is typical of stationary points at which
the Hessian matrix is indeﬁnite and non-singular (the eigenvalues are non-zero and
have diﬀerent signs). Let us see more examples.

and
Hf(x, y) =


.
As before, x0 = (0, 0) is a saddle point, because the eigenvalues of the Hessian are
λ1 = 1 and λ2 = −1. Moving along the bisectrix of the ﬁrst and third quadrant,
f has a minimum at x0, while along the orthogonal bisectrix f has a maximum
at x0:
f(0, 0) = min
x∈R f(x, x) = max
x∈R f(x, −x) .
The directions of these lines are those of the eigenvectors w1 = (1, 1), w2 =
(−1, 1) associated to the eigenvalues λ1, λ2.
Changing variables x = u −v, y = u + v (corresponding to a rotation of π/4 in
the plane, see Sect. 6.6 and Example 6.31 in particular), f becomes
f(x, y) = (u −v)(u + v) = u2 −v2 = ˜f(u, v) ,
the same as in the previous example in the new variables u, v.
ii) The function f(x, y, z) = x2+y2−z2 has gradient ∇f(x, y, z) = (2x, 2y, −2z),
with unique stationary point the origin. The matrix
Hf(x, y, z) =
⎛
⎜
⎝
2
0
0
0

⎞

is indeﬁnite, and the origin is a saddle point.

5.6 Extremal points of a function; stationary points
181
A closer look uncovers the hidden structure of the saddle point. Moving on the
xy-plane, we see that the origin is a minimum point for f(x, y, 0) = x2 + y2. At
the same time, along the z-axis the origin is a maximum for f(0, 0, z) = −z2.
Thus
f(0, 0, 0) =
min
(x,y)∈R2 f(x, y, 0) = max
z∈R f(0, 0, z) .
iii) A slightly more elaborate situation is provided by the function f(x, y, z) =
x2 + y3 −z2. Since ∇f(x, y, z) = (2x, 3y2, −2z) the origin is again stationary.
The Hessian
Hf(0, 0, 0) =
⎛
⎜
⎝
2
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
−2
⎞
⎟
⎠
is indeﬁnite, making the origin a saddle point. More precisely, (0, 0, 0) is a min-
imum if we move along the x-axis, a maximum along the z-axis, but on the y-axis
we have an inﬂection point.
2
The notion of saddle points can be generalised to subsume stationary points
where the Hessian matrix is (positive or negative) semi-deﬁnite. In such a case, the
mere knowledge of Hf(x0) is not suﬃcient to determine the nature of the point.
In order to have a genuine saddle point x0 one must additionally require that there
exist a direction along which f has a maximum point at x0 and a direction along
which f has a minimum at x0. Precisely, there should be vectors v1, v2 such that
the maps t →f(x0 + tvi), i = 1, 2, have a strict minimum and a strict maximum
point respectively, for t = 0.
As an example take f(x, y) = x2 −y4. The origin is stationary, and the Hessian
at that point is Hf(0, 0) =

2
0
0
0

, hence positive semi-deﬁnite. Since f(x, 0) =
x2 has a minimum at x = 0 and f(0, y) = −y4 has a maximum at y = 0, the above
requirement holds by taking v1 = i = (1, 0), v2 = j = (0, 1). We still call x0 a
saddle point.
Consider now f(x, y) = x2−y3, for which the origin is stationary the Hessian is
the same as in the previous case. Despite this, for any m ∈R the map f(x, mx) =
x2 −m3x3 has a minimum at x = 0, and f(0, y) = −y3 has an inﬂection point at
y = 0. Therefore no vector v2 exists that maximises t →f(tv2) at t = 0. For this
reason x0 = 0 will not be called a saddle point.
We note that if x0 is stationary and Hf(x0) is positive semi-deﬁnite, then every
eigenvector w associated to an eigenvalue λ > 0 ensures that t →f(x0 + tw) has
a strict minimum point at t = 0 (whence w can be chosen as vector v1); in fact,
(5.17) gives
f(x0 + tw) = f(x0) + 1
2λ∥w∥2t2 + o(t2) ,
t →0 .

182
5 Diﬀerential calculus for scalar functions
Then x0 is a saddle point if and only if we can ﬁnd a vector v2 in the kernel of
the matrix Hf(x0) such that t →f(x0 + tv2) has a strict maximum at t = 0.
Similarly when Hf(x0) is negative semi-deﬁnite.
To conclude the chapter, we wish to provide the reader with a simple procedure
for classifying stationary points in two variables. The whole point is to determine
the eigenvalues’ sign in the Hessian matrix, which can be done without eﬀort for
2 × 2 matrices. If A is a symmetric matrix of order 2, the determinant is the
product of the two eigenvalues. Therefore if det A > 0 the eigenvalues have the
same sign and A is deﬁnite, positive or negative according to the sign of either
diagonal term a11 or a22. If det A < 0, the eigenvalues have diﬀerent sign, making
A indeﬁnite. If det A = 0, the matrix is semi-deﬁnite, not deﬁnite.
Recycling this discussion with the Hessian Hf(x0) of a stationary point, and
bearing in mind Theorem 5.27, gives
det Hf(x0) > 0 ⇒
!
x0 strict local minimum point, if fxx(x0) > 0
x0 strict local maximum point, if fxx(x0) < 0
det Hf(x0) < 0 ⇒x0 saddle point
det Hf(x0) = 0 ⇒the nature of x0 cannot be determined by Hf(x0) only .
In the ﬁrst case det Hf(x0) > 0, the dichotomy maximum vs. minimum may be
sorted out by the sign of fyy(x0), which is also the sign of fxx(x0).
Example 5.33
The ﬁrst derivatives of f(x, y) = 2xy + e−(x+y)2 are
fx(x, y) = 2

y −(x + y) e−(x+y)2
,
fy(x, y) = 2

x −(x + y) e−(x+y)2
,
and the second derivatives read
fxx(x, y) = fyy(x, y) = −2e−(x+y)2
1 −2(x + y)2
,
fxy(x, y) = fxy(x, y) = 2 −2e−(x+y)2
1 −2(x + y)2
.
There are three stationary points
x0 = (0, 0) ,
x1 =

x2 = −x1 ,
and correspondingly,

,
Hf(x1) = Hf(x2) =
	
1 −2 log 2
1 + 2 log 2
1 + 2 log 2
1 −2 log 2

.
Therefore x0 is a maximum point, for Hf(x0) is negative deﬁnite, while x1 and
x2 are saddle points since det Hf(x1) = det Hf(x2) = −8 log 2 < 0.

4. Solutions of the Laplace equation:
a) No.
b) No.
c) Since f(x, y) = 1
2 log(x2 + y2),
fx =
x
x2 + y2 ,
fxx =
y2 −x2
(x2 + y2)2 ,
fy =
y
x2 + y2 ,
fyy =
x2 −y2
(x2 + y2)2 ,
hence fxx + fyy = 0 , ∀x, y ̸= 0. Therefore the function is a solution of the
Laplace equation on R2 \ {0}.
d) Since
fx = −e−x cos y + e−y sin x ,
fxx = e−x cos y + e−y cos x ,
fy = −e−x sin y + e−y cos x ,
fyy = −e−x cos y −e−y cos x ,
we have fxx + fyy = 0 , ∀(x, y) ∈R2, and the function satisﬁes Laplace’s
equation on R2.
5. The assertion follows from
ft = −e−t sin kx ,
fx = ke−t cos kx ,
fxx = −k2e−t sin kx .
6. Solutions of the wave equation:
a) From
fx = cos x sin t ,
fxx = −sin x sin t ,
ft = sin x cos t ,
ftt = −sin x sin t
follows fxx = ftt , ∀(x, t) ∈R2.
b) As
fx = cos(x −t) +
1
x + t ,
fxx = −sin(x −t) −
1
(x + t)2 ,
ft = −cos(x −t) +

ftt = −sin(x −t) −

(x + t)2 ,
we have fxx = ftt , ∀(x, t) ∈R2 such that x + t > 0.
7. a) Using the usual rules, for (x, y) ̸= (0, 0) we have
fx(x, y) = (3x2y −y3)(x2 + y2) −2x(x3y −xy3)
(x2 + y2)2
= y(x4 + 4x2y2 −y4)

x→0 0 = 0 ,
fy(0, 0) = lim

Moreover,

not continuous at (0, 0) (polar coordinates show that the limits

a) z = −6x −y + 1 .
b) By (5.7), we compute
fx(x, y) = −2xey2−x2 ,
fy(x, y) = 2yey2−x2 ,
f(−1, 1) = 1 ,
fx(−1, 1) = 2 ,
fy(−1, 1) = 2 .
The equation is thus
z = f(−1, 1) + fx(−1, 1)(x + 1) + fy(−1, 1)(y −1) = 2x + 2y + 1 .
c) z = 4y −4 .

5 Diﬀerential calculus for scalar functions
11. Checking diﬀerentiability:
a) From fx(x, y) =
y
2√x and fy(x, y) = √x follows
f(4, 1) = 2 ,
fx(4, 1) = 1
4 ,
fy(4, 1) = 2 .
Then f is diﬀerentiable at (4, 1) if and only if
lim
(x,y)→(4,1)
f(x, y) −f(4, 1) −fx(4, 1)(x −4) −fy(4, 1)(y −1)

(x −4)2 + (y −1)2
= 0
i.e.,
L =

(x,y)→(4,1)
y√x −2 −1
4(x −4) −2(y −1)

(x −4)2 + (y −1)2
= 0 .
Put x = 4 + r cos θ e y = 1 + r sin θ and observe that for r →0,

Hence
L = lim

r

r→0 o(1) = 0 .
b) Note f(x, 0) = f(0, y) = 0, so fx(0, 0) = fy(0, 0) = 0. Diﬀerentiability at the
origin is the same as proving
lim
(x,y)→(0,0)
f(x, y) −f(0, 0) −∇f(0, 0) · (x, y)

c) We have f(1, 2) = −1, fx(1, 2) = −4 and fy(1, 2) = 1; f is diﬀerentiable at
(1, 2) precisely when
L =

(x,y)→(1,2)
xy −3x2 + 1 + 4(x −1) −(y −2)

(x −1)2 + (y −2)2

Setting x = 1 + r cos θ , y = 2 + r sin θ and computing,
L = lim
r→0 r cos θ(sin θ −3 cos θ).
The limit is zero by Proposition 4.28 with g(r) = 4r.
12. Observe f(x, 0) = f(0, y) = 0, so
fx(0, 0) = lim
x→0
f(x, 0) −f(0, 0)
x

x→0 0 = 0 ,
fy(0, 0) = lim
y→0
f(0, y) −f(0, 0)
y

y→0 0 = 0 .
The map is certainly not diﬀerentiable at the origin because it is not even con-
tinuous; in fact
lim
(x,y)→(0,0)f(x, y) does not exist, as one sees taking the limit along
the coordinate axes,
lim
x→0 f(x, 0) = lim
y→0 f(0, y) = 0 ,
and then along the line y = x,
lim
x→0 f(x, x) = 1
2 .
13. The function is not diﬀerentiable.
14. The map is certainly diﬀerentiable at all points (x, y) ∈R2 with x ̸= 0, by
Proposition 5.8. To study the points on the axis, let us ﬁx (0, y0) and compute the
derivatives. No problems arise with fy since
fy(x, y) = 2|x|y sin(x2 + y2) ,
∀(x, y) ∈R2 ,
and fy(0, y0) = 0. As far as fx is concerned,
lim
x→0
f(x, y0) −f(0, y0)
x

x→0

If y0 = ±√nπ, with n ∈N, we have
fx(0, ±√nπ) = lim

while

Thus fx(0, y0) exists only for y0 = ±√nπ, where f is continuous and therefore
diﬀerentiable.
15. The map is continuous if α ≥0; it is diﬀerentiable if α > 0.
16. Observe f(x, 0, 0) = x2 sin 1
|x|, hence fx(0, 0, 0) = 0, since
fx(0, 0, 0) = lim
x→0
f(x, 0, 0) −f(0, 0, 0)
x
= lim
x→0 x sin 1
|x| = 0 .
Similarly, fy(0, 0, 0) = fz(0, 0, 0) = 0. For diﬀerentiability at the origin we consider

17. Since fx(x, y) = 2x + 3y , fy(x, y) = 3x −2y we have
df(2,3)(Δx,Δy ) = ∇f(2, 3) · (x −2, y −3) = 13(x −2) .

Proposition 5.16 then tells us f is Lipschitz on R, with L =

21. The map is Lipschitz on the entire R3.

T f2,x0(x) = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) + 1
2(x −x0) · Hf(x0)(x −x0) .
Let us begin by computing the partial derivatives involved:
fx(x, y) = −sin x cos y
so fx(0, 0) = 0
fy(x, y) = −cosx sin y
so fy(0, 0) = 0
fxx(x, y) = −cos x cos y
so fxx(0, 0) = −1
fyy(x, y) = −cosx cos y
so fyy(0, 0) = −1
fxy(x, y) = fyx(x, y) = sin x sin y
so fxy(0, 0) = fyx(0, 0) = 0

P2 = (−

∂y2 (x, y) = 0 ,
∂2f

The Hessians are diagonal; the one of P1 is indeﬁnite, so P1 is a saddle point;

unit circle centred in the origin.

fzz(x, y) = 2
z3
fxy(x, y) = fyx = z ,
fxz(x, y) = fzx = y ,
fyz(x, y) = fzy = x ,
so the Hessians Hf(P1), Hf(P2) are positive deﬁnite (the eigenvalues are
λ1 = 1, with multiplicity 2, and λ2 = 4 in both cases). Therefore P1 and P2
are local minima for f.
24. The domain reads
dom f = {(x, y) ∈R2 : y2 −x2 ≥0} .
The inequality y2 −x2 ≥0 is (y −x)(y + x) ≥0, satisﬁed if the factors (y −x),
(y + x) have the same sign. Thus
dom f = {(x, y) ∈R2 : y ≥x and y ≥−x} ∪{(x, y) ∈R2 : y ≤x and y ≤−x} ,

f(x, y) ≥0 , ∀(x, y) ∈dom f .
All points on y = x and y = −x, i.e., those of coordinates (x, x) and (x, −x), are

which unfortunately does not help to understand the points’ nature.
This can be accomplished by direct inspection of the function. Write f(x, y) =
α(x)β(y) with α(x) = x2 and β(y) = log(1+y)+y2. Note also that f(0, y) = 0, for
any y > −1. It is not diﬃcult to see that β(y) > 0 when y > 0, and β(y) < 0 when
y < 0 (just compare the graphs of the elementary functions ϕ(y) = log(1 + y) and
ψ(y) = −y2). For any (x, y) in a suitable neighbourhood of (0, y) then,
f(x, y) ≥0
if
y > 0
and
f(x, y) ≤0
if
y < 0 .
In conclusion, for y > 0 the points (0, y) are relative minima, whereas for y < 0
they are relative maxima. The origin is neither.

Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
In resuming the study of vector-valued functions started in Chapter 4, we begin
by the various deﬁnitions concerning diﬀerentiability, and introduce the Jacobian
matrix, which gathers the gradients of the function’s components, and the basic
diﬀerential operators of order one and two. Then we will present the tools of diﬀer-
ential calculus; among them, the so-called chain rule for diﬀerentiating composite
maps has a prominent role, for it lies at the core of the idea of coordinate-system
changes. After discussing the general theory, we examine in detail the special,
but of the foremost importance, frame systems of polar, cylindrical, and spherical
coordinates.
The second half of the chapter devotes itself to regular, or piecewise-regular,
curves and surfaces, from a diﬀerential point of view. The analytical approach,
that focuses on the functions, gradually gives way to the geometrically-intrinsic
aspects of curves and surfaces as objects in the plane or in space. The fundamental
vectors of a curve (the tangent, normal, binormal vectors and the curvature) are
deﬁned, and we show how to choose one of the two possible orientations of a curve.
For surfaces we introduce the normal vector and the tangent plane, then discuss
the possibility of ﬁxing a way to cross the surface, which leads to the dichotomy
between orientable and non-orientable surfaces, plus the notions of boundary and
closed surface. All this will be the basis upon which to build, in Chapter 9, an
integral calculus on curves and surfaces, and to establish the paramount Theorems
of Gauss, Green and Stokes.

=
⎛

is called Jacobian matrix of f at the point x0.
The Jacobian (matrix) is also indicated by Jf(x0) or Df(x0).
In particular if f = f is a scalar map (m = 1), then
Jf(x0) = ∇f(x0) .
Examples 6.2
i) The function f : R3 →R2, f(x, y, z) = xyz i+(x2+y2+z2) j has components
f1(x, y, z) = xyz and f2(x, y, z) = x2+y2+z2, whose partial derivatives we write
as entries of
Jf(x, y, z) =
	 yz
xz
xy
2x
2y

.
ii) Consider
f : Rn →Rn ,
f(x) = Ax + b ,
where A = (aij) 1≤i≤m
1≤j ≤n
∈Rm×n is an m × n matrix and b = (bi)1≤i≤m ∈Rm.
The ith component of f is
fi(x) =

j=1

whence ∂fi

(x) = aij for all j = 1, . . . , n x ∈Rn. Therefore Jf(x) = A.

6.2 Diﬀerentiability and Lipschitz functions
Now we shall see if and how the previous chapter’s results extend to vector-valued
functions. Starting from diﬀerentiability, let us suppose each component of f is
diﬀerentiable at x0 ∈dom f (see Deﬁnition 5.5),
fi(x) = fi(x0) + ∇fi(x0) · (x −x0) + o(∥x −x0∥) ,
x →x0
for any i = 1, . . . , n. The dot product ∇fi(x0) · (x −x0) is to be thought of as a
matrix product between the row vector ∇fi(x0) and the column vector x −x0.

6.2 Diﬀerentiability and Lipschitz functions
203
By deﬁnition of Jacobian matrix, we may write, vectorially,
f(x) = f(x0) + Jf(x0)(x −x0) + o(∥x −x0∥) ,
x →x0 .
(6.1)
One says then f is diﬀerentiable at x0.
Let us consider a special case: putting Δx = x −x0, we rewrite the above as
f(x0 + Δx) = f(x0) + Jf(x0)Δx + o(∥Δx∥) ,
Δx →0 ;
the linear map dfx0 from Rn to Rm deﬁned by
dfx0 : Δx →Jf(x0)Δx
is called diﬀerential of f at x0. Up to inﬁnitesimals of order greater than one,
the formula says the increment Δf = f(x0 + Δx)−f(x0) is approximated by the
value of the diﬀerential dfx0 = Jf(x0)Δx.
As for scalar functions, equation (6.1) linearises f at x0, written
f(x) ∼f(x0) + Jf(x0)(x −x0)
on a neighbourhood of x0; in other words it approximates f by means of a degree-
one polynomial in x (the Taylor polynomial of order 1 at x0).
Propositions 5.7 and 5.8 carry over, as one sees by taking one component at a
time.
Also vectorial functions can be Lipschitz. The next statements generalise Deﬁn-
ition 5.14 and Proposition 5.16. Let R be a region inside dom f.
Deﬁnition 6.3 The map f is Lipschitz on R if there is a constant L ≥0
such that
∥f(x1) −f(x2)∥≤L∥x1 −x2∥,
∀x1, x2 ∈R .
(6.2)
The smallest such L is the Lipschitz constant of f on R.
Clearly f is Lipschitz on R if and only if all its components are.
Proposition 6.4 Let R be a connected region in dom f. Suppose f is dif-
ferentiable on such region and assume there is an M ≥0 such that

∂fi
∂xj
(x)
 ≤M ,
∀x ∈R, i = 1, . . . , m , j = 1, . . . , n .
Then f is Lipschitz on R with L = √nm M.

204
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
The proof is an easy consequence of Proposition 5.16 applied to each component
of f.
Vector-valued functions do not have an analogue of the Mean Value The-
orem 5.12, since there might not be an x ∈S[a, b] such that f(b) −f(a) =
Jf(x)(b −a) (whereas for each component fi there clearly is a point xi ∈S[a, b]
satisfying (5.11)). A simple counterexample is the curve f : R →R2, f(t) = (t2, t3)
with a = 0, b = 1, for which f(1) −f(0) = (1, 1) but Jf(t) = (2t, 3t2). We cannot
ﬁnd any t such that Jf(t)(b −a) = (2t, 3t
2) = (1, 1).
Nevertheless, one could prove, under hypotheses similar to Lagrange’s state-
ment 5.12, that
∥f(b) −f(a)∥≤
sup
x∈S[a,b]
∥Jf(x)∥∥b −a∥,
where the Jacobian’s norm is deﬁned as in Sect. 4.2.
At last, we extend the notion of functions of class Ck, see Sect. 5.4. A map f is
of class Ck (0 ≤k ≤∞) on the open set Ω ⊆dom f if all components are of class
Ck on Ω; we shall write f ∈

Ck(Ω)
n. A similar deﬁnition is valid if we take Ω
instead of Ω.
6.3 Basic diﬀerential operators
Given a real function ϕ, deﬁned on an open set Ω in Rn and diﬀerentiable on Ω,
we saw in Sect. 5.2 how to associate to such a scalar ﬁeld on Ω the (ﬁrst) partial
derivatives ∂ϕ
∂xj
with respect to the coordinates xj, j = 1, . . . , n; these are still
scalar ﬁelds on Ω. Each mapping ϕ →∂ϕ
∂xj
is a linear operator, because
∂
∂xj
(λϕ + μψ) = λ ∂ϕ
∂xj
+ μ ∂ψ
∂xj
for any pair of functions ϕ, ψ diﬀerentiable on Ω and any pair of numbers λ, μ ∈R.
The operator maps C1(Ω) to C0(Ω): each partial derivative of a C1 function on Ω
is of class C0 on Ω; in general, each operator
∂
∂xj
maps Ck(Ω) to Ck−1(Ω), for any
k ≥1.
6.3.1 First-order operators
Using operators involving (ﬁrst) partial derivatives we can introduce a host of
linear diﬀerential operators of order one that act on (scalar or vector) ﬁelds deﬁned
and diﬀerentiable on Ω, and return (scalar or vector) ﬁelds on Ω. The ﬁrst we wish

6.3 Basic diﬀerential operators
205
to describe is the gradient operator; as we know, it associates to a diﬀerentiable
scalar ﬁeld the vector ﬁeld of ﬁrst derivatives:
grad ϕ = ∇ϕ =
	 ∂ϕ
∂xj

1≤j≤n
= ∂ϕ
∂x1
e1 + · · · + ∂ϕ
∂xn
en .
Thus if ϕ ∈C1(Ω), then grad ϕ ∈

C0(Ω)
n, meaning the gradient is a linear
operator from C1(Ω) to

C0(Ω)
n.
Let us see two other fundamental linear diﬀerential operators.
Deﬁnition 6.5 The divergence of a vector ﬁeld f = f1e1 + · · · + fnen,
diﬀerentiable on Ω ⊆Rn, is the scalar ﬁeld
div f = ∂f1
∂x1
+ · · · + ∂fn
∂xn
=
n

j=1
∂fj
∂xj
.
(6.3)
The divergence operator maps

C1(Ω)
n to C0(Ω).
Deﬁnition 6.6 The curl of a vector ﬁeld f = f1i + f2j + f3k, diﬀerentiable
on Ω ⊆R3, is the vector ﬁeld
curl f =
	 ∂f3
∂x2
−∂f2
∂x3

(the determinant is computed along the ﬁrst row). The curl operator maps

C1(Ω)
3 to

C0(Ω)
3. Another symbol used in many European countries is
rot, standing for rotor.
We remark that the curl, as above deﬁned, acts only on three-dimensional vector
ﬁelds. In dimension 2, one deﬁnes the curl of a vector ﬁeld f, diﬀerentiable on an
open set Ω ⊆R2, as the scalar ﬁeld
curl f = ∂f2
∂x1
−∂f1
∂x2
.
(6.5)

6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
Note that this is the only non-zero component (the third one) of the curl of
Φ(x1, x2, x3) = f1(x1, x2)i + f2(x1, x2)j + 0k, associated to f; in other words
curlΦ = 0i + 0j + (curl f) k .
(6.6)
Sometimes, in dimension 2, the curl of a diﬀerentiable scalar ﬁeld ϕ on an open
set Ω ⊆R2 is also deﬁned as the (two-dimensional) vector ﬁeld
curl ϕ = ∂ϕ
∂x2
i −∂ϕ
∂x1
j .
(6.7)
Here, too, the deﬁnition is suggested by a suitable three-dimensional curl: setting
Φ(x1, x2, x3) = 0i + 0j + ϕ(x1, x2)k, we see immediately
curlΦ = curl ϕ + 0k .
Higher-dimensional curl operators exist, but go beyond the purposes of this book.
Occasionally one ﬁnds useful to have a single formalism to represent the three
operators gradient, divergence and curl. To this end, denote by ∇the symbolic
vector whose components are the partial diﬀerential operators
∂
∂x1
, . . . ,

en .
In this way the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld ϕ, denoted ∇ϕ, may be thought of as
obtained from the multiplication (on the right) of the vector ∇by the scalar ϕ.
Similarly, (6.3) shows the divergence of a vector ﬁeld f is the dot product of the
two vectors ∇and f, whence one writes
div f = ∇· f .
In dimension 3 at last, the curl of a vector ﬁeld f can be obtained, as (6.4) suggests,
computing the cross product of the vectors ∇and f, allowing one to write
curl f = ∇∧f .
Let us illustrate the geometric meaning of the divergence and the curl of a
three-dimensional vector ﬁeld, and show that the former is related to the change
in volume of a portion of mass moving under the eﬀect of the vector ﬁeld, while
the latter has to do with the rotation of a solid around a point. So let f : R3 →R3
be a C1 vector ﬁeld, which we shall assume to have bounded ﬁrst derivatives on the
whole R3. For any x ∈R3 let Φ(t, x) be the trajectory of f passing through x at
time t = 0 or, equivalently, the solution of the Cauchy problem for the autonomous
diﬀerential system

6.3 Basic diﬀerential operators
207
 Φ′ = f(Φ) ,
t > 0 ,
Φ(0, x) = x .
We may also suppose that the solution exists at any time t ≥0 and is diﬀerentiable
with continuity with respect to both t and x (that this is true will be proved in
Ch. 10). Fix a bounded open set Ω0 and follow its evolution in time by looking at
its images under Φ
Ωt = Φ(t,Ω 0) = {z = Φ(t, x) : x ∈Ω0} .
We will introduce in Chapter 8 the triple integral of a map g deﬁned on Ωt,

Ωt
g(x, y, z) dx dy dz ,
and show that, when g is the constant function 1, the integral represents the
volume of the set Ωt. Well, one can prove that
d

div f dx dy dz ,
which shows it is precisely the divergence of f that governs the volume variation
along the ﬁeld’s trajectories. In particular, if f is such that div f = 0 on R3, the
volume of the image of any open set Ω0 is constant with time (see Fig. 6.1 for a
picture in dimension two).

6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
Let now f(x) = Ax be a particular rigid motion of a three-dimensional solid
S, namely a (clockwise) rotation around the z-axis by an angle θ. Then A is
orthogonal (viz. it does not aﬀect distances); precisely, it takes the form
A =
⎛
⎜
⎝
cos θ
sin θ
0
−sin θ
cos θ
0
0
0
1
⎞
⎟
⎠.
It is easy to see that
curl f = 0i + 0j −2 sin θk ;
so the curl of f has only one non-zero component, in the direction of rotation,
that depends on the angle.
After this digression we return to the general properties of the operators gradi-
ent, divergence and curl, we observe that also the latter two are linear, like the
gradient
div (λf + μg) = λ div f + μ div g ,
curl (λf + μg) = λ curl f + μ curl g
for any pair of ﬁelds f, g and scalars λ, μ. Moreover, we have a list of properties
expressing how the operators interact with various products between (scalar and
vector) ﬁelds of class C1:
grad (ϕψ) = ψ grad ϕ + ϕ grad ψ ,
grad (f · g) = g Jf + f Jg ,
div (ϕf) = grad ϕ · f + ϕ div f ,
div (f ∧g) = g · curl f −f · curl g ,
curl (ϕf) = grad ϕ ∧f + ϕ curl f ,
curl (f ∧g) = f div g −g div f + g Jf −f Jg .
Their proof is straightforward from the deﬁnitions and the rule for diﬀerentiating
a product.
In two special cases, the successive action of two of grad , div , curl on a
suﬃciently regular ﬁeld gives the null vector ﬁeld. The following results ensue
from the deﬁnitions by using Schwarz’s Theorem 5.17.

6.3 Basic diﬀerential operators
209
Proposition 6.7 i) Let ϕ be a scalar ﬁeld of class C2 on an open set Ω of
R3. Then
curl grad ϕ = ∇∧(∇ϕ) = 0
on Ω .
ii) Let Φ be a C2 vector ﬁeld on an open set Ω of R3. Then
div curlΦ = ∇· (∇∧Φ) = 0
on Ω .
The two-dimensional version of the above results reads
Proposition 6.8 Let ϕ be a scalar ﬁeld of class C2 on an open set Ω in R2.
Then
curl grad ϕ = 0
and
div curl ϕ = 0
on Ω .
These propositions steer us to the examination of ﬁelds with null gradient,
null curl or zero divergence on a set Ω, a study with relevant applications. It is
known (Proposition 5.13) that a scalar ﬁeld ϕ has null gradient on Ω if and only
if ϕ is constant on connected components of Ω. For the other two operators we
preliminarly need some terminology.
Deﬁnition 6.9 i) A vector ﬁeld f, diﬀerentiable on an open set Ω in R3
and such that curl f = 0, is said irrotational (or curl-free) on Ω.
ii) A vector ﬁeld f, diﬀerentiable on an open set Ω of Rn and such that
div f = 0 is said divergence-free on Ω.
Deﬁnition 6.10 i) A vector ﬁeld f on an open set Ω of Rn is conservative
in Ω if there exists a scalar ﬁeld ϕ such that f = grad ϕ on Ω. The
function ϕ is called a (scalar) potential of f.
ii) A vector ﬁeld f on an open set Ω of R3 is of curl type if there exists
a vector ﬁeld Φ such that f = curlΦ on Ω. The function Φ is called a
(vector) potential for f.
Taking these into consideration, Proposition 6.7 modiﬁes as follows: i) if a C1
vector ﬁeld f on an open set Ω of R3 is conservative (and so admits a scalar
potential of class C2), then it is necessarily irrotational. ii) If a C1 vector ﬁeld f on
an open set Ω of R3 admits a C2 vector potential, it is divergence-free. Equivalently,
we may concisely say that: i) f conservative implies f irrotational; ii) f of curl
type implies f divergence-free.
The natural question is whether the above necessary conditions are also suf-
ﬁcient to guarantee the existence of a (scalar or vectorial) potential for f. The

210
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
answer will be given in Sect. 9.6, at least for ﬁelds with no curl. But we can say
that in the absence of additional assumptions on the open set Ω the answer is neg-
ative. In fact, open subsets of R3 exist, on which there are irrotational vector ﬁelds
of class C1 that are not conservative. Notwithstanding these counterexamples, we
will provide conditions on Ω turning the necessary condition into an equivalence.
In particular, each C1 vector ﬁeld on an open, convex subset of R3 (like the in-
terior of a cube, of a sphere, of an ellipsoid) is irrotational if and only if it is
conservative.
Comparable results hold for divergence-free ﬁelds, in relationship to the exist-
ence of vector potentials.
Examples 6.11
i) Let f be the aﬃne vector ﬁeld
f : R3 →R3 ,
f(x) = Ax + b
deﬁned by the 3 × 3 matrix A and the vector b of R3. Immediately we have
div f = a11 + a22 + a33 ,
curl f = (a32 −a23)i + (a31 −a13)j + (a21 −a12)k .
Therefore f has no divergence on R3 if and only if the trace of A, tr A =
a11 + a22 + a33, is zero. The ﬁeld is, instead, irrotational on R3 if and only if A
is symmetric.
Since R3 is clearly convex, to say f has no curl is the same as asserting f is
conservative. In fact if A is symmetric, a (scalar) potential for f is
ϕ(x) = 1
2x · Ax −b · x .
Similarly, f is divergence-free if and only if it is of curl type, for if tr A is zero,
a vector potential for f is
Φ(x) = 1
3(Ax) ∧x + 1
2b ∧x .
Note at last the ﬁeld
f(x) = (y + z) i + (x −z) j + (x −y) k ,
corresponding to
A =
⎛
⎜
⎝
0
1
1
1
0
−1
1
−1
0
⎞
⎟
⎠
and
b = 0 ,
is an example of a simultaneously irrotational and divergence-free ﬁeld.
ii) Given f ∈

C1(Ω)
3, and x0 ∈Ω, consider the Jacobian Jf(x0) of f at x0.
Then (div f)(x0) = 0 if and only if tr

Jf(x0)

= 0, while

curl f

(x0) = 0 if
and only if Jf(x0) is symmetric. In particular, the curl of f measures the failure
of the Jacobian to be symmetric.

6.3 Basic diﬀerential operators
211
Finally, we state without proof a theorem that casts some light on Deﬁni-
tions 6.5 and 6.6.
Theorem 6.12 Let Ω be an open convex subset of R3. Every C1 vector ﬁeld
on Ω decomposes (not uniquely) into the sum of an irrotational ﬁeld and a
ﬁeld with no divergence. In other terms, for any f ∈

C1(Ω)
3 there exist
f (irr) ∈

C1(Ω)
3 with curl f (irr) = 0 on Ω, and f (divfree) ∈

C1(Ω)
3 with
div f (divfree) = 0 on Ω, such that
f = f (irr) + f (divfree) .
Such a representation is known as Helmholtz decomposition of f.
Example 6.13
We return to the aﬃne vector ﬁeld on R3 (Example 6.11 i)). Let us decompose
the matrix A in the sum of its symmetric part A(sym) = 1
2(A + AT ) and skew-
symmetric part A(skew) = 1
2(A −AT ),
A = A(sym) + A(skew) .
Setting f (irr)(x) = A(sym)x+b and f (divfree)(x) = A(skew)x realises the Helm-
holtz decomposition of f: f (irr) is irrotational as A(sym) is symmetric, f (divfree)
is divergence-free as the diagonal of a skew-symmetric matrix is zero. Adding to
A(sym) an arbitrary traceless diagonal matrix D and subtracting the same from
A(skew) gives new ﬁelds f (irr) and f (divfree) for a diﬀerent Helmholtz decom-
position of f.

6.3.2 Second-order operators
The consecutive action of two linear, ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators typically pro-
duces a linear diﬀerential operator of order two, obviously deﬁned on a suﬃciently-
regular (scalar or vector) ﬁeld. We have already remarked (Proposition 6.7) how
letting the curl act on the gradient, or computing the divergence of the curl, of
a C2 ﬁeld produces the null operator. We list a few second-order operators with
crucial applications.
i) The operator div grad maps a scalar ﬁeld ϕ ∈C2(Ω) to the C0(Ω) scalar ﬁeld
div grad ϕ = ∇· ∇ϕ =
n

j=1
∂2ϕ
∂x2
j
,
(6.8)
sum of the second partial derivatives of ϕ of pure type. The operator div grad is
known as Laplace operator, or simply Laplacian, and often denoted by Δ.

212
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
Therefore
Δ = ∂2
∂x2
1
+ · · · + ∂2
∂x2n
,
and (6.8) reads Δϕ. Another possibility to denote Laplace’s operator is ∇2, which
intuitively reminds the second equation of (6.8). Note ∇2ϕ cannot be confused
with ∇(∇ϕ), a meaningless expression as ∇acts on scalars, not on vectors; ∇2ϕ
is purely meant as a shorthand symbol for ∇· (∇ϕ).
A map ϕ such that Δϕ = 0 on an open set Ω is called harmonic on Ω. Harmonic
maps enjoy key mathematical properties and intervene in the description of several
physical phenomena. For example, the electrostatic potential generated in vacuum
by an electric charge at the point x0 ∈R3 is a harmonic function deﬁned on the
open set R3 \ {x0}.
ii) The Laplace operator acts (component-wise) on vector ﬁelds as well, and one
sets
Δf = Δf1e1 + · · · + Δfnen
where f = f1e1+· · · fnen. Thus the vector Laplacian maps

C2(Ω)
n to

C0(Ω)
n.
iii) The operator grad div transforms vector ﬁelds into vector ﬁelds, and precisely
it maps

C2(Ω)
n to

C0(Ω)
n.
iv) Similarly the operator curl curl goes from

C2(Ω)
3 to

C0(Ω)
3.
The latter three operators are related by the formula
Δf −grad div f + curl curl f = 0 .
6.4 Diﬀerentiating composite functions
Let
f : dom f ⊆Rn →Rm
and
g : dom g ⊆Rm →Rp
be two maps and x0 ∈dom f a point such that y0 = f(x0) ∈dom g, so that the
composite
h = g ◦f : dom h ⊆Rn →Rp ,
for x0 ∈dom h, is well deﬁned. We know the composition of continuous functions
is continuous (Proposition 4.23).
As far as diﬀerentiability is concerned, we have a result whose proof is similar
to the case n = m = p = 1.
Theorem 6.14 Let f be diﬀerentiable at x0 ∈dom h and g diﬀerentiable at
y0 = f(x0). Then h = g ◦f is diﬀerentiable at x0 and its Jacobian matrix is
J(g ◦f)(x0) = Jg(y0) Jf(x0)
(6.9)

6.4 Diﬀerentiating composite functions
213
Note Jf(x0) is m × n, Jg(y0) is p × m, hence the product of matrices on the
right-hand side is well deﬁned and produces a p × n matrix.
We shall make (6.9) explicit by writing the derivatives of the components of h
in terms of the derivatives of f and g. For this, set x = (xj)1≤j≤n and
y = f(x) =

fk(x)

1≤k≤m ,
z = g(y) =

gi(y)

1≤i≤p ,
z = h(x) =

hi(x)

1≤i≤p .
The entry on row i and column j of Jh(x0) is
∂hi
∂xj
(x0) =


k=1
∂gi
∂yk
(y0) ∂fk
∂xj
(x0) .
(6.10)
To remember these equations, we can write them as

(x0) =

k=1
∂zi
∂yk
(y0) ∂yk

(x0) ,
1 ≤i ≤p , 1 ≤j ≤n ,
(6.11)
also known as the chain rule for diﬀerentiating composite maps.
Examples 6.15
i) Let f = (f1, f2) : R2 →R2 and g : R2 →R be diﬀerentiable. Call h = g ◦f :
R2 →R the composition, h(x, y) = g

f1(x, y), f2(x, y)

. Then
∇h(x) = ∇g

f(x)

Jf(x) ;
(6.12)
putting u = f1(x, y), v = f2(x, y), this becomes
∂h
∂x(x, y) = ∂g
∂u(u, v) ∂f1
∂x (x, y) + ∂g
∂v (u, v) ∂f2
∂x (x, y)
∂h
∂y (x, y) = ∂g
∂u(u, v) ∂f1
∂y (x, y) + ∂g
∂v (u, v) ∂f2
∂y (x, y) .
ii) Let ϕ : I ⊆R →R be a diﬀerentiable map and f : R2 →R a scalar
diﬀerentiable function. The composite h(x) = f

x,ϕ (x)

is diﬀerentiable on I,
and
h′(x) = dh
dx(x) = ∂f
∂x

x,ϕ (x)

+ ∂f
∂y

x,ϕ (x)

ϕ′(x) ,
as follows from Theorem 6.14, since h = f◦Φ with Φ : I →R2, Φ(x) =

x,ϕ (x)

.
When a function depends on one variable only, the partial derivative symbol
in (6.9) should be replaced by the more precise ordinary derivative.

214
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
iii) Consider a curve γ : I ⊆R →R3 of diﬀerentiable components γi, together
with a diﬀerentiable map f : R3 →R. Let h = f ◦γ : I →R be the composition.
Then
h′(t) = ∇f

Theorem 6.14 can be successfully applied to extend the one-variable res-
ult, known to the student, about the derivative of the inverse function (Vol. I,
Thm. 6.9). We show that under suitable hypotheses the Jacobian of the inverse
function is roughly speaking the inverse Jacobian matrix. Sect. 7.1.1 will give us
a suﬃcient condition for the following corollary to hold.
Corollary 6.16 Let f : dom f ⊆Rn →Rn be diﬀerentiable at x0 with non-
singular Jf(x0). Assume further that f is invertible on a neighbourhood of
x0, and that the inverse map f −1 is diﬀerentiable at y0 = f(x0). Then
J(f −1)(y0) =

Jf(x0)
−1 .
Proof.
Applying the theorem with g = f −1 will meet our needs, because
h = f −1 ◦f is the identity map (h(x) = x for any x around x0), hence
Jh(x0) = I. Therefore
J(f −1)(y0) Jf(x0) = I ,
whence the claim, as Jf(x0) is invertible.

6.4.1 Functions deﬁned by integrals
We encounter a novel way to deﬁne a function, a way that takes a given map of
two (scalar or vectorial) variables and integrates it with respect to one of them.
This kind of map has many manifestations, for instance in the description of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. In the sequel we will restrict to the case of two scalar variables,
although the more general treatise is not, conceptually, that more diﬃcult.
Let then g be a real map deﬁned on the set R = I × J ⊂R2, where I is an
arbitrary real interval and J = [a, b] is closed and bounded. Suppose g is continuous
on R and deﬁne
f(x) =
 b
a
g(x, y) dy ;
(6.14)

6.4 Diﬀerentiating composite functions
215
this is a one-variable map deﬁned on I, because for any x ∈I the function y →
g(x, y) is continuous hence integrable on J.
Our function f satisﬁes the following properties, whose proof can be found in
Appendix A.1.3, p. 516.
Proposition 6.17 The function f of (6.14) is continuous on I. Moreover, if
g admits continuous partial derivative ∂g
∂x on R, then f is of class C1 on I
and
f ′(x) =
 b
a
∂g
∂x(x, y) dy .
This proposition spells out a rule for diﬀerentiating integrals: diﬀerentiating in
one variable and integrating in the other are commuting operations, namely
d
dx
 b
a
g(x, y) dy =
 b
a
∂g
∂x(x, y) dy .
The above formula extends to higher derivatives:
f (k)(x) =
 b
a
∂kg
∂xk (x, y) dy ,
k ≥1 ,
provided the integrand exists and is continuous on R.
A more general form of (6.14) is
f(x) =
 β(x)
α(x)
g(x, y) dy ,
(6.15)
where α and β are deﬁned on I with values in [a, b].
Notice that the integral function
f(x) =
 x
a
g(y) dy ,
considered in Vol. I, Sect. 9.8, is a special case.
Proposition 6.17 generalises in the following manner.
Proposition 6.18 If α and β are continuous on I, the map f deﬁned
by (6.15) is continuous on I. If moreover g admits continuous partial de-
rivative ∂g
∂x on R and α, β are C1 on I, then f is C1 on I, and
f ′(x) =

(6.16)

216
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
Proof.
We shall only prove the formula, referring to Appendix A.1.3, p. 517, for
the rest of the proof.
Deﬁne on I × J2 the map
F(x, p, q) =

is of the form (6.15) if we set g(x, y) = e−xy2
y
, α(x) = x, β(x) = x2. As g is
not integrable in elementary functions with respect to y, we cannot compute
f(x) explicitly. But g is C1 on any closed region contained in the ﬁrst quadrant
x > 0, y > 0, while α and β are regular everywhere. Invoking Proposition 6.18
we deduce f is C1 on (0, +∞), with derivative

Using this we can deduce the behaviour of f around the point x0 = 1. Firstly,
f(1) = 0 and f ′(1) = e−1; secondly, diﬀerentiating f ′(x) once more gives f ′′(1) =

6.5 Regular curves
Curves were introduced in Sect. 4.6. A curve γ : I →Rm is said diﬀerentiable
if its components xi : I →R, i ≤i ≤m, are diﬀerentiable on I (recall a map
is diﬀerentiable on an interval I if diﬀerentiable at all interior points of I, and
at the end-points of I where present). We denote by γ′ : I →Rm the derivative
γ′(t) =

x′
i(t)

1≤i≤m = "m
i=1 x′
i(t)ei.
Deﬁnition 6.20 A curve γ : I →Rm is regular if it is diﬀerentiable on I
with continuous derivative (the components are C1 on I) and if γ′(t) ̸= 0, for
any t ∈I.
A curve γ : I →Rm is piecewise regular if I is the ﬁnite union of intervals
on which γ is regular.
If γ is a regular curve and t0 ∈I, we can interpret the vector γ′(t0) geomet-
rically (Fig. 6.2). Calling P0 = γ(t0) and taking t0 + Δt ∈I such that the point
PΔt = γ(t0 + Δt) is distinct from P0, we consider the lines through P0 and PΔt;
by (4.26), a secant line can be parametrised as
S(t) = P0 +

PΔt −P0
t −t0
Δt
= γ(t0) + γ(t0 + Δt) −γ(t0)
Δt
(t −t0) .
(6.17)
Letting now Δt tend to 0, the point PΔt moves towards P0 (in the sense that each
component of PΔt tends to the corresponding component of P0). Meanwhile, the
vector σ = σ(t0, Δ t) = γ(t0 + Δt) −γ(t0)
Δt
tends to γ′(t0) by regularity.

218
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
The limit position of (6.17) is thus
T (t) = γ(t0) + γ′(t0)(t −t0) ,
t ∈R ,
the tangent line to the trace of the curve at P0. For this reason we introduce
Deﬁnition 6.21 Let γ : I →Rm be a regular curve, and t0 ∈I. The vector
γ′(t0) is called tangent vector to the trace of the curve at P0 = γ(t0).
To be truly rigorous, the tangent vector at P0 is the position vector

P0, γ′(t0)

,
but it is common practice to denote it by γ′(t0). Later on we shall see the tangent
line at a point is an intrinsic object, and does not depend upon the chosen para-
metrisation; its length and orientation, instead, do depend on the parametrisation.
In kinematics, a curve in R3 models the trajectory of a point-particle occupying
the position γ(t) at time t. When the curve is regular, γ′(t) is the particle’s velocity
at the instant t.
Examples 6.22
i) All curves considered in Examples 4.34 are regular.
ii) Let ϕ : I →R denote a continuously-diﬀerentiable map on I; the curve
γ(t) =

is regular, and has the graph of ϕ as trace. In fact,
γ′(t) =

for any t ∈I .

6.5.1 Congruence of curves; orientation
Now we discuss some useful relationships between curves parametrising the same
trace.
Deﬁnition 6.23 Let γ : I →Rm and δ : J →Rm be regular curves. They
are called congruent if there is a bijection ϕ : J →I, diﬀerentiable with
non-zero continuous derivative, such that
δ = γ ◦ϕ
(hence δ(τ) = γ

ϕ(τ)

for any τ ∈J).
For the sequel we remark that congruent curves have the same trace, for x =
δ(τ) if and only if x = γ(t) with t = ϕ(τ). In addition, the tangent vectors at the
point P0 = γ(t0) = δ(τ0) are collinear, because diﬀerentiating δ(τ) = γ

ϕ(τ)

at
τ0 gives
δ′(τ0) = γ′
ϕ(τ0)

ϕ′(τ0) = γ′(t0)ϕ′(τ0) ,
(6.18)
with ϕ′(τ0) ̸= 0. Consequently, the tangent line at P0 is the same for the two
curves.
The map ϕ, relating the congruent curves γ, δ as in Deﬁnition 6.23, has ϕ′
always > 0 or always < 0 on J; in fact, by assumption ϕ′ is continuous and never
zero on J, hence has constant sign by the Theorem of Existence of Zeroes. This
entails we can divide congruent curves in two classes.
Deﬁnition 6.24 The congruent curves γ : I →Rm, δ : J →Rm are equi-
valent if the bijection ϕ : J →I has strictly positive derivative, while they
are anti-equivalent if ϕ′ is strictly negative.
Here is an example of two anti-equivalent curves.

6.5 Regular curves
221
Deﬁnition 6.25 Let γ : I →Rm be a regular curve. Denoting by −I the
interval {t ∈R : −t ∈I}, the curve −γ : −I →Rm, (−γ)(t) = γ(−t) is said
opposite to γ, and is anti-equivalent to γ.
We may write (−γ) = γ ◦ϕ, where ϕ : −I →I is the bijection ϕ(t) = −t. If
γ : [a, b] →Rm is a regular arc then −γ is still a regular arc deﬁned on the
interval [−b, −a].
If we take anti-equivalent curves γ and δ we may also write
δ(τ) = γ

ϕ(τ)

= γ

−(−ϕ(τ))

= (−γ)

ψ(τ)

where ψ : J →−I, ψ(τ) = −ϕ(τ). Since ψ′(τ) = −ϕ′(τ) > 0, the curves δ and
(−γ) will be equivalent. In conclusion,
Property 6.26 Congruent curves are either equivalent or one is equivalent
to the opposite of the other.
Due to this observation we shall adopt the notation δ ∼γ to denote two
equivalent curves, and δ ∼−γ for anti-equivalent ones.
By (6.18) now, equivalent curves have tangent vectors pointing in the same
direction, whereas anti-equivalent curves have opposite tangent vectors.
Assume from now on that curves are simple. It is immediate to verify that all
curves congruent to a simple curve are themselves simple. Moreover, one can prove
the following property.
Proposition 6.27 If Γ denotes the trace of a simple, regular curve γ, any
other simple regular curve δ having Γ as trace is congruent to γ.
Thus all parametrisations of Γ by simple regular curves are grouped into two
classes: two curves belong to the same class if they are equivalent, and live in
diﬀerent classes if anti-equivalent. To each class we associate an orientation of
Γ. Given any parametrisation of Γ in fact, we say the point P2 = γ(t2) follows
P1 = γ(t1) on γ if t2 > t1 (Fig. 6.5). Well, it is easy to see that if δ is equivalent
to γ, P2 follows P1 also in this parametrisation, in other words P2 = δ(τ2) and
P1 = δ(τ1) with τ2 > τ1. Conversely, if δ is anti-equivalent to γ, then P2 = δ(τ2)
and P1 = δ(τ1) with τ2 < τ1, so P1 will follow P2.
As observed earlier, the orientation of Γ can be also determined from the
orientation of its tangent vectors.
The above discussion explains why simple regular curves are commonly thought
of as geometrical objects, rather than as parametrisations, and often the two no-
tions are confused, on purpose. This motivates the following deﬁnition.

Figure 6.5. An arc Γ in R3 and an orientation on it
Deﬁnition 6.28 A subset Γ of Rm is called a simple regular curve if it
can be described as the trace of a curve with the same properties.
If necessary one associates to Γ one of the two possible orientations. The choice
of Γ and of an orientation on it determine a class of simple regular curves all
equivalent to each other; within this class, one might select the most suitable
parametrisation for the speciﬁc needs.
Every deﬁnition and property stated for regular curves adapts easily to
piecewise-regular curves.
6.5.2 Length and arc length
We deﬁne the length of the regular arc γ : [a, b] →Rm as the number

The reason is geometrical (see Fig. 6.6). We subdivide [a, b] using a = t0 < t1 <
. . . , tK−1 < tK = b and consider the points Pk = γ(tk) ∈Γ, k = 0, . . . , K. They
determine a polygonal path in Rm (possibly degenerate) whose length is

notice the analogy with the last integral in (6.19), of which the above is an approx-
imation. One could prove that if the curve is piecewise regular, the least upper
bound of ℓ(t0, t1, . . . , tK) over all possible partitions of [a, b] is ﬁnite, and equals
ℓ(γ).
The length (6.19) of an arc depends not only on the trace Γ, but also on the
chosen parametrisation. For example, parametrising the circle x2 + y2 = r2 by
γ1(t) = (r cos t, r sin t), t ∈[0, 2π], we have
ℓ(γ1) =
 2π
0
r dt = 2πr ,
as is well known from elementary geometry. But if we take γ2(t) = (r cos 2t, r sin 2t),
t ∈[0, 2π], then
ℓ(γ2) =
 2π
0
2r dt = 4πr .
In the latter case we went around the origin twice. Recalling (6.18), it is easy to
see that two congruent arcs have the same length (see also Proposition 9.3 below,
where f = 1). We shall prove in Sect. 9.1 that the length of a simple (or Jordan)
arc depends only upon the trace Γ; it is called length of Γ, and denoted by ℓ(Γ).

224
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
In the previous example γ1 is simple while γ2 is not; the length ℓ(Γ) of the circle
is ℓ(γ1).
Let γ be a regular curve deﬁned on the interval I, on which we ﬁx an arbitrary
point t0 ∈I, and introduce the function s : I →R
s(t) =
 t
t0
∥γ′(τ)∥dτ .
(6.20)
Recalling expression (6.19) for the length of an arc, we have
s(t) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
ℓ(γ|[t0,t]) ,
t > t0 ,
0 ,
t = t0 ,
−ℓ(γ|[t,t0]) ,
t < t0 .
The function s allows to deﬁne an equivalent curve that gives a new paramet-
risation of the trace of γ. By the Fundamental Theorem of Integral Calculus, in
fact,
s′(t) = ∥γ′(t)∥> 0 ,
∀t ∈I ,
so s is a strictly increasing map, and hence invertible on I. Call J = s(I) the
image interval under s, and let t : J →I ⊆R be the inverse map of s. In
other terms we write t as a function of another parameter s, t = t(s). The curve
1γ : J →Rm, 1γ(s) = γ(t(s)) is equivalent to γ (in particular it has the same trace
Γ). If P1 = γ(t1) is an arbitrary point on Γ, then P1 = 1γ(s1) with t1 and s1
related by t1 = t(s1). The number s1 is the arc length of P1.
Recalling the rule for diﬀerentiating an inverse function,
1γ′(s) = d1γ
ds (s) = dγ
dt

t(s)
 dt
ds(s) =
γ′(t)
∥γ′(t)∥,
whence
∥1γ′(s)∥= 1 ,
∀s ∈J .
(6.21)
This means that the arc length parametrises the curve with constant “speed” 1.
The deﬁnitions of length of an arc and arc length extend to piecewise-regular
curves.
Example 6.29
The curve γ : R →R3, γ(t) = (cos t, sin t, t) has trace the circular helix (see
Example 4.34 vi)). Then
∥γ′(t)∥= ∥(−sin t, cos t, 1)∥= (sin2 t + cos2 t + 1)1/2 =

6.5.3 Elements of diﬀerential geometry for curves
This section is dedicated to the intrinsic geometry of curves in R3, and is not
strictly essential for the sequel. As such it may be skipped at ﬁrst reading.
We consider a regular, simple curve Γ in R3 parametrised by arc length s
(deﬁned from an origin point P ∗). Call γ = γ(s) such parametrisation, deﬁned on
an interval J ⊆R, and suppose γ is of class C2 on J.
If t(s) = γ′(s) is the tangent vector to Γ at P = γ(s), by (6.21) we have
∥t(s)∥= 1 ,
∀s ∈J ,
making t(s) a unit vector. Diﬀerentiating once more in s gives t′(s) = γ′′(s), a
vector orthogonal to t(s); in fact diﬀerentiating
∥t(s)∥2 =
3

i=1
t2
i (s) = 1 ,
∀s ∈J ,
we ﬁnd
2
3

i=1
ti(s)t′
i(s) = 0 ,
i.e., t(s) · t′(s) = 0. Recall now that if γ(s) is the trajectory of a point-particle
in time, its velocity t(s) has constant speed = 1. Therefore t′(s) represents the
acceleration, and depends exclusively on the change of direction of the velocity
vector. Thus the acceleration is perpendicular to the direction of motion.
If at P0 = γ(s0) the vector t′(s0) is not zero, we may deﬁne
n(s0) =
t′(s0)
∥t′(s0)∥,
(6.22)
called principal normal (vector) to Γ at P0. The orthonormal vectors t(s0) and
n(s0) lie on a plane passing through P0, the osculating plane to the curve Γ at
P0. Among all planes passing through P0, the osculating plane is the one that best
adapts to the curve; to be precise, the distance of a point γ(s) on the curve from
the osculating plane is inﬁnitesimal of order bigger than s −s0, as s →s0. The
osculating plane of a plane curve is, at each point, the plane containing the curve.
The orientation of the principal normal has to do with the curve’s convexity
(Fig. 6.7). If the curve is plane, in the frame system of t and n the curve can be
represented around P0 as the graph of a convex function.

Figure 6.7. Osculating plane and tangent, normal, binormal vectors of Γ at P0
The number K(s0) = ∥t′(s0)∥is the curvature of Γ at P0, and its inverse R(s0)
is called curvature radius. These names arise from the following considerations.
For simplicity suppose the curve is plane, and let us advance by R(s0) in the
direction of n, starting from P0(s0); the point C(s0) thus reached is the centre
of curvature (Fig. 6.8). The circle with centre C(s0) and radius R(s0) is tangent
to Γ at P0, and among all tangent circles we are considering the one that best
approximates the curve around P0 (osculating circle).
The orthogonal vector to the osculating plane,
b(s0) = t(s0) ∧n(s0) ,
(6.23)
is known as the binormal (vector) to Γ at P0. This completes a positively-oriented
triple (t, n, b) of orthonormal vectors, that deﬁnes a moving frame along a curve.
The binormal unit vector, being orthogonal to the osculating plane, is constant
along the curve if the latter is plane. Therefore, its variation measures how far the
curve is from being plane. If the curve is C3 it makes sense to consider the vector
b′(s0), the torsion vector of the curve at P0. Diﬀerentiating deﬁnition (6.23)
gives
b′(s0) = t′(s0) ∧n(s0) + t(s0) ∧n′(s0) = t(s0) ∧n′(s0)
as n(s0) is parallel to t′(s0). This explains why n′(s0) is orthogonal to t(s0). At
the same time, diﬀerentiating ∥b(s0)∥2 = 1 gives b′(s0) · b(s0) = 0, making b′(s0)
orthogonal to b(s0) as well. Therefore b′(s0) is parallel to n(s0), and there must
exist a scalar τ(s0), called torsion of the curve, such that b′(s0) = τ(s0)n(s0). It
turns out that a curve is plane if and only if the torsion vanishes identically.
Diﬀerentiating the equation n(s) = b(s) ∧t(s) gives
n′(s0) = b(s0) ∧t′(s0) + b′(s0) ∧t(s0)
= b(s0) ∧K(s0)n(s0) + τ(s0)n(s0) ∧t(s0)
= −K(s0)t(s0) −τ(s0)b(s0) .

To summarise, the unit vectors t, n, b of a C3 curve Γ satisfy the Frenet formulas
t′ = Kn ,
n′ = −Kt −τb ,
b′ = τn .
(6.24)
We conclude by pointing out that the vectors t, n, b admit a representation in
terms of an arbitrary parametrisation of Γ.
6.6 Variable changes
Let R be a region of Rn. The generic point P ∈R is completely determined by its
Cartesian coordinates x1, x2, . . . , xn which, as components of a vector x, allow to
identify P = x. For i = 1, . . . , n the line
Ri = x + Rei = {xt = (x1, . . . , xi−1, xi + t, xi+1, . . . , xn) : t ∈R}
contains P and is parallel to the ith canonical unit vector ei. Thus the lines Ri,
called coordinate lines through P, are mutually orthogonal.
Deﬁnition 6.30 Let R′ be another region of Rn, with interior A′. A vector
ﬁeld Φ : R′ →R deﬁnes a change of variables, or change of coordinates,
on R if Φ is:
i) a bijective map between R′ and R;
ii) of class C1 on A′;
iii) regular on A′, or equivalently, the Jacobian JΦ is non-singular everywhere
on A′.

Let A indicate the image Φ(A′): then it is possible to prove that A is open, and
consequently A ⊆
◦
R; furthermore, Φ(∂R′) = Φ(∂A′) is contained in R \ A.
Denote by Q = u the generic point of R′, with Cartesian coordinates
u1, . . . , un. Given P0 = x0 ∈A, part i) implies there exists a unique point
Q0 = u0 ∈A′ such that P0 = Φ(Q0), or x0 = Φ(u0). Thus we may determ-
ine P0, besides by its Cartesian coordinates x01, . . . , x0n, also by the Cartesian
coordinates u01, . . . , u0n of Q0; the latter are called curvilinear coordinates of
P0 (relative to the transformation Φ). The coordinate lines through Q0 produce
curves in R passing through P0. Precisely, the set
Γi = {x = Φ(u0 + tei) : u0 + tei ∈R′ with t ∈Ii} ,
where i = 1, . . . , n and Ii is an interval containing the origin, is the trace of the
curve (simple, by i))
t →γi(t) = Φ(u0 + tei)
deﬁned on Ii. These sets are the coordinate lines through the point P0 (relative
to Φ); see Fig. 6.9.
If P0 ∈A these are regular curves (by iii)), so tangent vectors at P0 exist
τi = γ′
i(0) = JΦ(u0) · ei = ∂Φ
∂ui
(u0) ,
1 ≤i ≤n .
(6.25)
They are the columns of the Jacobian matrix of Φ at u0. (Warning: the reader
should pay attention not to confuse these with the row vectors ∇ϕi(u0), which are
the gradients of the components of Φ = (ϕi)1≤i≤n.) Therefore by iii), the vectors
τi, 1 ≤i ≤n, are linearly independent (hence, non-zero), and so they form a basis
of Rn. We shall denote by ti = τi/∥τi∥the corresponding unit vectors. If at every
P0 ∈A the tangent vectors are orthogonal, i.e., if the matrix JΦ(u0)T JΦ(u0) is
diagonal, the change of variables will be called orthogonal. If so, {t1, . . . , tn} will
be an orthonormal basis of Rn relative to the point P0.

6.6 Variable changes
229
Properties ii) and iii) have yet another important consequence. The map u →
det JΦ(u) is continuous on A′ because the determinant depends continuously upon
the matrix’ entries; moreover, det JΦ(u) ̸= 0 for any u ∈A′. We therefore deduce
det JΦ(u) > 0 ,
∀u ∈A′ ,
or
det JΦ(u) < 0 ,
∀u ∈A′ .
(6.26)
In fact, if det JΦ were both positive and negative on A′, which is open and con-
nected, then Theorem 4.30 would necessarily force the determinant to vanish at
some point of A′, contradicting iii).
Now we focus on low dimensions. In dimension 2, the ﬁrst (second, respectively)
of (6.26) says that for any u0 ∈A′ the vector τ1 can be aligned to τ2 by a
counter-clockwise (clockwise) rotation of θ ∈(0, π]. Identifying in fact each τi with
˜τi = τi + 0k ∈R3, we have
˜τ1 ∧˜τ2 =

det JΦ(u0)

k ,
(6.27)
orienting the triple (˜τ1, ˜τ2, k) positively (negatively).
In dimension 3, the triple (τ1, τ2, τ3) is positively-oriented (negatively-oriented)
if the ﬁrst (second) of (6.26) holds; in fact, (τ1 ∧τ2) · τ3 = det JΦ(u0).
Changes of variable on a region in Rn are of two types, depending on the
sign of the Jacobian determinant. If the sign is plus, the variable change is said
orientation-preserving, if the sign is minus, orientation-reversing.
Example 6.31
The map
x = Φ(u) = Au + b ,
with A a non-singular matrix of order n, deﬁnes an aﬃne change of variables

and fourth).

Therefore, Φ is a change of variables in the plane if we choose, for example, R = R2
and R′ = (0, +∞) × (−π,π ] ∪{(0, 0)}. The interior A′ = (0, +∞) × (−π,π ) has
open image under Φ given by A = R2 \ {(x, 0) ∈R2 : x ≤0}, the plane minus
the negative x-axis. The change is orthogonal, as JΦT JΦ = diag (1, r2), and
preserves the orientation, because det JΦ > 0 on A′.
Rays emanating from the origin (for θ constant) and circles centred at the origin
(r constant) are the coordinate lines. The tangent vectors τi, i = 1, 2, columns of

Take a scalar map f(x, y) deﬁned on a subset of R2 not containing the origin.
In polar coordinates it will be
˜f(r,θ ) = f(r cos θ, r sin θ) ,
or ˜f = f◦Φ. Supposing f diﬀerentiable on its domain, the chain rule (Theorem 6.14
or, more precisely, formula (6.12)) gives
∇(r,θ) ˜f = ∇f(x,y) JΦ ,
whose inverse is ∇f(x,y) = ∇(r,θ) ˜f JΦ−1. Dropping the symbol ∼for simplicity,
those identities become, by (6.28), (6.30),

Any vector ﬁeld g(x, y) = g1(x, y)i + g2(x, y)j on a subset of R2 without the

the basis {tr, tθ}:
g = grtr + gθtθ
(6.34)
(here and henceforth the subscripts r, θ do not denote partial derivatives, rather
components).

As the basis is orthonormal,
gr = g · tr = (g1i + g2j) · tr = g1 cos θ + g2 sin θ ,
gθ = g · tθ = (g1i + g2j) · tθ = −g1 sin θ + g2 cos θ .

Thus Φ is an orthogonal, orientation-preserving change of coordinates from
R′ = (0, +∞) × (−π,π ] × R ∪{(0, 0, t) : t ∈R} to R = R3. The interior of
R′ is A′ = (0, +∞) × (−π,π ) × R, whose image under Φ is the open set A =
R3 \ {(x, 0, z) ∈R3 : x ≤0, z ∈R}, the whole space minus half a plane.
The coordinate lines are: horizontal rays emanating from the z-axis, horizontal
circles centred along the z-axis, and vertical lines. The corresponding unit tangent
vectors at P ∈R3 \ {(0, 0, z) : z ∈R} are, with the obvious notations,
tr = (cos θ, sin θ, 0) ,

strictly positive on (0, +∞)×(0, π)×R. The Jacobian is invertible on that domain.
Furthermore, JΦT JΦ = diag (1, r(cos2 ϕ + r sin2 ϕ), r2 sin ϕ).

6.7 Regular surfaces
Surfaces, and in particular compact ones (deﬁned by a compact region R), were
introduced in Sect. 4.7.
Deﬁnition 6.32 A surface σ : R →R3 is regular if σ is C1 on A =
◦
R
and the Jacobian matrix Jσ has maximal rank (= 2) at every point of A.
A compact surface is regular if it is the restriction to R of a regular surface
deﬁned on an open set containing R.
The condition on Jσ is equivalent to the fact that the vectors ∂σ
∂u (u0, v0) and
∂σ
∂v (u0, v0) are linearly independent for any (u0, v0) ∈A. By Deﬁnition 6.1, such
vectors form the columns of the Jacobian Jσ
Jσ =
 ∂σ
∂u
∂σ
∂v

6.7 Regular surfaces
237
Examples 6.33
i) The surfaces seen in Examples 4.37 i), iii), iv) are regular, as simple calculations
will show.
ii) The surface of Example 4.37 ii) is regular if (and only if) ϕ is C1 on A. If so,
Jσ =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎝
1
0
0
1
∂ϕ
∂u
∂ϕ
∂v
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎠,
whose ﬁrst two rows grant the matrix rank 2.
iii) The surface σ : R × [0, 2π] →R3,
σ(u, v) = u cosv i + u sin vj + u k
parametrises the cone
x2 + y2 −z2 = 0 .
Its Jacobian is
Jσ =
⎛
⎝
cos v
−u sin v
sin v
u cosv
1
0
⎞
⎠.
As the determinants of the ﬁrst minors are u, u sin v, −u cosv, the surface is not
regular: at points (u0, v0) = (0, v0), mapped to the cone’s apex, all minors are
singular.
2
Before we continue, let us point out the use of terminology. Although Deﬁn-
ition 4.36 privileges the analytical aspects, the prevailing (by standard practice)
geometrical viewpoint uses the term surface to mean the trace Σ ⊂R3 as well,
retaining for the function σ the role of parametrisation of the surface. We follow
the mainstream and adopt this language, with the additional assumption that all
parametrisations σ be simple. In such a way, many subsequent notions will have
a more immediate, and intuitive, geometrical representation. With this matter
settled, we may now see a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6.34 A subset Σ of R3 is a regular and simple surface if Σ
admits a regular and simple parametrisation σ : R →Σ.
Let then Σ ⊂R3 be a regular simple surface parametrised by σ : R →Σ,
and P0 = σ(u0, v0) the point on Σ image of (u0, v0) ∈A =
◦
R. Since the vectors
∂σ
∂u (u0, v0), ∂σ
∂v (u0, v0) are by hypothesis linearly independent, we introduce the
map Π : R2 →R3,
Π(u, v) = σ(u0, v0) + ∂σ
∂u (u0, v0) (u −u0) + ∂σ
∂v (u0, v0) (v −v0) ,
(6.47)

238
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
that parametrises a plane through P0 (recall Example 4.37 i)). It is called the
tangent plane to the surface at P0. Justifying the notation, notice that the
functions
u →σ(u, v0)
and
v →σ(u0, v)
deﬁne two regular curves lying on Σ and passing through P0. Their tangent vectors
at P0 are ∂σ
∂u (u0, v0) and ∂σ
∂v (u0, v0); therefore the tangent lines to such curves at
P0 lie on the tangent plane, and actually they span it by linear combination. In
general, the tangent plane contains the tangent vector to any regular curve passing
through P0 and lying on the surface Σ.
Deﬁnition 6.35 The vector
ν(u0, v0) = ∂σ
∂u (u0, v0) ∧∂σ
∂v (u0, v0)
(6.48)
is the surface’s normal (vector) at P0. The corresponding unit normal will
be indicated by n(u0, v0) =
ν(u0, v0)
∥ν(u0, v0)∥.
Due to the surface’s regularity, ν(u0, v0) is non-zero. It is also orthogonal to
∂σ
∂u (u0, v0) and ∂σ
∂v (u0, v0), so if we compute it at P0 it will be orthogonal to
the tangent plane at P0; this explains the name (Fig. 6.14).

Figure 6.15. Normal vector of a surface
Example 6.36
i) The regular surface σ : R →R3, σ(u, v) = u i+v j+ϕ(u, v) k, with ϕ ∈C1(R)
(see Example 6.33 ii)), has
ν(u, v) = −∂ϕ
∂u (u, v) i −∂ϕ
∂v (u, v) j + k .
(6.49)
Note that, at any point, the normal vector points upwards, because ν · k > 0
(Fig. 6.15).
ii) Let σ : [0, π]×[0, 2π] →R3 be the parametrisation of the ellipsoid with centre
the origin and semi-axes a, b, c > 0 (see Example 4.37 iv)). Then
∂σ
∂u (u, v) = a cosu cos v i + b cosu sin v j −c sin u k ,
∂σ
∂v (u, v) = −a sin u sin v i + b sin u cosv j + 0k ,
whence
ν(u, v) = bc sin2u cosv i + ac sin2u sin v j + ab sin u cosu k .
If the surface is a sphere of radius r (when a = b = c = r),
ν(u, v) = r sin u(r sin u cosv i + r sin u sin v j + r cos u k)
so the normal ν at x is proportional to x, and thus aligned with the radial
vector.
2
Just like with the tangent to a curve, one could prove that the tangent plane is
intrinsic to the surface, in other words it does not depend on the parametrisation.
As a result the normal’s direction is intrinsic as well, while length and orientation
vary with the chosen parametrisation.

240
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
6.7.1 Changing parametrisation
Suppose Σ is regular, with two parametrisations σ : R →Σ and 1σ : 1R →Σ.
Deﬁnition 6.37 The parametrisations 1σ and σ are congruent if there
is a change of variables Φ : 1R →R such that 1σ = σ ◦Φ. If Σ is a compact
surface, Φ is required to be the restriction of a change of variables between
open sets containing 1R and R.
Although the deﬁnition does not require the parametrisations to be simple, we
shall assume they are throughout. The property of being regular and simple is
preserved by congruence.
Bearing in mind the discussion of Sect. 6.6, if A and 1A are the interiors of R
and 1R, then either
det JΦ > 0
on
1A
or
det JΦ < 0
on
1A .
In the former case 1σ is equivalent to σ, while in the latter 1σ is anti-equivalent
to σ. In other terms, an orientation-preserving (orientation-reversing) change of
variables induces a parametrisation equivalent (anti-equivalent) to the given one.
The tangent vectors ∂1σ
∂˜u and ∂1σ
∂˜v can be easily expressed as linear combinations
of ∂σ
∂u and ∂σ
∂v . As it happens, recalling (6.46) and the chain rule (6.9), and
omitting to write the point (u0, v0) = Φ(˜u0, ˜v0) of diﬀerentiation, we have
 ∂1σ
∂˜u
∂1σ
∂˜v

 ∂σ

setting JΦ =

, these become
∂1σ
∂˜u = m11
∂σ
∂u + m21
∂σ
∂v ,
∂1σ
∂˜v = m12
∂σ
∂u + m22
∂σ
∂v .
They show, on one hand, that ∂1σ
∂˜u and ∂1σ
∂˜v generate the same plane of ∂σ
∂u and
∂σ
∂v , as prescribed by (6.47); therefore
the tangent plane to a surface Σ is invariant for congruent parametrisations.
On the other hand, the previous expressions and property (4.8) imply
∂1σ
∂˜u ∧∂1σ
∂˜v = m11m12
∂σ
∂u ∧∂σ
∂u + m11m22

From these follows that the normal vectors at the point P0 satisfy
1ν = (det JΦ) ν ,
(6.50)
which in turn corroborates that
two congruent parametrisations generate parallel normal vectors; the two ori-
entations are the same for equivalent parametrisations (orientation-preserving
change of variables), otherwise they are opposite (orientation-reversing
change).
6.7.2 Orientable surfaces
Proposition 6.27 guarantees two parametrisations of the same regular, simple curve
Γ of Rm are congruent, hence there are always two orientations to choose from.
The analogue result for surfaces cannot hold, and we will see counterexamples (the
M¨obius strip, the Klein bottle). Thus the following deﬁnition makes sense.
Deﬁnition 6.38 A regular simple surface Σ ⊂R3 is said orientable if any
two regular and simple parametrisations are congruent.
The name comes from the fact that the surface may be endowed with two ori-
entations (na¨ıvely, the crossing directions) depending on the normal vector. All
equivalent parametrisations will have the same orientation, whilst anti-equivalent
ones will have opposite orientations. It can be proved that a regular and simple
surface parametrised by an open plane region R is always orientable.
When the regular, simple surface is parametrised by a non-open region, the
picture becomes more complicated and the surface may, or not, be orientable. With
the help of the next two examples we shed some light on the matter. Consider ﬁrst
the cylindrical strip of radius 1 and height 2, see Fig. 6.16, left.
We parametrise this compact surface by the map
σ : [0, 2π] × [−1, 1] →R3 ,
σ(u, v) = cos u i + sin u j + vk ,
(6.51)
regular and simple because, for instance, injective on [0, 2π) × [−1, 1]. The associ-
ated normal
ν(u, v) = cos u i + sin u j + 0k

242
6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
constantly points outside the cylinder. To nurture visual intuition, we might say
that a person walking on the surface (staying on the plane xy, for instance) can
return to the starting point always keeping the normal vector on the same side.
The surface is orientable, it has two sides – an inside and an outside – and if the
person wanted to go to the opposite side it would have to cross the top rim v = 1
or the bottom one v = −1. (The rims in question are the surface’s boundaries, as
we shall see below.)
The second example is yet another strip, called M¨obius strip, and shown in
Fig. 6.16, right. To construct it, start from the previous cylinder, cut it along a
vertical segment, and then glue the ends back together after twisting one by 180◦.
The precise parametrisation σ : [0, 2π] × [−1, 1] →R3 is
σ(u, v) =

1 −v
2 cos u
2

cos u i +

1 −v
2 cos u
2

sin u j −v
2 sin u
2 k .
For u = 0, i.e., at the point P0 = (1, 0, 0) = σ(0, 0), the normal vector is ν = 1
2k.
As u increases, the normal varies with continuity, except that as we go back to
P0 = σ(2π, 0) after a complete turn, we have ν = −1
2k, opposite to the one we
started with. This means that our imaginary friend starts from P0 and after one
loop returns to the same point (without crossing the rim) upside down! The M¨obius
strip is a non-orientable surface; it has one side only and one boundary: starting
at any point of the boundary and going around the origin twice, for instance, we
reach all points of the boundary, in contrast to what happens for the cylinder.
At any rate the M¨obius strip embodies a somehow “pathological” situation.
Surfaces (compact or not) delimiting elementary solids – spheres, ellipsoid, cylin-
ders, cones and the like – are all orientable. More generally,
Proposition 6.39 Every regular simple surface Σ contained in the boundary
∂Ω of an open, connected and bounded set Ω ⊂R3 is orientable.
We can thus choose for Σ either the orientation from inside towards outside
Ω, or the converse. In the ﬁrst case the unit normal n points outwards, in the
second it points inwards.

6.7.3 Boundary of a surface; closed surfaces
The other important object concerning a surface is the boundary, mentioned above.
This is a rather delicate notion if one wishes to discuss it in full generality, but we
shall present the matter in an elementary way.
Let Σ ⊂R3 be a regular and simple surface, which we assume to be a closed
subset Σ = Σ of R3 (in the sense of Deﬁnition 4.5). Then let σ : R ⊂R2 →Σ be
a parametrisation over the closed region R. Calling A =
◦
R the interior of R, the
image Σ◦
σ = σ(A) is a subset of Σ = σ(R). The diﬀerence set
∂Σσ = Σ \ Σ◦
σ
will be called boundary of Σ (relative to σ). Subsequent examples will show
that ∂Σσ contains all points that are obvious boundary points of Σ in purely
geometrical terms, but might also contain points that depend on the chosen para-
metrisation; this justiﬁes the subscript σ. It is thus logical to deﬁne the boundary
of Σ (viewed as an intrinsic object to the surface) as the set
∂Σ =
2
σ
∂Σσ ,
where the intersection is taken over all possible parametrisations (non-regular as
well) of Σ. We point out that the symbol ∂Σ denoted in Sect. 4.3 the frontier of
Σ, seen as subset of R3; for regular surfaces this set coincides with Σ = Σ, since
no interior points are present. Our treatise of surfaces will only involve the notion
of boundary, not of frontier. Here are the promised examples.
Examples 6.40
i) The upper hemisphere with centre (0, 0, 1) and radius 1
Σ = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : x2 + y2 + (z −1)2 = 1, z ≥1}
is a closed set Σ = Σ inside R3. Geometrically, it is quite intuitive (Fig. 6.17,
left) that its boundary is the circle
∂Σ = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : x2 + y2 + (z −1)2 = 1, z = 1} .
If one parametrises Σ by
σ : R = {(u, v) ∈R2 : u2+v2 ≤1} →R3 ,
σ(u, v) = ui+vj+(1+

u2 + v2)k ,
it follows that
Σ◦
σ = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : x2 + y2 + (z −1)2 = 1, z > 1} ,
so Σ \ Σ◦
σ is precisely the boundary we claimed. Parametrising Σ with spherical
coordinates, instead,
1σ : 1R = [0, π
2 ]×[0, 2π] →R3 ,
1σ(u, v) = sin u cos v i+sinu sin v j+(1+cosu)k ,
so 1A = (0, π
2 ) × (0, 2π), we obtain Σ◦
σ as the portion of surface lying above the
plane z = 1, without the equatorial arc joining the North pole (0, 0, 2) to (1, 0, 1)
on the plane xz (Fig. 6.17, right); analytically,

\{(x, y, z) ∈R3 : x > 0, y = 0, x2 + (z −1)2 = 1} .
Besides the points on the geometric boundary, Σ◦
σ consists of the aforementioned
arc, which is image of part of the boundary of 1R; these points depend on the
particular parametrisation we have chosen.
ii) Let
Σ = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : x2 + y2 = 1, |z| ≤1}
be the (closed) cylinder of Fig. 6.18, whose boundary ∂Σ consists of the circles
x2 + y2 = 1, z = ±1. Given u0 ∈[0, 2π], we may parametrise Σ by
σu0 : [0, 2π] × [−1, 1] →R3 ,
σu0(u, v) = cos(u −u0) i + sin(u −u0) j + vk ,
generalising the parametrisation σ = σ0 seen in (6.51). Then
Σ◦
σu0 = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : x2 + y2 = 1, |z| < 1}
\{(cosu0, sin u0, z) ∈R3 : |z| < 1} ,
and ∂Σσu0 contains, apart from the two circles giving ∂Σ, also the vertical
segment {(cos u0, sin u0, z) ∈R3 : |z| < 1}. Intersecting all sets ∂Σσu0 – any two
of them is enough – gives the geometric boundary of Σ.
iii) Consider at last the surface

where Γ is the Jordan arc in the plane xy deﬁned by

and

ϕ(u), ψ(u), v

. It is easy to convince ourselves that the
boundary ∂Σσ of σ is ∂Σσ = Γ0 ∪Γ1 ∪S0, where Γ0 = Γ × {0}, Γ1 = Γ × {1}
and S0 = {(0, 0)} × [0, 1] (Fig. 6.19, right). But if we extend the maps ϕ and
ψ periodically to the intervals [k, k + 1], we may consider, for any u0 ∈R, the
parametrisations σu0 : R →R3 given by σu0(u, v) =

ϕ(u −u0), ψ(u −u0), z

,
for which Σ◦
σu0 = Γ0 ∪Γ1 ∪Su0, Su0 = {γ(u0)} × [0, 1]. We conclude that the
vertical segment Su0 does depend upon the parametrisation, whereas the top
and bottom loops Γ0, Γ1 are common to all parametrisations. In summary, the
boundary of Σ is the union of the loops, ∂Σ = Γ0 ∪Γ1.

6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
Among surfaces a relevant role is played by those that are closed. A regular,
simple surface Σ ⊂R3 is closed if it is bounded (as a subset of R3) and has
no boundary (∂Σ = ∅). This notion, too, is heavily dependent on the surface’s
geometry, and diﬀers from the topological closure of Deﬁnition 4.5 (namely, each
closed surface is necessarily a closed subset of R3, but there are topologically-
closed surfaces with non-empty boundary). Examples of closed surfaces include
the sphere and the torus, which we introduce now.
Examples 6.41
i) Arguing as in Example 6.40 i), we see that the parametrisation of the unit
sphere Σ = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : x2 + y2 + z2 = 1} by spherical coordinates (Ex-
ample 4.37 iii)) has a boundary, the semi-circle from the North pole to the South
pole lying in the half-plane x ≥0, y = 0. Any rotation of the coordinate system
will produce another parametrisation whose boundary is a semi-circle joining
antipodal points. It is straightforward to see that the boundaries’ intersection is
empty.
ii) A torus is the surface Σ built by identifying the top and bottom boundaries
of the cylinder of Example 6.40 ii). It can also be obtained by a 2π-revolution
around the z-axis of a circle of radius r lying on a plane containing the axis,
having centre at a point of the plane xy at a distance R + r, R ≥0, from the
axis (see Fig. 6.20). A parametrisation is σ : [0, 2π] × [0, 2π] →R3 with
σ(u, v) = (R + r cos u) cosv i + (R + r cos u) sin v j + r sin u k .
The boundary ∂Σσ is the union of the circle on z = 0 with centre the origin and
radius R + r, and the circle on y = 0 centred at (R, 0, 0) with radius r.
Here, as well, changing the parametrisation shows the geometric boundary ∂Σ
is empty, making the torus a closed surface.

plane curves.

6.7 Regular surfaces
247
Theorem 6.42 A closed orientable surface Σ divides the space R3 in two
open regions Ai, Ae whose common frontier is Σ. The region Ai (the in-
terior) is bounded, while the other region Ae (the exterior) is unbounded.
Nonetheless, there do exist closed non-orientable surfaces, which do not separ-
ate space in an inside and an outside. A traditional example is the Klein bottle,
built from the M¨obius strip in the same fashion the torus is constructed by glueing
the cylinder’s two rims.
6.7.4 Piecewise-regular surfaces
This generalisation of regularity allows the surface to contain curves where diﬀeren-
tiability fails, and grants us a means of dealing with surfaces delimiting polyhedra
such as cubes, pyramids, and truncated pyramids, or solids of revolution like trun-
cated cones or cylinders. As in Sect. refsec:bordo, we shall assume all surfaces are
closed subsets of R3.
Deﬁnition 6.43 A subset Σ ⊂R3 is a piecewise-regular, simple surface
if it is the union of ﬁnitely many regular, simple surfaces Σ1, . . . , Σ K whose
pairwise intersections Σh ∩Σk (if not empty or a point) are piecewise-regular
curves Γhk contained in the boundary of both Σh and Σk.
The analogue deﬁnition holds for piecewise-regular compact surfaces.
Each surface Σk is called a face (or component) of Σ, and the intersection
curve between any two faces is an edge of Σ .
A piecewise regular simple surface Σ is orientable if every component is ori-
entable in such a way that adjacent components have compatible orientations.
Proposition 6.39 then extends to (compact) piecewise-regular, simple surfaces.
The boundary ∂Σ of a piecewise-regular simple surface Σ is the closure of
the set of points belonging to the boundary of one, and one only, component.
Equivalently, consider the union of the single components’ boundaries, without
the points common to two or more components, and then take the closure of this
set: this is ∂Σ. A piecewise-regular simple surface is closed if bounded and with
empty boundary.
Examples 6.44
i) The frontier of a cube is piecewise regular, and has the cube’s six faces as
components; it is obviously orientable and closed (Fig. 6.21, left).
ii) The piecewise-regular surface obtained from the previous one by taking away
two opposite faces (Fig. 6.21, right) is still orientable, but no longer closed. Its
boundary is the union of the boundaries of the faces removed.

6 Diﬀerential calculus for vector-valued functions
Figure 6.21. The cubes of Examples 6.44
Remark 6.45 Example ii) provides us with the excuse for explaining why one
should insist on the closure of the boundary, instead of taking the mere boundary.
Consider a cube aligned with the Cartesian axes, from which we have removed the
top and bottom faces. The union of the boundaries of the 4 faces left is given by
the 12 edges forming the skeleton. Getting rid of the points common to two faces
leaves us with the 4 horizontal top edges and the 4 bottom ones, without the 8
vertices. Closing what is left recovers the 8 missing vertices, so the boundary is
precisely the union of the 8 horizontal edges.

11. Closed, regular, piecewise-regular arcs:
a) The arc is closed because γ(0) = (0, 1) = γ(2π).
Moreover, γ′(t) =

2(t −π)(2t2 −4πt + π2), −sin t) implies that γ′(t) is C1 on
[0, 2π]. Next, notice sin t = 0 only when t = 0, π ,2π, and γ′(0) = (−2π3, 0) ̸= 0,
γ′(2π) = (−10π3, 0) ̸= 0, γ′(π) = 0. The only non-regular point is thus the
one corresponding to t = π. Altogether, the arc is piecewise regular.
b) The fact that γ(0) = (0, 0) and γ(1) = (0, 1) implies the arc is not closed.
What is more,
γ′(t) = (4π sin 2πt cos 2πt, 1) ̸= (0, 0) ,
∀t ∈[0, 1] ,
making the arc regular.
12. Note γ is continuous for any t ∈R with
γ′(t) =
 (α, 3t2, 0)
if t < 0 ,
(α2 cos α2t, 0, 3t2)
if t ≥0 .
Certainly γ′(t) ̸= 0 for t ̸= 0 and any α ∈R. To study the point t = 0, observe
that
γ′(0−) = lim
t→0−γ′(t) = (α, 0, 0) ,
γ′(0+) = lim
t→0+ γ′(t) = (α2, 0, 0) ,
so γ′(0) exists if α = α2, i.e., if α = 0 or α = 1. If α = 0 then γ′(0) = 0, while for
α = 1 we have γ′(0) = (1, 0, 0) ̸= 0. In conclusion, the only value of regularity is
α = 1.

Notice the arc’s trace lies on the surface of the ellipsoid x2 + y2 + 2z2 = 2. The
initial point is (
√
2, 0, 0), the end point (0, 0, 1) (see Fig. 6.22).
18. a) The surface is simple if, for (u1, v1), (u2, v2) ∈R2, we have
σ(u1, v1) = σ(u2, v2)
⇒
(u1, v1) = (u2, v2) .

d) Imposing
uv = 1 ,
1 + 3u = 4 ,
v2 + 2u = 3
shows the point P0 = (1, 4, 3) is the image under σ of (u0, v0) = (1, 1). Therefore
the tangent plane in question is
Π(u, v) = σ(1, 1) + ∂σ
∂u (1, 1) (u −1) + ∂σ
∂v (1, 1) (v −1)
= (1, 4, 3) + (1, 3, 2)(u −1) + (1, 0, 3)(v −1)
= (u + v −1) i + (3u + 1) j + (2u + 3v −2) k .
Using Cartesian coordinates x = u + v −1, y = 3u + 1, z = 2u + 3v −2, the plane
reads 9x −y −3z + 4 = 0.
19. a) As u varies in [0, 2π], the vector cos(2 −u) i + sin(2 −u) j runs along the
unit circle in the plane z = 0, while for v in [0, 1], the vector v2 k describes the
segment [0, 1] on the z-axis. Consequently Σ is a cylinder of height 1 with axis on
the z’s.
b) Using formula (6.48) the normal vector deﬁned by σ1 is
ν1(u, v) = −2v cos(2 −u) i −2v sin(2 −u) j ,
while the normal of σ2 is
ν2(u, v) = 2 sin(3 + 2u) i + 2 cos(3 + 2u) j .
If P = σ(u1, v1) = σ2(u2, v2) is an arbitrary point on Σ, then
cos(2 −u1) = sin(3 + 2u2)
and
sin(2 −u1) = cos(3 + 2u2) ,
and so
ν1(u1, v1) = −v1ν2(u2, v2) .
Since v1 is non-negative, the orientations are opposite.
c) We have P0 = σ

. Hence ν1(P0) = −j, while ν2(P0) = 2j.
The unit normals then are n1(P0) = −j and n2(P0) = j.
20. a) Expression (6.49) yields
ν(u, v) = −(2u + 3v) i −(3u + 2v) j + k ,
normalising which produces

Applying diﬀerential calculus
We conclude with this chapter the treatise of diﬀerential calculus for multivariate
and vector-values functions. Two are the themes of concern: the Implicit Function
Theorem with its applications, and the study of constrained extrema.
Given an equation in two or more independent variables, the Implicit Function
Theorem provides suﬃcient conditions to express one variable in terms of the
others. It helps to examine the nature of the level sets of a function, which, under
regularity assumptions, are curves and surfaces in space. Finally, it furnishes the
tools for studying the locus deﬁned by a system of equations.
Constrained extrema, in other words extremum points of a map restricted to
a given subset of the domain, can be approached in two ways. The ﬁrst method,
called parametric, reduces the problem to understading unconstrained extrema
in lower dimension; the other geometrically-rooted method, relying on Lagrange
multipliers, studies the stationary points of a new function, the Lagrangian of the
problem.
7.1 Implicit Function Theorem
An equation of type
f(x, y) = 0
(7.1)
sets up an implicit relationship between the variables x and y; in geometrical terms
it deﬁnes the locus of points P = (x, y) in the plane whose coordinates satisfy the
equation. Very often it is possible to write one variable as a function of the other
at least locally (in the neighbourhood of one solution), as y = ϕ(x) or x = ψ(y).
For example, the equation
f(x, y) = ax + by + c = 0 ,
with
a2 + b2 ̸= 0 ,
deﬁnes a line on the plane, and is equivalent to y = ϕ(x) = −1
b(ax + c), if b ̸= 0,
or x = ψ(y) = −1
a(by + c) if a ̸= 0.

7 Applying diﬀerential calculus
Instead,
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 −r2 = 0 ,
with
r > 0
deﬁnes a circle centred at the origin with radius r; if (x0, y0) belongs to the circle
and y0 > 0, we may solve the equation for y on a neighbourhood of x0, and
write y = ϕ(x) =
√
r2 −x2; if x0 < 0, we can write x = ψ(y) = −

r2 −y2 on a
neighbourhood of y0. It is not possible to write y in terms of x on a neighbourhood
of x0 = r or −r, nor x as a function of y around y0 = r or −r, unless we violate
the deﬁnition of function itself. But in any of the cases where solving explicitly
for one variable is possible, one partial derivative of f is non-zero ( ∂f
∂y = b ̸= 0,
∂f
∂x = a ̸= 0 for the line, ∂f
∂y = 2y0 > 0, ∂f
∂x = 2x0 < 0 for the circle); conversely,
where one variable cannot be made a function of the other the partial derivative
is zero.
Moving on to more elaborate situations, we must distinguish between the ex-
istence of a map between the independent variables expressing (7.1) in an explicit
way, and the possibility of representing such map in terms of known elementary
functions. For example, in
y e2x + cos y −2 = 0
we can solve for x explicitly,
x = 1
2 log(2 −cos y) −1
2 log y ,
but we are not able to do the same with
x5 + 3x2y −2y4 −1 = 0 .
Nonetheless, analysing the graph of the function, e.g., around the solution (x0, y0) =
(1, 0), shows that the equation deﬁnes y in terms of x, and the study we are about
to embark on will conﬁrm rigorously the claim (see Example 7.2). Thus there is
a huge interest in ﬁnding criteria that ensure a function y = y(x), say, at least
exists, even if the variable y cannot be written in an analytically-explicit way in
terms of x. This lays a solid groundwork for the employ of numerical methods. We
discuss below a milestone result in Mathematics, the Implicit Function Theorem,
also known as Dini’s Theorem in Italy, which yields a suﬃcient condition for the
function y(x) to exist; the condition is the non-vanishing of the partial derivative
of f in the variable we are solving for.
All these considerations evidently apply to equations with three or more vari-
ables, like
f(x, y, z) = 0 .
(7.2)
Under special assumptions, we are allowed to deﬁne z = ϕ(x, y) as a function of x
and y. A second generalisation concerns systems of equations.
Numerous are the applications of the Implicit Function Theorem. To name a
few, many laws of Physics (think of Thermodynamics) tie two or more quantities

7.1 Implicit Function Theorem
263
through implicit relationships which, depending on the system’s speciﬁc state, can
be made explicit. In geometry the Theorem allows to describe as a regular simple
surface, if locally, the locus of points whose coordinates satisfy (7.2); it lies at the
heart of an ‘intrinsic’ viewpoint that regards a surface as a set of points deﬁned
by algebraic and transcendental equations.
So let us begin to see the two-dimensional version. Its proof may be found in
Appendix A.1.4, p. 518.
Theorem 7.1 Let Ω be a non-empty open set in R2 and f : Ω →R a C1 map.
Assume at the point (x0, y0) ∈Ω we have f(x0, y0) = 0. If ∂f
∂y (x0, y0) ̸= 0,
there exists a neighbourhood I of x0 and a function ϕ : I →R such that:
i)

x,ϕ (x)

∈Ω for any x ∈I;
ii) y0 = ϕ(x0);
iii) f

x,ϕ (x)

= 0 for any x ∈I;
iv) ϕ is a C1 map on I with derivative
ϕ′(x) = −
∂f
∂x

x,ϕ (x)

∂f
∂y

x,ϕ (x)
 .
(7.3)
On a neighbourhood of (x0, y0) moreover, the zero set of f coincides with the
graph of ϕ.
We remark that x →γ(x) =

x,ϕ (x)

is a curve in the plane whose trace is
precisely the graph of ϕ.
Example 7.2
Consider the equation
x5 + 3x2y −2y4 = 1 ,
already considered in the introduction. It is solved by (x0, y0) = (1, 0). To study
the existence of other solutions in the neighbourhood of that point we deﬁne the
function
f(x, y) = x5 + 3x2y −2y4 −1 .
We have fy(x, y) = 3x2 −8y3, hence fy(1, 0) = 3 > 0. The above theorem
guarantees there is a function y = ϕ(x), diﬀerentiable on a neighbourhood I of
x0 = 1, such that ϕ(1) = 0 and
x5 + 3x2ϕ(x) −2

ϕ(x)
4 = 1 ,
x ∈I .
From fx(x, y) = 5x4 + 6xy we get fx(1, 0) = 5, so ϕ′(1) = −5
3. The map ϕ is
decreasing at x0 = 1, where the tangent to its graph is y = −5
3(x −1).

7 Applying diﬀerential calculus
In case ∂f
∂x(x0, y0) ̸= 0, we arrive at a similar result to Theorem 7.1 in which
x and y are swapped. To summarise (see Fig. 7.1),
Corollary 7.3 Let Ω be a non-empty open set in R2 and f : Ω →R a C1
map. The equation f(x, y) = 0 can be solved for one variable, y = ϕ(x) or
x = ψ(y), around any zero (x0, y0) of f at which ∇f(x0, y0) ̸= 0 (i.e., around
each regular point).
There remains to understand what is the true structure of the zero set in the
neighbourhood of a stationary point. Assuming f is C2, the previous chapter’s
study of the Hessian matrix Hf(x0, y0) provides useful information.
i) If Hf(x0, y0) is deﬁnite (positive or negative), (x0, y0) is a local strict minimum
or maximum; therefore f will be strictly positive or negative on a whole punctured
neighbourhood of (x0, y0), making (x0, y0) an isolated zero for f. An example is
the origin for the map f(x, y) = x2 + y2.
ii) If Hf(x0, y0) is indeﬁnite, i.e., it has eigenvalues λ1 > 0 and λ2 < 0, one can
prove that the zero set of f around (x0, y0) is not the graph of a function, because it
consists of two distinct curves that meet at (x0, y0) and form an angle that depends
upon the eigenvalues’ ratio. For instance, the zeroes of f(x, y) = 4x2 −25y2 belong
to the lines y = ± 2
5x, crossing at the origin (Fig. 7.2, left).

f(x, y) = x4 −16y2 (right)
iii) If Hf(x0, y0) has one or both eigenvalues equal zero, nothing can be said in
general. For example, assuming the origin as point (x0, y0), the zeroes of f(x, y) =
x4 −y3 coincide with the graph of y =
3√
x4 (Fig. 7.2, centre). The map f(x, y) =
x4 −16y2, instead, vanishes along the parabolas y = ± 1
4x2 that meet at the origin
(Fig. 7.2, right).
We state the Implicit Function Theorem for functions in three variables. Its
proof is easily obtained by adapting the one given in two dimensions.
Theorem 7.4 Let Ω be a non-empty open subset of R3 and f : Ω →R a
map of class C1 with a zero at (x0, y0, z0) ∈Ω. If ∂f
∂z (x0, y0, z0) ̸= 0, there
exist a neighbourhood A of (x0, y0) and a function ϕ : A →R such that:
i)

x, y,ϕ (x, y)

∈Ω for any (x, y) ∈A;
ii) z0 = ϕ(x0, y0);
iii) f

x, y,ϕ (x, y)

= 0 for any (x, y) ∈A;

(7.4)
Moreover, on a neighbourhood of (x0, y0, z0) the zero set of f coincides with
the graph of ϕ.
The function (x, y) →σ(x, y, z) =

x, y,ϕ (x, y)

deﬁnes a regular simple surface
in space, whose properties will be examined in Sect. 7.2.
The result may be applied, as happened above, under the assumption the point
(x0, y0, z0) be regular, possibly after swapping the independent variables’ roles.
These two theorems are in fact subsumed by a general statement on vector-
valued maps.

7 Applying diﬀerential calculus
Let n, m be integers with n ≥2 and 1 ≤m ≤n −1. Take an open, non-empty
set Ω in Rn and let F : Ω →Rm be a C1 map on it. Select m of the n independent
variables x1, x2, . . . , xn; without loss of generality we can take the last m variables
(always possible by permuting the variables). Then write x as two sets of coordin-
ates (ξ, μ), where ξ = (x1, . . . , xn−m) ∈Rn−m and μ = (xn−m+1, . . . , xn) ∈Rm.
Correspondingly, decompose the Jacobian of F at x ∈Ω into the matrix JξF (x)
with m rows and n−m columns containing the ﬁrst n−m columns of JF (x), and
the m × m matrix JμF (x) formed by the remaining m columns of JF (x).
We are ready to solve locally the implicit equation F (x) = 0, now reading
F (ξ, μ) = 0, and obtain μ = Φ(ξ).
Theorem 7.5 (Implicit Function Theorem, or Dini’s Theorem) With
the above conventions, let x0 = (ξ0, μ0) ∈Ω be a point such that F (x0) = 0.
If the matrix JμF (x0) is non-singular there exist neighbourhoods A ⊆Ω of
x0, and I of ξ0 in Rn−m, such that the zero set
{x ∈A : F (x) = 0}
of F coincides with the graph
{x =

Theorems 7.1 and 7.4 are special instances of the above, as can be seen taking
n = 2, m = 1, and n = 3, m = 1. The next example elucidates yet another case of
interest.
Example 7.6
Consider the system of two equations in three variables
 f1(x, y, z) = 0
f2(x, y, z) = 0
where fi are C1 on an open set Ω in R3, and call x0 = (x0, y0, z0) ∈Ω a solution.
Specialising the theorem with n = 3, m = 2 and F = (f1, f2) ensures that if

7.1.1 Local invertibility of a function
One application is the following: if the Jacobian of a regular map of Rn is non-
singular, then the function is invertible around the point.
This generalises to multivariable calculus a property of functions of one real
variable, namely: if f is C1 around x0 ∈dom f ⊆R and if f ′(x0) ̸= 0, then
f ′ has constant sign around x0; as such it is strictly monotone, hence invertible;
furthermore, f −1 is diﬀerentiable and (f −1)′(y0) = 1/f ′(x0).
Proposition 7.7 Let f : dom f ⊆Rn →Rn be C1 around a point x0 ∈
dom f. If Jf(x0) is non-singular, the inverse function x = f −1(y) is well
deﬁned on a neighbourhood of y0 = f(x0), of class C1, and satisﬁes
J(f −1)(y0) =

Jf(x0)
−1 .
(7.6)
Proof.
Deﬁne the auxiliary map F : dom f × Rn ⊆R2n →Rn by F (x, y) =
f(x) −y. Then F (x0, y0) = 0 and JF (x0, y0) = ( Jf(x0) , I ) (an
n × 2n matrix). Since JxF (x0, y0) = Jf(x0), Theorem 7.5 guarantees
there is a neighbourhood Br(y0) and a C1 map g : Br(y0) →dom f
such that F

g(y), y

= 0, i.e., f

g(y)

= y, ∀y ∈Br(y0). Therefore
g(y) = f −1(y), so (7.6) follows from (7.5).
2
The formula for the Jacobian of the inverse function was obtained in Corollary 6.16
as a consequence of the chain rule; that corollary’s assumptions are eventually
substantiated by the previous proposition.
What we have seen can be read in terms of a system of equations. Let us
interpret
f(x) = y
(7.7)
as a (non-linear) system of n equations in n unknowns, where the right-hand side
y is given and x is the solution. Suppose, for a given datum y0, that we know a

268
7 Applying diﬀerential calculus
solution x0. If the Jacobian Jf(x0) is non-singular, the equation (7.7) admits one,
and only one solution x in the proximity of x0, for any y suﬃciently close to y0.
In turn, the Jacobian’s invertibility at x0 is equivalent to the fact that the linear
system
f(x0) + Jf(x0)(x −x0) = y ,
(7.8)
obtained by linearising the left-hand side of (7.7) around x0, admits a solution
whichever y ∈Rn is taken (it suﬃces to write the system as Jf(x0)x = y −
f(x0) + Jf(x0)x0 and notice the right-hand side assumes any value of Rn as y
varies in Rn).
In conclusion, the knowledge of one solution x0 of a non-linear equation for a
given datum y0, provided the linearised equation around that point can be solved,
guarantees the solvability of the non-linear equation for any value of the datum
that is suﬃciently close to y0.
Example 7.8
The system of non-linear equations
 x3 + y3 −2xy = a
3x2 + xy2 = b
admits (x0, y0) = (1, 2) as solution for (a, b) = (5, 7). Calling f(x, y) = (x3 +
y3 −2xy, 3x2 + xy2), we have
Jf(x, y) =
	
3x2 −2y
3y2 −2x
6x + y2
2xy

.
As
det Jf(1, 2) = det
	
10

= 104 > 0 ,
we can say the system admits a unique solution (x, y) for any choice of a, b close
enough to 5, 7 respectively.

7.2 Level curves and level surfaces
At this juncture we can resume level sets L(f, c) of a given function f, seen
in (4.20). The diﬀerential calculus developed so far allows us to describe such
sets at least in the case of suitably regular functions. The study of level sets oﬀers
useful informations on the function’s behaviour, as the constant c varies. At the
same time, solving an equation like
f(x, y) = 0 ,
or
f(x, y, z) = 0 ,
is, as a matter of fact, analogous to determining the level set L(f, 0) of f. Un-
der suitable assumptions, as we know, implicit relations of this type among the
independent variables generate regular and simple curves, or surfaces, in space.
In the sequel we shall consider only two and three dimensions, beginning from
the former situation.

7.2 Level curves and level surfaces
269
7.2.1 Level curves
Let then f be a real map of two real variables; given c ∈im f, denote by L(f, c) the
corresponding level set and let x0 ∈L(f, c). Suppose f is C1 on a neighbourhood
of the regular point x0, so that ∇f(x0) ̸= 0. Corollary 7.3 applies to the map
f(x) −c to say that on a certain neighbourhood B(x0) of x0 the points of L(f, c)
lie on a regular simple curve γ : I →B(x0) (a graph in one of the variables);
moreover, the point t0 ∈I such that γ(t0) = x0 is in the interior of I. In other
terms,
L(f, c) ∩B(x0) = {x ∈R2 : x = γ(t), with t ∈I} ,
whence
f

γ(t)

= c
∀t ∈I .
(7.9)
If the argument is valid for any point of L(f, c), hence if f is C1 on an open set
containing L(f, c) and all points of L(f, c) are regular, the level set is made of
traces of regular, simple curves. If so, one speaks of level curves of f. The next
property is particularly important (see Fig. 7.3).
Proposition 7.9 The gradient of a map is orthogonal to level curves at any
of their regular points.
Proof.
Diﬀerentiating (7.9) at t0 ∈I (recall (6.13)) gives
∇f(x0) · γ′(t) = 0 ,
and the result follows .
2
Moving along a level curve from x0 maintains the function constant, whereas in
the perpendicular direction the function undergoes the maximum variation (by
Proposition 5.10). It can turn out useful to remark that curlf, as of (6.7), is
always orthogonal to the gradient, so it is tangent to the level curves of f.

Fig. 7.4 shows the relationship between level curves and the graph of a map.
Recall that the level curves deﬁned by f(x, y) = c are the projections on the xy-
plane of the intersection between the graph of f and the planes z = c. In this
way, if we vary c by a ﬁxed increment and plot the corresponding level curves, the
latter will be closer to each other where the graph is “steeper”, and sparser where
it “ﬂattens out”.

Patently, a level set may contain non-regular points of f, hence stationary
points. In such a case the level set may not be representable, around the point, as
trace of a curve.

The level set L(f, 0) of
f(x, y) = x4 −x2 + y2
is shown in Fig. 7.7. The origin is a saddle-like stationary point. On every neigh-
bourhood of the origin the level set consists of two branches that intersect or-
thogonally; as such, it cannot be the graph of a function in one of the variables.
2
Archetypal examples of how level curves might be employed are the maps used
in topography, as in Fig. 7.8. On pictures representing a piece of land level curves
join points on the Earth’s surface at the same height above sea level: such paths
do not go uphill nor downhill, and in fact they are called isoclines (lit. ‘of equal
inclination’).
Another frequent instance is the representation of the temperature of a certain
region at a given time. The level curves are called isotherms and connect points
with the same temperature. Similarly for isobars, the level curves on a map joining
points having identical atmospheric pressure.

clines

7.2 Level curves and level surfaces
273
7.2.2 Level surfaces
In presence of three independent variables, level sets can be parametrised around
regular points. To be precise, if f is C1 around x0 ∈L(f, c) and ∇f(x0) ̸= 0, the
3-dimensional analogue of Corollary 7.3 (that easily descends from Theorem 7.4)
guarantees the existence of a neighbourhood B(x0) of x0 and of a regular, simple
surface σ : R →B(x0) such that
L(f, c) ∩B(x0) = {x ∈R3 : x = σ(u, v), with (u, v) ∈R} ,
hence
f

σ(u, v)

= c
∀(u, v) ∈R .
(7.10)
In other terms L(f, c) is locally the image of a level surface of f, and Proposition 7.9
has an analogue
Proposition 7.12 At any regular point, the gradient of a function is parallel
to the normal of the level surface.
Proof.
The partial derivatives of f ◦σ at (u0, v0) ∈R such that σ(u0, v0) = x0
are
∇f(x0) · ∂σ
∂u (u0, v0) = 0 ,
∇f(x0) · ∂σ
∂v (u0, v0) = 0 .
The claim follows now from (6.48)
2
Examples 7.13
i) The level surfaces of f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2 form a family of concentric
spheres with radii √c. The normal vectors are aligned with the gradient of f,
see Fig. 7.9.
ii) Let us explain how the Implicit Function Theorem, and its corollaries, may
be used for studying a surface deﬁned by an algebraic equation. Let Σ ⊂R3 be
the set of points satisfying
f(x, y, z) = 2x4 + 2y4 + 2z4 + x −y −6 = 0 .
The gradient ∇f(x, y, z) = (8x3+1, 8y3−1, 8z3) vanishes only at P0 = (−1
2, 1
2, 0),
but the latter does not satisfy the equation, i.e., P0 /∈Σ. Therefore all points
P of Σ are regular, and Σ is a regular simple surface; around any point P the
surface can be represented as the graph of a function expressing one variable in
terms of the other two.
Notice also
lim
x→∞f(x) = +∞,
so the open set
Ω = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : f(x, y, z) < 0} ,

containing the origin and of which Σ is the boundary, is bounded; consequently
Σ is a compact set. One could prove Σ has no boundary, making it a closed
surface.
Proposition 7.9 proves, for example, that the normal vector (up to sign) to Σ at
P1 = (1, 1, 1) is proportional to ∇f(1, 1, 1) = (9, 7, 8). The unit normal ν at P1,
chosen to point away from the origin (ν · x > 0), is then
ν =

7.3 Constrained extrema
With Sect. 5.6 we have learnt how to ﬁnd extremum points lying inside the do-
main of a suﬃciently regular function. That does not exhaust all possible extrema
though, because there might be some lying on the domain’s boundary (without
mentioning some extrema could be non-regular points). At the same time in many
applications it is required we search for minimum and maximum points on a partic-
ular subset of the domain; for instance, if the subset is deﬁned through equations or
inequalities of the independent variable, one speaks about constrained extrema.
The present section develops two methods to ﬁnd extrema of the kind just
described, and for this we start with an example.
Suppose we want to ﬁnd the minimum of the linear map f(x) = a · x, a =
(1,
√
3) ∈R2, among the unit vectors x of the plane, hence under the constraint

7.3 Constrained extrema
275
∥x∥= 1. Geometrically, the point P = x = (x, y) can only move on the unit
circle x2 + y2 = 1. If g(x) = x2 + y2 −1 = 0 is the equation of the circle and
G = {x ∈R2 : g(x) = 0} the set of constrained points, we are looking for x0
satisfying
x0 ∈G
and
f(x0) = min
x∈G f(x) .
The problem can be tackled in two diﬀerent ways, one privileging the analytical
point of view, the other the geometrical aspects. The ﬁrst consists in reducing the
number of variables from two to one, by observing that the constraint is a simple
closed arc and as such can be written parametrically. Precisely, set γ : [0, 2π] →R2,
γ(t) = (cos t, sin t), so that G coincides with the trace of γ. Then f restricted to
G becomes f ◦γ, a function of the variable t; moreover,
min
x∈G f(x) =
min
t∈[0,2π] f

γ(t)

.
Now we ﬁnd the extrema of ϕ(t) = f

γ(t)

= cos t +
√
3 sin t; the map is periodic
of period 2π, so we can think of it as a map on R and ignore extrema that fall
outside [0, 2π]. The ﬁrst derivative ϕ′(t) = −sin t +
√
3 cos t vanishes at t = π
3 and
4
3π. As ϕ′′( π
3 ) = −2 < 0 and ϕ′′( 4
3π) = 2 > 0, we have a maximum at t = π
3
and a minimum at t = 4
3π. Therefore there is only one solution to the original
constrained problem, namely x0 =

 1
2,

.
The same problem can be understood from a geometrical perspective relying
on Fig. 7.10. The gradient of f is ∇f(x) = a, and we recall f is increasing along

a (with the greatest rate, actually, see Proposition 5.10); the level curves of f are
the perpendicular lines to a. Obviously, f restricted to the unit circle will reach
its minimum and maximum at the points where the level curves touch the circle
itself. These points are, respectively, x0 = −
 1

, which we already know of,
and its antipodal point x1 =

. They may also be characterised as follows.
The gradient is orthogonal to level curves, and the circle is indeed a level curve for
g(x); to say therefore that the level curves of f and g are tangent at xi, i = 0, 1
tantamounts to requiring that the gradients are parallel; otherwise said at each
point xi there is a constant λ such that
∇f(x) = λ∇g(x) .
These, together with the constraining equation g(x) = 0, allow to ﬁnd the con-
strained extrema of f. In fact, we have
⎧
⎨
⎩
λx = 1
λy =

and the solutions are x0 and x1. Since f(x0) < f(x1), x0 will be the minimum
point and x1 the maximum point for f.
In the general case, let f : dom f ⊆Rn →R be a map in n real variables, and
G ∈dom f a proper subset of the domain of f, called in the sequel admissible
set. First of all we introduce the notion of constrained extremum.
Deﬁnition 7.14 A point x0 ∈G is said a relative extremum point of f
constrained to G if x0 is a relative extremum for the restriction f|G of f
to G. In other words, there exists a neighbourhood Br(x0) such that
∀x ∈Br(x0) ∩G
f(x) ≤f(x0)
for a constrained maximum, or
∀x ∈Br(x0) ∩G
f(x) ≥f(x0)
in case of a constrained minimum.

7.3 Constrained extrema
277
Constrained absolute maxima and minima are respectively deﬁned by
f(x0) = max
x∈G f(x)
and
f(x0) = min
x∈G f(x) .
A constrained extremum f is not necessarily an extremum as well. The function
f(x, y) = xy, for example, has a saddle at the origin, but when we restrict to the
bisectrix of the ﬁrst and third quadrant (or second and fourth), the origin becomes
a constrained absolute minimum (maximum).
A recurring situation is that in which the set G is a subset deﬁned by equations
or inequalities, called constraints. We begin by examining one constraint and one
equation, and consider a map g : dom g ⊆Rn →R, with G ⊂dom g, such that
G = {x ∈dom g : g(x) = 0} ;
in other terms G is the zero set of g, or the level set L(g, 0). We discuss both
approaches mentioned in the foreword for this admissible set.
Assume henceforth f and g are C1 on an open set containing G. The aim is to
ﬁnd the constrained extrema of f by looking at the stationary points of suitable
maps.
7.3.1 The method of parameters
This method originates from the possibility of writing the admissible set G in
parametric form, i.e., as image of a map deﬁned on a subset of Rn−1. To be
precise, suppose we know a C1 map ψ : A ⊆Rn−1 →Rn such that
G = {x ∈Rn : x = ψ(u) with u ∈A} .
In dimensions 2 and 3, this forces G to be the trace of a curve ψ = γ : I →R2 or
a surface ψ = σ : R →R3. The function ψ can be typically recovered from the
equation g(x) = 0; the Implicit Function Theorem 7.5 guarantees this is possible
provided G consists of regular points for g. Studying f restricted to G is equivalent
to studying the composite f ◦ψ, so we will detect the latter’s extrema on A, which
has one dimension less than the domain of f. In particular, when n = 2 we will
consider the map t →f

γ(t)

of one variable, when n = 3 we will have the
two-variable map (u, v) →f

σ(u, v)

.
Let us then examine the interior points of A ﬁrst, because if one such, say u0,
is an extremum for f ◦ψ, then it is stationary; putting x0 = ψ(u0), we necessarily
have
∇u(f ◦ψ)(u0) = ∇f

ψ(u0)

Jψ(u0) = 0 .
Stationary points solving the above equation have to be examined carefully to tell
whether they are extrema or not. After that, we inspect the boundary ∂A to ﬁnd
other possible extrema.

Consider f(x, y) = x2 + y −1 and let G be the perimeter of the triangle with
vertices O = (0, 0), A = (1, 0), B = (0, 1), see Fig. 7.11. We want to ﬁnd the
minima and maxima of f on G, which exist by compactness. Parametrise the
three sides OA, OB, AB by γ1(t) = (t, 0), γ2(t) = (0, t), γ3(t) = (t, 1 −t),
where 0 ≤t ≤1 for all three. The map f|OA(t) = t2 −1 has minimum at O
and maximum at A; f|OB(t) = t −1 has minimum at O and maximum at B,
and f|AB(t) = t2 −t has minimum at C =
 1

and maximum at A and B.
Since f(O) = −1, f(A) = f(B) = 0 and f(C) = −1
4, the function reaches its
minimum value at O and its maximum at A and B.

7.3.2 Lagrange multipliers
The idea behind Lagrange multipliers is a particular feature of any regular con-
strained extremum point, shown in Fig. 7.12.
Proposition 7.16 Let x0 ∈G be a regular point for g. If x0 is an extremum
for f constrained to G, there exists a unique constant λ0 ∈R, called Lag-
range multiplier, such that
∇f(x0) = λ0∇g(x0) .
(7.11)
Proof.
For simplicity we assume n = 2 or 3. In the former case what we have seen
in Sect. 7.2.1 applies to g, since x0 ∈G = L(g, 0). Thus a regular simple
curve γ : I →R2 exists, with x0 = γ(t0) for some t0 interior to I, such
that g(x) = g

γ(t)

= 0 on a neighbourhood of x0; additionally,
∇g(x0) · γ′(t0) = 0 .

γ(t)

|t=t0 = ∇f(x0) · γ′(t0) = 0 .
As ∇f(x0) and ∇g(x0) are both orthogonal to the same vector γ′(t0) ̸= 0
(γ being regular), they are parallel, i.e., (7.11) holds. The uniqueness of
λ0 follows from ∇g(x0) ̸= 0.
The proof in three dimensions is completely similar, because on the one
hand g

σ(u, v)

= 0 around x0 for a suitable regular and simple surface
σ : A →R3 (Sect. 7.2.2); on the other the map f

σ(u, v)

has a relative
extremum at (u0, v0), interior to A and such that σ(u0, v0) = x0. At the
same time then
∇g(x0)Jσ(u0, v0) = 0 ,
and
∇f(x0)Jσ(u0, v0) = 0 .
As σ is regular, the column vectors of Jσ(u0, v0) are linearly independent
and span the tangent plane to σ at x0. The vectors ∇f(x0) and ∇g(x0)
are both perpendicular to the plane, and so parallel.

This is the right place to stress that (7.11) can be fulﬁlled, with g(x) = 0,
also by a point x0 which is not a constrained extremum. That is because the
two conditions are necessary yet not suﬃcient for the existence of a constrained
extremum. For example, f(x, y) = x −y5 and g(x, y) = x −y3 satisfy g(0, 0) = 0,
∇f(0, 0) = ∇g(0, 0) = (1, 0); nevertheless, f restricted to G = {(x, y) ∈R2 :
x = y3} has neither a minimum nor a maximum at the origin, for it is given by
y →f(y3, y) = y3 −y5 (y0 = 0 is a horizontal inﬂection point).
There is an equivalent formulation for the previous proposition, that associates
to x0 an unconstrained stationary point relative to a new function depending on
f and g.

7 Applying diﬀerential calculus
Deﬁnition 7.17 Set Ω = dom f ∩dom g ⊆Rn. The function L : Ω ×R →R
deﬁned by
L(x, λ) = f(x) −λg(x)
is said Lagrangian (function) of f constrained to g.
The gradient of L looks as follows
∇(x,λ)L(x, λ) =

∇xL(x, λ), ∂L
∂λ (x, λ)

=

∇f(x) −λ∇g(x), g(x)

.
Hence the condition ∇(x,λ)L(x0, λ0) = 0, expressing that (x0, λ0) is stationary for
L, is equivalent to the system
 ∇f(x0) = λ0∇g(x0) ,
g(x0) = 0 .
Proposition 7.16 ensures that each regular extremum point of f constrained by g
determines a unique stationary point for the Lagrangian L.
Under this new light, the procedure breaks into the following steps.
i)
Write the system of n + 1 equations in n + 1 unknowns x = (x1, . . . , xn)
and λ
 ∇f(x) = λ∇g(x)
g(x) = 0
(7.12)
and solve it; as the system is not, in general, linear, there may be a number
of distinct solutions.
ii) For each solution (x0, λ0) found, decide whether x0 is a constrained ex-
tremum for f, often with ad hoc arguments.
In general, after (7.12) has been solved, the multiplier λ0 stops being useful.
If G is compact for instance, Weierstrass’ Theorem 5.24 guarantees the
existence of an absolute minimum and maximum of f|G (distinct if f is not
constant on G); therefore, assuming G only consists of regular points for
g, these two must be among the ones found previously; comparing values
will permit us to pin down minima and maxima.
iii) In presence of non-regular points (stationary) for g in G (or points where
f and/or g are not diﬀerentiable) we are forced to proceed case by case,
lacking a general procedure.

Example 7.18
Let us ﬁnd the points of R3 lying on the manifold deﬁned by x4 + y4 + z4 = 1
with smallest and largest distance from the origin (see Fig. 7.13).
The problem consists in extremising the function f(x, y, z) = ∥x∥2 = x2+y2+z2
on the set G deﬁned by g(x, y, z) = x4 + y4 + z4 −1 = 0. We consider the square
distance, rather than the distance ∥x∥=

x2 + y2 + z2, because the two have
the same extrema, but the former has the advantage of simplifying computations.
We use Lagrange multipliers, and consider the system (7.12):

2x = λ4x3
2y = λ4y3
2z = λ4z3
x4 + y4 + z4 −1 = 0 .
As f is invariant under sign change in its arguments, f(±x, ±y, ±z) = f(x, y, z),
and similarly for g, we can just look for solutions belonging in the ﬁrst octant
(x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0). The ﬁrst three equations are solved by

In conclusion, the ﬁrst octant contains 3 points of G, x1, x2, x3, with the shortest
distance to the origin, and 1 farthest point x7. The distance function on G has
stationary points x4, x5, x6, but no minimum nor maximum.

Now we pass to brieﬂy consider the case of an admissible set G deﬁned by
m < n equalities, of the type gi(x) = 0, 1 ≤i ≤m. If x0 ∈G is a constrained
extremum for f on G and regular for each gi, the analogue to Proposition 7.16
tells us there exist m constants λ0i, 1 ≤i ≤m (the Lagrange multipliers), such
that
∇f(x0) =
m

i=1
λ0i∇gi(x0) .
Equivalently, set λ = (λi)i=1,...,m) ∈Rm and g(x) =

g1(x)

i=1,...,m: then the
Lagrangian
L(x, λ) = f(x) −λ · g(x)
(7.13)
admits a stationary point (x0, λ0). To ﬁnd such points we have to write the system
of n + m equations in the n + m unknowns given by the components of x and λ,
⎧

⎨
⎪
⎩
∇f(x) =

which generalises (7.12).
Example 7.19
We want to ﬁnd the extrema of f(x, y, z) = 3x + 3y + 8z constrained to the
intersection of two cylinders, x2 + z2 = 1 and y2 + z2 = 1. Deﬁne
g1(x, y, z) = x2 + z2 −1
and
g2(x, y, z) = y2 + z2 −1
so that the admissible set is G = G1 ∩G2, Gi = L(gi, 0). Each point of Gi is
regular for gi, so the same is true for G. Moreover G is compact, so f certainly
has minimum and maximum on it.
As ∇f = (3, 3, 8), ∇g1 = (2x, 0, 2z), ∇g2 = (0, 2y, 2z), system (7.13) reads

λ1 + λ2 ̸= 0), so that the remaining two give

2 .
Then, setting x0 =
 3

and x1 = −x0, we have f(x0) > 0 and f(x1) < 0.
We conclude that x0 is an absolute constrained maximum point, while x1 is an
absolute constrained minimum.
2
Finally, let us assess the case in which the set G is deﬁned by m inequalities;
without loss of generality we may assume the constraints are of type gi(x) ≥0,
i = 1, . . . , m. So ﬁrst we examine interior points of G, with the techniques of
Sect. 5.6. Secondly, we look at the boundary ∂G of G, indeed at points where at
least one inequality is actually an equality. This generates a constrained extremum
problem on ∂G, which we know how to handle.
Due to the profusion of situations, we just describe a few possibilities using
examples.
Examples 7.20
i) Let us return to Example 7.15, and suppose we want to ﬁnd the extrema of f
on the whole triangle G of vertices O, A, B.
Set g1(x, y) = x, g2(x, y) = y, g3(x, y) = 1 −x −y, so that G = {(x, y) ∈
R2 : gi(x, y) ≥0, i = 1, 2, 3}. There are no extrema on the interior of G, since
∇f(x) = (2x, 1) ̸= 0 precludes the existence of stationary points. The extrema
of f on G, which have to be present by the compactness of G, must then belong
to the boundary, and are those we already know of from Example 7.15.
ii) We look for the extrema of f of Example 7.18 that belong to G deﬁned by
x4 + y4 + z4 ≤1. As ∇f(x) = 2x, the only extremum interior to G is the origin,
where f reaches the absolute minimum. But G is compact, so there must also be
an absolute maximum somewhere on the boundary ∂G. The extrema constrained
to the latter are exactly those of the example, so we conclude that f is maximised
on G by x7 =
 1
4√
3,
1
4√
3,

, and at the other seven points obtained from this
by ﬂipping any sign.
iii) We determine the extrema of f(x, y) = (x + y)e−(x2+y2) subject to g(x, y) =
2x + y ≥0. Note immediately that f(x, y) →0 as ∥x∥→∞, so f must admit
absolute maximum and minimum on G. The interior points where the constraint
holds form the (open) half-space y > −2x. Since
∇f(x) = e−(x2+y2)
1 −2x(x + y), 1 −2y(x + y)

,
f has stationary points x = ±
 1

. The Hessian matrix tells us that
x0 is a relative maximum for f. On the boundary ∂G, where y = −2x, the
composite map

, we can without doubt say x1 is the
unique absolute minimum on G. For the absolute maxima, we need to compare
the values attained at x0 and x2. But since f(x0) = e−1/2 and f(x2) =
1
√
10e−1/2,
x0 is the only absolute maximum point on G (Fig. 7.14).

The set G is the (irregular) pentagon of Fig. 7.15, having vertices A = (0, −4),
B = (−2, −3), C = (−3, 2), D = (1, 3), E = (2, 1) and obtained as intersection
of the ﬁve half-planes deﬁned by the above inequalities. As ∇f(x) = (1, 2) ̸= 0,
the function f attains minimum and maximum on the boundary of G; and since
f is linear on the perimeter, any extremum point must be a vertex. Thus it is
enough to compare the values at the corners
f(A) = f(B) = −8 ,
f(C) = 1 ,
f(D) = 7 ,
f(E) = 4 ;
f restricted to G is smallest at each point of AB and largest at D. This simple
example is the typical problem dealt with by Linear Programming, a series of
methods to ﬁnd extrema of linear maps subject to constraints given by linear
inequalities. Linear Programming is relevant in many branches of Mathemat-
ics, like Optimization and Operations Research. The reader should refer to the
speciﬁc literature for further information on the matter.

7.4.1 Solutions
1. Set f(x, y) = x3y + xy4 −2; then

for any x ̸= 0 with x2 ̸= −4y3.
For instance, the point (x0, y0) = (1, 1) solves the equation, thus there is a map
y = ϕ(x) deﬁned around x0 = 1 because fy(1, 1) = 5 ̸= 0. Moreover, ϕ′(1) = −4/5.
2. Setting f(x, y, z) = x2 + y3z −xz
y , we have
fx(x, y, z) = 2x −z
y
with fx(2, 1, 4) = 0 ,
fy(x, y, z) = 3y2z + xz
y2
with fy(2, 1, 4) = 20 ̸= 0 ,
fz(x, y, z) = y3 −x
y
with fz(2, 1, 4) = −1 ̸= 0 .
Due to Theorem 7.4 we can solve for y, hence express y as a function of x and z,
around (2, 4); otherwise said, there exists y = ϕ(x, z) such that
∂ϕ
∂x (2, 4) = 0 ,
∂ϕ
∂z (2, 4) = 1
20 .

3. Call f(x, y) = ex−y + x2 −y2 −e(x + 1) + 1 and notice (0, −1) is a solution.
Then
fx(x, y) = ex−y + 2x −e ,
fy(x, y) = −ex−y −2y
with fx(0, −1) = 0, fy(0, −1) = 2 −e ̸= 0. Theorem 7.1 guarantees the existence
of a map y = ϕ(x), deﬁned around the origin, such that
ϕ′(0) = −fx(0, −1)
fy(0, −1) = 0 .
Hence x0 = 0 is a critical point of ϕ.
4. If we set
f(x, y, z) = x2 + 2x + ey + y −2z3
then f(−1, 0, 0) = 0. We have
fx(x, y, z) = 2x + 2
with fx(−1, 0, 0) = 0 ,
fy(x, y, z) = ey + 1
with fy(−1, 0, 0) = 2 ̸= 0 ,
fz(x, y, z) = −6z2
with fz(−1, 0, 0) = 0 .
By Theorem 7.4 there is a map y = ϕ(x, z) around (−1, 0) satisfying
∂ϕ
∂x (−1, 0) = ∂ϕ
∂z (−1, 0) = 0 .
The tangent plane is therefore
y = ϕ(−1, 0) + ϕx(−1, 0)(x + 1) + ϕz(−1, 0)(z −0) = 0 .
5. a) The gradient of f(x, y, z) = x log(y + z) + 3(y −2)z + sin x is
∇f(x, y, z) =

log(y + z) + cos x,
x
y + z + 3z,
x
y + z + 3(y −2)

,
so ∇f(P0) = (1, −3, 0) ̸= 0. By Theorem 7.4 then, we can express x via y and
z, or y in terms of x, z. Therefore, around P0 the surface Σ is locally a regular
simple graph.
b) The tangent plane at P0 = x0 is, recalling Proposition 7.9,
∇f(x0) · (x −x0) = x −3(y −2) = 0 ,
so x −3y = −6. The unit normal at P0 will be ν =

10 > 0, whence σ = −1.

7. The map f(x, y) = y7 + 3y −2xe3x has derivatives
fx(x, y) = −2e3x(1 + 3x) ,
fy(x, y) = 7y6 + 3 > 0 .
Theorem 7.1 says we can have y as a function of x around every point of R2, so
let y = ϕ(x) be such a map. Then
ϕ′(x) = −fx(x, y)
fy(x, y) = 2e3x(1 + 3x)
7y6 + 3
,
and ϕ′(x) = 0 for x = −1/3, ϕ′(x) > 0 for x > −1/3. Observe that f(0, 0) = 0, so
ϕ(0) = 0. The function passes through the origin, is increasing when x > −1/3,
decreasing when x < −1/3. The point x = −1/3 is an (absolute) minimum for ϕ,
with ϕ(−1/3) < 0.

Moreover, ϕ′(t) > 0 for t ∈

at both P3 and P4, while the minimum value 1/2 is attained at P2.
An alternative way to solve the exercise is to use Lagrange multipliers. If we
set g(x, y) = 4x2 + y2 −1, the Lagrangian is
L(x, y,λ ) = f(x, y) −λg(x, y) .
Since ∇f(x, y) = (2x + 3
2, 2y), ∇g(x, y) = (8x, 2y), we have to solve the system

2y = 2λy
4x2 + y2 = 1 .

y = ±

(the points P3, P4); taking y = 0 gives x = ± 1

P2). Computing f at these points clearly gives the same result of the parameters’
method.

12. Since ∇f(x, y) = (1, 3) ̸= (0, 0) for all (x, y), there are no critical points on
the interior of G. We look for extrema on the boundary, which must exist by
Weierstrass’ Theorem. Now, ∂G decomposes in three pieces: two segments, on the
x- and the y-axis, that join the origin to the points A = (1, 0) and B = (0, 1),
and the arc of unit circle connecting A to B. Restricted to the segment OA,
the function is f(x, 0) = x + 2, x ∈[0, 1], so x = 0 is a (local) minimum with
f(0, 0) = 2, and x = 1 is a (local) maximum with f(1, 0) = 3. Similarly, on OB
the map is f(0, y) = 3y + 2, y ∈[0, 1], so y = 0 is a (local) minimum, f(0, 0) = 2,
and y = 1 a (local) maximum with f(0, 1) = 5. At last, parametrising the arc by
γ(t) = (cos t, sin t), t ∈[0, π /2] gives
ϕ(t) = f ◦γ(t) = cos t + 3 sin t + 2 .
Since ϕ′(t) = −sin t + 3 cost is zero at t0 = arctan3, and ϕ′(t) > 0 for t ∈[0, t0],
the function f has a (local) maximum at γ(t0) = (x0, y0). To compute x0, y0
explicitly, observe that
 sin t0 = 3 cost0
sin2 t0 + cos2 t0 = 1 ,
whence 9 cos2 t0 + cos2 t0 = 9x2
0 + x2
0 = 10x2
0 = 1, x0 = 1/
√
10, and so y0 = 3/
√
10
(remember x, y ≥0 on G). Furthermore, f(x0, y0) = 2 +
√
10. Overall, the origin
is the absolute minimum and (x0, y0) the absolute maximum for f.
13. a) Given that ∇f(x, y) =

so P1, P2 are both saddle points.
b) By part a), there are no extrema on the interior of G. But since G is compact,
Weierstrass’ Theorem ensures there are extremum points, and they belong to ∂G.
The boundary of G is the union of the horizontal segment between A = (−

Integral calculus in several variables
The deﬁnite integral of a function of one real variable allowed us, in Vol. I, to
deﬁne and calculate the area of a suﬃciently regular region in the plane. The
present chapter extends this notion to multivariable maps by discussing multiple
integrals; in particular, we introduce double integrals for dimension 2 and triple
integrals for dimension 3. These new tools rely on the notions of a measurable
subset of Rn and the corresponding n-dimensional measure; the latter extends the
idea of the area of a plane region (n = 2), and the volume of a solid (n = 3) to
more general situations.
We continue by introducing methods for computing multiple integrals. Among
them, dimensional-reduction techniques transform multiple integrals into one-
dimensional integrals, which can be tackled using the rules the reader is already
familiar with. On the other hand a variable change in the integration domain can
produce an expression, as for integrals by substitution, that is computable with
more ease than the multiple integral.
In the sequel we shall explain the part played by multiple integrals in the correct
formulation of physical quantities, like mass, centre of gravity, and moments of
inertia of a body with given density.
The material cannot hope to exhaust multivariable integral calculus. Integrat-
ing a map that depends on n variables over a lower-dimensional manifold gives rise
to other kinds of integrals, with great applicative importance, such as curvilinear
integrals, or ﬂux integrals through a surface. These in particular will be carefully
dealt with in the subsequent chapter, where we will also show how to recover a
map from its gradient, i.e., ﬁnd a primitive of sorts, essentially.
The technical nature of many proofs, that are often adaptations of one-
dimensional arguments, has induced us to skip them1. The wealth of examples
we present will in any case illustrate the statements thoroughly.

8.1 Double integral over rectangles
Consider a real function f : B →R, deﬁned on a closed rectangle B = [a, b] ×
[c, d] ⊂R2 and bounded over it. We call cylindroid of f the three-dimensional
region C(f; B) between B and the graph of f
C(f; B) = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : (x, y) ∈B, 0 ≤z ≤f(x, y) or f(x, y) ≤z ≤0} ,
see Fig. 8.1. (The choice of bounds for z depends on the sign of f(x, y).) If f
satisﬁes certain requirements, we may associate to the cylindroid of f a number
called the double integral of f over B. In case f is positive, this number represents
the region’s volume. In particular, when the cylindroid is a simple solid (e.g., a
parallelepiped, a prism, and so on) it gives the usual expression for the volume.
Many are the ways to construct the double integral of a function; we will explain
the method due to Riemann, which generalises what we saw in Vol. I, Sects. 9.4
and 9.5, for dimension 1.
Let us thus consider arbitrary partitions of [a, b] and [c, d] associated to the
ordered points {x0, x1, . . . , xp} and {y0, y1, . . . , yq}
a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xp−1 < xp = b ,

Figure 8.2. Subdivision of the rectangle B
The rectangle B is made of p · q products Bhk = Ih × Jk; we have thus built a
partition or subdivision of B, say D = {Bhk : h = 1, . . . p, k = 1, . . . , q}, which is
the product of the partitions of [a, b] and [c, d] (Fig. 8.2). Set
mhk =

The geometrical meaning is clear when f is positive on B. Given a partition D
of B, the cylindroid of f is contained inside the solid formed by the union of the
parallelepipeds with base Bhk and height Mhk, and it contains the solid made by
the parallelepipeds with the same base and mhk as height (see Fig. 8.3).
The upper integral is an over-estimate of the region, while the lower integral an
under-estimate. Thus f is integrable when these two concide, i.e., when the region
deﬁnes a number representing its volume.

f(x, y) =

This shows f is not integrable on B.

Remark 8.3 Let us examine, in detail, similarities and diﬀerences with the deﬁn-
ition, as of Vol. I, of a Riemann integrable map on an interval [a, b]. We may sub-
divide the rectangle B = [a, b] × [c, d] without having to use Cartesian products
of partitions of [a, b] and [c, d]. For instance, we could subdivide B = ∪N
i=1Bi by
taking coordinate rectangles Bi as in Fig. 8.4. Clearly, the kind of partitions we
consider are a special case of these.
Furthermore, if we are given a generic two-dimensional step function ϕ associ-
ated to such a rectangular partition, it is possible to deﬁne its double integral in
an elementary way, namely: let
ϕ(x, y) = ci ,
∀(x, y) ∈Bi ,
i = 1, . . . , N ;
then

Notice the lower and upper sums of a bounded map f : B →R, deﬁned in (8.1),
are precisely the integrals of two step functions, one smaller and one larger than f.
Their constant values on each sub-rectangle coincide respectively with the greatest
lower bound and least upper bound of f on the sub-rectangle. We could have
considered the set S−
f (resp. S+
f ) of step functions that are smaller (larger) than
f. The lower and upper integrals thus obtained,

As for one-variable maps, it is imperative to ﬁnd classes of integrable functions
and be able to compute their integrals directly, without turning to the deﬁnition.
A partial answer to the ﬁrst problem is provided by the following theorem. Further
classes of integrable functions will be considered in subsequent sections.
Theorem 8.4 If f is continuous on the rectangle B, then it is integrable
on B.
Our next result allows us to reduce a double integral, under suitable assump-
tions, to the computation of two integrals over real intervals.
Theorem 8.5 Let f be integrable over B = [a, b] × [c, d].
a) If, for any y ∈[c, d], the integral g(y) =

Formulas (8.3) and (8.4) are said, generically, reduction formulas for iterated in-
tegrals. When they hold simultaneously, as happens for continuous maps, we say
that the order of integration can be swapped in the double integral.
Examples 8.6
i) A special case occurs when f has the form f(x, y) = h(x)g(y), with h integrable

This means the double integral coincides with the product of the two one-

ii) Let us determine the double integral of f(x, y) = cos(x + y) over B = [0, π

[0, π

h(x0) =

c f(x0, y) dy represents the area of the region obtained as intersection
between the cylindroid of f and the plane x = x0. The region’s volume is the
integral from a to b of such area (Fig. 8.5).

8.2 Double integrals over measurable sets
For one-dimensional integrals the region over which to integrate is always an in-
terval, or a ﬁnite union of intervals. Since double-integrating only over rectangles
(or ﬁnite unions thereof) is too restrictive, we need to introduce the kind of sets
over which we will discuss integrability. To this end, let Ω be an arbitrary bounded
subset of R2, and denote by χΩ : R2 →R its characteristic function
χΩ(x) =
 1
if x ∈Ω ,
0
if x /∈Ω
(see Fig. 8.6).
We ﬁx an arbitrary rectangle B containing Ω, and ask ourselves whether χΩ
is integrable on B. It is easy to check that if yes, and if B′ is any other rectangle
containing Ω, the function χΩ is still integrable on B′. Moreover the two integrals
3
B χΩ and
3
B′ χΩ coincide, so the common value can be denoted by
3
Ω χΩ. That
said, let us introduce the notion of a measurable set `a la Peano-Jordan.
Deﬁnition 8.8 A bounded subset Ω ⊂R2 is measurable if, for an arbitrary
rectangle B containing Ω, the function χΩ is integrable on B. If so, the non-
negative number
|Ω| =

Ω
χΩ
is the measure (or area) of Ω.

Figure 8.6. The characteristic function of a set Ω
Examples of measurable sets include polygons and discs, and the above notion
is precisely what we already know as their surface area. At times we shall write
area(Ω) instead of |Ω|. In particular, for any rectangle B = [a, b] × [c, d] we see
immediately that
|B| = area(B) =


dx dy = (b −a)(d −c).
Not all bounded sets in the plane are measurable. Think of the points in the square
[0, 1]×[0, 1] with rational coordinates. The characteristic function of this set is the
Dirichlet function relative to Example 8.2 ii), which is not integrable. Therefore
the set is not measurable.
Another deﬁnition will turn out useful in the sequel.
Deﬁnition 8.9 A set Ω has zero measure if it is measurable and |Ω| = 0.
With this we can characterise measurable sets in the plane. In fact, the next
result is often used the tell whether a given set is measurable or not.
Theorem 8.10 A bounded set Ω ⊂R2 is measurable if and only if its bound-
ary ∂Ω has measure zero.
Among zero-measure sets are:
i)
subsets of sets with zero measure;
ii) ﬁnite unions of sets with zero measure;
iii) sets consisting of ﬁnitely many points;

306
8 Integral calculus in several variables
iv) segments;
v) graphs Γ = {

x, f(x)

} or Γ = {

f(y), y

} of integrable maps f : [a, b] →R;
vi) traces of (piecewise-)regular plane curves.
As for the last, we should not confuse the measure of the trace of a plane curve
with its length, which is in essence a one-dimensional measure for sets that are
not contained in a line.
A case of zero-measure set of particular relevance is the graph of a continuous
map deﬁned on a closed and bounded interval. Therefore, measurable sets include
bounded sets whose boundary is a ﬁnite union of such graphs, or more gener-
ally, a ﬁnite union of regular Jordan arcs. At last, bounded and convex sets are
measurable.
Measurable sets and their measures enjoy some properties.
Property 8.11 If Ω1 and Ω2 are measurable,
i) Ω1 ⊆Ω2 implies |Ω1| ≤|Ω2|;
ii) Ω1 ∪Ω2 and Ω1 ∩Ω2 are measurable with
|Ω1 ∪Ω2| = |Ω1| + |Ω2| −|Ω1 ∩Ω2| ,
hence
|Ω1 ∪Ω2| ≤|Ω1| + |Ω2| .
Here is a simple, yet useful result for the sequel.
Property 8.12 If Ω is a measurable set, so are the interior
◦
Ω, the closure Ω,
and in general all sets ˜Ω such that
◦
Ω ⊆˜Ω ⊆Ω. Any of these has measure |Ω|.
Proof.
All sets ˜Ω have the same boundary ∂˜Ω = ∂Ω. Therefore Theorem 8.10
tells they are measurable. But they diﬀer from one another by subsets of
∂Ω, whose measure is zero.
2
Now we introduce the notion of integrability for bounded maps on a given
measurable set Ω. The method is completely similar to the way we selected meas-
urable sets. Let f : Ω →R be a bounded map, and consider ˜f : R2 →R (called
the trivial extension of f to R2), deﬁned by
˜f(x) =
 f(x)
if x ∈Ω,
0
if x /∈Ω
(8.6)
(see Fig. 8.7).

Figure 8.7. Trivial extension of a map to a rectangle B
Deﬁnition 8.13 The map f is (Riemann) integrable on Ω if ˜f is integrable
on any rectangle B containing Ω. In that case, the integral

B
˜f is independent
of the choice of B, and we set

Ω
f =


˜f .
This value is called the double integral of f over Ω. Other symbols to
denote it are




Ω
f dΩ .
Observe that if f coincides with the characteristic function of Ω, what we have
just deﬁned is exactly the measure of Ω.
The ﬁrst large class of integrable maps we wish to describe is a sort of gener-
alisation of piecewise-continuous functions in one variable.
Deﬁnition 8.14 A map f : Ω →R, bounded on a measurable set Ω, is said
generically continuous on Ω if the discontinuity set has zero measure.
A bounded, continuous map on Ω is clearly generically continuous, as no dis-
continuity points are present. An example of a generically continuous, but not
continuous, function is given by the map f(x, y) = sign(x −y) on the square
Ω = (0, 1)2.
Then we have the following result.

308
8 Integral calculus in several variables
Theorem 8.15 Let f be generically continuous on a measurable set Ω. Then
f is integrable on Ω.
There is a way to compute the double integral on special regions in the plane,
which requires a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 8.16 A set Ω ⊂R2 is normal with respect to the y-axis if
it is of the form
Ω = {(x, y) ∈R2 : a ≤x ≤b, g1(x) ≤y ≤g2(x)}
with g1, g2 : [a, b] →R continuous.
Analogously, Ω is normal with respect to the x-axis if
Ω = {(x, y) ∈R2 : c ≤y ≤d, h1(y) ≤y ≤h2(y)}
with h1, h2 : [c, d] →R continuous. We will shorten this by the terms normal
for y and normal for x respectively.
This notion can be understood geometrically. The set Ω is normal with respect to
the y-axis if any vertical line x = x0 either does not meet Ω, or it intersects it in the
segment (possibly reduced to a point) with end points

x0, g1(x0)

,

x0, g2(x0)

.
Similarly, Ω is normal for x if a horizontal line y = y0 has intersection either empty
or the segment between

h1(y0), y0

,

h2(y0), y0

with Ω. Examples are shown in
Fig. 8.8 and Fig. 8.9.
Normal sets for either variable are clearly measurable, because their boundary
is a ﬁnite union of zero-measure sets (graphs of continuous maps and segments).
The next proposition allows us to compute a double integral by iteration, thus
generalising Theorem 8.5 for rectangles.

Proof.
Suppose Ω is normal for x. From the deﬁnition, Ω is a closed and bounded,
hence compact, subset of R2. By Weierstrass’ Theorem 5.24, f is bounded
on Ω. Then Theorem 8.15 implies f is integrable on Ω. As for formula (8.8),
let B = [a, b] × [c, d] be a rectangle containing Ω, and consider the trivial
extension ˜f of f to B. The idea is to use Theorem 8.5 a); for this, we
observe that for any y ∈[c, d], the integral
g(y) =
 b

˜f(x, y) dx
exists because x →˜f(x, y) has not more than two discontinuity points
(see Fig. 8.10). Moreover

Ω

where Ω is the region in the ﬁrst quadrant bounded by the curves y = 2x,
y = 3 −x2, x = 0 (as in Fig. 8.11, left). The ﬁrst line and the parabola meet at
two points with x = −3 and x = 1, the latter of which delimits Ω on the right.
The set Ω is normal for both x and y, but given its shape we prefer to integrate
in y ﬁrst. In fact,
Ω =

For positive functions that are integrable on generic measurable sets Ω, e.g.,
rectangles, the double integral makes geometrical sense, namely it represents the
volume vol(C) of the cylindroid of f
C = C(f; Ω) = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : (x, y) ∈Ω, 0 ≤z ≤f(x, y)} .
See Fig. 8.12.

8.2.1 Properties of double integrals
In this section we state a bunch of useful properties of double integrals.
Theorem 8.20 Let f, g be integrable maps on a measurable set Ω ⊂R2.
i) (Linearity) For any α,β ∈R, the map αf + βg is integrable on Ω and

Ω
αf + βg = α

Ω
f + β

Ω
g .
ii) (Positivity) If f ≥0 on Ω, then

Ω
f ≥0 .
In addition, if f is continuous and Ω measurable with |Ω| > 0, we have
equality above if and only if f is identically zero.
iii) (Comparison/Monotonicity) If f ≤g on Ω, then

Ω
f ≤

Ω
g .
iv) (Boundedness) The map |f| is integrable on Ω and

314
8 Integral calculus in several variables
v) (Mean Value Theorem) If Ω is measurable and
m =
inf
(x,y)∈Ω f(x, y) ,
M =
sup
(x,y)∈Ω
f(x, y) ,
then
m ≤

|Ω|

Ω
f ≤M .
The number

|Ω|

Ω
f
(8.9)
is called (integral) mean value of f on Ω.
vi) (Additivity of domains) Let Ω = Ω1∪Ω2, with Ω1∩Ω2 of zero measure.
If f is integrable on Ω1 and on Ω2, then f is integrable on Ω, and

Ω
f =

Ω1
f +

Ω2
f .
vii) If f = g except that on a zero-measure subset of Ω, then

Ω
f =

Ω
g .
Property vi) is extremely useful when integrals are deﬁned over unions of ﬁnitely
many normal sets for one variable.
There is a counterpart to Property 8.12 for integrable functions.
Property 8.21 Let f be integrable on a measurable set Ω, and suppose it is
deﬁned on the closure Ω of Ω. Then f is integrable over any subset ˜Ω such
that
◦
Ω ⊆˜Ω ⊆Ω, and

˜
Ω
f =

Ω
f .
Otherwise said, the double integral of an integrable map does not depend on
whether bits of the boundary belong to the integration domain.

where Ω = {(x, y) ∈R2 : y > |x|, y < 1

The domain Ω, depicted in Fig. 8.14, is made of the points lying between the
graphs of y = |x| and y = 1
2x+2. The set Ω is normal for both x and y; it is more
convenient to start integrating in y. Due to the presence of y = |x|, moreover, it
is better to compute the integral on Ω as sum of integrals over the subsets Ω1
and Ω2 of the picture. The graphs of y = |x| and y = 1
2x + 2 meet for x = 4 and
x = −4
3. Then Ω1 and Ω2 are, respectively,
Ω1 = {(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 ≤x < 4, x < y < 1

and
Ω2 = {(x, y) ∈R2 : −4

8.3 Changing variables in double integrals
This section deals with the analogue of the substitution method for one-dimensional
integrals. This generalisation represents an important computational tool, besides
furnishing an alternative way to understand the Jacobian determinant of plane
transformations.
Consider a measurable region Ω ⊂R2 and a continuous map f that is bounded
on it. As f is integrable on Ω, we may ask how
3
Ω f varies if we change variables
in the plane.
Precisely, retaining the notation of Sect. 6.6, let Ω′ be a measurable region
and Φ : Ω′ →Ω, (x, y) = Φ(u, v) a variable change, like in Deﬁnition 6.30. We
want to write the integral of f(x, y) over Ω as integral over Ω′ by means of the
composite map ˜f = f ◦Φ, i.e., ˜f(u, v) = f

Φ(u, v)

, deﬁned on Ω′. To do that
though, we ought to recall the integral is deﬁned using the areas of elementary sets,
such as rectangles, into which the domain is divided. It becomes thus relevant to
understand how areas change when passing from Ω′ to Ω via Φ.
So let us start with a rectangle B′ in Ω′, whose sides are parallel to the axes
u and v and whose vertices are u0, u1 = u0 + Δu e1, u2 = u0 + Δv e2 and
u3 = u0 +Δu e1 +Δv e2 (Fig. 8.16, left); here Δu,Δv denote positive, and small,
increments. The area of B′ is |B′| = ΔuΔv, clearly.
Denote by B the image of B′ under Φ (Fig. 8.16, right); it has sides along the
coordinate lines of Φ and vertices given by xi = Φ(ui), i = 0, . . . , 3. In order to
express the area of B in terms of B′ we need to make some approximations, justiﬁed
by the choice of suﬃciently small Δu and Δv. First of all, let us approximate B
with the parallelogram Bp with three vertices at x0, x1, x2. It is known that its
area is the absolute value of the cross product of any two adjacent sides:
|B| ∼|Bp| = ∥(x1 −x0) ∧(x2 −x0)∥.
On the other hand, the Taylor expansion of ﬁrst order at u0 gives, also using (6.25),

x1 −x0 = Φ(u1) −Φ(u0) ∼∂Φ
∂u (u0)Δu = τ1Δu ,
and similarly
x2 −x0 ∼τ2Δv ,
with
τ2 = ∂Φ
∂v (u0) .
Therefore
|B| ∼∥τ1 ∧τ2∥ΔuΔv = ∥τ1 ∧τ2∥|B′| .
Now (6.27) yields
∥τ1 ∧τ2∥= | det JΦ(u0)| ,
so that
|B| ∼| det JΦ(u0)| |B′| .
(8.10)
Up to inﬁnitesimals of order greater than Δu and Δv then, the quantity | det JΦ|
represents the ratio between the areas of two (small) surface elements B′ ⊂Ω′, B ⊂
Ω, which correspond under Φ. This relationship is usually written symbolically as
dx dy = | det JΦ(u, v)| du dv ,
(8.11)
where du dv is the area of the ‘inﬁnitesimal’ surface element in Ω′ and dx dy the
area of the image in Ω.
Examples 8.23
i) Call Φ the aﬃne transformation Φ(u) = Au + b, where A is a non-singular
matrix. Then B is a parallelogram of vertices x0, x1, x2, x3, and concides with
Bp, so all approximations are actually exact. In particular, the position vectors
along the sides at x0 read
x1 −x0 = a1Δu ,
x2 −x0 = a2Δv ,
where a1 and a2 are the column vectors of A. Hence
|B| = ∥a1 ∧a2∥ΔuΔv = | det A|ΔuΔv = | det JΦ| |B′| ,
and (8.10) is an equality.
ii) Consider the transformation Φ : (r,θ ) →(r cos θ, r sin θ) relative to polar
coordinates in the plane. The image under Φ of a rectangle B′ = [r0, r0 + Δr] ×
[θ0, θ0+Δθ] in the rθ-plane is the region of Fig. 8.17. It has height Δr in the radial
direction and base ∼rΔθ along the angle direction; but since polar coordinates
are orthogonal,
|B| ∼rΔrΔθ = r|B′| .
This is the form that (8.10) takes in the case at hand, because indeed r =
det JΦ(r,θ ) > 0 (recall (6.29)).
2
After this detour we are ready to integrate. If D′ = {B′
i}i∈I is a partition of
Ω′ into rectangular elements, D = {Bi = Φ(B′
i)}i∈I will be a partition of Ω in
rectangular-like regions; denote by | det JΦi| the value appearing in (8.10) for the

i as well), then by using (8.10) on each element
we obtain

Now reﬁning the partition of Ω′ further and further, by taking rectangles of
sides Δu, Δv going to 0, one can prove that the sums on the right converge
to

Φ(u, v)

| det JΦ(u, v)| du dv, while those on the left to
3
Ω f(x, y) dx dy,
provided f is continuous and bounded on Ω.
All the above discussion should justify, though heuristically, the following key
result (clearly, everything can be made rigorous).
Theorem 8.24 Let Φ : Ω′ →Ω be a change of variables between measurable
regions Ω′, Ω in R2, as in Deﬁnition 6.30, with components
x = ϕ(u, v)
and
y = ψ(u, v).
If f is a continuous and bounded map on Ω,

Ω
f(x, y) dx dy =

Ω′ f

ϕ(u, v), ψ(u, v)

| det JΦ(u, v)| du dv .
(8.12)
In the applications, it may be more convenient to use the inverse transformation
(u, v) = Ψ(x, y), such that Ω′ = Ψ(Ω) and det JΦ(u, v) =

det JΨ(x, y)
−1.
Let us make this formula explicit by considering two special changes of vari-
ables, namely an aﬃne map and the passage to polar coordinates.
For aﬃne transformations, set x = Φ(u) = Au + b where A =
	 a11
a12
a21

and b =
	 b1
b2

; hence x = ϕ(u, v) = a11u + a12v + b1 and y = ψ(u, v) = a21u +

320
8 Integral calculus in several variables
a22v + b2. If Ω is measurable and Ω′ = Φ−1(Ω), we have

Ω
f(x, y) dx dy = | det A|

Ω′ f(a11u + a12v + b1, a21u + a22v + b2) du dv .
As for polar coordinates, x = ϕ(r,θ ) = r cos θ, y = ψ(r,θ ) = r sin θ, and
det JΦ(r,θ ) = r. Therefore, setting again Ω′ = Φ−1(Ω), we obtain

Ω
f(x, y) dx dy =

Ω′ f(r cos θ, r sin θ) r dr dθ .

8.4 Multiple integrals
Since the deﬁnition of multiple integral – or n-dimensional integral – for a map
of n ≥3 real variables closely resembles the one just seen for 2 variables, we
merely point out the diﬀerences with the previous situations due to the increased
dimension in the case n = 3.
The role of plane rectangles is now taken by parallelepipeds in space. The
generic set B = [a1, b1] × [a2, b2] × [a3, b3] can be broken up into the product of
partitions of the intervals [a1, b1], [a2, b2], [a3, b3], using the points {x0, x1, . . . , xp},
{y0, y1, . . . , yq} and {z0, z1, . . . , zr} respectively. The solid B is thus the union of
parallelepipeds
Bhkℓ= [xh−1, xh] × [yk−1, yk] × [zℓ−1, zℓ].
Take f : B →R bounded; the lower and upper sums of f over B relative to the
above partition D are, by deﬁnition,
s = s(D, f) =

8.4 Multiple integrals

To be able to integrate over bounded sets Ω ⊂R3, it is necessary to deﬁne
what ‘measurable’ means in space. In analogy to Deﬁnition 8.8, we substitute the
rectangle B with a parallelepiped containing Ω, and put
|Ω| =

Ω
χΩ =

B
χΩ .
This is independent of the choice of B. The familiar sets of Euclidean geometry,
like spheres, cylinders, polyhedra and so on, turn out to be all measurable. This
notion of measure is indeed the volume, so we shall sometimes write |Ω| = vol(Ω).
Deﬁnition 8.9, Theorem 8.10 and Property 8.12 hold also in higher dimensions.
For instance, if D ⊂R2 is measurable and g : D →R integrable on D, the graph
has 3-dimensional measure equal zero. In particular, the traces of regular surfaces
have, as subsets of R3, zero measure.
Take f : Ω →R bounded, with Ω measurable. Given an arbitrary paral-
lelepiped B containing Ω, we extend f by setting it to zero on B \ Ω, and call the
extension ˜f. One says f is integrable on Ω if ˜f is integrable on B, in which case

Ω
f =

B
˜f ;
this number, not depending on B, is the (triple) integral of f on Ω, also denoted
by

Ω
f ,

Ω
f(x, y, z) dx dy dz ,

Ω
f dΩ .
Again, Deﬁnition 8.14 and Theorem 8.15 adapt to the present situation, and sim-
ilarly happens for Theorem 8.20.
A completely analogous construction leads to multiple integrals in dimen-
sion n > 3.
We would like to ﬁnd examples of regions in space where integrals are easy
to compute explicitly. These should work as normal sets did in the plane, i.e.,
reducing triple integrals to lower-dimensional ones. We consider in detail normal
regions for the z-axis, the other cases being completely similar.
Deﬁnition 8.27 We call Ω ⊂R3 a normal set for z (normal with respect
to the z-axis, to be precise) if
Ω = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : (x, y) ∈D, g1(x, y) ≤z ≤g2(x, y)} ,
(8.13)
for a closed measurable region D in R2 and continuous maps g1, g2 : D →R.
Fig. 8.20 shows a few normal regions.
The boundary of a normal set has thus zero measure, hence a normal set is
measurable. Triple integrals over normal domains can be reduced to iterated double

see Fig. 8.21, where f is integrated ﬁrst along vertical segments in the domain.
Dimensional reduction is possible for other kinds of measurable sets. Suppose
the measurable set Ω ⊂R3 is such that the z-coordinate of its points varies within
an interval [α,β ] ⊂R. For any z0 in this interval, the plane z = z0 cuts Ω along
the cross-section Ωz0 (Fig. 8.22); so let us denote by
Az0 = {(x, y) ∈R2 : (x, y, z0) ∈Ω}

Now assume every Az is measurable in R2. This is the case, for example, if the
boundary of Ω is a ﬁnite union of graphs, or if Ω is convex.
Taking a continuous and bounded function f : Ω →R guarantees all integrals

where
D = {(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 ≤x ≤1, 0 ≤y ≤1 −x} .

8.4.1 Changing variables in triple integrals
Theorem 8.24, governing variable changes, now reads as follows.
Theorem 8.29 Let Φ : Ω′ →Ω, with Ω′, Ω measurable in R3, be a change
of variables on Ω, and set x = Φ(u). If f is a continuous and bounded map
on Ω, we have


The same formula holds in any dimension n > 3.
Let us see how a triple integral transforms if we use cylindrical or spherical
coordinates.
Let Φ deﬁne cylindrical coordinates in R3, see Sect. 6.6; Fig. 8.26, left, shows
the corresponding volume element. If Ω is a measurable set and Ω′ = Φ−1(Ω),
from formula (6.41) we have

The variables x, y and z can be exchanged according to the need. Example 8.28
ii) indeed used the cylindrical transformation Φ(r, θ, t) = (t, r cos θ, r sin θ).
Consider the transformation Φ deﬁning spherical coordinates in R3; the volume
element is shown in Fig. 8.26, right. If Ω′ and Ω are related by Ω′ = Φ−1(Ω),
equation (6.44) gives

8.5 Applications and generalisations
This last section is devoted to some applications of multiple integrals. We will
consider solids of revolution and show how to compute their volume, and eventually
extend the notion of integral to cover vector-values functions and integrals over
unbounded sets in Rn.
8.5.1 Mass, centre of mass and moments of a solid body
Double and triple integrals are used to determine the mass, the centre of gravity
and the moments of inertia of plane regions or solid ﬁgures. Let us consider, for
a start, a physical body whose width in the z-direction is negligible with respect
to the other dimensions x and y, such as a thin plate. Suppose its mean section,
in the z direction, is given by a region Ω in the plane. Call μ(x, y) the surface’s
density of mass (the mass per unit of area); then the body’s total mass is
m =

Ω
μ(x, y) dx dy .
(8.17)
The centre of mass (also known as centre of gravity, or centroid), of Ω is
the point G = (xG, yG) with coordinates
xG = 1

the coordinates of the centre of mass of Ω are the mean values (see (8.9)) of the
coordinates of its generic point.
The moment (of inertia) of Ω about a given line r (the axis) is
Ir =

Ω
d 2
r (x, y)μ(x, y) dx dy ,
where dr(x, y) denotes the distance of (x, y) from r. In particular, the moments
about the coordinate axes are

Iy =

Ω
d 2
0 (x, y)μ(x, y) dx dy ,
with d0(x, y) denoting the distance between (x, y) and the origin.

8.5.2 Volume of solids of revolution
Let Ω be obtained by rotating around the z-axis the trapezoid T determined by the
function f : [a, b] →R, y = f(z) in the yz-plane (Fig. 8.29). The region T is called
the meridian section of Ω. The volume of Ω equals the integral
3
Ω dx dy dz.
The region Ωz0, intersection of Ω with the plane z = z0, is a circle of radius f(z0).
Integrating over the slices Ωz and recalling the notation of p. 325, then
vol(Ω) =

Using (8.19) then,
yG =

2π area(T )
or
vol(Ω) = 2πyG area(T ) .
(8.20)
This proves the so-called Centroid Theorem of Pappus (variously known also as
Guldin’s Theorem, or Pappus–Guldin Theorem).
Theorem 8.32 The volume of a solid of revolution is the product of the area
of the meridian section times the length of the circle described by the section’s
centre of mass.
This result extends to the solids of revolution whose meridian section T is not
the trapezoid of a function f, but instead a measurable set in the plane. The
examples that follow are exactly of this kind.
Examples 8.33
i) Compute the volume of the solid Ω, obtained revolving the triangle T of
vertices A = (1, 1), B = (2, 1), C = (1, 3) in the plane yz around the z-axis.
Fig. 8.30 shows T , whose area is clearly 1. As the line through B and C is

plane yz. The solid Ω obtained is a torus, see Fig. 8.31. Since area(T ) = πr2
and the centre of mass of a circle coincides with its geometric centre, we have
vol(Ω) = 2π2r2y0 .

8.5.4 Improper multiple integrals
We saw in Vol. I how to deﬁne rigorously integrals of unbounded maps and integrals
over unbounded intervals. As far as multivariable functions are concerned, we shall
only discuss unbounded domains of integrations. For simplicity, let f(x, y) be a
map of two real variables deﬁned on the entire R2, positive and integrable on
every disc BR(0) centred at the origin with radius R. As R grows to +∞, the discs
clearly become bigger and tend to cover the plane R2. So it is natural to expect
that f will be integrable on R2 if the limit of the integrals of f over BR(0) exists
and is ﬁnite, as R →+∞. More precisely,
Deﬁnition 8.34 Let f
:
R2
→
R be a positive and integrable map
over any disc BR(0). Then f is said integrable on R2 if the limit
lim
R→+∞

BR(0)
f(x, y) dx dy exists and is ﬁnite. The latter, called improper
integral of f on R2, is denoted by

R2 f(x, y) dx dy =
lim
R→+∞

BR(0)
f(x, y) dx dy .
Remark 8.35 i) The deﬁnition holds for maps of any sign by requiring |f(x, y)|
to be integrable. Recall that each map can be written as the diﬀerence of two
positive functions, its positive part f+(x, y) = max

f(x, y), 0

and its negative
part f−(x, y) = max

−f(x, y), 0

, i.e., f(x, y) = f+(x, y) −f−(x, y); then

336
8 Integral calculus in several variables

R2 f(x, y) dx dy =

R2 f+(x, y) dx dy −

R2 f−(x, y) dx dy .
ii) Other types of sets may be used to cover R2. Consider for example squares
QR(0) = [−R, R] × [−R, R] of base 2R, all centred at the origin. One can prove
that f integrable implies
lim
R→+∞

BR(0)
f(x, y) dx dy =
lim
R→+∞

QR(0)
f(x, y) dx dy .
iii) If the map is not deﬁned on all R2, but rather on an unbounded subset Ω, one
considers the limit of

BR(0)∩Ω
f(x, y) dx dy as R →+∞. If this is ﬁnite, again by
deﬁnition we set

Ω
f(x, y) dx dy =
lim
R→+∞

BR(0)∩Ω
f(x, y) dx dy .

Examples 8.36
i) Consider f(x, y) =
1

(3 + x2 + y2)3 , a map deﬁned on R2, positive and con-
tinuous. The integral on the disc BR(0) can be computed in polar coordinates:

making f integrable on R2.

Thus
lim
R→+∞

BR(0)
f(x, y) dx dy =
lim
R→+∞π log(1 + R2) = +∞
so the map is not integrable on R2.
iii) With what we have learned we are now able to compute an integral, of
paramount importance in Probability, that has to do with Gaussian density:
S =

e−x2 dx .

Integral calculus on curves and surfaces
With this chapter we conclude the study of multivariable integral calculus. In
the ﬁrst part we deﬁne integrals along curves in Rm and over surfaces in space,
by considering ﬁrst real-valued maps, then vector-valued functions. Integrating a
vector ﬁeld’s tangential component along a curve, or its normal component on a
surface, deﬁnes line and ﬂux integrals respectively; these are interpreted in Physics
as the work done by a force along a path, or the ﬂow across a membrane immersed
in a ﬂuid. Curvilinear integrals rely, de facto, on integrals over real intervals,
in the same way as surface integrals are computed by integrating over domains
in the plane. A certain attention is devoted to how integrals depend upon the
parametrisations and orientations of the manifolds involved.
Path and ﬂux integrals crop up in a series of results, among which three are
pivotal: the Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss’ Theorem), Green’s The-
orem and Stokes’ Theorem. They transfer to a multivariable framework the idea
at the heart of one-dimensional integration by parts, and namely: changing the
integral over a given domain into an integral over its boundary by modifying the
integrand function. The aforementioned theorems have a large number of applic-
ations, in particular diﬀerential equations governing physical laws; for instance,
the Divergence Theorem allows to compute the variation of the ﬂow of a unit of
matter by means of an integral over the volume, thus giving rise to the so-called
conservation laws.
The last part deals with conservative ﬁelds, which are gradients of vector ﬁelds,
and with the problem of computing the potential of a given ﬁeld. That is the mul-
tivariable version of indeﬁnite integration, which seeks primitive maps on the real
line. The applicative importance of conservative ﬁelds and their potentials is well
known: in many cases a gravitational ﬁeld or an electric force ﬁeld is conservative,
a fact allowing to compute the force’s work simply by diﬀerence of two values of
the potential.

9 Integral calculus on curves and surfaces
9.1 Integrating along curves
Curvilinear integrals in several variables are the natural generalisation of the def-
inite integral of a real map over a real interval. Curves were introduced in Sect. 4.6,
while their diﬀerential aspects were discussed in Sect. 6.5.
Let γ : I = [a, b] →Rm (m ≥2) be a regular arc, and Γ = γ(I) its trace.
Suppose f : dom f ⊆Rm →R is a map deﬁned on Γ, at least, meaning Γ ⊆dom f.
Suppose further that the composite f ◦γ : [a, b] →R, (f ◦γ)(t) = f(γ(t)), is
(piecewise) continuous on [a, b].
Deﬁnition 9.1 The integral of f along γ is the number

γ
f =
 b
a
f

γ(t)

∥γ′(t)∥dt .
(9.1)
Sometimes the name ‘curvilinear integral’ can be met.
The right-hand side of (9.1) is well deﬁned, because the integrand function
f

γ(t)

∥γ′(t)∥is (piecewise) continuous on [a, b]. As γ is regular, in fact, its com-
ponents’ ﬁrst derivatives are continuous and so is the norm ∥γ′(t)∥, by composition;
moreover, f

γ(t)

is (piecewise) continuous by hypothesis.
The geometrical meaning is the following. Let γ be a simple plane arc and f
non-negative along Γ; call
G(f) = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : (x, y) ∈dom f, z = f(x, y)}
the graph of f. If
Σ = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : (x, y) ∈Γ, 0 ≤z ≤f(x, y)}
denotes the upright surface fencing Γ up to the graph of f (see Fig. 9.1), it can be
proved that the area of Σ is given by the integral of f along γ. Say, for instance,
f is constant equal to h on Γ: then the area of Σ is the product of h times the
length of Γ; by Sect. 6.5.2 the length is ℓ(Γ) =
3 b
a ∥γ′(t)∥dt, whence
area (Σ) = h ℓ(Γ) =
 b
a
f

γ(t)

∥γ′(t)∥dt =

γ
f .
If f is not constant, instead, we can divide the interval I into K sub-intervals
Ik = [tk−1, tk] of width Δtk = tk −tk−1 suﬃciently small. Call Γk = γ(Ik) the
restriction to Ik, whose length is ℓ(Γk) =
3 tk
tk−1 ∥γ′(t)∥dt; then let Σk = {(x, y, z) ∈
R3 : (x, y) ∈Γk, 0 ≤z ≤f(x, y)} be the part of Σ over Γk (see again Fig. 9.1).
Given any t∗
k ∈Ik, with P ∗
k = γ(t∗
k) ∈Γk, we will have
area(Σk) ≃f(P ∗
k )ℓ(Γk) =
 tk

Figure 9.1. The geometrical meaning of integrating along a curve
Summing over k and letting the intervals’ width shrink to zero yields precisely
formula (9.1).
Recalling Deﬁnition 9.1, we can observe that the arc length s = s(t) of (6.20)
satisﬁes
ds
dt = ∥γ′(t)∥
which, in Leibniz’s notation, we may re-write as
ds = ∥γ′(t)∥dt .
The diﬀerential ds is the ‘inﬁnitesimal’ line element along the curve, corresponding
to an ‘inﬁnitesimal’ increment dt of the parameter t. Such considerations justify
indicating the integral of (9.1) by

γ

or

γ

(9.2)
(in the latter case, the map s = s(t) is written as γ = γ(t), not to be confused
with the vector notation of an arc γ = γ(t)).
Examples 9.2
i) Let γ : [0, 1] →R2 be the regular arc γ(t) = (t, t2) parametrising the parabola
y = x2 between O = (0, 0) and A = (1, 1). Since γ′(t) = (1, 2t), we have

This last example explains that curvilinear integrals depend not only on the
trace of the curve, but also on the chosen parametrisation. Nonetheless, congruent
parametrisations give rise to equal integrals, as we now show.
Let f be deﬁned on the trace of a regular arc γ : [a, b] →Rm so that f ◦γ
is (piecewise) continuous and the integral along γ exists. Then f ◦δ, too, where
δ is an arc congruent to γ, will be (piecewise) continuous because composition of
a continuous map between real intervals and the (piecewise-)continuous function
f ◦γ.
Proposition 9.3 Let γ : [a, b] →Rm be a regular arc of trace Γ, and f a
map on Γ such that f ◦γ is (piecewise) continuous. Then


ϕ′ > 0 (δ and γ are equivalent), or ϕ(c) = b, ϕ(d) = a if ϕ′ < 0 (δ and γ
are anti-equivalent). In the ﬁrst case we obtain

By the previous proposition the following result is straightforward.
Corollary 9.4 The curvilinear integral of a function does not change by tak-
ing opposite arcs.

additivity we have

(9.3)
This suggests how to extend the notion of integral to include piecewise-regular
arcs. More precisely, let γ : [a, b] →Rm be a piecewise-regular arc and a = a0 <
a1 < . . . < an = b points in [a, b] such that the arcs γi = γ|[ai−1,ai], i = 1, . . . , n,
are regular. Take f, as above, deﬁned at least on Γ such that f ◦γ is (piecewise)
continuous on [a, b]. By deﬁnition, then, we set

In view of subsequent applications, it makes sense to consider integrals along
a simple and regular arc Γ, thought of as a subset of Rm, see Deﬁnition 6.28.
We already know that all parametrisations of Γ by simple, regular arcs are con-
gruent (Proposition 6.27), and hence give rise to the same integral of a (piecewise-)
continuous map f along Γ (Proposition 9.3). For this reason one calls integral of
f along Γ the number


(9.7)
where γ is any regular and simple parametrisation of Γ. Equivalent symbols are


The generalisation to piecewise-regular, simple arcs should be clear. In case Γ is
closed, the integral might be denoted using the symbols

Remark 9.8 The integral of a (piecewise-)continuous f can be deﬁned along a
regular curve γ : I →Rm, where I is a bounded, but not closed, interval. For this,

9.1.1 Centre of mass and moments of a curve
As with thin plates and solid bodies, see Sect. 8.5, we can use curvilinear integ-
rals to deﬁne certain physical quantities related to a thin wire resting along a
(piecewise-)regular, simple arc Γ ⊂R3.
Let μ = μ(P) be the wire’s linear density (mass per unit of length) at a generic
P = x = (x, y, z) ∈Γ. The total mass will be
m =


and its centre of mass G = xG = (xG, yG, zG) is

where d = d(P) is the distance of P ∈Γ from the line or point considered. The

9.2 Path integrals
Integrating vector ﬁelds along curves gives rise to the notion of path integral,
presented below.
Let I = [a, b] and γ : I →Rm be a regular arc with trace Γ = γ(I). Take a
vector ﬁeld f in Rm, deﬁned on Γ at least. The composite map f ◦γ : t →f

γ(t)

from I to Rm is thus deﬁned. We shall assume the latter (piecewise) continuous,
so that all fi

γ(t)

are (piecewise) continuous from I to R. For any t ∈I, recall
that
τ(t) = τγ(t) =
γ′(t)
∥γ′(t)∥
is the unit tangent vector at P(t) = γ(t). The map fτ = f · τ,
fτ(t) =

f · τ

(t) = f

γ(t)

· τ(t) ,
is the component of f along the tangent direction to γ at P(t).
Deﬁnition 9.10 The path integral of f along γ is the integral along γ
of the map fτ:

γ
f · τ =

γ
fτ .
Another name for it is line integral of f along γ.
By deﬁnition of τ we have

γ
f · τ =
 b
a
f

γ(t)

· τ(t) ∥γ′(t)∥dt =
 b
a
f

γ(t)

· γ′(t) dt .
Thus, the integral of f along the path γ can be computed using

γ
f · τ =
 b
a
f

γ(t)

· γ′(t) dt .
(9.8)
Writing dγ
dt = γ′(t) as Leibniz does, or dγ = γ′(t) dt, we may also use the notation

γ
f · dγ .
There is a diﬀerence between the symbol dγ (a vector) and the diﬀerential dγ
of (9.2) (a scalar).
The physical meaning of path integrals is paramount. If f models a ﬁeld of
forces applied to the trace of the curve, the path integral is the work (the work
integral) of the force during the motion along γ. The counterpart to Proposition 9.3
is the following.

376
9 Integral calculus on curves and surfaces
Proposition 9.11 Let γ : [a, b] →Rm be a regular arc of trace Γ, f a vector
ﬁeld on Γ such that f ◦γ is (piecewise) continuous. Then

δ
f · τδ =

γ
f · τγ ,
for any arc δ equivalent to γ,
and

δ
f · τδ = −

γ
f · τγ ,
for any arc δ anti-equivalent to γ.
Proof.
This is a consequence of Proposition 9.3, because unit tangent vectors
satisfy τδ = τγ when δ ∼γ, and τδ = −τγ when δ ∼−γ.
2
Corollary 9.12 Swapping an arc with its opposite changes the sign of the
path integral:

−γ
f · τ(−γ) = −

γ
f · τγ .
In Physics it means that the work done by a force changes sign if one reverses the
orientation of the arc; once that is ﬁxed, the work depends only on the path and
not on the way one moves along it.
Here is another recurring deﬁnition in the applications.
Deﬁnition 9.13 If γ is a regular, closed arc, the path integral of f is said
circulation of f along γ and denoted
4
γ
f · τ .
Examples 9.14
i) The vector ﬁeld f : R3 →R3, f(x, y, z) = (ex, x+y, y+z) along γ : [0, 1] →R3,
γ(t) = (t, t2, t3), is given by
f

γ(t)

= (et, t + t2, t2 + t3)
with
γ′(t) = (1, 2t, 3t2) .
Hence, the path integral of f on γ is

γ
f · τ =
 1


γ
f · τ =
n

i=1

γi
f · τγi ,
(9.9)
where γi are regular arcs constituting γ.
At last, if we think geometrically (see Deﬁnition 6.28) and take a piecewise-
regular simple arc Γ ⊂Rm, the path integral along Γ can be deﬁned properly only
after one orientation on Γ has been chosen, and the orientation depends on the
tangent vector τ. Then we can deﬁne the path integral of f along Γ by

Γ
f · τ =

γ
f · τγ ,
(9.10)
where γ is any simple, (piecewise-)regular parametrisation of Γ with the chosen
orientation. Clearly, reversing the orientation has the eﬀect of changing the integ-
ral’s sign. The circulation of f along a piecewise-regular Jordan arc (closed and
simple) will be indicated by
4
Γ
f · τ .
A diﬀerent notation for the path integral, based on the language of diﬀerential
forms, is provided in Appendix A.2.3, p. 529.
9.3 Integrals over surfaces
In perfect analogy to curves, the integral on a surface of a map in three variables is a
natural way to extend double integrals over ﬂat regions. This section is dedicated

378
9 Integral calculus on curves and surfaces
to integrating over surfaces. To review surfaces, see Sect. 4.7, whilst for their
diﬀerential calculus see Sect. 6.7.
Let R be a compact, measurable region in R2, σ : R →R3 a compact regular
surface with trace Σ. The normal vector ν = ν(u, v) at P = σ(u, v) was deﬁned
in (6.48). Take a map f : dom f ⊆R3 →R deﬁned on Σ at least, and assume
f ◦σ is generically continuous on R.
Deﬁnition 9.15 The integral of f over the surface σ is the number

σ
f =

R
f

σ(u, v)

∥ν(u, v)∥du dv .
(9.11)
As the surface is regular, the function (u, v) →∥ν(u, v)∥is continuous on R, so
the right-hand-side integrand is generically continuous, hence integrable.
The deﬁnition is inspired by the following considerations. Suppose R is a rect-
angle with sides parallel to the (u, v)-axes, and let us divide it into rectangles
Rhk = [uh, uh + Δu] × [vk, vk + Δv] with lengths Δu, Δv, such that the interiors
◦
Rhk are pairwise disjoint (as in Fig. 9.3, left). The image of Rhk is the subset
Σhk of Σ bounded by the coordinate lines through σ(uh, vk), σ(uh + Δu, vk),
σ(uh, vk + Δv) and σ(uh + Δu, vk + Δv) (Fig. 9.3, right). If Δu and Δv are
small enough, the surface is well approximated by the parallelogram Πhk lying on
the surface’s tangent plane at σ(uh, vk), which is spanned by the tangent vectors
∂σ
∂u (uh, vk)Δu and ∂σ
∂v (uh, vk)Δv (Fig. 9.4). The area Δσ of Πhk is
Δσ =

∂σ
∂u (uh, vk) ∧∂σ
∂v (uh, vk)

The above result allows us to deﬁne integrals over regular, simple, compact
surfaces Σ ⊂R2 thought of as geometrical surfaces (see Deﬁnition 6.34). To be
precise, one calls integral of f on the surface Σ the quantity

Σ
f =

σ
f ,
(9.12)
where σ is any regular, simple parametrisation of Σ. Since all such σ are congruent,
the deﬁnition makes sense. Alternatively, one may also write

Σ
f(σ) dσ
or

Σ
f dσ .
Integrals can be deﬁned over piecewise-regular compact surfaces Σ, meaning
the union of n regular, simple compact surfaces Σ1, . . . , Σn as of Deﬁnition 6.43.
In such a case, one declares

Σ
f =
n

i=1

Σi
f .
Remark 9.18 The deﬁnition extends to cover non-compact surfaces, as we did

map of (9.11) be integrable on R.

For instance, the unit hemisphere Σ deﬁned by

disc D. Nonetheless, we may still use (9.9) to ﬁnd the surface’s area, because the

9.3.1 Area of a surface
Via surface integrals we can deﬁne the area of a compact surface Σ (piecewise
regular and simple) thoroughly, by
area(Σ) =

Σ

Example 9.19
i) The example of Remark 9.18 adapts to show that the area of the hemisphere
Σ of radius r is
area(Σ) =

Σ
1 = 2πr2 ,
as elementary geometry tells us.
ii) Let us compute the lateral surface Σ of a cylinder of radius r and height L.
Supposing the cylinder’s axis is the segment [0, L] along the z-axis, the surface Σ
is parametrised by σ(u, v) = r cos u i+r sin u j +v k, (u, v) ∈R = [0, 2π]×[0, L].
Easily then,
ν(u, v) = r cos u i + r sin u j + 0 k ,
whence ∥ν(u, v)∥= r. In conclusion,
area(Σ) =

It is no coincidence that the area is found by integrating along a meridian arc.
The cylinder is in fact a surface of revolution (Example 4.37 iii)):
Proposition 9.20 Let Σ deﬁne the surface of revolution generated by re-
volving the arc Γ, on the plane xz, around the z-axis. Then
area(Σ) = 2π

Proof.

Γ 1 =

Γ x
ℓ(Γ)
is the coordinate of the centre of mass G of Γ, corresponding to unit density along
the curve, we can state the formula as
area(Σ) = 2π xG ℓ(Γ) .
This is known as Guldin’s Theorem.
Theorem 9.21 The area of a surface of revolution Σ is the product of the
length of the meridian section times the length of the circle described by the
arc’s centre of mass.

9.3.2 Centre of mass and moments of a surface
Imagine a thin shell covering a (piecewise-)regular, simple, compact surface Σ ⊂

P ∈Σ, we can compute the total mass

9.4 Flux integrals
After learning how to integrate scalar ﬁelds on surfaces, we now turn to vector-
valued maps and deﬁne the fundamental notion of ﬂux integral, which will occupy
this section.
Let f be a vector ﬁeld on R3 that is deﬁned (at least) on the trace Σ of a
regular, compact surface σ : R →Σ, with R compact and measurable in R2. We
assume the composite f ◦σ is generically continuous on R. If n = n(u, v) is the
unit normal to Σ, one calls normal component of f the component fn = f · n
along n.

384
9 Integral calculus on curves and surfaces
Deﬁnition 9.22 The surface integral of f on σ is the integral on the
surface σ of the map fn:

σ
f · n =

σ
fn .
Because of Deﬁnition 6.35 we can compute surface integrals by

σ
f · n =

R
f

σ(u, v)

· ν(u, v) du dv .
(9.13)
As already seen for path integrals, congruent parametrisations in surface integrals
possibly entail a sign ambiguity.
Proposition 9.23 Let σ : R →R3 be a regular compact surface with trace
Σ, f a vector ﬁeld on Σ such that f ◦σ is generically continuous. Then

σ
f · 1n =

σ
f · n ,
for any compact surface 1σ equivalent to σ,
and

σ
f · 1n = −

σ
f · n ,
for any compact surface 1σ anti-equivalent to σ .
Proof.
The proof descends from Proposition 9.17 by observing that unit normals
are equal, 1n = n, if 1σ is equivalent to σ, and opposite, 1n = −n, if 1σ is
anti-equivalent to σ .
2
The proposition allows us to deﬁne the surface integral of a vector ﬁeld f
over a (piecewise-)regular, simple, compact surface Σ seen as embedded in R3. In
the light of Sect. 6.7.2, it is though necessary to consider orientable surfaces only
(Deﬁnition 6.38).
Let us thus assume that Σ is orientable, and that we have ﬁxed an orientation
on it, corresponding to one of the unit normals, henceforth denoted n. Now we
are in the position to deﬁne the ﬂux integral of f on Σ as

Σ
f · n =

σ
f · n ,
(9.14)
where σ is any simple and (piecewise-)regular parametrisation of Σ inducing
the chosen orientation. This integral is often called simply ﬂux of f across, or
through, Σ. The terminology stems from Physics; suppose the surface is immersed
in a ﬂuid of density μ = μ(x), and v = v(x) is the velocity of the point-particle

9.5 The Theorems of Gauss, Green, and Stokes
385
at P = x. Set f = μv and denote by ΔΣ the element of area Δσ and normal n.
Then (f · n) Δσ is the volume rate of ﬂuid ﬂow through ΔΣ per unit of time, i.e.,
the discharge. Summing, and passing to the limit, the ﬂux integral of f across Σ
is the diﬀerence between the overall outﬂow and inﬂow through the surface Σ.
When the surface Σ is bounded and encloses an open domain Ω, one speaks
about outgoing ﬂux or ingoing ﬂux according to whether the normal n leaves
Ω or enters Ω respectively.
Example 9.24
Let us determine the outgoing ﬂux of f(x) = yi −xj + zk through the sphere
centred in the origin and of radius r. We opt for spherical coordinates and para-
metrise by σ : [0, π] × [0, 2π] →R3, σ(u, v) = r sin u cosv i + r sin u sin v j +
r cos u k (see Example 4.37 iv)). The outgoing normal is
ν(x) = r sin u x = r sin u(xi + yj + zk) ,
see Example 6.36 ii). Therefore (f · ν)(x) = r sin uz2 = r3 sin u cos2 u, and
recalling (9.13), we have

Σ
f · n =
 2π
0
 π

r3 sin u cos2 u dudv = 4
3πr3 .
2
For the ﬂux integral, too, we may use an alternative notation based on the
language of diﬀerential forms; see Appendix A.2.3, p. 529.
9.5 The Theorems of Gauss, Green, and Stokes
The three theorems of the title should be considered multi-dimensional versions
of the formula of integration by parts. Each one of them allows to transform the
integral of an expression involving the diﬀerential operators of Sect. 6.3.1 on a two-
or three-dimensional domain, or a surface, into the integral over the boundary of
an expression without derivatives.
The importance of such results is paramount, both from the theoretical point
of view and in relationship to applications. They typically manifest themselves,
for example, when one formulates a law of Physics (e.g., the conservation of mass
or energy) in mathematical language (a PDE); but they may also play a role in
determining the conditions that guarantee the solvability of said equations (exist-
ence and uniqueness of solutions); at last, several numerical techniques for solving
equations (such as the ﬁnite-volume method and the ﬁnite-element method) are
implemented by using one of the theorems.
At a more immediate level, these results enable to simplify an integral, and
crop up when examining special vector ﬁelds, like conservatives ﬁelds.
We start by discussing a class of open sets and surfaces, that we will call
admissible, for which the theorems hold. A ﬁrst, basic study of Sects. 9.5.2 - 9.5.4
does not require such level of detail.

9.5.1 Open sets, admissible surfaces and boundaries
Open sets in the plane. Let Γ ⊂R2 be a piecewise-regular Jordan arc with a
given orientation. The unit tangent vector t = t1i+t2j exists at all points P of Γ,
with the exception of a ﬁnite number. At P the normal direction v to Γ (orthogonal
to t) is thus well deﬁned. In particular, the unit vector n = n1i+n2j = t2i−t1j to
Γ at P is obtained rotating t clockwise by π/2 (Fig. 9.5); otherwise said, identifying
n and t with n + 0k and t + 0k in R3 makes the triple (n, t, k) right-handed, for
(n∧t)·k = 1. (Notice that the unit vector n might not coincide with the principal
normal of (6.22), whose orientation varies with the curve’s convexity; at any rate
the two vectors clearly diﬀer by a sign, at most.) Furthermore, Γ separates the
region inside Γ from the external region, by virtue of Jordan’s Curve Theorem 4.33.
Deﬁnition 9.25 We call a bounded open set Ω ⊂R2 G-admissible if the
following hold:
i) the boundary ∂Ω is a ﬁnite union of piecewise-regular, pairwise-disjoint
Jordan arcs Γ1, . . . , ΓK;
ii) Ω is entirely contained either inside, or outside, each Γk.
Each point P ∈∂Ω will belong to one, and one only, Jordan arc Γk, so there
will be (save for a ﬁnite number of points) a unit normal n to Γk at P, that
is chosen to point outwards Ω (precisely, all points Q = P + εn, with ε > 0
suﬃciently small, lie outside Ω). We will say n is the outgoing unit normal to
∂Ω, or for short, the outgoing normal of ∂Ω.
The choice of the outward-pointing orientation induces an orientation on the
boundary ∂Ω. In fact, on every arc Γk we will ﬁx the orientation so that, if t denotes
the tangent vector, the frame (n, t, k) is oriented positively. Intuitively, one could
say that a three-dimensional observer standing as k and walking along
Γk will see Ω on his left (Fig. 9.6). We shall call this the positive orientation
of ∂Ω (and the opposite one negative).

Figure 9.6. A G-admissible open set in the plane
Open sets in space. The whole discussion on two-dimensional G-admissible open
sets extends easily to space. For this, we recall that every closed and orientable
surface divides space in a region enclosed by the surface and one outside it (The-
orem 6.42).
Deﬁnition 9.26 We call a bounded open set Ω ⊂R3 G-admissible if:
i) its boundary ∂Ω is the union of a ﬁnite number of pairwise-disjoint sur-
faces Σ1, . . . , ΣK;
ii) each Σk is piecewise regular, simple, orientable and closed;
iii) Ω lies entirely inside or outside every surface Σk.
For a given G-admissible open set there is a well-deﬁned outgoing normal n
to ∂Ω, which will coincide with the normal to the surface Σk oriented from the
inside towards the outside of Ω (Fig. 9.7).
Here are some examples of G-admissible open sets.
Examples 9.27
i) The inside of the elementary solids (e.g., parallelepipeds, polyhedra, cylinders,
cones, spheres), and of any regular deformation of these, are G-admissible.
ii) We say an open bounded set Ω ⊂R3 is regular and normal for z in case
Ω is normal for z as in Deﬁnition 8.27,
Ω =

(x, y, z) ∈R3 : (x, y) ∈D,α (x, y) < z < β(x, y)

,
where D is open in R2 with boundary ∂D a piecewise-regular Jordan arc, and
α,β are C1 maps on D. Such an open set is G-admissible.

Figure 9.7. A G-admissible open set in R3 (with K = 1)
The boundary of Ω consists of a single surface Σ1, piecewise regular, normal,
orientable and closed; in fact, we can decompose Σ1 = Σβ ∪Σα ∪Σℓ, where
Σβ =

The outgoing unit normal nβ to Σβ is obtained by normalising
νβ(x, y) = −∂β
∂x(x, y) i −∂β
∂y (x, y) j + k ,
Σβ being a local graph (see Example 6.36, i)).
Similarly, the outgoing unit normal nα to Σα is the unit vector corresponding
to
να(x, y) = ∂α
∂x (x, y) i + ∂α
∂y (x, y) j −k .
The outgoing normal nℓto Σℓis
n = n∂D + 0k ,
where n∂D is the outgoing unit normal (in two dimensions) of ∂D.
Regular and normal sets for x or y are deﬁned in the same way.
iii) Let us see how to generalise the above situation. The open sets Ω1, . . . , ΩK
form a partition of an open set Ω if the Ωk are pairwise disjoint and the union
of their closures coincides with the closure of Ω:
Ω =
K
0
k=1
Ωk
with
Ωh ∩Ωk = ∅
if h ̸= k .
We then say an open bounded set Ω of R3 is piecewise regular and normal
for xi (i = 1, 2, 3) if it admits a partition into open, regular, normal sets for xi
(see Fig. 9.8 for the two-dimensional picture). Such Ω is G-admissible.

Compact surfaces. Henceforth Σ will denote a piecewise-regular, normal and
orientable compact surface as of Sect. 6.7.4; let Σk, k = 1, . . . , K, be its faces,
each of which is normal, regular and compact.
The notion of S-admissible compact surfaces is relevant in view of Stokes’
Theorem.
Deﬁnition 9.28 We call S-admissible a compact, piecewise-regular, nor-
mal, orientable surface Σ whose faces Σk, k = 1, . . . , K, can be parametrised
by maps σk : Rk →Σk where Rk = Ωk is the closure of a G-admissible open
set Ωk in the plane.
Given such an S-admissible, compact surface Σ, we will assume to have ﬁxed
one orientation by choosing a normal n to Σ. On each face Σk, n coincides with
one of the unit normals to Σk, say nk. Without loss of generality we may suppose
nk is the unit normal associated to the parametrisation σk, see Deﬁnition 6.35.
(If not, it is enough to swap σk with 1σk on 1Rk = {(u, v) ∈R2 : (−u, v) ∈Rk}
given by 1σk(u, v) = (−u, v), whose unit normal is opposite to that of σk.)
By compactness, the unit normal n is deﬁned right up to the boundary of Σ
(with the exception of ﬁnitely many points, at most). For this reason we can choose
an orientation on ∂Σ. Roughly speaking, the positive orientation is given by
the walking direction of an ideal observer standing as n that proceeds
along the boundary and keeps the surface at his left.
A more accurate deﬁnition requires a little extra work. Every point P belonging
to ∂Σ, except for a ﬁnite number, lies on the boundary of exactly one face Σk
(Fig. 9.9); moreover, around P the boundary ∂Σk is a regular arc Γk in R3, given by
the image under σk of a regular arc Δk in R2 contained in the boundary of a region
Rk. In other terms, Δk = {γk(t) : t ∈Ik}, where γk is the parametrisation of the
Jordan arc containing Δk, and correspondingly Γk = {ηk(t) = σk

γk(t)

: t ∈Ik};
the point P ∈Γk will be image under σk of a point p0 ∈Δk identiﬁed by t = t0,

k(t0)
(recall the chain rule), tangent to Γk at P. Let t be the corresponding unit vector.
Then, if we assume that γk induces the positive orientation on the Jordan arc
where Δk lies, we will say the orientation of the arc Γk ⊂∂Σ induced by
the unit vector t is positive. We can say the same in the following way. Let Π
be the tangent plane to Σ at P that contains t, and denote by g the unit vector
orthogonal to t, lying on Π and pointing outside Σ; then the positive orientation
of ∂Σ is the one rendering (g, t, n) a positively-oriented triple (see again Fig. 9.9).
Example 9.29
Suppose Σ is given by
Σ = {(x, y, z) ∈R3 : (x, y) ∈R, z = ϕ(x, y)} ,
(9.15)
where R is a closed, bounded region of the plane, the boundary ∂R is a regular
Jordan arc Γ parametrised by γ : I →Γ, and ϕ is a C1 map on the open set A
containing R; let Ω indicate the region inside Γ.
The surface Σ is thus compact, S-admissible and parametrised by σ : R →Σ,
σ(x, y) =

x, y,ϕ (x, y)

. The corresponding unit normal is

9.5.2 Divergence Theorem
The theorem in question asserts that under suitable hypotheses the integral of a
ﬁeld’s divergence over an open bounded set of Rn is the ﬂux integral of the ﬁeld
across the boundary: letting Ω denote the open set and n the outward normal to
the boundary ∂Ω, we have

Ω
div f =

∂Ω
f · n .
(9.18)
We held back on purpose from making precise hypotheses on Ω and f, as
multiple possibilities exist. The theorem’s proofs may be sensibly simpliﬁed by
suﬃciently restrictive assumptions, at the cost of diminishing its far-reaching im-
pact. Finding ‘minimal’ hypotheses for its validity is a task beyond the scope of
our study.
In the sequel the Divergence Theorem will be stated under the assumption that
the domain Ω be G-admissible, as discussed in Sect. 9.5.1; far from being the most
general, our statement will hold nonetheless in the majority of cases of interest.
The reader that wishes to skip the details might think of a G-admissible set as
an open bounded set whose boundary is made of ﬁnitely many graphs of regular
maps, locally viewing the open set on the same side. The outward normal of the
open set will be the outward normal of each graph.
Let us begin in dimension three, by the following preparatory, but relevant
irrespectively, result. The proof is available in Appendix A.2.2, p. 524, under more
stringent, but still signiﬁcant, assumptions on the domain. Hereafter, Cartesian
coordinates will be equivalently denoted by x1, x2, x3 or by x, y, z.
Proposition 9.30 Let the open set Ω ⊂R3 be G-admissible, and assume
f ∈C0(Ω) with ∂f

∈C0(Ω), i ∈{1, 2, 3}. Then

Proposition 9.30 is the most straightforward multi-dimensional generalisation
of the recipe for integrating by parts on a bounded real interval, as we mentioned
in the chapter’s introduction. Its importance is cardinal, because the Divergence
Theorems and Green’s Theorem descend easily from it. Let us see the ﬁrst of these
consequences.

There is actually a version of the Divergence Theorem in every dimension
n ≥2. We will only show how the two-dimensional form below is a consequence
of the three-dimensional one; for this we shall use a trick.

to ∂Ω point outwards. Then for any vector ﬁeld f ∈

Deﬁne the open set Q = Ω × (0, 1) ⊂R3, which is G-admissible (see
Fig. 9.10); let Φ = f + 0k ∈

On the other hand, if N is the outward normal to ∂Q, it is easily seen that
f · n = Φ · N on ∂Ω × (0, 1), whereas Φ · N = 0 on Ω × {0} and Ω × {1}.

open set and f a C1 vector ﬁeld on Ω. As we know, the ﬁrst component of the curl
of f is
(curl f)1 = ∂f3
∂y −∂f2
∂z .
Therefore integrating over Ω and using the proposition repeatedly, we obtain

Identities of this kind hold for the other components of the curl of f. Altogether
we then have the following result, that we might call Curl Theorem.

mal to ∂Ω. Then, for any vector ﬁeld f ∈

If we write the curl as ∇∧f, the formula can be remembered as follows: the
integral over Ω becomes an integral on ∂Ω and the vector n takes the place of ∇.
As we show in the online material, Green’s Theorem should be considered a
two-dimensional version of the above, and can be easily deduced with the trick
used for Theorem 9.32.
One last remark is in order in the run up to Green’s Theorem. Let Ω ⊂R2 be
open and G-admissible. If n = n1i + n2j is the outward normal to ∂Ω, the unit
vector t = −n2i + n1j is tangent to ∂Ω and oriented along the positive direction
of the boundary: a three-dimensional observer standing as k and walking along
∂Ω will see Ω constantly on his left (Fig. 9.11). Now recall that given a ﬁeld
f = f1i + f2j ∈

C1(Ω)
2, we deﬁned in (6.5) the function curl f = ∂f2
∂x −∂f1
∂y .
Finally everything is in place for the statement, whose proof may be found in
Appendix A.2.2, p. 525.
Theorem 9.35 (Green) Let Ω ⊂R2 be a G-admissible open set whose
boundary ∂Ω is positively oriented. Take a vector ﬁeld f = f1i + f2j in

The theorem can be successfully employed to reduce the computation of the
area of a domain in the plane to a path integral. Fix Ω ⊂R2 open and G-admissible
as in the theorem. Then
area(Ω) =

9.5.4 Stokes’ Theorem
We discuss Stokes’ Theorem for a rather large class of surfaces, that is S-admissible
compact surfaces, introduced with Deﬁnition 9.28. Eschewing the formal deﬁnition,
the reader may think of an S-admissible compact surface as the union of ﬁnitely
many regular local graphs forming an orientable and simple compact surface. With
a given crossing direction ﬁxed, we shall say the boundary is oriented positively if
an observer standing as the normal and advancing along the boundary, views the
surface on the left.
First of all we re-phrase Green’s Theorem in an equivalent way, the advantage
being to understand it now as a special case of Stokes’ Theorem. We can identify
the closure of Ω, in R2, with the compact surface Σ = Ω×{0} in R3 (see Fig. 9.12);
the latter admits the trivial parametrisation σ : Ω →Σ, σ(u, v) = (u, v, 0), and
is obviously regular, simple and orientable, hence S-admissible. The boundary is
∂Σ = ∂Ω×{0}. Fix as crossing direction of Σ the one given by the z-axis: by calling
n the unit normal, we have n = k. Furthermore, the positive orientation on ∂Ω
coincides patently with the positive orientation of ∂Σ. The last piece of notation
is the vector ﬁeld Φ = f + 0k (constant in z), for which curl f = (curlΦ )3 =
(curlΦ ) · n; Equation (9.22) then becomes

Σ
(curlΦ ) · n =
4
∂Σ
Φ · τ ,
which – as we shall see – is precisely what Stokes’ Theorem claims.
We are then ready to state Stokes’ Theorem in full generality; the proof is
available in Appendix A.2.2, p. 526, in the case the faces are suﬃciently regular
local graphs.

Theorem 9.37 (Stokes) Let Σ ⊂R3 be an S-admissible compact surface
oriented by the unit normal n; correspondingly, let the boundary ∂Σ be ori-
ented positively. Suppose the vector ﬁeld f, deﬁned on an open set A ⊆R3
containing Σ, is such that f ∈

3. Then


(9.24)
In other words, the ﬂux of the curl of f across the surface equals the path
integral of f along the surface’s (closed) boundary.
Example 9.38
We use Stokes’ Theorem to tackle Example 9.33 in an alternative way. The idea
is to write f = 2i −5j + 3k as f = curlΦ . Since the components of f are
constant, it is natural to look for a Φ of the form
Φ(x, y, z) = (α1x + α2y + α3z)i + (β1x + β2y + β3z)j + (γ1x + γ2y + γ3z)k ,
so
curlΦ = (γ2 −β3)i + (α3 −γ1)j + (β1 −α2)k .
Then γ2 −β3 = 2, α3 −γ1 = −5, β1 −α2 = 3. A solution is then Φ(x, y, z) =
−5zi + 3xj + 2yk. (Notice that the existence of a ﬁeld Φ such that f = curlΦ
is warranted by Sect. 6.3.1, for div f = 0 and Ω is convex.) By Stokes’ Theorem,

We know ∂Σ = ∂B0 ∪∂B1, see Example 9.33, where the circle ∂B0 is oriented
clockwise, while ∂B1 counter-clockwise.

9.6 Conservative ﬁelds and potentials
In Sect. 6.3.1, Deﬁnition 6.10, we introduced the notion of a conservative ﬁeld on
an open set Ω of Rn as a ﬁeld f that is the gradient of a map ϕ, called the potential
of f
f = grad ϕ ,
on Ω .
Path integrals of conservative ﬁelds enjoy very special properties. The ﬁrst one
we encounter is in a certain sense the generalisation to curves of the Fundamental
Theorem of Integral Calculus (see in particular Vol. I, Cor. 9.39).
Proposition 9.39 If f = grad ϕ is a conservative and continuous ﬁeld on
Ω ⊆Rn, then

9 Integral calculus on curves and surfaces
Corollary 9.40 Under the hypotheses of the previous proposition, let Γ ⊂
Rn be a (piecewise-)regular, simple arc oriented by the tangent vector τ. Then

Γ
f · τ = ϕ(P1) −ϕ(P0) ,
where P0 and P1 are the initial and end points of Γ.
An elementary but remarkable use of this corollary is that the potential of a
conservative ﬁeld is deﬁned up to a constant on each connected component of Ω.
Hence potentials behave somehow similarly to primitives in R, namely:
Proposition 9.41 Two scalar ﬁelds ϕ, ψ are potentials of the same continu-
ous vector ﬁeld f on Ω if and only if on every connected component Ωi of Ω
there is a constant ci such that ϕ −ψ = ci.
Proof.
It is clear that if ϕ and ψ diﬀer by a constant on Ωi, then ∇ϕ = ∇ψ.
For the converse, ﬁx P0 arbitrarily in Ωi; given any P ∈Ωi, let Γ be a
polygonal path starting at P0 and ending at P (such will exist because Ωi
is connected, see Deﬁnition 4.13). Then the corollary guarantees

Γ
f · τ = ϕ(P) −ϕ(P0) = ψ(P) −ψ(P0) ,
from which ϕ(P) −ψ(P) = ϕ(P0) −ψ(P0) = ci.
2
Proposition 9.39 and Corollary 9.40 tell us the path integral of a conservat-
ive ﬁeld depends only on the end points and not on the path itself. Equivalently,
arcs joining the same two points give rise to equal path integrals. In particular,
the integral along a closed arc is zero. That each of these two facts character-
ise conservative ﬁelds is of primary importance. To establish this, we need some
notation, also useful for later. If γ : [a, b] →Rn is an arc between P0 = γ(a)
and P1 = γ(b), we shall write γ[P0, P1] to mean that γ goes from P0 to P1. The
opposite arc −γ (see Deﬁnition 6.25) joins P1 to P0, i.e., −γ[P1, P0] = γ[P0, P1].
Given γ1 = γ1[P0, P1] and γ2 = γ2[P1, P2], by γ ∼γ1 + γ2 we will denote any
arc γ with the following property: if γ : [a, b] →Rn, there is a c ∈(a, b) with
γ|[a,c] ∼γ1 and γ|[c,b] ∼γ2. (An example can be easily found using increas-
ing linear maps from [a, c], [c, b] to the domains of γ1, γ2 respectively.) Observe
γ(c) = P1 and γ = γ[P0, P2], so γ connects P0 to P2 passing through P1; moreover,
the traces Γ,Γ 1 and Γ2 satisfy Γ = Γ1 ∪Γ2. The symbol γ ∼γ1 −γ2 will stand
for γ ∼γ1 + (−γ2) whenever γ1 = γ1[P0, P1] and γ2 = γ2[P2, P1]. By the ad-
ditivity of curvilinear integrals, and recalling how they depend upon congruent
parametrisations (9.5), we have

γ ∼γ1 ± γ2 .

9.6 Conservative ﬁelds and potentials

Now we are in a position to state the result.
Theorem 9.42 If f is a continuous vector ﬁeld on the open set Ω ⊆Rn, the
following are equivalent:
i) f is conservative;
ii) for any (piecewise-)regular arcs γ1, γ2 with trace in Ω and common end
points,

γ1
f · τ =

γ2
f · τ ;
iii) for any (piecewise-)regular, closed arc γ with trace in Ω,
4
γ
f · τ = 0 .
Proof.
The implication i) ⇒ii) follows easily from Proposition 9.39 on γ1, γ2
(Fig. 9.13, left). For the converse, we manufacture an explicit potential for
f. Let Ωi denote a connected component of Ω and P0 ∈Ωi a given point.
For any P ∈Ωi of coordinates x = (x1, . . . , xn), set
ϕ(x) =

γ
f · τ
where γ = γ[P0, P] is an arbitrary (piecewise-)regular arc with trace inside
Ωi, joining P0 and P. The deﬁnition of ϕ(x) does not depend on the choice
of γ, by ii). We claim that grad ϕ = f, and will prove it only for the ﬁrst
component
∂ϕ

(x) = f1(x) .
Let Δx1 ̸= 0 be an increment such that P + ΔP = x + Δx1e1 still

γ[P0, P] and γ[P0, P + ΔP] be regular, simple curves from P0 to P and
P + ΔP respectively (Fig. 9.13, right). Then γ[P0, P + ΔP] ∼γ[P0, P] +
γ[P, P + ΔP], and by (9.25) and (9.8), we have

The equivalence of ii) and iii) is an immediate consequence of (9.25): if
γ1, γ fulﬁll ii) then each γ ∼γ1 −γ2 satisﬁes iii), while a γ satisfying iii),
as seen above, is the diﬀerence of γ1, γ2 with common end points.

The question remains of how to characterise conservative ﬁelds. A necessary
condition is the following.
Property 9.43 Let f be a C1 vector ﬁeld on Ω ⊆Rn. If it is conservative,
we have
∂fi
∂xj
= ∂fj
∂xi
∀i ̸= j .
(9.26)
Proof.
Take a potential ϕ for f, so fi =
∂ϕ
∂xi for i = 1, . . . , n; in particular ϕ ∈
C2(Ω). Then formula (9.26) is nothing but Schwarz’s Theorem 5.17.
2
We met this property in Sect. 6.3.1 (Proposition 6.8 for dimension two and Pro-
position 6.7 for dimension three); in fact, it was proven there that a conservative
C1 vector ﬁeld is necessarily irrotational, curl f = 0, on Ω.
At this juncture one would like to know if, and under which conditions, being
curl-free is also suﬃcient to be conservative. From now on we shall suppose Ω
is open in R2 or R3. By default we will think in three dimensions, and highlight
a few peculiarities of the two-dimensional situation. Referring to the equivalent
formulation appearing in Theorem 9.42 iii), note that if γ is any regular, simple
arc whose trace Γ is the boundary of a regular and simple compact surface Σ
contained in Ω, Stokes’ Theorem 9.37 makes sure that f irrotational implies

9.6 Conservative ﬁelds and potentials

γ
f · τ =

Σ
curl f · n = 0 .
Nevertheless, not all regular and simple closed arcs Γ in Ω are boundaries of a
regular and simple compact surface Σ in Ω: the shape of Ω might prevent this
from happening. If, for example, Ω is the complement in R3 of the axis z, it is
self-evident that any compact surface having a closed boundary encircling the axis
must also intersect the axis, so it will not be contained entirely in Ω (see Fig. 9.14);
in this circumstance Stokes’ Theorem does not hold. This fact in itself does not
obstruct the vanishing of the circulation of a curl-free ﬁeld around z; it just says
Stokes’ Theorem does not apply. In spite of that, if we consider the ﬁeld
f(x, y, z) = −
y
x2 + y2 i +

x2 + y2 j + 0 k
on Ω, undoubtedly curl f = 0 on Ω, whereas

with Γ the counter-clockwise unit circle on the xy-plane centred at the origin. This
is therefore an example (extremely relevant from the physical viewpoint, by the
way, f being the magnetic ﬁeld generated by a current along a wire on the z-axis)
of an irrotational vector ﬁeld that is not conservative on Ω.
The discussion suggests to narrow the class of open sets Ω, in such a way that
f

holds. With this in mind, let us give a deﬁnition.

9 Integral calculus on curves and surfaces
Deﬁnition 9.44 An open connected set Ω ⊆Rn is simply connected if the
trace Γ of any arc in Ω can be deformed with continuity to a point, always
staying within Ω.
More precisely: Ω is simply connected if any closed curve γ : I →Rn belongs to a
one-parameter family of closed curves γs : I →Rn, 0 ≤s ≤1, with the following
properties:
i)
the map (t, s) →γs(t) from I × [0, 1] to Rn is continuous;
ii) each trace Γs = γs(I) is contained in Ω;
iii) γ1 = γ and γ0 is constant, i.e., Γ0 is a point.
One says γ is homotopic to a point, and the map (t, s) →γs(t) is known as
a homotopy.
Simply connectedness can be deﬁned alternatively. For instance, in dimension
2 we may equivalently demand that
•
the complement of Ω in R2 is a connected set,
or
•
for any Jordan arc γ in Ω, the interior Σi is entirely contained in Ω.
Na¨ıvely, an open connected set in the plane is simply connected if it has no
‘holes’; an (open) annulus is thus not simply connected (see Fig. 9.15, left).
The situation in three dimension is more intricate. The open domain enclosed
by two concentrical spheres is simply connected, whereas an open torus is not
(Fig. 9.15, middle and right).
Likewise, the open set obtained by removing one point from R3 is simply con-
nected, but if we take out a whole line it is not simply connected any longer. It
can be proved that an open connected set Ω in R3 is simply connected if and only
if for any (piecewise-)regular Jordan arc Γ in Ω, there exists a regular compact
surface Σ in Ω that has Γ as boundary.

Figure 9.16. A closed simple arc (left) bordering a compact surface (right)
The above characterisation leads to the rather-surprising result for which any
curve in space that closes up, even if knotted, is the boundary of a regular compact
surface. This is possible because the surface is not required to be simple; as a matter
of fact its trace may consist of faces intersecting transversely (as in Fig. 9.16).
Returning to the general set-up, there exist geometrical conditions that guar-
antee an open set Ω ⊆Rn is simply connected. For instance, convex open sets
are simply connected, and the same is true for star-shaped sets; the latter admit
a point P0 ∈Ω such that the segment P0P from P0 to an arbitrary P ∈Ω is con-
tained in Ω (see Fig. 9.17). In particular, a convex set is star-shaped with respect
to any of its points.
Finally, here is the awaited characterization of conservative ﬁelds; the proof is
given in Appendix A.2.2, p. 527.
Theorem 9.45 Let Ω ⊆Rn, with n = 2 or 3, be open and simply connected.
A vector ﬁeld f of class C1 on Ω is conservative if and only if it is curl-free.
A similar result ensures the existence of a potential vector for a ﬁeld with no
divergence.
Remark 9.46 The concepts and results presented in this section may be equi-
valently expressed by the terminology of diﬀerential forms. We refer to Ap-
pendix A.2.3, p. 529, for further details.

9.6.1 Computing potentials explicitly
Suppose f is conservative on an open (without loss of generality, connected) set
Ω ⊆Rn. We wish to ﬁnd a potential for f, which we already know will be deﬁned
up to a constant. Let us explain two diﬀerent methods for doing this.
The ﬁrst method uses the representation seen in Theorems 9.42 and 9.45. To
be precise, ﬁx a point P0 and deﬁne the potential at every P ∈Ω of coordinate x
by
ϕ(x) =

Γ[P0,P ]
f · τ ,
where Γ[P0, P] ⊂Ω is a simple and (piecewise-)regular arc from P0 to P. The
idea is to choose the path to make the integral as simple as possible to compute
(recall that the integral is independent of the path, by part ii) of Theorem 9.42).
In many cases, the best option is a polygonal path with segments parallel to the
coordinate axes; if so, over each segment the integrand f · τ depends only on one
component of f.
Example 9.47
Consider the ﬁeld
f(x, y) =
y
√1 + 2xy i +
x
√1 + 2xy j
deﬁned on the open set Ω between the branches of the hyperbola xy = −1/2. It
is not hard to convince oneself that Ω is star-shaped with respect to the origin,
and curl f = 0 on Ω; hence the vector ﬁeld is conservative. To ﬁnd a potential,
we may use as path the segment from (0, 0) to P = (x, y) given by γ(t) = (tx, ty),
0 ≤t ≤1. Then
ϕ(x, y) =

1 + 2xyt2 dt .
Substituting u = 1 + 2xyt2, so du = 4xyt dt, we have

1 + 2xy −1 .
The generic potential of f on Ω will be
ϕ(x, y) =

1 + 2xy + c .

The second method we propose, often easier to use than the previous one,
consists in integrating with respect to the single variables, using one after the
other the relationships

9.6 Conservative ﬁelds and potentials
405
From
∂ϕ
∂x (x, y) = f1(x, y)
we obtain
ϕ(x, y) = F1(x, y) + ψ1(y) ,
where F1(x, y) is any primitive map of f1(x, y) with respect to x, i.e., it satisﬁes
∂F1
∂x (x, y) = f1(x, y), while ψ1(y), for the moment unknown, is the constant of the
previous integration in x, hence depends on y only. To pin down this function, we
diﬀerentiate the last displayed equation with respect to y
dψ1
dy (y) = ∂ϕ
∂y (x, y) −∂F1
∂y (x, y) = f2(x, y) −∂F1
∂y (x, y) = g(y) .
Note f2(x, y) −∂F1
∂y (x, y) depends only on y, because its x-derivative vanishes
by (9.26), since
∂f2
∂x (x, y) −∂
∂y
∂F1
∂x (x, y) = ∂f2
∂x (x, y) −∂f1
∂y (x, y) = 0 .
Calling G(y) an arbitrary primitive of g(y), we have
ψ1(y) = G(y) + c
whence
ϕ(x, y) = F1(x, y) + G(y) + c .
In higher dimension, successive integrations determine one after the other the
unknown maps ψ1(x2, . . . , xn), ψ2(x3, . . . , xn), . . . , ψn−1(xn) that depend on a de-
creasing number of variables.

produces ϕ(x, y, z) = 2xyz + ψ1(y, z). Its derivative in y, and ∂ϕ
∂y (x, y, z) =
2xz + 6yz, tells that ∂ψ1
∂y (y, z) = 6yz, so
ψ1(y, z) = 3y2z + ψ2(z) .

Diﬀerentiating the latter with respect to z, and recalling ∂ϕ
∂z (x, y, z) = 2xy +
3y2 + 2z, gives
dψ2
dz (z) = 2z ,
hence ψ2(z) = z2 + c. In conclusion, all potentials for f are of the form
ϕ(x, y, z) = 2xyz + 3y2z + z2 + c .

We close the section by calling the attention to a class of conservative ﬁelds
for which the potential is particularly easy to ﬁnd. These are the so-called radial
vector ﬁelds,
f(x) = g(∥x∥) x ,
where g = g(r) is a real, continuous function on an interval I of [0, +∞). A ﬁeld is
radial when at each point P it is collinear with the vector OP, and its norm depends
merely on the distance of P from the origin. A straightforward computation shows
f is conservative on Ω = {x ∈Rn : ∥x∥∈I} and gives a potential. Precisely,
deﬁne
ϕ(x) = G(∥x∥)
where G = G(r) is an arbitrary primitive map of rg(r) on I. In fact, the chain
rule plus Example 5.3 i), give
∇ϕ(x) = G′(∥x∥) x
∥x∥= ∥x∥g(∥x∥) x
∥x∥= f(x) .
For example, f(x) =
x

1 + ∥x∥2 admits ϕ(x) =

1 + ∥x∥2 as potential.

29. The ﬁeld f is deﬁned on the whole R3 (clearly simply connected), and its curl
is zero. By Theorem 9.45 then, f is conservative.
To ﬁnd a potential ϕ, start from
∂ϕ
∂x = x ,
∂ϕ
∂y = −2y ,
∂ϕ
∂z = 3z .
(9.27)
From the ﬁrst we get
ϕ(x, y, z) = 1
2x2 + ψ1(y, z) .
Diﬀerentiating in y and using the second equation in (9.27) gives
∂ϕ
∂y (x, y, z) = ∂ψ1
∂y (y, z) = −2y ,
hence
ψ1(y, z) = −y2 + ψ2(z)
and
ϕ(x, y, z) = 1
2x2 −y2 + ψ2(z) .
Now we diﬀerentiate ϕ in z and use the last in (9.27):
∂ϕ
∂z (x, y, z) = dψ2
dz (z) = 3z ,
so
ψ2(z) = 3
2z2 + c .
All in all, a potential for f is
ϕ(x, y, z) = 1
2x2 −y2 + 3
2z2 + c ,
c ∈R .
30. The ﬁeld is deﬁned over the simply connected plane R2. It is thus enough to
impose
∂f1
∂y (x, y) = ∂f2
∂x (x, y) ,
where f1(x, y) = y sin x + xy cos x + ey and f2(x, y) = g(x) + xey, for the ﬁeld to
be conservative. This translates to
sin x + x cos x + ey = g′(x) + ey ,
i.e., g′(x) = sin x + x cos x. Integrating,
g(x) =

(sin x + x cos x) dx = x sin x + c ,
c ∈R .
The condition g(0) = 0 forces c = 0, so the required map is g(x) = x sin x.
To ﬁnd a potential ϕ for f, we must necessarily have
∂ϕ
∂y (x, y, z) = y sin x + xy cos x + ey
and
∂ϕ
∂y (x, y, z) = x sin x + xey .

The second equation gives
ϕ(x, y) = xy sin x + xey + ψ(x) ;
diﬀerentiating in x and using the ﬁrst equation gives
∂ϕ
∂x (x, y, z) = y sin x + xy cos x + ey + ψ′(x) = y sin x + xy cos x + ey .
Therefore ψ′(x) = 0, so ψ(x) = c for an arbitrary constant c in R. In conclusion,
ϕ(x, y) = xy sin x + xey + c ,
c ∈R .

b) ϕ(x, y) = y2 log x + x cos y.

Ordinary diﬀerential equations
Diﬀerential equations are among the mathematical instruments most widely used
in applications to other ﬁelds. The book’s ﬁnal chapter presents in a self-contained
way the main notions, theorems and techniques of so-called ordinary diﬀerential
equations. After explaining the basic principles underlying the theory we review
the essential methods for solving several types of equations. We tackle existence
and uniqueness issues for a solution to the initial value problem of a vectorial
equation, then describe the structure of solutions of linear systems, for which
algebraic methods play a central role, and equations of order higher than one. In
the end the reader will ﬁnd a concise introduction to asymptotic stability, with
applications to pendulum motion, with and without damping.
Due to the matter’s richness and complexity, this exposition is far from ex-
haustive and will concentrate on the qualitative aspects especially, keeping rigorous
arguments to a minimum1.
10.1 Introductory examples
The reader will presumably be already familiar with diﬀerential equation that
formalise certain physical principles, like Newton’s law of motion. Diﬀerential
equations are natural tools, hence widely employed to build mathematical mod-
els describing phenomena and processes of the real world. The reason is that
two quantities (the variables) often interact by aﬀecting one another’s variation,
which is expressed by a relationship between one variable and some derivative of
the other. Newton’s law, for instance, states that a force inﬂuences a particle’s ac-
celeration, i.e., the change of its velocity in time; and velocity itself is the variation
of displacement. If the force is a function of the particle’s position, as happens in
the case of a spring, we obtain an equation of motion in terms of time t

10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
md2x
dt2 = −kx ;
what this says is that the spring’s pulling force is proportional to the displacement,
and acts against motion (k > 0). A more complicated example is
md2x
dt2 = −(k + βx2)x ,
where the spring’s rigidity is enhanced by an increase of the displacement; both
these are diﬀerential equations of second order in the variable t. Another ex-
ample originating from classical Mechanics, that will accompany us throughout
the chapter, is that of a pendulum swinging freely on a vertical plane under the
eﬀect of gravity and possibly some friction. The relationship between the angle θ
swept by the rod and the bob’s angular velocity and acceleration reads
d2θ
dt2 + αdθ
dt + k sin θ = 0 .
Multiple mass-spring systems, or compound pendulums, are governed by systems
of diﬀerential equations correlating the positions of the various masses involved,
or the angles of the rods forming the pendulum.
The diﬀerential equations of concern, like all those treated in the chapter,
are ordinary, which means the unknowns depend upon one independent variable,
conventionally called t (the prevailing applications are dynamical, of evolution
type, so t is time). Partial diﬀerential equations, instead, entail unknown functions
of several variables (like time and space coordinates), and consequently also partial
derivatives.
Ordinary diﬀerential equations and systems are fundamental to explain how
electric and electronic circuits work. The simplest situation is that of an LRC
circuit, where the current i = i(t) satisﬁes a linear equation of second order of the
type
ℓd2i
dt2 + r di
dt + i
c = f .
Electric networks can be modelled by systems of as many of the above equations
as the number of loops, to which one adds suitable conservation laws at the nodes
(Kirchhoﬀ’s laws). For electronic circuits with active components, diﬀerential mod-
els are typically non-linear.
Materials Sciences, Chemistry, Biology, and more generally Life and Social Sci-
ences, are all fertile sources of mathematical models based on ordinary diﬀerential
equations. For instance,
y′ = ky

10.1 Introductory examples
423
describes the radioactive decay of a substance y (the rate of disappearance is pro-
portional, for k < 0, to the quantity of matter itself). But the same equation
regulates the dynamics of populations (called in this case Malthus’ law, it predicts
that the rate of growth y′/y of a population in time equals the diﬀerence k = n−m
between the constant birth rate n and death rate m). Malthus’ model becomes real-
istic by further assuming k is corrected by a braking term that prevents unlimited
growth, via the so-called logistic growth equation
y′ = (k −βy)y .
Another example are the Volterra-Lotka equations
 p′
1 = (k1 −β1p2)p1
p′
2 = (−k2 + β2p1)p2 ,
that preside over the interactions of two species, labelled preys p1 and predators p2,
whose relative change rates p′
i/pi are functions not only of the species’ respective
features (k1, k2 > 0), but also of the number of antagonist individuals present on
the territory (β1, β2 > 0).
At last, we mention a source – intrinsic, so to say, to diﬀerential modelling – of
very large systems of diﬀerential equations: the discretisation with respect to the
spatial variables of partial diﬀerential equations describing evolution phenomena.
A straightforward example is the heat equation
∂u
∂t −k ∂2u
∂x2 = 0 ,
0 < x < L , t > 0 ,
(10.1)
controlling the termperature u = u(t) of a metal bar of length L in time. Dividing
the bar in n + 1 parts of width Δx by points xj = jΔx, 0 ≤j ≤n + 1 (with
(n + 1)Δx = L), we can associate to each node the variable uj = uj(t) telling
how the temperature at xj changes in time. Using Taylor expansions, the second
spatial derivative can be approximated by a diﬀerence quotient
∂2u
∂x2 (xj, t) ∼uj−1(t) −2uj(t) + uj+1(t)
Δx2
,
so equation (10.1) is well approximated by a system of n linear ordinary diﬀerential
equations, one for each internal node:
u′
j −
k
Δx2 (uj−1 −2uj + uj+1) = 0 ,
1 ≤j ≤n .
The ﬁrst and last equation of the system contain the temperatures u0 and un+1 at
the bar’s ends, which can be ﬁxed by suitable boundary conditions (e.g., u0(t) = φ,
un+1(t) = ψ if the temperatures at the ends are kept constant by thermostats).

10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
10.2 General deﬁnitions
We introduce ﬁrst of all ‘scalar’ diﬀerential equations (those with one unknown),
for the beneﬁt of readers who have not seen them in other courses.
An ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE is the standard acronym) is a
relationship between a real independent variable (here, t), an unknown function
y = y(t), and the derivatives y(k) up to order n
F(t, y, y′, ..., y(n)) = 0,
(10.2)
where F is a real map of n + 2 real variables. The diﬀerential equation has order
n, if n is the highest order of the derivatives of y appearing in (10.2). A solution
(in the classical sense) of the diﬀerential equation on the real interval J is a map
y : J →R, diﬀerentiable n times on J, such that
F(t, y(t), y′(t), ..., y(n)(t)) = 0
for all t ∈J.
Using (10.2) it is often useful to write the highest derivative y(n) in terms of
t and the other derivatives (in several applications this is precisely the way a dif-
ferential equation is typically written). In general, the Implicit Function Theorem
(Sect. 7.1) makes sure that equation (10.2) can be solved for y(n) when the partial
derivative of F in the last variable is non-zero. If so, (10.2) reads
y(n) = f(t, y, ..., y(n−1)),
(10.3)
with f a real map of n+1 real variables. Then one says the diﬀerential equation is
in normal form. The deﬁnition of solution for normal ODEs changes accordingly.
As the warm-up examples have shown, beside single equations also systems of
diﬀerential equations are certainly worth studying. The simplest instance is that
of a system of order one in n unknowns, written in normal form as

(10.4)
where fi is a function of n + 1 variables. The vectorial notation
y′ = f(t, y)
(10.5)
where y = (yi)1≤i≤n and f = (fi)1≤i≤n is quite convenient. A solution is now
understood as a vector-valued map y : J →Rn, diﬀerentiable on J and satisfying

for all t ∈J .

1≤i≤n is a map from J to Rn. First-order linear equa-
tions play a particularly important role, both theoretically and in view of the
applications: on one hand, they describe many problems that are linear in nature,
on the other hand they approximate more complicated, non-linear equations by a
linearisation process (see Remark 10.25).
In writing a diﬀerential equation like (10.5) or (10.6), it is customary not to
write the t-dependency of the solution y explicitly.
Systems of ﬁrst order are the main focus of our study, because they capture
many types of diﬀerential equations provided one adds the necessary number of
unknowns. Each diﬀerential equation of order n can be indeed written as a system
of order one in n unknonws. To be precise, given equation (10.3), set
yi = y(i−1) ,
1 ≤i ≤n ,
i.e.,
y1 = y(0) = y
y2 = y′ = y′
1
y3 = y′′ = (y′)′ = y′

yn = y(n−1) = (y(n−2))′ = y′

10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
It is clear that any solution of equation (10.3) generates a solution y of the system,
by (10.7); conversely, if y solves the system, it is easy to convince ourselves the
ﬁrst component y1 is a solution of the equation. System (10.8) is then equivalent
to equation (10.3).
The generalisation of (10.4) is a system of n diﬀerential equations in n un-
knonws, where each equation has order greater or equal than 1. Every equation of
order at least two transforms into a system of ﬁrst order. Altogether, then, we can
always reduce to a system of order one in m ≥n equations and unknonws.
Let us go back to equation (10.5), and suppose it is deﬁned on the open set
Ω = I × D ⊆Rn+1, where I ⊆R is open and D ⊆Rn open, connected; assume
further f is continuous on Ω.
Deﬁnition 10.1 A solution of the diﬀerential equation (10.5) is a C1 func-
tion y = y(t) : J →D, with J a non-empty open interval in I, such that
y′(t) = f

t, y(t)

, ∀t ∈J.
We remark that a solution may not be deﬁned on the entire I.
A solution y(t) is therefore a diﬀerentiable curve deﬁned on J with trace con-
tained in D. The vector f

t∗, y(t∗)

, when not 0, is tangent to the curve at each
point t∗∈J.
The graph of y(t)

10.2 General deﬁnitions
427
The diﬀerential equation has, in general, inﬁnitely many solutions. Typically
these depend, apart from t, upon n arbitrary constants c1, . . . , cn. We indicate
with y(t; c1, . . . , cn) the set of solutions, which is called general integral.
A natural way to select a special solution is to impose that this solution takes
at the time t0 ∈I a given value y0 ∈D. We thus consider the problem of ﬁnding
y = y(t) such that
 y′ = f(t, y)
in J ,
y(t0) = y0 ,
(10.9)
where J is an open sub-interval of I containing t0. Since J in general depends on the
solution, it cannot be determined a priori. This kind of question is called Cauchy
problem for the diﬀerential equation, or initial value problem because it models
the temporal evolution of a physical system, which at t0, the initial moment of the
mathematical simulation, is in the conﬁguration y0. Geometrically speaking, the
condition at time t0 is equivalent to asking that the integral curve pass through the
point (t0, y0) ∈Ω. A Cauchy problem may be solvable locally (on a neighbourhood
J of t0), or globally (J = I, in which case one speaks of a global solution); these
two situations will be treated in Sects. 10.4.1 and 10.4.3, respectively.
A particularly important class of ODEs is that of autonomous equations
y′ = f(y) ,
for which f does not depend explicitly on t. The linear system
y′ = Ay
with given A ∈Rn.n, is one such example, and will be studied in Sect. 10.6. For
autonomous ODEs, the structure of solutions can be analysed by looking at their
traces in the open set D ⊆Rn. The space Rn then represents the phase space of
the equation.
The projection of an integral curve on the phase space (Fig. 10.2)
Γ(y) =

y(t) ∈D : t ∈J

is called an orbit or trajectory of the solution y. A solution y of the Cauchy
problem (10.9) deﬁnes an orbit passing through y0, which consists of a past tra-
jectory (t < t0) and a future trajectory (t > t0). The orbit is closed if it is closed
viewed as trace of y. Conventionally an orbit in phase space is pictured by the
streamline of the ﬂow, and the orientation on it describes the generating solution’s
evolution.
Application: the simple pendulum (I). The simple (gravity) pendulum is the
idealised model of a mass m (the bob) ﬁxed to the end of a massless rod of length L
suspended from a pivot (the point O). When given an initial push, the pendulum

swings back and forth on a vertical plane, and the bob describes a circle with
centre O and radius L (Fig. 10.3). In absence of external forces, e.g., air drag or
friction of sorts, the bob is subject to the force of gravity g, a vector lying on the
ﬁxed plane of motion and pointing downwards. To describe the motion of m, we
use polar coordinates (r,θ ) for the point P on the plane where m belongs: the
pole is O and the unit vector i = (cos 0, sin 0) is vertical and heads downwards; let
tr = tr(θ), tθ = tθ(θ) be the orthonormal frame, as of (6.31).
The position of P in time is given by the vector OP (t) = Ltr(θ(t)), itself

notice that the mass does not appear anywhere in the formula.
A mathematically more realistic model takes into account the deceleration
generated by a damping force at the point O: this will be proportional but opposite
to the velocity, and given by the vector
a = −αmL dθ
dt tθ ,
with α > 0 ,
adding to g in Newton’s equation. As previously, the equation of motion (10.11)

(10.12)
An ideal (free, undamped) motion is subsumed by taking α = 0, so we shall
suppose from now on α ≥0 and k > 0.
To ﬁnd the position of P at time t, we ﬁrst need to know its position and
velocity at the starting time, say t0 = 0. Let us then declare θ0 = θ(0) and
θ1 = dθ
dt (0), which, in essence, is the statement of an initial value problem for an
equation of order two:

10.3 Equations of ﬁrst order
Before we undertake the systematic study of diﬀerential equations of order n,
we examine a few types of ﬁrst-order ODEs that stand out, in that they can be
reduced to the computation of primitive maps.
10.3.1 Equations with separable variables
One speaks of separable variables (or of a separable ODE) for equations of the
following sort
y′ = g(t)h(y),
(10.14)
where g is continuous in t and h continuous in y. This means the function f(t, y)
is a product of a map depending only on t and a map depending only on y, so that
the variables are ‘separate’.
If ¯y ∈R is a zero of h, h(¯y) = 0, the constant map y(t) = ¯y is a particular
integral of (10.14), for the equation becomes 0 = 0. Therefore a separable ODE
has, ﬁrst of all, as many integrals y(t) = constant as the number of the distinct
roots of h. These are called singular integrals of the equation.
On every interval J where h(y) does not vanish we can write (10.14) as
1
h(y)
dy
dt = g(t) .
Let H(y) be a primitive of
1
h(y) (with respect to y). The formula for diﬀerentiating
composite functions gives
d
dtH(y(t)) = dH
dy
dy
dt =
1
h(y)
dy
dt = g(t) ,
whence H(y(t)) is a primitive of g(t). Thus, given any primitive G(t) of g(t) we
will have
H(y(t)) = G(t) + c ,
c ∈R .
(10.15)
But since
1
h(y) = dH
dy never vanishes on J by assumption – and thus does not
change sign, being continuous – the map H(y) will be strictly monotone on J,

10.3 Equations of ﬁrst order
431
hence invertible (Vol. I, Thm. 2.8). This implies we may solve (10.15) for y(t), to
get
y(t) = H−1(G(t) + c),
(10.16)
where H−1 is the inverse of H. The above is the general integral of (10.14) on
every interval where h(y(t)) is not zero. But, should we not be able to attain the
analytic expression of H−1(x), formula (10.16) would have a paltry theoretical
meaning. In such an event one is entitled to stop at the implicit form (10.15).
If equation (10.14) admits singular integrals, these might be of the form (10.16)
for suitable constants c. Certain singular integrals can be inferred formally from
(10.16) letting c tend to ±∞.
One recovers expression (10.15) in a formal and easy-to-remember manner
by interpreting the derivative dy
dt as a ‘quotient’, in Leibniz’s notation. In fact,
dividing (10.14) by h(y) and ‘multiplying’ by dt gives
dy
h(y) = g(t) dt ,
which can be then integrated

dy
h(y) =

g(t) dt.
This corresponds exactly to (10.15). At any rate the reader must not forget that
the correct proof of the formula is the aforementioned one!
Examples 10.2
i) Let us solve y′ = y(1 −y). If we set g(t) = 1 and h(y) = y(1 −y), the zeroes
of h determine two singular integrals y1(t) = 0 and y2(t) = 1. Next, assuming
h(y) diﬀerent from 0, we rewrite the equation as

dy
y(1 −y) =

dt,
then integrate with respect to y on the left and t on the right to obtain
log

y
1 −y
 = t + c
Exponentiating yields

y
1 −y
 = et+c = ket,
where k = ec is an arbitrary constant > 0. Therefore
y
1 −y = ±ket = Ket,

432
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
with K being any non-zero constant. Solving now for y in terms of t gives
y(t) =
Ket
1 + Ket .
In this case the singular integral y1(t) = 0 belongs to the above family of solutions
for K = 0, a value originally excluded. The other integral y2(t) = 1 arises
formally by taking the limit, for K going to inﬁnity, in the general expression.
ii) Consider the ODE
y′ = √y.
It has a singular integral y1(t) = 0. Separating variables gives

dy
√y =

dt ,
so
2√y = t + c ,
i.e.,
y(t) =
	 t
2 + c

2
,
c ∈R ,
where we have written c in place of c/2.
iii) The diﬀerential equation
y′ = et + 1
ey + 1
has g(t) = et + 1, h(y) =
1
ey + 1 > 0 for any y, so there are no singular integrals.
The separating recipe gives

(ey + 1) dy =

(et + 1) dt ,
so
ey + y = et + t + c ,
c ∈R .
But now we are forced to stop for it is not possible to explicitly write y as
function of the variable t.
2
10.3.2 Homogeneous equations
Homogeneous are ODEs of the type
y′ = ϕ
y
t

(10.17)
with ϕ = ϕ(z) continuous in z. The map f(t, y) depends on t and y in terms of
their ratio y
t only; equivalently, f(λt,λy ) = f(t, y) for any λ ̸= 0.
A homogeneous equation can be transformed into one with separable variables
by the obvious substitution z = y
t , understood as z(t) = y(t)
t . Then y(t) = tz(t)
and y′(t) = z(t) + tz′(t), so (10.17) becomes
z′ = ϕ(z) −z
t
,

10.3 Equations of ﬁrst order
433
which has separable variables z and t, as required. The technique of Section 10.3.1
solves it: each solution ¯z of ϕ(z) = z gives rise to a singular integral z(t) = ¯z,
hence y(t) = ¯zt. Assuming ϕ(z) diﬀerent from z, instead, we have

dz
ϕ(z) −z =
 dt
t ,
giving
H(z) = log |t| + c
where H(z) is a primitive of
1
ϕ(z) −z . Indicating by H−1 the inverse function, we
have
z(t) = H−1(log |t| + c),
hence, returning to y, the general integral of (10.17) reads
y(t) = t H−1(log |t| + c).
Example 10.3
We solve
t2y′ = y2 + ty + t2.
(10.18)
In normal form, this is
y′ =
y
t
2
+ y
t + 1,
a homogeneous equation with ϕ(z) = z2+z+1. The substitution y = tz generates
a separable equation
z′ = z2 + 1
t
.
There are no singular integrals, for z2 + 1 is always positive. Integration gives
arctan z = log |t| + c
so the general integral of (10.18) is
y(t) = t tan(log |t| + c).
The constant c can be chosen independently in (−∞, 0) and (0, +∞), because
of the singularity at t = 0. Notice also that the domain of each solution depends
on the value of c.
2
10.3.3 Linear equations
The diﬀerential equation
y′ = a(t)y + b(t)
(10.19)

434
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
with a, b continuous on I, is called linear.2 The map f(t, y) = a(t)y + b(t) is
a polynomial of degree one in y with coeﬃcients dependent on t. The equation
is called homogeneous if the source term vanishes identically, b(t) = 0, non-
homogeneous otherwise.
Let us start by solving the homogeneous equation
y′ = a(t)y.
(10.20)
It is a special case of equation with separable variables where g(t) = a(t) and
h(y) = y, see (10.14). Therefore the constant map y(t) = 0 is a solution. Apart
from that, we can separate variables
 1
y dy =

a(t) dt.
If A(t) indicates a primitive of a(t), i.e., if

a(t) dt = A(t) + c,
c ∈R,
(10.21)
then
log |y| = A(t) + c ,
or equivalently
|y(t)| = eceA(t) ,
so
y(t) = ±KeA(t),
where K = ec > 0. The particular solution y(t) = 0 is subsumed by the gen-
eral formula if we let K be 0. Therefore the solutions of the homogeneous linear
equation (10.20) are given by
y(t) = KeA(t),
K ∈R,
with A(t) as in (10.21).
Now we tackle the non-homogeneous case. We use the so-called method of
variation of constants, or parameters, which consists in searching for solutions of
the form
y(t) = K(t) eA(t),
where now K(t) is a function to be determined. The representation of y(t) is always
possible, for eA(t) > 0. Substituting into (10.19), we obtain
K′(t)eA(t) + K(t)eA(t)a(t) = a(t)K(t)eA(t) + b(t),
so
K′(t) = e−A(t)b(t).
2 Contrary to the description of Vol. I, here we prefer to write the linear term y on the
right, to be consistent with the theory of linear systems.

10.3 Equations of ﬁrst order
435
Calling B(t) a primitive of e−A(t)b(t),

e−A(t)b(t) dt = B(t) + c,
c ∈R,
(10.22)
we have
K(t) = B(t) + c,
so the general solution to (10.19) is
y(t) = eA(t)
B(t) + c

,
(10.23)
with A(t) and B(t) deﬁned by (10.21) and (10.22). The integral is more often than
not found in the form
y(t) = e

a(t) dt

e−

a(t) dt b(t) dt,
(10.24)
where the steps leading to the solution are clearly spelt out, namely: one has to
integrate twice in succession.
If we want to solve the Cauchy problem
 y′ = a(t)y + b(t)
on the interval I,
y(t0) = y0,
with t0 ∈I and y0 ∈R,
(10.25)
it might be convenient to choose as primitive of a(t) the one vanishing at t0, which
we write A(t) =
 t
t0
a(s) ds, according to the Fundamental Theorem of Integral
Calculus; the same can be done for B(t) by putting
B(t) =
 t
t0
e−
 s
t0 a(u) du b(s) ds
(recall that the variables in the deﬁnite integral are arbitrary symbols). Using these
expressions for A(t) and B(t) in (10.23) we obtain y(t0) = c, hence the solution of
the Cauchy problem (10.25) will satisfy c = y0, i.e.,
y(t) = e

i) Find the general integral of the linear equation
y′ = ay + b,
where a ̸= 0 and b are real numbers.

436
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
Choosing A(t) = at and B(t) = −b
ae−at generates the integral
y(t) = ceat −b
a.
If a = 1 and b = 0, the formula shows that all solutions of y′ = y come in the
form y(t) = cet.
If we want to solve the Cauchy problem
!
y′ = ay + b
on [1, +∞),
y(1) = y0,
it is better to choose A(t) = a(t −1) and B(t) = b
a

1 −e−a(t−1)
, so that
y(t) =
	
y0 + b
a

ea(t−1) −b
a.
In case a < 0, the solution converges to −b/a (independent of the initial datum
y0) as t →+∞.
ii) We ﬁnd the integral curves of the ODE
ty′ + y = t2
that lie in the ﬁrst quadrant of the plane (t, y). Written as (10.19), the equation
is
y′ = −1
t y + t,
so a(t) = −1/t, b(t) = t. Choose A(t) = −log t, and then eA(t) = 1/t, e−A(t) = t;
consequently,

e−A(t)b(t) dt =

t2 dt = 1
3t3 + c.
Therefore for t > 0, the general integral reads
y(t) = 1
t
	1
3t3 + c

t .
If c ≥0, then y(t) > 0 for any t > 0, while if c < 0, y(t) > 0 when t >
3
3|c|. 2
Remark 10.5 In the sequel it will turn out useful to consider linear equations of
the form
z′ = λz ,
(10.27)
where λ is a complex number. We should determine the solution over the complex
ﬁeld: this will be a diﬀerentiable map z = Re z + i Im z : R →C (i.e., its real and
imaginary parts are diﬀerentiable). Recall that the equation
d
dt eλt = λ eλt ,
t ∈R
(10.28)

10.3 Equations of ﬁrst order
437
(proved in Vol. I, Eq. (11.30)) is still valid for λ ∈C. Then we can say that any
solution of (10.27) can be written as
z(t) = c eλt
(10.29)
with c ∈C arbitrary.
2
10.3.4 Bernoulli equations
This family of equations is characterised by the following form
y′ = p(t)yα + q(t)y , α
̸= 0, α ̸= 1 ,
(10.30)
with p, q continuous on I. If α > 0, the constant map 0 is a solution. Supposing
then y ̸= 0 and dividing by yα gives
y−αy′ = p(t) + q(t)y1−α .
As (y1−α)′ = (1 −α)y−αy′, the substitution z = y1−α transforms the equation
into a linear equation in z
z′ = (1 −α)p(t) + (1 −α)q(t)z ,
solvable by earlier methods.
Example 10.6
Take y′ = t3y2 + 2ty, a Bernoulli equation where p(t) = t3, q(t) = 2t and α = 2.
The transformation suggested above reduces the equation to z′ = −(2tz + t3),
solved by z(t) = cet2 −(2 + t2). Hence
y(t) =
1
cet2 −(2 + t2)
solves the original equation.
2
10.3.5 Riccati equations
Equations of Riccati type crop up in optimal control problems, and have the typical
form
y′ = p(t)y2 + q(t)y + r(t) ,
(10.31)
where p, q, r are continuous on I. The general integral can be found provided we
know a particular integral y = u(t). In fact, putting
y = u(t) + 1
z ,
hence
y′ = u′(t) −z′
z2 ,

438
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
we obtain
u′(t) −z′
z2 = p(t)

u2(t) + 2u(t)
z
+ 1
z2

+ q(t)

u(t) + 1
z

+ r(t) .
Since u is a solution, this simpliﬁes to
z′ = −

2u(t)p(t) + q(t)

z −p(t) ,
and once again we recover a linear equation in the unknown z.
Example 10.7
Consider the Riccati equation
y′ = ty2 +
	1 −2t2
t

y + t2 −1
t
,
where
p(t) = t ,
q(t) = 1 −2t2
t
,
r(t) = t2 −1
t
.
There is a particular solution u(t) = 1. The aforementioned change of variables
gives
z′ = −z
t −t ,
solved by
z(t) = c −t3
3|t| .
It follows the solution is
y(t) = 1 +
3|t|
c −t3 ,
c ∈R .
2
10.3.6 Second-order equations reducible to ﬁrst order
When a diﬀerential equation of order two does not explicitly contain the dependent
variable, as in
y′′ = f(t, y′) ,
(10.32)
the substitution z = y′ leads to the equation of order one
z′ = f(t, z)
in z = z(t). If the latter has a general integral z(t; c1), all solutions of (10.32) arise
from
y′ = z ,

10.3 Equations of ﬁrst order
439
hence from the primitives of z(t; c1). This introduces another integration constant
c2. The general integral of (10.32) is thus
y(t; c1, c2) =

z(t; c1) dt = Z(t; c1) + c2,
where Z(t; c1) is a particular primitive of z(t; c1).
Example 10.8
Solve the second-order equation
y′′ −(y′)2 = 1.
Set z = y′ to obtain the separable ODE
z′ = z2 + 1.
The general integral is arctan z = t + c1, so
z(t, c1) = tan(t + c1).
Integrating again gives
y(t; c1, c2) =

tan(t + c1) dt = −log

cos(t + c1)

+ c2 ,
c1, c2 ∈R .
2
Consider, at last, a second-order autonomous equation
y′′ = f(y, y′) .
(10.33)
We shall indicate a method for each interval I ⊆R where y′(t) has constant sign.
In such case y(t) is strictly monotone, so invertible; we may consider therefore
t = t(y) as function of y on J = y(I), and consequently everything will depend on
y as well; in particular, z = dy
dt should be thought of as map in y. Then
y′′ = dz
dt = dz
dy
dy
dt = dz
dy z ,
whereby y′′ = f(y, z) becomes
dz
dy = g(y, z) = 1
z f(y, z) .
This is of order one, y being the independent variable and z the unknown. Sup-
posing we are capable of ﬁnding all its solutions z = z(y; c1), the solutions y(t)
arise from the autonomous equation of order one
dy
dt = z(y; c1) ,
coming from the deﬁnition of t.

Set f(y, z) = z2

dy = g(y, z) = z
y .
This gives z(y) = c1y, and then
dy
dt = c1y ,
whence y(t) = c2ec1t, c2 ̸= 0.

10.4 The Cauchy problem
We return to diﬀerential equations in their most general form (10.5) and discuss
the solvability of the Cauchy problem.
As in Sect. 10.2, let I ⊆R be an open interval and D ⊆Rn an open connected
set. Call Ω = I × D ⊆Rn+1, and take a map f : Ω →Rn deﬁned on Ω. Given
points t0 in I and y0 in D, we examine the Cauchy problem
 y′ = f(t, y) ,
y(t0) = y0 .
(10.34)
10.4.1 Local existence and uniqueness
Step one of our study is to determine conditions on f that guarantee the Cauchy
problem can be solved locally, by which we mean on a neighbourhood of t0.
It is remarkable that the continuity of f alone, in t and y simultaneously, is
enough to ensure the existence of a solution, as the next result, known as Peano’s
Existence Theorem, proves.
Theorem 10.10 (Peano) Suppose f is continuous on Ω. Then there exist
a closed neighbourhood [t0 −α, t0+α] of t0 and a map y : [t0 −α, t0 +α] →D,
diﬀerentiable with continuity, that solves the Cauchy problem (10.34).
There is a way of estimating the size of the interval where the solution exists.
Let Ba(t0) and Bb(y0) be neighbourhoods of t0 and y0 such that the compact set
K = Ba(t0) × Bb(y0) is contained in Ω, and set M =
max
(t,y)∈K ∥f(t, y)∥. Then the
theorem holds with α = min(a, b/M).

10.4 The Cauchy problem
441
Peano’s Theorem does not claim anything on the solution’s uniqueness, and in
fact the mere continuity of f does not prevent to have inﬁnitely many solutions
to (10.34).
Example 10.11
The initial value problem
!
y′ = 3
2
3√y ,
y(0) = 0 ,
solvable by separating variables, admits solutions y(t) = 0 (the singular integral)
and y(t) =
√
t3; actually, there are inﬁnitely many solutions, some of which
y(t) = yα(t) =
 0
if t ≤α ,

(t −α)3
if t > α ,
α ≥0 ,
are obtained by ‘glueing’ the previous two in a suitable way (Fig. 10.4).
2
That is why we need to add further hypotheses in order to grant uniqueness,
besides requiring the solution depend continuously on the initial datum.
A very common assumption is this one:
Deﬁnition 10.12 A map f deﬁned on Ω = I × D is said Lipschitz in y,
uniformly in t, over Ω, if there exists a constant L ≥0 such that
∥f(t, y1) −f(t, y2)∥≤L∥y1 −y2∥,
∀y1, y2 ∈D, ∀t ∈I .

10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
Using Proposition 6.4 for every t ∈I, it is easy to see that a map is Lipschitz if
all its components admit bounded yj-derivatives on Ω:


∂fi

 < +∞,
1 ≤i, j ≤n .
Examples 10.13
i) Let us consider the function f(t, y) = y2, deﬁned and continuous on R × R.
Then ∀y1, y2 ∈R and ∀t ∈R,
|f(t, y1) = f(t, y2)| = |y2
1 −y2
2| = |y1 + y2| |y1 −y2| .
Hence f is Lipschitz in the variable y, uniformly in t, on every domain Ω =
ΩR = R × DR with DR = (−R, R), R > 0; the corresponding Lipschitz constant
L = LR equals LR = 2R. Note that the function is not Lipschitz on R × R,
because |y1 + y2| tends to +∞as y1 and y2 tend to inﬁnity with the same sign.
ii) Consider now the map f(t, y) = sin(ty), deﬁned and continuous on R × R. It
satisﬁes
| sin(ty1) −sin(ty2)| ≤|(ty1) −(ty2)| = |t| |y1 −y2| ,
∀y1, y2 ∈R, ∀t ∈R, because θ →sin θ is Lipschitz on R with constant 1.
Therefore f is Lipschitz in y, uniformly in t, on every region Ω = ΩR = IR × R,
with IR = (−R, R), R > 0, with Lipschitz constant L = LR = R. Again, f is
not Lipschitz on the whole R × R.
iii) Finally, let us consider the aﬃne map f(t, y) = A(t)y + b(t), where A(t) ∈
Rn,n, b(t) ∈Rn are deﬁned and continuous on the open interval I ⊆R. Then f
is deﬁned and continuous on I × Rn. For any y1, y2 ∈Rn and any t ∈I, we have
∥f(t, y1) −f(t, y2)∥= ∥A(t)y1 −A(t)y2∥
= ∥A(t)(y1 −y2)∥≤∥A(t)∥∥y1 −y2∥,
where ∥A(t)∥is the norm of the matrix A(t) deﬁned in (4.9), and the inequality
follows from (4.10). Observe that the map α(t) = ∥A(t)∥is continuous on I (as
composite of continuous maps). If α is bounded, f is Lipschitz in y, uniformly
in t on Ω = I × R, with Lipschitz constant L = supt∈I α(t). If not, we can at
least say α is bounded on every closed and bounded interval J ⊂I (Weierstrass’
Theorem), so f is Lipschitz on every Ω = J × Rn.
2
The next result is of paramount importance. It is known as the Theorem of
Cauchy-Lipschitz (or Picard-Lindel¨of).
Theorem 10.14 (Cauchy-Lipschitz) Let f(t, y) be continuous on Ω and
Lipschitz in y, uniformly in t. Then the Cauchy problem (10.34) admits one,
and only one, solution y = y(t) deﬁned on a closed neighbourhood [t0−α, t0+
α] of t0, with values in Ω, and diﬀerentiable with continuity on Ω.

 z′ = f(t, z) ,
z(t0) = z0 ,
over an interval J containing t0, for given y0 and z0 ∈D. Then
∥y(t) −z(t)∥≤eL|t−t0|∥y0 −z0∥,
∀t ∈J .
(10.36)
In particular, if z0 = y0, z coincides with y on J.
What the property is saying is that the solution of (10.34) depends in a continuous
way upon the initial datum y0: a small deformation ε of the initial datum perturbs
the solution at t ̸= t0 by eL|t−t0|ε at most. In other words, the distance between
two orbits at time t grows by a factor not larger than eL|t−t0|. Since this factor
is exponential, its magnitude depends on the distance |t −t0| as well as on the
Lipschitz constant of f.
For certain equations it is possible to replace eL|t−t0| with eσ(t−t0) if t > t0,
or eσ(t0−t) if t < t0, with σ < 0 (see Example 10.22 ii) and Sect. 10.8.1). In these
cases the solutions move towards one another exponentially.
Remark 10.16 Assume that a mathematical problem is formalised as
P(s) = d
where d is the datum and s the solution. Whenever s
•
exists for any datum d,
•
is unique, and

444
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
•
depends upon d with continuity,
the problem is said to be well posed (in the sense of Hadamard).
Theorem 10.14 and the subsequent proposition guarantee the Cauchy prob-
lem (10.34) is well posed with the assumptions made on f.
2
From the Theorem of Cauchy-Lipschitz we infer important consequences of
qualitative nature regarding the solution set of the diﬀerential equation. To be
precise, its hypotheses imply:
•
two integral curves with a common point must necessarily coincide (by unique-
ness of the solution on the neighbourhood of every common point);
•
for autonomous systems in particular, the orbits Γ(y), as y varies among
solutions, form a disjoint partition of phase space; it can be proved that an
orbit is closed if and only if the corresponding solution is periodic in time,
y(t + T ) = y(t), for all t ∈R and a suitable T > 0;
•
the solutions on Ω of the ODE depend on n real parameters, as anticipated
in Sect. 10.2: given any t0 ∈I, there is a distinct solution for every choice of
datum y0 on the open set D, and the coordinates c1 = y01, . . . , cn = y0n of y0
should be considered as the free parameters upon which the solution depends.
10.4.2 Maximal solutions
The Theorem of Cauchy-Lipschitz ensures the existence of a closed interval [t0 −
α, t0 + α], containing t0, where the problem (10.34) is solvable; we shall call u =
u(t) the corresponding solution henceforth. However, this interval might not be
the largest interval containing t0 where the problem can be solved (the maximal
interval of existence). In fact, suppose t1 = t0 + α lies inside I and y1 = u(t1) is
inside D. Then we can re-ignite the Cauchy problem at t1
 y′ = f(t, y) ,
y(t1) = y1 .
(10.37)
Because the assumptions of Theorem 10.14 are still valid, the new problem has a
unique solution v = v(t) deﬁned on an interval [t1 −β, t1 + β] ⊆I. Both functions
u, v solve the ODE and satisfy the condition u(t1) = y1 = v(t1) on the interval
J = [t0, t1] ∩[t1 −β, t1], which contains a left neighbourhood of t1 (see Fig. 10.6).
Therefore they must solve problem (10.37) on J. We can use inequality (10.36)
with t0 replaced by t1, to obtain
∥u(t) −v(t)∥≤eL|t1−t0|∥y1 −y1∥= 0 ,
∀t ∈J ;
that shows v must coincide with u on J. Since v is also deﬁned on the right of t1,
we may consider the prolongation
˜u(t) =
 u(t)
in [t0 −α, t0 + α] ,
v(t)
in [t0 + α, t0 + α + β] ,

that extends the previous solution to the interval [t0 −α, t0 + α + β]. A similar
prolongation to the left of t0 −α is possible if t0 −α is inside I and u(t0 −α) still
lies in D.
The procedure thus described may be iterated so that to prolong u to an open
interval Jmax = (t−, t+), where, by deﬁnition:
t−= inf{t∗∈I : problem (10.34) has a solution on [t∗, t0]}
and
t+ = sup{t∗∈I : problem (10.34) has a solution on [t0, t∗]} .
This determines precisely the maximal interval on which a solution u to prob-
lem (10.34) lives.
Suppose t+ is strictly less than the least upper bound of I (so that the solution
cannot be extended beyond t+, despite f is continuous and Lipschitz in y). Then

one could prove u(t) moves towards the boundary ∂D as t tends to t+ (from the
left), see Fig. 10.7. Similar considerations hold for t−.
Example 10.17
Consider the Cauchy problem
!
y′ = y2 ,
y(0) = y0 .
The Lipschitz character of f(t, y) = y2 was discussed in Example (10.13) i):
for any R > 0 we know f is Lipschitz on ΩR = R × DR, DR = (−R, R). The
problem’s solution is
y(t) =
y0
1 −y0t .
If y0 ∈DR, it is not hard to check that the maximal interval of existence in DR,
i.e., the set of t for which y(t) ∈DR, is

Notice that limt→t+ y(t) = R when y0 > 0, conﬁrming that the solution reaches
the boundary of DR as t →t+.

10.4.3 Global existence
We wish to ﬁnd conditions on f that force every solution of (10.34) to be deﬁned
on the whole interval I. A solution for which Jmax = I is said to exist globally,
and called a global solution.
The petty example of an autonomous system in dimension 1,
y′ = f(y) ,
is already suﬃcient to show the various possibilities. The map f(t, y) = f(y) =
ay + b is Lipschitz on all R × R, and the corresponding ODE’s solutions
y(t) = ceat −b
a
are deﬁned on R (see Example 10.4 i)). In contrast, f(t, y) = f(y) = y2 is not
Lipschitz on the entire R2 (Example 10.13 i)) and its non-zero solutions exist on
semi-bounded intervals (Example 10.17). The linear example is justiﬁed by the
following suﬃcient condition for global existence.
Theorem 10.18 Let Ω = I × Rn and assume Theorem 10.14 holds. Then
the solution of the Cauchy problem (10.34) is deﬁned everywhere on I.

10.4 The Cauchy problem
447
This result is coherent with the fact, remarked earlier, that if the supremum t+
of Jmax is not the supremum of I, the solution converges to the boundary of D,
as t →t+ (and analogously for t−). In the present situation D = Rn has empty
boundary, and therefore the end-points of Jmax must coincide with those of I.
Being globally Lipschitz imposes a severe limitation on the behaviour of f as
y →∞: f can grow, but not more than linearly. In fact if we choose y1 = y ∈Rn
arbitrarily, and y2 = 0 in (10.35), we deduce
∥f(t, y) −f(t, 0)∥≤L∥y∥,
∀y ∈Rn .
The triangle inequality then yields
∥f(t, y)∥= ∥f(t, 0) + f(t, y) −f(t, 0)∥
≤∥f(t, 0)∥+ ∥f(t, y) −f(t, 0)∥,
so necessarily
∥f(t, y)∥≤∥f(t, 0)∥+ L∥y∥,
y ∈Rn .
Observe that f continuous on Ω forces the map β(t) = ∥f(t, 0)∥to be continuous
on I.
Consider the autonomous equation
y′ = y log2 y ,
for which f(t, y) = f(y) = y log2 y grows slightly more than linearly as y →+∞.
The solutions
y(t) = e−1/(x+c)
are deﬁned over not all of R, showing that a growth that is at most linear is close
to being optimal. Still, we can achieve some level of generalisation in this direction.
We may attain the same result as Theorem 10.18, in fact, imposing that f
grows in y at most linearly, and weakening the Lipschitz condition on I × Rn;
precisely, it is enough to have f locally Lipschitz (in y) over Ω. Equivalently, f
is Lipschitz in y, uniformly in t, on every compact set K in Ω; if so, the Lipschitz
constant LK may depend on K. All maps considered in Examples 10.13 are indeed
locally Lipschitz (on R × R for the ﬁrst two examples, on I × Rn for the last).
Theorem 10.19 Let f be continuous and locally Lipschitz in y, uniformly
in t, over Ω = I × Rn; assume
∥f(t, y)∥≤α(t)∥y∥+ β(t) ,
∀y ∈Rn, ∀t ∈I .
(10.38)
with α,β continuous and non-negative on I. Then the solution to the Cauchy
problem (10.34) is deﬁned everywhere on I.
Moreover, if α and β are integrable on I (improperly, possibly), every solution
is bounded on I.

448
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
A crucial application regards linear systems.
Corollary 10.20 Let A(t) ∈Rn,n, b(t) ∈Rn be continuous on the open
interval I ⊆R. Then any solution of the system of ODEs
y′ = A(t)y + b(t)
is deﬁned on the entire I. In particular, the corresponding Cauchy prob-
lem (10.34) with arbitrary y0 ∈Rn admits one, and one only, solution over
all of I.
Proof.
The map f(t, y) = A(t)y + b(t) is locally Lipschitz on I × Rn, by Ex-
ample 10.13 iii). Following that argument,
∥f(t, y)∥≤∥A(t)∥∥y∥+ ∥b(t)∥,
∀y ∈Rn, ∀t ∈I ,
and α(t) = ∥A(t)∥, β(t) = ∥b(t)∥are continuous by hypothesis. The claim
follows from the previous theorem.
2
Application: the simple pendulum (II). Let us resume the example of p. 430.
The map f(y) has
Jf(y) =
	
0

so the Jacobian’s components are uniformly bounded on R2, for

∂fi

(y)
 ≤max(k,α) ,
∀y ∈R2 ,
1 ≤i, j ≤2 ;
then f is Lipschitz on the whole of R2. Theorems 10.14, 10.18 guarantee existence
and uniqueness for any (θ0, θ1) ∈R2, and the solution exists for all t > 0.
(Continues on p. 453.)

10.4.4 Global existence in the future
Many concrete applications require an ODE to be solved ‘in the future’, rather
than ‘in the past’: it is important, namely, to solve for all t > t0, and the aim is
to ensure the solution exists on some interval J bounded by t0 on the left (e.g.,
[t0, +∞)), whereas the solution for t < t0 is of no interest. The next result cashes
in on a special feature of f to warrant the global existence of the solution in the
future to an initial value problem.
A simple example will help us to understand. The autonomous problem

y′ = −y3 ,
y(0) = y0 ,

10.4 The Cauchy problem
449
is determined by f(y) = −y3: this is locally Lipschitz on R, and clearly grows faster
than a linear map as y →∞; therefore it does not fulﬁll the previous theorems,
as the solution
y(t) =
y0

1 + 2y2
0t
,
(10.39)
not deﬁned on the entire R, conﬁrms. Yet y exists on [0, +∞), whichever the initial
datum y0. The fact that the solution does not ‘blow up’, as t increases, can be
derived directly from the diﬀerential equation, even without solving. Just multiply
the ODE by y and observe
yy′ = 1
22y dy
dt = d
dt
	1
2y2

;
then
d
dt
	1
2y2

= −y4 ≤0 ,
i.e., the quantity E(y(t)) = 1
2|y(t)|2 is non-increasing as t grows. In particular,
1
2|y(t)|2 ≤1
2|y(0)|2 = 1
2|y0|2 ,
∀t ≥0 ,
so
|y(t)| ≤|y0| ,
∀t ≥0 .
At all ‘future’ instants the solution’s absolute value is bounded by the initial value,
which can also be established from the analytic expression (10.39).
The argument relies heavily on the sign of f(y) (ﬂipping from −y3 to +y3
invalidates the result); this property is not ‘seen’ by other conditions like (10.35)
or (10.38), which involve the norm of f(t, y).
This example is somehow generalised by a condition for global existence in the
future.
Proposition 10.21 Let f be continuous and locally Lipschitz in y, uniformly
in t, on Ω = I × Rn. If
y · f(t, y) ≤0 ,
∀y ∈Rn ,
∀t ∈I ,
(10.40)
the solution of the Cauchy problem (10.34) exists everywhere to the right of
t0, hence on J = I ∩[t0, +∞). Moreover, one has
∥y(t)∥≤∥y0∥,
∀t ∈J .
(10.41)
Proof.
Dot-multiply the ODE by y:
y · y′ = y · f(t, y) .

right end-point of I.

A few examples will shed light on (10.40).
Examples 10.22
i) Let y′ = Ay, with A a real skew-symmetric matrix, in other words A satisﬁes
AT = −A. Then
y · f(y) = y · Ay = 0 ,
∀y ∈Rn ,
because y · Ay = yT Ay = (Ay)T y = yT AT y = −yT Ay, so this quantity must
be zero. Hence
d
dt

2∥y∥2

= 0 ,
i.e., the map E(y(t)) = 1
2∥y(t)∥2 is constant in time. We call it a ﬁrst integral
of the diﬀerential equation, or an invariant of motion. The diﬀerential system is
called in this case conservative.
ii) Take y′ = −(Ay + g(y)), with A a symmetric, positive-deﬁnite matrix, and
g(y) of components

g(y)

i = φ(yi) ,
1 ≤i ≤n ,
where φ : R →R is continuous, φ(0) = 0 and sφ(s) ≥0, ∀s ∈R (e.g., φ(s) = s3
an in the initial discussion). Recalling (4.18), we have
y · f(y) = −(y · Ay + y · g(y)) ≤−y · Ay ≤−λ∗∥y∥2 ≤0 ,
∀y ∈Rn ,
with λ∗> 0. Setting as above E(y) = 1
2∥y∥2, one has
d
dt E(y(t)) ≤−λ∗∥y(t)∥2 ,
∀t > t0 ,
from which we deduce
E(y(t)) ≤e−2λ∗(t−t0)E(y0) ,
∀t > t0 ;
therefore E(y(t)) decays exponentially at t increases. Equivalently,
∥y(t)∥≤e−λ∗(t−t0)∥y0∥,
t > t0 ,
and all solutions converge exponentially to 0 as t →+∞. In Sect. 10.8 we shall
express this by saying the constant solution y = 0 is asymptotically uniformly
stable, and speak of a dissipative system.

10.4 The Cauchy problem
451
Assuming furthermore φ convex, one could prove that two solutions y, z starting
at y0, z0 satisfy
∥y(t) −z(t)∥≤e−λ∗(t−t0)∥y0 −z0∥,
t > t0 ,
a more accurate inequality than (10.36) for t > t0.
The map y →E(y) is an example of a Lyapunov function for the diﬀerential
system, relative to the origin. The name denotes any regular map V : B(0) →R,
where B(0) is a neighbourhood of the origin, satisfying
•

•

10.4.5 First integrals
Take an autonomous equation y′ = f(y), with Lipschitz f : D ⊆Rn →Rn.
Deﬁnition 10.23 A scalar map Φ : D →R is a ﬁrst integral of the
equation if Φ is constant along every orbit of the diﬀerential equation, i.e.,
Φ(y(t)) = constant
for every solution y(t) of the ODE.
A ﬁrst integral is naturally deﬁned up to an additive constant.
If the equation has a ﬁrst integral Φ, each orbit will be contained in a level set of
Φ. The study of level sets can then provide useful informations about the solution’s
global existence. For instance, if the orbit of a particular solution belongs to a level
set that does not touch the boundary of D, we can be sure the solution will exist
at any time.
Likewise, the study of the solutions’ asymptotic stability (see Sect. 10.8) could
proﬁt from what the level sets of a ﬁrst integral can tell.
To start with, consider the autonomous equation of order two
y′′ + g(y) = 0 ,
(10.42)
where g : R →R is C1. Such kind of equations play a paramount role in Mechanics
(read, Newton’s law of motion). Another incarnation is equation (10.11) regulating
a simple pendulum.
Let Π be an arbitrary primitive of g on R, so that dΠ
dy (y) = g(y) , ∀y ∈R. If
y = y(t) is a solution for t ∈J then, we can multiply (10.42) by y′, to get

452
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
Thus
E(y, y′) = 1
2 (y′)2 + Π(y)
is constant for any solution. One calls Π(y) the potential energy of the mechan-
ical system described by the equation, and K(y′) = 1
2(y′)2 is the kinetic energy.
The total energy E(y, y′) = K(y′) + Π(y) is therefore preserved during motion
(the work done equals the gain of kinetic energy).
The function E turns out to be a ﬁrst integral, in the sense of Deﬁnition 10.23,
for the autonomous vector equation y′ = f(y) given by
 y′
1 = y2
y′
2 = −g(y1) ,
(10.43)
equivalent to (10.42) by putting y1 = y, y2 = y′. In other words Φ(y) = E(y1, y2) =
1
2y2
2 + Π(y1), and we may study the level curves of Φ in phase space y1y2 to
understand the solutions’ behaviour. At the end of the section we will see an
example, the undamped pendulum.
Generalising this picture we may say that an autonomous equation y′ = f(y)
over a connected open set D of the plane admits inﬁnitely many ﬁrst integrals if
f is the curl of a scalar ﬁeld Φ on D, i.e., f(y) = curl Φ(y).
Property 10.24 Let Φ be a C1 ﬁeld on D ⊆R2. The equation
y′ = curl Φ
(10.44)
admits Φ as ﬁrst integral.
Proof.
If y = y(t) is a solution deﬁned for t ∈J, by the chain rule
d
dtΦ(y) = (grad Φ) · dy
dt = (grad Φ) · (curl Φ) = 0 ,
because gradient and curl are orthogonal in dimension two.
2
Bearing in mind Sect. 7.2.1 with regard to level cuves, equation (10.44) forces y
to move along a level curve of Φ.
By Sect. 9.6, a suﬃcient condition to have f = curl Φ is that f is divergence-
free on a simply connected, open set D. In the case treated at the beginning,
f(y) = (y2, −g(y1)) = curl E(y1, y2), and div f = 0 over all D = R2.
To conclude, equation (10.44) extends to dimension 2n, if y = (y1, y2) ∈
Rn × Rn = R2n is deﬁned by a system of 2n equations

where Φ is a map in 2n variables and each partial derivative symbol denotes the n
components of the gradient of Φ with respect to the indicated vectorial variable.
Such a system is called a Hamiltonian system, and the ﬁrst integral Φ is known
as a Hamiltonian (function) of the system. An example, that generalises (10.42),
is provided by the equation of motion of n bodies
z′′ + grad Π(z) = 0 ,
z ∈Rn ,
(10.46)
with Π a function of n variables. Proceeding as for n = 1 we can transform the
second-order equation into a system of order one like (10.45). The Hamiltonian Φ
is the total energy Φ(y1, y2) = E(z, z′) = 1
2∥z′∥2 + Π(z) of the system.
When D = Rn, it can be proved that the ODE’s solutions are deﬁned at all
times if the potential energy is bounded from below.
Application: the simple pendulum (III). The example continues from p. 448.
The simple pendulum (α = 0) is governed by
dθ2
dt2 + k sin θ = 0 .
The equation is of type (10.42), with g(θ) = k sin θ; therefore the potential energy
is Π(θ) = c−k cos θ, with arbitrary constant c. It is certainly bounded from below,
conﬁrming the solutions’ existence at any instant of time t ∈R. The customary
choice c = k makes the potential energy vanish when θ = 2πℓ, ℓ∈Z, in corres-
pondence with the lowest point S of the bob, and maximises Π(θ) = 2k > 0 for
θ = (2ℓ+ 1)π, ℓ∈Z, when the highest point I is reached. With that choice the
total energy is
E(θ,θ ′) = 1

or
E(y1, y2) = 1
2y2
2 + k(1 −cos y1)
(10.47)
in the phase space of coordinates y1 = θ, y2 = θ′. Let us examine this map on R2:
it is always ≥0 and vanishes at (2πℓ,0), ℓ∈Z, which are thus absolute minima:
the pendulum is still in the position S. The gradient ∇E(y1, y2) = (k sin y1, y2) is
zero at (πℓ,0), ℓ∈Z, so we have additional stationary points

k(1 −cos θ0) = c.

When c = 2k, the curve’s branches connect two saddle points of E, and corres-
pond to the limit situation in which the bob reaches the top equilibrium point
I with zero velocity (in an inﬁnite time).
•
When c > 2k, the curves are neither closed nor bounded; they correspond to
a minimum non-zero velocity, due to which the pendulum moves past the top
point and then continues to rotate around O, without stopping.

10.5 Linear systems of ﬁrst order
The next two sections concentrate on vectorial linear equations of order one
y′ = A(t)y + b(t) ,
(10.48)
where A is a map from an interval I of the real line to the vector space Rn×n of
square matrices of order n, while b is a function from I to Rn. We shall assume A
and b are continuous in t. Equation (10.48) is shorthand writing for a system of
n diﬀerential equations in n unknown functions

Remark 10.25 The concern with linear equations can be ascribed to the fact
that many mathematical models are regulated by such equations. Models based
on non-linear equations are often approximated by simpler and more practicable
linear versions, by the process of linearisation. The latter essentially consists in
arresting the Taylor expansion of a non-linear map to order one, and disregarding
the remaining part.
More concretely, suppose f is a C1 map on Ω in the variable y and that ¯y(t),
t ∈J ⊆I, is a known solution of the ODE y′ = f(t, y) (e.g., a constant solution
¯y(t) = ¯y0). Then the solutions y(t) that are ‘close to ¯y(t)’ can be approximated
as follows: for any given t ∈J, the expansion of y →f(t, y) around the point ¯y(t)
reads
f(t, y) = f

t, ¯y(t)

+ Jyf

t, ¯y(t)

y −¯y(t)

+ g(t, y)
(10.49)
with g(t, y) = o

y −¯y(t)

for y →¯y(t); Jyf denotes the Jacobian matrix of f
with respect to y only. Set
A(t) = Jyf

t, ¯y(t)

and note that f

t, ¯y(t)

= ¯y′(t), ¯y being a solution. Substituting (10.49) in y′ =
f(t, y) gives
(y −¯y)′ = A(t)(y −¯y) + g(t, y) ;
ignoring the inﬁnitesimal part g then, we can approximate the solution y by setting
z ∼y −¯y and solving the linear equation
z′ = A(t)z ;
if y0 is deﬁned by the initial condition y(t0) = y0 at t0 ∈J, z will be determined
by the datum z(t0) = y0 −¯y(t0). Once z is known, the approximation of y(t) is
˜y(t) = ¯y(t) + z(t).
In the special case of autonomous systems with a constant solution ¯y0, the
matrix A is not time-dependent.

We will show in the sequel that equation (10.48) admits exactly n linearly
independent solutions; as claimed in Sect. 10.2, therefore, the general integral
depends on n arbitrary constants that may be determined by assigning a Cauchy
condition at a point t0 ∈I. Furthermore, if A does not depend on t, so that the aij
are constants, the general integral can be recovered from the (possibly generalised)
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.
We begin by tackling the homogeneous case, in other words b = 0.

10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
10.5.1 Homogeneous systems
Consider the homogeneous equation associated to (10.48), namely
y′ = A(t)y ,
t ∈I ,
(10.50)
and let us prove a key fact.
Proposition 10.26 The set S0 of solutions to (10.50) is a vector space of
dimension n.
Proof.
Since the equation is linear, any linear combination of solutions is still a
solution, making S0 a vector space.
To compute its dimension, we shall exhibit an explicit basis. To that end,
ﬁx an arbitrary point t0 ∈I and consider the n Cauchy problems
 y′ = A(t)y ,
t ∈I ,
y(t0) = ei ,
where {ei}i=1,...,n is the canonical basis of Rn. Recalling Corollary 10.20,
each system admits a unique solution y = ui(t) of class C1 on I. The maps
ui, i = 1, . . . , n, are linearly independent: in fact, if y =
n

i=1
αiui is the
zero map on I, then
n

i=1
αiui(t) = 0 for any t ∈I, so also for t = t0
n

i=1
αiui(t0) =
n

i=1
αiei = 0 ,
whence αi = 0, ∀i, proving the linear independence of the ui.
Eventually, if y = y(t) is an element in S0, we write the vector y0 = y(t0)
as y0 =
n

i=1
y0iei; then
y(t) =
n

i=1
y0iui(t) ,
because both sides solve the equation and agree on t0, and the solution is
unique.

is an example of a fundamental system of solutions.
Deﬁnition 10.27 Any basis of S0 is called a fundamental system of solu-
tions of the ODE (10.50).
There is a useful way to check whether a set of n solutions to (10.50) is a
fundamental system.
Proposition 10.28 Let w1, . . . , wn ∈S0.
a) If at a point t0 ∈I the vectors w1(t0), . . . , wn(t0) are linearly independent,
w1, . . . , wn constitute a fundamental system of solutions.
b) If w1, . . . , wn form a fundamental system of solutions, at each point t0 ∈I
the vectors w1(t0), . . . , wn(t0) are linearly independent.
Proof.
a) It suﬃces to show that w1, . . . , wn are linearly independent. Suppose
then there exist coeﬃcients ci such that
n

i=1
ciwi(t) = 0 ,
∀t ∈I .
Choosing t = t0, the hypothesis forces every ci to vanish.
b) Suppose there exist c1, . . . , cn with
n

i=1
ciwi(t0) = 0 .
Deﬁne the map z(t) =
n

i=1
ciwi(t); since it solves the Cauchy problem
 z′ = Az
z(t0) = 0 ,
by uniqueness we have z(t) = 0 for any t ∈I. Therefore all ci must be
zero.
2
Owing to the proposition, the linear dependence of n vector-valued maps on I
reduces to the (much easier to verify) linear dependence of n vectors in Rn.
We explain now how a fundamental system permits to ﬁnd all solutions
of (10.50) and also to solve the corresponding initial value problem. Given then
a fundamental system {w1, . . . , wn}, for any t ∈I we associate to it the n × n
matrix

458
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
W (t) =

w1(t), . . . , wn(t)

whose columns are the vectors wi(t); by part b) above, the matrix W (t) is
non-singular since its columns are linearly independent. This matrix is called
the fundamental matrix, and using it we may write the n vectorial equations
w′
i = A(t)wi, i = 1, . . . , n, in the compact form
W ′ = A(t)W .
(10.52)
Every solution y = y(t) of (10.50) is represented as
y(t) =
n

i=1
ciwi(t)
for suitable constants ci ∈R. Equivalently, setting c = (c1, . . . , cn)T , we have
y(t) = W(t) c .
(10.53)
The solution to the generic Cauchy problem
 y′ = Ay
on I ,
y(t0) = y0 ,
(10.54)
is found by solving the linear system
W(t0) c = y0 .
(10.55)
Therefore we may write the solution, formally, as
y(t) = W(t)W −1(t0) y0 .
We can simplify this by choosing the fundamental matrix U(t) associated with the
special basis {ui} deﬁned by (10.51); it arises as solution of the Cauchy problem
in matrix form
 U ′ = A(t)U
on I ,
U(t0) = I ,
(10.56)
and allows us to write the solution to (10.54) as
y(t) = U(t) y0 .
We put on hold, for the time being, the study of equation (10.50) to discuss
non-homogeneous systems. We will resume it in Sect. 10.6 under the hypothesis
that A be constant.

10.5 Linear systems of ﬁrst order
459
10.5.2 Non-homogeneous systems
Indicate by Sb the set of all solutions to (10.48). This set can be characterised
starting from a particular solution, also known as particular integral.
Proposition 10.29 Given a solution yp of equation (10.48), Sb is the aﬃne
space Sb = yp + S0.
Proof.
If y ∈Sb, by linearity y −yp solves the homogeneous equation (10.50),
hence y −yp ∈S0.
2
The proposition says that for any given fundamental system w1, . . . , wn of solu-
tions to the homogeneous equation, each solution of (10.48) has the form
y(t) = W(t) c + yp(t) =
n

i=1
ciwi(t) + yp(t)
for some c = (c1, . . . , cn)T ∈Rn.
An alternative route to arrive at the general integral of (10.48) is the method of
variation of constants, already seen in Sect. 10.3.3 for scalar equations. By (10.53)
we look for a solution of the form
y(t) = W(t) c(t)
with c(t) diﬀerentiable to be determined. Substituting, we obtain
W ′(t) c(t) + W(t) c′(t) = A(t)W(t) c(t) + b(t) .
By (10.52) we arrive at
W(t) c′(t) = b(t) ,
from which
c′(t) = W −1(t) b(t) ,
i.e.,
c(t) =

W −1(t) b(t) dt ,
(10.57)
where the indeﬁnite integral denotes the primitive of the vector W −1(t) b(t), com-
ponent by component. The general integral of (10.48) is then
y(t) = W(t)

W −1(t) b(t) dt .

Whenever we have to solve the Cauchy problem
 y′ = A(t)y + b(t)
on I ,
y(t0) = y0 ,
(10.60)
it is convenient to write (10.57) as

with arbitrary c ∈Rn. Equation (10.58) then becomes
y(t) = W(t)c +
 t
t0
W(t)W −1(s) b(s) ds ;
putting t = t0 gives y(t0) = W(t0)c, so c is still determined by solving (10.55).
Altogether, the solution to the Cauchy problem is
y(t) = yhom(t) + yp(t) ,

10.6 Linear systems with constant matrix A
We are ready to resume equation (10.48), under the additional assumption that A
is independent of time. We wish to explain a procedure for ﬁnding a fundamental
system of solutions for
y′ = Ay
on I = R .
(10.62)
The method relies on the computation of the eigenvalues of A, the roots of the
so-called characteristic polynomial of the equation, deﬁned by
χ(λ) = det(A −λI) ,
and the corresponding eigenvectors (perhaps generalised, and deﬁned in the se-
quel).
At the heart of the whole matter lies an essential property:
if λ is an eigenvalue of A with eigenvector v, the map
w(t) = eλtv
solves equation (10.62) (in C, if λ is complex).

462

Indeed, using (10.28) and Av = λv, we have
w′(t) = d
dt

eλtv

= deλt
dt v = λeλt v = eλtAv = A

eλtv

= Aw(t) .
At this point the treatise needs to split in three parts: ﬁrst, we describe the
explicit steps leading to a fundamental system, then explain the procedure by
means of examples, and at last provide the theoretical backgrounds.
To simplify the account, the case where A is diagonalisable is kept separate.
Diagonalisable matrices include prominent cases, like symmetric matrices (whose
eigenvalues and eigenvectors are real) and more generally normal matrices (see
Sect. 4.2). Only afterwards we examine the more involved situation of a matrix
that cannot be diagonalised.
In the end we illustrate a solving method for non-homogeneous equations, with
emphasis on special choices of the source term b(t).
10.6.1 Homogeneous systems with diagonalisable A
Suppose A has ℓreal eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λℓand n −ℓcomplex eigenvalues which,
being A real, come in m complex-conjugate pairs λℓ+1, λℓ+1, . . . , λℓ+m, λℓ+m; ei-
genvalues are repeated according to their algebraic multiplicity, hence ℓ+ 2m = n.
Each real λk, 1 ≤k ≤ℓ, is associated to a real eigenvector vk, while to each pair
(λℓ+k, λℓ+k), 1 ≤k ≤m, corresponds a pair (vℓ+k, vℓ+k) of complex-conjugate
eigenvectors. As A is diagonalisable, we can assume the eigenvectors are linearly
independent (over C).
•
For each real eigenvalue λk, 1 ≤k ≤ℓ, deﬁne the map
wk(t) = eλktvk .
•
For each pair (λℓ+k, λℓ+k), 1 ≤k ≤m, we decompose eigenvalues and eigen-
vectors into real and imaginary parts: λℓ+k = σk + iωk, vℓ+k = v(1)

Explanation. Since eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A may not be real, it is
convenient to think (10.62) within the complex ﬁeld. Thus we view y = y(t) as a
map from R to Cn; the real part yr(t) and the imaginary part yi(t) solve the real
systems
y′
r = Ayr
and
y′
i = Ayi
on I = R .
All subsequent operations are intended over C (clearly, complex arithmetic is
not necessary when A is diagonalisable over R, when all eigenvalues–hence all
eigenvectors–are real). Call Λ = diag(λ1, . . . , λn) the diagonal matrix with the ei-
genvalues as entries, and P = (v1, . . . , vn) the square matrix with the eigenvectors
as columns. Thus A becomes
A = P Λ P−1 .
(10.64)
Let y be an arbitrary complex solution of (10.62); substituting (10.64) in equa-
tion (10.62), and multiplying by P −1 on the left, gives

P −1y
′ = Λ

P −1y

,
by associativity. Now setting
z = P −1y ,
i.e.,
y = P z ,
(10.65)

10.6 Linear systems with constant matrix A
465
equation (10.62) becomes diagonal
z′ = Λz .
(10.66)
In other words we obtain n equations
z′
k = λkzk ,
1 ≤k ≤n .
By Remark 10.5 these have solutions
zk(t) = dkeλkt ,
1 ≤k ≤n ,
with dk ∈C arbitrary constants. Using the diagonal matrix
eΛt = diag

eλ1t, . . . , eλnt
(10.67)
and the constant vector d = (d1, . . . , dn)T ∈Cn, we can write the solutions as
z(t) = eΛtd .
Writing in terms of the unknown y, by the second equation in (10.65), we have
y(t) = P eΛtd ;
(10.68)
it is of the general form (10.53) with W (t) = P eΛt. Making the columns of this
matrix explicit, we have
y(t) = d1eλ1tv1 + · · · + dneλntvn = d1w1(t) + · · · + dnwn(t) ,
(10.69)
where
wk(t) = eλktvk ,
1 ≤k ≤n .
The upshot is that every complex solution of equation (10.62) is a linear com-
bination (with coeﬃcients in C) of the n solutions wk, which therefore are a
fundamental system in C.
To represent the real solutions, consider the generic eigenvalue λ with eigen-
vector v. Note that if λ ∈R (so v ∈Rn), the function w(t) = eλtv is a real solution
of (10.62). Instead, if λ = σ + iω ∈C, so v = v(1) + iv(2) ∈Cn, the functions
w(1)(t) = Re

eλtv

= eσt
v(1) cos ωt −v(2) sin ωt

,
w(2)(t) = Im

eλtv

= eσt
v(1) sin ωt + v(2) cos ωt

,
are real solutions of (10.62); this is clear by taking real and imaginary parts of the
equation and remembering A is real.
In such a way, retaining the notation of Proposition 10.32, we obtain n real
solutions
w1(t), . . . , wℓ(t)
and
w(1)
1 (t), w(2)
1 (t), . . . , w(1)
m (t), w(2)
m (t) .

10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
There remains to verify they are linearly independent (over R). With the help of
Proposition 10.28 with t0 = 0, it suﬃces to show v1, . . . , vℓ, v(1)
1 , v(2)
1 , . . . , v(1)
m , v(2)
m
are linearly independent over R. An easy Linear Algebra exercise will show that
this fact is a consequence of the linear independence of the eigenvectors v1, . . . , vn
over C (actually, it is equivalent).
Remark 10.34 Imposing the datum y(0) = y0 for t0 = 0 in (10.68), solution of
y′ = Ay, we ﬁnd P d = y0, so d = P −1y0. The solution of the Cauchy problem
 y′ = Ay
on I = R ,
y(0) = y0
can therefore be represented as
y(t) = eAty0 ,
(10.70)
where we have used the exponential matrix
eAt = P eΛtP −1
The above formula generalises the expression y(t) = eaty0 for the solution to the
Cauchy problem y′ = ay, y(0) = y0 .
The representation (10.70) is valid also when A is not diagonalisable. In that
case though, the exponential matrix is deﬁned otherwise
eAt =
∞

k=0
1
k! (tA)k .
This formula is suggested by the power series (2.24) of the exponential function
ex; the series converges for any matrix A and for any t ∈R.

10.6.2 Homogeneous systems with non-diagonalisable A
By λ1, . . . , λp we number the distinct eigenvalues of A, while μk denotes the algeb-
raic multiplicity of λk, i.e., the multiplicity as root of the characteristic polynomial
det(A−λI). Then n = μ1+. . .+μp. Call mk ≤μk the geometric multiplicity of λk,
that is the maximum number of linearly independent eigenvectors vk,1, . . . , vk,mk
relative to λk. We remind A is diagonalisable if and only if the algebraic and geo-
metric multiplicities of every eigenvalue coincide; from now on we suppose mk < μk
for at least one λk. Then it is possible to prove there are dk = μk −mk vectors
rk,1, . . . , rk,dk, called generalised eigenvectors associated to λk, such that the
μk vectors vk,1, . . . , vk,mk, rk,1, . . . , rk,dk are linearly independent. Moreover, the
collection of eigenvectors and generalised eigenvectors, for k = 1, . . . , p, builds a
basis of Cn.

10.6 Linear systems with constant matrix A
467
Let us see how to construct generalised eigenvectors associated to λk. For every
eigenvector vk,ℓ, 1 ≤ℓ≤mk, deﬁne r(0)
k,ℓ= vk,ℓand seek whether a solution of
(A −λkI)r = r(0)
k,ℓ
(10.71)
exists. The matrix A −λkI is singular, by deﬁnition of eigenvalue. The system
may not have solutions, in which case the eigenvector vk,ℓwill not furnish gener-
alised eigenvectors. If however the system is consistent, a solution r(1)
k,ℓwill be a
generalised eigenvector associated to λk. Now we substitute r(1)
k,ℓto r(0)
k,ℓin (10.71),
and repeat the argument. This will produce a cascade of linear systems
(A −λkI)r(1)
k,ℓ= r(0)
k,ℓ,
(A −λkI)r(2)
k,ℓ= r(1)
k,ℓ,
...
(10.72)
that stops once the system (A−λkI)r = r(h)
k,ℓ, h ≥0, has no solutions. As a result,
we obtain qk,ℓ= h −1 generalised eigenvectors. Varying ℓ= 1, . . . , mk will yield
all the dk = qk,1 + . . . + qk,mk generalised eigenvectors relative to λk.
Let us now move to fundamental systems of solutions for (10.62).

Proposition 10.35 With the above notations, the set of functions {w(h)
k,ℓ:

over C of (10.62).

If we wish to represent real solutions only, observe that λk ∈R implies all
eigenvectors (proper and generalised) are real, hence also the maps w(h)
k,ℓ(t), built
from them, are real. In presence of a complex-conjugate pair λk, λk′ = λk of
eigenvalues, the corresponding eigenvectors (generalised or not) will crop up in
conjugate pairs. For that reason it is enough to replace each pair of complex-
conjugate functions, deﬁned by those vectors, with their real and imaginary parts.
The construction of a real fundamental system for (10.62) is thus complete.
Remark 10.36 We have assumed A not diagonalisable. But actually the above
recipe works even when the matrix can be diagonalised (when the algebraic mul-
tiplicity is greater than 1, one cannot know a priori whether a matrix is diagon-
alisable or not, except in a few cases, e.g., symmetric matrices). If the matrix is
diagonalisable, systems (10.71) will be inconsistent, rendering (10.73) equivalent
to the solution of Sect. 10.6.1.

has eigenvalues λ1 = 5, λ2 = 3. The ﬁrst has algebraic multiplicity μ1 = 1, and
v11 = (0, 1, 0)T is the associated eigenvector. The second eigenvalue has algebraic
multiplicity μ2 = 2 and geometric m2 = 1. The vector v21 = (1, −1, 1)T is
associated to λ2. By solving (A−3I)r = v21 we obtain a generalised eigenvector
r(1)
21 = (1, −1, 0)T which, together with v11, v21, gives a basis of R3. Therefore,
the general integral of (10.62) is

it. The system

Explanation. All the results about eigenvectors, both proper and generalised,
can be proved starting from the so-called Jordan canonical form of a matrix,
whose study goes beyond the reach of the course.
What we can easily do is account for the linear independence of the maps
w(h)
k,ℓ(t) of Proposition 10.35. Taking t0 = 0 in Proposition 10.28 gives
w(h)
k,ℓ(0) = r(h)
k,ℓ
for any k, ℓ, h, so the result follows from the analogue property for A.

10.6.3 Non-homogeneous systems
In the light of Proposition 10.29, a non-homogeneous equation
y′ = Ay + b(t)
(10.74)
can be solved by simply ﬁnding a particular integral yp.
The method of variation of parameters, and especially formula (10.61), provides
us with a general means. However, in many situations the source term b(t) can be
broken into elementary functions like exponentials, polynomials or trigonometric
maps. Then a particular integral of the same elementary type is usually easy to
ﬁnd.
Henceforth we shall call a polynomial any function p(t), q(t), . . . from R to Rn
whose components are real algebraic polynomials; a polynomial has degree m if
the maximum degree of the components is m, in which case it can be written as
q(t) = c0tm + c1tm−1 + . . . + cm−1t + cm ,
with cj ∈Rn and c0 ̸= 0.
Let us suppose that
b(t) = eαtp(t)
(10.75)
with α ∈R and p(t) a degree-m polynomial. Then there exists a particular integral
yp(t) = eαtq(t) ,
(10.76)
where q(t) is a polynomial of degree
•
m if α is not an eigenvalue of A,
•
m + μ if α is an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity μ ≥1.
Borrowing from Physics, one refers to the latter situation as resonance.
The undetermined coeﬃcients of q(t) are found by substituting (10.76) in equa-
tion (10.74), simplifying the exponential terms and matching the coeﬃcients of the
corresponding powers of t. This produces a series of linear systems with matrix
A−αI that allow to determine solutions c0, c1, . . . , cm+μ starting from the highest
power of t. In case of resonance, A−αI is singular; then the ﬁrst system just says
that c0 is an eigenvector of A, and the other systems require compatibility condi-
tions to be solved. Example 10.38 ii) illustrates a situation of this type, detailing
the computation to be performed.
If the source term looks like
b(t) = eαtp(t) cos ωt
or
b(t) = eαtp(t) sin ωt ,
(10.77)

10.6 Linear systems with constant matrix A
471
with α ∈R, p(t) a polynomial of degree m, ω ̸= 0, then a particular integral will
be
yp(t) = eαt
q1(t) cos ωt + q2(t) sin ωt

(10.78)
with q1(t), q2(t) polynomials of degree
•
m if α + iω is not eigenvalue of A,
•
m + μ if α + iω is an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity μ ≥1.
The latter case is once again called of resonance. The polynomials’ undetermined
coeﬃcients are found as before, preliminarly separating terms with cos ωt from
those with sin ωt.

A =

⎠
and
b(t) =

⎠.
Referring to (10.75), α = 0, p(t) = b0t2 + b1t with b0 = (0, 0, 1)T , b1 = (0, 1, 0)T
(and b2 = 0). Since α is not a root of the characteristic polynomial χ(λ) =
(2 −λ)(λ2 + 1), we look for a particular integral
yp(y) = q(t) = c0t2 + c1t + c2 .
Substituting in (10.74), we have
2c0t + c1 = Ac0t2 + Ac1t + Ac2 + b0t2 + b1t ,
so comparing terms yields the cascade of systems
⎧
⎨
⎩
Ac0 = −b0
Ac1 = 2c0 −b1
Ac2 = c1 .
These give c0 = (0, 0, −1/2)T, c1 = (−1, 0, 0)T and c2 = (0, 1, 0)T, and a partic-
ular integral is then
yp(t) =

and

.
As α = 1 is a root of the characteristic polynomial χ(λ) = (λ −5)(λ −1), we are
in presence of resonance, so we must try to ﬁnd a particular integral of the form
yp(t) = et(c0t + c1) .
Substituting and simplifying, we have
c0 + c0t + c1 = Ac0t + Ac1 + b0

472
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
where b0 = (1, 0)T , and so  (A −I)c0 = 0
(A −I)c1 = c0 −b0 .
The ﬁrst system yields an eigenvector c0 = (γ, 2γ)T associated to λ = 1, for some
γ ∈R. This constant γ is ﬁxed requiring the second system to be consistent,
meaning c0 −b0 is a linear combination of the columns of A −I. But that
matrix has rank 1 since the columns are linearly dependent, so the condition is
that c0 −b0 is a multiple of another column, (γ −1, 2γ)T = k(1, 1)T; this implies
γ −1 = 2γ, so γ = −1. Substituting gives c0 = (−1, −2)T and c1 = (1, 5/2)T,
for example. In conclusion, a particular integral has the form

Referring to (10.77), now α = 0, p(t) = (1, 0, 0)T = p0 and ω = 2. The complex
number α + iω = 2i is no eigenvalue of A (these are −1, ±i), so (10.78) will be
yp(t) = q1 cos 2t + q2 sin 2t
with q1, q2 ∈R3. Let us substitute in (10.74) to get
−2q1 sin 2t + 2q2 cos 2t = Aq1 cos 2t + Aq2 sin 2t + p0 sin 2t ;
comparing the corresponding terms we obtain the two linear systems
 −2q1 = Aq2 + p0
2q2 = Aq1 ,
solved by q1 = (−2/3, 0, 1/6)T, q2 = (0, −1/3, −1/12)T. We conclude that a

The superposition principle
Ultimately, suppose b(t) is the sum of terms like (10.75) or (10.77). By virtue of
linearity, a particular solution yp will be the sum of particular solutions of the
single summands:
if b = b1 + b2 + . . . + bK, and ypk solves y′ = Ay + bk for k = 1, . . . , K,
then yp = yp1 + . . . + ypK solves y′ = Ay + b.

The property is known as superposition (or linearity) principle. Example 10.42 ii)
will provide us with a tangible application.
10.7 Linear scalar equations of order n
In this section we tackle linear scalar equations
y(n) + a1y(n−1) + . . . + an−1y′ + any = b(t) ,
(10.79)
where n is an integer ≥2, the coeﬃcients a1, . . . , an are real constants and b is a
real-valued continuous map deﬁned on the real interval I. We abbreviate by Ly
the left-hand side; the operator L : y →L y is linear because diﬀerentiation is a
linear operation. Then
Ly = y(n) + a1y(n−1) + . . . + an−1y′ + any = 0
(10.80)
is called the homogeneous equation associated to (10.79).
The background theory can be deduced from the results on linear systems
of ﬁrst-order equations, settled in the previous section. In fact, we remarked in
Sect. 10.2 that any ODE of order n is equivalent to a system of n diﬀerential
equations of order one. In the case at hand, we set yi(t) = y(i−1)(t), 1 ≤i ≤n, so
that (10.79) is equivalent to the linear system

10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
The homogeneous equation
Equation (10.80) corresponds to the homogeneous system relative to (10.81). From
this we recover the following central result.
Proposition 10.39 i) The set S0 of solutions to the homogeneous equa-
tion (10.80) is an n-dimensional vector space.
ii) The set Sb of solutions to (10.79) is the aﬃne space Sb = yp + S0, where
yp is any solution.
Proof.
i) S0 is a vector space because (10.80) is a linear constraint. With Propos-
ition 10.26 in mind, let w1, . . . , wn be a fundamental system of solutions
for y′ = Ay. Denote by zi = wi · e1 the ﬁrst components of the vectors,
which clearly solve (10.80).
If y ∈S0, the associated vector-valued map y is a linear combination
of the wi; in particular its ﬁrst component is a combination of the zi.
Thus S0 is spanned by those solutions. The claim follows provided we
show that the functions z1, . . . , zn are linearly independent. By successively
diﬀerentiating
n

i=1
cizi(t) = 0 ,
∀t ∈R ,
we get, for all 1 ≤k ≤n −1,
n

i=1
ciz(k)
i
(t) = 0 ,
∀t ∈R .
But z(k)
i
is the (k+1)th component of wi, so we obtain the vector equation
n

i=1
ciwi(t) = 0 ,
∀t ∈R ,
whence c1 = . . . = cn = 0 by linear independence of the wi.
ii) The argument is similar to the one used in Proposition 10.29.
2
In order to ﬁnd a basis for S0, the linear system associated to (10.80) is not
necessary, because one can act directly on the equation: we are looking for solu-
tions y(t) = eλt, with λ constant, possibly complex. Substituting into (10.80), and
recalling (10.28), gives
L(eλt) = (λn + a1λn−1 + . . . + an−1λ + an) eλt = 0 ,
i.e.,
L(eλt) = χ(λ)eλt = 0 ,

10.7 Linear scalar equations of order n
475
where χ(λ) = λn+a1λn−1+. . .+an−1λ+an is the characteristic polynomial of
the ODE (10.79). Since eλt is always non-zero, y(t) = eλt solves the homogeneous
equation if and only if λ is a root of the characteristic polynomial, that is if and
only if λ satisﬁes the characteristic equation
λn + a1λn−1 + . . . + an−1λ + an = 0 .
(10.82)
Hence, the diﬀerential problem is reduced to a purely algebraic question, that the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra can handle. We know that (10.82) has p distinct
solutions λ1, . . . , λp, 1 ≤p ≤n; each root λk, 1 ≤k ≤p, has multiplicity μk ≥1,
so that overall μ1 + . . . + μp = n. The characteristic equation’s zeroes are nothing
but the eigenvalues of A in (10.81), because one could prove
det(A −λI) = (−1)nχ(λ) .
This gives directly p distinct solutions
eλ1t, . . . , eλpt
to (10.80). If p < n, any root λk of multiplicity μk > 1 gives μk−1 further solutions
t eλkt, t2 eλkt, . . . , tμk−1 eλkt .
The n solutions thus found can be proven to be linearly independent. In summary,
the result reads as follows.
Proposition 10.40 The functions
zk,ℓ(t) = tℓeλkt ,
1 ≤k ≤p,
0 ≤ℓ≤μk −1 ,
form a basis for the space S0 of solutions to (10.80). Equivalently, every solu-
tion of the equation has the form
y(t) =
p

k=1
qk(t) eλkt ,
with qk a polynomial of degree ≤μk −1.
In presence of complex(-conjugate) roots of equation (10.82), the corresponding
basis functions are complex-valued. But we can ﬁnd a real basis if we replace the
pair tℓeλkt, tℓeλkt with the real and imaginary parts of either of them, for any pair
of complex-conjugate eigenvalues λk = σk + iωk, λk = σk −iωk. That is to say,
tℓeσkt cos ωkt
and
tℓeσkt sin ωkt
are n linearly independent, real solutions.

10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
Examples 10.41
i) Let us make the previous construction truly explicit for an equation of order
two,
y′′ + a1y′ + a2y = 0 .
(10.83)
Let Δ = a2
1 −4a2 be the discriminant of λ2 + a1λ + a2 = 0.
When Δ > 0, there are two distinct real roots λ1,2 = (−a1 ±
√
Δ)/2, so the
generic solution to (10.83) is
y(t) = c1 eλ1t + c2 eλ2t .
(10.84)
When Δ = 0, the real root λ1 = −a1/2 is double, μ1 = 2; so, the generic solution
reads
y(t) = (c1 + c2t) eλ1t .
(10.85)
Eventually, when Δ < 0 we have complex-conjugate roots λ1 = σ +iω = −a/2+
i

|Δ| and λ2 = σ −iω = −a/2 −i

|Δ|, and the solution to (10.83) is

y(4) + y = 0 .

The non-homogeneous equation
Just as for systems of order one, a particular integral is easy to ﬁnd when b(t) has
a special form. For instance, for
b(t) = eαtp(t)
(10.87)
with α ∈R, p(t) an algebraic polynomial of degree m with real coeﬃcients, there
is a particular integral
yp(t) = eαttμq(t) ,
(10.88)
where μ ≥0 is the multiplicity of α as a zero of χ(λ) = 0 (with μ = 0 if α is not
a root, while μ ≥1 gives resonance), and q(t) is a polynomial of degree m with
unknown coeﬃcients. These coeﬃcients are determined by substituting (10.88)
in (10.79), simplifying the common factor eαt and comparing the polynomial func-
tions in t.
Take another example, like
b(t) = eαtp(t) cos ωt
or
b(t) = eαtp(t) sin ωt ,
(10.89)

10.7 Linear scalar equations of order n
477
with α ∈R, p(t) a real algebraic polynomial of degree m, ω ̸= 0. This gives a
particular integral
yp(t) = eαttμ
q1(t) cos ωt + q2(t) sin ωt

,
(10.90)
where μ ≥0 is the multiplicity of α + iω, and q1, q2 are unknown polynomials of
degree m to be found as above, i.e., separating the terms in cos ωt and sin ωt.
The superposition principle is still valid if b(t) is a sum of terms bk(t) like (10.87)
or (10.89): a particular integral for (10.79) will be a sum of particular integrals for
the bk(t).
Examples 10.42
i) Determine the general integral of
y′′ −y′ −6y = te−2t .
The characteristic equation λ2 −λ −6 = 0 has roots λ1 = −2, λ2 = 3, so the
general homogeneous integral is
yhom(t) = c1e−2t + c2e3t .
In a situation of resonance between the source term and a component of yhom,
the particular integral has to be of type
yp(t) = t(at + b)e−2t .
We diﬀerentiate and substitute back in the ODE to obtain
−10at + 2a −5b = t
(the coeﬃcient of t2 on the left is zero, as a consequence of resonance), from
which −10a = 1 and 2a −5b = 0, so a = −1/10, b = −1/25. In conclusion,
y(t) =

−1
10t2 −1
25t + c1

e−2t + c2e3t .
ii) Let us ﬁnd the general integral of
y′′′ + y′ = cos t −2e3t .
By superposition
y(t) = yhom(t) + yp1(t) −2yp2(t) ,
where yhom is the general homogeneous integral, yp1 and yp2 are particular in-
tegrals relative to sources cos t and e3t.
The characteristic equation λ3 + λ = 0 has roots λ1 = 0, λ2,3 = ±i, hence
yhom(t) = c1 + c2 cos t + c3 sin t .
Taking resonance into account, we want yp1 of the form yp1(t) = t(a cos t+b sint).
Computing successive derivatives of yp1 and substituting them into
y′′′
p1 + y′
p1 = cos t
gives −2a cost −2b sin t = cos t, so a = −1/2 and b = 0. Therefore yp1(t) =
−1
2 cos t.

10.8 Stability
The long-time behaviour of solutions of an ODE is a problem of great theoretical
and applicative importance. A large class of dynamical systems, i.e., of systems
whose state depends upon time and that are modelled by one or more diﬀerential
equations, admit solutions at any time t after a given instant t0. The behaviour
of a particular solution can be very diversiﬁed: for instance, after a starting trans-
ition where it depends strongly on the initial data, it could subsequently converge
asymptotically to a limit solution, independent of time; it could, instead, present
a periodic, or quasi-periodic, course, or approach such a conﬁguration; a solution
could even have an absolutely unpredictable, or chaotic, behaviour in time.
Perhaps more interesting than the single solution is though the behaviour of
a family of solutions that diﬀer by slight perturbations either of the initial data,
or of the ODE. In fact, the far future of one solution might not be representative
of other solutions that kick oﬀnearby. Often the mathematical model described
by an ODE is just an approximation of a physically-more-complex system; to
establish the model’s reliability it is thus fundamental to determine how ‘robust’
the information that can be extracted from it is, with respect to the possible errors
of the model. In the majority of cases moreover, the ODE is solved numerically, and
the discretised problem will introduce extra perturbations. These and other reasons
lead us to ask ourselves whether solutions that are initially very close stay close at
all times, even converge to a limit solution, rather than moving eventually apart
from one another. These kinds of issues are generically referred to as concerning
(asymptotic) stability. The results on continuous dependency upon initial data,
discussed in Sect. 10.4.1 (especially Proposition 10.15), do not answer the question
satisfactorily. They merely provide information about bounded time intervals: the
constant eL|t−t0| showing up in (10.36) grows exponentially from the instant t0. A
more speciﬁc and detailed analysis is needed to properly understand the matter.
We shall discuss stability exclusively in relationship with stationary solutions;
the generalisation to periodic orbits and chaotic behaviours is incredibly fascinat-
ing but cannot be dealt with at present.
Let us begin with the Cauchy problem
 y′ = f(t, y) ,
t > t0 ,
y(t0) = y0 ,

and suppose there is a ¯y0, belonging to D, such that f(t, ¯y0) = 0 for any t ≥t0.
Then y(t) = ¯y0, ∀t ≥t0, is a constant solution that we shall call stationary solu-
tion. The point ¯y0 is said critical point, stationary point, or equilibrium
point for the equation. A further hypothesis will be that the solutions to (10.91)
are deﬁned at all times t > t0, whichever the initial datum y0 in a suitable neigh-
bourhood ¯B of ¯y0; from now on y(t, y0) will denote such a solution. Therefore, it
makes sense to compare these solutions to ¯y0 over the interval [t0, +∞). To this
end, the notions of (Lyapunov) stability and attractive solution are paramount.
Deﬁnition 10.43 The stationary solution ¯y0 = y(t, ¯y0) to problem (10.91)
is stable if, for any neighbourhood Bε(¯y0) of ¯y0, there exists a neighbourhood
Bδ(¯y0) such that
y0 ∈¯B ∩Bε(¯y0)
=⇒
y(t, y0) ∈Bδ(¯y0) ∀t ≥t0 .
This is exempliﬁed in Fig. 10.9.
Deﬁnition 10.44 The stationary solution ¯y0 is called attractive (or an
attractor) if there exists a neighbourhood B(¯y0) ⊆¯B such that
y0 ∈B(¯y0)

and uniformly attractive (a uniform attractor) if the above limit is uni-
form with respect to y0, i.e.,
lim
t→+∞
sup
y0∈B(¯y0)
∥y(t, y0) −¯y0)∥= 0 .
The two properties of stability and attractiveness are unrelated. The point ¯y0 is
uniformly asymptotically stable if it is both stable and uniformly attractive.
Example 10.45
The simplest (yet rather meaningful, as we will see) case is the autonomous
linear problem
 y′ = λy ,
t > 0 ,
λ ∈R ,
y(t0) = y0 ,
whose only stationary solution is ¯y0 = 0. The solutions y(t, y0) = eλty0 conﬁrm
that 0 is stable if and only if λ ≤0 (in this case we may choose δ = ε in the
deﬁnition). Moreover, for λ = 0 the point 0 is not an attractor (all solutions are
clearly constant), whereas for λ < 0, the point 0 is uniformly attractive (hence
uniformly asymptotically stable): for example setting B(0) = B1(0) = (−1, 1),
we have
sup
y0∈B(0)
|y(t, y0)| = eλt →0
as t →+∞.
As far as stability is concerned, we obtain similar results when λ ∈C (complex-
valued solutions) provided we replace λ with Re λ.
2
This example generalises directly to autonomous linear systems, now examined.
10.8.1 Autonomous linear systems
Suppose f(t, y) = f(y) = Ay + b has A ∈Rn,n and b ∈Rn independent of time.
A stationary solution of (10.91) corresponds to a solution of the linear system
Ay = −b (unique if A is non-singular). If ¯y0 is one such solution the variable
change z = y −¯y0 allows us to study the stability of the zero solution of the
homogeneous equation z′ = Az. There is so no loss of generality in considering,
henceforth, the stability of the solution y(t, 0) = 0 of the homogeneous problem
 y′ = Ay ,
t > 0 ,
y(t0) = y0 .
(10.92)
From Sect. 10.6, in particular Proposition 10.35, we know every solution y(t, y0)
is a linear combination of
w(t) = eλtp(t) ,

10.8 Stability
481
where λ ∈C is an eigenvalue of A, and p(t) is a vector-valued polynomial in t
depending on the eigenvector (or one of the eigenvectors) associated to λ. In case
the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of λ coincide, every p(t) associated to
it has degree 0, and so is constant; otherwise, there exist polynomials of positive
degree, which therefore tend to ∞as t →+∞.
Consequences:
•
if every eigenvalue of A has negative real part, then all basis elements w(t)
tend to 0 as t →+∞(recall eσttβ →0 for t →+∞if σ = Re λ < 0, for any
β);
•
if all eigenvalues of A have negative or zero real part, and the latter ones
have coinciding algebraic and geometric multiplicities, all w(t) are bounded on
[0, +∞);
•
if there are eigenvalues of A with positive real part, or zero real part and
algebraic multiplicity greater than the geometric multiplicity, then some w(t)
tends to ∞as t →+∞.
How this translates in the language of stability is easily said.
Proposition 10.46 a) The origin y(t, 0) = 0 is a stable solution of (10.92)
if and only if all eigenvalues λ of A satisfy Re λ ≤0, and those with Re λ = 0
have the same algebraic and geometric multiplicity.
b) The origin is a uniformly attractive solution (hence, uniformly asymptot-
ically stable) if and only if all eigenvalues of A satisfy Re λ < 0.
We shall investigate now all the scenarios for systems of two equations.
10.8.2 Two-dimensional systems
The generic 2 × 2 matrix
A =
	
a
b
c
d

has determinant detA = ad −bc and trace trA = a + d. Its eigenvalues are roots
of the characteristic polynomial χ(λ) = λ2 −trA λ + detA, so
λ = trA ±

(trA)2 −4 detA
2
.
If (trA)2 ̸= 4 detA, then the eigenvalues are distinct, necessarily simple, and the
matrix is diagonalisable. If, instead, (trA)2 = 4 detA, the double eigenvalue λ =
trA/2 has geometric multiplicity 2 if and only if b = c = 0, i.e., A is diagonal; if
the multiplicity is one, A is not diagonalisable.
Let us assume ﬁrst A is diagonalisable. Then Proposition 10.32 tells us each
solution of (10.92) can be written as
y(t, y0) = z1(t)v1 + z2(t)v2 ,
(10.93)

482
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
where v1, v2 are linearly independent vectors (in fact, they are precisely the ei-
genvectors if the eigenvalues are real, or two vectors manufactured from a complex
eigenvector’s real and imaginary parts if the eigenvalues are complex-conjugate);
z1(t) and z2(t) denote real maps satisfying, in particular, z1(0)v1 + z2(0)v2 = y0.
To understand properly the possible asymptotic situations, it proves useful to
draw a phase portrait, i.e., a representation of the orbits
Γ(y) = {y(t, y0) = (y1(t), y2(t)) : t ≥0}
on the phase plane R2 of coordinates y1, y2. We will see straight away that it is
possible to eliminate t and obtain an explicit functional relationship between y1
and y2. Actually, it will be better to perform such operation on the variables z1
and z2 ﬁrst, represent the orbit Γ(z) = {(z1(t), z2(t)) : t ≥0} in the phase plane
z1z2, and then pass to the plane y1y2 using the linear transformation (10.93).
We have to distinguish six cases.
i) Two real non-zero eigenvalues with equal sign: λ2 ≤λ1 < 0 or 0 < λ1 ≤λ2.
Then
z1(t) = d1eλ1t ,
z2(t) = d2eλ2t ,
with d1, d2 dependent on y0. If d1 = 0 or d2 = 0, the orbits lie on the coordinate
axes z1 = 0 or z2 = 0. If neither is zero,
z2(t) = d2

(which are half-lines if λ1 = λ2.) Points on the orbits move in time towards the
origin, which is thus uniformly asymptotically stable, if the eigenvalues are negative
(Fig. 10.10, left); the orbits leave the origin if the eigenvalues are positive. On the
plane y1y2 the corresponding orbits are shown by Fig. 10.10, right, where we took
v1 = (3, 1), v2 = (−1, 1).
The origin is called a node, and is stable or unstable according to the eigen-
values’ signs.
ii) Two real eigenvalues, at least one of which is zero:
λ2 ≤λ1 = 0 or 0 = λ1 ≤λ2.
The function z1(t) = d1 is constant. Therefore if λ2 ̸= 0, the orbits are vertical
half-lines, oriented towards the axis z2 = 0 if λ2 < 0, the other way if λ2 > 0
(Fig. 10.11). If λ2 = 0, the matrix A is null (being diagonalisable), hence all orbits
are constant. Either way, the origin is a stable equilibrium point, but not attractive.
iii) Two real eigenvalues with opposite signs: λ2 < 0 < λ1.
The z1z2-orbits are the four semi-axes, together with the curves
z2 = dzα
1 ,
with α < 0
(hyperbolas, if α = −1), oriented as in Fig. 10.12.
The origin, called a saddle point, is neither stable nor attractive.
iv) Two purely-imaginary eigenvalues: λ = ±iω , ω ̸= 0.
As
z1(t) = d1 cos(ωt + d2)
and
z2(t) = d1 sin(ωt + d2) ,
the orbits are concentric circles on the phase plane z1z2, and concentric ellipses on
y1y2 (Fig. 10.13).
The origin is called a centre, and is stable but not attractive.

v) Complex-conjugate eigenvalues, with non-zero real part: λ = σ ± iω, with
ω ̸= 0 and σ < 0 or σ > 0.
From
z1(t) = d1eσt cos(ωt + d2)
and
z2(t) = d1eσt sin(ωt + d2) ,
we see the orbits spiralling towards the origin if σ < 0, and moving outward if
σ > 0 (Fig. 10.14). In the former case the origin is uniformly asymptotically stable.
The origin is a focus, stable or unstable according to the sign of σ.
The last case occurs for non-diagonalisable A, in other words if there is a double
eigenvalue with geometric multiplicity equal 1. Then v1 is the unique eigenvector
in (10.93), and v2 is the associated generalised eigenvector, see (10.71).

vi) One real double eigenvalue λ, of geometric multiplicity 1.
We have
z1(t) = d1eλ1t ,
z2(t) = eλ2t(d2 + d1t) .
When λ = 0, and d1 ̸= 0, the orbits are vertical straight lines as shown in Fig. 10.15;
for d1 = 0 the orbits are ﬁxed points on z1 = 0. Therefore, the origin is neither
stable, nor attractive.

Figure 10.16 shows the orbits oriented to, or from, the origin according to whether
λ < 0, λ > 0. The origin is uniformly asymptotically stable, and still called (de-
generate, or improper) node; again, it is stable or unstable depending on the
eigenvalue sign.
Application: the simple pendulum (IV). The example continues from p. 454.
The dynamical system y′ = f(y) has an inﬁnity of equilibrium points ¯y0, because
f(¯y0) = 0
if and only if
¯y2 = 0 and ¯y1 = ℓπ with ℓ∈Z .
The solutions θ(t) = ℓπ, with ℓan even number, correspond to a vertical rod, with
P in the lowest point S (Fig. 10.3); when ℓis odd the bob is in the highest position
I. It is physically self-evident that moving P from S a little will make the bob
swing back to S; on the contrary, the smallest nudge to the bob placed in I will
make it move away and never return, at any future moment. This is precisely the
meaning of a stable point S and an unstable point I.
The discussion of Sect. 10.8.2 renders this intuitive idea precise. Consider a
simpliﬁed model for the pendulum, obtained by linearising equation (10.12) around
an equilibrium position.
On a neighbourhood of the point ¯θ = 0 we have sin θ ∼θ, so equation (10.12)
can be replaced by
d2θ
dt2 + αdθ
dt + kθ = 0 ,
(10.94)
which describes small oscillations around the equilibrium S; the value α = 0
gives the equation of harmonic motion. The corresponding solution to the Cauchy
problem (10.13) is easy to ﬁnd by referring to Example 10.4. Equivalently, the
initial value problem assumes the form (10.92) with
A =
	 0
1
−k −α

= Jf(0, 0) ,

10.8 Stability

whose eigenvalues are λ = −α ±

α2 −4k

. Owing to Sect. 10.8.2, we have that
•
if α2 ≥4k, the origin ¯y0 = (0, 0) is a uniformly asymptotically stable node
[cases i) or vi)] ;
•
if 0 < α2 < 4k, the origin is a uniformly asymptotically stable focus [case
v)] ;
•
if α = 0, the origin is a centre [case iv)] .
Whatever the case, the bottom position S is always stable.
Linearising (10.12) around the equilibrium ¯θ = π, and changing variables ϕ =
θ −π (so that sin θ = −sin ϕ) produces a problem of the form (10.92), with
A =
	
0

k −α

= Jf(π, 0) .
The eigenvalues λ = −α ±

α2 + 4k

are always non-zero and of distinct sign. The
point ¯y0 = (π, 0) is thus a saddle [case iii)], and so unstable. This substantiates
the claim that I is an unstable equilibrium.
The discussion will end on p. 488.

10.8.3 Non-linear stability: an overview
Certain stability features of linear systems are inherited by non-linear systems,
thought of as deformations of linear ones. Suppose the function f(t, y) appearing
in (10.91) has the form
f(t, y) = Ay + g(t, y) ,
(10.95)
with g continuous and such that
g(t, y) = o(∥y∥)
as y →0 uniformly in t ;
(10.96)
this means there exists a continuous map φ : R+ →R+ such that φ(s) →0,
s →0+, and
∥g(t, y)∥≤φ(∥y∥)∥y∥,
∀y ∈B(0) ,
∀t > t0 ,
on a neighbourhood B(0) of the origin. Then, the origin is an equilibrium for
equation (10.91). What can we say about its asymptotic stability? One answer is
given by the following fact.
Theorem 10.47 Let f be deﬁned by (10.95), with g as in (10.96).
a) If all eigenvalues of A have strictly negative real part, the origin is a
uniformly asymptotically stable equilibrium for (10.91).
b) If there is an eigenvalue of A with strictly positive real part, the origin is
unstable.

488
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
Under the given hypotheses the properties of the non-linear system y′ = Ay +
g(t, y) are the same of the corresponding linear one y′ = Ay; the latter is nothing
but the linearisation, around the origin, of the former (compare Remark 10.25).
We cannot say much more if all eigenvalues have non-positive real parts and some
are purely imaginary: stability in this case depends upon other properties of g.
Yet, the theorem has an important consequence for autonomous systems
around an equilibrium ¯y0. The criterion is known as Principle of linearised
stability.
Corollary 10.48 Let f : D ⊆Rn →Rn be a C1 map, ¯y0 ∈D such that
f(¯y0) = 0, and A = Jf(¯y0) the Jacobian of f at ¯y0. Then the autonomous
system y′ = f(y) has the following stability properties.
a) If all eigenvalues of A have negative real part, ¯y0 is a uniformly asymp-
totically stable equilibrium for (10.91).
b) If there is an eigenvalue of A with positive real part, ¯y0 is unstable.
Proof.
Using the Taylor expansion (5.16) at ¯y0,
f(y) = f(¯y0) + Jf(¯y0)(y −¯y0) + g(y) = A(y −¯y0) + g(y) ,
with g(y) = o(∥y −¯y0∥) as y →¯y0. The variable change z = y −¯y0
puts us in the hypotheses of the previous theorem, thus concluding the
proof.
2
These two results are local in nature. Global information concerning the stabil-
ity of a stationary point can be obtained, for autonomous systems, from the know-
ledge of a ﬁrst integral (Sect. 10.4.5), or a Lyapunov function (Example 10.22 ii)).
A conservative system corresponding to an equation like (10.42) or (10.46)
admits a ﬁrst integral, namely the total energy E; therefore, by a theorem due
to Lagrange, we can say that if the origin is a strict minimum for the potential
energy Π, it must be a stable equilibrium for the system.
The same conclusion follows if the origin is stationary for a system admitting a
Lyapunov function V . Furthermore, if the derivative of V along any trajectory is
strictly negative (with the exception of the origin), then the origin is an attractor.
Application: the simple pendulum (V). The results about the linearised equa-
tion (10.94) determine the stability of the stationary points of (10.12) in presence
of damping. As a consequence of linearised stability (Corollary 10.48), if α > 0 the
matrix Jf(¯y0) = A has two eigenvalues with negative real part for ¯y0 = (0, 0), and
one eigenvalue with positive real part for ¯y0 = (π, 0). As in the linearised problem,
the bottom equilibrium point S is uniformly asymptotically stable, whereas the
top point I is unstable. Figure 10.17 zooms on the phase portrait. Multiplying

making the energy a Lyapunov function, which thus decreases along the orbits
(compare with Fig. 10.8).
For a free undamped motion, equilibria behave in the same way in the linear and
non-linear problems; this, though, can be proved by other methods. In particular,
the origin’s stability follows from the the fact that it minimises the potential energy,
by Lagrange’s Theorem.

Since ϕ(z) = (z −1)(z + 3) vanishes at z = 1 and z = −3, we get y = t and
y = −3t as singular integrals. For the general integral we separate the variables,

4. Bernoulli equations:
a) In the notation of Sect. 10.3.4,
p(t) = −1 ,
q(t) = 1
t ,
α = 2 .
As α = 2 > 0, y(t) = 0 is a solution. Now divide by y2,
1
y2 y′ = 1
ty −1 ,
and set z = z(t) = y1−2 = 1
y; then z′ = −1
y2 y′ and the equation reads z′ =
1 −1
t z. Solving for z,
z = z(t) = t2 + c
2t
,
c ∈R .
Therefore,
y = y(t) =
1
z(t) =
2t
t2 + c ,
c ∈R
to which we have to add y(t) = 0.
b) We have
p(t) = t log t ,
q(t) = 1
t ,
α = −1 .
Set z = y2, so z′ = 2yy′ and the equation reads
z′ = 2
t z + 2t log t .
Integrating the linear equation in z thus obtained, we have
z = z(t) = t2(log2 t + c) ,
c ∈R .
Therefore,
y = y(t) = ±t
#
log2 t + c ,
c ∈R .
5. The ODE is separable. The constant solution y = 0 is not valid because it fails
the initial condition y(0) = 1. By separating variables we get

Then
log |1 −ey| = 1

integral:
y = log

It can be made into a Bernoulli equation by taking

Set z = z(t) = y3, so that z′ = 3y2y′ and z′ = 3

z = z(t) = ce(3/2)t −t −2

Therefore

f is Lipschitz in y on every Ω where
1
2√t+y is bounded. Since
sup
t∈(α,β), y∈(γ,δ)
1
2√t + y =
1
2√α + γ ,
the condition holds for any real α, γ such that α + γ > 0. The end-points β, δ are
completely free, and may also be +∞.

so

 ≤1 on R2. Hence f is Lipschitz on D = R2, and every solution exists
on the whole I = R.

500
10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
b) The map f is certainly diﬀerentiable on Rn, with continuous partial derivatives
(as composites of C1 elementary functions; besides, the denominator is never
zero). Partial derivatives are thus bounded by Weierstrass’ Theorem, making
f locally Lipschitz on Rn. Moreover,
∥f(y)∥≤
1
(log 2)3 ∥y∥,
∀y ∈Rn .
Therefore Theorem 10.19 holds, and any solution exists on I = R.
20. Existence of ﬁrst integrals:
a) As y·f(y) = 0 the equation is conservative, so Φ(y) = 1
2∥y∥2 is a ﬁrst integral
(Example 10.22 i)).
b) Since div f(y) = 8y1y3
2 + 2y2 −(8y1y3
2 + 2y2) = 0 on R2, f is a curl, and the
equation admits a ﬁrst integral Φ such that curl Φ = f. Then
∂Φ

= 4y2
1y3
2 + 2y1y2 ,
−∂Φ

integrating the ﬁrst gives
Φ(y) = y2

2 + y1y2
2 + c(y1) ,
and using the second we ﬁnd c(y1) = constant. Hence a family of ﬁrst integrals
is
Φ(y) = y2

a) y(t; c1, c2) = c1e−t + c2e−2t + 1

b) We solve ﬁrst the homogeneous equation. The characteristic equation λ2−4λ+
4λ = 0 has one double solution λ = 2, so the general homogeneous integral will
be
y0(t; c1, c2) = (c1 + c2t)e2t ,
c1, c2 ∈R .
Since μ = λ = 2, we look for a particular integral yp(t) = αt2e2t. This gives
2αe2t = e2t
by substitution, hence α = 1
2. Therefore yp(t) = 1
2t2e2t and the general integral
is
y(t; c1, c2) = (c1 + c2t)e2t + 1
2t2e2t ,
c1, c2 ∈R .

10 Ordinary diﬀerential equations
c) The characteristic equation λ2 + 1 = 0 has discriminant Δ = −4, so σ = 0 and
ω = 1. The general integral of the homogeneous equation is
y0(t; c1, c2) = c1 cos t + c2 sin t ,
c1, c2 ∈R .
As μ = σ = 0, we need to ﬁnd a particular integral yp(t) = t(α cos t + β sin t).
By substitution,
−2α sin t + 2β cos t = 3 cost ,
so α = 0 and β = 3
2. Therefore yp(t) = 3
2t cos t and the general integral is
y(t; c1, c2) = c1 cos t + c2 sin t + 3
2t cos t ,
c1, c2 ∈R .
d) y(t; c1, c2) = c1et + c2e2t −tet , c1, c2 ∈R .
e) The characteristic equation λ2 −9 = 0 is solved by λ = ±3. Hence the general
integral of the homogeneous ODE is
y0(t; c1, c2) = c1e−3t + c2e3t ,
c1, c2 ∈R .
The particular integral must have form yp(t) = αte−3t, so substituting,
−6αe−3t = e−3t ,
hence α = −1
6. Therefore yp(t) = −1
6te−3t and the general integral of the
equation is
y(t; c1, c2) = c1e−3t + c2e3t −1
6te−3t ,
c1, c2 ∈R .
f) y(t; c1, c2) = c1e−t + c2e3t + 1

29. Cauchy problems:
a) y(t) = e−t sin 2t .
b) Let us treat the homogeneous equation ﬁrst. The characteristic equation λ2 −
5λ + 4 = 0 gives λ = 1, λ = 4. Thus the homogeneous general integral is
y0(t; c1, c2) = c1et + c2e4t ,
c1, c2 ∈R .
Substituting the particular integral yp(t) = αt + β in the equation we ﬁnd
−5α + 4αt + 4β = 2t + 1 ,
so α = 1
2 and β = 7
8. Therefore yp(t) = 1

y(t; c1, c2) = c1et + c2e4t + 1

c1, c2 ∈R .

30. Linear ODEs of order n:
a) The characteristic polynomial χ(λ) = λ3 + λ2 −2 has a real root λ1 = 1 and
two complex-conjugate zeroes λ2,3 = −1 ± i. Then the general integral, in real
form, is
y(t) = c1et + c2e−t cos t + c3e−t sin t ,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R .
b) y(t) = c1et + c2tet + c3 ,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R .
c) The characteristic polynomial χ(λ) = λ4 −5λ3 +7λ2 −5λ+6 has roots λ1 = 2,
λ2 = 3, λ3,4 = ±i. The homogeneous general integral is thus
y0(t) = c1e2t + c2te3t + c3 cos t + c4 sin t ,
c1, c2, c3, c4 ∈R .
Because of resonance, we search for a particular integral of type
yp(t) = t(α sin t + β cos t) .
Diﬀerentiating, substituting in the ODE and comparing terms produces the
system
 α + β = 0 ,
10α −10β = 1 ,
whence
 α = 1/20 ,
β = −1/20 .
In conclusion,
y = y(t) = y0(t) + 1
20t(sin t −cos t)
is the general integral.
31. The associated homogeneous equation has general integral
y0(t) = c1e2t + c2e−3t ,
as one easily sees. The particular integral of the equation depends on k. In fact,

33. The characteristic polynomial
χ(λ) = λ3 −2λ2 + 49λ −98 = (λ −2)(λ2 + 49)
has roots λ1 = 2, λ2,3 = ±7i. The homogeneous integral reads
y0(t) = c1e2t + c2 cos 7t + c3 sin 7t ,
c1, c2, c3 ∈R .
Putting b1(t) = 48 sin t and b2(t) = (β2 + 49)eβt, by the principle of superposition
we begin with a particular integral of the equation with source b1 of the form
yp1(t) = a cost + b sin t. This will give a = −1/5 and b = −2/5.
The other term b2 depends on the parameter β. When β ̸= 2, we want a
particular integral yp2(t) = aeβt. Proceeding as usual, we obtain a = 1/(β −2).
When β = 2, the particular integral will be yp2(t) = ate2t and in this case we ﬁnd
a = 1. So altogether, the general integral is

Complements on diﬀerential calculus
In this appendix, the reader may ﬁnd the proofs of various results presented in
Chapters 5, 6, and 7. In particular, we prove Schwarz’s Theorem and we justify
the Taylor formulas with Lagrange’s and Peano’s remainders, as well as the rules
for diﬀerentiating integrals. At last, we prove Dini’s implicit function Theorem in
the two dimensional case.
A.1.1 Diﬀerentiability and Schwarz’s Theorem
▶Proof of Proposition 5.8, p. 163
Proposition 5.8 Assume f admits continuous partial derivatives in a neigh-
bourhood of x0. Then f is diﬀerentiable at x0.
Proof. For simplicity we consider only the case n = 2.
Let then x = (x, y) be a point in the neighbourhood of x0 = (x0, y0) where the
hypotheses hold. Call (h, k) = (x −x0, y −y0); we must prove that for (h, k) →
(0, 0),
f(x0 + h, y0 + k) = f(x0, y0) + ∂f
∂x(x0, y0)h + ∂f
∂y (x0, y0)k + o(

h2 + k2) .
Using the ﬁrst formula of the ﬁnite increment for the map x →f(x, y0) gives
f(x0 + h, y0) = f(x0, y0) + ∂f
∂x(x0, y0)h + o(h) ,
h →0 .
At the same time, Lagrange’s Mean Value Theorem tells us that y →f(x0 + h, y)
satisﬁes
f(x0 + h, y0 + k) = f(x0 + h, y0) + ∂f
∂y (x0 + h, y)k

A.1 Complements on diﬀerential calculus
for some y = y(h, k) between y0 and y0 + k. Since ∂f
∂y is continuous on the neigh-
bourhood of (x0, y0), we have
∂f
∂y (x, y) = ∂f
∂y (x0, y0) + o(1) ,
(x, y) →(x0, y0) ,
and because (x0 + h, y) →(x0, y0) for (h, k) →(0, 0), we may write
∂f
∂y (x0 + h, y) = ∂f
∂y (x0, y0) + o(1) ,
(h, k) →(0, 0) .
In conclusion, when (h, k) →(0, 0),
f(x0 + h, y0 + k) = f(x0, y0) + ∂f
∂x(x0, y0)h + ∂f
∂y (x0, y0)k + o(h) + o(1)k .
But o(h) + o(1)k = o(

▶Proof of Schwarz’s Theorem, p. 168
Theorem 5.17 (Schwarz) If the mixed partial derivatives
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
and
∂2f
∂xi∂xj
(j ̸= i) exist on a neighbourhood of x0 and are continuous at x0,
they coincide at x0.
Proof. For simplicity let us only consider n = 2. We have to prove
∂2f
∂y∂x(x0, y0) = ∂2f
∂x∂y(x0, y0) ,
under the assumption that the derivatives exist on a neighbourhood Br(x0, y0) of
x0 = (x0, y0) and are continuous at x0.
Let x = (x, y) ∈Br(x0, y0) and set (h, k) = (x −x0, y −y0). Consider the
function
g(h, k) = f(x0 + h, y0 + k) −f(x0 + h, y0) −f(x0, y0 + k) + f(x0, y0) .

A.1.2
Taylor’s expansions
513
Putting ϕ(x) = f(x, y0 + k) −f(x, y0) we see that
g(h, k) = ϕ(x0 + h) −ϕ(x0) .
The second formula of the ﬁnite increment for the function x →ϕ(x) gives a point
ξ = ξ(h, k), between x0 and x0 + h, for which
g(h, k) = hϕ′(ξ) = h
∂f
∂x(ξ, y0 + k) −∂f
∂x(ξ, y0)

.
Let us use the same formula again, this time to ψ(y) = ∂f
∂x(ξ, y), to obtain a point
η = η(h, k) between y0 and y0 + k such that
∂f
∂x(ξ, y0 + k) −∂f
∂x(ξ, y0) = k ∂2f
∂y∂x(ξ,η )
and so
g(h, k) = hk ∂2f
∂y∂x(ξ,η ) .
Now letting (h, k) →(0, 0) we have (ξ,η ) →(x0, y0); therefore, since
∂2f
∂y∂x is
continuous at (x0, y0), we will have
lim
(h,k)→(0,0)
g(h, k)
hk
=
lim
(ξ,η)→(x0,y0)
∂2f
∂y∂x(ξ,η ) = ∂2f
∂y∂x(x0, y0) .
(A.1.1)
But we can write g as
g(h, k) = f(x0+h, y0+k)−f(x0, y0+k)−f(x0+h, y0)+f(x0, y0) = ˜ψ(y0+k)−˜ψ(y0) ,
having put ˜ψ(y) = f(x0 + h, y) −f(x0, y). Swapping the variables and proceeding
as before gives
lim
(h,k)→(0,0)
g(h, k)
hk
= ∂2f
∂x∂y(x0, y0) .
(A.1.2)
Since the limit on the left in (A.1.1) and (A.1.2) is the same, the equality follows.

A.1.2 Taylor’s expansions
▶Proof of Theorem 5.20, p. 172
Theorem 5.20 A function f of class C2 around x0 admits at x0 the Taylor
expansion of order one with Lagrange’s remainder:
f(x) = f(x0) + ∇f(x0) · (x −x0) + 1
2(x −x0) · Hf(x)(x −x0) ,
where x is interior to the segment S[x, x0].

514
A.1 Complements on diﬀerential calculus
Proof. Set Δx = x −x0 = (Δxi)1≤i≤n for simplicity. We consider the function
of one real variable ϕ(t) = f(x0 + tΔx), deﬁned around t0 = 0, and show it
is diﬀerentiable twice around 0. In that case we will ﬁnd its Taylor expansion of
second order. Property 5.11 ensures that ϕ is diﬀerentiable on some neighbourhood
of the origin, with
ϕ′(t) = ∇f(x0 + tΔx) · Δx =
n

i=1
Δxi
∂f
∂xi
(x0 + tΔx) .
Now set ψi(t) = ∂f
∂xi (x0 + tΔx) and use Property 5.11 on them, to obtain
ψ′

∂xi

(x0 + tΔx) · Δx =
n

j=1
∂2f

This implies ϕ can be diﬀerentiated twice, and also that

j=1
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(x0 + tΔx)Δxj
= Δx · Hf(x0 + tΔx)Δx ,
as Hf is symmetric.
The Taylor expansion of ϕ of order two, centred at t0 = 0, and computed at t = 1
reads
ϕ(1) = ϕ(0) + ϕ′(0) + 1
2ϕ′′(t)
con
0 < t < 1 ;
substituting the expressions of ϕ′(0) and ϕ′′(t) found earlier, and putting x =
x0 + tΔx, proves the claim.

▶Proof of Theorem 5.21, p. 172
Theorem 5.21 A function f of class C2 around x0 admits at x0 the following

in the quadratic part on the right-hand side of (5.15). As the second derivative of
f is continuous at x0 and x belongs to the segment S[x, x0], we have
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(x) =
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(x0) + ηij(x) ,
where lim
x→x0 ηij(x) = 0. Hence
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(x)ΔxiΔxj =
∂2f
∂xj∂xi
(x0)ΔxiΔxj + ηij(x)ΔxiΔxj .
We will prove the last term is in fact o(∥Δx∥2); for this, we recall that 0 ≤
(a −b)2 = a2 + b2 −2ab for any pair of real numbers a, b, so that ab ≤1
2(a2 + b2).
Now note that the following inequalities hold
|Δxi| |Δxj| ≤1
2(|Δxi|2 + |Δxj|2) ≤1
2∥Δx∥2 ,
so
0 ≤|ηij(x)ΔxiΔxj|
∥Δx∥2
≤1
2|ηij(x)|
and then
lim
x→x0
ηij(x)ΔxiΔxj
∥Δx∥2
= 0 .
In summary,

whence the result.

below.
Theorem A.1.1 (Heine-Cantor) Let f : dom f ⊆Rn →Rm be a continu-
ous map on a compact set Ω ⊆dom f. Then f is uniformly continuous on
Ω.
Proof. The proof is similar to what we saw in the one dimensional case, using
the multidimensional version of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem (see Vol. I, Ap-

case where x0 is an end-point). Then there is a σ > 0 such that [x0−σ, x0 +σ] ⊂I;
the rectangle E = [x0 −σ, x0 + σ] × J isa compact set in R2.
Let us begin by proving the continuity of f at x0. As we assumed g continu-
ous on R, hence on the compact subset E, Heine-Cantor’s Theorem implies g
is uniformly continuous on E. Hence, for any ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
|g(x1) −g(x2)| < ε for any pair of points x1 = (x1, y1), x2 = (x2, y2) in E with
∥x1 −x2∥< δ. We may assume δ < σ. Let now x ∈[x0 −σ, x0 + σ] be such that
|x −x0| < δ; for any given y in [a, b], then,
∥(x, y) −(x0, y)∥= |x −x0| < δ ,
so |g(x, y) −g(x0, y)| < ε. Therefore
|f(x)−f(x0)| =

As for diﬀerentiability at x0, in case ∂g

observe

Given y ∈[a, b], we can use The Mean Value Theorem (in dimension 1) on x →
g(x, y). This gives a point ξ between x and x0 for which
g(x, y) −g(x0, y)
x −x0

∂x(ξ, y) .
By assumption, ∂g
∂x is uniformly continuous on E (again by Heine-Cantor’s The-

▶Proof of Theorem 6.18, p. 215
Proposition 6.18 If α and β are continuous on I, the map f deﬁned by (6.15)
is continuous on I. If moreover g admits continuous partial derivative ∂g

Proof. The only thing to prove is the continuity of f, because the rest is shown
on p. 215.
As in the previous argument, we may ﬁx x0 ∈I and assume it is an interior
point. Call E = [x0−σ, x0+σ]×J ⊂R, the set on which g is uniformly continuous.
Let now ε > 0; since g is uniformly continuous on E and by the continuity of the
maps α and β on I, there is a number δ > 0 (with δ < σ) such that |x −x0| < δ
implies
|g(x, y) −g(x0, y)| < ε ,
for all y ∈J ,
and
|α(x) −α(x0)| < ε ,
|β(x) −β(x0)| < ε .

A.1.4 The Implicit Function Theorem
▶Proof of Theorem 7.1, p. 263
Teorema 7.1 Let Ω be a non-empty open set in R2 and f : Ω →R a C1 map.
Assume at the point (x0, y0) ∈Ω we have f(x0, y0) = 0. If ∂f
∂y (x0, y0) ̸= 0,
there exists a neighbourhood I of x0 and a function ϕ : I →R such that:
i)

x,ϕ (x)

∈Ω for any x ∈I;
ii) y0 = ϕ(x0);
iii) f

(A.1.3)
On a neighbourhood of (x0, y0) moreover, the zero set of f coincides with the
graph of ϕ.
Proof. Since the map fy = ∂f
∂y is continuous and non-zero at (x0, y0), the local
invariance of the function’s sign (§ 4.5.1) guarantees there exists a neighbourhood
A ⊆Ω of (x0, y0) where fy ̸= 0 has constant sign. On a such neighbourhood the
auxiliary map g(x, y) = −fx(x, y)/fy(x, y) is well deﬁned and continuous.

A.1.4
The Implicit Function Theorem
519
Consider then the Cauchy problem (Section 10.4)
{ y ′ = g(x, y)y(x0) = y0 .
This admits, by Peano’s Theorem 10.10, a solution y = ϕ(x) deﬁned and of class
C1 on a neighbourhood I of x0 such that

x,ϕ (x)

∈A for any x ∈I. Thus
conditions i) and ii) hold; but then also iv) is satisﬁed, by deﬁnition of solution
to the diﬀerential equation. As for iii), we deﬁne the map h(x) = f

so it is constant; but as h(x0) = f(x0, y0) = 0, h is necessarily the zero map,
wherefore iii).

as a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Vol. I, Cor. 9.42)
applied to y →f(x, y). The integral vanishes if and only if y = ϕ(x), because
the integrand is always diﬀerent from 0 (recall the property stated in Vol. I,
Thm. 9.33 iii)). Therefore on the neighbourhood of (x0, y0) where x ∈I we have
f(x, y) = 0 precisely when y = ϕ(x).

A.2
Complements on integral calculus
In this appendix, we ﬁrst introduce the notion of norm of a function, illustrated by
several examples including norms of integral type. Next, we justify the Theorems
of Gauss, Green and Stokes; for the sake of clarity, we conﬁne our discussion to
the case of speciﬁc, yet representative, geometries. The proof of the equivalence
between conservative ﬁelds and irrotational ﬁelds in simply connected domains
is the subsequent result. In the last section, we brieﬂy outline the language of
diﬀerential forms, and we express various properties of vector ﬁelds, discussed in
the text, using the corresponding terminology.
A.2.1 Norms of functions
The norm of a function is a non-negative real number that somehow provides
a measure of the “size” of the function. For instance, if f is a function and ˜f
is another function approximating it, the norm of the diﬀerence f −˜f gives a
quantitative indication of the quality of the approximation: a small value of the
norm corresponds, in a suitable sense, to a good approximation of f by means
of ˜f.
Deﬁnition A.2.1 Given a family F of real functions deﬁned on a set Ω ⊆
Rn, that forms a vector space, we call norm a map from F to R, denoted by
f →∥f∥, that fulﬁlls the following properties: for all f, g ∈F and all α ∈R
one has
i) ∥f∥≥0 and ∥f∥= 0 if and only if f = 0 (positivity);
ii) ∥αf∥= |α|∥f∥(homogeneity);
iii) ∥f + g∥≤∥f∥+ ∥g∥(triangle inequality).
Note the analogy with the properties that deﬁne a norm over vectors in Rn.

A.2 Complements on integral calculus
Remarkable examples of norms of functions are as follows. If F denotes the
vector space of the bounded functions on the set Ω, it is easily checked that
∥f∥∞,Ω = sup
x∈Ω
|f(x)|
is a norm, called the supremum norm or inﬁnity norm. It has been introduced
in Sect. 2.1 for Ω = A ⊆R. If in addition Ω is a compact subset of Rn and we
restrict ourselves to consider the continuous functions on Ω, namely f ∈C0(Ω),
then the supremum in the previous deﬁnition is actually a maximum, as the func-
tion |f(x)| is continuous on Ω and Weierstrass’ Theorem 5.24 applies to it. So we
deﬁne
∥f∥C0(Ω) = max
x∈Ω |f(x)| = ∥f∥∞,Ω ,
which is called the maximum norm in the space C0(Ω).
Other commonly used norms are those of integral type, which measure the size
of a function “in the average”. If Ω is a measurable set and F is the vector space
of all Riemann-integrable functions on Ω (recall Theorem 8.20), we may deﬁne the
absolute-value norm, or 1-norm, as
∥f∥1,Ω =

Ω
|f(x)| dx
as well as the quadratic norm, or 2-norm, as
∥f∥2,Ω =
	
Ω
|f(x)|2 dx

1/2
.
The latter norm has been introduced in Sect. 3.2 for Ω = [0, 2π] ⊂R. The two
integral norms deﬁned above are instances in the family of p-norms, with real
1 ≤p < +∞, deﬁned as
∥f∥p,Ω =
	
Ω
|f(x)|p dx

1/p
.
The quadratic norm is particularly important, since it is associated to a scalar
product between integrable functions; its deﬁnition is
(f, g)2,Ω =

Ω
f(x)g(x) dx,
and one has ∥f∥2,Ω =

(f, f)2,Ω . In general, the following deﬁnition applies.

A.2.1
Norms of functions
523
Deﬁnition A.2.2 A scalar product (or inner product) in F is a map
from F × F to R, denoted by f, g →(f, g), that fulﬁlls the following properties:
for all f, g, f1, f2 ∈F and all α,β ∈R one has
i) (f, f) ≥0 and (f, f) = 0 if and only if f = 0 (positivity);
ii) (f, g) = (g, f) (symmetry);
iii) (αf1 + βf2, g) = α(f1, g) + β(f2, g) (linearity).
It is easily checked that the quantity ∥f∥= (f, f)1/2 is a norm, called the norm
associated with the scalar product under consideration. It satisﬁes the Cauchy-
Schwarz inequality
|(f, g)| ≤∥f∥∥g∥,
∀f, g ∈F .
A scalar product allows us to deﬁne the concept of orthogonality between
functions: two functions f, g ∈F are called orthogonal if (f, g) = 0. In a vector
space endowed with a scalar product, the Theorem of Pythagoras holds; it is
expressed by the relation
∥f + g∥2 = ∥f∥2 + ∥g∥2
if and only if
(f, g) = 0 .
Indeed, one has
∥f + g∥2 = (f + g, f + g)
= (f, f) + (f, g) + (g, f) + (g, g)
= ∥f∥2 + 2(f, g) + ∥g∥2 ,
whence the equivalence.
Going back to norms, for a diﬀerentiable function it may be useful to measure
the size of its derivatives, in addition to that of the function. For instance, if Ω
is a bounded open set in Rn, consider the vector space C1(Ω) of the functions of
class C1 on the compact set Ω (see Sect. 5.4); then, it is natural to deﬁne therein
the norm
∥f∥C1(Ω) = ∥f∥C0(Ω) +
n

i=1
∥Dxif∥C0(Ω) .
If the maximum norms in this deﬁnition are replaced by norms of integral type
(such as the quadratic norms of f and its ﬁrst-order partial derivatives Dxif), we
obtain the so-called Sobolev norms.

▶Proof of Stokes’ Theorem, p. 396
Theorem 9.37 (Stokes) Let Σ ⊂R3 be an S-admissible compact surface
oriented by the unit normal n; correspondingly, let the boundary ∂Σ be oriented
positively. Suppose the vector ﬁeld f, deﬁned on an open set A ⊆R3 containing
Σ, is such that f ∈

C1(A)
3. Then

Σ
(curl f) · n =
4
∂Σ

In other words, the ﬂux of the curl of f across the surface equals the path
integral of f along the surface’s (closed) boundary.
Proof. We start with the case in which Σ is the surface (9.15) from Example 9.29,
whose notations we retain; additionally, let us assume the function ϕ belongs to
C2(R). Where possible, partial derivatives will be denoted using subscripts x, y, z,
and likewise for the components of normal and tangent vectors. Recalling (9.13)
and the expression (9.16) for the unit normal of Σ, we have

Σ
(curl f) · n =

R
(f2,z −f3,y)ϕx + (f3,x −f1,z)ϕy + (f2,x −f1,y) dx dy

R
−(f1,y + f1,zϕy) + (f2,x + f3,zϕx) + (f3,xϕy −f3,yϕx) dx dy ,
where the derivatives of the components of f are taken on

x, y,ϕ (x, y)

as (x, y)
varies in R. By the chain rule f1,y + f1,zϕy is the partial derivative in y of the
map f1

x, y,ϕ (x, y)

; similarly, f2,x + f3,zϕx represents the partial x-derivative of
the map f2

x, y,ϕ (x, y)

. Moreover, adding and subtracting f3,zϕxϕy +f3,yϕ2
xy to
formula f3,xϕy −f3,yϕx, we see that this expression equals

γ1(t), γ2(t), ϕ(γ1(t), γ2(t))

is a positive parametrisation of ∂Σ with respect to
the chosen orientation of Σ. The corresponding tangen vector is given by (9.17).

free. Let us deal with the opposite implication.
First, though, we handle the two-dimensional case, and prove condition iii) of

(the sign on the second integral is determined by the orientation of Γ). Should the
arc be not simple, we can decompose it in closed simple arcs to which the result
applies.
Now let us consider the three-dimensional picture, for which we discuss only
the case of star-shaped sets; build explicitly the potential f, in analogy to–and
using the notation of–the proof of Theorem 9.42. Precisely, if P0 is the point for
which Ω is star-shaped, we deﬁne the potential at P of coordinates x by setting
ϕ(x) =

Γ[P0,P ]
f · τ
where Γ[P0,P ] is the segment joining P0 and P. We claim grad ϕ = f, and will
prove it for the ﬁrst component only. So let P + ΔP = x + Δx1 e1 ∈Ω be a
nearby point to P, Γ[P0,P +ΔP ] the segment joining P0 to P + ΔP, and Γ[P,P +ΔP ]
the (horizontal) segment from P to P + ΔP. We wish to prove

(A.2.5)
But this is straightforward if P0, P and P + ΔP are collinear. If not, they form a
triangle Σ, which is entirely contained in Ω, the latter being star-shaped. Calling Γ
the boundary of Σ oriented from P0 to P along Γ[P0,P ], we invoke Stokes’ Theorem
and have

A.2.3 Diﬀerential forms
In this section, we introduce a few essential notions about diﬀerential forms;
through them, it is possible to reformulate various deﬁnitions and relevant prop-
erties of vector ﬁelds, that we encountered in previous chapters. The forthcoming
exposition is deliberately informal and far from being complete; our goal indeed is
just to establish a relation between certain notations adopted in this textbook and
the language of diﬀerential forms, which is commonly used in various applications.
Let us assume to be in dimension 3; as usual, the reduction to dimension
2 is straightforward, while several concepts may actually be formulated in any
dimension n. So, in the sequel Ω will be an open set in R3.
A diﬀerential 0-form F is, in our notation, a real-valued function (also called
a scalar ﬁeld) ϕ = ϕ(x, y, z) deﬁned in Ω, i.e.,
F = ϕ .
A diﬀerential 1-form ω is an expression like
ω = P dx + Q dy + R dz ,
where P = P(x, y, z), Q = Q(x, y, z) and R = R(x, y, z) are scalar ﬁelds deﬁned
in Ω. In our notation, it corresponds to the vector ﬁeld
f = P i + Q j + R k .
Thus, the symbols dx, dy and dz denote particular 1-forms, that span all the oth-
ers by linear combinations. They correspond to the vectors i, j and k, respectively,
of the canonical basis in R3.
An expression like

Γ
ω =

Γ
(P dx + Q dy + R dz) ,
where Γ is an arc contained in Ω, corresponds in our notation to the path integral

Γ
f · τ .
Formally, the relationship may be motivated by multiplying and dividing by dt
under the integral sign,

Γ
ω =

Γ
	
P dx
dt + Q dy
dt + R dz
dt

dt
and thinking of γ(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) as the parametrization of the arc Γ (re-
call (9.8) and (9.10)).

A.2 Complements on integral calculus
The derivative of a 0-form F is deﬁned as the 1-form
dF = ∂ϕ
∂x dx + ∂ϕ
∂y dy + ∂ϕ
∂z dz ,
obviously assuming the scalar ﬁeld ϕ diﬀerentiable in Ω. In our notation, this
relation is expressed as
f = grad ϕ .
A diﬀerential 1-form ω is called exact if there exists a 0-form F such that
ω = dF .
In our notation, this is equivalent to the property that the vector ﬁeld f associated
with the form ω is conservative.
It is possible to deﬁne the derivative of a 1-form ω = P dx + Q dy + R dz as
the 2-form
dω =
	∂R
∂y −∂Q
∂z

dy∧dz +
	∂P
∂z −∂R
∂x

dz∧dx +
	∂Q
∂x −∂P
∂y

dx∧dy .
If we identify the symbols dx, dy and dz with the vectors of the canonical basis in
R3 and we formally interpret the symbol ∧as the external product of two vectors
(recall (4.5)), then we have dy ∧dz = dx, dz ∧dx = dy and dx ∧dy = dz; this
shows that, with respect to our notation, the diﬀerential form dω is associated
with the vector ﬁeld
g = curl f
(recall (6.4)). In general, for a diﬀerential 2-form
Ψ = S dy∧dz + T dz∧dx + U dx∧dy ,
where S = S(x, y, z), T = T (x, y, z) and U = U(x, y, z) are scalar ﬁelds, it is
possible to deﬁne the integral

Σ
Ψ
over a surface Σ contained in Ω; it corresponds, in our notation, to the ﬂux integral

Σ
g · n
(recall (9.14)), where g = Si + T j + Uk is the vector ﬁeld associated with the
form Ψ. In particular, we have

Σ
dω =

Σ
(curl f) · n .

A.2.3
Diﬀerential forms
531
Hence, in the language of diﬀerential forms, Stokes’ Theorem 9.37 takes the elegant
expression

Σ
dω =

∂Σ
ω .
A diﬀerential 1-form ω is called closed if
dω = 0 ;
in our notation, this corresponds to the property that the vector ﬁeld f associated
with the form is irrotational, i.e., it satisﬁes
curl f = 0 .
One has the property
d2F = d (dF) = 0
that in our notation is equivalent to the identity
curl grad ϕ = 0
(recall Proposition 6.7). Such a property may be formulated as
an exact diﬀerential 1-form is closed
that corresponds to state that a conservative vector ﬁeld is irrotational (see Prop-
erty 9.43). If the domain Ω is simply connected, then we have the equivalence
a diﬀerential 1-form is exact if and only if it is closed
that translates into the language of diﬀerential forms our Theorem 9.45, accord-
ing to which in such a domain a vector ﬁeld is conservative if and only if it is
irrotational.
