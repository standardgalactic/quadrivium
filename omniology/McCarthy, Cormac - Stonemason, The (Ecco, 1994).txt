SCENE I 
An old victorian house in the black section of Louisville Kentucky 
in February of 1971. The inhabitants are four generations of a 
black family named Telfair. It is midnight. At curtain rise there 
is a single light burning stage right where B EN T E L F A I R  sits at 
a small table. He is a thirty-two year old black stonemason. Be­
hind him and to the right is a high basement window and the soft 
blue light from a street/amp. Outside in this light a softly falling 
snow. At far stage left is a podium or lectern at which Ben will 
speak his monologues throughout the play. It is important to note 
that the Ben we see onstage during the monologues is a double and 
to note that this double does not speak, but is only a figure designed 
to complete the scene. The purpose, as we shall see, is to give dis­
tance to the events and to place them in a completed past. The 
onstage double should nevertheless be as close to Ben in appearance 
as is practicable and the two should at all times be dressed identi­
cally. What must be kept in mind is that the performance consists 
5 

CORMAC McCARTHY 
of two separate presentations. One is the staged drama. The other 
is the monologue--<Jr chautauqua-which Ben delivers from the 
podium. And while it is true that Ben at his podium is at times 
speaking for--<Jr through-his silent double on stage, it is never­
theless a crucial feature of the play that there be no suggestion of 
communication between these worlds. In this sense it would not 
even be incorrect to assume that Ben is unaware of the staged 
drama. Above all we must resist the temptation to see the drama 
as something being presented by the speaker at his lectern, for to 
do so is to defraud the drama of its right autonomy. One could say 
that the play is an artifact of history to which the audience is made 
privy, yet if the speaker at his podium apostrophizes the figures in 
that history it is only as they reside in his memory. It is this which 
dictates the use of the podium. It locates Ben in a separate space 
and isolates that space from the world of the drama on stage. The 
speaker has an agenda which centers upon his own exoneration, 
his own salvation. The events which unfold upon the stage will 
not at all times support him. The audience may perhaps be also a 
jury. And now we can begin. As the mathematician Gauss said to 
his contemporaries: Go forward and faith will come to you. The 
podium is lit. Ben comes forward to take his place there. As he 
begins to speak, his double seated at the table onstage begins to 
write. 
BEN I always wanted to be like him. Even as a child. I was 
twelve when my grandmother died and then he came to 
6 

THE STONEMASON 
this house and I began to see him every day and my 
mother would laugh at me because I had even begun to 
walk like him. And he was eighty-five years old. 
Lights come on in the kitchen of the house at stage center. Ben 
looks up from his desk toward the kitchen-which is upstairs. The 
kitchen represents the principal set of the play. It is an oldfash­
ioned kitchen from the early 1900's with a wainscotting of 
narrow tongue-and-groove boards, a long kitchen table with 
chairs, a range, a sink, a refrigerator. An oldfashioned wood­
burning stove. At the rear are two doors, one leading outside and 
the other giving onto the bedroom of Ben's grandfather, PAP Aw. 
This door now opem and Papaw comes into the kitchen. 
He is 101 years old, small and wiry and fit. He goes to the sink 
and fills the kettle and puts it on the stove and goes to the wood­
stove and pokes up the fire. 
BEN He's come into the kitchen to fix his tea. Sometimes 
I go up and we have tea together. Three oclock in the 
morning. Nothing surprises him. He has no schedule. 
Sometimes we talk and sometimes not. Sometimes we 
talk straight through till breakfast and Mama comes 
down and she looks at us but she doesnt say anything. 
He does not need much sleep and I am like him in this 
also. 
7 

CORMAC McCARTHY 
Papaw comes back to the stove and fixes his tea and takes it to the 
table and sits down. On the table is an old leatherbound bible. 
B E N  He was an old man before I was born and I have loved 
him all my life and love him now. 
Papaw sips his tea and takes out his little wireframed glasses and 
puts them on and opens the bible. 
B E N  People believe that the stonemasons of his time were 
all like him but that was never so. Anything excellent is 
always rare. He's been a stonemason for ninety years, 
starting as a boy, mixing the old lime mortar with a hoe, 
fitting spalls. He has thought deeply about his trade and 
in this he's much out of the ordinary. His entire life's 
work lies in five counties in this state and two across the 
river in Indiana. I've spent a lot of time looking at it. 
Maybe ten percent survives. I can look at a wall or the 
foundation of a barn and tell his work from the work of 
other masons even in the same structure. If we're out in 
the truck and I point out his work to him he merely nods. 
The work he's done is no monument. The stonework out 
there at night in the snow and the man who laid that 
stone are each a form of each and forever joined. For I 
believe that to be so. But the monument is upstairs. Hav­
ing his tea. 
8 

THE STONEMASON 
Ben sits back in his chair and looks out the high window. Sound of 
a car going up the street in the muffled snow, chains clinking. He 
bends to his desk again. 
B E N  For the past two years he's been helping me build my 
house. Or rebuild it. It's the house that he grew up in. 
We go out there on week-ends. 
The kitchen and basement lights dim to black. 
B E N  Sometimes Maven and Melissa come and we have a 
picnic. Sometimes Mama too. The house is stone and it is 
laid up in the old style with lime mortar. It was built long 
before the introduction of portland cement made it pos­
sible to build with stone and yet know nothing of 
masonry. 
Lights come on downstage right revealing the exterior of the two 
storey stone farmhouse partly in ruins. At the front is a low par­
tial wall of actual stone and here Ben and Papaw are at work 
together laying stone, chipping it with hammer and chisel, pass­
ing their trowels over the work and setting the stone in place. 
B E N  For true masonry is not held together by cement but 
by gravity. That is to say, by the warp of the world. By the 
9 

CORMAC McCARTHY 
stuff of creation itself. The keystone that locks the arch is 
pressed in place by the thumb of God. When the weather 
is good we gather the stone ourselves out of the fields. 
What he likes best is what I like. To take the stone out 
of the ground and dress it and put it in place. We split 
the stones out along their seams. The chisels dink. The
black earth smells good. He talks to me about stone in 
a different way from my father. Always as a thing of con­
sequence. As if the mason were a custodian of sorts. He 
speaks of sap in the stone. And fire. Of course he's right. 
You can smell it in the broken rock. He always watched 
my eyes to see if I understood. Or to see ifl cared. I cared 
very much. I do now. According to the gospel of the true 
mason God has laid the stones in the earth for men to use 
and he has laid them in their bedding planes to show the 
mason how his own work must go. A wall is made the 
same way the world is made. A house, a temple. This gos­
pel must accommodate every inquiry. The structure of 
the world is such as to favor the prosperity of men. With­
out this belief nothing is possible. What we are at arms 
against are those philosophies that claim the fortuitous in 
mens' inventions. For we invent nothing but what God 
has put to hand. 
The lights illuminating the stone house and the workers have 
dimmed to black.

THE STONEMASON 
BEN Were it not for him I'd have become a teacher. I 
nearly did. I nearly did. 
The lights come up at the basement desk and window. In the 
kitchen. Ben sits at his desk. Papaw sits at the kitchen table read­
ing his bible. 
B E N  He never suggested that it would not be a good trade 
for me. He even encouraged me, although I knew that 
when I told him I was studying psychology he had little 
notion of what that meant. Fair enough. Psychology has 
little notion of what he means. Never did he smile at my 
pretensions. It was only when I came home after my first 
year of graduate school that I realized my grandfather 
knew things that other people did not and I began to 
clear my head of some of the debris that had accumulated 
there and I did not go back to school that fall and I did 
not go back that winter and by then I had already begun 
to learn the trade that anyone would have said I already 
knew since I'd worked at it for ten years and paid for my 
schooling with it. A trade at which I thought myself a 
master and of which I stood in darkest ignorance. And as 
I came to know him . . . As I came to know him . . .  Oh I 
could hardly believe my good fortune. I swore then I'd 
cleave to that old man like a bride. I swore he'd take 
nothing to his grave.

SCENE I I
Early the following morning. The lights are on in the kitchen and 
outside it is just graying with daylight. Papaw is sitting in his 
chair by the stove as Ben enters. 
B E N  Morning Papaw. [Pap-paw] 
PAP Aw Momin Ben. Momin. 
Ben goes to the window and looks out at the yard. There is a small 
dog sleeping by the stove and it looks up. 
B E N  What do you think? 
PAP Aw Well. Be a mite slick out I expect. 
MAM A ,  Ben's mother enters the kitchen. A bustling and some­
what harriedlooking woman in her fifties. She eyes them 
suspiciously and goes on to the stove and gets the coffee percolator 
and goes to the sink with it. 
B E N  You want to go out to the farm? 
MAMA (Speaking loudly over the sound of the faucet) He aint 
goin nowhere with you in this. 
1 2

THE STONEMASON 
Ben smiles at his grandfather. Mama turns off the faucet and 
takes the percolator to the stove. 
MAMA So dont you even start. 
PAP Aw You reckon we get out there? 
MAMA Papaw dont you pay no attention to him he aint got 
no sense. 
She puts coffee in the percolator and she takes down a large black 
skillet and spoons lard into it. 
so L D I E R  enters the kitchen. He is Ben 's sister's son, aged fifteen. 
MAMA You just the man I want to see. Get them plates and 
set the table. 
S O L D I E R  I just come in to see if they's any school today. 
MAMA No, you just come in to set the table. 
Soldier drags himself to the cupboard and takes down the plates. 
MAMA And when you get done with that holler upstairs at 
Big Ben. 
PAPAW Everthing be covered up. 
MAMA Benny I done told you all now. 
PAPAW Too cold to mix mud and that's for sure. 
B E N  I'm not going to do any work out there. I'm just going 
to haul a load of stone out.

CORMAC McCARTHY 
MAMA You·aint takin him nopl:)ce in Old Blue. That thing 
aint got no heater in it. 
There are heavy footsteps on the stairs overhead. B I G  B EN ,
Ben 's father, enters the kitchen. He is wearing slippers and a 
pair of tan gabardine slacks with suspenders over a longsleeved 
winter undershirt. He has on three or four very expensive rings 
that he wears when not working. He weighs over two hundred 
and fifty pounds and he goes to the stove with the rolling gait 
of heavy people and takes his cup and pours coffee from the per­
colator. 
MAMA That aint done perkin. 
He continues to pour and then takes up his cup and takes his 
watch out of his pocket although there is an electric clock on 
the stove and another clock on the wall. He puts the watch back 
in his pocket and shuffles back across the kitchen and out the 
door. 
B E N  (To Papaw) You want some coffee? 
PAP Aw Might have just a little coffee this mornin. 
Ben goes to the stove and takes two cups and pours coffee. Mama is 
busy cooking at the stove. In the front room ojfstage the door 
slams. 
1 4

THE STONEMASON 
B I G  B E N (Ojfstage) \Vho got the paper? 
MAMA Aint nobody got the paper. He aint run yet. 
Ben takes the cups to the woodstove and gives one to his grandfa­
ther. Mama takes a platter of sausage to the table. 
MAMA You all come on now. 
Ben and Papaw start towards the table. Soldier reaches and takes 
a patty of sausage from the platter and is on the way to his mouth 
with it when she intercepts it and puts it back on the platter and 
slaps him on the back of the head with her open hand and sets the 
platter down all in one motion as if she'd had practice at it. 
MAMA Get the chair boy, get the chair. You all come on 
now. Carlotta! Benny where's Maven? I aint cookin no 
two breakfasts. 
Ben's sister C A R L O TTA enters on her high heels dressed for 
work. Soldier brings the extra chair from its place against the 
wall and Ben goes to the door and calls downstairs for Maven. Big 
Ben appears and takes his place at the head of the table and begins 
to help his plate to eggs. Ben comes to the table and Mama brings 
the percolator from the stove and sets it on the table.

CORM AC MCCARTHY 
MAMA Carlotta, did you want to say grace? 
CARL OTTA Bless 0 Lord this food to our nourishment 
and us to thy service. Amen. 
FAM I LY Amen. 
B I G  B EN Where's Maven? 
Ben pushes his chair back and rises. 
MAMA Set still. Soldier you run downstairs and see if she 
comin to breakfast this mornin. 
B E N  I'll go. 
MAMA Maybe she sick. 
S O L D I E R  What she got? 
MAMA Just eat, boy. 
Ben exits. The family continues to eat, to pass plates. A radio on 
the sideboard is giving local news, the volume comes up slowly. 
CARL OTT A What do they say about school? 
S O L D I E R  Aint said nothin yet that I heard. 
MAMA Well you better be for findin out. 
S O L D I E R  Well let me call Jeffrey. 
MAMA How he supposed to know? 
SOLDIER Cause he the man that knows, that's how. 
C A R L  OTT A Dont smartmouth your grandmama.

CARLOTTA And dont smartmouth me either. And you 
better stay away from that boy. If he's not on his way to 
the penitentiary there's no use in having one. 
SOLDIER Shoot. 
Big Ben casts a suspicious glance at Soldier. Soldier crams a last 
forkful of food into his mouth and rises from the table. He makes 
his way around the table and goes to the telephone on the side­
board and dials a number. He stands with his back to the table 
and puts his thumb down on the receiver. He talks a little too 
loud. The family continues to eat. 
BIG BEN Pass the preserves yonder, Carlotta. 
SOLDIER Yeah. Soldier. You heard anything bout school? 
Mm hm. Aint goin be none. Called your mama? Yeah. 
On the radio too? Naw we didnt hear it. Bout half a hour 
ago? 
The telephone rings. Soldier freezes. The family at the table 
stop eating and look at Soldier. The telephone rings again. 
Carlotta and Mama rise at the same moment. Soldier holds the 
telephone away from his ear and looks at it and puts it to his 
ear again. 
SOLDIER Hello? Hello?

Ben enters the kitchen. The phone rings again. Carlotta reaches 
Soldier first. 
MAMA Fool. If l dont put a knot on your head. 
S O LDI E R  There's somethin wrong with this phone. 
Carlotta snatches the phone from him and raps him on the top of 
the head with it. 
S O LDI E R  Ow! 
CARL OTTA (Putting the receiver to her ear) Hello. Yes. Hi 
Jenny. 
Soldier goes wide around Mama, who is taking her place at the 
table again. He is holding the top of his head. 
S O LDI E R  Shit. 
B I G  B E N \Vhat did you say? 
Soldier mutters something that no one can hear. Big Ben reaches 
downtable and takes a swipe at him. Soldier ducks and falls back­
ward and the chair goes to the floor. Big Ben stands up to deal 
with him further and Mama stands up and takes Big Ben by the 
arm. 
MAMA Dont hit him on the ear you'll make him deaf like 
they done Edison in the movie

Ben shakes his head and goes back out. Soldier gets up and 
rights the chair and stands there and Big Ben subsides and 
Mama sits back down and Ben comes back into the room with 
the paper and gives it to his father who glares up at him and 
takes it. Ben sits at the table and helps his plate to eggs and sau­
sage and begins to eat. 
MAMA (To Soldier) You set down over there. You aint ex-
cused. Benny is she goin to school today? 
BEN Yes. She says she is. 
MAMA You ask her if she looked outside? 
BEN Yep. 
MAMA She sick? 
BEN (Smiling) She's sick. She's looked outside. She's 
going to school. 
MAMA Why dont you take her a cup of coffee down 
there? 
BEN I offered to but she said she didnt want any. (To Big 
Ben) I want to use your truck today.

MAMA That thing aint got no heater in it and it aint got no

Big Ben does not look up from his paper. He takes a sip of coffee 
and continues to read. 
B I G  B EN You better see if they any sand in the bed. I dont 
know where you get any at today. 
MAMA You hear that? Twenty-two degrees. 
Ben finishes his breakfast and wipes his mouth and pushes back 
his chair and rises and takes his plate to the sink and then goes to 
the door. 
B E N  Soldier.

come to stage left where a light illuminates a white sofa and a 
white chair and a coffee table. 
BEN Sit down. 
SOLDIER I aint tired. 
BEN Just sit down. 
Soldier sits wearily in the sofa and throws his arm across the back 
of it. Ben sits on the arm of the sofa. 
BEN What do you want to do that stuff for? 
SOLDIER What stuff? 
BEN That telephone business. Trying to get out of school. 
SOLDIER Maybe I dont want to go today. 
BEN You dont want to go any day. That's not the point. 
You dont have a choice. 
SOLDIER You aint my daddy. 
BEN Is there somebody leaning on you at school? 
Soldier drums his fingers on the back of the sofa in a bored 
fashion. 
BEN Is there?

of.

BEN All right. You want to go out and start the truck? 
SOLDIER Where's the keys at? 
BEN They're in it. 
Soldier gets up and goes back into the kitchen and out the back 
door. Ben watches him go, then gets up and exits offstage. We 
hear him go down the steps. In the kitchen Mama is clearing the 
table. Papaw gets up and goes to his room. 
BEN (Ojfstage) Babe, I'm gone. 
Is Melissa awake? 
Are you okay? 
All right. 
I love you. 
Ben returns to the living room and enters the kitchen. Soldier 
comes in the back door stomping the snow off his shoes. Ben goes to 
the back door and takes his coat down off a peg. He looks outside. 
Papaw is dressed in his coat and gloves and is standing by the 
woodstove holding his hat.

out.

The dog goes out. Ben and Papaw turn up their collars and pull 
on their caps and let down the earflaps. Ben watches the dog out in 
the snow. 
BEN Mama what are you going to do about this dog?

SCENE I I I
The exterior of the old stone farmhouse. Ben and Papaw bring 
stones from off stage and pile them among the stones in front of the 
house. The light comes on at the podium and Ben speaks from 
there. 
BEN To get stone for the house we also pull down old walls 
that are about to be bulldozed. Often we are given the 
stone just to haul it away. My grandfather says that you 
might learn how a watch is made by taking one apart or 
you might even be able to learn how to build a house by 
tearing one down. But tearing down stonework tells you 
nothing. The old masons would quit work if you stopped 
to watch them, but I dont think you could learn by 
watching. You couldnt learn it out of a book if there were 
any and there are not. Not one. We were taught. Gener­
ation by generation. For ten thousand years. Now in the 
memory of a single man it's been set aside as if it never 
existed. As if it had no value at all. He knows this and yet 
it seems not to bother him. 
Maven is right to be jealous of him. I know that he's 
going to die and I despise every hour not spent in his 
company.

The podium light dims to black. At the house Ben goes offitage to 
bring a stone from the truck. The old man pauses to relight his pipe. 
PAP Aw I didnt see no schoolbusses out. 
BEN (Returning with a stone) Soldier was probably trying to 
lay out of a school that wasnt going to run anyway. I dont 
know what to do about him. 
PAP Aw (Sucking at his pipe and throwing the match aside) 
Well. They was a boy killed at that school. Maybe he 
shows pretty good sense. 
BEN Maybe you're right. I knew that school was just a drug 
exchange center so I dont know why I should be sur­
prised now that the murders have started. I know he's 
making Carlotta crazy. 
PAPAW Well, the boy's daddy aint around. 
BEN I think it's his daddy that's most of his problem now. 
PAP Aw Well. Landry aint much shakes. But it take a pretty 
sorry daddy to be worse than no daddy at all. 
BEN I take it you dont rate him that sorry. 
PAP Aw A man that will work they's always hope for him. 
He can always change his ways. 
BEN Well, he does work. What about a man that wont 
work? 
PAPAW (Shaking his head) I dont believe they's nothin you 
can do for him. If they is I never saw it. (He looks ojfstage)

BEN That's.the last one. You want some tea? 
PAPAW Well that would be all right. Too early to eat 
dinner. 
Ben exits briefly ojfstage. Sound of the truckdoor opening and 
slamming and he returns with the thermos and cups and they sit 
down on the stones and Ben pours the tea. 
BEN So tell me what happened about the man's house. 
PAP Aw Oh well. They done had it made up to go out 
there. They wasnt no use to consult with me. 
BEN Is that what they call a crowbar lien? 
PAP Aw Well. I've heard it called that. 
BEN But they did it anyway. 
PAP Aw Oh yes. They went out there and pulled it down. 
They had some big bars and they pried the stones out of 
the lower courses till it give way. They was lucky it didnt 
fall on em. 
BEN Did you think they were wrong? 
PAP Aw I thought the man ought to of paid us what he 
owed us. Tearin it down didnt get nobody paid though. It 
didnt benefit nobody. 
BEN Maybe it made them feel better. 
PAP Aw Maybe. I expect it depend on how you feel in the 
first place. Stonework aint like somethin you sell to a 
man and he dont pay you you can take it back. Even a

house, you could tear it down and get the lumber. Get 
the brick. But the mason fits the stones for the place 
where they're to go and that's where they're at. They aint 
nothin to take back. You just has to destroy it. You de­
stroy you own work you aint got much use for it to start 
with, paid or not paid. 
BEN Might it not keep somebody else from not paying 
you? 
PAP Aw It might. It might keep some from hirin you too. 
They's lots of work in this world that aint never paid for. 
But the accounts gets balanced anyway. In the long run.
A man that contracts for work and then dont pay for it, 
the world will reckon with him fore it's out. With the 
worker too. You live long enough and you'll see it. 
They's a ledger kept that the pages dont never get old 
nor crumbly nor the ink dont never fade. If it dont bal­
ance then they aint no right in this world and if they aint 
then where did I hear of it at? Where did you? Only way 
it wont is you start retribution on you own. You start ret­
ribution on you own you'll be on you own. That man up 
there aint goin to help you. Aint no use even to ask. 
BEN Is that why you wouldnt go out there with them? 
PAPAW No. The reason I wouldnt go out there was just a 
plain everday reason. No man can lay stone and be think­
in bout whether he goin to have to tear it back down 
again. Aint no use to get in no such habits as that. You 
29 

CORM AC McCARTHY 
know that rp.an up there aint goin to let nothin stand fo'r­
ever noway. Not in this world he aint. And it's against 
that judgment that you got to lay stone. If you goin to lay 
it at all. 
BEN So who owns the stonework that's not paid for? 
PAP Aw Well, under the law you can get a lien on the work. 
You can claim it, but you caint take possession of it. The 
man you built it for, he can take possession of it, but he 
caint claim it. The law dont have no answer. Where men 
dont have right intentions the law caint supply em. You 
just at a dead end. 
BEN Then no one owns the work? 
PAP Aw The man's labor that did the work is in the work. 
You caint make it go away. Even if it's paid for it's still 
there. If ownership lies in the benefit to a man then the 
mason owns all the work he does in this world and you 
caint put that claim aside nor quit it and it dont make no 
difference whose name is on the paper. 
SCENE IV 
The basement. Ben at his small table. The light comes on at the 
podium. 
BEN Whose work is it? I know that there are stones in 
that house that his uncle Selman laid up. There's no 
30 

THE STONEMASON 
stone for Selman. He's buried behind the house. Some­
where on the hill. My grandfather's views must 
incorporate the life of Selman. All Selmans. These 
views appear to be some labor theory of value. But 
there's a further agenda. Because the world is made of 
stone the mason is prey to a great conceit and to what­
ever extent the look and the shape of the world is the 
work of the mason then that work exists outside of the 
claims of workers and landholders alike. Reading Marx 
in my last year of school only sent me to Hegel and 
there I found his paradigm of servant and master in 
which the master comes to suffer the inner impoverish­
ment of the idle while the servant by his labors grows 
daily in skill and wisdom. 
The house was built in 1836 and that date is cut into 
the lintel stone over the front door. The Telfairs black 
and white came here from South Carolina in the 
1820's. His father and mother were slaves as was his 
brother Harris, born 1861, and his sister Emmanuelle, 
born Christmas day of 1862. Seven days before the 
signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. The stone 
sills of the cabin where he was born are still there be­
hind the house. 
I can remember the house when it had a roof on it. 
We'd take visiting relatives out there on Sundays when I 
was a child. There were black people living in it then but

I dont know what their name was. I bought the place in 
1966, the house and forty-two acres in three separate 
parcels, and I gave him the deed at his one hundredth 
birthday party four years later. He looked at it for a long 
time. Nobody knew what it was that he was looking at. It 
got more and more quiet and finally Carlotta said: 
"What is it, Papaw?" and he had tears in his eyes and he 
just handed it to her and looked away. 
He had me promise not to disturb the pale renters 
interred on our farm but I had no intention to do so. 
He says that for himself we can just throw him out in a 
sinkhole when he quits this world. But he'll be buried 
with his ancestors black and white in full possession of 
the earth whereunder he lies. It balances out, he says. 
Yes. The arc of the moral universe is indeed long but it 
does bend toward justice. At the root of all this of 
course is the trade. As he always calls it. His craft is the 
oldest there is. Among man's gifts it is older than fire 
and in the end he is the final steward, the final custo­
dian. When the last gimcrack has swallowed up its last 
pale creator he will be out there, prefering the sun, try­
ing the temper of his trowel. Placing stone on stone in 
accordance with the laws of God. The trade was all 
they had, the old masons. They understood it both in 
its utility and in its secret nature. We couldnt read nor 
write, he says. But it was not in any book. We kept it 
32 

THE STONEMASON 
close to our hearts. We kept it close to our hearts and it 
was like a power and we knew it would not fail us. We 
knew that it was a thing that if we had it they could not 
take it from us and it would stand by us and not fail us. 
Not ever fail us.

SCENE I 
Late morning in the kitchen. Ben is standing with a cup of coffee 
looking out the window. The breakfast dishes are on the sideboard 
and there is still a plate of biscuits and other things on the kitchen 
table. Big Ben enters. He is dressed in a doublebreasted creamcol­
ored suit with a gabardine shirt the open collar of which is worn 
folded down outside the suit lapels. He carries a came/hair over­
coat over his arm and a hat in his hand. Soldier comes in from 
outside stamping the snow from his shoes. 
BIG BEN You get the rearview mirror? 
SOLDIER Done got it all. 
Big Ben rummages in his pocket and comes up with a quarter and 
doles it out to Soldier and then shrugs himself into his coat and 
buttons it and turns up the collar and puts on his hat and goes out.

Cadillac man. 
BEN He worked for it. 
SOLDIER What he think I goin to do with a quarter? 
BEN Get in half the trouble you would if he gave you fifty 
cents. 
SOLDIER (Turning away from the window) Shit. 
Ben looks after him as he crosses the kitchen and exits. He looks 
out the window and shakes his head. Ben's wife MA VEN enters 
the kitchen. She is dressed in jeans and a sweater. Ben turns and 
looks at her and smiles. 
MAVEN Hi. 
She goes to the sink and begins to wash the dishes. 
BEN Babe can you still get in those jeans? 
MA VEN These are Carlotta's. 
BEN Is she bigger than you? 
MA VEN Yes, smartie. She's bigger than me.

B E N  Work on the house. 
MA VEN How's it coming? 
B E N  Why dont you come out and see? 
MA VEN I've got a doctor's appointment at eleven. 
B E N  You could come out this afternoon. 
MA VEN Will you build a fire in the fireplace? 
B E N  The mortar's still too wet. 
Maven shakes her head. 
MAVEN No deal. 
B E N  I could build one outside. 
MAVEN Not the same thing. Are you taking Papaw with 
you? 
B E N  Yep. 
She looks past him to Papaw's door.

freezing cold doing stonework?

MAVEN Your mother would never forgive you. 
BEN I know. I've thought about that. It's just a chance I'll 
have to take. 
MA VEN She thinks you dont take care of him. I think you 
dont take care of him. 
BEN I know. He's tougher than you think. Babe I wouldnt 
take him out there if it didnt mean a lot to him. That's his 
house. He wants to see it done. He wants to do it. He sees 
it as some kind of final evidence of justice in the world. 
For him it's like the workings of Providence. 
MA VEN Has he ever said that? 
BEN (Smiling) No. 
MA VEN Do you think that? 
BEN I dont know. Maybe. I think I'd like to. 
MA VEN Soldier has his version too. What is it he says? 
What goes around comes around? 
BEN I think what Soldier has in mind is revenge. 
MAVEN Mm hm. 
BEN (Smiling) Is that what justice is? Revenge? 
MA VEN Probably it is for those being treated unjustly. 
BEN But the rain falls on the just and the unjust.

B E N  (Smiling) Is that what you learned in school? 
MA VEN That's what I learned at my mammy's knee. 
B E N  Do they talk about justice in your classes or just about 
the law? 
MA VEN Mostly the law. It's a pretty pragmatic business. I 
think that was an older generation that discussed the phi­
losophy of law. 
BEN Probably. Papaw was talking about the law yesterday. 
He says that law can only work in a just society. 
MA VEN He said that? 
BEN (Smiling) Well, more or less. It's what he meant any­
way. 
MA VEN You think his opinions are valuable because he's 
worked all his life. Isnt that a pretty romantic notion? 
B E N  Yes. It's also true. You cant separate wisdom from the 
common experience and the common experience is just 
what the worker has in great plenty. 
MA VEN Then why arent more workers wise? 
B E N  I guess for the same reason that more college profes­
sors arent wise. Thinking's rare among all classes. But a 
laborer who thinks, well, his thought seems more likely 
to be tempered with humanity. He's more inclined to 
tolerance. He knows that what is valuable in life is life. 
MA VEN And the professor?

BEN I think he's more apt to just be dangerous. Marx never 
worked a day in his life. 
MA VEN Sounds a little neat to me. 
BEN I dont have a theory about it. I think most people feel 
that books are dangerous and they're probably right. 
MA VEN I'll bear that in mind. 
BEN (Smiling) I dont think it's a problem for you. You've 
got a pretty good anchoring in reality anyway. One 
downstairs and one in here. 
He puts his hand on her stomach. 
MA VEN You've got a pretty romantic notion about moth­
erhood too. 
BEN I hope so. 
MA VEN You're a fairly strange person. I knew that when I 
married you. Have you become more strange or were 
you hiding the worst from me? 
BEN I dont hide anything from you. 
She puts the last of the dishes in the drainer and wipes her hands 
on a towel.

B E N  I know. It's mindless work. It's as easy to do fast as it 
is slow. 
MA VEN That's not just working fast.

his coat over his arm. Sound of steps on the basement stairs.

starts and the truck pulls away. The lights sweep past the kitchen 
window. Carlotta stubs out her cigarette. Mama screws up her 
nose. 
MAMA Shoo, girl. I dont see how you can puff on them 
nasty things. I'd about as soon commit fornication.

lawyer. Not in Louisville Kentucky I aint.

MAMA Amen, sister, Amen. You said a mouthful when you 
said that. (She sits heavily at the table). Aint her nor Ben 
neither one in this house no longer'n what it takes to

SCENE I I I
The kitchen, Sunday morning. The family are coming m 
from outside, returning from church. They disperse through the 
kitchen and exit, steps on the stairs both up and down, leaving 
Papaw and Ben in the kitchen. Ben is putting the kettle on. 
Papaw has taken off his overcoat and hat and laid the coat across 
the back of a kitchen chair. He has on an old fashioned dark suit, 
white shirt with tie, hightop black kid dress shoes. He sits at the 
kitchen table and puts his hat on the table. Ben is fixing tea. 
B E N  Papaw what did you think of the new minister? 
PAP Aw Well I liked him just fine. Liked him just fine. I 
didnt catch his name. 
B E N  Erickson. His name is Erickson. 
PAP Aw Erickson. I worked one time for a man named 
Erickson. He sure wasnt no minister. 
B E N (Smiling) I thought you might think he was a bit 
young for the job. 
PAPAW Well he is young. But he seemed to have good 
sense. Bein old dont shelter people from ignorance. 
Ought to, but it dont.

PAPAW Thank you Benny. Thank you. 
A lot of the old time preachers used to preach all kinds 
of foolishness. Or it was to my ears. I heard any number 
of times how when colored folks got to heaven they'd be 
white. Well that dont make no more sense than a goose 
wearin gaiters. God didnt make the colored man colored 
just to see how he'd look. There aint nothin triflin about 
God. He made everbody the color He wanted em to be 
and He meant for em to stay that way. And if that suits 
Him its got to suit me too, else I's just a damn fool. 
BEN Did you always feel that way? 
PAP Aw I think so. I know some coloreds dont, but I always 
did. It was the way I was raised. 
BEN Do you think it was easier growing up black back 
then? 
PAP Aw Many ways it was. Course in many ways it was 
easier dont matter what color you was. We lived out at 
the farm and we didnt have a whole lot of experience of 
the world. Our families, Telfair families, colored and 
white, we'd been together over a hundred year and we 
didnt encounter all that much meanness. They was good 
people and so was we. The first time I ever understood 
that the white man . . .  I was six year old and they was a 
circus show come to Louisville and Harris, he's the old­
est, he made it up for all of us to go and he got extra work 
for everbody and we saved them pennies, saved them

pennies. I think it costed a dime to get in but we raised it. 
And he carried us all over there, him and Aaron and 
Charles and me and sister Emmanuelle she come too. 
We got over there and Harris had heard about the mon­
keys and he wanted to see em awful bad and we tried to 
locate where they was at and after awhile he went up to 
this white man was sellin lemonade, soda pop, ever what 
it was, and he asked him, said Mister, can you tell us 
where the monkey cage is at? Well, course it is funny 
now. The man he looked down at all us little colored 
children and we was all barefooted and as raggedy as a 
stump full of grandaddies and he said: If you couldnt find 
your way back, what did you leave for? 
Ben laughs. Papaw smiles. 
PAP Aw We didnt know nothin about the world. Didnt 
know nothin. We was babes in the woods. (He stirs his 
tea). I went to work when I was twelve and it wasnt long 
fore I learned that a lot of what the good book said was 
ever bit as true as it was claimed. Stone aint so heavy as 
the wrath of a fool and I worked for white men and I was 
subjugated to that wrath many a time and I become very 
dissatisfied about my lot in this world. The peculiar thing 
was that the very thing that brought me to that pass was 
what led me out of it and since that time I've come to see 
that more often than not that's how the Lord works. 
48 

THE STONE MASON 
He sips his tea. They sit. 
B E N  What was it? That brought you to that pass and led 
you out of it. 
PAP Aw Just the work. Just the trade. That was all they was 
to it. All they ever was to it. I've wondered all my life 
what people outside of the trade do. I wonder it yet. 
He sips his tea. 
PAP Aw I made it a study to put up with foolishness and not 
to be made party to it. I liked the work from the first time 
I ever turned to it and I was determined that they wasnt 
goin to run me off no matter how crazy they got and they 
didnt. You had black and white masons work side by side 
on them big jobs but you was never paid the same and 
you was never acknowledged the same. But I knowed 
Uncle Selman could lay stone to beat any man on that job 
didnt make no difference what color he was and anybody 
that didnt know it was just too ignorant to count. So I 
seen that he was acknowledged if he was colored and that 
made me think again. I seen they was some things that 
folks couldnt lie about. The facts was too plain. And what 
a man was worth at his work was one of them things. It 
was just knowed to everbody from the lowest to the high­
est and they wasnt no several opinions about it. When I 
seen that I seen the way my path had to go ifl was ever to 
49 

C OR M  A C

become the. type of man I had it in my heart to be. I was 
twelve year old and I never looked back. Never looked 
back. 
B E N  What about when Uncle Selman was killed. Did that 
change your feelings? 
PAPAW No. It didnt. I was older then and I seen it for what 
it was. A man that's killed by a fool that aint never had the 
first thought in his head it aint no different from if a rock 
fell on him. It's just a sad thing to happen and they aint 
no help for it. 
B E N  You werent set crazy over it? 
PAP Aw Pret near. But they wasnt no point in me goin 
crazy. That man was not a mason. He was in charge of 
settin timbers and he picked Selman out because he was a 
small man and Selman was a big one. It was just a dispute 
that they wasnt no sense to it. Cept I knowed Selman was 
not disputatious and you couldnt get him to argue didnt 
make no difference how wrong you was and I reckon that 
made that white man crazier than what he already was. It 
was a dispute over a waterbucket and that's about as sorry 
as you can get, I reckon. Ever crew had they own buckets 
and they was marked and had stripes on em for to mark 
the white ones from the colored's. I dont know what the 
particulars was but it was over them buckets and I know 
Uncle Selman was in the right for he never would allow 
no misrepresentation of nothin. You couldnt put a gun to

his head and get him to lie and I dont care what kind of lie 
it was. He always said they was not no such a thing as a 
small lie. And that white man was all lie. And he killed 
him. He killed Uncle Selman with a timber maul, hit him 
blind side with it and laid him out graveyard dead. They 
come and got me. Oh I was a heartbroke boy. A heart­
broke boy. We picked him up out of the dirt and carried 
him out under a shadetree and he was bloody as a hog and 
I just set there under that tree with him and I cried like a 
baby. I aint ashamed to tell it. 
They sit quietly. Papaw is moved even now. 
BEN What did they do with the white man? 
PAP Aw He left this country and he stayed gone a long 
time. They was fixin to law him and he just left out. The 
boss of that job was goin to testify against him and he told 
that boss man, said: You take a nigger's part against a 
white man's? That's what he said. And Uncle Selman laid 
out dead. Said: You take a nigger's part against a white 
man's? and that boss man-his name was Johnson-he 
never even answered him. 
BEN But he came back? 
PAP Aw Yes. He come back. 
BEN And what happened then? 
PAP Aw N othin. He stayed gone I guess it was six or seven

year and then he come back and there was nothin ever 
done about it. I lawed him myself and it costed me a right 
smart but it was too late to bring him to justice. 
They sit. Papaw stirs and rises and takes his cup and his hat and 
coat. 
PAP Aw I guess I better change out of these clothes. 
He goes to the sink. 
B E N  What was the man's name? 
PAPAW That killed Uncle Selman? 
B E N  Yes. 
PAPA w Well. That's been a long time ago, Benny. Been a

Papaw puts his cup in the sink and turns.

He hangs up the phone. Osreau enters the kitchen. He is a black 
mason in his early forties, dressed in workclothes.

MAMA Carlotta did you want to say grace? 
CARL OTT A You say it Mama. 
MAMA Bless oh Lord this food to our nourishment and us 
to thy service. And please Lord send that boy back to his 
family safe and sound. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. 
FAMILY Amen. 
They raise their heads and begin to pass the platters. They eat in 
silence. Mama looks sideways at Carlotta who is eating woodenly. 
The phone rings. They freeze. They look at Carlotta. The phone 
rings again and she pushes back her chair and rises and goes to 
answer it. 
CARLOTTA Hello. Hi Jenny. No. I dont know. Ben went 
down yesterday and filled out a report. Yes. I know you 
will. I'll call you. Thanks Jenny. Bye. 
She hangs up the phone and turns back to the table. The rest of the 
family continue eating. Carlotta suddenly hurries past the table 
and out of the kitchen. They listen to her footsteps going up the 
stairs. They continue to eat. Ben wipes his mouth and gets up 
from the table and leaves the kitchen and goes upstairs. The lights 
dim in the kitchen. The lights come on stage right in Carlotta 's

CAR L  OTT A Just a minute. 
She wipes her eyes and gets up and goes to the door and opens it 
and then turns back and begins to collect her purse and her things 
to go to work, keeping her eyes averted. Ben stands just inside the 
door watching her. Outside it is just daylight and there are early 
morning street sounds. 
BEN We'll find him Carly. He's just pulled some dumb 
stunt. Chances are he'll be at school today . . .  
CARL OTT A (Turning and facing Ben) Well if he's not in jail 
and not in any of the hospitals I'd like to know where you 
think he is. 
BEN Well. I think there's a good chance he might be on his 
way to see Landry. 
CAR L OTTA Oh yeah. Fifteen year old boy on his way to 
Detroit in the dead of winter with maybe forty cents in 
his pocket. 
BEN He could be. 
She gives up looking through her purse and sits down on the 
bed and begins to cry, putting her hands to her face. Ben comes to

SCENE I 
The kitchen at night. It is late and the house is asleep. Ben is 
sitting at the table with his tea and his notebook. The light comes 
on at the podium. Ben speaks from there. 
B E N  He's not always asleep when I hear him talking in his 
room at night. I know his mind is sound but sometimes 
he forgets and I know sometimes he's half awake or even 
sitting on the edge of the bed talking to his brother 
Charles whom he loved and who fell to his death from 
the scaffolding at the construction of the Seelbach Hotel 
in the fall of 1902 . 
He-Ben's double-picks up Papaw's bible from the table and 
smells the old leather. 
B EN When they were breaking ground to build the bank 
out on the Bardstown road there was a piece in the paper 
62 

THE STONE M A SON 
about his one hundredth birthday and his letter from 
President Nixon and they called him and talked to him 
on the phone trying to get him to lay the cornerstone at. 
their ceremony or whatever it was and he would not and 
they sent the vicepresident over here to talk to him think­
ing there was some misunderstanding and he and Papaw 
sat in the front room while Mama served them coffee and 
Papaw was as polite as he could be and told him no about 
nine times and showed him to the door and Mama was 
furious with him and wanted to know why he wouldnt do 
it and he wouldnt answer and wouldnt answer and finally 
he said: I aint never laid a block of hewn stone in my life 
and I never will. You go against scripture you on you 
own. That man up there aint goin to help you. Aint no 
need to even ask. 
He sips his tea and thumbs the bible open. He turns the pages. 
BEN It took me a while to find that one. 
He leans forward at the kitchen table, reading. 
BEN And if thou make me an altar of stone thou shalt not 
build it of hewn stone, for if thou lift up thy tool upon it 
thou hast polluted it.

He turns the pƊes. 
BE N There's another place too. Somewhere here. And all 
the proscribing of graven images. \Vhy? Deuteronomy. 
His ribbon here. Pharoh. We were Pharoh's slaves in 
Egypt and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a 
mighty hand. 
He turns the pages. 
BE N And Exodus. That there may be darkness over the 
land of Egypt. Egypt and the darkness of Egypt. Ac­
cording to the old charges of the Masonic order the 
children of Israel learned masonry in Egypt. \Vhich I 
was astonished to read, having heard it from him, and 
he knows nothing of freemasonry. He says all honors 
are empty and none more than honorary masonry. Be­
cause there is nothing that will separate from the work 
itself. The work is everything, and whatever is learned 
is learned in the doing. The freemasons were right in 
their suspicion that in the mysteries of stonemasonry 
were contained other mysteries. Speculatives, they were 
called. Noblemen who were made honorary masons. 
And if it is true that laying stone can teach you rever­
ence of God and tolerance of your neighbor and love 
64 

TH E

for your family it is also true that this knowledge is in­
stilled in you through the work and not through any 
contemplation of the work. 
He rises and goes to the woodstove and adds a chunk of wood to the 
fire and shuts the door and stands looking at the flames through 
the grate. 
BEN But not ashlar. Not cut stone. All trades have their 
origin in the domestic and their corruption in the state. 
Freestone masonry is the work of free men while sawing 
stone is the work of slaves and of course it is just those 
works of antiquity most admired in the history books that 
require nothing but time and slavery for their comple­
tion. It is a priestridden stonecraft, whether in Egypt or 
Peru. Or Louisville Kentucky. I'd read a great deal in the 
Old Testament before it occurred to me that it was 
among other things a handbook for revolutionaries. That 
what it extolls above all else is freedom. There is no his­
torian and no archaelogist who has any conception of 
what stonework means. The Semitic God was a god of 
the common man and that is why he'll have no hewn 
stones to his altar. He'll have no hewing of stone because 
he'll have no slavery. 
When I showed Papaw photographs of Mayan stone­
work he only shook his head. Stretchers and headers and 
65 

C O R M  AC

quoins are . the very soul of stonemasonry and of these 
they had none. Perhaps their mortar was mixed with 
human blood as in the old ballads. Papaw knows these 
tales too. He says the only blood you'll ever need is the 
blood of your redeemer. 
He closes the stove door and returns to the table. 
B E N  And the secrecy. Always the secrecy. "Whatsoever 
thou hearest or seeist him do, tell it no man, wheresoever 
thou go." That from Guild rules of the fourteenth cen­
tury. But it wasnt just to protect the guild. The reason the 
stonemason's trade remains esoteric above all others is 
that the foundation and the hearth are the soul of human 
society and it is that soul that the false mason threatens. 
So. It's not the mortar that holds the work together. 
What holds the stone trues the wall as well and I've seen 
him check his fourfoot wooden level with a plumb bob 
and then break the level over the wall and call for a new 
one. Not in anger, but only to safeguard the true. To 
safeguard it everywhere. He says that to a man who's 
never laid a stone there's nothing you can tell him. Even 
the truth would be wrong. The calculations necessary to 
the right placement of stone are not performed in the 
mind but in the blood. Or they are like those vestibular 
reckonings performed in the inner ear for standing up-
66 

THE STONE M

right. I see him standing there over his plumb bob which 
never lies and never lies and the plumb bob is pointing 
motionless to the unimaginable center of the earth four 
thousand miles beneath his feet. Pointing to a blackness 
unknown and unknowable both in truth and in principle 
where God and matter are locked in a collaboration that 
is silent nowhere in the universe and it is this that guides 
him as he places his stone one over two and two over one 
as did his fathers before him and his sons to follow and let 
the rain carve them if it can. 
SCENE I I
The kitchen, morning. The family has just finished breakfast and 
Mama is clearing away the table. Big Ben is reading the paper 
and Carlotta is smoking a cigarette. Ben gets up from the table. 
He is wearing sport clothes, not dressed for work. He goes to the 
sink and rinses out his cup and takes his leather jacket and puts it 
on. Big Ben lowers the paper and looks at him.

B I G  B E N  You aint told me nothin.

B I G  B E N  I aint Mama. 
B EN They didnt say anything. They just take down the in­
formation. They fill out a report. They dont even list 
them as missing until they've been gone forty-eight 
hours. Then they put the report in a filing cabinet along 
with about a thousand others, kids that are missing. Miss­
ing or misplaced or lost or people just couldnt remember 
where they'd left them or maybe no one even noticed 
they were gone or maybe they had no place to be missing 
from in the first place. 
B I G  B E N  Carlotta say the truant officer callin up here 
wantin to know why he aint in school. 
B E N Sure. You think the left hand knows what the right is 
doing? Five years ago they were putting us in jail for 
sending our kids to school, now they want to jail us for 
not sending them. I've got to go. I'll be over there after 
dinner. Tell Osreau to be carrying it up on the back side 
and we'll set the lintels in the morning. Mama, Bye. 
Ben exits.

He fluffs up his paper and turns to read, quietly indignant. Car­
lotta stubs out her cigarette. 
CARL OTT A Why are you so sure he's just run away,

BIG BEN He's just that age. Lot of boys his age run 
off from home. It's just their nature. Young boy like

CAR L  OTT A Mama. Mama. Let it go. He's right anyway. 
He never made the first mention of him. I didnt even 
know there was such an uncle till I was in high school. 
Everybody in this family thinks if you dont mention 
something then it doesnt exist. There must be some huge 
skeleton left that I still dont know about. What was it? 
Was somebody a whore or a horsethief or vote Republi­
can? 
MAMA Now girl dont you start with that mouth.

Night. The kitchen. Ben sits at the table drinking tea. Lights 
sweep across the window from outside and a car pulls in and stops 
and a door opens and slams. Big Ben enters the kitchen. He takes 
off his hat and his came/hair overcoat. He is dressed in a suit with 
a sportshirt open at the neck. 
BEN Hey. 
Big Ben crosses heavily to the stove. 
BIG BEN They any coffee?

Maven to cosign though. And I dont think they're going 
to let me have any six thousand dollars. How much does 
Mama know about this? 
BIG BEN She dont need to know nothin. 
BEN Well, when they put her in the street she'll know. Her 
and her shoes. I always wondered why she had about 
forty pair of shoes. She's a provident woman. 
BIG BEN Well pile it all on my head. You and Pap both 
just walked off and left the company. Just walked off and

BEN He didnt come back. Mama walked around the house 
like a Roman stoic for weeks just as if she'd not a worry in 
the world and then one night she woke from a dream or 
from I dont know what and she cried straight through till 
breakfast and she would not be consoled and we brought 
her down to the kitchen and Maven wanted to call the 
doctor and my father tried to give her whiskey and all she 
would say was that poor child, that poor child. And 
Maven was right. It's worse than a death. More vengeful 
than a suicide. His absence is like a pall of guilt and hu­
miliation. People would say He'll come back. Or He'll 
tum up. Then they stopped saying anything. Then they 
stopped coming around. Carlotta for a long time would

not come to the dinnertable and we ate in silence and 
then she did come and we ate in more silence. His birth­
day is in two more weeks. He would be sixteen. Will be 
sixteen? In what tense do you speak of those who have 
vanished? You dont speak of them. You are simply en­
slaved to them. And Carlotta was right. I think I can 
fix everything. The simplest word of consolation sounds 
like a lie. She was right about Landry too. He did get 
married.

The light is on in the front room and in the kitchen. It is evening 
and Ben comes in the kitchen door and puts the kettle on and goes

sitting rather formally in the front room waiting for Carlotta. 
He is dressed in a suit and tie. Ben goes through and gets the 
paper and shuts the outer door ojfstage and returns with the 
paper. The visitor stands up. His name is M A S O N  F E R G U S O N .

SCENE I I I
The kitchen at night. Ben at the kitchen table with his cup of tea 
and his notebook. The light comes on at the podium and Ben takes 
his place there. 
BEN That summer Papaw and I contracted work on our 
own, just working evenings and weekends. We still 
worked on the house at the farm too but we were build­
ing old style stone chimneys and fireplaces for people and 
89

we'd take rqem on field trips and show them the old work 
and if they had souls in their bodies they would see all 
that we showed them and we were amazed at how quickly 
a love and a reverence for reality could be restored in 
them. They'd talk about what they wanted and Papaw 
would say little and smoke his pipe and they would look 
at some old chimney standing in a field and they would 
look at Papaw and they would grow more quiet them­
selves and then they would stop talking altogether and we 
would drive back and they'd ask us when we could begin. 
Sometimes if a client was really interested we'd take him 
all over the county. We'd show him work that Papaw had 
done eighty years ago. We'd show them walls and cellars 
and chimneys and houses and springhouses and bridges. 
Some of those old cellars and footings contain enormous 
stones and Papaw says it's because the houses were built 
first and you had scaffolding and teams of oxen and tackle 
and men and you could use the big stones but when you 
were building a wall you were pretty much on your own 
and you did it as you could. Most of the old slave walls as 
they are called were built in the winter when farm work 
was light. But I've seen stones in cellars and in the base of 
chimneys that would weigh two thousand pounds. I've 
seen old bridge piers built of rubble stone weighing two 
and three tons apiece and no two stones alike and laid up 
without mortar sixteen and eighteen courses high and 
90

steeply battered. I've looked at barns and houses and 
bridges and factories and chimneys and walls and in a 
thousand structures I've never seen a misplaced stone. In 
form and design and scale and structure and proportion 
I've yet to see an example of the old work that was not 
perfectly executed. They were designed by the men who 
built them and their design rose out of necessity. The 
beauty of those structures would appear to be just a sort 
of a by-product, something fortuitous, but of course it is 
not. The aim of the mason was to make the wall stand up 
and that was his purpose in its entirety. The beauty of the 
stonework is simply a reflection of the purity of the 
mason's intention. Carly says I have this mystique thing 
about stonemasonry. She says nobody understands it. 
Even my father thinks it's crazy. She says no one knows 
what I'm talking about. She says no one cares. In all this 
of course she's right. And she says you cant change his­
tory and that ruins should be left to ruin. And she's right. 
But that the craft of stonemasonry should be allowed to 
vanish from this world is just not negotiable for me. 
Somewhere there is someone who wants to know. Nor 
will I have to seek him out. He'll find me.

Mama is saying goodbye to cousins and other kin and a P H O ­
T O G RAP H E R  thanks her and shoulders up his camera and 
tripod and exits. Maven is nine months pregnant. Ben is in the 
kitchen talking to a R E P O RTE R .  The other guests all leave and 
the lights dim out in the living room and Mama goes upstairs and 
Maven goes to the basement apartment.

R E P O RT E R  I would think that would be hard to do.

in Evansville Indiana and they had twin daughters about

she'd sit down with their primers [prim-ers] and study by 
candlelight until one and two in the morning and then 
get up again at five-thirty and get breakfast for the fam­
ily. She did that for several years and then one day the 
woman-the lady of the house-went in her room and 
found some of their books there. My grandmother had a 
room up over the carriage house and she'd sneak books 
out of the house and read them at night and this woman 
found them and thought she was stealing the books to 
sell them-back then books were valuable-and she was 
going to fire her and my grandmother sat down and read 
for her and she let her stay. 
R E P O RT E R  She must have been a remarkable woman. 
B E N  She was. Later she was the first black registered nurse 
in the state of Indiana. But she read all her life. And she 
remembered what she read. She could quote poetry by 
the hour. She could quote Scott's Lady of the Lake in its 
entirety and it runs about a hundred pages. When I was 
in high school she used to help me with my algebra. It 
never occurred to me to wonder where she learned it. 
R E P O RT E R  And your grandfather. Does he read?

R E P O RT E R  Well. He certainly seems to be in remarkable 
health for a man a hundred and two years old. I know he 
gets tired of people asking him the secret of his longevity 
but I couldnt get anything out of him at all. He just said 
that somebody had to live to be a hundred and it looked 
like it was him. My guess is that it runs in the family. 
B EN Well. Not really. He had several brothers and sisters 
and they've all been dead for years. For that matter all his 
children are dead except my father. 
R E P O RT E R  I asked him how his health was and he said it 
was fine and wanted to know how mine was. I thought at 
first he was being cantankerous but he really seemed to 
want to know. I wound up telling him about my eye oper­
ation. 
Ben smiles. The reporter flips through his notebook and folds it 
away in his coat pocket. He holds out his hand. 
R E P O RT E R  Well, thank you. It was a great party.

The reporter raises a hand and exits from the kitchen. Ben goes to 
the window and looks out. The lights come on stage right where 
there are picnic tables covered with red crepe and there are lan­
terns and foldingchairs and cups and plates and the remainders of 
Papaw's birthday party. A wind has come up and it is evening 
and the buntings strung across the yard sway in the wind and a 
few cups blow across the yard. Papaw is sitting alone at the tables, 
dressed in his black suit. His hat sits on the table beside him and he 
holds it with one hand against it being blown away. The lights 
have dimmed to black in the kitchen. The light comes on at the 
podium and Ben appears there. 
B E N  I'd pretend ignorance to get you to stay. If I thought 
you could be fooled. But only people with wants can be 
fooled and you have none. 
Cups and leaves blow across the yard. The old man sits holding his 
hat. The light dims to black and the light comes up in the kitchen. 
It is night and Ben's double is sitting at the table. Ben continues to 
speak from the podium.

B E N  He always said the trade. As if there were only the
• 
one. He didnt even call it masonry. Just called it the 
work. Called it the trade. Does call it. Does call it. 
He-Ben 's double-sips his tea. 
B E N He was a journeyman mason for eighty-odd years. 
Journeyman comes from the word for day, and a journey 
was originally a day's travel. He began to contract for 
himself before my father married and he and my father 
were in business together for thirty years and technically 
they are yet. But the rule of the journeyman is his rule 
even now and he has always quit at quitting time no mat­
ter where he was on the job. The wisdom of the 
journeyman is to work one day at a time and he always 
said that any job even if it took years was made up out of a 
day's work. Nothing more. Nothing less. That was hard 
for me to learn. I always wanted to be finished. In the 
concept of a day's work is rhythm and pace and whole­
ness. And truth and justice and peace of mind. You're 
smiling. I smile. But very often now the stones come to 
hand for me as they do for him. I dont think or select. I 
build. So I begin to live in the world. Nothing is ever 
finally arrived at. The journeyman becomes a master 
when he masters the journeyman's trade. He becomes a 
master when he ceases to wish to be one.

Ben folds shut his notebook and folds his hands in front of his cup. 
B E N  As for the rest. As for the rest. I know that evil ex­
ists. I think it is not selective but only opportunistic. I 
dont know where the spirit resides. I think in all things 
rather than none. My experience is very limited. But it 
is because of him that I am no longer reduced by these 
mysteries but rather am one more among them. His life 
is round and whole but it is not discrete. Because it is 
connected to a way of life which he exemplifies but 
which is not his invention. I know nothing of God. But 
I know that something knows. Something knows or else 
that old man could not know. Something knows and 
will tell you. It will tell you when you stop pretending 
that you know.

and Mama enters the kitchen humming a spiritual and turns on 
the kitchen lights and begins to prepare breakfast. Ben puts his 
left hand on the old man's hand and withdraws his right hand 
from the old man's grasp and stands and looks down at him and 
bends and kisses him on the forehead and turns and goes into the

Ben crosses the floor and puts his arms around her and she begins 
to wail openly. 
MAMA Oh Lord Jesus no dont take that sweet man. Dont 
take him. Dont take him. 
B E N  Mama. Mama. He's already gone, Mama.

The church interior again, stage left. The family stands in front 
of the pew and the minister stands before them reading from the

said. 
SCENE I X
The kitchen, mid day. Mama is on the telephone. A car pulls in 
the driveway. Mama looks out the window. The car door opens 
and closes. 
MAMA Well. I got to go, Louise. Here come Ben in the 
middle of the day. I expect he be wantin somethin to eat. 
Well. 
She hangs up the phone and Big Ben enters the kitchen. He is 
dressed in a lightcolored suit with a shirt and tie. He looks at her 
without expression. 
MAMA Honey did you want somethin to eat? 
He crosses the room and exits and goes up the stairs.

MAMA I'm goin to fix you some of that pepper steak. 
The light comes on stage right which is Big Ben and Mama's 
bedroom. There is a double bed and a night table and a door 
which leads to the bathroom ojfstage. Big Ben enters and sits on 
the bed. He takes an envelope out of his pocket and tears it in 
several pieces and puts the pieces on the table. He opens the 
table drawer and takes out a revolver and puts it on the table. 
He rises and goes into the bathroom and turns on the light. It 
is a very white light that comes from the bathroom and there is 
the sound of water running and then he comes back into the 
room and begins to undress. He puts his watch and billfold on 
the table. He hangs his suit carefally on a hanger together with 
his tie and lays it across the bed. He crumples his shirt and 
throws it in the corner and he takes off his shoes and takes off 
his socks and garters and puts them in the shoes and puts the 
shoes under the bed. Then he rises, dressed only in very clean 
white shorts and undershirt and takes up the revolver and goes 
into the bathroom and shuts the door. Mama has been busy at 
the stove. She is reaching up to the shelf for the pepper when 
the sound of the shot reaches her. She freezes, then lowers her 
hand and turns to look at the door stage left. She crosses the 
kitchen.

The kitchen. It is empty. The woodstove remains although the 
stove pipe is lying in the floor. The windows have been boarded 
over. Ben 's pickup pulls into the drive and the truck door opens 
and closes and the kitchen door opens and Ben enters. He leaves 
the door open. He stands in the kitchen and looks around, then 
goes out and up the stairs. The light comes on stage right where 
the naked iron bedstead is the only piece of famiture left in Big 
Ben 's bedroom. Ben comes through the room and comes around 
the bed and sits slowly on the bedsprings and looks out, his hands 
clasped, his elbows on his knees. The light comes on at the podium. 
B E N  The big elm tree died. The old dog died. Things that 
you can touch go away forever. I dont know what that 
means. I dont know what it means that things exist and 
then exist no more. Trees. Dogs. People. Will that name­

But it was not this world nor will it be, for where man 
lives is in this world only. 
Ultimately there is no one to tell you if you are justified 
in your own house. 
The people I know who are honorable never think about

If I'd ransomed everything and given it all to him would 
it have saved him? 
No. 
Was I obligated to do so? 
Yes. 
Why did you not? 
Ben sitting on the bed, lowers his head. 
BEN Papaw. Papaw.

Stage left. Ben is standing on the porch of a small frame house. It 
is night and the porch light is on. He taps at the door (again). The 
door opens and MARY WEAVER-a woman in her midforties, 
not unattractive, looks out at him. She is wearing a housedress 
but she is well groomed. 
BEN Hello. Are you Mary Weaver? 
She studies him. She nods her head. 
MARY I guess you're Benny. 
BEN Yes mam. 
MARY I caint do nothin for you child. Let the dead sleep. 
BEN I just wondered if I could talk to you for a minute. 
MARY \Vhat would be the use in it? 
Ben looks away. He gestures fatiley. He is almost crying. 
BEN I'm not here to bother you Mrs Weaver. 
She shakes her head resignedly. She looks up at him. She pushes 
open the door.

two glasses. 
MARY And quit callin me mam. I aint that old. This is done

MARY Well set down. 
She pours the glasses. He sits. She takes her cigarettes from her 
housedress pocket and puts them on the table and sits down.

He sips the tea. She watches him. She sighs and reaches for the 
cigarettes.

She lights a cigarette and studies him through the smoke. 
MARY I knew when I seen you standin there you didnt 
know what it was you wanted. 
B E N  I guess I dont. It's just that you're about the only per­
son he knew that I didnt and I kept thinking that there 
must be somebody . . .  there must be somebody . . .
MARY I dont know why that poor man killed hisself. 
B E N  No. I guess you dont. 
MARY Do you? 
B E N  (Shaking his head) No. 
They sit. She smokes. 
B E N  I dont know anything about him. You live with some­
one all your life. All their life . . .  My sister's boy. Fifteen 
years old. I thought he was just a troublesome kid. He 
was involved in things I hardly knew existed. The things 
I found out I couldnt believe. Yet they were so. They 
were so. 
MARY Do you want to know what kind of man your father

he was kind and sweet and generous? And a real man too. 
Because he was. Or did you come here to find out about 
yourself. 
He looks at her. He smiles. His eyes are wet. 
B E N  I dont know. Maybe. 
MARY What did he say about me. What did he say about 
me. 
B E N  No. 
MARY He never liked to talk about things once they was 
over and done with. I see you dont favor him in that re­
spect leastways. 
She carefally stubs out the cigarette. 
MARY It wasnt the money. Been the money he been dead 
years ago. He always had money troubles. Died owin me 
four hundred dollar. 
B E N  I'll see that you get it. 
MARY What for? You dont owe it. I dont want it noway. 
B EN He never talked about his family? 
MARY Very seldom. Very seldom. Only thing I ever re­
member him to say that told me a little about his deeper 
thought was that he'd had two brothers and a sister and

they was all dead. Him bein the baby of the family I think 
he felt alone in the world someway. He was not a happy 
man, Benny. Never was. If he had of been I wouldnt of 
had him. 
BEN Did his father dying have anything to do with it? 
MARY I believe it did. But not the way you might think. 
Ben looks at her. She lights another cigarette. 
MARY I think maybe when his daddy died that give him 
leave to go on and do what he done. 
BEN You dont think he could of done it with his father 
alive. 
She blows out smoke and shakes her head. 
MARY No. No way. 
BEN But not his wife and children. 
MARY Not his wife and children. Maybe it ought to be the 
same thing, but it aint. You ought to know about that. 
That's why you here aint it? Cause you caint get around 
that daddy? Caint get around that daddy.

B E N  Because I thought of my father in death more than I 
ever did in life. And think of him yet. The weight of the 
dead makes a great burden in this world. And I know all 
of him that I will ever know. \Vhy could he not see the 
worth of that which he had put aside and the poverty of 
all he hungered for? \Vhy could he not see that he too 
was blest? 
At times I think I came to the life of the la borer as the 
anchorite to his cell and pallet. The work devours the 
man and devours his life and I thought that in the end he 
must be somehow justified thereby. That if enough of the 
world's weight only pass through his hands he must 
become inaugurated into the reality of that world in a 
way to withstand all scrutiny. A way not easily dissolved 
or set aside. Perhaps in his final avatar he might even 
come to sit holding his hat at a wooden foldingtable bor­
rowed from a church basement watching the wind cross 
the world, already beyond wind or world or anything 
which they might propagate or anything at all. 
I lost my way. I'd thought by my labors to stand out­
side that true bend of gravity which is the world's pain. I 
lost my way and ifl could tell you the hour of it or the day

or how it cai;ne about I should not have lost it at all. Sol­
dier did come back. He came back and we met secretly 
and I gave him money and sent him away again. Yet even 
before any of this I had a dream and this dream was a 
cautionary dream and a dream I did not heed. 
In my dream I had died or the world had ended and I 
stood waiting before the door of some ultimate justice 
which I knew would open for me. I stood with my job­
book beneath my arm in which were logged the hours 
and the days and the years and wherein was ledgered 
down each sack of mortar and each perch of stone and I 
stood alone in that whitened forecourt beyond which 
waited the God of all being and I stood in the full folly of 
my own righteousness and I took the book from under 
my arm and I thumbed it through a final time as if to 
reassure myself and when I did I saw that the pages were 
yellowed and crumbling and the ink faded and the ac­
counts no longer clear and suddenly I thought to myself 
fool fool do you not see what will be asked of you? How 
He will lean down perhaps the better to see you, regard­
ing perhaps with something akin to wonder that which is 
his own handiwork, He whom the firmament itself has 
not power to puzzle. Gazing into your soul beyond bone 
or flesh to its uttermost nativity in stone and star and in 
the unformed magma at the core of creation. And ask as 
you stand there alone with your book-perhaps not even

unkindly-this single question: Where are the others? 
Where are the others. Oh I've had time in great abun­
dance to reflect upon that terrible question. Because we 
cannot save ourselves unless we save all ourselves. I had 
this dream but did not heed it. And so I lost my way. 
The diningroom at the farozhouse. There is a long diningroom 
table and chairs, an antique sideboard. The table is partly cleared 
and Mama enters and takes up more plates and carries them out 
to the kitchen. Ben is sitting at the head of the table and Maven 
and Mason are sitting at the table and Carlotta enters and takes 
up some dishes to carry them to the kitchen. She is about seven 
months preg;nant. The telephone rings and Maven starts to get up 
but Ben motions to her to sit down. 
BEN I'll get it, Babe. 
He comes to the telephone and picks it up and says hello and then 
listens. 
BEN (To telephone) No. No. You stay where you are. I'll be 
down there in twenty minutes. 
He pauses and listens. 
BEN Listen to me. Stay where you are. I'll be there in

A cheap hotel room in the central city at stage right. A nineteen 
year old black youth is lying on an old fashioned bed with an iron 
bedstead. He is dressed in cheap flashy clothes. He has a thin 
moustache and he is smoking a cigarette. Street sounds from

the syringe. He lets them fall again. His mouth is compressed in 
anger and in sorrow. He pulls the chair up to the bed and sits 
down and holds his face in his hands. The pigeon calls. After a 
while Ben gets up. He looks down at Soldier. He takes the para­
phernalia from the night table and puts the items in the 
sidepocket of his jacket. He looks around the room. Then he takes 
Soldier's trousers from off the footrail of the bed and goes through 
them and takes out his billfold and puts that in his jacket pocket. 
He stands looking down at Soldier. Then he turns off the bedside 
lamp. There is just the light from the window. The pigeon calls. 
He turns and leaves the room.

didnt know what to say and I said thank you. And you 
laughed. Do you remember? 
MAVEN Yes. 
He kisses her again. 
B E N  Let me call. Before I lose my nerve. 
He rises and goes to the telephone and dials.

SCENE I X
At stage right, the family cemetery with the stone farmhouse in 
the background. There are a number of stone markers and part of 
an iron paling fence. All the family are present and dressed in 
mourning and the minister is reading the service over the casket. 
M I N I S T E R  Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me. 
And horror hath overwhelmed me. And I said, Oh that I

rest. Lo then would I wander far off. I would lodge in the 
wilderness. I would hast me to a shelter from the stormy 
wind and tempest. 
A wind is blowing across the little cemetery and Carlotta who is 
standing next to her husband turns away and goes stage left a few 
steps and stands looking out away from the service. She takes off 
her hat and veil and shakes out her hair. Her mouth is set and her 
face is hard. 
M I N I S T E R  Destroy, 0 Lord, and divide their tongue: For 
I have seen violence and strife in the city. Day and night 
they go about it upon the walls thereof. Iniquity also and 
mischief are in the midst of it . . . . . . . . . . .

He breaks off and looks up. 
M I N I S T E R  For it was not an enemy that reproached me. 
Then I could have borne it.

on in the kitchen behind him and Carlotta enters the room. She 
comes forward and stands looking down at him. She is still dressed 
in black. Ben raises his head. Then he turns and looks up at her. 
CARL OTTA We're leaving tomorrow. As soon as we've 
found a place we'll send out for the furniture and things. 
I'm going to let you and Mason make whatever sort of 
agreement he thinks is fair about the house. I'm sorry it's 
on your land. We cant move it. 
B E N  I'm sorry, Carly. 
CARL OTT A I dont think you are. 
B E N  I know. But I am. I dont know what else to say. 
He looks away. She is standing looking down at him. She shakes 
her head. He turns and looks at her again. 
B E N  What about Mama? 
C A R L  OTT A Mama's not going anywhere. 
He looks away again. 
C A R L OTTA Tell me one thing. 
B E N  Anything. 
CARL OTT A Did he mean to do it? 
Ben looks at her.

She half turns to go.

it the rest of my life.

She exits. 
SCENE X I

B E N  In the fall of that year when the weather had begun to 
tum I thought of him more and more. I remembered his 
pipe. I remembered a fox we saw on the hill behind the 
house in the snow and I remembered small things about 
him. His gloves. The knees in his trousers. The way he 
turned the pages of his bible. I saw him here twice in the 
evening just at dusk and I tried small tricks to make him 
appear again. I'd tum my head aside and then look back 
quickly. Or I'd close my eyes. Or maybe it was a dream. I 
saw him with a great stone that he carried with much 
labor and I thought it was like a boundary stone and I 
looked for some mark or inscription on the stone but 
there was none. It was just a stone. Nothing is finally un­
derstood. Nothing is finally arrived at. 
Grace I know is much like love and you cannot deserve it. 
It is freely given, without reason or equity. What could 
you do to deserve it? What? 
I've questioned the rightness of loving that old man 
beyond all other souls. 
What I need most is to learn charity. That most of all. 
I know that small acts of valor may be all that is visible of 
great movements of courage within.

For we are• all the elect, each one of us, and we are em­
barked upon a journey to something unimaginable. We 
do not know what will be required of us, and we have 
nothing to sustain us but the counsel of our fathers. 
It has grown darker in the little cemetery. A wind has sprung up. 
B EN Then one night when I was thinking of nothing at all 
he was suddenly there before me so plain I could have 
touched him. 
Papaw materializes out of the fog upstage just at the edge of the 
headstones. He is naked. 
B E N  He came out of the darkness and at that moment ev­
erything seemed revealed to me and I could almost touch 
him I could almost touch his old black head and he was 
naked and I could see the corded muscles in his shoulders 
that the stone had put there and the sinews and the veins 
in his forearms and his small belly and his thin old man's 
shanks and his slender polished shins and he was so very 
beautiful. He was just a man, naked and alone in the uni­
verse, and he was not afraid and I wept with a joy and a 
sadness I'd never known and I stood there with the tears 
pouring down my face and he smiled at me and he held 
out both his hands. Hands from which all those blessings

had flowed. Hands I never tired to look at. Shaped in the 
image of God. To make the world. To make it again and 
again. To make it in the very maelstrom of its undoing. 
Then as he began to fade I knelt in the grass and I prayed 
for the first time in my life. I prayed as men must have 
prayed ten thousand years ago to their dead kin for guid­
ance and I knew that he would guide me all my days and 
that he would not fail me, not fail me, not ever fail me.
