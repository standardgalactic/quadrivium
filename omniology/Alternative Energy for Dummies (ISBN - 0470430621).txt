About the Author
Rik DeGunther attended the University of Illinois as an undergraduate and 
Stanford University as a graduate student, studying both applied physics 
and engineering economics (some of this education actually stuck). He holds 
several United States patents and has designed a wide range of technical 
equipment including solar energy platforms, military-grade radar jammers, 
weather-measurement equipment, high-powered radar vacuum tubes, com-
puterized production hardware, golf practice devices, digital and analog elec-
tronic circuits, unmanned aerial vehicles, guitars and amplifi ers, microwave 
fi lters and mixers, automatic cabinet openers, strobe light communications 
systems, explosive devices (strictly on accident), cloud-height sensors, fog 
sensors, furniture, houses, barns, rocket ships, dart throwers, fl ame throw-
ers, eavesdropping devices, escape routes, and you name it. He’s one of those 
nerdy guys who likes to take things apart to see how they work and then put 
them back together and try to fi gure out what the leftover parts are for.
Rik is CEO of Effi cient Homes, an energy-effi ciency auditing fi rm in Northern 
California. He is actively engaged in designing and developing new solar 
equipment, including off-grid lighting systems and off-grid swimming pool 
heaters. He writes weekly op-ed columns for the Mountain Democrat, 
California’s oldest and most venerable newspaper. He has also written a 
highly acclaimed golf book (on putting) and spends most of his free time 
attempting to improve his relatively impressive but objectively droll golf 
handicap, usually to no avail. Sometimes the urge strikes him to play a very 
loud guitar, of which he owns a collection with far more intrinsic quality than 
the playing they receive. His hearing has been faltering the last few years, so 
he rebuilt his amplifi er to go up to 11.


Dedication
Of course this book is dedicated to Katie, Erik, and Ally, the only energy 
sources that truly matter in my life. I would never choose any other alterna-
tive than what I have right now.

Introduction
E
nergy is a big topic these days. Newspapers and magazines have arti-
cles about green living and energy efficiency in virtually every issue. 
Everybody is concerned with the environment and the way that humans 
are affecting the world that they live in. It seems a foregone conclusion that 
the use of fossil fuels is causing global warming, or at the very least, making 
global warming worse than it otherwise would be. The consequences of ram-
pant fossil fuel consumption are not crystal clear, but the scenarios being 
drawn by scientists point to a bleak future for humankind unless something 
can be done to solve the problem.
Alternative energy encompasses the range of options that can be pursued to 
make our world better. From solar to wind to alternative fuels for cars and 
trucks, everyone can make a difference. The purpose of Alternative Energy For 
Dummies is to explain the different alternatives and how they may be put into 
play in the most effective manner. Whether you want to make small incre-
mental improvements, or grandiose, world-shaking changes, this book gives 
you the info you need to understand what the pros and cons of each alterna-
tive option are. 
Some alternative energy strategies can be implemented on a small scale by 
individuals. You don’t need to sacrifice your quality of life when you choose 
to employ alternative energy schemes. Other alternatives, such as nuclear 
energy, you won’t be able to utilize in your own home. But you still need to 
understand the pros and cons and be able to make intelligent, well informed 
opinions about the alternatives that will very likely someday impact your 
area. 
About This Book
As you undoubtedly know already, many alternative energy books and 
articles are on the market. So a lot of information is available. In this book, I 
condense all the info about alternative energy into easily digestible chunks, 
focusing on the those things that are most helpful in understanding alterna-
tives to fossil fuels. In keeping with the For Dummies modus operandi, I give 
you only the most relevant ideas, explain the advantages and disadvantages 
of each, and offer the info you need to understand why and in what way cer-
tain schemes may be better than others.

Alternative Energy For Dummies 
There are a lot of energy-related books that get into far more detail than I 
do in this book. But this book is a great place to start, even if you’re striving 
for more detailed information. I give you the big picture, and that’s a great 
context to have before you dig in deeper. Although you won’t be a certified 
energy expert when you finish this book, you’ll be able to form logical, well-
informed opinions about society’s need to change our energy habits. You’ll 
be able to discuss macro and micro energy issues and you’ll understand life 
on the planet earth much better. That’s a big claim to make, but energy is 
so entwined with life that understanding energy is a basic underpinning to 
understanding life. It may be said that life itself is energy . . . at least for some 
people it is — for others, a television is all that’s needed.
In this book, you will find information like:
 
✓ What the term energy really means and how the basic laws of physics 
apply to all energy consuming processes, including alternatives. But 
don’t panic: I leave out the complicated physics while giving you a good 
idea of what energy can and can’t do.
 
✓ How the world came to the point that we are at now. Fossil fuels are, by 
and large, our main energy source, and there is a good reason for that. I 
also explain why it’s going to be so difficult to change our economy over 
to alternative energy.
 
✓ Why fossil fuels are so dangerous for our society. Not only do fossil fuels 
cause untold and unnecessary pollution, but supply and demand prob-
lems also threaten the world’s existing economy.
 
✓ How both traditional fossil fuel combustion processes work, as well as 
how the alternative energy options work. You’ll also find info about the 
limitations and advantages of each.
 
✓ How you can conserve (which some would argue is an alternative in and 
of itself) and what the limitations of conservation and efficiency are.
 
✓ The range of alternative energy schemes currently being pursued and 
how society is grappling with the various problems inherent with the 
alternative energy schemes.
 
I wrote this book after having written two previous For Dummies books 
(Solar Power Your Home For Dummies [Wiley], and Energy Efficient Homes For 
Dummies [Wiley]). Both of these were very practical, with day-to-day tips and 
bulleted lists of information that allow a reader to grab their tool box and 
make effective changes in their homes. This book is more academic, and was 
much more fun to write. I expect that most readers will also have more fun 
reading it because knowledge and understanding are empowering. If I had my 
way, I would go back in time and finish my PhD in physics and be a college 
professor so that I would never have to do anything practical. I like knowledge

 Introduction
for its own sake, and I feel empowered when I understand life in a particularly 
perspicuous way. My goal with this book is to empower the reader. When 
you’re finished, you’ll have a worldview that you did not expect, for there are 
some big surprises in these pages.
Conventions Used in This Book
For simplicity’s sake, this book follows a few conventions:
 
✓ Italicized terms are immediately followed by definitions.
 
✓ Bold indicates the action parts in numbered steps. It also emphasizes 
the keywords in a bulleted list.
 
✓ Web site addresses show up in monofont.
 
✓ When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed 
to break across two lines of text. Rest assured that I haven’t put in any 
extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. Just type in 
exactly what you see in this book, pretending as though the line break 
didn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Although I’d like for you to find the topic so interesting that you wouldn’t 
think of bypassing anything in this book, I realize that you may have other 
things requiring a bit of your time and attention. For that reason, I’ve made 
skippable information easy to identify. You don’t have to read the following 
to understand energy alternatives. Although this information is interesting (if 
I do say so myself) and related to the topic at hand, it isn’t vital, absolutely-
must-know information:
 
✓ Material in sidebars: Sure, these are interesting. Some are fun. I like to 
think that all are helpful. But they contain info that you don’t absolutely, 
positively, without-a-doubt need to know. 
 
✓ Paragraphs marked with the Technical Stuff icon: Some people like 
details that only the technically minded or trivia-loving typically find 
interesting. If you’re not one of these people, you can safely skip these 
paragraphs without missing any need-to-know info.

Alternative Energy For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made a few assumptions about you:
 
✓ You care about the world that you live in, and you care very much 
about how future generations will be able to enjoy their own lives on the 
planet earth.
 
✓ You understand that if humankind continues on its present course, 
some very big problems will only grow bigger and even more intractable 
and you believe that it’s time to do something.
 
✓ Whether you believe in global warming or not, you do understand that 
humankind needs to change how we use energy. You don’t have to be a 
tree-hugger or a “green” to see how the world is changing for the worse.
 
✓ You want to understand the relevant and important ideas about alterna-
tive energy as sensibly and efficiently as possible. 
 
✓ You don’t have an engineering degree, and you don’t want to know every 
technical detail concerning the various technologies that I describe in 
this book. You simply want to understand an important subject.
 
Finally, because politics plays such a major role in the energy dialogue these 
days, let me explain where I come from, which may clear up some assump-
tions you have about me: I am a political centrist. I’m not a tree-hugger, nor 
am I a global-warming denier. I don’t believe politics should play such a major 
role because I believe that humankind needs to change its ways. We use too 
much energy, and we use the wrong kinds. We put ourselves in jeopardy with 
our unending pursuit of fossil fuels. Yet while I do not advocate any political 
positions in this book, I take for granted the fact that changes to our energy 
consumption are necessary.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into parts, each one dealing with a particular topic 
related to alternative energy. Each part contains chapters relating to the 
part topic. The following sections give you an overview of the content within 
each part.

5
 Introduction
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life
I begin with some historical perspective because that will give you an under-
standing of how we’ve gotten ourselves into the mess we’re in. Humans have 
evolved in step with their energy consuming processes. When people first 
started burning fires, society evolved as health improved along with life-
styles. And by and large, the evolution of all human societies has depended 
on the effective use of energy, particularly in military ventures. In this part I 
also describe some very fundamental physical facts of energy. Most people 
have a very basic idea of what energy is, but in order to truly understand 
alternative-energy schemes, you need to understand how energy moves 
through a system. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it merely 
changes form. I describe precisely how this works.
Part II: Digging Deeper into 
the Current State of Affairs
I describe existing fossil fuel machines and how they convert petrol potential 
energy into forms of energy that we use in our homes and to drive our vehi-
cles. The picture of the world energy economy may seem bleak, but there are 
opportunities to introduce alternatives. I describe how energy efficiency and 
conservation can play an important role in reducing our reliance on fossil 
fuels. Finally, I survey the problems with fossil fuels, ranging from smog to 
global warming to simple problems of supply. Whether or not you believe 
that fossil fuels are poisoning the planet, the simple fact is that someday 
fossil fuels will run out. 
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings
In this part, which comprises a hefty percentage of the book, I describe the 
various alternative energy schemes that are being pursued and developed. 
I begin with nuclear power, which is going to play an increasingly important 
role in the future. Solar power is the “in” thing these days, and I explain the 
pros and cons and how you can use solar power in your own home (for 
more details, consult my book Solar Power Your Home For Dummies [Wiley]). 
Hydropower provides around 8 percent of American energy needs, but the 
future is very uncertain because of environmental questions. Wind power is 
a very good solution, but it’s not for everybody. Geothermal energy is avail-
able in abundance in many parts of the country, and when it works it’s a 
very good option. Biomass is an interesting alternative because it’s so widely 
available and makes good use of materials that have been, heretofore, simply

Alternative Energy For Dummies 
thrown away. Wood burning, when done properly, can be an excellent alter-
native for those who have a ready supply, but there are some major prob-
lems that need to be understood in order to do it right. And finally, I touch 
briefly on fuel cells, which hold the most promise of any of the alternative-
energy solutions.
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation
The majority of fossil fuel consumption occurs in the transport sector. Cars 
and trucks spew billions of pounds of emissions into the atmosphere every 
year. I describe some alternative fuels that are increasingly being used, such 
as corn ethanol and biodiesel. I describe how these fuels are best used, and 
when and where. I describe how hybrid autos work, and how all-electric vehi-
cles and fuel cell–powered vehicles work. I give you some guidelines to use 
if you’re interested in investing in alternative vehicles. And finally I survey 
some of the more exotic alternative transportation systems being developed.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Like every For Dummies book, this part includes quick resources that pro-
vide plenty of information and sage advice compacted into few words. Want 
a list of the best ways to invest in alternative energy? Or maybe you want 
to understand some of the more prevalent myths about alternative energy. 
Perhaps you want to help to change society? I give you the nitty-gritty, in as 
few words as possible.
Icons Used in This Book
This book uses several icons that make it easy for you to identify particular 
types of information:
 
The Technical Stuff icon lets you know that some particularly nerdy informa-
tion is coming up so that you can skip it if you want. (On the other hand, you 
may want to read it, and you don’t actually have to be a nerd. You only have 
to be able to read.)
 
This icon indicates a nifty little shortcut or timesaver.

Look out! Quicksand is afoot. You don’t want to skip over the warnings. They 
point out dangers to your health and well-being, your property, or your bank 
account.
 
This icon highlights important information to store in your brain for quick 
recall at a later time.
Where to Go from Here
Some of you may look at the table of contents and skip straight to a particu-
lar section that addresses a topic you wish to understand without resort-
ing to the fundamental background information. Others of you may start in 
Chapter 1 and work your way diligently through the book all the way through 
Chapter 23 Either approach is just fine and dandy because all For Dummies 
books are structured so that you can jump in and out or read them straight 
through to get the information you need.
 
The goal of this book is to impart a very basic and broad-ranging understand-
ing of a major problem facing humanity. In this regard, it’s probably better to 
read the book from beginning to end because there is coherency and a logical 
flow to the arguments being presented. Understanding how current fossil fuel 
technologies work may not be necessary to understanding alternative energy, 
but the word “alternative” does have a particular meaning that is directly 
related to fossil fuels. Alternative energy schemes are simply alternatives to 
the fossil fuel paradigm that the world operates under.

A
lternative energy is defined differently by different 
people. Obviously, the definition you get depends 
on the context and who is doing the defining. In this 
book, I define alternative energy as any energy source 
that is an alternative to the fossil fuels that rule the world 
today. In Chapter 1, I describe how fossil fuels have 
evolved to the point where they are the overwhelmingly 
dominant energy source. In Chapter 2, I explain what the 
term “energy” actually means — info you need to know to 
understand how the different alternatives compare to the 
current system that relies on fossil fuels. In Chapter 3, I 
get into some hard facts of energy consumption, impor-
tant background information for understanding how 
energy moves through a system and what happens to 
energy once it’s “used.”

Chapter 1
What a Mess!
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the current energy situation
▶ Identifying problems in the current system
▶ Looking at alternatives
F
or the most part, producing energy and consuming energy is a very dirty 
business. Although you all may have a sense of this, the extent of the 
problem seems to be a political question open to debate. What should be 
done about energy consumption? Use less? Use different resources? How can 
new energy sources be best invested in? And perhaps of most importance, 
what types of new energy sources should be invested in? And what about 
global warming? Can anything really be done about it? What will new energy 
sources and the combating of global warming cost both the society as well as 
individuals? 
A lot of solutions are being tossed around, but it’s nearly impossible to 
separate the wheat from the chaff. And to make matters worse, political 
fringes screech from the sidelines in preachy tones that tend to turn people 
off to the point where they just plain don’t want to listen any more. This is a 
system guaranteed to create gridlock and partisanship, and that’s been the 
norm for so long that everyone is just plain used to it.
Leaving the important questions up to the politicians hasn’t worked too 
well, and so it’s incumbent on everybody to understand the issues so that 
informed decisions can be made when voting for candidates with varying 
views concerning both the problem and the solutions. Informed decisions 
also help you to decide, on a micro basis, what’s best for your homes and 
your families. This chapter gives an overview of energy use — as well as the 
system’s problems — from the past and present as well as what can be done 
in the future. 

12
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
Understanding Where Society Is 
and How It Got Here
The fact is, energy is a critical component of your lives and your economy as 
a whole. You use energy in virtually every endeavor you engage in, whether 
you’re aware of it or not. Life expectancy in the U.S. has increased 66 percent 
over the last century (from 47 years in 1900 to 78 years today). Americans 
are living longer, healthier lives, and for the most part Americans are more 
secure and knowledgeable about their world. Life is just plain better than it 
used to be, and this has been made possible by advances in medicine and 
technology — advances that all took a great deal of energy. 
 
To make any kind of claim that energy consumption has been anything but 
advantageous to humanity completely misses the point. The problem is not 
with energy, it’s with the way energy is used and which types are used.
It’s only becoming evident now that energy use is a zero-sum game: You pay 
every bit as much as you gain, but the terms under which you pay are still 
not clear. Of course, you pay for each gallon of gas you use, but we’re also 
learning that we are paying in environmental costs and health costs. The 
most fundamental concept that this book can teach is this: The U.S. (and by 
extension, the world) does not have an energy crisis. Rather, it has an envi-
ronmental energy policy crisis. The U.S. has as much energy as it wants to use. 
The question is how to use it and what kinds of limitations should be set in 
terms of how the environment is affected through that energy use. To answer 
that question, you need to get a handle on energy use in the past, present, 
and future.
Historical trends of energy use 
Humans have evolved in step with the sophistication of their energy con-
sumption. Human populations, quality of life, and life expectancy have 
increased as energy sources have become more sophisticated. 
Think about it: Early man couldn’t even light a fire. Many froze in the winter, 
with only wooly mammoth skins to keep them warm, and the quality of life 
was not much different than that of animals. Once fire was discovered and 
humans were able to create flames at will, humanity began a gradual but 
consistent climb from savagery to what it is today. Upon the advent of fire, 
humans could warm themselves and cook their food. This began the consis-
tent push toward bigger and better cultural and material gains, and it lead to 
healthier, happier lives.

13
 Chapter 1: What a Mess!
Throughout time, the human population remained steady for the first 1,500 
years and then began a steep, consistent climb. The increase is due largely 
to the availability of versatile, convenient energy. As controlled, or useable, 
energy became more prevalent, the population expansion accelerated. 
Table 1-1 shows how population and energy consumption per capita have 
increased through the ages. Continue this trend out a hundred years, and 
it suggests that the only thing humans will be doing a century from now is 
consuming energy, 24/7. Regardless whether you’re willing to take that leap 
intellectually, the fact is, humans use more and more energy every year. This 
growth can’t be supported, unless society comes up with alternative sources 
and consumption habits; otherwise, fossil fuel reserves will be depleted by 
the year 2050.

You can see how greater populations results in higher energy consumption. 
You can also get a feel for how daunting and necessary it is to find a workable 
solution for energy consumption.
Energy use today
Today, Americans consume around 100 Quads (quadrillion Btus, or British 
thermal units; head to Chapter 3 for information about energy measure-
ments) of energy per year. (This number includes only sources of thermal 
energy, such as gasoline, natural gas, coal, and so on, and not the vast car-
bohydrate network that supplies our food chain.) So is that a lot? Here’s 100 
Quads worth of energy in units that resonate: Fifteen large horses labor, day 
and night, 24/7, for each U.S. citizen.
The breakdown of U.S. energy consumption is roughly 40 percent electric, 
30 percent transport, and 30 percent for heating. While we burn most of this 

14
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
energy, only about 30 percent goes to direct heating. The rest is used to turn 
shafts to make electricity, and to turn shafts to move our cars. Eventually, all 
of this energy makes it back into the environment in the form of heat. In fact, 
there is far more heat pollution from energy consumption than any of the 
chemical types of pollution emitted, but Mother Nature can absorb all of this 
heat without the problems that chemicals create.
Figure 1-1 shows how primary energy sources are used in the American econ-
omy. As you can see, coal, oil, gas, and shale (the fossil fuels represented in 
Figure 1-1) are the most commonly used energy sources today and the root 
of many of our current problems. Mineral fuels like uranium are used for 
nuclear fission and fusion.

 Chapter 1: What a Mess!
Looking ahead to more energy 
use and waste
 
As the human population grows, the total consumption of energy grows even 
faster. Bottom line? We humans seek comfort and consistency in our lives. 
Energy provides this, and so humans seek energy. The reason so much 
more energy is being consumed per capita is that ordered energy (go to 
Chapter 2 for an explanation of this concept) takes a lot of raw energy to create. 
Raw forms of energy, like firewood, give way to more sophisticated forms, 
like electricity. That’s evolution, in a nutshell.
 
Humanity strives for consistency. Consistency is order, and that’s what energy 
gives us. If we want more consistency, it will take more energy. And more and 
more all the time. Human history suggests that our energy consumption is 
only going to increase, and when impediments to this growth occur, problems 
follow.
The following sections delve into some of those problems.
The cost of energy producing processes versus raw energy
As more sophisticated energy-consuming processes are developed, the cost 
of those processes has less and less to do with the cost of the raw energy 
required and more and more to do with the equipment that creates the 
finished energy product. You have to consider the total effect of the energy-
consuming process. The order achieved from an energy-consuming process 
is important, not the actual raw energy that is being consumed.
 
Invested energy is the energy that’s used to manufacture a product (in the lit-
erature, you may see this referred to as embodied energy, or grey energy, but 
it all means essentially the same thing). Most people don’t consider invested 
energy when they’re analyzing energy-consuming processes; they only con-
sider the raw fuels that are used by the machines that use energy. But a com-
plete energy picture requires consideration of invested energy. 
Decreasing costs, increasing demand
When more efficient machines are devised, the cost of operating those 
machines decreases, and demand goes up. This is simple economics referred 
to as cost elasticity: The cheaper a commodity becomes, the more it is con-
sumed. For example, more fuel-efficient cars result not in less consumption, 
but more consumption, because people can afford to drive their cars more.

16
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
The inevitability of waste
Waste is a necessary part of every single energy process. It’s a simple fact of 
physics. Therefore, the pursuit of eliminating waste is fruitless, and misses 
the point. In fact, the more ordered energy becomes, the more waste that is 
inherent in the process of creating that order. Chapter 3 has more on this 
topic.
Putting Society Over a (Oil) Barrel: 
Problems in the Current System
Over the last century, humankind experienced an unprecedented expansion 
of industrialization. Here’s a perspective: Only 100 years have passed since 
autos have even existed, and electrical power didn’t exist in a majority of the 
country until 50 years ago. Now consider:
 
✓ Industrialization is a global phenomenon so energy resources are being 
consumed at an unprecedented rate the world over. 
 
✓ Japan is the world’s second largest economy, and China is growing into 
a tremendous world power, consuming resources faster than any coun-
try the world has ever seen. 
 
✓ U.S. consumption of petroleum has risen steadily since 1950, and prom-
ises to continue unabated. 
 
✓ In 2000, the U.S. consumed 20 million barrels of crude oil per day. That’s 
a lot of crude. 
 
✓ U.S. net fossil fuel imports fell during the ’70s as a result of the OPEC oil 
embargo, but have risen sharply since the mid 1980’s. In 2005, over half 
of the crude oil consumed in the U.S. was imported, and it’s projected 
that this number will increase to over 65 percent within 20 years.
Overreliance on fossil fuels
All of the growth and expansion has been shouldered by fossil fuel energy 
sources, which creates all sorts of havoc: Politically it makes us beholden 
to foreign nations. Economically it creates uncertainty in markets, and wild 
price fluctuations result. Economies need consistency in order to thrive, and 
there is no telling how much the fossil fuel price fluctuations have cost the 
U.S. economy in terms of lost growth potential.

Declining supplies
While consumption has skyrocketed, U.S. domestic supplies of crude oil have 
declined in the last half of the century, and after checking out the following 
facts, you can see that at some point U.S. domestic supply will simply run dry: 
 
✓ At present, U.S. production of crude is only 1.9 million barrels a day. 
Current estimates put U.S. domestic reserves of crude petroleum at 21.3 
billion barrels. But current production rates are around 8 percent of the 
reserves per year. This means the U.S. will run completely out of domes-
tic crude in about 12 years
 
✓ Current estimates of U.S. natural gas reserves are 192.5 trillion cubic 
feet. But production from these reserves is growing at a rate four times 
that of new discoveries so the situation is only growing worse. At pres-
ent, production represents around 4 percent of proven reserves per 
year, which suggests that the U.S. will run out of domestic supplies in 25 
years. 
Even if ANWR is opened up to drilling; even if offshore drilling platforms are 
allowed to proliferate around the coastlines; even if new domestic reserve 
discoveries exceed the wildest expectations; and even if future generations of 
extraction and processing equipment exceed expectations, the U.S. will run 
completely out of domestic supplies for its most basic forms of raw energy.
The U.S. has two options in the face of declining reserves: 
 
✓ Seize foreign reserves, by war if necessary. Although this may sound 
outlandish, when the U.S. economy starts to grind to a halt, things will 
get truly serious. 
 
✓ Develop alternative energy sources.
Getting better at finding 
and using fossil fuels
The supply of energy is not determined by how much is available, or 
what’s out there, but by humankind’s ingenuity in getting to it, and using it. 
Semiconductors and computers have made oil-drilling machines infinitely 
more intelligent and effective than they were 100 years ago. And semiconduc-
tors and computers now account for nearly 15 percent of all the electrical 
consumption in the U.S. Energy begets energy. In short, we have grown much 
more efficient at extracting raw energy.

18
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
In conjunction with this trend, technology has provided the means to refine 
energy to the point where it can be controlled for even the most precise 
uses, like resurfacing the human eye so to see without eyeglasses, or creating 
microprocessors so precise and controlled that even microscopic variations 
in the semiconductor substrates are smoothed over, resulting in ever faster 
and better computers, that in turn, make it possible to harvest even more 
energy, and with more efficiency.
Imagine if all of this ingenuity and inventive spirit were channeled into the 
pursuit of alternative-energy sources. Most of the advances in technol-
ogy come from the U.S., and if the country were to focus on developing 
alternative-energy sources, a huge boost to the economy would result. The 
U.S. could lead the world in exporting alternative-energy know-how, and the 
equipment to achieve the desired end results.
A word or two about global warming
I don’t take a definitive position on global warm-
ing one way or another in this book. My opinion 
is that it’s not really relevant in encouraging 
people to conserve and practice efficiency. 
The fact is, the world uses too many resources, 
and in the process ends up altering the planet 
in material ways that will affect future genera-
tions in one manner or another. Global warming 
is just one way that humans might be affecting 
the planet, and in my view the overwhelming 
attention placed on this one aspect of our envi-
ronmental defamation does a disservice to the 
other aspects, and the overall balance and har-
mony that mankind should be striving for. What 
if it turns out that there is no global warming? 
Should society then go right back to the old 
days of unlimited exploitation of resources? Of 
course not.
I also find it frustrating that most people seem 
to believe wholeheartedly that global warming 
either does or does not exist. There seems to 
be no middle ground. The fact is, the data, while 
compelling, is still inconclusive, and both sides 
have valid arguments. The earth has always 
warmed and cooled. There have been over 600 
warming and cooling cycles, and none of these 
have been attributable to manmade pollutants. It 
is theorized by some that the dinosaurs’ demise 
was brought on by a meteor that hit the planet 
earth, causing tremendous densities of airborne 
particulates that changed the environmental 
ambient in catastrophic ways. Warm-blooded 
creatures thrived in the new world order, and 
this brought on mankind’s ascendance. So 
within this theory, humankind is a product of a 
natural global warming event. It would be ironic 
if mankind ends up ensuring its own demise by 
a manmade global warming event.
Here’s an interesting question for those who 
believe that mankind should strive to neutralize 
its effects on the planet. Suppose NASA deter-
mined that a large meteor was going to strike 
the earth. And further, it would be possible to 
launch a rocket with a massive nuclear bomb 
that could destroy the meteor. Should we do it, 
or should we simply let nature take its course?

 Chapter 1: What a Mess!
Rising to the Challenge: Balancing Fossil 
Fuel Use with Appropriate Alternatives
You solve energy problems by expending even more energy, not less. You 
need to devise alternatives that offset fossil fuel addictions, and invention 
and development take a lot of energy. Infrastructure takes energy. All human 
advancement requires energy in increasing amounts. Because the only con-
sensus seems to be that fossil fuels are not the answer, you have to wonder 
what form this energy will take in the future. The following sections provide 
an overview of the alternatives as well as factors to consider when choosing 
alternative sources of energy.
 
This book is all about alternatives to the status quo. Alternatives are not the 
end all; they will never displace fossil fuels. The solution lies in a combina-
tion of doing better with fossil fuel use and developing alternatives when 
that’s appropriate. In Parts III and IV, I describe the alternative technologies 
in detail, explaining when these technologies are useful and when they’re not. 
Alternatives will require sacrifices not only in terms of monetary costs but 
also in terms of changing lifestyles. 
Looking at the local impact
In addition to the pollution mitigations and political desirability of alternative 
energy sources, there are attractive local impacts:
 
✓ Local jobs
 
✓ Sustainable economy
 
✓ More money stays local, instead of moving to the Mideast
 
✓ Less air pollution, lower health burdens
 
✓ Diversification of the energy-supply options
 
✓ Security to the U.S. economy — the economy is more controllable if it 
doesn’t rely on foreign countries for energy supplies.
 
✓ Increasing supply of energy options reduces costs by increasing compe-
tition, making inexpensive energy more widely available
 
Economically, none of the alternatives can compete price-wise with fossil 
fuels, but that all depends on one’s accounting system, for fossil fuels are sub-
sidized in many ways by the governments of the world.

20
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
Adding up the alternatives
As stated earlier, energy is not running out, nor will it ever run out. The prob-
lem is not that less energy resources are available, but that the political and 
environmental consequences of the current energy consumption, well, stink. 
Hence, the drive for alternatives. The following sections introduce the alter-
native energy candidates. You can find out more about these options in 
Parts III and IV.
Solar power
Solar power, discussed in detail in Chapter 9, uses sunshine to create both 
heat and electricity, as well as passive heating and cooling effects in build-
ings. Although there are other ways to take advantage of solar power (think 
photosynthesis, for example), the one I focus on in this book is the direct 
conversion of radiation. This includes photovoltaic panels and solar liquid 
heating schemes. Large scale solar farms can provide entire communities 
with enough electrical and heating power to make the communities 
self-sufficient.
Nuclear power
Nuclear power harnesses the tremendous energies from both the splitting 
and fusing of atoms. In some books, nuclear is not considered an alternative 
energy source, but my interpretation is that alternatives are those that do 
not emit the fossil fuel pollutants that are causing so much environmental 
harm. So I include nuclear energy in the alternative energy pantheon. Find 
out more about nuclear power in Chapter 8.
Solar’s role in other energy sources
Solar power is a key component in other energy 
sources:
 ✓ Photosynthesis (a plant’s ability to con-
vert sunlight into useable energy): Plants 
grow and may be combusted as biomass 
(like ethanol, or wood). Animals eat plants, 
humans eat animals and plants. There is 
also energy available from fermentation 
and anaerobic decay of biomass.
 ✓ Oceanic. Waves may be harnessed for 
energy production. Currents are capable 
of driving hydro turbines. The thermal dif-
ferences between different regions may be 
tapped with heat exchange mechanisms. 
 ✓ Hydropower. Solar radiation evaporates 
water, which becomes rain, which becomes 
rivers and streams that can be dammed up 
and outfitted with turbines and generators. 
See the section “Wind and hydropower” 
and Chapter 10 for more on this energy 
source.

21
 Chapter 1: What a Mess!
Wind and hydropower
Wind power derives from windmills placed in locations with a lot of wind. 
Luckily for the U.S., there are plenty of suitable sites.
Hydropower comes from dams which provide high pressure water flows 
that spin turbines, thereby creating electricity. It can be exploited on both a 
macro level (huge dams can be built to create statewide electrical power on 
America’s biggest rivers) and on the micro level (people can put hydropower 
generators in backyard rivers and streams). For more info on both of these 
energy sources, head to Chapters 10 and 11.
Geothermal
Geothermal power, the topic of Chapter 12, takes heat from the earth and 
redistributes it into a building, or uses the heat to generate electrical power. 
It’s available in tremendous quantities, but it’s difficult to extract and takes 
a lot of capital equipment. On a more general level, heat pumps (the kind in 
many homes) are a source of geothermal energy, so geothermal energy can 
be practical and effective on a micro level.
Biomass and wood
Biomass is sawgrass, mulch, corn, and so on. These materials are either 
burned in their raw form, or processed into liquid fuels or solid fuels. Wood, 
the most common biomass, is used to heat homes throughout the country. 
(Note: Some books distinguish wood from biomass, but I don’t make that fine 
a distinction.) Chapters 13 and 14 explore these topics in more detail.
Hydrogen fuel cells
Hydrogen fuel cells, in a nutshell, produce electrical power from nothing 
more than hydrogen, which is completely free of carbon. The exhaust is 
water, and what can be more natural than that?
Hydrogen fuel cells combine oxygen and hydrogen to produce water and 
electrical energy. Sounds simple, and there’s an amazing potential to solve 
a lot of the world’s environmental problems, should fuel cells pan out like 
some people think they will. The technologies are years off, however. And 
there are some major difficulties that may never be overcome. But the prom-
ise remains bright, and a lot of development money is now being invested in 
fuel cells. Go to Chapter 15 for more information.
Electric vehicles
Electric vehicles use only electricity to power the drive train. The electric-
ity comes from batteries, which are heavy and cumbersome, but battery 
technologies are getting better and all-electric vehicles are now becoming 

22
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
economically competitive with conventional, internal-combustion vehicles. It 
should be mentioned that electric vehicles need to get their electrical power 
from somewhere, and that “somewhere” is likely the power grid, which itself 
consumes a lot of coal, and emits a lot of pollution. Chapter 18 has more info.
Hybrid vehicles
Hybrid vehicles are a combination of electric and internal-combustion pow-
ertrains. When power requirements are low, the vehicle operates in electrical 
mode. When more power is needed, or when the electrical batteries are near 
depletion, an internal-combustion engine provides power. Hybrids, discussed in 
Chapter 19, offer much higher MPG ratings than conventional transportation.
Biofuels
Biofuels, discussed in Chapter 17, are made of biomass products such as 
corn. Corn ethanol is now being added to most gasoline supplies in the 
United States. Despite the high energy consumption in the refining process, 
biofuels allow the U.S. to import less foreign oil, and so the political effects 
are desirable. Biofuels may either be used in their pure form or mixed with 
fossil fuels. 
Evaluating the alternatives
There is no such thing as a free lunch. Every energy source has pros and 
cons, and trying to decide how best to provide the power an economy needs 
is a complex problem. Many believe that the current energy predicament will 
be solved by weaning society away from petroleum consumption, but even 
as people develop new alternative sources, the problems don’t go away; they 
simply change in nature. 
In evaluating alternative energy sources, here are some important factors to 
consider.
Combustion versus noncombustion
The majority of our energy sources produce power through combustion 
processes (burning) that require a burn chamber, oxygen, and exhaustion 
capacities. From time immemorial, humans have burned wood for fires, and 
the process was simple: Pile some wood, light it on fire, hang around nearby. 
Modern combustion processes are engineered to be more efficient (modern 
wood-burning stoves are around 100 times more efficient than open fires, for 
example), but the combustion processes, regardless of how efficient they are, 
are notorious pollution sources.

23
 Chapter 1: What a Mess!
Noncombustion processes, such as solar power and nuclear, don’t exhaust 
pollutants the same way that combustion processes do, but they entail their 
own problems. For instance, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels require a lot of 
energy to manufacture, and most of this energy comes from electrical power 
which mostly comes from coal combustion. So while solar is pollution free 
in its on-site implementation, it entails a lot of pollution in its manufacture. 
Other noncombustion energy sources such as wind and hydropower also 
require a great deal of energy to manufacture the capital equipment needed 
to make things work.
Raw material issues
Every energy production plant, whether solar or a woodstove, needs raw 
materials. In the case of solar, the raw materials are free. In the case of a 
nuclear power plant, the raw materials are uranium rods, which must be 
meticulously refined and manufactured. In fact, the total cost of an energy 
process has less and less to do with the raw fuels. Capital equipment is 
expensive, and is usually the most influential component in a cost/analysis 
equation.
The degree of refinement of the energy
Woodstoves provide heat, and in a rather coarse fashion. Solar PV provides 
high-grade electrical energy. Wind power also provides high-grade electrical 
energy. In the case of the woodstove, the heat is the desired end product, 
and heat is very coarse yet effective. Electrical energy is very refined and 
convenient. Every energy-consuming process requires a certain degree of 
refinement of the energy, and the refinement itself takes energy. If it’s possi-
ble to adopt policies that promote less refined energy, everyone is better off.
The level of current technology
It takes time for new technologies to reach the market, and it takes even 
more time for wide-ranging acceptance and use of a new technology. People 
don’t simply discard their current systems because a radical new technology 
is developed. They wait until their current equipment breaks down, or is no 
longer economical to use before they invest in new systems. 
Pollution and environmental impacts
Every energy-producing and -consuming process leaves a residue of some 
kind on our planet. Alternative-energy schemes are not all pollution mitiga-
tion marvels. Wood stoves, for instance, can be one of the most polluting 
energy sources if the wood is burned inefficiently. And different types of pol-
lution cause different types of problems.

24
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
Economics 
Let’s face it; most people are concerned exclusively with economics and are 
only interested in seeing their net costs decrease for energy consumption. 
Because of this, the government steps in with taxes, rebates, and other forms 
of subsidies in order to achieve in the market what they deem desirable, 
namely lower pollution levels and freedom from foreign oil. If the govern-
ment didn’t mandate economic changes to the playing field, fossil fuels would 
never yield to alternatives.
Politics
And of course, since government is going to lead the way into the alternative 
energy future, politics plays a very large role in which alternative solutions 
get the most play. Green politics is becoming an increasingly powerful and 
influential part of every government operation.

T
here are a lot of myths concerning energy. In this chapter I describe 
exactly what energy is (and isn’t), and why it’s so important in every 
aspect of life. Prior to understanding the nitty-gritties of energy, it’s first 
necessary to gain a good understanding of the abstractions of energy. 
In this chapter, the basic concept of energy and power evolves into a more 
focused understanding of useable, or ordered, energy. What humans seek, as 
they use energy to make their lives better, is not just energy, but refined and 
controlled energy.
Defining Energy: Grab Your Hats, Folks
Most people think they have a good idea what the term energy means: the 
gas you put into your car, or the power that comes into your home via 
electric wires that makes your television spew out such meaningless drivel. 
For the most part, your understanding of energy’s functional nature is correct. 
But the term is actually much broader than that. In fact, at the highest level, 
energy is the essence of life in the universe, and ordered energy is the key to 
human advancement.
The following sections break down the concepts of how energy is behind 
life and all that you do. These sections show you how simple and complex 
energy is, which explains why the entire concept of energy can make your 
head swim. No worries though — although I dive right in, I give you plenty of 
water wings and inner tubes to keep you floating right along.

26
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
Life itself is energy 
You probably have an intuitive idea of what energy does, namely perform 
work, or make things work. It takes energy to make something happen. And 
it takes energy to make something stop. In short, almost every single life 
process takes energy.
Even processes without life take energy. Imagine a planet without life. Only 
physics — natural laws that govern the universe — survives (and then, of 
course you could argue that if nobody’s around to note these physical laws, 
then maybe even physics doesn’t survive without energy either . . . is your 
head spinning yet?). In physics courses, almost every single process and 
equation is described in terms of energy. The way energy moves through a 
physical system defines how that system works, in minute detail. When you 
see a picture of a physics professor standing in front of a chalkboard with a 
whole bunch of abstract mathematics, for the most part the math is describing 
how energy proceeds through a physical interaction and how the different 
parts of a physical system are related in terms of energy. 
The following list explains how it may even be said that life itself, from 
beginning to end, is a form of energy:
 
✓ As life evolved on our planet, more and more complex life forms 
became possible. What has made more complex forms possible is the 
information storing mechanisms hidden within DNA structures, which 
themselves are essentially energy centers. DNA is a sugar, and sugar is 
energy. The passing of the information contained in DNA is inherently 
linked to an energy source that makes life possible. In this vein, 
information itself is a form of energy. At the very least, there would be 
no transfer of information without energy. There is no transmission of 
computer data without energy. In fact, there is nothing without energy.
 
✓ Complex life forms are always characterized by complex energy 
schemes. Warm-blooded creatures are a good example. The evolution 
of warm-bloodedness enabled these animals to overcome cold weather 
and move about more freely. But there was a price to pay as well. 
Warm-blooded creatures require much more energy to live and thrive; 
they must eat a lot more than cold-blooded creatures in order to maintain. 
The complexities increase dramatically, and the energy systems 
required to support this complexity also become more complex. 
 
✓ Life forms consume other life forms; a form of energy mutation. The 
major preoccupation with all of life is the attainment of more and more 
energy. It’s impossible to spend a single moment of life without consum-
ing energy in some form or another. The process by which energy is 
extracted when a life form eats another is not much different than the 
process that automobile engines use to extract energy from a gallon 
of gas. The chemical bonds of the raw fuel are broken down and in the 

27
 Chapter 2: What Energy Is and How It’s Used (Politically and Practically)
process energy is released. In fact, that gallon of gasoline was, very 
long ago, a plethora of life forms which died and decayed and turned 
into crude oil deposits beneath the surface of the earth. Humans eat life 
forms for sustenance and burn life forms for heat and utility. If the world 
were truly fair, other life forms would eat humans, although the flavor 
would probably not be so great, with all the crud we put into ourselves 
these days. Crud, by the way, which is made possible by energy-consuming 
inventions that we hold so dear. 
 
✓ Perhaps the human soul is nothing more than an ineffable form of 
energy. (I’m not getting religious here — I’m simply making an observa-
tion). Energy can neither be created nor destroyed but simply changes form 
(this is the essence of the first law of thermodynamics; see Chapter 3) — a 
fact that can be observed in the physical world. If the life-force of a living 
creature is an energetic order, then we can say that death is not the end 
all, that the energy that animates the living creature — what many call the 
soul — continues on. 
The fact is, energy production and consumption is critical to all life on the 
planet earth, but it’s particularly critical to human life. The reason humankind 
has thrived and dominated the planet is due to our ability to devise clever 
energy exploitation mechanisms. The goal? To create order out of chaos (see 
the section, “Energy is order,” below).
Energy is order 
It takes energy to make the world conform to mankind’s wants and needs, 
and that’s the bottom line. By controlling energy, humans have been able 
to alter their universe, and ultimately that seems to be what humanity is all 
about: controlling life with energy and power. Check out these examples: 
 
✓ Humans can obtain what they want when they expend energy. 
 
✓ Humans can protect themselves from their enemies when they harness 
energy into formidable weapons. 
 
✓ Humans assure a consistent supply of comfort and health by expending 
energy. 
 
In this book, what I’m really concerned with is not energy, but order. Looking 
at energy as a barren physics concept only leads to confusion because citing 
energy statistics tells you only part of the story. Sure, you can measure energy 
using tactile devices and scientific terminology (which I get into in Chapter 3), 
but what you should ultimately be interested in is not how many joules you’ve 
burned or how many kilowatt-hours a process consumes. The notion of effi-
ciency simply means that mankind accomplishes its goals using less energy.

28
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
To give you a better idea of what I mean by ordered energy, I describe some 
processes in detail in the following list. Think of the details not in terms of a 
lecture on how the process works but in terms of how so many ordered steps 
go together to output specific uses of energy . . . you’ll never turn on your 
vacuum or wash your clothes with the same mindset again! To sharpen the 
concept of ordered energy, consider how energy consumption creates order:
 
✓ Your washers and dryers clean your clothes, but you don’t really need 
to clean your clothes nearly as often as you actually do. What you seek is 
cleanliness, and perhaps you wish to smell better in the process as well. 
You don’t want wrinkled shirts, nor spotty pants. Dirt gets onto you in all 
walks of life, and that is disorder. What you want is to reverse that dis-
order. You want to control the environment and it hardly matters if you 
need to or not. You simply want to, and that’s enough rationale.
 
✓ You use vacuum cleaners in your homes, and you wash your cars using 
water pressure and soap which came from a factory that used energy 
in the manufacturing process. The soap was delivered to the store via 
a truck, which consumes energy. Energy is consumed in every process 
that delivers the soap to the store, and then more energy is consumed in 
bringing that energy home and making good use of it. Even after you’re 
finished, energy is expended in the disposal of the soap.
 
✓ You use electricity for your televisions, which take complex signals 
received from a variety of noise-embedded sources and turn them into 
ordered images that you watch, and listen to. Think of all the disorder 
associated with a television signal, until that last instant when it’s all 
turned into a coherent, ordered image. A great deal of unseen energy is 
expended just so you can enjoy that final burst of coherence — or, if you 
watch network television on any given night, incoherence.
 
✓ You use lasers to change the curvature of your eyes, so that you can 
get rid of those pesky glasses and contact lenses. The laser process 
begins with a big fire in a utility company furnace somewhere far away. 
The fire boils water, which forces a big turbine to spin, which in turn 
generates a coarse form of electricity. That electrical power is fed down 
a long stretch of high voltage power wire, into a local substation where 
the characteristics of the power are altered. Finally the power enters 
your optometrist’s office, but that’s not the end of the story. The power 
is filtered through a series of high-precision electrical networks until it 
finally reaches the laser substrate, which in turn creates highly ordered 
photons that interact with your eye in such a way as to reshape your 
optical lens. Photons are energy, and they are very precisely directed 
toward burning a small portion of your eye, so as to reshape it. At each 
stage of the energy process, there is more order (and a certain degree of 
waste, since nothing is efficient). The entire process culminates in a very 
focused burst of energy, and you can see without eyeglasses once again.

29
 Chapter 2: What Energy Is and How It’s Used (Politically and Practically)
 
✓ You build homes to shelter against the random elements. Homes and 
buildings take a considerable amount of energy not only to build, but 
to run. You have to maintain the home against assaults from Mother 
Nature’s energetic furies. 
 
✓ Transportation gets you to and fro, in an orderly, safe, fast, and efficient 
manner (okay, so maybe I’m not including public transportation here, 
but just think of the energy you expend when your blood begins to boil 
at the fact the train is late!). When you can come and go as you please, 
it’s a form of order. It takes a great deal of energy to afford society this 
luxury.
 
✓ Computers have become geometrically faster, with a commensurate 
increase in the power they consume. The Internet now consumes 
around 8 percent of the electricity produced, and computers in general 
consume around 15 percent. From all of this comes order: 
 
• Work is more productive and faster, not to mention more enjoy-
able and rewarding. 
 
• The American economy produces more economic output per unit 
of energy than any other economy the world has ever seen. 
 
• And the demand for energy to run information systems is increas-
ing faster than any other segment of the economy. 
 
 Americans may be energy pigs, but Americans also produce quite a bit 
with their energy.
From simple to complex: 
The evolution of energy
Energy may be categorized as simple or complex, low-grade and high-grade. 
The simplest energy process that humans exploit are wood fires. Stack some 
dry logs, light them on fire, sit back and enjoy the heat. Wood burning fires 
are an example of low-grade energy, because the benefits are very coarse, 
and the amount of useable work performed is limited to very unfocussed 
heating. Most of the heat generated in a wood fire is lost to the environment, 
as opposed to directed onto a human’s skin. Back in the day, if more heat 
was needed, you stacked more wood, caring nothing about how efficient the 
process was. That resource was seemingly infinite and was treated as such 
throughout most of human history. 
As energy processes evolved and became more directed toward a specific 
end, human civilization evolved as well. Humans became better at burning 
fires, not only extracting more heat from smaller stockpiles of raw materials, 

30
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
but also figuring out how to insulate and keep that heat around longer. Then 
humans figured out how to build steam engines, with their logical valves and 
timing mechanisms, and this launched the industrial age and made life more 
pleasant and healthy. Then along came the internal-combustion engine, then 
electrical generation, then radio, radar, television, lasers, and so on. 
With each successive increment of energy refinement, human life evolved 
and more comfort and convenience resulted. Now that the energy situation 
is changing, society struggles to come to terms with the limitations that are 
being imposed. Society is struggling with the notion that energy supplies 
(insofar as the type of energy that is used) are limited, and that the energy 
being used is affecting the environment in negative ways. Basic attitudes 
about energy are changing in dramatic ways.
Trying to Tap into and Refine an 
Infinite Energy Supply
There is no shortage of energy, and there never has been nor will there 
ever be. Over 35,000 more energy reaches the earth’s surface from the sun 
than humans use in all their aggregate processes. That’s clean energy, and 
completely natural. Geothermal energy comes from heat within the earth, 
and there is an abundance of that particular energy source. (Ultimately, all 
energy sources derive from the sun. Fossil fuels were once life forms which 
relied on the sun for warmth and energy. Plants rely on the sun for their 
basic energy. Animals eat plants, and so on. And there is no shortage of 
sunshine.) So, although infinite energy supplies abound, tapping into and 
refining those supplies is the issue, as I explain in the following sections.
Refining ordered energy
So while there’s no shortage of energy itself, there is a shortage of useable 
forms of energy. The latest projections indicate that there is enough fossil 
fuel to power the world economy for at least another 50 years, and this is fuel 
that comes from proven reserves. With each passing year, more reserves are 
found, and with vast improvements in energy technologies, these reserves 
are cheaper and cheaper to extract. What’s interesting is that it takes so 
much more energy to extract previously inaccessible reserves. The more 
energy that’s found, the more energy that’s used, and energy consumption 
continues to grow with the invention of bigger and better machines for 
energy extraction, and these machines consume huge amounts of energy in 
the process (refer to Chapter 1).

The problem for humanity, then, is not energy, per se, but ordered energy. We 
need more refined energy, in the form of electricity, and high-quality fuels to 
burn in our autos and jets. 
The advances of the industrial revolution were obtained not so much by the 
inventions (although those played an important part) as by the ability to 
create more ordered and refined energy sources. 
Jet engines, which are capable of huge power outputs within small sizes, take 
ordered energy a big step further. They are much more efficient at extracting 
energy from a pound of raw fuel. The reason jets can travel so far and fast is 
not energy, per se, but ordered energy. This is very important because when 
a jet plane first takes off, it must carry all of its own fuel. Jet engines work so 
well now because the fuels have been refined and improved, and it’s possible 
to extract much more energy per unit weight from these fuels. By ordering 
the energy producing process much better, bigger jets are possible, as well 
as more efficient air travel, which allows for cheaper tickets and happier 
customers.
 
There is no shortage of energy; there is only a shortage of ordered, useable 
energy, and in providing ordered energy there is inherent waste. For example, 
it takes around two gallons of gasoline to get one gallon to the fuel pump near 
your house. The solution to the energy problem is finding better ways to order 
the energy sources that society has access to.
Bridging the gap between 
policy and pollution
The U.S. does not have an energy crisis. It has an environmental energy 
policy crisis. To make my point, I go back to solar. There is no shortage of 
solar power, but the vast majority of it is simply an incoherent barrage of 
unordered photons. You can lay in the sun, and warm yourself, but you can 
only do this on a warm, sunny day. In order to harness solar power, you need 
intelligent machines that can convert the incoherent barrage of photons into 
ordered, intelligent electrical signals that work with our appliances. And even 
then, you’re limited by the availability of sunshine. At night, you’re out of 
luck, so you need energy storage mechanisms. It’s easy to store a gallon of 
gasoline, but it’s impossible to store a roomful of photons.
It’s in the ordering of energy where the problems lie. When we create ordered 
energy out of chaos, the unfortunate reality is that we must also create chaos 
in our wake (I get into this in more detail in Chapter 3). It’s not the ordered 
energy that is the problem; it’s the chaos. There are two kinds of chaos left 

32
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
over from the creation of ordered energy; there’s heat and there’s pollution. 
The heat is rarely an environmental problem, although when large power 
plants discharge wastewater into rivers and streams, the heat can alter the 
natural ecosystem in damaging ways. For the most part, it’s the pollution 
chaos that is causing so much harm to both the environment and human 
health.
Environmental energy policy directly addresses the chaos side of the equation. 
Governmental policy has historically been directed toward ensuring a 
continuous and consistent flow of raw energy supplies into the economy. 
Secondarily, environmental protection laws have been passed that regulate 
the way pollution chaos can be released into the environment. There has 
been very little attempt to bridge the gap between these two disparate ends. 
Part of the problem has been that there is no collective will among American 
voters to ramp up environmental protection laws, but that’s beginning to 
change. People are becoming more and more aware that energy chaos is 
causing not only damaging effects, but permanently damaging effects. It’s one 
thing to live with one’s pollution, but it’s entirely another matter to insist that 
your children also live with our pollution.
Getting energy leads to 
energy consumption
The biggest expenditure of energy on the planet earth, by far, is used to 
extract and refine energy. When you use an electrical outlet to provide power 
for a light bulb, you’re tapping into a huge interconnected system of coal 
mines, railroad lines, massive combustion furnace turbines, transformers, 
high voltage transmission lines, substations, electric meters, and household 
wiring systems. 
The nature of ordered energy is that most of it is wasted (a concept 
that is explained more fully in Chapter 3). Take light bulbs, for example. 
Incandescent bulbs convert only 10 percent of their consumed energy into 
light, and most of this light is wasted. For instance, when you’re out of a 
room being illuminated by light bulbs, the energy is wasted. And you’re 
certainly not taking in all of the light that a bulb puts out, even when you’re 
in a room. 
 
Energy use leads to more energy use. When new, better means of producing 
ordered energy are developed, new uses are found and the demand goes up. 
So, the key is for society to find more efficiency in its processes so that people 
can continue to maintain their lifestyles while at the same time consume less 
energy.

33
 Chapter 2: What Energy Is and How It’s Used (Politically and Practically)
Reshaping Energy Policy to 
Include Alternatives
Okay, so there’s an infinite source of energy out there, and someone just has 
to get out there and figure out a way to refine it into useable, ordered energy 
without too much pollution or negative environmental effects. So what’s the 
problem? Oh, yeah — politicians.
It would probably take an entire book to catalog the money and power 
associated with the minutia of energy policy. So I’ll just leave it at: It’s 
complicated. However, Americans have the ability and know-how to not 
only reshape the energy policy but also turn the tide for alternative usage. 
Americans have to come to a consensus and push politicians for alternatives 
and research. But first, you have to understand the underpinnings of both 
sides of the debate as well as the availability of alternatives. So the following 
sections break it all down for you.
Political posturing over energy policy
There is considerable political interest in energy these days, and rightly so. 
Here’s how the sides break down:
On one side are those who oppose a lot of new energy plants and dictate 
which type of plants can be built and where. Their concern is primarily 
with the effects that energy consumption imposes on the environment, 
not the least of which is global warming. And the existence of global 
warming is a political question. 
On the other side are those who believe that Mother Nature can absorb 
whatever is thrown at her. These people oppose restrictions on new 
power plants, regardless of the type. They deny the existence of global 
warming and insist that the earth is in a natural state of temperature flux. 
In their view, mankind is far too small an effect on the earth to make a 
material difference.
For my part, I’m very much a political centrist. I find the partisanship and 
stubbornness of the fanatical fringes of all stripes curious. Here, I take no 
active position in the global warming debate. Instead, I present data that 
shows how our current energy consumption is affecting the planet, and I 
make only a nonpartisan observation that we should be doing better at not 
affecting our planet. 

34
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
It’s very simple, in my view. Humans leave too much havoc in their wake. 
Society can have the energy that it craves so much, without having to rely on 
dubious foreign sources of fossil fuels and the political instability that arises 
from such. Mankind can use more energy without affecting the environment 
negatively. I do not push for one solution over another, except that I do 
push for a wiser course of action. Our energy problems can be solved with 
alternative energy sources.
What America’s policy needs
The historical record indicates that societies grow and flourish with more 
and more energy consumption and that societies that expand and develop 
their energy-producing facilities conquer those that don’t. This is true 
militarily, in particular, but it’s also true when one considers questions of the 
basic quality of life (Chapter 1 explains the connection between the evolution 
of energy sources and civilization). 
Our government’s policy should be to expand the availability of cheap 
energy, not to try to shrink it. Restricting energy use will surely result in 
economic stagnation, and nobody is in favor of that. Yet it seems imperative 
that the use of fossil fuels be reduced, so what happens then? Reducing fossil 
fuel consumption does not automatically mean lowering the standard of 
living. You can transition to alternatives. The path is clear and the technologies, 
while immature, are ready for market. But there is no record of successful 
societies reducing their fossil fuel use, so the magnitude of the challenge 
seems daunting. 
Bottom line: Society needs consistent, inexpensive sources of energy in 
order to maintain and grow. Americans are and have been the most inventive, 
creative society that ever graced the planet. Because nobody else on the 
globe is going to lead the way into an alternative-energy future, it’s up to 
America, and America has met incredible challenges before.
The argument for alternatives
The major political thrust today is geared toward ensuring continuous flows 
of fossil fuels. At the same time, politicians recognize that society’s neck is 
stuck way out when America relies on dubious energy sources. Here is where 
alternative energy sources come into play in the political picture:
 
✓ Alternative sources free us from the need to maintain consistent flows 
of fossil fuels from overseas. This is desirable politically as well as 
economically. Foreign sources of oil know how badly we need their 
energy supplies, and they play games and hold us up (successfully) 
because they know they have the upper hand.

35
 Chapter 2: What Energy Is and How It’s Used (Politically and Practically)
 
✓ Alternative sources are “distributed,” which means that they can be 
located here and there, on a micro level. If there were enough solar 
panels distributed around the country, for instance, a major disruption 
in the flow of fossil fuels would have much less impact because the 
solar energy sources would still be working. The same is true of nuclear 
power and biomass. Relying on a small number of huge power sources is 
bad politics.
 
✓ A lot of money is sent overseas by way of our trade deficit, and fossil 
fuels comprise a major component of the trade deficit. Keeping more 
money at home will help the American economy.
 
✓ There is a tremendously powerful green movement that lobbies hard 
in Washington for changes in our energy policies. Alternative energy 
schemes are very popular with the greens, and rightly so.
Looking at alternative, renewable, 
and sustainable energy sources
To make sure that resources last, humans need to focus on alternative, 
renewable, and sustainable energy sources. Energy sources that fail to meet 
these criteria could eventually be depleted and thus cease to exist.
But what, exactly, do the words alternative, renewable, and sustainable mean? 
They’re being knocked around quite a bit these days, and you probably hear 
them quite a bit. All three of these terms are typically associated with energy 
conservation, even though that is not the case in all instances. The following 
sections tell you what you need to know about each.
How much does fossil fuel really cost? 
Some people argue that a large part of our mili-
tary is dedicated toward ensuring the consis-
tent supply of fossil fuel energy sources. The 
solution, in their view, is to somehow include 
the cost of all of our military and political ven-
tures into the price of fossil fuels. This is a 
valid point. A lot of money and political capital 
is spent ensuring the consistent flow of fossil 
fuel sources, but these costs are not directly 
assigned to how much is paid for fossil fuels at 
the pump. Some estimates indicate that gaso-
line prices would double if the accounting were 
truly fair. But imagine the political upheaval that 
would result if that were to happen. Even more 
to the point, what politician is going to propose 
doubling the price of gasoline?

36
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
Alternative energy
Alternative forms of energy are those that don’t include fossil fuels or 
carbon-combustible products such as gasoline, coal, natural gas, and so 
on. The origination of the term arises from a need to find alternatives to the 
hydrocarbon-based combustion processes that now dominate the American 
economy.
Renewable energy
Renewable forms of energy constantly replenish themselves with little or no 
human effort. Solar energy is just one example — no matter how much you 
use, the supply will never end (okay, it may end after billions of years, but 
your using solar power won’t make the sun burn out any faster). Other exam-
ples of renewables include firewood, water (via hydroelectric dams), and 
wind power. The benefits of renewables are that they replenish themselves 
and so relieve society of its reliance on dwindling, finite supplies. Oil and 
natural gas, and to a lesser extent, nuclear power, are not renewable because 
the resources that supply these forms of energy are finite.
 
Renewables are not necessarily good for the environment. Wood burning, for 
instance, can be very noxious, particularly when it’s done inefficiently. 
Sustainable energy
Sustainable forms of energy are not only renewable (see the section, 
“Renewable energy,” earlier), but they also have the ability to keep the planet 
Earth’s ecosystem up and running in perpetuity. The basic notion behind 
sustainable energy sources is that by their use, society is not compromising 
future generations’ health and well-being. In addition, by using sustainable 
energy sources, society doesn’t compromise future generations’ ability to 
use their own sustainable resources to the same extent that those resources 
are used now. Who can argue with this very fundamental version of the 
Golden Rule?
The impetus for renewables
Every year, U.S. coal power plants deposit 
100,000 pounds of mercury into the atmosphere, 
in addition to the two billion tons of carbon diox-
ide. And each year nuclear power plants pro-
duce 2,000 tons of radioactive waste. There are 
already over 400,000 tons of radioactive waste 
waiting for some kind of suitable disposal, 
and the political complexity of finding good 
solutions has stonewalled all progress.
Most U.S. energy is imported, which channels 
hundreds of billions of dollars out of the U.S. 
economy, into foreign nations with dubious and 
often hostile political systems. The renewable 
energy sources used in the U.S. are generally 
locally grown and harvested, which means 
local jobs and local economic power.

▶ Grasping the key laws 
▶ Eyeing the importance of electrical energy
▶ Focusing on factors that affect fuel costs
A
s you check out the big-picture reality of energy, including its costs, 
measurements, production, and alternatives, you have to keep in mind 
some hard facts of energy consumption:
 
✓ Physics followers: Regardless of whether the source of energy is fossil-
fuel based or alternative, the inevitable laws of physics govern energy 
production and energy-consumption processes. 
 
✓ Measurements and metrics: The measurements and metrics are always 
the same. 
 
✓ Cost of energy: There’s more to the cost of energy than just the cost of 
the raw fuel itself. You have the costs associated with the machines that 
extract and refine the energy, the cost of converting the fuel to useable 
energy, and so on. 
When considering energy and how viable alternatives are, you have to take 
the whole picture into account. This chapter explains how energy is measured 
(horsepower, joules, and so on), how all energy processes are inherently 
inefficient, and what the real costs are — tangible concepts that help you 
understand the issues inherent in all types of energy, including alternatives. 

38
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
Wrapping Your Mind Around 
the Metrics of Energy
Oooh . . . scary! Yes, I know “the metrics of energy” may sound frightening, 
but understanding a few things, such as how energy is measured and types of 
efficiencies as well as the difference between energy and power can give you 
a better grasp of the entire energy discussion. I promise — it’s not scary!
Understanding energy versus power
When you talk about your energy bill or your power bill, you mean the same 
thing and use the terms interchangeably. And everyone listening to you as 
you discuss your energy or power bill understands that you’re referring to 
the same bill because in many contexts, the words energy and power are 
interchangeable. Yet the terms mean subtly different things, and understanding 
these subtle differences gives you a head start to better understanding the 
basics of energy:
 
✓ Energy: The total amount of effort — or work — it takes to accomplish a 
certain task. To run up a hill, to heat your home, or to dry your hair are 
all examples of energy. 
 
 Your monthly utility bill is calculated in units of energy. When you pay 
your utility bill, you pay for energy, not power. 
 
 In the international system (SI), a unit of energy is a joule.
 
✓ Power: The speed with which energy is being expended to achieve a 
task. More power means the task is completed more quickly. When 
your electric meter spins, it’s measuring power – the faster the meter 
spins, the more power you are using. At the end of each month, the 
total number of revolutions your meter has spun determines your total 
energy usage. In other words, more power means more energy. Power is 
calculated by dividing energy by time.
 
To understand the connection between the energy and power, think about 
driving a car up a hill. It takes a certain amount of energy to get a car to the 
top of the hill. How much energy depends on things like the weight of the car 
and its occupants. A car that is twice as heavy takes twice as much energy 
to crest a hill. It takes the same amount of energy to drive the car up the hill 
slowly as it does to drive it up fast (excluding aerodynamic factors we’re not 
interested in here). The more power a car has, the faster it will be able to 
reach the crest of the hill; a very low-powered car can still make it to the top, 
it just won’t be as much fun.

 Chapter 3: Putting Together Each Piece of the Energy Puzzle
Common measurements
Engineers describe all energy processes in terms of numbers — it’s the ver-
nacular of the industry. For the purposes of this book, we don’t need to get 
into a lot of math and numbers, and I describe most of the energy processes 
without resorting to high-level descriptions. But you still need a rudimentary 
understanding of the basic measurement terms and values because numbers 
are just plain inescapable. Don’t worry — just think of this as that special 
page in the Betty Crocker Cookbook that shows you all of the measurement 
conversions. 
Following are the measurements associated with energy:
 
✓ Joule: The basic unit of energy in the international system is the joule (J). 
 
 1J = 1 Kg m2/s2 (kilogram meter squared per second squared)
 
✓ Btu: In the English system, the basic unit of energy is the ft-lb, or Btu. A 
typical home consumes between 50 to 100 million Btus to heat and cool 
over the course of a year.
 
 1J = 0.738 ft-lb = 9.478 Btu
 
✓ Watt: Power is energy divided by time, and the standard unit of 
measurement is the watt.
 
 1 Watt (W) = 1 joule/second = 3.412 Btu/hr
 
✓ Horsepower: The traditional measurement for power, using horses as 
the standard. The power with one horse equals one horsepower. The 
engine in a typical auto has over 160 horsepower; bigger and faster cars 
have engines upwards of 300 horsepower.
 
 1 HP = 0.746 kW (kilowatt)
 
✓ Calorie: In physics terms, the amount of energy required to raise the 
temperature of exactly one gram of pure liquid water by exactly one 
degree Celsius. One calorie is 4.184 joules.
 
✓ 1 Quad: A large amount of energy, equivalent to 1015 Btu.
Energy and volume density measurements
The amount of energy that is contained in a unit of fuel (either weight or 
volume) is called the energy density. This is the amount of potential energy 
available in a given weight or volume of that fuel. Energy density determines 
how large a storage device is needed or how heavy a fuel will be in that 
storage device. Table 3-1 lists the energy densities for common raw fuels.

40
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
Table 3-1

Hydrogen

Enriched uranium

Battery
60 Btus per pound
As Table 3-1 shows, hydrocarbons (fossil fuels, like heating oil, natural gas, and 
so on) are much more energy dense compared to other fuels, and this explains 
why they’re so extensively used. For unit weight, hydrocarbons offer the high-
est useable energy content, and so the economics favor hydrocarbons. Plus, 
fossil fuels are generally easier to store and transport than other fuels.
Just how much energy does that take?
Here’s a list that gives an idea of the relative 
amounts of energy that are involved in various 
processes. Note: The numbers in this table 
are written in exponential, or scientific, 
notation, a system that makes representing (and 
manipulating) very large or very small numbers 
easier. The number 100 billion (100,000,000,000), 
for example, appears as 1011 in scientific 
notation; the number 0.001 is written as 10-3.

Note how small the last two values are. The 
reason atomic fission produces so much energy 
is that the number of atoms “burned” is so huge. 
In a nuclear power plant there are billions and 
billions of tiny atomic reactions, which taken 
together, produce massive amounts of energy. 
The same may be said for the burning of one 
carbon atom. In thermal energy processes, 
massive amounts of atoms are burned.

41
 Chapter 3: Putting Together Each Piece of the Energy Puzzle
Energy density differences between gasoline and batteries highlight the 
fundamental problem with electric cars. It takes over 300 pounds of battery 
to store the equivalent of one gallon of gasoline. 
Types of efficiencies
Efficiency is another useful metric. Efficiency is important in every energy pro-
cess because it describes how much waste is being generated, in relation to 
the useable work that is being achieved. Some alternative energy processes are 
not very efficient, but they’re still valuable processes. For instance, wood burn-
ing is inefficient in terms of how much useable heat energy can be obtained 
from a given mass of raw fuel. Yet wood burning is a very important part of 
the alternative energy scenario. Understanding the different types of efficiency 
helps to understand why some processes are better than others. There are a 
number of different ways to define efficiency, as the following sections explain.
Energy efficiency
Energy efficiency is simply the ratio of the useful work obtained from a 
process, by the raw power taken to achieve that process. This is intuitive, 
but a definition hardens the concept. 
An open fireplace, for example, is very inefficient because most of the potential 
energy that is stored in a piece of firewood goes up the chimney and heats 
the great outdoors instead of the home space that it’s intended to heat. A 
perfectly efficient fireplace would direct all of its heat onto the skin of the 
people sitting nearby. An enclosed wood stove, on the other hand, has good 
insulation and a very hot fire — the efficiency is much greater and the cost of 
burning wood in a stove is much less, given the same heating capacity.
Automotive fuel efficiency
Fuel efficiency in a car means the amount of miles that can be driven on 
a gallon of gasoline. A smaller car with a smaller engine gets better fuel 
efficiency than a big gas pig. The ratio of passenger weight to total vehicle 
weight is also smaller, which increases the efficiency even more. In fact, the 
most efficient transport is a bicycle because the ratio of passenger weight to 
total vehicle weight is nearly one.
Operating efficiency
Efficiency measures can be very specific to a particular system or machine, 
but they can also reflect broader issues. Operating efficiency is the efficiency 
of all the individual parts that comprise a whole. The operating efficiency of a 
home’s HVAC system, for example, depends on a number of factors, not just 
the efficiency of the HVAC system itself: things like the quality of the home’s 
insulation, how leaky the home is, and so on. Due to other factors, the home’s 
overall efficiency may be poor, even if the HVAC is very efficient.

42
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
The operating efficiency is the value that has the most meaning because it 
takes into account all the things that can impact efficiency endeavors. Of 
course, when operating efficiencies are poor, you can improve the situation 
by looking at and addressing inefficiencies in the individual components. 
Cost efficiency
Cost efficiency is the cost of accomplishing a task divided by the amount of 
work that is done. This may be the most important efficiency measurement, 
as it determines how much it will cost to perform an energy process. With 
some fuels, even though the energy efficiency is high, the cost of the fuel 
is also high, so the cost efficiency may not be that good. Ultimately, most 
people are concerned with cost efficiency. The impetus to increase gas 
mileage for autos has more to do with cost efficiency than energy efficiency.
Cost efficiency and energy efficiency are generally the same thing, but not 
always. If you’re chopping your own firewood from your backyard and using 
it to heat your home, that’s very cost efficient. But if you’re burning the wood 
in a leaky old stove, it’s not energy efficient. Burning your wood in a open 
fireplace is not only energy inefficient, it’s cost inefficient as well unless you 
have a ready availability of firewood that you can cut yourself, in which case 
the cost efficiency may be very good, although you’ll end up doing a lot of 
work.
Pollution efficiency
Pollution efficiency, a term that’s becoming more common, is the amount of 
work performed by a process divided by the amount of pollution generated 
by that process. The pollution efficiency of electrical power is terrible. Coal 
fired furnaces provide most electrical power in the US, and they’re dirty. And 
electrical power from the grid is very energy inefficient as it moves through 
the grid. But solar PV power, on the other hand, is very pollution efficient.
Pollution efficiency, more than cost efficiency, is the most compelling argu-
ment in favor of alternative energy sources. With the economic infrastructure 
of fossil fuels, most alternative energy schemes are less cost efficient than 
fossil fuels, but the pollution efficiencies are much better. This will be chang-
ing, as taxes and government mandates begin to drive the cost of fossil fuels 
higher. Carbon taxes are simply a way to converge the cost efficiencies of 
fossil fuels and alternatives in order to make alternatives more financially 
attractive. (Carbon taxes are just what they sound like; a tax on any energy 
source that uses hydrocarbon fuels, and emits carbon pollution.)

The Fundamental Laws Governing 
Energy Consumption
There are a number of basic fundamentals to all energy processes, and in 
order to understand why some processes are better than others, it’s worth 
looking into the basics. There is only so much that can be done to improve 
the energy situation, and there are hard limits. Most people seem to believe 
that energy efficiency and conservation can lead us out of the wilderness, but 
in this section I explain why this is going to be a very difficult road to travel. 
In this section things get somewhat abstract because the underlying physics is 
very complex. But the basic ideas can be understood by everybody, so forge 
on with your chin up.
First law of thermodynamics
Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as using energy. All energy consuming 
processes follow the first law of thermodynamics, which states that energy 
can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only change forms. We consume 
energy, but what we’re really doing is using energy in one form (gasoline, for 
instance) and converting that into other forms. 
What we seek when we consume energy is to change the form of the energy 
into useable work. As that work progresses, the energy changes form once 
again, usually into heat energy released back into the environment. Massive 
consumption of fossil fuels releases an equally massive amount of heat into 
the environment (among other things, like pollutants, but that’s another 
story). Consider these examples:
 
✓ When we burn gasoline in an auto engine, we emit heat from the 
exhaust, and we emit even more chemicals than what we put into the 
gas tank. For each gallon of gasoline (weighing around six pounds) we 
emit over 20 pounds of hydrocarbons. We heat the air, due to friction 
when we move. We heat the engine, and that heat is expelled into the 
environment. The energy of movement converts into heat energy into 
the environment. While it takes energy to make a car move, it also takes 
energy to make a car come to a stop. And the energy used to stop the 
car becomes heat in the brake pads, which then dissipates into the 
environment. 

44
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
 
✓ When we burn wood in a stove, we create heat in the room. While the 
room may cool down over time, once the fire goes out, the heat does not 
simply go away; rather, it leaks out of the space where we want the heat. 
That heat energy that we generate from burning the wood ultimately 
came from a long growth period for the tree that took sunshine and 
converted it into wood mass.
 
✓ Solar electric systems convert energetic photons into electrical energy, 
which in turn gets converted into some other form of energy depending 
on which appliances in the house we are powering. The appliances then 
emit heat into the environment.
 
✓ Nuclear energy comes from splitting atoms, which generates massive 
amounts of heat, and that is used to boil water which drives turbines 
which generate electricity. At each step in the process, inefficiencies 
generate even more heat.
 
✓ When we use an air-conditioner, we consume electricity (generated a 
long distance away) to power a compressor which moves heat from 
our interior rooms, out into the environment. We use energy to move 
energy. When we cool a room, we power compressors that generate a 
lot of heat in the process. All that heat escapes into the environment, 
along with the heat we remove from the room.
 
All fossil fuel is burned, or combusted. Millions of years ago, life forms on the 
planet died and collected in deposits that either solidified (as with coal) or 
liquefied (as with crude oil) or gasified (as with natural gas). The vast majority 
of our energy needs are met with fossil fuels, and these are all burned so as to 
generate heat. We convert this heat into useable work, or ordered energy, and 
then when we use that ordered energy, the vast majority of the energy is con-
verted back into heat.
Second law of thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics states: disorder of any closed system can 
only increase — in plain English — waste is unavoidable. The physics term 
for disorder is “entropy,” and the mathematics and physics are very complex, 
so I will not get into it here. Think of disorder as nothing more than chaos.
The second law of thermodynamics is every bit as important in the scheme 
of energy consumption. It states that the disorder (or entropy) of any closed 
system can only increase, or, to put it more simply, every energy conversion 
process produces at least as much waste as it does useable energy. This 
implies a limit to how efficient we can make energy consumption processes.

Examples of the second law in action
At each stage of an energy generating process, more energy is wasted than 
gets passed on to the next phase of the process. As we invent more sophisti-
cated machines, we need more and more refined energy, and so the problem 
of waste only grows with our increasingly complex information economy. A 
very sophisticated machine wastes more energy than a coarse machine. A 
high speed computer wastes hordes of energy; an abacus very little. Bottom 
line? There is no such thing as 100 percent efficient because all energy 
consuming activities are wasteful. This is not a cynical comment on humans’ 
inability to create efficiency, it’s a physical fact. In a perfect world, there will 
be a lot of waste.
Here are some examples of the second law at work:
 
✓ When we generate electricity, we will always end up throwing away at 
least as much energy as the electricity we are creating. 
 
✓ In the process of driving a car up a hill, a certain amount of energy is 
expended. At least that much energy is also wasted. In fact, more is 
wasted due to inefficiencies.
 
✓ The huge power plants that utilities employ to generate electrical energy 
discard a sizable proportion of the raw energy consumed by way of 
wasted heat into the environment. Smaller power plants are even worse. 
See the section “Why bigger is better” for details.
 
Waste may not be desirable, and we would like to minimize it, but there’s only 
so much we can do. We cannot violate the laws of physics, and the second law 
of thermodynamics implies a limit to how well we can do. This is not to say 
that we have to give up the game. What we must do is get smarter about what 
we are doing with all the energy we consume and about what types of raw 
energy we are consuming. In particular, if waste is unavoidable, we need to 
mange that waste much better than we have been doing.
Looking at efficiency pyramids 
Humans seek ordered energy, not simply energy (refer to Chapter 2). In the 
process of ordering energy, a huge amount of energy is tossed aside. This is 
as inevitable as the sun coming up tomorrow. As per the second law, it is by 
tossing aside energy that we achieve the ordered energy that we seek.
Compare a laser system to sunlight. Sunshine is a mad rush of photons of 
all wavelengths flying willy-nilly through the air; a laser’s light is the exact 
opposite. In lasers, which are highly focused beams of light, the photons are 
in lock-step with each other. They all match in frequency, and they’re all in 
phase, which means the individual wavelengths are aligned. The energy of a 
laser beam is as dense as the core of a nuclear reactor. With sunlight you can 
grow grass in a pasture (a nice enough thing to do, but it does have limitations). 
With lasers you can shape a human eye with striking precision.

46
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
But a laser is also a tremendous waste because it takes so much energy to 
create those highly coherent photons. The same limitations apply to comput-
ers, automobiles, and several other products. 
Transport, in general, involves a huge waste of energy. Figure 3-1 illustrates 
the pyramid nature of the wasted energy process in building an automobile. 
Note how much energy is consumed in the factory that builds the auto. This 
represents the invested energy, the energy used to manufacture a product 
(in the literature, you may see this referred to as embodied energy, or grey 
energy, but it all means essentially the same thing). When the auto is moving, 
the vast majority of energy expended goes toward moving the machinery, 
as opposed to the occupants. So moving a passenger — represented by the 
thin spire at the top of the pyramid — required all the energy expended for 
refinement, manufacturing, and moving the car itself. If you consider that the 
passenger could have moved much more efficiently under the power of his or 
her own two feet, you can see that transport, in general, entails a huge waste 
of energy.

Pyramids may be drawn for any energy consuming process, and the graphical 
nature brings to light the second law of thermodynamics: that the more 
refined or controlled the energy process, the more waste is involved.
Carnot’s law
At the turn of the century, steam engines were the predominant form of 
energy generation in our economy. The fact that steam engines required a lot 
of wood and water necessitated an efficiency analysis to find ways to lower 
costs while producing the same power levels. As a consequence, a French 
engineer named Henri Carnot came up with a very important law which 
governs all combustion machines. In a nutshell, Carnot’s law states that the 

47
 Chapter 3: Putting Together Each Piece of the Energy Puzzle
maximum efficiency of any thermal energy process is determined by the 
difference in temperature between the combustion chamber and the exhaust 
environment where the waste is channeled.
Now, I didn’t just choose this particular law out of a physics hat; instead, 
as the following sections reveal, Carnot’s law helps to explain the efficiency 
of larger versus smaller power plants as well as finally explain why you pay 
peak and off-peak rates for power.
Practical implications
According to Carnot’s law, it’s the temperature difference that matters, not 
the temperature of the actual combustion process. According to Carnot’s 
law, the higher the temperature of the combustion process, the better. But 
that’s only half the story. The exhaust temperature is just as important. 
When the outdoor temperature is high, the efficiency of a combustion 
process also goes down because the difference in temperature between the 
combustion chamber and the ambient is less.
Here are the practical implications of Carnot’s law:
 
✓ A steam engine working in a cold climate is more efficient than in a hot 
climate because the exhaust ambient is cooler. This is true even if the 
combustion temperature is the same in both climates. 
 
✓ A steam engine with a hotter burning fire is more efficient; for that 
reason, well insulated combustion chambers work more efficiently.
 
✓ The most efficient engine of all is the jet turbine because the fuels are 
burned at tremendously high temperatures and pressures and the 
exhaust temperature is very cold.
 
✓ Residential natural gas heaters work better when the gas is burned at a 
hotter temperature.
 
✓ Wood stoves work much better than open pit fireplaces because the 
burn temperature inside of a stove can be much greater than in an 
open pit.
Why bigger is better
Within the context of alternative energy solutions, the Carnot cycle is 
important because it explains why larger power plants are more efficient 
than smaller ones.
Coal fired power plants burn raw coal to boil water, which is used to turn 
huge turbines that create electricity. As per Carnot’s law, the hotter the coal 
is burned in relationship to the exhaust temperature the more efficient the 
plant operation will be. 

48
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
Consider the size of a burn chamber. Each chamber has a volume and a 
surface area. The surface area causes inefficiency because heat escapes 
through the surfaces, into the surrounding ambient. When heat escapes 
through the surface, as opposed to being used to generate steam, the internal 
temperature goes down and so there are two effects which lower efficiency: 
escaping heat and lower internal temperatures.
Imagine the burn chamber as a large sphere. The larger the diameter of 
the sphere, the higher the internal temperature can be because the ratio of 
volume to surface area is proportional to the diameter of the sphere. With 
a larger sphere, the inefficiencies are much smaller. Less of a percentage of 
heat escapes through the surface area, and the internal temperature can be 
higher because the temperature will be the hottest at the central core.
This is the key reason why power plants are built in massive scales (other, 
less important reasons include things like transport efficiencies of the raw 
materials and wastes). These power plants can be located far from urban 
areas, so they are out of sight. 
The problem with “peak power” times 
Summer peak times are a utility company’s nightmare. Peak power consump-
tion occurs on hot summer afternoons. This is when the utility is called upon 
to provide the maximum amount of electrical power because air conditioning 
uses electricity. At peak times, businesses and offices are all using their air-
conditioners, and homes are also cranking away. (Peak power issues do not 
occur in the winter, when it’s really cold, because a large percentage of heat-
ing energy comes from non-electrical sources, like wood, natural gas, etc.)
When the utilities cannot meet power demand with their massive power 
plants, they need to call upon smaller utility providers, and many of these 
are little more than huge diesel engines connected to generators. According 
to Carnot’s law, these smaller power generating machines can never achieve 
the efficiencies of the massive power plants, and this means the cost of the 
power is necessarily higher. And operating at peak when the outdoor tem-
perature is high means that the combustion process is even less efficient. 
So the utilities take a big economic hit when they need to call up the backup 
power plants. This is the impetus for peak and off-peak rates, more com-
monly called time-of-use, or TOU. A special meter is installed at a user’s 
location which can measure power consumption at peak times (usually noon 
to six PM) and off peak times. The utility charges different rates for these 
times, often as high as a three to one ratio. TOU metering serves to decrease 
the consumption at peak times, which is good economics for society. In the 
future, it is likely that all new buildings will be outfitted with TOU meters.

Understanding Electrical Energy
The vast majority of electrical energy is produced by burning fossil fuels, 
a topic I cover in detail in Chapter 5. And most of the energy used in the 
commercial and residential sectors is electrical energy. For that reason, 
it’s of value to look at how electricity works, and some of the numbers that 
describe the process. Regardless of whether conventional energy sources are 
used, or alternative, the physics of electricity is equally important. 
A short primer on electricity
All atoms have electrons, which have negative charges (unlike the protons, 
another part of the atom, that have positive charges). When the electrons 
can break free, or detach, from their atoms and move through a substance, 
whether solid, liquid, or gas, you get electricity. 
How freely electrons move depends on how easily they can break away from 
their constituent atoms. In materials like cotton, wood, plastic, and glass, the 
electrons are stuck; they can’t move around because they are captured by the 
atom that they belong to. These materials are insulators. In metals, on the other 
hand, the electrons are only slightly held to their host atoms and are able to 
move around. Because these materials enable the flow of electricity, they’re 
called conductors. (Some materials, like semiconductors, which are at the heart 
of all electronics devices, have properties that are somewhere between metals 
and insulators. The electrons can flow, but only under special conditions.)
The electrons flow through a conductor if something spurs their movement. 
That something is a voltage. When a voltage, or electromotive force, is 
applied to a material, the electrons flow depending on the amount of 
resistance the material has. Resistance is just a measure of how easily the 
electrical charge flows through a substance. Metals have low resistances, 
whereas insulators feature very high resistances. As you can imagine, 
resistance causes inefficiency. When the resistance of a material is very high, 
it takes a lot of energy to move the electrons through that material. 
Producing electrical power 
efficiently and safely
The challenge power plants face in making the power they produce available 
to customers is how to maximize efficiency and at the same time control the 
voltage so that it can be used with some degree of safety. 

50
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
Power transmission wires are resistors — as the previous section explains, 
all electrical paths have resistance of some kind or another, there’s no 
escaping it. As the power travels through the transmission wires, the power 
dissipates. One way to reduce the power dissipation is to get the current that 
travels through the lines as low as possible. 
Because electrical power is equal to voltage times current (P = VI), it’s possible 
to raise the voltage and reduce the current and still end up with the same 
amount of power. In reducing the current, the line losses are reduced as is 
the amount of power wasted in the transmission process. (Note: All these 
ideas can be expressed mathematically, but you don’t need to know the for-
mulas to understand the general concepts; if you’re interested, though, pop 
to the sidebar “Formulas for the math minded.”)
Therefore, it is very desirable to use extremely high voltages on transmission 
lines. The result is transmission lines that commonly have voltages over a 
hundred thousand volts. That’s all well and good, but household voltages are 
110VAC. To solve this problem, you need transformers to convert the high 
voltages down to the relatively safe and manageable household voltages. 
Formulas for the math minded
There are a number of formulas that let you cal-
culate electrical power. In reading these formu-
las, keep in mind these definitions:
Voltage (V): The electrical “pressure” between 
two points on a circuit. When the voltage is very 
high, there is a strong force that encourages 
the flow of electricity, or the flow of electrons 
to be more precise.
Current (I): The amount of electrical flow, or the 
sum total of all the electrons which are flowing.
Resistance (R): The resistance to electrical 
flow. 
Here are the mathematical relationships 
between voltage, current, and resistance: 
Formula
Translation
P = VI
Electrical power is equal to Voltage times Current. This formula shows that you can 
raise the voltage and reduce the current and end up with the same result
P = V2/R
Power equals voltage squared divided by resistance
V = IR
Voltage equals current times resistance 
P = I2R
Power equals current squared times resistance

51
 Chapter 3: Putting Together Each Piece of the Energy Puzzle
 
The electrical grid is a huge complex of power transmission wires and trans-
formers that alter the voltage/current characteristics of the power being deliv-
ered to utility customers. All of this is done to enhance the overall efficiency 
of the entire system. In essence, with all electrical systems, the higher the 
voltage that can be used, the lower the inefficiencies. Solar PV panels, for 
instance, are configured to create the highest voltages possible if there is 
some length of wire between the solar panels and the end user. This effect is 
also why large appliances use higher voltages – because they use so much 
power, it is highly desirable to reduce the wasted energy in line losses as 
much as possible.
Tracking the Real Cost of Power
Until the steam engine came on the scene, most energy was expended on 
growing crops and feeding animals. And up until 100 years ago, most energy 
was harvested at the surface of the earth, at great hardship and labor. The 
costs of obtaining raw fuel were much greater than the costs of the equip-
ment used to burn that fuel. There were no sophisticated machines that per-
formed magical feats by consuming ordered energy. People’s energy needs 
were much simpler: obtain heat and cook food. But that’s changed drastically. 
The real cost of power is impacted by a number of things: the cost of raw 
fuel, the cost of converting that fuel to useable energy, the cost of the equip-
ment and its upkeep, and so on. The following sections explain how these 
factors affect the real cost of power. What you’ll discover — perhaps to your 
surprise — is that raw fuel costs actually play a relatively small part in the 
overall cost. 
Raw fuel costs 
In recent years, the American economy has spent around $400 billion per 
year on raw fuel. With oil costing $100 a barrel, this number has increased, 
but it still represents less than the total capital outlay dedicated to producing 
and consuming energy. 
Taking a look at the relative costs of different types of raw energy is illuminat-
ing. (By raw, I mean the cost at delivery; this doesn’t take into account how 
the energy is actually used, or how much the equipment costs to convert 
the raw energy into useable form; see the next section for that). Relatively 
speaking, electricity is the most costly, nuclear energy is the cheapest, and a 
bunch of other types of energy fall somewhere in between (see Table 3-2).

As Table 3-2 shows, electricity is by far the costliest energy source. This is 
because the power transmission grid, the huge matrix of power wires and 
transformers used to get the power from the utility generators to your home, 
is so big and unwieldy. Think of it this way: When you use electricity from 
the grid, the production chain begins in a coal mine, then the coal must be 
transported to a power plant, and then power is generated in huge, expensive 
machines. This electrical power gets transmitted over long lengths of wire 
until it finally reaches your home. Several companies are involved — a coal-
mining company, a transport company, and a utility company with linesmen, 
managers, secretaries, lobbyists, and lawyers — not to mention that a whole 
host of governmental regulations have to be met, and taxes and tariffs need 
to be paid.
Even though electricity is the most expensive energy source, it’s used almost 
exclusively in a majority of homes. Why? Because it’s the most convenient 
way to use power. It’s the most ordered; you can get it to do most anything. 
All you have to do is plug your toaster into a wall socket and voilà! You don’t 
need a storage tank (like you do with propane or fuel oil), and you don’t have 
to worry about the danger of explosions or flames (although you can get a 
shock without even trying too hard). You don’t need to go into the woods 
with a chainsaw and cut down a tree, and you don’t need to stack electricity 
on the side of your house and keep the spiders out of it. Best of all, the utility 
company is responsible for maintaining a continual flow into your home.
Looking at conversion costs
Most people are familiar with their gasoline bills and their utility bills, but 
raw energy is always consumed in a machine of some kind (unless you’re 
burning firewood in a hole in the ground for your heat source, and even then 
you need matches, or a flint stone).

53
 Chapter 3: Putting Together Each Piece of the Energy Puzzle
Raw energy costs, explained in the preceding section, are only part of the 
picture. Most energy sources need to be burned or combusted on-site in 
order to extract their potential energy. Some conversion methods are more 
efficient than others. The list in Table 3-3 shows the same fuels as those 
listed in Table 3-1, but this time with all the various production factors that 
come into play.

Gasoline is now the costliest energy source because it requires the most 
complex types of machinery to use. Wood is a cinch to burn; you don’t even 
really need a machine, but if you do use one, like a wood stove, the machin-
ery is simple and effective. If you cut your own wood, the cost is even lower 
(notwithstanding all the tools and food you need to accomplish the task).
Capital equipment costs
The $400 billion a year we spend on raw fuel doesn’t tell the whole story. We 
also spend over $500 billion per year on new capital equipment dedicated 
to refining, storing, and transporting fuels. Add the value of existing capital 
equipment, and the maintenance and financing costs associated with it, and 
total expenditures on capital equipment exceed $700 billion per year. And 
much of this capital equipment cost is dedicated to equipment that is used to 
extract and refine the raw fuels.
Grid power costs around 12 cents per kWh (kilowatt-hour), although this 
fluctuates quite a bit from region to region. The same amount of energy con-
tained in a chunk of raw coal costs only a third of a cent. Computer grade 
power, that is, power which is highly refined and consistent, costs over $3 
per kWh. Yet the consumption of this high grade electricity is the fastest 
growing sector of the US economy, and the majority of value added to each 

54
Part I: The Basic Facts of Energy Life 
successive increment of progressively more refined energy comes from the 
equipment used for the refinement. In short, that original lump of coal for a 
third of a cent gets turned into high-grade power for $3 per kWh.
Energy utilization
For every source of energy, the cost of the production plant is directly pro-
portional to the plant’s capacity (the larger the plant, the higher the capital 
costs), while the revenue is proportional to the energy generated. Plant utili-
zation factor is the ratio of energy produced to the total capacity of the plant 
if it were in full up operation 24/7. Table 3-4 lists some utilization factors for 
common fuel sources.

The small utilization factor for wind is due to the variability of wind. Solar 
suffers the same problem due to sunlight availability.
The net economic effect is to make investments in low utilization technologies 
riskier, with a more difficult payback. Nuclear utilization is so high because 
nuclear plants are used constantly. They cannot be turned on and off at will, 
and the capital equipment costs are so high that when a nuclear plant is 
commissioned, it’s used as much as possible.
Putting it together in practical terms
For an automobile, fuel costs represent less than 20 percent of the total cost 
of driving. The 5 percent gas guzzler tax that the government imposes hardly 
dissuades drivers from driving gas guzzlers because the raw fuel/capital 
equipment percentage is even less than 20 percent for expensive cars.
The difference between cost and fuel is even more stark in the remainder 
of the energy economy, which is much less dependent on fossil fuels. The 
non-transport sector already gets 90 percent of its energy from electricity, 

55
 Chapter 3: Putting Together Each Piece of the Energy Puzzle
and the price of electricity depends even less on the cost of raw fuel than 
transport.
Oil generates less than 5 percent of the domestic electricity production. The 
costs of coal and uranium don’t factor into the price of electricity either, 
because the greatest component of the electrical cost is in the massive 
power plants and distribution systems, as well as the labor costs in the huge 
utilities that administer the power to our homes. Raw fuel costs represent 
half the delivered cost of electricity from gas fired turbines, around one third 
of coal-fired power, and only 10 percent of nuclear power. Solar and hydro-
power have no raw fuel costs at all. Yet all these sources are not too far apart 
in terms of delivered cost.
In the past 50 years, hardware has grown more efficient, and so even as raw 
fuel costs fluctuate and increase, the real cost of electricity has steadily 
fallen. When electricity prices gyrate, it’s because of governmental interfer-
ence in markets, not because of fuel costs or hardware issues. In the long 
term, the real cost of energy has dropped steadily, and this is why Americans 
use more and more energy every year.

e are addicts. 
Our drug of choice? Fossil fuels. And it’s not just the U.S., but the entire world 
that shares this addiction. The vast majority of the energy infrastructure 
established over the last 100 years relies on fossil fuels, and so for now the 
world is driven by thermal combustion processes generated by fossil fuels, 
which are relatively cheap and abundant. While the situation isn’t likely to 
change any time soon, it will change eventually (just see the other chapters 
in this part).
This chapter takes you on a quick stroll through the energy sources cur-
rently available, explains consumption trends (you’ll see that fossil fuels are 
currently the fuel of choice for just about every economy), and examines the 
current availability and cost of fossil fuels. 
A Quick Look at Fuels from the 
Fossil Fuel Era and Beyond
Under huge pressures and amidst the Earth’s core heat, decayed and 
decaying organic materials formed complex compounds primarily composed 
of hydrogen and carbon atoms. These complex, carbon-based compounds 
are more commonly referred to as fossil fuels. The three most commonly 
available fossil fuels are coal, petroleum, and natural gas.

60
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
The following sections outline basic information about each type of energy — 
both fossil and nonfossil fuels — as well as an overview of the world’s use of 
these energies. You can find more detailed info about fossil fuel sources in 
Chapter 5 and the chapters in Parts III and IV are devoted to explaining 
alternative energy sources.
The evolution of energy use
Humans stumbled across the potential in fossil fuels when they discovered 
fire in prehistoric times, but the modern fossil fuel era didn’t get into full 
swing until the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s. It was then that coal sup-
planted wood because of its superior energy density (it packs more energy 
into a given volume and weight than wood does). Coal consumption peaked 
as the demand for oil and natural gas increased. Figure 4-1 shows how the 
world’s use of different fossil fuels evolved since 1800.

Nonfossil
Hydropower, represented by the “Nonfossil” line in Figure 4-1, came on 
the scene around 1920, and that explains the increase of nonfossil energy 
sources since then. The further increase in nonfossil fuels after around 1970 
is due to nuclear power plants and other alternatives.
Petroleum products
Most petroleum products, which include gasoline, propane, and heating oil, 
are derived from crude oil drilled from beneath the ground. The energy that 
derives from petroleum products comes from burning the fuels, or oxidizing 
the fuels to be more precise. Carbon dioxide, the molecule responsible for 
global warming, results from the burning of petroleum sources. Petroleum 
products account for 39 percent of all the energy used in North America. 

61
 Chapter 4: Developing a Snapshot of Fossil Fuel Use and Availability
In order to be converted into gasoline and other useful fuels, crude petro-
leum must be “cracked,” which is a process akin to a distillery where dif-
ferent boiling points of a complex liquid are reached and the constituent 
materials boil off separately. Petroleum refineries are huge chemical process-
ing plants where crude oil is cracked.
Following the cracking process, various fuels and other petroleum products 
are further separated. Gasoline is the most prevalent fuel produced from 
petroleum. The amount of gasoline derived from a barrel of oil is dependent 
on the quality of the oil, but roughly 25 gallons can be refined from a barrel 
(which is 42 gallons) of crude petroleum. 
 
Petroleum refining is the most energy intensive manufacturing industry, 
accounting for over 7 percent of all U.S. energy consumption. It takes a lot of 
energy just to supply energy.
Natural gas
Natural gas is drilled from beneath the surface of the earth, just like petro-
leum, but it comes in gaseous form instead of liquid or solid. Transport is 
problematic; so is storage. Most natural gas systems rely on a vast matrix of 
interconnected pipes and pressure regulators. Natural gas is more common 
in urban areas than in rural areas because of the need for this matrix of 
supply lines. 
Natural gas is generally favored by environmentalists because it burns 
cleaner than petroleum products and coal. Because availability of natural 
gas is good in the U.S. (proven domestic reserves are very large), natural gas 
consumption has increased as well. Most new power plants are being fired 
by natural gas, and many homes and businesses are converting their old coal 
and oil burning heating systems to natural gas. The U.S. extracts and markets 
around 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually. Natural gas makes up 
24 percent of total energy consumption, with very little of that going toward 
transport because of safety reasons. 
Coal
Coal is mined from the ground and comes in a solid, blackish, oily form 
that’s easy to burn but very difficult to burn cleanly. Coal is the most 
common form of energy in North America because there’s so much of it 
available domestically and it’s relatively easy to extract from the ground, 
compared to petroleum. 

62
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
 
While crude petroleum consumption has increased dramatically over the last 
20 years, coal consumption has increased even faster. Between 1980 and 2005, 
coal production in the U.S. increased by around 40 percent and the rate of 
increase remains consistent.
Most of the U.S. electrical power is derived from coal combustion, and this 
causes a lot of the impetus to go to alternative energy because coal is so 
dirty. There are methods being developed to make coal burn cleaner and 
release less pollution into the environment, but even when these advances 
are perfected, coal will still be a major culprit of greenhouse gases. There is 
simply no way to burn coal cleanly.
Because the U.S. has such a large domestic supply of coal, it is an attrac-
tive solution politically because supplies won’t be disrupted by instability 
in other countries, conflicts with other nations, or global environmental or 
political crises. Coal also provides a lot of domestic jobs.
Nuclear
The same atom-splitting physics that provides us with those wonderful 
nuclear weapons is used to heat water, which is then used to turn large elec-
trical generating turbines. Much of the controversy about nuclear energy 
relates to nuclear waste products, which are very difficult to deal with. Plus 
the word “nuclear” is associated with atomic weapons, which nobody likes. 
Nevertheless, nuclear power is coming back into favor because it doesn’t 
generate the carbon dioxide pollution blamed for global warming and other 
problems. Plus the known reserves of uranium (used in the nuclear reaction) 
are huge compared to fossil fuel sources. 
In some countries, like France, nuclear power provides a majority of the 
electrical power. Yet it comprises only 11 percent of North American energy 
consumption. Look for this percentage to increase dramatically in the next 
couple decades. However, this will take some time because nuclear power 
plants are so expensive and difficult to build with all the safety features 
required. Nuclear plants also require years of approvals and planning, 
although there is political pressure now to relieve this burden.
Hydropower (dams)
Tremendous water pressure builds up at the bottom of large dams located 
on river ways, and this pressure is harnessed to turn turbines that generate 
electricity. Hydropower is very clean, but the problem is that dams affect the 
river’s ecosystem. Salmon runs are obliterated and the natural beauty of the 
river is permanently altered, almost always for the worst (unless you like to 
water-ski). 

63
 Chapter 4: Developing a Snapshot of Fossil Fuel Use and Availability
Hydropower accounts for 3 percent of North American energy consumption, 
particularly in the American Pacific Northwest. It accounts for around 8 per-
cent of electrical energy production, and that’s significant because most of 
our electrical energy comes from burning coal, which is very bad for the envi-
ronment (see the section, “Coal,” earlier in this chapter).
Biomass (firewood and 
other natural sources)
Leaves falling from the trees in autumn are biomass, so are cow manure, 
horse manure, hay, weeds, corn husks, and so on. Firewood is the most 
common form of biomass used for energy. Total biomass energy production 
accounts for only 3 percent of North American energy usage (most of it for 
heating homes). Because of its wide availability, biomass is seen as an excel-
lent sustainable energy source. 
 
When biomass is left to rot on the ground, it releases just as much carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere as when it’s burned. So biomass is a very attrac-
tive alternative-energy source because burning it doesn’t release any more 
carbon dioxide than is released naturally through the process of decay.
Geothermal
The air you breathe and the ground beneath your feet provide the source 
for geothermal energy. Although the physics is complicated, you can 
accomplish heating and cooling by using heat exchange mechanisms that 
move temperature differences from one place to another. If you want heat in 
your home, you take some from the air or the ground and channel it into your 
home. If you want to move heat out of your home, you channel it back into 
the environment. 
Geothermal energy provides 0.3 percent of North American energy needs.
Wind
Everybody has seen windmills. Traditionally they have been used to pump 
water from the ground (you see them in old western movies at nearly every 
ranch). But modern windmills produce electrical power as well. Wind power 
only provides 0.11 percent of energy needs, but this is changing fast because 
wind is a very clean energy source, and improvements in the technologies 
have been impressive. The problems with windmills include: 

64
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
 
✓ They’re unsightly.
 
✓ They make noise.
 
✓ They may kill wildlife, particularly birds.
 
Wind power is a form of solar power because wind is caused by thermal 
temperature differences between regions of the globe.
Solar
The sun radiates a tremendous amount of energy — 35,000 times as much 
energy as humans use — onto the surface of the earth, pollution free. 
Unfortunately, tapping into this energy isn’t simple. Nevertheless, people 
have figured out ways to use solar energy to heat water and to produce 
electricity. There is a tremendous push to increase solar production, and 
many governments are subsidizing solar equipment in both residential and 
commercial settings. Right now solar power accounts for only 0.06 percent of 
energy production (if you don’t include all the natural light and heat the sun 
produces), but that’s changing fast.
Electricity
Of all the energy sources in use, electrical energy has grown the most and 
has also grown into the most important energy source. Electrical energy is 
generated through processes powered by other energy sources. For instance, 
coal is burned and water is boiled and the pressure is used to turn huge 
turbines that generate electrical power. In North America, electrical energy 
comes primarily from these sources: coal, nuclear, and gas. In the following 
sections, I list some of the disadvantages and environmental impacts that 
generating electricity causes whether it’s generated through alternative 
sources or not.
 
One of the key reasons that electrical energy consumption has grown so much 
is the increased use of computers. As the complexity of computers increases, 
so do the power requirements, and in particular, highly ordered power. Fast 
computers with hordes of memory require a lot of power supply filtering, 
which entails waste and inefficiency.
The dirty truth about electricity
Although electricity is typically considered clean and environmentally 
friendly, it’s often generated through processes that rely on “dirty” energy 
sources. Even those processes that use renewable energy sources have 
their own problems. When considering how “clean” electrical energy is, you 
need to take into account the source of the electric power, as well as the 
inefficiencies inherent in those particular systems. 

65
 Chapter 4: Developing a Snapshot of Fossil Fuel Use and Availability
 
While clean once it reaches your home, electrical energy has most likely been 
generated by a combustion process, so it is not necessarily environmentally 
benign. Consider, for example, that about 90 percent of the coal produced in 
this country is used to produce over 50 percent of our electricity. Due to its 
high carbon and sulfur content, burning coal is extremely dirty, and coal 
byproducts are the leading contributor to global warming (nearly 1 billion 
tons of carbon dioxide are produced each year in the United States alone; 
China has surpassed this). Mercury is another byproduct of burning coal; it 
pollutes air, land, and water. Electrical power generated by coal-burning pro-
cesses, therefore, is a very polluting source of energy. 
Disadvantages with electricity generated by alternative means
Don’t think, though, that electrical energy generated by alternativeenergy 
sources is problem free because it’s not: 
 
✓ Wind generators cover open hillsides with noisy, ugly windmills. Birds 
and bats get killed, sometimes in large numbers. On the other hand, 
windmills are pristine compared to the alternatives, so criticisms should 
be taken within context.
 
✓ Hydroelectric generators dam up rivers and affect such diverse 
phenomena as salmon runs and the plants and animals that live along 
the riverside. Dams also create a lot of underwater decay in the upper 
reservoirs that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
 
✓ Geothermal wells release arsenic into the environment.
 
✓ Nuclear power plants produce horrendous wastes, and people have yet 
to figure out a good way to get rid of these byproducts.
 
✓ Power lines emit radiation, heat the air, buzz, and catch birds and 
planes. Their potential for danger is even greater when they’re downed.
Energy Consumption Trends 
By checking out how countries around the globe are using energy and in 
what form, you get a clear picture of what fuel sources the globe is relying 
upon. To paint such a picture I provide you with, in the following sections, an 
overview of how the globe uses energy and in what forms, comparing coun-
tries’ usage as well as noting how increased industrialization drives energy 
consumption.
Global energy consumption and use
In 2002, the world used 409 Quads of energy. Where did all that energy come 
from? Table 4-1 lists the power sources and percentage of the total usage 
each represents, both globally and in the United States.

As Table 4-1 shows, the combustion of hydrocarbons (fossil fuels, like petro-
leum, natural gas, and coal) comprised 86 percent of the world’s energy con-
sumption — a number that has grown in the last decades; as China and India 
come on line, it will continue to grow — and 80 percent of the U.S. consump-
tion. Hydroelectric, nuclear, and renewable fuels account for the alternative 
contributions, and amount to only around 14 percent of the world’s energy 
sources — the U.S. does slightly better with alternatives, coming in at about 
18 percent. Note: This percentage does not include alternative sources like 
solar room heating (that is, using direct sunlight for warmth) and bicycle 
riding, however.
And where did all this energy go? Table 4-2 gives a sampling of countries. 
From this table you can see that the U.S., despite the fact that it represents 
only 4 percent of the world’s population, consumes about 24 percent of 
world energy consumption and uses about 25 percent of the world’s oil.

 Chapter 4: Developing a Snapshot of Fossil Fuel Use and Availability
Some interesting things to note about the data in Table 4-2: Canadians use 
more energy per capita than do Americans. True, Canada is cold, and its 
citizens require a lot of heat. But their high consumption also reflects the 
fact that energy is relatively inexpensive in Canada. When energy is cheap, 
there’s little incentive to conserve or practice efficiency and conservation.
What’s more interesting is to compare per capita consumption in the 
U.S. (339) with per capita consumption in Western Europe (149). Western 
Europeans, in many ways, enjoy better lifestyles than Americans. So why is 
their per capita consumption so low? Because they’ve been inculcated by 
high energy prices for so long that energy conservation and efficiency are 
ingrained into the very fabric of their societies. Western Europe provides 
Americans with a paradigm; this is where we are heading, and it’s not bad at 
all. In fact, there may be some interesting but subtle increases in our quality 
of life when we end up using less energy. 
Energy consumption in growing economies
There is direct correlation between the per capita usage of energy in a nation 
and its corresponding GNP (Gross National Product). As less developed 
countries, interested in catching up economically with the world leaders, 
industrialize, their energy consumption increases. As the Chinese and Indian 
economies, for example, require more energy to power their development, 
global energy usage will increase. Today this growing demand is being met 
primarily through fossil fuels.
Efficiency may alter this trend toward more energy usage, but until efficient 
solutions are economically feasible, many developing countries will continue 
to rely on relatively cheap fossil fuels for power, despite the environmental 
costs. 
 
The United States is achieving higher levels of GNP with less energy, but not 
because of efficiency and conservation. Most of our heavy industries (like 
steel and manufacturing), which use a lot of coal-fired power, are moving 
overseas.
The U.S. is more efficient at converting its energy use into Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) — this is a metric known as energy intensity and is important 
in discussing economic issues related to energy. In 1950, the U.S. consumed 
20,000 Btus for each dollar of GDP, but in 2000, that figure was roughly half, 
which implies that the U.S. is getting much more efficient in at least one 
way: The U.S. may be an energy pig, but it also provides a lot of value for the 
energy it consumes, providing the world valuable economic output at a rela-
tively small energy cost. 

68
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Energy consumption in the U.S.
The United States is the world’s largest consumer of energy, and the disparity 
in energy use per capita is growing. In 1950 the U.S. was energy independent, 
consuming only 35 Quads of energy. Fifty years later, the U.S. population had 
increased 189 percent while energy consumption grew 280 percent. While 
U.S. energy consumption overall has grown, the energy sources the U.S. 
relies on have changed, as Table 4-3 shows.

As Table 4-3 shows, electrical production, regardless of the fuel type, 
increased sharply between 1925 and 2000. 
Table 4-4 shows the four major sectors of the U.S. economy that use energy 
and the amount of oil consumption that each sector uses. Note that transport 
uses a majority of oil while representing only around a quarter of the total 
energy consumption.

more energy than the rest of the world, but this projection shows how the

Looking at Current Availability and Cost
Of course, availability and cost of fossil fuels can become a huge issue for 
a country, depending on what a country has in its own reserves. Increased 
consumption of fossil fuels that a country doesn’t have sufficient reserves 
of leads to increased imports, making that country dependent on foreign 
nations. The next sections give you an overview of the world’s energy 
reserves as well as how the availability and cost of fossil fuels can make a 
global impact.
Global availability of fossil fuels
The known fossil fuel reserves worldwide are increasing each year due to 
advancing exploration technologies. Table 4-6 lists the reserves of various 
sources (in units of energy so as to show the relative amounts).

*There are also around 3,000 EJ of dry natural gas that is currently too far from pipe lines to be eco-
nomically transported
The total coal reserves are about equal to all the reserves for petroleum 
products put together. This is either a blessing (more coal, more coal pro-
duction) or a curse (more coal, more pollution) for the U.S., which has tre-
mendous coal reserves, depending on how you look at it. While domestic 
coal relieves us of the need for foreign supplies, it’s a very dirty energy 
source. The fact is, American electrical power will continue to rely on coal 
solely because it’s so readily available.
The U.S. and fossil fuels
In the United States, domestic supplies of fossil fuels are dwindling and 
demand cannot be met at the rate of consumption growth that it’s experienc-
ing. Even if new reserves exceed expectations and next-generation oil and gas 
recovery technologies significantly improve, supply and demand are going to 
be imbalanced.
Coal is the only energy source that the U.S. doesn’t import. In terms of dol-
lars, energy imports accounted for around 24 percent of the U.S.’s $483 bil-
lion trade deficit in 2002, and here’s how it all broke down:
 
✓ 60 percent fossil fuels
 
✓ 16 percent natural gas
 
✓ 81 percent of the uranium used in nuclear reactors
 
✓ 33 percent total net fuel import
The U.S. imports more oil from Canada than any other foreign country, which 
comes as a big surprise to most people. Next in line is Saudi Arabia, then 
Venezuela, then Mexico. Each country provides around 1.5 million barrels to 
U.S. markets every day. The entire Persian Gulf region supplies the U.S. with 
around 22 percent of its oil imports, or around 12 percent of total U.S. energy 
consumption. This accounts for a daily cash export of around $1.1 billion.

71
 Chapter 4: Developing a Snapshot of Fossil Fuel Use and Availability
This trend is not likely to change, as the biggest reserves are being discov-
ered outside of the United States. The Alaska Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 
(ANWR) has considerable oil reserves, but it is estimated that at the peak of 
drilling it will only be able to produce less than 1 million barrels per day. The 
total reserves are estimated at 10.3 billion barrels. By contrast, the Persian 
Gulf has around 672 billion barrels of proven oil reserves. All told, ANWR may 
be able to provide the U.S. with less than two years of oil at current consump-
tion rates.
The real cost of fuel
It’s interesting to look at the real cost of energy worldwide (the real cost is 
the cost, adjusted for inflation). Fuel prices have risen and fallen but the real 
cost of energy has consistently decreased due to improvements in equipment 
and technology for both the production and consumption of energy sources. 
If anything can explain the robust increase in energy consumption, falling 
prices are at the center of the argument. Extraction equipment becomes 
more complex, but results in cheaper prices. Fuel quality is growing con-
stantly and the prices are still coming down, in real terms.
This is going to change, one way or another.

Chapter 5
Burning Up with Conventional 
Energy Sources
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding combustion processes 
▶ Sorting through common combustion sources
▶ Understanding how raw fuel gets converted into useable power
T
he vast majority of the world’s energy economy comes from fossil fuels 
of one kind or another. The term “alternative” in fact refers to alterna-
tives to the fossil fuel standard. In order to understand alternative energy 
technologies and how they fit into the current energy situation, you need to 
have a general understanding of fossil fuel combustion and the machines that 
are used to produce ordered power from the raw fossil fuels.
If you’re only interested in the alternative energy technologies, you can skip 
this chapter. But if you’re interested in understanding how alternatives fit in, 
and when and where they are candidates, this chapter is a must.
There are a wide range of conventional energy machines and processes. I 
start with the basics of combusting fossil fuels and then I describe the most 
common thermal machines for translating combustion into useable power, or 
energy.
Combustion Processes
Every fossil fuel must be burned, or combusted, in order to extract energy. 
The only kind of energy that is available through combustion is heat energy. 
In some cases, the heat itself is the desired result. Just pile some wood on the 
ground and set it on fire and — voilà! — you have warmth, heat energy at its 
most basic. Of course, the key is ordered, or controlled, energy, and for that 
you need machinery that can manipulate the heat. In home heating systems, 
the machinery is very simple; it merely channels the heat into the room, or 
area, where it is used. The simplest home heating “machine” is a fireplace. 

74
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
In most combustion processes, however, the end goal isn’t heat, but electri-
cal energy or energy that can be used for transportation. To produce electri-
cal energy, the heat from combustion is used to spin a turbine that creates 
electricity via generators. To produce energy for transport, the heat from 
combustion is translated into mechanical energy, or torque and power on 
a shaft which is connected to a vehicle’s wheels through a transmission 
(gears).
 
Briefly, a turbine is simply a fan; when air pressure or steam pressure is set 
against the turbine (fan) blades it causes the shaft to spin. A generator is like 
an electric motor, except operating in reverse. When a generator’s shaft is 
forced to turn, two output wires provide electrical power (as opposed to the 
operation of a fan, where electrical power is supplied to two wires and the fan 
blade spins).
What I refer to as combustion is actually oxidation, a reaction between the 
fuel being combusted and the oxygen in the air. Without oxygen, there is no 
combustion. 
Hydrogen and carbon content 
in fossil fuels
All fossil fuels are composed of hydrogen and carbon (among other things 
that don’t factor into the combustion/energy production phase), hence the 
term hydrocarbons to refer to these energy sources. The vast proportion of 
the useable energy comes from hydrogen, whereas the carbon generates the 
vast majority of the waste. 
When carbon burns completely in an oxygen atmosphere (such as the 
earth’s), the product is a lot of carbon dioxide (CO2), the gas blamed for 
global warming. Other byproducts of fossil fuel combustion are carbon 
monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and various 
particulates like mercury that cause undue environmental harm.
Gasoline, heating oil, and propane are over 80 percent carbon by weight. 
Natural gas only contains 75 percent carbon, and this is one of the reasons 
it’s favored by environmentalists. It also burns cleaner and more efficiently, 
with less extraneous byproducts. In general, the less carbon a molecule 
contains (in relation to the amount of hydrogen), the cleaner the burning 
process.

75
 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
Because energy is derived from the hydrogen content of a particular fossil 
fuel and waste is related to the carbon content, it’s of interest to look at the 
different fossil fuels and their relative proportions of hydrogen and carbon. 
Fuels with a high carbon-hydrogen rate are limited in how low a pollution 
may be obtained via combustion. Table 5-1 lists the percentages of carbon 
and hydrogen in common fuels. Note that, although wood is not a fossil fuel, 
I include it in this chart because its energy is also derived from combustion 
processes.

As Table 5-1 shows, hydrogen gas has no carbon. This is why there’s so much 
interest in developing hydrogen fuels, which exhaust only water when com-
busted. This is clearly the wave of the future, and I get into more details in 
Chapter 15.
Wood, as Table 5-1 shows, has more carbon than any of the other sources 
listed, and it produces a lot of carbon dioxide when it burns. Here’s the inter-
esting thing, though: Wood left on the forest floor to rot releases just as much 
CO2 into the atmosphere due to natural decomposition as gets released if the 
wood were burned. That’s why wood, despite its high carbon content, is rela-
tively benign to the environment because at some point the carbon dioxide 
is going to be released, burn or rot. Add the fact that wood is renewable, sus-
tainable, and local in production, and the above chart slanders wood more 
than is merited. (Head to Chapter 14 for more on wood as an alternative 
energy source.) Coal, on the other hand, does not decompose in the ground 
and so coal left alone does not naturally increase global warming. 

76
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Efficiency limitations of fossil fuels
The driving force of any heat engine (machine used to derive useable power 
from the heat of combustion) is a temperature differential. According to 
Carnot’s law (refer to Chapter 3), the efficiency of any combustion process is 
proportional to the difference in temperature between the heat source (the 
combustion chamber) and the heat sink (the exhaust environment). In other 
words, you want to burn the fuel at as high a temperature as possible in 
order to achieve the most efficiency. 
You can also increase efficiency by lowering the temperature of the exhaust 
environment as much as possible as well, but in most cases this is not a 
practical variable. The exhaust ambient is what it is, unless huge amounts 
of energy are expended in lowering the temperature, and that defeats the 
purpose. 
Common Combustion Sources
Currently, fossil fuels are the most common source of heat energy. It’s a 
biggie in the U.S., as Chapter 4 explains, and in developing countries, over 90 
percent of all heat energy is derived from fossil fuel combustion. The follow-
ing sections provide an in-depth analysis of the most commonly used fossil 
fuel combustion sources.
 
The heat source for any type of heat engine doesn’t have to be fossil fuels. 
Solar radiation, geothermal steam, geothermal water, and nuclear energy are 
all possible energy sources. Head to the chapters in Part III for more on these 
alternatives to fossil fuels.
Coal
Coal is a combustible brown or black solid material formed from plant 
remains compacted under high pressure over the course of millions of years. 
Coal, a mineral consisting of a majority of elemental carbon, can be found 
on every continent in the earth. The United States (23 percent of known 
reserves), Russia and its satellite states (23 percent), and China (11 percent) 
have significant known coal deposits.

77
 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
Coal use and consumption
Coal is used predominantly in the generation of electricity. Around 90 per-
cent of the coal used in North America goes toward producing electricity. A 
ton of coal contains around 21 million Btus, or the equivalent of around 150 
gallons of gasoline. Coal is also used for coking (very high temperature heat 
treating and melting) in the iron and steel industries. In these latter applica-
tions, the pollution exhausts can be very high, and the people who work in 
the plants are prone to a lot of health problems.
In 2000, North America consumed over one billion tons of coal, or about a 
quarter of the entire demand. Yet at present, China is the world’s largest 
producer and consumer of coal, and this is why China has bypassed the 
United States in total greenhouse gas emissions. In China, coal is cheap and 
abundant, and the Chinese government is focused on raising the quality of 
life for its citizens despite the environmental impact of being so reliant on 
coal as an energy source. Coal consumption in China is going to increase 
dramatically over the next decades. This is a sobering thought, as it implies 
that however hard the United States might try to curtail its own greenhouse 
gas emissions, China will likely more than exceed our reductions with their 
major increases. It’s an interesting political question, then, whether the 
United States should spend a lot of money attempting to curtail greenhouse 
gases while China’s economy grows and prospers on the shoulders of 
inexpensive, dirty coal energy. Is this fair? Critics respond that we’ve been 
overusing resources for so long that it’s time we pay the piper, but this 
argument is a tough sell politically.
Coal quality
Coal comes in a wide range of qualities and specific heat values (the amount 
of heat that a given weight of coal can output, when combusted). The price 
of coal closely tracks the quality. Classifications of coal are (from soft to 
hard) lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous, and anthracite. These ranks are 
predicated on carbon content, extraneous matter, heating value, and caking 
or agglomerating, properties. 
The harder coals are more costly than the softer because harder coals have 
more energy per weight, and the market bears a higher price. However, softer 
coals are easier to mine, so there is a cost tradeoff. As far as which industries 
use which types of coals, the combustion machines are set up to optimize a 
certain type of coal, so it’s the machines, not the end uses, that determine 
which type a given industry uses. Table 5-2 lists the types of coal and the 
heat values.

Anthracite (hard coal)

A pound of anthracite is worth around two pounds of lignite, in terms of 
energy content.
Peat, found on the surface of the earth, is soft material found in some regions. 
Basically it’s coal in the first stages of evolution, and has relatively low 
energy density. But since it’s very easy to recover it’s used widely in some 
parts of the world for fuel. 
Coal combustion
Coal is very high in carbon content, and is very dirty when combusted, as 
a result. Coal combustion not only exhausts over two billion tons a year of 
carbon dioxide, but is also responsible for acid rain-forming nitrogen and 
sulfur compounds. Mercury is also becoming more problematic, with over 
200,000 pounds per year going into the atmosphere. To put mercury into 
perspective, it takes only 
1⁄70th of a teaspoon to contaminate a 25-acre lake to 
the point where fish die.
The main problem with coal is that the U.S. has such a tremendous domestic 
supply, and so the politics and economics of burning coal are politically 
and economically attractive. Plus we have a sizable domestic reserve, so 
the investment of capital equipment is low risk, in relation to investing in oil 
burning equipment.
Crude oil
Crude is pumped from the ground as a semi-liquid called petroleum. It’s a 
mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons, mainly alkanes of complex combinations 
of hydrogen and carbon atoms. Oil, like coal, has different grades:
 
✓ Sweet crude: Oil that’s low in sulfur is called “sweet” crude.
 
✓ Sour crude: Oil that’s high in sulfur. 
Lower sulfur oil pollutes less than the higher sulfur variety, and costs more in 
crude form.

 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
Crude consumption
U.S. consumption of crude oil has risen steadily since 1950, and we currently 
consume around 20 million barrels a day. Worldwide, oil consumption has 
increased faster than in the U.S. as new markets are opening up at the same 
time that the U.S. is moving toward more efficiency.
Crude oil products
Various hydrocarbons are classified according to their chain lengths, or the 
complexity of their molecular structures. The components with longer chain 
lengths tend to boil at lower temperatures, and so in the refinement process 
may be individually distilled from the raw crude, resulting in a number of dif-
ferent petroleum products used for various machinery applications.
Crude oil products are classified according to their carbon chain lengths 
(indicated by the subscript numbers). The products with longer chain 
lengths generally have lower boiling points, which makes them easier to 
separate during the refinement phase. Table 5-3 lists the different crude oil 
products, according to their carbon chain lengths, and tells what common 
products you’ll find them in.

Note that as the carbon chains increase in complexity, the materials get 
thicker, or more viscous. The combustion properties also change, in par-
ticular the temperature and pressure under which the product burns most 
efficiently.
In later sections I describe more properties of crude oil products, from the 
context of the machines that are used to burn them.

Natural gas
Natural gas is a gaseous mixture of hydrocarbon compounds, mostly meth-
ane, which is usually found near oil deposits, but sometimes completely 
independent of crude oil deposits. Methane can also be harvested at rotting 
landfills and from animal wastes via a process known as anaerobic digestion.
Natural gas is cleaner in the combustion process than heating oil and gaso-
line, and is used commonly for home heating and cooking applications (as 
well as hot water heating). 
The distribution network for natural gas is cumbersome compared to liquid 
fuels which can be easily transported via truck and pipelines. So natural gas 
is most common in urban areas that have the infrastructure in place to pro-
vide the gas to a broad range of customers through underground pipelines.
Natural gas consumption 
There are over 400,000 natural gas wells in the world, with over 1.1 million 
miles of pipelines that supply power plants, industry, and homes. In some 
European countries, natural gas consumption exceeds that of any other 
energy source.
The U.S. has around 177 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves 
(only about 3 percent of the world’s total reserves). Natural gas provides 
around a quarter of all U.S. energy consumption. Only 15 percent is imported, 
mostly from Canada.
Uses for natural gas 
Natural gas is used primarily as a source for residential and commercial 
heating, as well as large scale power plant electrical production. It can also 
be used to power vehicles, but this is a minor role because it takes a lot of 
energy to compress natural gas down to a liquid form, and so the economics 
are prohibitive. Natural gas also requires special handling equipment and is 
relatively dangerous. The potential for disastrous explosions is real, and this 
creates political as well as health problems.
Because natural gas is cleaner than the other hydrocarbon alternatives, most 
new power plants being built in the U.S. use this fuel. However, clean is a rela-
tive term and in the grand scheme of things natural gas is still a high emitter 
of carbon dioxide. It’s a matter of the least evil, with natural gas.

81
 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
Natural gas combustion
In combustion, methane (CH4) combines with oxygen to form water and heat 
and carbon dioxide. Natural gas affords an energy content of around 1,000 
Btus per cubic foot, but this depends a great deal on the level of purity. When 
the gas is impure not only does it burn less efficiently but it emits more pol-
lutants. Impurities also cause equipment maintenance problems, like gummy 
deposit buildups.
Most natural gas is methane, or CH4. It’s generally found in sedimentary 
rocks, usually in the presence of crude oil. When it’s found with crude, it’s 
called “wet” gas, and when it’s unassociated with crude, it’s called “dry” gas. 
Wet gases contain a lot more impurities than dry, and must be refined and 
processed prior to use.
Natural gas also contains a certain amount of sulfur, which is a very polluting 
ingredient. The best quality gases, straight from the ground, are low-sulfur, 
dry gases.
Liquid petroleum gas (LPG)
LPG is similar to natural gas, but it is liquefied, making distribution and use 
much easier and less expensive. LPG consists of a group of hydrogen rich 
gases — propane, butane, ethane, ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene, 
and isobutane. It’s derived from a refining process from either crude oil or 
natural gas. The most commonly available form of LPG is propane.
LPG has an energy density of around 92,000 Btus per gallon, or 2,500 Btus per 
cubic foot in the gaseous phase. It’s used extensively in rural areas where no 
natural gas pipeline infrastructure exists. Those big, ugly egg shaped tanks 
located in people’s yards contain LPG products of one kind or another.
Over 6.5 billion gallons of LPG were consumed in 2000 in the U.S.: 70 percent 
went for space heating, 22 percent for heating water, and the remaining 
percentage went to cooking and appliances.
Historically, the price of LPG has varied quite a bit. It’s not uncommon for 
prices to fluctuate over 20 percent from one season to the next, and this 
creates hardships for homeowners on fixed budgets because they simply 
don’t know what to expect from year to year.

82
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Home heating oil
Home heating oils include fuel oil, kerosene, and occasionally diesel motor 
fuel. Most equipment can burn any of these three types with equal efficiency, 
and so versatility is one key advantage.
About 6.1 billion gallons of fuel oil and kerosene were used in the U.S. in 2000, 
84 percent for space heating and the rest for water heating. Over 80 percent 
of this quantity was used in the Northeastern U.S. and the Mid Atlantic States.
In extremely cold weather, home heating oils tend to gel up, which causes 
problems with the combusting equipment. Many tanks are located in base-
ments where the temperatures are isolated from the harsh outdoor weather. 
Adding kerosene helps with this problem, and is a common solution in 
northern climates. However, kerosene is lighter in weight and has less energy 
content than the other forms of heating oil, so this solution is economically 
inefficient (because a tank must be filled up more often), although it may be 
necessary.
Fuel oils have an energy content of around 135,000 to 140,000 Btus per gallon 
and are generally considered very energy intensive. For a storage tank of 
a given size, more energy is available with fuel oils than any other type of 
liquid fossil fuel. This is advantageous when size is an issue.
Wood
Wood is a nonfossil, renewable combustion fuel. While wood fires are histori-
cally very smoky, and release a lot of particulates into the atmosphere, new 
burning equipment is much better at converting the potential energy into 
useable energy. When burned the right way, wood is much better for the 
environment than fossil fuel. 
Modern wood-burn chambers are air tight, and carefully control the amount 
of oxygen used in the combustion process. Temperature can also be carefully 
controlled so that the absolute maximum of energy is derived from the burn 
process. In addition, by carefully controlling the parameters, pollution levels 
can be minimized. Unfortunately, most wood burning is not done optimally 
simply because the type of people who use wood stoves don’t know any 
better.
Wood creates more ash and mess than other forms of combustion fuels. 
This may or may not be a problem, but wood-burning homes are generally 
dustier and dirtier than homes that use petroleum fuels. Wood also causes 
soot grunge in the air, and creosote buildup in the vent and chimney system. 

83
 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
Wood stoves need constant upkeep, and there’s a lot of work in hauling and 
stacking wood. Plus wood attracts spiders and rodents, which may or may 
not be a problem depending on the squeamishness of the stove operator.
A cord of wood (4 feet × 4 feet × 8 feet, by definition) weighs about 2 tons and 
releases around 20 million Btus when burned. This is equivalent to around 
145 gallons of gasoline, or a ton of coal.
 
Scientists have determined that every gallon of gasoline that is combusted 
was produced by 98 tons of ancient decayed biomass. That’s an incredible 
ratio, and attests to Mother Nature’s patience and mankind’s greed.
Processing Raw Fuel into Useable Power
From transport to heating to generating electricity, fossil fuels play a major 
role in our economy. For raw energy to be used for each of these purposes, 
however, requires that the energy be converted into a useable form — a feat 
that’s accomplished through machinery. The type of machinery used is spe-
cific to either the purpose (transport versus heating, for example) or to the 
type of fuel: a natural gas furnace, for example, uses different mechanisms 
than does a furnace powered by heating oil.
The following sections look at a variety of different types of machines that 
are used to produce useable energy from thermal combustion processes. 
Converting energy for heating
The most common types of centralized combustion heating systems transfer 
thermal energy by means of circulating hot air, steam, or water. The most 
commonly used fuels are oils and gases (including propane).
Heating oil furnaces
High efficiency units have been developed that can use any number of differ-
ent types of fuels to equal advantage. Heating oil is the most commonly used 
form of liquid petroleum for home and business heating.
In the furnace, or combustion chamber, of a heating oil unit, the fuel is atom-
ized (similar to the way that gasoline is mixed with air in the carburetor of 
an auto engine). The fuel-air mixture is ignited by either an electrical spark 
discharge device, or a pilot light which is on all the time.

84
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
The particular advantages of oil-heating machinery are:
 
✓ There are no pipeline requirements to a central supplier. The liquid fuel 
is contained on site, in a suitable tank. This is common for homes and 
buildings located in rural areas.
 
✓ Oil is a relatively safe fuel. A leak might produce a mess, but the 
probability of an explosion, or inadvertent ignition, is low, especially 
compared to natural gas and propane. Consequently, transporting 
heating oil is less expensive because the fail-safe devices are less 
onerous.
 
✓ When a system malfunctions, smoke is heavy and very discernible, 
making the system even safer because you can easily see when there’s a 
problem.
 
✓ Oil is a high energy density fuel, which means that the tanks can be 
smaller for the same amount of potential energy and it’s easier to 
transport than other fossil fuels, and cheaper to boot.
 
✓ Small systems for camping and remote applications are practical 
because of the high energy density and safety factor. Most camping 
stoves and portable heaters use some form of heating oil.
 
✓ Heating oil can easily be mixed with biofuels such as surplus vegetable 
oil and cooking grease in order to adjust the burn cycle to make mixtures 
energy efficient.
The disadvantages of oil heating are:
 
✓ When the tank goes empty, there’s no heat. However, most suppliers 
of heating oil will periodically check the tank for the consumer, and 
running out of heating oil is then rare.
 
✓ The price of heating oil is directly related to the price of crude oil, 
which means economic shocks can be burdensome. Shocks in the 
market supply can be predicated on such things as hurricanes, political 
turmoil, etc.
 
✓ Many heating systems require electricity, which means that when the 
grid’s down, the system won’t work. Some units include backup batteries 
to overcome this problem.
Methane (natural gas) heating
Natural gas is the most popular energy source for heating in the United 
States. Supplies are good, and the supply is domestic so interruptions are 
rare. In urban areas, where pipelines feed the gas directly into homes and 
businesses, natural gas is especially popular.

85
 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
A typical heating system includes a thermostat for controlling temperature. 
A combustion air blower combines oxygen with the natural gas and a spark 
plug or pilot light ignites the mixture. Efficiency depends on fine-tuning the 
combustion process, and many natural gas heating machines are poorly 
tuned and in need of maintenance because there’s no way of telling how 
inefficient a machine is running, aside from unduly high utility bills. A number 
of safety devices are included to ensure that the explosive gas-oxygen mixture 
is igniting as it should.
The pros of heating with natural gas are:
 
✓ These systems are very efficient in terms of the useable heat energy 
they provide for the amount of raw energy they consume.
 
✓ Natural gas is low in pollution compared to other fossil fuels.
 
✓ Exhaust gases are easily vented to the outside world, eliminating the 
need for a chimney and the associated costs. When a high-efficiency 
natural gas heating system replaces a conventional oil burning heater in 
a home or business, the need for extensive venting disappears.
 
✓ Natural gas is readily available in most cities and urban areas.
 
✓ Natural gas heaters produce very little smoke and soot, as long as 
they’re tuned properly. There’s less stink, as well.
The cons of natural gas heaters are:
 
✓ Methane leaks are dangerous and may cause explosions, so the systems 
are inherently less safe than oil burning systems. Most of the time, 
natural gas, an inherently odorless substance, is given an artificial scent 
so that leaks can be quickly detected. The scent is similar to rotten 
eggs, so it’s distinctive and difficult to ignore. There are, however, some 
people who can’t smell this additive.
 
✓ Price volatility is perhaps the worst of all fuel sources. It’s not uncommon 
for natural gas prices to fluctuate over 20 percent from year to year.
 
✓ In rural areas, pipelines are not available, and natural gas is not easy to 
store on site. Tanks are expensive, and suppliers may be difficult to find.
 
✓ Most systems require electricity to operate. When the grid goes down, 
there’s no heat.
Propane heating
Propane is a byproduct in the process of extracting methane from natural 
gas, or as a byproduct of refining crude oil. Most of the time propane is 
stored, under pressure, in liquid form. The tanks of gas used by campers and 
barbecues contain propane. When the liquid is released from the pressurized 
tanks, a combustible gas results. Propane is odorless, and like natural gas a 
smelly compound is added so that leaks may be readily detected.

86
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Advantages of propane heating are:
 
✓ It can be used nearly anywhere, since transport is so easy and efficient. 
Hardware stores and gas stations often sell propane, which is trans-
ferred from a big on-site storage tank, into the small 5 or 10 gallon tanks 
made just for the purpose.
 
✓ Propane supplies for home heating are readily available from utility 
companies that come out to pump it into on-site storage tanks. Most 
rural areas have a number of suppliers that do nothing but provide 
propane for their customers. In the summer, when people don’t need 
fuel for heating, these businesses often do nothing at all.
 
✓ Propane is not water soluble, so there is little risk of ground contamination 
if it leaks from the tank. Propane heating systems are also less polluting 
than wood and coal-burning systems.
 
✓ Off-grid homes generally use propane as a primary energy source. You 
can use propane to power a refrigerator, stove, water heater, and central 
heater. You can also buy backup generators that use propane, in order 
to generate electricity.
The disadvantages of propane include:
 
✓ The price per unit output of energy is generally higher than for most 
other forms of energy. Convenience is the big factor with propane, not 
cost.
 
✓ Since the energy density of propane is low, tanks are larger and it costs 
more to transport propane to a tank site. It’s also used up faster.
 
✓ If the temperature of propane gets too low (–29 degrees Fahrenheit) the 
liquid in the tank may not turn into a gas properly, and combustion is 
a mess, and may not even occur. This is a very low temperature, but in 
some areas it’s not impossible.
 
✓ If tanks are allowed to go completely empty, the interior walls will cor-
rode and oxidize. Odor fade occurs, and this increases the danger level.
 
✓ Many home heating systems require electricity to run.
Powering engines for transportation
Fossil fuels are by far the most common type of fuel used in transport, and 
there are a range of different types of engines that convert the fuel into use-
able energy.

87
 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
Gasoline engines
Most transport vehicles, including cars, trucks and aircraft, use internal-
combustion engines that run on gasoline. 
 
In a gasoline engine, gasoline is mixed with air in a carburetor which forms a 
fine mist (very explosive). The mist is injected into an enclosed cylinder that 
contains a moving piston confined very tightly into the cylinder. A spark plug 
ignites the mixture at exactly the right moment, and the piston undergoes 
great pressure. The spark and the ensuing explosion are referred to as ignition 
(it’s actually a small explosion, to be precise). The piston is connected to a 
rotating shaft (the crankshaft) by rods and bearings and due to the construc-
tion of the rod and crankshaft, torque rotates the crankshaft and provides 
motive power. The burned gas is exhausted through appropriate ports that 
open and close at the right phases in the cycle.
In most engines, there are a number of cylinders and the mechanical con-
figuration of the engine provides synchronous, highly tuned operation which 
provides considerable torque and power to the crankshaft. The crankshaft 
can be connected to any number of mechanical means including:
 
✓ Gear box for an automobile
 
✓ Electrical generator for producing electrical power
 
✓ Airplane propeller
Gasoline is produced in the refinement process of crude oil. In fact, a major-
ity of the crude oil that is refined ends up as gasoline. Gasoline also comes 
in grades, with the highest grade of gas containing the highest amounts of 
octane.
Ethanol is being added to gasoline in many parts of the country, and this 
helps to decrease the U.S. reliance on foreign oil because ethanol is a biofuel 
locally produced from corn (and other biomass) products. Ethanol is added 
at around a 10 percent to 15 percent ratio, and has no noticeable effect on 
the fuel’s performance. In addition to the natural hydrocarbons of gasoline, 
additives are mixed in to improve the burn efficiencies. 
Advantages of gasoline-powered engines include:
 
✓ Gas has a very high energy content per unit weight. A smaller gas tank 
may be used than would be required of other fuels, meaning less weight 
and size.
 
✓ Gas engines are very powerful, given their size and weight. There is no 
other fuel which affords such high performance ratios. If there were, 
race cars would use them.

88
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
 
✓ Gas engines can operate optimally over a wide range of temperatures 
and conditions.
 
✓ The existing infrastructure for gasoline engines is tremendous. You can 
buy one anywhere, and get one fixed anywhere. Millions of mechanics 
are well versed in their operation. Many young men know more about 
internal combustion than they do about U.S. history.
Disadvantages of gasoline engines are:
 
✓ Combustion of gasoline produces far too much carbon for a variety of 
reasons: 
 
• There are far too many gasoline engines in the world, and cheap 
ones abound, which are filth spewers of the first order.
 
• Gas engines need to be tuned properly or they’ll release a lot 
of carbon monoxide and other poisons, plus they won’t run 
efficiently.
 
✓ Gas is dangerous. It can ignite very easily, and will explode under a 
range of real world conditions. Gas is an extremely volatile liquid 
and changes state from liquid to vapor very quickly under most 
atmospheric conditions. As the ambient temperature rises, the 
vaporization increases, which causes safety concerns in hot climates. 
Different grades of gas are sold in different parts of the country, for this 
very reason.
 
✓ Sulfur compounds in gasoline contribute to acid rain.
 
✓ Because internal combustion engines rely on explosions (albeit tiny 
ones), they cause a lot of noise pollution. 
 
✓ Gasoline prices can go all over the map, at the drop of a hat. There is so 
much gasoline used in the world that supply issues inevitably arise.
 
✓ Gasoline additives (substances added to the basic fuel in order to 
improve performance or reduce pollution) have been shown to cause 
cancer in humans. Gas is everywhere, all the time, so this is a real 
problem. These additives are emitted as exhaust, and humans end up 
breathing them, or they settle into groundwater and humans drink them.
Diesel engines
 
A diesel engine is different than a gasoline engine in the way the fuel is 
ignited. A diesel engine doesn’t need a spark plug. As the piston moves up, com-
pression of the gases in the cylinder occur and this causes the temperature to 
rise. The heat of compression causes the injected diesel-oxygen mixture (from 
a carburetor) to ignite at just the right moment, and the cylinder is pushed back 
down with great force. The timing is important, and because the timing mecha-
nism is intrinsic to the engine structure it’s more difficult to tune a diesel engine 
than a gasoline engine. As with gasoline engines, diesel engines are usually multi-
cylinder as a way to increase the power output and torque capacity.

89
 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
Diesel fuel is derived during the crude oil cracking process, similar to 
the way gasoline is produced. It is used in large trucks and other heavy 
machinery because diesel engines provide more torque on a crankshaft, 
and this is necessary in heavy duty applications.
In consistency and combustion properties, diesel resembles heating oil more 
than gasoline. Vegetable oils and fatty substances can be added to diesel fuel 
(to a point) without suffering performance compromises. Biodiesel is much 
more common than bio-gasoline.
The pros of diesel engines include:
 
✓ Diesel is more energy dense than gasoline, meaning a tank holding 
diesel fuel contains more energy than does the same-sized tank filled 
with gasoline — a benefit that’s negated by diesel’s heavier weight. The 
higher prices of diesel fuels are offset by the fact that smaller volumes 
contain more potential energy.
 
✓ In some locations, and in some markets, diesel fuel is cheaper than 
gasoline, especially when the higher energy density is taken into account.
 
✓ Diesel can deliver more power, given the weight of the engine, than 
gasoline.
 
✓ Diesel combustion is inherently more efficient than gasoline, so better 
MPG ratings are the norm for diesel powered cars and trucks.
 
✓ Diesel combustion produces less CO exhaust than gasoline production.
 
✓ Diesel engines are more reliable than gasoline because they are inherently 
simpler. The lifetime of diesel engines is also better.
The disadvantages of diesel engines are:
 
✓ Diesel contains more sulfur than gasoline does, which exacerbates acid 
rain.
 
✓ Diesel exhaust stinks to high heaven, and there’s a lot of soot to boot. 
You can usually tell when a car has a diesel engine because there’s a 
telltale black sooty crud buildup above the exhaust pipe. And the 
exhaust is often very visible; we’ve all seen the black smoke belching 
from a large truck’s exhaust pipe.
 
✓ Diesel engines are finicky, and sometimes they just plain don’t want to 
start. You have to talk nice to them, and give them flowers on Diesel 
Engine Day or they’ll just get worse.
 
✓ In cold weather, diesel fuel becomes gelatinous and may even crystallize. 
This can cause catastrophic failure, and it may be impossible to start a 
diesel engine in really cold weather. The solution is to warm the engine, 
which is not real easy under most conditions. Starting a fire beneath the 
hood of your car is not generally advisable.

90
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
 
✓ Diesel fuels are carcinogenic. The exhaust from a diesel engine enters 
the air and humans breathe the vapors, and the exhaust products also 
settle onto the ground, and enter the water supply so that humans 
ingest trace amounts that aren’t filtered adequately by the municipal 
water companies.
Jet propulsion
 
In a jet engine, air enters the intake and is compressed by the compressor. 
The highly pressurized air moves back through the engine cylinder to the 
combustion chamber where fuel is injected, and the fuel-oxygen mixture is 
ignited or burned. The tremendous increase in temperature of the gas at that 
point causes extreme pressure in the chamber, and the pressure is chan-
neled through the exhaust nozzle at extremely high velocity. The exhausted 
gas velocity is much greater than the forward speed of the aircraft, so thrust 
occurs, and lots of it. The turbine in the gas stream is used to provide power 
for spinning the compressor, once the engine is running. It also provides 
power for onboard functions like electronics and lighting, although many jets 
have onboard power generators that serve to provide this function exclusively. 
Jet engines work best at high aircraft speeds (higher than 400 mph) because 
they are capable of accelerating a small amount of air by such a huge factor. 
The efficiency of a jet engine goes up with airspeed, as a consequence.
Jet engines require highly refined fuels. Most jet fuel is derived from kerosene, 
which is obtained during the crude oil refining process, but it can also be 
made from coal, although this is a more energy intense endeavor, and so less 
efficient. When kerosene is refined for jet fuel, sulfur content is minimized, as 
well as the natural corrosive properties inherent to kerosene (you wouldn’t 
want your jet engine to corrode while you’re in the air, would you?). The 
most common kerosene based jet fuel in use is called JET A, which freezes 
at –40 degrees Fahrenheit. Higher altitude jets must use JET B, which freezes 
at lower temperatures but is more volatile, and expensive.
To keep from becoming too viscous at cold temperatures, jet fuels contain 
antioxidants. They also contain substances that keep the fuel from igniting 
due to electrical sparks (this sounds like a very good idea for anybody who 
flies on jets).
There is one big advantage of jet engines: There is simply no other energy-
producing means that can propel a huge airliner so fast, so far, with so little 
fuel. In other words, there are no alternatives aside from Superman. Propeller 
aircraft are powered by gas piston engines, which work better in some con-
ditions. But for simply producing raw power, nothing comes close to a jet 
engine.

91
 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
Of course there are disadvantages with jet engines:
 
✓ A lot of CO2 is produced in the combustion process. Jets pollute more 
per passenger mile than any other type of transport, and the pollution 
comes out at high altitudes, which creates unique environmental 
problems. Sulfur content produces acid rain.
 
✓ Fuel is very hazardous, and the danger of explosions and fires is very 
real. The overhead rate for ensuring safety is expensive. 
 
✓ Noise is extreme. When jet engines are running full bore, the sound can 
blow an eardrum. And jet engines need to be running full bore in order 
to maximize efficiency.
 
✓ High altitude jets produce contrails, which are white trails of crystallized 
water vapor, and this affects the natural ambient of the upper atmosphere 
by concentrating heat into small regions, which end up dissipating and 
affecting the way the upper atmosphere influences weather patterns.
 
✓ Jet fuels are carcinogenic.
 
✓ Jet fuel costs rise and fall faster than any other fuel type. The refining 
process is more involved, and requires high grade raw ingredients 
which are not always available in good supply.
Utility scale power plants
At the heart of every thermal power plant is the combustion of fossil fuel 
energy sources. Coal is by far the most prevalent type of power plant in the 
United States, followed by natural gas.
 
In all cases (including nuclear), heat is generated and that is used to boil 
water (or other liquid), which in turn is used to rotate a turbine/generator. A 
turbine is simply a fan; when air pressure or steam pressure is set against the 
fan blades it causes the shaft to spin (this is intuitive). A generator is like an 
electric motor, except operating in reverse. When a generator’s shaft is forced 
to turn, two output wires provide electrical power (as opposed to the opera-
tion of a fan, where electrical power is supplied to two wires and the fan blade 
spins).
Coal-fired power plants
Modern coal-fired plants are very sophisticated, and in the U.S. the pollution 
control equipment has reduced noxious emissions by a large factor over 
older type systems.

92
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Coal is mined, then cleaned and de-gassed, then transported to the power 
plant site via railroad. (All coal plants are located next to railroad tracks 
because there simply is no other way to transport the massive amounts of 
coal needed for large scale utility production of power.) Coal is loaded into 
the hopper which feeds the raw fuel through a pulverizer that turns the hard 
chunks into a fine dust. A blower forces this dust into the combustion chamber 
(along with the prescribed amount of oxygen) where it burns at a carefully 
controlled temperature and pressure. The resulting heat converts liquid 
water into a very high energy steam, which in turn spins a large turbine con-
nected to an electrical generator. The steam is condensed back into liquid 
water form, which re-circulates through the system via a feed pump. 
 
Even with the technical advances in pollution mitigation, coal is still a very 
dirty business, and since we use so much of it, coal fired power plants are a 
major contributor to greenhouse gases. This is especially true in the develop-
ing world, where the pollution control equipment is often substandard, if it’s 
installed at all.
The advantages of coal-fired power plants are:
 
✓ Coal is the most abundant energy source in the United States. There is 
no shortage of coal, and foreign political turmoil does not interrupt the 
flow of coal.
 
✓ Modern plants are very efficient in terms of producing copious amounts 
of electrical power from the raw fuel.
 
✓ Power plants are prevalent, and the technology is mature. This makes 
for less risky capital investments.
 
✓ Capital expenditures for coal-fired power plants are smaller than for 
other options. In fact, if a plant is built with minimal pollution control 
equipment, the cost can be extremely low. This is why third world coun-
tries build so many coal-fired plants.
 
✓ The combustion chambers can use a wide range of different qualities of 
coal, and this makes the supply issue even more advantageous.
Of course there are a number of cons to coal-fired plants as well:
 
✓ Coal combustion is the dirtiest of all fossil fuel energy sources. CO2 
exhaust is very high, as well as CO and sulfur compounds. Emission 
controls have brought the pollution levels down considerably, but these 
are costly.
 
✓ Coal mining is very harsh on the environment. Some mines completely 
strip hillsides, leaving ugly, permanent scars. Toxic chemicals are 
released into the environment near coal mines. These include mercury, 
lead, and arsenic. Ground water pollution is a real problem near 
coal mines.

93
 Chapter 5: Burning Up with Conventional Energy Sources
 
✓ Coal mines are dangerous and the labor is hard and unhealthy.
 
✓ The cost of transporting coal is high, and the cost of machinery to move 
the massive amounts of stinky, tarry material is also high. Coal trains are 
noisy and environmentally invasive.
 
✓ There is a waste problem associated with all the ash and soot leftover 
from coal combustion.
 
✓ The water used to make steam becomes polluted after a time, and this is 
a disposal nightmare.
Methane-fired power plants
A well designed methane-fired power plant is more efficient than either coal 
or oil fired plants, plus they pollute much less. Note that there are two elec-
trical outputs. Instead of wasting the heat from the combustion cycle, it is 
channeled into a second boiler/turbine system. This enhances the efficiency 
of the process by a large margin.
Advantages abound:
 
✓ Methane affords low carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, 
and sulfur oxides pollution levels over coal and oil.
 
✓ These power plants are very efficient in terms of their power output 
divided by the amount of raw fuel they consume.
 
✓ Methane is readily available around urban areas where large power 
plants are used the most.
 
✓ Pipelines supply the raw fuel, which obviates trains and other ground 
transportation.
 
✓ Methane plants can be modified to burn hydrogen gas (there is no 
carbon pollution at all with hydrogen gas). While hydrogen gas is not 
yet available, investing in methane-fired power plant infrastructure is 
wise because when hydrogen does become available, the equipment will 
largely be in place (modifications are needed, but these are much less 
costly than starting from scratch).
And of course, in the far corner are all the disadvantages:
 
✓ Methane is dangerous stuff. If it leaks into the air, it can explode in 
spectacular fashion.
 
✓ Price spikes are common, so the cost to the utilities varies and this gets 
passed on down to the customers.
 
✓ Methane exploration and recovery is environmentally damaging.
 
✓ Methane does produce carbon dioxide, albeit in smaller amounts than 
coal or oil, but it’s still there.

94
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Oil-fired power plants
Relatively rare are oil-fired power plants. They operate basically the same as 
a coal-fired plant, but with a large oil combustion turbine in place of the coal 
furnace (a combustion turbine resembles a jet engine). There are very few of 
these being built now, since methane-powered plants have taken over as the 
generator of choice, when it comes to fossil fuels.
Oil is safer than methane, and the supply lines for oil are more common than 
those of methane (which require pipelines). The combustion turbines can be 
modified to accept coal or methane, but this is also rare. Oil is a high density 
fuel, so the entire process is more efficient, weight-wise, than a coal plant.
But the pollution levels are high, and the overall efficiency is nowhere near as 
good as a combined cycle system.

▶ Affecting energy consumption with efficiency and price
▶ Pushing through present-day macro-level efficiency efforts
▶ Knowing what you can do to improve your own energy efficiency
T
he U.S. can save up to 10 percent of the energy it uses by simply using 
energy more efficiently. Plus, another 10 percent can be saved by invest-
ing only 5 percent of the current U.S. energy budget in new technology and 
infrastructure. 
The point? That even without resorting to alternative energy technologies 
(a whole bunch of which are explained in Parts III and IV), mankind can do 
much more to use current conventional resources more efficiently. Major 
increases in efficiency are coming down the technological pipeline all the 
time. Cars are growing more efficient, as well as appliances and lighting sys-
tems. Building codes are mandating higher efficiency heating and cooling 
systems. And perhaps most important of all, hybrid and electric auto tech-
nologies will radically improve the efficiency performance of the transport 
sector. Because of these advances, the first alternative energy source is using 
energy more efficiently and practicing conservation. 
Most books on the subject don’t take this approach, but in this chapter I 
explain how this could work. I describe how efficient technologies have 
affected our energy markets, how big players — utility companies, communi-
ties, and so on — are getting in on the efficiency act, and how each of us can 
make a difference. If enough people begin practicing efficiency and conserva-
tion, the U.S. could improve our situation drastically, without even investing 
in expensive and risky alternative energy propositions.

Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Efficiency, Consumption, 
and the Energy Market
Efficiency is not the main factor in reducing energy consumption. While it 
seems only logical that rising efficiencies will result in reduction in demand, 
the truth seems to be that increasing efficiency actually increases demand.
So if efficiency isn’t the main factor, what is? Price. The only way that con-
sumption will ever be reduced is by raising the price of energy. Because effi-
ciency gains result in increased energy consumption, it’s up to the government 
to tax consumption to the point where people use less energy. This is a dif-
ficult proposition, because Americans have become used to low energy prices. 
Plus, it will take bravery on the part of politicians to push such policies; there 
doesn’t appear to be much of that commodity on hand in today’s politicians.
In the following sections, I walk you through the different pieces that make 
up the puzzle of the energy market, and I give you enough basic info to 
demystify the factors that impact the market and the ability of society to be 
more efficient with its energy use.
Efficiency increases demand
After the Arab oil embargo of the ’70s, the governments of the world acknowl-
edged a need to consume less energy, and a number of policies were insti-
tuted to effect fundamental changes. But America’s total energy consumption 
has risen by over 30 percent since the oil embargo of the 1970s and electrical 
consumption has risen by 50 percent. 
Per unit of energy, the U.S. produces twice as much economic output as it did 
in 1950. This is an amazing increase in efficiency, but during the same time 
period, U.S. consumption of energy has increased threefold. Figure 6-1 shows 
the efficiency of the U.S. economy versus total energy consumption.

 Chapter 6: The First Alternative-Energy Sources: Efficiency and Conservation
American economic output per unit of energy is the highest in the world. 
Americans provide by far the greatest economic stimulus to the world econ-
omy, and everybody benefits. Higher efficiency allows people to do more, 
and do it in less time. Time is the hidden variable, and due to mankind’s 
intrinsic impatience it’s time that swamps all the other variables. Time is 
money, and for most people it’s a lot of money.
Carbohydrates versus hydrocarbons
Some people wistfully look back on the days 
when the economy was powered by carbohy-
drates, as opposed to hydrocarbons. One such 
group, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, 
exhorts people to revert to the “carbohydrate” 
economy, or agriculture. They promote 
farming — specifically a pre-mechanized 
agricultural society — as the solution to the 
current energy woes. At first glance, you may 
think that that’s not such a bad idea, but here 
are some facts:
 ✓ Drilling for oil takes very little land area 
compared to growing carbohydrate energy 
sources — about 1,000 times less land 
area, in fact, on a per unit of energy basis. 
If you’re concerned with deforestation, car-
bohydrates are not the solution because 
forests are cleared and land is tilled to 
make way for productive agriculture.
 ✓ A car engine, including all the refineries 
and distribution networks that make it work, 
is 16 times more efficient at converting 
crude oil to locomotion than a meat-eating 
cyclist who relies on a vast grid of farming, 
cultivating, livestock production, slaughter
houses, distribution systems, grocery 
shelves, transport to and from the grocery 
store, and finally cooking and eating and 
digesting in front of the television.
 ✓ Plowing land for growing carbohydrates 
adds more carbon to the air than mining for 
coal or drilling for oil because farms require 
such huge amounts of cleared land, and the 
machinery used on farms is very energy 
intensive.
 ✓ Economies in the parts of the world that 
rely on carbohydrates are always far 
behind economies that rely on hydrocar-
bons in terms of productivity and quality 
of life. This is not simply a reflection that 
these “backwards” economies don’t have 
our sophisticated machines, it’s a fact of 
energy production. Thriving economies’ 
energy production is much more efficient 
at producing and using useable, or ordered, 
energy. The production is more concen-
trated, and this is good for the environment. 
It’s not the production of fossil fuels that 
harms the environment, it’s the byproducts 
of using those fossil fuels that is becoming 
troublesome.
In short, the carbohydrate economy is much 
worse for the atmosphere, in terms of pollution, 
than the current hydrocarbon economy. This 
illustrates a key point you must remember: The 
way things appear to be are often not necessar-
ily what they are. Living creatures, especially 
farm animals and horses, require a lot of land, 
and they’re not efficient at converting that land 
into useable energy. Machines are efficient and 
powerful, and they produce high-grade, refined 
energy that performs magical tricks.

98
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
The 55 mph mandate is a case in point. Following the Arab oil embargo of 
the 1970s, the U.S. government passed a federal speed limit of 55 mph. While 
it’s true that driving your car at 55 mph saves gasoline, nobody paid much 
attention. The reason? It took longer to get to where you’re going. Mandating 
slower speeds comes with a real cost, that of man hours. The fact that people 
place more of a premium on their personal time than on the amount of gas 
mileage they achieve gets to the very foundation of the problem with energy: 
People don’t just look at the total amount of energy they use; instead, they 
look at convenience, time, energy-consuming processes, and a whole host 
of other factors (refer to Chapter 3). Figure 6-2 shows how the efficiency of 
energy consumption per passenger mile has improved while our total aggre-
gate consumption of energy has risen.

Increasing population, increasing demand, 
and a bit of bad advice
In the early 1980s, efficiency advocates assured 
everyone that the demand for electrical power 
would remain flat well into the future. Their rea-
soning held that increases in efficiency would 
offset the increase in demand for energy. 
Things didn’t quite turn out that way. In fact, 
demand has doubled, in spite of huge advances 
in efficiency and conservation measures. Part 
of the problem is that the world’s population is 
constantly increasing, and even if each indi-
vidual uses less power, there are more people 
requiring it.
Not only were the prognosticators wrong, but 
their assumption that demand would remain flat 
has led to some terrible problems. In California, 
for example, no new power plants have been 
built in over 20 years. As a result, California has 
experienced peak-energy supply problems that 
resulted in Governor Gray Davis being booted 
out of office (of course, the fact that his oppo-
nent was Arnold Schwarzenegger, a famous 
movie star, didn’t help matters, voters being 
what they are, especially in loosey-goosey 
California).

99
 Chapter 6: The First Alternative-Energy Sources: Efficiency and Conservation
If you simply plug in a more efficient light bulb, like a fluorescent, a net gain 
in efficiency results. If you put a smaller, more fuel-efficient engine into an 
auto, the result is an efficiency gain. But that’s not how things work. Most 
people don’t typically replace working parts with new parts just to gain a bit 
of efficiency. People don’t plug in a new light bulb until the old one burns out. 
People don’t replace an old engine with a new one; they buy a whole new car. 
Basically, people replace old systems with new systems, and then still use 
the old systems. The net effect is to increase the amount of systems and, as a 
result, the total aggregate amount of energy consumed.
 
In order to reduce energy consumption, a new, more efficient technology (of 
which there is no shortage) must have a bigger impact in the new markets that 
are created than the old markets that are displaced. New efficiency technolo-
gies must displace the old technologies, and when these new products enter 
the market, new uses for those products arise so that new markets swamp the 
old markets.
Lighting is a case in point. There are millions of new uses for LEDs, which are 
an order of magnitude more efficient than the incandescent bulbs that they 
replace. Jumbotrons are everywhere now: in advertising signs, at ballparks, 
along roadways to direct traffic, and so on. While an LED light can be plugged 
into an existing socket in a home and achieve better energy efficiency in the 
home, the myriad of new uses for LEDs has dwarfed any efficiency gains that 
have resulted from replacing existing lighting schemes.
Price increases and decreased energy use
The real price of energy has consistently gone down over the last 100 years 
(I explain why in Chapter 3). As the price of energy has fallen steadily, con-
sumption has risen. So it makes sense that, if prices rise, consumption falls. 
And this is, in fact, what happens.
In 1979, during the Arab oil embargo, for example, Americans cut back 
on driving, purchased smaller cars with better mileage, and dramatically 
reduced their use of oil. The motivator? The price spikes that accompanied 
the embargo.
 
In the four years after 1979, the country weaned itself off of over 3 million 
barrels per day. Not until 1997 did the country get back to the same level as 
1978. But half of that cut was in residential fuel usage for generating electric-
ity. Americans switched a lot of power generators over to coal and natural gas. 
The U.S. didn’t really reduce its use of energy as much as it might seem, given 
the record — the country simply played a shell game and switched to different 
sources. While this was good for the economy, and for political independence 
from foreign sources, it didn’t make a lot of difference to the environment.

100
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Aware of the connection between prices and consumption, federal and state 
governments increase taxes on certain types of energy sources specifically 
to impact consumption levels. These taxes increase the cost of gasoline by 
40 percent and electricity costs 20 to 80 percent. The Clinton Administration 
proposed a comprehensive tax on energy, but it was never effectively facili-
tated. In Europe, energy prices are roughly twice what they are in the U.S., 
and this has resulted in Europeans using much less energy per capita than 
Americans. So there is no denying the effect of higher energy taxes. But the 
politics is very problematic. Any politician that advocates higher energy 
taxes is not a politician for very long.
Back to the future, from 1979 to now
We’re facing an energy crisis now. So the big 
question is, Can we learn to conserve again, as 
we did during the energy crisis of the 1970s? 
Things have changed a lot since then:
 ✓ We’re bigger and busier now, and our 
economy is nearly five times as large now 
as it was then. On average, we drive nearly 
twice as many miles per day as we did 
in 1979. 
 ✓ The current high price of fuel is actually 
lower, in real terms, than it was in 1979. 
This means that fuel price fluctuations don’t 
make as big a difference now as they did 
in 1979. Fuel prices are a smaller percent-
age of our economy, both personal and as 
a whole, than they were in 1979.
 ✓ The 1979 crisis was predicated on the 
supply side; the Arab countries reduced the 
supply, despite the fact that demand was 
as high as ever, and prices soared. Since 
then, many other regions have begun sup-
plying oil, like Mexico and the North Sea 
and Alaska. But unlike in 1979, there are 
no huge new reserves about to open up to 
drilling. 
 ✓ In 1979, stagflation, unemployment, and a 
miserable economy prevailed, and consumers 
simply stopped using so much oil. Today our 
economy is much less sluggish, even in spite 
of the credit crunches sweeping the world.
 ✓ Globally, the U.S. is a smaller piece of the 
pie than it used to be. While our economy 
has been growing like crazy, other econo-
mies have also been growing, and at a 
faster pace. In 1979, we used 29 percent 
of the world’s oil, now it’s only 24 percent. 
In all, global demand for oil is expected to 
rise by over 1 million barrels per day. It’s 
what’s happening in China and India that 
matters now.
 ✓ Like the boy who cried wolf, economic 
impacts of energy price surges in the past 
have taught that things will eventually iron 
themselves out. It will take a major calam-
ity to get people motivated to conserve the 
way we did back in the seventies. Back in 
those days, we believed in the wolf; today 
we’re much more jaded (for better or for 
worse).
On the flip side of the coin, efficiency gains have 
become much more permanent, and consumers 
are clamoring for more fuel efficient cars and 
trucks. People understand efficiency and con-
servation much better than at any time in the 
past. And people are also beginning to under-
stand how important the environmental effects 
of energy consumption are. Back in 1979, it 
was all about economics; now it’s a two-fold 
problem — economics and environment.

101
 Chapter 6: The First Alternative-Energy Sources: Efficiency and Conservation
Big-Picture Strategies for Reducing 
Energy Consumption
On a large scale, entire communities are making inroads to reduce energy 
consumption. Governments are mandating green technologies, and systems 
that will help to reduce energy consumption. Automakers and industries are 
also improving technologies that afford better efficiencies. The trend toward 
conservation and efficiency is very powerful and is growing by leaps and 
bounds each year. I cover the efforts toward conservation in the sections 
that follow.
Dealing with peak-demand problems
On a macro level, one of the best ways to reduce energy consumption is 
related to the peak-demand problem. Peak demand occurs when a utility 
company is called upon to provide more power to their customers than they 
are capable of providing, given their current resources. As a result, small gen-
erators are turned on, and these are much less efficient in several regards (go 
to Chapter 3 to find out why bigger generators are more efficient).
By requiring all homes and businesses to use TOU (time of use) meters, 
which charge different rates depending on the time of use of the energy, this 
problem can be solved. In California, peak-power prices are around three 
times off-peak prices (31 cents per kWh versus around 11 cents per kWh). 
This reduces not only aggregate demand, but it also reduces demand during 
the peak times. It also reduces pollution.
Expect to see more TOU metering schemes in the future because they make 
a lot of sense in conservation terms. People may not like the fact that they 
can’t use their air-conditioners whenever they want, and as much as they 
would like, but they do respond to cost differentials.
Dealing with urban sprawl
Urban sprawl fragments wildlife and Mother Nature’s natural designs. 
Low-density housing developments take far more resources per dwelling 
than high-density city habitats. And the public transportation options are 
severely limited, meaning most people own cars and use them quite a bit. 
Infrastructure systems such as water, sewer, trash, and electricity all have to 
be stretched out, meaning more resources are required to deliver these ser-
vices to customers.

102
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Cities easily provide more opportunities for energy efficiency. High-rise 
housing affords no opportunity for landscaping and the water usage that 
goes along with it. Community housing structures have common walls, so 
the energy used per resident is lower. Water, sewer, and trash require fewer 
resources per resident. The list goes on.
The reality, however, is that people are constantly leaving the dense housing 
of the cities for the more spacious lifestyles of the suburbs. The quality of 
life is often much better, and the elbow room is essential for certain facets of 
mental health.
The solution would seem to be to integrate the best of both worlds, and in 
many suburban towns this is the goal.
Promoting green communities
Different types of communities have different attributes that can make 
becoming energy-efficient more or less accessible. With the interest in green 
living on the upsurge, many cities and states have taken steps to make them-
selves havens for environmentally conscious citizens. But maybe you don’t 
want to live in a community at all. Perhaps you want to join a commune or 
you’re interested in going off-grid, or back to nature. Each situation has its 
pros and cons, though more cons are associated with going it alone.
The best communities are those that dedicate their fundamental philoso-
phies to going green, and more and more of these are cropping up all the 
time. Green cities promote environmental policies aimed toward making 
it easier for their citizens to be kind to Mother Nature. The characteristics 
outlined in the following sections are indicators of municipalities that take 
energy efficiency and pollution reduction seriously.
Air quality
In an effort to improve air quality, over 250 cities have committed to con-
forming to the Climate Protection Agreement, which encourages cities to 
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent from 1990 levels. Some 
of the best cities include San Francisco, California; Portland, Oregon; Austin, 
Texas; Boulder, Colorado; and Cincinnati, Ohio.
 
A list of the top ten green cities is put out annually by National Geographic’s 
The Green Guide, which informs consumers about a wide range of green 
issues. Check out www.thegreenguide.com.

103
 Chapter 6: The First Alternative-Energy Sources: Efficiency and Conservation
Public transportation
Commuting is a big factor in finding an energy-efficient community. In gen-
eral, cities that take green living seriously provide good public transporta-
tion, which enables citizens to save a lot of energy on transport costs. Public 
transportation is also much less polluting than having thousands of cars on 
the road, so everybody’s air quality benefits. You may or may not want to use 
public transportation, but the fact that it exists in a workable state says a lot 
about a city’s general attitude. Check a city’s public transportation by using 
it — or trying to, as the case may be.
Utility structures
When you check a city’s utility structures, take the following into consideration:
 
✓ Where does the city get its energy? Is it nuclear? Derived from coal 
plants? Driven by hydropower or other renewables?
 
✓ How much pollution per kWh does the city’s utility generate? The 
average number of pounds of carbon dioxide per kWh is 2. Anything less 
is good. Any community that gets power from a nuclear reactor will be 
way below the average.
 
✓ How much does power cost? The fact that power is expensive may be a 
good thing, even though it costs more. Expensive power means that effi-
ciency investments are more cost-effective, and efficient homes are worth 
more because they’re cheaper to live in. And when power rates are high, 
the community is likely to be cleaner because less power is used.
 
 Check out a community’s utility rates by going online to the Web sites of 
the various utilities. You can check the online yellow pages under “utili-
ties” to find the names — and sometimes even the Web addresses — of 
a community’s utilities. You can also check out www.sustainlane.us 
and www.eere.energy.gov/greenpower for lists of cities that promote 
and subsidize the use of alternative energy.
 
✓ Is a tiered rate structure utilized? Tiered rate structures allow residents 
to use as much or as little power as they want, but the tiered rates 
penalize profligacy.
Recycling programs
Recycling is possible for any household, but it helps if your community has set 
up a formal regimen whereby recycling is centralized and encouraged. When 
this is the case, the costs of transportation and processing are borne equally 
by all citizens through utility bills. The better communities provide recycling 
containers that you set out on the street with your regular trash. The best 
provide different containers for different types of recycled materials — for 
instance, aluminum and metal, plastics, newspapers, and boxes. Some 
communities even remove lawn clippings and organic refuse.

104
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Water supply
A city’s water supply is critically important for a number of reasons. First, it 
must be pristine and clean. Otherwise, you’ll have to buy drinking water or a 
filter system. Second, some cities simply don’t have enough water. You can 
conserve, but if too many hands are reaching into the pie, costs are likely 
to rise, as is the amount of pressure to reduce usage even more. Find out 
whether the community has installed water meters. If so, homeowners are a 
lot more likely to use less water. In communities where water meters don’t 
exist, the people have absolutely no incentive to use less water.
Housing designs
In green communities, home designs are ultra-efficient, with solar exposures 
and strategically planted deciduous trees. Homes feature thick insulation, 
double-pane windows, window coverings, automatic awnings for hot summer 
days, solar attic vent systems to purge hot air from attic spaces, whole-house 
fans, and solar light tubes in all kitchens. Skylights are used as much as 
possible, along with passive solar heating and cooling arrangements.
 
Some communities specifically demand sustainable housing designs. The U.S. 
Green Building Council (USGBD) runs a program called Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design (LEED) that sets criteria for what constitutes green 
building. These criteria include things like:
 
✓ Insulation properties in the walls and ceilings
 
✓ The design and placement of windows in a building (called fenestration), 
which affects not only the insulation properties but also the availability 
of solar lighting and heating
 
✓ The type and operation of any HVAC systems
 
✓ Use of water resources and on-site means for conserving water
 
✓ Installation of any solar energy systems
Making transportation more efficient
Two-thirds of the oil being consumed is used for transportation, so the most 
effective and immediate area to look for material improvements in fuel con-
sumption reductions is transport. Improving fuel efficiency and conservation 
both offer their own gains.

105
 Chapter 6: The First Alternative-Energy Sources: Efficiency and Conservation
In the U.S., the average fuel efficiency of a vehicle is 55 percent better than 
in 1960. The ban on leaded gasoline, higher fuel economy standards, and the 
widespread use of catalytic converters have decreased the pollution levels (per 
vehicle) by 60 percent. But the number of vehicles on the road has skyrocketed, 
doubling since 1960. The number of miles driven per year has tripled, from less 
than 600 billion miles to well over 1.6 trillion miles (wow . . .). Transportation is 
responsible for the release of half of nitrogen oxides, which cause smog and acid 
rain. And transport accounts for over 85 percent of carbon monoxide emissions. 
Each year, America’s 128 million autos and trucks account for nearly 300 million 
tons of carbon being released into the environment.
 
Because efficiency gains, on their own, only lead to increasing energy con-
sumption, not decreasing, reducing energy consumption requires conserva-
tion and efficiency improvements to go hand in hand. Unfortunately, since 
the oil shocks of the ’70s, Congress has done nothing but relax the MPG stan-
dards, and the efficient technologies have not grown the way they could have. 
To make matters worse, tax policies have actually favored big gas pigs, like 
the Hummer H2.
Making more efficient autos
Cars are mostly bulk: huge masses of metal and steel that do little more than 
channel power and energy to where it’s needed. With the advent of electri-
cal power systems, these bulky subsystems will give way to smaller, lighter, 
more fuel efficient systems that offer the same quality of performance as the 
current technologies. Some examples:
 
✓ New power semiconductors displace thousands of pounds of grinding, 
smoking, burning mechanical and hydraulic parts with ounces of semi-
conductors. (Not only are these drastic improvements being realized 
in autos, but also in large manufacturing plants that use laser welding 
machines and complex robotics.)
 
✓ With intelligent processors, there’s less pollution. Emissions can be 
reduced by 50 percent and efficiencies can be raised by more than 20 
percent. Less use of fossil fuel lubricants, less use of fossil fuels for 
drivetrain power. Less use of all sorts of noxious compounds. And intel-
ligent efficiency increases don’t reduce pollution in the same way that 
catalytic converters do, by scrubbing fossil fuel emissions and reducing 
efficiency in the process. They reduce emissions by simply reducing fuel 
consumption in the first place. This is a much better way to achieve the 
same end result.

106
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
 
✓ Electrical control systems can run internal combustion vehicles at a 
much finer degree than the current mechanical control systems (valves, 
fuel injectors, etc.). Emissions can be further reduced, as a consequence.
 
 Equivalent improvements can be made whenever combustion and ther-
mal processes are used in manufacturing processes to treat materials. 
There are literally billions of valves and firing systems that now control 
combustion processes, and when these are outfitted with intelligent 
electrical controls the improvements in efficiency and emissions are 
remarkable. In particular, hybrid cars rely on batteries and electrical 
powertrain systems for their drive power a majority of the time. When 
the batteries simply can’t keep up with demand, a small diesel motor 
kicks in and runs at a very specific rate of speed, with its load also care-
fully controlled. This results in much better efficiency and emissions, 
without compromising the quality of the ride. Head to Chapter 19 for 
more information about hybrids. 
 
Fuel demand would be much higher today if it weren’t for the impressive 
increases in fuel efficiency of modern autos, and pollution would be much 
worse without catalytic converters and the many techniques employed to 
reduce toxic wastes from internal combustion engines. Witness the terrible 
air in China, which has very few internal combustion engines compared to the 
U.S. but much worst air quality. Imagine if every Chinese citizen owned a car, 
and add to that thought the notion that their cars would not have much by 
way of pollution mitigation equipment. The world needs Chinese cyclists.
Conserving fuel with higher MPG ratings
According to the Sierra Club, the U.S. could easily reduce its oil consump-
tion by over 15 percent, or the equivalent of 3 million barrels a day of oil, by 
simply increasing the SUV standard from 20.7 MPG to 40 MPG.
Auto manufacturers currently have the technology to build conventional pas-
senger cars and trucks that average 30 to 40 MPG without sacrificing power, 
performance, or even comfort. A report written by the Union of Concerned 
Scientists (UCS) includes detailed plans for two different SUV designs equiva-
lent in size to commonly available current SUVs, but vehicle designs in the 
report average over 27 MPG and 36 MPG. Adding the necessary technolo-
gies would only increase the cost by $600 and $2,500, respectively. In each 
case, thousands of dollars would be saved on fuel costs, thereby recouping 
the added costs in a matter of a few years. Why haven’t these changes been 
implemented? The market simply doesn’t care at this point in time.

107
 Chapter 6: The First Alternative-Energy Sources: Efficiency and Conservation
Another study concluded that if the U.S. were to shift its usage of passenger 
autos to hybrids (like the Toyota Prius), Americans would reduce their oil 
consumption by 50 percent. 
CAFE and MPG performance
Gains in fuel efficiency were prodded by the 
1973 Arab oil embargo, when Congress enacted 
the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) 
standards that are still in place today, in varied 
form. In 1973, cars averaged 13.5 MPG (miles 
per gallon) and nobody really cared. Trucks, 
minivans, and SUVs averaged only 11.6 MPG. 
Congress required manufacturers to increase 
fuel efficiency to 27.5 MPG for cars and 20.7 
MPG for light trucks.
So what happened? In the U.S., the average 
MPG performance of vehicles fell to its lowest 
overall record since 1981, predominantly due 
to increased sales of light trucks and SUVs. 
So while efficiencies increased, consumers 
demanded larger vehicles and the efficiencies 
were more than offset. 
In the last two decades, SUV sales have 
increased 20 fold, making up 25 percent of total 
automobile purchases. The average vehicle 
in the small truck/SUV category has a fuel 
efficiency rating 30 percent lower than autos. 
The lower fuel economy of light trucks and 
SUVs results in a 40 percent increase in green-
house gas emissions, and more than a 50 per-
cent increase in nitrogen oxide. People simply 
switched to SUVs and trucks, in response to the 
government regulations.
While improvements in passenger cars have 
been impressive, albeit behind the mandated 
goals, buses and heavy trucks are still the most 
significant polluters on the planet. Single trucks 
can emit up to 150 times more noxious chemi-
cals into the environment than a passenger 
auto. Diesel fueled trucks are not required to 
have pollution control devices, and as a conse-
quence they release prolific clouds of fine dust, 
soot, and toxins into the air. Air quality studies 
indicate that trucks cause 125,000 cancer cases 
and 50,000 premature deaths due to their diesel 
exhausts.
It is estimated that 90 percent of the pollution 
could be eliminated from trucks with effective 
mandates. And fuel efficiency for all transport 
could be increased by over 30 percent. The 
problem is that trucks have lifetimes of over 25 
years, and the mandates will only apply to new 
trucks, which will become more expensive as a 
consequence. And as a consequence of their 
being more expensive, decisions to buy new 
trucks to replace the old will be put off longer, 
thereby increasing the lifetime of old trucks 
even more. In this case, mandating strict effi-
ciency and pollution standards will likely result 
in more pollution and fuel consumption, not less. 
This is a difficult paradox to overcome.

Efficiency and Conservation Changes 
You Can Make in the Home
Despite the fact that energy efficiency technologies end up creating even 
more demand for energy, the game is not lost. There are a wide range of 
things people can do on their own to conserve energy use, and most of these 
are relatively straightforward, and practical. In this section I describe some 
of the best ways to save energy, and in the process, reduce pollution.
For a much more complete coverage of energy efficiency in the home, consult 
my book Energy Efficient Homes For Dummies (Wiley).
There are a lot of things you can do to use your current appliances and 
energy consuming systems more efficiently, as the following sections explain.
Seal and insulate your home
You probably spend more energy on heating and cooling than you do on all 
the other energy-consuming functions combined. This means the greatest 
potential for energy savings lies in finding ways to make your heating and 
cooling efforts more efficient. Sealing and insulating is where you can find 
the biggest energy-efficiency improvements for the least amount of cash and 
labor on your part. Most homes have problems that can be fixed for $100 or 
less — in fact, sometimes all you need to invest are a little time and labor. 
Most people have not even inspected their homes for leaks, and the most 
obvious ones are the worst offenders. Just by visually inspecting ductwork 
and window seals you can usually find the big culprits within half an hour’s 
time. Seal with caulk; it’s easy and quick and effective.
Tune up your heating and 
air-conditioning system
Most homes have both heating and cooling systems. Together, these account 
for a large portion of your total energy use. (To find out just how much of 
your energy consumption is devoted to heating and cooling your home, do 
a home energy audit. Refer to Energy Efficient Homes For Dummies for a sys-
tematic procedure.) If you haven’t had your HVAC serviced in over five years, 
it’ll be worth the $100 cost because almost every system can be tuned to run 
better and more efficiently.

109
 Chapter 6: The First Alternative-Energy Sources: Efficiency and Conservation
Use efficient bulbs
The typical North American home spends between 8 and 10 percent of its 
energy budget on lighting (not including the bulbs and equipment). In any 
given night, the average home uses 32 light bulbs, including not only lighting 
for rooms, but lighting inside refrigerators, ovens, and microwaves. Most of 
these light bulbs are the standard, 50-cent, screw-base style using a technol-
ogy that has been around for over 100 years. People have spent the vast 
majority of their lives with Thomas Edison’s original brainstorm. But things 
are changing. A number of choices are available now that, while more expen-
sive up front, provide much better economics and performance over the life-
time of the product. They also offer lower pollution.
Fluorescents led the way, and the LEDs are quickly catching up. Most homes 
use a lot more lighting than is strictly needed, so take a critical look at how 
and when you’re using lights. You’ll find that you can cut it back by around 
50 percent without sacrificing much quality of lifestyle.
Reduce water consumption
The minimal human requirement for water is only around four gallons per 
day, and that’s for both consumption and cleaning. So how much does a typi-
cal American family (two adults, two kids) use? Between 200 and 350 gallons 
of water a day. That’s 73,000 to 128,000 gallons per year. Landscaping, swim-
ming pools, and spas take even more water. A small, working ranch may use 
over 270,000 gallons per year. Bluntly put, that’s a well of a lot of water.
In most homes, water has four main destinations: faucets, showers (baths), 
dishwashers, and washing machines. In each case, water heating may be 
required, which consumes around 20 percent of a typical home’s energy 
costs. Other uses of water include outdoor irrigation, pools, spas, fountains, 
and so on. By conscientiously rationing your water consumption (especially 
hot water), you can easily reduce it by up to 50 percent.
Use appliances more sensibly
Including your domestic water heater, around 40 percent of your power bill is 
consumed by your appliances, big and small. And just because an appliance 
is small in stature doesn’t mean it’s small in energy consumption.

110
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Understanding how much power your appliances consume is the first step 
toward recovering from the rampant disease of appliancism. You can lower 
your power bills by using your appliances more sensibly — or even better, 
by not using your appliances at all. For instance, a great way to lower your 
power bill is to set up a clothesline. My personal experience with this par-
ticular subject is illuminating. When I do energy audits, I suggest clotheslines 
and inevitably get a grimace. “What?! A clothesline?” But the vast majority of 
people who set up a clothesline and give it a try end up using it habitually, 
and it isn’t a big burden. Clothes smell better when they’re dried on a line, 
that’s a fact.
 
Don’t trade in your old appliances for energy-efficient models until the old 
unit is well past its prime. Simply upgrading to more energy-efficient machines 
doesn’t necessarily help the environment. If you buy a new refrigerator, and 
throw the old one away, you may be saving raw fuel costs but in the end, the 
new refrigerator took a lot of invested energy to manufacture and the old one 
takes a lot of energy to properly discard.
Exploit sunlight
Sunshine is free (at least until the government comes up with a way to tax it). 
And sunshine is natural and amiable, so it should be used as much as pos-
sible. In fact, most people do use sunshine, but not nearly as effectively as 
they could.
Using sunshine effectively isn’t as simple as just letting the sun shine in. 
Obviously, in the winter, you want both the sunshine and its heat in your 
home as much as possible. In the summer, you want the sun’s light but not 
the heat — two goals that are almost always at odds.
You can use sunlight to heat your home in the winter and avoid doing so in 
the summer. You can build sunrooms that increase the value of your home 
and provide increased living area at an efficient cost.
For much greater detail on this subject, check out Solar Power Your Home For 
Dummies (also authored by yours truly and published by Wiley).

111
 Chapter 6: The First Alternative-Energy Sources: Efficiency and Conservation
Use ventilation, fans, and air filters
Unless you live in a perfect climate where it’s never too hot or too cold, heat-
ing and air-conditioning make up the largest component of your power bill. 
Ultimately, what you’re buying is comfort, because you don’t actually need 
air-conditioning, and most of the time you don’t need heat. If you rely on your 
heater and your air-conditioner to keep you comfortable, then you’re missing 
a big opportunity for energy efficiency. The key to comfort is air movement.
By moving air appropriately through your home, you can achieve a much 
higher level of comfort and save money by using your HVAC system less, par-
ticularly in the summer.

▶ Evaluating the political impacts 
B
elieve it or not, energy consumption has been advantageous to 
humanity: Energy has made possible the technological advances that 
have brought humankind from the primitive to the advanced. We live longer, 
healthier lives: In the U.S., for example, life expectancy has increased 66 percent 
over the last century. We are more secure and knowledgeable about our 
world. Life is just plain better than it used to be, and this has been made 
possible by advances that took a great deal of energy. To make any kind 
of claim that energy consumption has been anything but advantageous to 
humanity completely misses the point. So what is the point? The biggest 
problem with our current energy is our reliance on fossil fuel energy sources. 
In this chapter I review the environmental consequences of relying so heavily 
on fossil fuel. Global warming may be the biggest problem facing humanity, 
but acid rain, smog, ground water contamination, and other problems are 
also evident. There is also the inescapable reality that fossil fuel sources are 
dwindling. Even if there were no environmental damage from fossil fuel 
combustion, we’re going to run out at some point. 
Environmental Primer
In 1969, Congress passed the National Environmental Protection Act, which 
was signed into law on January 1, 1970. The law was an acknowledgement 
of the importance of balancing the unimpeded growth of human population 
with its effects on the environment. For the first time since the Industrial 
Revolution began, national planning was mandated to begin including the 
problems inherent in urbanization, resource exploitation, and population 

114
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
explosion — problems that affect our environment in negative ways. For the 
first time since the Industrial Revolution began, we started looking at the big 
picture of energy consumption, taking into account the many different facets 
that come into play. 
Expansions of the initial law have been passed consistently since 1970, and 
environmentalists now have a wide range of tools for altering and influencing 
the planning process of new power plants and energy schemes. The results 
have been profound, and major successes have been achieved. For instance, 
many pollution issues like littering, polluted lakes and streams, and so on, 
have been addressed. Automobiles are much cleaner now than they were 20 
years ago, and some communities that had terrible smog problems are now 
much cleaner.
During the last few decades, there has also been a growing consensus that 
we need to increase our awareness of how pollution affects our environment. 
Since 1997, vast resources have been devoted to studying environmental 
impacts, and we now have a host of data to consult when deriving conclu-
sions. The problem becomes one of measuring environmental effects in an 
accurate manner. To understand the environmental impact, a few things 
need to be taken into account:
 
✓ The magnitude of the problem: Magnitude answers the question of how 
much impact is being caused. For example, how much pollution is being 
released via an energy process? How global is the extent of the pollution? 
 
✓ The severity of the problem: Severity attempts to answer the question, 
how serious is the impact? This involves calculating, or estimating, the 
number of people affected, the extent of the damage, and how irrevers-
ible or recoverable the effect may be. Severity analysis also addresses 
impacts to the animal and plant kingdoms, although it’s an unfortunate 
fact that humans take center stage in the drama. But that’s beginning to 
change as more species become extinct, and those that are surviving are 
dwindling. People do care about animals and plants.
 
✓ Whether the cause of the problem is a manmade or natural occur-
rence: A variety of factors impact the environment, and while a problem 
may not be manmade, humankind can still play a role in mitigating the 
damage done. A case in point is the question about what causes global 
warming, which you can read more about in the next section. Say, for 
example, that scientists discover that sunspots are the cause. While 
there’s nothing we can do about sunspots, we can take other action (like 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions) to avoid compounding an already 
existing problem.
 
Most impacts don’t result in harmful effects, and many result in a better envi-
ronment. Not all human activities are bad for the environment: consider forest 
management and river and stream damming. 

115
 Chapter 7: Understanding the Demand for Alternatives
Global Warming
The earth is surrounded by an invisible layer of insulation that regulates how 
the planet’s temperature is maintained. The insulation is comprised of differ-
ent gases — carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrogen — that trap heat. 
These gases are all natural to the earth’s atmosphere, and carbon dioxide in 
particular is a fundamental component. 
 
Carbon dioxide is a natural element. While it is true that we humans release a 
lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to our fossil fuel combustion, 
it’s not true that we’re discharging a noxious manmade compound into the air.
While some may argue the primary cause of global warming (whether we 
humans or Mother Nature is to blame), there’s little argument that global 
warming is actually occurring and that the rate of the warming is acceler-
ating. The ten warmest years on record have occurred since 1990. In fact, 
global temperatures have not been this warm for over 1,000 years. 
The central question about global warming is one of magnitude and sever-
ity (see the preceding section): How does the amount of carbon dioxide we 
release affect the severity of the global warming problem? The following sec-
tions delve into this issue.
Increasing carbon dioxide levels
We rely on greenhouse gases for our existence; they capture the sun’s heat, 
thereby maintaining a livable environment. Without greenhouse gases, the 
average world temperature would be around 0 degrees Fahrenheit, which 
would probably preclude mankind’s existence on the planet. What’s going on 
now is that greenhouse gases are building up at an unprecedented rate, and 
we know for a fact that when greenhouse gases build up, the earth’s insula-
tion increases so that temperatures rise. There is no denying this cause and 
effect. Since the year 1000 ad, the average concentration of CO2 in the atmo-
sphere spiked sharply around the year 2000. 
The most alarming aspect of the current situation is the acceleration in 
warming. In the late 1800’s, worldwide temperatures were, on average, 1.3 
degrees Fahrenheit lower than they are now. Some studies indicate that 
by the end of this century, temperatures will be, on average, three to nine 
degrees higher if the trend continues. Studies have also indicated the ocean 
levels have risen between four and eight inches over the last century. When 
the earth’s temperature rises, ice packs melt and the ocean levels rise 
because there’s simply more water. Also, when water temperatures rise, 
the volume of the water increases, so there are two effects from rising 
temperatures. These numbers are well above the averages of the previous 
century, but not unprecedented in the historical record.

116
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
In the last century, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has 
risen from 280 parts per million (ppm) to over 370 ppm now — the high-
est concentration in over 400,000 years and perhaps 20 million years. The 
International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) projected that carbon dioxide 
levels will reach between 490 and 1,260 ppm by the end of this century. This 
is 75 percent to 350 percent higher than the concentrations measured prior 
to the Industrial Revolution.
 
Carbon dioxide lifetimes are very long, so this trend is deeply troubling 
because it implies that even if we curtail our carbon dioxide emissions, 
problems will remain for a long time.
And where is all this extra carbon emissions coming from? The Energy 
Information Administration (EIA) concluded that fossil fuel combustion is 
to blame for 81 percent of human induced carbon dioxide emissions in the 
United States alone. In some foreign countries, with lax pollution control 
standards and practices, this number is even higher. Table 7-1 lists the 
carbon dioxide emissions of commonly available fossil fuels.

Understanding the impacts 
of global warming
Global warming can affect both the human and animal populations in ways 
that can severely impact our way of life. While the exact severity of the 
impact is unknown, the following sections detail what you can expect — from 
dry spells to extinctions — if global warming continues.

117
 Chapter 7: Understanding the Demand for Alternatives
Mounting violence in weather
The world has been witnessing increasingly violent weather events. Many 
people believe events such as the following are indicators of the precursors 
to the broader effects of global warming:
 
✓ Heat waves: In August 1993, Europe underwent an extreme heat wave, 
resulting in more than 35,000 deaths, particularly among the elderly, 
the young, and the infirm. In recent years, there are more deaths due to 
heat waves than the combined totals due to tornadoes, hurricanes, and 
floods. Heat induced strokes are going to become more common, as well 
as respiratory problems and heart disease.
 
✓ Hurricanes: In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and 
caused severe damage and loss of life. Meteorologists claim that severe 
weather events will become more frequent as a result of global warming. 
When huge masses of hot air collide with colder air descending from the 
north, the result is hurricanes and tornadoes. Meteorological records 
show that, in the last decade, there have been more severe hurricanes 
and tornadoes than the previous three decades combined.
 
✓ Drought: Around the world, droughts are increasing in frequency and 
severity. The United States, Africa, Spain, Chile, China, Australia, and 
other countries have experienced moderate to severe droughts within 
the last couple of years. While all droughts bring some degree of hard-
ship, in less developed countries, they result in untold human suffering 
as water supplies dry up and food supplies disappear.
For the entire year of 2002, total damage from weather-related events world-
wide exceeded $53 billion. In the United States, catastrophic weather related 
events have increased fivefold since 1970. There are no indications that these 
trends will decline, and in fact the evidence points to the opposite. Weather 
changes due to global warming are probably going to be as varied as they are 
widespread. 
In addition, regional effects will be magnified: Drought regions can expect 
more severe and longer lasting dry spells. Wildfires will become more 
common, despite management efforts to control them. Flood-prone regions — 
where approximately 46 million people live — will be hit hardest because of 
the direct (the damage by the flooding) and indirect (the proliferation of 
diseases such as malaria and West Nile virus) effects.
Endangering wildlife
The animal kingdom will be hardest hit because they are much more exposed 
to environmental changes than are humans, who can control their environ-
ment. Mass extinctions will result from global warming, and biological breed-
ing cycles will be altered, meaning reproduction will be altered.

118
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Shifting agricultural centers
The silver-lining folks argue that global warming will alter crop growing and 
vegetation in such a way to increase production. But studies have indicated 
that a two-degree increase in temperature will leave plants drier and less 
viable, so the net aggregate production levels may actually decrease. At the 
very least, the agricultural centers will be geographically shifted, and this 
will result in massive relocations of farmers and agricultural workers to more 
northern climates that are now conducive to growing crops on large scales. 
This would reverse the southward bound population trend of the last few 
decades (which has, interestingly, been enabled by air-conditioning energy 
consumption). To be fair, it may be true that global warming results in more 
agricultural output because there will be more regions with weather condu-
cive to growing different types of crops. But that helps humans, not the natu-
ral balance.
Melting ice shelves and glaciers
The recent phenomenon of melting icebergs and glaciers has been attributed 
to global warming. The U.S. Glacier National Park has seen a third of its gla-
ciers disappear since 1850. Studies project that South America will see an 80 
percent reduction of its glaciers in the next 15 years. Huge ice shelves broke 
completely free of Antarctica between 1995 and 2000. As ice melts, sea levels 
rise and coastal communities become displaced and the shorelines severely 
altered — an effect that tends to spread far inward as ecosystems inland 
from coastlines are very sensitive to the coastline conditions.
Rising sea levels
As the ice melts, sea levels rise due to the huge increase in oceanic water, 
plus the added effect of expanding water molecules due to the temperature 
increase. It only takes a small rise in sea levels before fresh water supplies 
become contaminated with salts and other sediments. This means water sup-
plies for humans will dwindle, and in the face of increasing populations will 
result in severe political and social hardships.
Combating global warming
Most scientists who study global warming believe that it is humankind’s 
greatest threat in history and is due to our use of fossil fuel. Despite all the 
dire warnings, and in the face of compelling evidence, many people believe 
that a wait and see attitude is warranted. The problem with this is that by the 
time the concrete evidence that they seek is available, it may be too late.
So the question is this: What do we do, as a society, about global warming? 
The most sensible answer is to continue studying and measuring the data, 
and to promote environmentally responsible policies.

119
 Chapter 7: Understanding the Demand for Alternatives
Efforts to combat global warming have been initiated on a worldwide basis, 
with meager results. The international community drafted the Kyoto Protocol 
in 1997 and more than 170 countries signed on. Industrial nations agreed to 
cut their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels, with a target date between 
2008 and 2012. Developing countries were “encouraged” to cut their green-
house gas emissions. Very few nations have met their goals. And in 2001, the 
U.S rejected the treaty, citing that its provisions put an inequitable burden on 
the U.S. economy. 
Germany mandated a carbon tax on fossil fuels which accounts for around 
11 cents per gallon of gasoline. German energy consumption is very low, per 
capita, and this is a direct result of their governmental regulations. Carbon 
sequestration, the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide in old 
mines, is being pursued by the United States, Canada, Norway, and a host 
of other nations. Currently, however, the technologies are expensive and 
immature.
Ultimately, however, the real solution to global warming and carbon dioxide 
emissions is alternative energy.
Other Pollution Problems
Global warming gets all the buzz these days, but there are other environmen-
tal problems with fossil fuel emissions — ones that are much more direct and 
less subject to argument.
Smog
The problem of metropolitan air quality degradation has been well docu-
mented. The most common air pollution components are sulfur dioxide 
(SO2), suspended particulate matter (SPM), lead (Pb), carbon monoxide (CO), 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), volatile organic compounds (VOC), ozone (O3), and of 
course carbon dioxide (CO2).
Smog is a reddish brown haze that settles over cities and valleys. It is the 
most visible manifestation of our pollution and in some regions serves as a 
visible, daily reminder that it’s time to make some serious changes.
There is no predicting how smog may build up from day to day, or from 
month to month. Upper elevations where wind speeds are higher tend to 
have less smog, whereas valley bound cities get the worst of it because smog 
settles in and only grows worse. Different types of smog appear in different 
areas:

120
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
 
✓ Sulfurous smog appears in cold weather, like London and New York. 
Sulfur dioxides and particulates from electrical generation are the main 
causes. 
 
✓ Photochemical smog is found in cities such as Los Angeles and Mexico 
City, and is far more common when it’s warm and still. The main chemi-
cal constituent in photochemical smog is ozone (O3), which is emitted 
by automobiles and trucks and electrical utilities as well as industrial 
manufacturing and in particular, oil refineries.
For the most part, smog is a local problem, but there is evidence that China’s 
rampant smog is crossing the ocean to the United States, so smog is becom-
ing a global phenomenon.
The pollution sources responsible for smog are stationary electric power 
plants and vehicular transportation. The two most important contaminants 
from motor vehicles that form smog are nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile 
organic compounds (VOC). But volatile organic compounds come from many 
sources other than motor vehicles, many of these sources being natural parts 
of the environment. The formation of nitrogen oxides, on the other hand, 
results mainly from high-temperature combustion of fossil fuels. It is the 
nitrogen oxides that are the main controllable culprit in urban air pollution, 
and so these are being studied the most.
The density of smog in urban areas peaked in the year 1970, after which strin-
gent air quality standards were implemented by the Federal Government. In 
particular, catalytic converters were required on all new cars. In California, 
even more stringent measures were adopted, and new cars sold in California 
include even better air quality technologies (California cars also cost more, 
and it is difficult to import cars from other parts of the country into California 
because they don’t pass the state requirements). This demonstrates that gov-
ernmental regulation can and does work, when implemented properly and 
with stringent oversight and enforcement.
Weather effects
Smog-laden skies affect the way heat is trapped in the atmosphere and as 
a result affect weather patterns. Rainfall shifts to different areas, and the 
natural ecosystem is altered. This affects wildlife and agriculture. Smog also 
weakens plants’ immune systems, making them more susceptible to diseases 
and pests.
Health effects
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists the following 
health dangers from hazardous air pollutants (HAP) in smog:
 
✓ Neurological disorders
 
✓ Cardiovascular disorders such as heart attack and stroke

121
 Chapter 7: Understanding the Demand for Alternatives
 
✓ Respiratory effects
 
✓ Liver disorders
 
✓ Kidney disorders
 
✓ Immune system deficiencies
 
✓ Reproductive deficiencies resulting in child development issues
 
✓ More than half of the HAPs cause cancer
Economic effects
Economically, smog and related air pollution issues cost a tremendous 
amount of money to a community. It is estimated that if Los Angeles would 
reduce its air pollution by 20 percent, it would save $9.8 billion per year in 
health and related costs.
Acid rain
Rainwater is critical to the earth’s ecosystem. All living creatures rely on a 
consistent, clean supply of water. In the process of combusting fossil fuels, 
toxins are released into the atmosphere which react with water molecules to 
form acidic compounds. When these compounds come down in the form of 
rain, environmental havoc ensues. It’s called acid rain.
In the natural state, rainwater reacts with carbon dioxide, but when human 
released levels of carbon dioxide increase, the process is accelerated and the 
natural pH balance of the ecosystem is altered. Unfortunately, a small altera-
tion can cause big problems in the natural balance of our ecosystem.
Different areas of the country are affected in unique ways. The Midwest, 
for example, has a slightly alkaline soil that tends to neutralize acid rain, 
so this region is affected relatively lightly. In New England the effects are 
pronounced because the naturally acidic foundation tends to become aggra-
vated by acid rain. Deciduous trees falter, pine trees whither, and overall 
agricultural productivity suffers. Certain mountainous regions in the Eastern 
U.S. have suffered the worst effects. Fish species are disappearing and those 
that remain are foundering. Certain varieties of trees, like the sugar maple, 
are disappearing because they can’t handle the slight change in pH level.
Despite the local impact, global winds shift the acidic rainwater thousands of 
miles, so the problem is worldwide, not just local. In Canada, for example, a 
tremendous number of lakes are feeling the effects of acid rain. 
Scientists have been monitoring the affects of acid rain since the 1970s, and 
the problem is getting worse each year. Acids have spread throughout the 
entire country, and even if the level of acid is reduced, the trend will continue 
because it takes Mother Nature decades to wipe the pH slate clean.

122
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
Acid rain can also affect humans directly. The acidic components are inhaled 
into the lungs and natural functions are altered in the process. Plus, acidic 
elements in soil and groundwater are ingested by humans and the resulting 
digestive problems can be pronounced. Declining bacterial populations in 
sewer systems are an issue because certain types of bacteria are necessary 
in the process of breaking down sewage into non-toxic elements. And finally, 
acid rain causes deterioration of buildings over time. Acid is very corrosive, 
and despite the fact that acid rain has very little acid, it’s a persistent, consis-
tent effect that accelerates the natural deterioration process.
All is not lost; improvements have been measured in acid rain levels, and the 
effects caused by acid rain. This goes to show that governmental inspired 
environmental programs can and do work, when implemented properly. Acid 
rain emission standards have improved the pH level of rain in many parts of 
the world. Yet there’s a long way to go in the battle.
Increasing Demand and 
Dwindling Supplies
The need for alternative energy sources arises from two realities: increasing 
pollution (see the preceding two sections) and dwindling supplies of fossil 
fuels. Even if fossil fuel pollution levels could be brought under control (a 
dubious proposition in light of the developing world’s reluctance to use pol-
lution mitigation technologies), dwindling supplies will bring about a whole 
host of problems that could prove to be even more intractable than pollution 
effects.
In Chapter 4, I describe the ever increasing demand for fossil fuels world-
wide, and in particular in the United States. Combine this with the fact that 
reserves of fossil fuels are dwindling, and you can see that we’re simply going 
to run out of supplies, which will result in political havoc the world over, as 
countries scramble to meet their basic needs.
Alternative energy may not be able to completely offset the demand for fossil 
fuel energy sources, but it can put a very large dent in it. And as the use of 
alternatives grows, new technologies will come on line, displacing old tech-
nologies. As the trend grows, it will feed on itself and the growth will only 
accelerate. It remains to kick the alternative machinery into gear.

123
 Chapter 7: Understanding the Demand for Alternatives
Political Movements and 
Political Ramifications 
Inevitably, the solution to our fossil fuel problem will be driven by politics. 
Politics is a big part of the fossil fuel problem because government subsi-
dizes the consumption of inexpensive fossil fuels. To counteract this promo-
tion of carbon-based energy sources, political movements have arisen with 
the purpose of changing environmental policy, both statewide and national. 
Ultimately, it will be new technologies that change the face of our energy con-
sumption patterns, but these new technologies are going to rely on political 
support structures.
The greens
Concern for the environment has grown into a formidable political force. The 
rise of green politics originated in the 1960s and 1970s. During that period, 
the Green Party became a fundamental force in Western European politics. In 
the U.S. there is no official green party, but there is a powerful green move-
ment and it’s become very influential in national politics. The green agenda 
seeks to reform government through environmental activism.
The greens have championed the development of alternative energy tech-
nologies. Green economics strives to include the true cost of energy sources 
in the dollar price that is paid for those energy sources. The need to include 
environmental costs is stressed, and this results in higher fossil fuel costs 
which tends to decrease demand. Hidden costs should be uncovered, and 
borne by those who use fossil fuels. Zero and low emission alternatives, in 
this paradigm, are actually less expensive than fossil fuels, and these will pro-
mote a cleaner environment that benefits mankind.
The New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) was crafted by the green movement 
to express their fundamental viewpoints:
 
✓ Human beings are but one species among the many that are indepen-
dently involved in the biotic communities that shape our social life.
 
✓ Intricate linkages of cause and effect and feedback in the web of nature 
produce many unintended consequences from purposive human action.
 
✓ The world is finite, so there are potent physical and biological limits 
constraining economic growth, social progress, and other societal 
phenomenon.

124
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
The basic idea is this: Movement toward a new view of environmental justice 
should not be based on the consumer market. Instead, the real and direct 
cost of green energy should reflect the true cost for both the raw sources of 
energy, and the cost to the environment. When this is achieved, green energy 
will actually cost less than fossil fuels, and so the formidable power of the 
market will develop green alternatives. So the point is not to penalize fossil 
fuels unfairly, but to develop a fair and balanced accounting system.
Practical political advantages 
of alternative energy
Despite all the benefits that fossil fuel use has made possible, relying so heav-
ily on carbon-based energy sources has put the U.S. in a rather precarious 
position today. We have to rely on not-always-friendly foreign governments 
for our fuel supply. We are vulnerable to price fluctuations due to geopoliti-
cal instability, environmental catastrophes, and other things beyond our 
control. And we are altering the environment in profound and often negative 
ways. All these things threaten our national security and our economic stability. 
Pursuing alternative energy sources, therefore, has some very practical 
advantages:
 
✓ Alternatives free the U.S. from interference by foreign powers that 
hold the world’s largest fossil fuel reserves. There is no telling how 
much it costs the U.S. both in terms of dollars and moral credibility 
when we order our political and military structures around the basic 
need of ensuring the consistent supply of foreign oil. Mideast politics 
has been incredibly volatile for the last several generations, and oil 
plays a major role in the equation. By using alternatives, renewables, 
and sustainables, the U.S. can wean itself from the foreign oil trap.
 
✓ Alternatives are generally “local” energy sources. When we rely too 
heavily on huge centralized energy generators (such as coal) our soci-
ety becomes vulnerable to terrorism, catastrophic weather events, and 
economic perturbations like raw fuel supply disruptions. The only way a 
solar PV generator can be disrupted is if sunshine disappears. Same with 
wind and hydropower, not to mention biomass.
 
✓ Alternatives are, in general, far more environmentally friendly than 
the fossil fuel mainstays. The health costs of the various fossil fuel alter-
ations of the natural environment are well documented. Health issues 
are very real, and costly in both dollar terms and quality of life.
 
✓ The price of alternatives much better reflects the true, or real price, of 
energy. Our current energy policies hide the true cost of fossil fuels, and 
make them far cheaper than they really are. If one is a true believer in 
the power of the marketplace, alternative energy is the clear winner.

125
 Chapter 7: Understanding the Demand for Alternatives
 
✓ Alternative energy is available to one and all. Huge power plants take 
a tremendous amount of capital and decision making. Alternatives, on 
the other hand, can be pursued by everybody, on a basic level. The easi-
est way to pursue alternative energy is to place solar landscaping lights, 
which you can find for less than $5 at most hardware stores, in your 
yard. 
A Final Thought on Fossil Fuel Use
Humans are invincible — we have our big screen TVs, our comfortable 
homes, and cushy jobs. This is what we’ve been striving toward for genera-
tions, and we’ve succeeded. All on the back of inexpensive energy, and in 
particular, inexpensive fossil fuels.
But for too long we’ve allowed ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of 
security. We have experienced natural gas and oil shortages, economic 
roller coasters due to price fluctuations, political and even military conflicts 
resulting from oil shortages, power blackouts and shortages, and declining 
reserves of new fuel deposits. We’ve experienced groundwater contamina-
tion, deteriorating ecosystems, agricultural decline in both quantity and qual-
ity, acid rain, smog, strange weather patterns. It’s clear that we’re affecting 
the earth in ways that we never even imagined only a decade ago. But we 
don’t heed the warning signs because market forces tend to even things out, 
and we’re only too willing to forget a crisis once it’s passed. 
In 1992, over 1,600 scientists came to this conclusion: “Warning to Humanity; 
Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course . . . that may so 
alter the natural world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that 
we know.”
It’s hard to argue with this conclusion, although some people do.
The fundamental problem is that most of us are not tuned in to how energy 
is produced or used. We take energy for granted. Fill up the car at the corner 
station, pay the utility bill, forget the rest of it. We haven’t really had to pay 
much for energy, and the real price has been consistently declining so each 
year we’re less and less inclined to pay much attention. 
The challenges we face are symbolic of an even deeper problem: We’ve 
become unplugged from our fundamental roots. We’ve ignored Mother 
Nature and abused her to the point where she wants a divorce. We’ve devel-
oped a worldview that places humanity front and center as the only species 
that really matters (the rest you can go see in a zoo). Even in writing this 
chapter, I spent most of my time explaining how humans are affected by the 
impacts of fossil fuel use. 

126
Part II: Digging Deeper into the Current State of Affairs 
What we’re most concerned with is the effects that environmental hazards 
have on humans, how they affect our own health. Extinction is a remote con-
cept, despite the fact that it’s occurring at an alarming rate the world over, 
but we tell ourselves things like, “Well, the dinosaurs went extinct and that 
had nothing to do with us.” 
We’ve lost our way. We’ve forgotten that we’re a part of a huge, beautiful 
system not of our own making. We’ve become enamored of the concept 
that we’re the masters, and because we’re so good at making things, we’ve 
decided that we’re the inventors of life on the planet earth.
It’s time we wised up. 
We rely on the earth’s natural cleansing systems. We rely on the earth for 
everything that makes us tick and tock. When we alter the earth’s ecosystem, 
we are altering humanity in the process. 
But all is not lost, and it’s certainly not too late to change course. Above 
all else, we humans have shown ourselves to be exceptionally creative and 
imaginative when it comes to transcending problems thrown our way. Our 
inventions and our acquisitiveness combine with our natural love of life to 
produce magnificent wealth and experience. So we’ll figure out how to solve 
this energy problem we’re immersed in. We all make our own little contribu-
tions, and they add up and grow and become infectious and at some point 
society as a whole will end up altered for the better. My writing this book, 
and your buying it and reading it, attest to the fact that people do care.

▶ Understanding nuclear fission and nuclear fusion
▶ Adding up the economics of nuclear power
T
he sun, which is the source of all energy on the planet earth, is a huge 
nuclear reactor. Natural nuclear reactors existed right here on the earth 
some 2 billion years ago and lasted for over 500,000 years before dying out. 
The entire universe is filled with stars, and each is a nuclear reactor. If all the 
energy on the planet earth comes from the sun, then all the energy on the 
planet earth comes from nuclear reactors. Sounds simple, but the story gets 
a lot more complex when we try to build manmade nuclear reactors.
Nuclear power is very clean, at least in terms of carbon dioxide emission, 
which is the cause of global warming. The fuel is relatively inexpensive as 
well, in terms of the amount of useable, or ordered, energy that it can yield 
per given weight. Yet nuclear remains controversial, although the underlying 
technologies are sound and well proven. It is undergoing a resurgence, how-
ever. In the coming decades, the number of nuclear power plants in opera-
tion is expected to increase by 25 percent or more.
In this chapter I describe nuclear technology, in layman’s terms, and I 
describe the problems with nuclear power. While the technology is sound, 
there is still a lot of well-founded resistance. Many books do not include 
nuclear power as an alternative energy source, but I choose to because I 
consider alternative energy anything other than fossil fuel. This definition is 
predicated on the fact that it’s fossil fuels that are causing the world so much 
harm. In relation, nuclear’s problems are solvable, and manageable.

130
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Getting to Where We Are Now
Upon its inception, nuclear power was advertised as the energy source “too 
cheap to meter.” The original premise was that nuclear energy would be so 
inexpensive to create and dispense that it wouldn’t even be worth the utility 
company’s time to charge for it. In this scenario, the utilities would be run 
by the government, at taxpayers’ expense, to provide all the electrical power 
needs of the country, indefinitely. Wouldn’t that be great?
For two decades, nuclear mania spread across the world, but then it stalled 
due to engineering problems and system failures that resulted in panics and 
political confrontations, sometimes violent.
Nuclear power: The early years
During World War II, the United States launched the Manhattan project, 
which produced the first atomic bombs. With technological advancements 
based on this fundamental research, in December 1942 the first nuclear reac-
tor was tested in an abandoned handball court at the University of Chicago. 
This test proved the viability of large scale nuclear power reactors for utility 
scale use, and the race was on.
In 1946, Congress created the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and char-
tered it to regulate the development of large scale nuclear power for use on a 
commercial basis. In 1951 an experimental reactor in Idaho produced enough 
power to prove that nuclear technology is sound enough for practical and 
widespread applications.
Protests and accidents 
in the ’60s and ’70s
Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s there was a lot of contention over the 
safety of nuclear power plants for commercial use. Court cases were filed and 
delays were experienced, and some reactors that had already been started 
were delayed. In 1971, for example, the Calvert Cliffs Coordinating Committee 
(CCCC) won a lawsuit against the Atomic Energy Agency (AEA) and a reac-
tor scheduled to be built in Maryland was delayed for a number of years. 
Construction of subsequent plants around the world were delayed or can-
celled, as a result. 

131
 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
In Germany, an international movement to halt atomic energy crystallized, 
and the movement spilled over into many other countries, particularly in 
Europe. Some of the protests erupted in open violence. At Brokdorf in 1981, 
100,000 demonstrators confronted 10,000 police at a nuclear building con-
struction site. The demonstrators were armed with gasoline bombs, sticks, 
stones, and slingshots, and 21 policemen were injured. There is no denying 
that the word “nuclear” elicits strong sentiments, rightly or wrongly.
Plant orders peaked in 1974 then fell off sharply after 1974 when energy-
conservation sentiments grew as a result of the Arab oil embargo. The feel-
ing was that the world could be saved by conservation and efficiency alone, 
although that hasn’t proven true in any sense of the word (as I explain in 
Chapter 3). The anti-nuclear forces sought not just to stop nuclear power, but 
to completely eliminate it as an option.
Political and environmentalist support for nuclear took two huge hits due to 
a couple of widely publicized nuclear reactor accidents: 
 
✓ Three Mile Island: In 1979, at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, an 
enclosed reactor failed when internal temperatures exceeded 2,750 
degrees Celsius. This could have resulted in a terrible explosion, but 
did not. The containment building, which was built specifically for such 
mishaps, prevented any immediate deaths, and contained the radiation 
leakage to minimal proportions. Studies indicated, however, that the 
cancer rate increased slightly amongst the nearby population and public 
fear was stoked. 
 
✓ Chernobyl: In 1986, in Chernobyl, Russia, a nuclear reactor with sub-
standard engineering and a poorly designed containment structure 
melted down and released radioactivity. The accident exposed thou-
sands of people to high levels of radiation, particularly during the 
cleanup (we have a special job for you, comrade!). A 300-square-mile 
area around the site was evacuated, and there were 31 immediate 
deaths, with 500 more people hospitalized for various reasons. It is esti-
mated that between 6,000 and 24,000 people died from cancer since the 
accident.
Since these accidents, support for nuclear energy has waned considerably. 
The last nuclear plant built in the U.S., for example, was finished in 1979, the 
same year as the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant disaster. The valve 
was shut off completely, for better or worse.

132
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
The situation today
In November of 2007, NRG Energy, in Princeton, New Jersey, became the first 
company to file for a license to build a new nuclear plant since the 1970s. 
A dozen more applications have subsequently been filed, and more are 
expected. 
This resurgence is a direct result of global warming fears, and the fact that 
nuclear power plants do not discharge greenhouse gases. As I explain in 
Chapter 18, with the development of the electric car, worldwide demand 
for electricity from the grid is expected to surge, and nuclear provides the 
cleanest option (simply displacing internal combustion engines with electric 
motors does not solve the greenhouse gas crisis, it merely moves the burden 
onto electrical power plants, most of which are coal-fired).
At present, nuclear power plants provide around 21 percent of U.S. electri-
cal energy. France, which has promoted and subsidized nuclear for decades, 
derives over 75 percent of its energy from nuclear, and there have been 
no major accidents or environmental mishaps. Japan gets 24 percent of its 
electrical energy from nuclear, while Germany made the decision in 2000 to 
phase out of nuclear entirely (this may have more to do with the politics in 
Germany, post World War II, than any pragmatic analysis of nuclear power’s 
role in a diversified energy economy). Table 8-1 shows the nuclear power cur-
rent capacities of different countries.

 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
The Fundamentals of Nuclear Power
The possibility of nuclear energy of the type we use today in power plants 
was illuminated by Einstein’s famous equation:
E = mc2
where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light (around 3×108 
meters per second). 
To put this into perspective, this equation says that an apple has enough 
mass to run New York City’s electrical needs for an entire month. So there is 
considerable energy potential in nuclear power, and the amount of raw fuel 
consumed is minimal by fossil fuel standards. It does sound great in theory, 
and it’s easy to see why early enthusiasts championed nuclear power to such 
an extent (refer to the earlier section, “Getting to Where We Are Now”). 
There are two distinct types of nuclear energy: fusion and fission. When 
atomic nuclei undergo either fusion or fission, it is the binding energies that 
provide the useable power output. In fusion, atoms are combined, or fused. 
In fission, atoms are dissociated. In both cases, the basic physics exploits 
Einstein’s famous equation. It may seem like magic, but when nuclear reac-
tions occur, mass combines to equal less mass, and the difference is con-
verted into radiation energy. 
 
The simplistic physics maxim that mass is conserved is not quite correct. 
But the first law of thermodynamics is correct: Energy can neither be created 
nor destroyed. According to Einstein’s equation, mass is just another form of 
energy. So in a nuclear reaction, it is energy that is conserved.
Atoms
All matter is made up of very dense particles called electrons, protons, and 
neutrons (these, in turn, are made up of even more fundamental particles 
called quarks and gluons and all sorts of other strange things). The sub-
atomic particles move incredibly fast and electrons are in motion most of the 
time around the nucleus, which is made up of the protons and neutrons, as 
Figure 8-1 shows. 

134
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
Figure 8-1:

Bunched protons 
and neutrons
(nucleus)
Electrons
The number of protons and neutrons defines the properties of the element, 
and is called the nucleus. Protons have a positive charge, neutrons have 
no charge, and electrons have negative charge. In most atoms, the number 
of protons, neutrons, and electrons are equal, and the net charge is zero 
because the positive charges balance out the negative charges; however, it’s 
not uncommon for an atom to contain different numbers of particles.
The number of protons determines the atomic number of the atom, and this 
gives the element its fundamental identity. The simplest element is hydro-
gen, with one proton in the nucleus. Helium has two protons and lithium has 
three. The periodic table of the elements (remember from Chemistry 101?) 
lists all the known elements, with increasing atomic number. Elements with 
high atomic numbers are more dense than the simpler elements.
Nuclear binding energy is the “glue” that holds protons and neutrons together, 
forming a nucleus. Nuclear binding energy implies that a force is holding 
nuclei together, for most nuclei consist of a number of protons, each with 
a positive charge, and like charges repel. In other words, two protons repel 
each other with a considerable vigor, so the fact that protons are found 
bound together suggests that a force much stronger than electrical repulsion 
“binds” nuclei. The force must:
 
✓ Be strong enough to overcome the repulsion forces of the charged 
particles.
 
✓ Be extremely short in range because once nuclei particles are separated, 
they do not rebind spontaneously.
Isotopes
Elements can have different versions characterized by slight changes in the 
composition of the nucleus; the different versions are called isotopes, and 
despite the fact that the differences are minor, the way isotopes react with 
other elements can be major. Isotopes occur when the number of protons 
does not match the number of neutrons. All elements have at least two 

135
 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
isotopes, and some have dozens. Each of the isotopes will react differently, 
and scientists can control the composition of atoms in order to exploit the 
different reaction potentials.
Elements all have a particular isotope that’s found in its natural state on the 
planet earth. Some isotopes are very stable and retain their form over long 
periods of time. Others tend to decay into more basic, stable forms, or they 
decay into completely different atoms. When nuclei decay spontaneously 
(some nuclei are right on the brink of changing into a different form and a 
tiny tweak of energy will make them tumble over the edge while other nuclei 
are relatively distant from changing into other forms), they are referred to as 
unstable. The decay is always accompanied by some kind of energy release, 
or absorption. When an unstable nucleus decays, the energy is called radio-
activity, or radiation, and this is of much concern in nuclear power because 
radioactivity can be very hazardous (I get into this in more detail in a subse-
quent section).
Uranium is the element used in nuclear reactors, and all known isotopes are 
unstable. The rate of decay varies from one element to another, and some 
elements can take thousands of years to decay, but decay they will.
Atomic weight
By definition, the atomic weight of an element is equal to the sum of the 
number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Carbon, which is a very 
common atom in the earth’s ecosystem, has an atomic weight of 12, mean-
ing the nucleus is composed of six protons and six neutrons. This particular 
version of carbon is called carbon-12, or C-12. Some carbon atoms, however, 
contain eight neutrons in the nucleus instead of six, and the total protons 
plus neutrons equals fourteen. These atoms are called C-14.
Uranium exists as either U-234 or U-235 (with atomic weights of 234 and 235, 
respectively). The most common form of uranium, however, is U-238. Nuclear 
power plants use U-235 almost exclusively because it’s easy to induce con-
trolled decay and thereby create a consistent, steady stream of output 
energy in the form of heat radiation.
Ions
If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, it’s called an ion, and 
there is a net electrical charge. When there are more electrons than protons, 
the net charge is negative; more protons than electrons results in a positive 
net charge. It’s still the same fundamental element, but its properties become 
much different. In particular, an ion is capable of electrical interactions that 
may be exploited to create electrical flow. When a substance, whether solid, 

136
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
liquid, or gas, contains mostly ions, it is said to be ionized, and electrical flow 
is a natural consequence of the physics.
 
Elements can be isotopes and ions at the same time, and this creates even 
more opportunity to induce energy flow and creation.
Nuclear Power Today: Fission
I spent eight years studying physics, and I will have to admit that nuclear 
physics is a tough nut to crack. But don’t worry; you can understand some 
basic premises, and in the process you’ll know what makes nuclear reac-
tors tick and why they tick so loudly. Forge on, and it will be worth the effort 
because nuclear power, while not magic, is awe inspiring. There’s an inherent 
beauty in the atomic world. In the following sections I describe how nuclear 
reactors work and some of the problems that are inescapable. Getting reac-
tors to work is not what’s causing so much controversy; it’s the solution to 
the problems.
How nuclear reactors work
At the core of a nuclear reactor are U-235 atoms, and these are bombarded 
by high speed neutrons. When an atom of U-235 is struck by a neutron, the 
following happens:
 
1. The atom instantly splits into two separate nuclei, each lighter than 
the original. 
 
2. Neutrons are emitted, along with gamma rays, which are extremely 
energetic photons that can penetrate most substances without hin-
drance, and heat energy is produced.
 
 Heat energy is what we are seeking in a controlled nuclear reaction in 
an electrical power plant. As heat energy is released, the uranium itself 
heats up. 
 
3. When one of the emitted neutrons from the original nuclear reac-
tion strikes another uranium atom, the new uranium nucleus splits, 
thereby releasing even more energy, and creating new atoms as a 
byproduct.
 
4. A chain reaction occurs when enough neutrons are being emitted by 
the fission to continue inducing new nucleus decays on a steady basis. 

137
 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
As the chain reaction continues, uranium gets used up and the chain reaction 
begins to die out. At some point, there are not enough new neutrons being 
emitted to keep the reaction going. So there is a need to constantly keep feed-
ing in new uranium material in order to create the consistent, steady flow of 
energy that is desired from a nuclear reactor. There is also a need to remove 
the decayed byproducts, and this can be a real problem. The decayed 
byproducts are called spent nuclear fuel.
One of three states are feasible when a mass of uranium is subjected to con-
trolled neutron bombardment:
 
✓ Subcritical state occurs when the reaction dies down because there are 
not enough new neutrons being created as uranium atoms undergo fis-
sion to continue inducing new reactions. The process simply dies out 
and eventually stops.
 
✓ Critical state occurs when the reaction is self sustaining, meaning that 
just enough new neutrons are not only being created, but finding new 
uranium atoms to strike and induce another fission event. This is the 
goal of nuclear reactors, and a delicate balance is achieved in the core of 
the reactor that maintains the critical state.
 
✓ Supercritical state occurs when the reaction increases to the point 
where so much heat energy is being created that the uranium core 
melts. This is very dangerous, and is the classic nightmare of nuclear 
energy opponents. It’s referred to as “meltdown,” and is the subject of 
popular movies and science fiction novels.
A single pound of enriched uranium (not an easy pound to get, considering 
all the enrichment needed) yields around 33 billion Btus of energy. However, 
the process is not particularly efficient, so to give an idea of the practical 
output of nuclear power, one pound of uranium is equivalent to around 
3,300 gallons of gasoline, 23 tons of coal, or around 134,000 kWh of electrical 
power. That’s a lot of energy packed into a small package.
Radioactive decay
Radioactive decay is a spontaneous disintegration of a nucleus which 
releases different forms of energy. The process is described by
A decays into B and b
where A is the radioactive nucleus, B is the resulting nuclide, and b is emitted 
radiation.

138
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
The rate of decay of a substance is important because it describes the rela-
tive safety of the substance. When radioactive decays are fast, the process is 
over quickly. When radioactive decay takes a long time to exhaust, the mate-
rial is unsafe for thousands of years.
There are four types of radiation in the nuclear processes that we use for 
commercial applications: alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron.
 
✓ Alpha: Low level alpha particles travel only a few inches in air before 
dying out. They are incapable of penetrating a sheet of paper, or human 
skin, so the risk is minimal.
 
✓ Beta: Beta particles, or electrons, are significantly more penetrating, 
and can affect the outer layers of human skin, as well as internal organs. 
However, they can only travel a few feet before combining with natural 
elements at which point they become harmless.
 
✓ Gamma: Gamma rays are highly destructive to biological systems. They 
travel at the speed of light, and are highly penetrating since they have 
such high energy levels. Dense lead is used to prevent the travel of 
gamma rays (which are similar in nature to X-rays).
 
✓ Neutron: Neutron radiation poses very little threat to living organisms 
because it occurs at the core of nuclear reactors, and quickly dies out 
due to absorption by the nuclear process. Containment is easy enough.
 
All living creatures are constantly exposed to radiation in low levels. It’s a 
fact of our natural environment. Many of the earth’s materials release forms 
of radiation, and in fact the earth’s ecosystem relies on certain radiation pro-
cesses to function normally. Without naturally occurring radiation, the world 
would be a far different place.
Americans are naturally exposed to over 200 mrem (millirems) of radiation 
per year. In some parts of the world that number is much higher. In Ramsar, 
Iran, natural radium in the ground exposes nearby residents to over 26,000 
mrem per year, and there is no record of increased cancer rates there. 
Radiation levels near nuclear sites never exceed the 400 mrem. This is a real 
problem for nuclear power opponents who claim that radiation will cause 
increased disease and sickness near power plants. The record simply doesn’t 
bear this out, and since natural levels are so high in some areas (without dire 
consequences), the paranoia is unjustified. 
Radiation is also emitted by microwave ovens and X-ray machines, and 
people are hardly afraid of these manmade sources (well, some people are). 
All forms of radiation kill cells in a living organism, not just the types that 
are emitted from nuclear reactors. But biological entities continually fight 
off radiation sources, most of the time very successfully. In fact, our immune 
systems are strengthened by the low level battles fought against naturally 
occurring radiation. It’s like exercise — it creates strong muscles.

139
 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
However, when doses of radiation become inordinately large, there are 
a number of system failures that can result in death and certain types of 
cancer. Too much goes way too far. The greatest health problems occur 
when radiation is ingested via food, water, or air. When too many cells are 
damaged in too short a time, individual organs may shut down entirely, or 
the complete system may simply decide to give up the ghost.
Nuclear waste
Nuclear waste is a problem, there’s no denying that. But it can be safely 
managed, and it has been. In American reactors, the nuclear fuel rods need 
to be replaced every 18 months. When they are removed, they contain large 
amounts of radioactive fission products and they’re still hot enough that 
they need to be cooled in water. As time progresses, the radioactivity levels 
decrease, and the heat also decreases. It’s the nature of all nuclear waste that 
as time goes by, it becomes less dangerous. The question is what to do with 
the waste as it grows progressively weaker.
 
This has been a subject studied intensely for over 50 years now. The amount 
of nuclear fuel consumed in a reactor is termed burnup and is expressed in 
units of megawatts-days per metric tons (MWd/Mt). For an average 1000 MWd 
reactor containing 100 Mt of fuel, operating at around 33 percent conver-
sion efficiency of thermal to electric, burnup is around 33,000 MWd/Mt. The 
burnup would consume 3.3 Mt (metric tons) of uranium fuel, or around 3 
percent of the fuel in the reactor core. The spent fuel would contain 97 Mt of 
processed nuclear fuel, along with 12 kg of fissionable plutonium, and 3.3 Mt 
of high energy radioactive waste. This is an obvious problem.
There are basically three options with regard to disposing of the spent fuel:
 
✓ Keep it in special storage chambers at the nuclear reactor sites. This 
creates local hazards and makes security a prime concern at the sites. 
In the United States, this is standard procedure because environmental-
ists have stymied all efforts to transport the material to a central waste 
site (their concern is that in transit, an accident may occur which spills 
nuclear waste).
 
✓ Store it in “temporary” disposal sites, in New Mexico and Nevada 
(such as Yucca Mountain). This makes the most technical sense, but 
there is considerable political resistance so plans have been postponed. 
Ultimately, this is going to happen, however, since there simply isn’t a 
better solution.
 
✓ Reprocess it to extract new, recycled fuels. More than 95 percent of 
the material in a spent fuel rod can be recycled for energy and medical 
isotopes. In much of the world, this is done routinely, but in the U.S. this 
solution was halted for political reasons. 

140
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
In most of the rest of the world (other than the United States) reprocessing 
extracts useable uranium and plutonium from the waste materials. As a con-
sequence, the remaining materials are very weak, and storage is a relatively 
easy matter. By 2040, for example, England will have just 70,000 cubic feet of 
this weakened waste material. This is the volume of a cube with sides only 
42 feet. The British government has determined that “geological disposal” 
(burial deep beneath the ground) is the best option.
France has proven that reprocessing works. With a fully developed nuclear 
power capacity, they lead the world in providing clean energy to their citi-
zens. The French now store all the waste from 30 years of producing 75 
percent of their electricity beneath the floor of one room at La Hague, in 
Normandy.
 
After ten years, nuclear waste products are only one thousandth as radioac-
tive as they were initially. After 500 years, they are less radioactive than the 
uranium ore they originally came from. The waste question is simply one of 
storage; the technology is sound. The dispute is all about politics.
Uranium mining
Producing the U.S.’s nuclear energy takes around 52 million pounds of 
uranium, which is mostly imported from foreign sources (77 percent of 
the total). The primary foreign sources are Canada, Russia, Australia, and 
Uzbekistan. However, obtaining nuclear raw materials from foreign sources 
does not entail the same types of problems inherent to foreign fossil fuel 
sources since there is much less raw nuclear fuel being used, and the source 
countries are of a much different political complexion than the sources for 
fossil fuels.
Stopping proliferation?
In the U.S., reprocessing was halted during the 
1980s based on the unfounded belief that other 
countries would stop as well, and the supply of 
nuclear materials for use in weapons would be 
halted as a consequence. Because of this chi-
merical belief, the U.S. now has more nuclear 
waste than any other country in the world, at 
around 144 million pounds. It should be men-
tioned that a lot of this waste has resulted from 
weapons research and production, not just 
power plant waste.
As for nuclear weapon proliferation: Every 
country that has sought nuclear weapons has 
succeeded in obtaining them. The existence of 
nuclear power plants in western countries has 
had no effect, one way or another, on this trend. 
The way nuclear fuel is used in western reac-
tors in fact makes the use of waste products 
for weapons impossible. So the U.S. decision to 
halt reprocessing, in hindsight, was disastrous 
in light of the consequences.

141
 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
Uranium, a heavy ore mined from the ground, can be found over most of the 
globe in trace amounts, and this is a source for some of the natural back-
ground radiation of the earth. Most deposits are too low in density to extract 
economically. Over 99 percent of the naturally occurring radiation is U-238, 
which is unsuitable for use in nuclear power reactors. Less than one percent 
of the world’s uranium comes in the form U-235, which is the isotope used in 
nuclear fission power plants.
There are three methods of mining: 
 
✓ Over half of all uranium is mined from large underground caverns, simi-
lar in nature to coal mines (although not as dark and dreary). 
 
✓ Another 27 percent is obtained via a range of surface mining techniques, 
which leaves bad scars on the environment, not to mention high radia-
tion levels in the surrounding area. 
 
✓ In-situ leach mining accounts for the remaining 19 percent. This process 
uses oxygenated water to dissolve the uranium without disturbing the 
ore itself. The water is pumped up to the surface and processed to 
extract the uranium. Present day mining operations target ores that are 
at least 0.1 percent uranium, and there is a lot of waste material consequent 
to the process.
A substance called yellow cake is produced from the raw uranium. In-situ 
mining produces yellow cake on site, without the need for special refining 
processes. The yellow cake is then dried and formed into fuel rods, which are 
the raw fuel used in fission power reactors. Needless to say, this material is 
very hazardous, and expensive. Never order yellow cake for dessert.
The design of today’s reactors
 
With a very small amount of uranium, nuclear reactors of the fission variety 
(the only kind that are in existence today) can create huge amounts of useable 
heat energy, for a long, long time. In general the process works like this:
 
1. A core of uranium is maintained in the critical state (the self-perpetuating 
chain reaction described earlier).
 
2. Heat from the nuclear reaction is channeled into the boiler (this is 
similar in nature to the boilers used for fossil fuel combustion power 
plants). 
 
3. This heat is converted into steam, and the steam powers a huge turbine/
generator assembly which provides electrical power to the utility grid.

142
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
4. A condenser converts the used steam energy back down to a liquid, 
which is pumped back through the boiler for further production of 
electrical energy. Some reactors don’t allow the water to boil; they keep 
it under high pressure and use that pressure to spin the turbine. 
 
 Note: The boiler and heat transfer portion of the system are entirely 
unconnected to the nuclear reaction core so that the liquid used for 
boiling and condensing does not become radioactive. 
 
 In a boiling water reactor, the heated water is allowed to turn into steam 
prior to powering the turbine/generator. In a pressurized water system, 
the water is contained so that it cannot boil — instead it gets super-
heated and pressurized.
A number of different types of reactors have been built on the principles of 
the basic design described above. By far the most common type is the light-
water-cooled reactor. Water is used to carry the heat from the reaction to the 
turbine/generator, and it’s also used to cool the core. There are two types: 
boiling water and pressurized water, with the latter comprising two thirds 
of worldwide production. Other options have been pursued, and they work 
well enough, but there is something to be said for technological maturity, 
and since the light-water-cooled reactors are well known they are the favored 
choice.
Designed for safety
To ensure safe operation, safety precautions are designed to ameliorate the 
problems inherent in nuclear power via fission and take a variety of steps, 
including the following, to ensure the safe production of nuclear power:
 
✓ Housing the core within very thick, dense structures so that emissions 
of radiation and radioactivity are well contained. The radiation shield 
prevents the emission of radioactive byproducts into the surrounding 
environment (extremely important). The containment vessel also 
prevents the escape of radioactivity, as well as heat. 
 
✓ Housing the entire system in a secondary containment structure, as 
an extra precautionary measure that is generally spherical in shape. 
Spherical shapes can better withstand external catastrophes such as a 
terrorist attack, tornadoes, earthquakes, and the like. American contain-
ment structures can withstand the impact of a jet fighter going full speed 
without a breach in the seal. 
 
✓ Maintaining precise temperatures in the core by carefully pumping huge 
amounts of cooling water throughout the system.
 
✓ Ensuring that materials used in the reaction meet predetermined purity 
and density specifications. 

143
 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
 
There is actually very little chance of a nuclear explosion in a nuclear power 
plant. There are plenty of problems that can occur with a nuclear reactor, but 
a nuclear explosion is not one of them. If a reactor does go “supercritical,” the 
uranium at the core melts due to the excessive heat. But reactor-grade U-235 
is not processed enough to initiate the violent chain reaction at the core of a 
nuclear bomb. However, meltdowns can contaminate groundwater and air 
with radioactive emissions.
Advantages of fission reactors
There are a number of advantages of nuclear fission electrical power:
 
✓ Uranium is relatively inexpensive, in relation to fossil fuels. The energy 
density is extremely high so the amount of raw fuel is much less than for 
fossil fuel counterparts.
 
✓ Uranium is found in many different parts of the world, so supply issues 
are minor in relation to fossil fuels.
 
✓ If push came to shove, reprocessing the current waste stockpile could 
provide raw fuel.
 
✓ Maintenance of a nuclear power plant is infrequent, compared to fossil 
fuel type plants. Once a nuclear power plant is up and running, the chain 
reaction can be maintained for long periods without outside interference.
 
✓ Fission reactors do not need oxygen to operate, which means they can 
be sealed very thoroughly from the outside ambient. This prevents air 
contamination from the radiation that is released in the reaction.
 
✓ Nuclear reactors can be built underground, which enhances their safety 
because the ground acts as a huge containment vessel.
 
✓ Fission power reactors do not emit carbon dioxide, or other pollutants 
associated with fossil fuel combustion.
Disadvantages of fission reactors
Of course there are a number of disadvantages as well:
 
✓ Nuclear reactors cannot be easily turned up and down. They want 
to output consistent amounts of energy and are usually turned up to 
around two thirds capacity or more. When load requirements vary, 
backup power sources need to be employed to deal with the changing 
loads. This is fine, most of the time, because utilities have a very good 
idea of how much power is going to be needed at any given time.
 
✓ Uranium mining is dangerous because it exposes workers to potentially 
lethal doses of radioactivity. It also releases radioactivity into the air, 
and this can be swept great distances by the winds.

144
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
✓ Fission reactors produce a lot of nasty waste products, and these are 
dangerous.
 
✓ Although small, there is a risk of terrorist attacks because of the high 
containment. If a terrorist gets a hold of the nuclear waste products, 
they could be used to sabotage an entire community by “dirtying” the 
water and air supplies. 
 
✓ Moving fissionable materials is hazardous, both in supplying the reac-
tor with fresh uranium and in carrying away the disposal products. 
Accidents do happen, and an accident involving nuclear products could 
have widespread ramifications.
Hydrogen Fusion: Nuclear 
Power of the Future
The sun provides its energy via hydrogen fusion, which requires extremely 
high temperatures. In the sun’s case, this high temperature occurs because 
of the tremendous gravitation pull at the core due to the mass of the sun. 
The compression maintains a hot enough temperature for a constant nuclear 
fusion reaction to occur.
Fusion promises great advantages over fission because the only byproducts 
are naturally occurring elements on the earth. There is no radioactive danger 
from controlled fusion reactions.
The process at a glance
Hydrogen fusion occurs in several distinct steps (shown in Figure 8-2):
 
1. Two hydrogen nuclei (protons) combine and emit a positron, which 
has the same mass as an electron, but positive charge, and a neutrino.
 
 Neutrinos are similar to electrons and positrons but have tremendous 
energies that enable them to penetrate very dense materials.
 
2. One of the original protons changes state into a neutron.
 
 The resulting product is a deuterium atom (H-2), which is a heavy iso-
tope of hydrogen composed of one neutron and one proton.
 
3. The deuterium atom combines with another proton to create helium-3 
(H-3), which contains two protons and one neutron, and emits a burst 
of gamma radiation.

145
 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
 
4. Two separate H-3 nuclei fuse together to form He-4, which has two 
protons and two neutrons. In this phase, two protons are rejected, and 
these feed further reactions that start this entire process over again.
In the end, the total mass of the matter produced is slightly less than the 
total mass of all the ingredients, and this is the source of energy.

There is enough hydrogen in the sun to keep its atomic chain reaction going 
for millions of years, and the sun has already been burning steadily for mil-
lions of years. When distant stars die out, it’s because the supply of hydrogen 
is depleted.
 
There are currently no working fusion power reactors, but there are enough 
advantages of using this type of nuclear reaction over fission that a lot of 
research and development money is being spent on finding solutions. 

146

Advantages and disadvantages of fusion
A list of the advantages of nuclear fusion illustrates why it could be a large 
part of the solution to our current energy quandary. In fact, many people 
believe that fusion power, combined with fuel cells, is the ultimate solution to 
humankind’s energy problems. 
Here are the advantages of nuclear fusion power plants:
 
✓ The main byproduct of a hydrogen fusion reaction is He-4, which is a 
harmless gas. Tritium is also emitted, but that can be used as a clean 
fuel (I won’t get into the details here, which are very technical). As 
opposed to fission, fusion is much cleaner on the environment.
 
✓ Deuterium, the original fuel in the fusion reaction, can be easily 
manufactured from water, which is obviously in abundant supply.
 
✓ Deuterium and tritium are the only fuels necessary for a fusion reactor, 
and both are relatively cheap and abundant.
 
✓ There are no greenhouse gas emissions from a fusion power plant.
 
✓ A working reactor will actually be safer to operate than a fission reactor 
because meltdown cannot occur if the reactor core is damaged. Fusion 
reactions cannot be sustained without a continuous flow of new fuel, 
and this is straightforward to control.
Atomic bombs
In a hydrogen bomb, a slightly different reaction 
is induced. The chain reaction is nearly impos-
sible to control, but that’s not an issue with a 
bomb (in fact, that’s the desired end result). 
Here’s the reaction at the core of an atomic 
bomb.
Tritium (H-3 — one proton and two neutrons) 
combines with a nuclei of deuterium (H-2 — 
one proton and one neutron) to form He-4, or 
helium, along with an ejected neutron. A great 
deal of energy is also emitted in the process, 
since the mass after the combination is less 
than the mass before.
In a working bomb, the heat that induces this 
reaction is supplied by a small fission reac-
tion (which is easier to induce and control 
than fusion). The fission reaction burns out 
very quickly, but while it lasts there’s enough 
energy to induce a tremendous fusion reac-
tion. A fusion reaction burns out when all of the 
core material is exhausted. But in the process, 
there’s an atomic explosion, and we all know 
what that means — mushrooms!

147
 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
 
✓ Fusion is not a chain reaction, so it cannot self sustain. The reason a 
bomb works is because there is enough fuel to ignite the explosion, but 
then the fuel is exhausted very quickly. In a fusion reactor the amount of 
fuel can be controlled very carefully so that there is not enough at any 
given time to cause a catastrophic event.
As with everything under the sun (back to our original fusion reactor, the 
sun), there are disadvantages of fusion power:
 
✓ Despite the fact that there are no radioactive wastes, as there are with 
fission reactors, the emitted neutrons eventually cause too much 
radioactivity in the core for the process to be safe any longer. This 
problem can be solved, but at a very high cost.
 
✓ The widespread deployment of fusion reactors is not going to happen 
for some time.
 
✓ The public is very wary of any technology that operates basically as a 
controlled nuclear bomb. The political hurdles are formidable, and as 
fission has shown, political hurdles are numerous and powerful.
Issues Impacting the Move 
toward Nuclear Energy
With safety concerns front and center, the true question as to whether 
nuclear power should be pursued is one of economics and politics. Nuclear 
power technology has been well proven over the last 40 years, and there 
have been only two major nuclear power reactor problems (Three Mile Island 
and Chernobyl). The overwhelming vast majority of nuclear power reactors 
operating in the world have been extremely reliable and safe. The nuclear 
record is, in fact, much better than the fossil fuel record. Yet there is a 
stubborn mythology associated with nuclear power. 
It’s unfortunate that the same word used to describe atomic bombs and 
nuclear Armageddon has to be associated with nuclear power. It’s like 
associating all fossil fuel consumption with Molotov cocktails. Imagery and 
symbolism are very powerful elements in human perception. In this section 
I address some of the more persistent elements of nuclear mythology. Some 
may accuse me of taking a political stand here, and perhaps I am. Nuclear 
is going to play a role in the world’s energy drama more and more as time 
progresses. For that to happen, people need to understand what’s myth and 
what’s not.

148
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
The fear factor
Nuclear reactor safety has been a big issue in the entire 50 year history of 
the technology’s widespread use. There are a lot of unfounded fears, none 
of which has proven valid. Unfortunately, these fears have prevented more 
widespread use of nuclear power, the consequences being that our green-
house gas problems are worse than they need to be. Here is a short list of the 
main targets of the hysteria:
 
✓ Reactors can explode like an atomic bomb. There is no physics basis for 
this conclusion, and the engineering details of western power plants 
preclude anything like this from happening. The problem is that an 
exploding power plant is easy to visualize, while the physics that proves 
that it’s impossible is very difficult to understand. Simple images win 
the day.
 
✓ A massive release of radioactive elements could occur due to an 
accident at a nuclear plant. It’s true that in Chernobyl there was a 
tremendous radioactivity problem but the plant was built substandard, 
without the kind of containment technologies used in Western countries. 
Chernobyl only proved that foolish nuclear energy is very foolish 
indeed.
 
 The Chernobyl accident was caused by failures of Soviet style reactor 
systems. When Soviet style reactors get too hot, the rate of the nuclear 
reaction increases, which is the exact opposite of what happens in 
western style reactors. Plus, the Soviet reactors don’t have containment 
vessels to prevent radiation from escaping. And the area surround-
ing Chernobyl has now become a haven for wildlife, disproving the 
nuclear winter theory. The point is that little of value was learned from 
Chernobyl, aside from the already obvious fact that Soviet technology 
was way behind western technology.
 
✓ Meltdowns can occur due to a simple loss of coolant liquids. Coolant 
liquids maintain temperatures at the core of the reactor so that critical 
state can be maintained. When coolant liquids disappear, temperatures 
rise, but there is not enough raw reactor material to cause the reaction 
to go supercritical. Meltdowns occur because there is too much reactive 
material, and this is well controlled by safety features not related to 
coolant liquids.
 
✓ There is a continuous release of radioactivity under normal operating 
use. In other words, if you live next to a nuclear plant you may end up 
glowing in the dark, or having two-headed children. The fact is, there is 
more radioactivity released from a coal mine site than from a normally 
operating nuclear power reactor.

149
 Chapter 8: Going Nuclear
 
✓ Waste heating will be ecologically damaging. This is no more true than 
for fossil fuel combustion power plants. Take your choice; either way 
you get the heat. But waste heat is not nearly as environmentally damag-
ing as pollution byproducts.
 
✓ An accident will occur during transit of radioactive materials. This has 
never occurred, and if an accident does occur, containment vessels 
are rugged enough to withstand the tremendous forces that would be 
expected in an accident.
 
✓ Radioactive materials may be used by terrorists. This is true, although 
there are a huge number of safeguards to prevent it. But terrorists have 
proven that they don’t need nuclear materials to wreak havoc.
 
✓ Disposal of radioactive wastes can never be satisfactorily achieved. In 
fact, radioactive wastes have been contained successfully for the last 50 
years, with no record of environmental exposures over the natural state 
of affairs. People tend to forget that radiation occurs naturally in every 
part of the world. Nuclear plant radiation emissions are low compared 
to the natural state in many parts of the world, and the dire warnings of 
rampant cancer have never come true.
 
While there may have been good reason for the cautionary tone of the 1970s 
because nuclear power was a very big question mark, past predictions of cata-
strophic accidents haven’t even come close to the mark. By and large, nuclear 
has been proven safe and sound.
Economics of nuclear power
Historically, the high cost of construction and decommissioning (when a 
plant becomes obsolete, for any of a variety of reasons, it must be decom-
missioned) has made nuclear more expensive than coal and natural gas fired 
power plant energy. But this is going to change as more concern is being 
focused on greenhouse gas emitting power plants.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) determined that nuclear power costs 
around $72 per megawatt-hour of output, compared to around $55 for coal 
and $52 for natural gas. But the numbers reflect the high construction costs; 
once nuclear is on line, the raw fuel costs are much lower than fossil fuel 
plants. So the cost of nuclear is largely a function of the construction costs, 
and there are a whole host of regulatory and environmental hurdles that add 
tremendously to this cost. The relative regulatory burden on coal fired plants 
is much less, and this may not be a fair accounting if the cost of carbon pollu-
tion is included in the equation.

150
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
Nuclear reactors cost anywhere between $5 to $10 billion to build, and 
because of the regulatory burdens can take over 15 years to complete. It is 
estimated that around a third of the cost of building a nuclear plant can be 
attributed to the regulatory mandates, and so there is considerable room to 
alter the economics of plant construction, since plant construction comprises 
the largest component of the per watt cost of nuclear power.
The British government did a study wherein they concluded that the cost of 
nuclear power would be equivalent to that of coal and natural gas, if the regu-
latory burdens were made reasonable (enough regulation to ensure safety — 
no more, no less). And if carbon emissions were taxed, nuclear would be less 
costly than coal and natural gas fired electricity. 
It should be feasible to reduce the costs of nuclear construction significantly 
without comprising safety. Under the Nuclear Power 2010 program, the U.S. 
government has offered a very nonbureaucratic model for licensing, based on 
the French system which has proven to work very well (imagine that!). The 
U.S. government has even offered to subsidize up to 50 percent of the costs 
for the first six reactors built under this program. This is an overt acknowl-
edgement that the government believes in a nuclear future.
Nuclear power plants have never been built in a political ambient without a 
lot of resistance, and this increases bureaucratic costs to a large degree. In 
fact, that is the goal of nuclear opponents; to make the economics unviable. If 
the anti-nuclear movement stopped resisting new construction so much, the 
costs would come down by up to 25 percent, according to some government 
estimates.
In the U.S., plans have been announced for the construction of 30 new 
nuclear plants that would provide power to 32 million homes. The per watt 
price of power is calculated to be equivalent to that of coal powered plants, 
assuming the regulatory burdens are reduced.
If the nuclear power opponents, who are the original inventors of cap and 
trade and other policies designed to penalize fossil fuel combustion, would 
do their economic calculations taking carbon pollution into account, then 
nuclear power would be extremely competitive, and may even cost less than 
fossil combustion power. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculated 
that if the cost of carbon emissions was factored into the equation, nuclear 
would be the most inexpensive and safe source of electricity. It would also 
provide the most consistency over time, in light of the fact that fossil fuel 
supplies are so volatile.
In Chapter 15, I describe hydrogen fuel cells, and nuclear reactors could play 
an important role in producing the hydrogen needed for those cells. The 
entire process would be sustainable and environmentally pristine. So there 
are unseen economic benefits of developing more nuclear power, not to 
mention environmental advantages.

T
he sun sends over 35,000 times more energy to earth than humans use in 
all of their energy consumption endeavors. To put it another way, people 
use less energy in 27 years than the earth receives from the sun in a single 
day. That’s a lot of solar energy — for all practical purposes it’s an infinite 
supply, and renewable to boot. Best of all, it’s the cleanest source of energy 
the world has ever known. The problem, of course, is turning all those free-
for-all photons into useable energy, or ordered, energy. While humankind 
has been inventing creative ways to do just that for thousands of years, solar 
still affords a very limited applicability in the grand scheme of things. Only 
0.03 percent of the world’s ordered energy production comes from solar, and 
even though the industry is growing by over 33 percent per year, there’s a 
long road ahead.
When solar works well — when the conditions for harvesting sunlight into 
ordered energy are optimal — it’s one of the best alternative energy sources. 
Solar’s effectiveness in the grand scheme of things is not doubted, but even 
with phenomenal growth it will never play more than a supporting role in 
the alternative energy scenery. But supporting roles can still win Academy 
Awards, and solar is one of the top nominees.

Turning Sunlight into Energy: The 
Basics of Solar Technology
Of all the energy sources we humans use, solar is easily the oldest (preced-
ing even fire). There are two basic uses of solar energy (insofar as it relates 
to ordered energy production) — heat and generating electricity. The tech-
nologies for each are quite different, in practice, but the basic physics is 
essentially the same: Sunlight is captured and converted into either useable 
heat or useable electrical power. In the next sections I describe how light is 
captured and converted to useful work, and the problems and inefficiencies 
inherent in the process.
Understanding light
Light is all around us; most of us it we can’t even see. Light is composed of 
individual photons, each with a wavelength and an energy, and all travelling 
at the same velocity. 
The photon’s wavelength determines the color, in the portion of the spec-
trum that we can actually see (much of the light spectrum is invisible to the 
human eye). The photon’s frequency determines the energy of a photon. The 
higher the frequency, the higher the energy. You can visualize this by pictur-
ing two snakes, one large and one small, crossing a hot road. The large snake 
wriggles across the road with much longer strides (wavelength) than the 
small snake. To wriggle fast enough to keep up with the large snake, the small 
snake has to expend much more energy.
As mentioned previously, only a small portion of the spectrum is visible. At 
the low end is blue light, with a lot of energy (high frequency), and at the 
upper end is red light, which is lower in energy. Above the red zone is infra-
red, which is basically heat radiation. This is relevant because solar collec-
tors are selective in which wavelengths they work with. An efficient collector 
will convert all the wavelengths in the spectrum into useable energy, while an 
inefficient collector will favor infrared, for instance. Solar water heaters con-
vert much more of the spectrum to useable energy than PV cells, although 
technical advances in PV cells have enabled a much broader range of selec-
tivity, making them more efficient.
On the passive front, windows are available which selectively filter both 
ultraviolet light and infrared light. Ultraviolet is damaging to fabrics and 
carpets, while infrared light is responsible for a lot of heat. Neither of these 
spectral regions are visible, and so these high-tech windows do not alter the 
view to the outside.

153
 Chapter 9: Harnessing the Sun with Solar Power
 
Of all the solar energy that reaches the planet earth, here’s where it goes:
 
✓ 35 percent is reflected away from the earth, back into space
 
✓ 43 percent is absorbed as heat radiation, both ground based and 
atmospheric
 
✓ 22 percent evaporates water, creating rain and water distribution
 
✓ 0.2 percent creates wind energy, or kinetic energy of the atmosphere
 
✓ 0.02 percent is used up in photosynthesis by plants
The PV cell: Generating electricity 
from sunlight
So how do we harness sunlight to generate electricity? With the modern PV 
cell, a revolutionary technological advancement that underpins the entire PV 
solar industry today. PV cells convert light energy into electrical energy. All 
solar PV systems, regardless of size or complexity or manufacturer, rely on a 
very simple process called the photovoltaic effect, which takes advantage of 
the fact that light photons act as both radiation and matter.
A brief history of solar power
Since time immemorial, humans have been 
using the sun for warmth, and devising inventive 
schemes to heat water and make electricity. In 
1860, Auguste Mouchout, a French mathema-
tician, invented the first solar-powered steam 
engine. It didn’t offer much power, but it could 
get the job done, albeit slowly (unfortunately 
for Mouchout’s wallet, humans don’t like slow). 
In 1870, American John Ericsson devised a 
solar water trough that focused concentrated 
radiation onto a liquid — water or oil — and 
the steam pressure was used to spin turbines. 
As with Mouchout’s invention, the job could be 
done, but only slowly, and only when the sun 
was shining. Solar engines inevitably gave way 
to fossil fuel power plants.
Most of the early advances in solar power were 
geared toward thermal applications, where the 
heat of the sun converted liquids into steam, 
which was used in steam engines. Some of 
the more outrageous inventions included huge 
mirrors, which focused a lot of energy onto a 
small spot size. These inventions did not fare 
well in windy conditions, as one might imagine. 
And engines like this are fixed into place, so 
they were never used in transport.
It was not until 1905 that Albert Einstein theo-
rized the PV (photovoltaic) effect, which exploits 
the dual nature of light (photons act as both 
radiation and matter — a rather counterintuitive 
fact, but fact it is). From Einstein’s work evolved 
the modern PV cell, which converts light energy 
into electrical energy, a revolutionary techno-
logical advancement that underpins the entire 
PV solar industry today. Einstein established 
some of the basics of nuclear power as well; 
his influence is inestimable.

154
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Here’s how it works: Incident radiation (a fancy term for sunshine) hits 
the PV cell and the technology within the cell transforms the light energy 
(explained in the preceding section) into a raw electrical signal. Wires trans-
mit this signal down to an inverter, which converts the power to useable 
electrical power. 
The driving force behind the solar PV market is the underlying technology of 
semiconductors. Semiconductors are made of very carefully purified silicon 
(and other elements, when appropriate) which forms a crystalline structure 
with specific electrical properties. Microprocessors are made of semiconduc-
tors, as are transistors and most modern electronic devices. When a photon 
of light strikes a semiconductor, an electron is freed up from the crystalline 
structure, and this is what causes electricity to flow. All electrical flow con-
sists of electron movement. The material that absorbs photons in a PV cell 
is principally silicon, which is basically sand, the same kind you find at the 
beach. In a semiconductor, the sand is highly ordered, whereas at the beach 
the sand is just plain sand.
To achieve the maximum efficiency, you need a uniform crystalline struc-
ture over large areas, but creating such a structure is difficult and expensive 
(although the costs are coming down with increases in production capacity 
and new technologies). The two current options include:
 
✓ Monocrystalline silicon (made of crystals of one type only) is the best 
quality material for PV applications because the efficiency is very high. 
The cost is also high. 
 
✓ Polycrystalline silicon has a lower efficiency, but the cost is also much 
lower. The tradeoff, in practical terms, is that polycrystalline solar 
panels take up more roof space (or wherever the system is mounted) 
but cost less.
In the process of manufacturing a solar cell from either monocrystalline 
or polycrystalline silicon, small amounts of particular types of impurities 
(N-type and P-type) are introduced into the material in a very carefully con-
trolled manner. N-type impurities provide for an excess of electrons, and 
P-type impurities leave a shortage of electrons. Either of these can create 
electrical flow.
The magic occurs when an N-type substrate is appropriately melded with a 
P-type substrate and a thin layer of silicon oxide is positioned between the 
two different substrates so that electricity does not flow between the sub-
strates until light is present (see Figure 9-1). But when light is present, elec-
tricity flows between the substrates, and for all practical purposes the result 
is very similar to a battery in the way power is provided.

Solar PV panels, of course, aren’t the only technologies that use semiconduc-
tors. You can find the same type of materials used in computer chips and 
other electronics. Whereas the computer industry uses small quantities of 
very highly purified and ordered semiconductors, the PV industry is con-
cerned with manufacturing large surface areas as cheaply as possible, so that 
the collector cross section is as large as possible.
 
For the most part, solar PV is simple stuff and the same principles apply to 
large and small scale solar power systems. A large-scale system, one that 
powers an entire office building, is simply a huge matrix of individual 
elements — big arrays of PV panels are configured to produce the most power 
possible in the most efficient way — but it works the same way a small system 
(like one you’d have in your home, for example) does. 
Current and future efficiency 
ratings of solar panels
Overall, the typical efficiency rating for a solar panel is around 16 percent, 
which means that of all the sunlight energy that is collected by a PV panel, 
only 16 percent of that energy is available as electrical power. Because there 
is a maximum amount of sunlight power of around 1 kW per square meter, a 
square meter of PV panel can only put out around 0.18 kW. There have been 
increases in this value, but the costs are prohibitive. 

156
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Monocrystalline solar cells have produced efficiencies of over 25 percent, 
while polycrystallines have achieved 20 percent. Researchers expect efficien-
cies will reach 30 percent, but not much higher due to the inherent physics 
of current technologies. This puts an upper limit on the amount of power a 
solar PV system will ever be able to produce on any given roof.
Efficiency may or may not be a problem. For instance, if there is unlimited 
surface area for installing panels (ground mounts in the middle of the desert) 
efficiency is of secondary concern to overall cost. In fact, the technologies 
that are being developed the fastest at this point put a premium on low cost, 
at the expense of efficiency. A new type of PV cell is being developed which 
is a wide, thin film that can simply be placed over an entire roof. The mate-
rial, in fact, is the roof covering, and every square inch of the roof is produc-
ing power (at an efficiency of only 12 percent, maximum). Contrast this with 
fixed, rectangular panels that can only cover a portion of a roof.
Challenges Facing Solar Power 
Solar offers many advantages: It’s the only energy source that can boast zero 
raw fuel costs and virtually unlimited supply with no supply issues such as 
transport, storage, taxes, etc. It’s available everywhere, even on the moon, 
to varying degrees. And it may be the only energy source that generates zero 
pollution (at least from the production, or consumption, side — invested 
energy is still required). In fact, from a pollution standpoint, solar power is 
the most energy-efficient investment that can be made, hands down.
Calculating solar radiation
At sea level, on a clear day, around 1 kW of 
solar energy is incident on a one square meter 
surface (to put this in perspective, a pool pump 
uses around 1.5 kW’s of power, and this is a 
lot of power). In the mountains, where the air 
is thinner, even more radiation is measured 
because much more of it gets through the thin 
atmosphere. However, as we all know, the sun’s 
intensity varies over the course of a day, so it’s 
of interest to calculate just how much solar 
radiation falls on a one square meter surface 
over the course of a day. 
 ✓ In the summer, one can expect around 10 
kWh’s of energy to fall onto the one square 
meter surface, on a clear, cool day.
 ✓ In the winter, expect around 4 or 5 kWh’s, 
under the best circumstances.
 ✓ When the weather is partly cloudy, in the 
summertime, the typical yield is around 6 
kWh’s.
 ✓ In the worst conditions, a cloudy, winter 
day, only around 1 kWh or less will fall onto 
the surface. This is why it’s so cold in the 
winter (I probably didn’t have to tell you 
that, did I?).

157
 Chapter 9: Harnessing the Sun with Solar Power
So why don’t we have solar farms pumping out electricity all over the coun-
try? Because there are limitations inherent in current solar technologies, as 
the following sections explain. 
Technological limitations
Semiconductors are not particularly effective in creating an electrical current 
because their electrons are fairly stable. Therefore, a metal grid of some kind 
is required to overlay the PV semiconductor material. 
While the grid is necessary (at least with current technology), it has the 
further effect of covering up some of the semiconductor, making for lower 
efficiencies. Plus, the process of applying the conductive grids is expensive 
and difficult.
New grid materials are being developed which do not shade the semiconductor 
materials, and this results in better efficiency. The most promising candidate 
is tin oxide (SnO2).
Another issue is how much of the light spectrum current PV technology can 
actually convert into electrical signals.
 
Depending on the composition of the semiconductor, only certain wave-
lengths of light will cause electron/hole generation. Some photons simply 
don’t have enough energy to create electrons or holes, and some photons 
have too much energy and simply bypass the entire semiconductor structure.
The spectral response of materials is also of interest, because it is important 
to not only collect the most amount of sunlight, but turn it into electricity. 
New technologies are allowing the semiconductors to react to a wider 
spectrum, and this increases efficiency.
Weather and temperature considerations
One of the biggest technical hurdles with all PV systems, regardless of the 
materials or configuration, is weather exposure. Panels are subjected to 
wind, dust, water, high and low temperatures, and corrosives like acid rain. 
Constant bombardment by solar radiation is desired, but it’s also very hard 
on materials at the same time. Lifetime issues used to be overbearing, but 
recent technical improvements have assured lifetimes of over 30 years for 
solar PV panels.

158
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
As with all semiconductors, thin film PV substrates work better at cold tem-
peratures — which isn’t what you’d expect given that the more sunshine 
that hits a semiconductor, the hotter it gets. Yet, installed PV systems often 
output more power on a cool, breezy spring day than a hot, sunshine-intense 
summer day. 
New designs which are becoming more common combine solar PV with solar 
hot water in such a way that the heat is removed from the solar PV panels. 
Two functions in one, and the performance of each is enhanced in the process.
The variability of sunlight 
The final piece of the puzzle is collector cross section. Imagine a sheet of paper 
that you look at from different perspectives. If you set it on a table and look 
down, directly at it, it will look like a sheet of paper, nice and rectangular; 
you see the entire extent of the paper. If you look at it from the side, you will 
hardly see anything at all except a thin line. As you move your perspective 
around, the sheet grows bigger and smaller, and the rectangle becomes a 
parallelogram with odd angles. 
A fixed solar collector works on the same principle. The more surface area 
that is exposed to direct sunlight, the more output the collector is capable of.
The trick to getting the maximum benefit from solar panels is to ensure that 
they are oriented appropriately for the region they’re in. 
Obviously, the number of hours of sunlight a day an area receives is impor-
tant. The map in Figure 9-2 shows the average number of hours per day of 
sunshine in the United States and Canada. You can see that the Southwest 
gets the most sunshine per day (depending on the season, anywhere from 5.3 
to 8.0 hours a day) — and that Canada and the northern states get the least 
(1.8 to 5.5 hours a day). 
The hours of sunlight, however, isn’t the only key factor. The quality of the 
sunlight, the angle at which sunlight hits a particular region, and how much 
atmosphere sunlight has to pass through also play a part, as the following 
sections explain.
Cloud cover and smog
Sunlight changes along with the weather. In cloudy regions, there is still a lot 
of solar energy, but it’s generally diffused (spread out and unfocussed). (For 
this reason, solar collector panel orientation isn’t so critical because light 
will be coming in at many different angles rather than just directly overhead 
from the sun.)

Air pollution and smog also affect the amount of sunlight on a collector. The 
effect is similar to that of clouds, but depending on the composition of the 
smog, a lot of spectral filtering can also occur and this further decreases the 
efficiency. Some types of air pollution have the nasty tendency to corrode 
solar panels, the same way they corrode human lungs.

The position of the sun: Plotting sun charts
The more direct the sunlight on a solar collector, the more energy that col-
lector will gather for converting into useable energy. This is a rather intuitive 
concept, but it’s worth exploring in more detail.
The position of the sun may be plotted with two angles (azimuth, which is the 
angle from true south, and altitude, which is the angle from level, or in most 
cases the horizon), as shown in Figure 9-3.

Figure 9-4 shows a graph of the movement of the sun over the course of a 
day. The arc in the middle represents either spring or fall. All other paths lie 
somewhere between the two extremes, represented by summer and winter 
equinox, which are the longest and shortest days of the year. By using com-
puter analysis programs, it’s possible to predict the amount of total sunshine 
a collector will receive on any given day of the year. In the winter much less 
sunshine will be available, and this is indicated by the area under the winter 
curve. In the summer, the area under the curve gives the expected sunshine. 
System productivity is always of concern, because it determines the payback 
on a solar investment, so a good estimation of the total sunlight will yield a 
good estimate of the total expected system output.

When the sun goes behind a mountain or a tall building, there will be no 
direct sunlight at all. If the sun goes behind a tree, there may be some direct 
sunlight, but mostly there will be shading effects. Also, the horizon changes 
the time of dawn and dusk.
Sunlight intensity 
In addition to how much direct sunlight a collector gets, sunlight intensity is 
important. When the sun is lower in the sky, solar radiation must pass through 
more atmosphere, and it’s therefore reduced by scattering and absorption. 
For this reason, solar exposure is better in the mountains than near sea level 
simply because the air is thinner and scatters less sunlight. (That’s why sun-
burns on the ski slopes are much worse than the kind you get at the pool.)
Getting enough power
Current technologies for PV systems (as well as water heating systems) cap-
ture only 30 watts per square meter, on a round the clock average. To put 
this in perspective, New York City consumes 55 watts per square meter of 
energy on the same round the clock average. So to power New York City, an 
area of twice the city would have to be covered with solar collectors (and 
beneath this would be no direct sunshine, which might not make for such a 
benign environment). A uranium mine produces a million times more energy, 
per surface area. 
Using current technology, you’d have to cover a huge surface area of the 
earth to generate enough solar power to put an appreciable dent in the 
world’s energy demand. Even if that were possible, it would have a severe 
impact on the ecological balance (think of the poor sunshine starved plants 
beneath the collectors).
The point is, solar will never be more than a sidebar in the overall energy pic-
ture simply due to the logistics of covering expansive areas with panels.

The Economics of Solar Power 
Although a number of studies have shown a net positive impact of solar 
energy, particularly in communities dedicated to large-scale development of 
solar power, the most basic reality of solar power is that it is viable only in 
sunshine rich climates, particularly the Southwest and Pacific coastal areas. 
Even with government subsidies, solar is not now, nor will it likely ever be, 
viable in cloudy, rainy climates. However, if the price of solar decreases 
enough, this may change, although the vehicle of change will be investment 
capital, and when solar lags so far behind other alternative energy sources, 
investment capital also lags behind.
Earth: Going full tilt
The Earth is tilted on its axis 23.5°, and the fol-
lowing figure shows what happens to the posi-
tion of the sun in the sky over the course of a 
year.
Regardless of where you live, the difference 
between the sun’s peak angles in the sky from 
December to June is 46°. Regions closest to the 
poles experience seasons when the sun never 
shines, and six months later, seasons when the 
sun never goes below the horizon (known as 
white night).
The optimum elevation angle for a solar system 
depends on latitude. In general, the optimum 
tilt angle is equal to latitude, for this will ensure 
the maximum amount of sunlight exposure over 
the course of a year. Even better would be to 
manually change the elevation of the solar col-
lectors periodically over the course of a year to 
“follow” the sun’s elevation in the sky.

 Chapter 9: Harnessing the Sun with Solar Power
The following sections provide you with info on the economical impacts of 
large-scale solar power use, including the benefits as well as the economical 
challenges solar power faces.
 
In 2005, the U.S. economy consumed 100 quadrillion Btus of energy, of which 
less than 1 percent was solar. The impact that solar makes on the entire 
renewable (alternative) energy industry is very small. Furthermore the con-
sumption of all energy sources in the last ten years has increased 25 percent, 
but solar production has only increased 17 percent, so solar is not even keep-
ing up with the economy at large. This is due solely to the peculiar economics 
of solar, not the available technologies.
The dollars and sense of solar power
As you can see from this list, not all of the economic benefits of solar power 
can be enumerated in monetary terms — you can’t put a price on good sense:
 
✓ Solar communities are cleaner, with less carbon footprint. The benefits 
of this are intangible, but nevertheless people are aware and there is a 
decidedly increased community spirit.
 
✓ Solar communities tend to support recycling programs and other envi-
ronmental improvements.
 
✓ In communities dedicated to solar, much less of the community’s money 
is going out of the community. 
 
✓ With solar energy, local jobs are created, and the jobs are stable and 
sustainable and skilled, meaning high pay and good benefits.
Yet, despite these positives, the economics of solar power are not as good as 
for conventional energy sources (combustion sources): upfront investment 
costs are high; payback may take a long time; and the investment is illiquid 
and fixed. Most people do not want, or cannot, lay out a big investment solely 
for the purpose of rationalizing their energy consumption.
Looking at solar adoption, sector by sector
Traditionally, there have been two main sectors for solar: residential and 
commercial. Residential customers are more apt to invest in solar due 
to “green” sentiments than commercial customers, so the economics are 
skewed in favor of residential. In 2002, solar was 13 percent of all renewable 
energy consumed in residences but only 6 percent of commercial consumption.

164
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
It’s an open question just how much the green factor plays in payback cal-
culations, but it is a fact that many residential solar customers are willing to 
pay a premium to eliminate their personal carbon footprints. This trend is 
increasing, with all the news of global warming and society’s general sense 
that we each need to chip in to help solve the problem. 
More recently, independent power producers are also going to solar, mainly 
because of government mandates that power producers must wean them-
selves off of fossil fuel energy sources. From 1989 to 2003, independent 
power producers increased their solar production by 67 percent, which is 
much higher than the overall power production increase. So independents 
are investing more and more into solar, but not because of economics — it’s 
because of mandates.
Commercial customers of solar are generally concerned with the bottom 
line on their business, although businesses that install solar can advertise 
that they’re “green,” and in many markets that makes a favorable difference 
with customers. For instance, a landscaping company that installs solar 
panels on their roof, and advertises that they are a “green” company, can see 
their sales increase. This has the effect of making the payback of the solar 
investment much better. It should be added that this effect can be abused; 
some commercial entities install a minimally sized system just so they can 
advertise their greenness; they’re not really green, but they’re claiming to be. 
Perhaps someday the government will regulate what standards a business 
must meet before proclaiming itself “green.” 
Looking at infrastructure
The main economic factor for solar PV, as well as solar hot water, is the 
lack of supporting infrastructure. Fossil fuels drive the vast majority of the 
world’s energy market, and as such there is a tremendous infrastructure 
dedicated toward that energy source. Solar, however, is a relatively isolated 
technology, and contractors often have a difficult time maintaining their 
businesses in the light of varying government involvement. In particular, the 
worldwide supply of PV panels fluctuates quite a bit, and this results in price 
disparities and inconsistencies.
Better solar infrastructure would include more collector manufacturing 
plants. The majority of those in existence now are overseas, so the govern-
ment should subsidize American solar equipment manufacturers. In fact, 
most solar equipment is manufactured overseas, and this causes bottlenecks 
and uncontrollable price fluctuations. Above all, the government needs to be 
more consistent with its subsidies and tax breaks.

165
 Chapter 9: Harnessing the Sun with Solar Power
Another important economic question concerns development costs for new 
technologies, and jobs that will be created in the process. In the burgeoning 
green paradigm, sustainable jobs are just as important as sustainable energy 
sources, and so the development of a formidable solar industry is good for 
society as a whole. Solar is produced locally, and so the jobs and infrastruc-
ture are local.
Comparing cost: Solar versus fossil fuels
As with any alternative energy source, the question is how does the cost of 
solar power compare to conventional fossil fuels? Current electrical rates 
around North America range from a low of around six cents per kWh to over 50 
cents, particularly in tiered rate structures where a progressive price is applied 
to the quantity of energy consumption used in a building. The more consump-
tion, the higher the kWh price goes. A rule of thumb in the industry is that 
solar PV costs around 15 cents per kWh. This includes up-front investment as 
well as maintenance and lifetime costs. Plus, this assumes best case scenarios, 
namely a lot of sunshine and good weather. So the fact is, solar PV is not eco-
nomically competitive with grid power except under certain conditions.
However, if pollution mitigation is taken into account, the economics change 
quite a bit. Solar power is basically pollution free, aside from invested energy, 
and that’s improving every year. If cap and trade policies are instituted the 
net effect will be that solar becomes much more competitive. In fact, of all 
the alternative energy scenarios, solar will gain the most from a carbon tax, a 
tax placed on carbon outputting energy sources — for instance, a 50-cent sur-
charge on a gallon of gasoline due to its high carbon output.
The economics of net metering
When the solar system is outputting more energy than the host building is 
using, excess power is available. Net metering (also referred to as intertie, or 
grid connect) means that you can sell your excess power back to the utility 
company. Net metering is great for PV system economics because every solar 
system, whether PV, water heating, or another type, has a certain maximum 
capacity. While maximum capacity depends on a number of things — on a 
cloudy day, system capacity is much less than on a sunny day, for example — 
consumption is governed simply by what you need and want. In a typical 
household, power consumption peaks in the morning and evening while solar 
production peaks in the middle of the day, when the sun is highest in the sky. 
With a PV system tied in to the grid, you can use as much power as you need, 
and your PV system merely contributes whenever it can. What you don’t use 
from your solar system is all sold back to the utility.

166
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Without net metering, or intertie, solar PV economics would be hopeless 
under most circumstances. In fact, solar PV has proliferated solely due to net 
metering laws. 
 
The government has mandated that utilities not only allow solar PV custom-
ers to connect to the grid, but that they pay the same amount for power they 
receive from solar systems as for the power they dispense to their customers. 
Without the mandates, the utilities would probably not allow solar at all. In 
fact, without mandates, the utilities would probably demand the first born of 
every one of their customers. 
In some regions, solar PV is even more advantageous because the utilities 
offer time of use (TOU) rate scheduling, where electricity rates are highest 
during peak usage time (generally, from noon until 6 p.m.). The timing is 
perfect for solar PV systems because they generate a majority of their power 
during peak time (remember, by law the utilities must pay you the same rate 
they charge for power, so at peak time they must pay you peak rates). Then 
later, when you use more power than you’re generating, you get power back 
at a much smaller price. In this way, the size of a solar PV system can be lev-
eraged to increase return on investment.
Government Incentives for Solar Power 
The upfront investment cost of solar power is very high. Most people don’t 
have upwards of $20,000 to spend on solar PV equipment. And those that do 
would often rather have a new kitchen or a swimming pool, both of which 
offer a much more immediate, tactile enjoyment. So without government 
subsidies, solar would be little more than an asterisk. Allocating accurate 
costs is one of the keys to making alternatives work, and solar is certainly 
not alone in that its costs need subsidizing. When cap and trade systems are 
embraced, solar will be a much more viable energy source. In fact, with cap 
and trade, solar will be the best alternative energy candidate of all because 
there is no carbon outputs at all. 
The one big factor in determining how much money will go into solar devel-
opment and production is government incentives. Without government 
incentives, the economics of solar power are non-competitive. This is why 
the federal governments of a number of countries provide rebates and tax 
incentives for the solar industry. The thinking is that if the government 
provides enough development money, over time the industry will catch up 
economically to the fossil fuel industry, and become competitive without 
government subsidies. So in essence, government intervention is creating a 
new industry, one that is beneficial and desirable for society on a number of 
fronts.

167
 Chapter 9: Harnessing the Sun with Solar Power
The government is interested in subsidizing solar PV for three main reasons:
 
✓ Solar power is the ideal solution for peak-power generating problems. 
Solar systems output the most amount of power in the afternoon, when 
the sun is shining the brightest. 
 
✓ Solar PV is the cleanest, most efficient source of energy. There is literally no 
pollution in the operation of a solar PV system. There is some invested 
energy, of course, but the raw fuel costs are zero, and the operating 
pollution is zero.
 
✓ Solar PV is distributed, meaning it does not come from one large, 
centralized source. This is advantageous because it affords a less risky 
society, both in terms of assuring continuous power availability and 
inoculation from terrorist acts.
In countries such as Japan and Germany, generous solar subsidies have 
been in place for decades, and the infrastructure is far ahead of that in North 
America.
Federal tax credits
Federal tax credits are the largest solar subsidy, constituting 30 percent of 
a solar system’s value, both for commercial and residential. One must pay 
taxes, however, in order to exploit the tax credits. Plus there is a need to 
finance the amount of the credit at the purchase point of the solar system. 
It may take over a year, or even more if credits are spread out over time, to 
recoup the original expense. Yet at 30 percent of total system cost, this tax 
credit is a real gift.
State incentive programs
The state of California leads the nation in solar installations, and it’s largely 
because of a massive subsidy known as the California Solar Initiative (CSI). 
Up to 25 percent of the cost of a solar system is rebated to the customer, 
but it’s even better than that. The rebate amount goes straight to the solar 
contractor that installs the system so the customer doesn’t have to front 
the money prior to receiving the rebate (with most rebates, you have to buy 
something at the retail price, then apply for a rebate which comes later in the 
mail).

168
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
In addition, the state of California mandates that a solar customer cannot 
have his/her building reassessed to raise property taxes. With most improve-
ments in a home, particularly the ones that require county building permits 
with all the associated code inspections, the county reassesses the value of 
the property, and the property taxes go up. Not so with solar.
Washington State has offered energy consumers 0 percent loans for the 
purchase of solar systems, both PV and hot water. These loans are available 
through the utilities so that customers may simply have solar installed, and 
instead of paying their utility bills, pay off the loan for the solar equipment. 
It’s common for the loan payments to match the customer’s power bill, so 
the net cash flow is the same. And these loans are assumable to a new owner.
Hawaii just passed a bill requiring all new homes to install solar water heat-
ers. The cost of energy in Hawaii grew from less than 7 cents per kWh in 2003 
to over 15 cents per kWh in 2005, due mostly to increased demand and lim-
ited production capacities. Hawaii is not connected to the American power 
grid, obviously, so their unique situation calls for unique measures.
Arguments against subsidies 
and tax breaks
Obviously, when the government subsidizes any form of alternative energy, 
it’s the taxpayers who are footing the bill. So society, in general, is subsidizing 
those customers who install solar. This is seen as unfair in some circles, 
One man’s bailout is another’s bonanza 
In the famous (or infamous) 2008 bailout bill 
passed by congress amidst great political pres-
sure, the residential tax credits for solar power 
were drastically changed, to the benefit of the 
entire solar industry. Prior to the bill, the tax 
credit was 30 percent, with a cap of $2,000 on 
residential installations (and no cap on com-
mercial applications, which strongly favored 
commercial). Under the new law, the cap on 
residential was removed, which resulted in a 
tremendous surge in residential demand.
This illustrates the precarious nature of the 
economics of alternative energy, in that the 
entire market conditions can change literally 
overnight. With this kind of uncertainty in the 
market, potential investors are wary because 
these kinds of changes can go both ways. A 
potential investor looks not only at expected 
returns on investment, but also at risk, and when 
there is a big question mark looming overhead 
the risk is increased.
Governments need to stabilize alterna-
tive energy markets with more consistent 
approaches to the subsidies that are offered. 
It’s not enough just to step in once in awhile and 
make some money available. The money needs 
consistency as well and this is a difficult end 
to achieve when politics is the central player 
in the drama. 

169
 Chapter 9: Harnessing the Sun with Solar Power
since it favors the wealthier individuals who can afford the up-front cost of 
solar equipment. Just because the payback economics of a solar investment 
are favorable doesn’t mean that people will install solar because a majority of 
the population are living from month to month paychecks and don’t have the 
means for a large investment. 
Another argument against solar is that subsidies are only available to those 
who have homes and businesses in sunny climates. Even in sunny climates, 
homes with a lot of surrounding trees won’t be able to exploit solar power, 
so in some ways solar subsidies are anti-tree (as opposed to tree hugging). 
And many roofs are not oriented well to exploit solar – roofs at a slope of 
25 degrees, facing true south, afford the best production. Some roofs are so 
hopelessly off the optimum that a solar investment is simply not worth the 
cost, even with all the rebates and tax credits. And roofs that have many sep-
arate facets are also not amenable to solar because it’s impossible to achieve 
enough uninterrupted surface area for the collectors. At the very least, luck 
plays a role in the equation because many homes and businesses simply 
don’t have the requisite conditions for productive solar.
Looking at the Full Range of 
Practical Solar Options
The range of different solar applications is far broader than any other type of 
alternative energy sources, and this enables solar to find its way into more 
niches. The following sections outline some general ways that solar power 
can be used.
Passive solar
Passive solar objectives are straightforward: allow sunshine into the interior 
spaces of a building when heat and light is needed, keep the sunshine out during 
hot summer months, and manage optimally the heat that is allowed to enter. 
 
Passive building designs allow for not only solar lighting but solar heating and 
cooling systems. Passive solar works best when designed into a building’s 
original structure. Retrofitting a building into a passive solar masterpiece is 
much more difficult, and the economics can be a stretch. 

170
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
These objectives are accomplished by the following:
 
✓ Proper orientation of the building. Orientation is best when the long 
side of a building is facing true south to expose the most surface area 
to the sun so that sunlight can be channeled into the rooms where the 
family spends the most time. Great rooms, family rooms, living rooms, 
and kitchens should always be located on the southern exposures, and 
should exploit the solar design elements. This ensures a more active 
interaction between the natural elements and the building dwellers.
 
✓ Strategic placement of windows, skylights, and awnings, as well as 
deciduous trees and trellises on the outside. From an environmental 
standpoint, the strategic placement of trees is the best possible solution 
because buildings shaded appropriately with trees can see up to 20 
percent cost reductions in heating and cooling costs.
 
✓ Using thermal mass to store heat in the winter. Thermal mass acts as a 
ballast to maintain a consistent temperature in the building, regardless of 
season. Concrete floors have a lot of thermal mass, as do tile and bricks and 
stones (water does as well). Wood and carpet have little thermal mass.
 
✓ Making optimum use of insulation and ventilation. Regardless of 
whether one is trying to heat or cool, the ability to control heat 
movement is important. Ventilation is also important because it provides 
fresh air, and also allows for moving heat, as appropriate. Natural 
ventilation schemes such as the chimney affect and thermosiphoning 
are always preferable to machine driven, active means. 
 
✓ Using light tubes and skylights enhances the natural feel of a building’s 
interior, and reduces the burden on electrical lighting. A good solar 
building will require no active lights during a typical work day.
Buildings that incorporate passive solar features offer energy bills up to 
70 percent lower than conventional buildings. Plus the interiors are more 
naturally lit, which lends a sense of spaciousness and makes people feel 
closer to Mother Nature. Many localities now require commercial buildings 
to be designed using passive solar as much as possible, and since it doesn’t 
cost much more to include passive solar the building industry is readily 
complying. 
Solar PV 
In one fell swoop a solar PV system can completely offset an entire electric 
utility bill while generating zero pollution. Millions of photovoltaic (PV) sys-
tems are being installed all over the world, and the costs are decreasing due 
to economies of scale and technological improvements. 

171
 Chapter 9: Harnessing the Sun with Solar Power
Solar PV (photovoltaic, or the generation of electric power from the sun) is 
coming into its own. The power generation is local (thereby cutting out the 
inefficiencies of long grid transmission lines and ancillary support equip-
ment) and completely free of pollution. Following are some ways that solar 
PV technology is being used today:
 
✓ To run pumps for irrigation, remote cabins, livestock watering applica-
tions, etc. These systems are usually well away from electrical utility 
hookups.
 
✓ To power roadway signs, remote gates, and other applications where 
utility power is not available.
 
✓ To power remote applications such as roadside call boxes, illuminated 
highway signs, navigational systems, buoys, unmanned installations, 
gate openers and electric fences, and remote pumping
 
✓ To directly power DC electrical motors. If you don’t have access to grid 
electricity, this can be very useful and economical. If you simply want 
to cut back on pollution, this is also a good way to make a contribution. 
This type of system works very well for remote cabins, and where 
electrical grid power is not available. For instance, ranchers use such 
systems to provide water to cattle located in the boondocks.
Large scale solar concentrators are being developed which are capable of 
turning turbines and creating commercial amounts of electricity. At present, 
these systems are little more than research novelties but as with solar PV, 
the situation is rapidly improving. 
Solar hot water systems
The complexity of solar hot water systems varies, but they all do pretty 
much the same thing: heat water. The vast majority of hot water systems are 
used in third world countries, and are made of very simple materials. 
A solar hot water heater can be made out of little more than a big metal 
barrel painted black. Black absorbs the solar radiation, which then conducts 
into the water, which can then be used for showers and baths and cleaning. 
In simpler systems, the temperature is not very well regulated, but these 
systems are generally used where there is no electrical power at all, and they 
are considered luxuries. More sophisticated systems use collectors made of 
black coated copper, and have sealed chambers with very good insulation 
properties. These systems heat water very efficiently. 

172
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
A distinct technical advantage of solar water heating technology is that the 
storage of the collected heat energy is straightforward – all you need is a 
suitable tank. Some collectors, like the black-painted metal barrel mentioned 
earlier, both collect and store the heat. More sophisticated systems collect 
the heat then channel it into a special storage chamber where it stays until 
needed.
There are other advantages as well: Most solar water heaters require little or 
no external power, there is no pollution generated with a solar water heater, 
and the systems are virtually noise free.
Solar water purification systems
Solar water purification systems provide remote villages in third world 
countries with a steady supply of clean, pure water for drinking and cooking. 
Other options don’t even compete in terms of cost and reliability.
A solar water purifier is very simple, in operation. A space is enclosed by 
insulation on the bottom and sides, and a sunlight transmitting window is 
located on top. A water filled trough is located at the bottom. When the sun 
shines through the window it heats the interior of the chamber, and particu-
larly the water in the trough, which evaporates at a speed depending on the 
interior temperature, which is a function of how much sunlight enters the 
space. This vaporized water is free of impurities (much like a still works to 
separate components of a complex liquid) and condenses on the window and 
sides of the enclosure (this is the same effect that causes water to condense 
on a cold glass). A suitable collecting trough gathers the purified water and 
delivers it to a container on the outside of the enclosure.
Utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants
Utility-scale PV plants are large arrays of photovoltaic systems set up by the 
utilities. A combined 1 MW of peak power is now being generated by these 
plants worldwide, with Germany leading in capacity, followed by the U.S. The 
largest system of all is located in Prescott, Arizona, with a capacity of 5 MW 
peak.
Costs for these plants are coming in at around $5 per watt, but some plants 
are more expensive, and produce less net annual production. The economics 
are not competitive with fossil fuels, but because of government mandates 
stating that utilities must produce a certain minimum amount of their total 
power with renewable resources, these large plants fulfill an increasing need. 
With decreases in the cost per watt for solar panels, these plants will become 
much more common.

173
 Chapter 9: Harnessing the Sun with Solar Power
Large-scale solar condenser 
power generators
Large-scale concentrated solar systems use arrays of individually focusing 
mirrors, aimed at either a single point or a line. The concentrated heat can 
be quite intense, depending on the surface area of the mirrors, and the quality 
of the focus. The high heat is used to vaporize some form of liquid, and 
the pressure is used to drive a turbine, which in turn creates electricity. 
Mechanical trackers continuously focus the sunlight onto the solar collector 
or collectors.
Southern California Edison built a 10MW facility in the Mojave desert. It cost 
$140 million, which translates into $14,000 per kW. Fossil fueled plants, in 
contrast, cost around $1,000 per kW, so the economics are not good at this 
point. But since the fuel is free, the long term economics are more favorable 
when lifetime considerations are added to the mix.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of these systems is that they produce a 
majority of their power during the middle of the afternoon, and this helps 
utilities with their peak-power emergencies. Peak-power consumption occurs 
on hot summer days when everybody’s air conditioners are running full bore. 
The utilities cannot keep up with demand, and small-sized backup power 
generators are required. Large scale solar thermal power generators are 
ideal backup generators because they output the most power when the sun 
is highest and hottest, and this is exactly when the most air conditioners are 
being run.
These types of systems are generally built in deserts, where sunshine is prev-
alent and where they’re removed from population centers. 
As with everything, there are a few downsides to these systems:
 
✓ Whenever mechanical parts are in play, reliability suffers, and costs 
rise accordingly. Plus there will be a requirement to have more on-hand 
labor force to deal with the problems. 
 
✓ Building a system requires a tremendous amount of capital. 
 
✓ As with all solar systems, the system output tracks the sunshine avail-
ability, so there is a random element at play.
 
✓ Ultimately, there is a limit to how large a system can be built. In order to 
generate great quantities of power, a good number of individual plants 
would have to be built.

174

Future Prognosis of PV
Solar energy holds a great deal of promise, but in order for that promise to be 
realized on a bigger scale than it is today, the cost issues must be addressed 
so that more people can take advantage of the technology. Widespread use of 
PV will depend on new financing schemes, the best of which are explained in 
the following sections. 
Financing through utility companies
Utilities finance solar PV directly with their customers, and in the process 
the customer pays the utility for the loan, as opposed to buying energy from 
the utility. In this way, the customer builds up value (equity in the home) as 
opposed to simply paying each month for grid power. 
The customer’s suitability for PV will still be a large factor, as some homes 
simply don’t have enough sunshine to make solar work. So the politics of 
mandating this become murky because only those who are lucky enough 
to have suitable homes will qualify for the benefits. Politicians make more 
people happy when luck is not a factor in the equation. And ultimately, politi-
cians run the utilities, which are publically regulated. 
Leasing schemes
Leasing schemes for PV systems are beginning to proliferate. A company 
installs a system, and you pay that company an agreed upon lease amount. 
You then own all the production of the system. These deals are very similar 
to a lease for an auto, with residual value, maintenance responsibilities, and 
so on. The leasing company still owns the system, so if you default on your 
payments they can repossess it.
This works well for solar because the lease payments are usually less than 
the value of the electrical energy that the system produces. Plus, you don’t 
have to lay out a big wad of up-front cash in order to capitalize on solar 
power.
Buying into solar farms
Picture this: A company buys very cheap land in the middle of Nevada, where 
the sun shines nearly every day of the year. They sell you a solar PV system 
and they install it not on your roof or your property, but in a designated plot 

175
 Chapter 9: Harnessing the Sun with Solar Power
somewhere on this very productive land. They can sell you the system for 
much cheaper than the standard contractor price because they install a lot 
of systems right next to each other, and don’t need to go to your home and 
climb around on your roof. They also get steep discounts on parts because 
they buy so many.
The electricity that the system generates is fed into an on-site meter, which 
measures the quantity and credits it to your account. This power is fed 
directly into the grid at the site of the solar farm. 
You own all the production for the system, and the company can move the 
tilt angles of your panels several times a year (they move everybody’s panels, 
so it’s not difficult or expensive) so that the production is optimized. The 
economics of this particular scheme will dwarf any other PV finance scheme 
available. So why hasn’t this happened? Utilities are resistant to anything 
that makes this much sense.
Mandating and amortizing 
New buildings and homes will be mandated to have solar PV systems. In 
some states, like Hawaii, solar hot water systems are mandated. Then the 
cost of the equipment gets amortized into the cost of the home. Commercial 
buildings will see the same types of mandates; it’s already happening with 
energy-efficiency equipment.

Treading Water with Hydropower
In This Chapter
▶ Catching a glimpse of hydropower in the U.S. and the world
▶ Revealing hydropower systems built on river ways
▶ Examining hydropower systems that exploit tides and waves
W
ater is one of the earth’s most important elements, and perhaps its 
most important natural resource. The kinetic energy of a fast moving 
river may be converted into electrical power that can meet the energy 
demands of entire regions. Water may be dammed and stored and the poten-
tial energy tapped to produce electricity. Waves and tides may also be used 
as energy sources. Humans have tapped the power of water for millennia, to 
varying degrees of success.
In this chapter I describe the various technologies used to harness water 
power, and I analyze the pros and cons. The bottom line, at least in the 
United States, is that hydropower has largely been tapped. There are more 
possibilities, but many dams are being torn down, and new ones are not 
replacing these at the same rate so hydropower is actually declining.
The Hydropower Story
Ancient civilizations utilized waterwheels that scooped up buckets of water 
mounted onto rotating wheels. This power fed mills and industrial machines, 
not to mention the pumping of the water itself to nearby urban areas. In the 
sections that follow, I pick up where ancient civilizations left off, taking you 
through a brief history of hydropower, and I walk you through the basics of 
hydropower systems as well as global trends in hydropower production and 
usage.

178
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Hydropower history
At the dawn of the Industrial Age, waterwheels were commonly used to 
power mills and heavy machinery in the Northeastern United States. But the 
power outputs were limited by the availability of the water supply, which can 
fluctuate wildly with weather patterns. In some cases, entire mills were shut 
down during droughts and the unemployed workers could only look to the 
skies in anticipation.
Then came technological advancements that enabled large river damming 
(which allows water flow to be restricted and therefore managed and con-
trolled), advancements in turbine technology, and massive government 
programs that promoted the building of large-scale dams for energy. One 
such project was undertaken by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), cre-
ated during the New Deal–era, to construct dams along the Tennessee River 
in an effort to control floods, improve navigation, and provide electricity to 
residents and industries in the Tennessee Valley. The energy derived from 
damming large rivers with reservoirs and powering huge turbines to create 
electricity is called impoundment hydropower (the water is “impounded”).
During the last century, the demand for electricity has resulted in the dam-
ming of large rivers worldwide, particularly in the developing world. During 
this time period, the U.S. led the world in terms of dam building on large 
scales. 
But today, the well is running dry. There are fewer and fewer opportunities to 
build dams because our major rivers are dammed already. There are ecologi-
cal questions as well. Despite the fact that hydropower emits no greenhouse 
gases (and this is certainly laudable), ecosystems have been drastically 
altered, and this affects not only wildlife but human social systems. As a 
result, new dam construction has virtually been halted.
In 1940, hydropower provided around 40 percent of all U.S. electrical require-
ments. Today, hydropower only provides around 8 percent of the nation’s 
electrical needs, and this number is consistently declining. 
Global trends
Worldwide, over 2,700 Tetrawatt-hours of electrical power were produced 
from 750 gigawatts of hydropower capacity. However, since 1990, hydro has 
seen a drop in production, from 18.5 percent of the total energy output to 
less than 16 percent — this in spite of the increase in dam building in devel-
oping countries. Part of the problem is that fossil fuels are too inexpensive, 
and too abundant. 

179
 Chapter 10: Treading Water with Hydropower
In the U.S.
Impoundment hydropower accounts for anywhere between 7 percent and 12 
percent of total U.S. electrical consumption (or 40 percent of our total renew-
able energy consumption).
The U.S. currently produces 80,000 megawatts of hydro power. Another 
18,000 megawatts is produced in pumped storage systems. While there are 
over 75,000 dams over six feet high in the U.S., only 3 percent are used to 
generate electricity. In addition to these 75,000 good sized dams on its river 
ways, the U.S. has thousands of smaller ones that don’t produce power (what 
do they produce?) This does not include dams built by beavers and young 
boys, which may number in the millions. 
In recent years, a number of dams have been torn down in the U.S. Between 
1999 and 2005 over 120 dams were dismantled and there are a good number 
more dismantling projects underway. At present, there are very few new 
dams on the drawing board in the U.S. The environmental impacts have 
become obvious, plus there are simply no more readily available waterways 
suitable for economical electrical production. 
The declining reliance on large-scale hydropower is a trend that’s unlikely to 
change, as other alternative energy sources are proving more promising. 
In other places around the world
Norway gets all of its electrical production from hydropower, while Brazil 
derives over 80 percent. These countries have rich hydropower resources, 
and their populations are low along the rivers used for the dams. Canada is the 
only industrialized nation that plans on expanding its hydropower capacities.
China’s Three Gorges Dam was recently finished. The environmental impact 
has been staggering, not to mention the number of displaced people. The 
dam will output 18,200 megawatts of electricity, the equivalent of 40 million 
tons of coal annually, or 20 nuclear plants. The dam stretches over a mile and 
features a vertical drop of over 750 feet. If Mother Nature decides she doesn’t 
like the dam, and big earthquake should do the trick.
A quick look at hydropower systems
There are a wide range of hydropower engineering schemes, each dependent 
on the combination of flow and head available at each point on the river. 
 
There are two characteristics that determine how much power or energy can 
be obtained via hydropower: flow, and head. Flow is the amount of water that 
flows past a given point in a given time period. Head is the water pressure, or 
how hard the water wants to flow. A very deep dam has a lot of head pressure.

180
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
Hydropower basically derives from the sun. Solar radiation causes evapora-
tion (mostly from the oceans) and this then condenses into rain, which falls 
over land. Streams form into rivers, and the water flows back toward the 
ocean due to gravity. So hydropower is actually a combination of gravitational 
potential energy and solar energy working in conjunction.
River systems
Traditional hydropower systems use the current of river ways to produce 
power. In impoundment hydropower systems (by far the most common hydro-
power system in use currently), the river is dammed to create a reservoir, 
and then the water is channeled through a turbine that produces electricity. 
With most impoundment dams, the entire river is dammed up so that all flow 
downstream must come through the dam, or the gates. This not only creates 
electrical power, but it serves to control the river’s flow so that flooding may 
be controlled as well.
Less common variations of hydroelectric systems include the following:
 
✓ Diversion systems are basically the same as impoundment systems, but 
they only use a portion of the river’s total potential to generate electric 
power. Much of the water is fed on past the dam/generator so as to keep 
the river as natural as possible. This is easier on the environment than 
an impoundment system, but much less productive.
 
✓ Run-of-river systems simply use the kinetic energy of a fast moving 
water and convert that into electrical power. The head pressure is mini-
mal in this case, but the flow is strong. The river basically runs slower 
after it passes through a run-of-river system. This is generally not as 
environmentally damaging as impoundment and diversion dams.
 
✓ Pumped storage systems generate electricity during peak times, and 
pump the water back into a holding reservoir during off-peak times. 
While these systems, on net, produce negative amounts of energy, they 
are very good at allowing a utility to react to high peak demands, and 
so the economics are actually favorable since high peak-demand power 
comes from inefficient backup generators that cost more per kWh. 
Pumped storage systems can be viewed as huge batteries, capable of 
storing electricity.
 
✓ Small-scale hydropower systems generate a single home’s worth of 
electrical power. This option is on a par with solar and wind power, so it 
will likely see a growth in the coming decades. Small-scale systems obvi-
ously alter the environment much less than the massive impoundment 
dams on big rivers. But if the trend grows too large, aggregate environ-
mental impacts may begin to materialize.

 Chapter 10: Treading Water with Hydropower
Oceanic systems
A great deal of energy is contained in the world’s oceans. Tides move in and 
out with great force that can be harnessed to drive turbines. Waves can be 
“captured” for the vast amounts of energy that move across the surfaces. 
Oceanic systems are not as common as river way dams at this point, but with 
improving technologies, there is much greater promise, and the potential has 
hardly been tapped.
 
✓ Tidal power systems: Tidal power systems (also called tidal barrage sys-
tems) use the power of rising and falling tides to create electrical power. 
When tides come in, the water is captured in a reservoir, or basin. When 
tides go out, a turbine spins and creates electricity. It’s not much dif-
ferent than an impoundment dam, or a pumped storage dam where the 
pumping is done by the tides instead of manmade machinery.
 
✓ Wave power systems: Waves may also be tapped for their energy. In 
these systems, some variation of a float mechanism is used to pump a 
turbine periodically with the rising and falling motion of a wave. Waves 
offer tremendous amounts of energy, but the supply is inconsistent com-
pared to a tidal barrage system.
Both of these systems are minor players in the hydropower game, but with 
the increasing cost of fossil fuel energy sources, research and development 
money is starting to flow. Both of these minor systems offer favorable eco-
nomics and very low environmental risk, so they hold more promise than 
impoundment systems located on rivers.
Impoundment Systems — 
The Big Kahuna
Impoundment systems use a dam to capture and contain water in a reservoir. 
Gates control the flow of the water into a large pipe (called a penstock) that 
feeds the pressurized water into the turbine, which spins an electrical gen-
erator. The water is then discharged back into the river way. 
 
The depth of the reservoir creates head pressure. The deeper the reservoir, the 
greater the head pressure and the greater the potential to generate power. 
The amount of water flowing through the turbine (in combination with the 
head pressure, which depends on the depth of the water in the dam) can be 
varied to control the amount of electrical power output of the hydropower 
generator. 

182
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
The total potential energy that can be generated is a function of how many 
gallons of water are in the reservoir times the head pressure. Low depth, 
wide dams are not as good as high, narrow dams in terms of power output, 
although the total energy potential may be the same.
Impoundment systems are by far the most common type of hydropower gen-
erating system in use. A flowing river with a section amenable to building a 
dam is the only requirement, which explains why this type of system is found 
in over 160 countries worldwide. Because, according to estimates, only a 
third of worldwide hydropower potential has been tapped, the growth in for-
eign hydropower promises to be very high in the next decades. 
Advantages of impoundment systems
The attractiveness of impoundment systems is understandable: Water is a 
renewable source of energy, and the natural rain cycle constantly replenishes 
the water supply, at zero cost. No fossil fuels are needed, and the supply of 
raw fuel is virtually automatic. Hydropower dams also reduce a nation’s reli-
ance on foreign energy sources. Following are some other key benefits:
 
✓ Hydropower is cost competitive with all other energy sources, and in 
many cases it provides the cheapest energy obtainable. As much as 
90 percent of the potential energy of flowing water can be transformed 
into electrical energy, which makes it one of the most efficient energy 
sources. Fossil fuel plants can generally achieve only 50 percent efficien-
cies, at best.
 
✓ Hydropower can be altered very easily in terms of immediate power 
output. Hydropower plants can be easily turned up or down, at will. 
It’s a simple matter to simply lower or raise the gates to decrease or 
increase the flow through the turbines. When load conditions change, 
hydropower plants are the perfect solution.
 
✓ The storage is safe and clean, without the tremendous hazards associ-
ated with fossil fuel storage. Hydropower is unique in that it can both 
store potential energy, then convert it to immediate use. The reservoirs 
can serve the dual purpose of supplying potable water to communities 
nearby. Plus, storing hydropower potential energy results in recreation 
usage, and no other energy source can advertise that advantage. In fact, 
the recreational opportunities that impoundment dams afford may be 
even more valuable than the energy they provide. 
 
 Many dams are built solely for their recreational value. In 1996 alone, 
over 80 million user days were spent fishing, camping, hiking, and boat-
ing above impoundment dams in the U.S.

183
 Chapter 10: Treading Water with Hydropower
 
✓ Large reservoirs, a key component of impoundment systems, help ensure 
consistent energy output despite weather fluctuations. During periods 
of drought, the water contained above the dam will slowly fall in depth, 
but there’s generally enough water to last several months, if not years.
 
✓ Hydropower produces no toxic wastes, pollutants, or carbon dioxide 
and greenhouse gases. There is no pollution generated, in particular 
no greenhouse gases. There are also no sulfur emissions or other sooty 
waste products. There are no fuel transport lines required, other than 
the rivers and streams themselves, and these are certainly much better 
than pipelines and highways full of oil tankers.
 
 In 2000, U.S. hydropower plants offset the burning of 28 million gallons 
of oil, 121 million tons of coal, and 750 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 
In the process, 1.6 tons of sulfur dioxide and 1 million tons of nitrogen 
oxide were spared from the air. Seventy-seven million tons of carbon 
dioxide were also offset, and this may be the greatest advantage of 
hydro over fossil fuels. This savings of carbon dioxide represents the 
emission by 60 million passenger vehicles each year.
These benefits are both blessing and curse, as nations sometimes come to 
blows over water rights. For instance, a nation that’s upriver can dam the 
river, causing undue hardship downriver. What’s the solution?
Environmental impacts 
of impoundment dams
The story is not all a bed of roses, however. There are a range of environmental 
problems associated with impoundment dams, and these factors are becoming 
extremely important as time passes and the effects become more obvious.
Impoundment systems drastically alter a river’s natural ecosystem, both above 
the dam and below. Not only is the river affected, but the riverbanks and all the 
animal communities that rely on the river for water and food supplies.
Submerging millions of acres
Above the dams, large areas are often submerged (known as riparian zones). 
Large dams routinely submerge millions of acres, depending on the depth of 
the water. This displaces not only animals, but human communities can be 
uprooted as well. 
Social conflicts are inherent to dam building. The products of the dam, 
namely electrical power, are generally enjoyed long distances from where 
the dams are located. Local populations become displaced, and they get very 

184
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
little in return for their troubles. The U.S. built a lot of dams on Indian terri-
tories during the 1950s and 1960s, and the hostility that policy engendered is 
still simmering.
Similar situations have occurred more recently in China and Canada. The 
Hydro-Quebec dam in Canada (which supplies both Canadian customers and 
American) flooded 3,800 square miles of land inhabited mainly by an indig-
enous Indian tribe. In China, the Three Gorges project on the Yangtze River 
features a dam spanning over 1.4 miles. The project has displaced over 3 
million people, and so far the environmental damage has been much greater 
than anticipated. There are landslides on adjoining grades that are destroy-
ing entire villages. The impoundment reservoir itself is over 375 miles long, 
which means that people living over the course of this entire span have had 
their lives disrupted permanently.
Fostering algae blooms
The formation of algae blooms is also common above dams, where water that 
once flowed fast is now slowed down or stopped. Solar radiation heats the 
water, and when algae grows in the increased temperature, even more solar 
radiation is captured. The change in water temperature can have an even 
more dramatic effect on the ecosystem than the displacement factor. These 
algae blooms cause certain species of fish to die out. The surface tempera-
ture of reservoirs also increases, while deeper water becomes even colder 
because solar radiation is effectively blocked at the surface. This changes the 
mix of wildlife in dramatic fashion.
Eliminating flooding
While no flooding sounds like a good thing, floods actually play an impor-
tant role in agriculture. A river level varies naturally, and periodic flooding 
naturally enriches and irrigates soil. When dams are built, flooding can be 
controlled. While the human population that lives along the river might like 
this feature, it harms agricultural productivity. Certain species of trees have 
completely died out that were previously prolific along undammed rivers.
Not only do dams interrupt the natural season flows, but the variations from 
hour to hour cause untold environmental havoc as well. Riverbanks become 
eroded by the constant wet/dry cycles. Not only does this cause soil erosion, 
but ugliness may be another obnoxious byproduct.
Disrupting migration of certain species
Disruption of seasonal migrations of certain species of fish could be the 
worst consequence of impoundment dam construction. According to studies, 
the extinction rate of migrating fish exceeds that of all other types of animals. 
This is due solely to impoundment dams. Salmon runs are dwindling, in spite 
of the ladders that are built alongside dams to allow fish to get upriver to 
spawn. The Pacific salmon population has dropped to 300,000 spawning fish 
per year, down from pre-dam levels of over 15 million.

185
 Chapter 10: Treading Water with Hydropower
There is also concern that these ladders are promoting the evolution of 
weaker species. Because the ladders can be easily climbed, even weak and 
sick fish are able to get to the spawning grounds and lay their eggs. The 
result is inferior progeny. 
Building up sediment
Sedimentation occurs when fast moving rivers are slowed down. The sedi-
ment that would normally be carried in the rapid current settles to the 
bottom and gets lodged there. As a result, toxic heavy metals congregate, 
which are ingested by fish and other organisms that humans eat, and the 
concentrations of the heavy metals can exceed safe limits. Periodic dredging 
can help with this problem, but it’s expensive and time consuming.
Aging dams
As existing dams age, they become prone to failures, which can be cata-
strophic for communities downstream. When a dam fails, it’s curtains for 
downstream communities. During a rainstorm in 2003, a safety dike broke 
on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, resulting in the displacement of over 1,500 
people and over $80 million dollars in damage to flooded areas.
Impound advantages over diversion 
and run-of-river systems
Despite the drawbacks of containment dam systems, they do have a number 
of big advantages over their non-containment counterparts: 
 
✓ The power outputs are much larger and serve a larger proportion of the 
population.
 
✓ The cost per watt of output power is lower than other forms of 
hydropower.
 
✓ Non-containment systems fluctuate much more with weather conditions. 
Some non-containment dams are dormant in the summer months, and 
this is at odds with peak-power requirements. The value of a dam’s power 
output depends on when that dam can produce its power, and so non-
containment dams generally command a lower price per watt, on average.
 
✓ There are very few locations where the minimal levels of head pressure 
and flow rate are conducive to non-containment dams.
Small-Scale Hydropower Generators
With access to a suitable waterway (one with a consistent and powerful source 
of flowing water), anybody can dip a small-scale hydropower generator into a 

186
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
moving current and generate electricity. Small-scale impoundment systems can 
also be built, although the economics are difficult to justify, and the regulatory 
burdens are becoming increasingly burdensome.
Most small-scale hydropower generators are used with batteries that store 
extra generated energy, when the dwelling’s consumption does not meet the 
system production. And just like solar, one can tie into the grid with a small-
scale system, thereby negating the need for batteries and also ensuring that if 
the hydropower system isn’t functioning, for whatever reason, uninterrupted 
power will still be available.
The good and bad of small-scale systems 
Small-scale hydropower has a lot of benefits if you’re close to a suitable 
water resource:
 
✓ You can generate more kwH’s per cost than any other alternative energy 
resource, in particular solar PV panels.
 
✓ No batteries are required (although they do make the system work 
better). You can assume your hydro generator output will be pretty 
constant, at least from hour to hour. Over the course of a year, you may 
have major variations.
 
✓ You can install a system of virtually any size power output if your water 
source is big enough, which is usually a requirement for economically 
viable applications. If your water source is small, power outputs will 
fluctuate quite a bit and may be zero for extended periods.
 
✓ You can generate power day or night, in any weather (freezing may 
cause problems, but you can usually design around them).
 
✓ Hydro systems have very long lives, are relatively trouble free, and 
require little maintenance.
 
✓ A submersible hydropower generator (moving water) for $1,200 gets you 
2.4 kWh daily with a 9 mph stream. This is good economics, compared 
to other alternative electrical generating resources.
Small-scale hydropower also has drawbacks to consider:
 
✓ Complex electrical system designs and mounting schemes are difficult 
with water pressures pushing all the time. This is not a trivial system 
design to tackle, although do-it-yourselfers can safely do it if they’re 
patient and willing to try things, then adjust, then try, and then adjust 
until they’ve finalized the best arrangement.
 
✓ Waterways can dry up in droughts and investments sit idle.

187
 Chapter 10: Treading Water with Hydropower
 
✓ Upfront costs are high, particularly for stationary water systems. In 
addition, not many hydro generators are sold because so few people 
have access to a good water supply.
 
✓ In addition to the hydro generator, you need a good inverter to convert 
the raw voltages from the alternator into the standard household volt-
ages that will run your equipment. 
Choosing to use small-scale hydropower
If you’re interested in moving forward, you need to take some measurements 
based on your water source:
 
✓ For moving water: Measure the water flow and speed. Flow is how much 
water passes a given point in a minute. Generally, you won’t be able to 
use the entire flow from a creek or river because that disrupts all wildlife 
functions. You can measure speed by simply tossing a stick out into the 
water and timing its travel over a given distance. 
 
 Measure the distance by pacing it out: one pace is around a yard. An 
approximate measure is good enough, because speed changes so much 
that an accurate measurement gives no better results.
 
✓ For stationary water: You need to devise a pipe system that produces 
maximum pressure. This is a complicated (albeit interesting) subject, 
and you’ll need to find some detailed resources. There are two types: 
high fall (head) – low volume and high volume – low-head. The latter is 
similar in physics to an impoundment dam, where the turbine is located 
a distance below the level of water in the reservoir, while the former is 
similar in nature to the traditional, running water mill type of dam.
Just because you’re next to a river or lake doesn’t mean you have the right to 
use the water for generating power. You also need water rights (legal classi-
fications), which can sometimes be confusing and contentious. Consult your 
county and state water regulating agencies for more details. You may need 
to consult with several different agencies simultaneously, which makes the 
permit process very burdensome, in some cases.
Oceanic Energy Sources
The oceans of the world provide two different types of energy: mechanical 
energy from tides and waves, and thermal energy from solar absorption. 
Thermal energy is relatively constant, while tides and waves vary quite a bit. 
The world’s oceans cover around 70 percent of the planet, and so there is a 

188
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
tremendous amount of energy to be harvested, and it’s renewable to boot. 
The technologies to harness this energy are still immature, but with such 
promise, a lot of investment money is being spent.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, as a response to the Arab oil embargoes, a 
lot of research and development went into devising schemes to capture wave 
and tidal energy. In the U.S. alone, over $30 million was spent developing 
working systems. However, the till dried up in the 1990s and today the indus-
try is small and mostly experimental.
With the price of oil rising, and concerns about greenhouse gases taking 
center stage, the amount of interest in ocean energy is on the rise once again. 
Recent studies indicate that wave and tidal electrical generating systems can 
be economically competitive with fossil fuel energy sources. If cap and trade 
policies are pursued, the economics of ocean energy become very favorable.
Tidal power generators
Twice every day the tides rise and fall, and there is a tremendous amount of 
energy to be tapped from the process. In fact, the process has been exploited 
for thousands of years, as waterwheels were mounted at the mouths of broad 
inlets and when the tides rose and fell the currents drove the wheels.
More recent embodiments include a sluice gate for capturing water at high 
tide within inlets. As the tide falls, water pressure build ups and a turbine/
generator combination is mounted in the moving water to generate electri-
cal energy. The system has the advantage of evening out the erratic flow of 
the tides so that power outputs can be obtained all day long, instead of only 
when the tides are shifting. This system is referred to as an “ebb” system 
because it works when tide is ebbing (going out to sea).
A tidal barrage reservoir is built like a small dam, with control gates that can 
be opened or closed, thereby enabling water to flow between two bodies 
at different depths. As tide comes in, the reservoir is allowed to fill through 
either an external channel, or through the turbine channel. When the tide is 
at peak, the level of water in the basin is the same as the ocean level. When 
tides fall, the control gates are opened and water flows through the turbine 
and the generator creates electric power. Some systems use dual turbines so 
that electricity can be produced both on rising and falling tides.
Tidal currents also flow in the vicinity of irregular shorelines, and these 
may also be tapped for energy sources. Rip currents flow as eddies near 
shorelines, and the water flows can be very powerful and consistent over the 
course of a day. Littoral currents flow parallel to shorelines in response to 
the rising and falling of oceanic tides, and depend on the shoreline composi-
tion. These can also be very powerful.

189
 Chapter 10: Treading Water with Hydropower
Following are some advantages of tidal-electric power:
 
✓ Tides are renewable, sustainable, and predictable. Unlike waves, tides 
won’t disappear for days at a time.
 
✓ Some regions of shoreline feature very large differentials between high 
tide and low. These are ideal locations for tidal-electric generators.
 
✓ Tidal power generators produce no air pollution.
 
✓ A tidal barrage can serve a dual purpose: as a power generator and as a 
roadway over an inlet.
 
✓ Tidal barrage generators are easy to maintain. Existing units have lasted 
over 30 years.
 
✓ The turbines are located entirely beneath the surface, so they don’t 
blight a beautiful environment.
Disadvantages of these systems include the following:
 
✓ Capital equipment is expensive. Up-front costs are very high.
 
✓ The technology is immature since so few of these have been built. This 
entails investment risk.
 
✓ Turbines can be difficult to install, since the best settings feature the 
harshest tides. Setting foundations is particularly problematic.
 
✓ Tidal power plants can affect the surrounding ecosystem. Marine life can 
be killed in the turbines. When large marine life get lodged in the turbine 
it can be a very costly problem to fix (not to mention an ugly problem).
 
✓ Failures of the system can result in flooding of the region around the 
basin.
Wave power generators
There are three main branches of research into wave power generators:
 
✓ Floats and bobbing devices are used to capture the energy in rising and 
falling waves. Existing small-scale units are capable of powering buoys 
and are reliable and consistent.
 
✓ Oscillating water columns in a cylindrical shaft increase and decrease the 
air pressure in the shaft as waves pass by. The pressure differentials are 
used to power a turbine, which is connected to an electrical generator.
 
✓ A wave-focusing scheme constructed near a shoreline directs waves into 
an elevated reservoir. When the water flows back toward the ocean once 
again, the pressure is used to spin a turbine connected to a generator. 
These devices have proven unreliable, and have largely been abandoned.

190
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
The most promising candidate is the oscillating water column scheme.
If you’ve ever been in an amusement park that features a pool with waves, 
you have the basic idea, because this process simply works in reverse. As 
waves pass by the cylinder, the water level rises and falls accordingly. When 
the wave is at a minimum, the pressure in the cylinder decreases and air is 
pulled from the outside ambient, through the turbine, which spins as a result. 
When the wave is at its peak, the reverse occurs. Air pressure increases and 
the turbine rotates in an opposite sense.
The power outputs of the turbine (and generator) vary quite a bit, but that’s 
not a problem with modern high-powered semiconductor circuits. Grid ready 
electrical power is produced at a high efficiency.
Advantages of wave power:
 
✓ The turbulence of the oceans is a renewable energy source. In some 
parts of the world, waves are literally constant, and very powerful.
 
✓ There are no greenhouse gas emissions, nor any air pollution. Nor is 
there appreciable impact on the surrounding ecosystem. In the grand 
context of wave energy, these devices take very little of the ocean’s 
energy. Their existence in an ecosystem is negligible.
 
✓ Wave generators are not expensive to install or maintain, although it is a 
tricky problem to get them anchored to the sea floor adequately.
 
✓ Wave farms can use combined outputs of individual wave generators to 
create large amounts of useable power.
 
✓ Wave generators have very low profiles (in contrast to off-shore wind 
generating systems which are visible for 50 miles in every direction).
Drawbacks of wave generator systems:
 
✓ When there are no waves, there is no electricity.
 
✓ They make noise, a strange sucking noise, when the air pressures 
change and the turbine spins. This may or may not be a problem, as 
some people like strange sucking noises. 
 
✓ Big storms can be powerful enough to destroy a system. Hundred year 
systems are designed to withstand storms that only occur every hun-
dred years, but hundred year storms do happen.
 
✓ Because wave generators feature such low profiles, boats may run into 
them inadvertently. This can be remedied by mounting a mast and flag 
overhead, but then the advantage of being relatively unseen disappears.

Blowing Away with Wind Power
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the fundamentals of wind power design and utility
▶ Getting familiar with large- and small-scale systems
G
lobal air currents originate when the sun heats and cools various parts
of the world at different rates. Winds result as nature attempts to even
 out the disparity. This is more than just an interesting tidbit. It also has 
important implications for wind as an alternative energy source.
It only takes a mild breeze to power an entire city with wind energy, so the 
potential to harness wind power is immense. Wind energy is clean, renewable, 
and homegrown (domestically produced). Above all, wind power is cost effec-
tive and among the alternative energy sources could see the largest growth 
due to its wide range of favorable factors and very short list of disadvantages.
In this chapter I describe the various technologies being used to harness 
wind power. And I analyze the pros and cons.
The Back Story of Wind Power
Humans first used wind power to move their boats well over 5,000 years ago. 
In the Western world, coarse windmills entered the scene at around 200 bc; 
these were used to process grains and other foods. The Chinese used wind-
mills for the same purpose over 2,000 years ago. The Dutch refined windmill 
technology, which was used for draining swamps and grinding food. The 
English also built thousands of windmills for similar purposes.
As the technologies were refined, the number of applications soared. 
Windmills were used for irrigation, milling and processing of manufactured 
goods like spices, and woodworking products.

192
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
In the United States, heavy, cumbersome wooden blades were replaced 
by fabric sails (very much like the sails used on tall ships). Over 6 million 
windmills were built in the United States over the course of the next century 
to pump water on small ranches, mostly in western states where access to 
rivers and streams is limited. Nearly every western movie shows a scene 
with the windmill next to the house, and in fact the push west was made pos-
sible by these windmills because there was no other source of water, in most 
cases.
Electricity was first generated by wind power in 1890. This was made possi-
ble by larger, metallic blades that captured more of the potential wind energy 
and converted it into useable power. The first such windmill had a blade 
diameter of around 50 feet and output only 12 kW’s of power, but it was the 
beginning or a new era in energy production.
As the federal government pursued large hydropower programs in the 1940s 
(refer to Chapter 10), windmills fell out of favor. The national electrical grid 
was being built and people didn’t need localized power sources any longer. 
All they had to do was plug into a wall socket and they had their power. 
Fossil fueled generators were also being built on large scales, and the eco-
nomics was much better than that for wind power. Plus, environmental con-
cerns were minor back in those days.
As a result of the first Arab Oil Embargo in the 1970s, wind came back into 
favor as a locally grown, diversified energy source. Large-scale wind farms 
on an experimental basis originated in California in the 1980s as a result of 
federal and state tax subsidies. Since then, the technologies have advanced 
as computer aided designs allowed for much higher conversion efficiencies 
(the conversion between wind potential energy and output electrical energy). 
Power semiconductors also increased the electrical efficiencies of wind farms 
to the point where the technology could compete price-wise with fossil fuels.
Today, wind offers perhaps the greatest promise of any alternative energy 
source. The power is clean and efficient. There are no greenhouse gas pollut-
ants and wind is available literally everywhere, at some time or another. And 
the cost is low. 
Growing Markets for Wind Energy
Historically, wind power has only been able to fill very small market niches. 
The windmills that pumped water on western ranches fulfilled a vital func-
tion, one that could not be filled any other way, but there has never been 

193
 Chapter 11: Blowing Away with Wind Power
large-scale water pumping using wind energy. And windmills are very local-
ized in that the power they produce is generally available only at the pow-
ered shaft. Windmills used for grinding grain only worked on site. There was 
no way to store the energy, and there was no way to transport it (unlike fossil 
fuels which are easy to transport).
As electrical energy became feasible through advancements in turbine and 
generator technology, however, the scope of the markets has expanded con-
siderably. Now wind power is not only a viable option for individual use, but 
it is a real option for large-scale energy production. 
 
The world’s circulating wind currents are virtually inexhaustible, and wind is 
available nearly everywhere in the world. Of all the alternative energy sources 
available, wind promises the most potential to most parts of the world. It’s the 
most accessible energy source, even more accessible than fossil fuels (which 
must be extracted, refined, and transported).
Wind markets at a glance
Currently, there are four major wind energy markets, ranging from small-
scale wind turbines that virtually anybody can install in their backyard, to 
large-scale wind farms capable of powering an entire city.
 
✓ Small-scale production for remote locations: In some locations, grid 
power (that is, power supplied by a utility company) is simply not pos-
sible due to long transmission line lengths. In these situations, wind 
power is an ideal solution because it’s reliable and consistent, and the 
capital equipment costs are generally low. When wind energy is avail-
able, power is produced; when wind energy is not available, battery 
backup systems provide needed power.
 
 You can find remote wind energy used in off-grid homes, by telecommu-
nications industries to power remotely located cell towers and switch-
ing systems, and in remote villages in undeveloped countries. 
 
✓ Hybrid systems: Hybrid systems combine wind power generators with 
solar systems or hydropower systems to create a more diversified 
energy portfolio. Batteries are usually used as well. By diversifying the 
energy sources, a more consistent supply of power is ensured. These 
types of systems work in remote applications, but are also used with 
grid-connected systems as well.
 
✓ Grid-connected systems: Grid-connected systems are similar to off-grid 
systems — they’re essentially small-scale systems designed to provide 
power for individual needs — except that the output power is connected 

194
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
to the utility grid. When the wind power system outputs more energy 
than the host building uses, excess power is available and can be sold 
back to the utility company, a situation that has resulted in the increas-
ing number of small-scale wind power systems in use. (You can read 
more about the importance of net metering on the economics of wind 
power in the following section.) 
 
✓ Large-scale wind power systems: A large number of individual turbines 
are connected to form utility scale power outputs that can power an 
entire city. You can find out more about large-scale systems in the sec-
tion “Wind Farms: Utility Scale Electrical Production.”
Economics of wind power
Since 1982, the cost of wind power has dropped by an order of magnitude, 
from around 40 cents per kWh to less than 4 cents now. This is less expen-
sive than most fossil fuel energy sources. As a result, the global wind energy 
producing industry has doubled in size every three years since 1990. The rate 
of growth is accelerating. Expect to see a lot of big wind turbines in America’s 
energy future.
Incentives for small-scale wind power systems
Small-scale wind power has proliferated due to net metering laws, as well as 
tax rebates and credits. 
Without net metering, also called intertie, wind power economics would be 
hopeless under most circumstances. Net metering, selling excess energy back 
to the utility, is great for wind power economics because every wind system 
has a certain maximum capacity determined by the total amount of wind that 
blows past a turbine in a given day. While maximum capacity depends on 
a number of things — on a still day, system capacity is much less than on a 
windy day, for example — consumption is governed simply by what you need 
and want. In a typical household, power consumption peaks in the morning 
and evening while wind production peaks in the afternoon when the wind 
blows hardest. With a wind power system tied in to the grid, you can use as 
much power as you need, and your wind system merely contributes when-
ever it can. What you don’t use from your wind system is all sold back to the 
utility.
The government has mandated that utilities not only allow wind power cus-
tomers to connect to the grid, but that they pay the same amount for power 
they receive from wind systems as for the power they dispense to their cus-
tomers. Without the mandates, the utilities would probably not allow wind 
intertie systems at all.

 Chapter 11: Blowing Away with Wind Power
Investment tax credits have also been expanded to include wind production 
systems, so the use of wind turbines by individual homeowners will increase 
over the next few years. While these systems don’t make much of a dent in 
the big picture, like solar, every little bit counts and adds up.
Declining costs of large-scale wind power production
The economics of large-scale wind power production are competitive with 
fossil fuel energy production, with costs per kWh as low as 4 or 5 cents. As 
technologies mature, the price of large-scale wind power has declined and 
wind now competes, without subsidies, with fossil fuel power production. In 
the last two decades alone, the cost of wind power has dropped around 90 
percent. The average cost of utility wind power capital expenditures in 2000 
was $790 per kilowatt (compare this to over $10,000 per kilowatt for solar 
power). When environmental costs are factored into the equation, wind is the 
cheapest form of alternative energy available. 
Enhancing the economics is that wind power can be installed in small incre-
ments. Individual turbines may be installed one at a time, and then connected 
together when the time comes. This makes for easier capital equipment 
budgeting. Very few other alternatives can be built incrementally, with the 
exception of solar, but even then it’s best to install a complete solar system 
upfront. Wind farms can begin producing energy when only a few turbines 
are completed, so the payback is very quickly realized compared to other 
investments (nuclear power plants take ten years to build, and are very 
expensive to boot).
Tracking wind power around the world
In 2003, there were more than 65,000 wind turbines cranking out over 39,000 
megawatts of power the world over. These provided power to around 45 mil-
lion people. This number is up over 300 percent from only a decade earlier. 
Government studies conclude that wind will grow by a factor of 15 in the next 
two decades alone, producing enough power to provide 6 percent of global 
electrical energy needs.
In Europe
Europe leads the world in wind production capacity, with around three quar-
ters of all production. Europe also supplies around 90 percent of the world’s 
wind generating equipment, and so their economy gets a big boost from the 
import dollars flowing in, not to mention all the high-tech, high-paying jobs 
that the industry supports. Currently, wind power comprises around 4 percent 
of all European electrical energy needs. Objectives call for this percentage to 
increase to 22 percent within 20 years. Germany is the global leader in wind 
power, with 14,600 megawatts of capacity, followed by Spain and Denmark.

196

Offshore wind farms are proliferating in Europe. Winds are strong and consis-
tent in many regions, and local opposition is minimal due to the population’s 
appreciation of green energy (Americans take note!).
Stateside
In the U.S., the growth of wind farms has been remarkable over the last two 
decades. Through the 1990s, the American industry has expanded at around 
28 percent per year. Still, despite these impressive numbers, only around 1 
percent of U.S. energy production comes from wind power. There is huge 
growth potential ahead, and investment money is beginning to pour in.
Estimates indicate that three states, North Dakota, Texas, and Kansas (home 
of Dorothy and the infamous tornado) could supply all the electrical con-
sumption of the U.S., if enough wind farms were built. The first large-scale 
off-shore wind farm is being built off the coast of Massachusetts’ Cape Cod. It 
will provide 420 megawatts of power to over 200,000 homes. A utility company 
in Iowa is building a 310 megawatt wind farm. Table 11-1 lists the current wind 
farm production levels, by leading states.

Wind Farms: Utility Scale 
Electrical Production 
The potential for wind power has grown considerably in the last few decades 
due to advances in technology. Utilities are now building large-scale wind 
farms that produce hundreds of megawatts of power. In 2005, the worldwide 

197
 Chapter 11: Blowing Away with Wind Power
wind industry output roughly 17 billion kilowatt hours of electrical energy. 
This displaced around 25 billion tons of carbon dioxide, 58,000 tons of sulfur 
dioxide, and 35,000 tons of nitrogen oxides.
To put wind potential into perspective, if the U.S. were to exploit only 10 
percent of its wind energy potential, we could get rid of 600 coal-fired power 
plants. The wind farms would be located in only ten of our windiest states, 
and would be far from urban centers so the social impact would be minimal.
Large-scale wind power technology
Based on the laws of aerodynamics, large wind turbines convert the kinetic 
energy of wind into electrical power. Large numbers of individual turbines 
are combined electrically so that the power outputs are in phase, and the 
result can be hundreds of megawatts of wind power. There are two distinct 
versions of wind turbines in use.
 
✓ A horizontal axis design is the most common and features an axis 
of rotation parallel to the ground. Figure 11-1 shows an upwind and a 
downwind embodiment of a horizontal axis turbine.
 
✓ Vertical axis turbines consist of a vertical shaft with blades (usually three) 
attached at the bottom and top of the shaft, as shown in Figure 11-2).
In the same way that an airplane works to provide lift for an aircraft, turbine 
blades provide torque to the mounting shaft. Different airfoil designs provide 
varying degrees of performance, and modern blades are far more efficient 
than those built decades ago. Constant improvements in the technology are 
providing better and better blade performances.
Of all the alternative energy technologies that are emerging, wind turbines 
demand some of the trickiest engineering designs. Small changes in nearly 
any aspect of a turbine design can result in major changes in performance. 
This is why there is so much ongoing design and experimentation. At some 
point, there will be enough data available to deterministically lock down the 
most optimal designs. In the meantime, expect to see a lot of different looking 
wind turbines. Following are some of the things engineers have to consider.
Two or three? The blade design question
Three blade designs are balanced in both the vertical and horizontal planes, 
and offer advantages over the imbalanced two blade approach. Three blade 
designs are also more efficient at converting wind potential into useable elec-
trical energy. But two blade designs are lighter, and less expensive so their 
inferior performance may be overcome by economics. At this point, it is not 
clear which version will prove to be the ultimate winner over the long term.

Cut-in and cut-out limits
All wind turbines have cut-in and cut-out limits. Cut in refers to the minimum 
amount of wind necessary to enable the turbine to output power; there needs 
to be a certain amount to overcome the friction of the turbine. Cut out means 
the maximum amount of wind that is safe for operation. 
Below cut-in and the turbine produces no electrical power. Above cut-out 
and the turbine is stopped and faced out of phase with the wind so as to 
reduce the possibility of damage. Optimal speed is usually just shy of the 
cut-out speed, so turbines are generally spinning very fast. The gearbox and 
controller ensures this optimal speed.
Stabilizing the mount and cooling
Heavy duty-scale wind turbines are mounted on tall towers, anywhere 
between 160 feet and 280 feet high. They are typically fixed into huge masses 
of concrete embedded deep into the ground. The torques on the towers can 
be immense, and some early experiments ended in disaster. Many towers are 
guyed (further stabilized using heavy steel cables attached into the ground 
around the turbine tower). 

199
 Chapter 11: Blowing Away with Wind Power
The blade bearings, electrical generator, and cooling means are mounted in a 
housing referred to as a nacelle. Cooling means are necessary due to the high 
power outputs generated in such a small volume. Inefficiencies create heat, 
which must be removed.
Maintaining rotational velocity
Typical systems are designed to rotate at a constant angular velocity of 
around 20 revolutions per minute (RPM) for the entire workable range of 
wind speeds. A constant rotational velocity is desired in order to maintain 
optimum aerodynamic performance. 
As the wind velocity varies, the power output varies but the rotational veloc-
ity remains the same. This is accomplished by using a gear box (much like 
the transmission on a car). As a result, the electrical output of the genera-
tor operates at a constant 60 cycles per second, which is the U.S. electrical 
power standard. In European countries, the outputs are at 50 Hz, or cycles 
per second.
Accommodating wind direction
In order to work optimally, the turbine must be pointed directly into or away 
from the wind. The blades and nacelle rotate to accommodate changes in 
wind direction. Wind speed and direction are determined by an anemometer 
(a device that measures wind speed and direction), which is similar to the 
device that meteorologists use to predict weather patterns. Motors and gears 
rotate the nacelle to ensure it is facing into or away from the wind. Wind 
directions vary on a micro level, and the processor determines the most opti-
mal azimuth (the orientation with respect to north/south — by definition, 0 
degrees is due north, and 180 degrees is due south) at any given time.
In particularly strong winds, the blades are locked into place and the nacelle/
blade assembly is rotated 90 degrees out of phase with the wind in order to 
minimize the torque forces that result from the wind.
Most heavy duty wind turbines operate with the blades facing into the wind 
(refer to Figure 11-1). This is called an upwind design. Other systems are 
leeward, or downwind, designs. There is ongoing debate about which type 
produces more output electrical power over the course of a windy day, and 
so far there is no consensus.
Picking the right spot
Location is critical, and there are areas of the country where winds blow 
nearly nonstop, 24/7. In order to optimize cost effectiveness, a wind turbine 
needs to be in the right location. The potential power output over the course 
of a day is directly related to the amount of wind velocity at a certain site. 

200
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Sites only a hundred yards apart can see big differences in performance, so 
there is a lot of engineering work done in site surveys. The potential energy 
increases by a factor of eight when the wind speed doubles, so it’s highly 
desirable to find regions where wind is not only consistent, but very fast. In 
general, wind speeds increase as altitude increases, so it’s desirable to posi-
tion a turbine at as high an altitude as possible. It’s also common to see wind 
farms mounted on the crest of hills.
Wind speed is defined in terms of meters per second, which is around 2.4 
miles per hour. So a wind speed of 10 meters per second is equivalent to 24 
miles per hour. Most large wind turbines are designed to operate at wind 
speeds from 3 to 4 meters per second up to 20 to 27 meters per second. 
Below 3 or 4 meters per second and the turbine doesn’t spin. Above the maxi-
mum wind speed the turbine begins to lose efficiency, and output energy suf-
fers. At too high a speed, the turbine can become damaged, and this is very 
dangerous in light of the size of modern turbines. Damage usually occurs at 
around 50 meters per second, which is a wind that makes it almost impos-
sible to walk.
A large, modern wind turbine can output up to several megawatts at an 
optimum wind speed of around 25 meters per second. This is a consider-
able amount of power, given the size and footprint of a wind turbine site. 
Efficiencies are now on the order of 25 to 45 percent, with improvements in 
turbine design constantly pushing this number higher.
The best sites for wind farms are generally removed from population centers 
(people don’t like a lot of wind, so cities generally aren’t built in extremely 
windy areas). This means that most wind farms are connected to the grid via 
long transmission lines. Wind turbines are ideal offshore, where winds are 
consistent and strong. This also removes the turbines from sight and from 
human interference. The interaction with ecosystems is also minimized with 
off-shore sites.
The pitch of the blades
Wind turbine blade pitches may be varied so that efficiencies are enhanced 
(airplane propellers and helicopter blades also do this). When winds vary, 
optimal conditions for extracting the kinetic energy also vary. Intelligent 
sensors constantly adjust the pitch of the blades (the angle at which they 
intersect the wind), and when conditions are dangerous they completely 
offset the blades, tucking them away so as to minimize friction forces. 
The total production of a turbine is also related to the surface area of its 
blades, and the torque produced by the blades, so the lengths and breadths 
are increased as much as possible. The longest blades being built today 
are over 300 feet in length. With the latest technologies, individual turbine 

201
 Chapter 11: Blowing Away with Wind Power
outputs now exceed over 4 megawatts (MW). With towers over 30 stories 
high, and blades 300 feet long, a single turbine located in a windy location 
offshore can provide 1,400 homes with power. That’s a lot of power and the 
scope illustrates the great potential of wind power, for there are literally tens 
of thousands of suitable offshore sites on American coastlines.
Other things to know about wind farms
Wind energy has a lot to recommend it: It’s renewable, and the supply is vir-
tually infinite. And wind farms offer several advantages as well:
 
✓ Turbines are maintenance free for long lifetimes. Very little labor is 
required to maintain a large-scale wind farm.
 
✓ Wind energy is distributed, in that it can be created all over instead of 
in a centralized location. The economics don’t suffer when turbines are 
built far apart (aside from the wiring runs). It also increases the diver-
sity of a nation’s energy supply.
Environmental impact
They produce no greenhouse gases or other noxious pollutants, and there’s 
no need for fuel transport into a wind farm, or waste transport out of the 
farm, but that doesn’t mean that large-scale wind power has no environmen-
tal impact. 
Specifically, large-scale wind turbines kill birds, bats, and insects. (Note: 
Small turbines used in residences and remote locations spin much faster than 
large turbines, but the surface areas are smaller, so the probability of a bird 
hitting it are also smaller.) A study done at a large-scale wind farm in Spain 
concluded that over 6,000 birds per year are killed by the turbine blades. As 
a consequence, a $1.6 billion dollar wind farm project in the U.S. was delayed 
by environmentalists (thereby proving that you simply can’t make environ-
mentalists happy, sometimes). In England, a government study resulted in 
the shelving of a large wind farm because it may cause the extinction of a par-
ticular species of coastline waterfowl. Outside of San Francisco, California, a 
study concluded that a large wind farm is responsible for the deaths of over 
5,500 birds annually. This site is also a key site for nesting raptors, and the 
baby birds are being killed at a much higher rate than the adults. However, 
as the turbine blades become much larger, due to engineering advancements 
in materials and aerodynamics, the blades turn slower while producing the 
same amount of power. This will mitigate this problem.
However, to put this into perspective, consider that the Exxon Valdez oil 
disaster in Alaska was responsible for the deaths of over 1,000 times more 
birds than the California wind farm kills in a single year. Which means it 
would take nearly a thousand years for the wind farm to do as much damage 

202
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
as the Exxon Valdez did in that single accident. The point? All things are rela-
tive when it comes to energy sources, and wind farms are far better for the 
environment than fossil fuel plants of any kind.
Forecast: Intermittent winds
The problem, of course, is that wind is intermittent. Like solar, wind energy 
production depends on Mother Nature’s whim. This is clearly not how 
humans use their energy, so wind can never completely displace all other 
forms of energy production unless humanity changes its ways in dramatic 
fashion (who wants to bet on this?). Wind fluctuates in both direction and 
speed. The output of a large-scale wind farm is never predictable. There must 
be backup energy sources, as a result. The backup sources must be capable 
of increasing/decreasing their power outputs to complement the amount 
of power the wind farm is producing, and this limits the number of backup 
options.
Wind turbines are never used to maximum capacity, as a result of the fact 
that winds are inconsistent. The utilization factors are generally only around 
50 percent or less, and in some cases huge investments have been made only 
to have winds decrease in a particular site due to changing climate patterns.
Taking up huge tracts of land
Wind farms require huge tracts of land in order to optimize potential. When 
turbines are located too close together, they tend to detract from each other 
because as the wind passes a turbine, it is slowed down (of course it is; this 
is where the electrical energy comes from). However, the total footprint of 
the individual turbines on a wind farm only occupies around 5 percent of the 
land of the farm, so agriculture and livestock production can go on relatively 
unimpeded below the turbines. I wonder if the cows mind the turbines?
Systems can be damaged or completely destroyed in bad weather. 
Hurricanes and tornadoes play havoc with turbine blades, even if they’re 
rotated to minimize torque forces. Ice storms can also damage blades when 
ice builds up and weighs them down.
Eyesores and other aches and pains
Due to the physics of aerodynamics, it’s necessary to engineer the largest 
blade surface area possible. Large turbines spin slowly, make a swooping 
noise, and are visible for long distances. There is a lot of contention when 
a utility announces a wind farm that can be seen from an urban center. 
Offshore sites can generally be seen from shore, and people don’t like their 
pristine ocean view interrupted by a big, fan-looking thing.
More importantly, however, are the health impacts: Recent studies indicate 
that people who live within a mile of wind farms suffer health issues due to 
the constant noise and vibration of the air. Turbines emit sounds at frequen-
cies that humans can’t hear, but these infrasounds nevertheless affect human 

203
 Chapter 11: Blowing Away with Wind Power
nervous systems and create health problems including migraine headaches, 
sleep deprivation, depression, and anxiety. The solution is to site wind farms 
far from humanity, or exterminate those people living nearby.
Small-Scale Wind Power
Small-scale wind power turbines generate up to 20 kilowatts, under ideal 
conditions. This is enough to power most households in the U.S. Like their 
big brothers on the wind farms, they only generate power when the wind is 
blowing. 
A small-scale wind turbine looks like an airplane with a huge propeller — and 
that’s because that’s what it basically is. Wind pushes the vane (the opposite 
of what happens with an airplane propeller), which turns the propeller and 
forces the alternator (generator) to rotate, thereby outputting AC power. 
Modern units are controlled by microprocessors which optimize the effi-
ciency of the units. 
The vane serves to keep the turbine facing into the wind, for the most part. 
There is some wobbling back and forth, but compared to the cost of using 
an intelligent processor to rotate the turbine directly into the wind, the vane 
works very well. (This is the same mechanism an airplane uses to keep the 
plane oriented directly into its line of flight.)
In large-scale turbines, the rotation speed is held constant by gears and pro-
cessors, but in small-scale systems the speed of rotation is a direct function 
of wind speed. This makes the resulting output power vary quite a bit, so 
special electronic converters are used to translate this varying power into 
useable, residential power.
The smallest turbines (with 6-foot rotors) sell for around $1,000, not includ-
ing installation (tower building and raising, plus wiring and so on). They 
output 400 watts of power at wind speeds of 28 miles per hour (this is a 
pretty good wind) and can withstand winds up to 110 miles per hour. A tur-
bine with a 15-foot rotor produces 3.2 kilowatts at 28 mile-per-hour winds for 
around $8,000, including installation materials but not labor. Fifteen feet is 
big, and the turbine makes a deep swooping noise.
In general, a wind turbine must be mounted at least 30 feet above the ground 
and at least 200 feet away from obstructions. There’s 40 percent more wind 
at 100 feet than at ground level so the higher the better. This creates a real 
engineering problem, as raising a small wind turbine is a formidable job: The 
turbine is heavy enough to kill someone if it falls on them, and if not mounted 
properly, high winds may cause the unit to come crashing down.
There are two ways to use a wind generator: intertie and stand alone.

204
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Stand-alone systems
Stand-alone systems are used in conjunction with batteries. When the turbine 
is cranking out power, the batteries are charging. When there is no wind, the 
household uses the power stored in the batteries. The problem with this type 
of system is one of economics. Batteries are expensive and dangerous, creat-
ing undue risks and chemical contamination possibilities. And the payback of 
a wind turbine investment depends on how much of the energy that the tur-
bine is capable of producing is actually being used by the household. With a 
stand-alone system, when the owner is on vacation for a week, the system is 
not producing any useable power, so the system potential is wasted.
Intertie systems
In intertie systems, there’s no need for battery backup. All of the system’s 
potential is being used, because when the system is outputting more power 
than the household is using, that extra energy goes back into the grid (the 
meter spins backwards and the owner is getting credited by the utility com-
pany). And if the wind turbine goes down or breaks, or there is no wind, 
utility grid power is still available to the household. The economics of grid 
intertie are much better than for stand alone.
Advantages and disadvantages 
of small-scale wind power
Like any wind power system, power can be generated anytime, day or night — 
as long as the wind is blowing. In some locations, wind is virtually a constant 
(magnitudes may vary, but output power is always available). Wind speeds 
vary over terrain, so you can find locations on your property that provide 
maximum potential. Ridge lines, coastlines, and the tops of barren hills are the 
best candidates.
 
Obstructions such as trees, houses, barns, and the like all affect wind speed. 
And because wind direction varies, obstructions in one direction may or may 
not be important in other directions. The best bet is to stay well away from all 
obstructions, and this may be prohibitive because of the topography or layout 
of the site.

205
 Chapter 11: Blowing Away with Wind Power
Wind is available almost everywhere, in all climates. In many of the worst 
climates, it’s very powerful. That being said, extremely high wind conditions 
may destroy or damage a unit. Turbines want a minimum amount of wind to 
begin working, but they also don’t want to be subjected to tornadoes. Unlike 
with large-scale turbines, small turbines don’t include a safety feature that 
tucks the blades away during potentially damaging wind. And unfortunately, 
a lot of small turbines are installed by inexperienced hands, and this makes 
the danger even more pronounced.
Rotors are noisy and obtrusive when they’re spinning (which they’re hope-
fully doing quite a bit). The bigger the blades, the more power they’ll gener-
ate, but they also make more noise because they’re in contact with more air. 
In some communities, you may be prevented from installing a wind turbine 
due to noise and visual blight issues. You may like that big propeller whirring 
away in the sky, the noisier the better, but neighbors may take a dim view.

Digging into Geothermal
In This Chapter

▶ Generating electricity with geothermal energy sources
▶ Using geothermal energy directly via heat pumps
G
eothermal energy is the only completely renewable energy source from 
the earth itself. It’s used to heat and cool buildings, as well as generate 
modest amounts of electrical power. A well designed geothermal system is 
perhaps the most environmentally friendly source of energy possible. And 
perhaps best of all, geothermal energy is completely domestic in supply, reli-
able, renewable, sustainable, and versatile in that it can be used to both heat 
and cool directly as well as generate electrical power.
More than 70,000 times more energy is available in the earth’s upper crust 
than all of the potential energy in the fossil fuel reserves previously discov-
ered. Even accessing a small fraction of what’s available would make a major 
dent in our reliance on foreign oil. And with each new geothermal source 
brought on line, our pollution problems are mitigated. While geothermal will 
never be a major player in the grand energy drama, every little bit counts, 
and geothermal is best when it’s done small scale, so it’s available to a lot of 
users.
In this chapter I give you a lowdown on geothermal energy sources and how 
they’re used to generate useable energy, both big and small-scale. 
Geothermal Energy Basics
“Geo” is a Greek word meaning “earth,” and “therme” means “heat.” Geothermal 
energy originates in the inner mantle of the earth as hot molten magma (liquid 
rock) circulates upward while surface groundwater seeps downward. The 
magma heats the water and forces it back up through cracks and faults. In 

208
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
liquid form, this geothermal energy is referred to as hydrothermal. If you were 
to drill a well down into this heat, you’d tap into an incredible amount of free, 
completely natural energy. 
The earth’s core is estimated to be around 8,000 degrees Fahrenheit 
(nobody’s actually measured it, of course), and this heat is constantly radi-
ated out toward the earth’s surface. In fact, the heat bubbles right up to the 
surface in some places (hot springs and geysers, for instance). Turns out 
Mother Nature is truly a hot babe, when you get right down to it (or right 
down into it).
For every mile of depth below the surface, the temperature increases around 
80 degrees Fahrenheit. In some areas, the temperature rises much faster, 
making available a lot of heat energy just below the surface. Tapping into 
this energy requires drilling down into the earth’s crust, much like the drill-
ing processes that are used to extract oil and natural gas. In some cases, the 
hydrofluids are under high pressures, and there is no need to pump the fluids 
to the surface because they will just spew out. In other cases, active pumping 
systems must be used to extract the fluids up to the surface.
Where you can find geothermal energy
Geothermal energy sources are available literally everywhere in the world. 
Given the role of magma in generating geothermal heat, you probably won’t 
be surprised that volcanic regions offer the best potential for geothermal 
energy. Geologically stable regions, or high altitudes, often offer poor poten-
tial as geothermal energy sources. Still, some high-altitude regions that don’t 
have any volcanic activity — like Wyoming and South Dakota — have very 
pronounced geothermal potentials.
Classifications
Geothermal fields are classified depending on the temperatures, which vary 
between 194 degrees Fahrenheit to over 300 degrees Fahrenheit:
 
✓ High-grade sources: Above 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures can 
go as high as 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit, which implies a tremendous 
amount of energy recovery. High grade sources are most abundant in 
the U.S. western states and Hawaii. 
 
✓ Medium-grade sources: Between 300 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit and 
generally found in the southwestern U.S.
 
✓ Low-grade sources: Between 212 and 300 degrees Fahrenheit and may 
be found anywhere. 

209
 Chapter 12: Digging into Geothermal
Different temperatures require that different engineering methods be used 
to exploit the energy. As temperatures increase, pressures increase as do 
danger levels from the hydrofluids. To prevent scalding and the unintentional 
releases of superhot steam, the piping systems need more integrity and more 
safety interlocks.
Tapping into hard to reach places
While geothermal energy sources are available everywhere in the world, 
some areas — those deep beneath rock terrain, for instance — are simply too 
difficult and expensive to tap into. 
As technology progresses (in particular, the same drilling technology con-
stantly being advanced by fossil fuel recovery) geothermal will become more 
widespread and economical.
Dealing with water sediment
Water is an ideal medium for moving thermal energy. Yet the water itself can 
present a problem. Because the water has been trapped inside the earth’s 
crust for so long, it generally has a lot of sediment and mineral buildup, 
which causes engineering difficulties that are hard to overcome. Because of 
the high sedimentary buildup, geothermal fluids are referred to as brines, and 
they’re very reactive: They tend to corrode and decay metallic based equip-
ment very quickly. Although ways have been devised to remove the impuri-
ties from the fluids, they are expensive and time consuming.
Brine contains several potential sources of environmentally damaging con-
taminants: Hydrogen sulfides (H2S), ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide (not 
that again!), sulfur, vanadium, arsenic, mercury, and nickel. Closed loop sys-
tems (those that return the pumped fluids back into the ground) return these 
materials to the earth, where they came from, while open loop systems (those 
that dump the used hydrofluids into a river or onto the ground) expose these 
contaminants to air and surface water. 
All these contaminants come from the earth; the problem with returning them 
to the earth is their relative concentrations. Ecosystems are all local, and when 
geothermal sources are tapped, it’s important to return the pumped sources of 
heat energy close to the well sites. For this reason, closed systems are favored 
by environmentalists.
Geothermal uses
There are two main ways to use geothermal energy: to produce electricity 
and to directly heat (or cool) individual homes and businesses. 

210
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
✓ To produce electricity: Geothermal energy sources can be used to 
produce electricity through a variety of methods: dry steam produc-
tion, flash steam production, and binary-cycle production. You can read 
more about this process in the section “Creating Electrical Power With 
Geothermal Sources.” 
 
✓ To heat and cool individual homes and businesses: Directly heating 
individual structures with geothermal energy is a very simple process: 
The hydrothermal liquid is simply piped through a radiator system 
within the building. 
 
Although direct use requires a completely different process than electricity 
production, both still use the same fundamental physics of heat transfer. Heat 
is moved via conduction, which means that the heat moves from the pumped 
fluids into radiators and coils that then transfer the heat into the air within a 
dwelling.
Economics of geothermal energy
Geothermal energy has a lot going for it in terms of economics: There are 
no raw fuel costs, nor are there any transportation difficulties. Maintenance 
costs are generally very low, depending on how much sediment is present in 
the heated liquids drawn from the earth. A typical geothermal electrical gen-
erating plant is very self-sufficient, compared to other options. Once it’s up 
and running, a geothermal plant can output at full capacity consistently for 
up to 20 years.
The main factors affecting the economics of a geothermal energy source 
include the following:
 
✓ Flow rate and pressure: How quickly and with how much pressure the 
hydrofluid moves impacts the type of piping system that must be used. 
 
✓ Ease of getting to the source: How easy or difficult it is to access the 
heat, given the geological features — rock, soil, and so on — in the area.
 
✓ Location: Some locations are much more difficult to tap into. For 
instance, if there is a lot of rock, the drilling process is very costly.
 
✓ Demand level: How competitive geothermal is, price-wise, compared to 
the market price of other energy options.
 
✓ Capital equipment costs: The costs associated with drilling machinery 
and pumping equipment. Drilling through rock requires much more 
expensive equipment. Drilling long distances also requires more expen-
sive equipment. 
Small plant capital costs are estimated at around $2,500 per kW of output, 
depending on the accessibility of the geothermal source. Large plant costs 
are much lower, at around $1,600 per kW; a 30 megawatt plant, for example, 

211
 Chapter 12: Digging into Geothermal
would cost around $40 to $80 million dollars to build. Costs per kWh of pro-
duction vary anywhere between 8 cents to over a dollar (this latter number is 
very high).
In individual homes or businesses, using geothermal energy directly to heat 
or cool can reduce an HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) bill 
by up to 65 percent, although the upfront equipment costs for residential 
heat pumps are generally higher than for other types of equipment. 
Creating Electrical Power 
with Geothermal Sources
Some power plants uses geothermal sources to generate electricity. At pres-
ent, only around a quarter of a percent (0.25) of the world’s electrical energy 
comes from geothermal sources. Table 12-1 lists the top five nations’ electric 
geothermal outputs.

In the U.S., geothermal provides 2,200 megawatts of electric power, and com-
prises 10 percent of nonhydropower, renewable electricity production. This 
is enough to power 1.7 million homes, or the equivalent of four nuclear power 
plants. However, only four states use this power: California, Hawaii, Utah, and 
Nevada. California alone derives 6 percent of its power from geothermal sources.
The actual production of geothermal is a very small percentage of its poten-
tial, however. Estimates by the Department of Energy (DOE) indicate that up 
to 10 percent of the U.S. electrical power could be generated by geothermal, 
with minimal environmental impact. The reason geothermal is still a small 
player is that upfront capital equipment costs are high compared to alterna-
tives, particularly fossil fuel.
Alaska and Hawaii hold the most potential for geothermal exploitation. Most 
of the western half of the United States offers economical potential for geo-
thermal power plants. A study done by the United States Geological Survey 

212
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
concluded that over 20,000 megawatts of power are available in the west-
ern states, and this number could expand by a factor of five if engineering 
advances were made that could make use of liquid temperatures lower than 
the current requirements.
Types of electricity-generating systems
There are three major ways to use geothermal energy to produce electricity 
on a large scale (small-scale generators also work, but aren’t economical com-
pared to other alternative energy options, so they are far and few between). 
The type of system used in a particular application depends on the quality of 
the source, chiefly the temperature and quantity of the heated fluid. 
Dry steam power plants
Dry steam reservoirs are huge manifolds of very hot steam within the earth 
(in the absence of water), generally at low pressures, although sometimes the 
pressures can be extremely high. While these conditions are rare, it’s very 
easy to use this energy source to extract useable power. If possible, these are 
the most economical geothermal sources. Capital equipment costs are lowest 
for this type of plant because the process for extracting the heat is so direct 
and straightforward.
A production well must be sunk deep enough to tap into subterranean 
rocks with temperatures higher than the boiling point of water (212 degrees 
Fahrenheit). A pipe system channels the dry steam to the surface, where it’s 
fed into a turbine/generator combination which produces electrical power. 
The steam, which has cooled considerably as it passes through the turbine, 
is injected back into the earth’s core via a separate well called the injection 
well. Note: The production well and the injection well need to be far enough 
apart so that they don’t interfere with each other (if they are too close, the 
fluid will simply circle around). 
Flash steam power plants
Flash steam power plants tap into liquid heat reserves in the earth’s crust. 
The water pressures are very high, so it’s easy to draw the liquid to the 
surface. The temperatures of useable wells are generally above 360 degrees 
Fahrenheit, which makes for some dangerous conditions. 
As with dry steam (explained in the preceding section), a production well is 
used. This time, instead of drawing dry steam, it draws heated liquid. Around 
40 percent of this hot water immediately converts into steam when the pres-
sure is released in the flash tank, and this is used to drive the turbine/genera-
tor, which produces electrical power. 

213
 Chapter 12: Digging into Geothermal
These systems require more capital equipment and backup equipment than 
the dry-steam plants because the machinery is more complex (basically it’s 
two separate systems interacting with each other), and as a result don’t pro-
duce as much useable power per dollar of investment. Maintenance is more 
expensive as well.
 
Flash steam power plants, when placed on a coastline, can be used to desali-
nate water supplies for drinking and irrigation. This is a completely natural 
result of the fact that distillation occurs when water is boiled to vapor.
Binary-cycle power plants
If a liquid geothermal source temperature is below around 360 degrees 
Fahrenheit, a binary-cycle system is in order. These systems have two 
independent closed loops; the production well/injection well loop, and the 
generator loop. A heat exchanger transfers the heat from the well loop into 
the generator loop, where the turbine/generator produces electrical power. 
Having two separate systems generally implies inefficiency.
Binary-cycle systems are economical when there is enough hydrofluid to 
justify the cost of the capital equipment. Sometimes wells dry up, and this 
results in a big waste. For this reason, these types of generators are more 
risky than the other two types.
Things to know about geothermal 
power plants
Geothermal energy has quite a bit going for it: The supply of energy is virtu-
ally limitless. There are no toxins or pollutants generated in the process of 
either using geothermal energy directly or as a way to generate electricity. No 
fuel has to be transported to or waste material transported from the site — an 
incredible advantage over other large-scale electrical energy sources. 
 
Geothermal energy is considered renewable since the source is so immense. 
But, strictly speaking, when the heat is removed and the liquid or steam is 
pumped back down into the earth, there is a permanent change in the earth, 
and so geothermal is not renewable. But the change is so minute in the grand 
scheme of things that it’s virtually negligible.
Finding a suitable site
As stated earlier, the supply is practically limitless . . . if a suitable site is 
identified and tapped. Finding suitable sites is sometimes very difficult. And 
if the suitable site just happens to be near an urban area, it’s hard to get the 
necessary permits.

214
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Locating suitable sites is more of an art than a science, in a lot of cases. It’s 
not much different than locating oil or natural gas reserves, and there’s no 
way of measuring with any accuracy the true potential. So investments inevi-
tably take some guesswork, and this increases the financial risk.
Self-sustaining plants 
Geothermal power plants are self-sustaining: They don’t need external 
sources of energy for pumping or generation. A small amount of electricity 
may be required to get the initial pump phase in gear, but once the system is 
producing its own electricity, it’s completely self-sustaining.
In addition, the operating costs are minimal, aside from routine equipment 
maintenance. Power plants can be run with almost no labor costs.
Plant safety
Plants are safer, in relation to most fossil fuel power plant generators. There 
is almost no risk of explosion and leaks aren’t nearly as noxious as with fossil 
fuel generating plants because the leaked material comes from the earth and 
goes right back to the earth.
However, on rare occasions flammable vapors and liquids may come out 
through the production well, and these can be very dangerous and difficult to 
extract out of the heat source. When this happens, extra costs are incurred 
to ensure safety.
The risk? Running cold
There is an inherent risk in building an expensive geothermal plant because 
they sometimes “run cold,” which means that the heat source begins to dis-
appear. Natural changes in the subterranean environment occur regularly 
(as the earth shifts). These can manifest in two ways: The temperature of the 
geothermal source can begin to fall, thereby making useable energy produc-
tion more inefficient, or the quantity of fluid available can decrease. Pressure 
may also decrease, meaning it takes more energy to extract the heated fluids.
Using Geothermal Energy 
Directly: Heat Pumps
There has been a shift in the use of geothermal from producing electrical 
power to using the heat directly to warm homes and buildings. Using geo-
thermal energy directly is very simple: You just use the hot water to heat 
something, either a home or the ground. There’s no processing required 

215
 Chapter 12: Digging into Geothermal
and no electrical production. Today, direct use systems provide over 18,000 
megawatts of power in over 60 different countries. The current worldwide 
direct geothermal capacity heats over 3 million homes. 
Direct-use geothermal systems can be used in many ways, including: 
 
✓ Heat a single home, or an entire community. 
 
✓ Warm the water used on fish farms, thereby increasing productivity 
rates. Warmer water also allows for the propagation of species that 
would normally not be found in certain regions. (Hmm . . . As an envi-
ronmentally conscious citizen I wonder if this is really a good thing? 
Perhaps this is fooling with Mother Nature a little too much?) 
 
✓ Heat greenhouses the world over. This may be one of the most common 
uses of direct source geothermal because greenhouses take a lot of 
heat due to their poor insulation properties. Other greenhouse heating 
options are prohibitively expensive, in comparison.
 
✓ Pasteurize milk.
 
✓ Dehydrate fruits, vegetables, and grains.
 
✓ In agricultural applications, geothermal heat is used to warm underlying 
soil, making for better crop production. The heat also serves to sterilize 
the soil, to some extent. In some cases, both irrigation and heating can 
be accomplished in a single operation.
 
✓ The health of livestock has been improved by using geothermal heat to 
both sanitize and temperature regulate holding pens.
 
✓ Heat can be pumped through sub-surface piping systems beneath roads 
and walkways to prevent ice-buildup in the winter.
Direct geothermal heat, when engineered properly, may be used in several 
phases, increasing the overall efficiency of the process to impressive levels. 
For instance, when first extracted from the ground, the highest temperature 
fluids can be used to drive power plants. The exhaust fluids, which are now 
cooler in temperature, can then be used to heat buildings and finally the even 
more cooled fluid can be pumped into the ground beneath agricultural fields.
It may be true that of all the energy sources available, direct use geothermal 
energy is the most efficient and cleanest source of all. The issue is one of 
availability: either you got it or you don’t.
What direct-source systems need
When geothermal heat sources are available, they can be used to channel 
hot water directly through buildings to provide heat in a completely natural, 
inexpensive fashion. These sources are generally found at around 50 degrees 

216
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Viable regions for these types of heat sources are 
more widespread than the sources used for power plants because the use-
able temperature ranges and pressures are less restrictive. To heat a building 
with a direct source of geothermal, the temperature only needs to be hotter 
than the desired temperature of the building. 
Three things are needed to make direct-source systems viable:
 
✓ A well: The well is used to bring the hot water to the surface. This well 
must have sufficient pressure and flow to overcome the cost of drilling 
the well, and pumping the water out. In many cases, the heated fluid is 
pressurized enough so that simply tapping into the reservoir will yield 
sufficient fluid flow without external pumping means.
 
✓ A mechanical engineering system: This is used to pump and distribute 
the water in order to maintain the proper temperatures in the buildings. 
Temperature probes and valves are required, along with piping systems 
and filters to prevent sediment buildup.
 
✓ A way to dispose of the water: Disposal of the used water can be a prob-
lem. It’s usually pumped back down into the earth, but it can also be 
discharged into a pond, or even into the environment (on the ground). 
In the latter case, there is some danger of environmental damage, and 
ecosystems can be permanently altered. But if the amount of discharge 
water is small enough, the environment can usually absorb the extra 
heat (and sediment) without risk.
In other words, geothermal energy uses pumps and compressors to move 
heat from the environment into a home, or vice versa. No combustion takes 
place, and no internal components get really hot, as opposed to electric fur-
naces in which very hot grids transfer heat to the air moving over the grids.
 
Heat pumps are very efficient when compared to other heating and cooling 
sources, but they are limited in the amount of power they can produce. For 
that reason, heat pumps work best in moderate climates.
How heat pumps work
The heat pump cycle begins as low temperature liquid refrigerant passes 
through a heat exchanger (evaporator) and absorbs heat from a heat source 
(either the ground or air). The refrigerant evaporates as the heat is absorbed, 
and becomes a gas (vapor). The refrigerant then passes through a compres-
sor, where it is pressurized. The temperature is raised to over 160 degrees 
Fahrenheit (this varies quite a bit, but 160 degrees is a typical value). 
This heated gas then circulates through another heat exchanger where heat 
is removed from the gas (vapor) and transferred to water or air that circu-
lates into the home or building. Hot air duct systems transfer heat into the 

217
 Chapter 12: Digging into Geothermal
air, or hydronic distribution systems transfer heat into the building’s founda-
tion or walls. The temperature of the heated air is usually around 100 degrees 
Fahrenheit, which is not as hot as combustion systems are capable of, but 
hot enough to heat a room given enough time to do the job.
As it loses heat, the refrigerant gas changes back to a liquid, which is in turn 
cooled as it passes through the expansion valve. The cycle is complete, and 
ready to go again. 
The process is reversible, and both directions offer around the same effi-
ciency levels.
 
✓ During a heating cycle: In either ground- or air-based systems, the fluid 
circulates through the loop, extracting heat from the ground or air. Then 
this heat is sent to the geothermal unit, where it’s compressed and deliv-
ered to your home via your normal duct work or through a radiant heat-
ing system. 
 
✓ During a cooling cycle: The heating process is simply reversed: The 
unit removes heat from the home, then circulates it through the ground 
or air where it’s cooled by the ground or air temperatures.
Types of heat pumps 
There are two distinct types of heat pumps: air-source heat pumps and 
ground-source heat pumps. Each work essentially the same way (they trans-
fer heat from the source — whether ground or air), and which type of system 
is best depends on weather and environmental conditions.
 
A heat pump simply moves heat from the outside environment into your 
home, or vice versa. Heat transfer works in both directions; you can both heat 
and cool a home using a geothermal system.
Air-source heat pumps
Air-source heat pumps are the kind you see in stand-alone HVAC systems. 
They use ambient air to heat or cool a refrigerant contained in a compressor 
system. They are especially suitable in moderate climates, as they perform 
both heating and cooling functions with reasonably good efficiency.
A geothermal air system takes advantages of the fact that air, regardless of its 
temperature, still contains some heat.
With an air-source heat pump, outside air is drawn across the exterior coil 
by the fan. Refrigerant fluid is run through the exterior coil, and into the com-
pressor where it is pressurized and heated. On the other side of the compres-
sor, a closed loop of fluid is run through the interior coil and interior air is 
passed over this coil by the interior fan. 

218
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
Although air-source heat pumps require an expensive upfront investment in 
equipment, they’re the less expensive type of heat pump to install. And 
because installation is relatively easy, you can get a wider variety of qualified 
installers to give you a bid. Competition is always a good thing.
Ground-source heat pumps
Ground-source heat pumps are very similar to air-source heat pumps, except 
they use the earth as their heat exchange medium. They are more efficient 
than air-source pumps because the earth is much more consistent in terms 
of temperature. Note: Geo-exchange is the common name for ground-source 
heat pumps. It’s just a matter of terminology, but you’ll see both terms (geo-
exchange and ground-source heat pumps) in use. 
Geothermal ground-based systems circulate a water-based solution through 
a loop system that’s buried underground. Water (lakes, streams, and so 
forth) can also be used as the exchange medium for ground-based geother-
mal systems, but this is rare because water temperature changes more than 
land temps, and water is harder to access than earth (very few people have a 
ready access to a suitable supply). However, when a good source of water is 
available, it can make the process very efficient. 
With a ground-source heat pump, fluid is pumped from the ground (or from a 
suitable water reservoir) through the compressor and the heated fluid passes 
through a coil arrangement inside the dwelling. A fan draws air through the 
intake vent (which normally includes filters of some kind) and over the coil, 
thereby heating the air. The fluid, which is now cooler, is pumped back into 
the earth via a discharge well. 
Heat pumps in extreme climates 
In extreme climates, a ground-sourced heat 
pump with a radiant heating system in the floor 
is a great combination because you can simply 
heat water directly, and this heated water is 
then pumped through the floor grid of the radi-
ant system. You can also use that hot water gen-
erated by the ground-source heat pump in your 
domestic supply, thereby killing two birds with 
one stone (although killing birds is probably not 
strictly in sync with the green mantra). Radiant 
heat is very quiet, and in combination with the 
quiet ground-source heat pump, your home will 
be virtually silent and without moving air. (Note: 
If you use a forced-air duct system in conjunc-
tion with a ground-source heat pump, you need 
extra equipment — which costs more — to con-
vert the hot water into hot air, as well as to move 
the hot air through the ducts.) Be aware, how-
ever, that using radiant heat in your floor doesn’t 
work very well for cooling in the summer.

219
 Chapter 12: Digging into Geothermal
Ground-source heat pumps work very well and can be installed in almost all 
climates because ground temperatures are very stable compared to air tem-
peratures, so the heat source is very consistent. But the capability comes at a 
price: Ground-source heat pumps are expensive because they require exten-
sive piping systems be dug into the ground. These systems allow maximum 
contact with the earth that’s used for the heat exchange. The most common 
ground-source heat pump options are open- and closed-loop piping systems.
An open-loop system uses existing ground water, while a closed-loop system 
has its own dedicated fluids and the heat is moved via exchange. In many 
areas, the ground water is very sedimentary (because of mud, minerals, salt, 
and other reasons) and therefore unsuitable for open-loop systems, which 
are less expensive to install. 
The efficiency of heat pumps
The efficiency and power output of a heat pump is a function of the outdoor 
temperature (the ground or air used as the source). When outdoor air tem-
peratures are extremely low, heating is less efficient, and in very cold climates 
air-source heat pumps may simply not be able to output enough heat to warm 
a dwelling. Likewise, when outdoor temperatures are extremely hot, the cool-
ing efficiency of a heat pump suffers. With ground-based heat pumps, the 
efficiencies are relatively immune from the weather because ground tempera-
tures do not vary much over the course of a year. (The effects of the seasons 
are nonexistent about 6 feet underground. In northern states the ground stays 
at a consistent temperature of around 50°F, which is a lot warmer than the air 
aboveground in the winter months. In hotter climates, the ground can be as 
warm as 70°F year-round.)
In general, heat pumps do not heat and cool nearly as quickly as separate 
units, in particular combustion heat sources can provide a lot of heat very 
quickly. However, due to their inherent efficiencies, heat pumps that run con-
stantly are often more economical than combustion heaters which constantly 
cycle on and off. 
In addition to heating and cooling, heat pumps can also provide:
 
✓ Domestic hot water supply
 
✓ Air filtration
 
✓ Humidity control
The ability to provide all of these functions simultaneously makes heat 
pumps very economical and efficient in many applications.

220
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
The commonly used rating for a heat pump is the “ton,” which has nothing to 
do with weight. This term is a holdover from the days when refrigeration units 
were used to make ice. A 1 ton unit could make 1 ton of ice per day. To bring this 
into modern terminology, a 1 ton heat pump can generate around 12,000 Btus of 
cooling per hour at an outdoor temperature of around 95 degrees Fahrenheit, or 
12,000 Btus of heat at 47 degrees Fahrenheit outdoor temperature.
Advantages of heat pumps
Heat pumps have their share of pros and cons. On the plus side, heat pumps 
tout the following characteristics.
 
✓ They offer steady, even heat and cooling. Fluctuations in temperature 
are smaller compared to traditional combustion and air-conditioning 
equipment, and this increases comfort. With combustion sources, the 
walls and floors and furniture are often cold while the air is hot, and the 
air tends to move faster with combustion type heaters because of the 
increased power outputs. Moving air tends to make people feel colder 
than the actual temperature (convective cooling removes heat from 
the skin).
 
✓ They take up less space than traditional combustion equipment 
because of their two-for-one advantage (they can both heat and cool). 
Plus, there’s no need for a chimney or venting system because there’s 
no combustion (they still may use ductwork to distribute the heat, but 
radiant systems are more common because they are a natural partner). 
 
✓ They’re safer and cleaner than other options. They don’t create on-
site air pollutants like smoke, carbon monoxide, and so forth. Nor do 
they create ashes or creosote. No combustion occurs, and none of the 
components become extremely hot. A malfunctioning heat pump won’t 
endanger a building’s occupants; it’ll just freeze them out.
 
✓ They require more maintenance than some other options. Systems 
require a number of parts, and heat pumps are more complex than com-
bustion systems. If you look inside an air-source heat pump, you’ll see 
what looks like the space shuttle. Nevertheless, heat pump technology 
is mature and getting better all the time. If you buy new equipment, the 
quality will be good in terms of both design and implementation.
 
✓ They require electricity — sometimes a lot. This not only affects energy 
efficiency, depending on how you’re getting your electricity (nuclear 
source, combustion source, and so on) but it also means that in a power 
outage you’re outta luck.

Exploring Biomass
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding what biomass is and how it works as an energy source
▶ Looking at large- and small-scale biomass applications
▶ Finding out about biofuels
I
n many parts of the world, biomass is the chief source of energy. A third 
of the world’s population burns forest products, animal dung, and other 
organic matter as part of their daily ritual of living. In the industrialized 
world, biomass plays a large role in home heating and it is seeing increased 
use of biomass for electrical generation and as a substitute for conventional 
fossil fuels. 
The growth of the biomass industry is perhaps the highest of any of the alter-
native energy industries due to the versatility of applications and the universal 
availability of biomass raw products which would otherwise be wasted. For 
instance, wood pellets are made of waste products from the forest industry, 
and methane gases are produced from cow manure. 
Common sources of biomass include trees and grasses, crops and crop resi-
dues, aquatic and marine plants, manure and sewage, and landfill (paper, 
cardboard, cut brush, and discarded food). With advances in technology, 
there are even more possibilities on the horizon.
This chapter looks at both the current state of biomass energy and its future 
as a significant player in the alternative energy field, and explains large- and 
small-scale biomass energy options, as well as biofuels. 
Biomass Basics
Traditionally, biomass has been used for heating and cooking. But this 
traditional use of biomass products only taps the surface of the potential. 
Machines are being developed that can burn municipal garbage (certainly an 
inexpensive energy source) and agricultural waste like worn tires, plastics, 

222
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
sewer byproducts and forest and corn husks and the like. Efficient machines 
are also being developed that can create large-scale electrical production 
from biomass products.
Biomass is a renewable form of energy because it derives from the photosyn-
thesis process in which plants convert the sun’s radiant energy into carbo-
hydrates (as opposed to hydrocarbons, which comprise fossil fuels). When 
plants are grown specifically for use as biomass, they also constitute a form 
of energy storage. Biomass can be described as “stored solar energy.”
 
In general, biomass refers to organic matter of any kind, whether forest prod-
ucts or agricultural production or simply the plants that grow on the surface 
of the earth. These are broadly referred to as carbohydrates. Almost any 
organic-based materials can be utilized in biomass energy schemes. These 
include wood products from trees, crop residues (material left over after agri-
cultural production for food sources), animal wastes (poop), aquatic plants 
like seaweed, landfill gas (from rotting garbage), and municipal and industrial 
wastes (like sewage).
Note: In the next chapter I describe wood burning. While wood is biomass, 
under the strict definition of the word, it merits its own chapter because it’s 
so widespread and easily accessible.
Biomass uses
The uses of biomass vary. On a small scale, residential homes burn biomass 
like wood pellets and corn in specially designed stoves. On a large scale 
electrical power plants burn methane gas produced by compost piles of bio-
mass materials. Methane can be produced on large scales, and fed into the 
pipelines that feed urban areas with natural gas supplies. Ethanol is a biofuel 
derived from corn, and it’s increasingly being used in transportation around 
the world. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how common biomass 
energy sources are used:
 
✓ Wood and grasses are directly combusted to provide heat for boilers 
which can drive turbines and produce electricity. Steam locomotives 
originally burned wood before that fuel source was supplanted by coal. 
The most widely used source of wood biomass for combustion pur-
poses is the waste from the timber and forestry industry, in paper mills 
and lumber processing plants. The waste is formed into pellets that 
are burned in residences and businesses for heat. Willow trees, switch 
grass, and elephant grass are also grown specifically as biomass fuels 
for this purpose.

223
 Chapter 13: Exploring Biomass
 
✓ Corn, poop, and wood pellets are burned in residential stoves to provide 
heat. Other sources of biomass may be used as well. Some stoves can 
burn pretty much anything that’s thrown into them, although efficien-
cies vary quite a bit. And some fuels create quite a stink in the process 
(poop, for instance, stinks on both ends of the process).
 
✓ Crops and crop residues (particularly corn) are used to produce etha-
nol, a liquid which is commonly added to gasoline. Other grains such as 
wheat, rye, and rice are used to produce biofuels. Soybeans, peanuts, 
and sunflowers are used to make biodiesel fuel. Biofuels can be used for 
electric power generation as well as transport.
 
✓ Microalgae, found in lakes, is fermented into ethanol or composted to 
produce methane gas.
 
✓ Animal waste from farms and ranches, as well as human waste, is com-
posted to produce biogases (double yuck, but it works and makes a lot 
of sense, along with a lot of stink).
 
✓ Landfills are harvested for paper, cardboard, and other useful organic 
products which can be burned to create electricity.
 
✓ Old tires can be burned to produce both heat and electrical power.
Some biomass materials are more efficient than others in creating useable 
energy. Energy density is important — wood and corn are energy intensive: 
They hold a lot of potential energy in a unit’s worth of weight. But even bio-
mass products that aren’t energy intensive can be useful: After all, they’re 
already here but aren’t being utilized in any way. Poop, for instance, is a bio-
mass product in great abundance in livestock production, but for the most 
part it’s not being used for anything other than fertilizer. The vast majority of 
poop is left to rot where it is “deposited” (how’s that for a euphemism?).
Converting waste to energy
Converting waste into useable energy is one of the most promising areas for 
biomass because the environmental impact is so small. Waste for energy con-
version includes all carbon-based products generated through normal human 
activities (garbage, for instance, contains a lot of potential energy). U.S. 
agriculture and industry produce over 280 tons of carbohydrate wastes each 
year. Imagine if all of this waste could be efficiently converted into energy.
There is a downside, of course. Most waste products are difficult to combust 
without some processing and can result in a range of pollutants that may 
be even worse than those emitted during the fossil fuel combustion cycle. 
Agricultural waste, on the other hand, holds a tremendous potential for 
producing large amounts of energy without damaging the environment in 

224
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
the process. Corn, sugar cane, and rice offer the most promise. The byprod-
ucts (husks, shavings, and so on) of producing these foods are relatively 
straightforward to harvest with little extra investment in time and money. 
Traditionally, farmers have had to pay to get these waste byproducts hauled 
off to a landfill, but with advances in biomass machinery farmers can now 
charge for these materials. This has considerable economic benefits for 
entire communities.
Growing energy: Fuel crops
In addition to using the waste of agricultural crops, it’s also possible to grow 
crops specifically for energy. The type of crop determines the type of use:
 
✓ Starchy plants, such as corn and wheat, are good for liquid petroleum 
supplants such as ethanol and biodiesel fuels. (These crops are also good 
for human consumption because they have relatively simple organic 
structures that are easy for the human digestive system to break down.)
 
✓ Cellulose-based plants (such as trees and grass) are best for heat and 
electrical production via direct combustion.
Historically, energy crops have been largely ignored in relation to food crops, 
but interest is increasing as the economics of energy grow more expensive 
and complex. 
When crops are grown solely for energy production, species that offer the 
best efficiencies and least pollution potentials are selected. Energy crops 
can provide up to six times more energy potential than the energy required 
to produce them. With energy crops, the ratio of useable-output-energy to 
wasted-energy-to-produce-the-useable-energy is very large compared to 
many other energy producing sources. 
Some types of trees, such as poplars, maples, sycamores, and willows, reflex-
ively grow back when they’re harvested, so the process is naturally sustain-
able, with minimal labor and expense. It takes a relatively short time — around 
three to seven years — for these trees to grow big enough to be reharvested. In 
the future, there will be huge farms dedicated to growing and harvesting these 
types of trees, and converting the raw materials into useable forms.
Energy crops are also environmentally friendly. Many of the plants used to 
produce methane gas are advantageous to the environment. Switch grass, for 
instance, reduces erosion and provides a natural habitat for wildlife. They 
grow deep roots and actually add nutrients to the soil. Current research funds 
are being directed toward developing energy biomass plants that blend in with 
the natural ecosystem, and therefore disrupt the environment minimally.

225
 Chapter 13: Exploring Biomass
The benefits of biomass
Biomass is renewable and sustainable, if grown under the right conditions. 
There are a number of advantages with biomass.
 
✓ Global warming is caused by the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmo-
sphere. Biomass combustion, while it does release carbon dioxide, does 
not add to the buildup. When fossil fuels are combusted, carbon that 
has been locked up inside the earth for millions of years is released into 
the environment. When biomass is combusted, the CO2 emitted is taken 
up by the plants or trees that grow the next crop of biomass fuel, effec-
tively creating a closed loop cycle for the carbon. 
 
✓ Biomass supports local agriculture and forestry industries, thus reducing 
our need for foreign oil. 
 
✓ Biomass supports the development of new domestic industries (jobs) 
such as biorefineries that produce fuels, chemicals, and other bio-based 
products.
 
✓ It’s versatile: Biomass production can be either local, in one’s back-
yard, or it can occur on a large scale. Big farms produce corn for use in 
ethanol, and the refining and processing and distribution industries are 
tremendous. On the other hand, anyone can grow some biomass in their 
backyard and use it for various purposes such as heating and compost-
ing, or even eating.
 
✓ Biomass left to rot on the ground releases just as much carbon dioxide 
into the atmosphere during the decay phase as biomass that is com-
busted, so it’s effectively carbon neutral.
Of course, all is not rosy: Critics contend that there will be major environmen-
tal ramifications when huge areas of land are dedicated to growing specific, 
sometimes non-native, varieties of plants on a large, constantly evolving scale. 
This is hardly letting nature take its own course. There are instances where 
certain species of plants have become so invasive to a new environment that 
they completely take over the region’s ecosystem, rarely for the better.
Compost piles: Biomass at work
A compost pile is an example of biomass at 
work. You throw garbage and any old organ-
ics you have lying around into a special hopper, 
and the decomposition process creates heat by 
breaking down the materials in an anaerobic
process. You can use the final product any 
number of ways, including fertilizing your land-
scaping and burning in a stove. For that matter, 
burning autumn leaves is a biomass combustion 
process.

226
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Looking at the future of biomass
Currently, biomass is used to heat homes and buildings, as well as to gener-
ate electricity. Biomass can also be used to make liquid biofuels for transpor-
tation and a range of other useful chemicals and bioplastics, as later sections 
in this chapter explain. 
Developing biomass industries should be a national priority, and movements 
in that direction are starting to materialize. In the state of Maine, for example, 
the Fractionation Development Center is promoting a “forest biorefinery.” 
A study concluded that within four years, Maine could produce half of the 
transport and heating energy needs that the state currently consumes. Plans 
call for some 60 biorefineries, employing 7,000 people. The energy dollars 
stay completely local, and the jobs would help a weak economy reliant on 
foreign oil.
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
also have plans to develop biomass production. Plans envision a 30 percent 
offset of current fossil fuel energy sources with biofuels by 2030. In this 
scheme, biomass energy will replace 5 percent of the nation’s electrical pro-
duction, 20 percent of transportation fuels, and 25 percent of all chemical 
production. This will require over a billion tons of dry biomass feedstock 
annually, which is a fivefold increase over current levels.
The U.S. currently has the resources in forest lands and agricultural lands 
to support this kind of growth in the biomass industry. And the program 
prescribes sustainable growth methods that will constantly replenish the 
raw sources of biomass without disrupting the production of food supplies. 
Roughly 75 percent of the raw biomass needed to support this plan would 
come from croplands, and 25 percent from forests.
Despite these developments, biomass will never be able to completely sup-
plant the use of fossil fuels. A 2003 study concluded that it would take 22 per-
cent of all the plant matter that grows on the surface of the earth to sustain 
the world’s current energy consumption through biomass energy producing 
systems. This is roughly twice the world’s current agricultural production 
level. Nevertheless, biomass can make an appreciable dent, since the benefits 
are so widely spread across the economy. 
The Industrial Revolution was characterized by a consistent movement 
away from biomass carbohydrates toward fossil fuel (hydrocarbon) energy 
sources. The current trend toward biomass represents an unprecedented 
reversal of this process. Perhaps it’s not true, as the statistics in Chapter 3 so 
compellingly suggest, that humankind is inalterably destined to use more and 
more fossil fuels.

227
 Chapter 13: Exploring Biomass
Large-scale Biomass Power
Plant and animal wastes can be processed to produce methane, which is a 
key component of natural gas (the fossil fuel variety). While methane releases 
harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, when it’s produced using 
biomass, the carbon is reabsorbed by trees and plants as they grow, so that 
the net release of greenhouse gases is zero with biomass methane.
The process of turning biomass into power
The methane produced through biomass can be used in any number of appli-
cations in the exact same way that conventional, fossil fuel methane is used. 
Figure 13-1 shows the methane production cycle from biomass products.
To produce energy with biomass, a huge compost pile is left to rot. The copi-
ous amount of methane gas that is produced from the rotting material is 
channeled into the combustion chamber in a combined cycle methane power 
plant. The compressor pressurizes incoming air flow, which combines with 
the methane to produce a controlled combustion that powers the turbine. 
The turbine is connected to an electrical generator. The heat from the com-
bustion is further directed into a boiler where steam is produced. The steam 
pressure turns another turbine/generator combination and another source 
of electricity is produced. The two electrical sources are combined into one, 
and this is fed into the power grid. 
Generating electricity this way is very efficient and environmentally sound 
since the net release of greenhouse gases is zero. The economics are favor-
able, particularly in light of the fact that the biomass products used in the 
compost are very low in cost, and locally produced. Biomass generators can 
be located near agricultural and livestock production farms, so transport of 
the raw compost materials is minimal.

Advantages and disadvantages 
of biomass power plants
In addition to the general advantages of biomass, biomass power plants offer 
these benefits over fossil fuel combustion plants: 
 
✓ The biomass used in the plant is very inexpensive, compared to other 
energy sources. 
 
✓ Biomass is low in sulfur, so there is very little SOx emission when it is 
burned properly. Modern power plants burn the fuel very efficiently, 
and this in turn controls sulfuric emissions.
 
✓ Biomass power plants can operate continuously, unlike solar and wind 
farms which rely on the vagaries of the weather.
 
✓ Methane can be produced on small sites, and then transported to a cen-
tral location. Even small farms can produce quantities of methane gas, 
and this is becoming more common throughout the country as farmers 
and livestock growers are learning that they can recoup some of the 
costs of their operations by producing and selling methane. They can 
also use the methane in their own operations, which often results in 
impressive economic gains. Small- and large-scale methane production 
diversifies the nation’s energy sources.
Of course, there are also a few problems associated with biomass combustion 
plants, the chief one being ensuring that waste products are disposed of prop-
erly, which can sometimes be very expensive. If processed properly, biomass 
waste products can be used as fertilizers and clean landfill materials.
The joy of cooking: Making your own methane
You can convert cow manure into a very 
energy-dense gas by building a special fer-
mentation processor. The malodorous raw 
material is pumped into a digester silo where 
it is heated to 95°F, at which point fermenta-
tion is activated. Anaerobic microorganisms 
break down the organic matter to produce a 
gas that’s two-thirds methane and one-third 
carbon dioxide. The odor is similar to rotten 
eggs. The gas inflates a large plastic storage 
bellows. Methane is drawn off into a combus-
tion-powered generator to produce electricity, 
which can be used to power nearly anything. 
All you need is a big pile of cow poop, but that’s 
not hard if you have a bunch of cows. In fact, 
it’s unavoidable.

229
 Chapter 13: Exploring Biomass
Another significant issue is ensuring that the biomass is combusted properly: 
If not, it can release even more harmful products into the environment than 
fossil fuel combustion does. A study concluded that a municipal incinerator 
in New Jersey released 17 tons of mercury, 5 tons of lead, 750 tons of hydro-
gen chloride, over 80 tons of sulfuric acid, 17 tons of fluorides, 580 pounds of 
cadmium, and over 200 different types of lethal dioxins into the air each year. 
The remaining ash is also toxic and has caused landfill problems. Burning 
waste needs to be done very carefully in order to extract real benefits. 
Another problem, particularly for those who live near or work in these plants 
is the foul smell. Workers must have an inordinate tolerance of “rotten egg” 
smells, or worse.
Biomass Fuels
Liquid fuels are produced from biomass like corn and wheat. Ethanol is the 
most common form of fuel, followed by biodiesel. I describe these two fuel 
types in this section. There are other possibilities, but their usage is so rare 
that I won’t get into the details.
Ethanol
Ethanol is basically liquid oil produced from biomass products. It’s chiefly 
used as an additive to liquid fossil fuel products like gasoline, although there 
are internal combustion engines that can burn pure ethanol. Ethanol mixed 
with gasoline is called gasohol (an ugly word, but there it is). Conventional 
autos and trucks can use up to a 25 percent mixture of ethanol without loss 
of performance.
Ethanol has historically been more expensive than gasoline, and so its use 
has been limited. But with gas prices rising, while ethanol production costs 
fall, the economics are becoming more favorable. Government subsidies 
of the ethanol industry have also improved the economics and it’s now 
common for most of the fuel that consumers pump into their autos to contain 
some ethanol. Around 30 percent of the gasoline sold in 2007 in the U.S. con-
tained ethanol. Ten percent is a typical mix proportion.
Brazil is the global leader in ethanol production, at around 50 percent of 
the world total. Sixty percent of their vehicles are powered by a 22 percent 
mixture of ethanol/gasoline, and the remainder of their vehicles use pure 
ethanol, which is widely available. The U.S. produces a quarter of the world’s 

230
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
ethanol, and this percentage is rising due to government subsidies of the 
industry. In Europe, government mandates require that all vehicles use a 6 
percent mixture by 2010, which represents a ten-fold increase in demand. 
This will further exacerbate the world’s food shortage.
According to government studies, ethanol could provide 10 percent of the 
nation’s transport fuel needs by 2010, and up to 50 percent by the year 2050. 
These are big numbers, and the impact on both pollution and reliance on for-
eign oil will be impressive if the goals are met.
Ethanol’s benefits
Only 35 percent more energy is available from ethanol as was required to pro-
duce it, so the conversion efficiency is not impressive. And ethanol is much 
less energy dense than gasoline, so it takes more weight and volume of ethanol 
to achieve the same mileage. But while ethanol is less energy dense than gaso-
line, when it’s added to gasoline it improves engine performance in two ways: 
 
✓ Ethanol contains a lot of oxygen (in comparison to gasoline) and this 
improves the combustion in an engine. It also increases efficiency and 
reduces emissions in the process. 
 
✓ Ethanol octane levels are higher than those of gasoline, so engines per-
form with less knocking. This makes refueling less expensive because 
with gasohol there is no need to buy the higher grade fuels (high octane 
fuels, normally called premium).
Beyond improved engine performance, ethanol offers other significant politi-
cal and environmental benefits that make the drawbacks well worth the 
price. It’s renewable, sustainable, and environmentally neutral. It relieves the 
burden of foreign oil and is produced locally so that jobs and money stay in 
a community. Expansion of the ethanol industry has resulted in many new 
American jobs.
Ethanol’s problems
Most ethanol is produced from corn kernels because corn is in such abun-
dance. In 2006, 12 percent of all corn production in the U.S. went toward 
making ethanol. This has resulted in an increase in food prices the world 
over, and there is a lot of political debate about whether this effect should 
completely stop corn/ethanol production. Developing countries are the hard-
est hit when food prices rise, so it may be said that the net effect of ethanol 
production is starvation in developing nations.
Another downside is that corn production requires a lot of energy, water, 
and labor, plus modern machine intensive farming practices degrade the 
environment in many ways. Environmentalists don’t generally support the 
production of corn based ethanol, instead preferring other biomass bases 
like sugarcane and switch grass.

231
 Chapter 13: Exploring Biomass
Finally, in the U.S., ethanol is produced in only a few states located in the 
Midwestern corn belt. But the population centers are on the coasts, and so 
transportation issues are burdensome. Fossil fuel refineries are generally 
located nearer to the urban centers so as to minimize transportation costs, 
but there’s no way that can be accomplished with ethanol.
Biodiesel
Biodiesel is an organic liquid that may be used as a substitute for fossil fuel 
based diesel fuel. It’s typically made of soybeans, which are a huge crop in 
the U.S. Seeds from many different types of plants are ground down and pro-
cessed to make biodiesel. Vegetable oils like used kitchen grease may also be 
burned directly in diesel engines, with only minor processing and refinement.
Biodiesel is currently twice as expensive as fossil fuel, so its use is not as 
widespread as that of ethanol. But if the cap and trade policies of reducing 
carbon emissions are implemented, biodiesel will become cost competitive.
Making ethanol
Just in case you’re curious, there are three 
basic ways to make ethanol:
 ✓ Pyrolisis is a thermochemical process that 
condenses carbon compounds through 
high temperature heating. This is the oldest 
and most widely used technology but it’s 
also the most energy intensive, so the effi-
ciency of producing ethanol in this way is 
poor. Furthermore, the process needs to be 
controlled very carefully, which requires 
a lot of oversight and expensive capital 
equipment. Other products of pyrolisis are 
oil, acids, water, and various gases, all of 
which may be used for other applications.
 ✓ Fermentation is a biochemical process that 
uses microorganisms like yeast to effect an 
anaerobic conversion of sugars into alco-
hol, and is very similar to the process used 
to make beer (too bad you can’t use beer 
in your gas tank because it’s cheaper than 
gas nowadays, plus it has a very nice dual 
purpose). In this process, sugar cane works 
better than corn, but sugar cane supplies 
are nowhere near as robust as those of corn 
so this is relatively rare. Fermentation plants 
are inexpensive to build, but the overall 
conversion efficiency is not very good. The 
amount of energy required to produce etha-
nol through fermentation is not much more 
than the energy that can be extracted.
 ✓ Synthesis converts biomass into a gas, 
using a liquefier arrangement. This gas is 
mostly used in power plants in the same 
way that methane is used. This method 
holds the most long term promise, and 
research and development funds are being 
directed toward developing better pro-
cesses and machinery.

232
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Biodiesel may be mixed with conventional diesel fuel in any proportion with-
out adverse engine performance. Biofuels are less explosive than diesel, so 
they are also safer.
Small-scale Biomass for the Masses
As mentioned previously, not all biomass energy production is large-scale. 
In fact, traditionally, biomass has been used on a small scale by individual 
homeowners. 
You can install a biomass stove in your home, and take advantage of local 
energy sources while helping to preserve the environment. Stove technolo-
gies have improved dramatically over the last decade. Here’s what you need 
to know about burning biomass:
 
✓ Biomass can be a very clean-burning fuel or a very dirty-burning fuel. 
Knowing what you’re doing is the key to success. Do it right, and you 
can burn biomass more cleanly than you can burn fossil fuels. Do it 
wrong, and burning biomass can create a lot more pollution and ash 
than most other options. Burned right, biomass is very efficient in terms 
of producing heat from the potential energy in the fuel.
 
✓ Many biomass products are commonly transported long distances 
because the packaging makes transport and storage easy. Wood pellets, 
for example, come in compact bags that can be stacked on pallets and 
moved easily. Also, because the energy density is high with wood pel-
lets, you get more bang for the buck.
Getting the lowdown on biomass stoves
Biomass stoves and furnaces are designed to burn biomass fuels. In appear-
ance, biomass stoves are similar to wood stoves, and they transfer heat the 
same way. But biomass stoves are set up to burn at different temperatures and 
may require more or less oxygen in order to achieve the highest efficiencies. 
Biomass stoves are generally more efficient than wood-burning stoves 
because biomass combustion processes are well-controlled. These stoves 
have automatic augers that feed the fuel into the burn chamber at a con-
trolled rate. You simply load a hopper, and the fuel feeds down into the fire 
only as needed. You can control the feed rate by means of a thermostatically 
controlled switch, and you can mount the thermostat either by the stove or 
in a remote location.

233
 Chapter 13: Exploring Biomass
You can heat your entire home with a biomass furnace installed in your 
basement. Or you can heat a single room. You can buy a very cheap biomass-
burning stove and get inefficient performance, or you can spend more and 
get excellent convenience and efficiency. How you plan to use your stove 
determines the size and operation of your equipment. Well before you buy 
any stove, ask at the stove shop what your options are and then go home 
and consider the details, as well as how you’ll implement them once you get 
going.
Choosing a fuel
The decision on which type of biomass to use is generally dependent upon 
which types of biomass are available in your area. The Midwest favorite 
seems to be corn stoves. In the Northwest, you find a lot of pellet stoves (pel-
lets are made of byproducts of lumber processing, like bark, sawdust, twigs, 
and so forth). 
Burning pellets
The main operational advantage of pellet stoves is that they’re very easy to 
use. You fill the hopper with manufactured pellets and the rest of the process 
is largely automatic. A thermostat keeps the temperature at a preset point, 
and an auger feeds material into the combustion chamber so that you don’t 
have to worry about it. You can fill the hopper once a day or even less often 
if it’s not too cold out, and your home will stay at the set temperature. Pellet 
stoves can usually burn different types of materials as well, such as corn, coir 
fiber (from coconut husks), and nutshells. With very little work, you can get 
an even, consistent heat source.
Many types of pellets are made from byproducts of other lumber processing 
ventures, like sawdust and ground wood chips. Some pellets are even made 
from corn stalks (usually wasted since they have no nutritive value) and nut 
hulls, or from other crops like switch grass. Pellets are like recycled prod-
ucts, and even better for the environment because of it.
Two key advantages of burning pellets for heat are
 
✓ Pellets are renewable and produce the lowest emissions of any solid 
fuel. Wood pellets are neutral in terms of their effect on global warm-
ing because wood left to rot on the forest floor creates as much carbon 
dioxide as wood burned in a stove. And pellet combustion in a biomass 
stove is controlled much more accurately than wood combustion in a 
wood stove, so the combustion is more thorough and the efficiencies 
are much better. In addition, most of the industrial companies that man-
ufacture pellets replenish the trees they cut down to make pellets.

234
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
✓ If burned properly, pellets can be very clean and efficient. Smoke is 
minimal, and the burn is clean enough with pellet stoves that you often 
don’t need to vent the exhaust all the way up the chimney, so installa-
tion is easier and cheaper. There is also less creosote, which is safer for 
the home and cleaner for the environment.
Burning corn
Corn is the second most popular biomass fuel because it’s so readily avail-
able in many parts of the country. To be effective in combustion, corn must 
be very dry (unlike the stuff you eat). Corn can also be very cheap and clean, 
if you have a ready supply of quality product.
Other grains also work in essentially the same fashion as corn. Wheat, barley, 
rye, sorghum, and soybeans can be dried and burned at low cost and with 
low environmental impact. As with corn, this is really a question of access. 
People in cities don’t burn soybeans simply because they can’t store soy-
beans and don’t have a ready supply.
Like other types of fuel burned in biomass stoves, corn can be a very consis-
tent heating source because the stoves use automatic feeds and large hop-
pers. It’s also very clean burning and low on the pollution scale. Burning corn 
and other grains offers other advantages. First it’s the cheapest renewable 
fuel (at least for the time being). However, with the price of ethanol (which is 
made of corn) increasing, the cost of raw corn also increases. And, because 
corn grows fast and furious, it’s perhaps the best renewable energy source 
on the planet. 
Burning corn creates some unique problems that non-corn burning home-
owners don’t face.
 
✓ You have to buy a stove entirely dedicated to burning corn. In some 
regions, these stoves are very rare, and servicing can be hard to find.
 
✓ Storing corn takes up more room than storing wood pellets because 
the energy content of corn isn’t quite as good as that of wood pellets. 
In other words, you have to burn more corn to get the same amount of 
heat that you’d get from pellets.
 
✓ Corn has a limited lifetime, unlike other fuels. It may rot, or rats may eat 
it before you can burn it — a problem you have to address proactively 
or risk being overrun.
 
✓ Your home will have a sweet smell, not unlike popcorn. Depending on 
your tastes, this may or may not be a good thing, although people with 
corn stoves get used to the smell and seem to like it.

F
irewood is the most plentiful source of biomass energy on the planet, 
and the most widely used because of it. This is not going to change. 
While burning wood the wrong way harms the environment and wastes 
money, burning wood the right way makes sense, and it can be very economi-
cal, especially if you have a ready supply of firewood on your property.
The one truly outstanding feature about wood fires is this: Wood left to rot 
on the forest floor creates as much carbon dioxide in the air as wood burned 
in a fire. And the carbon dioxide released from wood burning is a closed loop 
in that new plant growth uses that carbon dioxide to form new wood. With 
fossil fuels, the carbon comes from the ground, and has been sequestered 
there for millions of years. From a pollution standpoint, wood burning is 
environmentally neutral (although to be precise, wood burning does entail 
a lot of soot and other harmful gases). If global warming is of critical impor-
tance, wood burning does have its place in the grand scheme. And since it’s 
so widely utilized, it fits into the alternative energy scenario on a scale that’s 
readily accessible to most anybody.
There are no large-scale wood burning power generating plants; burning 
wood as an alternative to fossil fuels is a personal, mostly residential thing. 
For that reason, I get very practical in this chapter. I describe the big picture, 
but I also provide a lot of down-to-earth tips on how to burn wood the best 
way, to get the most energy possible and to harm the environment as little as 
possible.

What the Blazes! Cleaner and More 
Efficient Ways to Burn Wood
Humankind has been burning wood since time immemorial. In fact, it might 
be said that civilization began when people learned how to burn wood wher-
ever and whenever they wanted. Fireplaces have been a traditional source 
of heat for thousands of years, and nothing is quite as cozy and inviting as a 
good open fire.
For a long time, wood-burning appliances (by that I mean stoves and fire-
places) comprised the vast majority of “hearth appliances” in a typical 
household. But that’s changed dramatically as gas-fired stoves have grown in 
popularity. In 2000, over two thirds of all hearth appliances were gas stoves, 
and 2 percent were pellet (biomass). That still leaves a lot of woodstoves, 
and in some areas of the country, particularly rural where wood supplies are 
plentiful, wood burning still represents the vast majority of heating energy 
sources.
Increasing demand, improving economics
As with all other alternative energy sources, the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973 
increased demand for woodstoves. A much larger surge in demand accom-
panied the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. Technologies improved, and 
wood burning efficiencies increased by a factor of two, so the economics 
improved as well. Since the amount of pollution produced by a wood burning 
appliance is directly related to how much that appliance is burning, air pollu-
tion also decreased.
Improving efficiencies
In the early 1980s a great deal of research was done to monitor the levels of 
pollution from wood burning activities of all kinds. The industry developed 
catalytic converters and better combustion chambers as a result. Pollution 
levels have declined considerably, and with a modern wood stove the 
amount of pollution released into the atmosphere is not much more than a 
good natural gas fired stove.

237
 Chapter 14: Burning Wood
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned all sales of high emis-
sion wood stoves beginning in 1992, but there are still a huge number of old 
stoves cranking away. They never die because they’re made of heavy steel 
and are basically very simple, with no moving parts that tend to break.
Over time, customer demand for catalytic converter stoves decreased because 
of technical issues related to cleaning the catalytic converters on a periodic 
basis. As a result, most new stoves do not have catalytic converters, but 
instead use clean-burning techniques perfected in New Zealand. The clean-
burning non-catalytic stove is the most widely sold in the world, presently.
Open Fireplaces: Cozy and Costly
Picture a fire crackling in an open hearth. Add the overstuffed chair, the 
steaming mug of cider (or goblet of wine). Throw in the golden retriever 
sleeping in the soft glow of yellow firelight, if you like. Makes you feel all 
warm and snuggly, doesn’t it? Well, here’s a blast of cold reality: Open fire-
places are about the least efficient and effective heating scheme you can 
imagine. Why? Because they draw cold air into a home to feed themselves 
and, due to the chimney effect (hot air rises aggressively), most of the hot air 
they generate goes right up the chimney.
Here’s the typical process.
 
1. You start the fire. This entails kindling, matches, and some “blowing” to 
get things going. And maybe some swearing when things don’t get going 
the way you had in mind.
 
2. You open the damper. If a cooking vent or bathroom vent is on in your 
home, or if the HVAC system is on, cold air may rush down the chimney, 
creating a back draft and causing smoke to seep out into your living 
space.
 
3. The chimney effect kicks in, and then smoke begins to rise up the 
chimney, and the fire grows hotter and brighter. Flickering orange 
flames, the norm, mean the wood isn’t burning very efficiently. In fact, 
flames of any kind are inefficient because the wood is not burning very 
thoroughly. 
 
4. Because it needs fresh oxygen, the fire in your fireplace pulls up to 
500 cubic feet per minute through windows and air leaks in your 
home. If somebody opens a door to the outside, cold air will rush in 
because the pressure in your home is less than it is outdoors.

The end result is that your home may actually be getting colder, not hotter. 
There’s no denying the romantic element. But at what price?
 
If you just can’t live without the romantic open flames or you’re stuck with 
what you’ve got, you can achieve better efficiency with these tips:
 
✓ When lighting your fireplace, open a door or window nearby so that the 
rush of air a fire takes before it settles down to a more static state will 
only move through a small portion of your home. Once the fire settles 
down, close the door or window.
 
✓ Burn hot, blazing fires because the combustion is more thorough. Don’t 
burn little fires.
 
✓ Use andirons to lift the logs above the floor so that during the burn cycle 
the hot cinders fall down onto a bed of coals and burn better and more 
thoroughly.
 
✓ When you’re not burning a fire, keep the damper closed. When the 
damper is open and a vent fan or the HVAC system in your home is 
turned on, air is drawn down the chimney. Not only does this result in 
cold air, but it could also mean a big stink and unhealthy air.
Wood-burning Stoves: An Efficient 
Alternative to Fireplaces
Stoves enable you to burn your wood more efficiently. They’re designed such 
that the wood burns in a specially designed burn chamber, which enables 
you to achieve much more efficient combustion (by controlling the burn tem-
perature) plus a more efficient dispersion of the heat into your living space.
 
Before deciding what type of stove you want to install in your home, check 
with your county building department for requirements, specifications, and so 
forth. These may make a big difference in your decision on which type you can 
buy. Also, check with your insurance company: They probably have some dic-
tates you need to follow as well. 
Comparing open- and closed-vent systems
There are two important types of venting systems in stoves: closed vents and 
open vents. In an open-vent system, air is drawn from the room and used for 
combustion, and then the exhaust is vented up the chimney. In a closed-vent 
system, air is drawn from the outside and vented back to the outside. 

239
 Chapter 14: Burning Wood
So which is better? Efficiency and safety-wise, a closed-vent system is:
 
✓ An open-vent system is always less efficient than a closed-vent system. 
The air that an open-vent system draws from the room inevitably comes 
from the great outdoors through cracks and leaks in your home’s enve-
lope (thereby making the home colder). 
 
✓ Closed-vent systems are safer than open ones. Naturally, you want to 
seal your home to a high degree in order to make your heating efforts 
more efficient. However, in doing so, you may cause a carbon monoxide 
or carbon dioxide hazard with an open-vent system. Or you may cause 
oxygen depletion, because the fire is competing with the human inhabit-
ants for oxygen.
Free-standing stoves and inserts
Aside from open- and closed-vent systems (see the preceding section), stove 
types feature another distinction: They can be either free-standing or inserts. 
Free-standing stoves simply sit in a corner of your room, without walls or 
bricks surrounding them. An insert fits into an existing open fireplace slot (a 
very good way to go from poor efficiency to good efficiency while still using 
the expensive decorative elements of your existing fireplace).
Free-standing stoves are inherently more efficient than inserts because, all 
else being equal, more of the generated heat makes it into the living space. 
Depending on the space they are mounted into, some inserts are completely 
surrounded by brick and mortar and do a very poor job of getting heat into 
the living space. Most of it goes up the chimney. (Even at that, an insert is 
still much more efficient than an open fireplace.) On the other hand, free-
standing stoves take up more of your home’s square footage, may be an 
eyesore, and are more likely to cause burns. In the summer, they’re just plain 
superfluous sitting there looking black and bulky.
Types of wood stoves
In producing new clean-burning stoves, manufacturers have taken one of two 
routes: one that uses a catalytic combustor and one that causes more com-
plete combustion.
While older wood stoves had efficiency ratings of 40 to 50 percent, today’s 
certified stoves boast efficiencies of 70 to 80 percent. As the efficiency goes 
up, the pollution a stove creates generally goes down (for one thing, when 
efficiency is high you burn less fuel; for another, when you burn fuel much 
more completely, there are fewer pollution byproducts). 

240
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Stoves with catalytic converters
Some wood stoves incorporate a catalytic converter, which burns off smoke 
and fumes that would otherwise exhaust or drift up a chimney. The catalytic 
converter consists of a honeycomb-shaped substrate coated with a catalyst, 
usually a precious metal such as platinum or palladium. When the smoke 
passes through the honeycomb, the catalyst lowers the smoke’s burning tem-
perature, causing it to ignite. The result is a more efficient burn, less smoke 
up the chimney, and less pollution. Most stove manufacturers now offer cata-
lytic models in which the combustor is an integral part of the stove. It is also 
possible to retrofit some older stoves with converters.
 
Starting a fire in a catalytic stove is more involved than doing so with a con-
ventional stove. You have to open a bypass damper when you either start or 
reload a fire. The damper directs the combustion gases directly up the flue 
(bypassing the catalytic element) until the temperature is high enough (350°F 
to 600°F) to get the combustor kicked into gear. This process is referred to as 
lighting off. A catalyst temperature monitor is normally included to let you 
know when to move the damper.
Catalytic stoves require a lot more maintenance than their conventional 
counterparts. The catalytic convertor needs to be changed periodically. 
Otherwise, you could actually end up with a very inefficient fire. These types 
of stoves are more expensive, and probably not worth the cost unless you 
put a very high premium on pollution.
Modern, conventional stoves
While catalytic converters offer the best pollution performance, they have 
seen limited sales because of the problems inherent to cleaning and main-
taining the catalytic converters. New stoves feature more controlled burn 
chambers that produce far less emissions than their heavy steel counterparts 
that are so common in older homes.
The oxygen intake to the combustion process is regulated so that the wood 
burns at a higher temperature, which results in more heat output with less 
pollution byproducts. The higher temperatures also result in more heat per 
unit weight of raw wood fuel. The units are heavier, and have more insula-
tion around the combustion chambers. While the emissions are not quite as 
good as with a catalytic type stove, the performance is far better than with 
old stoves. The new style stoves are also capable of burning a wider variety 
of woods.

 Chapter 14: Burning Wood
Important Points about Burning 
Wood Efficiently
Wood-burning stoves are the most common stove simply because wood is 
available virtually everywhere. Because the supply of wood is self-replenishing, 
it has the further advantage of being renewable. Wood-burning certainly has 
the most tradition on its side, so more equipment is available, as well as a 
wider range of raw wood resources to choose from.
 
Wood-burning stoves are banned in some areas. In other areas, burning is 
banned on particularly dirty air days. In these areas, utilities generally offer 
rebates and subsidies to convert to cleaner systems. Check with your local air 
resources board. 
A wide variety of heating appliances are available at literally any price you 
can pay. You can find old stoves for next to nothing, and they work well 
enough although the performance may not be real good. Be sure to check the 
efficiency ratings of the stoves you’re considering, because they may vary 
quite a bit. With some stoves, most of the heat is lost up the chimney. Other 
types of stoves are very efficient at channeling the heat into a room.
Enhancing efficiency by 
burning the right wood
Some types of woods are better than others for burning. Two factors deter-
mine the suitability of a given wood: whether it burns well and generates 
heat, and what kind of mess it makes in the process.
 
If pollution is your concern, insist on burning either dead trees or doomed 
trees (those that have been removed for building developments or other simi-
lar reasons). Don’t use trees that have simply been cut down for burning. If 
you do, insist that a new tree be planted in its place.
Hardwoods versus softwoods
Hardwoods are almost always better than softwoods for burning because 
you get a lot more Btu per unit weight and volume, which means a lot less 
work on your part per Btu generated. Hardwoods also deposit less creosote 

242
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
in your chimney and vent system, making them safer and cleaner for the envi-
ronment. Some people are suckers for the fact that softwoods are so much 
cheaper than hardwoods, but in fact, hardwoods are more cost effective. 
Check out www.hearth.com/fuelcalc/woodvalues.html for a calcula-
tor on different types of firewood and the Btu you can expect from them.
Seasoned wood
Any wood you burn must be properly seasoned, or dried out (wet wood 
smokes a lot, won’t burn at a hot temperature, hisses and pops and may be 
dangerous, and puts a lot of crud into your vent system). To season wood, 
split logs as soon as possible into the size that will fit into your stove and 
stack them in a dry spot for 6 to 18 months. Pile the wood so that air can cir-
culate. Hardwoods take longer to dry than softwoods do. Humidity and tem-
perature also affect drying times.
 
Green wood is freshly cut from a live tree. It will smoke like crazy and stink 
and probably won’t burn very thoroughly. Plus, a lot of water will steam out of 
it, resulting in sparks when you open the door to the burn chamber. How can 
you tell whether wood is green? See whether it’s brittle — if so, it’s not green.
Although you shouldn’t burn green wood, you can buy green wood in late 
spring, when prices are very low because demand is down. It will dry over 
the hot summer months and you’ll save money. In fact, if you can, buy a 
whole gob of green firewood at the same time and you’ll get a great discount.
What you should never burn
 
Although burning hardwood is better than burning softwood, the latter isn’t 
out of the question. Some things, on the other hand, should never be burned 
in a wood stove:
 
✓ Garbage, plastic, foil, or any kind of chemically treated or painted 
wood: They all produce noxious fumes, which are dangerous and pollut-
ing. If you have a catalytic stove, the residue from burning plastics may 
clog the catalytic combustor.
 
✓ Trash (paper or plastic): Paper wastes tend to make a very hot fire for a 
short period of time, encouraging the ignition of any creosote deposits 
in your stovepipe. And synthetic wastes, such as plastic wrappers, pro-
duce acids when they burn. Acids make for a very short stove lifetime.
 
✓ Manufactured logs (like Duraflame): This is extremely dangerous. They 
burn too hot and can cause a fire when you open the door.

243
 Chapter 14: Burning Wood
Avoiding problems by burning 
the wood right
The potential for pollution is high if you don’t use your wood stove properly 
(you don’t maintain the proper burning temperatures, for example, or you 
don’t keep the stove cleaned out). Burning wood properly (to get the most 
efficiency) requires you to pay attention to the process and continually 
manipulate the wood stack as well as the damping levels. Follow this advice 
for safety, efficiency, and convenience:
 
✓ In the firebox, avoid placing pieces of wood in parallel directions, 
where they may stack too closely. Always try to get some air movement 
between pieces of wood. 
 
✓ Adjust the burning embers periodically with a poker to keep your fire 
burning properly. Unfortunately, there are no rigid guidelines; learning 
to use your stove optimally takes practice. Just play around with it. 
 
✓ If you’re looking for the most heat fast, vary the position of the wood to 
maximize the exposed surface area of each piece of wood. If you’re after 
a long term burn (overnight, unattended) minimize the space between 
the pieces.
 
✓ Only use wood properly sized for your stove’s fire chamber. Smaller 
pieces burn faster and hotter.
 
✓ Always keep the door closed when attending to the fire — when the 
door is open, too much oxygen enters the burn chamber. 
 
A good technique for producing a relatively clean, long burn (overnight) is to 
load your stove with a mixture of partially seasoned and well-dried wood 
about half an hour before bedtime. Leave the damper open to give the fire a 
good start; then damp the strongly burning blaze down for the night.
Maintaining a wood stove
Wood stoves require chimney maintenance. Burning wood creates creosote 
gunk on your vent or chimney liner, and this can catch on fire if you’re not 
diligent. Softwoods are much worse in this regard than hardwoods.
Maintaining a wood stove means having the chimney swept. This entails 
going up onto the roof (or wherever the vent terminates at the top) and forc-
ing special brushes down that clean away the built up creosote and tar.

244
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
A stove that is not damped excessively (and that has a well-designed chim-
ney of factory-built, insulated pipe) may not need a sweep for an entire 
season. On the other hand, even a comparatively well-installed system could 
need cleaning as often as every two weeks. Your stove’s instruction manual 
will provide explicit instructions on how to tell when cleaning is needed and 
the best way to go about it. After installing a new stove, be sure to check the 
stovepipe for creosoting every two weeks until you become accustomed to 
the heater’s behavior. (Any deposits over 1/4-inch thick indicate that the pipe 
needs attention.)
You can monitor the accumulation of creosote and other deposits in your 
stovepipe by tapping on the sections with a metal object. Once you’re used 
to the ringing sound that a clean pipe makes, the dull thud of a dirty one will 
be distinctive.
It’s a good idea to have your stove system inspected by a pro at the begin-
ning of each burn season.
 
To monitor the operation of your wood stove, check the exhaust coming out 
of the chimney. You should see the transparent white steam of evaporating 
water only — darker, opaque smoke will be just slightly visible. The darker the 
color of the exhaust, the less efficiently your stove is operating.
The consistency of the burn
In gas stoves, combustion can be tuned to a 
high degree, and the stove will always work the 
same way because it’s a closed process that 
doesn’t require intervention (plus the fuel is 
very consistent). On the opposite extreme are 
wood stoves, which vary in performance for a 
number of reasons:
 ✓ The wood composition and quality varies 
quite a bit. Even if you buy the same spe-
cies, such as oak, and the wood is cut from 
trees in the same forest, the variations are 
tremendous.
 ✓ Wood is often piled high, and the stuff on 
the bottom gets muddy. This affects com-
bustion quite a bit, not to mention the mess 
it makes.
 ✓ Stoves vary. The same wood burned in dif-
ferent stoves will combust differently.
 ✓ Over the course of the burn cycle, raw wood 
turns to ashes. Ashes build up and change 
the dynamics of the combustion process.
 ✓ Weather can affect how a stove burns 
by changing the way the chimney draws. 
If your home is oriented just right (or just 
wrong), you may experience severe back 
drafts on windy days.
Once the heat is generated in the stove, the next 
issue to contend with is how the stove gets the 
heat into the room. 

245
 Chapter 14: Burning Wood
Getting the hot air where you want it
If all you want to heat is a single room, your options are simple because you 
don’t need to move air in a complicated fashion and you can buy a small 
stove. If you’re planning on heating a number of rooms or an entire home, 
you need to figure out how you’re going to move the warm air from the 
stove to the adjoining rooms. When it comes to moving air, you have several 
options:
 
✓ Ceiling fans: These are a cost-effective way to reduce fuel bills and even 
out temperature variations. If your home has high ceilings or an open 
loft, most of the heat will rise to those areas and eventually migrate out 
through the roof. A well-placed fan will move this hot air back down into 
your living spaces.
 
✓ Ecofans: Ecofans offer a very efficient and effective way to move the hot 
air your stove is generating. An Ecofan (check out www.realgoods.
com or enter “Ecofan” in your search engine) exploits the simple laws 
of thermodynamics to move a fan blade without the use of electricity or 
external power. You set the fan on top of your stove and after it gets hot, 
the blade spins and moves up to 150 cubic feet per minute (cfm) of air. 
Ecofans cost over $100, but over the long term they’re a lot cheaper than 
using ceiling fans, and they can make your wood stove up to 30 percent 
more effective (I said effective, not efficient) by distributing the hot air.
 
✓ Your HVAC fan system: Most HVAC furnaces (the kind that use forced 
air) have a switch setting that allows the blower to run without having 
the heat on (Fan Only is a common label). If you run your HVAC system 
in this mode, it will distribute the heat generated by your stove through-
out your entire home.
Stove Safety Guidelines
Stoves obviously pose a lot of dangers. With any type of stove, you can start 
a fire, create smoke hazards, or get burned badly. To avoid potential danger 
and the legal liabilities that may come with it, heed the advice in this section.
Ensure proper installation and venting
Wood-burning stoves can be very dangerous if they’re not installed properly. 
A properly designed chimney (or vent system) is a prerequisite for any safe 
stove installation. The flue must be made of a suitable heat-resistant mate-
rial and it must be separated from combustibles by a specified distance (see 
county codes and installation specifications for a particular stove).

246
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Rules regarding masonry chimneys used to vent a stove state that they must 
be lined — usually with clay flue tiles, which should be mortared at the joints 
with refractory cement and separated from the stone, brick, or block work. 
The interior surface shouldn’t show signs of chipping. Likewise, the exterior 
masonry and joints should be sound. 
 
Don’t install any type of stove yourself. A whole host of details go into the 
installation of a stove, and failure to pay attention to any one of them can lead 
to a safety problem. 
Use of a wood stove may increase your fire insurance premiums. You must 
tell your homeowners insurance agent that you have a stove (they’ll proba-
bly ask). In many cases, they’ll come to your home to inspect the installation. 
If things aren’t as they should be, your insurance company may refuse you or 
give you a set amount of time to get it up to code.
Bring an existing chimney up to date
The likelihood of an existing chimney meeting all of the criteria outlined 
in the preceding section isn’t very good (if you’re in doubt, have an expert 
come in and take a look). If the chimney is deficient because it’s too large, 
lacks a liner, or is in poor repair, you have these options:
 
✓ Bring it up to snuff (relining and so forth). If you choose this option, let 
a pro do the job.
 
✓ Abandon it. For about the same cost as relining, you can install a factory-
built, insulated metal chimney. This is a good idea because technology 
has improved quite a bit, and you’ll be getting better performance along 
with better safety.
 
✓ Install a new stovepipe in an existing chimney. This solution not only 
eliminates the problem of the deficient chimney, but it also gives you 
the option to look into a closed system (a stove, in other words).
 
 When using a fireplace chimney for stove exhaust, the entry to the fire-
place must be sealed, or, if the connector joins the flue above the fireplace, 
the chimney must be plugged below the point of junction. This precaution 
not only prevents burning embers from cascading down into your fire-
place (and onto your floor), but also maintains the proper draft.
Most county regulations prohibit the passage of stovepipe through any floor, 
ceiling, or fire wall without special feed-throughs. You may, however, pass 
your pipe through either a wall or a floor/ceiling if you use a factory-built 
insulated chimney. If you don’t have a suitable masonry chimney, this expen-
sive venting option is your only choice.

247
 Chapter 14: Burning Wood
Follow manufacturer’s instructions 
Make sure you know and follow the safety and operation guidelines outlined 
in your stove’s instruction manual. If you don’t have an instruction manual, 
get one online or contact the stove’s manufacturer.
 
✓ Contact your county building department to find out what the applicable 
codes and guidelines are in your area. If you don’t follow code and you 
cause a fire or other danger, you could have an insurance claim denied 
or even find yourself in legal limbo if there’s collateral damage.
 
✓ Call your homeowners insurance company and ask them what type of 
requirements they have for stoves. Many insurance companies will insist 
on coming out to your home so they can inspect your stove firsthand. 
(So many stoves have been installed inadequately that they can’t just 
take your word for it.) Sometimes the insurance company’s standards 
are stricter than the county’s, and you may find your insurance canceled 
or your rates increased if you don’t mind your p’s and q’s.
 
✓ Keep in mind that the fuel you burn in your stove is just as combustible 
while it’s in storage as it is when it’s in the combustion chamber. If you 
have a wood pile, it’ll burn very hot and fast if you’re not careful. Always 
consider fuel storage while you’re designing your stove system.
 
✓ Always make sure to have adequate smoke alarm coverage in your 
home, and make sure to keep the batteries fresh in every smoke alarm. 
You should also consider installing a carbon monoxide alarm. It’s always 
better to be safe than sorry.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technologies
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding hydrogen technology
▶ Using fuel cell to power cars and homes
▶ Confronting obstacles facing broader fuel cell use
H
ydrogen is the simplest and most abundant element in the universe. 
It is comprised of a single proton, and hydrogen gas is odorless, col-
orless, and imperceptible to the human senses. It’s the main component of 
water (H2O), and it’s also one of the basic atoms in both carbohydrates and 
hydrocarbons, the energy sources that all life on the planet earth require to 
survive. 
It is no stretch to say that hydrogen is the most important element in the 
universe because the energy from stars derives mostly from it. It’s also the 
most important element in terms of the world’s energy future, for it’s also 
no stretch to say that sometime in the future humankind’s main energy 
source will be hydrogen. This is going to take some time, but it’s a fact simply 
because it has to be. We must develop a hydrogen economy or perish. Fossil 
fuels are going to run out, and greenhouse gases from fossil fuel consumption 
are causing too much environmental harm. Hydrogen provides the answer to 
both dilemmas.
In this chapter I describe hydrogen fuel cells, the basic technology at the 
heart of the hydrogen promise, and explain why hydrogen is so important in 
the grand energy scheme. 
The Basics of Hydrogen Technology
In the last few decades, fuel cell technology has developed and the most 
widely used type of cell is the hydrogen fuel cell. Basically, a hydrogen fuel 
cell produces electrical power from hydrogen, which combines with oxygen 
in a specially manufactured device. Hydrogen and oxygen (the raw fuels) are 
fed into the device, and electrical power is output (along with heat and water 
and some other minor byproducts).

250
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Instead of combusting as hydrogen does in hydrocarbons (fossil fuels), 
the hydrogen oxidizes at a much lower temperature. In the most common 
scheme, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) is employed. A PEM fuel cell 
generates between 0.4 and 0.8 volts of electricity. In the same way as bat-
teries, individual cells are combined in order to create higher voltages, or 
higher power levels. Note: Don’t worry about how a PEM works: it’s very 
complicated, would take an entire book to explain, and isn’t necessary for 
this discussion.
 
Hydrogen is not really an energy source, per se; pure hydrogen offers no 
potential to extract useable energy. But it’s perfect as an energy carrier (stor-
age mechanism) because it’s ideal for converting energy from other sources, 
and converting that energy directly into electricity. Herein lies its magic. The 
combustion process associated with most other forms of energy extraction is 
bypassed. With hydrogen, pure electricity can be produced without need for 
boilers, turbines, internal combustion, and generators. The process is very 
simple, and simplicity implies efficiency.
Sources of hydrogen
Hydrogen is very reactive with a lot of other atoms, so it’s rare to find pure 
hydrogen in a natural state. In order to use it as a fuel, therefore, it must be 
separated from other chemical compounds, of which there are many widely 
available candidates, the main ones being 
 
✓ Water: Water is H2O, as everyone knows. When water is broken down 
to produce hydrogen, the only other product is oxygen, which is com-
pletely beneficial. Contrast this with the production of hydrogen from 
hydrocarbons, which releases a great deal of carbon in the process, and 
it’s easy to see why water is the best source of hydrogen.
 
✓ Hydrocarbons (fossil fuels): While it may seem contradictory to extract 
hydrogen from fossil fuels for use in producing electricity via fuel cells, 
the process is far more efficient than the current combustion processes 
of fossil fuels. So the net gain in terms of both pollution mitigation and 
energy efficiency is very promising. Still, environmentalists object to 
fuel cell development that uses hydrocarbon sources (such as propane) 
because it does not solve our energy problems nearly as effectively as 
renewable hydrogen sources such as biomass.
 
✓ Carbohydrates (food and biomass products): Biomass methane is an 
environmentally sound source for hydrogen, and the biomass indus-
try will likely grow in conjunction with fuel cell proliferation. (Refer to 
Chapter 13 to find out more about biomass.)

251
 Chapter 15: Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technologies
Nearly any material that reacts with oxygen may be used, but efficiencies and 
economics vary widely, and most substances that can produce hydrogen are 
impractical due to cost and complexity. 
 
Globally, a well established hydrogen industry currently extracts 50 million 
tons of hydrogen per year. In the U.S., the oil refinement industry uses around 
50 percent of this hydrogen in their processes, and fossil fuels are the main 
source of the hydrogen. Natural gas provides 48 percent of the hydrogen, oil 
provides around 30 percent, and coal another 18 percent. This is not an envi-
ronmentally friendly mix of sources.
Hydrogen is so prevalent that there are a wide range of sources from which to 
derive it. Yet pure hydrogen is a difficult fuel to obtain. While many scientists 
and engineers believe that hydrogen fuel cells are the key to the world’s energy 
future, there is still considerable debate about the nature of the sources from 
which the hydrogen is derived. Hydrogen from non-renewable sources carries 
the same burdens as our current use of these resources. When acquired from 
clean, renewable sources, however, hydrogen can offer a virtually limitless 
abundance of electrical energy with nearly negligible impact on the environ-
ment. The key to a hydrogen future will be to develop the right sources, and 
the means to separate the hydrogen from those sources.
Extracting hydrogen
As mentioned previously, hydrogen can be extracted from nearly any hydro-
carbon as well as carbohydrate. The following sections outline some of the 
most common methods of hydrogen extraction. Research and development 
is being funded for all of these, and at some point there will be technical 
breakthroughs that favor one of the methods over the others.
Steam reforming
The most widely used process, called steam reforming, converts natural gas 
into hydrogen. Steam reforming combines methane and other lightweight 
hydrocarbons with steam (water vapor at a specific temperature) causing the 
constituent chemicals to react. The products are hydrogen, carbon dioxide, 
carbon monoxide, water, and a number of other chemicals that cause pollu-
tion hazards. The hydrogen is separated and stored.
Coal based steam reforming
Coal may be converted into a gaseous form that combines coal, oxygen, 
and steam under tremendous pressures and temperatures. A gas of carbon 
monoxide and hydrogen forms, and the hydrogen is separated out into pure 
hydrogen raw fuel.

252
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
Plasma waste
A company called Startech has demonstrated a new technology that can 
produce hydrogen from trash. The process is called plasma waste remedia-
tion and recycling technology. Waste materials are fed into the device and 
reformed and recovered by molecular dissociation and a closed-loop elemen-
tal recycling process. Economical it’s not, but the technology is sound. With 
improvements, this may be the wave of the future. 
Here’s how the process works. In an ambient of ionized air, waste materials 
are jolted hard with energy to the point where it causes molecules to break 
apart into actual atoms. The byproduct is plasma converted gas (PCG) from 
which hydrogen can be easily extracted. Startech has converted a conven-
tional pickup truck that runs off the technology.
Electrolysis
Hydrogen can also be produced from water, either salt or fresh, through elec-
trolysis, and this is highly favored because there are no greenhouse gases 
as a consequence. Electrolysis divides water molecules into basic elements 
of hydrogen and oxygen (somewhat the opposite of how a fuel cell works). 
A virtually limitless supply of hydrogen is produced if renewable sources 
such as water are used as the basis. But electrolysis itself requires electricity, 
so this process is pricey compared to steam reforming. It is estimated that 
electricity costs need to be less than 3 cents per kWh for this process to be 
economically competitive.
Biomass gasification
Biomass gasification uses hot steam and oxygen to convert biomass into 
a gas, which is a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, 
water, and other byproducts. The hydrogen is separated and used as a fuel 
source.
Thermal dissociation
Thermal dissociation is still on the drawing boards, but it shows prom-
ise. Thermal dissociation requires extreme temperatures (3,600 degrees 
Fahrenheit or more) which are obtained by concentrating solar systems. 
The process separates hydrogen and oxygen in water thermally, and is 
very effective. Research is being done to find a way to lower the tempera-
tures required, and if successful this may be the major hydrogen producing 
method in the future.

How a fuel cell works
There are a wide variety of fuel cells, each using a similar process to produce 
electricity. A fuel cell uses an electrochemical reaction to convert hydrogen 
and oxygen into electricity, water, and heat. The process transforms fuel 
directly into electricity in a single step. This single step makes fuel cells 
very efficient in terms of converting potential energy into useable electrical 
energy. 
A fuel cell has two electrodes, or electrical connections: a cathode and an 
anode, with polarities. The two surfaces are separated by a membrane elec-
trolyte, a liquid solution with carefully controlled electrical conduction prop-
erties. Hydrogen gas is channeled into the anode side of the cell. A catalyst, 
typically platinum metal, oxidizes the hydrogen and this results in the sepa-
ration of the hydrogen proton and its single electron. The electron flows out 
of the cell via the electrodes and an electrical current is generated.
At the same time, the now positively charged hydrogen ion flows through the 
membrane to the cathode (due to electrical attraction). At the cathode, air is 
electrocatalytically transformed into negatively charged oxygen atoms. The 
force of electrical attraction now bonds the positively charged hydrogen ion 
with the negatively charged oxygen atom, creating water in the process. The 
final product is water, heat, electricity, and some nitrogen oxide in very small 
amounts. The water may be simply discarded, the heat channeled away and 
used to warm external devices, if desired. It’s the electricity generation that’s 
of prime interest.
Whew. That was hypertechnical, but don’t worry, you don’t need to under-
stand that a fuel cell operates just like a battery. It outputs DC (direct cur-
rent) power to a load. The load may convert this into AC electrical power 
suitable for residential and commercial use.
 
The low temperature operation of the fuel cell is a function of the technical 
precision and complexity of the catalysis reaction on the fuel cell catalyst 
(membrane). While traditional thermal engines rely on temperature differen-
tials to achieve the efficient production of useable energy, fuel cells operate 
differently. With the proper catalysts, the hydrogen and oxygen is “burned” 
atom by atom right on the surface of the catalyst itself to produce not heat but 
a physical entity even “hotter” — a flow of electrons. Fuel cells do not violate 
the thermodynamic laws (refer to Chapter 2), they just achieve them in subtly 
different ways than thermal combustion processes, which are far more intui-
tive to the layman.

Practical and Pie-in-the-Sky 
Applications
Given the fact that fuel cells create electricity directly, there are very few 
energy applications where fuel cells are not great candidates to displace 
current technologies. Hydrogen, unlike electricity, is simple to store. And 
oxygen can be obtained from the air, so there is no problem with that supply. 
Hydrogen can be compressed down into gas tanks, then combined with 
oxygen from the air and electricity may be generated at will. Wherever batter-
ies are used, hydrogen fuel cells may be used.
 
✓ Rural homes that are off-grid will likely be the first big market for 
fuel cells. 
 
✓ Portable devices that use batteries are also prime candidates for fuel 
cells. Devices such as smoke alarms, video cameras, and cell phones will 
likely be available with fuel cells by 2012.
Back story in brief
The Welsh physicist Sir William Robert Grove 
built the first prototype fuel cell in 1839, and 
demonstrated that hydrogen and oxygen, under 
the proper conditions, can be made to react to 
create an electrical flow (with only water and 
heat as a byproduct). This first practical appli-
cation of fuel cell technology was very costly 
compared to other forms of energy production, 
but it proved the viability of the fundamental 
concept.
In the late 19th century William Jaques built a 
fuel cell that used phosphoric acid as the pri-
mary fuel. This embodiment offered even better 
performance than Grove’s invention. Solid oxide 
fuel cells (SOFC) were developed by German 
researchers over the course of the 1920s. In 
1932, Francis Bacon, an English scientist, used 
alkaline and nickel to significantly improve fuel 
cell performance. This technology took hold, 
and was improved by subsequent researchers 
and a 5 kilowatt system was built in 1959 that 
demonstrated the practicality and economical 
potential of fuel cells.
Not until the American space program in the 
1960s were fuel cells used in working systems. 
Fuel cells are lighter weight than batteries, very 
compact in terms of output energy per size, and 
much safer than nuclear power reactors, so 
many spacecraft were outfitted with them. In 
1965, Project Gemini utilized fuel cells to provide 
heat, electricity, and potable water supplies on 
board a working spacecraft. All space shuttles 
are now outfitted with fuel cells. The econom-
ics are still prohibitive, but the advantages in 
space applications merit the high cost. But by 
developing fuel cell technologies, insights and 
new innovations have been made and the costs 
have been coming down.

 Chapter 15: Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technologies
 
✓ Electric cars will someday use fuel cells, and the only exhaust will be 
water and some minor gases (non-greenhouse). At this point, there 
are over 3,000 fuel cell units being used in institutions and businesses 
worldwide.
 
✓ All the big automakers are exploring fuel cells. Projections are for the 
first fuel cell passenger cars to appear on the road in 2010, at the earliest.
The following sections discuss two different and simple applications for fuel 
cells, to give you an idea of how useful they are, and one use that gives you a 
glimpse of a hydrogen-powered future.
Fuel cell-powered vehicles
A fuel cell-powered vehicle (FCV) is basically an electric car that uses fuel 
cells as the primary power source. In such a car, hydrogen and oxygen are 
fed into the fuel cell, which produces electricity which is directed into the 
battery bank (conventional batteries are used) and the power controller. The 
battery bank is used to allow for varying amounts of power to be directed 
to the electric motor (fuel cells are poor at decreasing and increasing their 
power outputs at a fast enough rate to directly power the wheels, although 
this is changing with new technological developments). 
The electric motor is connected to the drive wheels via a transmission (as it 
is in conventional vehicles). The power controller is connected to the accel-
erator pedal that the driver manipulates to control the vehicle speed. The 
battery also provides another benefit: If the fuel tank (hydrogen) goes dry, 
there will still be available power to get to the nearest refilling station. 
With current technologies, fuel cells can convert around 50 percent of the 
potential energy in the hydrogen into useable electrical energy to power the 
vehicle. The rest of the energy transforms into heat, which is dissipated by 
an onboard cooling system (just like conventional autos that use radiators to 
cool the engine). 
Following are the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges regarding 
broader use of FCVs:
 
✓ Efficiencies: FCVs help reduce dependence on foreign supplies of fossil 
fuels. Even if the hydrogen source is a fossil fuel, fuel cells offer far 
better efficiencies than conventional engines so demand for fossil fuels 
will be less when FCVs become commonly available. In addition, elec-
tric vehicles of all kinds are lighter weight than conventional vehicles 
because there is no need for heavy, mechanical drivetrains. This further 
enhances the efficiencies.

256
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
✓ Infrastructure: Before FCVs become common, there will have to be a lot 
of investment in infrastructure like special fueling stations and the trans-
port of raw fuel sources to and fro. Fortunately, existing natural gas and 
methane pipelines can be used to channel hydrogen gas, so some infra-
structure is already in existence, even though it will have to be modified.
 
✓ Environmental impact: The pollution generated by an FCV is a fraction 
of that exhausted by a conventional vehicle. When biomass is used as 
the source of hydrogen, the emissions are closed loop (I explain this 
phenomenon in Chapter 13).
 
✓ Cost: The current cost of hydrogen is currently very high, and availabil-
ity is virtually nil. When hydrogen production facilities come on line for 
transportation, economies of scale will result in lower prices and hydro-
gen fuel cells will become more widely used as a result. The growth 
process will feed on itself. Government incentives are very encouraging 
for this technology, so the costs are being kept low in order to spur 
demand. Government incentives are growing every year.
 
 The transport sector is going to drive the demand for fuel cells, and 
open up new residential and commercial building markets as prices 
decline.
 
✓ Transportation of fuel: Hydrogen can be produced locally and doesn’t 
need to be manufactured in large industrial plants far removed from 
filling stations. Hydrogen can be produced at a residential level which 
means that it will be possible to completely forego filling stations.
 
✓ Operating range: The effective operating range of an FCV with a full tank 
of fuel is less than that for a fossil fuel-powered vehicle. 
 
✓ Fuel tanks and car design: Onboard storage of fuel is problematic. 
Hydrogen tanks are difficult to build because the atoms are so small 
they permeate most metals. Fuel tanks will always be expensive and dif-
ficult to maintain. In addition, these tanks are larger and more complex 
than fossil fuel tanks and take up more space; since electrical vehicles 
are smaller and lighter weight, the interiors of FCVs are more cramped. 
 
✓ Maintenance challenges: There are very few FCVs on the road now, and 
maintenance will be difficult because most mechanics have no idea how 
an FCV power source works. It is going to take not just a considerable 
investment in infrastructure, but also a considerable investment in train-
ing and licensing of qualified service personnel.
Small-scale fuel cell electric power 
Electrical power may be produced on site, using fuel cells. Residences and 
businesses can produce their own electrical power. Small scale basically 
means that the power output is low and is only capable of driving a limited 

257
 Chapter 15: Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technologies
amount of load. Typical small-scale power plants can produce anywhere 
between 5 to 50 kilowatts of power. The advantage is that the power is pro-
duced independent of the grid, which makes for a more distributed form of 
energy production.
In a small-scale fixed location system, hydrogen can either be piped in via 
the existing natural gas pipeline system or stored on site in a tank. (In fact, if 
methane — natural gas — is used to provide the hydrogen, the fuel supply is 
already in existence in most urban areas.) Another alternative is to produce 
the hydrogen on site with a reformer or other type of hydrogen recovery 
system, explained in the earlier section “Extracting hydrogen.”
The hydrogen and oxygen are then combined to create electricity, which 
feeds into the power control circuit. When load conditions in the home are 
minor, most of this power is fed into the batteries where energy is stored for 
later use. When the load conditions in the home are heavy, most or all of the 
power being generated by the fuel cell goes directly into the home’s appli-
ances. If the hydrogen fuel tank runs out, there will be some energy capacity 
stored in the batteries. 
Fuel cells are very simple, in comparison to other energy generating schemes 
used in residences, and using them to generate electricity on a small scale 
offers several advantages: 
 
✓ The cells last a long time and are very reliable. For remote locations, 
they’re more efficient than conventional generators used as backups 
and primary sources of power.
 
✓ Hydrogen is non-toxic, unlike gaseous fossil fuel energy sources, and 
there is negligible pollution produced in the process. Even if conven-
tional fossil fuel sources such as methane and propane are used as fuels 
to the fuel cell, less pollution results than if those conventional sources 
were combusted on site to create electricity. In fuel cells, there is no 
combustion at all, and that’s the difference.
 
✓ Tax rebates and credits and subsidies are available for these systems, 
which lowers the net cost.
Despite the advantages, there’s one key disadvantage currently (beyond 
the fact that the technology is very rare and getting units serviced may be 
problematic, to put it mildly): It’s very hard to deliver and store hydrogen. 
The energy density of hydrogen is low compared to other fuels, so storage 
tanks need to be larger to contain the same amount of potential energy, and 
Hydrogen is extremely flammable and potentially explosive. On-site produc-
tion will be the key to the future proliferation of these technologies, but it 
still has a long way to go.

258

Hydrogen-powered home of the future
At some point in the future, hydrogen fuel cell problems will be solved, and 
the resulting growth of technologies will be tremendous in both the residen-
tial and transport sector. Figure 15-1 shows an artist’s conception (mine) of a 
hydrogen-powered home of the future.

Hydrogen
At the core of the energy process will be hydrogen-powered fuel cells. 
Hydrogen will be obtained through a range of sources, like biomass and 
natural gas, for example, with natural gas the most likely. Hydrogen can also 
be produced via electrolysis which is driven by solar panels, which will com-
pletely eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. As solar power comes down in 
cost over the next decade, it will become a more economical alternative to 
natural gas hydrogen production.
The heat from the fuel cell electrical generation will be used to heat the 
domestic water supply and the internal spaces of the home. This makes the 
process extremely efficient.
The home will still be connected to the grid, but with an adequate size of fuel 
cells and solar panels, there will be a net zero transfer of electrical power. 
The grid will ensure that if the fuel cell system goes down there will still be 
electrical power available. Another attractive feature of being connected to 

259
 Chapter 15: Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technologies
the grid is that fuel cells and solar panels can output lots of power during 
peak times. This will increase the efficiencies of the entire grid system (I 
explain this in more detail in Chapter 3).
Finally, plug-in electric cars can be recharged via the electricity produced by 
the fuel cells. Recharging will occur mostly at night, but at this time the home 
is using minimal power so the load is spread out.
The Future of Fuel Cells
Since first being used to successfully drive a transport vehicle (a bus) in 
1997, a whole host of new applications have been achieved for fuel cells, 
as the earlier section mentioned. At this point, fuel cell viability has been 
amply demonstrated. The problem is that hydrogen fuel cells still cost too 
much, but it’s only a matter of time before fuel cells become competitive with 
common energy sources.
Currently, hydrogen fuel cells as an energy source are rare because of their 
high cost, only being found in research institutions and university engineer-
ing labs. But much progress is being made, and the promise is so outstand-
ingly bright that a lot of new research money is being directed toward 
developing hydrogen energy schemes. The growth in viable hydrogen tech-
nology is increasing geometrically.
Despite the fact that fuel cells in general are pie-in-the-sky at this point in 
time, their importance is critical to understanding alternative energy sources. 
Even if the proponents’ wildly optimistic projections fall short, fuel cells are 
going to be ubiquitous within the next decade. Most likely, hydrogen will play 
a major role, but will never completely displace other forms of energy pro-
duction. But even if that’s true, the world will be much better off.
Still, a number of hurdles must be crossed for hydrogen fuel cells to become 
commercially viable:
 
✓ The lifetimes and reliability of fuel cells must be improved. Despite their 
relative simplicity, fuel cells wear out just like batteries, and in light of 
their high price, are very costly to replace.
 
✓ Initially, fuel cell vehicles are going to cost more than $100,000, which 
is around four times the typical price of a new car with similar perfor-
mance characteristics. While people are willing to pay more for green 
technologies, this 4 to 1 ratio must come down to something on the 
order of 1.5 to 1 before widespread market acceptance occurs.

260
Part III: Alternatives — Buildings 
 
✓ Hydrogen fuel prices need to come down. Extraction methods need to 
be developed which put the cost of raw hydrogen fuel on a par with 
fossil fuel competitors. However, if cap and trade policies and carbon 
taxes are implemented, the gap in raw fuel costs will be decreased by a 
big margin since hydrogen is such an environmentally benign source of 
energy.
 
✓ Hydrogen fuels obtained from fossil fuels are by far the cheapest option, 
at present. This does not solve our energy problems, and in light of the 
inefficiencies inherent in extracting hydrogen may even make matters 
worse. New extraction techniques that work with biomass need to be 
developed and perfected, and even then, there are not enough biofuels 
to satisfy the demand for hydrogen, if it’s anywhere near what projec-
tions indicate it may be.
 
✓ Hydrogen gas is easily ignitable, and poses inherent dangers. Storage 
means must be developed which are reliable and safe. But the fact is, 
when hydrogen burns it burns very quickly, and the only product is 
water. Combusting hydrogen emits 90 percent less heat than combust-
ing fossil fuels, so the danger of being burned is much smaller. But this 
is a tough sell to consumers who only hear the word “danger.”
 
✓ Transport of hydrogen gas can be problematic as hydrogen is a very 
small molecule that tends to leak through containers. And since humans 
have no sensory perception of hydrogen gas, there is no detecting leaks. 
Keep in mind that the Hindenburg airship caught on fire in 1937 and 35 
of the passengers died. There were movies of this accident shown world-
wide, and many people still associate hydrogen with the Hindenburg. 
Yes, it’s the same stuff.
 
✓ Finding an effective way to deliver hydrogen to the fuel cells used in the 
transport sector is also becoming a show stopper. It will take consider-
able investment in expensive infrastructure to provide enough hydrogen 
filling stations to interest people in buying very expensive new cars that 
run on hydrogen.
 
✓ Compressed hydrogen gas has a low density and so it has a low energy-
to-volume ratio as well. Vehicles that use hydrogen have larger tanks, 
and travel less distance between fill ups. Advances in storage will need 
to be made in order to solve this problem.
 
✓ An alternative to carrying onboard hydrogen gas is to incorporate 
onboard partial-oxidation reformers into the vehicle which convert 
fossil fuels into hydrogen fuel. The technologies are immature at this 
point, but this may be the most promising solution.

arious alternative energy schemes are being devel-
oped for the transport sector of the economy. A 
number of alternative fuels are already available, includ-
ing biomass-produced methane, propane, and biofuels. 
The first cars were all-electric, and in Chapter 18, I 
describe the advantages (and disadvantages) of electric 
cars, which are seeing a major resurgence. In Chapter 19, I 
describe how hybrid vehicles work and why they make so 
much sense. Chapter 20 addresses fuel cell–powered 
transport, which many believe (perhaps prematurely) is 
going to be key to a fossil fuel–independent future. In 
Chapter 21, I present some of the more promising exotic 
transportation options, such as magnetic levitation trains 
and nuclear-powered cargo and passenger ships.

urrently, the internal-combustion engine (ICE) powers the vast majority 
of vehicles, but this wasn’t always the case. Some of the earliest auto-
mobiles were powered by electricity. The future of transport harkens back to 
this pre-ICE era. Getting there will take considerable investment in both infra-
structure and ingenuity, but the baseline has already been established, by 
the earliest car designers, no less. How’s that for a little technological irony? 
In this chapter I describe how transport power has evolved, how current 
advancements are driving new technologies, and why all-electric transport is 
a good thing. 
Turning the Pages of Alternative 
Vehicle History
At the turn of the last century, steam power, fueled by coal or wood, was all 
the rage. It powered factories and locomotives, all the while belching thick, 
black smoke clouds (borne of a basically inefficient technology). Because 
steam engines were a mature technology at the time, it only made sense 
that they be used for cars. Internal-combustion engines, still in their infancy, 
required a lot more complexity and support equipment than a simple steam 
engine. But steam had its own disadvantages, which fueled the search for 
alternatives. The following sections explore the scope of alternative vehicles 
throughout history from steam-powered to electric to hybrids.

264
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
The glory days of steam
In 1825, the Goldsworthy Gurney company in England built a practical, steam-
powered car that could travel over 80 miles in ten hours. That’s 8 miles per 
hour, which is not much faster than a horse. Fuel was prevalent however. If 
you ran out, all you had to do was take a hatchet into the woods and chop 
away for a little while.
In 1897, steam-powered transport was more prevalent than gasoline-powered 
transport simply because internal-combustion engines were so much more 
complicated. And although electricity was the most favored form of power 
(because you could simply hop into an electric car, press the accelerator, 
and be on your way), steam power was the most common form of auto pro-
pulsion in the United States. Manufacturers sold 1,681 steam cars that year; 
1,571 electric cars; and only 930 gasoline-powered cars.
But steam was not without its problems. It took a considerable amount of 
time for the steam boiler to get up to temperature. You could not simply 
jump into a steam-powered auto and take off. You had to start a fire and wait 
until the raw fuels were burning hot enough to boil water. Then you had to 
continuously feed the fire with new fuel and remove the cinders and ash 
products that were left behind in the combustion process. Plus, if you were 
anywhere near the engine, it was a rather hot venture. 
Electric-powered vehicles
The first electric vehicle was built in 1839 by a Robert Anderson. Electric 
motors are very compact and dense compared to gasoline engines, and they 
run silently — all good things. The main problem with electric cars is the 
batteries. 
Back in the day, batteries weren’t rechargeable. When the batteries ran out, 
new ones had to be installed. Plus, batteries weigh a lot and are made of nox-
ious chemicals that can cause dangers if used improperly. 
 
Battery technology is still the main limitation of electric-powered vehicles. 
Despite new high-tech battery technologies, they still weigh a lot and are still 
made of expensive, potentially dangerous chemicals.
Despite these problems, electric vehicles of all kinds proliferated during the 
first couple of decades of the 20th century, beating out gasoline-powered 
autos. The reason for the popularity of early electric cars was that they were 

265
 Chapter 16: Alternative Transport Technologies
much simpler, lighter weight, easier to fix, and safer — attributes that all sub-
sequent versions of the electric car can also claim. Because of these advan-
tages electric cars have always been just around the corner. They probably 
would’ve rounded the bend already if not for the darn batteries. Battery tech-
nology has been steadily creeping forward, and with the burgeoning concern 
for the environment, there is even more impetus to develop electric cars. In 
Chapter 18, I describe the newest electric car technologies. Battery issues 
aside, while there is still a ways to go, electric cars are now competitive eco-
nomically and technologically with fuel-driven cars, and they’re a lot cleaner 
to boot. 
Hybrids enter the scene
In an attempt to solve the battery problems associated with all-electric cars, 
hybrid vehicles were developed. The first hybrids used gasoline engines only 
to generate electricity, which was then fed into an electrical motor which 
directly powered the wheels. A number of versions of this basic design were 
developed, none of them gaining widespread acceptance.
But with advancements in battery technologies, and with increased con-
cern about environmental harm from fossil fuel combustion, hybrids have 
become one of the best alternatives to the internal-combustion engine. 
Hybrids feature gas mileage figures over 50 percent better than equivalent 
gasoline-driven autos, and the lifetimes of the battery banks have increased 
from a couple years to over ten years. Some auto manufacturers are war-
ranting hybrid battery banks for the lifetime of the car. For more on the 
design, technology, and characteristics of hybrid cars, head to Chapter 19.
Leavin’ on a jet . . . car?
Gas turbines (See Chapter 5 for more details on 
turbines) were also used in early auto technolo-
gies. A turbine is closely related to a jet engine, 
although with a jet engine it’s the high-velocity 
exhaust gases that move the plane. When a tur-
bine is used in an auto, the power is channeled 
directly to the transmission, which drives the 
wheels. Turbines can run on a variety of fuels 
with equal effectiveness, and this was seen as 
a major benefit. 
Due to some initial successes it was believed 
that all cars would eventually be powered by 
turbines. But turbines were notorious gas 
pigs. Efficiency was terrible and the sound 
was enough to break eardrums. Contrast this 
with the silence of electric cars and it’s easy 
to see why turbines died out for use in vehicle 
transport.

266
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Evolving from Mechanical to Electrical
Each of the mechanical parts of a conventionally-powered internal-combustion 
engine (ICE) weighs a lot, and takes up a lot of room as well. (For a complete 
discussion of how internal-combustion engines work, both diesel versions 
and gasoline versions, head to Chapter 5.) Mechanical parts wear from fric-
tion, and there is a lot of leakage of lubricants (called evaporative emissions, 
a source of air pollution). There are literally hundreds of parts that need to be 
changed out, like belts, pumps, and fans. Collectively, the drivetrain parts of 
a typical conventional auto comprise around half of the total vehicle weight.
To address inefficiencies associated with internal-combustion engines, some 
significant changes have occurred in the last couple of decades, all made pos-
sible by the advancements of silicon-based microprocessors. The following 
sections take you along for the ride from a more mechanically based ICE to 
an electrical one.
Watching the rise of silicon
Silicon-based microprocessors have revolutionized the world over the last 
few decades. From year to year, computer technology improves by leaps and 
bounds. With these microprocessors, computers process huge amounts of 
information efficiently and quickly. 
But silicon control of high power, meaning hundreds of horsepower, has 
lagged behind. This is now changing, and it’s possible to control automobile-
sized scales of power via silicon transistors. Due to these advances in silicon 
power control technologies, the internal-combustion engine has been chang-
ing radically in the last two decades. 
Every year, more and more of a typical car’s powertrain will be converted 
from mechanical to electrical, controlled principally by digital computers. 
This is made possible by the improved technology of silicon power control 
chips. Silicon power chips, like their micro-sized brethren used to power 
a computer, have been improving drastically over the last few decades. 
They’re getting better and cheaper all the time, and this provides an excel-
lent opportunity to make cars cheaper and more efficient as well.

267
 Chapter 16: Alternative Transport Technologies
Decreasing demand for 
mechanical controls
Internal-combustion logic is still the same as it was back in the days of the 
steam engine: Valves click and snap against each other. Friction consumes a 
large portion of an engine’s overhead (that is, it takes a lot of power simply to 
run an engine, which is inefficient), and the peripheral control mechanisms 
surrounding an engine consume around the same weight as the engine itself. 
Radiators full of coolant, for example, are required to maintain an engine at 
very specific operating temperatures. Generators provide the car’s electri-
cal systems with power and these take even more weight. Elaborate timing 
mechanisms operate belts and pulleys and valves, all of which rub against 
each other and wear out. 
Compared to the elegance and simplicity of modern microprocessors, an 
internal-combustion engine resembles a Rube Goldberg contraption, and the 
entire process is extremely inefficient. In fact, a coal-fired electrical power 
plant is twice as efficient at converting raw fossil fuels into useable power 
than an internal-combustion engine is.
The trend toward more electrical control is very strong because with better 
valve controls and better fuel sensors, new engines are far more efficient 
than older versions. 
While the first cars were electrical and quite simple in both construction and 
operation, today’s autos feature over 5,000 feet of copper wire with hundreds 
of connectors, fuses, and relays to transmit the electrical power where it is 
needed. Electrical demand in a modern auto is increasing by 5 percent per 
year, whereas the mechanical demands are decreasing due to better designs 
and improved efficiencies.
 
The cost of a new car is disproportionately heading toward electrical comput-
ers over gears and mechanical devices. In fact, Detroit now spends more on 
etched silicon control devices than on steel. 
Getting efficient: Same power, less weight 
Since humans first began riding horses for transportation there has been 
approximately one ton of vehicle weight to move one human passenger. This 
ratio has been consistent through the development of automobiles and pas-
senger jets. A ten-to-one vehicle-to-passenger ratio means that the energy 
efficiency ratio is also ten-to-one. 

268
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Most of an automobile’s weight is dedicated to the engine, transmission, and 
drivetrain. Masses of steel are required to ensure the integrity necessary 
to support the mini-explosions caused by compressing the fuel-air mixture 
within engine cylinders. Heavy gear boxes are required to enable an ICE 
to operate at its most efficient levels. All this weight increases inefficiency 
because most of the energy expended on transportation is basically wasted 
on transporting the transportation, as opposed to the passengers and cargo. 
Therefore, making engines lightweight and using very energy-dense fuels can 
reduce these inefficiencies.
As electrical power controls become more refined and intelligent, the 
mechanical powertrains will give way to electric motors, which weigh far 
less and take up much less space. Electric motors can be connected to the 
wheels, without need for complex transmissions and gear boxes. 
Recognizing the car of the future
For an auto of the future, the starter motor of a conventional auto is now 
replaced by a dual-purpose starter/alternator. Battery power is used to 
crank the starter, and the ICE comes on, at which point the starter/alternator 
switches into alternator mode and hundreds of kilowatts of electrical power 
are produced. This electrical power is then used to power all the onboard 
functional devices.
Each wheel on a car can have its own electric drive motor, and the net weight 
of four electrical motors will be much less than the net weight of all the gears 
and transmissions parts that they displace in a conventional car. The ride 
will be better as well. Cars will shed literally hundreds of pounds of weight 
without sacrificing an ounce of performance.
This car design is far more efficient than a conventionally-powered ICE 
because the car will weigh so much less, and electrical power can be pre-
cisely controlled by an onboard microprocessor to channel power only when 
and where it is needed. 
If this seems futuristic, the General Electric AC6000CW locomotive is now 
powered by huge diesel-fueled (efficient and clean burning; see Chapter 17 
for more on diesel fuels) electrical generators. The entire machine is electric, 
aside from the diesel engine which does nothing but turn a generator that 
produces electrical power. Large trucks are also on the road that run the 
same way: The diesel engine simply turns a big generator and all the motive 
force is provided by electric motors coupled to the wheels.

 Chapter 16: Alternative Transport Technologies
Military platforms like jet planes and submarines are all electric, as are 
aircraft carriers. The Segway, an 80-pound, dual-wheel scooter is entirely 
electric. The performance of each of these examples exceeds that of their 
conventional counterparts.
One problem with this scheme is the unreliability of digital controls. You 
have surely experienced your computer crashing. You need to turn it off and 
then reboot it to get it working again. With too much computerized intel-
ligence onboard a vehicle, there is a possibility that the control system will 
crash. Much development is being directed at this problem, and the most 
promising solution is to use redundant computer controllers so that when 
one goes down, others are still on line. With the low cost of computers, this 
does not add a lot to the total cost of the vehicle.
Coming Full Circle — 
and Back to Electric
Over the last century, internal-combustion engines are supported by a mas-
sive infrastructure and intellectual property in the technologies. Companies 
have spent untold millions developing new ideas and machines, and when 
an industry changes, all those investment dollars are wasted and new invest-
ment dollars need to be spent on the new technologies. Companies don’t like 
to waste their money, so they tend to resist new technologies, not because 
they’re inferior but because it’s uneconomical. In addition every corner gas 
station has a mechanic that can recite the details of internal-combustion 
operation. It will take a considerable investment in new infrastructure before 
all-electric vehicles displace internal-combustion vehicles.
Electrical load in modern cars
The total electrical load in a car is now about 
1 kilowatt, which is a lot of power. Peak loads 
exceed 2 kilowatts (air conditioners and heat-
ers take a lot of power, as do big stereos). By 
contrast, the mechanical power plant in an ICE 
vehicle outputs around 100 kilowatts, with an 
average output of 20 kilowatts.

Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Whereas the gasoline-powered vehicle was the alternative of yesteryear, 
supplanting steam- and electricity-powered vehicles, today the tables have 
turned, and electric-powered vehicles are making a comeback. After several 
years being transported by gasoline-powered engines, cars are once again 
returning to their electrical roots and, in the process, becoming little more 
than large electrical appliances — a trend that will continue to grow over the 
next few decades. The goal? To completely displace the internal-combustion 
engine, and with it all the fossil fuel problems inherent to internal combustion. 
Barring a complete turn away from internal-combustion engines, the other 
option is to create alternative fuels that make internal-combustion engines 
more efficient. See most of the remaining chapters in this part — Chapters 17 
through 20 — to examine all these other alternatives. 

Chapter 17
Alternative-Fuel Vehicles
In This Chapter
▶ Using natural gas as an alternative fuel
▶ Factoring in flex fuels
▶ Continuing advances with biodiesel and clean diesel
A
number of alternative fuels for vehicles have been developed and 
tested to replace the conventional gasoline and diesel energy sources. 
The goal is to use renewable, clean sources of energy, and to effect better 
efficiencies. 
This chapter explains three of the main alternative fuels: natural gas, flex 
fuels, and biodiesel.
Natural Gas in the Tank
Although natural gas (in gaseous form) is commonly associated with home 
and commercial heating, it can also be used to power a vehicle. Nowadays, 
natural gas is used to power a number of buses and garbage trucks, but 
the expenses are higher than for conventional gasoline-powered vehicles 
because the technology is still rare. But this is changing. The following sec-
tions explore the advantages as well as the practical applications of natural 
gas as an alternative for vehicle fuel.
 
Around the turn of the last century, natural gas was used before gasoline in 
early vehicles. Because gasoline is easier to transport and pump into a tank, 
when the first gasoline-powered vehicles hit the road, the use of natural gas 
quickly diminished. 

272
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Advantages to natural gas
With the new interest in renewable and domestic energy supplies, natural 
gas is once again being considered as a fuel source for vehicles. Natural gas 
can be made of many different biomass sources, as explained in Chapter 13. 
The key environmental advantage is that the carbon emitted by biomass-
produced natural gas is a closed loop. When fossil fuels are drilled from 
the ground, the carbon released by combustions has been sequestered 
deep within the earth for millions of years. By releasing this carbon into the 
atmosphere, the net amount of carbon in the atmosphere increases. When 
biomass sources are used to produce natural gas, the carbon merely changes 
forms, so there is no net increase of carbon in the atmosphere.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of natural gas propulsion is the fact that it 
relieves our dependence on foreign oil supplies. Eighty-five percent of the 
natural gas used in this country is domestically produced. Contrast that with 
less than 45 percent of the crude oil that is consumed here. Furthermore, of 
all the natural gas that America does import, most of it comes from Canada, 
which has a friendly, stable political system. Even then, imports are rising, 
and most of the current natural gas reserves are in Russia, which may be an 
even more problematic source of raw fuels than the Mideast.
Producing natural gas
The most common variety of natural gas is methane, or CH4 (four hydrogen 
atoms, one carbon atom). Waste materials like compost from farms is con-
verted into methane gas, which produces both fertilizers and fuel suitable for 
use in a natural gas vehicle. The gas is fed into a pipeline distribution system 
or into large holding tanks. The gas may be used for both home heating and 
vehicle propulsion. 
Natural gas production is local. It can be produced on farms, or in small 
quantities at special plants dedicated to the purpose. The plants are not par-
ticularly expensive, so natural gas is price competitive to regular gasoline.
One quick note, that you may find interesting, alarming, or just a tad of both: 
The production of natural gas from biomass may lead to the spread of nasty 
little microorganisms and pathogens. This is the stuff of science-fiction 
movies, but it’s not out of the realm of possibility.

273
 Chapter 17: Alternative-Fuel Vehicles
Natural gas vehicles
Natural gas vehicles incorporate internal-combustion engines (ICEs) that 
have been modified to work with the natural gas. Converting conventional 
engines to natural gas is relatively easy; a skilled mechanic can do it in a 
weekend. The United States currently has over 150,000 natural gas vehicles. 
Before you start converting all of the vehicles in your garage to natural gas 
vehicles, check out the considerations in the following sections to be sure 
you know all the facts.
Exhaust emissions
The exhaust emissions are much less than with conventional engines. The 
Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that natural gas vehicles emit 90 per-
cent less carbon monoxide and 60 percent less nitrous oxides. In addition, 
natural gas engines emit around 35 percent less carbon dioxide. Natural gas-
powered engines are more efficient at converting the potential energy of the 
raw fuel into motive force for the vehicle. In addition to less emission per unit 
of raw fuel, therefore, natural gas vehicles get better gas mileage, too.
Performance advantages
First the good news: A well-maintained natural gas vehicle will last longer 
than a conventional vehicle. Because natural gas burns cleaner than conven-
tional gasoline, there are fewer combustion byproducts that can blow the 
piston rings and contaminate the lubricants used by the engine. No gaso-
line filters are required and the fuel injectors don’t jam the same way that 
conventionally-powered vehicles do. In addition, the cost of natural gas fuel 
is around half that of gasoline, which translates into a much smaller per mile 
cost to drive.
Performance limitations
Now the not-so-good news: Natural gas-powered vehicles, while more effi-
cient than conventional fossil fuel vehicles, are limited in terms of the power 
they can produce. Natural gas-powered cars are slow off the mark, and can 
have problems accelerating up hills.
Natural gas is also more difficult to deal with than liquids: It must be com-
pressed to a pressure of around 3,000 pounds per square inch, so tanks and 
containers must have a lot of integrity and meet special safety requirements 
and undergo periodic inspections by licensed professionals. These tanks are 
also heavier and larger than conventional gasoline tanks, which makes for a 
more crowded vehicle. In addition, you have to constantly monitor the natu-
ral gas tank to make sure there are no leaks and that the tank is maintaining 
its pressure. 

274
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
The one real practical limitation is that you cannot take a natural gas vehicle 
cross country because you simply can’t get it filled in most places (see the 
next section “Availability of natural gas for vehicles” for more information). 
Therefore, natural gas vehicles are somewhat like electric cars in that they’re 
primarily suited for close-to-home lifestyles. 
Availability of natural gas for vehicles
Natural gas is available in most urban areas, so there is already an infrastruc-
ture for the transport of natural gas through pipelines — to homes. Getting 
natural gas from a gas station is a different matter. Before the majority of gas 
stations can provide natural gas, money will have to be invested in pumps and 
tanks. Until then, finding a gas station where you can fill up won’t be easy. 
Of the more than 150,000 natural gas vehicles in use in the United States, 
most belong to corporate and government fleets precisely because of the 
infrastructure challenges. Some cities, for example, have fleets of natural gas 
vehicles that are serviced at a central hub that provide refilling of the natural 
gas tanks. 
Fortunately, gas stations — or centrally located hubs — aren’t the only 
options. Natural gas is available in homes throughout most of the urban 
areas in the country. It is possible, with special equipment, to use this as a 
source to fill up your vehicle’s tank. The equipment (called a Phill) is expen-
sive, but some tax credits are available that lowers the cost of the equipment. 
If Phill is used, fueling your car with natural gas can be very safe and reli-
able. The biggest benefit? You never have to visit another filling station. That 
counts for something.
Repairs and safety
Under most conditions, a natural gas vehicle is just as safe as a conventional 
auto. It might seem more dangerous to drive around with a tank of com-
pressed gas, but conventional autos have a tank of liquid, highly flammable 
fuel as well. In accidents, natural gas tanks may puncture, but the historical 
record has not shown that there are more injuries or deaths as a result.
The costs to repair are about the same as for a conventional vehicle, 
although not all mechanics can fix a natural gas vehicle. In fact, most 
mechanics want nothing to do with natural gas vehicles simply because they 
represent a bigger risk if something goes wrong. If you want to own a natural 
gas vehicle, it’s wise to scout out how you’ll get it maintained and repaired 
beforehand. If there’s nobody around who will do it, you can find a better 
alternative.
 
Here’s one more thing to consider: Natural gas stinks like rotten eggs. This 
may or may not be a problem, but most people find the smell objectionable. 
You may smell the gas from leaks and also when the tank is being filled up, in 
which case the smell dissipates quickly. If you continue to smell natural gas, 
shut the valve off at the tank and call a service technician.

 Chapter 17: Alternative-Fuel Vehicles
Flex Fuels for Vehicles
Flex fuels are made by mixing ethanol (fuel made from corn and other bio-
mass products, as I explain in Chapter 13) with gasoline in varying propor-
tions. The most common mixture ratio is 90/10, or 90 percent gasoline and 
10 percent ethanol. E10 is suitable for use in any conventional auto, and auto 
manufacturers recommend its use because of its high performance, low emis-
sion operation. The common term for this gasoline-ethanol mixture is gaso-
hol. Most people are not aware that most gasoline supplies now include some 
ethanol (E10). Half of the United States’ supply of gasoline is now blended 
with ethanol so you’ve probably been using it without even knowing about it. 
Another common flex fuel is E85, which is a mixture of 85 percent ethanol to 
15 percent gasoline. This is a much higher ratio than the E10 fuel and implies 
a different engine tuning setup. For that reason, not all cars can use E85. 
The following sections explore the accessibility of ethanol as well as how it’s 
produced and used in vehicles right now.
Sources of ethanol
In the United States, most ethanol is made of corn, but it can also be made 
of sugar cane and switch grass, among other things. In Brazil, a major pro-
ducer of sugar cane, for example, sugar cane is the key source for ethanol. In 
theory, ethanol can be made from most any cellulose, which is a fancy name 
for plant matter including trees, seaweed, corn, food waste, and so on.
The majority of the ethanol produced in the world comes from corn, which 
is in abundance in the Midwestern United States. Corn belt states (the Corn 
Desert) have seen a surge in demand in their main agricultural product due 
to the intense interest in flex fuel technologies. A lot of federal government 
subsidies have been directed toward the ethanol industry, and every year 
there are more and more production facilities coming on line.
Sugar cane is also used for ethanol production, but the quantities produced 
are so much smaller than those for corn that the contribution is minor. Sugar 
cane does feature some environmental benefits over corn, so it may be that 
in the future the use of sugar cane to produce ethanol is a quickly expanding 
business.
 
Biomass is a renewable resource. When corn and other biomass products are 
used to produce ethanol, the crop can be regrown in perpetuity. The produc-
tion of ethanol, explained in the next section, is a great benefit to farmers, 
since it results in increasing demand for their products. Yet by using so much 
of the nation’s corn supply to produce ethanol, there is a shortage of corn for 

276
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
the food supply. Corn is a major factor in the world’s food supply, and when 
demand for corn goes up, so do the prices. As a result, there are shortages of 
food in some parts of the world that can least afford shortages. This is becom-
ing a big political football, since the benefits of mixing ethanol with gasoline 
(E10 is widespread) are very attractive, yet the fact is, people in the world are 
starving because of it. The key challenge is determining the right balance 
between corn used for energy needs and corn used for food.
Producing ethanol 
To produce ethanol, soybeans, corn, or other agricultural products are 
milled down into a fine powder, which becomes a slurry liquid. Enzymes are 
added to create glucose, and then yeast is added and the material is allowed 
to ferment (the same process used to make whiskey). This liquid is distilled 
to separate the ethanol from the base liquid. Because ethanol is produced 
from biomass, the carbon cycle is closed. 
 
Ethanol is produced by fermenting grains and other biomass materials, so it 
falls within the category of biofuel (biogas and biodiesel). The production pro-
cess is similar to the way hard alcohol is made, and there is a vast and mature 
technology base. 
Because ethanol is domestically produced, money and jobs stay in the coun-
try rather than going overseas to dubious fossil fuel-producing countries. 
Ethanol can be produced on site, in small quantities. Farms can produce 
ethanol out of waste products that would normally not be productive for any-
thing else. 
As for the cost (at the pump) of ethanol, subsidies are such a large compo-
nent of the production cycle that the cost a user pays for a gallon of ethanol 
is determined by subsidies more than anything else. Ultimately, the govern-
ment’s objective for all alternative-energy sources is to make them competi-
tive with fossil fuels, and so ethanol is more or less competitive. In light of 
the pollution and political advantages, paying a little more for ethanol-based 
fuels is worth it to many consumers.
Flex fuel vehicles
Since 1980, the biggest automakers have built over 10 million vehicles that 
can run on E85 (this is far more than the number of hybrids on the road). In 
Brazil, a country that adopted a particularly aggressive policy toward the use 
of flex fuels, over 90 percent of their cars and trucks run off of ethanol/gaso-
line mixtures in varying proportions. This has significantly reduced Brazil’s 
reliance on foreign fossil fuel suppliers.

277
 Chapter 17: Alternative-Fuel Vehicles
Flex fuel vehicles have a major advantage over other types of alternative 
fuel vehicles in that they operate in basically the same way as conventional 
vehicles that run on gasoline. The engines used for flex fuel are only slightly 
different than those for conventional vehicles. When the ethanol mix is low 
(E10), most conventional engines can burn the gasohol without having to 
modify the engine at all. 
 
Not all vehicles can run off of a flex fuel, and using it can damage the vehicle’s 
engine and support systems (due to the corrosive nature of the fuel). This is 
not so much a problem with E10, as with E85. Before you put a flex fuel in your 
car, make sure it’s one that can use it. If you’re not sure whether your car is a 
flex fuel vehicle or not, look for exterior badges and a yellow fuel cap: these 
mark a flex fuel vehicle. Older versions do not have such markings, and you’ll 
need to consult your owner’s manual.
Engine performance and design issues
The driving characteristics of a flex fuel vehicle are the same as for a conven-
tional vehicle. The engine performance of a flex fuel vehicle is the same or 
better as a gasoline-fueled vehicle. Because flex fuels have a higher octane 
rating than conventional gasoline, flex fuel cars and trucks experience less 
knocking (which occurs when the ignition in the engine is not timed just 
right — the result is an irritating ping sound). Flex fuel vehicles may be tuned 
to optimize the mixture, resulting in even better performance.
Ethanol offers another advantage: It freezes at lower temperatures than con-
ventional gasoline, and so in cold climates it offers a performance advantage 
when cold startups are the norm.
On the down side, on a gallon to gallon basis, E85 has less potential energy 
than conventional gasoline. This means that a tank of E85 will propel a vehi-
cle a shorter distance than a conventionally-fueled vehicle. Because flex fuels 
have less bang per gallon, fuel costs are generally higher on a mile to mile 
basis. This is partially offset by the improved performance, so it may turn out 
to be a wash.
Because flex fuels are more corrosive than pure gasoline, special hoses and 
fittings are required in order to ensure long-term vehicle reliability. Flex fuel 
vehicles also require special fuel injectors and sensors in order to properly 
adjust the fuel/air mixture injected into the engine cylinders. These modifica-
tions are not expensive, so most existing vehicles can be easily converted to 
run off of high-mixture flex fuels (higher than E10).
 
Altogether, hybrids (see Chapter 19) offer more performance advantages 
than flex fuel vehicles, and will likely outnumber them in the future. But since 
flex fuels can be used in most existing vehicles, the market for flex fuels will 
increase as the need to wean ourselves off of foreign oil becomes more 
imperative.

278
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Accessibility of flex fuels
Flex fuel can be hard to find. While fueling stations commonly offer E10, they 
don’t commonly offer E85. For strictly flex fuel vehicles (that is, those than 
can run only on E85), it’s difficult to find the E85 product. Of the more than 
170,000 retail gasoline stations nationwide, only 900 of them sell E85. E85 
pumps are also more expensive to install than conventional gasoline pumps. 
Because flex fuel vehicles can run off of conventional gasoline, most flex fuel 
vehicle owners are not filling their tanks with flex fuel.
Exhaust emissions
Flex fuel vehicles have lower exhaust emissions than conventional powered 
vehicles. Ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide, a noxious gas that 
is imperceptible to the human senses. Since ethanol is made from biomass 
products, its use does not contribute to global warming.
According to the EPA, the use of ethanol blends can lower carbon emissions 
by as much as 40 percent, and smog forming nitrous oxides by up to 20 per-
cent. Greenhouse gas reductions of more than 30 percent have been mea-
sured. E85, for example, which has a relatively large oxygen content, burns 
more completely in the combustion cycle, making for better efficiency and 
lower emissions of both carbon byproducts and other noxious chemicals like 
sulfur and nitrogen oxides. 
Clean Diesel and Biodiesel Vehicles
 
Diesel is more of a combustion method than an actual fuel (refer to Chapter 5 
for an explanation of how diesel engines work). Basically, the process is more 
efficient than a conventional internal-combustion engine because of the way 
the fuel is ignited within the cylinder. The process is so simple that a diesel 
engine can burn a wide range of fuels, and the quality level can be much lower 
than that of gasoline to achieve high-performance results.
You may have some misconceptions about diesel and its cleanliness as well 
as how it can be used to power vehicles today. So check out the following 
sections to get up to date on the technology and advancements diesel is 
making in the auto industry.
Diesel then and now
Diesel-powered automobiles and trucks have a bad rap. While Europeans 
have embraced diesel-powered autos due to their reliability and economy, 
Americans only flirted with them briefly in the early 1980s, during the Arab 

279
 Chapter 17: Alternative-Fuel Vehicles
oil embargo, and then, for the most part, abandoned them. Why? They’re 
smelly and dirty and emit soot and black exhaust (which you can clearly see 
if you’ve ever followed behind a car with a diesel engine), leaving the impres-
sion that they must be much more polluting than conventional gasoline-
driven engines. American manufacturers made matters worse by trying to 
convert existing gasoline engines into diesel engines and failing on a grand 
scale. So by the 1990s, diesel-powered cars have pretty much disappeared 
from American roads, aside from a small number of European imports.
Recent developments in diesel engine technologies have proven that diesels 
can be much more economical as well as cleaner than conventional engines. 
While hybrid cars are the current leaders in fuel-efficiency standards, diesels 
rank a close second. Testing has shown that diesels can reduce fuel con-
sumption by 30 to 60 percent. And these savings do not come at a cost of 
increased emissions. A study by the National Academy of Sciences showed 
that diesels could someday supplant gasoline engines as the power source of 
choice for a majority of autos and trucks.
Clean diesel engines
Historically diesel engines were never designed to reduce emissions or pollu-
tion. They were built for power, and they were very good at that. Most large 
trucks on the road, and most heavy construction machinery, operate with 
diesel engines. Now that the emphasis on green has grown into an entire 
industry, diesel engines are being redesigned with new criteria (lower emis-
sions and better performance), and they’ve been very successful. The follow-
ing technologies have helped to clean up diesel’s act:
 
✓ Common-rail injection system (CRIS): A breakthrough technology called 
common-rail injection system (CRIS) made diesels as clean burning as 
conventional engines. The system creates high-injection pressures that 
are independent of the engine’s speed, and this allows for a much more 
precise injection, at the exact right time in the engine’s cycle. The result 
is a lot of power with a small amount of exhaust emission. The soot that 
characterized old diesels is a thing of the past. 
 
✓ Turbochargers: Turbocharging uses the flow of exhaust gases to com-
press the oxygen being input to the combustion chamber prior to igni-
tion and results in even more efficiency. Catalytic converters have also 
been added, and a new technology called a maintenance-free particulate 
filter was developed by Mercedes Benz. The result is that diesels, when 
properly equipped, feature emission performances better than conven-
tional ICEs.

280
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Biodiesel
Biodiesel fuel is a combustible, thick liquid comprised of alkyl esters of 
fatty acids that come from cooking oil or grease. Being made of biomass, 
biodiesel is a renewable, domestically-produced energy source. And 
because it’s biomass, the carbon emitted from a biodiesel-powered engine 
is closed loop: Burning biodiesel doesn’t result in an increase of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere.
Biodiesels can be produced from wasted vegetable oils (from restaurants, and 
even from residences) and other biomass products like soybeans, which are 
the most common source of biodiesel because they’re inexpensive and widely 
available: One bushel of soybeans can be converted into a gallon of biodiesel. 
 
✓ To make biodiesel from waste products like used cooking oil and 
animal fats, the process is similar to the soybean process, but with a 
couple added steps in the process. Methyl alcohol and sulfur are mixed 
with the biodiesel raw fuel in a process known as dilute acid esterifica-
tion. The result is an oil, closely resembling pure vegetable oil, that is 
further refined into useable biodiesel. 
 
✓ To make biodiesel from soybeans, the soybeans are processed into 
an oil, and all impurities are filtered out. Methyl alcohol (among other 
things) and a catalyst like sodium hydroxide breaks the oil down in a 
process called esterification. The resulting products, called esters, are 
refined further into useable biodiesel products. 
 
 Of course, as with corn used for ethanol, there is a political question as 
to whether the production of biodiesel from soybeans and other widely 
available food crops exacerbates the world food shortage problem.
The advantages to biodiesel include:
 
✓ Biodiesel reduces dependence on foreign oil. 
 
✓ Biodiesel manufacturing plants can be small or large. 
 
✓ Biodiesel manufacturing plants can be distributed around the country 
so that transport to end users is limited, which means that much less 
fuel is expended simply getting the fuel to the customers. 
As for the downside to biodiesel:
 
✓ Unfortunately, the supplies of biodiesel are limited. 
 
✓ The idea is relatively new, and production facilities are few and far 
between. 
 
✓ Because production facilities are limited, biodiesel currently costs more 
than petrol diesel, a situation that will change as more production facili-
ties come on line and efficiencies of scale kick in.

281
 Chapter 17: Alternative-Fuel Vehicles
Clean diesel and biodiesel engines
Diesels have been built to operate much cleaner than their older brothers. 
New diesels no longer emit soot and strong odors. The best news, though, is 
that biodiesel is a cleaner burning, renewable alternative fuel that is gaining 
ground every year. 
The following sections give you more details about the pros and cons of new 
diesel and biodiesel engines.
The basics
Biodiesel is commonly blended with petroleum diesel, much like gasohol comes 
from regular gasoline mixed with ethanol. B50 is an equal proportion of bio-
diesel and petrol diesel, while B100 is pure biodiesel. By blending biodiesel 
with petrol diesel, the same environmental and political benefits are achieved 
as with ethanol flex fuels: independence from foreign fossil fuel suppliers, a 
more renewable energy source, domestic production, and so on. 
Most existing diesel engines can burn a mixture of biodiesel up to around 
B20. Newer engines have been designed to burn mixtures up to B100, with 
minor modifications. The EPA estimates that the use of 100 percent biodiesel 
will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75 percent. A blend of B20, which 
can be used in most existing biodiesel engines, will reduce emissions by 15 
percent.
 
Consult your owner’s manual if you want to burn mixtures higher than B20 
because some manufacturers will not honor warranties for engines run higher 
than that. 
Power and performance
By incorporating a much higher compression ratio than a conventional ICE, 
diesel engines can extract more power from the same amount of raw fuel, and 
because diesel fuel is typically more energy dense than gasoline, a vehicle 
can go further on a tank of gas and so refueling is less common. In addition, 
new diesels are every bit as powerful as their gasoline-fueled brethren. In 
fact, diesel engines, by their very nature, have more torque, which is useful in 
accelerating and going up hills. Diesels can also pull heavy trailers without as 
much strain on the engine.
Biodiesel, on the other hand, doesn’t offer the same performance as petrol 
diesel. What these engines gain in efficiency, they lose in power. They can’t 
deliver the same power levels, and acceleration is slower and hill climbing is 
more of a chore. On the up side, biodiesel is much safer than an equivalent 
petroleum product because it’s less combustible. The fuel is less flammable 
than for a conventional vehicle, and it’s less likely to explode in an accident. 
Still, storage, handling, and transport of biodiesel requires a lot of care and 
attention.

282
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Because diesels are simpler than gasoline-powered engines, they last longer 
and wear down less (this results in the use of less invested energy in the 
manufacture of these engines as well — a very attractive side benefit). They 
also require less maintenance, since they don’t need spark plugs and a 
firing control mechanism. Oil changes are required more often with a diesel 
because there is more soot deposited on the interior engine surfaces.
Efficiency and emissions
In general, diesel engines are around 20 to 30 percent more efficient than a con-
ventional ICE, with some designs offering up to 50 percent more efficiency. 
The combustion of biofuels produces less greenhouse gases than the com-
bustion of pure petrol diesel. Biodiesel also contains less sulfur, responsible 
for acid rain, especially when made from soybeans and pure vegetable 
products. Biodiesel also emits less carbon monoxide and other particulate 
matters. On the downside, diesels emit more nitrous oxides (responsible for 
smog) than conventional engines, even if biodiesel is used.
And, because biodiesel is biodegradable, it’s also not toxic. Spills of bio-
diesel do not create environmental havoc, although they may be messy 
and inconvenient.

A
mong all the alternative vehicles being developed these days, none 
attracts more attention than the electric vehicle. People seem to 
believe that all-electric cars can solve our fossil fuel problems, and many 
people are emotionally attached to the idea. Electric cars are much simpler 
than vehicles equipped with conventional, internal-combustion engines (ICE). 
Electric cars don’t need an elaborate transmission, gears, rubber hoses, 
pumps, and all the other stuff that crowds a modern vehicle’s hood, which 
makes the idea of electric cars very attractive.
But electric cars aren’t without problems, the main one being batteries. 
Simply put, there is currently no viable battery technology that will allow 
electric vehicles to replace conventional transportation. Whether this will 
change or not is still up in the air. Batteries have come a long way, to be sure, 
but they still have a long way to go before all-electric vehicles will be able to 
provide the performance and range of fossil fuel-powered vehicles.
Nevertheless, all-electric vehicles are being developed at a fast pace. There is 
a definite market niche right now. In this chapter, I address the technology of 
electric transportation, the problems associated with batteries, and how and 
when the current crop of electric cars are best employed.

Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
A Drive Down Memory Lane
The first cars were electric simply because all-electric makes much more 
sense. Electric vehicles are simpler, at least on paper. The operation is sim-
pler as well: You simply jump in and press the accelerator and you’re moving 
along down the road. Electric cars don’t explode and they don’t need to be 
refilled. A dream come true, except for one small problem — or one very big 
problem — to be more precise: batteries.
Early electric cars, circa 1900
Thomas Edison built an electric car in 1889. His car used nickel-alkaline bat-
teries. Other manufacturers of the time used lead-acid batteries (the type 
under the hoods of modern cars). Both types of batteries simply fed the 
battery’s electricity directly to an electric motor which powered one or more 
of the wheels of the car. The next sections discuss the design and disadvantages 
of the early electric cars as well as the breakthrough in gasoline-powered 
cars that dealt such a blow to the sales of electric cars.
Early electric car design versus the ICE design
The early electric car designs were simple and very reliable, much more reli-
able than the ICE-powered cars of the time:
 
✓ Electric cars: They don’t require starting an engine. As soon as electric-
ity is applied to the electric motor, the car goes (hopefully). When more 
electricity is applied, the car goes faster. You don’t need a transmission 
because electric motors can operate over a wide range of speeds with 
equal effectiveness. Brakes and steering are the same for electrics and 
conventional, and so electrics, on net, are much simpler and more reli-
able. (To find out more about how electric cars work, see the section 
“Basic Operation of an Electric Vehicle,” later in this chapter.)
 
✓ ICEs (internal-combustion engines): These are much fussier. They 
require a whole host of support equipment like pumps, hoses, alterna-
tors, carburetors, and spark plugs, each of which can break and cause 
the car to fail. Perhaps most restrictive, ICEs can only run optimally over 
a limited range of conditions, so they require complex transmissions 
which not only are prone to failure, but also weigh the car down due to 
their necessarily massive constructions.
In 1900 a majority of the autos in production were electric. For every one 
internal-combustion engine vehicle, there were ten electric vehicles. Most of 
the manufacturers of the day built electric cars and it was believed that the 

285
 Chapter 18: Plugging In: Electric Vehicles
future would be wholly electric. Not a lot of investment money was dedicated 
to improving gasoline engines simply because electrics make much more 
sense — except for one big thing: batteries (I know, I repeat myself). 
The key problem with electric cars
Range. How far can an electric vehicle travel before it’s time to recharge the 
batteries? That’s the big question and the one whose answer doomed the orig-
inal electric cars and has caused problems for other electric cars ever since. 
For these early cars, the driving range was about 40 to 50 miles. To get more 
range with an electric car, you need more batteries, plain and simple, and 
that adds more weight, which in turn impacts how far the car can go on a 
charge. Because the first batteries weren’t rechargeable, these first electric 
cars featured throw away batteries. When the batteries ran out, you simply 
replaced them with new batteries. Imagine how much that cost! And imagine 
the disposal problem, except back in those days people didn’t really have 
disposal problems. What you didn’t want, you simply tossed into the river. 
(And we wonder how we got to our current predicament!)
 
The overall weight of an electric car is around the same for an ICE-powered 
car despite the weight savings inherent to the simpler design of the electric. 
The reason is the batteries. They take up a lot of weight, pure and simple.
In addition, batteries can only hold so much charge. As a battery ages, it can 
hold less and less charge. What this means for an electric vehicle is that, as 
the vehicle ages, its performance degrades. Add to this the fact that batteries 
take time to charge, hours of time. Electric vehicle owners must plan ahead 
at all times.
 
These are the same problems — range, charging time, weight, and charging 
capacity — that designers of modern electric vehicles need to combat. Even 
the most advanced battery technology today can only store a small percent-
age of the energy potential of a gallon of gas of the same weight and space. 
The rise of the gasoline-powered cars
Despite the problems associated with batteries, early drivers preferred the 
electric cars because ICE-powered cars had an even bigger problem: Getting 
started. 
Starting these early gasoline-powered cars required cranking a handle in the 
front of the car in order to start it. This was a fussy, often dangerous task 
because the engine could kick the crank handle backwards and break an arm. 
(This is similar to the motorcycles that require the driver to jump down on 
a starter lever in order to get the engine running. Who wants to do that?) In 
fact, many electric vehicle customers (women in particular) drove electric 
cars simply to avoid the starting process. 

286
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Then in 1912, Alfred Kettering introduced the first self-starting gasoline-powered 
vehicle, and the difficult task of starting an ICE was no longer in play. After 
the introduction of the self-starter, electric car sales plummeted and never 
recovered. Sales of electric cars essentially stopped, completely, and no 
manufacturers pursued them any longer.
Modern electric vehicles: 1960s to today
In the 1960s electric cars saw renewed investment interest due to the heavy 
amounts of smog and pollutants that were visible in the skies over cities. 
Global warming wasn’t an issue then, but it was clearly obvious what gaso-
line engines were doing to air quality. People could see smog, they knew they 
were breathing it, and they weren’t happy about it. They came to the conclu-
sion that there has to be a better way, and electric cars were the obvious 
option.
But range was still a problem, even with decades of battery development. 
Cars of this era could go, on average, 100 miles between charges. Some elec-
trical cars were built, but they didn’t attract much attention simply because 
range and performance were so limited. The most logical way to overcome 
the range problem with batteries was to make the car as light as possible. 
The lighter the car, the longer the range. But making a car lighter entails elim-
inating all the unnecessary components and features — what you or I might 
call the creature comforts, like air conditioners and stereos. As you can imag-
ine, these pared down vehicles were even less popular. 
It took federal legislation and regulations enacted by the California Air 
Resources Board (CARB) to get manufacturers moving into the realm of elec-
tric cars once again. In 1990, CARB instituted Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) 
mandates. These mandates required that within just 8 years (by 1998), 2 per-
cent of the vehicles sold in California had to emit virtually zero pollutants. It 
also mandated that this figure grow to 10 percent by 2003. Many other states 
enacted similar goals, although California had the toughest standards. 
In response, auto manufacturers scrambled to develop cars that could meet 
the stringent standards, and the race was on. A number of different options 
were pursued (hybrids, flex fuels, and so on), but it soon became clear that 
an all-electric vehicle was the best way to achieve the goals. General Motors 
built the EV-1 and brought it to market with an aggressive advertising cam-
paign. The vehicle worked well, and while it sold modestly, its promise was 
great enough that a good number were built. Ford, Toyota, and Honda also 
introduced electric cars.

287
 Chapter 18: Plugging In: Electric Vehicles
Then the bottom fell out, for reasons that are open for interpretation (refer 
to the sidebar “Who killed the electric car, redux” for details of this contro-
versy). Ultimately, the same problem with the earliest electric cars proved 
the final nail in the coffin for the fledgling electric car effort: Range was no 
greater than 70 or 80 miles, and then came the long process of recharging 
batteries.
Electric cars were abandoned by the big manufacturers, and General Motors 
even refused to renew leases on existing electric cars. The lessees were 
required to turn their vehicles in, and General Motors destroyed them. Very 
few electric vehicles are left over from that period, and now they’re mostly 
museum pieces.
The limited interest in electric cars caused CARB to back off its stringent 
mandates. They decided to address air pollution in different ways, namely 
requiring gasoline engines to be made cleaner and less polluting. 
At this point, if you want an all-electric car, you’re pretty much out of luck. 
Some small companies offer them, but they’re dicey and expensive (com-
pared to equivalent gasoline-powered vehicles). However, there are some 
new designs that are attracting a lot of attention, and there is new develop-
ment money being invested in electric vehicles. High-end electric cars are 
being sold that can outperform sports cars made by companies like Porsche 
and Mercedes. It’s interesting to note that one of the early problems was 
the lack of engine sound. Drivers want their high performance cars to “roar” 
while accelerating, so in some electric vehicles the “roaring” sound has been 
artificially added through the stereo system. 
Who killed the electric car, redux
There is still a lot of ongoing debate about “who 
killed the electric car” (the EV-1). Some people 
claim the electric cars were a phenomenal 
success story. Others claim that the electrics 
were abysmal failures because so few custom-
ers wanted them. Auto manufacturers need 
a certain minimal production level in order to 
make profits, and the number of electric cars 
being built was nowhere near that level. As to 
whether they could grow to that level, given 
enough time, is up for debate. 
As with many alternative energy schemes, 
conspiracy theories abound. Many people 
believe that the big auto manufacturers never 
wanted to build electric cars because they 
would necessarily be smaller, and simpler, and 
so would result in decreased corporate prof-
its. Conspiracy theorists hold that the electric 
cars that were sold were intentionally made to 
be inferior just so the effort would fail, and the 
auto companies could revert back to building 
their big, cushy gas guzzlers.

288
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Basic Operation of an Electric Vehicle
The basic operation of an electric car is very simple. An electrical motor 
is powered by a battery, or bank of batteries. The batteries are generally 
rechargeable and are very heavy (weight-wise) in comparison to the amount 
of energy that can be contained within a standard gas tank. The electric 
motor can be connected directly to the wheels of an electric car. There is no 
need for a transmission. In fact, a separate electric motor can be connected 
to each of the four wheels, and this allows for operation even when one of the 
motors fails, and it also allows for some incredible performance advantages 
as well. No ICE-powered car can lose its engine and keep on running. 
In addition, in an electric car, there is no need for the complex transmission 
system that an internal-combustion engine requires. Internal-combustion 
engines work well only when they’re running hard, or fast — that is, the 
crankshaft in the engine is spinning at higher revolutions per minute (RPM). 
Most of the time — like when the car is going slowly — that kind of power 
isn’t needed. The transmission’s purpose is to match the engine’s power with 
the vehicle’s speed, which it does with a complex series of gears and shafts. 
When the vehicle is travelling slow, a low gear ratio ensures that the engine 
is still operating hard (or fast). As the car’s speed increases, the gear ratio 
changes as needed. (If you’ve ever driven a manual transmission car, you 
manually shift from lower to higher gears as the car speeds up. An automatic 
transmission takes care of these shifts automatically.)
In an electric car, the motor’s drive shaft can be connected directly to the 
wheels of a car, without need for a transmission. This considerably reduces 
the weight overhead of an electrical car, and it also makes the car simpler 
and less expensive to maintain.
Not needing a transmission is a distinct advantage that an electric car has 
over internal-combustion-powered vehicles. In an ICE, as the rotational speed 
(RPMs, or revolutions per minute) increases, so does the power output (this 
is why race cars always run near the “red-line” on the tachometer). The faster 
the engine is going, the more cylinders are firing in a given amount of time 
and the more power is available (refer to Chapter 16 for an explanation of 
how internal-combustion engines work). 
With electrical motors, the power curve is much flatter than for an ICE. In 
an electric motor there are no cylinders, and no individual power impulses 
when each separate spark plug fires. The power output of an ICE is a series 
of small power blips, but the power output of an electric motor is continuous 
(okay, let’s not get overly technical here — for all practical purposes it’s con-
tinuous). An electric motor may be operated over a wide range of rotational 
speeds (RPMs) without sacrificing power output. In addition, you can get the 

289
 Chapter 18: Plugging In: Electric Vehicles
same acceleration from an electric car as a bigger ICE brother. In fact, the 
acceleration is smoother and doesn’t entail the jerking motion conventional 
vehicles exhibit when the gears are changing.
Batteries
Obviously, batteries are the key component of an electric car: They provide 
the power that drives the engine. Modern conventional autos feature engines 
that provide between 60 to over 300 horsepower and more for high perfor-
mance cars. One horsepower equals around 750 watts, so an electric vehicle 
is capable of outputting over 75 kilowatts. 
 
Batteries are rated according to their amp hours, or the amount of amps a bat-
tery can put out for a specified amount of time. A 1,000 Ah battery can output 
1,000 amps for 1 hour (at the batteries voltage), or 1 amp for 1,000 hours. To 
determine the total amount of power a battery can deliver, multiply the Ah by 
the voltage and the result is kWhs. Shelf life is the amount of time a battery 
can be stored without connecting it to a load. All batteries will weaken over 
time, whether used or not. Maximum deliverable current is the amount of cur-
rent a battery can deliver without its voltage declining significantly due to 
internal resistance. This declines as a battery ages.
Lead-acid cell battery
The most common type of battery in use today is the lead-acid cell. Lead-acid 
batteries are used in almost every conventional vehicle to start the internal-
combustion engine. Once the engine is started, the battery is recharged. 
These same types of batteries are suitable for driving an electric car, and 
until much better technologies became available (see the next section on 
nickel-based batteries), were commonly used. 
 
A plate of lead constitutes the negative electrode and a plate of lead-dioxide 
provides the positive electrode. Both plates are immersed in a solution of 
acid, most commonly sulfuric acid. The solution is referred to as the electro-
lyte. When the acid is fresh enough, a voltage difference is generated between 
the two electrodes, and a load (an electric motor, or a heater or radio) can be 
connected to receive electrical power. As the battery discharges its power 
into a load, the electrodes eventually become coated with contaminants and 
the nature of the acid changes. At some point the process burns itself out, and 
the battery can no longer deliver power to a load. On the flip side, if a current 
is delivered to the battery by an external power source (this is commonly 
called recharging, and is simply the inverse of when the battery delivers its 

290
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
power to a load — in this case, the battery is now the load), the electro-
mechanical energy in the battery is restored and the battery will once again be 
capable of driving a load. The cycle of discharging a battery into a load and 
then recharging the battery can be repeated many times. At some point, the 
chemicals become contaminated to the point where the process is simply no 
longer efficient enough and the battery is discarded or rebuilt. 
The amount of power that a lead-acid cell battery can deliver is a function of 
the acid solution (mass and purity) and the quality of the lead electrode and 
lead-dioxide electrode, along with their surface area. Over time, the quality of 
the battery components degrades, and the battery performance decreases.
Nickel-based batteries
Nickel-based battery cells include the nickel-cadmium (NICAD, or NiCd) and 
the nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) versions. Nickel-based batteries hold much 
more charge per unit volume of weight than lead-acid batteries, plus they 
are capable of more recharging cycles over the course of a lifetime (they’re 
good for literally hundreds of charge/recharge cycles). In some of the newer 
embodiments, the charge time is decreased, and all of these factors make the 
nickel-based batteries superior, performance wise, to lead-acid versions.
Nickel-based batteries come in many forms: Cylindrical cells are the tradi-
tional battery types that we have all seen so much of. Button cells are the 
kinds used in cell phones and cameras. Nickel-based cells are also used in 
space applications, where high integrity packaging is a must. Flooded cells 
are used in heavy-duty applications, such as electric vehicles. 
Nickel-based cells cannot be discharged all the way down to zero or perma-
nent damage will result. Therefore, electric cars using these types of batter-
ies have controller functions which won’t allow complete discharges. 
Practical Concerns of Electric Cars
What most people really want to know is how electric cars perform in compari-
son to conventional cars. Most people don’t really care what’s under the hood; 
they simply want to know what happens when you press the accelerator pedal.
One of the biggest changes you’ll notice as a driver of an electric car is that 
you can’t just say to yourself, “I’ll charge in the morning.” You need to plan 
ahead because, unlike internal-combustion vehicles, electric cars cannot 

291
 Chapter 18: Plugging In: Electric Vehicles
simply be filled up at the corner gas station. It takes time to charge the bat-
teries, and so foresight is a necessary component of electric car ownership. 
The following sections outline some of the other practical considerations of 
owning an electric car.
Performance
All-electric cars can be made every bit as powerful as a conventional auto, 
and some all-electrics are even more powerful. The problem with power 
is that it takes a lot of juice out of the batteries in a very short time, and 
recharging becomes necessary. The ride of an electric car is also smoother 
and quieter than the ride of a gasoline-powered car.
Keep in mind that batteries are temperature sensitive and lose some of their 
output power when temperatures fall below freezing. The more features you 
use while you’re driving your electric car, the shorter the range as well. While 
this is true for conventional autos, it takes a lot less time to refill a gas tank 
than to recharge, so the burden is less.
All-electric cars are particularly good for some applications: namely, city 
driving and driving short distances. This is one of the reasons why these 
vehicles are most common in cities, where commute distances are shorter 
than in the suburbs and where the narrow city streets and the crush of traffic 
make the generally smaller all-electric vehicles easier to maneuver. But there 
are a few things that electric cars aren’t so good at:
 
✓ Hauling loads: Don’t expect to see electric trucks anytime soon.
 
✓ Including creature comforts: Electric cars are necessarily spare and 
simple. They will not come with a lot of options and accessories simply 
because these limit the range of the vehicle.
 
✓ Long distance travel is generally out of the question: Why? Because 
there are no charging stations along the roadways — a situation that 
may change in the coming years. One scheme attracting interest is a 
battery-swap arrangement where you simply hand in your exhausted 
batteries and get freshly charged units installed in their place. This kind 
of swap will enable a quick “fill-up.”
 
The performance of an electric car is really based on the batteries it uses. 
Because battery technology is constantly improving there will likely be much 
better batteries in the next few years. It’s likely that you’ll be able to achieve a 
much better performance in a couple years by simply swapping up to a higher 
grade of battery when your old batteries need replacing. No other vehicles on 
the road can offer this promise.

292
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Service and maintenance
Electric vehicles are extremely simple compared to any other type of vehicle, 
particularly ICE-powered vehicles. Service is easy, and straightforward. There 
are no tune-ups needed, no radiator flushes, no change of spark plugs, no 
filters. A single person can remove and replace an electric motor, and there 
are very few support systems needed (like carburetors, radiators, and so on) 
that need care.
 
Because electric cars are rare, finding qualified service technicians can be pro-
hibitive. This will change over time, but it’s going to take many years before 
the infrastructure is in place to adequately handle electric cars.
Battery charging and replacement
Keep in mind the following considerations about charging and replacing the 
batteries in electric cars:
 
✓ The batteries in electric cars need to be charged regularly. Most of 
the new electric vehicles being developed include an on-board charging 
scheme so that all you have to do is plug your electric car into a wall 
outlet that provides utility power. 
 
✓ If you plug your electric car into an outlet in your garage your elec-
tricity bill is going to go through the roof. If you’re on a tiered rate 
structure (the more electricity you use, the higher the cost) you could 
be in for a major shock when you see your bill. If you can sign up for 
time-of-use (TOU) metering, an electric vehicle will work better, if you 
charge it only at night. 
 
✓ Even with the new-and-improved batteries, batteries on electric cars 
will eventually wear out and need to be replaced. The best batteries 
will last over five years, with some auto manufacturers warranting bat-
teries for the lifetime of the car. Electric cars use a good number of bat-
teries, so changing to new ones can be very expensive. It’s not a difficult 
job to change batteries, so the labor costs are low, and most hybrid and 
electric car manufacturers will not warrant a battery pack unless it’s 
changed by an approved service pro. 
 
✓ Because batteries contain a lot of harmful chemicals you can’t just 
throw them away. They must be disposed of properly (at approved 
disposal sites they will take batteries, but they charge for this service 
because they have to dismantle the batteries and dispose of the chemi-
cals via specialized processes).

293
 Chapter 18: Plugging In: Electric Vehicles
Environmental impact
Electric cars produce no tailpipe emissions and only miniscule amounts of 
evaporative emissions (emissions from evaporating fluids, like gasoline and 
oil in conventional autos). 
Despite the fact that electric cars need to be charged via grid power, which 
uses coal and other fossil fuel power sources (see the next section “Where 
you get your charge” for info you need to know about that), mile for mile, the 
pollution effect is much less for electric cars because they are smaller and 
more efficient, and widespread use of electric cars will decrease the aggre-
gate pollution levels of transportation.
Where you get your charge
The electricity to recharge the electric car’s batteries has to come from 
somewhere, and that somewhere is generally the electrical grid. Grid power 
is mostly derived from the burning of coal (52 percent, in the U.S.), a situation 
that’s not likely to change over the next few decades for reasons that I explain 
in Chapter 4. Coal is widely available, and the supplies are mostly domestic. 
Coal-fired electrical power is one of the most polluting sources. Recharging 
an electrical car from the grid is not necessarily going to solve our fossil fuel 
problems. In fact, it might make them worse if enough people buy electric 
cars because the grid will come under heavier and heavier use. The only way 
that electric cars will mitigate our dependence on fossil fuels is if they’re so 
efficient in their battery-to-wheels operation as to offset all of the inefficien-
cies encountered along the energy line. This means that electric cars need to 
be small and spare, with few creature comforts.
Of course, electric vehicles can be charged by sources other than the coal-
fired grid. If your utility derives its electrical power from a nuclear reactor, 
the net pollution created by an electric car can be very low. Some other pos-
sible scenarios include 
 
✓ Using large solar arrays mounted over parking lots. The cars beneath 
the arrays can be charged during the day when the cars are parked 
beneath the panels. This scheme reduces pollution levels even further. 
It has another advantage as well: Cars parked beneath the solar arrays 
are shielded from the sun, and are much cooler to enter after a long day 
of work. 
 
✓ Using wind power: In the same way that solar power can recharge bat-
teries, wind power can be connected to the batteries for recharge. Wind 
power has the added advantage of being available at night, or in bad 
weather.

294
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
The problem is that these sources of electrical energy are not reliable: You’re 
in trouble if you can’t charge your car during the day when the sun’s out, or if 
the day is calm or cloudy. 
The chemicals in batteries
Lead-acid batteries and NICAD batteries contain a lot of nasty chemicals. The 
sulfuric acid in a lead-acid battery causes noxious fumes like sulfur dioxide. 
Hydrogen gases are also produced, and these are explosive when exposed 
to sparks or flames. Lead and cadmium are heavy metals and cause envi-
ronmental harm when they enter the water system. NiMH batteries are less 
harmful than NICAD batteries and because of this there is a push to eliminate 
NICAD altogether.
Efficiencies
Batteries are inefficient. It takes around 10 to 20 percent more energy to 
charge a battery than the energy that can be derived from that battery. A 
12-Volt battery (the most common voltage output available — the type used 
in conventional autos) rated at 2,000 Ah required more than 24,000 Whs, 
or 24 kWhs, to fully charge. This amount of energy will drive an electric car 
for around 50 miles. The average cost of a kWh of energy from the grid is 
around 10 cents, so the cost of driving an electric car 50 miles is around 
$2.40. This varies widely, however, and doesn’t take into account the cost of 
new batteries.
Electric car safety
Rumor has it that electric cars are more dangerous than conventional autos, 
particularly in accidents. But this hasn’t been borne out by the record.
Size issues
Electric cars are generally smaller than their conventionally-powered bigger 
cousins. In fact, tiny cars are ideal for electric power. There are a number of 
small, one or two passenger vehicles on the market, which can transport one 
or two passengers over short distances.
Because electric cars are necessarily small and spare, safety is an issue. 
When a small vehicle gets into a crash with a larger vehicle, the large vehicle 
will generally win. There are so many large-sized, ICE-powered vehicles on 
the road now that it will take decades before the average size of a vehicle on 
American roads decreases. Even if the vast majority of vehicles sold in the 
next few years are small electrics, there will be a lingering size disparity.

295
 Chapter 18: Plugging In: Electric Vehicles
Voltages: The shocking truth!
Electric cars also use higher voltages to run. But higher voltages are more 
dangerous because shocks are easier to get. You can get quite a jolt messing 
around under the hood of an electric vehicle, and who can resist messing 
around under the hood of a new car?
Manufacturers have incorporated a good number of safety features into the 
designs of their electric cars. Batteries are well sealed and the high voltage 
lines are clearly marked, and when possible, insulated to the point where get-
ting a shock requires one to really try to get a shock.
Economics of electric cars
Electric cars today are very expensive. Production is limited to small manu-
facturers who don’t achieve economies of scale. This may change as more 
electric cars hit the road, but right now you’ll pay an arm and a leg for an 
electric vehicle. Tax breaks, subsidies, and rebates are available from differ-
ent government agencies, and this helps to drive the cost of driving an elec-
tric car down even further.
The cost of driving an electric vehicle, mile per mile, is less than the cost of 
driving an internal-combustion vehicle. In some cases, the costs are nearly 
one tenth. Despite the inefficiencies of the electric grid in providing power to 
recharge batteries (refer to the earlier section “Where you get your charge”), 
electric motors are very efficient compared to ICEs, and so even in regions 
where electrical utility rates are high, driving an electric car is less expensive 
than driving an ICE-powered vehicle—at least on a mile per mile basis.
And last but not least, the ultimate determining factor of the cost of an elec-
tric vehicle is the cost of batteries. There is no way to tell if battery costs are 
going to rise or fall.
The insurance industry weighs in
Insurance rates for electric vehicles will be 
higher than for conventional autos for two rea-
sons. First, the increased hazard of higher volt-
ages will result in more injuries. Second, electric 
cars are rare, and they will be for the foresee-
able future. Insurance companies don’t like 
rare cars because they are harder to replace. 
In addition, the risk that electric vehicles will 
once again disappear into the vapors of time 
means that insurance companies may not even 
be able to replace your electric vehicle, even if 
they want to. This puts the venture at risk.

296
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
 
There is an inherent risk in buying an electric car. The same fate may be in 
store for electric cars as was experienced in the 1990s. New models will be 
introduced but a few years later the manufacturers may decide to abandon 
electric cars once again. In particular, hybrids, discussed in Chapter 19, show 
more promise because they neatly and effectively solve the range problem of 
electric vehicles. If you buy an electric car, you may be left out in the cold with 
a vehicle that nobody can service, and nobody wants to take off your hands.

ll-electric vehicles are severely limited by the fact that batteries can 
only contain a certain amount of energy, and when that is used up 
the batteries need to be recharged, which takes time (hours) and special 
facilities (you need to either plug them in, or change batteries). Internal-
combustion vehicles are limited in that the efficiencies of internal-combustion 
engines (ICEs) will never be as good as electric drive, and the emissions will 
never be as low as electric vehicles. Hybrids — cars that combine electrical 
drive with an internal-combustion engine — achieve a harmonious balance 
between the best of both worlds.
Of all the alternative transportation options available today, hybrids promise 
to become the most widely accepted due to their optimal balance between 
the best of internal-combustion-driven vehicles, and all-electric vehicles. In 
this chapter I describe the various types of hybrids, and their pros and cons.

Hybrids are nothing new. Some of the first cars were hybrids because early 
designers recognized that gasoline engines have certain characteristics that 
are nicely offset by electrical power. As early as 1900, hybrid cars were on 
display at the Paris Auto Salon, a huge international show that featured the 
most modern auto technologies. Commercial trucks used hybrid technolo-
gies as early as 1910, with mixed results.

Witnessing the fall of hybrid hoopla
The hybrid concept started to die out (as did the early electric cars; refer to 
Chapter 18) when the self-starting motor was invented for use on internal-
combustion engines. Historically, one had to go to the front of an internal-
combustion auto and crank a handle to start the engine, a dangerous task 
that often caused injuries and one that was nearly impossible for a woman 
to perform. The self-starting motor was itself electric and made it possible to 
start an internal-combustion engine with the simple twist of a key. From that 
point on, internal-combustion engines were widely accepted and ICE-driven 
cars were on their way to the universal acceptance they now enjoy.
As the cost of gasoline started to come down with improved drilling and 
refining techniques, hybrids lost even more favor because they were overly 
complicated, with dual power sources and all the ancillary equipment 
required to support the dual power sources. 
 
In a way, an electric starter motor is not much different from a hybrid drive 
motor because the starter motor required a battery bank that needed to be 
charged in order to drive the electric motor. So it might be said that conven-
tional autos are hybrids, although they don’t derive drive power from the elec-
tric starter motor. 
Watching hybrid research pick up 
Fast forward a few decades from the early 1900s when the excitement over 
hybrids was overshadowed by the self-starting motor to a time when society 
was becoming more environmentally aware. With increased attention to the 
high pollution levels of internal-combustion engines, the major auto compa-
nies began experimenting once again with hybrids in the 1960s. Research and 
development money was scarce, however, and the technology was little more 
than a curiosity exhibited at auto shows. Hybrids were touted as the cars of 
the future, and the future kept getting pushed further and further out. But 
then things started picking up:
 
✓ 1970s: In the mid 1970s, the U.S. Energy Research and Development 
Administration initiated a program to develop hybrid technolo-
gies. Congress enacted the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research, 
Development and Demonstration Act.
 
✓ 1980s: A German manufacturer unveiled a workable hybrid with a 13 
horsepower engine driving the rear wheels while a 123 horsepower elec-
tric motor powered the front wheels.

299
 Chapter 19: Hybrid-Electric Vehicles
 
✓ 1990s: The Clinton administration created a federal initiative called the 
Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). A consortium of 
industry and government agencies set about to develop an extremely 
low pollution auto with a goal of over 80 miles per gallon. Different 
concepts were built and tested, but it became clear that the only way 
to achieve the goal, while still accomplishing a workable performance 
vehicle, was through hybrid technology. A few working prototypes were 
built, but none of them went into production.
 
 It didn’t help that the research and development money was limited 
to American manufacturers, and it’s ironic that now the Japanese car 
companies are ahead of the Americans in terms of hybrid technologies. 
A great opportunity was squandered, which is unfortunately a typical 
conclusion in the energy industry.
The first modern hybrids
By the end of the 20th century, Honda had beaten Toyota in introducing 
the first economically viable hybrid to the American market with its Honda 
Insight (1999). The car offered incredible Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) performance ratings for both pollution levels and miles per gallon. 
Toyota quickly followed up with their Prius, which is the best selling hybrid 
on the road today. Both Toyota and Honda developed commercially viable 
autos while the American car companies held firmly to their ICE-powered 
mainstays.
Gaining popularity
Early acceptance of hybrids was slow to take root. Their performances were 
very good. They could accelerate and outperform similar ICE-powered vehi-
cles, but the prices were (and still are) higher due to the fact that they use 
dual power systems. Toyota and Honda did not have the production capac-
ity in place to ensure lower prices due to manufacturing scales, and neither 
company promoted their hybrids with much vigor. But most of all, when 
hybrids first hit the market, gasoline prices were still very low (compared to 
today’s prices). There simply wasn’t enough demand for hybrids, with their 
increased gas mileages, and they were little more than curiosities driven by 
“tree huggers.”
But when the world started paying more attention to global warming and 
pollution, interest in hybrids began to gel. The media attached themselves 
to hybrids, and even if Toyota and Honda didn’t promote their technologies 
they got a lot of free publicity (who can shun free publicity, especially when 
it’s favorable?).

300
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
The real push for hybrids came when it became clear that all-electric vehicles 
were simply not going to work for most auto applications (due to their lim-
ited ranges). Plus, electric vehicles are still limited by battery technology 
problems. Go to Chapter 18 for the details on the triumphs and travails of 
electric cars.
Two Key Hybrid Features
Two features mark all hybrids: regenerative braking and the use of more than 
one power source, the most common being a combination of a battery and 
internal-combustion engine (ICE). The next sections explore the facts sur-
rounding these two key features of all hybrids. 
The onboard ICE and battery combo
Any vehicle that uses more than one power source is classified as a hybrid, 
but the most common version of the technology is for a vehicle that combines 
electrical drive with a heat engine (ICE, or fossil fuel combustion engine, such 
as those addressed in Chapter 5). The onboard ICEs used in modern hybrids 
are designed for optimum efficiency to reduce fossil fuel consumption and 
emissions to the lowest possible levels. With a hybrid combination of electri-
cal and ICE drive, it’s possible to run the ICE engine at a very restricted RPM 
range, and this further enhances the efficiency of the vehicle because the 
engine can be run at its most fuel efficient, low emission level. 
The ICEs used in hybrids are simpler than the ones used in gasoline-powered 
vehicles because they don’t need to run over large operating ranges. Simple 
means less expensive. The internal-combustion engines used in hybrids are 
unsuitable for use in purely ICE-powered vehicles. A controller determines 
how much ICE power and electrical power are needed at any given time in 
order to increase efficiency to the highest level possible. When the battery 
is sufficient to power the vehicle, hybrids run under battery power. The 
heat engine (ICE) is only run when the batteries need recharging or when 
the vehicle needs more power to crest a hill or pull a heavy load. As a con-
sequence, in hybrids, the ICE engine is constantly started and stopped as 
conditions warrant.
Obviously one of the design goals is to use the smallest, lightest weight bat-
teries possible, but this then means that the ICE comes on more often, for 
longer periods. So there is a critical balance between the size of the electric 
power plants (the battery) versus the fossil fuel power plants (the onboard 
ICE). It is this balance between battery size and capacity, heat engine size 

301
 Chapter 19: Hybrid-Electric Vehicles
(with the attendant fuel tank) and control algorithms that determines the 
success of the hybrid vehicle. At this point, there are many different com-
binations of battery size, ICE engines, and controllers. Over time, there will 
likely be a convergence to a particular design that works best under the 
widest possible conditions.
And as with all electric vehicles, improving battery technologies will allow for 
better performance and less expensive up-front costs.
Regenerative braking
Regenerative braking is a standard feature on all hybrids, and increases their 
efficiencies in relation to conventional vehicles.
When a car is going down a hill, gravity provides the drive power. There is no 
load on the engine, whether it’s an electric motor or the internal-combustion 
engine. In fact, when a car goes down a hill or experiences braking, a lot of 
available energy is dissipated in the brakes and turns into wasted heat.
A regenerative braking system captures that wasted kinetic energy and con-
verts it into an electrical signal that charges the battery bank, thereby making 
the overall vehicle operation much more efficient. The wheels are connected 
to the electrical generator instead of the brakes, and the generator’s “back 
pressure” causes the vehicle to slow down. This not only recaptures energy 
that would otherwise be wasted in the brake drums and pads, but it signifi-
cantly extends the life of the brake pads as well (you can’t eliminate brake 
pads altogether because in hard stops the regenerative system simply can’t 
stop the vehicle fast enough).
Hybrid Technologies: Series and Parallel
There are two basic versions of hybrid electric vehicle (HEVs): parallel 
designs and series designs. In series designs, the vehicle is basically all elec-
tric, with the onboard ICE serving only to charge the battery bank. Parallel 
designs use complex transmissions that can channel either the electric motor 
power, or the ICE power, directly to the wheels. 
With both types of hybrids, the raw fuel options are also much greater than 
for conventional ICE vehicles, and the pollution mitigation potentials are 
greater as a result. Renewable fuels are more commonly used in HEVs than in 
conventional vehicles. Engines can be powered by gasoline or methane, pro-
pane, E85, petro-diesel, or hydrogen (see Chapter 17 for info on flex fuels and 
Chapter 15 for details on hydrogen fuel cells).

302
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Series design hybrid vehicles
In the series design hybrid, all the motive force is derived from the electric 
motors. The primary engine (ICE) serves only to charge the battery bank, 
which drives the electric motors. Electric motors are limited in terms of the 
amount of torque and power that they can deliver, and so the performance 
of series design hybrids is limited. They are, however, much simpler than the 
parallel designs, explained in the next section, and therefore less expensive 
and easier to maintain.
In a series HEV, the motive power is obtained via electric drive motors driven 
from a battery bank, or several battery banks that use different types of 
batteries. This is exactly like an electric vehicle (EV), but instead of relying 
solely on recharging of the batteries through an external source (like the 
grid) a small internal-combustion engine drives an electrical generator that 
recharges the battery bank. This means that the car can be driven much 
greater distances since the primary fuel is gasoline which can be obtained at 
any gas station.
The gasoline engine in a series HEV runs at a constant speed, which is far 
more efficient than the variable speeds that are required from ICE-driven 
vehicles or parallel design hybrids. The pollution levels are less, and the 
mileage efficiency is greater. 
Parallel design hybrids
Parallel designs are far more common because they can deliver more power 
to the wheels, and drivers accustomed to ICE-propelled vehicles demand 
acceleration and handling. In a parallel hybrid, both the electric motors and 
the internal-combustion engine drive the powertrain. The power burden 
automatically shifts between the two power sources as the road conditions 
and load conditions change. 
At low speeds, when relatively little power is required to propel the vehicle, 
the electric motor is used. At high speeds, when a lot of power is needed to 
overcome frictional forces, the internal-combustion engine is used in con-
junction with the electric motor. A processor determines the mix of power 
sources that are most efficient for the load conditions. 
 
The parallel design can be used to power heavy vehicles such as buses and 
trucks, thereby making the hybrid much more versatile than an all-electric 
vehicle.

303
 Chapter 19: Hybrid-Electric Vehicles
Driving and Owning a Hybrid
People like their cars, and they like the way they drive and handle. A big 
question is how the performance of an HEV measures up to conventional 
autos. In this section I describe the important aspects of HEV day to day 
operating characteristics. In some respects HEVs are actually better and 
more fun to drive. There are, however, some drawbacks worth noting.
Performance and handling
People expect that hybrids will perform much differently than conventional 
autos, but this is not the case. In fact, under most driving conditions, hybrids 
can actually outperform conventional autos. Some of the most expensive 
auto makers are now offering hybrid versions of their conventional standbys, 
and there is no performance sacrifice. Lexus, for instance, is now offering 
hybrid versions of their top-of-the-line luxury sedans, and they would not be 
doing this if they weren’t confident that buyers would react positively. The 
Cadillac Escalade is fast and powerful, and General Motors is advertising the 
fact that the Escalade gets better gas mileage than a Subaru (the heretofore 
energy-efficient brand name).
Electric cars are limited in range, so it’s no surprise that, because of their 
reliance on internal-combustion engines to recharge the battery “on the go,” 
hybrids can travel much farther than electric cars. What many people may 
find surprising is that they can travel significantly farther than ICE-powered 
vehicles, too. The typical conventional auto needs to be refueled every 300 to 
400 miles, but hybrids routinely offer ranges greater than 500 miles. 
Other things to know about the performance and handling of hybrids include 
the following:
 
✓ The hybrid’s ICE is sized to transport an average, not a peak, load. While 
this affords a large measure of efficiency to the overall operation, it also 
means that hybrids aren’t made for speed and power. To get the most 
fuel efficiency and range out of a hybrid, however, requires modifying 
your driving habits to maximize the amount of time the hybrid’s electric 
engine is providing the power. For many, that means changing what they 
expect out of their car: sheer speed and power or increased mileage and 
decreased emissions. 
 
✓ Most of the gains in pollution reduction and mileage increase come 
when the hybrid is operating in all-electric mode, and so hybrids are 
more advantageous in city driving (short trips) than rural driving. This 
is the opposite of conventional autos which offer better performance in 
highway driving than city.

304
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
 
✓ People want to feel the power buildup as they accelerate. To the drivers 
who are accustomed to the “normal” engine sounds — the roar of the 
engine when the car runs fast, the sound the engine makes as the trans-
mission moves through the necessary gears, and the low rumble of an 
idling — this seemingly random starting and stopping of the ICE can be a 
little off-putting. It doesn’t offer the same sound feedback that most driv-
ers have come to expect (and a few actually love). 
Maintenance 
Hybrids use ICEs, just like conventional autos, and these need to be kept 
tuned and running at peak performance. And hybrids require the usual 
routine of oil changes, wheel alignments, and so on. But they also require 
periodic electrical testing to make sure the control systems are running the 
way they should. Above all else, the large battery packs hybrids use need to 
be maintained and tested on a periodic basis. Not only are they filled with 
dangerous chemicals, but they wear out, especially if they’re abused. They’re 
also very expensive to replace. And in extremely cold weather, battery banks 
lose power and may not operate properly.
Hybrids are more complicated than conventional autos, there’s no denying it. 
Unlike a problem in a conventional auto, which can be reliably determined by 
any competent mechanic at an auto repair shop, the cause of a problem in a 
hybrid isn’t very intuitive, and there are relatively few technicians trained in 
hybrid technologies. Electrical systems are difficult not only to comprehend, 
but to repair and troubleshoot. For these reasons, the cost to repair a hybrid 
may be very high. And if you’re out in the middle of the boondocks, you may 
not even be able to find somebody who can repair your broken down car.
There is very little infrastructure dedicated to the parts and servicing of 
hybrids, at this writing. This will change over time as hybrids become more 
common. Even if the repair infrastructure improves dramatically, hybrids 
will still be expensive to maintain. Parts may be difficult to get, unlike with 
conventional autos where parts stores are on every corner, and the workers 
behind the counter know precisely what you need and how to install it.
 
Another maintenance consideration is how to dispose of spent batteries. 
Disposal of batteries is expensive. You can’t just throw them away; they need 
to be specially processed by qualified recycling centers and these may be far 
and few between. While the shops that swap battery packs will dispose of the 
batteries, it’s expensive and ultimately the consumer is going to pay the price.

305
 Chapter 19: Hybrid-Electric Vehicles
Environmental impacts
A key fuel-saving advantage of a hybrid is the automatic shutoff and start 
procedure for the gasoline engine. When the vehicle is stopped, the gasoline 
engine is off, which saves a lot of gasoline. It is estimated that if every ICE 
engine in the country were simply turned off when the car was not moving, 
aggregate fuel consumption would go down 8 percent. Of course, turning off 
your engine every time you stop isn’t practical with a conventional vehicle, 
but with the hybrid, this very thing happens automatically. In driving short 
distances or creeping along in stop and go traffic (a common scenario of city 
driving), the ICE engine never even comes on at all.
This, in addition to the regenerative braking capability and smaller, fuel 
efficient internal-combustion engine, allows hybrids to achieve significantly 
better gas mileage figures (fuel economy is often 35 percent or more better 
for a hybrid than a conventional auto of the same size), along with signifi-
cantly reduced pollution levels.
 
The first hybrids cut vehicle emissions of global warming gases by a third to a 
half, in comparison to ICE-driven vehicles of the same size and class. More 
recent models have cut emissions by over two thirds, and technological 
advancements promise even better performances. Bottom line: The overall 
pollution generated by HEVs of both types is much less than for a conventionally-
powered vehicle using an internal-combustion engine, even when the electri-
cal pollution from the grid (if it is used to charge the battery bank) and from 
the on-board batteries is taken into account. Hybrids emit only 50 percent of 
the carbon dioxide of conventional autos, and only 10 percent of the carbon 
monoxide.
The economics of hybrids 
HEVs cost more than conventional vehicles. The up-front investment is 
higher than for an equivalent internal-combustion-driven vehicle, and it takes 
some time to recoup this via better fuel economy. Despite the higher cost 
of hybrid vehicles themselves and the higher maintenance costs, the cost of 
driving a hybrid vehicle is much less than for a conventional vehicle because 
hybrids are smaller and more efficient. In addition, tax breaks, subsidies, and 
incentives are available from many different government agencies, thereby 
making the economics even more attractive.
If carbon taxes are instituted, the price differentials between hybrids and 
conventional autos will disappear, and hybrids may someday outnumber 
conventional vehicles on the road.

Buggaboos and boogeymen: 
Unwarranted fears
There are a number of negative myths that seem to follow hybrids, but most 
of them are unfounded. The track record is still being tallied, but hybrids 
have proven themselves safe and economical over the last decade. Here are a 
couple of the most prevalent myths.
They’re dangerous
There is a recurring myth about hybrids that simply won’t go away. The 
story holds that police and emergency personnel are put at undue risk from 
hybrids because their electrical systems operate at higher voltages. But the 
threat hasn’t panned out.
Hybrid battery packs are well sealed and can take a collision without ruptur-
ing. The high voltage systems are well contained and marked so that emer-
gency personnel know what they’re confronting. With training, emergency 
personnel know exactly how to deal with a hybrid accident. They know to 
remove the ignition key, which disables the electrical system.
As with all cars sold in the United States, hybrids must meet the stringent 
requirements of the federal motor vehicle safety requirements. The same 
seatbelts, airbags, and electronics are used on hybrids as with conventional 
vehicles. In addition, hybrids have more intelligence than conventional autos 
and there are additional safety features built in that take advantage of the 
increased intelligence.
They’re too new to take a chance on 
One of the biggest hurdles right now for the hybrid industry is the notion 
that the technology is going to mature quite a bit in the next few years. We 
have all seen this effect with computers and large screen TVs, and we feel 
as though the same effect will apply to hybrids. There is a maxim that says, 
“never buy the first generation of any product.” This is true of cars as well as 
electronics.
A marketing poll found that people are leery of hybrid cars because of their 
relative complexity. But the fact is, hybrids have been around for a long time, 
and the technologies are well proven. 

Chapter 20
Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring the promise and challenges of hydrogen as a fuel source
▶ Checking out vehicles that use pure hydrogen and those that use fuel cells
W
hen a majority of experts look into the crystal balls, they see two 
viable options for solving the world’s fossil fuel problems: 
 
✓ Use the same fuels that are used now — gasoline and diesel from petro-
leum products — but supplanted by ethanol, biodiesel, and other renew-
able energy sources, particularly those derived from biomass. Hybrids 
of all stripes fit into this category (refer to Chapters 18 and 19), as does 
diesel in all its various forms (see Chapter 17). 
 
✓ Use hydrogen. Hydrogen fuel cells (covered in Chapter 15) convert 
chemical energy directly into electrical energy and leave no trail behind 
other than a small amount of water and some carbon dioxide — much 
less carbon dioxide, in fact, than conventional internal-combustion 
engines (ICE) and clean diesel. There are no particulates, nitrous oxides, 
carbon monoxide, or any other environmentally damaging emissions. 
Most experts believe the future lies in this scenario. 
The big automakers have been toying with fuel cells for use in transport since 
the 1960s, when fuel cells were used successfully in the space programs. 
But only in the last 15 years have major inroads been achieved. These were 
brought about by the zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) mandates passed by 
California. Today, the race is on to develop an economical hydrogen-powered 
vehicle design that can be sold commercially.
Although I describe hydrogen fuel cells in Chapter 15, I get down to the 
nitty-gritty details in this chapter of how fuel cells can be used specifically in 
vehicles.

308
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Fuel Cell Fundamentals and Challenges 
 
Hydrogen fuel cells operate similarly to a common battery. There are two 
electrodes, a positive and a negative. Oxygen passes over one of the elec-
trodes and hydrogen passes over the other. A complex chemical reaction 
occurs and produces electricity, along with heat and water. The heat may be 
used to provide other vehicle functions like internal space heating and main-
taining temperatures in the control system (electronics like to operate at spe-
cific temperatures in order to achieve optimum efficiencies). The water may 
simply be discarded, without environmental damage. Unlike batteries that 
need to be recharged, however, hydrogen fuel cells will run as long as oxygen 
and hydrogen flow over the electrodes.
Two benefits stand out when you’re talking about fuel cells: 
 
✓ Hydrogen, when combusted with pure oxygen, is entirely pollution free; 
the only byproducts are water and heat.
 
✓ Hydrogen and oxygen are everywhere.
Sounds like a dream come true. And it is — if a few wrinkles can be worked 
out. The following sections outline those wrinkles as well as the basics and 
benefits behind fuel cells.
Dealing with hydrogen
The “fuel” needed for fuel cells is hydrogen and oxygen, and fuel cells simply 
convert the molecules in these elements directly into clean, powerful elec-
trons (electricity). In the next sections, I describe the challenge in obtaining 
the “fuel” needed for fuel cells as well as a promising method for extracting 
and storing hydrogen, the more fickle of the two necessary elements.
Hunting and gathering
Gathering oxygen, obviously, is a no-brainer. It’s everywhere and in abundant 
supply. Hydrogen, on the other hand, while abundant, is a little more prob-
lematic. It can be a very dangerous substance because it reacts so strongly 
with other elements. That’s why hydrogen in its pure form is very rare in 
nature.
The whole trick to making hydrogen fuel cell vehicles economically viable is 
in developing effective means of finding, producing, and storing hydrogen on 
a scale which can be used in vehicles. In Chapter 15, I describe some of the 
ways that hydrogen can be produced, like steam reforming, plasma waste, 

309
 Chapter 20: Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles
electrolysis, and so on. The common goal of all these methods, very basically, 
is to use heat, pressure, or some type of chemical reaction to separate, or 
extract, the hydrogen from the other elements that it naturally combines with. 
Some methods show more promise than others, but suffice to say that none 
of the methods has yet proven practical because the cost of the processes is 
so prohibitive. But with the increasing attention brought to bear on hydrogen 
fuel cells, research money is being invested that will not only bring the costs 
down, but will isolate and identify the most viable long-term methods of 
hydrogen extraction.
Reforming
Perhaps the most viable alternative to date is to simply use our existing fossil 
fuel supplies for the production of hydrogen via the process of reforming. 
This technology is well understood, albeit complex and expensive. Reformers 
basically crack the raw fossil fuels down into constituent elements. Cracking 
is a process where complex organic molecules (fossil fuels as well as carbo-
hydrates) are transformed into simpler molecules.
The corner gas station could be converted into an on-site hydrogen produc-
tion facility, using the raw fuels that they now dispense. Better still would be 
to have a reformer directly on the vehicle so that hydrogen would always be 
available (with an occasional fill-up at the gas station of a suitable raw fuel 
used by the reformer). 
If reformers can’t be developed (and therefore hydrogen can’t be created on 
site), huge investments in infrastructure will be required to get the hydrogen 
to filling stations. 
The high cost
Like any nascent technology, hydrogen technologies are expensive, making 
the production, operation, and maintenance of hydrogen-powered vehicles 
expensive as well. Adding to the cost is the fact that hydrogen itself is 
an expensive fuel. 
The economics of hydrogen-fueled vehicles are prohibitive not only because the 
raw fuel costs are high, but also because hydrogen engines are expensive. 
The upfront costs of a hydrogen-fueled vehicle are very high. Even though 
tax breaks, subsidies, and other incentives are available for those hearty 
souls who wish to be on the leading edge of technological innovation, one 
must be very keen on achieving the zero-pollution performance in order to 
shell out this kind of money.

310
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Despite the technical hurdles, hydrogen cars are going to hit the market 
soon. The cost will be high, and the operating costs will be even higher. But 
enough people are attracted to the notion of emitting nothing more than 
water from their cars that markets will develop. And as the markets develop, 
prices will inevitably come down. At some point, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles 
will be price competitive with conventional ICE-driven vehicles and then the 
entire world will be driven by hydrogen. . . . Maybe.
Benefits of hydrogen and fuel cells
Despite the issues of cost and hydrogen extraction, fuel cells offer a number 
of benefits: 
 
✓ Hydrogen engines are extremely efficient compared to fossil fuel alterna-
tives. Although hydrogen fueling stations are far and few between today, 
once hydrogen is widely available, this option promises excellent perfor-
mance and pollution advantages.
 
✓ The existing pipeline infrastructure for natural gas could be converted 
to use for hydrogen transport to service stations. This would help con-
siderably with the economics.
 
✓ Hydrogen can be produced on site. It’s possible to produce hydrogen 
at home, using electrolysis or other methods. In fact, hydrogen can be 
produced nearly anywhere, even on the vehicle itself. Some scientists 
believe that hydrogen-fueled vehicles will become the main source of 
transport when on-board hydrogen producing technologies mature 
enough to become economically viable.
Hydrogen-Powered Vehicles 
Despite its promise, the current hydrogen technology used in vehicles is still 
very immature. Today, two options are being explored:
 
✓ Using hydrogen to power internal-combustion vehicles. Called hydro-
gen fuel vehicles (HFVs), these cars don’t use fuel cells; they run on pure 
hydrogen.
 
✓ Using hydrogen fuel cells in electric vehicles. These cars, called fuel 
cell vehicles (FCVs), use fuel cells in addition to or in place of batteries 
in electric vehicles. 
The following sections go into more detail on these vehicles, addressing not 
only how these vehicles work, but also how designers have addressed the 
challenges posed by relying on the volatile element of hydrogen.

311
 Chapter 20: Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles
Hydrogen fuel vehicles
Conventional fossil fuel vehicles can be modified to run on hydrogen in the 
same way that they can be adapted to run on methane or propane. Hydrogen 
fuel vehicles (HFVs) do not use fuel cells; they run on pure hydrogen in a 
combustion process. BMW is one of several automakers currently develop-
ing production cars that use hydrogen in an ICE. The engines can use either 
hydrogen or fossil fuels because a strictly hydrogen-powered car would be 
completely impractical due to the unavailability of hydrogen.
The BMW hydrogen/fossil fuel prototype drives exactly like its purely fossil 
fuel cousin; there is no degradation of performance. The car accelerates from 
zero to 60 mph in 9.5 seconds, which is not rip roaring, but it’s typical for 
a big sedan. Running on hydrogen only, the 12-cylinder engine delivers 260 
horsepower. It has a range of over 200 miles on one tank of hydrogen.
Because hydrogen is not very energy dense, a tank of a given size will only 
provide around 70 percent of the range of a gasoline tank. A way to address 
this issue is to compress the hydrogen in a metal tank in the same way that 
other gases are compressed and stored. As you can imagine, these tanks are 
heavier and require a lot more safety features because compressed gases are 
dangerous. In a collision, the tank may potentially turn into a deadly missile. 
One of the key challenges facing HFV designers is how to store pure hydro-
gen on board. Following are some possibilities:
 
✓ The “Cryo” fuel tank, developed by BMW. Hydrogen is stored in a spe-
cial well insulated cryogenic (extremely cold) tank maintained at minus 
400 degrees Fahrenheit. The tank is stored behind a fortified bulkhead 
located directly behind the rear seats (it’s big and the trunk is small, 
which is a practical limitation). There are potential dangers associated 
with this scheme: In an accident, for example, the tank may rupture and 
the tremendously cold hydrogen could literally freeze an occupant. Or 
the tank could also explode when the hydrogen is mixed with oxygen 
(but great pains have been taken to ensure this doesn’t happen). Still, 
it’s a daunting thought and the likelihood of this kind of system gaining 
commercial acceptance is remote.
 
✓ Metal hydrides (compounds consisting of a combination of metal and 
hydrogen) can store hydrogen, which can be liberated at a controlled 
rate for use as a fuel. 
 
✓ Gas-on-solid absorption technologies store hydrogen in extremely small 
carbon manifolds called nanotubes. Hydrogen gas condenses within 
these nanotubes at densities comparable to those of metal storage 
tanks, but with none of the high-pressure dangers of storage tanks. 
 
 More research and development needs to be done on both the metal 
hydrides and the gas-on-solid absorption technologies before wide-
spread acceptance will be seen.

Hydrogen tanks are potentially dangerous and require a lot of servicing, main-
tenance, and inspection. There are very few qualified technicians who can do 
this right now.
Fuel cell vehicles
A fuel cell vehicle (FCV) is basically an electric vehicle that incorporates a 
fuel cell in place of, or in addition to, a battery bank. 
The electric motor powers the drivetrain in the same way that a conventional 
all-electric vehicle works (refer to Chapter 18). The electric motor gets its 
power from either the fuel cell, the battery bank, or both at the same time 
depending on load conditions. The fuel cell can recharge the battery bank 
when the vehicle is stationary (even when the vehicle is turned off and is 
parked). If battery banks are used with the fuel cell, when the hydrogen tank 
runs dry, there will still be enough power available to run the vehicle (just 
like a standard hybrid vehicle).
These vehicles can also be plug-in type, so that the batteries can be 
recharged via grid power. Recharging via the grid might be necessary, for 
example, when hydrogen is in short supply or unavailable.
The overall pollution levels achieved with FCVs is only a fraction of that 
achieved with internal-combustion engines. Typical efficiencies are better 
than fossil-fuel-powered engines as well. However, efficiencies are not as 
good as with hydrogen-fueled vehicles (refer to the preceding section).
In addition, the maximum operating range of a hydrogen FCV is less than that 
of an equivalent internal-combustion engine vehicle. However, if methane or 
propane is used to derive the hydrogen, comparable range performances are 
achievable. As with all-electric vehicles, servicing may be difficult because 
the infrastructure is limited.
A Hydrogen Future
Of all the alternative strategies considered today (and explained in this 
book), hydrogen fuel cells offer the most promise. While other options can 
offer some benefits (reduce greenhouse gases and pollution, offer energy sav-
ings and efficiency gains, or create the power output required by the modern 
world, for example), hydrogen, once fully developed, can offer all these 
advantages. 

313
 Chapter 20: Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles
The problem with hydrogen fuel cells is that the economics are not curr-
ently competitive. Operating fuel cell vehicles costs more than operating 
conventionally-powered vehicles and requires tenacity and determination 
because the resources are so much more difficult to obtain. Today, if you 
buy and operate a fuel cell-powered vehicle, you have to pay more for the 
vehicle up front, and you have to plan ahead for fill-ups because you simply 
can’t obtain the required fuel as easily as you can obtain a gallon of gasoline. 
It takes a hearty commitment to drive a fuel cell-powered vehicle. 
Until recently, global warming was considered a problem of the future. 
Unfortunately, humankind has shown throughout history that solving future 
problems is rarely a priority (never do today what can be put off until tomor-
row), and as a result, developments in energy technologies have languished. 
Yet as the effects of global climate change have become more apparent, 
many more people recognize the real threat it poses.
For this reason, people are willing to spend more to go green and to make 
extraordinary commitments to do so. All sorts of alternative energy schemes, 
like solar and wind power, that aren’t cost competitive with fossil fuel 
sources are proliferating. As more people demand the technology (and 
are willing to pay the higher price for it), the technology will become more 
common and prices will come down. As prices get lower, more people will 
get on board, and eventually, broad acceptance of hydrogen technology will 
materialize.

A
s far as sustainable, nonpolluting, readily available, and cheap go, you 
can’t beat the propulsion system used by Fred Flintstone and other driv-
ers in Bedrock. Alas, most people aren’t willing to hoof it from place to place 
while hauling the car along, too. Fortunately, there are other alternatives. 
In this chapter I describe some of the more exotic transportation scenarios 
being developed to address the pressing need for more efficient and less-
polluting means of moving people and things around. Some of these schemes 
are still on the drawing board, but some are already being used extensively 
(nuclear-powered ships, for instance).
Supercapacitors
Energy can be stored in capacitors, which are very simple electrical devices 
used in literally every single electronic device on the planet. Here’s how a 
capacitor works: 
 
1. A battery connected to the capacitor deposits a charge onto the two 
opposing plates. 
 
2. When the battery’s disconnected, the charge remains on the plates. 
 
3. When a load (a motor, light, or electronic device) is connected to the 
capacitor, the charge flows through the load, providing power. 
In short, a capacitor is a device for storing energy; it doesn’t create or pro-
duce power; it simply stores it (like a battery).
Supercapacitors are simply immense versions of the same, simple concept. 
There is no theoretical limit to the amount of energy they can store. Energy 
densities (the amount of energy stored per unit volume and weight) can be 

316
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
increased by manufacturing the capacitor in such a way as to prevent leakage 
(over time, every capacitor self-discharges due to imperfections). 
 
The amount of charge that a capacitor can store is directly related to the sur-
face areas of the opposing charge storage surfaces. Electromechanical double-
layer capacitors (EDLCs) have been developed using carbon electrodes with 
extremely high surface areas of up to 2,000 square meters per gram of weight. 
These are used in conjunction with an electrolyte (the material located 
between the two electrodes) of aqueous acid such as sulfuric acid. Organic-
based electrolytes, which are safer for the environment, have also been used 
successfully.
In practical terms, supercapacitors can replace batteries. But in all likeli-
hood, supercapacitors won’t necessarily replace batteries. Instead, they’ll 
be used in conjunction with batteries. Because capacitors can deliver a great 
deal of power in a short period of time, they are ideal as power boosters, for 
when an electric car needs to accelerate rapidly, or needs to crest a steep 
hill. Supercapacitors are also ideal in hybrid vehicles, displacing a good deal 
of the current battery capacities with safer, lighter energy storage means.
A key benefit of supercapacitors is that charging them takes much less time 
(on the order of 1 percent of the time) than charging a battery. In fact, you 
can charge a supercapacitor in about the same amount of time you can fill a 
gas tank, making these vehicles far more practical, in real world applications.
One concern of capacitors is safety. Capacitors are capable of discharging 
tremendous amounts of power in a very short period of time. In an accident, 
a capacitor powered vehicle could severely shock the occupants, or emer-
gency and support personnel. These problems can be overcome, however, 
by suitable electronic control circuits.
The widespread application of supercapacitors for use in powering vehicles 
is years away, but the technologies are improving quickly, and venture capi-
talists are entering the game, which means that they believe in the market 
potential. 
Solar-Powered Vehicles
Solar PV cells generate electricity. When PV modules are located on the roof 
of the vehicle, or for that matter, literally anywhere on the vehicle’s body, in 
theory, the electricity generated can power the vehicle. The more sunshine, 
the better. Solar cells have already been used to power vehicles — even 
aircraft. However, these vehicles are very lightweight and don’t offer much 
by way of high-end speeds. As the sole power source for vehicle propulsion, 
solar has a lot of disadvantages:

317
 Chapter 21: Exotic Propulsion Systems
 
✓ Solar cells simply can’t provide enough energy per time to offer per-
formances that people take for granted. Current electric cars consume 
around 260 watt-hours per mile, while solar cars are only capable of 
delivering around 25 watt-hours per mile. That’s energy frugality at 
its best, and it precludes all creature comforts like nice seats, heating, 
radios, and so on. If you have infinite patience, though, then solar pro-
pulsion may be just the thing.
 
✓ These vehicles only operate when the sun is shining. The more sun, 
the faster the vehicle will go — which isn’t exactly how people want to 
drive their cars, although it often seems like the only explanation for 
how some people drive.
As solar cells become more efficient (that is, can produce more electrical 
power per unit of area), however, solar cars will become more practical. 
When the first solar cells came onto the market back in the 1960s, their 
efficiencies were only on the order of 6 percent (6 percent of the total radia-
tion energy falling onto the collectors was converted into useable electrical 
energy). Solar cells are now available at over 30 percent efficiencies, and this 
number will climb to over 50 percent in the next decade, particularly with the 
strong interest in solar power that the world is experiencing.
Until then, solar cells can also be used in other ways to improve the energy 
efficiency or environmental friendliness of vehicles:
 
✓ To charge batteries in an electric car or a hybrid: Many cars sit in 
the sunshine all day long while the owner is working, and by building 
enough solar collectors into the car’s body, particularly the roof, there 
may be enough solar power collected during the course of a sunny day 
to allow short-distance commuting completely derived from the sun. Or 
the solar panels may be used to charge supercapacitors (see the sec-
tion, “Supercapacitors,” earlier) instead of batteries, making the entire 
process very environmentally friendly.
 
✓ To augment the support systems like air-conditioning (which is 
needed only when the sun is shining brightly) in all-electric vehicles: 
Air-conditioning loads are heavy; they sometimes take up more than 40 
percent of the total power a vehicle is consuming, particularly a small, 
electrically powered vehicle.
 
✓ To make internal-combustion engines more efficient. Over 50 years 
ago, MIT scientists demonstrated what’s called thermophotovoltaics 
(TPV). When illuminated by an infrared light (which can be obtained 
from a very hot source), solar photovoltaic cells can produce up to 60 
times more power output than when simply illuminated by sunlight 
alone. Combusting fossil fuel provides a very hot flow of infrared radia-
tion. Because there are a number of heat sources in a conventional auto, 
placing photovoltaic cells in strategic locations could recoup some of 
the wasted heat, making the auto much more efficient.

318
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Solar power for vehicles will entail a slow, evolutionary process over the next 
few decades as solar becomes more efficient, and the cost comes down. Look 
for solar panels on cars in the next few years, but only in minor roles. Twenty 
years from now, solar may play a major role.
Flywheels
Most people know what a flywheel is: a heavy weight spinning very fast, like 
a gyroscope. Conventional autos incorporate flywheels in their engines to 
even out load conditions and provide stability to the engine (which is under-
going periodic jolts of momentum from the individual pulses from each cyl-
inder firing). Flywheels are also used to create the smooth, even motion of a 
ceramic potter’s wheel.
What most people don’t know is that flywheels are really just energy storage 
devices. And it’s possible to design flywheels to store a tremendous amount 
of energy, enough to power a vehicle. 
In an electric vehicle, a flywheel would be used to augment the low power 
outputs of the typical battery bank/electric motor combination. Here’s how it 
works: The flywheel spins during normal driving conditions. Then when a big 
burst of power is needed, the energy in the flywheel is called upon to provide 
that burst of power. This operation is similar to that of the supercapacitor 
(for more on supercapacitors, see the section, “Supercapacitors,” earlier), 
but it’s mechanical instead of electrical. (Flywheels are often referred to as 
mechanical batteries.)
Because of the huge amounts of power that are available with a flywheel, 
accidents are a problem. The newest flywheel technologies solve this prob-
lem by using composites that shatter into infinitesimal pieces upon impact. 
The pieces are so small as to be considered a liquid, and the energy of the 
flywheel is disbursed without harm to the vehicle occupants.
Last one’s a rotten egg!
Every year a competition is held that pits solar-
powered vehicles against each other. The USA 
Sunrayce goes from Washington to Florida, and 
the Darwin-Adelaide runs across the entire 
continent of Australia. The cars are impractical 
because they’re designed for minimum rolling 
and wind resistance at very low speeds. It takes 
a very patient driver to cross the United States 
or Australia in one of these prototypes.

319
 Chapter 21: Exotic Propulsion Systems
Regenerative braking systems (those that recapture a vehicle’s kinetic energy 
when the vehicle slows down) work very well with flywheels. When a car 
stops, or goes down a hill, the recouped kinetic energy is simply translated 
directly into the flywheel. This is far more efficient than the electrical regen-
erative braking systems used on current hybrids because those systems are 
comprised of mechanical-to-mechanical energy.
Flywheel technologies are already being used in some prototypes, and the 
promise is good enough that research-and-development money is being dedi-
cated on an increasing scale. In the next decade, flywheels will be incorpo-
rated into hybrid vehicles on a routine basis.
Hydraulic Accumulators
The hydraulic accumulator is a means of storing mechanical energy, much 
like a tank of compressed gas. A hydraulic accumulator can store far more 
energy than a simple tank of compressed gas, however, and it’s much safer. 
It also takes up much less volume, and so the technology is being developed 
to power vehicles. It operates in a similar fashion to the flywheel (see the 
section, “Flywheels,” earlier). It stores energy during braking and going down 
hills, and can then feed this energy back into the drive system of the vehicle, 
as required.
The accumulator stores energy by pumping oil at high pressure into a pres-
sure containment vessel. The oil now holds a lot of potential energy that can 
be drawn back out at will, at a high rate of speed. 
The accumulator is not capable of powering a vehicle for any distance, 
but it’s perfect for augmenting small-sized electrical power systems. 
Accumulators will never be the sole power source for a vehicle because they 
only store energy; they don’t create it. But they may replace batteries in 
hybrids once the technology has matured.
Magnetic Levitation Trains
Mass transit, which includes buses, trains, vans, and so on, is much more 
efficient at moving people and loads than are individual autos. One of the 
best ways to solve the energy problem is by building convenient, accessible, 
on-time mass transit systems, in particular trains. The most efficient of all 
mass transit vehicles is the magnetic levitation train. In some countries, there 
are already a good number of magnetic levitation trains, and plans are on the 

320
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
board to build many more. Europe and Japan already have a number of mag-
netic levitation trains, and there are a few operating in the Eastern corridor 
of the United States. California is finalizing plans to build a high-speed mag-
netic levitation train between the Bay Area and Los Angeles.
Using magnets
Magnetic levitation uses magnets to suspend objects in midair. You’ve prob-
ably seen children’s toys that suspend a metal ball over a platform loaded 
with magnets, appropriately placed. The same phenomenon is used to suspend 
a large object like a train. The result is that friction is virtually eliminated.
Of course, magnets have north and south poles. When you put a south pole 
next to a north pole of another magnet, they attract and snap together. 
When you try to push a north pole at the north pole of another magnet, the 
two magnets repel each other. When the magnets are very strong (electrical 
magnets can be made as powerful as desired), the attraction/repulsion can 
be very forceful and a very large weight — say an entire train complete with 
passengers, baggage, and so on — can be suspended in midair, with little 
expenditure of energy. 
The lower system (the “track”) is fixed into place, and the upper system (the 
train) levitates over the lower system. Feedback systems keep the magnetic 
elements properly aligned with respect to each other. (When magnets repel 
each other, they wobble off center.)
 
Superconductors — metallic materials at very low temperatures that can liter-
ally channel the flow of current without resistance — make magnetic levitation 
practical and economical because magnetic fluxes (magnetic force fields) are 
entirely absent from the superconducting metal (a phenomenon referred to as 
the Meisner effect, after the discoverer). Because of the Meisner effect, the 
magnetic forces produced by a superconducting magnet can be extremely 
large, with very little expenditure of power. An electrical current imposed onto 
a superconducting magnet can flow around and around for a long period of 
time without dying out. A superconducting magnetic medium creates a much 
stronger repulsive force for a set magnetic level than ordinary magnets do.
Bullet trains
Trains that use superconducting magnets to levitate the train cars are called 
maglev. There is no contact between the cars and the track. The gap between 
the train cars and the track is around one inch, which isn’t much but that’s 
all it takes. The only mechanical friction that occurs is due to air resistance, 
and that can be minimized by suitable aerodynamic designs. Maglev trains are 

321
 Chapter 21: Exotic Propulsion Systems
often called “bullet trains” because of their bullet like shape and the fact that 
they can go extremely fast (over 200 miles per hour) with great efficiency. 
There are two different types of levitation schemes in use, the monorail and 
the wraparound track. In the monorail design, the cars are attached to bear-
ings that essentially wrap around the track. In the wraparound design, the 
track wraps around the bearings attached to the railroad cars. The most 
common arrangement is the monorail design.
 
In both systems, vertical magnetic fields levitate the cars, while horizontal 
fields keep the cars aligned properly on the track to avoid friction. Acceleration 
and braking are accomplished via a set of linear motors that use magnetic fields 
to interact with the stationary, track magnetic fields. There is no mechanical 
contact between any part of the train cars or the track.
Pros of maglevs
Maglevs have a number of advantages as an efficient, comfortable transporta-
tion alternative:
 
✓ They’re very quiet, even at high speeds. Because the train and track 
never meet, there are no grinding or cranking sounds at all and the ride 
is quiet and smooth. At top speeds, the countryside literally flies by and 
commute times are reduced considerably. 
 
✓ Maglevs are entirely electrical, which means that when they are run 
using nonfossil fuel alternative-energy sources to produce the electrical 
power they are very clean for the environment. And because they don’t 
need fuel tanks, they’re lighter and safer than conventional transporta-
tion schemes.
 
✓ Maglevs can compete with airlines not only because of their speed, but 
also because of the logistics of boarding and unboarding: You can park 
a few yards away from the maglev boarding station and hop aboard with 
relatively little hassle. Even in long-distance travel, the total time taken 
to ride a maglev can be less than that for an aircraft which travels much 
faster. For those who have flying phobia, maglevs are the solution.
Cons of maglevs
Maglevs are very expensive to build compared to other trains. They are eco-
nomical only when filled to capacity and used all the time. Maintenance is 
expensive, although infrequent. Other areas of concern include the following:
 
✓ Passengers are subjected to strong magnetic fields. There’s been some 
concern about whether this exposure poses health risks. Research is 
being done to determine the answer, but so far no hazardous effects 
have been recorded.

322
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
 
✓ Power outages in the grid mean the train will come to a halt. This could 
be dangerous when the train is moving very fast, because the levitation 
will suddenly disappear. Safety systems are installed to alleviate this 
problem, but there is still a higher safety risk than that for conventional 
trains because accidents are potentially more catastrophic.
 
✓ High winds can push the train around, causing momentary contacts 
between the levitation elements, which may be dangerous.
Nuclear-Powered Ships
The main application for nuclear-powered ships has been in the military arena, 
principally submarines and aircraft carriers. However, with improving nuclear 
technologies and an increased concern for fossil fuel usage, nuclear power is 
now being considered for a wide range of commercial vessels as well.
Nuclear fission is the type of power plant used in nuclear-powered ships (you 
can find a detailed explanation of nuclear fission in Chapter 8). In a ship, the 
fission reaction is carefully controlled within the nuclear reactor containment 
vessel (highly shielded to prevent radiation leakage). Heat from the reaction 
is channeled into the boiler, which powers a turbine/generator combination 
that produces electricity. The electricity then powers a huge electric motor 
that drives the propeller. Another turbine/generator provides additional 
power for the ship’s support systems. Nuclear powered ships are all-electric.
Efficiency and environmental impact
Nuclear power is far more efficient in terms of providing miles per unit of raw 
fuel than conventional, combustion-driven power sources. Plus, these ships 
emit no greenhouse gases. What nuclear-powered ships do emit is radiation, 
which can be considerable if the containment vessels are inadequate. This 
affects not only the crew, but sea life beneath the ship. Radiation trails in the 
water can last for a long time.
Nuclear, of course, has its detractors in the green movement. The political 
implications of building a commercial, nuclear-powered ship are onerous. 
However, with the increased concern over global warming, nuclear-powered 
commercial vessels will surely be built in the next few decades. 

323
 Chapter 21: Exotic Propulsion Systems
Performance and maintenance
Nuclear-powered ships can go a lot faster than conventional ships, with 
much less weight in terms of fuel. In addition, nuclear reactors don’t need an 
oxygen source, unlike combustion engines. This makes them perfect for sub-
marine applications. (Conventional submarines need to surface periodically 
to draw in oxygen while nuclear-powered submarines may remain submerged 
for months at a time.)
Maintenance, although itself a big job that requires a lot of high-tech equip-
ment and often needs to be done in port, is needed less often. 
Safety issues
Nuclear power is a proven, reliable, and safe technology. A lot of problems 
can occur on conventionally powered ships, like fuel spills, fire hazards, and 
the like. While problems can occur on nuclear-powered ships (read on for 
more), on balance, they’re safer than conventionally powered ships, a fact 
that the record bears out. Why? Because of the highly advanced safety tech-
nologies and procedures that nuclear protocol requires.
While the risk is small, thermal meltdown can occur. There have been several 
instances of submarines (Russian) experiencing catastrophic nuclear reac-
tor accidents. But like the Chernobyl nuclear accident, the Russian problems 
have been more a function of institutionalized laxity than fundamental techni-
cal inferiority of nuclear power.
As with all nuclear materials, terrorists would love to get their hands on 
some samples that they can use to blackmail or terrorize a community.
For the truly adventurous: Bicycle transport
There is no more efficient and economical 
transport system than a good, lightweight bicy-
cle, as has been proven by numerous studies 
conducted over the last 300 years. Bicycles 
have two wheels and no onboard power source 
other than the rider, who is fueled by a good 
breakfast of healthy nuts, grains, and fruit. And 
because food is available virtually everywhere 
on the planet’s surface, there’s no problem 
refilling the energy source.

324
Part IV: Alternatives — Transportation 
Advantages of bicycle transport:
 ✓ Lowers blood pressure and cholesterol 
levels, increases overall health and well 
being of the rider, and increases sex drive 
and longevity.
 ✓ With tandem bikes, increases quality of 
interpersonal relations, unless the rider in 
front refuses to listen to the rider in back or 
the rider in back refuses to pedal.
 ✓ Is fun, when done under the right circum-
stances (see the preceding bullet).
 ✓ Decreases our dependence on foreign oil 
and reduces global warming gases.
Disadvantages of bicycle riding:
 ✓ May take a long time to get wherever you 
intend to go and, if your energy runs out, 
may not get there at all (unless you camp 
beside the road for a few hours while you 
recharge your power source).
 ✓ Can result in ridiculous displays of spandex 
and decals.
 ✓ Causes large thigh muscles which may 
make it necessary to purchase specially 
designed clothing, particularly tight pants.
 ✓ Can result in several moments of confusion, 
disbelief, anger, and finally self-pity as you 
walk home because you didn’t have a good 
lock. 
 ✓ Is an irritant to conventional transport driv-
ers when you don’t yield the right of way, 
which on a bike, you’re often tempted to do.

his would not be a For Dummies book without these

and provide a list of the best ways to invest in alternative 
energy so that you can begin to make a difference, right 
now, today.

Chapter 22
Ten or So Myths about Energy
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at energy in a new way
▶ Reviewing conspiracies 
▶ Peeking into the future
A
lot of stubborn myths abound when it comes to energy. By reading this 
book, you can gain an appreciation for the subtleties inherent to the 
subject of energy and the knowledge to separate the wheat from the chaff. 
The fact is, while energy itself is an easy concept to understand (it’s simply 
useable power), how energy works — the physics of it — can be pretty slip-
pery. Here’s an example of how the principles governing energy’s charac-
teristics isn’t intuitive: After you use energy, it’s gone, right? Wrong. Add to 
this the media’s tendency to exaggerate problems because it sells copy and 
downplay the good news because it doesn’t, and you have fertile territory for 
mythology. In this chapter I explore and attempt to debunk some of the more 
prevalent myths.
The World Is Doomed to a Gloomy Future
The current global warming forecasters warn of a dismal world, with rampant 
starvation and global population displacement — unless someone steps in 
now to do something about it. The little glimmer of hope that quick action 
can make a difference is often doused by two things: the common perception 
that humans are, by and large, incapable of caring about things that don’t 
present an immediate danger and by how ill-prepared the world seems to be 
to address the problems. When you read a newspaper or watch the news, it’s 
easy to get hung up on the negatives, and it seems as though the only envi-
ronmental news is bad news.
But people do care and, when motivated, can do remarkable things. Don’t 
let anybody tell you any different. Problems get solved, perhaps a little later 
than they should, and perhaps with a little more fanfare than they should, 
but they do get solved eventually. 

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Case in point: Back in the ’60s, there were a lot of environmental problems 
that have since been cleaned up due to the fact that people care and can 
marshal the resources necessary to act for the good of the environment and 
their communities. I remember, in particular, a photo shoot of Lake Michigan 
before and after cleanup legislation was enacted. The before photo showed 
a human hand that had been dipped into the lake — it was covered in gory 
slime. Ten years later, an identically staged photo showed a hand with little 
more than clean water. 
As far as the global warming, people are starting to take great strides in the 
right direction. They’re spending money on new cars that get better gas mile-
age. They’re making changes in the way they consume energy and demanding 
that the businesses they rely on also go green. They’re calling their represen-
tatives and sharing their concerns. Even if you’ve done nothing else, you’ve 
bought this book because you want to understand the options that are avail-
able or on the horizon. (Personally, I think people should buy more copies of 
this book and hand them out to all their friends.)
Bottom line: The current dilemma will be solved because people are basically 
good and want to do the right thing.
We Can Legislate Our 
Way Out of the Mess
Many people believe that it’s the government’s responsibility to legislate 
environmental and energy laws that will solve the country’s addiction to 
fossil fuels and encourage conservation and efficiency. While government 
must lead the way, it’s the responsibility of every private citizen to engage 
solutions on whatever level they can contribute — even if this means enter-
ing into the political process itself so as to get the system moving the way it 
should. Relying on government is a form of passing the buck, and it doesn’t 
really work very well anyway.
Energy efficiency at home is the best place to start. Using less energy is very 
easy, for most people. It begins with education (see my book Energy Efficient 
Homes For Dummies [Wiley] for a good start). Understanding how and why 
you use energy, and what it accomplishes for you is imperative. In my experi-
ence, most homes and businesses can cut their power bills by over 20 per-
cent without experiencing any appreciable loss of quality of life. 
 
Every little bit helps, as the saying goes. And every thousand-mile journey 
begins with the first step. Just remember that it’s up to you, not your 
government.

329
 Chapter 22: Ten or So Myths about Energy
The Electric Car Was Deliberately Killed
Conspiracy theorists claim the big auto companies could be providing con-
sumers with automobiles that get over 100 miles per gallon but they don’t 
because it will affect their bottom line. In the same vein, there is a lot of talk 
about how the big auto companies killed the electric car simply because 
they’re cheaper (being smaller), and so the profit margins will be less. 
The fact is, all successful companies basically provide their customers with 
what the customers want. Americans drive massive SUVs and trucks because 
that’s what they want to drive. If Americans wanted electric cars, they would 
have them. If they wanted mopeds, they would have them. (Some things they 
get whether they want it or not, like ineffectual government.)
The electric cars that were introduced back in the early ’90s were inferior for 
a number of important reasons, the most important being their limited range 
and how long it took to recharge the batteries (you can read more about 
these early cars in Chapter 18). When electric cars make sense and can meet 
the performance standards of modern drivers, people will buy them and the 
automakers will build them exactly the way people want them. 
As an interesting side note, consider what has happened to the American 
auto makers. They did not anticipate that consumers would want small, fuel-
efficient cars. The Japanese car companies have done a good job of devel-
oping and providing these, so American manufacturer’s market share has 
dwindled. It’s very simple; you give the consumer what they want and you 
make money.
Now as to whether Big Oil kidnapped the inventor of a 100 percent efficient 
engine that operates only on water . . .
Conservation and Efficiency 
Can Save the World
No matter what you may think, conservation and improved efficiency don’t 
lead to less energy consumption; they actually lead to more. The fact is, the 
more efficient a technology is made, the more people use it. When cars get 
better gas mileage, people drive them more and make up for the difference. 
When televisions and appliances are more efficient, people use them more. 
When fossil fuel extraction technologies become more efficient, the cost of 
energy goes down and people use more energy. Efficiency has rarely resulted 
in a decrease in consumption. (Go to Chapter 7 for a complete discussion of 
this phenomenon.)

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Conservation and efficiency work on a micro, or household, level. When 
people are conscientious about how they use energy, they can easily use 
less and the effects can be profound. But on a macro scale, conservation and 
efficiency only work when there is an economic incentive. For that reason, 
government needs to apply higher taxes to energy in order to make conserva-
tion and efficiency work on a broad scale. This is why European cultures use 
less energy, per capita, than North America. European energy taxes are much 
higher than American taxes. Yet people in Europe do not have a diminished 
standard of living compared to ours.
There’s an Energy Shortage
Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only change forms. I 
explain this in some detail in Chapter 3. When fossil fuels are extracted from 
the ground and burned, energy merely changes form from the liquid crude 
potential energy form into heat, which then changes form once again into 
motive energy (energy which drives machinery). To say that energy is used is 
entirely incorrect. 
That’s why there is no shortage of energy and there never will be. There may 
not even be a shortage of fossil fuel energy resources for another 100 years 
or so. The problem is not that the country or world is running out of energy, 
it’s that the current use of fossil fuel energy is causing too many problems. 
Pollution is at the forefront, but Americans also experience political and 
cultural problems when too much fossil fuel is used. There is certainly no 
shortage of solar energy, nor wind energy. Over 35,000 times more energy 
than humans use falls onto the earth every day from the sun. If we could just 
convert a small portion of that into useable electrical energy, we’d be set.
There is virtually an infinite supply of energy available to humankind. The 
question is how the various forms of energy are transformed into work that 
we wish to accomplish. And that’s where big improvements can be made.
Nuclear Power Plants Are 
Ticking Time Bombs
Nuclear power plants cannot explode like an atomic bomb. The physical 
process is entirely different between a nuclear reactor and a nuclear bomb. 
Reactors are based on fission while bombs are based on fusion. Bombs rely 
on chain reactions and the fuel is spent almost instantaneously. Nuclear reac-
tor rods are consumed slowly, and there are a host of safeguards to make 
sure that meltdowns and other accidents cannot occur.

331
 Chapter 22: Ten or So Myths about Energy
The containment structures built around the nuclear reactors in the free 
world are designed to withstand tremendous explosions and still keep 
the reactors intact. Three Mile Island proved this. (The Russian reactor at 
Chernobyl that caused so much environmental and health damage was inten-
tionally built substandard. Its failure was not a reflection of nuclear reactor 
technology.) France has proven that a well-designed, well-regulated nuclear 
reactor system can be a viable and effective source of energy. It’s too bad the 
United States didn’t copy France’s lead; otherwise, America’s political and 
economic situation would be far different today.
For more about nuclear power, head to Chapter 8.
Electric Cars Will Displace All Others
While electric cars offer many advantages over fossil fuel–powered cars, 
they are not destined to become the sole type of transportation of the future; 
nor do they solve all the problems inherent in fossil fuel use. The first and 
foremost problem with electric cars is that they need to be plugged in and 
recharged on a periodic basis. While they don’t emit noxious gases them-
selves, the power plants that provide the electric power do. And in the 
United States, over half of its electrical power comes from coal-fired power 
plants. Coal is one of the dirtiest sources of energy, and there are no truly 
promising solutions that will eliminate this problem. There is talk of clean-
burning coal plants, but what this basically means is that the power plants 
will be cleaner than they used to be, not that they’ll be clean. Coal may never 
be truly “clean,” compared to alternatives.
The most sensible program would be to use a large number of nuclear reac-
tors to provide the electricity to recharge electric cars. But nuclear reactors 
take decades to build, and this rosy scenario of nuclear-powered electric 
vehicles will take at least another 30 years to come to fruition.
Anything Labeled “Green” Is Green
It’s the in thing these days to claim that your company is “green.” The race 
is on to see who’s the greenest. Business used to be all about being lean and 
mean; now they’re about being green.
You’ll hear companies proclaim that they are “carbon neutral,” meaning that 
on net, they emit no greenhouse gases, or see advertisements on television 
and in the media lauding their greenness on a daily basis. Even stock brokers 
are racing to see who is the greenest (touting things like, “We don’t use any 
paper in our offices!”).

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
But when you read the fine print, you’ll often find that there are some sig-
nificant exceptions. For instance, a manufacturer may claim that its carbon 
footprint is zero, but this may be true for only a small portion of the manufac-
turing cycle. No mention is made of transporting the wares to the consumer, 
which takes a lot of gasoline. Or no mention is made of the fact that many of 
the parts are made in a country, like China, where environmentalism is nearly 
nonexistent.
 
So when you hear claims of “greenness,” keep this in mind: There is no gov-
erning regulations with regard to the word “green.” Anybody can use the 
word, and if their claim is a complete fabrication, there are no penalties. If you 
are looking for green companies to do business with, look deeper than the sur-
face and find out just what is actually green about the company’s products 
and processes. If you think they’re stretching it, write a letter to a local news-
paper and expose them. Then they’ll have to make more effort and clean up 
their act. Or else use more green paint.
Waste is Bad
Whenever energy changes form, waste is an unavoidable result. When gaso-
line is burned, there is a good deal of waste, and there’s nothing that can 
change that. When a solar panel converts sunlight into electricity, a great 
deal of waste results. Every energy process results in waste. The more 
refined the energy process, the more waste. Creating the refined energy 
needed to drive a modern computer chip entails a huge amount of waste, and 
that will never change. The more sophisticated our computers become, the 
more waste the usage of those computers will entail. Period. (You can read 
more about this concept, called entropy, in Chapter 3.) 
We need energy for many different reasons. We use energy to provide our 
food supply, the most basic of all needs. We use energy for transport, for 
heating and to provide us with the myriad forms of entertainment that we 
take for granted. Whenever we use energy, we waste a lot more than we use. 
That will never change simply because it can’t. To say that waste is bad is to 
say that energy usage is bad.
The historical record states unequivocally that societies progress along 
with the sophistication of their use of energy. The difference between the 
third-world and first-world countries is very simply ascribed to the fact that 
first-world countries use much more energy and as a result have a far greater 
economic output. They also waste a lot more energy than third-world coun-
tries as well.

333
 Chapter 22: Ten or So Myths about Energy
If our economy is to grow and prosper, we will need to use more and more 
energy. And we will, as a consequence, waste more and more energy.
Waste is good! Rejoice in waste in all its forms.
Solar Power Can Provide All 
Our Electrical Needs
Solar power is an excellent investment for those lucky enough to live in con-
ducive climates, such as the Southwestern United States. As technological 
improvements take hold, and the cost of solar decreases, more and more 
people will be able take advantage, but solar power will never be able to pro-
vide all of the country’s energy needs. 
In order to power New York City with solar power, for example, an area of 
solar photovoltaic panels twice the size of New York City would be required. 
Where are these panels going to go? Over the city, or in somebody else’s 
backyard? Way off yonder where nobody can see them?
In addition, solar power works only when the sun is shining (it don’t work 
where the sun don’t shine, as they say in the industry). Unfortunately, most 
residential and business energy is consumed when the sun isn’t shining, for 
instance, on a cold winter day.
Finally, solar power is not economical unless government subsidies help 
reduce the cost. This is not likely to change in the next decade. Solar power 
is very good for certain applications, but it’s not going to take over the world 
for a long, long time.
Burning Wood is Bad For 
the Environment
Like all biomass, wood is carbon neutral, which means that the carbon con-
tained in the raw source came from the atmosphere (while the plant material 
was growing), and when the biomass source is burned that carbon simply 
reenters the atmosphere from whence it came. In other words, a chunk of 
wood left to rot on the forest floor releases as much carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere as that same chunk burned in a wood stove. It’s a closed loop, 
and so wood burning does not contribute to global warming.

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The problem with wood burning is that most of it is done improperly or very 
inefficiently. Most wood stoves are old and leaky, for example, and the wood 
burns too fast. And most wood stoves do not deliver heat into the interior 
spaces of the home or business nearly as efficiently as they could. Most of 
the heat goes right up the chimney and out into the great outdoors where it’s 
not needed at all.
 
The solution is to use high quality, modern equipment to burn the wood. This 
makes a lot of economic sense because the cost of heating is drastically 
reduced when efficiency is increased. 
If Global Warming Isn’t Our Fault, 
We’re Off the Hook
Since I’m an open-minded guy, I must conclude this chapter with an open-
minded analysis of some hard facts. Thirty years ago, global cooling was all 
the rage. Magazines loudly trumpeted the end of the world via a creeping ice 
age predicated by mankind’s fossil fuel–burning emissions. Leading scientists 
warned that if we failed to curtail our use of fossil fuels the world would soon 
freeze over. There was scientific consensus at the highest levels.
How things have changed. Now we’re inundated with warnings about global 
warming, and the evidence is crystal clear. But the evidence for global cool-
ing was also crystal clear. The fact is, Earth has undergone over 600 warming 
and cooling cycles. Humans had nothing to do with these cycles. So it may be 
that the current warming trend is simply Mother Nature acting fickle, as she 
always has. 
Regardless of where you fall on the “is it or isn’t it real” question, a big ques-
tion still looms. What should we do if global warming is real but is not being 
caused by our greenhouse gas emissions? Should we forget all this alternative-
energy nonsense and keep blasting away with our fuel-hungry leaf blowers? 
Should we continue to drive our Hummers back and forth to the mailbox 
across the street because we’re too lazy to walk?
In my view, the Golden Rule applies. We should simply treat Mother Nature 
the same way we would like for her to treat us. We’ve been doing a poor job 
of that lately, and I think we can improve. And that means pursuing alternative-
energy solutions that protect the environment and make economic sense. 

Chapter 23

Alternative-Energy Future
In This Chapter
▶ Changing habits 
▶ Looking at where you live
▶ Figuring out where and how much 
B
y now you’re chomping at the bit to do something tangible. You’ve 
found out a lot about efficiency and alternative energy and have some 
ideas how you can make an appreciable impact. In this chapter, I present 
some of the best and most direct options for you to consider. The list is cer-
tainly not exhaustive, and everybody can contribute on his or her own terms. 
But I’ve tried to winnow the options down to those that make the most sense 
and impact.
Performing an Energy Audit 
of Your Home or Business
An energy audit is a formal process for evaluating your home or business to 
see precisely where, how, and how much energy you are using. You can hire 
a professional auditor (look in the yellow pages or on the Internet), or you 
can perform the audit yourself. It’s not hard; it doesn’t take a lot of time; and 
it’s well worth the effort. 
In the process of performing the audit you’ll learn a lot of things that never 
occurred to you. For instance, how much propane do you use in your fam-
ily’s barbeque? How much gasoline do you use to mow your lawn or blow 
the leaves off of your driveway? How many batteries do you use? How much 
water do you use? Do you recycle, and how much energy are you saving in 
the process? 

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Even more than the actual hard numbers that you end up with, you get a 
broader picture of just how much and which types of energy you use — info 
that may both surprise you and present improvements you can make imme-
diately to reduce your energy consumption. As a professional auditor of both 
businesses and homes, I’ve found that most people can save between 10 and 
20 percent of their power bills without sacrificing much in the way of qual-
ity of life. Many people can save over a third of their power bills by simply 
changing habits and rearranging the way they use energy. You don’t need to 
buy new appliances (although you may want to after you see how much that 
old refrigerator is costing you).
To perform an energy audit, you want to find out how much energy you’re 
using and how much it costs (you can find complete instructions in my book 
Energy Efficient Homes For Dummies [Wiley]):
 
✓ Get a history of your power bills. You can request records from your 
utility company, or you can retrieve old bills from your file cabinet. 
Simply by studying the trends you’ll learn some important things like 
how much your air-conditioning costs compared to your heating. 
 
✓ Make a list of the appliances in your home or business that use energy 
and evaluate how much energy each appliance uses. Most appliances 
have labels that tell you how much power they use. Measure the amount 
of time each appliance is on and multiply that by the power consump-
tion to get a loose idea of how much each appliance is using. Don’t 
forget to include the cost of space heaters, swamp coolers, ceiling fans, 
and the like.
 
✓ Evaluate how much that energy costs. On your power bills the rate 
schedule will be defined. Multiply the amount of energy by the cost, and 
you can determine how much each appliance is costing. 
The bottom line is that the more information you can compile, the better 
your efforts will be focused to reduce your power consumption. 
Installing a New Stove
If you burn wood in your home, chances are you are using an old, cast-iron 
stove that may have sentimental value but is inefficient and highly polluting 
to boot. The vast majority of wood stoves are over ten years old, and that 
means they’re substandard compared to today’s technology. New wood 
stoves use advanced combustion technologies that make the burning pro-
cess up to five times more efficient than old stoves. This means that it’ll cost 

337
 Chapter 23: Ten-Plus Ways to Invest in an Alternative-Energy Future
a lot less to heat your home and reduce the amount of pollution you’re emit-
ting by about ten times. You’ll be feeding wood into the stove much less as 
well, not to mention the chopping and carrying and stacking and spiders and 
backaches. 
Even if you don’t switch to a new stove, you can probably use your exist-
ing stove more efficiently. I describe how in Chapter 14. You’ll save money 
and help the environment at the same time. It may take a little effort to learn 
better techniques, but once they’re in place you’ll benefit forevermore.
Even better, change from wood to natural gas, which burns much cleaner 
because the combustion process is so highly regulated. When you burn 
wood, it’s nearly impossible to get the same emission efficiency as a good 
gas stove because wood burns differently depending on how much of a given 
chunk has already burned (when you first light a wood stove, the burning 
is very inefficient, and you can’t get around the starting phase unless you 
simply burn in perpetuity). A good gas fireplace emits far less pollutants per 
unit of heat produced than a wood stove. 
However, I will have to concede that burning gas can be more expensive than 
burning wood (especially if you have a source of free wood). I switched from 
wood to gas and my overall cost of heating went up around ten percent. But 
it’s worth it. No more spiders or dirt. No more chopping wood, or stacking 
or carrying or cleaning out the filthy ashes. With a nice new gas fireplace all 
you do is press a button and you have heat (sounds kind of lazy, doesn’t it?). 
The new gas stoves look very nice, and the flames don’t seem artificial at all. 
(Forget electric fireplaces — they look weird and consume a lot of electricity.)
Best of all, install a stove that burns biomass-produced natural gas. Or install 
a corn or other biomass stove that’s extremely efficient. Check out Chapter 
13 for more details on biomass stoves.
Using Solar
If you’re in the right climate, solar PV can be a great investment, and it 
helps the environment more than any other alternative-energy source you 
can employ. Solar power entails no greenhouse gases at all (aside from the 
invested energy consumed in the manufacturing process of the panels and 
equipment). And there will never be a shortage of solar power. See Chapter 9 
for more details on the great advantages of going solar.

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Governments are subsidizing solar PV systems to the tune of nearly 50 per-
cent of system cost, in some parts of the country. You can obtain financing 
from some utilities, which makes the out-of-pocket expense minimal. And 
once your solar system is up and running, your power bills will be very small. 
Solar customers love their systems; just ask somebody who has solar. They’ll 
tell you the investment was well worth it. In fact, a vast majority of solar cus-
tomers will tell you that they wish they had installed a larger system. That’s 
not a cheesy sales hook, it’s a fact.
Another good solar investment is installing a solar hot-water heater on your 
roof. The typical home consumes anywhere between 15 and 20 percent of 
its total energy budget on heating water for use in dishwashers, washing 
machines, sinks, and showers, among other things. A solar water heater can 
displace up to 80 percent of this cost, depending on how you use the system 
and what type of climate you live in. The same subsidies that apply to solar 
photovoltaics apply to solar water heaters, so the cost can be reduced signifi-
cantly. At this writing, a federal tax credit of 30 percent applies to both solar 
hot water and solar PV. That’s a big incentive.
 
And if you install a solar water heater, you can install solar PV later on; they 
work very well together. You can make a smaller investment now, and leave 
the big bucks for later (when you get that raise you’ve been working so hard 
for). Just make sure you plan ahead and have enough roof space because solar 
PV is fussier about how it’s placed on a roof. If you want to install solar hot 
water, followed by solar PV a few years later, get quotes and information for 
both types of systems now and you’ll understand the limitations and advan-
tages so that you can get the most benefit.
Consult my book Solar Power Your Home For Dummies (Wiley) for a lot more 
details on how to use solar power. 
Using Biofuels to Power Your Car
You may not even know it, but most new cars can burn biofuels, like ethanol, 
without your making any changes to the engine. You can find local gas sta-
tions that provide biofuels by asking around or consulting the Internet, and 
you can make a habit of filling up at these stations.
You can also make some minor modifications to your auto’s engine and burn 
higher concentrations of biofuels, or different types of biofuels. See Chapter 
17 for more details.

339
 Chapter 23: Ten-Plus Ways to Invest in an Alternative-Energy Future
Biofuels burn cleaner and the engine works better. Plus the carbon cycle is 
closed loop so you’re not contributing to global warming as much as if you 
use pure gasoline. You won’t be able to tell the difference in your car’s per-
formance either.
Driving a Hybrid
The cost of a hybrid auto or truck is higher than the cost of an equivalent 
gasoline-powered vehicle, but you’ll get much better gas mileage, and you’ll 
be emitting a lot less pollution. So while the upfront cost may be more, you’ll 
see savings all along the way in terms of paying for gas. See Chapter 19 for 
more details on driving hybrids.
Hybrids are here now, and there are more and more of them on the road 
every year. Most major auto manufacturers offer various versions of hybrids, 
so your choices are broad, and getting more so every year. Many auto manu-
facturers offer their conventionally powered autos with hybrid options (for 
instance, Camry, by Toyota). You won’t be able to tell the difference in per-
formance, but your gasoline bills will be much smaller.
 
There’s a less direct effect as well. When you buy a hybrid, you help reduce 
the cost of future hybrids so that even more people will get into the game. 
The cost of any manufactured product is a function of how many of them are 
built, so the more hybrids on the road, the less they will cost. When you buy a 
hybrid, you’re investing in the future in both a direct and indirect way.
Installing a Geothermal Heating and 
Cooling System in Your Home
I explain the pros and cons of geothermal energy in Chapter 12. The tech-
nology is not cheap, but it’s extremely clean and reliable. New homes, in 
particular, can benefit from the installation of geothermal because it’s much 
less expensive to start a geothermal system from scratch than to retrofit an 
existing home.
You will need to have access to the right soil conditions, but if you do, this 
option is an excellent investment, particularly where heating and cooling bills 
are high year-round. The upfront cost of geothermal equipment is high, but 
the power bills will be forever low. You’ll not only get lower power bills, but 

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
you’ll be immune from energy price spikes in the future. The value of a home 
equipped with geothermal equipment is much higher than a conventional 
home, so you’ll recoup your investment if you decide to sell your home. The 
higher energy prices go, the more your geothermal system will be worth.
Driving with Diesel (Without the Stink)
In Europe, diesel autos and trucks are numerous and common. Diesel-
powered propulsion is more efficient than gasoline, and with the right equip-
ment, the pollution levels can be much lower as well.
The diesel vehicles that were sold in the United States back in the early ’80s 
gave diesel an unwarranted bad name, and most Americans equate diesel 
with dirty, sooty exhaust and strange sounds. New diesel vehicles, with 
European-developed technology, are clean, powerful, and efficient.
Diesel fuel is available almost everywhere, although sometimes it costs a 
little more. But because you’ll be getting better gas mileage, your fuel bills 
will be lower, on net. Diesel engines last longer than gasoline-powered 
engines and require a lot less maintenance.
Best of all, use biodiesel (See Chapter 17 for more details). It’s hard to find 
right now, but that’ll change as more people get into the game. Diesel engines 
can burn a wide range of different fuel sources without need for modification.
Installing a Windmill in 
Your Own Backyard
Wind power is going to grow exponentially in the next few decades simply 
because it makes a tremendous amount of sense. If you have the right condi-
tions, a small-scale windmill can give you a return on investment much better 
than most other alternative-energy options. In particular, the payback period 
for a good windmill is around two thirds that of a solar PV system. Wind is 
generally available more often than solar power, which only works when the 
sun is shining.
You’ll need a windy location, and you’ll need to consider such things as 
sound and how the windmill affects the scenery. You may have to get special 
permits, so consult your county building department. You may also want to 
check with your neighbors or your neighborhood association, if you have 
one, as they will be sharing the sound and visual effects with you, whether 
they want to or not.

341
 Chapter 23: Ten-Plus Ways to Invest in an Alternative-Energy Future
You can install a small-scale windmill yourself, but there are some complica-
tions that require you to be very good with tools and hardware systems. If 
you don’t install a windmill properly, it can be very dangerous. Check out 
Chapter 11 for more details.
Moving into a Smaller, 
Energy-Efficient Home
In general, the smaller the home, the less energy the home consumes. Many 
large homes have long hallways and awkward layouts that are not conducive 
to maximizing space. A good small home can often feel every bit as spacious 
as a good-sized mansion, if the design is done well. My personal impression 
of large homes is that they are more for showing off wealth than creature 
comfort. That sort of attitude is becoming obsolete in this day and age of 
energy concern.
If you’re buying a new home, or an existing home, consider the layout, and 
the way the existing space is partitioned. Also consider how energy efficient 
the home is. Look for energy-efficient appliances, and if possible, find a home 
with solar power, or geothermal. A good stove is a plus. You can ask for a 
history of power bills, but you’ll have to determine how your own power con-
sumption relates to that of the seller.
Living in an Urban Environment
Living in the suburbs entails long drives and big, autonomous homes, 
along with spacious yards and landscaping. All of this consumes inordinate 
amounts of energy. If you live in an urban environment, however, you can 
take advantage of mass transit and the amount of energy required for modu-
lar and high-density living is much less than for a home sitting all by itself. 
Government studies have indicated that urban living consumes around 60 
percent of the energy, per capita, that suburban or rural living does. That 
also equates to around 60 percent of the carbon footprint. Urban buildings 
are generally fitted with natural gas pipelines, which are difficult to find in 
most suburban and rural environments. In addition, many urbanites don’t 
even own cars, which equates to big energy savings. And smaller cars are 
more practical in cities as well. The average auto mileage for vehicles owned 
by people who live in cities is around 25 percent higher than for vehicles 
owned by suburbanites.

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Investing in Energy Stocks
There are thousands of energy companies, some better than others. Many 
new startups are dedicated to developing and selling green technologies, for 
instance solar and wind power companies.
Instead of insisting on a maximum return from your investment dollars as 
your only criteria for investment, you can also look for companies that pro-
mote environmentalism. You can even find companies that are green, and 
also make a lot of green. Energy is a hot topic these days, and the buzz itself 
often creates profitable ventures. However, be sure to do your research and 
make sure your “green” company is truly green because some unscrupulous 
companies claim undue environmental concern.
 
Wind power companies, in my view, are going to grow quite a bit in the next 
few decades. If you’re interested in a long term investment with a lot of green 
impact, find a good wind power company and buy its stock.
Driving Less
Perhaps this is too obvious to merit inclusion, but one of the biggest things 
you can do to help out with our energy problem is simply to drive less. Plan 
ahead; when you need to run errands, make a route that takes you to all 
the places you need to go in the most time-saving way. Take your vacations 
closer to home. Walk to those places you can reach on foot rather than drive. 
Carpool or use mass transit whenever possible. The list of ways to reduce 
your driving is endless.
