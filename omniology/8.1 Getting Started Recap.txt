Getting Started with Node  
So, in this section, you learned that: 
- Node is a runtime environment for executing JS code. 
- Essentially, Node is a C++ program that embeds Chrome’s v8 engine, the fastest 
JS engine in the world. 
- We use Node to build fast and scalable networking applications. It’s a perfect 
choice for building RESTful services. 
- Node applications are single-threaded. That means a single thread is used to 
serve all clients. 
- Node applications are asynchronous or non-blocking by default. That means 
when the application involves I/O operations (eg accessing the ﬁle system or the 
network), the thread doesn’t wait (or block) for the result of the operation. It is 
released to serve other clients. 
- This architecture makes Node ideal for building I/O-intensive applications. 
- You should avoid using Node for CPU-intensive applications, such as a video 
encoding service. Because while executing these operations, other clients have 
to wait for the single thread to ﬁnish its job and be ready to serve them. 
- In Node, we don’t have browser environment objects such as window or the 
document object. Instead, we have other objects that are not available in 
browsers, such as objects for working with the ﬁle system, network, operating 
system, etc.
