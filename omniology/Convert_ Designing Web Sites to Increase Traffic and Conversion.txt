Just about every business organization with any sense nowadays has a web site.
You’ve got to, because just about everybody with any sense goes on the Internet when 
they want to fi nd out about something—especially if they are thinking of spending 
money.
Unfortunately, most websites are appallingly bad at what they are supposed to do: 
inform, infl uence or persuade as many people as possible.
But even if your site is a blessed exception, it isn’t much use if hardly anybody ever 
visits it—which is true of the overwhelming majority of sites. As my old boss David 
Ogilvy observed, “You can’t save souls in an empty church.”
Th at is why this book is a tremendous bargain.
First of all it is written in plain English, unlike a great many business books which 
seem designed to display the writers’ polysyllabic dexterity rather than help the 
readers.
Second, it takes you logically through all the things you need to know to get more 
business—and more of the right kind of business—at the least cost.
Th ird, it is full of practical examples so you can easily relate to what the writer is talk-
ing about. 
Read it once and you will learn a lot. Read it twice and you will start to think about 
many ways you can do better.
Th en read it again and act upon what you have discovered. You will not regret it.

Foreword


It wasn’t that long ago that all the people who had confi dence that the Internet could 
become a “real” medium fi t around a small table.
I know because I was one of them.
You can’t imagine how hard it was back in the early 1990s to interest Silicon Valley 
and “interactive digital media” types in the Internet’s commercial potential.
Of course today the Internet’s impact and infl uence has far outstripped even the most 
wild-eyed predictions from those early days.
But a huge disconnect remains.
Th e Internet is a trackable medium, which means unlike print, radio, TV or just 
about any medium you can name, designers, and producers can actually see how their 
creations impact users.
Strangely, it’s a very rare web designer who takes advantage of this simple, but game-
changing fact.
Th e biggest reason for this is that—until now—no one has shown them how to track 
and test diff erent approaches and made the case for why they should do it.
In writing this book, Ben Hunt has undertaken a task that few professionals in any 
fi eld have the guts to tackle.  He set aside his preconceptions about web design—ones 
that made him highly successful—and looked at the subject with beginner’s eyes.
Th e result—this book—is as exciting as anything I’ve seen since Marc Andreessen 
added the image tag to HTML.
Internet design fads come and go.
Th e book you hold in your hands is a rock solid foundation you can build your future on.

Foreword


In 2007, I wrote an ebook called “Save the Pixel—the Art of Simple Web Design,” 
which teaches that simplicity is the key to designing web pages that work. Th e book 
has sold more than 8,000 copies, and my agency Scratchmedia has become well 
known for the clean, spacious design style.
Aft er I presented on simple web design at Ken McCarthy’s System Intensive seminar 
in 2008, I was asked what evidence I could share that proved the eff ectiveness of my 
approach. I was shocked to realize I had no numbers to prove that simplicity works!
I made a commitment to discover what really makes the diff erence between an ordi-
nary web site and a great site. I devised a plan to make design fi xes to a range of web 
sites. Th ese fi xes would address 50 common web design mistakes, which I thought 
would have a positive, measurable impact on the conversion rates of web sites (that is, 
what proportion of people took the action the designer intended).
I planned to test each of these changes across multiple sites and then to compare the 
results. Th ese experiments would generate data that would prove which design factors 
make the most impact on conversion. I would publish the results in this book, to give 
other site owners a checklist of guaranteed fi xes. I found several site owners who were 
willing to let my team experiment on their sites, and we set to work.
Th e project did not work out in the way I had envisaged. When I started out on this 
journey, I thought this book would be about graphic design. I discovered that graphic 
design is only one factor in what makes your site work—and a relatively minor one.
Aft er running about 100 experiments on dozens of web sites, I discovered that it is 
possible to improve success rates on every web site—in many cases signifi cantly! My 
team has more than doubled the conversion rates of several web pages on a range of 
sites, oft en through simple fi xes to common problems.
My extensive research, and the results of our own experiments, have taught me that 
optimizing a web site goes much deeper than just simplifying its design. Yes, graphic 
design has a part to play in the success of your web site, but I have also discovered 
some far more powerful techniques, which you can start to implement today, and 
which don’t require graphic design skills!
introduCtion

xx ❘ Introduction
Who This Book Is For
This is not the “50 Proven Design Fixes” book I intended to write. This is a guide you 
can use to transform the success rate of any web site. Its lessons will be useful to every 
web site owner, every marketeer, every web developer, and every designer.
You need no particular creative or technical skills to apply the lessons in these chap-
ters. Crafting web sites that work comes down to a few simple disciplines, which I set 
out for you in a simple step-by-step guide.
This book is for everyone who has a web site that is failing, is just “doing okay,” or 
even doing pretty well. If you own a web site, or you are in charge of one, and you sus-
pect it could be doing more, I think you are right.
Most web sites do not perform anywhere near their potential. They are not seen by 
enough of the right people. And when folks do visit the site, the vast majority leave 
again without getting what they want, or fulfilling the site’s goals.
Do not assume that this is the way it has to be.
Some web sites are found by more of the right people, and when those people come 
they take action. These sites do really well for their owners. Do they succeed because 
they look fantastic, or because they have had thousands invested in search engine 
optimization? No, that is usually not the case.
Web sites that work do a couple of things well: get seen by the right people, and make 
it easy for those people to find what they are looking for. This book tells you how you 
can do the same.
How to Use This Book
This book is organized into two parts. Part I shows you a simple process you can use 
to multiply the traffic to your web site. Part II gives you the techniques you need to 
get visitors to engage with your web site, and to continue to interact until they achieve 
what you want them to do.
I encourage you to start at the beginning and read through. There are hundreds of 
tips and tricks in these pages, but none of them alone will give you breakthrough 
results. When you understand the complete process of web site optimization, you will 

Introduction ❘ xxi
be ready to make a few critical changes that will transform your web sites, and have a 
platform on which to build ongoing optimization.
Part I: Designing for Traffic
The way you structure your web site is the most important factor in attracting visi-
tors. The first part of the book shows how most web sites do it wrong, and gives you a 
new approach to creating web sites that’s guaranteed to bring you much more traffic.
Chapter 1: How to Transform Your Web Site’s Success
u
u
 describes what is wrong 
with the familiar approach to web design and why it is set up to deliver poor 
results. It introduces a new model for creating web sites that target more mar-
kets with greater precision.
Chapter 2: Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
u
u
 shows you how search 
engines work, and how to get your web site seen by more people.
Chapter 3: Expanding Your Reach
u
u
 explains how to get out of your own point of 
view and take your customers’ perspective, multiplying the scope and impact 
of your web site’s message.
Chapter 4: Using the Awareness Ladder
u
u
 gives you a simple but extremely pow-
erful tool for visualizing your markets, addressing groups of prospects you 
have never reached before, and giving them exactly what they need to keep 
engaged with your site.
Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
u
u
 takes you through eight 
real-world case studies, and shows how you can apply the Awareness Ladder 
model to any marketing challenge.
Part II: Designing for Conversion
Getting people on your web site is great—but only if they complete your site’s goals. I 
have spent two years researching and testing to discover what causes people to choose 
to say “yes.” Part II of the book gives you all the techniques you need to turn prospects 
into customers, including a simple three-step structure that gets people to take action.
Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
u
u
 shows you how to model your site using con-
version funnels so that you can spot where you are losing visitors, and what to 
do when you find leaks.

xxii ❘ Introduction
Chapter 7: Get Their Attention
u
u
 gives you a toolkit of techniques for creating 
web pages that engage people’s attention and encourage them to believe they 
are going to find what they want. This chapter addresses basic graphic design 
techniques, including layout, getability, and imagery, as well as essential tips 
for effective copywriting.
Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
u
u
 is packed with techniques for ensuring people 
stay interested and carry on interacting with your web site, so that you can 
deliver a complete message. You will discover why you must present positive 
signs, build trust, and resolve concerns, so that visitors have no reason not to 
keep reading. It also explores ways to craft web pages that work for visitors 
with different personality types.
Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
u
u
 highlights the critical difference between a web 
site that just engages and one that sells. Most web sites simply do a bad job of 
asking people to take action in a way that is timely and powerful. And it is no 
surprise that not enough people take action. Effective calls to action must be 
crafted. This chapter gives you six tips for crafting effective calls to action. It 
explains how to build momentum leading to each call to action, how to keep 
visitors moving forward from each page to the next, and how to get them over 
the crucial finish line. The tips are reinforced with examples of how you can 
use copy and graphics to maximum effect.
Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Strategy
u
u
 gives you the complete step-by-
step guide you need to put into action all the techniques in this book. Whether 
you are creating a new site, or working with an existing site, it tells you exactly 
what to do, in the right order, to start transforming your success.
Chapter 11: Optimizing Your Web Pages
u
u
 shows how to test your web site’s ability 
to convert visitors, using Website Optimizer, the popular free tool from Google. 
I give you a set of practical tips that we have learned the hard way, using these 
approaches on more than 70 of our own experiments over the past year.
How You Can Start to Transform Your Web Site’s 
Success Today
The radical system I set out in this book will deliver incredible results. It will also 
challenge you. It will require you to look at web sites in a new way, and then you must 
put the lessons into action.

Introduction ❘ xxiii
Most of your competitors will never take on the challenge to transform their web 
sites, because it is  easier to keep doing things the way we have always done them. 
Right now, you have a great opportunity to gain a competitive advantage, which you 
can build upon every day. But it takes action.
The sooner you learn the lessons in this book—and apply them—the sooner you will 
start to see amazing results. They are just a few steps away. I invite you to turn to 
Chapter 1 now and take the first step.

how to transform your 
web site’s success
How well is your web site doing? What does success mean? Maybe you have goals you 
can measure. How many of those goals does your site achieve, and what does that 
mean for your business?
Whether you know your site’s current performance, or it’s currently a mystery, I want 
to help you make it far more successful. Th is book shows you how. Using the process I 
teach you in this book, you will get more value for each dollar or each hour you invest 
in your web marketing.
Does This Sound Like Your Web Site?
Do you remember how your web site was created? Th e process probably went some-
thing like this. Th e web designer was briefed. Th e designer used her experience, 
insight, and what she knows about the market to create her best guess at a design that 
would please the client. Th ere was some back and forth about the design, taking into 
account diff erent people’s insights and preferences. Finally, the successful design was 
built and launched.
Th e result is a web site that has all usual content you would expect. Your home page 
tells people who you are and what you do. Th e site talks about all the products and 
services you off er and their features. Th ere may be an FAQ page to answer other ques-
tions prospects may have. Th ere is some means to purchase or to take the next step, 
like a “Contact Us” page.
Th e site may have analytics set up, which tells you how many people are visiting the 
site, what they searched for when they arrived, and where they go on the site. You 
probably do not do anything with that information.
You may even have set up pay-per-click advertising, or done some link-building activity.
ChaPter 1

It all seems pretty complete. But I bet it doesn’t produce great results. I frequently 
hear web site owners tell that they have paid thousands for a web site that has deliv-
ered no business in years.
Here’s the problem. Most site owners—even most web designers—don’t realize how 
much more powerful their web sites could be. The vast majority of sites on the Web 
today could attract far more visitors, and convert far more of those visitors to take 
desired actions and complete the site’s goals.
The reason why most people don’t know how to make their web sites perform better 
is because they are being built the way they have always been built (which is badly). In 
this chapter, I describe this old model of designing web sites, explain why it is insuffi-
cient for your needs, and introduce the new way to go about marketing your business 
on the Web.
The good news is, it is actually quite easy to achieve significant success online. You 
just need to know the steps and put them into practice. All the steps you need to 
know are in this book, together with a complete worked example, case studies, sam-
ples, and a wealth of tips and advice. Follow the steps I give you, and I guarantee you 
will make your web site more successful.
The “First Best Guess” Method of Web Design
I describe the approach to web design that you’re probably familiar with as the “First 
Best Guess” method. The decisions that drive the structure and design of sites is 
based mainly on guesswork, or on looking at the competition’s sites, which were 
designed based on guesswork.
When it comes to delivering results, this method has a poor track record. It is funda-
mentally flawed, because it is ignorant about what factors really influence success and 
how to optimize those factors.
Bad at Attracting Traffic
With regard to attracting visitors, the old method takes the view, “If you build it, they 
will come.” The client and designer assume that all you can do is sum up what you do 
as clearly as possible, ensure the search engines find the site, get links from relevant 
directories, and wait for visitors to turn up.

The “First Best Guess” Method of Web Design ❘ 5
If you need more visitors, you can buy traffic through advertising, which does not 
always pay off. You might also hire a search engine optimization (SEO) firm to gener-
ate better search rankings through an extensive link-building campaign. This also 
does not always work.
The fundamental flaw with this approach to getting visitors is that it is far too narrow. 
It takes a singular approach. You have a home page, which says what the company 
does and what you’re about. You have a page for your services or products, and maybe 
another page that describes each one.
The result is that you get a generic home page that gives several weak and mixed mes-
sages. The product or service pages give more detailed information that might attract 
people looking for those things. The “frequently asked questions” page might add a 
few more useful terms that stand a chance of matching the occasional search engine 
query.
It isn’t that there is anything wrong with this approach. The problem is that it isn’t 
enough. It falls far short of what is possible. The rest of Part I of this book will show 
you how much farther it is possible to reach, and exactly how to do it for your own 
web site.
Bad at Conversion
When it comes to converting visitors into customers, again the traditional approach 
is pretty ineffective. The site talks about what you do and how you do it. It tells visi-
tors about the features of your products, and provides the information they need. 
And it gives them a way to buy, to request more information, or to contact you. What 
more could it do?
The answer is: a lot more! When a web site is designed correctly, it can engage directly 
with many more different types of visitors and lead them to find exactly what they 
want.
A site that is at once too narrow and too generic will fail to attract the right people. 
When search engines find a page that talks about a bunch of different things, they 
will identify that the page is about several topics (but none with much strength). 
Search engines match pages to people’s searches, so generic pages will only be 
matched to generic searches. But no one is searching for a bunch of different topics 
together. When someone searches, they search for a specific thing, and they will get 
the result that is most relevant to that thing.

6 ❘ Chapter 1: How to Tr ansform Your Web Site’s Success
Say your business is tax advice. You may attract someone looking for “tax advisor” in 
your local area. But how many people who need tax advice are looking specifically for 
“tax advisor”? Only a minority. Many more will be looking for a range of more spe-
cific needs, such as “managing tax on saving for child’s college fund.”
For those who are searching for your generic offering, how much competition is there 
for that term? If your web site does not appear on the first couple of search engine 
results pages, it is unlikely to bring you much business.
If visitors do arrive at your “tax advisor” home page, they will find a broad message 
that describes all the different things you can do. If they do not connect quickly with 
a message that tells them they are in the right place to get what they want, they are 
unlikely to persevere. They will go back to the search results and try again to find a 
better fit.
Part II of this book is all about optimizing your conversion rates for visitors who do 
come to your web site. It breaks down in detail the steps for generating conversions, 
and gives you clear steps to get the maximum value from every visitor.
A New Perspective on Web Design
The methods I teach you in this book require a new perspective on what “web design” 
means.
Design does not mean creating stuff that looks good. That’s art. Someone who creates 
web pages that look good, whether or not they work, is not a web designer but an art-
ist, or a graphic designer at best.
You should view design as the creation of a new solution to a problem. That often 
means creating an experience for people, whether it be a lecture, a dinner menu, a 
ceremony, a sales pitch, a perfume, or a charity campaign.
Unlike art, design always has a purpose. In web design, you always have goals to 
achieve. An e-commerce site should sell stuff. A marketing site should gather leads or 
communicate a message. A web-based application should allow people to carry out 
certain tasks.
Your goals define the problem you need to solve. Design is the process you follow to 
create the best possible solution to that problem. So web design does not start with 
graphics. It starts with understanding the challenge. Who am I communicating with? 

The New Approach ❘ 7
What do they want? How can I attract them? And how can I get them to do what the 
site needs them to do?
note ​What are your web site’s goals?
What is the value of each goal to your organization?
How many goals does the web site need to deliver in order to be a success?
This high-level vision of web design places it in the broader realm of marketing. Mar-
keting is the discipline of defining markets and offerings that deliver what the mar-
kets need in order to achieve a result (which is usually to make a profit).
So a web designer should be a marketer who operates in the web medium. In addi-
tion to the functional tasks involved with creating a web site, the design process must 
include techniques to target markets, to reach out to them, and to lead them from 
wherever they are to the point of taking action. For most web designers, this requires 
a new set of skills.
The new skills I will show you go beyond creating appealing graphic designs and 
beyond search engine optimization. You will learn how you can proactively structure 
your web site to reach more new markets, and to reach deeper into those markets. 
You will discover a step-by-step process that continually builds your web site into a 
conversion machine!
The New Approach
It should be becoming clear that to achieve its goals, your web site needs to do only 
two things:
1.	 It needs to get the right number of the right kind of people to visit it.
2.	 It then needs to get as many of those people as possible to take action.
If a web site does not address the right needs in the right markets, it will not get the 
visitors it needs to succeed. If it fails to appeal to its visitors, and to lead them power-
fully along the path to get what they want, the traffic will not be converted into busi-
ness success.

Success = Traffic × Conversion
If your web site sells peanuts, the number of peanuts you sell is exactly the number of 
visitors that visit your site multiplied by the site’s conversion rate. Clearly, if you have 
no visitors to your site, you can’t sell any peanuts.
If you have a bricks-and-mortar peanut store, it doesn’t matter how great your prod-
uct is, how pleasant your service, and attractive your prices, if your store is hidden in 
a back street where nobody knows about it.
warning ​Zero Traffic × Any Conversion Rate = Zero Success
Likewise, if your conversion rate stinks, any traffic you get will only generate poor 
results. This would be like establishing your peanut store in a great location on a busy 
street, putting up great signs and never opening the doors, then wondering why you 
didn’t sell any peanuts.
warning ​Any Traffic × Zero Conversion Rate = Zero Success
This means that both traffic and conversion rate are critical for success. It is unwise 
to neglect either your traffic or your conversion rate. You can prove this pretty easily. 
A number that’s the result of multiplying two other numbers can be represented by 
a rectangle. The optimal result (greatest area) is achieved when the factors are more 
balanced, as shown in Figure 1-1. So you need to invest effort both in methods that 
increase your targeted traffic and methods that optimize your conversion rate.
Your Major Advantages
Today, you have a number of serious advantages over previous generations. With 
the Internet, it is easier to generate business than at any other time in history. More 
people are doing more online than ever before. And it is cheaper and quicker to reach 
them than ever before.
On the flip side, there is also more competition than ever before, which means the 
greatest rewards will go to the sites that do the best job of attracting and converting 
traffic. You have this book, so the know-how is in your hands, which gives you a com-
petitive advantage.

Direct Response Marketing
The Internet is also the world’s most powerful direct response marketing medium. 
(The pioneer in this area is Ken McCarthy, who has been teaching business owners 
how to use direct response techniques in the new media in his seminars since 1994.) 
Direct response marketing was created in the late nineteenth century, when people 
started marketing directly to householders using mailed product lists. Customers 
could choose and order what they wanted, which could be delivered directly to them 
using the railroads and the new U.S. Postal Service.
Direct response introduced two crucial factors entirely new to marketing:
The marketer communicates 
u
u
directly to the consumer.
The consumer orders 
u
u
direct from the marketer.
Aside from cutting out the distributors and traditional retailers, the reason direct 
response was so successful is that it allowed marketers to do something they could 
never do before: measure the results of every communication.
Unlike branding and advertising, which deliver fuzzy feedback at best, now marketers 
could change the product lines, prices, or descriptions they offered from one week to 
the next—or even at the same time—and learn first-hand how their customers would 
respond.
Test to Find “What Works”
Instead of having to guess what price point would make the most money, or which 
payment option would sell the most seed, the ability to gather data directly from the 

10 ❘ Chapter 1: How to Tr ansform Your Web Site’s Success
market made it possible for these marketers to test and measure the impact of any 
choice (or guess), with lower risk.
Before sending out hundreds of thousands of catalogs to households across the U.S., 
direct marketers could test multiple options on samples of their customer base, and 
change their approach in response to what worked best.
The big difference for you is, what took the early direct marketers weeks to learn, you 
can learn almost instantly. You can set up a new offer, get it seen by people, and test 
the responses, all within a day, and at low cost.
The practice of direct marketing has fueled massive economic growth through the 
twentieth century. You can easily apply the same principles to your online marketing, 
to drive traffic and conversion.
The fundamental principle is to commit to testing different approaches, measuring 
the results, and altering your campaigns in response to what you learn about the 
way that people really respond.
The catch-phrase is “what works?” Very different to “first best guess”!
Combine Creativity and Analysis
The new approach requires a combination of creativity and analysis. In marketing, 
and in web site optimization, just as in the scientific method, both processes are vital 
for making advances.
Creativity is forward-looking, asking “What could we do?” The creative process can 
only generate new future possibilities. It cannot tell you for sure which is best. Analysis 
looks backward and asks “Did that work?” It examines existing options and tells you 
which seems to work best. It cannot show the way to what might work even better.
The new approach to web design also calls you to think creatively about the scope of 
the problem. Challenging the singular approach is a typical example. Take the exam-
ple of selling ice cream from a cart at the beach. If you were to test your market, ask-
ing which flavor people prefer, and discover that half your market likes vanilla best, 
would you stop selling any other flavors? Of course not.
Without sufficient creative exploration, site owners can sometimes go down a similar 
path. If you are stuck in viewing your site in singular terms, you may (quite rationally) 
find better results when your home page focuses on one particular feature over another.
For example, let’s say you offer counseling services, which are useful for business 
professionals and for private clients who want success in some area. If you find that 

The New Approach ❘ 11
the professional market is the more profitable, would you just stop offering your other 
services? No, it would be foolish to turn away good business.
The same goes for your web site. If you were placing a newspaper ad, it might make 
sense to focus on one service, but on the web you can easily create a page to address 
each market. The fact that a few more people respond to one angle than to another 
does not validate or invalidate any approach. The right approach is to reach out to all 
your markets, using multiplicity.
Multiplicity
Whereas the old approach to designing web sites was singular and generic, the key to 
transforming your success lies in multiplicity.
Imagine you go to a cocktail party. During the course of the evening, you meet twelve 
different people who, you discover, could benefit from the services your company 
offers. How many different conversations would you have with those people? Twelve! 
It would be crazy to give each person the same sales pitch, before you understand 
their problems and what their needs are.
Some of the people you speak to may know exactly what they want. Others may only 
have a problem with no idea how best to solve it. One may have heard of your busi-
ness before. Others may not even know your industry exists.
That is how most web sites do business today. You have a singular home page, one 
single page for each product or service, usually a single page of frequently asked ques-
tions, and maybe another one for testimonials. All are woolly and generic, all telling 
the same story over and over.
As I mentioned earlier, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these pages. They 
each have their place, providing one bundle of information to one type of inquirer. If 
that is all you have, one type of inquirer is all you’ll get.
In the old approach to web design, most designers are still making web sites as 
though they are like advertisements or brochures.
In the old approach, we would treat web design as though space is expensive. Space is 
not expensive. It is very cheap. You can make as many pages as you have things to say.
In the old approach, we would design web sites as though they are fixed structures. 
They should not be fixed. They will usually have a fixed core of pages, but they should 
grow and adapt continually.

12 ❘ Chapter 1: How to Tr ansform Your Web Site’s Success
In the old approach, we would use the classic model of client-agency relationship. You 
need a designer to produce your ad or brochure. You brief the designer, he does the 
work, you pay him, and the job is done. This is not the best way to build web sites. A 
web designer who really gets it will help his client create a content strategy, to build 
a platform the client can use to add and update their own content continually, and 
to establish a relationship for ongoing design support. This benefits both client and 
designer.
The new approach does it very differently. Instead of relying on a small number of 
generic pages, you will create a range of specialized landing pages, each one designed 
to be found by specific types of visitors with their own specific needs. Each landing 
page can be an entry point into a different conversation.
All these conversations are arranged into a logical structure, which lead all types 
of inquirers to a selling proposition. And because people arrive at pages that match 
closely what they need, they will be more engaged, will have a higher level of trust, and 
will feel more optimistic about following the path forward that you provide for them.
If you want advice on saving for your child’s college education, are you going to be 
more interested in a page that says “Tax advisor” or one that says “Advice on saving 
for your child’s college education”?
You will see that, in order to follow the multiplicity approach, you will need to pub-
lish more pages. Fortunately, publishing online today is so cheap that cost is almost 
negligible, compared to the results that are available to you. The more you publish, 
the more conversations you can have with more different people, which is the key to 
optimization.
Steps for Optimizing Your Traffic
Put all these techniques and benefits together and you get a new picture of online 
marketing that is fluid and expansive. Instead of getting a web site built and hop-
ing that people will arrive and buy, the new approach is an ongoing discipline that 
constantly looks for new marketing opportunities, creatively explores what the mar-
ket responds to, and builds an ever-expanding network of content that continually 
reaches both wider and deeper to find new customers.

search engine optimization 
Fundamentals
To design your site for good search rankings, it is vital to understand how search 
engines work. In this chapter, you learn the fundamentals of how search engines like 
Google do their job, what they look for, and how to give them what they want.
At the end of the chapter, you will know what your site needs to do in order to rank 
well and to attract more traffi  c. When you combine this knowledge with the other 
methods in Part I, you will be able to boost dramatically the number of visitors to 
your site. You will also start to realize the full power of multiplicity.
When you type a query into Google, it will probably have millions of potential pages 
in its index that match your query. Google’s job is to arrange those millions of pages 
into a single fi le, starting with what it thinks is the best match, followed by the second 
and third best matches, and so on.
How does the search engine work out what is the best match? It basically uses only 
two main criteria:
1. What the page says it’s about.
2. What the rest of the Web says the page is about.
Of these two main criteria, the second has by far the greatest impact on where a page 
ranks in the search engine results pages (SERPs). It probably has ten times the weight 
of the fi rst factor.
Before I explain how these factors are calculated, and how to make use of them, there 
is an initial step to take, which is to fi gure out what terms you want to rank for.

Keyword Research
Keyword research is the exercise you go through to identify attractive target keywords 
for your web pages. These are the terms (single words or phrases) that you want your 
page to appear to be about.
The goal of keyword research is to find terms for each page that balance three impor-
tant criteria:
1.	 High relevance
2.	 High traffic
3.	 Low competition
High Relevance
There is no point attracting people who are looking for something you don’t offer. 
Though it may be possible to identify search terms that could bring a lot of traffic, if 
the traffic does not match the proposition they find on the page, they will go away 
again and cannot be converted into customers.
The starting point for your keyword research is always to identify what each page 
is offering, so that visitors to that page will find what they expect when they click 
the link.
From that starting point, you may consider alternative terms that people may be 
searching for. This is very important, and not as easy as it may sound. You may have 
worked in your own business area for years, and it is likely that you will use particu-
lar terms that may not be the same terms your customers use.
For example, one of our clients teaches rock climbing. They could use the term “learn 
rock climbing” or they could focus their page around “rock climbing course.” Which 
is best? In fact, six times more people are looking for “rock climbing course” than 
“learn rock climbing.”
A quick and easy way to identify terms that people are searching for is to start typing 
some starting-point keywords into the regular Google search field. Google has a fea-
ture called “Suggest,” which shows a menu of related searches as you type. Figure 2-1 

Keyword Research ❘ 17
shows what Google.co.uk tells me people are searching for that includes the words 
“garden furniture.”
Figure 2-1 ​Google’s suggestion feature is a very quick way to 
find alternative terms that people are typing in today.
High Traffic
It is pretty easy to find terms for which you can get to #1 on Google. You could get 
to the top spot for the term “automated translation pixie dust” just by publishing a 
page that features those words, but it wouldn’t bring you any traffic, because nobody’s 
looking for that term.
Before you go to the effort and expense of creating a new landing page, you need to be 
confident that you will get the maximum benefit from that page in terms of visitors. It 
is important that you know the subject the page focuses on is a subject that people are 
searching for.
Google provides their AdWords research Tool, a free tool that will indicate the most 
popular search terms related to keywords you enter (https://adwords.google.co.uk/
select/KeywordToolExternal). Figure 2-2 shows terms around “simple web design,” 
together with an estimated number of monthly searches.

18 ❘ Chapter 2: Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
Figure 2-2 ​Using the Google AdWords Research Tool to discover search volumes for keywords
Low Competition
If you identify target search terms that are relevant to your offering and get a lot of 
searches, you have to take into consideration how much competition there is for that 
term.
I cannot stress enough the importance of getting high up in the search rankings for 
the terms you choose.
Why You Have to Rank High
As a rule of thumb, on average the top search result will typically get about 40% 
of the clicks, the second result will get just over half that number (26%), the third 
around 14%, and so on.

Keyword Research ❘ 19
The result, as shown in Figure 2-3, is that the top ten rankings will get more than 99% 
of the clicks. Being on page two of the search results will give you slim pickings.
What this suggests is that SERP ranking position is absolutely critical. So much so 
that it overrides the popularity of the search term. Unless you can get onto the first 
page of the search engine results, you may be wasting the investment in creating 
the page.
It is a critical aspect of keyword research to try to identify the best terms for which you 
think you can get on page one. Even if those terms get less traffic, it is better to get a 
big slice of a small pie than to get a crumb from a big pie.

Figure 2-3 ​Traffic from search engines is heavily biased toward the top ranking results.
It is easy to imagine that most of your web site’s traffic comes from the terms for 
which you rank highest. That is often not the case. Although the most popular search 
terms can get into very high numbers, they still account for a minority of searches 
carried out.
Most searches on the Web are not for the most popular search terms.

20 ❘ Chapter 2: Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
Figure 2-4 shows the top 20 search terms on our web site from a recent month, in 
order of the number of visits each term brought in. The top term “web 2.0 design” was 
responsible for more than 3,400 visits. And, yes, one of my articles currently tops the 
Google rankings for that search term. But this web site gets hundreds of thousands of 
search visits each month.
Figure 2-4 ​The top 20 search terms for a busy web site may be responsible for only a fraction of the 
site’s search traffic.
Upon analyzing the stats, it turned out that the top 500 search terms for our site 
accounted for less than 45% of the total search traffic. In other words, the majority of 
your traffic will come from “the Long Tail.”
The Long Tail
Figure 2-5 shows the search results from the month’s analysis plotted on a graph. It 
would seem that the thick top end of the graph must be responsible for the majority 

Keyword Research ❘ 21
of the visits, but the reverse is true. Most of the traffic is in the Long Tail. The Long 
Tail is very, very long!
Does this contradict the idea that you should aim to top the rankings for your pre-
ferred search terms? Absolutely not! Think of your top search terms as the bow of 
a boat. It breaks the water and helps bring the Long Tail in its wake. The better you 
rank for its primary terms, the higher your page will rank for any terms on that page.
The real lesson of the Long Tail is the importance of having diverse content on your 
pages. A page should focus on its own target term, but should also include a healthy, 
natural variety of other words. This is what feeds the Long Tail searches.

Finding Alternative Target Search Terms
If you find yourself in a highly competitive market segment, where the top searches 
are responsible for extremely high traffic levels, consider what may be typed into the 
search engines.
This lateral thinking is the key skill in keyword research. If you find that the search 
market for “New York City lawyers” is sewn up, what other terms may folks be 
searching for? Public defenders? Divorce attorneys? Personal injury specialists? Spend 

22 ❘ Chapter 2: Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
a few minutes browsing the Web for your initial target terms to discover a range of 
different terms that people are using. In this case, “New York lawyers” might get you 
five times the traffic of “New York City lawyers” if you could top the Google rank-
ings, but there is more than ten times the competition, making the less popular term 
a more realistic option.
Do not make the mistake of thinking that every potential customer has the same lan-
guage skills that you have. Particularly in competitive search segments, it can prove 
valuable to deliberately target misspelled or mistyped words.
Most web pages are carefully prepared and are likely to be spell-checked, so you may 
find that few competitors would leave misspellings on their pages. However, most 
search queries are entered quickly, so they can frequently contain “mispelings.” Fig-
ure 2-6 shows the results for pages that compete on the term “New York lawyers.” The 
syntax “allintitle:+new +york +lawyers” shows all pages in the Google index that have 
all three words in the page title (which is a very good indicator of strong relevance). 
There are 177,000 results, which means it would be very difficult (or very expensive) 
to get near the top of the rankings for this term.
Figure 2-6 ​Using “allintitle:” syntax in Google to estimate search competition
Figure 2-7 shows the results of a similar search for a simple typo: “New York layers” 
returns just 1,990 competing results. It would be much easier to get on page one for 
this term. (Notice that the sponsored ads are all for New York lawyers!) Of course, 
that would mean having to put misspelled words on your web page, which may not be 
appropriate (especially in a law firm).

Keyword Research ❘ 23
Figure 2-7 ​A simple typo could reveal a viable niche in competitive search markets.
Using Keyword Research Tools
Clearly, it would be useful to combine your research for relevance, traffic, and compe-
tition in a single interface. Several good solutions are on the market that will save you 
hours of time. I mentioned the AdWords Research Tool earlier, which is free. I will 
briefly introduce two other good tools that we use in our SEO work.
Market Samurai
Market Samurai (www.marketsamurai.com/) is a desktop application that combines a 
range of useful SEO and marketing tools. Its keyword research module, shown in 
Figure 2-8, is excellent. It combines data from a number of sources to give you useful 
insight into potential target niches.
Here, I have entered a range of search terms, to compare the appeal of the “New York 
layers” niche. I will explain what some of the columns show:
“Searches” estimates the number of daily searches for the term (either globally 
u
u
or for a geographical range you specify).
“SEOT” is an estimate of the number of clicks per day you could expect 
u
u
for placing at #1 on Google for the term (that is, around 40% of the daily 
searches).
“SEOC” shows how many pages on the Web contain the words (equivalent to 
u
u
typing the term into Google and seeing how many results are returned).

24 ❘ Chapter 2: Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
“SEOTC” is a measure of how many pages use the term in their title tag (that 
u
u
is, which are focused on the term). This is a good indicator of the strength of 
competition.
“SEOTCR” is a calculation that compares the popularity of a term on the Web 
u
u
to the number of pages that feature the term in their titles. A lower percentage 
score may suggest low competition.
These results, unsurprisingly, show that “New York lawyer” and “New York lawyers” 
are competitive terms, with around 200,000 competing pages (SEOT). They also get a 
good number of searches. You would need to invest heavily to get to the top of the list 
on these terms.
“New York layer” and “New York layers” get far fewer searches, only 33 and 16 per 
day, respectively. However, there is far less competition, so it would be far more fea-
sible to get onto page one for these terms, even taking into account that some of those 
searches are not looking for lawyers.
In this situation, I would consider the typo route, but would also explore a range of 
more specific search terms.

WordTracker
WordTracker (www.wordtracker.com) takes a different approach to keyword research. 
It is an online application, so you can log in from anywhere.
Figure 2-9 shows some results from WordTracker. I have entered a starting search of 
“redesign web site,” and WordTracker has returned a long list of results (part of which 
is shown). Like Market Samurai, it shows “Searches,” but also features “In Anchor 
And Title,” which is a strong indicator of competitiveness. This gives the number of 
pages that have the phrase in their titles and also have links pointing to the pages that 
include the same phrase.
WordTracker has its own calculations for predicting the competitive attractiveness 
of keywords, called “KEI” and “KEI3.” One thing I like about WordTracker is that I 
can click any words that look interesting and browse around to find interesting target 
search terms.
Figure 2-9 ​WordTracker’s keyword research results

26 ❘ Chapter 2: Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
These are just two of the keyword research tools on the market. Both tools will sug-
gest alternative words based on your initial suggestions, to help you find terms that 
may perform better but that were not obvious to you.
The two tools each get their data from a different combination of sources and present 
their results differently. I suggest trying both to find which suits you best.
Once you have identified a target search term for a page, you should ensure that page 
appears to be strongly about that term. The first step is to make sure the content of the 
page itself tells the search engines that the main subject matter of the page is the term 
you have selected.
On-Page SEO
Search engines are getting smarter all the time, but they are still not very smart. A 
search engine spider does not assign meaning to visual factors, such as layout, color, 
typefaces, and the content of images. It must use computation to figure out what each 
page is about.
To view a page in the way a search engine does, look at its source HTML code. This 
removes all visual meaning, and leaves the page’s content in its raw form.
The factors search engines use to evaluate the subject focus of a page are:
Keyword density
u
u
The placement of keywords on the page
u
u
note ​Different search engines have their own logic for evaluating the various factors, 
so it is possible to optimize a page for one search engine or another.
Keyword Density
Keyword density simply means how often a particular word or phrase occurs in the 
content of a page. If your page has a thousand words, and your target term makes up 
forty of those words, the keyword density of that term will be 4%.

On-Page SEO ❘ 27
If you want your page to rank for a certain term, that term should occur with a den-
sity that is neither too low nor too high.
Clearly, a page that does not mention a term very much will not seem to be about that 
term, so it cannot compete. On the other hand, a page that has one term taking up 
half of the words on the page will have a very high density. But that page would be 
viewed as artificially stuffed with the keyword, which is unnatural and unlikely to be 
readable or useful. Search engines like to see a natural balance of language.
As a general guide, Google will tolerate a keyword density of between 2% and 4%. 
Other search engines such as Yahoo and Bing may accept higher densities, so bear 
this in mind when you are optimizing your pages.
A handy free tool for testing keyword density is the Keyword Density Checker 
(­keydensity.com/keyword-density-checker-calculator). Figure 2-10 shows the tool  
in action. Here, I have asked it to look at the home page of my ebook site (www­
.savethepixel.org) and fetch the density of a target search term “web design ebook.” 
The results show the phrase appears only once in the page contents, which is not 
going to help the page get to the top of the search engines.
Figure 2-10 ​The low keyword density of only 0.03% may help explain why this page ranks at only 
­position 13 for the term “web design ebook.”

28 ❘ Chapter 2: Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
Placement of Keywords
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the tagging language that gives a web page its 
structure. HTML tags identify structural elements, some of which assign meaning to 
their contents.
Where search engines are concerned, some HTML tags give more relevance to the 
subject focus of a page’s contents.
Title Tag
The <title> tag is probably the most important tag for identifying a page’s subject 
focus. Every page should have one title tag. This belongs in the <head> section of the 
page, which means it is not part of the visible content on the page.
The contents of the title tag are displayed in the window or tab of the page, in the 
browser’s back/forward navigation menus, and in the bookmark when the page is 
saved.
Keyword density and length are relevant to your page titles. Keep to natural language 
and do not repeat keywords too often. Google only recognizes about the first sixty 
characters of a title tag, whereas Yahoo may read the first hundred and twenty char-
acters (also useful when optimizing a page for a particular search engine).
URL
The contents of the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) are also important for search 
relevance. If your keywords appear in your site’s domain name, in the directory path 
to the page, or in the page’s filename, they will add useful relevance. It is always bet-
ter to use real words in the URL, which may be separated by hyphen or underscore 
characters.
Heading 1 Tag
Every web page should feature one <h1>, or main heading tag. This is the primary 
on-page tag that tells the visitor what the whole page is about. In an article, the main 
heading is the title of the article. Ensure your <h1> tag contains your target keywords 
where possible, but keep it meaningful, interesting, and only as long as it needs to be.
Minor Heading Tags
Your web pages may feature several minor headings, typically <h2> and <h3>. These 
tags describe the contents of a subsection of the page, so they give relevance but are 

Off-Page SEO ❘ 29
less important than the main <h1> tag. It is advisable to repeat your target search 
terms, or variations on those terms, in your minor tags, but always keep them read-
able and useful.
Body Content
As mentioned, the rest of your page content should feature keywords in a natural 
proportion. However, content that is higher up the page (in the HTML source) will 
be viewed as introductory, which means it is more likely to describe what the page is 
about. Relevance decreases the farther down the page you go.
The alt (alternative text) and longdesc properties of images also carry relevance. Treat 
these like you would other body text. They also describe the subject matter of images 
to search engine spiders and screen readers (which translate the contents of web pages 
to audio so they can be understood by people with vision impairment).
Meta Content
Meta tags are tags which, like the <title> tag, belong in the <head> section of the page, 
so are not displayed on the web page itself. They are used to describe properties of the 
page to other user agents (that is, not browsers, but search engines and so on).
The most common meta tags are the keywords and description tags. Google does not 
seem to assign relevance to the contents of these tags, but some other search engines 
do, and may use the meta description in the search result listings themselves, so 
ensure your meta description gives an accurate description of what’s on the page.
When you have optimized your web pages to feature your target search terms in rea-
sonable proportions wherever possible, you should see them feature higher in search 
rankings. However, as I mentioned earlier, on-page SEO plays a relatively small part 
in the overall ranking calculation (particularly for Google).
To get really competitive, a web page must be validated by the rest of the Web, which 
is where off-page SEO comes into play.
Off-Page SEO
In 2006, I wrote an article on my tutorials site that described the current style in web 
design at the time. It highlighted the main design features that were prevalent, and 
explained why they worked.

30 ❘ Chapter 2: Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
The page was a huge success, generating a significant amount of additional traffic. 
Looking at the analytics logs, I noticed a high proportion of visitors were coming to 
the site from web searches for the phrase “web 2.0 design.” (Figure 2-4 shows that this 
phrase still brings the most visitors to the web site.)
When I tried a Google search for the phrase, my “Current Style” article ranked in the 
top spot, and it has remained up there ever since (more recently pushed into second 
place by another article I wrote with the title “Web2.0 Design How-To Style Guide”).
What is most interesting about this story is that the “Current Style” article did not 
mention the phrase “Web2.0 design” in its content! So why did the page get to #1 on 
Google? The answer lies in the power of inbound links.
The Power of Inbound Links
Inbound links are simply links to your web page from other pages. In the early 1990s, 
search engines used only on-page factors to judge what pages were about. The pages 
that mentioned terms most frequently were viewed as more relevant to the term. At 
that time, it was quite easy to game the search engines by stuffing keywords into the 
page content and into meta tags.
Then Google came along and changed the game. Google took a novel approach to 
calculating relevance. It recognized on-page factors, but it introduced the concept of 
inbound links from other pages. These links are seen as votes for the linked-to page. 
And the content of the link, such as “Check out this great guide to Web2.0 design,” 
provided the context of the vote.
Google’s approach immediately delivered better results than the other search engines, 
and established Google as the world’s favorite search engine. Today, all the search 
engines use similar tactics.
Today, to get a high ranking, you need the subject focus of your page to be validated 
by the rest of the Web. As my “Current Style” article story proves, on-page factors 
play only a marginal role in search success. If the rest of the world says that your page 
is about a certain topic, that’s good enough for Google and the other engines.
How do you get your pages to rank well when you do not control the factors directly? 
First, I need to describe the mechanics of how Google might use these factors to 
establish relevance.

Off-Page SEO ❘ 31
How Google Calculates Inbound Link Value
I will describe the general method Google uses to establish which page is most rele-
vant for a given term. The exact workings of any search engine’s algorithm are closely 
guarded secrets, but we know the principles at work.
Three main factors are involved:
1.	 Number of inbound links
2.	 Relevance of linking pages
3.	 Link juice
Number of Inbound Links
When considering how search engines work, a useful phrase to start with is, “All 
other things being equal...”
All other things being equal, a page with more links from the rest of the Web will be 
viewed as more popular, and more relevant, than a page with fewer inbound links. 
That said, the value of any inbound link can vary enormously.
Relevance of Linking Pages
All other things being equal, a link to a page about web design from another page 
about web design will be more relevant than a link from a page on a different subject. 
Because search engine spiders evaluate the subject matter of all the pages they visit, 
they can figure out how closely the subjects relate. Links from related pages are far 
more valuable than any links from unrelated pages.
Link Juice
For Google, the most significant of the three factors is the amount of link juice a link-
ing page gives to the linked-to page.
warning ​The information in the following paragraphs almost certainly does not 
accurately describe how Google actually works. It is based on assumptions, and is for 
general illustration only.

32 ❘ Chapter 2: Search Engine Optimization Fundamentals
Google gives every page on the page a PageRank (PR) value. This is a general indicator 
of the importance of that page on the Web. The more inbound links a page has, the 
higher its PageRank is likely to be.
PageRank is a number between zero and ten, with ten being the highest. But it is not 
a linear scale. A PR5 page is far more important than a PR4 page, which is far more 
important than a PR3 page. (Let’s assume that an increase of one PR point is equiva-
lent to a fifty-fold increase in importance. So a PR5 page will be 2,500 times as impor-
tant as a PR3 page, and so on.)
Generally speaking, when a page links out to another page, the link juice is a factor 
of the PR value of the linking page, which is divided between all the outbound links 
from that page.
If the link is described as “nofollow” in the HTML markup (which indicates to the 
search engines that the link is not viewed as important by the linking page), the PR 
value is not carried over.
What all this means is that it is far more valuable to get inbound links from pages 
with higher PageRank than lower PageRank. Links from pages that are both rel-
evant and have high PageRank have by far the greatest impact on establishing search 
relevance.
To sum up, the inbound link value for a certain term might be understood as: the 
sum of (PageRank value multiplied by relevance) for all inbound links.
Internal Links
Links that come from other pages on your own site do provide value. You can use this 
to your advantage. For example, let’s say you want one particular page to rank highly 
for a certain target search term. If you use that search term on every page on your 
site, each time linking back to the page you want to promote, these internal links can 
help boost the relevance of that page.
In this example, all the pages on a site are working together to boost the rankings of 
one particular page for one term. You can’t use a lot of major phrases in this way, so it 
is important to choose one that is more contested than your individual target phrases, 
that is relevant across every page on your site, and for which you still stand a chance 
of getting to the top of the rankings.
If the competition on a particular term is moderate, you may even be able to domi-
nate the search market, if you have enough pages. For example, if there are 2,000 
pages that mention your target phrase in their titles (which the “allintitle:” search 

Off-Page SEO ❘ 33
syntax on Google will tell you), if you put the term in the title tags of 20 pages or blog 
posts on your site, you would immediately own 1% of the pages that compete on that 
term. Link all those pages to one page that focuses on that term and you could find 
that term quickly moving to the top of the rankings.
A common approach, which suits many medium-sized or large sites, is to group your 
pages into thematic sections, known as silos, with all the pages in each silo supporting 
one particular search term.
The objective of off-page SEO is to get as many relevant and important pages as pos-
sible to link to your page. I will describe two approaches: link-building and what I call 
“ultimate SEO.”
Link-Building
Link-building is the practice of actively trying to get other sites to link to yours. Tac-
tics include:
Contacting the owners of other pages and asking them for a link.
u
u
Offering the owners of other pages a link, in return for a reciprocal link back 
u
u
to their page.
Manually creating other pages yourself, on a similar topic, and placing a link 
u
u
to your own page from those pages.
Adding comments to articles or blog posts on other sites, which contain links 
u
u
back to your page.
Posting messages on social networks (like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Digg, 
u
u
del.icio.us, Reddit, and so on) with backlinks to your page.
Submitting articles to other sites, which contain backlinks.
u
u
You will notice that the factor all these methods have in common is that they are 
time-consuming! You can actually get a web page to start ranking (particularly in 
an uncompetitive sector) using a bit of manual link-building, but to get to the top of 
the results for even a moderately competitive search phrase would take a significant 
amount of effort.
Many site owners outsource their link-building to specialist companies, often based 
in countries like India or the Philippines, where labor costs are lower. This can pro-
duce results, but is still far more expensive than my preferred method.

Ultimate SEO
For me, the best form of SEO is—no SEO at all!
The overriding goal of search engine design is to distinguish between sites that are 
naturally liked by the rest of the Web and those that are artificially promoted to look 
as though they are liked. Teams of very clever people are working right now on find-
ing ways to make it harder for you and me to game the system.
The ideal approach is to play the game the way the search engines want you to play. 
That is, to make better content, which the rest of the Web really does see as valuable, 
and wants to link to.
I learned this lesson with my online articles and tutorials, which I just wrote and 
posted online. Before I knew it, my content had thousands of daily visitors. Of course, 
the world still needs to find out about your content, so some promotion will always be 
necessary.
Thinking from the journalistic perspective, people want to read content that is valu-
able, interesting, and original. People writing on blogs and social media are more 
likely to link to stories that have a clear and original theme than pages that offer a 
generic treatment of a subject.
Pages don’t have to be long. In fact, a good blog post or news story could be just a few 
paragraphs.
If your web site relies on one main page to describe your offerings, there will be a 
strong tendency to play safe, which will result in a page much like competitors’ pages, 
and which is unlikely to be original or noteworthy. However, when you commit to 
creating a range of pages that deal with various specific subjects, you can make each 
one short, punchy, unique, and genuinely valuable: all useful factors for making good 
link bait.
At its highest level, then, SEO actually becomes PR. If you create content that is genu-
inely newsworthy, interesting, and valuable, your only task is to get the word out. I 
did this when I redesigned my tutorials site by searching for “web design blog” on 
Google, and personally e‑mailing the top 20 web design bloggers, simply asking them 
to check out my site and tell me what they thought. Enough of them posted links to 
the new site to cause a ripple that’s still rippling today.
It may seem that the Web is flooded with content. It is. However, the more noise there 
is, the more important it is for people to find trustworthy channels that can help them 
filter out what’s really relevant. Where we used to go to the mass media for our news, 

Off-Page SEO ❘ 35
more web sites are offering this kind of service than ever before. And their owners are 
desperate for news. They love to be the first to find out something interesting and to 
post it for their readers.
I could tell you about hundreds of SEO tricks, but any of them could stop working 
tomorrow, resulting in your site suddenly losing ranking, or—worse—getting banned 
by Google altogether!
For me, ultimate SEO comes down to creating content that has value. This requires a 
different set of skills. It requires insight into marketing and psychology, and the abil-
ity to create story value from the raw materials you have in front of you. To win at the 
traffic game, to get the greatest number of visitors to your site, you just need to think 
like a marketer and a journalist.
If you don’t think you have these skills, don’t worry. Most of your competitors don’t 
either. In the next three chapters, I give you ways to visualize and to create new chan-
nels that will funnel more people to your content than you may now think possible.


expanding your reach
Th is chapter expands on the concept of multiplicity, and shows how it should be the 
central principle of your online marketing strategy. I take you through a few simple 
steps to start widening the scope of your web presence.
Marketing is the process of defi ning markets and matching them to solutions. Th e 
better the match, the greater the demand for the solution, and the easier it is to make 
money.
What are You really Selling?
Do you sell your products and services? No. What people buy from you are solutions 
to their needs. Your products and services themselves are not the solutions—they are 
a means to an end. Whatever people buy, they are not really buying the thing. Th ey 
are buying some benefi t that the thing gives them.
A man who goes into a hardware store to buy a quarter-inch drill bit does not need a 
quarter-inch drill bit—he needs a quarter-inch hole.
Unknown source
All you sell is solutions to needs. Th is is the fi rst step to unlocking more selling oppor-
tunities. When you focus on the solutions that you sell, instead of on the products 
and services that deliver them, you take a big step closer to your prospects.
If your web site talks about your products, what queries will the search engines match 
it to? People looking for the subject matter of the page—in other words, your products!
If you have a product that a lot of people want and which your keyword research 
reveals a lot of people are searching for, you may expect good results from that mar-
ket. But most web sites do not off er specifi c products like that. Most web sites are 
trying to market or sell things to people who don’t yet know the exact solution they 
ChaPter 3

38 ❘ Chapter 3: Expanding Your Reach
need. They may not be ready to choose, or to hand over money. They are thinking 
about their problem and how to solve it.
If someone is looking online for a solution to a problem, the way to draw them to 
your web site is to address them using the same language. It is language that search 
engines use to match queries to content. And your site will engage visitors more effec-
tively if they see their present thoughts addressed on the page in front of them.
Researching Your Markets
Every problem that every one of your products or services could solve is a potential 
market. The ultimate question is whether you can make a profit selling to that market. 
Eugene Schwartz, one of the twentieth century’s great copywriters, puts it succinctly:
It is the moment when a private desire is shared by a statistically significant number of 
people large enough to profitably repay selling these people, that a market is born.
Eugene M. Schwartz, Breakthrough Advertising
Of course, you have an advantage over Eugene Schwartz. You are marketing online, 
whereas he sold his products by mail order. Whereas he wrote only one ad for each 
product he sold, you can create as many web pages as you like. And unlike printed 
ads, you can easily and quickly improve or remove web pages that don’t perform.
The first step in identifying new markets, then, is to list the possible problems or 
needs that your product or service could solve. Then, you research the size of all mar-
kets so that you can prioritize your marketing activities.
What Problems Do You Solve?
Let’s go back a few years and say your product is a sharpened flint hand tool. This tool 
has no intrinsic value. All its value comes from what it enables people to do. Here are 
just a few problems that your tool may solve:
How to carve meat from a kill more quickly
u
u
How to sharpen sticks (for weapons or cooking)
u
u
How to scrape hides quickly and cleanly
u
u
How to improve your chances in a hand-to-hand fight
u
u

Researching Your Markets ❘ 39
You can see that several different groups are already here. Both males and females 
carrying out various roles could all benefit from your product.
What attracts them is not the product itself, but how it helps them solve a need. They 
get more meat for their family. They get to make weapons and cooking sticks with less 
effort, which means they get more rest. They get a better quality of hide, also with less 
work. And they get to improve their survival options in a conflict. These are all valu-
able benefits.
note ​Do the same exercise for your own products or services. Instead of looking at 
the tool, describe how it solves a need or problem for the person who buys it. List as 
many problems as you can, and state the solution to each problem.
A great place to start looking for insight into the needs your products actually solve 
is just to ask your existing customers. People like to tell their own stories, so ask them 
what their concerns, priorities, and needs were when they were looking at the market. 
Ask them what other benefits they have discovered. The answers to these questions 
may highlight new needs that you were not previously aware of. You can also ask your 
own sales and customer service people for their stories from the front line.
Flip Products to Propositions
People don’t buy products; they buy solutions to their needs. These needs may be 
functional (enabling you to do something you could not do before), time-saving, 
money-saving, or emotional (such as the need to look good, to belong, or to feel 
secure). It is our needs that motivate us to buy.
Each of your products may address multiple needs. However, there is a gap between 
the needs and the product. You need to bridge that gap and connect each need with 
the solution you offer.
What bridges the gap is a proposition. It is the way you present a solution to a pros-
pect’s need: “This is how this thing will give you what you need.”
Nobody buys a flint hand tool. They buy a “how you can carve more meat in less time 
before the wolves show up,” or a “how you can make better hides to help your family 
get through the winter.” These are propositions.
There may be many solutions to any given problem. The solutions may be equally 
good. It is the best proposition that wins the day.

40 ❘ Chapter 3: Expanding Your Reach
Let go of the idea that you sell products, and flip it to “I sell propositions.” Your prod-
ucts and services have no value in themselves. People do not care about them. They 
only care about their problem at hand. It is your job to present propositions that show 
how your products solve the problems.
Flip Features to Benefits
If the only thing we ever buy is benefits to us, why does so much marketing still talk 
about features? Here’s the distinction:
A feature is what something does.
u
u
A benefit is what it does for me.
u
u
No one ever bought a feature. No one would pay for a lighter or sharper hand tool. 
They bought what the lightness or sharpness means to them. Either they can carry 
one with them wherever they go, or do their work quicker, or just have the social sta-
tus that comes with having the latest “gadget.”
Behind every product are multiple propositions. Behind every feature are multiple 
benefits. That’s one reason why the long tail is where the action is. Because any prod-
uct can solve many needs, the people who need what the product can do for them will 
be searching for many different things. They are searching for the potential benefits to 
them, in their own context, and those benefits cover a much wider range.
To attract the largest possible audience, you need web pages that are about the things 
that people are looking for right now. Each page can capture people looking for a spe-
cific benefit, and present a proposition that shows each group how the features of your 
products or services fulfill their need.
This will already seem like a daunting amount of work, but these pages do not need 
to be made today (that’s the old approach). They can be developed over time, and they 
do not have to do a complete selling job. They only have to catch the attention of a 
certain type of visitor. The following two chapters give you a method for arranging all 
your landing pages into a logical structure that will give you the maximum market-
ing reach for the minimum possible effort.
Flip “Us” to “You”
Here is some news, which may be surprising: Your customers are not interested in 
you, in your company, in what you do, or even in your products.

Researching Your Markets ❘ 41
Your customers (and prospects) are only interested in one thing:
“What’s in it for me?”
Every proposition you offer is nothing more than a way of translating your features 
into their benefits. If everyone is really only interested in themselves, we should 
endeavor to present our propositions in a way that makes sense from their perspective, 
not from our own.
Most web sites built with the old approach today come from the internal perspec-
tive. This is like the view from the inside of the store looking out. But your potential 
customers are outside looking in. They have an external perspective of your business, 
which may be totally different.
From our internal perspective, we are interested in the features of our products and 
our competitors’ products. That will come through in our communication.
From the external perspective, prospects are interested in benefits to them. They just 
want confidence that they can find a solution to their needs.
From our internal perspective, we use the language of our own industry, vocabulary 
that everyone understands inside the office. When we use this language on the Web 
we wonder why our site does not attract more visitors.
From the external perspective, your prospects use their own language to describe 
what they want. This language may be incorrect (to someone on the inside), but it is 
the language being typed into Google right now by someone who wants what you can 
deliver.
One of our customers provides good quality, low-cost web hosting. Their keyword 
research revealed some fascinating results:
The term “low cost web hosting” could deliver 250 daily visitors for a #1 place-
u
u
ment, but the title competition is over 27,000.
An alternative “Affordable web hosting” is worse, with good potential traffic 
u
u
around 1,000 per day, but almost half a million competing pages.
Compare “cheap web hosting package,” which could deliver 200 daily visitors, 
u
u
but has under 2,000 competing pages.
Very few hosting providers want to identify themselves as “cheap,” yet that’s what peo-
ple are looking for. The internal perspective is “low cost,” but the language being used 
outside in the real world is “cheap.” I would expect that a good proportion of the pages 
that mention “cheap web hosting package” are not competing providers but people 

42 ❘ Chapter 3: Expanding Your Reach
discussing recommendations. Good opportunities exist for providers who are willing 
to let go of their self-image and to use the language of the external perspective.
Anywhere we talk about us, we are missing an opportunity to address our prospect’s 
needs directly. This is why legendary copywriter Drayton Bird advises using three 
times more space talking to your visitor about them than talking about yourself.
Each of the needs you have identified could be a market that you can address with 
the solutions your products offer. The next step is to evaluate each market to estimate 
which are the most attractive.
If you express the needs in terms of “how do I?” or “how to,” these can give you start-
ing points for keyword research. Throw a range of variations on these terms into your 
keyword research software and see how many people are typing in queries relating to 
the theme.
To help broaden your search, I would recommend typing the starting phrases into a 
search engine and browsing the first few pages. When searching on problems, you are 
likely to find forum discussions. Look for alternative phrases that people are using to 
describe their real needs. Try pasting those terms into your keyword research tool, 
and keep thinking laterally until you are confident you have a good idea of the size 
and competitiveness of the market.
To show how you can expand the markets your web site addresses, I will present a 
fictional worked example, which I’ll use throughout the book.
Marketing Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro
Joe is our fictional web marketer. His product is a treatment for male pattern baldness 
called “Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro.”
Joe’s current web site (shown in Figure 3-1) has a simple structure that is typical of the 
“first best guess” method:
His home page tells visitors about his product, talks about how it came about, 
u
u
and invites you to purchase a bottle.
He has a page of frequently asked questions.
u
u
A “Buy it now” page allows you to buy the product.
u
u
He has a contact page where prospects or customers can get support or submit 
u
u
queries.

Marketing Joe’s Mir acle Hair-Gro ❘ 43
Figure 3-1 ​The Joe’s Miracle Hair Gro home page communicates some useful points, but does not get 
results.
Joe’s web site does not perform well. Nobody is searching online for “Joe’s Miracle 
Hair-Gro.” He presents all the features of his product, like the fact that one tub of the 
cream will give you 20 applications, and that it contains natural plant extracts, but 
nothing seems to bring him more traffic.
Joe’s product is not a known brand, so nobody is looking for it by name. If he focuses 
his site’s keywords around “Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro,” those words will be of no use to 
him. Although the features of his product may be interesting to some, are they what 
people are actually looking for? Do people need “natural plant extracts” or “20 applica-
tions from a bottle”?

44 ❘ Chapter 3: Expanding Your Reach
Joe needs to stop talking about what his product is, and focus his language on “what 
it does for you.” Let’s flip Joe’s marketing to the external perspective, using real data, 
and see what’s possible.
The general problem area that Joe addresses is wanting hair where you don’t have 
hair. Let’s look at the keyword research landscape to see what other problems Joe’s 
product may address—or other terms people might use to describe their problems.
Joe’s Keyword Research
I started by entering “hair loss treatment” into Market Samurai and clicked the 
“Generate Keywords” feature, which uses the Google Synonym Tool to find related 
search terms. I then exported the results into a spreadsheet so that I could manipu-
late the data.
I created my own column that shows the SEO Traffic (how many visits you could get 
at #1) divided by the Title Competition (a good indicator of how many pages you have 
to beat to get there). Figure 3-2 shows the results ordered by that figure.
My starting phrase “hair loss treatment” is near the top of the list, and it gets a lot of 
traffic, but 36,700 competing pages would be a tall order for Joe’s small budget. What 
I’m looking for are terms that are relevant to Joe’s product and which have fewer than 
1,000 competing pages.
I have highlighted some likely looking target phrases. There are a few surprises in  
this list:
Interestingly, the typo “hair thining” seems to be quite common. With only 
u
u
409 competing pages, it could still help bring a hundred daily visitors.
“Hairloss” (one word) is another surprising option, with two entries in the top 
u
u
ten.
Another surprise is the profile of terms about hair loss in women. About half 
u
u
of the most attractive target phrases mention “women” or “female.” Joe should 
certainly take that market seriously.
The fifth result in this list is “reasons for hair loss,” which is a fairly popular 
u
u
topic that is not hotly contested. Clearly, anyone searching for this phrase 
has a concern about hair loss, and could be in the market for a restorative 
treatment.

Marketing Joe’s Mir acle Hair-Gro ❘ 45
Figure 3-2 ​Keyword research results for Joe’s hair loss campaign
Choosing Joe’s Target Keywords
What benefits might Joe notice in this list, which he can promote in place of the gen-
eral features of his product? Although Joe currently promotes his product as a treat-
ment for male pattern baldness, the phrase “pattern baldness” does not appear until 

46 ❘ Chapter 3: Expanding Your Reach
the 33rd item in the list, and only then in the context “female pattern baldness”! In 
fact, the words “bald,” “baldness,” and “balding” occur only ten times in 177 results.
It seems that people take an interest earlier in the process, going online to find solu-
tions to combat hair thinning, or to promote hair growth. This insight alone, from 
only a few minutes’ work, could transform the fortunes of Joe’s web site.
The outcome of flipping Joe’s perspective is that he realizes he can market his existing 
product as the solution to a range of problems. Instead of being exclusively a “male 
pattern baldness treatment,” his Hair-Gro can now help with “hair thining,” “hair-
loss,” and “women hair loss,” among others.
In Joe’s case, I might consider “hair growth products” as the main term to focus his 
site around, with 595 daily searches and 3,450 competing pages, in preference to “hair 
loss treatment” that has ten times the competition. The term “hair loss products,” by 
contrast, would bring Joe only 835 visits per day, if he could beat 228,000 other pages 
to the top spot!
Joe can start to target certain markets, identify appealing keywords for each one, and 
create pages that really focus on those terms. These multiple landing pages will ben-
efit Joe in several ways. This is putting multiplicity to work.
More Clicks
If Joe can top the search results for just a few of his chosen phrases, the traffic to his 
web site will multiply. To get to the top, his pages need to be seen as about the phrase 
in question. The best way to do that is to have a separate page focused on each phrase, 
and to generate inbound links from other related pages.
Because the top-ranked search results get the lion’s share of clicks, it is better to get 
twenty results onto page one for less popular terms than to get one result onto page 
ten for a popular term.
Though it’s true that the high-profile generic keywords get the most searches and 
clicks overall, that is the wrong comparison. In fact, as we’ve seen, the long tail gets 
far more traffic. There are more searches for specific phrases than for general terms.
Stronger On-Page Relevance
The more specific a page, the easier it is to maintain a high keyword density. If Joe 
creates a page on “female hair loss products,” he can easily achieve a 2% keyword den-
sity and keep the content readable.

Marketing Joe’s Mir acle Hair-Gro ❘ 47
However, to make a useful page on a more generic subject like “baldness,” Joe would 
need to cover a range of causes and impacts, which will naturally dilute the keyword 
density and focus of the page.
Stronger Link Relevance
If Joe publishes a page on “hair loss” he is up against almost seven million other pages 
that mention the term in their title tags. Because it is a general topic area, any page 
that talks about hair loss will talk about a range of related issues, so its subject matter 
focus will be diluted among those issues.
However, if Joe writes a page around the phrase “hairloss women,” he is competing 
against 400 other pages. Plus, he can look through the 900 pages that are on the same 
subject—and that use the same quirky spelling—for highly relevant inbound links. 
He will not need many to get to the #1 position.
Because of the tendency for a page on a more specific topic to have higher on-page 
relevance, a link from “hairloss women” to “hairloss women” is also likely to be more 
relevant than a link from “hair loss” to “hair loss.”
More Relevant to the Problem
Joe’s keyword research shows that 178 people every day search for the exact phrase 
“reasons for hair loss.” Only 664 pages exist with all those words in their titles, which 
makes it an attractive market for Joe.
If someone searches for “reasons for hair loss,” and happens to arrive at Joe’s page 
that has the title “Reasons For Hair Loss Explained” and which goes on to list all the 
major reasons, he or she is likely to be instantly engaged. A page that talks about the 
general issue of hair loss is less likely to hook the visitor’s attention straight away.
Joe now has a distinct advantage. Because he knows that this visitor is concerned 
right now with “hair loss,” as opposed to “balding,” “alopecia,” or “thinning,” he can 
use that language in his proposition.
He can present Miracle Hair-Gro as a product that not only treats “hair loss,” but 
that specifically addresses its major causes, which will be a perfect fit to the prospect’s 
present need and language.
The next chapter describes how Joe can take all these groups of visitors, address all 
their various needs directly, and lead them through to take action, all using a simple, 
efficient, and logical process.


using the awareness ladder
In the previous chapter, you widened the reach of your web site by fl ipping your prod-
ucts and services into multiple propositions, which speak directly to people’s needs.
In this chapter you go deeper into each market, to address your target markets at 
more levels. I introduce you to the Awareness Ladder, another powerful technique 
that lets you create even more entry points for each of your propositions. Th e Aware-
ness Ladder is a simple model that can help you pitch every page on your web site at 
its target audience with precision.
Figure 4-1 shows how, in the old model, we expect visitors to arrive from the Internet 
through the front door. We spend a lot of time trying to balance all our messages into 
a home page (H). We create navigation that leads visitors from the home page to the 
product or service they require (p/s), and then we hope to get them to take action ($).

The problem with this structure is that most people don’t arrive via the front door. 
Most traffic comes through the Long Tail. (Of course, if you don’t have much content 
on your site, the Long Tail may not be very long.)
When you flip your perspective, instead of expecting a generic home page to channel 
visitors to your products and services, you can create offerings (O) that expand your 
reach to target more different needs with greater precision, producing a model more 
like the one illustrated in Figure 4-2.

to your products and services.
Yet this is only the beginning of your true reach.
Joe’s old web site claimed, “Do you suffer from baldness? Buy my Miracle Hair-Gro 
and get a full head of hair in weeks!” At first sight, that may seem to address the needs 
of his market. And, in a way, it does. But it is only addressing part of his market—the 
segment that is actively looking for a solution to a conscious need.
What other groups could be out there who may benefit from Joe’s solution, but who 
are not looking for it? More segments within Joe’s potential market could be reached 
by extending his proposition to people at multiple levels of awareness.

Your Key to Reaching Deeper Markets ❘ 51
Your Key to Reaching Deeper Markets
If Joe segments his market by its present level of awareness, he might identify the fol-
lowing groups:
0.	 At the outside are people who are experiencing hair loss and who may find it an 
annoyance, but do not consider it a problem.
1.	 There will be other people for whom hair loss is a problem, but who are not aware 
that treatments are available.
2.	 Some people are aware of some solutions, but do not yet know about Joe’s Miracle 
Hair-Gro.
3.	 Others know about Joe’s solution, but do not know how it is any better for them 
than other products.
4.	 Some people may be convinced of the benefits of Joe’s product, but are not yet 
ready to commit to buy.
5.	 Finally, potential customers think that Joe’s product is probably the best, and 
would like to buy it.
I call this progression in awareness the Awareness Ladder. Everyone who could pos-
sibly be in the market for Joe’s product is at one point in this list. Each step represents 
a distinct market segment. Joe would love to be able to market his product to all of 
them—and he can. To do so, he will need to use a particular approach for each group.
In order to offer people the right proposition, it is important not only to segment 
them by their need but also by their level of awareness. There would be little point 
running an ad for “50% OFF Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro” to a market that is not aware 
of the product or its benefits. Similarly, an ad (or web page) proclaiming “Finally—
A Treatment for Hair Loss!” would not catch the attention of a market that already 
knows of a dozen products on sale.
Because traditional advertising must carefully optimize the return on every dollar 
spent on page space, off-line ads must target the right people at the right awareness 
point with precision.
Again, you have a huge advantage marketing on the Web, thanks to the power of mul-
tiplicity. You can market to people at every point of awareness at the same time.

Understanding the Six Steps of Awareness
The Awareness Ladder (Figure 4-3) can help give you insight into any marketing or 
selling opportunity. To understand it fully, you need to be aware of a few simple laws 
about the buying process:
Everyone, at some point, starts at Step 0 (before they realize they have a need).
u
u
They can only ever buy from Step 5—when they are convinced by the proposi-
u
u
tion that the solution will address their needs.
The sequence is logical. Prospects can only go up one step at a time.
u
u
So, to achieve a sale, you must get people from their current level of awareness 
u
u
to the top of the ladder, one step at a time.

Where Is Your Market on the Awareness Ladder?
Depending on your marketing environment, your market is likely to be focused around 
one point on the Awareness Ladder. If you are launching a new product, nobody will be 
above Step 2. So it is vital to invest in web content that speaks to people at Steps 2 and 1.
By contrast, there are many products that everyone knows about, like Coca-Cola. The 
bulge is around Steps 4 and 5. When you have a household name, in addition to rein-
forcing its benefits over the competition, the trick to increasing sales is to get more 
people to see it as a solution to new problems, or in new contexts.
In Joe’s case, nobody knows about his product, so the market from Step 3 and 
upward is minimal. There may be plenty of people who have baldness and for whom 
it is not a problem (Step 0). You could expect to find some people at Step 1: those 
who would be interested in re-growing hair, but are not aware of a solution. And 
there will also be folks at Step 2, who are aware of some treatments. At this point, Joe 
can assume his market bulges at all three steps. Keyword research would give him 
more accurate data.
note ​If you were to draw a graph next to the Awareness Ladder that shows the size 
of your market at each level, where would the bulge be?
How to Use the Awareness Ladder
The key to getting people to move up the ladder is found in the answers to the follow-
ing questions:
What is their current level of awareness?
u
u
What are they looking for right now?
u
u
What are they open to at this point?
u
u
What will get their attention?
u
u
What next step can you invite them to take?
u
u
What do you need to convince them of for the next step to make sense?
u
u
Let’s look at how Joe could publish content on his web site that speaks directly to dif-
ferent market segments at each step on the Awareness Ladder.

54 ❘ Chapter 4: Using the Awareness Ladder
Step 0: Not Aware of the Need
The “no problem” group is the hardest to market to, for two reasons. First, they do not 
need anything, so you cannot offer them a proposition. Second, because they are not 
looking for anything, you cannot attract them to your web site through regular ­marketing 
methods (such as SEO or pay-per-click advertising). If nobody is looking online for a 
solution, how can you serve them a page that addresses their nonexistent need?
The problem here is one of education, which is not a cost-effective way to market, 
because you have to invest in creating a need before you can offer a solution. To con-
vince people to buy his product, Joe would first have to find people with a relevant 
condition and convince them that their condition is undesirable.
But how does he start? How can he reach people via the Web who aren’t looking for 
anything?
The only approach is to go where they are already, which means publishing content in 
existing media that the target market is likely to use. This content would need to dis-
cuss the issue of hair loss or baldness and then go on to suggest that it is both unde-
sirable and treatable.
Joe might run a survey of people in a certain age group, and write up the results into 
an interesting article that suggests that more people would like to regrow hair if they 
knew there was an affordable and reliable solution.
If you can open up the market this way, it is possible make good profits by being the 
pioneer brand that first gets into people’s awareness. However, note that the education 
approach has its risks. First, it is costly. Also, by raising awareness of the condition, 
you can find yourself creating a market for competitors as much as for yourself.
Step 0 is most appealing when you suspect there is a large and untapped market wait-
ing with an unexpressed need. Marketing to Step 0 would be an inefficient way for Joe 
to drive sales. He will get better results from focusing on the later steps. In his case, it 
is clear that there is a large enough market for Joe’s product that he does not need to 
be concerned about developing new opportunities at Step 0.
Step 1: Aware of a Need (but not Aware Solutions Exist)
The segment on Step 1 is more accessible. These are people who already identify the 
condition as a problem, and who may be interested in discussing it. They want to 
learn about what options they may have.
The way for Joe to access this market is to publish articles that specifically match 
searches for his target “problem” terms (such as “hair thining,” “hairloss women,” 

Your Key to Reaching Deeper Markets ❘ 55
and “regain hair” that were revealed by the keyword research in Chapter 3). Note how 
those terms are related to the problem only, and do not indicate the awareness of a 
solution.
Joe would optimize each page for its specific keywords. Each page could start by dis-
cussing the issue in general, acknowledge that it is somehow undesirable, and then 
lead to suggestions that treatments may exist.
Once he introduces the possibility of treatments, the prospects are now at Step 2. If 
they are interested, they will read on. Joe’s “problem” articles could then link on to 
other articles that discuss what solutions are available.
Step 2: Aware of Some Solutions (but not Your Specific One)
At Step 2, people are actively looking for the right solution to their need. They may 
search for “cure for baldness” or “hair restoration options,” for example. Or they 
may be asking for “best remedy for hair loss” or “which hair thinning treatments 
really work?”
For this audience, Joe simply creates more articles that match each of those specific 
terms. Of course, these pages already start from the assumption that the condition 
is both unwanted and treatable, and pick up the story with explorations of the vari-
ous treatments available. They might cover multiple angles and mention alternative 
approaches before suggesting Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro as a good option.
After further keyword research, Joe might also find a significant number of people 
already searching on his competitors’ brand names. This could prompt him to pub-
lish more articles that compare the effectiveness of different known treatments (and 
emphasize the particular strengths of his own solution).
When he has introduced Miracle Hair-Gro as a possibility, Joe has moved the visitors 
from Step 2 to Step 3. He should then link them through to Step 3 content. From this 
point, Joe’s pages may start actively to sell.
Step 3: Aware of the Specific Solution (but not of its Benefits)
What kind of proposition would Joe present for people who are already aware of his 
product? Stepping into the shoes of people on the fourth rung, he just needs to ask 
what they will be searching for online.
Joe will get his answers using keyword research, and also by searching the Web for 
his product’s name. He may come up with searches like “Does Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro 
Work?” or “Should I Buy Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro?”

56 ❘ Chapter 4: Using the Awareness Ladder
The best pages to attract traffic for these questions are focused on the same language. 
So Joe should create a page called “Does Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro Work?” and another 
with the title “Should I Buy Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro?”
However they arrive, the job is always to get the visitors safely to the next rung on the 
Awareness Ladder. In this case, they need to be convinced of the benefits of Joe’s solu-
tion over the competition. So Joe needs to answer the question on the page, giving the 
visitors evidence that his product does indeed do what it claims.
When he has communicated those benefits, he has moved his prospects up to Step 4.
Step 4: Aware of Benefits (but not Convinced)
Simply communicating benefits is not usually enough to compel someone to take action 
and buy. To stimulate action, Joe must convince the visitors that his product will solve 
their need, and is worth trying. The best way to do this is to build the vision in their 
mind of how much easier or better their life will be once they enjoy the benefits.
At this point, Joe may encourage visitors to engage with a mental picture of life with 
a full head of hair. It is not the product, or even the hair, that will compel action. It is 
the vision of the lifestyle that the hair makes possible—the self-respect, the interested 
looks from women, the admiration of friends at the club, or reaching for a comb for 
the first time in years.
The visitor wants the fantasy, and the proposition is that Miracle Hair-Gro is the path 
to achieve that fantasy. So the visitor may become convinced he needs Joe’s product. 
Joe should reinforce his own claims with third-party evidence, in the form of testi-
monials, press clippings, and “thank you” notes from happy customers.
When the content has done the job of convincing someone (who, let’s remember, has 
arrived ready to be convinced that Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro is right for him) that the prod-
uct is worth a shot, he is now a Step 5 prospect, and all that remains is to close the sale.
Step 5: Convinced and Ready to Buy
The purpose of Joe’s selling page is to make sales. He can assume that people who 
arrive directly at this page, or this point, must already be convinced that Joe’s product 
is for them. They may have searched for “Buy Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro” or “Hair-Gro 
best prices,” or they may have clicked on an ad that mentions the product in its head-
line (which also identifies them as Rung 5 prospects).
Now, all Joe has to do is help them over the finish line. (Chapter 9 in Part II is dedi-
cated to showing you how to achieve this final crucial result.)

Why the Old, Narrow Model Fails ❘ 57
Why the Old, Narrow Model Fails
Web sites built in the narrow model cannot possibly deal appropriately with every 
different type of prospect with every type of need at every step of awareness. They 
simply do not have enough pages.
Consider the structure of Joe’s old site, and at what steps each of his pages belong.
Home Page
His home page discussed the issue of “male pattern baldness,” and attempted to sell 
the product. From the search engine’s perspective, it is about an issue and about a 
solution, so the page actually expects people who are aware of an issue and looking 
for a solution, so they are at Step 2 or Step 3. This is typical for a home page, and it is 
not wrong.
Because this is Joe’s only Step 2/3 page, it has all the responsibility of funneling pros-
pects through toward a sale, and it is unrealistic to expect it to do a good job of that.
FAQs Page
His “Frequently Asked Questions” page contains a range of long-tail content, but it 
is not focused on any step on the Awareness Ladder. It does not assume any particu-
lar level of awareness in arriving visitors, and does not aim to move them to any other 
level of awareness (other than generally upward).
Pages dedicated to “FAQ” and “Testimonials” really do not belong anywhere on the 
Awareness Ladder (and, I might argue, do not belong anywhere on your web site). 
FAQ and testimonial content, on the other hand, can be very helpful at several differ-
ent points on the Awareness Ladder. For example, you could have a set of Q&A dedi-
cated to discussing the merits of different solutions (at Step 2 or Step 3). You could 
have another set on the subject of benefits (Step 4), and another focused exclusively 
on resolving people’s doubts before they enter their credit card details (Step 5).
I am a great believer in both FAQs and testimonials, but I advocate weaving them 
into your main content exclusively at points where they can positively support the 
prospects at their current level of awareness to get to the next level of awareness.

58 ❘ Chapter 4: Using the Awareness Ladder
note ​Most FAQ and testimonial pages are nothing more than places to file away 
some of a web site’s most powerful content.
“Buy It Now” Page
Clearly, a page for purchasing belongs at Step 5. It will only be effective if Step 4 has 
been achieved. If a site introduces a product, makes vague claims, and then expects 
people to buy without doing the necessary work to convince them, Step 5 will not see 
a good level of conversions.
Joe’s site may only need one purchase page. However, I would like to see at least one 
page dedicated to Step 4. Remember, individual markets with different needs and 
different language will be best served by content that’s dedicated to addressing their 
needs in their language.
note ​If you have a web site today, go through and consider which pages belong at 
which steps on the Awareness Ladder. If a page does not seem to belong, what is its 
value? Are there steps missing altogether?
The New Concentric Model
You see now that a web site that really hopes to reach the widest and deepest range 
of market segments must present a number of landing pages. These pages should be 
structured in a way that visitors are channeled efficiently up the Awareness Ladder.
Figure 4-4 illustrates the new landing page funnel in action for one market. Visitors 
may arrive at any step from 0 to 5. “O” represents an offering or proposition (where 
Steps 3 and 4 may often be combined).
When you combine all the funnels of landing and feeder pages into one web site 
structure, it helps to view it as a series of concentric rings (Figure 4-5). Visitors may 
arrive at any point in any ring. The only objective is to lead each visitor from their 
entry page to the next step, which is either the next ring up, or to complete one of the 
site’s goals.

Figure 4-4 ​In the new model, each offering or proposition benefits from 
a structured funnel of pages that guide prospects up each step of the 
Awareness Ladder.
Any page may span more than one ring in the concentric model, if it leads the pros-
pect through more than one awareness step.
Step 0 pages, if you have any, will not usually exist on your own site. (I address these 
more in following chapters.) Their job is to create the sense of a need, and then to lead 
to content that discusses the problem (Step 1) and maybe also how it may be addressed 
(Step 2). The pages should then link on to content for the next relevant step. Don’t 
assume that Step 0 content has to be web pages. Because you have to go out to Step 0 
prospects, a variety of media may be effective, including banner ads, direct mail, or 
even print, television, or radio ads.
Step 1 is the domain of “problem pages,” which attract traffic looking for more infor-
mation about problems. Their job is to communicate that solutions exist (Step 2), and 
may also introduce your solution (Step 3), and then link to the next step.

Step 2 content may include “solution space” pages, which attract people who are 
searching for solutions, using either generic terms (such as “best ant repellent”) or 
specifically (such as “Brand X ant repellent”). Pages that start with Step 2 content talk 
about existing solutions, and go on to present your offering as an option to consider 
(leading to Step 3).
Your home page will usually sit on Steps 2, 3, or both. Its job is to address the needs 
of people who are either already aware of your services (and need to find out more—
Step 3), or those who are looking for services like yours (Step 2).
All your proposition pages belong at Step 3. These pages may also lead people through 
Step 4, or may send them on to further pages that deal with Step 4.
The purpose of Step 4 content is to convince the prospects that your proposition is 
the right one for them. To do this, they need to put forward a complete argument that 
resolves the natural fears and doubts and reinforces the proposition with reassuring 
evidence.

The New Concentric Model ❘ 61
At Step 5, your only job is to close the sale (whether that is to facilitate a purchase or 
to get a prospect to make contact via the web site). As you move inward through these 
funnels, you will need multiple pages that lead into fewer pages. In the center you 
may only have one shopping cart or contact page. But if all the other steps are com-
plete, your Step 5 should see good results.
Remember that you do not need a massive matrix of landing pages on day one. If you 
have a web site today, you probably have pages that you will always need, so build 
around them. Identify redundant pages and make them work. Identify missing steps, 
and start creating content to fill the gaps. Over time, you can work outward, adding 
more funnels that address more markets, constantly expanding your reach to explore 
new market segments.
The Semantic Matrix Method
We often find a range of alternative terms, any of which could be valid for landing 
pages. In this case, it helps to arrange the search terms into logical groups. The semantic 
matrix method simply means you group related types of meaning together, letting you 
express the solution in the form of a matrix, which can give you a structure for creating 
multiple targeted landing pages to cover a range of combinations of search terms.
In Chapter 5, I introduce one of our clients, Bridge Natural Health. They offer a wide 
range of  therapies, each of which can treat a wide range of issues. Obviously, the 
Bridge site could benefit from a Step 2 page on each service they offer, a Step 1 page 
for every complaint they can treat, as well as more specialized Step 2 pages on the 
combination of complaint and treatment (such as “herbal treatments for insomnia”).
I might express the range of possible searches in a semantic matrix like this:
(Problems) × (Treatments)
I could then do keyword research to identify the most popular problems and the most 
popular terms describing treatments, which makes the process quicker and simpler.
You can find a useful online tool that I use to “seed” my keyword research at http://
textmechanic.com/Permutation-Generator.html. Enter a range of first, second, third 
words, and so on and the generator will produce a list of every combination. Then, 
simply copy and paste the list into WordTracker or Market Samurai and see what 
combinations work. Figure 4-6 shows a semantic matrix I used to set up searches 
relating to web design agencies.

62 ❘ Chapter 4: Using the Awareness Ladder
Figure 4-6 ​Use the handy text permutation generator to generate semantically meaningful phrases 
for keyword analysis.
Generating Large Amounts of Content
When you consider the number of pages this kind of landing page matrix demands, 
the first reaction is always, “How on earth are we going to generate all that content?”
You will usually find that the knowledge is already there within your organization. 
You just need to know, first, how to extract it, and then how to turn it into publishable 
content. There is no escaping the fact that it will take work. (There is also no escaping 
the fact that the return for that work could be enormous!)
To create landing pages focused on every possible combination would involve a huge 
amount of work. I suggested that the client hire a journalism student or recent gradu-
ate, and to give her the following brief:
Arrange a 30-minute interview with one of our practitioners.
u
u
Take a tape recorder. Ask the practitioner to list the ten most common condi-
u
u
tions that the therapy treats most effectively.

The New Concentric Model ❘ 63
For each of the conditions, ask them to spend just a couple of minutes 
u
u
­describing:
How their treatment works to address the problem
u
u
Why it is effective
u
u
Where it is most advisable, and where it may not be suitable
u
u
(Anonymous) examples of the way it has affected patients’ lives
u
u
Then sit down and write up the transcript of the interview, with minor edits as 
u
u
needed to make it suitable for the web site.
Repeat with the next practitioner.
u
u
After all the practitioners have been interviewed, repeat the whole process, 
u
u
this time with the next most common complaints.
The objective of this exercise is to extract the knowledge that is already in the prac-
titioners’ heads with the minimum of work for the expert. The questions should 
provide a natural and easy-to-read structure that can be translated to text with little 
editing required, and at relatively low cost.
Include Geographic References
If your offering is relevant to a particular geographic area, it makes sense to include 
geographic references on all relevant pages. This is most applicable to Step 1 and 
Step 2 pages, for example, to match people searching for “blocked drain Boston” 
(Step 1) or “drain clearing service Boston” (Step 2). Because search engines can only 
match the text you include, make sure you put all place names within the range you 
serve, including county, state, and neighboring towns or cities.
Here’s a good tip for getting multiple place names onto a single page. Remember, 
there is little point getting visitors if the page does not come across as honest and use-
ful. On one of our clients’ sites, tile.co.uk (Figure 4-7), we made sure that every town 
within realistic driving distance was mentioned on every page of the site, by following 
the address with “easy distance from...” and a bunch of place names.
On the subject of local searches, it is worth mentioning Facebook advertising. Face-
book takes a very different approach than Google AdWords and other major pay-per-
click networks, and it can prove far more effective and profitable for certain markets. 
Whereas AdWords uses only the content of the page to display contextual ads, so it 
will show ads for hormone replacement treatment to every visitor on a page, even if 
the visitor is a 20-year-old man.

64 ❘ Chapter 4: Using the Awareness Ladder
Figure 4-7 ​Mention all your target geographical locations in the ­context 
of “Easy distance from...” or “Less than 30 minutes by car from…”
Facebook, on the other hand, has access to far more powerful data—the profile of the 
person looking at the page! Facebook knows a lot about most of its members, includ-
ing their age, location, gender, and job title. So, if you can define your market by these 
criteria, Facebook may be able to offer you incredibly accurate targeting, resulting in 
far higher click-through rates, and more profit.
The next chapter presents practical examples and case studies to show you how you 
can create content that builds a complete web site structure that is totally focused on 
reaching a wider range of prospects and guiding them to convert to customers.

working through the 
awareness ladder
In this chapter, I take you through eight real-world examples of sites that I have worked 
on recently, applying the Awareness Ladder model. Th ese examples show how you can 
use the Awareness Ladder to create web site strategies for attracting more of the right 
kinds of visitors, and what to show them when they arrive.
I propose a variety of diff erent strategies, each addressing the current level of aware-
ness of real-world markets, which I estimate using keyword research. Th e case studies 
range across various marketing and e-commerce sites. Each one will provide new 
insights into the process, and may give you new ideas that you can apply to your own 
web site. At the time of this writing, many of these sites are still in development. Th e 
strategies I propose must be implemented over a period of time, which will generate 
real data that show which approaches are most eff ective.
You will see that every web site starts from a unique position. Some sites are in com-
petitive markets, where they need to go head-to-head against established competi-
tion. Others off er new solutions, for which they need to go out and create markets. 
Relatively few web sites start with a signifi cant market at Step 3 (already aware of your 
product). Th e majority of these case studies have a market that bulges at Steps 1 or 2.
Depending on the composition and maturity of your market, you will need to con-
sider the right tactics for reaching the audience.
Save the Pixel
“Save the Pixel” is my fi rst book, published as an ebook in January 2008. Now in its 
second edition, it teaches web site owners and designers how to use the principles of 
simple web design. Th e web site is currently a single sales page (see Figure 5-1), and 
does not attract a signifi cant amount of search traffi  c.
ChaPter 5

66 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
Figure 5-1 ​“Save the Pixel” currently has a single sales page, which means it can only be focused on 
one market.
Problem: Most Obvious Market Is Small
The most obvious key phrase is “web design ebook.” However, the market is not very 
attractive. Figure 5-2 shows the keyword analysis. (The final column is calculated 
from the SEO Traffic divided by the Title Competition squared. It has also been mul-
tiplied by ten million to show meaningful numbers.)
The obvious target phrase “web design ebook” might deliver 75 visits per day with a 
top-place search ranking, but it is hotly contested with more than 50,000 competing 
pages. A few minor phrases, such as “web designing ebook,” “website design ebook,” 
and “web design ebook download,” might deliver more than 10 visits per day each, 
but still have competition numbering in the thousands.

Save the Pixel ❘ 67
 
Figure 5-2 ​These search terms reveal 
no attractive search markets.
It might be worth competing for a few of these terms, but I would also look elsewhere 
for more, easier traffic. These search terms are Step 3 terms (people searching for the 
same type of solution as we offer). The lower awareness steps often have much bigger 
markets. The question is, what are they looking for?
Ask, Where Is the Market?
The market bulges around Steps 1 and 2 (as with most of the sites in this list, and 
probably yours too). The Step 1 market wants to make better web sites, but does not 
know where to start. The Step 2 group is already aware of existing solutions, such as 
books, courses, and online tutorials.
Think Laterally to Uncover Alternative Needs
If people are not searching for the most obvious phrase, what are they looking for? Fig-
ure 5-3 shows more keyword analysis, this time for phrases associated with learning web 
design. In this example, terms with competition of under ten thousand can deliver far 
more traffic than the “web design ebook” market. “Learn web design” stands out, because 
it is relevant to the offering, has potential traffic of 374, yet only 4,690 competing pages.
 
Figure 5-3 ​Far more people are  
searching for ways to help them learn 
web design.

68 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
Some basic keyword research combined with a bit of lateral thinking can help you 
target potentially far more profitable segments. In this case, I would explore a range 
of related terms, such as “learn to be a web designer” and “how to make better web 
sites.” The time is very well spent. Someone searching for an online web design course 
could certainly be persuaded to buy a low-cost ebook.
Some of these terms are Step 1, such as “learn web design.” Others are Step 2, like 
“web design training course.” Both types of visitors will need to be persuaded that 
this particular solution could meet their needs. This will be easier to achieve with dif-
ferent landing pages targeted to each group.
The Step 1 visitors could be told that the best way to learn how to make effec-
u
u
tive web sites is through worked examples and case studies.
The Step 2 visitors need to be steered away from their initial goal. A visitor 
u
u
coming to my “web design course” page could be met with a message saying 
that most courses are both expensive and of limited value because they are not 
taught by professional practitioners.
For each group, I would find the best way to introduce the ebook as a must-
u
u
have solution, and explain all the value they will get (taking them to Step 3 
then 4), then tell them the book will give them value they cannot get elsewhere 
and reinforce the claims with real testimonials (Step 5, building the belief that 
they need this solution).
Bridge Natural Health
Bridge Natural Health provides a wide range of therapies at its center in Derby, 
­England. The center delivers a wide range of treatments, including conventional and 
alternative therapies, every one of which can be applied to a number of conditions or 
complaints. This is a classic example of where the narrow approach is insufficient, and 
how the multiplicity method can help a site achieve explosive growth.
Problem: Marketing a Diverse Range of Solutions
Clearly, if the site focuses on the common denominator—“natural health,” “remedies,” 
“treatments,” and so on—it will only address people looking for the generic term, which 
has to be a tiny minority of the number of people out there who have a real problem and 

Bridge Natur al Health ❘ 69
are looking for a real solution. People searching on “natural health” may not even be in 
the market at all; they could be researching the area in general!
Where Is the Bulge in the Market?
Again, we find a rich seam at Steps 1 and 2: people who know they have a problem, 
and either do not know how to get it treated (Step 1), or do not know the best way to 
get it treated (Step 2).
There may also be a significant market at Step 0: people who are living with a physical 
or emotional condition and for whom it is not a complaint but an accepted fact of life. 
It may be possible to reach out to this market by publishing stories in the local press 
of people who have found they can sleep better or live more comfortably after years of 
living with some condition.
Semantic Patterns
The more developed markets are at Step 1 and 2, so I would always start there. They 
have a present complaint, so it is far easier to sell a solution.
In situations of this type, it is common to see a page that lists all the problems that a 
single solution may address; for example, a page on hypnotherapy with a long bul-
leted list of the commonly treated conditions. On the plus side, the page will at least 
feature in the results “hypnotherapy for sleep disorders,” because it mentions both 
terms on the page. However, if its relevance is spread across dozens of conditions, the 
page will not be very competitive for any of the terms. Plus, it will make for very dry 
reading, unlikely to convert any but the most determined or desperate visitor.
When you have multiple solutions and multiple problems together, the answer is, 
of course, to turn to multiplicity. Yes, you need a page about hypnotherapy. But you 
need a page about “hypnotherapy for sleep disorders,” as well as a page about “hyp-
notherapy for stopping smoking.” These pages do not need to be very long; they are 
addressing Step 3 visitors, who know their problem and have expressed an interest in 
a specific type of solution. So their job is to say, “Yes, you are in the right place. Here 
is just the solution you’re looking for. It gets very good results, it’s in your area, it’s 
affordable, and here’s how to book.”
When I work through this kind of challenge with a client’s site, I would use the 
semantic matrix method I introduced in Chapter 4  with a matrix of the form:
(Problems?) × (Solutions?) × (Location)

70 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
This indicates that the client could create landing pages that either address a either 
particular problem, or discuss  a solution or treatment, or both. And, because the 
market for treatments is local, they should all mention the geographic locality. 
Every city has a hypnotherapist, an osteopath, and an acupuncturist, so no one 
is likely to travel very far for treatment. There is no point attracting traffic from 
outside the geographic range.
This would generate a wide range of landing pages, including:
Acupuncture Derby (a Step 2 page, which would also mention the symptoms 
u
u
that can be treated with the solution)
Back pain Derby (a Step 1 page, which would also mention all the solutions the 
u
u
center can offer to address the problem)
Acupuncture for back pain Derby (also a Step 2 page, which is linked to from 
u
u
both the previous pages)
Although keyword research shows that very few specific searches include the local 
place name, I would ensure that all relevant locations within the likely range are pres-
ent on every page, to match future long-tail local searches.
If Bridge Natural Health finds that the majority of its clients for certain issues or 
treatments fall into certain gender and age brackets, Facebook advertising would let 
it target different custom-written ads directly at the core demographic for that com-
plaint-treatment combination. It can also target the ads at a precise geographic area.
Muazo
Muazo.co.uk is an e-commerce site that sells a relatively small range of high-value 
designer items for men, including wallets, headphones, and sunglasses. The site aims 
to be the exclusive supplier in the UK. As you can see on the original home page 
shown in Figure 5-4, the site is primarily visual. This means it has little text content 
that search engines can use to match pages to prospects’ searches.
Problem: Short Lifespan Products
The life cycle of the products Muazo offers is limited. As a first-mover vendor, there 
is always a risk of the products getting picked up by other sites, and the exclusivity is 

Muazo ❘ 71
lost. Lines are frequently replaced after a few months. From an SEO perspective, this 
raises a significant problem. A page dedicated to a particular line of products will 
eventually disappear, so the value of in-bound links will be greatly reduced.
Figure 5-4 ​The Muazo site is style-led but is short on content for search engines.
Muazo needed a content strategy that could help the site build incremental value 
for search engines, and which could also attract more customers to buy the current 
products.
Where Is the Market on the Awareness Ladder?
The existing market is entirely Step 3 to Step 4: people who know the specific brand 
they want to buy. Because the products are quite exclusive, the site can attract people 

72 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
who are actively searching for somewhere to buy them. However, by definition, the 
markets for these exclusive items are also quite small.
There is often a lot of business to be found at Step 2 and Step 1. So I will always ask 
what the up-stream markets could be looking for.
Strategy: Permanent Landing Pages
I considered what people who have a problem for which one of Muazo’s exclusive 
products may be looking for. What is their immediate need?
I investigated a range of possible search terms, including the more generic “birthday 
gifts for guys” (a Step 1 phrase, looking for initial ideas), and terms including “sun-
glasses” and “headphones” (which are more like Step 3).
Figure 5-5 shows my keyword analysis for the “gifts for guys” and “headphones, wal-
lets, and sunglasses” segments, using the same method as before. There are several 
attractive terms, offering useful traffic with relatively low competition.
Figure 5-5 ​Investigating search markets lower down the Awareness Ladder produced valuable target 
terms.
My theory was that we should create a set of permanent landing pages on the Muazo 
site, one for each targeted theme, which would in turn link through to the current 
offerings within the scope of the theme. I selected “best birthday gifts for guys,” 
“funky headphones,” and “unique wallets” as my titles for an initial set of test pages.

Muazo ❘ 73
I created these pages with editorial content that addressed the immediate need and 
interest of the respective visitor, and furnished them with descriptive text, images, 
and links to the current lines, as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6 ​Simple editorial-style landing pages for Muazo.co.uk
I then spent just a few hours on some preliminary link-building. The important factor 
is that links to these permanent pages can persist indefinitely, plus the page the visitor 
lands on should always be able to fulfill the promise of the link. Muazo will always be 
able to offer advice on the best gift for the guy in your life, even if it changes its prod-
uct line-up completely.
After a couple of months, we started to see some interesting results from the experi-
ment. Even with minimal link-building activity, 10% of the site’s traffic now arrives 
via  one of the four static pages I created.
The “funky headphones” page is the second busiest landing page on the site, after 
the home page, responsible for over 5% of all visits (which underlines the impor-
tance of good keyword research). At the time of writing, this page has a #6 ranking 
on Google.co.uk. It was the landing page for 58 visits from organic search, only one 
less search visitor than the site’s home page got.
By adding a further 35 pages, each targeting a different phrase, Muazo’s gravitational 
pull would increase to the point where it should more than double its initial traffic. 

74 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
And the value of these persistent pages could continue to build indefinitely into the 
future.
Imagic2015
Christophe Mely has one of the rarest jobs in France. He is an “écrivain public”—lit-
erally a scribe. Several hundred years ago, when most of the population was illiterate, 
if you needed to send a written message, you would visit someone like Christophe. 
Today, he offers a range of professional writing and administration services.
Problem: Selling Your Services When No One Knows You Exist
Christophe’s previous web site had a page that listed his services, which range from 
writing legal letters to love letters and typing services. As we know, combining mul-
tiple subjects on one page does not do a good job of topping the search engines in any 
of them. Again, the way forward lies in multiplicity.
The problem for this modern-day scribe is that he is one of the last few of his kind. 
Most people in France won’t know what the term means, and it certainly won’t be the 
first thing that pops into their mind when they hit Google.fr. (Christophe has had a 
web site online for a few years, but is not aware that it has generated even one lead!)
Where Is the Market?
We can discount Step 3 upwards altogether for Christophe, because practically 
nobody knows his profession still exists. His markets will mostly be stuck at Steps 
0 and 1. They don’t know of any available solutions to help them with their current 
challenge, so they are probably turning to the Web to seek guidance.
note ​Always look first at the highest step on the Awareness Ladder where you know 
there is a market, and which you don’t currently address.
Starting at Step 1, then, what questions are present in the minds of enough people 
for it to be worth marketing to them as a distinct group? Because the site will be in 
French, in this case, I did not carry out keyword research. Instead, I interviewed 

Imagic2015 ❘ 75
Christophe about what people actually ask him for. What are they trying to achieve, 
and what help do they need in order to achieve it?
Apply a Semantic Matrix
Here is another example where semantic matrix should come in useful. The pattern 
in this case would seem to be:
(Help with...) × (Type of document)
In the “Help with...” category, I would include:
“How to write...”
u
u
“Correct way to...”
u
u
“Format for...”
u
u
“Tips for writing...”
u
u
Christophe knows the types of documents he is called upon to write, so all we had 
to do was create a set of landing pages that matched as wide a range of the queries as 
possible.
Because the “how to” items have similar meanings, to create a page for each may 
result in several very similar pages. This is not necessarily a problem provided the 
market for that search term is big enough (as shown by keyword research), and you 
have the resources to write unique content. Provided the competition is not too high, 
it may be sufficient to include all the combinations on a page dedicated to the docu-
ment type, in other words, to include “how to write a love letter,” plus “tips for writ-
ing love letters” and so on on the same page.
note ​Google does not appreciate duplicate content. It will tend to ignore newer ver-
sions it finds, and list only the “original.”
Fortunately, our man is precisely the right person to create this content. He knows his 
subjects inside out, and he can type like a demon. Because they are directed at Step 1 
audiences, the pages that Christophe creates should all follow a similar pattern:
Stress the importance of the correct form or manner of the document in 
u
u
­question.
Mention the potential impact of doing it wrong (creating pressure).
u
u

76 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
Describe what a good example of the document should do, mention what it 
u
u
should include, and give some examples or general advice. This will both rein-
force the need to do it right and also prove the author’s expertise in the area.
If the content creates the impression that there are further nuances to the art 
u
u
of writing a successful document of this type, it will emphasize the need to get 
specific professional help.
Introduce Christophe, the friendly guy who is helping teach you about this 
u
u
area, and say that he helps people do this kind of thing successfully. This 
brings the visitor to Step 3.
The page should then include (or link to) Step 4 content, which explains the 
u
u
reasons why it really pays to hire the professional.
Finally, a call to action (Step 5) invites the visitor to get in touch with 
u
u
­Christophe to discuss how he can help.
Me2Solar
Me2Solar is a new brand of portable solar chargers that can recharge portable elec-
tronic devices. They come in various sizes suitable for a range of uses.
The smaller models are suitable for business travelers, who want to be able to recharge 
their cell phones, satellite navigation systems, and PDAs while traveling, as well as 
families going on vacation, who can recharge their phones, GPS devices , and porta-
ble games consoles, without having to carry a number of adapters and heavy chargers.
Larger models are designed for adventurers and explorers, who can charge satellite 
phones and other vital equipment.
The web site projects the brand’s qualities of modern technology combined with 
smart design and ease of use, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Using Content Strategy to Differentiate Benefits
Similar products are available on the market, but Me2Solar’s products have advan-
tages over competitors’ offerings, being very lightweight, flexible, and durable. This 
means its prices are slightly higher, so it needs to emphasize its benefits over the 
competition.

Me2Solar ❘ 77
Figure 5-7 ​Our design for Me2Solar’s product pages reflect the high quality and high-tech properties 
of the brand.
Where Is the Awareness Bulge?
There will be a significant market at Step 0: people who accept the way things are, 
unaware that there exist products that could make their lives easier.
At Step 1 are those who are aware of the inconvenience of having to carry  power 
chargers and adapters, or the risk of being left without power. This is likely to be a 
good-sized market.
Keyword research shows there is also a good-sized market at Step 2, as shown in Fig-
ure 5-8. These are adventurers and technology-savvy users who are already aware of 
this new technology, and are looking for the right model, particularly for cell phone 
charging.

78 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
Figure 5-8 ​Solar charging for cell phones is a very attractive search market.
How to Market to the Various Groups
For the Step 2 market, the objective is simply to present the appropriate Me2Solar 
product, and to provide information that allows the prospect to compare the product 
with alternatives, positioning the benefits and value for money.
Group tests are a simple way to show head-to-head comparisons. You can publish 
your own comparisons of the features of your product and the competition’s offer-
ings. These tests are a good way to feature competitors’ brand names with comparison 
keywords, such as “better,” “best,” and “most reliable” on a page that also offers visi-
tors valuable insight.
note ​It can also be good PR to submit your offerings to relevant blog and magazine 
sites for purposes of tests, particularly where you have a competitive advantage and 
the product is novel and newsworthy.

Ville & Company ❘ 79
At Step 1, does your research indicate that people are searching on particular prob-
lems? If so, target those problems directly. I would start by looking for phrases that 
indicate looking for a solution, such as “How can I?” “How to...” or “Best way to...” 
and either create landing pages for these terms (if the market and competition are 
stronger), or perhaps add Q&A content to existing pages that literally mention a num-
ber of these exact phrases.
For Step 0, you have to go out to the market. Your task is to let people know that 
something is possible that they are not aware is possible. If it is not in the general con-
sciousness, you can often make your announcement into news.
Competitions are a time-honored way to get your offering noticed by an unaware 
market. Offering a free product to a publication (online or offline) as a competition 
prize is a win all around:
The publication gets to show something that will attract their readers’ ­attention.
u
u
The readers get news about something that they can visualize using.
u
u
You get exposure.
u
u
You should also be able to capture the contact details of every respondent, giving 
u
u
you an instant mailing list of prospects who were probably previously unaware 
of your product and have just jumped from Step 0 right up to Step 3 or 4.
Ville & Company
Ville & Company is a small consulting firm based in London, which has a special 
focus on public sector clients. Its market is dominated by a small number of large 
consultancies, so it should not attempt to compete on the same terms as the big play-
ers. Ville has an extremely strong offering for its target market, being more experi-
enced, more personal, more flexible, and more affordable than the large competitors.
Its home page (see Figure 5-9) emphasizes its positioning, focusing on real people, to 
distinguish the company from large, faceless consulting firms.
Problem: Competing without Going Head-On
The market’s mind-set is conditioned by the status quo. Until they are aware of the 
existence of firms like Ville & Co., prospects are likely to assume that they only have 

80 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
a choice of “the big five.” In this case, they are unlikely to be searching for “more 
affordable alternative to Brand X.” How do you reach out to people who are not look-
ing for what you offer?
Figure 5-9 ​Ville & Company’s web site is all about people.
Where Is the Market?
If we accept the context of inquiry as “right consulting firm to hire,” the market could 
be at Step 2. For any given problem, prospects are all aware of the massive consulting 
firms, but not aware of Ville & Co.’s particular offering.
However, if we broaden the scope to “a strategic or organizational challenge,” and 
remove the context of “consulting firm required,” the market shifts. Simply by 

Ville & Company ❘ 81
discounting the competition as viable solutions in the prospects’ minds, they move 
from Step 2 to Step 1: aware of the problem but no likely solutions.
A Game-Changing Strategy
In any no-win game situation, the ideal solution is to change the game. In this case, we 
should ignore the direct comparison with the competition, and change the question. 
If prospects are not actively looking for alternatives to the big players, what are they 
looking for?
They are looking for help with a wide range of problems, which may originate with 
policy, compliance, or with management difficulties.
With a domain this broad, it seems absurd to undertake keyword research. Even if 
you did find the historical search data show a handful of people searching on a par-
ticular topic, it would not be worth tailoring content strategy to target those individ-
ual search phrases. For a consulting firm, which works with high-level organizational 
intelligence, any output must be of a high value, which takes time and energy. A dif-
ferent approach is required.
Going back to the client’s positioning, how do they intend to distinguish them-
selves from the competition in the prospect’s mind? They are more flexible, more 
approachable, and more human. The ideal content strategy should resonate with 
those brand values. And, because it is not possible to address the full breadth of the 
problem domain, they need to turn the problem on its side and look for a qualitative 
differentiator.
My suggested strategy is to focus on the issues that are new, whatever is about to emerge 
as the next big challenge for Ville & Company’s market. As part of its on-going cus-
tomer care, Ville’s consultants should always be listening for what issues are about to 
become important.
They should quickly get to work on a briefing paper that is targeted at the senior exec-
utives, permanent secretaries, and government ministers that make up their market. 
The paper should give these individuals useful advance warning of what is about to 
come over the horizon.
The paper should be distributed as early as possible through any appropriate chan-
nels. Ville & Co.’s target market is actually quite a small community, focused in an 
area of only a few square miles of London.

82 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
Providing valuable context-sensitive information in this way delivers several 
advantages:
It delivers real value, which gets attention.
u
u
It implicitly gives evidence of the expertise of the authors, positioning them as 
u
u
experts.
It builds trust. Anyone who has so much knowledge and expertise that they 
u
u
can afford to give such valuable strategic intelligence away must have huge 
reserves.
It reinforces all the brand values: personal, flexible, fast-moving, high integ-
u
u
rity, and so on.
All of which keeps the Ville & Company brand present in the mind of the tar-
u
u
get prospect, without having to sell at all.
Effectively, Ville is creating Step 0 content, which notifies people about problems they 
don’t even have yet, and propelling the prospect right through the steps up to Step 4: 
aware of the benefits available. In doing this, Ville is raising the prospect’s awareness 
of their offerings and benefits, which means that when a future problem emerges, the 
prospect may already be at Step 4 (in the context of “Ville as the solution”).
When the next strategic headache comes along, the hope is that these individuals will 
think “Ville” before they think “big-ticket consulting firm.” All without selling, and 
by creating a relatively small amount of content (which will, of course, be published 
on the company web site).
note ​Get in first. If you can be the first to publish on a particular topic online, you can 
achieve an unassailable position. The very first article, if it is insightful, newsworthy, and 
valuable, will start a conversation. Subsequent articles and blog posts will reference the 
original article, as will later posts. So, as soon as people start searching on the term in 
any numbers, your initial post will be at number one and will always be seen as authori-
tative. It will get more traffic, which gets it more links, closing out any competition.
Bolwell RV
Bolwell is an Australian company that started out making sports cars in the 1970s. It 
has gone on to develop solutions in fiberglass and composite materials for a range of 
products, from truck bodies to aerospace.

Bolwell RV ❘ 83
Its newest venture is a high-tech caravan (as they are known in Australia), which fun-
damentally reinvents the idea of how caravans are built and how they work. Its “Edge 
RV” is more aerodynamic, tougher, stronger, and cleverer than other products on the 
market, being constructed of bonded composites like carbon fiber, without the use of 
screws and rivets.
Twin Challenges: New Brand and New Direction
Bolwell is faced with two distinct problems in its online marketing. First, nobody is 
searching for its brand name, because it is new to the sector. Second, its product is so 
revolutionary that it does not fit the questions people are asking the search engines today.
By definition, there cannot be a significant market looking for something if that thing 
is truly new. If they were, the existing manufacturers would have picked up on the 
opportunity by now (if they had the technology).
A Brand New Market
The market for the Edge RV is at Step 0 in one sense. They are familiar with other 
caravan designs, and accept that the current state of the art is the way it is. So, in a 
“which caravan shall I buy?” context, they may be at Step 2. But taking the context of 
the completely new solution the Edge offers, the market is totally fresh. Acceptance of 
the current offerings on the market means there is little by way of a problem.
Keyword analysis validates this perspective. As Figure 5-10 shows, there is a good 
range of appealing keywords (limited to the local search market). But most of the 
terms refer to existing alternative designs or competitors. People are searching for 
what they already know is out there.
Approach for a Step 0 Market
Another hurdle that Bolwell’s campaign will need to face is the fact that it has a brand 
new domain name. Although it seems that the market is relatively uncompetitive, 
many of its competitors’ sites are around ten years old and are likely to have a large 
number of inbound links, which gives them a position that is difficult to attack.
One valid tactic in this type of situation is to go for the competitors’ brand names 
and alternative caravan styles, and I recommended that the site do this. Working to 
a tight launch deadline, the initial marketing site will go live with an FAQ page. The 

84 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
FAQ content can focus on comparing the Edge’s effectiveness and suitability against 
alternative recreation solutions already on the market.
Figure 5-10 ​Keyword research results around “caravan Australia.”
One of our favored techniques for capturing new search-friendly content is to include 
a “Did we answer your question?” form on content pages, as shown in Figure 5-11. If 
visitors do not find what they are looking for, they can enter their question, which can 
then be published in the Q&A, preferably on the same page. This technique generates 
excellent content because it captures real people’s questions in their own language.
However, the page will never compete on a keyword against a caravan or motorhome 
retailer who has a page that’s ten years old and filled with brand name after brand 
name. So this tactic will not win the game. And when you can’t win the game, you 
change the rules! I proposed a three-pronged strategy.
Using Off-Site Advertising
Plain old-fashioned banner ads have had bad press since more targeted methods have 
come along. Because banner ads give you a crude blanket approach, the CPM (cost 
per thousand impressions) prices have dropped significantly from their peak in the 
late 1990s.

Bolwell RV ❘ 85
Figure 5-11 ​The Q&A page on Bolwell’s new “Edge RV” web site features a “Did we answer your ques-
tion?” form for capturing visitors’ immediate concerns.

86 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
Most advertisers can get better value from targeting their ads through AdWords or Face-
book. The reason is that most advertisers are playing at Step 2 and above. They are inter-
ested in closing sales, so they go for the hottest leads, which are higher up the Awareness 
Ladder. Most don’t know how to work with Step 1, and Step 0 is a complete mystery.
When you are marketing a totally new solution at Step 0, as in Bolwell’s case, the 
economics of banner ads turns in your favor. The only job you have to do at Step 0 is 
to sow the seeds of a problem. So Bolwell can create a range of banner ads, which it 
can display on existing caravan-oriented web sites at low cost, right under the noses 
of their target market. With a wide enough campaign, their brand can start to gain 
recognition.
These ads only have to pique the reader’s interest, enough to get a click. They could 
even get away with showing the Edge’s futuristic design. Other classic approaches 
could be to announce the new benefits, such as “The most aerodynamic caravan you 
can buy,” “Tow with a regular 4-cylinder car,” or “Voted as most exciting new product 
at…” The company can test a range of appeals and figure out which produce the high-
est click-through rates.
Off-Site Guerrilla Marketing
If you are investing in link-building activity, it pays to kill two birds with one stone. 
When you’re marketing a new product at Step 0, it can be really easy to combine link-
building with PR.
In Bolwell’s case, it has a good range of forums dedicated to recreational caravanning. 
They can search for people complaining about various features (or lack of features), 
or asking questions about suitability of various products, and add promotional con-
tent that announces the revolutionary feature of the Edge. This forum content should 
appear as genuinely helpful, not salesy. Enthusiasm is fine, as is posting under your 
real brand name, as long as you post with integrity.
Remember that forum posts can be many years old, and it is easy to add your own 
content to the end of the page. If the post contains a link to your own site, you have 
an instant backlink from a page that is both established and relevant. If it has a good 
PageRank, even better.
How to Generate Content for a New Product
As previously mentioned, testimonials and FAQs can provide rich content for the 
long tail, as well as helping target specific problem or “how to” phrases. The Edge site 

EasySpeedy ❘ 87
will use a single FAQ page at launch, which should probably propagate across other 
pages as the body of content grows.
Testimonials also provide valuable third-party validation, which is particularly 
useful at Step 4, when you want to convince someone to believe in the advantages 
of your solution. But, with a brand new product, Bolwell has no list of previous cus-
tomers that it can mine for web site content. Where can it source testimonial-type 
content?
What I advised they do is set up a video booth at the product’s launch event (which is 
at a large trade show). People will get their first glimpse of this space-age caravan, and 
will be able to see its unique design and ingenious storage solutions.
At that moment of excitement, the manufacturer should whisk the prospect in front 
of a video camera and get an authentic reaction to seeing the product in the flesh. 
Asking a few short questions, such as “Do you own a caravan now?” “What model is 
it?” and “What do you think of the new Edge?” would also be beneficial.
Bolwell can then post these short clips to YouTube (www.youtube.com/), and ensure 
they are tagged with the new brand, as well as with any other brand names or rel-
evant keywords mentioned in the clip.
note ​Video content is far easier to consume than text content. A series of short 
clips about a new product can fuel a strong emotional response. At the time of writ-
ing, YouTube is the #2 most searched search engine in the world, after Google, but 
has a tiny fraction of the database. Add to this the fact that Google has started posting 
YouTube video results on the first page of its regular results, and it makes an extremely 
powerful marketing channel (that is currently underused).
EasySpeedy
EasySpeedy provides high-quality unmanaged hosting services at its secure datacen-
ter in Copenhagen, Denmark. Its major differentiator is that it can let customers com-
bine any combination of dedicated servers and cloud servers on a fast, unencrypted 
private network. Figure 5-12 shows our home page design, which clearly pushes the 
flexibility of the service and the “myPrivateNetwork” sub-brand.

Figure 5-12 ​EasySpeedy’s home page design features a “super footer nav,” which provides keyword-
rich site-wide links to some of the site’s  landing pages.
Differentiating in a Crowded Market
Hosting is a very busy marketplace, so it is critical to differentiate, both when you are 
fishing for traffic, and also to reinforce your benefits once they arrive. EasySpeedy has 
a clear distinguishing feature in that it offers unmanaged hosting only, so that needs 
to be foremost in its content strategy.

EasySpeedy ❘ 89
The keyword research, shown in Figure 5-13, reveals a wide range of viable terms, 
most with competition in the thousands. Most customers know exactly what they are 
looking for, which means the market bulges at Step 2. The task at Step 2 is to intro-
duce your service and to move on quickly to differentiate your benefits.
Nobody is looking for EasySpeedy’s particular strength, so the market for combin-
ing cloud with dedicated servers is probably at Steps 0 and 1. Some people who may 
benefit from it may not know it is possible (Step 0), and other may just be aware of the 
need, but don’t know how to solve the need (Step 1).
Figure 5-13 ​EasySpeedy’s keyword research shows the majority of Step 2 terms.

90 ❘ Chapter 5: Working through the Awareness Ladder
A Combination Approach
EasySpeedy should combine both Step 2 and Step 0 approaches, in a similar way to 
Bolwell with its revolutionary product. It is building a range of good Step 2 pages, 
offering plenty of long-tail content, based around the results of the keyword research. 
In addition, I would suggest a Step 0 campaign, using the same techniques proposed 
for Bolwell: banner advertising and guerrilla link-building.
Because it already has customers in more than a hundred different countries, it may 
pay to feature a list of its preferred target countries on all pages, to gain an advantage 
in the “unmanaged hosting (country)” market.
The second step of the marketing strategy is to hit every visitor with the brand values. 
They should get the immediate impression that this is an extremely efficient, modern, 
and professional company. Visitors who engage with the brand will have high expec-
tations of the service, and will be prepared to pay the appropriate prices. Visitors who 
are shopping on price alone may qualify themselves out at this point, which benefits 
the company.
note ​It is better to distinguish your position in the market positively on every page. 
Differentiation cuts two ways. For every unsuitable customer you discourage, you will 
encourage another, more suitable customer.
Applying the Awareness Ladder to Your Site
The worked examples in this chapter have illustrated a range of different approaches, 
each one based on the same simple steps:
Describe the present situation and the marketing challenge.

their awareness, such that the site can engage their attention and lead them up 
the Awareness Ladder toward closure.

Applying the Awareness Ladder to Your Site ❘ 91
You have seen a toolkit of tactics for reaching out to markets at different levels of 
awareness, and I have started to explore what landing pages need to do in order to 
engage visitors and keep them moving forward.
Although most web sites start around Step 3 on the Awareness Ladder, there are 
nearly always large and potentially profitable markets searching at Steps 2, 1, and 
sometimes even at Step 0. Each step requires a different approach. You should ask, 
“What is the level of awareness of people at this step? What are they looking for right 
now? How can we fulfill that need and capture their attention?”
One size never fits all. Some early-stage markets may be profitably reached through 
banner ads. For others, AdWords or Facebook advertising may be more profitable. In 
some scenarios, a wide range of landing pages on your site will help you target search 
traffic immediately. In others, you should focus your efforts on off-site tactics, using 
forums, blog comments, and YouTube videos.
When you execute a good content strategy, you will have done half the job. In addi-
tion to attracting more visitors in more markets, you will have created landing pages 
that seem to meet their present concern. Part II of this book addresses the specific 
techniques you need to apply to catch visitors’ attention and to retain that attention 
all the way up the Awareness Ladder to complete your goals.

Making your site sell
In Part I, I showed you how to use multiplicity to increase the marketing scope of any 
web site, fi rst by fl ipping your products into multiple propositions for diff erent mar-
kets, then by reaching deeper into those markets using the Awareness Ladder model.
Th ese methods help you identify your target markets and create an ever-expandable 
range of funnels arranged in a concentric structure for targeting every market and 
drawing them into your site.
You will now have far greater insight into what every market wants at each step of 
awareness. Your next task is to engage every prospect and to keep them engaged with 
your site. Th at is what you learn in Part II—design for optimizing conversion.
In this chapter, I show you how to analyze your funnels to identify where you are los-
ing visitors, and introduce the new approach for optimizing your site.
Th e following chapters take you through a complete step-by-step method for craft ing 
compelling web pages that keep all visitors moving forward to completing their goals, 
which is the way to achieve your goals.
note  This chapter assumes that you already have Google Analytics running on your 
site  Other analytics and web server stats packages may offer similar data and tools, 
so if you don’t have access to Google Analytics you will still be able to apply the core 
principles effectively 
The new approach to Design for Conversion
As we know, the old approach to web design is based on guesswork. You create a web 
page based on your intuition and see how well it works. If it does not seem to perform 
well, you might consider changing the design. Th ere is no guarantee the redesign will 
ChaPter 6

96 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
deliver better results than the old design, because no one’s first best guess is likely 
to be optimal. You could find that your redesign performs worse than the design it 
replaced, but because the changes were made wholesale you won’t even know why. 
That’s what life is like with the old model.
The new approach for designing web pages for optimal conversion draws on the 
discipline of direct marketing. Direct marketing applies the scientific method to the 
problem of working with human behavior. Accepting that people are ultimately unpre-
dictable, the direct marketer’s approach is to test the effectiveness of any message by 
measuring the way that people actually behave, to generate statistical results, and then 
to respond based on the facts.
note ​In web site optimization, just as in science, nothing is ever held to be the final 
truth. When they find a method that works well, marketers will not say it is the best 
possible method. They are always open to discovering a better way. So optimization is 
an ongoing process of continual improvement.
You Can’t Improve What You Don’t Measure
Without measuring how something works, you can’t know whether you have improved 
it, so measuring the effectiveness of each step in a sequence is the prerequisite to opti-
mizing any process.
The most basic goal of web page optimization is to keep people on your site. Visualize 
your site as a system of pipes. Visitors enter through funnels at various points, and 
proceed through the system. If they make it all the way through the system, they will 
reach a goal at the end.
Your web site will leak visitors at various points. Optimization is all about spotting 
where the leaks are, and fixing them to keep more visitors inside the system, so that 
more of them reach their goals at the end.
So to improve the efficiency of your site, you need to know where you lose the people 
you lose. If you don’t know where the holes are, you don’t know what needs fixing or 
improving. What’s more, if you don’t know what your conversion rates are today, you 
can’t even know if you do manage to improve them. Only once you have quantified 
something can you have something to measure success against.

The New Approach to Design for Conversion ❘ 97
Bounce Rate
One of the first metrics you’ll notice on many of your Analytics reports is bounce rate. 
This is the percentage of visitors who arrive and leave the site from the same page. 
Bounce rate can be a handy indicator of poor performance.
One reason for a high bounce rate may be that your page is attracting the wrong traf-
fic: The search engine result suggests your page offers a solution to certain queries, but 
perhaps the content does not live up to the expectation. A well-crafted content strat-
egy should minimize this effect.
If the page is attracting the right visitors, a high bounce rate could indicate the page 
is failing to engage them, which is a more serious concern. Look out for high bounce 
rates on your landing pages.
Note that bounce rate does not always signify a failure. Context plays a significant 
role. One example of good bounce rate could be on an FAQ page that successfully 
helps visitors solve a problem, perhaps preventing a support call. It may also be that 
visitors are leaving your site to go somewhere you want them to go. It is this type of 
question you need to ask when analyzing your funnel.
To give a real-world example, I published an article on a technical CSS topic that 
attracts significant traffic (more than 1,800 search visits monthly). That article has a 
very high bounce rate at over 90%. But the average time spent on the page is almost 
5 minutes, which means visitors are engaging with the article. Because that particular 
content is not likely to fulfill our agency’s major goals of generating new customer 
leads, I have placed Amazon affiliate content at the bottom of the page, encouraging 
visitors to browse CSS textbooks on Amazon.com, thereby causing them to leave the 
site (and increasing the bounce rate), but also contributing toward a minor goal of 
generating affiliate income.
Exit Rate
A more helpful metric than bounce rate is a page’s exit rate. This represents the per-
centage of page visitors who leave a site from a particular page. Though still a crude 
metric, exit rate provides a more accurate indicator of a traffic leak.
Spotting leaks through high exit rates can help you identify where a page just isn’t 
doing its job. Consider a high exit rate as an indicator that a page has failed to achieve 
one of two essential functions: Either the visitors simply do not know what to do next, 
or the page has failed to convince them it is worth proceeding.

98 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
I suggest using relative exit rate as the primary metric when modeling your site’s cur-
rent funnel, because it can indicate a fundamental failure either to engage visitors or 
to keep their interest. Minimizing a key page’s exit rate is a good indicator that the 
page is at least encouraging more people to proceed through the site.
Again, exit rate is not always a failure. You would expect a high percentage of visitors 
to leave from a “Thank you for your order,” “Thank you for contacting us,” or “You 
have logged out” page.
The process for starting to optimize your web site has three simple steps:
1.	 Modeling your site’s funnels
2.	 Analyzing your funnels
3.	 Optimizing your funnels
I will walk you through each step in sequence.
Step One: Modeling Your Site’s Funnels
Before you make any changes to your web site, it is absolutely essential to get a clear 
picture of the present situation. Consider you are your web site’s surgeon. A surgeon 
won’t operate on a patient without first having all the facts at hand. Operating on the 
wrong area could make the overall situation worse. Knowing the facts will help you 
diagnose the situation and show you where to make the first incision.
The process of optimizing your site’s conversion begins with visualizing its funnels. 
Every possible path from a landing page right through to a goal completion is a fun-
nel. The funnel’s conversion rate is the percentage of visitors entering the funnel who 
go on to complete the goal.
A funnel works by successfully driving visitors forward, which should mean to the 
next awareness step. If the visitor quits the process, that represents a leak in the fun-
nel. The optimization process is about spotting and fixing leaks.
Identifying Your Goals
To measure your conversion rates you have to know what success means for your  
web site.

Step One: Modeling Your Site’s Funnels ❘ 99
Your web site is essentially a series of messages, which you intend will eventually lead 
all visitors to complete some goal. The goal will vary, depending on the market and its 
level of awareness. However, it should always involve some commitment action on the 
part of the visitor, such as:
To purchase
u
u
To sign up
u
u
To share information
u
u
To contribute
u
u
To watch a demonstration video
u
u
To find help
u
u
note ​To measure conversion, you have to have a goal—a result you can measure.
If you don’t think you need to convert anyone to do anything, consider what oppor-
tunities you may be missing. Whatever the objectives of your business may be, there 
are many ways your web site can support them.
You may not actively sell from your web site, but could (or should) it generate leads or 
contacts? You may earn income through advertising. Your site could distribute sales 
material or provide cost-efficient customer support. An e‑mail list is a particularly 
valuable resource for any site, so start one today (even if you don’t know what to do 
with it yet).
note ​If your goal is to promote a message, Google Analytics will also help you track a 
minimum amount of time spent on the site or number of pages viewed in a visit as goals.
For example, one of our clients has an e-commerce site. One of the site’s goals is to 
collect marketing data. Visitors who may not want to shop online can easily get direc-
tions to his physical store by entering their postal code. This code is captured and 
used to measure the effectiveness of print advertising campaigns in different regions.
note ​Write down one or more measurable goals. These will usually equate to arriving 
on a certain page, such as a purchase confirmation or “thanks for contacting us” page.

100 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
Ensure your goals have some real business value, such as sales, lead generation, or 
building your marketing list. Avoid vague goals that have no direct value. Only invest 
your time in tracking goals that are useful to your business objectives, such as actu-
ally submitting a form, downloading a white paper, or purchasing a product.
Configuring Goals in Google Analytics
Before you use Google Analytics to model and monitor your funnels, you should first 
set up goals within Analytics. Do this by clicking the “Edit” link for your web site 
profile in the main Analytics menu (see Figure 6-1).
Figure 6-1 ​Access goal set-up by clicking the “Edit” link on an Analytics profile.
The Profile Settings page lets you edit your main options to configure Analytics for 
each web site. The second block is for displaying and creating goals, which are divided 
into four sets. To start defining a new goal, select + Add Goal in the first available set 
(see Figure 6-2).
I recommend using different goal groups for different types of goals, because some 
Analytics reports will only show statistics summarized for a whole group. So if you 
have one goal for selling a product and another for generating leads or newsletter 
sign-ups, set these up in separate groups.

Step One: Modeling Your Site’s Funnels ❘ 101
Figure 6-2 ​Adding a new goal in a goal group in Google Analytics
Figure 6-3 shows one way the add/edit goal form can appear. The options can change 
dynamically depending on the type of goal you set up. Google provides clear help 
throughout Analytics, so I won’t repeat all the basics.
Figure 6-3 ​The form for defining a goal
In Figure 6-3, I am using the default goal type of “URL Destination,” which means the 
goal will be achieved when a visitor arrives on a page that matches a certain name.
I have selected the “Head Match” match type, which means I want the goal to be 
counted when someone arrives on a page address that starts a certain way (for 
­example, /contact-us.php, /contact-us.php?from=menu, as well as /contact-us2.php).

102 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
If I had selected “Exact Match,” the goal would only be achieved when the visitor 
lands on an exact page name. The third more advanced type is “Regular Expression 
Match,” which lets you configure text patterns to match against.
Setting Up Your Funnels in Google Analytics
Google Analytics will also let you configure funnel visualization for any goal (shown 
in Figure 6-4), which will be available in your reports as a graphic that displays the 
conversion and attrition rate from each step to the next. You can access the funnel 
visualization report via the Goals menu in Analytics.
You can optionally specify the first page in the funnel to be required, which means 
only visits that include that start page and result in the goal page being reached will 
show in the funnel visualization.
Figure 6-4 ​Configuring a Goal Funnel in Google Analytics
Figure 6-5 shows the Analytics traffic sources report for my ebook site. Instead of 
looking at the overall site (with the Site Usage tab), I have clicked the Goal Set 1 tab, 
which shows me the percentage of visitors from different traffic sources who com-
pleted a certain goal (buying an ebook). This tells me that referrals from my main site 
convert 25% more than traffic from Google. Direct visitors have the highest conver-
sion rate, probably because they visited the site previously, and have come back to 
make a purchase.
I recommend defining all your site’s goals within Google Analytics, as well as all the 
main funnels to those goals. Before long, you will be able to look at the funnel visu-
alization reports in Analytics and start to analyze where the weak spots are in your 

Step Two: Analyzing Your Funnels ❘ 103
funnels. In the meantime, simply look at the exit rates for key pages as an indicator of 
where people are leaving the site.
Figure 6-5 ​Viewing a Google Analytics report in the context of a goal
Step Two: Analyzing Your Funnels
The next task is to map out the actual flow of traffic through your main pages to your 
main goals, looking at three categories of visitor behavior:
Proceeding to the next intended step
u
u
Going somewhere else on your site
u
u
Quitting the site
u
u
The purpose of this exercise is simply to visualize where your site is leaking the most 
visitors. It makes sense to start your optimization process with fixing the biggest 
leaks, before you can move on to progressive refinements.
Measuring Your Conversion Rate
Once you have identified one or more goals, you will be able to measure your starting 
conversion rate (CR). If you have configured a goal in Google Analytics, you will also 
be able to view the CR for that goal graphically (as shown in Figure 6-6), including 
changes in conversion rate over time.
note ​If you have not set up goals in Analytics, you can still figure out your conversion 
rates for each goal simply by dividing the number of times each goal was reached in a 
particular period by the number of relevant visits to your web site in that period.

104 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
Figure 6-6 ​The Analytics report for a single goal
Knowing your conversion rate may be interesting, but it does not usually give you 
actionable information. If your conversion rate goes up or down, you need to know 
why, and at what steps the leaks are occurring. The overall conversion rate of a fun-
nel is a high-level indication of its effectiveness, but in order to optimize, you need to 
break the process down into more detail, which is where funnels come in.
Attrition Rate
At every step through a funnel, some of the visitors who entered the funnel will leak 
away. The number of visitors who successfully move forward can only diminish with 
each step. It can never go up.
The conversion rate of any funnel is a product of the cumulative attrition rate at each 
step along the path from an entry point to a measurable goal. Your objective is to 
deliver as many as possible to that goal, by minimizing the attrition rate at each step.
Figure 6-7 shows a simplified view of a funnel. 100% of visitors enter the funnel at the 
top. 68% of those drop off at the first step, then a further 47% are lost at the second 
step, and finally there is a 41% attrition at the final step. The result is that only 10% of 
the original visitors make it all the way to the goal.
Once you can visualize your conversion funnels like the example in Figure 6-7, you can 
start to identify the steps that demonstrate the greatest opportunity for improvement. 

Step Two: Analyzing Your Funnels ❘ 105
In this case, the first step (with the greatest attrition rate of 68%) would seem to offer 
the most potential for improvement, but all three steps merit attention.
–41%
–47%
–68%

Figure 6-7 ​Visualizing a funnel in terms of attrition rate
Visualizing Your Funnels in Google Analytics
The funnel visualization view in Google Analytics makes it quite straightforward to 
see the click-through rate from step to step, as Figure 6-8 shows. Analytics lets you 
define the steps in your site’s funnel, and will give you a diagram showing how many 
visitors you convert or lose at each step.
Once you have set up your goals and given them some time to run, you will be able to 
view many of the reports in Analytics within the context of your goals, as well as ana-
lyze in more detail the paths people take to achieve the goal.
The attrition rates in the funnel in Figure 6-8 are 89%, 63%, and 97%, respectively. 
Each score needs to be interpreted in the context of the page in question. From this 
site’s home page, common sense tells me that a click-through rate of 11% to the About 
page is not bad. I would be more concerned about the later steps.
The horizontal colored bars at each step show the proportion of people who proceed 
to the next step or do not proceed. Of those that do not proceed, some may go some-
where else on the site, and some may leave the site altogether. The lists shown on the 
right-hand side of each step indicate where those who do not proceed go instead. You 
should be most concerned about the exit rate.

The Law of Multiples
Imagine the path through your web site, from home page to goal, is a 300-mile train 
line. If the track is strong, flat, and clear for 299 miles, then heads across a bridge that 
has a section missing, how many trains are going to reach their destination?
It doesn’t matter how well maintained the rest of the track is, how many trains begin 
the journey, or the value of goods they carry. If a bit of track is missing your success 
rate will be zero. Fix that section of track and the improvement in success rate will be 
astronomical.
The Law of Diminishing Returns dictates that the closer you get to optimal, the 
harder it gets to make further improvements.

Step Two: Analyzing Your Funnels ❘ 107
The Law of Multiples tells us that the effects of the conversion rate of individual steps 
are cumulative, that is, any impact you have on any step along the path will apply to 
the whole conversion rate. Double the conversions at any step, and overall conversion 
will also double.
Because it is practically impossible to double a click-through rate of 50%, you can 
much more easily double a click-through rate of only 2%. Either one would double the 
final conversion rate, which is why we focus first on the easier wins.
As soon as you model your funnel, you will see exactly where to start focusing your 
optimization efforts. Unless you know the attrition rate from each step to the next, 
you could waste resources on steps that perform better.
Goal Value, CPV, and EPV
There is no target conversion rate at this point. The first target you should be inter-
ested in is profitability. To measure profitability, it helps to know your Cost per Visitor 
(CPV) and Earnings per Visitor (EPV).
If your web site’s EPV is more than its CPV, you should be in profit. In other words, 
the value your site delivers for your business is greater than the cost of running the 
site and attracting traffic. (Later, your objective will be to increase profitability—the 
margin by which your EPV exceeds CPV.)
Only you will be able to provide these numbers. It is relatively easy to measure profit 
for an e-commerce site, but a web site’s indirect value is more subjective. For example, 
if your site generates sales leads for your business, you may want to estimate the aver-
age profit earned from each lead, and assign that value to a lead-generation goal. If 
your site gathers a list of e‑mail address, can you estimate the lifetime value of each 
name on that list?
Consider the business value generated by each goal. Analytics lets you assign real 
or nominal values to any goal. Many e-commerce services will pass back an actual 
value that will tell Analytics the sale value of each transaction. (For more info, search 
Google for “How do I track e-commerce transactions?”) You can also give any goal 
an arbitrary value on the configuration screen (see Figure 6-3). Setting goal values 
lets you view the traffic sources and paths through your site that are most profitable, 
which will also help you target areas to optimize first.
If you know the real cost of the time and services spent on building and maintaining 
your site, you may be able to put a figure on your CPV by dividing that cost spread over 

108 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
time by the total number of visitors. A simple way to reduce your CPV and to increase 
your EPV-to-CPV ratio is to drive more traffic to the site. However, bear in mind that 
while accurately targeted traffic is likely to increase your average EPV, more of the 
wrong traffic could reduce EPV, so raw visitor numbers are not always meaningful.
note ​If a likely goal from your site is for visitors to pick up the phone and call you, 
you need a way to keep track of phone calls generated by the web site. A great way to 
do this is to use a telephone script that includes the question “How did you hear about 
us?” Also consider doing this for any face-to-face leads.
When you have modeled your web site’s goals and funnels, you will soon be able to 
see each funnel’s performance in Google Analytics. Look first for pages with high 
exit rates or low click-through rates. These should indicate where you can achieve the 
most significant improvements.
Step Three: Optimizing Conversions 
through the Funnel
In the “first best guess” approach to web design, we built web pages from our own 
internal perspective, which we hoped would attract traffic and help people find what 
they were looking for.
The new approach takes a far more direct and analytical approach. When you work 
with multiple funnels, you can spot how visitors are progressing with greater pre-
cision, and take specific steps to optimize every step in each funnel to maximize 
conversions.
Here is the simple and straightforward process for optimizing any funnel:
1.	 Identify leaks.
2.	 Generate alternative ideas.
3.	 Test to see what worked.
4.	 Repeat.
The first step is straightforward. Just look for the worst leaks in your most important 
funnels.

Step Three: Optimizing Conversions through the Funnel ❘ 109
The second and third steps work together. You need to apply all your best knowledge 
and ideas to the problem. Creativity alone will not give you solid progress. You must 
test each change you make so that you know whether it had a positive or negative 
impact.
Chapters 7, 8, and 9 take you through a comprehensive system for generating 
u
u
ideas for how to make your pages work better.
Chapter 10 applies all the principles to every step on the Awareness Ladder.
u
u
Chapter 11 introduces the methods you can use to test your ideas and to know 
u
u
definitively what works best.
Finally, optimization delivers best results when you do it as an iterative process. When 
you switch from the “first best guess” approach to a culture of optimization, when-
ever a change is made and tested, you get to see—and then choose to keep—only the 
things that are proven to work better. Every cycle builds on previous successes, creat-
ing a culture of continual improvement.
Optimization Combines Creativity and Analysis
Analysis lets you measure performance with quantifiable results. It will tell you if 
design option A converts better than design option B. Without these numbers, you 
can’t be sure of selecting the best-performing option. When you test different options 
iteratively, your numbers will ensure you only select the best-performing option, 
guaranteeing forward progress is achieved.
However, testing and measuring can only describe what is—the past performance of 
A and B. Simply measuring performance can’t tell you why A is better than B, nor can 
it reveal what might work better.
Consider that the process of optimizing your design is similar to the process a scien-
tist follows when trying to figure out how things work. A scientist will start with an 
idea or hypothesis, then construct an experiment to test that idea. The experiment 
should deliver empirical evidence, which may indicate whether the idea is valid or 
invalid. That result may require a new hypothesis to be formed, or even lead the sci-
entist to question the theories upon which the hypothesis was based.
The scientific method has made possible huge advances in technology, despite the fact 
that it rarely gives a definitive answer. Because any theory is only as valid as the 

110 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
­evidence that supports it, and the process is never complete, scientists always remain 
open to the possibility that their current working theory may be proven wrong.
Apply exactly the same discipline to increasing the conversion rate of your web site. 
Testing will give you measurable results, but no final answers. To find an option that 
improves on your current best option requires insight into why one approach works 
better than another, and the ability to visualize an even better solution. The numbers 
may help point in the right direction, but they can’t take you there.
In marketing and design, just as in science, previous theories exist that describe how 
things should work. It is foolish to ignore the lessons of the past that teach us how 
people tend to respond in different situations, and how to persuade them to be willing 
to take the action you want. Efficient optimization requires not only being familiar 
with this body of knowledge, but also having the insight to apply that knowledge to 
each new problem with sensitivity. Like a scientist, you need to be able to generate 
new ideas—hopefully even brilliant flashes of inspiration—and that is the domain of 
creativity.
So what do we do if neither analysis nor creativity can give us the answers we want?
The solution lies in unifying both methods into a single process, in which creative 
possibilities are explored and then validated through analysis. I’ll describe how this 
approach plays to the strengths of both mindsets and also provides a rewarding expe-
rience for all stakeholders.
The Limits of Creativity
Though, in theory, creative endeavor is boundless, the process needs to be channeled 
in order to be efficient. It is not possible to test an infinite number of creative possi-
bilities without an infinite budget. The optimal design solution is out there, but it can 
only be discovered through a disciplined, methodical approach.
The challenge you face when optimizing your web site is how to harness the strengths 
of the creative process in the pursuit of continual improvement. If not every idea can 
be put to the test, you have to use heuristics (rules-of-thumb) from received wisdom 
to help direct your creative energy.
Originality is a dangerous frontier land. At once, it is the place where great original 
advances can be discovered, but it is also full of opportunities to fail. The saying, “The 
pioneers take the arrows, the settlers take the land,” applies perfectly to the quest for 
the optimal web site.

Step Three: Optimizing Conversions through the Funnel ❘ 111
Biology provides the perfect analogy to guide our discipline. Life constantly gener-
ates mutations, most of which fail. Occasionally, a new solution emerges that is more 
successful than previous solutions, and which can become established in its environ-
ment. This evolution works extremely well over a very long timeline (millions of new 
tests), and your resources will certainly not stretch that far.
Use Conventions
A design solution that has become established in its environment is called a conven-
tion, and conventions provide the ideal starting point for optimization, offering the best 
probability of success. They work because they have worked before, and because they 
are familiar. You don’t have to think how to use a log-in panel that requests “user name” 
and “password,” because you have seen and used thousands of similar panels before.
The familiar is often unconsciously perceived as safe and easy; the unfamiliar as risky 
or difficult. Is it possible that there is a more effective solution than the user name/
password log-in box? Certainly there is, but to find it you may risk trying many 
poorly performing alternatives.
The rule I always apply is to use conventions wherever the design problem is familiar 
(such as where to place a logo or the “log out” link) and where a conventional solution 
already exists. That leaves more creative energy to apply to the truly unique problems 
that every design challenge presents, which include the big questions of audience and 
proposition that actually most greatly impact success.
So apply creative thought from start to finish to every aspect of your web design, take 
advantage of conventions that have been proven to work, but rely finally on the results 
of your own tests, because every web site’s design challenge is unique.
Test Your Best
Combine your creativity, insight, common sense, intuition, and experience to each 
new problem. But only try ideas that you have reason to think will work, avoiding 
random guesses. I would never advise testing any old dumb idea; you’ll probably 
waste time and money. For the best results, always strive to create a better solution, 
applying all the resources at your disposal (with just a dash of the unpredictable).
Of course, you should never assume that your own best idea is any good at all. You 
must always test, but test things you have reason to think will be effective.

112 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
In our team, we’ve coined the term “CICO” (which stands for “crap in, crap out”) to 
describe the effect of testing poor ideas. Especially when you start running tests on 
your site, it’s tempting to test a weak option for the thrill of seeing a result.
When doing tests, your objective is to improve on the original (control) solution. 
There’s barely any value in showing an idea that doesn’t perform as well as what you 
had before. It will most likely provide a negative learning experience, which may 
point in the direction of a better solution, but hasn’t carried you any nearer to that 
solution.
At the same time, don’t be afraid to experiment. Because of the way split-testing 
works, you will always be able to observe performance, and respond quickly by kill-
ing off poorly performing options and moving forward what works. Provided you are 
not practicing CICO, any detrimental effects will be short-lived but the gains you can 
make will stay with you.
Attention and Momentum
Attention is the currency of your web site. When new visitors arrive, they have a cer-
tain amount of attention. They use that attention to scan the landing page, looking for 
one thing. If they find that one thing, it generates more attention. If they do not find 
the one thing, their attention may run out. If the visitors get to the point that they 
believe they are more likely to find what they want by going back to the search results 
than by persevering with your web site, you have lost them.
The exact flavor of the one thing depends on the visitors’ current goal. Do they 
want to find the product they’re looking for, to get the answer to a question, or to be 
entertained? (If you have built your web site around the new multiplicity model, you 
should have a pretty good idea, because you know which funnel they arrived on.)
Whatever the visitor’s precise goal may be, the one thing is always to answer one 
simple question: “Am I in the right place?”
That’s it. Answering that one tiny question is the only thing your web page needs to 
do. The more quickly and decisively you can answer the question, the more attention 
your pages will generate, and the more people you will keep interested so that they 
continue to move up the Awareness Ladder.
The challenge, of course, is how to answer the question most effectively. That’s what 
the rest of the book is about.

Step Three: Optimizing Conversions through the Funnel ❘ 113
Every Page Is an Advertisement
I would like you to view every page on your site as an advertisement. What is it an ad 
for? For the next step, whatever that is.
Consider that it is the job of every page you publish simply to get people to move to 
the next step. To do that, you must first get their attention, in the same way that an 
advertisement must get the attention of a passerby, television viewer, or newspaper 
reader, so that it can deliver its message.
Once you have their attention, you must help them find the answer to their question, 
“Am I in the right place?” When they find the clue that they are going to get what 
they want, their attention is reinvigorated, and they take the next step forward. Pro-
vided you can keep them moving forward step-by-step, you can eventually help them 
achieve their goal (and your goal).
note ​Some people say you have seven seconds to persuade people to keep reading. 
I don’t know if that’s true for your site, but it is shown that plenty of visitors leave with-
out even scrolling, which means many pages fail at the first hurdle. They don’t manage 
to get visitors’ attention even to get them to start interacting.
Reese’s Pieces
Reese’s Pieces is a type of candy made by the U.S. brand Hershey. In the movie E.T.—
the Extra Terrestrial, the central character Elliot used a trail of the candy to lure E.T. 
from the shed in the yard all the way to his bedroom.
The key point is that getting an alien out of a shed all the way into the house and up 
the stairs is a difficult task. What Elliot did brilliantly was to break the big action for 
E.T. into a sequence of much smaller actions. All the alien needed to do was to move a 
few inches and it would get another small reward. Each commitment was small, and 
offered a clear reward, but together they constituted a huge achievement for the boy.
This approach can help you deliver big goals through your web site, simply by break-
ing a large commitment into smaller, easier steps. Each page just needs to engage the 
visitors and help them find the next step along the path to what they want. Then repeat 
on the next page. By achieving these simple steps, you will minimize leaks from your 

114 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
site, and have an alien in your bedroom before you know it! (Acknowledgment to Ben 
Jesson of Conversion Rate Experts, who I first heard tell this analogy.)
When you have identified a structure for addressing the needs of more segments, the 
challenge is to get as many visitors as possible to proceed up the ladder.
The Three Elements of Conversion
For a page to get visitors to proceed to the next step, it must let them know they are in 
the right place. To do that, three things need to happen.
These are the three critical elements of conversion:
Get their Attention.
u
u
Keep them Engaged.
u
u
Call them to Action.
u
u
All three elements must be present. You cannot get someone to engage with a page 
unless you quickly capture their attention first. Then, you need to communicate your 
message to get them to the point that they want to take the next step, which is your 
call to action.
Get Their Attention
As the Awareness Ladder shows, there is little value in presenting a proposition if 
people are not ready to appreciate what is on offer. Any proposition must directly 
match the immediate need of prospects at that level of awareness.
If Joe speaks to people who are not aware that any treatments for baldness exist and 
advertises “Get 50% off Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro!,” he will not catch the attention of 
many folks there, because they have never heard of his product and have no idea how 
it can benefit them.
If he addresses them with “New Treatments Available for Baldness,” he will catch the 
eye of people who are ready to take that step in awareness.
Joe’s job at that point is not to get those people to buy straightaway! That would be 
unrealistic—and unsuccessful. Remember, every prospect has to pass at some point 

The Three Elements of Conversion ❘ 115
from Step 0 to Step 5 on the Awareness Ladder, and through every step along the way 
in sequence.
All Joe has to do is to get folks to take the next step up the ladder. Because the step is 
small, Joe knows he does not have to sell. He can simply offer what’s available at the 
next step, and let the next step do its job.
What gets attention is a clear proposition that speaks directly to the viewer on an 
emotional level. A good proposition has the following properties:
Specific
u
u
—Speaks to the present concerns or desires of each specific market
You-oriented
u
u
—All about the viewer, not about us
Clear benefit
u
u
—“What’s in it for me?”
Immediate gain
u
u
—Offer me a solution to what I want now.
Each stage of your visitors’ journey starts with an appealing proposition that seems 
to speak to them and to offer something they want. The next chapter is packed with 
examples and ideas for transforming your propositions into attention magnets.
Keep Them Engaged
Now that you have someone’s attention, you need to get them to proceed toward their 
next goal. The appeal alone may not be enough. What else do they need to know in 
order to be convinced to complete the journey (or this stage of the journey)?
Here, you are deep in the magnificent realm of advertising copywriting, among great 
libraries of knowledge learned from thousands of split tests in newspaper, mail-order, 
radio, and television advertisements.
There has been so much learning in this area that marketers long ago agreed on some 
fundamental laws. These laws work over and over in all media, online as well as off-
line. If you are hoping to deliver optimal results online you must fully understand 
what these laws are, and how they work, so that you can test their effectiveness in 
your own campaigns.
The laws of content writing boil down to basic common sense. Unless you keep pro-
viding more reasons to proceed, people will lose momentum and may give up before 
they reach the next goal.

116 ❘ Chapter 6: Making Your Site Sell
Basically, keeping momentum is a question of ensuring people keep discovering stuff 
that interests them. Techniques for building and maintaining momentum fall into 
two groups:
Affirming the positive signs
u
u
 that people need to see
Resolving their concerns
u
u
—fears, doubts, and objections
What do people expect to see that will confirm they are heading in the right direction 
to get what they want?
They must identify with the proposition as it unfolds, and feel it really applies 
u
u
to them.
They must also continue to get the right impression of the brand, building a 
u
u
sense of trust.
They must see confirmation that their specific requirements are met.
u
u
They must see signs that satisfy their doubts and concerns.
u
u
They must be kept aware that their goal is in sight without being knocked off 
u
u
track.
All these aspects provide momentum, which we need to build in order to keep people 
moving forward through the steps to the final goal.
Chapter 8 explores in detail dozens of techniques for building momentum.
Call Them to Action
Without action now you have no action ever. It is in human nature to put off action to 
a later time. We cannot afford that. There is only the present moment. If your web site 
does not convince someone to convert right now, it is unlikely to get them to convert 
next time.
This is the final commitment you require of your visitors. If they do not have enough 
momentum to complete the final step, they will fail. If they have built up enough 
momentum, the final stage should have a good conversion rate.
It is always possible to invite people to take the action you want them to take, pro-
vided you follow a few basic principles:
The call to action must 
u
u
exist, and be clear and bold. If you don’t ask, you  
won’t get.

The Three Elements of Conversion ❘ 117
The 
u
u
timing must be right. You may be a great catch, but if you walk into the 
bar and propose marriage to the first woman you see, you will not succeed, 
because she does not know enough about you to make an informed choice. 
You can only call to action from the top of the Awareness Ladder.
You need to have provided enough positive signs and resolved enough negative 
u
u
concerns for the action to appear reasonable. If there are still “what ifs” in the 
prospect’s mind, those might give reasons not to act.
There must be enough 
u
u
momentum. The prospect must feel confident enough 
in the offering that it makes sense to take the action offered.
Finally, any call to action must provide enough urgency to induce action 
u
u
now.
Chapter 9 presents all the techniques you need to create powerful calls to action.


get their attention
Th e sole purpose of your web site is to deliver complete propositions to your target vis-
itors. Th e form of any proposition is, “Th is is how what we do addresses your need.” A 
proposition is the bridge between what they want and what you do. It should be pres-
ent from the fi rst glance, and should get stronger as the visitor continues to engage.
If you have defi ned a landing matrix and created web pages for each step on the 
Awareness Ladder in each target market, you have a massive advantage, because you 
have already identifi ed both your visitors’ need and level of awareness.
From whatever point they enter any funnel, your web site must carry them forward, 
step by step, all the way through to the goal you want them to reach. Depending on 
the page, the next step may be a goal conversion, or a step up the Awareness Ladder.
Th e fi rst thing any page must do is quickly get across the message, “Yes, you are in the 
right place.” Everyone, whether they have just arrived from search engine results, fol-
lowed a link from another site, or proceeded from a previous page on your site, needs 
to see evidence that they are going to fi nd what they are looking for. Th is gives you 
attention currency to help carry the visitor forward to the next step.
When you have designed your site in the concentric model, you already know the 
awareness step of each individual page, which gives you a great advantage. You will 
have a very good idea of what your visitors are already aware of upon arrival and what 
they are looking for right now. Th at helps you show them exactly what they need to 
see to know they’re on track. If you already have a matrix of landing pages targeted to 
specifi c search terms, you may even know the precise language they used to fi nd you, 
so it’s great to use that language.
To have any chance at converting visitors to a goal, you must fi rst convince them that 
they are likely to get what they want from your web site. Unless they are compelled to 
look further, no message will succeed.
Th is chapter gives you a complete toolkit of techniques for grabbing a visitor’s atten-
tion and answering that golden question, so that you maximize the attention you 
need in order to deliver your proposition.
ChaPter 7

120 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
Optimization Discipline
You will notice that I have not started to address the functional techniques of opti-
mization, how to test one approach against another. The reason is that, before you 
start to optimize, you should start from your very best first guess, using the very best 
intelligence available. There is no point testing how badly your existing pages perform 
today; your analytics should tell you that.
Sure, it can be quite exciting to see rapid gains, but if you know you can do better, you 
should use “better” as your starting point. I invite you to work through the next four 
chapters thoroughly, and apply as many of their lessons as possible, before you start 
running optimization experiments.
Walk the Road
Ken McCarthy tells marketers to get out of their cars and “walk the road” from the cus-
tomer’s perspective. You are familiar with your products. You may be bored with seeing 
the same messages every day. But until you slow down and follow the process from start 
to finish—as your customers will experience it—you can fail to notice critical details.
When you notice a step where people are failing to proceed, ask:
What do they need that is not there? (A 
u
u
hole in the road.)
What’s there that should not be? (A 
u
u
rock in the road.)
As you read through the following chapters, compare the guidance with what your 
site does today, compile a hit-list of improvements, and then apply the changes in 
broad strokes to your web site.
Repair First, Then Optimize
Start by looking out for the most obvious rocks and holes. When you start making 
changes, each fix should produce immediate tangible improvements. I would not really 
call this optimization, any more than fixing a broken car engine can be called tuning.
Later, once the road is in good enough repair that most people can complete a journey, 
look at making the journey more appealing and compelling. As each improvement 
takes your site a step nearer optimal performance, the Law of Diminishing Returns 
comes into play, and you may notice that advances get both slower and smaller. That 
can be a good sign that you are in the business of optimization.

Optimization Discipline ❘ 121
Failure to grab attention is often one of the quickest and easiest holes to fill. If people 
are simply failing to interact with a page, failure to get attention is the first thing to 
look at. Look for high exit rates combined with low time spent on pages as a sign that 
a page is falling at the first hurdle. If a page does not engage visitors, it cannot convert 
them to the next step.
Draw on Outside Influences
When you find a proposition that really appeals on the right level, do not be too 
proud to copy its format or general appeal (although not its exact words—you need to 
craft your own language to address each market segment’s precise needs).
 “Until you’ve got a better answer, you copy.”
Helmut Krone (advertising art director with DDB)
Knowing when to re-use proven effective patterns is one of the key skills of good mar-
keters. Do not think that your proposition needs to be totally unique.
This principle applies to everything in marketing and design. When there is an exist-
ing model that works well, use it, unless you know a better way. Do not waste energy 
trying to reinvent conventional solutions. Save your creativity for the important work 
of understanding your market and their needs in depth, and to assess the best alter-
natives to test.
When Attention Comes Second
Not all pages necessarily need a strong attention-grabber. For many regular pages, 
all that is needed is to confirm you’re in the right place. If you click “Contact us” 
you expect “Contact us.” Click “King Size Memory Foam Mattress” and you expect 
instant confirmation you’re in the right place.
In these instances, the main heading should simply make the visitor think “Yes, here I 
am.” To get visitors to engage with the page, you may use secondary devices to catch their 
attention by highlighting key messages that do not belong in the most noticeable headline:
Add minor headings or a subhead (an additional, often longer, headline that 
u
u
follows the main headline).
Consider “pull-quotes” (callouts).
u
u
Highlight keywords in the body text using bold text or background colors.
u
u

122 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
warning ​Don’t make everything bold. I made all the body text in an article bold as 
a test, and the average time-on-page went down 15.8%, which suggested more people 
gave up reading.
Getting Attention: The Power of Appeal
When someone searches the Web for a solution to their needs, they don’t care about 
your company, your products, or their features. The only thing that matters is finding 
a solution to their own immediate need—“How is what you offer going to solve my 
problem?” So any message you show will be interpreted through the filter of “what’s 
in it for me?”
In advertising, an ad’s dominant message of “here’s what you want, right here” is 
called its appeal. You don’t want visitors to have to figure out why it may be worth 
their while to continue looking at a page. A message that is totally focused on telling 
prospects exactly what’s in it for them will bypass the need for any filtering and speak 
directly to their self-interest. The appeal should be immediately evident in the fea-
tures you notice first on the page—starting with its headline.
It is an unquestionable fact that the primary factor in successfully addressing any 
market is finding the right appeal. Twentieth-century marketers found that appeal is 
the single factor that has the greatest impact on the conversion rate of any promotion. 
John Caples reported one ad selling nineteen times the amount of another similar ad, 
the only major difference being the choice of appeal used.
“To discover the correct appeal is often difficult. There may be many wrong appeals and 
only one right one. If my advertising agent had a year in which to prepare a campaign 
for my product, I should be perfectly satisfied if he spent eleven months in search of the 
right appeal, and only month—or one week, for that matter—preparing the actual 
advertisements.”
John Caples, Tested Advertising Methods
The history of test-driven direct marketing and advertising provides a body of 
knowledge on what features motivate people to buy. I will take you through the most 
important rules, and provide examples from my own web designs and optimization 
experiments.

Get ting At tention: The Power of Appeal ❘ 123
Headlines Rule
One feature that I need to mention up front is the page’s headline. Tests show that the 
first thing people look for on web pages is text that confirms where they are. Pictures 
can have multiple meanings, whereas text is more specific.
So every web page should have one piece of text that stands out above all other text, 
making sure it gets read first. This headline should do two things:
It should confirm where you are (that is, in the right place).
u
u
It should grab your interest and give you a 
u
u
reason to look further.
The legacy of advertising copywriting provides a wealth of evidence on what types 
of headlines grab attention and compel people to read on. Several approaches have 
been proven to work and have become general laws. Such patterns apply to generating 
instant appeal in any medium.
note ​Many great books break down the art of headline writing, such as 
Breakthrough Advertising by Eugene Schwartz (Boardroom Classics, 1984), 
Tested Advertising Methods by John Caples (Prentice Hall, 1998), and Scientific 
Advertising by Claude Hopkins (Advertising Publications, 1966). I’ll relay some of the 
advice that I have found most useful in my own design and marketing.
The Purpose of a Headline
Headlines need to do only one thing, which is to get the prospect to engage with the 
next content on the page. Do not set out to tell the whole story in your headlines. A 
headline can never complete the whole step. They are the first course, designed to get 
your juices flowing.
If you tell too much, you may give the readers the impression that they do not need to 
read on, either because you have already answered their question, or because you have 
given them a reason to disqualify the page. So your headlines should do enough to get 
someone to read the next piece of content.
Hint at Value to Follow
If a headline gives away too much information, it may both create interest and fulfill 
that interest, without compelling the visitor to engage with the rest of the content.

124 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
Similarly, don’t expect your initial message to convince. All it needs to do is engage. 
Trying to achieve too much too early could be counter-productive.
A good rule of thumb for headlines is if your reader will think, “I can skim-read that, 
and come away with something useful.” Examples include:
“How to Attract The Perfect Partner”
u
u
“5 Proven Ways To Succeed at Interviews”
u
u
“How I Saved $4000 Tax—Legally”
u
u
Avoid Cleverness
It is very tempting to try to stimulate interest by being cryptic or intriguing. Avoid 
this temptation. Keeping it simple, bold, and direct will appeal to the most people.
“A great offer will do better than any amount of creative ideas.”
Drayton Bird
Intrigue can be an effective tool, but it is difficult to judge. An intriguing headline 
must suggest value to the reader, such as:
“One Thing I Wish I Knew Before I Bought A New Car”
u
u
“5 Money-Saving Tips Your Parents Didn’t Tell You”
u
u
“How I Doubled My Salary With One Phone Call”
u
u
“Tax Secrets the IRS Doesn’t Want You To Know”
u
u
Even when you do stimulate interest, ensure you target the visitor’s self-interest, not 
your own. The safest way to get attention is usually to go straight for the visitor’s self-
interest with a direct promise:
“Make Up To $300 Extra Per Week From Home—Risk-Free”
u
u
“10 Simple Tips That Could Double the Traffic to Your Web Site”
u
u
“The Best Hair-Loss Treatments Revealed”
u
u
I look for three major factors in crafting an appeal. This chapter addresses each of 
these factors and shows you when and how to use them to best effect:
Relevance
u
u
—This page should be appropriate to my present situation.
Self-interest
u
u
—It should offer me a quick solution to my immediate need.
Emotion
u
u
—It should engage with me on an emotional level.

Make Your Appeals Relevant ❘ 125
Look for one or two things that you believe will grab attention, and consider whether they 
can be formed into an interesting headline that contains some relevance, self-­interest, and 
emotion. You just need to do enough to get attention and start to build interest.
Researching Powerful Propositions
Before defining your proposition, a quick research exercise is to carry out a Google 
search for your keywords and look at the top pay-per-click results —results that 
advertisers are paying to include alongside the natural, organic results, and which are 
identified with the text “Sponsored link.” Look for what makes a compelling appeal.
I did Google searches for “reduce tax bill,” “discount silver jewelry,” and “weight 
loss.” The PPC results are shown in Figure 7-1. Because the top results are likely to 
come from the top-bidding ads, these are more likely to be profitable, which means 
they must generate clicks. Examine the appeals in these nine randomly selected ads. 
Notice how many work on an emotional level, appeal to self-interest, promise quick 
results, and prompt urgent action.
Figure 7-1 ​Survey paid ad results for hints on what appeals sell.
Make Your Appeals Relevant
If an appeal is going to get your attention, it has to be relevant to you. The more rele-
vant it seems to be, the more easily you will connect with it. So look for an appeal that 
is just broad enough to include the audience of this page, but no broader.
note ​An appeal that is too broad is like a Swiss Army knife. It has a knife, but not a 
good one, so it is not of interest to people who need a good knife. It has a saw, a mag-
nifying glass, and a pair of scissors, but these are all less useful than a dedicated tool. 
You will not get good results by offering the same generic proposition to a range of visi-
tors who need specific things.

126 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
Figure 7-2 shows the original headline of an e-commerce site together with my 
rewritten headline. The original text did not contain any direct benefits to the shop-
per. The rewrite added two benefits of buying towels from this supplier: good quality 
and low prices. The result was an instant 9.25% increase in sales. This is a useful start, 
because it is fairly relevant and says what’s in it for you, although it does not evoke 
emotion.
Figure 7-2 ​Simply altering the main heading increased sales  
from this e-commerce site’s home page by more than 9%  
(http://towelsdirect.co.uk).
The headline in Figure 7-2 gives quite a generic appeal. This may be appropriate for 
a home page, which deals with the site’s highest-level offering, low-cost towels. All 
landing pages should seek to be as specific as they can be, while still including the 
whole relevant audience. A diverse landing page strategy makes it far easier to be spe-
cific, which means less work and better results.
Target a Specific Market
For the towels site, the market is at Step 2. They know what they want: to save money 
buying towels and linens. The next step is to introduce this particular supplier or 
product, and its benefits. I would have a page dedicated to each target market (hotels, 
salons, nursing homes, and so on) that emphasizes each offering, such as “Cheap 
Quality Towels for Hairdressers,” and another for “Buy Bulk Linens for Nursing 
Homes Online.” Keyword research will provide the best keywords.
These landing pages can also go on to emphasize the supplier’s track record with the 
particular market segment. “We are the trusted supplier to over 300 salons” is far 
more powerful for a salon owner than a statement that does not speak to them so 
directly.
A headline announcing “Business Owners—Tips for Reducing Your Tax Bill” would 
appeal more directly to a business owner than just “Tips for Reducing Your Tax Bill.” 
The click-through rate may be lower, but the cost per click could also be lower and the 
conversion rate higher, making the campaign more cost-effective.

Make Your Appeals Relevant ❘ 127
Multiplicity Brings Pay-Per Click Savings
The benefits of multiplicity are magnified when you are buying your traffic through 
pay-per-click advertising using AdWords, Facebook, or any of the other networks. If 
you plan to drive traffic through pay-per-click advertising, focusing pages at specific 
profiles also helps you capitalize by matching more specific ad content to specific 
landing pages.
For example, if your proposition sells equipment for fly fishing, you will get much 
better results with ads targeted to “fly fishing tackle” than simply “fishing tackle.” 
Any clicks you get will be from people who want exactly what you have to offer. If 
your proposition is too broad, you will get clicks from prospects you cannot serve. 
The click costs money, and there is no sale.
If you address your content at specific roles, Facebook’s pay-per-click ads can be very 
powerful , being highly targetable to people’s profiles. Because individuals provide 
personal information to Facebook, you can write ad text to target users in certain 
positions. For example, showing “What Finance Directors Should Know About New 
Tax Law” only to people with that job title will get you much better click-through 
rates than focusing just on the offering.
Slicing and Dicing Your Offerings
It is possible to take this principle much further, deliberately slicing your offerings 
thinner in order to address even finer segments.
If I am looking for a supplier of used fly fishing tackle in Rochdale, and I see an ad 
promoting “Rochdale’s Biggest Supplier of Used Fly Fishing Tackle Supplies,” I am 
very likely to click the ad, because I believe it’s local to me. And if the page I land on 
has the same title, I will instantly know I am in the right place, and I am likely to 
browse further.
Even if the store supplies all kinds of fishing tackle over a large geographical area, it 
could achieve much better return on investment through segmenting its audience in 
this way, so that the ads and landing pages seem to be addressed directly to more dis-
tinct groups of visitors.
note ​Consider what factors you can use to slice your offerings to speak more directly 
to your prospects. Go beyond the logical groupings that are immediately obvious to 
you, and consider the external perspective. What could the people who need what you 
offer conceivably be searching for today?

128 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
It is proven that focusing your appeal on a specific market segment generates a feel-
ing of belonging. If your target market is overworked teachers, address your appeal 
to them directly. A headline like “Overwhelmed in the Classroom?” will connect 
instantly with that specific market and exclude less relevant segments.
One of the most effective ways to get someone’s attention is to address them person-
ally. You have to look no further than direct mail that lands in your mailbox. When 
something has your name on it, you are likely to pay attention.
note ​The most effective ads are those that say the equivalent of “Hey you! Yes, you 
sir, in the green shirt!”
Any communication that seems to have been written just for you will merit further 
investigation, because it appeals to your subject of primary interest—you!
For example, I could describe this book as “Packed with tips on increasing conversion 
rates of web sites,” which is all very well. It’s an accurate enough description, but it’s 
not going to grab attention.
But if I know more about you, I can focus my message more on you and your inter-
ests, by saying perhaps “I’ll show you how you can turn more of your web site visitors 
into paying customers.” Does that work better? (Do you see how many of the words in 
that second sentence begin with the letter “y”?)
We are all human beings, seeking connection and meaning through relationships. 
When a brand or a message speaks directly to you, or seems to reflect where you are, 
you are likely to identify with it as yours.
Check out your bathroom cabinet or kitchen cupboard for products that speak 
directly to a customer in a clearly defined segment. If you see “Specially formulated 
for people with curly hair,” it seems to make a promise that it will perform better than 
another less-focused product. (It doesn’t, of course, make that promise.)
When there are many competitors in a market, the simple linguistic act of distin-
guishing your offering from the rest can be enough to give people the one positive 
reason they need to choose yours.
In just a quick look around my house I found the following physical products:
A hair product called “Brilliant Brunette”—which would probably clean blond 
u
u
hair just fine.

Make Your Appeals Relevant ❘ 129
A toothpaste just for 4–6 year olds—which would also work for 3-year olds or 
u
u
bigger kids.
“Family size” orange juice—which is no more appropriate for a family than it 
u
u
is for someone who just drinks a lot of orange juice.
The only reason the orange juice is marketed as “Family size” is to make it appeal 
more to someone buying for a family (which is the majority of the market) than the 
next carton that doesn’t make that connection. It is no more suitable than the next 
product. There is no intrinsic family-appropriate-ness about the juice. It’s just plain 
old orange juice. But it is made to seem more appropriate just by the use of language 
that isolates a market segment.
note ​It has been proven that print ads can double their conversion rates through the 
simple technique of mentioning the host publication. If an ad runs in the Daily Bugle, 
adding a corner flash that says “Exclusive to Daily Bugle readers!” will connect readers 
with the ad because it applies to them (obviously). Even someone who does not identify 
himself as a Daily Bugle reader must surely be reading the Bugle at that moment, so 
will not be put off by the exclusive claim.
In Figure 7-3, I rewrote the main heading text on this software marketing site. The 
original said “ZEFYR—ONLINE ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE.” The alternative 
heading removed the caps and changed the text to “Complete Online Accounting 
Package for Small Businesses.”
This small change converted 15.4% more visitors to subscribe. Why? I think the main 
reason is because small-business owners identify that the product is for them.
Figure 7-3 ​More accurate targeting on a main heading increased the conversion rate by 15.4%.

130 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
You-Oriented Language
Another obvious but overlooked technique is simply to talk to the visitor as “you,” 
instead of talking about yourself all the time. (Who do they care about?)
Figure 7-4 shows the results of rewriting the introductory text on our agency’s home 
page. The new copy is much more about “you.” Notice how it also stresses benefits 
over what we do.
The two factors tend to go hand-in-hand. Writing you-oriented copy requires step-
ping into the visitor’s point of view, where features appear as benefits.
Figure 7-4 ​Rewriting this introduction to be more you-oriented and benefit-rich increased click 
through by 10.8%.
Match the Promise of the Link
One of the early warning signs of low conversion rates is question marks floating 
above visitors’ heads. A great way to create question marks in people’s minds is when 
a page does not match the promise of the link they clicked. You can’t do much about 
links from other people’s pages, but ensure that any links from your own pages are 
fulfilled when the next page loads.
If I click a link that offers “Ten Easy Tips for Losing Weight,” I expect to be able to see 
immediate evidence of the tips as soon as I arrive on the next page. If I click “Con-
tact us,” I expect something that is clearly a contact page, not something clever and 
cryptic.
If I get something else I might assume the site is broken. When a page shows me just 
what I expect to find, there is no mental friction and all my attention is available to 
get the page’s unique message.

Make Your Appeals Relevant ❘ 131
Figure 7-5 shows the top section of a page design for a site that sells ranch land across 
the USA. Each state would have its own landing page. When you arrive on the page, 
you expect the page to announce exactly what’s there for you. Many pages could ben-
efit from a simple, obvious “You are here” statement.
Figure 7-5 ​My home page design for a site that… well, I’ll let you work it out.
Distinguish Your Offering
Clearly demonstrating your unique value proposition (UVP) can be a great way to 
grab visitors’ attention. Your UVP is a description that summarizes what sets your 
offering apart from alternatives.
It should positively differentiate you from the competition. A good way to distin-
guish positive differentiation is to ask whether a competitor may conceivably 
say the opposite. If no one would take the opposite position, you are not positively 
differentiating.
For example, if one of your values is “exclusive,” this can be a positive value, because 
someone else may claim “popular.” If one of your values is “cheap,” someone else may 
have “high-value.” Being a small-scale boutique producer is opposite to being a large-
scale producer, and both are valid.
However, if you promote the value of “high quality,” this is not a positive differen-
tiator, because no competitor would claim “low quality.” Do not claim reliability as 
a core value, because no one would claim to be unreliable. It is pointless to claim 
“desirable” because no competitor would identify with “undesirable.”
If you can identify a strong UVP, make it instantly getable to every visitor. The most 
common way to do this is to use it for your strap line or slogan. My redesign for Atom 

132 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
(see Figure 7-6) uses the strap line “Simple online CRM and job management for 
Building Contractors.” “Simple” is a positive differentiator because competitors may 
promote the power or comprehensiveness of their functionality.
Note how the target market is mentioned specifically in the strap line. Instead of 
“Home,” the first item on the navigation menu says exactly what the product is and 
who it’s for. And the page’s headline shouts out the proposition.
Figure 7-6 ​The strap line, headline, subhead, and main navigation all help to distinguish the target 
audience.
Try these tips to help you focus on identifying a great unique value proposition:
Look at your current competitors. Write words that describe what is distinct 
u
u
about them. For each word, write down the equivalent for your business.
What can you say about your offerings that your competitors can’t say?
u
u
What do your prospects not yet know about you that might give them confi-
u
u
dence in you?
In what ways do you delight your existing customers? What nice things do 
u
u
they say about you? What gives them pleasant surprises? Do you promote 
these things today?
Where do you provide exceptional service for customers (and neglect to talk 
u
u
about it)?
Use as many of these distinguishing features to differentiate your proposition from 
the crowd, and also to differentiate your prospects by their needs and expectations.

Self-Interest ❘ 133
Write for the Undecided Prospect
Anyone who comes to any web page fits into one of three categories:
Those who are determined to proceed to the next step, if it is possible
u
u
Those who are not going to proceed, whatever happens
u
u
Those who 
u
u
may proceed to the next step
When thinking about relevance, assume that everyone who visits every page is in the 
latter category—the “maybe” group, and write just for them.
Creating content only for the “maybes” is not going to have any negative impact on 
the “yes” or “no” groups, and it provides the key to optimize your conversions.
The “yes” group is going to click through to the next page anyway, so you do not need 
to create content for them. The “no” group is not going to proceed. They may just be 
coming to find a specific bit of information, collecting pictures, or researching prices 
for someone else. Whatever the reason, they are not in the market to be converted to 
the next step, so you should not write for them either.
Going back to Joe and his Miracle Hair-Gro, instead of saying “Buy my product—it 
really works!” he can refer to his landing matrix and craft a message specifically for 
a particular market (middle-aged men who are starting to go bald) and a particular 
level of awareness (know of his product, but do not trust its effectiveness). Joe might 
write, “How Miracle Hair-Gro Stopped Me Looking Old Before My Time.”
Self-Interest
The second critical factor in creating appeals to capture attention is to make it appeal 
directly to the prospect’s self-interest. We are all motivated to act in our own best 
interest. Telling visitors exactly what’s in it for them is the number one way to get 
their attention.
note ​There is a school of thought that every choice we make is based on what we 
think will increase our own personal happiness. Actions that at first appear selfless, 
like giving money to a stranger, are done in order to get a feeling of satisfaction. It is 
possible to see payoffs even in apparently self-destructive choices.

134 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
Remember to focus the language of your appeal on “you” (the visitor), not on “us.” No 
one cares about your point of view, unless it benefits them directly, so get into theirs. 
Make it your goal to delight your customers by giving them just what they want to 
hear. You can’t convert prospects by putting your needs before theirs. Only the belief 
that they are going to solve their needs, problems, and desires can trigger action.
Your prospects’ needs are simple. Avoid the temptation to over-complicate or be 
clever. Your job is not to impress yourself, just give your market what they want.
“That which is written to please the writer rarely pleases the reader.”
Samuel Johnson
Here are a few examples of targeting a headline on what’s in it for the reader. See how 
they make the proposition immediately interesting and relevant to the audience:
“Understanding Camera Metering” to “How To Master Camera Metering”
u
u
“Why ProductX?” to “How ProductX Will Help You Work Faster”
u
u
“Why StyleY is Cool” to “If you code AJAX, StyleY will change your life”
u
u
“1000s of Free Fonts” to “Download 10,000 Fonts With 1 Click”
u
u
“26 Great New Web Apps” to “26 Must-Have Web Apps You Never Heard 
u
u
About”
Visitors are looking to you to give them something to get their interest, in order to 
be encouraged to read on. Remember that your target visitors (that is, the undecided 
ones) do want to be in the right place, and they are open to being interested. All your 
page needs to do is to provide enough interest to persuade them there is value on 
offer.
Because we look for noticeable text to confirm where we are, and that text is usually 
the focal point of the page (which should be the beginning of the page’s unique con-
tent) this section also focuses on techniques for writing interesting headlines.
“What’s in It for Me?”
No one cares about what you do. All they care about is how it will benefit them. If you 
find any of your marketing messaging describes what you do, read it through the eyes 
of a potential customer, and ask “What’s in it for me?” If there is no benefit to the cus-
tomer, flip it so there is, or get rid of it.

Self-Interest ❘ 135
For example, in Figure 7-7, we simply changed a few small elements to the page on 
SkinnerInc.com that explains to potential sellers how they can sell through Skinner 
to be more relevant to the seller, and instantly generated a 213% increase in downloads 
of the evaluation form.
We changed the heading “Selling at Auction” to “Consigning to Auction is 
u
u
Easy with Skinner.” Easy is a benefit, and the change of focus helps make the 
process feel less remote.
We switched the two photos showing people’s backs to a single photo showing 
u
u
an expert doing an evaluation, which feels more accessible and human.
We changed the lower heading from “Determining Auction Estimates and the 
u
u
Appropriate Auction(s) for Your Property” to “How we Evaluate your Prop-
erty,” which is easier to understand.
Finally, we added an extra call to action button for “Get a Free Evaluation 
u
u
Today.”
The combined effect of these small changes is to help the reader believe that it is easy 
to go down the offered route.
Figure 7-7 ​A few simple changes to this page generated a massive 213% increase in conversions.

136 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
Promise to Solve a Problem
What specific need does your offering propose to solve? Addressing that need directly 
and offering the promise of a solution will speak to the prospect’s immediate concern 
and trigger an emotional response.
If the benefit is saving time, focus your whole appeal around that. If the need is to 
save money, reduce stress, cure an ailment, avoid fines, or reduce risks, let your entire 
message resonate clearly on the specific solution. The headline in Figure 7-8 tells the 
visitor exactly what they can do on this site, and promises a specific result.
Figure 7-8 ​This home page headline makes a strong promise.
Benefits
Whatever the proposition, it is benefits, not features, that hook visitors’ attention. 
Benefits fall into a few broad categories, including financial gain, saving time, increas-
ing personal attractiveness, having fun, improving self-esteem, or being able to do 
something you couldn’t achieve before.
It is critical to encourage visitors to take action today. This is easier when you give 
them a benefit that is quick and easy. The promise of getting what I want today is 
more likely to get me to act now than some future benefit.
Count the number of benefits in my design for Surfulater.com in Figure 7-9. The page 
opens with a strong you-oriented, immediate, and benefit-laden headline: “Capture and 
Find the Content You Need… instantly!” It follows with a sequence of minor headings 
that address specific benefits. “Save Anything Instantly,” “Retrieve Instantly,” “Edit & 
Annotate Freely,” “Easy to Manage,” and “Share it Around” are all punchy benefits that 
could catch the attention of a prospect with a specific need in mind, leading to the call 
to action, “Try it Now FREE,” to which the reasonable response should be, “Why not!”

Self-Interest ❘ 137
Figure 7-9 ​The Surfulater.com home page is loaded with benefits.
Benefits Appeal, Not Features
As I explained in Chapter 3, if your messages present only features, try flipping them 
to benefits. Go the extra mile to connect “what it does” to “what it does for you.” 
Instead of listing benefits, evoke them emotionally by helping your visitors visualize 
how much easier their life will be. How will the benefit impact the life of the reader?

138 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
In Figure 7-10, visitors arrive at the site, a service that empowers individuals to 
cut their own debt, with a single clear problem. It grabs attention immediately by 
strongly asserting, “Yes you can!”
Figure 7-10 ​My design for a self-service debt management site answers the immediate personal  
question with powerful and direct appeal.
More examples of flipping features to benefits in headlines:
Same-day delivery (feature) becomes a benefit: “You can relax, knowing your 
u
u
goods will arrive by 5pm.”
Server up-time (feature) becomes a benefit: “While you focus on your custom-
u
u
ers, we’ll be working to ensure your server is online 24/7.”
Long battery life (feature) becomes “Don’t worry if you have to jump on a last-
u
u
minute flight. Our laptop battery will take you from London to New York—
and back again.”
Great customer service (which is still a feature) becomes a personal benefit: 
u
u
“Our award-winning on-board team will ensure you arrive relaxed and ready 
for the day ahead.”

Self-Interest ❘ 139
Low prices (feature) become “With the $500 you’ll save by buying from us, you 
u
u
could take the family away on a surprise vacation.”
Double-taped seams (feature) become “Whether you’re sailing offshore, trek-
u
u
king to base camp, or watching your child’s soccer match, our double-taped 
seams ensure you stay warm and dry all day.”
Put Benefits Before Features
Notice how many items in the preceding list start with the benefit, and then associate 
the feature. It is the benefit that grabs my attention by connecting emotionally with 
my imagination. The feature should follow, creating a connection in my mind that the 
benefit is a consequence of the feature.
This simple connection helps create desire for the product on offer. If a web user is 
comparing a few alternatives, she will assign more value to the one that offers her a 
personal vision, that the benefit will somehow enhance her life. Other products may 
have the exact same features, but unless they are served to her as emotive benefits, 
they will not seem as compelling.
My home page design for an online bed store, as shown in Figure 7-11, leads with 
a reassuring promise “You can sleep well.” The headline is a simple, direct benefit, 
which has two meanings, suggesting you will get a good night’s sleep on our comfort-
able beds, and also that you can rest easy because you can trust this vendor. There are 
no features in the headline, because the site has a wide range of products on offer. But 
this high-level benefit neatly applies to everything they sell.
AddAction is a low-cost but high-quality hosting provider, competing in a tough market. 
In my preparatory interview, we explored what its existing clients love about the service.

before explaining how it may be achieved through one of their range of products.

The company had recently received the following message from a happy customer: 
“I submitted my ticket and 9 minutes later the issue was resolved. The best support 
ever!” To me, that kind of passion is pure marketing gold, so I made it the focal point 
of their new home page design, as shown in Figure 7-12.
Figure 7-12 ​Instead of competing on features in this packed hosting sector, this home page design 
suggests important benefits (support) that connect more directly with the visitor.

When It’s OK to Lead with Features
Sometimes it might be appropriate for a high-level page (such as a home page or 
section page) to mention features. For example, if your keyword research suggests 
that there is a significant market looking for “exhibition experts,” you may lead with 
that descriptive feature, provided you then go on to highlight your benefits, as in 
Figure 7-13.
Figure 7-13 ​Apply common sense. If you have a market that’s looking for features, by all means lead 
with matching text on landing pages.

142 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
Emotion
“People choose to buy based on emotion and then justify with logic” is one of the 
fundamental laws of sales. The buying decision is usually already made emotionally 
before logic comes into consideration, whether we are aware of it or not.
note ​Rational thought and emotion occur in different parts of the brain. Emotional 
responses actually happen faster than thought, so psychologists tell us that emotion 
influences more of our choices than we imagine.
It is tempting to rely on facts, but information is not the key to prompting action. 
Always look for emotional reasons that would compel a visitor to proceed. You can 
give all the reasons you like for why something makes sense, but unless people con-
nect emotionally with the idea, they will not take action. Emotions, like love, fear, 
attraction, and hope trigger action in ways that ideas alone cannot.
Features are in the realm of logic, but benefits touch us personally and are in the 
realm of emotion. We actually make buying choices based on emotions, then justify 
our choice with reason. So it is benefits that cause us to choose to act. Without ben-
efits to connect with we are unlikely to engage with a proposition. We may then also 
need more solid information to reinforce our choice.
For example, instead of a generic proposition like “Flowers delivered,” see how the 
following appeals qualify their target market, solve a problem, and offer the buyer 
tangible benefits:

u
u

Demonstrating emotions like enthusiasm, passion, and commitment will evoke simi-
lar responses in your reader. Don’t shy away from letting your own emotion show in 
your web site copy. Your customers are human, and they respond like humans, which 
means they are dominated by their emotions.

Emotion ❘ 143
Figure 7-14 shows a large headline I created for the home page of a life coach. The 
text “Live your life fully. Enjoy true success. Love every minute” works entirely in 
the emotional realm. Who would not accept the offer of these benefits? Because the 
services and benefits a life coach can offer can be so broad, this introduction sets out 
to make a bold claim that inspires and creates enthusiasm at a high level. If prospects 
connect with the emotions on display and are inspired, they will look further.
Figure 7-14 ​These promises speak directly to the emotional results on offer.
note ​Simply adding quote marks to a headline often increases believability and con-
versions, because it suggests the statement is coming from a real person.
Figure 7-15 shows the content on our agency’s contact page before and after a rewrite. 
The page used to invite the visitor to get in touch, in a businesslike but aloof tone. 
When we made it all about “you” (with seven mentions compared to two previously), 
and added a photo of our London sales office, conversions leaped by 94.7%.
Show the End Result
An easy shortcut to emotional connection is to show visitors a picture of the goal they 
want to reach. We are motivated by the promise of an easier or more enjoyable life, 
and it is this vision that keeps us moving forward. Showing the goal reached helps 
keep the visitors’ eyes on the prize, which can soften the cost of whatever they have to 
do to reach it.

144 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
Figure 7-15 ​When we changed our agency’s contact page from dry facts to include a more personal 
connection, nearly twice as many people responded.
For example, visitors to the BankLoans.com home page, shown in Figure 7-16, are 
looking for the possibility of buying their home. My redesign connects with the visi-
tors’ end goal by showing the image of a person moving to a new home with a smile 
on her face. This image connects with their personal desire and gives a strong signal 
that they are in the right place to get what they want.
Fear
Fear can be a strong motivating emotion, but it is most effective when you can make 
the pain of the fear immediately present, and offer instant relief.
“Are You Giving Away $$$ Every Month?”
u
u
“Hurry! Get Yours Before They’re All Gone!”
u
u
“Protect Your Family From Deadly EMF Radiation Today”

Emotion ❘ 145
Figure 7-16 ​Showing the end result, moving home with a smile. Note how the emotion in the image 
works in partnership with the main headline, which offers specific and immediate benefits.
As advertising on tobacco products has shown, the fear of a possible future negative 
event is not a strong motivator. Human nature is more inclined to act on something 
for immediate benefit or relief than some potential risk. The exception to this is where 

146 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
the future problems would impact others, such as dependent family, so insurance 
advertising uses the fear approach to good effect.
Reversing the Promise
It is hard to make a clever headline that generates good results. When you are work-
ing against the clock with limited attention currency, you generally do not want to 
risk making people think too much. However, one approach that can work to get 
people to read on is to tell them why the offer may not be relevant to them!
For example, when writing copy to promote a course in more effective life manage-
ment, I came up with the headline in Figure 7-17: “If You’re Getting Everything You 
Want from Life, Don’t Read This!” Such appeals may stimulate a sense of exclusion, 
which we naturally want to overcome.
Figure 7-17 ​Most people would admit they are not getting absolutely everything they want  
from life, so this teasing reverse inclusion will exclude few prospects.
Credibility
Whatever emotions you stimulate in your appeal, you should sail as close as you can 
to the wind, but keep your appeal credible enough to merit further investigation.
Ken McCarthy says that we all have two built-in filters, which the marketer must 
avoid tripping. One is the “So what?” filter and the other is the “Nonsense!” filter. 
Make sure that every statement you make will get through both of these filters.
A common way to trip the “So what?” filter is to ask a rhetorical question. Rhetorical 
questions are questions that do not require an answer. Questions will only get people 
to read if they require an answer. A frequent mistake I encounter is the “Why Should 
You Use Us?” headline. This tends to be answered with, “I don’t know. It’s your web 
site. You should be telling me.”
Two tips for keeping on the right side of people’s “Nonsense!” filter are to back up any 
claims you make with facts and evidence, and to acknowledge possible doubts in the 
reader’s mind (for example, “Like you, I was doubtful that a service that seemed so 
cheap could deliver the quality I was used to, so I asked a bunch of questions…”).

Designing for At tention ❘ 147
Designing for Attention
You need to ensure your attention-grabbing content is the first thing people notice. If 
you draw someone’s attention to something, be sure you want them to read it.
When thinking about what your web page needs to communicate, you should now have 
a good idea of which values or concepts should be prominent. A few basic principles for 
graphic design will help you to get the attention you need, cleanly and efficiently:
Getability
u
u
Noticeability
u
u
Navigation
u
u
Imagery
u
u
Look and feel
u
u
Getability
If visitors can find the signs to answer the golden question (“Am I in the right place?”) 
in the first few seconds, they are likely to decide that moving forward offers better 
odds than moving backward, which means you have their attention. If they do not 
find those clues, retreating may seem the better option, and your attention-seeking 
has failed.
I call the quality of how easy it is to “get” a page’s purpose getability.
The page’s first job is to say “Yes—you are probably in the right place.” When a page 
has good getability, visitors will say “I get it, and I know what to do next,” without 
really needing to think. The signs they need will jump straight out. This means those 
key clues need to be the first things they notice.
What visitors need to see to know they’re in the right place depends on the context. 
Consider where they are on the Awareness Ladder, what they are trying to achieve, 
and how they may have arrived at the page.
In just a thin slice of time, your site has to come across as the right kind of site, with 
the right subject matter and tone. (Of course “right” might mean cheap or expensive, 
professional or amateur, depending on the values you want to communicate.)
All you need to do for high getability is to present plain, obvious communication. 
Any cryptic, conflicting, or misleading messages will cause mental friction, reduce 
getability, and damage your conversion rates.

148 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
One of the most effective ways to increase getability is to strip away things that are 
not required. Identify the features that can help answer “Am I in the right place?” and 
try removing anything that does not. The result has to be more attention available for 
the content that matters, which can only increase your chance of getting someone’s 
attention. The pure simplicity of the Google search page, with one primary function 
that dominates attention, could be one of the main factors in its success.
You can simplify any aspect of content or design, including layout. Figure 7-18 shows 
a test we ran on a previous version of the “Save the Pixel” sales page. Simply removing 
the left-hand column, with its navigation options, newsletter sign-up box, and extra 
info, increased sales by 20.5%. Because there are fewer things for visitors to look at, 
they are more likely to engage with the core message.
Figure 7-18 ​Removing the side column on the old “Save the Pixel” sales page delivered a 20.5% 
increase in sales by focusing on the proposition.
Figure 7-19 shows a view from Gurushot.com, a web-based application we designed 
and built, which shows visitors wisdom quotes in response to their queries. The site’s 
design excludes any elements that are unnecessary for delivering the desired experi-
ence, allowing users to focus directly on the content.
Noticeability
Getability depends on another factor, which is the relative noticeability of the various 
elements presented. Every element has its own level of noticeability—how strongly it 
pulls the eye and calls attention to itself.

Designing for At tention ❘ 149
Figure 7-19 ​Gurushot.com has a minimalist design that focuses attention on the relevant content.
I identify eight design factors that can affect noticeability:
Size
u
u
Contrast
u
u
Boldness
u
u
Color
u
u
Position
u
u
Space
u
u
3-D Effects
u
u
Movement
u
u
The important thing to remember is that these factors all work together in the same 
space. You can use any combination of them to change the relative noticeability of 
visual elements.

150 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
The trick is to balance them sensitively in order to create the right overall effect, 
which is that the eye is drawn naturally to the primary features, and can take in each 
one in turn, without being distracted by competing minor elements.
How to find the right balance is outside the scope of this book. It requires sensitiv-
ity and experience. The fundamental technique is to look at the page as though you 
are seeing it for the first time, and to spot where your eye is drawn. If it is the wrong 
place, consider what is drawing your attention, and try to fix the balance.
Size
The bigger an element is, the more important it seems to be. Increasing the relative 
sizes of visual elements is an easy way to adjust their relative noticeability.
Don’t treat your web pages like works of art. They do not have to be perfectly bal-
anced. The longer you look at an entire page design, the farther you will drift from 
the way it is actually used—which is scanned quickly for clues. Try to make a page 
entirely consistent and balanced and you will end up with something that lacks the 
critical edge it needs to grab attention.
Many pages can afford to increase the size of the initial headline and other primary 
messaging. When you remove unnecessary visual clutter, you have more space avail-
able, so you can enlarge the primary signals, as shown in my design for EventRight, 
shown in Figure 7-20. The eye can only settle on elements that have content value: the 
identity, navigation, copy, and content imagery.
Contrast
Tonal contrast is a very important factor. The sharper an element’s contrast (the bal-
ance between light and dark) with its surroundings, the more it stands out. I will offer 
some important tips on using contrast in your page designs.
Try squinting at the page through almost-closed eyes, so that the screen blurs. Can you 
spot some areas of contrasting tones (usually dark-on-white)? If not, you may not have 
anything that has enough contrast to draw the eye. Many designers have a natural ten-
dency to reduce contrast of a design the longer they stare at it. Try to add some content 
that is both important and higher-contrasting (which can be large text, or imagery).
Figure 7-21 shows the EventRight design with a blur effect applied, which reveals 
strong contrast around the logo (top-left) the main call to action (top-right), the dark 
navigation strip, the photograph at the bottom right, and the black-on-white heading 
at the top of the content area. The heading in the header strip does not show up so well, 
because it is white against a mid-tone background, so it may be more effective either 
to use black text or to darken the background.

Designing for At tention ❘ 151
Figure 7-20 ​Using fewer visual elements lets you make the most important ones larger and more 
noticeable.
Figure 7-21 ​Use the squint test to check how many different areas of strongly contrasting tones your 
page has.

152 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
If you see more than about ten areas of contrast, you could end up with a page that is 
drawing the eye in too many different directions, which means that it will not be able 
to focus on any one area.
Edges of strongly contrasting tones draw the eye. If you find it’s hard to read a web 
page, check the contrast between the main content area and the page background. If 
there is high contrast, this will constantly pull your attention away from the content. 
I prefer to use white for the main content area and light tones for backgrounds, creat-
ing a low-contrast boundary.
Boldness
Boldness is a feature that emphasizes tonal contrast. Stronger, heavier lines create 
clearer tonal boundaries, which draw the eye. Boldness is most often associated with 
text. Use either large type size, and/or a bolder typeface for your main headings. 
Lightweight text will be less noticeable. You may also apply bold weight to specific 
words in content, if you want them to jump out.
Color
Color works in a similar way to contrast, in that it can create distinction between ele-
ments. Pages should have a basic color scheme (which may be subtle and consistent, 
or brash and cheap, depending on the brand).
The two basic principles are:
Use the same colors to tie together areas.
u
u
Use contrasting colors (usually from the opposite side of the color wheel) to 
u
u
draw attention to specific features.
For example, if your main page hue is cold and blue, you may use orange or red as a 
highlight (or “spot”) color, which would stand out. If the design is based on a warm 
color scheme, you might use blue or green for contrast.
I recommend keeping the background colors of pages soft. Also, if you use too many 
different colors on the same page, it becomes difficult to make anything stand out, 
and the reader may feel overwhelmed.
Position
Clearly, your main message should be near the top of your page. Specifically, it should 
be at the top of your content area. This assumes that the regular page “furniture” 
(including logo and permanent navigation) are easily distinguishable, which means 

Designing for At tention ❘ 153
the visitor can group them and ignore them to move straight to the main heading and 
imagery.
Do not put so much at the top of the page that the primary content risks ending up 
“below the fold” (that is, the visitor will need to scroll to see it)!
Follow conventions when positioning elements on screen. Eye tracking research 
shows that some areas of the page, such as the top-right corner, tend to be seen as 
lower priority than others. Other areas, like the top-left of the main content area, are 
more often focused on.
When you first look at a page, where is your eye drawn? It is likely to be an element 
that combines several of the noticeability factors.
Use those noticeability factors to draw attention to the page’s unique main content, 
starting with the headline. If attention is drawn to a feature that is not unique to the 
page, or to content that does not help get visitors’ attention, there is a great opportu-
nity to improve click through.
Space
Putting space around any element makes it more noticeable. It is easier to recognize 
the shape (silhouette) of an object if it is not crowded by other elements.
I advise removing boxes and lines wherever possible, because this creates more space 
on your page, meaning that everything can be slightly easier to read, and allows you 
to use more extra space around your most important elements.
I also like to use increased line height in body text, and also to add extra vertical 
space between columns, as I find this increases readability.
Figure 7-22 shows a section from an e-commerce page I redesigned recently. Note 
how each element has enough white space around it to make it easy to read. Don’t be 
tempted to cram content close together—unless you do not want it to be read!
3-D Effects
Some graphical effects create the illusion of 3-D space. These include gradients, drop 
shadows, and reflections. When you give an element space or shape in this way, it lit-
erally stands out from the page.
We are naturally drawn to things that are shiny or seem to have shape. There are a 
few general rules to using 3-D effects. Because, most of the time, they use light shad-
ing to create the effect, it is advisable to keep the source of the light consistent. If light 
seems to come from many directions at once, it can break the illusion.

154 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
I would also advise against using too many effects. You do not want to draw attention 
to too many elements, so reserve 3-D effects for particular content. Use it minimally 
on elements that are present on every page, because you do not want to make these 
too noticeable.
Figure 7-22 ​Although this page section includes a lot of content, I ensured 
all the important information has some space around it for good readability.
Figure 7-23 shows my design for Synctus.com, which makes a clever device that syn-
chronizes files on special hard drives between multiple locations via the Internet. The 
design creates the illusion of a large shape that seems to be on a flat virtual plane, 
creating a 3-D suggestion of a diagram showing how data moves between multiple 
back-up storage devices.

Designing for At tention ❘ 155
Note how the headline “Synch files between offices… Quickly, Securely, Easily” dis-
tinguishes the market for the product. The only people who would ever need this 
solution will be those with responsibility for IT for organizations that have multiple 
offices. So the headline immediately qualifies that market in, disqualifies the rest, and 
also includes three differentiating features.
Figure 7-23 ​The Synctus site uses the illusion of 3-D space to draw attention to the product and main 
content.
Movement
Things that move grab our attention. It is an unavoidable biological fact. We are 
tuned to spot movement, which could be prey or a threat. Some of the most annoying 
online ads use this fact and apply animation to catch your eye.

156 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
There is a more subtle type of dynamism that you can use, which is the suggestion of 
movement. Diagonal lines and shapes are more dynamic than square angles, so use 
them to draw the eye (but be careful not to lead the eye off the page).
Testing and Fixing Noticeability
Figure 7-24 shows the results of a fascinating test. I initially redesigned the header 
strip of towelsdirect.co.uk to focus more on benefits to the customer. (To run the test, 
I used Google Website Optimizer, which is covered fully in Chapter 11.)
Here are the changes I tested:
I increased the noticeability of the logo, phone number, and the three key features.
u
u
I crafted a new strap line (the title that goes with the logo to explain the offering).
u
u
I added a badge graphic claiming “#1 Choice.”
u
u
The result was a significant drop in conversion rate of 45.4%!
Figure 7-24 ​Three headers on towelsdirect.co.uk, showing a huge turnaround in conversion rates from 
a few seemingly minor changes.
I had to ask what might have caused such a negative impact. I wondered whether the 
badge and the other features were drawing attention away from the content, so I tried 
the third strip, where I removed the badge and reduced the size and contrast of the 
text. This produced a 46.5% increase in conversion rate over the original strip!
What could explain the switch?
Perhaps the “#1 Choice” badge lacked credibility.
u
u
Maybe the heading was too cluttered and visually distracting.
u
u

Designing for At tention ❘ 157
Or, it could be that the most noticeable items were not what people needed to 
u
u
see to get their attention.
The lesson to draw from this example is that all the content and design factors inter-
act in complex and subtle ways. We should use all the skills and knowledge at our 
disposal to make our very best guess designs, but we must always test.
warning ​Increasing the noticeability of an unhelpful element can have a negative 
impact on success. If you have made something more noticeable or readable and con-
version drops, look more closely at what draws attention. How could it be unhelpful?
Navigation
Your site’s permanent navigation does three jobs:
Tells you where you are
u
u
Tells you where else you can go
u
u
Gives you a means to get there
u
u
All three factors are important for getability. A new site’s navigation structure works 
like signage in a store, giving visitors a good idea both of where they are and what is 
available, which gives them clues as to what kind of site they’re on. So ensure your 
top navigation is clear, descriptive, and useful. Even if visitors do not see the next step 
forward on the page, hopefully your clear navigation will offer them somewhere else 
to look without leaving the site.
Notice how the simple navigation in Figure 7-25 makes it totally clear where you are 
now, including an arrow that points to the content, as well as where you can go next. 
A strong headline communicates the proposition, and the simple layout leads the eye 
through the message to two clear next steps.
Imagery
Although graphics do not generally impact conversion as much as text content, the 
first imagery you notice when arriving on a new page is important for getability.
Ensure that the first images people notice directly communicate the subject matter of 
the page.

158 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
Figure 7-25 ​My design for the home page of Win.tv features simple navigation that makes it obvious 
where you are and where you can go.
For example, if your site has a photo of a car on it, what does that say? You could sell 
cars, insurance, driving lessons, valet services, or car polish! If you sell insurance, 

Designing for At tention ❘ 159
make sure the imagery supports your intended message. If you sell driving lessons, 
clearly show driving lessons, and people will get they’re in the right place.
note ​Tests run by the Ogilvy agency several decades ago proved that when people 
are presented with an advertisement that features an image of some item, they are 
likely to assume the item has something to do with the ad. So if you sell computer soft-
ware solutions, don’t show a bridge. If you sell loans, don’t show an empty park bench 
(both real examples from sites I have redesigned).
One thing you do know about everyone who comes to your site is that they are peo-
ple. People are most interested in two things: themselves and other people. As social 
animals, we get a lot of information from others’ faces, so our brains are tuned to pay 
attention to faces.
Showing a human face is an easy way to increase the attention-pulling power of a 
page. If that face is smiling and looking at the camera, it gets even more attention.
Figure 7-26 shows two versions of the main product shot from a client’s sales page 
(bibletimeline.net). The original picture had shown the chart’s format, but did not 
give an idea of either the size of the product or the details it provides.
For our initial test, we added a close-up of a small area of detail, showing more of the 
information that is available on the chart. We also added width and height measure-
ments showing its scale. We expected an increase in conversion rate, based on the 
principle that people like detail. However, there was no improvement at all.
Figure 7-26 ​Adding a smiling person boosted conversions by 38%.

160 ❘ Chapter 7: Get Their At tention
In the second experiment, we overlaid a photo of a young woman pointing to the 
chart and smiling to the camera. This put the chart into a human context. People 
could immediately get the scale of the chart, and could picture themselves using it 
attached to a wall. Adding the woman resulted in a massive 38.8% increase in click 
through to the purchase page.
Look and Feel
Although key content should clearly communicate where you are and try to capture 
attention, it is not advisable to ignore the softer elements of a page’s message. These 
are the subconscious signs of the quality of the site, and might be communicated 
through branding, color scheme, typefaces, or content imagery.
If the page doesn’t look right, or if you make a visitor think, “Er, am I in the right 
place here?” you are off to a bad start.
When done well, these values should come through in the general look and feel. The 
page should just look and feel right.
If you are selling expensive hand-made shoes, the site should have muted colors, 
close-up photographs of the artisan’s skill, and an elegant old-world feel, giving a feel 
of timeless quality that embodies attention to detail.
However, if you are selling cut-price shoes, perhaps a cheap-looking site is more 
appropriate. A page that uses primary colors, star flashes, and bold headlines in full 
caps would suggest the page has been put together in a hurry by a retailer who is too 
busy selling shoes to take time to craft his web page. It may also suggest that little has 
been spent, reinforcing the sense that the shoes are being sold as cheaply as possible. 
(Some sites spend a lot of money to get this look just right.)
Figure 7-27 shows two of my early designs for a large UK tile retailer, tile.co.uk. The 
design on the left is bigger, brighter, and bolder, which suggests a more aggressively 
priced offering. The design on the right appears more up-market, with its muted 
color scheme and softer features. The choice of approach came down to how the client 
wished to position the brand.
There is no right answer to what the right look and feel is. (It is a great candidate for 
broad-strokes testing, using A/B split tests.) The guidance will come from the quali-
ties you need to project in order to qualify the page as “the right place.”
Although these look and feel factors may not grab attention as such, their job is to 
match the visitor’s expectations, so the site qualifies for further investigation.

Designing for At tention ❘ 161
Figure 7-27 ​Two alternative approaches for tile.co.uk—but which is the right one?
Does your logo project the right qualities and values? Is the personality right? Do the 
colors and fonts project the feel a visitor would expect? Is the layout familiar?
Resist the temptation to make your site different from the crowd, if doing so would 
make it harder to get what kind of site it is.
Getability Tests
Use these quick tests to check how getable your page designs are:
Try ignoring all the words on the page. Do imagery and graphics give the right 
u
u
first impression that you’re in the right kind of place?
Take just the first three things that you see when you view the page (without 
u
u
scrolling). Do they convey enough to give you confidence to keep looking? If 
after taking in the first three things, there’s no incentive to keep reading, stop 
and introduce a good one.
Remove all body text and just look at headings. Does the page work when just 
u
u
reading the headings? You can’t assume that any visitor will read all your con-
tent, so ensure the content that stands out most conveys your message.
If you have applied the tips in this chapter, you should be confident you can get more 
attention. This gives you some currency to continue communicating your proposi-
tion. Next, you need to use the attention to keep your visitor engaged and build inter-
est in the next step.


keep them engaged
Each of your web pages is an advertisement for the next step forward. Th e only way to 
achieve your ultimate goals is to get your visitors to the top of the Awareness Ladder. 
From whatever point they enter, your purpose is to get their attention and then to get 
them moving onward and upward. For that to happen, you have to keep your visitors 
engaged.
Th is chapter looks at techniques you can apply to maximize engagement on your web 
pages to move more visitors up the ladder toward conversion.
Assume every visitor is an undecided prospect who is open to taking the next action. 
You have already achieved the fi rst crucial step by getting her attention. Once you have 
her attention, you must keep her interest so that you can communicate your message. 
Th e longer you keep her engaged, the more thoroughly you can get your message across.
When you have communicated your message as well as you can, your visitors should 
be willing to take the next action you present. What needs to happen for them to be 
ready to do so? An engaging web page should do four key things:
Affirm the 
u
u
positive signs visitors are looking for.
Resolve their 
u
u
concerns and build trust.
Build 
u
u
interest.
Make it 
u
u
easy to keep engaging.
Your visitors need positive reasons to take any action. Th ey need to trust that it will 
produce the result they expect. Th ey must be interested in the promised outcome. 
And the whole process needs to feel easy.
affi  rm the Positive Signs
No one will take any action without suffi  cient reason to do so. What gives us the 
motivation to move forward is the positive vision of a life that is better, easier, or less 
ChaPter 8

164 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
painful. If you can get your prospects to imagine the benefits of a proposition in their 
lives, you have done most of the work, because that vision will create powerful emo-
tional responses that make it easier to take action.
Whenever we interact with a web site, we are motivated by some goal. Now that a web 
page has gotten our attention, we suspect we’re in the right place to get what we want. 
But we are not yet convinced enough to take action. We need to see more reasons 
first, signs that confirm we are moving in the right direction, getting closer to our 
goal. I call these signs affirming positives.
As we proceed, the scent trail gets stronger. Interest, anticipation, and desire build. 
Finally, we are convinced enough to commit to the next step. Examples of questions 
that require affirming positives include:
Will it work?
u
u
Does it meet my needs?
u
u
Will it fit?
u
u
Does it have a proven track record in my industry?
u
u
Do other companies use this?
u
u
Is this the best price?
u
u
Do they serve my area?
u
u
Is there a support package?
u
u
Can I afford to run it?
u
u
Will it work with my setup?
u
u
Is it suitable for domestic use?
u
u
Will you deliver?
u
u
Whatever positive signs we need, they must all be answered with a “Yes!” When our 
affirming positives are checked off, we are ready to proceed toward conversion. Miss-
ing affirming positives are holes in your road—things that should be there but are 
not. A hole in the road could stop visitors in their tracks.
Remember to use these methods to ensure you provide enough affirming positives:
Consider the 
u
u
present concerns of each market segment and what signs they 
may be looking for that tell them they’re in the right place.
Be 
u
u
thorough. Provide comprehensive information to serve the needs of every 
personality type (but don’t force me to wade through it all).

Affirm the Positive Signs ❘ 165
Stick to the 
u
u
facts. Show details, backed up with numbers where relevant.
Provide 
u
u
evidence. Stories are far more credible than empty claims.
The problem is, we each need different reasons. This raises the challenge of how to 
present all the affirming positives required to address all your target visitors’ needs.
When you use the multiplicity approach, and distinguish your funnels by market and 
their specific need, you should have insight into what signs each market may be look-
ing for. This should help you filter the content required to keep each type of prospect 
engaged.
Long or Short Copy?
In a medium like mail order advertising, long copy sells. The long-standing motto in 
direct mail is “The more you tell, the more you sell.” This has been proven time and 
again.
I would say the same principle applies to marketing on the Web. But some important 
differences exist.
The reason why long copy sells in print is that it lets the copywriter put forward many 
angles, each of which could appeal to different types of people. Different people may 
be looking for different qualities in the proposition. The more reasons the copywriter 
includes, the more likely he or she is to connect with what each of us is looking for.
“Whatever claim you use to get attention, the advertisement should tell a story reasonably 
complete. When you once get a person’s attention, then is the time to accomplish all you 
ever hope with him. Bring all your good arguments to bear. Cover every phase of your 
subject. One fact appeals to some, one to another. Omit any one and a certain percentage 
will lose the fact which might convince.”
Claude C. Hopkins, Scientific Advertising
Some web marketers apply the long-copy approach directly to sales pages, and create 
squeeze pages that are 10 screens long, bombarding the reader with every angle, every 
fact, testimonials, and multiple calls to action. The reason they do that is because it 
has been proven to work.
Do not assume that the long sales format is the only solution for any of your web 
pages. These long pages typically sell only one thing. Your web site may need to 

166 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
­represent the breadth of what you offer, which means it needs navigation. People may 
expect to see links to your contact page, your home page, or your privacy policy.
Your web site is not a standalone single-shot message, like a sales letter or mail order 
ad. It can be a conversation, or many concurrent conversations that can adapt intel-
ligently to different visitors’ needs.
As well as funneling visitors toward the center of your concentric web site model, you 
can also offer them the option to move sideways, to find more detailed information 
on a subject, or even to switch to an alternative appeal.
Engaging Different Personality Types
Different people think and interact in very different ways. Not least when it comes 
making a commitment such as buying.
In our company we use a very simple and effective personality profiling tool called 
DISC. DISC categorizes people’s behavior using four factors: Dominance, Influence, 
Steadiness, and Conscientiousness. Each of us exhibits some mix of these flavors. In 
many cases, one factor is stronger than the others and shows up more in our behavior.
I find understanding DISC an extremely useful tool for visualizing how to market to 
everyone. Each DISC characteristic has its particular buying style. Each buying style 
has a corresponding most effective selling style. If you are going to reach the maxi-
mum market, you need to sell to every type. To do that, it is vital to understand what 
each type values most.
The Dominance characteristic values competency, results, and action.
u
u
The Influence characteristic values action, enthusiasm, and relationships.
u
u
The Steadiness characteristic values relationships, sincerity, and dependability.
u
u
The Conscientiousness characteristic values dependability, quality, and 
u
u
­competency.
Applying the DISC profiles to the way people buy shows up some interesting patterns. 
To get commitment from one of the types, it is necessary to give them the things they 
value most. Everyone has some mix of the following tendencies:
When selling to strong-I personality types, they want to feel a personal inter-
u
u
est, to see action, but the key is to show enthusiasm. Without that, they are 

Affirm the Positive Signs ❘ 167
unlikely to feel connected enough with the proposition. Strong-I prospects are 
more influenced by compelling positive messages.
With strong-S types, understanding and sympathy are key to generating the 
u
u
trust they need to commit. This is not always a quick process, and they are 
likely to take more time to come to a decision. They are likely to need repeated 
positive messages that reassure their need for personal connection.
Strong-C types need to get all the facts in order to know they are making the 
u
u
right choice. They need more details and evidence about the quality and per-
formance of what they are investing in. This can also take longer than with 
other types. They often need to see the most detailed information, and value 
facts and evidence over emotion.
Strong-D people are outgoing and action-oriented, like I types, and also 
u
u
interested in competency like C-types. They want action and the promise of 
results. Like strong-I types, they want positive, confidence-inspiring messages, 
but will respond better to bold, action-oriented language than emotive per-
sonal language.
How to Communicate to Different Types
In general, strong-D and strong-I personality types require less information. If they 
get excited about the possibilities, they are likely to commit. Strong-S and strong-C 
types need more information in order to trust the proposition.
None of these approaches is any better, worse, or more or less effective. The key point 
is that some personalities need more information, whereas others can be converted 
with less. This is why long copy has traditionally outperformed short copy. It makes it 
easier to give everyone enough information.
The same goes for your web site. Saying too little is riskier than saying too much. You 
should present all the arguments, reasons, and facts. You should also consider content 
that speaks to the needs of each personality type:
Dominance
u
u
—State that you have all the expertise required to deliver results, 
that you are committed and ready to deliver now. Remember to defer to their 
authority.
Influence
u
u
—Show passion and enthusiasm. Let them know you are really keen 
to work with them, listen to what they need, and get them excited about the 
possibilities available.

168 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
Steadiness
u
u
—Take the time to show they can trust you. You care about your 
customers, really listen to their needs, and make sure you provide a reliable 
service.
Conscientiousness
u
u
—Provide all the facts and details they require. Do not 
skimp on the evidence. Give them whitepapers, charts, case studies, and give 
them the opportunity to ask you more questions.
Cover All the Bases
To give every visitor everything they need, you need to cover all the bases. Make all 
the information easily available, but don’t require everyone to read it.
Lots of facts without a human connection will be unappealing to I and S types. Too 
much personal connection will turn off D and C types, as will failing to prove your 
credentials.
If you rush C and S types, they may not be ready to commit. However, forcing I and  
D types to wade through lots of information may lose their interest.
I would avoid the temptation to make assumptions about a whole market, such as 
thinking that most accountants will be high-conscientious types. We all have our 
natural tendencies, which we may adjust in order to do our jobs. Your accountant 
market will have representatives from all personality types, so always be thorough 
and provide everyone with content they can connect with.
Everyone is looking for different affirming positives. Every phrase on your page could 
be a hook for a different type of visitor. Using a variety of factors in your copy is like 
putting several different types of bait on many lines. Use one type of bait and you’ll 
only catch one type of fish. Use the full range, and you will maximize your chances.
How to Say Less and More
Ideally, you want a way to show different content to each personality type. Fortu-
nately, the Web medium means you can. Some people skim-read all the headlines in 
a newspaper, whereas others read the stories that interest them word for word. That 
works on web pages too. But because web sites are interactive, even more options are 
available:
You can give people the high-level story together with links to “break out” and 
u
u
get more information if they need it.

Affirm the Positive Signs ❘ 169
Because web page space is cheaper than paper, you can also present multiple 
u
u
calls to action. You may include a link to the next step after your introductory 
claims (for more impulsive visitors), and additional links further down for 
those who will want to read more.
Visitors can launch pop-up windows or layers to get a bit more information 
u
u
about something.
You can use funky UI tools like JQuery to provide a range of information on 
u
u
the same page using tabbed controls, iframes, or slide-out “concertinas.”
Instead of requiring a single page to do the whole job, you can also give links 
u
u
to pages that are customized for different types. Each page can have a unique 
appeal, such as:
“Full details on how we’ll save you money year on year. Compare our 
u
u
5-year performance to the market.” (C)
“We take extra care to customize the perfect savings package for you and 
u
u
your loved ones.” (S)
“What will you do with the $1000s you save?” (I)
u
u
“Guaranteed savings plans by our experts.” (D)
u
u
Though, generally, showing more information works, it doesn’t work for everyone. 
You may run a test that proves that extensive evidence works better than touchy-feely 
people factors, but that does not validate or invalidate either approach. Both may be 
right—for different people.
Long copy may work for more people than short copy, but that does not mean that 
one version will work best for everyone. A combination of approaches may be better 
still.
On the Web, you can write for all your visitors, addressing everything they value 
most. Use all the approaches at the same time. Make detailed information available 
for people who need it, but don’t make anyone have to read it.
The same goes when you ask for information from your visitors. On our agency’s 
web site, we use a simple feedback form for new prospects to get in touch. Some 
write five words, and others want to send us over 1000. Neither is better or worse. 
Some people are more comfortable writing lots of information (C), whereas others 
would prefer to communicate by phone (S and I). Others may just say, “I need this—
can you do it?” (D).

170 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
So if you request information via forms, accommodate everyone. Let the more 
­impulsive people provide just a little info, and let more thorough types add more if 
they wish.
In the early days of web design, most people used to say, “People don’t read on the 
Web—so keep your word count down.” In fact, that is not true. The fact is, although 
most people usually don’t read, just skim, everyone does read some of the time.
When you’re looking to find “Am I in the right place?” or trying to find the link that 
will give you what you want, you’ll skim. But once you’ve found what you want, espe-
cially if you need to take it all in and understand it clearly, I bet you’ll want to read. If 
we write everything only for skim-reading, we may fail to convince people who need 
the details.
Claude Hopkins stresses that advertising is sales, and your ad (or web page) is a sales-
person. You should expect it to justify its performance like any other salesperson. As 
you would not think of limiting a salesperson to a certain number of words in a con-
versation with a prospect, do not think you need to do that with your online message.
Content Over Style
Getting the information across is critical. You have caught their attention, and now 
that attention is running out. The clock is ticking, so you must keep your visitors 
engaged. A great way to waste attention is to write poetic language designed only to 
stimulate emotional feelings and that fails to communicate anything relevant.
There is nothing wrong with using descriptive or beautiful text — where it specifi-
cally supports your objective of communicating positive benefits. Taking a couple of 
lines to describe “the solid thump of the door closing, the smell of the leather, and the 
tingle down your neck as you fire the ignition” can really help to stimulate the imagi-
nation and build desire.
Unless the copy communicates real value and supports the proposition, remove 
it. As my friend the copywriter Phil Brisk is fond of telling designers, “Don’t 
decorate—communicate!”
“If there is any doubt in your mind as to whether to use style copy or selling copy, 
remember that advertisers who trace the sales results from their ads use selling copy.”

Provide Details
“Backing Up Your Claim With Statistics Boosts Conversion by 67.8%”
OK, I made that stat up, but how did you respond? The fact is, numbers and stats  
are proven to boost credibility, because they suggest both attention to detail and 
integrity.
If you have statistics that support your proposition, use them. Look at all the  
performance indicators at your disposal, and consider which of them might appeal  
as in Figure 8-1. (Your competitors may be able to boast the same or better numbers, 
but only if they think to do so.)
Be specific. If your widget improves performance by 51.9%, saying “51.9%” is far more 
believable than “over 50%.”

note ​A new client of ours, a large hosting company, is so good that they get on 
average just one support ticket a day. You can bet I’m going to be using that in their 
marketing.
Another client provides an online trading platform that gives access to more invest-
ment funds than any of their competitors. Publishing these facts, backed up with num-
bers, is an efficient way to create a very positive impression and keep visitors engaged.
Show Evidence
If you want to make a point, don’t just tell me—show me! And cover as many angles 
as possible to leave me in no doubt.
If you make the best pizza in town, don’t just tell me you make the best pizza in town. 
Why? Because I won’t believe you. Anyone can say “Best pizza in town.” If you want 
me to believe your pizzas are the best in town, you have to use evidence. Here are 
some great examples of evidence from different angles:
I’ll believe you when you tell me that all your dough is made fresh on the 
u
u
premises.
I’ll believe that you import your cheese and pepperoni from Naples.
u
u
I’ll believe you delivered 26,309 pizzas last year.
u
u
I’ll believe you received “Best Take-Out” Award from the local newspaper 
u
u
every year for the last 4 years.
I’ll believe letters from customers who have left the area and just can’t find 
u
u
another pizza as tasty in their new town.
I’ll believe a picture of a customer receiving a case of wine after visiting every 
u
u
week for 10 years.
I’ll believe a story about Donny, who has been making pizzas for a decade, and 
u
u
the time and care he takes to get the tomato sauce just right.
I’ll believe you when you say I may have to wait up to 40 minutes for my order, 
u
u
because you can’t rush a good pizza.
I’ll believe the 12 reasons why your pizzas cost twice as much as the place at 
u
u
the other end of the street.
I’ll believe a quote from a customer who says “I have to say I wasn’t sure a $20 
u
u
pizza could possibly be worth the money. Now my husband and I drive into 
town at least once a month for our treat.”

Resolve Concerns and Build Trust ❘ 173
Next time you find yourself stating a claim, think what evidence you can use to tell 
the story for you.
Resolve Concerns and Build Trust
Providing all the affirming positive signs is not enough to convince a visitor to take 
action. They may have doubts, concerns, or objections in their minds that need to be 
resolved before they are prepared to move forward. Every concern is a potential rock 
in the path; something that shouldn’t be there but is. Remove the concerns, and the 
path to conversion will be clear.
Such concerns will usually start with a “What if...?” Use those words as triggers to 
help you identify possible concerns.
“What if I buy it and it doesn’t fit?”
u
u
“What if I find it cheaper elsewhere?”
u
u
“What if I don’t like the result?”
u
u
“What if I don’t understand how to use it?”
u
u
“What if I want to cancel after the first month?”
u
u
“What if I need more help?”
u
u
Again, one size does not fit all. Consider all possible objections for different types of 
personality. Create content to resolve each one, and test what works best where. Fig-
ure 8-2 shows the intro panel from one of my designs. The large headline text is most 
noticeable, and quickly communicates a differentiator, which in this case is a promise 
designed to ease doubts.
Figure 8-2 ​This site’s intro leads with a headline promise aimed at resolving common concerns.  
The copy continues the theme of the proposition.

174 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
Always put information at the point people need it. If they’ll likely be asking a ques-
tion at a certain point, don’t make your visitor dig into FAQs to get an answer (or, 
worse, have to contact you, because many will give up instead).
Some common mechanisms for resolving concerns include promises and guarantees, 
third-party validation, and customer testimonials. Use as many as you can at the 
point they are needed.
A great example is Zappos.com. Every product page features the following trust 
devices:
Prominent 365-day return policy
u
u
Free shipping both ways
u
u
24/7 customer service phone number
u
u
A testimonial from a happy customer
u
u
Links to privacy and returns policies
u
u
Safe shopping guarantees
u
u
Secure shopping guarantee
u
u
Link to customer service center
u
u
Three customer service awards
u
u
Promises
Before submitting their information, people may expect to see a privacy policy in 
place, so make sure the link is placed prominently near the point where you ask for 
personal information. A lot of sites now show more personal messages, like “We hate 
spam too. We will never give your details out to anyone.”
If you’re selling goods online, it may help to display evidence of your returns policy.
Any personal promise can help resolve fears and doubts. Simply saying, “If you are 
not happy—for any reason—call Tina and Joe at 555-1234 and they will do every-
thing possible to help” can cover a broad range of doubts.
In fact, just showing a phone number can really boost confidence. It tells visitors you 
have real people that they can really talk to if they have any problems.
Figure 8-3 is an example of two different trust mechanisms. The top one is a privacy 
guarantee, and is followed by evidence of mass media recognition.

Resolve Concerns and Build Trust ❘ 175
Figure 8-3 ​This example  
features both a privacy  
guarantee, and evidence of 
mass media recognition.
Guarantees
What guarantees can you offer your prospects? Making guarantees is a great way to 
increase conversion rates. The payoff is usually far greater than the risks. In fact, the 
bolder the guarantee, the more trust it inspires.
Offering an immediate and complete no-quibble refund makes it far more likely that 
people will commit to buy, and actually less likely that they will experience problems 
later (thanks to that trust).
Think of it this way. If you can double your sales by offering a total guarantee, and 
10% of those additional customers take you up and request a refund (which is very 
high—under 1% is more likely), will you be better or worse off?
Figure 8-4 shows the guarantee from the AddAction home page. The introductory text 
and the hand-drawn arrow feel very human, reinforcing the personal brand values.

Third-Party Validation
Make full use of any factors that may help qualify your site as trustworthy in the eyes 
of a prospect. Any social proof in the form of third-party validation or awards can 
help build interest and trust.
If you have an e-commerce site, in addition to ensuring your site uses a valid SSL cer-
tificate, find out what validation trustmarks your site or shopping cart may be quali-
fied to display. People expect to see a padlock icon, or some other kind of security 
certification image, before handing over payment details.
Consider signing up to any third-party services that can enable you to show guar-
antees (like VeriSign, McAfee, TrustGuard, ScanAlert, or PayPal Secure Payment—
there are many more). These show that your site has met the required standards to 
ensure visitors’ security. The presence of a familiar logo will help increase trust.
Be prepared to test different placements of these symbols. I would usually try putting 
the logos at the top of the page (for instant “safe place” getability), near any payment 
calls to action, as well as throughout the checkout process, to keep the sense of safety 
present.
Figure 8-5 shows part of a checkout form I designed for a client with an e-commerce 
site. It has a comprehensive set of trustmarks, including payment options, security 
approval, money-back guarantee, and shipping.
Figure 8-5 ​The bottom of one of my payment forms includes a wide range  
of trustmarks.
If you have won any awards or gained industry recognition, make the full PR use 
of the fact, even if you may take it for granted. Figure 8-6 shows a site I designed 
many years ago for a local ice cream maker, which makes no secret of their proudest 
achievement.

Figure 8-6 ​This home page makes a single bold statement. With collateral like that,  
what more do you need to know?
Testimonials can be pure gold for communicating details so they are believable. Use 
the following tips to create killer testimonials.
Ask!
Don’t wait for people to send you feedback. (One of the clearest lessons we have 
learned from our optimization work is, “If you don’t ask, you don’t get.”)
Contact all your previous customers and ask them:
“What were you looking for in (whatever)?”
u
u
“Why did you choose to use us?”
u
u

178 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
“What were your concerns?”
u
u
“What was your experience?”
u
u
“What would you say to someone in the same situation as you?”
u
u
“Would you recommend us to a friend? Why (or why not)?”
u
u
Keep It Real
These open-ended questions will encourage people to be open and frank and gener-
ate sincere-sounding quotes. Overwhelmingly positive gushing testimonials lack 
credibility.
Any testimonial that covers the angles from the preceding questions will match a 
prospect’s thought patterns and will seem transparent and trustworthy.
“I really needed X, and I was recommended to try Product A. I was initially dubious 
about whether it would work for me, but I was intrigued. It arrived by courier the next 
day, and I was up and running immediately. It has definitely helped save me time and 
effort. I would not hesitate to recommend Product A to my friends and family.”
John Doe, 8th Grade schoolteacher, KY
Testimonials do not need to be polished or elegant. The more they sound like a real 
person talking, the easier real people will connect. When you read the testimonial I 
created for a web site home page in Figure 8-7, although it has all the right words in it, 
it just doesn’t sound like a real person said it, so it is not credible.
Figure 8-7 ​I wrote this  
testimonial, and you can tell.

Resolve Concerns and Build Trust ❘ 179
Place Testimonials for Maximum Effect
Use testimonials in the most powerful places. The last thing I would recommend is to 
file them away in a page under a link called “Testimonials.” Doesn’t that sound dry? 
Can you remember the last time you clicked a link that said “Testimonials”? No one 
wants to read pages of quotes.
Here’s where testimonials really work. Use them within your content—as your con-
tent—to reinforce specific positive points, or to counter specific objections.
On your Shipping page, include a testimonial about how quick the thing 
u
u
arrived.
Near the point of payment (and throughout the checkout process), show testi-
u
u
monials that reinforce the choice to proceed. This is all about resolving fears. 
Quotes that say how great the service was, how they would definitely use you 
again, and what a pleasure it was dealing with your company, will all help keep 
a slightly undecided visitor moving forward.
If you are describing benefits or features of your offering, use customer quotes 
u
u
and stories to show evidence of each benefit, as shown in Figure 8-8.
Figure 8-8 ​This testimonial sits adjacent to a call to action, reinforces the reason to take the call to 
action, and even has a big fat arrow that points to the button to click.
Audio and Video Testimonials
People connect and respond to people. Capturing a testimonial in text is useful, but it 
is not as believable as actually hearing or seeing the person.
Recording customer’s voices—or even getting videos—can be extremely effective. 
Many services online (including www.yourrecordingline.com and www.audioacrobat­
.com) will let customers dial in by phone and leave a testimonial, which is then con-
verted to MP3 format for you to include on your site.
You can record video testimonials using tools like QuickCam (www.agriya.com/­
products-quickcam) and SiteClip (www.seetheface.com/siteclip) for publishing on 
your site.

180 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
It is also possible to record video chats (using Skype or iChat) using screen-capture 
software like Camtasia (www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp) for Windows or iShowU for 
Mac (store.shinywhitebox.com/index.html).
Whatever medium you use, try to get a real, authentic-sounding quote. Don’t be tempted 
to edit the content to make it sound more slick. You must also explicitly get the permis-
sion of the customer to publish his or her quote on your site.
Style Tips for Building Trust
One thing you know about all your visitors is that they are people. It is emotion that 
compels them to act. They want to connect to your offering in a personal way.
To make personal connections, first you must treat the visitor as an individual, 
addressing her personal wants, fears, and desires.
Whatever your market, it is also desirable to show humanness to present some degree 
of personality for the visitor to identify with.
Keep It About the Individual Visitor
At all times, remember what will sell your offering. It is not you, it is not what you do 
or sell, or its features. It is the benefits to the individual who is buying. Always address 
the individual.
“Don’t think of people in the mass. That gives you a blurred view. Think of a typical 
individual, man or woman, who is likely to want what you sell.”
Claude C. Hopkins, Scientific Advertising
It can help to imagine that you are telling a friend about something you have found 
that you think could really benefit them. What language would you use to talk with 
your friend? Use that same language in your web copy.
Be clear whether you are selling your product or service, or selling yourself. If your 
service is personal, such as coaching or therapy, you are very much part of your offer-
ing. But you should always link every aspect of the offering to the visitor.
In your language, speak to “you” the reader. Talk about them, their needs, what they 
can get, much more than you talk about yourself. Talk three times more about them 
than you talk about you. Note how the introduction in Figure 8-9 does not mention 
the service provider at all. It’s all about “you.”

Resolve Concerns and Build Trust ❘ 181
Being you-oriented also requires showing deference, acknowledging that they are in 
control. You respect their choice, and it is your job to give them the information they 
need in order to choose. Ask for too much commitment too early, before they’ve built 
up trust and momentum, and you will lose people. Serve their needs by giving them 
every reason to trust you and to choose you.
I mentioned Ken McCarthy’s two filters—“So what?” and “Nonsense!”—in Chapter 7. 
Relevance is the key to bypassing the “So what?” filter. Behind “So what?” is “What 
does that have to do with me?” Let all your content answer that question.
Figure 8-9 ​The main intro panel on my design for BankLoans.com is packed  
with benefits and mentions “you” or “your” three times.
Be Real
It is much easier to convince when you stick to what is true, and to demonstrate the 
facts through stories.
To test this, take a few minutes and browse other sites in your sector. Look at which of 
them present slogans and catch-phrases, and which tell real stories. Which approach 
appeals personally to you? Which trips your “Nonsense!” filter? The same approach is 
likely to work for your prospects too, who are real people like you.
If you were telling someone face to face about your great business, you would not 
make embellished claims, you would tell stories that he or she would understand. You 

182 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
would talk about the way you treat your customers, what your products let people do, 
and why they love them. Do the same when selling online.
Ville & Company, the London management consultants I introduced in Chapter 5, 
have a positioning based around their personal, flexible approach, which distin-
guishes them from the bigger firms. Figure 8-10 shows a callout from my home page 
design, which is written to come across as direct, personal, and authentic.
 
Figure 8-10 ​This language sounds  
personal and accessible.
Be Human
Try writing as yourself, not as some disembodied voice. Consider using “I” rather 
than the royal “we,” so people can connect emotionally with you. Creating the feeling 
of a relationship is particularly important to strong-I and strong-S personality types.
Add photos of real people: yourself or your team. Stock photos stand out a mile and 
lack credibility. One of our partners even shows a photo of one of their call center 
staff alongside the phone number on their web site, together with the text “This is 
Louise—she really works here.”
If you make a promise or guarantee, consider adding a graphical signature, which 
represents you and strengthens your word. (For identity protection reasons, you may 
not want to use your real signature!)
Figure 8-11 shows a design mock-up I did for the online fashion clothing retailer 
Goddiva.co.uk home page. The header block features an editorial-style introduction 
from a real person with a face and a signature, creating a personal and friendly feel.

Resolve Concerns and Build Trust ❘ 183
Figure 8-11 ​A personal introduction from the site editor echoes magazine style, and will be familiar to 
the target market.
Another powerful tool is to tell your own personal story. (This is particularly useful 
for strong-S personalities, who most want to feel they can trust you personally.) What 
motivated you to do what you do? Why are you passionate about it? Revealing your 
own reasons gives other people something they can really identify with.
Figure 8-12 shows my suggested redesign for a marketing site run by Tim Marsh, who 
produces books on cycling in France. Tim’s personal account at the top of the page 
will connect with people who share his sense of adventure and passion for cycling.
You don’t need to make yourself look good, just trustworthy. They’re not buying 
you—they’re buying your offering. Look back at your real story, and think what you 
can tell to help people understand why you’re talking to them:
“I was really struggling to find anything in my area to solve this need, so I 
u
u
decided to set it up myself.”
“I personally wasted thousands of dollars before I found this way.”
u
u
“I really felt I had been ripped off, and knew there must be a better way.”
u
u
“I want to help other people avoid the mistakes I made.”
u
u
“I’ve made every mistake it’s possible to make. I have learned these ­time-saving 
u
u
techniques through 20 years as a practitioner, and I want to share them with you.”

184 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
Figure 8-12 ​My redesign for Tim Marsh’s ebook sales site opens with his personal story,  
communicating Tim’s passion to the visitor.
Stories like these will keep your visitors feeling they are connecting with another per-
son, not a disembodied brand, which will ease their fears and help them to trust you 
and your offering.
Build Interest
Assuming your web page is affirming the positive signs people want to see and help-
ing resolve their doubts and objections, the path to conversion should be clear of 
rocks and holes.
That is not always enough to get people ready to take action. You also need to  
compel them forward, and get them to the point where they really want what you are 
offering.

Build Interest ❘ 185
note ​The advertising industry uses the acronym AIDA to describe the process of 
building an ad. AIDA stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action. Keeping your visi-
tors engaged requires interest to be maintained and desire to be built, in order for 
them to be ready to take the next action.
Standalone advertisements have to do this in one sitting. They must usually identify 
one type of audience at one point of awareness, and try to get them all the way to 
conversion. You are not limited by those constraints. You can create experiences for 
many types of audience at any step on the Awareness Ladder. The immediate goal is 
only to help them reach the next step.
Each step requires attention to be stimulated, then trust and interest to be built as you 
lead up to the next action, which is to take the next step.
For each page on your site, consider what current level of awareness it addresses, and 
the next level you want visitors to reach. What is required to bridge the gap? What 
will draw people through to the action? What will generate and build interest and 
desire?
Copywriters have a few techniques to get people to keep engaging:
Keep it fresh
u
u
Keep delivering value
u
u
Keep the scent
u
u
Keep It Fresh
Avoid your content sounding familiar. If anyone thinks “I’ve read this before,” you’ve 
lost them. For a message to have an impact, it should occur as new, get their attention, 
and seem worth reading.
To be more specific, though the message should be new, the style of your content 
should be familiar. Use the language of the person you are addressing.
You are probably not representative of your target audience, so do not write for you. 
Write for them, in their language. Talk about what they find interesting, not what you 
find interesting.
Your content, however, should come across as fresh. Whatever you are telling me, 
it should feel like I have never heard this before. To keep my attention, your message 
should be distinctive, remarkable, and unique.

186 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
Above all, avoid using the same marketing speak and buzzwords that your competi-
tion uses. If everyone in your sector stands in line, copying each other’s communica-
tion and values, and you stand in line with them, why would someone choose you? If 
you stand out, you will be noticed and people will have a reason to discover whether 
you offer something special.
Bolwell’s Edge RV is a ground-breaking caravan, which gave us the freedom to keep 
the style of the whole site fresh and modern (see Figure 8-13). The brochure download 
page uses the kind of direct and personal language that is becoming more common 
on the Web.
Figure 8-13 ​The brochure download page from the Bolwell Edge web  
site uses friendly language that’s straight to the point.
Keep Delivering Value
The only purpose of a headline is to get you to read the first sentence. Each sentence 
should both communicate value and also  make you want to read the next one. What 
keeps us reading is “What’s in it for me,” whatever that is. Every paragraph should 

Build Interest ❘ 187
suggest more value to come, so that your visitors feel they are getting value, and will 
keep getting more value by reading more.
Try finishing sentences or paragraphs with a question, which creates uncertainty and 
makes me want to read on to get the answer. Why does this work every time?
It works because no one likes not knowing. (See what I did there?). A simple way 
to get people to read on is to continue one sentence with the closing thought of 
the previous sentence. For example, I might tell you that sentences are like playing 
dominoes.
In the game of dominoes, you have to match each piece with the same number of 
dots as the previous piece. That’s what that last sentence did. The previous paragraph 
ended with the mention of dominoes, which was slightly intriguing. “How is it like 
dominoes, Ben?” The very next sentence gave you the answer, picking up with “In the 
game of dominoes...”.
But that’s not all...
Great, you’re still reading! If you want people to read all your content (which you do), 
don’t fulfill your promise too early. Keep a bit back. If your headings or introduction 
give all the answers, people may think they don’t need to read on to find out. What 
keeps me reading is the offer of value.
“One way to arouse interest is to give free information as well as sales talk in your copy. In 
doing this, your advertisement should be arranged so that the free information comes first 
and the sales talk second. If the sales talk is placed first, the reader may never reach the 
free information section.”
John Caples, Tested Advertising Methods
Unlike the ads John Caples wrote, when you apply the Awareness Ladder to create 
web pages arranged in concentric funnels, you don’t have to have to have the sales 
talk on the same page.
Keep the Scent
Each page should get attention with a promise of value, and must then proceed to 
deliver that value. While this applies at the page level, it can also be true in the big 
picture. If a visitor has come to your site to achieve some specific goal, ensure the 
scent of that goal is present on every page.

188 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
Whatever you promise should generate positive reasons to move forward. The lan-
guage of possibility usually beats negative or fear-based copy. Creating a dream and 
making it seem achievable will be more compelling than serving up a nightmare sce-
nario and making it seem avoidable.
“People are seeking happiness, safety, beauty, and content. Then show them the way. 
Picture happy people, not the unfortunate. Tell of what comes from right methods, not 
what results from the wrong. For instance, no toothpaste manufacturer ever made an 
impression by picturing dingy teeth. Or by talking decay and pyorrhea. The successes 
have been made by featuring the attractive sides.”
Claude C. Hopkins, Scientific Advertising
For example, one of Joe’s sites may serve visitors who arrive interested in finding a 
way they can prevent hair loss. Depending on their search, they could conceivably 
arrive at a number of points on the Awareness Ladder. They might be searching on 
the general topic, or wanting to know about what treatments exist, or asking whether 
surgery is a realistic alternative option.
At whichever point they enter, they only have one goal: “A hair loss treatment that 
will work for me.” So every page Joe publishes should contain the scent of the reso-
lution of that need. That goal is what drives visitors to keep reading. They need to 
remain convinced that the way to get the value they want is to read on.
Put yourself in Joe’s shoes. Let’s say you have a Step 2 article, “The Only 3 Ways 
Proven to Stop Hair Loss.”
Don’t list the three ways at the top! Someone who reads that may think, “OK, now I 
know enough, thanks,” or, “Yup, I’ve heard of those. Nothing new here.” These are 
both failures. (Why? Because they have not kept the prospect engaged and brought 
them to the next level on the Awareness Ladder.)
You might start by talking in general terms about the three solutions. “You may have 
heard of hair transplants, laser treatment, or natural remedies. But which actually 
work, and which are a waste of money?” (The mention of wasting money will spark a 
sensation of fear in some prospects, which could get them to keep reading.)
You might mention that there are many more that have either not been proven to 
work, or have been proven not to work.
Mention the third best way first, and end on reasons why this may not be right for 
everyone. (That will make me read on, because I’m getting value and there is more to 
come, I just know it.)

Make It Easy ❘ 189
Do the same with the second solution, and finish with, “However, the cost of this 
technique can put many people off. Is there a solution that’s been proven to work and 
does not require such a big investment?” (That will make me wonder whether you’re 
going to give me the answer I wanted—the free information that was promised in the 
headline.)
Finally, tell me about Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro. Explain how it is supposed to work. 
Mention the reasons why people are hesitant to try it at first. Tell me about the doz-
ens of stories you’ve heard about its effectiveness. Say how affordable it is and link to 
other articles that go into more proof. (You could even link to places where you can 
buy Miracle Hair-Gro now.)
Then the job is done. You have persuaded a visitor to read the whole piece, with the 
promise of free valuable information, and you have delivered that information. Along 
the way, you have differentiated your offering from the alternatives he might have 
considered. In other words, you have successfully helped your visitor from one level 
of awareness (Step 2: solutions exist, but not aware of yours) to the next (Step 3: aware 
of the product and some of its benefits). You have also provided a link for him to take 
the next steps (Steps 4 and 5: getting convinced that this product is the one for him) 
with an option to proceed to buy.
But you have not sold! This is important. If you had finished the article with a “Buy 
Now!!!” button, the article could lose its credibility. Anyone reading through, or 
skimming or skipping to the end, would realize the page is selling a product, which 
does not match the promise made at the top. Owners of other web sites would also be 
less likely to link to a selling page. Always take people up one rung at a time, and you 
will retain trust and credibility.
Make It Easy
Finally, there are many ways to make it difficult for someone to engage with your web 
site. I’ll describe the common mistakes, and how you can avoid them.
Consistency
Hyperlinks must keep their promises. If someone clicks a link, the page he arrives on 
should be the one he expected. An easy way to achieve this is to match the link text to 
the heading of the target page. If a link says, “How you can cut your energy bills,” and 

190 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
the next page hits the visitor with the headline “How You Can Cut Your Energy Bills” 
there will be no doubt he is on track.
Many e-commerce sites suffer from this kind of disconcerting experience. Often, click-
ing “Add to Cart” or “Proceed to Checkout” from a sales page can feel like the visitor 
has just been teleported somewhere onto a different site (which in many cases is true). 
Making sure the target page feels like you are still on the same site will decrease cart 
abandonment rates. If you can, show the same branding, layout, or color scheme, and 
repeat the names or pictures of the products he or she wishes to purchase.
Be Brief
If your language is clever and complicated, only clever people will get it. However, 
everyone can understand simple, clear language (even clever people). Replace any dif-
ficult or long words with shorter, clearer alternatives.
Readability expert Rudolph Flesch taught that the easiest sentence to take in is only 
eight words long. A sensible average is 16 words. Any sentence of more than 32 words 
is hard to take in.
Use short, simple sentences that pack a punch. (Note: that’s just eight words.)
“… And the same applies to paragraphs. Vary them, but keep them short, containing only 
one or two thoughts—especially the first one. A long opening paragraph is daunting.”
Drayton Bird
note ​“Always try to remove unnecessary words wherever you possibly can without 
losing the meaning of what you’re trying to say.”
Or I could say:
“Remove words wherever you can without losing meaning.”
Which one did you understand? Which gets you to the next sentence quicker?
Use Simple Language
Use plain English. This will be more accessible to everyone, especially those for whom 
English is not their first language.

Make It Easy ❘ 191
Use as many words as you need to communicate your message, and no more, as my 
landing page for Rjenda.com shows in Figure 8-14.
“Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a 
paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have 
no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the 
writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subject only in 
outline, but that every word tell.”
Strunk & White, The Elements of Style
Figure 8-14 ​This landing page for rjenda.com is extremely concise.
Although they seem shorter, avoid contractions, like don’t, shan’t, can’t, and she’ll. 
They actually take slightly more brain power to decode than “do not,” “cannot,” and 
“she will.”
Use active voice (A does B) rather than passive (B is done by A). This will make sen-
tences that are shorter and easier to understand. Compare:
“Sentences that are shorter are more likely to be understood by readers.”

“Readers understand shorter sentences more easily.”

Make Text Readable
If your text is hard to read, do you think more people will read it, or fewer? If people 
don’t read your text, how will they become convinced?
Spacing
Spacing around an element makes it easier to identify. That’s why you get spaces 
between letters in words, bigger spaces between words, and yet bigger spaces between 
paragraphs. They make it easy to see where one thing ends and the next begins.
In our web designs, we avoid reducing letter spacing in body text. If anything, we 
occasionally increase it. We frequently add extra spacing between paragraphs. (You 
can safely reduce letter spacing in very large heading text, which often looks better 
without sacrificing readability.)
note ​I did a test and reduced the space between paragraphs on one article for a few 
weeks. The average time on page went down 9.5%, because people gave up reading. 
Adding extra paragraph spacing increased time on page by 15%.
Size
Try increasing font size in body text and headings. A significant minority of people 
have some vision impairment. In some markets, you will find it is a majority. Larger 
text is no harder to read for those with perfect eyesight, but it may make it possible for 
a valuable proportion of your market to engage with your content.
note ​In another test, I reduced the body text size on another article. Although aver-
age time on page actually went up (probably because it was still readable, but slower 
to read), bounce rate increased by 5.5% (which meant one extra visitor in eighteen 
chose not to engage with the site).
Lists
If you have a few items to communicate, bulleted lists are often more appealing. Lists 
are often more accessible  than paragraphs. They present content in manageable bite-

Make It Easy ❘ 193
sized chunks, which will be easy to understand. Bullets in the form of check marks 
create positive momentum, as the examples in Figure 8-15 show.
Figure 8-15 ​When communicating benefits in a list, check marks feel positive and uplifting.
Clear Headings
Use subheadings within your text to highlight useful words. Headings help some-
one scan the page to find out if it is interesting, so using clear headings can increase 
engagement. Try to make your headings give the shape of the body text, without tell-
ing the whole story.
The text size must be significantly larger than body text for the heading to stand out.
note ​I tested reducing the heading size of H2s and H3s in one article. Average time 
on page went down 5.5%.
Capitalization
Using SOME capitalization will draw attention. Like any noticeability factor, using all 
caps makes text less readable, more likely to be overwhelming.
(On the flip side, you may deliberately choose to reduce readability to get people to 
skip over terms of use, legals, small print, and so on.)

194 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
Imagery
Images can sometimes tell more than text. For example, graphs or charts can describe 
a trend more succinctly than a table full of numbers.
Good quality imagery can make the difference. If all e-commerce vendors use the 
same low-quality catalog shots, sourcing better pictures can make the product seem 
more desirable. Showing multiple views of the product may show the item in an even 
better light, and also give an impression that somehow your service reflects the qual-
ity of the photography.
Ensure the size and noticeability of an image are relative to its content value. Also 
“zoom in” to emphasize the real meaning of an image by cropping off irrelevant areas.
Icons can help to draw attention and to distinguish key points or links from body 
text, as Figure 8-16 shows.
Figure 8-16 ​Icons draw the eye to useful next steps, and can also work  
as cognitive shortcuts.
Audio and Video
As broadband Internet access becomes the norm, more sites are using multimedia in 
place of static text and images.
The benefit of audio, video, and animations is that they can allow the visitor to sit 
back and watch or listen instead of having to read and scroll. Some people understand 
much better by listening or viewing than by reading.
Some information can be explained more directly and simply through moving visu-
als. Video walk-throughs can also replace lengthy screenshots and text.
Try not to depend on audio or video exclusively to deliver your message. Always offer 
an alternative for those using alternative browsers, such as phones and text-to-speech 
readers.
Avoid using multimedia gratuitously because it can drain attention. The fundamental 
rule is to use it only where it enhances the experience and communicates more infor-
mation more easily.

Unnecessary Steps
Any step can only have a sub-optimal conversion rate. Provided you have included all 
the information a visitor needs in a logical sequence, are there any steps that you can 
remove to increase overall conversion?
Although gathering visitor information can be a worthwhile goal, forcing people to 
register or provide their e‑mail address in order to get what they want can also be a 
big rock in the road. Unless you have given them enough reason to believe they will 
achieve their goal, they are likely to give up.
Figure 8-17 shows two versions of the home page for Rankmill.com—the original and 
our redesign. Rankmill lets anyone create their own top list of anything, and publish 
the list on their web site. The site’s major goal is to get visitors to create their own list. 
We had the idea that the “Create your own Top” control in the left-hand column was 
not descriptive enough, and could be made more appealing.
We flipped the page over, moving the “Create your own Top” into the main section, 
and other people’s top lists over to the left column. Although the functionality was 
identical on both pages, the original version generated zero new lists from 196 visits, 
and the new version got 11 from 183 visits. The redesign did not remove an unneces-
sary step, but it certainly made the goal action feel more achievable.
Forms
When you do need to request information, it is generally advisable to keep your input 
forms as short as possible.
Oh, and 99% of “reset” buttons should be removed (the ones that set all of the values 
in a form back to their original blank state). When did you last use one yourself? Very 
few forms benefit from a reset function, but clicking a button accidentally could be 
extremely inconvenient.
Figure 8-18 shows a nice, clear form design that follows one of our standard  
design patterns. The labels are right-aligned (to keep them close to their respective 
fields for people using screen magnifiers), fields are sized to a fixed number of lengths, 
and there is sufficient spacing between each item to help you match the labels and 
fields.

Figure 8-17 ​Changing the priorities on Rankmill.com instantly boosted conversions from  
0% to 6%.

Make It Easy ❘ 197
Figure 8-18 ​Data entry forms should feel simple and easy to complete.
In place of a long form that asks for every possible piece of contact information, try 
a simple variation that just asks “Your name / Your message / How can we contact 
you?”
A common problem is whether to break up a long form into smaller steps. There is 
no right answer to this. I have worked on sites (such as online divorce applications) 
where long forms suggest a thorough and serious approach.
Will people be encouraged by seeing “Step 1 of 6,” or will they be put off? Will more 
people complete the process if they are not told in advance how many steps there are 
going to be?
Only testing will give you reliable answers to these questions.
Dead Ends
Avoid leading your visitors to any point from which they cannot easily move forward. 
Dead ends are likely to leak visitors.
Even if you think you have given everyone the options they should need, consider 
whether you can provide safety nets to catch those who have not yet found their next 
step forward.

198 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
There are different types of navigation links. Your site-wide navigation at the top of 
the page serves as signage to tell visitors what is available on the site. Inline links give 
them opportunities to jump to what they want, to choose a different thread of conver-
sation, or to break out to get additional information.
One common safety net is the now commonplace “super footer nav.” You have seen 
these, often half a page deep and containing lists of rich links to articles in addition to 
the standard copyright and privacy links, as illustrated in Figure 8-19.
Here is another kind of navigation. Because real estate at the bottom of the page is 
cheap, designers have realized they can show more, longer links. Not only do these links 
create more chances to hook a visitor’s interest, they can also create site-wide links that 
contain more keywords than the shorter navigation at the top of the page, where space 
is at a premium.
Figure 8-19 ​A “super footer nav” gives a mechanism to serve visitors who have particular needs that 
have not been fulfilled elsewhere on the page, and provide rich links for SEO purposes.
You may also try providing a search function at the bottom of the page as well as at 
the top.
“Did we answer your question?”
A great tip is to put a simple Q&A section at the bottom of your content pages.
Include a form that asks “Did we answer your question? If not, please let us know.” 
The form includes space to enter the unanswered question and (optionally) name 

Make It Easy ❘ 199
and contact e‑mail. When a request is received, simply publish the question and your 
answer in the Q&A section on any relevant pages. Figure 8-20 shows one of these forms 
on the Bolwell Edge Q&A page. Note that name and e‑mail are not required, because 
we don’t want anything to get in the way of collecting this valuable information.
Figure 8-20 ​A “Did we answer your question?” form is great for collecting unresolved questions.

200 ❘ Chapter 8: Keep Them Engaged
These forms serve several useful purposes:
Generate new content that may help answer questions that you are not 
u
u
aware of.
Show visitors you care and you are listening.
u
u
Give them a friendly way to expect to get answers to their questions.
u
u
They also capture the real questions of real people in their own words. You may think 
and talk using the internal language of your own sector. The words you use may not 
match the ones a man on the street would use when searching for what you do. So 
adding their exact questions in their exact language provides new keywords that 
you would not normally use. They are also already phrased in the form of questions, 
which could match the real questions people type in to search engines, helping you 
get even more relevant.
So, the method to keeping visitors engaged is to give each type of visitor the positive 
signs that tell them they are on the right path to get what they want, to resolve their 
doubts and objections along the way, and to present your content in a way that is easy 
and compelling.
If you achieve these, you will have a clear road and can build real momentum from 
page to page, eventually leading to conversion. Each step will require a commitment 
from your visitors. The next chapter looks at how you can get more people to keep 
taking those steps with compelling calls to action.

Call them to action
Th e previous two steps—getting a visitor’s attention and keeping him engaged so you 
can deliver your message—serve only one purpose: to get him to take the next step. 
Attention and engagement are essential, but they are worth practically nothing unless 
they lead to action. A call to action is literally a prompt and a mechanism to get your 
visitor to take the next appropriate action now.
Your web site will have small steps and big steps, small actions and big actions. What-
ever the next step is, if it is not taken, you may lose that visitor. Each page on your site 
should have one or more specifi c preferred next steps:
Sell or squeeze pages often have only one goal action—to get the visitor to 
u
u
commit to buy a product.
On functional pages, such as subscription or checkout forms, the action is to 
u
u
complete the form successfully and proceed to the next step in the process.
Most of your content pages should include prominent next steps immediately 
u
u
following the main content, which will take the prospect to an appropriate 
next page (usually one step up the Awareness Ladder).
Other pages, like menus of content, galleries, search results, and articles, may 
u
u
have many possible next steps. These next steps are often low value, such as 
advertisements or links to move to another page of interest. In many instances, 
simply keeping people engaged with the site is an appropriate goal.
Th is chapter explores the factors that oft en hold us back from getting commitment 
from web site visitors, sets out the six main principles you need for compelling calls 
to action, and illustrates the tips with practical examples.
Classes of next Steps
If every page on your site is an ad, what is the sell on each page? If a page does not 
seem to have a logical next step, try to imagine what the visitor’s experience may be 
ChaPter 9

202 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
at that point, what she may be looking for, or what she might be ready to do, and then 
do what you need to do in order to let her do it with ease.
Actions and steps should lead directly to your web site’s goals. Your site may have sev-
eral different goals, and it is important to know which are the most valuable. A suc-
cessful site delivers more people to the most valuable goals.
Closing Calls to Action
Most calls to action lead people toward closure in their current visit. Taking our 
agency’s main marketing site (webdesignfromscratch.com) as an example, there are 
four types of final, closing goal:
	
1.	
Make contact with our agency regarding a web project.
	
2.	 Purchase an ebook.
	
3.	 Sign up for our newsletter.
	
4.	 Click an affiliate link or other advertisement.
Our site used to carry much more advertising that it does today. That changed when we 
figured out the average EPV (earnings per visitor) for each type of action, and realized that 
the value of the average visitor in terms of agency leads was 5.9 times the average ebook 
sale value, which in turn was worth about 15 times the average ad revenue per visitor.
The clear message we drew from this data was that we were wasting attention on 
advertisements. This realization caused us to reduce the level of advertising on the 
site and to focus more attention on the more valuable calls to action—those for our 
ebooks and the agency.
Of course, not all visitors may be in the market to take up your major conversion. 
It makes sense to provide those visitors with additional actions that can still deliver 
business value.
A major consideration should always be how to keep people moving toward your 
ultimate goals without losing them. If you can minimize the leaks in your system, 
you will maximize the conversions. The way to minimize leaks is to make your site so 
compelling that every visitor can find the next thing of interest on any page.
Non-Closing Calls to Action
Some visitors may be in the market to take up your main earning propositions  
(the ones that deliver immediate business value), but are not yet ready to do so. 

Build Momentum ❘ 203
­Perhaps they are at an earlier point in the sales life cycle, and simply cannot com-
mit today.
Rather than going all-out for one big sell, consider offering these people calls to 
action that require less commitment and still keep a lifeline to a possible future con-
version. Getting them to sign up for a newsletter or to download ebooks or whitepa-
pers are typical early-stage actions that may still bear fruit farther down the line.
Do not be tempted to rely exclusively on soft, non-closing calls to action. Your web 
site must cater to those visitors who return at a later stage, ready to take the next step. 
If it does not compel them to commit, you cannot expect them to do so. (That would 
be like dating for years, but never popping the question!)
Build Momentum
Although it is a mistake to get stuck before the conversion, it is also risky to try to go 
for conversion too early. Do not try to shoot people all the way up the Awareness Lad-
der. You cannot skip steps and expect people to be ready to commit. Each necessary 
step must be present, and the access to each step is usually a distinct call to action.
A call to action is not the last thing that happens in a visit. Any successful conversion 
will probably have many small calls to action along the way. Do not expect good results 
by proposing marriage on the first date. Just like in a courtship, if you are going to pop 
the question there will have been a lot of previous requests, starting with, “Would you 
like to go out for a drink? Maybe Friday?” This gives the other person time to find out 
enough about you to know whether you are likely to fulfill his or her needs. Experiences 
on the Web are no different. People need to know enough to be able to proceed with 
confidence when you finally invite them to accept the ultimate invitation.
note ​The old home page of a client’s site we redesigned featured several closing 
calls to action. In fact, the main headline on the home page was “Subscribe NOW!”—
even before any benefits had been communicated! Needless to say, the old site had a 
very low conversion rate.
All commitments have a natural cycle, with a beginning, middle, and end. Along the 
way, there needs to be a complete sequence through the steps of awareness. If those 
steps are delivered on different pages, there needs to be a call to action at each step.

204 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
Imagine that your conversion point sits on top of a hill. Your job is to lead your visitors 
up a steady climb, along a path that is as direct as possible. Yet, if the path up the hill is 
too steep, visitors may not have enough momentum to complete the last vital step. You 
need to take them through the sequence of awareness so that their experience is com-
plete, while still ensuring that each step in the process is only as long as it needs to be.
Where your stats show low click through or conversion at a particular call to action, 
ask whether there may be a step missing (that is, the path is too steep). In this case, 
you may test adding more affirming positives or resolving more doubts. Walk the 
road yourself and identify each step of awareness. If they are not clear, ask yourself 
what is missing.
You may also consider whether the path is too long and winding. Are there steps that 
could be removed? Could you maintain momentum by combining two or more pages 
or steps into one? Does your path eventually lead to the point of conversion, or does it 
just go round and round?
Ensure that every page has one or more logical next steps that are timely and appro-
priate. Now you just need to make people want to take the steps. That’s what this 
chapter will show you.

Six Tips for Cr afting Compelling Calls to Action ❘ 205
A sales process without a close will not produce sales. A web page without a next step 
is a dead end. When a system has stoppages that prevent flow, you get leaks. In the 
case of your web site, people give up when you make it anything less than easy to pro-
ceed, because it takes work or thought to find a way forward.
If you don’t ask, how can anyone say “yes”? Don’t be the kid who stands crying in the 
school yard, complaining that no one is playing with him, and when asked “Did you 
ask to join anyone’s games?” sniffs “No.”
Make It Easy
Whatever the next step may be, your job is to make it easy. Do not assume for a 
moment that anyone cares enough to put thought into what to do next. When there is 
something to do now, tell them “Do this now” and you’ll be amazed how many more 
people do it.
note ​Always remember, you are talking to an “undecided.” The “no” crowd is not 
going to convert, and the “yes” guys will convert anyway. The visitor you are build-
ing your web site around wants your offering to solve his problem. That’s why he is 
here. All you need to do is show him the way.
Do not fool yourself into thinking that visitors will find their way back again if they 
don’t convert today. If your site doesn’t compel them to action today, why would they 
take action next time?
Not having calls to action is the single most common failure we find in web site con-
version. Your calls to action are your signage that point to rewards ahead. If you 
remove all the signs to conversion, the only people who find their way there will do so 
by accident.
Figure 9-1 shows the impact of providing a clear call to action where one did not exist 
previously. The goal of this page on Skinnerinc.com is to drive more people to submit 
a form with details of goods they wish to be evaluated for auction. The original page 
featured passive links to the next step (“Skinner Appraisal Services”), from where 
visitors could click again to access the form. Simply adding a call to action with clear 
benefits (“Get a Free Evaluation Today”) that links directly to the form resulted in 
284% more people submitting the evaluation form.

Get Over Your Resistance to Selling
Selling does not just apply to e-commerce sites. Money does not need to change hands 
in a sale. If you have a web site, you are selling something, whether it is a product, a ser-
vice, an idea, or connections. You can do so actively or passively. (Hint, actively wins.)
What are you trying to do: sell, or not sell? If your purpose is to sell, sell without hesi-
tation or shame! Use every tool at your disposal to sell and sell more. Do you already 
have too much business?
Active selling shows confidence, which generates confidence in your visitors. Imagine 
a friend asks you “Should I get one, do you think?” If you reply “Definitely!” she will 
feel encouraged and will probably go ahead and get one. If you do not answer, she 
probably won’t. If you say, “Well... It’s up to you,” she won’t. The same goes with the 
undecided visitors on your web site.
“Everyone likes to buy stuff. No one likes to be sold to.”
David Ogilvy
We have all had experiences of being sold to so hard that we lose confidence in the 
seller. (Being British, I may be particularly cynical.) It is natural to develop a mistrust 
of selling. Do not confuse being “salesy” with selling. If you have this sensitivity, it 
may help to view your role as “helping people to buy” rather than selling (just as long 
as you do it).
Unless you help them buy, they won’t buy. And they want to find a solution. They 
want to buy. They are your target market, they need what you offer. That is why they 
are here. Because they are undecided, they need your assistance to decide, so help 
them buy.
At every step, do not leave your visitors to guess, tell them what they can do next. 
And, when, the time is right, be sure to pop the question.
note ​Go through your site now and notice how many pages have no obvious next 
step.
Be Clear and Strong
The second biggest conversion sin is having calls to action that don’t call.

208 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
Calls to action should be obvious, bold, and direct. To make a link or button direct, 
its content should say one of only five things:
What I want to 
u
u
get
What I want to 
u
u
do
What I want to 
u
u
know
What I want to 
u
u
happen
Where I want to 
u
u
go
If any call to action does not fit into one of these categories, change it so it does. So 
change “Click here to get our current brochure” to either “Current brochure” (get) or 
“Download our current brochure” (do).
Also avoid vague standalone verbs like “Browse.” Nobody comes to any web site 
just to browse. Tell me what it is I’m going to get by browsing, for example, “Browse 
Articles.”
Similarly, “Read more” is not a very compelling call to action. I don’t go onto a web 
site for the pleasure of reading, I read in order to get something I want. A link that 
points to the thing I want, like “Full article” or “How it saves you money” is much 
more promising.
note ​“Click here” is not a call to action, because I will only take action with a rea-
son, and clicking is no reason. Remove the “Click here” from any link, and it will be 
clearer and more direct. (The only time I ever use “Click here” is when it is not at all 
obvious that the target is clickable, which should never really happen.)
Front-Loading
Always try to get the most meaningful and impacting words at the beginning of any 
link, sentence, or paragraph. This will get them more directly into people’s heads 
(especially those who are scanning).
I have one concrete example of front-loading in action. I tested various calls to action 
linking from our About Us page to our Contact page. The text “Talk to Us” beat 
“Next: Talk to Us” by 16%. Why? The only difference is removing the filler copy and 
front-loading the action word.

Six Tips for Cr afting Compelling Calls to Action ❘ 209
Command
If you want your friend to go ahead and call someone, which would compel action, 
saying “Maybe she might like a call” or “Go ahead and call her”? The second one with 
the command calls for immediate action.
Another reason that phrasing your calls to action as commands is simply that people 
do what they’re told. (In a famous psychological experiment run in 1974 by Prof. 
Stanley Milgram, 65% of participants delivered what they believed to be dangerously 
high electric shocks to actors, simply because they were instructed to do so by an 
authority figure.)
note ​A simple proof of this theory is to look at pay-per-click ads on Google search 
results. I just searched for “family tree.” Of the top five results, three started with an 
imperative: “Trace Your...,” “Create...,” and “Build your....” Try the same test with pay-
per-click ads in your own markets.
ApartmentSmart.com markets affordable housing solutions across the U.S. We 
worked with them to increase conversion rates across the web site. Figure 9-2 shows 
two versions of the main property detail view. A few minor changes, including mak-
ing the main calls to action more obvious and easier, helped generate a 30% increase 
in applications via the web site and by phone.
In Figure 9-2, our redesign is on the bottom. It has a more explicit and upbeat call to 
action, which acknowledges the visitor’s authority (“Send Message” is more positive 
than “Submit”). Because generating phone calls is one of the site’s objectives, making 
the phone number prominent, and adding the reminder “Call FREE,” also encour-
aged visitors to take that next step.
Pitch Your Language Appropriately
A commanding tone is not always best, depending on the context. Figure 9-3 shows 
a number of variations of calls to action we included at the bottom of all our articles, 
which invite readers to contact our agency to discuss their web project. The results 
varied widely.
An emphasis on listening produced much better results than a direct order. The more 
personal “We’d love to hear... Contact one of our team today” creates a direct human 
connection, whereas “Contact Scratchmedia now!” is far too abrupt for the context. 
There are no golden rules. Only testing will prove what works best for your pages.

Make Calls to Action Noticeable
Calls to action will be used more if they are noticed. You can apply basic graphic 
design techniques to make your calls to action stand out.
Big elements are more noticeable.
u
u
Elements with space around them stand out more clearly.
u
u
A call to action that sits right in the natural flow of the page, in the main con-
u
u
tent area, or following the content just viewed, is more likely to be seen.
Any element that has a bright color that is not used elsewhere on the page will 
u
u
stand apart.
Applying 3-D effects, like beveling, gradients, and drop shadows, will make a link 
u
u
look more like a button. A button is a mental shortcut for “something I can press,” 
and there is something about an appealing button that makes you want to press it.
We have numerous examples where making calls to action clearer produced significant 
improvements in conversion rate. In one of our earliest tests, we replaced a text call 
to action with a massive orange button and got an instant increase in click through of 
almost 150%, as shown in Figure 9-4. Though the original call to action should have 
been noticeable, because it is on a bright yellow background, the same color was used 
to highlight text on the page, so the call to action just didn’t stand out. Our shiny 
button was three-dimensional with larger text, and looked different than everything 
else on the page.
We achieved useful improvement when we tried to increase the conversion rate of 
Zefyr.net, a site that markets online accounting software for small businesses. Fig-
ure 9-5 shows the before and after results of a simple change to a call to action on the 
home page. The goal is a click through to the Free Trial page.

212 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
Figure 9-4 ​Bolder, more obvious button-like call to action gets clicked by 146%  
more people.
The original call to action was one of two similar links in blue and had the text 
“FREE 30-DAY TRIAL.” Simply changing the color of the call to action to orange 
helped it stand apart and produced a 28% increase in click through. Just changing 
the link text to “Try now free” produced a 43% improvement. Together, both changes 
resulted in a 56.7% increase in click through over the duration of the test.
Show One Clear Path Forward
Imagine you are in a room with one door. When you want to leave, you will proceed 
through that door. If you were in a room with 10 doors, you may leave through any of the 
doors. The more doors there are, the less likely you are to take any one particular door.
All the calls to action on your web pages are doors to other places. If you have lots of 
doors, you should expect people to use them. If you want more people to leave in one 
direction, you have a few simple options:
	
1.	
Remove all the other doors. (This is how squeeze pages work. They give some 
free information to get your interest and then offer only one way forward. If 
you want what is on offer, you have to take the only available door.)
	
2.	 Make the preferred door more accessible, obvious, and inviting. If a doorway 
is wide and well lit, it will be easier to walk through. (Make it easy and obvi-
ous using the noticeability factors described earlier.)
	
3.	 Position the other doors away from the preferred door. You are also more 
likely to take the first door you come to when you are ready to leave. (If you 
want people to take one particular action, do not place alternative calls to 
action near it on the page.)

Figure 9-5 ​Making the call to action stand out using color plus using a commanding text increased 
click through by 56%.

214 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
Repeat the Appeal
A call to action is more compelling when it fulfills the desire and promise that your 
message has set up. There must have been some appeal that first captured the visitor’s 
attention, which you have reinforced and amplified through creating a mental vision 
that affirms what the visitor wants.
What has driven the visitors to the call to action is “what’s in it for me.” The call to 
action should strengthen the scent trail. So let it remind them that the realization of 
the promise is right behind that button or link.
If you have built the promise of easily reducing your credit card payments, the call to 
action should not say “Click here to find out more.” It should say “Show me how I can 
slash my card debt today!”
If you are promising a free report, instead of “Register here,” let the button shout out 
“Yes! Send me my FREE Report Today.” (This time, the visitor is issuing the com-
mand, which gives her a feeling of power.)
Figure 9-6 shows another call to action we improved on the Zefyr site. The previous 
“Trial” page used a green arrow for the “next” link. We changed the arrow to a much 
bigger and more obvious button that read “Start my free trial now.” This resulted in a 
112% improvement—more than doubling the conversion rate of the form!
If you have overcome an important objection, such as “no risk,” repeat it in the call to 
action with “Start My No-Risk Free Trial Now.” If the visitor may be concerned about 
shipping speed, you can also counter this on the call to action with “Send Mine Today 
for Guaranteed Delivery in 48hrs.”
Use You-Oriented Language in Links
Wherever you find yourself using links that are purely descriptive, consider flipping 
them to the reader’s perspective with you-oriented language and benefits to him. Even at 
this point, he does not really care about you and what you do! Those internal viewpoints 
risk triggering the “So What?” filter. People only care about how it benefits them. So flip:
 “About Us” to “Your Team”
u
u
“Testimonials” to “What Homeowners Like You Say”
u
u
“Our Services” to “6 Simple Ways You Can Save”
u
u
“Our Vision” to “Our Commitment to You”
u
u
“How we work” to “6 Ways We’ll Boost Your Profits”
u
u
“Comparison Table” to “All Your Options Explained”
u
u
“Why Choose Bigcorp” to “How Bigcorp Will Help You”
u
u

Six Tips for Cr afting Compelling Calls to Action ❘ 215
Figure 9-6 ​This more obvious call to action with benefit-rich language more than doubled 
conversions.

216 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
Notice how the last example uses presumptive language. Instead of offering “how we 
can help you,” the position is “we will help you.” This helps create the image in the 
visitor’s mind of already being helped by Bigcorp. It is impossible to get commitment 
without any mental picture of benefits.
Figure 9-7 shows the power of benefits on a call to action; in this case, a headline on a 
cross-promotion shown at the bottom of articles. The name of my first book is “Save 
the Pixel,” but nobody wants to save the pixel. The results show that they clearly do 
want to make better web pages.
Figure 9-7 ​Just adding benefits to the headline on this promotion  
more than doubled the click-through rate.
note ​Whenever we have added benefits to a call to action that did not previously 
feature benefits, the lowest increase in click-through rate we have achieved is 20%.

Six Tips for Cr afting Compelling Calls to Action ❘ 217
Focus on the Benefit, not the Cost
Avoid language that focuses on what visitors will have to do, and instead focus on 
the benefits they will enjoy. Change “Fill in our application form” (which sounds like 
work) to “Start Earning $$$ Today.” (Notice how words like “now” and “today” help 
the benefit feel instantly accessible.)
Though positive, upbeat language is generally preferable, you can use both the carrot 
and the stick. If the motivation is to avoid something fearful, consider using that in 
the call to action, such as “I’m Ready to Stop My Cravings” or “Start Protecting My 
Family Today.”
Figure 9-8 shows three alternative calls to action to buy “Save the Pixel” as an ebook. 
The benefit in the second variation delivered a clear improvement. The third variation 
took the stick approach, and underperformed the flat original call.
Figure 9-8 ​Adding a direct benefit produced a 59% improvement in click-through rate.
Try not to use language that suggests any cost to the visitor. The conventional and 
familiar “Add to Cart” seems to outperform “Buy Now” in most tests, probably for 
several reasons. One is that the idea of a shopping cart may make the site seem more 
professional and trustworthy. It also takes the focus off spending money and replaces 
it with a gentler idea of just putting something in your cart (and maybe choosing to 
remove it later).
In Figure 9-9, the main call to action prompts visitors to enter the name of their busi-
ness into a box and click a button that promises “See Your Site Now.” The promise is 
of immediate benefit with no work.

218 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
Figure 9-9 ​Notice how the main call to action in this redesign promises an easy process with instant 
results.
Nudge Them Over the Line
Sometimes, your call to action cannot provide quite enough energy to get people over 
the line. Due to lack of space, or lack of arguments, the button or link itself is not suf-
ficient. People need a little nudge to take action now. There are several types of nudges 
you could use, including repeating key benefits and reassurances.
Figure 9-10 shows a medley of calls to action, none of which simply says “do this.” 
They add “FREE,” “Low PRICE,” “easy,” “just a few moments,” “log you straight in,” 
“toll-free,” “Start NOW,” “Call NOW,” “no risk,” “NO long-term commitment,” any of 
which can serve to help the visitor over the line.

Six Tips for Cr afting Compelling Calls to Action ❘ 219
Figure 9-10 ​Various calls to action from my designs. Note the variety of techniques that prompt the 
visitor to take action now.
Inject Urgency
The most effective nudge of all is to inject urgency. The reason is, urgency simply tells 
you that you should act now. If you think about it, acting now is the only way you can 
get click throughs or conversions. Not acting now will never produce a conversion.
The classic urgency tactic is to have a time-limited offer. This works just as 
u
u
well online as in stores “Hurry—Sale must end!” (Some online marketers 
dynamically set their offer always to end later today.)
One of our clients runs a different “Ends today!” sale on each day of the 
u
u
week—every week! An undecided prospect who returns later in the week will 
see a different offer, and will assume that the previous sale has ended and been 
replaced with a new, equally appealing, campaign.
Another very effective age-old marketing technique is to limit the availability 
u
u
of something, the “Only a few left in stock” approach.
I’ve also seen dozens of tactics along the lines of “This information is so valu-
u
u
able I am only going to share it with a handful of people.” As with the other 
techniques, whether or not the claim is true is not really important. All it 
needs to achieve is to sow the seed of enough doubt in the prospect’s mind to 

220 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
help her decide it would be better to act now (because she was probably going 
to do it anyway).
A softer technique is simply to list the top few reasons why I should act now, 
u
u
followed by the call to action. You can just be totally transparent and say “5 
Reasons You Should Call Us Today.” Yes, it’s obvious and crude, but remember 
this person wants your offering to be the one that solves his need; he wants to 
be convinced with clear reasons, so why not go ahead and state exactly why he 
would be crazy not to accept!
Pricing Nudges
Pricing can provide a great nudging mechanism by tapping into the appeal of getting 
something for less.
Even a classic sale or discount can provide that extra impetus someone needs. Be sure 
to show the previous price styled with a strike-through alongside the “new” price, as 
in Figure 9-11.
Figure 9-11 ​If you can claim to offer a discount, strike out the regular  
price to reinforce the saving.
It may also help to state how much the visitor will save by acting now. “Buy now and 
save $47!” Any implication that a price will not be available next time adds further 
urgency that could tip the visitor to choose to buy now.
Reassuring Nudges
There may be a fear or doubt holding someone back from taking action now. If you 
can imagine likely doubts, or discover them through research, try countering them at 
the point of call to action. You are unlikely ever to lose a conversion by repeating your 
reassurances.
If privacy is a concern, add “We respect your privacy.”
u
u
If safety is a concern, add secure shopping icons adjacent to each point of 
u
u
action (from “Add to Cart” all the way through the checkout process).

Six Tips for Cr afting Compelling Calls to Action ❘ 221
If you accept multiple payment methods, show all the logos of every one you 
u
u
accept near your calls to action, in case someone is thinking “What if they 
don’t take my debit card/Amex/PayPal?”
If value could be questioned, add “Lowest price guaranteed—or we’ll refund 
u
u
the difference.”
Sweeping guarantees can work great, such as “Buy now—100% satisfaction or 
u
u
your money back” in place of “Buy now.”
Appropriate Timing and Placement
Sell online like you would in a face-to-face situation. You wouldn’t try to force some-
one standing in front of you to commit to something she did not understand. You 
would lose credibility. The same holds true online—to a degree. The difference is that, 
unless you have a very linear sales page, you cannot be sure of the path your visitor 
has been on. So place your calls to action at any and all points where someone may be 
ready to take the action.
Calls to action don’t necessarily have to be “above the fold” (meaning the area of a 
page most people can see without scrolling down), but they don’t have to be just at 
the end of a page either. A page can have several calls to action, even the same one 
repeated many times (which our tests and others’ have proved to be very effective).
What you need above the fold is enough reason to continue, but I would recommend 
testing including an obvious call to action above the fold.
In Chapter 8, I described how some personality types need more information, while oth-
ers are more impulsive, so they will be ready to buy at different times. Just because long 
copy works in print ads does not mean it is the only thing that works. Long copy may suit 
more of the people more of the time, but you do not have to have just one call to action.
Strong-D and strong-I types want enough to get excited about, so give them the big 
claims followed by an early call to action.
Strong-S and strong-C types (in particular) want more reassurance, so they need 
more info. They will ignore the early calls to action, so present the facts and resolve 
the doubts and repeat the calls to action further down as well.
Figure 9-12 shows my latest sales page for “Save the Pixel,” which features the pri-
mary call to action no fewer than five times, following each compelling reason to own 
the book. (Although the page may not be readable at this scale, note how the calls to 
action are obvious.)

222 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
Calls to action are placed 
so that one is always visible 
in the browser window.
Figure 9-12 ​This long sales page repeats the call to action five times,  
so that it is always accessible at the point the reader is convinced.

Six Tips for Cr afting Compelling Calls to Action ❘ 223
There is no right approach. Only your own tests will prove what combination of call 
to action timing and placement works best. Here are some tips to consider:
If you use testimonials, try placing your first call to action directly after your 
u
u
first testimonial, which could be a confidence “hot spot.”
Another confidence hot spot is your guarantee. Try placing a call to action 
u
u
directly after any guarantee.
For people who scroll all the way to the bottom of a page, ensure there is a 
u
u
call to action at the very end of your page. Most people should already be con-
vinced by that point and will not see it, but anyone who does may use it.
Try varying the text on calls to action. More impulsive appeals may work bet-
u
u
ter higher up your page, with more conservative copy later.
Ever-Present Call to Action
It is possible to always have a call to action on hand at the moment the visitor is ready 
to take it. One method is to use JavaScript or CSS to create a floating layer that never 
leaves the screen, even if the visitor scrolls. Though this could feel quite intrusive, it 
may work to optimize the clicks on a call to action, particularly for long pages.
A less objectionable fixed-position call to action is the fixed footer. You will have seen 
these on marketing sites, where a strip is permanently fixed to the bottom (sometimes 
top) of the page. Wherever you scroll, this strip remains visible with its persistent call 
to action.
Catch-Alls
If all your main calls to action fail, you should still aim to recover as much value from 
a visitor as possible. Here are some great ideas for mechanisms to catch people who 
are still undecided, so you can learn how you could have served them better:
Live chat is a common catch-all. This could be an online text chat, or even just 
u
u
a phone helpline. Putting an open call to action to call in with any questions 
or issues gives all visitors a path to resolve their own needs, and also gives you 
valuable insight into what your page isn’t doing right. Make it part of your call 
script to find out exactly what pages the visitor has tried before calling you.
Show common Q&A or FAQs at the bottom of all relevant pages, followed by 
u
u
the “Did we answer your question?” form. As with any feedback mechanism, 
consider what you can do to make it easier for future visitors to help them-
selves (sometimes known as Level Zero Support).

224 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
If you are willing to wring every possible conversion out of a sales page, you 
u
u
could even consider a pop-up catch-all call to action (which may be annoying 
but very effective). These are activated by some simple JavaScript, which, when 
the visitor tries to shut down or leave the page, shows a message that tries one 
last time. “Wait! Are you sure you don’t want to take up our amazing offer? 
You will not get another chance. We’ll even give you X, Y, Z!”
Capture Details for Your Mailing List
A newsletter sign-up form can be a useful catch-all, and very valuable for your busi-
ness. Even if someone is not ready to accept your offer today, they may do so in the 
future. But if they leave now as a stranger, you may never hear from them again. You 
should always capture a visitor’s contact information, even if you don’t know what to 
do with it yet.
Compare the value to your business of a stranger you never met with someone who 
has volunteered to receive messages from you. Autoresponders will let you write a 
sequence of e‑mails, which can be delivered automatically at set intervals.
The easiest way to get visitors to subscribe to a newsletter is to give them some-
thing for free. When I changed the newsletter subscription call to action on  
webdesignfromscratch.com, adding the offer of 50 free web design secrets in  
your e‑mail, subscriptions jumped tenfold.
Whenever a visitor subscribes, I do no additional work. I have written a series of 50 
autoresponder messages in my e‑mail subscription manager (AWeber, www.aweber.com). 
They receive one secret every weekday for the next 10 weeks.
It’s a great example of a win-win:
The subscribers get a lot of free information, which builds their trust.
u
u
It keeps my brand at the front of their mind.
u
u
In these e‑mails, I have at least 50 opportunities to pass on a message. Some 
u
u
contain sales messages for my other products, or affiliate links to other prod-
ucts I may promote. In all cases, the offer is appropriate to the content of the 
free information.
Furthermore, when I have a new offer, I have a ready audience of thou-
u
u
sands of friendly, trusting, prospects, who look forward to receiving my 
­communications.

Give people something for free when they sign up for your newsletter. The call to 
action in Figure 9-13 is at the bottom of the page, where space is cheap, so it can 
employ a bucket-load of noticeability factors (large, bold, colorful, high-contrast, 
dynamic arrow and check mark, plus 3-D effect on the button).
Figure 9-13 ​Your end-of-page call to action can capture details for  
your mailing list.
Don’t Stop There
My last tip for calls to action could dramatically increase success. It follows the same 
idea that selling to existing customers costs a fraction of selling to a new customer. In 
brief, don’t ignore further calls to action once a goal has been reached. On your web 
site, the person most likely to take up an opportunity you present is likely to be the 
person who has just said “yes” to a different opportunity.
As you have probably seen on Amazon, once you have added a product to your bas-
ket, it offers you more products you may be interested in. And, after you check out, 
you get yet more offers.
Consider what further calls to action may be appropriate upon completion of each 
goal. Use these suggestions as starting points:
After someone has made a purchase, offer him other stuff to buy or pre-order.
u
u
Consider up-selling and cross-selling. When a visitor has added an item to her 
u
u
shopping cart, tell her how she can save money by adding more stuff, or tell 
her about accessories she should consider to go with her purchase.

226 ❘ Chapter 9: Call Them to Action
If she has downloaded a white paper, ask if she would like to subscribe to a 
u
u
newsletter so you can send her updates.
If someone has just requested a sales call via a web form, warm him for a sale 
u
u
by offering a “Working with us” document or case study.
Upon registering, could you suggest some easy tips to help a new member get 
u
u
started?
When someone has looked at how to find your premises on a map, offer to 
u
u
send your details to his phone by text message.
Are there natural affiliate offers you could place at the bottom of popular arti-
u
u
cles for people who have read all the way through and may be wondering what 
to do next to learn more?
At what points on your site could you confidently invite visitors to send con-
u
u
tent or offers to their friends?
Put It All Together
The purpose of any page is to get someone to take the next step. There is always a next 
step, whether it is to pay, to commit to buy, to download, to register, to log in, to click 
a link, or to find the information you need successfully and then go away. Every page 
could have logical next steps. The first task is to figure out what they are and prioritize 
them so you can direct people to the steps that may actually make you money.
Once your page has gotten a visitor’s attention and kept him engaged with compelling 
content that creates an image in his mind of how his life will be better, after you have 
shown him all the affirmative signs he needs to see and resolved his fears and doubts, 
you can confidently offer the next step.
Ensure you provide calls to action at any point that you would like someone to do 
something else next. Make these calls to action direct, confident, powerful, and clear. 
Get them to resound with the promise of what’s in it for the visitor once she clicks it, 
by featuring the key benefits she will enjoy.
To make it more likely that people will accept these invitations, give them  nudges, 
reminding them of more positive benefits, assuring them their doubts have been 
resolved, and creating urgency to compel them to act now.

Put It All Together ❘ 227
In case one call to action is not sufficient, you can try putting them earlier in the flow 
(for impulsive personalities) as well as at the very end of the page (where there’s noth-
ing to lose). Test all the content, placement, and design factors over and over.
You should not stop the moment someone completes one goal. If someone accepts 
your call, take the opportunity to offer her something else to do. And if she doesn’t 
accept, put in place mechanisms to find out why, so that you can offer a more water-
tight service next time.
Part I of the book showed you how to review your markets and offerings, flipping 
what you do to the external perspective, which multiplies your marketing breadth. 
Through applying the Awareness Ladder you discovered ways to address all your 
markets at multiple points in the cycle, increasing your depth. You have seen how you 
can create a structure for presenting compelling content that engages visitors at any 
point and funnels them toward your goals.
So far in Part II, you have seen how to capture your visitors’ attention, keep them 
engaged, and encourage them to take action, so that you can lead them confidently up 
the steps of awareness.
The next chapter applies this whole toolkit. I will take you through applying the 
Awareness ­Ladder once more, showing how you can apply all the techniques from 
Part II for maximum impact.

Any new web site should follow this sequence. How much you do at each level will 
depend on your situation and your goals. I explore a range of considerations in this 
chapter using a real-world case study. Th e worked example comes from a client who 
approached Scratchmedia wanting to set up a brand new web site to promote their 
new virtual server hosting business, on a limited budget.
I’ll show you how I applied the principles in this book to design a site structure that 
targets specifi c search markets, based on keyword research and the Awareness Lad-
der. Th is structure will not only reach profi table initial markets and channel them

through compelling propositions to conversion, but also provides a platform for con-
tinual growth.
If you are creating a new web site, or completely rebuilding an existing site, you have 
the benefit of starting by researching the most attractive markets, which should give 
you the quickest return for your initial work. Most web site owners do not have that 
luxury. You may already have a site with inbound links, which you obviously don’t 
want to lose.
If this applies to you, you will need to work with the structure you already have, cer-
tainly adding new funnels, but also re-working and re-linking your existing content 
in a concentric model, so that all your pages work together.
Web sites are not fixed structures. They are pages loosely linked together, and those 
links can be removed, rearranged, and built upon. Resist the temptation to treat your 
site’s current structure as untouchable. When your core funnels work well, your site 
will work well, so you may need to make some significant changes while keeping 
your filenames the same. With good research, you will be able to make the required 
changes with confidence.
Target Early Opportunities
Whether you are working on a new site or an existing one, it is exciting to discover 
new potential markets. You just need to address any new markets in a logical and 
orderly way. The starting point for this is keyword research. Keyword research is a 
simple and powerful exercise that really can make the difference between time spent 
profitably and time wasted.
If you already have a web site, look at your existing funnels first. Does your site leak 
visitors at important points? If you start to put effort into attracting new visitors now, 
will most of them be lost through a leaky system? If so, you should certainly work on 
your existing funnels first, to get the maximum benefit from new traffic.
Simplify first to remove unnecessary distractions, insert powerful appeals that your 
target prospects can identify with, and ensure you have appropriate calls to action at 
all the appropriate points. When your stats tell you your existing system is working, it 
will be time to turn up the pressure by reaching out for more traffic.

Target Early Opportunities ❘ 231
Define Your Offerings
List the problems your products or services solve. As I showed in Chapter 3, each of 
these corresponds to a potential new market. Flip each product or service into what it 
does for the customer—a solution that you can market as a proposition.
Start with “How to,” so an anti-virus software product becomes a “How to ensure 
your computer keeps working, keeping you productive,” and a box of chocolates 
becomes a “How to make her feel really special.”
It is always better to base decisions on what is already there in people’s minds. The 
external perspective is where you will find real opportunities. Apply this knowledge 
to create benefit-driven content, and make sure you find out what benefits previous 
customers have found from your solution (or similar solutions). Ask them to describe 
these benefits in their own words, and talk to the people who talk to the custom-
ers. Those real benefits could prove to be more compelling than the benefits that you 
imagine people will get from your solutions.
Keyword Research
Take a few minutes to research each problem. Type some probable starting questions 
into a search engine and browse the first few results. What is being asked? What 
issues are people looking to solve? If you get ideas for alternative phrases, write them 
down. (Review Chapter 2 for more tips on carrying out keyword research.)
Your aim is to discover where the bulge in the market is. How many people are 
searching on the problem (Step 1), how many are aware that solutions exist (Step 
2), and how many are looking for specific types of solutions (Step 3)? Your keyword 
research data will give you facts to reinforce your own assumptions.
The first result from your content strategy is one or more attractive Step 2 pages. You 
can’t have any Step 1 landing pages until you have Step 2 pages to drive traffic to. You 
may use a Step 1 phrase as your starting point, which describes a problem that you 
can solve. This research should lead in turn to possible Step 2 or Step 3 phrases. You 
can then dig deeper into those specific areas.
note ​Most of your competitors will focus on Step 3. “Warm” prospects already 
actively looking for solutions are more likely to result in a sale. Knowing this fact cre-
ates opportunities for you to attract prospects at earlier points in their awareness.

232 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
Using WordTracker (wordtracker.com) or Market Samurai (marketsamurai.com), run 
several rounds of keyword research tests to generate actual numbers on what people 
are searching for today. Both keyword research packages give you the facility to gen-
erate alternative suggestions, which you should certainly use to help you discover new 
opportunities.
Core Content Keyword Research Case Study: NTG Net
Danish consulting firm NTG Net (www.ntgnet.com) provides server virtualization 
solutions for businesses. The service allows customers to use external virtual serv-
ers in place of internal physical servers, for file storage, e‑mail, or applications. NTG 
Net has a huge amount of experience in VMWare (the market leader in virtual server 
technology), so its offerings are all built around that platform.
NTG Net’s experience and professionalism mean that it can deliver an excellent solu-
tion, but it is not the cheapest on the market. (In fact, it does not want to compete on 
price, because that will not deliver its ideal target customers—professional organiza-
tions looking for a provider they can trust.)
The company is setting up a new web site to market its virtual server hosting services. 
My initial objective was to identify the best keywords to use for the initial core con-
tent for the site. My starting point in this case was the Step 2 phrase “VMWare solu-
tion provider” (which describes the generic solution).
As the results in Figure 10-1 show, people are looking for a wide variety of specific 
technical solutions, in a wide variety of contexts. However, there are a couple of 
interesting early-stage queries in the results: “virtualization benefits” and “benefits 
of virtualization.”
In this case, I added an extra column to the spreadsheet—a “Relevance” rating of 
between zero and five, which indicates how relevant that particular search term is to 
the client’s offering. I amended my calculation to estimate the potential attractiveness 
of each term, based on the sum of all the traffic estimates, multiplied by the relevance 
rating, and divided by the title competition. The results are ordered by this field.
The client and I gave lower relevance ratings to terms that are too vague or could derive 
from multiple needs. We were only looking for terms that indicate that someone is (or 
could shortly be) in the market for this type of outsourced virtualization solution.
Depending on your scope, and the opportunities you discover, you may go through 
this part of the process several times. Your end result should be at least one target 
term for Step 2 content.

Create Core Content
In addition to the initial Step 2 landing pages, you will need content that describes 
your offering and its benefits, plus a way for visitors to convert. It is possible that these 
could all be the same page. In the case of NTG Net, I proposed the structure shown in 
Figure 10-2:
A single Step 1 page, on “Virtualization benefits.” This has reasonable world-
u
u
wide traffic (over 200 daily visits for #1 position) and relatively low title com-
petition (1,310).

234 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
A single Step 2 page. The focus is my original starting phrase, “Virtual server 
u
u
host” (traffic over 200 and title competition of 2,400).
A single Step 3/4 page that emphasizes the benefits of this offering. “Best virtual 
u
u
server host” could be a good target phrase. This will also be the site’s home page.
And finally a conversion or goal page (Step 5), which in this case will be a con-
u
u
tact page. There is little benefit in targeting this page for attracting search traffic, 
so “Contact NTG Net” would be appropriate.

Get Clear on Your Context
In your own keyword research, you will notice that pages could work at different 
steps, depending on the question being asked. For example, the phrase “virtualization 
benefits” could be seen as Step 4, in the context of “virtualization” in general.
However, the context here is this client’s particular offering—providing a virtualization 
service. I am looking for people who may be in the market for that offering. In that 
context, someone searching on “virtualization benefits” is only at Step 1, because they 
are not yet looking for a specific provider. They must have a problem to solve, and are 
clearly aware of virtualization as part of their solution. Their next logical steps are:
Choosing whether they should use virtual servers, which leads to the problem 
u
u
of how best to go about it (Step 1, in this context)
Choosing whether to outsource their server management (a general solution, 
u
u
Step 2)
Go on to look for this specific solution provider (Step 3)
u
u

Create Core Content ❘ 235
This structure gives the new site a content backbone, which fulfills my two initial 
objectives:
To provide a useful initial funnel
u
u
To provide a platform for growth
u
u
Your site will likely need a different structure. It is likely that you will have multiple 
offerings (whereas this client has one main umbrella offering). You may have several 
ways of describing your solution, which could give you multiple Step 2 entry points. 
You may not have identified an attractive Step 1 problem page. Different offerings 
may even demand distinct funnels with multiple Step 5 conversion pages. All of these 
patterns are valid.
Whatever your starting context, you must always have, at a minimum, at least one 
clear progression from one or more entry points (which match what people are look-
ing for), leading through all the steps to the point of conversion. When you start with a 
clear content backbone like this, even if it is very simple, you can quickly start to add 
more funnels.
Common Features of Every Page
As Chapters 6 through 9 described, every page on a web site must get visitors’ atten-
tion, keep them engaged, and make a compelling case to take the next step forward. 
If every page does that, your site should efficiently lead all genuine prospects through 
every step on the Awareness Ladder so that they convert. Here is a quick summary of 
what makes a compelling web page experience:
Every page must promise value from the first glance. This should definitely 
u
u
apply to your main headline, and may include imagery, animation, or video 
content.
Visitors should quickly see signs that they have arrived in the right place 
u
u
to get exactly what they are looking for. (They might find more than they 
expected.)
The design of each page should match visitor expectations. So a professional 
u
u
service company should look immediately like a professional service company. 
A parenting community site should look like one. A cheap vacation site should 
shout out “cheap vacation!”

236 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
Every page needs clear navigation that lets visitors know where they are, where 
u
u
they can go, what kind of site this is, what they will find, and what they can 
do here.
Page content should be interesting, valuable, newsworthy, honest, and gener-
u
u
ous, which will encourage third parties to link to it.
As I explained in Chapter 2, you need to make each page appear to be strongly about 
your target search term (where applicable), to give it a competitive advantage with the 
search engines. Ensure the keywords or phrases appear in the page’s title tag, in the 
H1 tag, and frequently throughout the content (good, natural keyword density, with-
out sacrificing easy readability).
Step 1 Page: “Virtualization Benefits”
My single Step 1 page “virtualization benefits” can be the first of many that will feed 
traffic to the solution pages. This will be an article that offers a clear promise, and 
should deliver that promise while converting the visitor to Step 2 in the site’s context—
deciding that outsourcing their virtual server is the preferable solution.
When the visitor has been converted to Step 2, the page will present one or more 
links to the Step 2 page, which will discuss possible solutions to the question of how 
to outsource.
You will notice that, in this case study, the Step 1 pages are more loosely connected 
to the solution than “hair loss” is to “hair loss treatment.” The research shows that 
not many people are actually searching for “virtual server host,” which either means 
the market is small (which is not the case), or that there are numerous problems for 
which virtual server hosting is the answer.
If that is the case, it means that there are likely to be good markets at Step 1, but also 
that those markets have to be developed. Visitors who arrive in one context need to be 
converted to a new context—so that they come to view their problem as one for which 
outsourced virtualization is the solution. This shift in context is a step in qualifying 
them as a prospect for the web site’s offering.
Step 2 Page: “Virtual Server Host”
Step 2 visitors are looking for a general solution to their problem. In this context, that 
means they want information on how or where to host their virtual servers.

Create Core Content ❘ 237
The purpose of this page is to present NTG Net as a credible solution to the problem 
at hand. To achieve this, it may need to do two things:
Frame the context of the problem to suit the offering.
u
u
Then introduce this provider’s offering as a good fit in that context.
u
u
This page will probably include a range of naturally related terms, to match Long Tail 
searches, including “virtual server hosts” and “hosting.” Later, extra Step 2 pages can 
be created that target additional terms more exclusively.
Each Step 2 page will convert the visitor to Step 3—being aware that there is a solu-
tion worthy of consideration. The solution that is presented does not necessarily need 
to be NTG Net itself. A more finely targeted solution would be a Step 3 proposition, 
which should be crafted to match exactly what this particular visitor wants next: the 
virtual server outsourcing solution that is right for him.
The main call to action (on-link) should describe the proposition: “Best virtual server 
host” (or whatever Step 3 offering most closely fits the prospect’s current need and 
awareness).
Step 3–4 Page: “Best Virtual Server Host”
Visitors arriving here are looking for the best virtual server host, whether they have 
come through a funnel on the site, or they have followed an external link. They enter 
at Step 3 (aware of the proposition, which is “how this service could solve your prob-
lem”) and their immediate need is to reach Step 4 (convinced of the benefits to them).
The only purpose of the page is to deliver on that promise. Always bear in mind that 
visitors really want to find the right solution for them. That is why they are on the 
Web today. Assume that they are warm, but undecided, and simply need to have all 
their questions answered.
Because this page is covering both Steps 3 and 4, it will aim to go beyond convinc-
ing of benefits to convincing the visitors that they have no reason not to accept this 
proposition now (taking them to Step 5).
note ​Although the content focus of this page is close to the Step 2 phrase (“virtual 
server host”), there is a natural progression from finding a host to choosing the best 
one, and the close relevance will only benefit the SEO relevance of both pages.

238 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
This Step 3 (specific solution) page can also be the site’s home page, because it accu-
rately describes the whole company and its brand proposition. (The focus of this page 
may change later, following further keyword research, when new content requires a 
different focus, or if the company were to expand its offerings.)
I might consider adding the modifier “best virtual server host for business” to help 
segment the market. Because the client does not want private customers, distinguish-
ing the proposition early both encourages target prospects that they are in the right 
place and disqualifies those who are not in the target market.
Step 3: Present the Proposition
Visitors already believe that what they find on this page may meet their needs, so the 
only objective  is to raise their awareness to the next step—convinced that it could be 
what they are looking for.
The job of Step 3 content is to affirm all the positive signs prospects may be looking 
for, and also to counter the full range of possible concerns. Prospects must find clear 
affirmations that this solution will suit their business, will meet all their require-
ments, and that they will not have to worry if they choose this option.
For example, prospects should be left with no doubt that:
They will get friendly, professional assistance to select the most appropriate service.
u
u
Their virtual servers will be managed by highly trained and certified experts.
u
u
If their needs change, the service will adapt to their needs, so that they always 
u
u
have enough capacity but are never paying for capacity they don’t need.
In the rare case of a hardware failure, their data will be protected and back 
u
u
online within a short timeframe.
They can afford this solution—in fact, it is a sensible investment.
u
u
In other words, all the visitors’ boxes are checked.
If there is a lot of information that falls into many categories, which may not all be 
applicable to every prospect, it may be better to break the content over multiple Step 3 
pages, linked together into a Step 3 silo, which can provide more thorough informa-
tion for those who need it, as shown in Figure 10-3.
Grouping and linking content together in this way allows prospects to browse hori-
zontally, following their own preferences and needs. These other pages could be seen 
as secondary Step 3 content, probably linked from a primary Step 3 page (this core 
page). You may also find it beneficial to have specialized landing pages that focus on 
specific benefits, which will benefit from being linked together in a silo.

Figure 10-3 ​A Step 3 silo lets visitors 
browse the benefits and features that 
apply to them, until they are ready to  
proceed to Step 4.
Step 4: Build Desire
Prospects at Step 4 are already aware of the benefits of the proposition. To get them  
to Step 5, where they are ready to take action, you must amplify the belief that their 
goal is within reach, and that accepting the proposition is the next step to achieving 
that goal.
The prospect wants this solution to meet his needs. He does not want to go back and 
look again. If you have shown him all the positive signs he needs and resolved all his 
doubts, you should have provided all the content required to make the final conver-
sion seem sensible. At the end of Step 4 they should be confident that this is the only 
solution that they should accept.
But logic does not get conversions. The key to generating action is emotion. The focus 
of Step 4 is to build or to reinforce the prospect’s mental image of a better, easier, hap-
pier, more successful life after he has solved his problem. Paint a picture of what life 
will be like on the other side of the door.
Describe what it will be like when the goal is reached. Show the prospect how 
u
u
he will know he has made the right choice.
Use assumptive language (such as, “When you hire us,” or, “As soon as you 
u
u
open the box”).
Present testimonials that paint a picture of happy customers.
u
u
Provide reassurances, trustmarks, and guarantees, which can help clear away 
u
u
any final doubts.
Consider using a combination of carrot and stick. Limiting the window of 
u
u
opportunity or availability will help create urgency. In some cases, reinforcing 
the consequences of not finding a solution can help.

240 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
The final element of any Step 4 page is a strong and easy call to action that leads to the 
conversion page (which may be to sign up, place order, check out, or make contact). It 
is especially important at this point not to offer alternative exits. (In other words, you 
either go forward through this door, or you have to go back and start over.)
Step 5: “Contact NTG Net”
The purpose of Step 5 content is to make the final step easy, so there is no reason not 
to take it. Some sites benefit from including the final step below all Step 4 content, 
removing one click from the conversion path.
This site will have one primary call to action, which is to start a conversation with 
the provider through “Contact us.” The contact page should support the prospect’s 
conviction that he is making right decision, even if that involves repeating benefits or 
reinforcing the vision of success.
In this case, it may describe what will happen after he completes the form, “One of 
our consultants will contact you within one working day to find out more about your 
business and to discuss the options that suit your needs.” Alternatively, the contact 
page could encourage the prospect to pick up the phone and state exactly what he 
needs. Both approaches emphasize the human touch, which can be particularly 
important to a service provider.
In general, I prefer to leave discussions of price as late as possible. Unless the prospect 
already has significant momentum, mentioning costs could give him a reason to quit 
the process. The more attention and momentum you can build, the more opportunity 
you have to convey benefits, which should mean that price becomes less of an issue.
note ​For most brands, the ideal thought to create in the prospect’s mind takes the 
form, “You pay a bit more, but…”
Add More Funnels
When you have one complete funnel, which takes prospects from Step 2 or Step 1 
right through to conversion, you have the backbone of an effective web site. You can 
now proceed to build more funnels around the core structure.

Add More Funnels ❘ 241
Keyword research will guide these next steps. The pivotal point of each funnel is 
Step 2: What solutions are people already looking for, and can you feasibly address 
those markets?
Additional Step 2 Pages for NTG Net
The original Step 2 page for NTG Net is “Virtual server host.” Keyword research may 
reveal similar terms that describe the solution on offer, such as variations of “VMWare 
virtual host.” Consider any alternative terms that match your core offering. If they 
have useful markets, it may be worth creating a variation of your core Step 2 landing 
page for each one. In the case of NTG Net’s keyword research, other Step 2 terms that 
look appealing could include “manage virtual server” and “migrate virtual machine.”
Next, I advise working down the list of alternative Step 2 terms, starting with the most 
attractive markets. If the market is strong enough, and you can match it with a propo-
sition that leads to your products or services, address it with a dedicated Step 2 page.
You should also revisit your web research and keyword research on a regular basis to 
see if you can discover new niche terms. Keyword research is quick and a great value 
when you consider the investment required to make new pages.
You might also create new Step 2 pages in response to new Step 1 opportunities you 
identify. When new Step 1 pages are added in the future, additional Step 2 pages may 
be needed to provide more appropriate next steps, which might lead to pages like:
“New host to migrate virtual servers”
u
u
“Outsourcing virtual machine management”
u
u
“Reduce cost of file storage”
u
u
In turn, each new Step 2 term may also provide an opportunity to create a new Step 3 
proposition. For each additional Step 2 market, consider whether it will flow on naturally 
to existing Step 3 content, or whether you need to create a new Step 3 for each funnel.
Additional Step 1 Pages for NTG Net
There are two reasons to create additional Step 1 content:
	
1.	
As additional feeder pages for existing Step 2 content
	
2.	 Or where keyword research identifies new untapped markets

242 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
The initial Step 1 landing page for NTG Net is “Virtualization benefits.” Further key-
word research may reveal related terms, exploring how virtualization can help cut 
costs, manage budget, reduce risk, and facilitate growth. Each one could become a 
new Step 1 page, linking to the existing Step 2 page, “Virtual server host.”
Related terms could all link to each other, in a similar way to how Step 3 (benefits) 
pages can link together. (In fact, selling the benefits of virtualization is a step toward 
accessing this market, so here I am doing a Step 3 exercise, but not in the context of 
the specific service being offered.)
From the initial keyword research, additional topics for Step 1, which indicate a pos-
sible early-stage prospect, could include:
“Server virtualization” (and the British spelling “Server virtualisation”)
u
u
“Migrate virtual machine”
u
u
“Virtual machine management”
u
u
Specific technology, such as VMWare, EXSI Server, or VM ESX
u
u
If these terms provide a good match to an existing Step 2 page, such as “Virtual server 
host,” they can link on to that page. If there is no useful Step 2 page, one needs to be 
created.
Generate Traffic
As soon as you have any content, you should start building inbound links. This should 
be part of your ongoing discipline. Initially, any links will help get your site found, but 
look for high-quality links from relevant, high-PageRank, old pages where possible.
You can create inbound links from off-site to any of your content, where you identify 
markets at the relevant level of awareness. But when you have built effective funnels, 
good reasons exist to focus on building links to Step 2 and Step 1 content:
You have designed your funnels to channel as many prospects as possible to 
u
u
your goals. They should do that more efficiently than driving prospects to 
later stages in the funnel.
There are often large, untapped markets at Step 2 and Step 1, out of the range 
u
u
of your competitors (because most sites start by talking about specific solu-
tions, at Step 3).

Gener ate Tr affic ❘ 243
Every Step 2 landing page needs other pages linking to it, both to provide direct traffic 
and gravity for search engines. Your Step 2 pages may be fed by one or more of your 
own Step 1 pages—if you identify significant markets at Step 1. The shape of your mar-
kets will dictate the strategy. There is little value in creating Step 1 content when there 
are more untapped but bulging markets at Step 2.
Whether or not you create your own Step 1 content, you can achieve quick results by 
creating inbound links from other web sites. This could be content that you create 
yourself, but more often it will be existing content.
note ​View all content and link creation, whether on your own site or elsewhere on 
the Web, as saving for the future. Just like the effect of compound interest on savings, 
you may not see an immediate return, but the earlier you start investing, the quicker 
your investment will start to grow. Every page you can add a link on will get older over 
time, and its own PageRank may increase, meaning the value of the inbound link also 
increases.
New Approach to Link-Building
In the old approach, link-building is a random numbers game. Lacking a coherent 
content strategy, designers and search engine optimization specialists tend to go just 
for traffic, building links from any pages they can find, based on keyword relevance 
alone (sometimes not even going that far).
The result is poor conversion, because the immediate need of the traffic is not well 
matched to the immediate proposition of the landing page.
Another common mistake when focusing only on subject matter is to create links 
between pages that are at the same step. For example, if you have a page about “vir-
tual server host” and you look for other pages with the subject “virtual server host,” 
you may be trying to link one Step 3 page to another Step 3 page. If the linking page 
successfully answers the prospects’ immediate need for information, why would they 
follow the link to your page?
In the new approach, link-building is far more conscious and deliberate. You cre-
ate inbound links from content that is relevant to both a page’s subject matter and to 
its awareness step. Specifically, for each landing page, you will look for content that 
matches the page’s preceding logical step.

244 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
So, for any Step 2 page, you should look for external pages that are focused on related 
Step 1 questions. In this way, you can know visitors’ level of awareness and give them 
precisely what they are looking for next. Subject matter relevance may be slightly 
diminished, but conversion potential will be significantly increased.
note ​The most effective strategies are often the most obvious. Refer your own con-
tent structure for ideas for inbound links. If you have created targeted Step 1 pages 
(based on solid keyword research) look for opportunities to build links from other 
pages with the same subject matter—and point the links to the same Step 2 pages that 
your Step 1 content links to. This will build relevance around the Step 1 term, which is 
exactly what you want.
How to Find High-PR Links
Aaron Wall’s site SEOBook (www.seobook.com) provides some very useful free SEO 
tools. In particular, I recommend two Firefox plug-ins: “SEO Toolbar,” and “SEO for 
Firefox.” Figure 10-4 shows the latter tool in action, showing the PageRank of every 
search result in a Google.com search. This lets me quickly target relevant higher-PR 
pages. (This example also shows the number of entries from DMOZ.org—the human-
moderated Open Directory Project—which are viewed by search engines as highly 
trustworthy. You can configure the plug-in to show a variety of data for Google and 
Yahoo search results.)

Suggested Places to Build Backlinks
It is easier to generate backlinks from some types of sites than others. Here is a col-
lection of techniques our team has used to good effect. Always be on the lookout for 
original opportunities, because the value of any technique will tend to decline as it 
gains in popularity.
Forums
Forums are great places to add backlinks. In addition to inserting relevant links in 
forum posts, most forums let you customize your signature, which is displayed after 
every post you make. When you have posted on a number of discussions, any links 
you put in your signature will instantly be displayed to readers and to the search 
engines on every post you have made on that forum, as shown in the example in 
­Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-5 ​Every post I make on our forum creates four new backlinks. If I change my signature, it 
updates instantly across 1,000 different pages.
I recommend you join a few relevant forums. Having 1,000 backlinks from a single 
domain name is obviously not as realistic has having 50 backlinks from 20 different 
domains. Look for sites whose subject matter and domain name are as close as pos-
sible to your subject matter.
Be sure to follow the rules of any forum you join. Bear in mind these tips:
Only post relevant, thoughtful content. Link-building on forums is very preva-
u
u
lent, and forum moderators are always on the lookout for people who only 

246 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
post short, meaningless messages for the purpose of generating backlinks. (On 
our forums, we delete gratuitous messages, and sometimes even delete user 
accounts, without warning or discussion.)
Treat your forum posts as part of your brand’s PR. The more value you can 
u
u
add, the more likely a reader will be to click one of your links.
Do not customize your signature, or drop links into messages, until you have 
u
u
spent some time on the forum and contributed at least ten high-quality posts. 
Some forum software will not allow new members to add links, and you do 
not want to risk getting banned.
Blogs
Many blogs allow readers to add their own comments to posts. Even if you cannot 
add links within comment content, you can often add your own web link, which is 
attached to your name. If you put your name as “Cheap software here,” it is highly 
unlikely that your comment will pass moderation! I will often put my name and my 
qualification in brackets, such as “Ben Hunt (UI design specialist),” which is both an 
accurate description and also contains my keywords.
Use this handy technique to find blogs that allow comments. Copy the following 
search query into the Google search bar, replacing <<keywords>> with one or more 
keywords, or phrases (“in quotes”):
<<keywords>> blog +”add comment”|”post comment”|”add a comment”|”post a 
comment” -”comments disabled” -”log in to post”|”log in to add” site:.ac.uk
This search will produce results for pages that:
Preferably include some or all of your keywords/phrases and the word “blog” 
u
u
(add a plus sign to the start of any word that must appear).
Include the phrase “add comment” (and variations).
u
u
Do not include the phrases “comments disabled,” “log in to post,” or “log in  
u
u
to add.”
This example also uses the 
u
u
site: syntax to specify a preference for pages on 
domains that include .ac.uk (used by UK academic institutions, because aca-
demic sites are regarded as particularly trustworthy).

Squidoo.com
Squidoo.com is one of a number of web-based applications that make it easy for any-
one to create their own pages online without any technical skills. At the time of writ-
ing, it is also a PageRank 8 site (verify), which explains why a lot of site owners are 
using the site to create their own linking pages.
As an experiment, when working on the landing page strategy for Muazo (see the 
case study in Chapter 5), I created the page shown in Figure 10-6 on Squidoo in just 
30 minutes. Its main heading matches one of my landing pages on Muazo.co.uk and 
it covers all the subjects of my other pages, and links to three of them. (Separate pages 
for each topic would have been even better.) The page is useful, easy to read, and pro-
vides three permanent inbound links.
You can also add links to your pages from existing Squidoo pages that support com-
ments. Search Google for “site:squidoo.com” followed by your keywords.

Social Sites
There are probably thousands of social networks and tools that let you easily create 
backlinks. Individual links are probably viewed as quite low in value. However, as 
search becomes more real-time, focusing on what’s currently hot, concentrated social 
linking is likely to get more valuable.
If you focus on writing interesting and valuable content, promote it via any channels 
you can. Some of these also have browser toolbars (particularly for Firefox), which 
makes it quicker to post items. As a starting point, useful social channels include:
Twitter (
u
u
twitter.com)
Facebook (
u
u
facebook.com)
My Space (
u
u
myspace.com)
LinkedIn (
u
u
linkedin.com)
Digg.com (
u
u
digg.com)
del.icio.us (
u
u
del.icio.us)
Reddit.com (
u
u
reddit.com)
StumbleUpon (
u
u
stumbleupon.com)
Make use of any of your existing networks. You may also e‑mail friends and col-
leagues and ask them to promote a page from their own accounts. If you have a 
mailing list, send announcements to your readers, and ask them to post links (where 
appropriate) on their own social networks, blogs, and web sites.
Directories
Some online directories have strong standing with search engines. In particular, sub-
mit good pages to Yahoo! (yahoo.com), which is a paid directory, and the free Open 
Directory Project (dmoz.org). Listings on DMOZ can take a long time to appear, if you 
get listed at all, because the directory is moderated by people, but that quality also 
gives listings high value.
Most business sectors have their own free or premium niche directories. Search for 
“<< topic >> directory” to find those that are relevant to your subject.
Customers’ and Partners’ Sites
It can pay to be bold and just ask for links from business connections. If you have 
customers or partners with relevant sites, send them personalized messages asking 
politely if they would be interested in posting a message and link to your content.

Consider Step 0 ❘ 249
Reverse-Engineer the Competition
A neat way to find good backlinks is to look at the pages that top the search rankings 
for your keywords and look at what pages link to them.
In your browser address bar, enter http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/search?p= 
followed by the address of a top-ranking page. Alternatively, type links: followed by 
the URL into Google.
You will get a list of any results in each search engine’s index that link to that page. 
Click through to the results to see which pages might be viable sources for links to 
your own content.
Consider Step 0
By definition, potential customers at Step 0 do not have a conscious need or problem, 
so they are not looking for anything, and you cannot identify them through keyword 
research. You must use common sense to imagine who might benefit from what you 
offer, and how you might effectively reach them.
At Step 0, you have to create problems, desires, possibilities, or needs in people’s 
minds that are either new or are unexpressed. Effective Step 0 messages are interrup-
tive. They will occur while people are doing something else, cause them to stop, and 
consider how the suggestion may apply to them.
It is still a good idea to focus Step 0 messages as far as possible. Ask what you already 
know about your market that could differentiate them from people who are clearly 
not in your market.
One simple technique is just to speak to their identity or role, or to mention some factor 
that a good proportion of prospects in any market might share. Notice how these exam-
ple headlines both create the possibility of a need and distinguish their target audience:
“What would happen if your server went down?”
u
u
“3 things every new parent should be told”
u
u
“Now you can eat what you want—and lose weight”
u
u
“My secret tips to getting your dream job”
u
u
“Is this the most economical SUV ever made?”
u
u
“If you love the environment, this will drive you mad!”
u
u
“The #1 web design trick for making easy money”

250 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
Depending on your demographic and your interests, some of these subjects may 
appeal to you, while others will not. That is the point. When you distinguish your 
market, you both include and exclude at the same time. The more people you exclude, 
the more relevant your message will appear to the right audience.
All these headlines hint at quick value, but require the prospect to read more. They 
are designed to create the awareness of some need or desire, and then to lead the pros-
pect to Step 1 content. That next content can proceed to discuss possible solutions, 
assuming certain facts about the visitor’s profile and her present need.
In some cases, the need may be non-specific, such as “I need to find out more about 
that” or “I could do with a laugh,” in which case the task of the Step 1 content is to 
re-frame the context around a new problem or opportunity.
Once you have a message you would like to present, you have to put it in front of your 
Step 0 market, which means going out to them wherever they are. Here are a few sug-
gestions for getting your message out to the world.
Advertising
Traditional advertising (outdoor, print, TV, and radio) is alive and well, and can 
provide good opportunities to raise awareness of a brand or product. They are most 
effective for promoting local businesses or name-brand goods. These media are not 
likely to give good value when you want to drive a specific market segment to a spe-
cific landing page.
Unless the prospect can immediately take the next step, there will be a high attrition 
rate. It is better to get your message in front of your potential customers via electronic 
media, which can present an immediate call to action that takes the prospect straight 
to your landing page.
As I mentioned in the Bolwell RV case study in Chapter 5, regular banner advertis-
ing can be a cost-effective way to reach a Step 0 market. The reason is that your target 
market at Step 0 is likely to be broad, which matches the blanket reach of a banner 
ad. Because you are paying for impressions, not clicks, you should identify web sites 
whose visitor profiles most closely match your target market demographic.
Pay-per-click advertising can also work well. If you know a lot about the demographic 
profile of your target customer, then Facebook may give good returns. On the other 
hand, if your market is more defined by subject matter, AdWords may perform better. 

Consider Step 0 ❘ 251
In all cases, it is important to distinguish your audience as accurately as possible and 
to serve them well-targeted messages.
Direct Mail
Direct mail is a mature industry, and still one of the most cost-effective marketing 
channels. Agencies will sell lists of names and addresses, the cost depending on the 
quality and level of segmentation. Many of the rules you already know apply to mail-
outs.
Be distinctive (unusual, hand-written, or colored envelopes are more likely to 
u
u
be opened).
Present one clear, powerful appeal, which distinguishes the target audience.
u
u
Write simple, direct, accessible copy that delivers value while keeping the pros-
u
u
pect reading. Communicate all the positive signs and resolve all the objections, 
and don’t forget a strong call to action (which you can repeat several times).
PR and Article Submission
The most economical way to spread a message is to let other people do it for you. 
If you can make a compelling story, write it up as a press release and send it out to 
online and offline channels. Article submission engines, such as PRWeb (prweb.com) 
can help you distribute press releases world-wide. If a story is newsworthy, you may 
be able to generate a lot of inbound links for little effort.
Mailing Lists
Your mailing list could be one of your most valuable assets. Anyone who signs up to 
your mailing list has already been to your web site and is interested enough to vol-
unteer to receive more information. That identifies them as a warm prospect for any 
message you may choose to give out.
I subscribe to dozens of online marketers’ mailing lists, not because I am genuinely 
interested in the products, but because I enjoy seeing the range of approaches people 
try. I continue to be surprised at how frequently the best marketers come up with new 
propositions.

252 ❘ Chapter 10: Executing Your Web Site Str ategy
Do not take your mailing list members’ attention for granted. Respect your readers’ 
time, so keep your content and style fresh and interesting, or they may unsubscribe.
Previous Customers
Another simple and obvious method is simply to send communications to people 
who have bought from you before. They already know your brand, will give your mes-
sage more attention, and are far more likely than the average new prospect to buy 
again.
Third-Party Mailing Lists
Until you have a decent list of your own, consider using other people’s. I have had 
great success promoting products using this method. There must always be a win-
win, so consider offering an exclusive discount to your partner’s list, or agree to an 
affiliate revenue share with the partner. (I like to do both, so that everyone wins.)
E‑mail messages can get forwarded beyond the original list or recipients. Mailing list 
software, like the industry leader AWeber (aweber.com), will tell you how many times 
a broadcast message has been opened. If you can create a message with viral value, it 
could be opened by more people than received it initially.
Ebooks
Another potential viral channel is the good old PDF ebook. These can give you great 
value. Instead of writing your “Ten top tips” as a landing page, consider writing it in 
your word processor instead, and giving it away for free to everyone who signs up 
for your newsletter. Ensure it follows the rules for good content (targeted, accessible, 
and interesting), is properly branded, and that it contains embedded calls to action 
that link back to specific landing pages. A useful ebook can find its way round the 
world and be seen by more people than you may ever reach through manual link-
building.
YouTube
YouTube (youtube.com) is not only the world’s second busiest search engine (after 
Google), it is also a great way to reach people who are “just looking.” It is cheaper to 

Keep Going! ❘ 253
make and publish video content than ever. Engaging and valuable video content can 
go viral and reach many more prospects than a plain old web page. Don’t forget to tag 
any videos with your keywords and to include links back to your landing pages.
Keep Going!
The final step of your web site strategy is to go back and do it all again. There is no 
final step. As long as there are new markets that you can address with new proposi-
tions, as long as you can segment and refine your existing markets to target with 
more precision, you have opportunities to reach more people, to build new funnels, 
and to continue to improve the your conversion rates.
Every hour you invest in keyword research, content writing, link-building, list build-
ing, PR, tweeting, blogging, and generally being out there will only increase your 
investment in the great online marketing bank. Start now, and carry on.
Building an expansive marketing web site using the new concentric approach is guar-
anteed to bring you more traffic, and should dramatically increase your conversion 
rates. Now that every page has one logical next step, it is easy to monitor conversion 
in detail.
You should regularly check the click-through rates in every sequence of pages in every 
funnel. Because success is a function of traffic and conversion, it is vital to minimize 
leaks from your online marketing system. The final chapter introduces techniques for 
incrementally optimizing the conversion rate of any page, and introduces a powerful 
free tool from Google, which makes it easy to test alternative content and achieve sig-
nificant and solid improvements.


optimizing your web Pages
If you have followed the complete process set out in this book, you now have a web 
site built around a content strategy based on keyword research, which you can be 
confi dent will bring good traffi  c.
You have designed multiple funnels and landing pages that target distinct markets at 
specifi c points in their awareness, which manage prospects’ attention and guide them 
through to conversion, giving them the information they should need to make a posi-
tive choice to take action. You have set up Google Analytics with funnels that let you 
monitor click-through rates from each page to the next.
Th is approach will give you far better results than a site built around “fi rst best guess.” 
Your site is still based on multiple assumptions. What do you do when you spot leaks? 
How do you improve your conversion rates through funnels?
It pays to work on optimizing conversion, particularly from key pages at later steps 
on the Awareness Ladder, where your funnels converge. A 10% increase in conver-
sion rate delivers the same impact as a 10% increase in traffi  c, and very oft en you can 
achieve signifi cant improvements with just a few small changes—particularly when 
you fi rst start to optimize your pages.
Blindly replacing what you have with another guess is not a reliable approach, because 
you cannot effi  ciently distinguish what works from what does not work. Even the best 
designers, copywriters, and marketers can’t say what will defi nitely work best. I have 
described plenty of “best practice” methods, but no one can predict with certainty 
what will be best in any particular case. Human psychology is extremely complex. Th e 
only reliable way to know what will work for your web site is to measure what people 
actually do.
All you can do is test, applying both creativity and analysis. I recommend testing 
alternative copy, imagery, calls to action, and layout, wherever you suspect a page can 
be made more eff ective. Th is chapter introduces the process for optimizing any page 
on your web site.

Our agency has delivered great results for a number of clients using the techniques 
in this chapter. We have used a few different software packages to implement and to 
monitor optimization tests. In this chapter I introduce Google Website Optimizer, 
one of our preferred optimization tools.
Google Website Optimizer
Google Website Optimizer (GWO) is a free online tool provided by Google that 
enables web site owners to execute two types of optimization tests on their content, to 
discover which of various options performs better in practice.
In this final chapter I explain how you can use Google Website Optimizer to run two 
types of optimization experiments: A/B split tests and multivariate tests. I share my tips 
on how you can use Website Optimizer to get meaningful and useful results—from my 
team’s experience of running dozens of experiments on our own and clients’ sites.
I summarize the mechanics of setting up experiments, because GWO provides excellent 
online help, plus the functional steps may change over time. I then focus on the overall 
approach and specific tips for using GWO to get useful results for your business.
Google Website Optimizer will let you display alternative content or styles on your 
web pages to different people and then tell you which alternative results in most visi-
tors completing a specified goal. You access GWO itself through your web browser. 
You do not need to install any software, it is pretty easy to set up, and  is totally free. It 
gives every web site owner the ability to test different approaches and to learn which 
performs best with statistical certainty in a relatively short time—an ability that sim-
ply did not exist a few years ago.
As I have emphasized throughout this book, you have tools at your fingertips today 
that give you far more power and speed than any previous generation of market-
ers could dream of. All you need to do to is to apply the same methodical approach 

Google Website Optimizer ❘ 257
to testing all your ideas, and you can achieve incredible results. These are not idle 
claims: We have literally doubled the turnover of businesses with a combination of 
creative design and analysis using GWO.
I should state that dozens of other powerful testing tools are available, which have 
their own strengths. GWO is not the only game in town, nor is it the best for every 
situation, but it enjoys huge popularity. I believe it is the best way for most owners of 
small and medium sites to get into conversion testing.
Testing in Parallel
GWO runs all test variations in parallel, which means different visitors are given 
different variations at the same time. This is crucial because it eliminates other influ-
ences, in particular time-based factors, which could negatively affect the validity of 
the experiments.
If you ran one page for a week, then another page the next week, you would not get 
valid results, because the environmental factors would be different from one week 
to the next. Say, for example, a popular site linked to your page on the second week, 
sending over a new group of visitors who have particular expectations. That group 
may be more or less likely to take the conversion action, meaning the playing field 
would not be the same from one week to the next.
The way GWO works is to use JavaScript code to select one page (or content combina-
tion) to serve to each visitor from a predefined range, so that all variations are shown 
to an approximately equal number of people.
It also ensures that the same visitor always sees the same content. If your visitor 
arrived on your home page, visited another page, and returned to the home page, and 
the home page suddenly looked different, it could be very disconcerting. For that rea-
son, GWO saves a cookie on each visitor’s client (browser) that identifies that visitor 
so that he or she can be served the same content next time.
How A/B Testing Works
A/B testing (also known as split testing) is the simpler of the two methods available 
with GWO. With a split test, you publish two or more alternative versions of a web 
page. Visitors are presented with one version at random, and GWO measures how 
many people proceed to a goal page in that visit. You get statistics that show the 
conversion/click-through rate of each page.

258 ❘ Chapter 11: Optimizing Your Web Pages
note ​I must stress that the term “A/B test” may be misleading. You are not limited 
to just two alternatives, but can run any number of pages.
Figure 11-1 shows a typical report from an A/B split test. (You can see the two actual 
alternatives I tested in Chapter 7, Figure 7-15.) I have highlighted a number of ele-
ments, as explained here:
	
1.	
You would use these controls to manage the test. Here, I have called the test 
“WDFS Contact A/B 2010-02-26.”
	
2.	 The graph shows visually the relative performance of the variations over 
time. The lines will not appear until you have about five successful conver-
sions for any variation. They will usually jump around early on in a test, 
when there are relatively few results, before flattening into parallel lines as 
the average conversion rates become settled.
	
3.	 In this A/B test, I am running two variations.
	
4.	 Every test has an original page plus one or more variations. Here, I have just 
one variation, titled “Redesign.” It is possible to disable variations by select-
ing the checkbox and clicking the “Disable” button (currently grayed out). 
Disabling a variation removes it from the test, so no more visitors will see it. 
GWO does not let you re-enable a disabled variation. You can never disable 
the original page.
	
5.	 Here, both the original page and redesign are currently enabled.
	
6.	 The “Est. conv. rate” column shows the current estimated conversion rate. The 
first figure (1.13%) is the actual performance (equal to 11/970 from the final 
column). The second number (±0.5%) shows the calculated margin of error of 
the conversion rate. This means the final conversion rate of the original page 
could be between 0.63% and 1.63%, based on the data gathered to date, where 
the redesign could theoretically end up between 1.51% and 2.91%. Because 
there is slight overlap between those ranges, the test is not conclusive. The 
bars show graphically the relative potential performance range of the two 
options. The range of the redesign is higher than the original, but showing a 
small overlap. For this reason, the bar will be shown in yellow (meaning it is 
statistically inconclusive). A green bar would show a conclusive winning com-
bination, and a red bar would indicate a clear loser.

Google Website Optimizer ❘ 259
	
7.	
The next column “Chance to Beat Orig.” shows the statistical probability that 
any variation will outperform the original page. Here, because there are only 
two candidates, my redesign has a 96% chance of winning the test (which 
gave me enough confidence to conclude the test). It is important to note that 
this figure does not give the likelihood of being the best variation—only the 
chance of beating the original. The figure in the “Observed Improvement” 
column shows the current actual difference in conversion rate, compared 
to the original. Here, a 94.7% improvement shows that my redesign has 
achieved almost double the conversion of the original. The final column 
shows the actual number of conversions and the number of impressions, 
which means how many times each variation has been served to visitors.
You will quickly find it easy to scan the GWO report layout, even with multiple varia-
tions running, and quickly establish how the various alternatives are performing.

Creating A/B Tests
Setting up an A/B split test in GWO is simple, as Figure 11-2 shows (Google provides 
further good help within the tool itself, www.google.com/analytics/siteopt/):
Give your experiment a useful title.
u
u
Choose your original test page.
u
u
Publish at least one alternative candidate page to test against the original.
u
u
Identify your 
u
u
goal page. This is the page, which, when a visitor lands on it after 
having visited the original or alternative page, constitutes a success. This may be 
a next step, such as “Contact Us” or “Added to Cart” (in which case you are test-
ing click through from one step to the next), or you may choose an ultimate goal 
page, such as “Thank you for contacting us” or “Confirmation of your order.”

How Multivariate Testing Works
Multivariate testing is more complex and powerful than A/B split testing. Success is 
not down to the performance of individual components. Rather, it is how well all the 
design and content elements work together that makes the difference. Our tests have 
proven this to be the case time and again.
If you have ideas for improving several different elements on a page, one option is to 
run a split test comparing the original against another version with all your changes 
implemented. Though you may get a result, that test will not tell you which changes 
made the difference. Half the changes may have a positive impact, whereas the other 
half may have a negative impact. A split test will not tell you which were helpful and 
which were detrimental, which is where multivariate testing comes into play.
In a multivariate test, the individual changes are served up at random to create many 
possible combinations. If you had three alternative headings, two alternative feature 
images, and three calls to action, a multivariate test would give you 18 different com-
binations (3 × 2 × 3 = 18). You could achieve a similar result by creating 18 separate 
variations with an A/B test, but it would take a lot more work.
The results will show you exactly how all the individual components impact the 
overall success rate, but this is less relevant than you may imagine. The real value in 
multivariate testing is that it compares how all the permutations work in symphony. 
This often gives a surprisingly different result than what you would expect just from 
looking at the relative performance of individual page sections.
 In GWO, multivariate experiments give you a second tab, which shows the average 
stats for all the page sections. Figure 11-3 shows both tabs in one of our multivariate 
tests.
Note that, on the “Combinations” view, the leading combination 22 is showing an 83.0% 
improvement over the original (which is the combination of all the original components). 
Combination 22 includes two of the original page sections and three variations. How-
ever, when you look at the average performance of the individual page sections on the 
“Page Sections” view, you notice:
The “blue, closer” Image Link variation typically generates only a 0.51% 
u
u
improvement.
The “no border” Product Description performs 0.87% 
u
u
worse than the original.
The “centered” Product Nav is responsible for only a 9.56% increase in 
u
u
­conversion.

262 ❘ Chapter 11: Optimizing Your Web Pages
These individual numbers clearly do not combine to make a significant 83% improve-
ment in conversion rate. The reason is the symphony effect I mentioned earlier. After 
a year of constantly running multivariate tests, we now ignore the “Page Sections” tab 
entirely, and only base decisions on which combinations perform best.
Figure 11-3 ​Evidence of the symphony effect in action

Google Website Optimizer ❘ 263
You may notice a few more differences between the A/B test report and the multivari-
ate report in Figure 11-3. Although I created only five alternative page elements, the 
experiment features 31 combinations (32 including the original permutation), because 
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 32.
The Combinations view shows several disabled combinations, displayed as grayed-
out rows. You can tell GWO to disable losing combinations automatically, based 
on low statistical probability of success. Here, I have manually disabled a few that 
showed poor early performance, in order to push more visitors through the remaining 
options. The more visitors who view each option, the quicker you will get conclusive 
results.
The “Page Sections” tab shows a Relevance Rating score in the first column. This indi-
cates which page section appears to have the greatest influence over the results. In 
this case, only the “Product Nav” section reports any meaningful impact, and that is 
still only 1/5 (because the average difference between best and worst variation is less 
than 10%). I find the relevance rating occasionally interesting, but rarely helpful. (In 
fact, the second best-performing combination uses the original Product Nav, and still 
shows a 61.8% improvement over the original, which seems to make no sense, and 
just proves the symphony effect again.)
Creating Multivariate Tests
The process of creating a multivariate test in GWO is similar to setting up a split test, 
in that you need to identify the page you want to test and a single goal page. Instead 
of creating alternative versions of the whole page, you will identify sections of the page 
for which you can create alternatives.
You will need to add the control script and tracking script on your test page, and add 
the conversion script to your goal page, just as in a split test. With multivariate tests 
there is another step. You need to insert a piece of JavaScript code into your page’s 
HTML markup at the start and end of each section you want to test, as the instruc-
tions in Figure 11-4 show.
note ​The inserted code includes a </noscript> tag that has no matching <noscript> 
starting tag. This means your markup will be invalid, but it’s the way GWO works.

264 ❘ Chapter 11: Optimizing Your Web Pages
Figure 11-4 ​Identify page sections for a multivariate test in Google Website Optimizer.
You can name the page sections whatever you want. For example, if you wanted to 
test separately various combinations of your main page heading (h1 tag) and your first 
paragraph, you might add code like this:
<h1><script>utmx_section(“heading”)</script>
How Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro Works</noscript></h1>
<p><script>utmx_section(“first para”)</script>Joe’s Miracle Hair-Gro has
been formulated using a unique secret blend of natural plant extracts,
etc.</noscript></p>
Note that the JavaScript tags wrap round the original content in each of the two sec-
tions. GWO will detect this content and use it as the original variation. Select mean-
ingful names for the sections. Here, I have used “heading” and “first para.”
Before you can continue from the step of setting up your experiment pages, you must 
have the JavaScript tags already in place on your test page. GWO will then pull in the 
original content from each section, and give you the opportunity to create one or more 
variations of each section, by typing or pasting in alternative HTML code. Figure 11-5 
shows how this step looks. You can select “+ Add new variation” to create a new alter-
native variation for any section, which will start with the original content by default. 
You cannot edit the original variation for any section. (Note that in Figure 11-5 we are 
testing alternative CSS blocks, not regular HTML content, in order to change visual 
style properties, which is a valid and useful approach.)
In this first section of the chapter I introduced the basic mechanics of setting up split 
and multivariate tests. I recommend you start running your own quick tests as soon 
as possible, because you will quickly get used to how GWO works. You can test pretty 
much anything you think will make a difference. You will probably find it easy to get 
some apparent improvements, and you should learn something from each test. In 
the remainder of this chapter, I share more practical tips for getting the most out of 
Google Website Optimizer.

My Optimizer Tips
Conversion testing is an extremely powerful marketing technique, and Google 
Website Optimizer is certainly a great tool, but you need to know how to use any tool 
to get the best results. Though GWO makes testing pretty easy, you still have many 
important choices to make in setting up and running experiments. I will offer what 
guidance I can, and your own experience will teach you much more (because you 
shouldn’t take anything as the final word, right?)
When to Use A/B and Multivariate Testing
The first big question you will need to ask is what kind of test to use: A/B split test or 
multivariate test? The answer will depend on what changes you think a page needs.

266 ❘ Chapter 11: Optimizing Your Web Pages
If you are testing two or more totally different approaches, an A/B test will often be 
most appropriate. For example, if you want to test one version of your home page that 
leads with a cost-saving benefit versus a version that leads with a new feature, each 
would have a different headline, splash panel, and other content. Because there are 
really only two different variations, and testing combinations of the different content 
together would make no sense (that is, you have no reason to think a cost-saving 
headline with the new feature splash would convert better), an A/B test would be the 
right approach.
Another reason for going with a split test is if the number of variations is very small. 
If you want to try out three variations of an intro panel, it may be quicker simply to 
create three versions of the page (an A/B/C test) than it would to set up the same test 
in multivariate format.
If you want to test several different changes where the variations are broadly indepen-
dent of each other, a multivariate test will probably be the right choice.
Figure 11-6 shows two combinations of a product page from the Towels Direct web 
site, the results of an ideal multivariate test. (This is the same experiment whose 
results are shown in Figure 11-3.)
We are testing five different page sections, which are independent of each other. The 
three significant changes that make up the leading combination are: the position and 
color of the “larger image” link; the centering of the “prev/listing/next” product navi-
gation; and removing the line around the product description. Together, these three 
simple changes result in a 60% increase in conversion (add to cart).
Figure 11-6 ​The TowelsDirect.co.uk product page was an ideal candidate for a multivariate test.
We have found that sometimes a middle ground is required. This is where you 
have variations that could for the most part be mixed up, but where there would be 

My Optimizer Tips ❘ 267
inappropriate combinations that you would not want to be shown. In this case, it is 
fine to proceed to set up a multivariate test, and you can go ahead and disable any 
inappropriate combinations right at the start of the test.
Another situation where only a multivariate test will work is where technical reasons 
make an A/B test unfeasible. If your pages are generated by a content management 
system or e-commerce platform (possibly using parameters on the URL) it could be 
very difficult to create alternative complete pages. In this case, you can still use the 
multivariate method, and you can even re-create something like an A/B test by dis-
abling all the combinations you do not want, as shown in Figure 11-7.
Figure 11-7 ​Using the multivariate method to create an A/B split test
The risk with this approach—and with A/B split testing in general—is that you 
can end up without a positive result and no clue as to how the individual changes 
performed. Figure 11-8 shows the two home pages we tested using the multivariate 
method, and the result is a marginal but conclusive 2.6% decrease in conversion rate 
(viewing a product page).
Here, I have made four changes: two different headers; showing or hiding the “Simply 
the Lowest...” heading; replacing the photo with the four panels showing key benefits; 
plus some CSS changes (including font size in the side nav). It may be that one or two 
of these changes delivered significant improvements, while the rest were detrimental, 
but because I did not run them as a proper multivariate test, I cannot know. Look-
ing at the performance of each section in Figure 11-7, it is impossible to tell which 
page section changes were significant, because they only ran as a combination, so all 
seemed to have the same effect.

268 ❘ Chapter 11: Optimizing Your Web Pages
Figure 11-8 ​Two variations of the Fastlec home page achieved similar results.
Goals
The second decision you will need to make is what to use as your goal. The choice is 
usually between the next step and the final goal. For example, do you test the effec-
tiveness of your service page by measuring the number of people who visit the contact 
page, or the number who actually submit a contact request? There are arguments for 
both approaches.
Ideally, you would always want to test a goal that has real business value, such as 
actual contact requests or actual sales. This is the most meaningful approach, because 
it looks at the whole funnel, the visitor’s experience as a symphony. There is little 
point getting more people to click through to a next step if they are not proceeding to 
the final goal.
On the other hand, because there is attrition at each step of the funnel, people will 
drop off at each step in the sequence, which results in fewer completed goals. The 
fewer goals you get, the longer it takes to see useful results. The longer your tests take, 
the longer it takes to respond and to optimize the user experience.
In the case of the Fastlec home page in Figure 11-8, we used “viewing any product 
detail page” as the goal, which is not a conversion but an intermediate step toward 
conversion. This resulted in very high click-through rates—over 80%—which, com-
bined with high traffic, produced a conclusive result in just 10 days. It could be 
argued that, although my variation produced a slightly lower click-through rate to 
product pages, it may still have generated more actual sales. In this example, it may 
have been worthwhile measuring conversions as sales.

My Optimizer Tips ❘ 269
There is no right answer to the question of what to use as a goal. I would offer three 
guidelines:
	
1.	
The higher your traffic, the more feasible it is to use more distant goals. If 
you have low traffic, you may get better results from running more short 
tests than waiting for a long experiment to complete.
	
2.	 Can you judge the impact of one page on the final conversion results? In 
many cases, getting more people to take one step forward can rationally be 
seen as a useful result.
	
3.	 How soon do you need to see results? If you have the capacity to run a new test 
every two weeks, there is little point setting up a test to complete in one week.
Using the GWO Duration Calculator
Google provides a handy calculator that can help you predict the length of time it will 
take for a test to produce conclusive results (www.google.com/analytics/siteopt/siteopt/
help/calculator.html). Just type in your best-guess figures, and the calculator will 
estimate the time your experiment will need to run.
Figure 11-9 shows three similar variations, which suggest how the input figures 
impact the duration of tests. The more combinations you have, the fewer page views 
you put through the test, the lower your conversion rate, and the lower the improve-
ment in conversion rate you expect, the longer your experiment will take.
Figure 11-9 ​Estimating the length of experiments using the Google Website Optimizer Duration Calculator
You may get a useful result in a shorter time than the calculator predicts. You do not 
have to wait for conclusive data, because you may manually (or automatically) disable 
poorly performing combinations, or select a leading combination and move on to a 
new test.
One thing you should notice from the calculator examples in Figure 11-9 is the 
importance of keeping the number of combinations down, which applies for both 

270 ❘ Chapter 11: Optimizing Your Web Pages
split and multivariate tests. Halving the combination count from 12 to 6 here reduces 
the experiment length by two thirds.
Using an Event as a Goal
Although GWO expects to find the conversion script on a particular page, you can 
also use a JavaScript event as a goal, which simulates a page load. To do this, look at 
the conversion script provided by GWO. It will have a line similar to the following 
one, which includes a 10-digit number:
gwoTracker._trackPageview(“/1234567890/goal”);
This is the method that needs to be called for the goal to register. You can then call it 
from any event, such as a simple click:
<div onClick=’gwoTracker._trackPageview(“/1234567890/goal”);’>
Guidelines for Testing
When setting up and running your tests, remember these general guidelines.
Broad Strokes First
The most important tip is: Test broad strokes changes first. You probably have dozens 
of ideas of things you could tweak easily, but if your goal is optimization you need to 
get the fundamentals right first. Assuming you have defined a good funnel of landing 
pages, focus first on testing the following on each page:
The overall 
u
u
proposition. It should be obvious what you are offering, and who 
you are offering it to. Your proposition should match at least one clearly 
defined need. If the page is not clearly about anything, test alternatives that 
project more direct messages.
A strong 
u
u
appeal to catch attention. Your headline and most getable features 
should engage with the target visitors—at their awareness level—and get their 
attention with the scent of some immediate benefit. Test different headlines, 
early paragraphs, and primary imagery.
Content to keep the visitor engaged. Can all the content justify its place on the 
u
u
page? Try adding or removing sections of content to see what keeps people’s 
interest, builds their anticipation, and carries them through to the final step.
Call to action
u
u
. Every page should have clear next steps. Calls to action should 
be both compelling and consistent with the expectations you have created.

My Optimizer Tips ❘ 271
Test Your Best
Consider your alternatives carefully before you set up the test. Do not rush the cre-
ative thinking and do not test random guesses. Have a good reason for every alterna-
tive you include, because poor results will teach you little.
A good principle is to be clear on the idea you are testing before you proceed. Write 
down what you expect to learn from the test, and craft your variations accordingly.
I strongly advise you use your best guess as the original combination, because that is 
the one option you cannot disable while the test is running. We have run a number of 
tests where several strong combinations remain competing against a clearly weaker 
original combination. This results in lower overall conversions through the duration 
of the test.
Polishing
When you are confident you have the broad strokes right, you can proceed to pol-
ish your content and design. As you move toward optimal performance, expect less 
dramatic improvements, but you may still find that even small visual and content 
changes can bring useful benefits.
Polish content by testing alternative wording. Shorten and rearrange sentences to be 
punchier and more readable. You can also try making keywords or phrases bold to 
draw more attention to them when people are scanning. Try adding more positive 
signs, resolving more possible concerns, adding extra useful information, or reinforc-
ing your points with additional testimonials and evidence.
Polish content imagery by testing alternative images, showing multiple images, alter-
ing their size and position on the page, or by zooming in to focus on more important 
aspects.
There is often scope for tweaking general graphic design factors. Use the noticeability 
factors (position, size, boldness, contrast, color, dynamism, and 3-D effects) to draw 
the eye to more important features and away from less important ones. Pay attention 
to areas of the page that seem busy or obvious, and ask whether those areas support 
the dynamic flow of information.
Finally, consider whether any elements on the page can simply be removed. Taking 
away unnecessary content or visual design always leaves more attention for higher-
value content.

272 ❘ Chapter 11: Optimizing Your Web Pages
Interpreting Your Results
The best way to learn to read the results from GWO is through the experience of your 
own experiments. Running optimization experiments can be exciting and compel-
ling. Try to resist the temptation to watch them on a daily basis to try to predict the 
outcome too early.
As with any numbers in business, ask whether the information you have gives you any-
thing you can act on decisively. Until the stats are actionable, do not sit and watch them. 
Your time would be better spent coming up with new ideas for your next experiment.
Figure 11-10 ​Sample GWO results. When should you disable a combination?
The experiment in Figure 11-10 shows a clear leader from the very start, which is very 
likely to be the winning combination, but beware of judging too soon. Figure 11-11 
shows a different test where the original combination (indicated by the black line) 
seemed to be a clear leader in the first week. However, two combinations finally out-
performed the original. The winning combination 5 was at one point the poorest 
performer. So avoid disabling combinations until the lines seem to have settled into a 
flat, parallel shape and have stopped switching order.
I tend to be quite aggressive in disabling combinations, preferring to complete an 
experiment as soon as I have a good idea of the likely winner. I will often immediately 

My Optimizer Tips ❘ 273
set up a new experiment to try to make further improvements. This seems to be a way 
to get quicker improvements than to wait for conclusive results each time.
Figure 11-11 ​Let your graph lines flatten out before betting on a winner.
One final point to highlight is that, in my opinion, the “Chance to Beat Orig” figure 
is not particularly helpful. It would be much more useful to see a “Chance to Win” 
percentage. That would give a clearer picture on which combinations could safely be 
removed.
Some Limitations of GWO
Google Website Optimizer is a great free tool, but it is not the perfect solution for 
every site and every circumstance. Every solution has its strengths and weaknesses. 
Here are some possible weaknesses to consider.
One distinctive feature of GWO is that it is a client-side solution that requires 
JavaScript that runs in the visitor’s browser. It will still work for about 99% of your 
visitors, which is more than enough to give you representative results.
However, the client-side method does mean that there are limits to what you can test. 
You are constrained to including all visitors to a page in your experiment. For example, 
you may prefer to show different experiments to visitors who are logged in, who have 
already purchased a product, or those who have not visited your site before. To achieve 
this, you would either need to direct those users to different pages, or use server-side 
code to display an alternative set of GWO JavaScript tags that belong to a different test.
Running a GWO test requires that you edit the client-side markup, which is not con-
venient for all sites, particularly where different sections of the HTML markup are 
generated by different server-side scripts or templates.
If you typically edit your page content in a content management system that uses a 
visual (WYSIWYG) editor, we have found that some of these can strip out JavaScript 
code when the content is saved.

274 ❘ Chapter 11: Optimizing Your Web Pages
GWO also forces each individual visitor to see the same content for the duration of 
the test (or while the cookie persists). For example, we ran a multivariate test to com-
pare variations of callout ads for an ebook in the side column on our web site. Visitors 
always saw the same ad on every article. If that ad did not work for them, it would 
keep on not working for them page after page, which reduced the chances of showing 
an ad that would get a click through. Ideally, I would prefer to be able to tell GWO to 
show a random combination each time, but this is not currently possible.
GWO does not allow you to re-enable a disabled combination in A/B or multivari-
ate tests. Nor can you modify any variation in a multivariate test—without stopping, 
copying, and re-starting the test. In this case, your statistics will start from scratch 
again. For this reason, it is very important that you take time to preview all the varia-
tions before you start a test running.
Creative Ways of Using GWO
Website Optimizer can also do more than it appears at first. Here are a few tricks that 
we have discovered.
note ​Many more are available if you are expert with JavaScript. Check out Eric 
Vasilik’s GWO Tricks at www.gwotricks.com to find out more advanced stuff.
You do not just have to put regular HTML content in multivariate options. CSS style 
information can be really useful too. CSS has the added benefit of adding a layer of 
separation, which enables you to make changes while a test is running. If you know 
you are going to test four different styles, you can set the content of your variations as 
HTML using different classnames, such as:
<script>utmx_section(“overall-style”)</script>
<div class=”style-brighter”></noscript>
You could create multiple variations of this div, each with a different classname. You 
do not have to specify what the classname “style-brighter” means at this point. Its 
properties can be set at any time in your style sheet, which means you can take more 
time to get the design right, even after the experiment has started.
Although GWO requires you to provide the address of one test page during setup of a 
multivariate experiment, you are not limited to running your test only on that page. 

The Way of Optimization ❘ 275
Copy the control script and sections onto other pages, and they will work everywhere. 
This is how we tested permutations of advertisements across 150 articles, simply by 
including the same code and markup in a single CMS template.
Likewise, you are not limited to having only one conversion page. You can include the 
conversion script on multiple pages, and any of those pages will count as a conver-
sion. This can be useful if you are also running an A/B test on the conversion page 
(resulting in more than one copy of that page).
The Way of Optimization
Optimizing your click-through rates from each page to the next is the final technique 
in your web site optimization toolkit, and completes the new approach. I hope I have 
shown that this method is not a one-time exercise. It is an ongoing process that has 
no logical end. Do not be limited by the low performance of the old way. The Web is 
massive and still growing at an incredible rate. You have more potential customers 
than you ever imagined, and now you have the tools to reach them, to connect with 
them, and to help them discover propositions that deliver exactly what they need.
It all starts with researching the real world. Keyword research shows you what 
u
u
people are actually looking for today, and gives you the means to keep discov-
ering new markets.
Multiplicity helps you turn your products and service into an ever-expanding 
u
u
range of finely tuned propositions.
The Awareness Ladder lets you structure a content strategy that can address 
u
u
all your prospects, exactly where they are.
The concentric model gives you a simple and logical structure that you can put 
u
u
into practice today, and which can grow organically at any rate you choose.
You know straightforward techniques for catching visitors’ attention and 
u
u
keeping them engaged with your content so that you can communicate your 
full message.
Finally, web page optimization gives you a way to increase click-through rates 
u
u
through all your funnels and incrementally optimize the performance of 
your site.
