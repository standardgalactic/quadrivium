NEW How Do You See It?
The How Do You See It? feature in each section presents 
a real-life problem that you will solve by visual inspection
using the concepts learned in the lesson. This exercise is
excellent for classroom discussion or test preparation.
REVISED Remark
These hints and tips reinforce or expand upon concepts,
help you learn how to study mathematics, caution you 
about common errors, address special cases, or show 
alternative or additional steps to a solution of an example.
REVISED Exercise Sets
The exercise sets have been carefully and extensively
examined to ensure they are rigorous and relevant 
and include all topics our users have suggested. The 
exercises have been reorganized and titled so you 
can better see the connections between examples and 
exercises. Multi-step, real-life exercises reinforce 
problem-solving skills and mastery of concepts by 
giving students the opportunity to apply the concepts 
in real-life situations.
Table of Contents Changes
Appendix A (Proofs of Selected Theorems) now
appears in video format at LarsonCalculus.com. 
The proofs also appear in text form at
CengageBrain.com.
Trusted Features
Applications
Carefully chosen applied exercises and examples 
are included throughout to address the question,
“When will I use this?” These applications are 
pulled from diverse sources, such as current events,
world data, industry trends, and more, and relate 
to a wide range of interests. Understanding where
calculus is (or can be) used promotes fuller under-
standing of the material.
Writing about Concepts
Writing exercises at the end of each section 
are designed to test your understanding of basic 
concepts in each section, encouraging you to 
verbalize and write answers and promote technical
communication skills that will be invaluable in 
your future careers.

Preface
Theorems
Theorems provide the conceptual framework for calculus. Theorems 
are clearly stated and separated from the rest of the text by boxes for quick 
visual reference. Key proofs often follow the theorem and can be found 
at LarsonCalculus.com.
Definitions
As with theorems, definitions are clearly 
stated using precise, formal wording and 
are separated from the text by boxes for 
quick visual reference.
Explorations
Explorations provide unique challenges 
to study concepts that have not yet been 
formally covered in the text. They allow 
you to learn by discovery and introduce 
topics related to ones presently being 
studied. Exploring topics in this way 
encourages you to think outside the box. 
Historical Notes and Biographies
Historical Notes provide you with background 
information on the foundations of calculus. 
The Biographies introduce you to the people 
who created and contributed to calculus. 
Technology
Throughout the book, technology boxes show 
you how to use technology to solve problems 
and explore concepts of calculus. These tips 
also point out some pitfalls of using technology.
Section Projects
Projects appear in selected sections and encourage 
you to explore applications related to the topics 
you are studying. They provide an interesting 
and engaging way for you and other students 
to work and investigate ideas collaboratively.
Putnam Exam Challenges
Putnam Exam questions appear in selected 
sections. These actual Putnam Exam questions 
will challenge you and push the limits of 
your understanding of calculus.
Definition of Definite Integral
If is defined on the closed interval 
and the limit of Riemann sums over 
partitions 
exists (as described above), then is said to be integrable on 
and the 
limit is denoted by
The limit is called the definite integral of from to 
The number is the
lower limit of integration, and the number is the upper limit of integration.

The Graph of an Equation
In 1637, the French mathematician René Descartes revolutionized the study of mathematics
by combining its two major fields—algebra and geometry. With Descartes’s coordinate
plane, geometric concepts could be formulated analytically and algebraic concepts
could be viewed graphically. The power of this approach was such that within a century
of its introduction, much of calculus had been developed.
The same approach can be followed in your study of calculus. That is, by viewing
calculus from multiple perspectives—graphically, analytically, and numerically—you
will increase your understanding of core concepts.
Consider the equation 
The point 
is a solution point of the
equation because the equation is satisfied (is true) when 2 is substituted for and 1 is
substituted for 
This equation has many other solutions, such as 
and 
To
find other solutions systematically, solve the original equation for 
Analytic approach
Then construct a table of values by substituting several values of 
Numerical approach
From the table, you can see that 
and 
are solutions of the original 
equation 
Like many equations, this 
equation has an infinite number of solutions. 
The set of all solution points is the graph of the 
equation, as shown in Figure 1.1. Note that the 
sketch shown in Figure 1.1 is referred to as 
the graph of 
even though it really 
represents only a portion of the graph. The 
entire graph would extend beyond the page.
In this course, you will study many sketching 
techniques. The simplest is point plotting—that is,
you plot points until the basic shape of the graph 
seems apparent.
Sketching a Graph by Point Plotting
To sketch the graph of 
first construct a table of values. Next, plot the points
shown in the table. Then connect the points with a smooth curve, as shown in Figure
1.2. This graph is a parabola. It is one of the conics you will study in Chapter 10.

RENÉ DESCARTES (1596–1650)
Descartes made many contributions
to philosophy, science, and 
mathematics.The idea of 
representing points in the plane
by pairs of real numbers and 
representing curves in the plane
by equations was described 
by Descartes in his book 
La Géométrie, published in 1637.

One disadvantage of point plotting is that to get a good idea about the shape of a
graph, you may need to plot many points. With only a few points, you could badly 
misrepresent the graph. For instance, to sketch the graph of
you plot five points:
and
as shown in Figure 1.3(a). From these five points, you might conclude that the graph is
a line. This, however, is not correct. By plotting several more points, you can see that
the graph is more complicated, as shown in Figure 1.3(b).

TECHNOLOGY
Graphing an equation has been made easier by technology.
Even with technology, however, it is possible to misrepresent a graph badly. For
instance, each of the graphing utility* screens in Figure 1.4 shows a portion of the
graph of
From the screen on the left, you might assume that the graph is a line. From the
screen on the right, however, you can see that the graph is not a line. So, whether you
are sketching a graph by hand or using a graphing utility, you must realize that 
different “viewing windows” can produce very different views of a graph. In choosing
a viewing window, your goal is to show a view of the graph that fits well in the 
context of the problem.

Intercepts of a Graph
Two types of solution points that are especially useful in graphing an equation are those
having zero as their - or -coordinate. Such points are called intercepts because they
are the points at which the graph intersects the - or -axis. The point 
is an
-intercept of the graph of an equation when it is a solution point of the equation. To
find the -intercepts of a graph, let 
be zero and solve the equation for

instance, consider the four graphs shown in Figure 1.5.

Example 2
uses an analytic approach to
finding intercepts. When an 
analytic approach is not possible,
you can use a graphical
approach by finding the points
at which the graph intersects the
axes. Use the trace feature of a
graphing utility to approximate
the intercepts of the graph of the
equation in Example 2. Note
that your utility may have a
built-in program that can find
the -intercepts of a graph.
(Your utility may call this the
root or zero feature.) If so,
use the program to find the
-intercepts of the graph 
of the equation in Example 2.

Symmetry of a Graph
Knowing the symmetry of a graph before attempting to sketch it is useful because you
need only half as many points to sketch the graph. The three types of symmetry listed
below can be used to help sketch the graphs of equations (see Figure 1.7).
1. A graph is symmetric with respect to the -axis if, whenever 
is a point on the
graph, then 
is also a point on the graph. This means that the portion of the
graph to the left of the axis is a mirror image of the portion to the right of the axis.
2. A graph is symmetric with respect to the 
axis if, whenever 
is a point on the
graph, then 
is also a point on the graph. This means that the portion of the
graph below the 
axis is a mirror image of the portion above the 
axis.
3. A graph is symmetric with respect to the origin if, whenever 
is a point on
the graph, then 
is also a point on the graph. This means that the graph is
unchanged by a rotation of 
about the origin.
The graph of a polynomial has symmetry with respect to the axis when each term
has an even exponent (or is a constant). For instance, the graph of
has symmetry with respect to the 
axis. Similarly, the graph of a polynomial has
symmetry with respect to the origin when each term has an odd exponent, as illustrated
in Example 3.
Testing for Symmetry
Test the graph of 
for symmetry with respect to (a) the -axis and (b) the
origin.
Solution
a.
Write original equation.
Replace by 
Simplify. It is not an equivalent equation.
Because replacing by 
does not yield an equivalent equation, you can conclude
that the graph of 
is not symmetric with respect to the -axis.
b.
Write original equation.
Replace by 
and by 
Simplify.
Equivalent equation
Because replacing 
by 
and 
by 
yields an equivalent equation, you can 
conclude that the graph of 
is symmetric with respect to the origin, as
shown in Figure 1.8.

This means that the portion of the graph below the 
axis is a mirror image of the
portion above the

above the 
axis. Then reflect in the 
axis to obtain the entire graph, as shown in 
Figure 1.9.
Points of Intersection
A point of intersection of the graphs of two equations is a point that satisfies both
equations. You can find the point(s) of intersection of two graphs by solving their
equations simultaneously.

Mathematical Models
Real-life applications of mathematics often use equations as mathematical models. In
developing a mathematical model to represent actual data, you should strive for two
(often conflicting) goals: accuracy and simplicity. That is, you want the model to be
simple enough to be workable, yet accurate enough to produce meaningful results.
Section 1.4 explores these goals more completely.
Comparing Two Mathematical Models
The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii records the carbon dioxide concentration (in
parts per million) in Earth’s atmosphere. The January readings for various years are
shown in Figure 1.11. In the July 1990 issue of Scientific American, these data were
used to predict the carbon dioxide level in Earth’s atmosphere in the year 2035, using
the quadratic model
Quadratic model for 1960–1990 data
where 
represents 1960, as shown in Figure 1.11(a). The data shown in Figure 1.11(b)
represent the years 1980 through 2010 and can be modeled by
Linear model for 1980–2010 data
where 
represents 1960. What was the prediction given in the Scientific American
article in 1990? Given the new data for 1990 through 2010, does this prediction for the
year 2035 seem accurate?
(a)
(b)
Figure 1.11
Solution
To answer the first question, substitute 
(for 2035) into the quadratic
model.
Quadratic model
So, the prediction in the Scientific American article was that the carbon dioxide
concentration in Earth’s atmosphere would reach about 470 parts per million in the year
2035. Using the linear model for the 1980–2010 data, the prediction for the year 2035 is
Linear model
So, based on the linear model for 1980–2010, it appears that the 1990 prediction was
too high.
The models in Example 6 were developed using a procedure called least squares
regression (see Section 13.9). The quadratic and linear models have correlations given
by 
and 
respectively. The closer 
is to 1, the “better” the model.

Write the equation of a line with a given point and slope.
Interpret slope as a ratio or as a rate in a real-life application.
Sketch the graph of a linear equation in slope-intercept form.
Write equations of lines that are parallel or perpendicular to a given line.
The Slope of a Line
The slope of a nonvertical line is a measure of the number of units the line rises (or
falls) vertically for each unit of horizontal change from left to right. Consider the two
points 
and 
on the line in Figure 1.12. As you move from left to right
along this line, a vertical change of
Change in 
units corresponds to a horizontal change of
Change in 
units. (
is the Greek uppercase letter delta, and the symbols 
and 
are read “delta
” and “delta .”)
When using the formula for slope, note that
So, it does not matter in which order you subtract as long as you are consistent and both
“subtracted coordinates” come from the same point.
Figure 1.13 shows four lines: one has a positive slope, one has a slope of zero, one
has a negative slope, and one has an “undefined” slope. In general, the greater the
absolute value of the slope of a line, the steeper the line. For instance, in Figure 1.13,
the line with a slope of 
is steeper than the line with a slope of 1

Equations of Lines
Any two points on a nonvertical line can be used to calculate its slope. This can be
verified from the similar triangles shown in Figure 1.14. (Recall that the ratios of
corresponding sides of similar triangles are equal.)

Ratios and Rates of Change
The slope of a line can be interpreted as either a ratio or a rate. If the 
and axes have
the same unit of measure, then the slope has no units and is a ratio. If the 
and axes 
have different units of measure, then the slope is a rate or rate of change. In your study
of calculus, you will encounter applications involving both interpretations of slope.
Using Slope as a Ratio
The maximum recommended slope of a wheelchair ramp is 
A business installs a
wheelchair ramp that rises to a height of 22 inches over a length of 24 feet, as shown in
Figure 1.16. Is the ramp steeper than recommended?
(Source: ADA Standards for
Accessible Design)
Figure 1.16
Solution
The length of the ramp is 24 feet or 
inches. The slope of the
ramp is the ratio of its height (the rise) to its length (the run).
Because the slope of the ramp is less than 
the ramp is not steeper than 
recommended. Note that the slope is a ratio and has no units.
Using Slope as a Rate of Change
The population of Colorado was about 4,302,000 in 2000 and about 5,029,000 in 2010.
Find the average rate of change of the population over this 10-year period. What will
the population of Colorado be in 2020?
(Source: U.S. Census Bureau)
Solution
Over this 10-year period, the average rate of change of the population of
Colorado was
Assuming that Colorado’s population continues to increase at this same rate for the next 
10 years, it will have a 2020 population of about 5,756,000 (see Figure 1.17).
The rate of change found in Example 3 is an average rate of change. An average
rate of change is always calculated over an interval. In this case, the interval is
In Chapter 3, you will study another type of rate of change called an
instantaneous rate of change.

Graphing Linear Models
Many problems in coordinate geometry can be classified into two basic categories.
1. Given a graph (or parts of it), find its equation.
2. Given an equation, sketch its graph.
For lines, problems in the first category can be solved by using the point-slope form. 
The point-slope form, however, is not especially useful for solving problems in the 
second category. The form that is better suited to sketching the graph of a line is the
slope-intercept form of the equation of a line.
Sketching Lines in the Plane
Sketch the graph of each equation.
a.
b.
c.
Solution
a. Because 
the intercept is 
Because the slope is 
you know that
the line rises two units for each unit it moves to the right, as shown in Figure 1.18(a).
b. By writing the equation 
in slope-intercept form
you can see that the slope is 
and the 
intercept is 
Because the slope
is zero, you know that the line is horizontal, as shown in Figure 1.18(b).
c. Begin by writing the equation in slope-intercept form.
Write original equation.
Isolate 
term on the left.
Slope-intercept form
In this form, you can see that the intercept is 
and the slope is 
This
means that the line falls one unit for every three units it moves to the right, as shown
in Figure 1.18(c).

Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
The slope of a line is a convenient tool for determining whether two lines are parallel

perpendicular.

REMARK
In mathematics,
the phrase “if and only if” is a
way of stating two implications
in one statement. For instance,
the first statement at the right
could be rewritten as the 
following two implications.
a. If two distinct nonvertical
lines are parallel, then their
slopes are equal.
b. If two distinct nonvertical
lines have equal slopes,
then they are parallel.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
The slope of a line will appear distorted if you use
different tick-mark spacing on the - and -axes. For instance, the graphing utility
screens in Figures 1.21(a) and 1.21(b) both show the lines
and
Because these lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals, they must be perpendicular.
In Figure 1.21(a), however, the lines don’t appear to be perpendicular because the
tick-mark spacing on the -axis is not the same as that on the -axis. In Figure
1.21(b), the lines appear perpendicular because the tick-mark spacing on the 
axis
is the same as on the 
axis. This type of viewing window is said to have a square
setting.
(a) Tick-mark spacing on the -axis is not the

Use function notation to represent and evaluate a function.
Find the domain and range of a function.
Sketch the graph of a function.
Identify different types of transformations of functions.
Classify functions and recognize combinations of functions.
Functions and Function Notation
A relation between two sets 
and 
is a set of ordered pairs, each of the form 
where is a member of

A function from

between 
and 
that has the property that any two ordered pairs with the same -value
also have the same -value. The variable is the independent variable, and the variable
is the dependent variable.
Many real-life situations can be modeled by functions. For instance, the area 
of
a circle is a function of the circle’s radius 
is a function of 
In this case,
is the independent variable and 
is the dependent variable.
Functions can be specified in a variety of ways. In this text, however, you will 
concentrate primarily on functions that are given by equations involving the dependent
and independent variables. For instance, the equation
Equation in implicit form
defines 
the dependent variable, as a function of 
the independent variable. To
evaluate this function (that is, to find the -value that corresponds to a given -value),
it is convenient to isolate on the left side of the equation.
Equation in explicit form
Using as the name of the function, you can write this equation as

writing the equation in explicit form.
Function notation has the advantage of clearly identifying the dependent variable

function itself is “ ” The symbol 
is read “ of ” Function notation allows you to be
less wordy. Instead of asking “What is the value of that corresponds to

FUNCTION NOTATION
The word function was first used
by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in
1694 as a term to denote any
quantity connected with a curve,
such as the coordinates of a point
on a curve or the slope of a
curve. Forty years later, Leonhard
Euler used the word “function” to
describe any expression made up
of a variable and some constants.
He introduced the notation
y  f x.

The Domain and Range of a Function
The domain of a function can be described explicitly, or it may be described implicitly
by an equation used to define the function. The implied domain is the set of all real
numbers for which the equation is defined, whereas an explicitly defined domain is one
that is given along with the function. For example, the function
has an explicitly defined domain given by 
On the other hand, the
function
has an implied domain that is the set 
Finding the Domain and Range of a Function
a. The domain of the function
is the set of all -values for which 
which is the interval 
To 
find the range, observe that 
is never negative. So, the range is the 
interval 
as shown in Figure 1.23(a).
b. The domain of the tangent function
is the set of all -values such that
is an integer.
Domain of tangent function
The range of this function is the set of all real numbers, as shown in Figure 1.23(b).
For a review of the characteristics of this and other trigonometric functions, see
Appendix C.

So, the 
domain is the set of all real numbers. On the 
portion of the domain for which 
the 
function behaves as in Example 2(a). For 
the values of

the range of the function is the interval 
(See Figure 1.24.)
A function from 
to 
is one-to-one when to each -value in the range there
corresponds exactly one -value in the domain. For instance, the function in Example
2(a) is one-to-one, whereas the functions in Examples 2(b) and 3 are not one-to-one. A
function from 
to 
is onto when its range consists of all of Y.

line intersects the graph at more than one point. For example, in Figure 1.26(a), you

Transformations of Functions
Some families of graphs have the same basic shape. For example, compare the graph of
with the graphs of the four other quadratic functions shown in Figure 1.28.
(a) Vertical shift upward
(b) Horizontal shift to the left
(c) Reflection
(d) Shift left, reflect, and shift upward

Each of the graphs in Figure 1.28 is a transformation of the graph of 
The
three basic types of transformations illustrated by these graphs are vertical shifts,
horizontal shifts, and reflections. Function notation lends itself well to describing 
transformations of graphs in the plane. For instance, using
Original function
as the original function, the transformations shown in Figure 1.28 can be represented
by these equations.

Classifications and Combinations of Functions
The modern notion of a function is derived from the efforts of many seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century mathematicians. Of particular note was Leonhard Euler, who 
introduced the function notation 
By the end of the eighteenth century,
mathematicians and scientists had concluded that many real-world phenomena could be
represented by mathematical models taken from a collection of functions called 
elementary functions. Elementary functions fall into three categories.
1. Algebraic functions (polynomial, radical, rational)
2. Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, and so on)
3. Exponential and logarithmic functions
You can review the trigonometric functions in Appendix C. The other nonalgebraic
functions, such as the inverse trigonometric functions and the exponential and logarithmic
functions, are introduced in Sections 1.5 and 1.6.
The most common type of algebraic function is a polynomial function
where 
is a nonnegative integer. The numbers 
are coefficients, with 
the leading
coefficient and 
the constant term of the polynomial function. If 
then 
is
the degree of the polynomial function. The zero polynomial 
is not assigned 
a degree. It is common practice to use subscript notation for coefficients of general
polynomial functions, but for polynomial functions of low degree, these simpler forms
are often used. Note that 
Zeroth degree:
Constant function
First degree:
Linear function
Second degree:
Quadratic function
Third degree:
Cubic function
Although the graph of a nonconstant polynomial function can have several turns,
eventually the graph will rise or fall without bound as 
moves to the right or left.
Whether the graph of
eventually rises or falls can be determined by the function’s degree (odd or even) and
by the leading coefficient 
as indicated in Figure 1.29. Note that the dashed portions
of the graphs indicate that the Leading Coefficient Test determines only the right and
left behavior of the graph.

Just as a rational number can be written as the quotient of two integers, a rational
function can be written as the quotient of two polynomials. Specifically, a function is
rational when it has the form
where 
and 
are polynomials.
Polynomial functions and rational functions are examples of algebraic functions.
An algebraic function of 
is one that can be expressed as a finite number of sums,
differences, multiples, quotients, and radicals involving

trigonometric functions are transcendental.
Two functions can be combined in various ways to create new functions. For

You can combine two functions in yet another way, called composition. The

In Section 1.1, an -intercept of a graph was defined to be a point

Fitting a Linear Model to Data
A basic premise of science is that much of the physical world can be described
mathematically and that many physical phenomena are predictable. This scientific outlook
was part of the scientific revolution that took place in Europe during the late 1500s. Two
early publications connected with this revolution were On the Revolutions of the
Heavenly Spheres by the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus and On the Fabric of
the Human Body by the Belgian anatomist Andreas Vesalius. Each of these books was
published in 1543, and each broke with prior tradition by suggesting the use of a scientific
method rather than unquestioned reliance on authority.
One basic technique of modern science is gathering data and then describing the
data with a mathematical model. For instance, the data in Example 1 are inspired by
Leonardo da Vinci’s famous drawing that indicates that a person’s height and arm span
are equal.
Fitting a Linear Model to Data
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A class of 28 people collected the data shown below, which represent their heights 
and arm spans (rounded to the nearest inch).
Find a linear model to represent these data.
Solution
There are different ways to model these data with an equation. The
simplest would be to observe that 
and 
are about the same and list the model as
simply 
A more careful analysis would be to use a procedure from statistics called
linear regression. (You will study this procedure in Section 13.9.) The least squares
regression line for these data is
Least squares regression line
The graph of the model and the data are shown in Figure 1.32. From this model, you
can see that a person’s arm span tends to be about the same as his or her height.

TECHNOLOGY
Many graphing utilities have built-in least squares regression
programs. Typically, you enter the data into the calculator and then run the linear
regression program. The program usually displays the slope and -intercept of the
best-fitting line and the correlation coefficient
The correlation coefficient gives a
measure of how well the data can be modeled by a line. The closer 
is to 1, the better
the data can be modeled by a line. For instance, the correlation coefficient for the model
in Example 1 is 
which indicates that the linear model is a good fit for the
data. If the -value is positive, then the variables have a positive correlation, as in
Example 1. If the -value is negative, then the variables have a negative correlation.

Fitting a Quadratic Model to Data
A function that gives the height of a falling object in terms of the time is called a
position function. If air resistance is not considered, then the position of a falling object
can be modeled by
where is the acceleration due to gravity,
is the initial velocity, and 
is the initial height.
The value of 
depends on where the object is dropped. On Earth,
is approximately
feet per second per second, or 
meters per second per second.
To discover the value of experimentally, you could record the heights of a falling
object at several increments, as shown in Example 2.
Fitting a Quadratic Model to Data
A basketball is dropped from a height of about 
feet. The height of the basketball is
recorded 23 times at intervals of about 0.02 second. The results are shown in the table.
Find a model to fit these data. Then use the model to predict the time when the 
basketball will hit the ground.
Solution
Begin by sketching a scatter plot of the data, as shown in Figure 1.33. From
the scatter plot, you can see that the data do not appear to be linear. It does appear,
however, that they might be quadratic. To check this, enter the data into a graphing 
utility that has a quadratic regression program. You should obtain the model
Least squares regression quadratic
Using this model, you can predict the time when the basketball hits the ground by
substituting 0 for and solving the resulting equation for 
Let 
Quadratic Formula
Choose positive solution.
The solution is about 0.54 second. In other words, the basketball will continue to fall
for about 0.1 second more before hitting the ground. (Note that the experimental value
of is 
or 
feet per second per second.)

Fitting a Trigonometric Model to Data
What is mathematical modeling? This is one of the questions that is asked in the book
Guide to Mathematical Modelling. Here is part of the answer.* 
1. Mathematical modeling consists of applying your mathematical skills to obtain useful
answers to real problems.
2. Learning to apply mathematical skills is very different from learning mathematics
itself.
3. Models are used in a very wide range of applications, some of which do not appear
initially to be mathematical in nature.
4. Models often allow quick and cheap evaluation of alternatives, leading to optimal
solutions that are not otherwise obvious.
5. There are no precise rules in mathematical modeling and no “correct” answers.
6. Modeling can be learned only by doing.
Fitting a Trigonometric Model to Data
The number of hours of daylight on a given day on Earth depends on the latitude and the
time of year. Here are the numbers of minutes of daylight at a location of 
latitude
on the longest and shortest days of the year: June 21, 801 minutes; December 22,
655 minutes. Use these data to write a model for the amount of daylight 
(in minutes)
on each day of the year at a location of 
latitude. How could you check the accuracy
of your model?
Solution
Here is one way to create a model. You can hypothesize that the model is
a sine function whose period is 365 days. Using the given data, you can conclude that
the amplitude of the graph is 
or 73. So, one possible model is
In this model,
represents the number of each day of the year, with December 22 
represented by 
A graph of this model is shown in Figure 1.34. To check the 
accuracy of this model, a weather almanac was used to find the numbers of minutes of
daylight on different days of the year at the location of 
latitude.

Existence of an Inverse Function
Not every function has an inverse, and the Reflective Property of Inverse Functions 
suggests a graphical test for those that do—the Horizontal Line Test for an inverse
function. This test states that a function has an inverse function if and only if every
horizontal line intersects the graph of at most once (see Figure 1.38). The next definition
formally states why the Horizontal Line Test is valid.
The Existence of an Inverse Function
Which of the functions has an inverse function?
a.
b.
Solution
a. From the graph of shown in Figure 1.39(a), it appears that is one-to-one over its
entire domain. To verify this, suppose that there exist 
and 
such that 
By showing that 
it follows that is one-to-one.
Because is one-to-one, you can conclude that must have an inverse function.
b. From the graph of shown in Figure 1.39(b), you can see that the function does not
pass the Horizontal Line Test. In other words, it is not one-to-one. For instance, has
the same value when 
0, and 1.
Not one-to-one
Therefore,
does not have an inverse function.
Often it is easier to prove that a function has an inverse function than to find the
inverse function. For instance, by sketching the graph of 
you can see that it is one-to-one. Yet it would be difficult to determine the inverse of this
function algebraically.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions
From the graphs of the six basic trigonometric functions, you can see that they do not
have inverse functions. (Graphs of the six basic trigonometric functions are shown in
Appendix C.) The functions that are called “inverse trigonometric functions” are actually
inverses of trigonometric functions whose domains have been restricted.
For instance, in Example 4, you saw that the sine function is one-to-one on the
interval 
(see Figure 1.42). On this interval, you can define the inverse of
the restricted sine function as
if and only if
where 
and
From Figures 1.42 (a) and (b), you can see that you can obtain the graph of 
by reflecting the graph of 
in the line 
on the interval 
(a)
(b)
Figure 1.42
Under suitable restrictions, each of the six trigonometric functions is one-to-one
and so has an inverse function, as indicated in the next definition. (The term “iff” is used
to represent the phrase “if and only if.”)
The term 
is read as “the arcsine of ” or sometimes “the angle whose sine
is .” An alternative notation for the inverse sine function is sin1 x.

Inverse Secant Function

the inverse secant function 
is defined by restricting the
domain of the secant 
function to the intervals
Most other texts and reference
books agree with this, but
some disagree. What other
domains might make sense?
Explain your reasoning
graphically. Most calculators

function?

Exponential Functions
An exponential function involves a constant raised to a power, such as 
You

For irrational values of 
you can define

numbers that approach 
A full discussion of this process would not be appropriate
now, but here is the general idea. To define the number

From these calculations, it seems reasonable to conclude that
In practice, you can use a calculator to approximate numbers such as 
In general, you can use any positive base 
to define an exponential
function. So, the exponential function with base 
is written as

Solution
To sketch the graphs of these functions by hand, you can complete a table
of values, plot the corresponding points, and connect the points with smooth curves.
Another way to graph these functions is to use a graphing utility. In either case, you
should obtain graphs similar to those shown in Figure 1.46. Note that the graphs of 
and are increasing, and the graph of is decreasing. Also, the graph of is increasing
more rapidly than the graph of

The Number 
In calculus, the natural (or convenient) choice for a base of an exponential number is
the irrational number 
whose decimal approximation is
This choice may seem anything but natural. The convenience of this particular base,
however, will become apparent as you continue in this course.
Investigating the Number 
Describe the behavior of the function 
at values of that are close to 0.
Solution
One way to examine the values of 
near 0 is to construct a table.
From the table, it appears that the closer gets to 0, the closer 
gets to The graph
of shown in Figure 1.48 supports this conclusion. Try using a graphing calculator to obtain
this graph. Then zoom in closer and closer to 
Although is not defined when 
it is defined for -values that are arbitrarily close to zero. By zooming in, you can see that
the value of 
gets closer and closer to 
as gets closer and closer 
to 0. Later, when you study limits, you will learn that this result can be written as
which is read as “the limit of

The Natural Logarithmic Function
Because the natural exponential function 
is one-to-one, it must have an inverse function. Its inverse is called the natural logarithmic
function. The domain of the natural logarithmic function is the set of positive real 
numbers.
This definition tells you that a logarithmic equation can be written in an equivalent
exponential form, and vice versa. Here are some examples.
Because the function 
is defined to be the inverse of 
it follows
that the graph of the natural logarithmic function is a reflection of the graph of the
natural exponential function in the line 
as shown in Figure 1.50. Several other
properties of the natural logarithmic function also follow directly from its definition as
the inverse of the natural exponential function.
Because 
and 
are inverses of each other, you can conclude that
One of the properties of exponents states that when you multiply two exponential
functions (having the same base), you add their exponents. For instance,
The logarithmic version of this property states that the natural logarithm of the product
of two numbers is equal to the sum of the natural logs of the numbers. That is,
This property and the properties dealing with the natural log of a quotient and the 
natural log of a power are listed on the next page.

Understand what calculus is and how it compares with precalculus.
Understand that the tangent line problem is basic to calculus.
Understand that the area problem is also basic to calculus.
What Is Calculus?
Calculus is the mathematics of change. For instance, calculus is the mathematics of
velocities, accelerations, tangent lines, slopes, areas, volumes, arc lengths, centroids,
curvatures, and a variety of other concepts that have enabled scientists, engineers, and
economists to model real-life situations.
Although precalculus mathematics also deals with velocities, accelerations, tangent
lines, slopes, and so on, there is a fundamental difference between precalculus mathematics
and calculus. Precalculus mathematics is more static, whereas calculus is more dynamic.
Here are some examples.
• An object traveling at a constant velocity can be analyzed with precalculus
mathematics. To analyze the velocity of an accelerating object, you need calculus.
• The slope of a line can be analyzed with precalculus mathematics. To analyze the
slope of a curve, you need calculus.
• The curvature of a circle is constant and can be analyzed with precalculus mathematics.
To analyze the variable curvature of a general curve, you need calculus.
• The area of a rectangle can be analyzed with precalculus mathematics. To analyze the
area under a general curve, you need calculus.
Each of these situations involves the same general strategy—the reformulation of
precalculus mathematics through the use of a limit process. So, one way to answer the
question “What is calculus?” is to say that calculus is a “limit machine” that involves
three stages. The first stage is precalculus mathematics, such as the slope of a line or
the area of a rectangle. The second stage is the limit process, and the third stage is a new
calculus formulation, such as a derivative or integral.
Some students try to learn calculus as if it were simply a collection of 
new formulas. This is unfortunate. If you reduce calculus to the memorization of 
differentiation and integration formulas, you will miss a great deal of understanding,
self-confidence, and satisfaction.
On the next two pages are listed some familiar precalculus concepts coupled with
their calculus counterparts. Throughout the text, your goal should be to learn how 
precalculus formulas and techniques are used as building blocks to produce the more
general calculus formulas and techniques. Don’t worry if you are unfamiliar with some
of the “old formulas” listed on the next two pages—you will be reviewing all of them.
As you proceed through this text, come back to this discussion repeatedly. Try 
to keep track of where you are relative to the three stages involved in the study of 
calculus. For instance, note how these chapters relate to the three stages.

REMARK
As you progress
through this course, remember
that learning calculus is just 
one of your goals. Your most
important goal is to learn how 
to use calculus to model and
solve real-life problems. Here
are a few problem-solving
strategies that may help you.
• Be sure you understand the
question. What is given? 
What are you asked to find?
• Outline a plan. There are 
many approaches you could
use: look for a pattern, solve 
a simpler problem, work 
backwards, draw a diagram,
use technology, or any of
many other approaches.
• Complete your plan. Be 
sure to answer the question.
Verbalize your answer. For
example, rather than writing
the answer as 
it
would be better to write the
answer as, “The area of the
region is 4.6 square meters.”
• Look back at your work. 
Does your answer make 
sense? Is there a way you 
can check the reasonableness
of your answer?

The Tangent Line Problem
The notion of a limit is fundamental to the study of calculus. The following brief
descriptions of two classic problems in calculus—the tangent line problem and the area
problem—should give you some idea of the way limits are used in calculus.
In the tangent line problem, you are given a function and a point 
on its graph
and are asked to find an equation of the tangent line to the graph at point 
as shown
in Figure 2.1.
Except for cases involving a vertical tangent line, the problem of finding the
tangent line at a point 
is equivalent to finding the slope of the tangent line at 
You
can approximate this slope by using a line through the point of tangency and a second
point on the curve, as shown in Figure 2.2(a). Such a line is called a secant line. If
is the point of tangency and 
is a second point on the graph of 
then the slope of the secant line through these two
points can be found using precalculus and is
(a) The secant line through 
and 
(b) As 
approaches 
the secant lines
approach the tangent line.
Figure 2.2
As point 
approaches point 
the slopes of the secant lines approach the slope of
the tangent line, as shown in Figure 2.2(b). When such a “limiting position” exists, the
slope of the tangent line is said to be the limit of the slopes of the secant lines. (Much
more will be said about this important calculus concept in Chapter 3.)

The Area Problem
In the tangent line problem, you saw how the limit process can be applied to the slope
of a line to find the slope of a general curve. A second classic problem in calculus is
finding the area of a plane region that is bounded by the graphs of functions. This 
problem can also be solved with a limit process. In this case, the limit process is applied
to the area of a rectangle to find the area of a general region.
As a simple example, consider the region bounded by the graph of the function
the axis, and the vertical lines 
and 
as shown in Figure 2.3. You
can approximate the area of the region with several rectangular regions, as shown 
in Figure 2.4. As you increase the number of rectangles, the approximation tends to
become better and better because the amount of area missed by the rectangles decreases.
Your goal is to determine the limit of the sum of the areas of the rectangles as the number
of rectangles increases without bound.

In one of the most astounding
events ever to occur in mathe-
matics, it was discovered that 
the tangent line problem and the
area problem are closely related.
This discovery led to the birth of
calculus.You will learn about the
relationship between these two
problems when you study the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
in Chapter 5.

Finding Limits Graphically and Numerically
Estimate a limit using a numerical or graphical approach.
Learn different ways that a limit can fail to exist.
Study and use a formal definition of limit.
An Introduction to Limits
To sketch the graph of the function
for values other than 
you can use standard curve-sketching techniques. At 
however, it is not clear what to expect. To get an idea of the behavior of the graph of 
near 
you can use two sets of 
values—one set that approaches 1 from the left
and one set that approaches 1 from the right, as shown in the table.
The graph of 
is a parabola that has a gap at the point 
as shown in 
Figure 2.5. Although 
cannot equal 1, you can move arbitrarily close to 1, and as a
result 
moves arbitrarily close to 3. Using limit notation, you can write
This is read as “the limit of 
as approaches 1 is 3.”
This discussion leads to an informal definition of limit. If 
becomes arbitrarily close
to a single number 
as 
approaches 
from either side, then the limit of 
as 
approaches 
is 
This limit is written as

Estimating a Limit Numerically
Evaluate the function 
at several -values near 0 and use the
results to estimate the limit
Solution
The table lists the values of 
for several 
values near 0.
From the results shown in the table, you can estimate the limit to be 2. This limit is
reinforced by the graph of (see Figure 2.6).
In Example 1, note that the function is undefined at 
and yet 
appears to 
be approaching a limit as 
approaches 0. This often happens, and it is important to 
realize that the existence or nonexistence of 
at 
has no bearing on the
existence of the limit of 
as approaches 
Finding a Limit
Find the limit of 
as approaches 2, where
Solution
Because 
for all other than 
you can estimate that the limit
is 1, as shown in Figure 2.7. So, you can write
The fact that 
has no bearing on the existence or value of the limit as 
approaches 2. For instance, as approaches 2, the function
has the same limit as 
So far in this section, you have been estimating limits numerically and graphically.
Each of these approaches produces an estimate of the limit. In Section 2.3, you will
study analytic techniques for evaluating limits. Throughout the course, try to develop a
habit of using this three-pronged approach to problem solving.
1. Numerical approach
Construct a table of values.
2. Graphical approach
Draw a graph by hand or using technology.
3. Analytic approach
Use algebra or calculus.

Limits That Fail to Exist
In the next three examples, you will examine some limits that fail to exist.
Different Right and Left Behavior
Show that the limit 
does not exist.
Solution
Consider the graph of the function
In Figure 2.8 and from the definition of absolute value,
Definition of absolute value
you can see that 
So, no matter how close 
gets to 0, there will be both positive and negative 
values
that yield 
or 
Specifically, if 
(the lowercase Greek letter delta) 
is a positive number, then for 
values satisfying the inequality 
you can 
classify the values of 
as
or
Because 
approaches a different number from the right side of 0 than it approaches
from the left side, the limit 
does not exist.
Unbounded Behavior
Discuss the existence of the limit 
Solution
Consider the graph of the function
In Figure 2.9, you can see that as approaches 0 from either the right or the left,
increases without bound. This means that by choosing 
close enough to 0, you can
force 
to be as large as you want. For instance,
will be greater than 100 when you
choose within 
of 0. That is,
Similarly, you can force 
to be greater than 1,000,000, as shown.
Because 
does not become arbitrarily close to a single number 
as approaches 0,
you can conclude that the limit does not exist.

Oscillating Behavior

Discuss the existence of the limit 
Solution
Let 
In Figure 2.10, you can see that as 
approaches 0,
oscillates between 
and 1. So, the limit does not exist because no matter how
small you choose , it is possible to choose 
and 
within 
units of 0 such that

as shown in the table.
There are many other interesting functions that have unusual limit behavior. An
often cited one is the Dirichlet function
.
Because this function has no limit at any real number 
it is not continuous at any real

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
When you use a graphing utility to investigate the
behavior of a function near the 
value at which you are trying to evaluate a limit,
remember that you can’t always trust the pictures that graphing utilities draw. When
you use a graphing utility to graph the function in Example 5 over an interval 
containing 0, you will most likely obtain an incorrect graph such as that shown in
Figure 2.11. The reason that a graphing utility can’t show the correct graph is that the
graph has infinitely many oscillations over any interval that contains 0.

PETER GUSTAV DIRICHLET
(1805–1859)
In the early development of 
calculus, the definition of a function
was much more restricted than it
is today, and “functions” such as
the Dirichlet function would not
have been considered.The modern
definition of function is attributed
to the German mathematician
Peter Gustav Dirichlet.

A Formal Definition of Limit
Consider again the informal definition of limit. If 
becomes arbitrarily close to a 
single number 
as approaches from either side, then the limit of 
as approaches
is 
written as
At first glance, this definition looks fairly technical. Even so, it is informal because
exact meanings have not yet been given to the two phrases
“
becomes arbitrarily close to 
and
approaches 
The first person to assign mathematically rigorous meanings to these two phrases was
Augustin-Louis Cauchy. His -
definition of limit is the standard used today.
In Figure 2.12, let 
(the lowercase Greek letter epsilon) represent a (small)
positive number. Then the phrase 
becomes arbitrarily close to 
means that 
lies in the interval 
Using absolute value, you can write this as
Similarly, the phrase 
approaches 
means that there exists a positive number such
that 
lies in either the interval 
or the interval 
This fact can be 
concisely expressed by the double inequality
The first inequality
The distance between and is more than 0.
expresses the fact that 
The second inequality
is within units of 
says that is within a distance of 
Some functions do not have limits as approaches 
but those that do cannot have
two different limits as approaches 
That is, if the limit of a function exists, then the
limit is unique (see Exercise 77).

definition of limit to prove that
Solution
You must show that for each 
there exists a 
such that
whenever
To find an appropriate 
begin by writing 
For all in the
interval 
and thus 
So, letting 
be the minimum of 
and 1, it follows that, whenever 
you have
As you can see in Figure 2.15, for -values within of 
the values of 
are
within 
of 4.
Throughout this chapter, you will use the 
definition of limit primarily to prove
theorems about limits and to establish the existence or nonexistence of particular types
of limits. For finding limits, you will learn techniques that are easier to use than the 
definition of limit.

A Strategy for Finding Limits
On the previous three pages, you studied several types of functions whose limits can be
evaluated by direct substitution. This knowledge, together with the next theorem, can
be used to develop a strategy for finding limits.

A Strategy for Finding Limits
1. Learn to recognize which limits can be evaluated by direct substitution. 
(These limits are listed in Theorems 2.1 through 2.6.)
2. When the limit of 
as approaches cannot be evaluated by direct 
substitution, try to find a function that agrees with for all other than 
[Choose such that the limit of 
can be evaluated by direct 
substitution.] Then apply Theorem 2.7 to conclude analytically that

Dividing Out Technique
One procedure for finding a limit analytically is the dividing out technique. This 
technique involves dividing out common factors, as shown in Example 7.
Dividing Out Technique
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Find the limit:
Solution
Although you are taking the limit of a rational function, you cannot apply
Theorem 2.3 because the limit of the denominator is 0.
Direct substitution fails.
Because the limit of the numerator is also 0, the numerator and denominator have 
a common factor of 
So, for all 
you can divide out this factor to obtain 
Using Theorem 2.7, it follows that
Apply Theorem 2.7.
Use direct substitution.
This result is shown graphically in Figure 2.18. Note that the graph of the function 
coincides with the graph of the function 
except that the graph of has
a gap at the point 
In Example 7, direct substitution produced the meaningless fractional form 
An
expression such as 
is called an indeterminate form because you cannot (from the
form alone) determine the limit. When you try to evaluate a limit and encounter this
form, remember that you must rewrite the fraction so that the new denominator does not
have 0 as its limit. One way to do this is to divide out like factors. Another way is to use
the rationalizing technique shown on the next page.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
A graphing utility can give misleading information
about the graph of a function. For instance, try graphing the function from

On most graphing utilities, the graph appears to 
be defined at every real number. However,

Rationalizing Technique
Another way to find a limit analytically is the rationalizing technique, which involves
rationalizing the numerator of a fractional expression. Recall that rationalizing the
numerator means multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the
numerator. For instance, to rationalize the numerator of
multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of

The Squeeze Theorem
The next theorem concerns the limit of a function that is squeezed between two other
functions, each of which has the same limit at a given value, as shown in Figure 2.21.
You can see the usefulness of the Squeeze Theorem (also called the Sandwich
Theorem or the Pinching Theorem) in the proof of Theorem 2.9.
Proof
The proof of the second limit is left as an exercise (see Exercise 127). Recall
from Section 1.6 that the third limit is actually the definition of the number 
To avoid
the confusion of two different uses of 
the proof of the first limit is presented using

Continuity and One-Sided Limits
Determine continuity at a point and continuity on an open interval.
Determine one-sided limits and continuity on a closed interval.
Use properties of continuity.
Understand and use the Intermediate Value Theorem.
Continuity at a Point and on an Open Interval
In mathematics, the term continuous has much the same meaning as it has in everyday
usage. Informally, to say that a function is continuous at 
means that there is no
interruption in the graph of at 
That is, its graph is unbroken at 
and there are no
holes, jumps, or gaps. Figure 2.25 identifies three values of at which the graph of is
not continuous. At all other points in the interval 
the graph of is uninterrupted
and continuous.
Three conditions exist for which the graph of is not continuous at 
Figure 2.25
In Figure 2.25, it appears that continuity at 
can be destroyed by any one of
three conditions.
1. The function is not defined at 
2. The limit of 
does not exist at 
3. The limit of 
exists at 
but it is not equal to 
If none of the three conditions is true, then the function is called continuous at

indicated in the important definition below.

Definition of Continuity
Continuity at a Point
A function is continuous at

3.
Continuity on an Open Interval
A function is continuous on an open interval
when the function is 
continuous at each point in the interval. A function that is continuous on the 
entire real number line 
is everywhere continuous.

Exploration
Informally, you might say
that a function is continuous
on an open interval when its
graph can be drawn with a
pencil without lifting the
pencil from the paper. Use 
a graphing utility to graph
each function on the given
interval. From the graphs,
which functions would you
say are continuous on the
interval? Do you think you
can trust the results you
obtained graphically?
Explain your reasoning.

have found that this terminology
can be confusing. Rather than
saying that the function is

One-Sided Limits and Continuity on a Closed Interval
To understand continuity on a closed interval, you first need to look at a different type
of limit called a one-sided limit. For instance, the limit from the right (or right-hand
limit) means that 
approaches 
from values greater than 
[see Figure 2.28(a)]. This
limit is denoted as
Limit from the right
Similarly, the limit from the left (or left-hand limit) means that 
approaches 
from
values less than [see Figure 2.28(b)]. This limit is denoted as
Limit from the left
One-sided limits are useful in taking limits of functions involving radicals. For instance,
if is an even integer, then
A One-Sided Limit
Find the limit of 
as approaches 
from the right.
Solution
As shown in Figure 2.29, the limit as approaches 
from the right is
One-sided limits can be used to investigate the behavior of step functions. One
common type of step function is the greatest integer function
defined as
Greatest integer function
For instance,
and 
The Greatest Integer Function
Find the limit of the greatest integer function
as approaches 0 from the left and
from the right.
Solution
As shown in Figure 2.30, the limit 
as approaches 0 from the left is
and the limit as approaches 0 from the right is
The greatest integer function has a discontinuity
at zero because the left- and right-hand limits at 
zero are different. By similar reasoning, you 
can see that the greatest integer function has a discontinuity at any integer n.

When the limit from the left is not equal to the limit from the right, the (two-sided)
limit does not exist. The next theorem makes this more explicit. The proof of this 
theorem follows directly from the definition of a one-sided limit.
The concept of a one-sided limit allows you to extend the definition of continuity
to closed intervals. Basically, a function is continuous on a closed interval when it is
continuous in the interior of the interval and exhibits one-sided continuity at the 
endpoints. This is stated formally in the next definition.
Similar definitions can be made to cover continuity on intervals of the form 
and 
that are neither open nor closed, or on infinite intervals. For example,
is continuous on the infinite interval 
and the function
is continuous on the infinite interval

The next example shows how a one-sided limit can be used to determine the value
of absolute zero on the Kelvin scale.
Charles’s Law and Absolute Zero
On the Kelvin scale, absolute zero is the temperature 0 K. Although temperatures very
close to 0 K have been produced in laboratories, absolute zero has never been attained.
In fact, evidence suggests that absolute zero cannot be attained. How did scientists
determine that 0 K is the “lower limit” of the temperature of matter? What is absolute
zero on the Celsius scale?
Solution
The determination of absolute zero stems from the work of the French
physicist Jacques Charles (1746–1823). Charles discovered that the volume of gas at a
constant pressure increases linearly with the temperature of the gas. The table illustrates
this relationship between volume and temperature. To generate the values in the table,
one mole of hydrogen is held at a constant pressure of one atmosphere. The volume 
is approximated and is measured in liters, and the temperature is measured in degrees
Celsius.
The points represented by the table are shown 
in Figure 2.33. Moreover, by using the points 
in the table, you can determine that 
and 
are related by the linear equation
Solving for 
you get an equation for the 
temperature of the gas.
By reasoning that the volume of the gas 
can approach 0 (but can never equal or 
go below 0), you can determine that the 
“least possible temperature” is
Use direct substitution.
So, absolute zero on the Kelvin scale 0 K is approximately 
on the Celsius
scale.
The table below shows the temperatures in Example 5 converted to the Fahrenheit
scale. Try repeating the solution shown in Example 5 using these temperatures and 
volumes. Use the result to find the value of absolute zero on the Fahrenheit scale.

Properties of Continuity
In Section 2.3, you studied several properties of limits. Each of those properties yields
a corresponding property pertaining to the continuity of a function. For instance,
Theorem 2.11 follows directly from Theorem 2.2.
The list below summarizes the functions you have studied so far that are continuous
at every point in their domains.

2. Rational:
3. Radical:

5. Exponential and logarithmic:
By combining Theorem 2.11 with this list, you can conclude that a wide variety of 
elementary functions are continuous at every point in their domains.

The Intermediate Value Theorem
Theorem 2.13 is an important theorem concerning the behavior of functions that are
continuous on a closed interval.
As an example of the application of the Intermediate Value Theorem, consider a
person’s height. A girl is 5 feet tall on her thirteenth birthday and 5 feet 7 inches tall on
her fourteenth birthday. Then, for any height between 5 feet and 5 feet 7 inches, there
must have been a time when her height was exactly 
This seems reasonable because
human growth is continuous and a person’s height does not abruptly change from one
value to another.
The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of at least one number 
in the closed interval 
There may, of course, be more than one number such that
as shown in Figure 2.35. A function that is not continuous does not necessarily exhibit
the intermediate value property. For example, the graph of the function shown in 
Figure 2.36 jumps over the horizontal line
and for this function there is no value of in 
such that 
is continuous on

Determining Infinite Limits from a Graph
Determine the limit of each function shown in Figure 2.41 as approaches 1 from the
left and from the right.
(a)
(b)
Each graph has an asymptote at 
Figure 2.41
Solution
a. When approaches 1 from the left or the right,
is a small positive number.
Thus, the quotient 
is a large positive number, and 
approaches infinity
from each side of 
So, you can conclude that
Limit from each side is infinity.
Figure 2.41(a) confirms this analysis.
b. When 
approaches 1 from the left,
is a small negative number. Thus, the 
quotient 
is a large positive number, and 
approaches infinity from
the left of 
So, you can conclude that 
Limit from the left side is infinity.
When 
approaches 1 from the right,
is a small positive number. Thus, the
quotient 
is a large negative number, and 
approaches negative 
infinity from the right of 
So, you can conclude that 
Limit from the right side is negative infinity.
Figure 2.41(b) confirms this analysis.

Remember that you can use a numerical approach to analyze 
a limit. For instance, you can use a graphing utility to create a table of values to 
analyze the limit in Example 1(a), as shown in Figure 2.42.

Exploration
Use a graphing utility to
graph each function. For
each function, analytically
find the single real number 
that is not in the domain.
Then graphically find the

Vertical Asymptotes
If it were possible to extend the graphs in Figure 2.41 toward positive and negative
infinity, you would see that each graph becomes arbitrarily close to the vertical line
This line is a vertical asymptote of the graph of 
(You will study other types
of asymptotes in Sections 4.5 and 4.6.)
In Example 1, note that each of the functions is a quotient and that the vertical
asymptote occurs at a number at which the denominator is 0 (and the numerator is not
0). The next theorem generalizes this observation.
Finding Vertical Asymptotes
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
a. When 
the denominator of

b. By factoring the denominator as
you can see that the denominator is 0 at 
and 
Also, because the
numerator is not 0 at these two points, you can apply Theorem 2.14 to conclude that
the graph of has two vertical asymptotes, as shown in Figure 2.43(b).
c. By writing the cotangent function in the form
you can apply Theorem 2.14 to conclude that vertical asymptotes occur at all values
of such that 
and 
as shown in Figure 2.43(c). So, the graph of
this function has infinitely many vertical asymptotes. These asymptotes occur at
where  is an integer.

The Derivative and the Tangent Line Problem
Find the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point.
Use the limit definition to find the derivative of a function.
Understand the relationship between differentiability and continuity.
The Tangent Line Problem
Calculus grew out of four major problems that European mathematicians were working
on during the seventeenth century.
1. The tangent line problem (Section 2.1 and this section)
2. The velocity and acceleration problem (Sections 3.2 and 3.3)
3. The minimum and maximum problem (Section 4.1)
4. The area problem (Sections 2.1 and 5.2)
Each problem involves the notion of a limit, and calculus can be introduced with any of
the four problems.
A brief introduction to the tangent line problem is given in Section 2.1. Although
partial solutions to this problem were given by Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665),
René Descartes (1596–1650), Christian Huygens (1629–1695), and Isaac Barrow
(1630–1677), credit for the first general solution is usually given to Isaac Newton
(1642–1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). Newton’s work on this problem
stemmed from his interest in optics and light refraction.
What does it mean to say that a line is 
tangent to a curve at a point? For a circle, the
tangent line at a point 
is the line that is 
perpendicular to the radial line at point 
as
shown in Figure 3.1.
For a general curve, however, the problem 
is more difficult. For instance, how would you
define the tangent lines shown in Figure 3.2?
You might say that a line is tangent to a curve 
at a point 
when it touches, but does not cross,
the curve at point 
This definition would work
for the first curve shown in Figure 3.2, but not
for the second. Or you might say that a line is 
tangent to a curve when the line touches or
intersects the curve at exactly one point. This
definition would work for a circle, but not for
more general curves, as the third curve in 
Figure 3.2 shows.

Essentially, the problem of finding the tangent line at a point 
boils down to the
problem of finding the slope of the tangent line at point 
You can approximate this
slope using a secant line* through the point of tangency and a second point on the
curve, as shown in Figure 3.3. If 
is the point of tangency and
is a second point on the graph of 
then the slope of the secant line through the two
points is given by substitution into the slope formula
Slope of secant line
The right-hand side of this equation is a difference quotient. The denominator 
is
the change in
and the numerator
is the change in
The beauty of this procedure is that you can obtain more and more accurate
approximations of the slope of the tangent line by choosing points closer and closer to
the point of tangency, as shown in Figure 3.4.

The slope of the tangent line to the graph of at the point

THE TANGENT LINE PROBLEM
In 1637, mathematician René
Descartes stated this about the
tangent line problem:
“And I dare say that this is not 
only the most useful and general
problem in geometry that I know,
but even that I ever desire to know.”

The Slope of the Graph of a Linear Function
To find the slope of the graph of 
when 
you can apply the 
definition of the slope of a tangent line, as shown.
The slope of at 
is 
as shown in Figure 3.5. Notice that the limit
definition of the slope of agrees with the definition of the slope of a line as discussed
in Section 1.2.
The graph of a linear function has the same slope at any point. This is not true of
nonlinear functions, as shown in the next example.
Tangent Lines to the Graph of a Nonlinear Function
Find the slopes of the tangent lines to the graph of 
at the points 
and 
as shown in Figure 3.6.
Solution
Let 
represent an arbitrary point on the graph of 
Then the slope
of the tangent line at 
can be found as shown below. [Note in the limit process
that is held constant (as 
approaches 0).]
So, the slope at any point 
on the graph of is 
At the point 
the
slope is 
and at 
the slope is 
The definition of a tangent line to a curve does not cover the possibility of a 
vertical tangent line. For vertical tangent lines, you can use the following definition. If
is continuous at and
or
then the vertical line 
passing through 
is a vertical tangent line to the
graph of 
For example, the function shown in Figure 3.7 has a vertical tangent line at
When the domain of 
is the closed interval 
you can extend the 
definition of a vertical tangent line to include the endpoints by considering continuity
and limits from the right

The Derivative of a Function
You have now arrived at a crucial point in the study of calculus. The limit used to define
the slope of a tangent line is also used to define one of the two fundamental operations
of calculus—differentiation.
Be sure you see that the derivative of a function of 
is also a function of 
This
“new” function gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of at the point 
provided that the graph has a tangent line at this point. The derivative can also be used
to determine the instantaneous rate of change (or simply the rate of change) of one
variable with respect to another.
The process of finding the derivative of a function is called differentiation. A 
function is differentiable at when its derivative exists at and is differentiable on an
open interval
when it is differentiable at every point in the interval.
In addition to 
other notations are used to denote the derivative of 
The most common are
Notation for derivatives
The notation 
is read as “the derivative of 
with respect to
” or simply “
.” Using limit notation, you can write

Differentiability and Continuity
The alternative limit form of the derivative shown below is useful in investigating the
relationship between differentiability and continuity. The derivative of at is
Alternative form of derivative
provided this limit exists (see Figure 3.10).
As approaches 
the secant line 
approaches the tangent line.
Figure 3.10
Note that the existence of the limit in this alternative form requires that the one-sided
limits
and
exist and are equal. These one-sided limits are called the derivatives from the left and
from the right, respectively. It follows that is differentiable on the closed interval
when it is differentiable on 
and when the derivative from the right at and
the derivative from the left at both exist.
When a function is not continuous at 
it is also not differentiable at 
For instance, the greatest integer function
is not continuous at 
and so it is not differentiable at 
(see Figure 3.11 and
Exercise 91). You can verify this by observing that
Derivative from the left
and
Derivative from the right
Although it is true that differentiability implies continuity (as shown in Theorem 3.1 on
the next page), the converse is not true. That is, it is possible for a function to be 
continuous at 
and not differentiable at 
Examples 6 and 7 illustrate this
possibility.

A Graph with a Sharp Turn
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
The function 
shown in Figure 3.12, is continuous at 
The one-sided
limits, however,
Derivative from the left
and
Derivative from the right
are not equal. So,

and the graph of does not have a

A Graph with a Vertical Tangent Line
The function 
is continuous at 
as shown in Figure 3.13. However,
because the limit
is infinite, you can conclude that the tangent line is vertical at 
So,
is not 
differentiable at 
From Examples 6 and 7, you can see that a function is not differentiable at a point
at which its graph has a sharp turn or a vertical tangent line.
Proof
You can prove that is continuous at 
by showing that 
approaches
as 
To do this, use the differentiability of 
at 
and consider the 
following limit.
Because the difference 
approaches zero as 
you can conclude that
So,

See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The relationship between continuity and differentiability is summarized below.
1. If a function is differentiable at 
then it is continuous at 
So, differentiability
implies continuity.
2. It is possible for a function to be continuous at 
and not be differentiable at
So, continuity does not imply differentiability (see Example 6).

The Power Rule
Before proving the next rule, it is important to review the procedure for expanding a
binomial.
The general binomial expansion for a positive integer is
is a factor of these terms.
This binomial expansion is used in proving a special case of the Power Rule.
Proof
If is a positive integer greater than 1, then the binomial expansion produces
This proves the case for which is a positive integer greater than 1. It is left to you to prove
the case for 
Example 7 in Section 3.3 proves the case for which 
is a negative
integer. The cases for which 
is rational and 
is irrational are left as an exercise (see
Section 3.5, Exercise 90). See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
When using the Power Rule, the case for which 
is best thought of as a
separate differentiation rule. That is,

This rule is consistent with the fact that the slope of the line 
is 1, as shown in

Derivatives of the Sine and Cosine Functions
In Section 2.3, you studied the limits
and
These two limits can be used to prove differentiation rules for the sine and cosine 
functions. (The derivatives of the other four trigonometric functions are discussed in
Section 3.3.)
Proof
Here is a proof of the first rule. (The proof of the second rule is left as an 
exercise [see Exercise 120].)
Definition of derivative
This differentiation rule is shown graphically in Figure 3.18. Note that for each 
the
slope of the sine curve is equal to the value of the cosine.

Derivatives of Exponential Functions
One of the most intriguing (and useful) characteristics of the natural exponential 
function is that it is its own derivative. Consider the following argument.
Let 
The definition of 
tells you that for small values of 
you have 
which implies that
Replacing 
by this approximation produces the following.
This result is stated in the next theorem.
You can interpret Theorem 3.7 graphically by saying that the slope of the graph of
at any point 
is equal to the -coordinate of the point, as shown in

Basic Differentiation Rules and Rates of Change
133
Rates of Change
You have seen how the derivative is used to determine slope. The derivative can also 
be used to determine the rate of change of one variable with respect to another.
Applications involving rates of change, sometimes referred to as instantaneous rates of
change, occur in a wide variety of fields. A few examples are population growth rates,
production rates, water flow rates, velocity, and acceleration.
A common use for rate of change is to describe the motion of an object moving in
a straight line. In such problems, it is customary to use either a horizontal or a vertical
line with a designated origin to represent the line of motion. On such lines, movement
to the right (or upward) is considered to be in the positive direction, and movement to
the left (or downward) is considered to be in the negative direction.
The function 
that gives the position (relative to the origin) of an object as a
function of time is called a position function. If, over a period of time 
the object
changes its position by the amount
then, by the familiar formula
the average velocity is
Average velocity
Finding Average Velocity of a Falling Object
A billiard ball is dropped from a height of 100 feet. The ball’s height at time is the
position function
Position function
where is measured in feet and is measured in seconds. Find the average velocity over
each of the following time intervals.
a.
b.
c.
Solution
a. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 
feet to a height of 
feet. The average velocity is
feet per second.
b. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 84 feet to a height of
feet. The average velocity is
feet per second.
c. For the interval 
the object falls from a height of 84 feet to a height of
feet. The average velocity is
feet per second.
Note that the average velocities are negative, indicating that the object is moving 
downward.

Chapter 3
Differentiation
Suppose that in Example 10, you wanted to find the instantaneous velocity (or
simply the velocity) of the object when 
Just as you can approximate the slope of
the tangent line by calculating the slope of the secant line, you can approximate the
velocity at 
by calculating the average velocity over a small interval 
(see Figure 3.21). By taking the limit as 
approaches zero, you obtain the velocity
when 
Try doing this—you will find that the velocity when 
is 
feet per
second.
In general, if 
is the position function for an object moving along a straight
line, then the velocity of the object at time is
Velocity function
In other words, the velocity function is the derivative of the position function. Velocity
can be negative, zero, or positive. The speed of an object is the absolute value of its
velocity. Speed cannot be negative.
The position of a free-falling object (neglecting air resistance) under the influence
of gravity can be represented by the equation
Position function
where 
is the initial height of the object,
is the initial velocity of the object, and 
is the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, the value of 
is approximately 
feet
per second per second or 
meters per second per second.
Using the Derivative to Find Velocity
At time 
a diver jumps from a platform diving board that is 32 feet above the
water (see Figure 3.22). Because the initial velocity of the diver is 16 feet per second,
the position of the diver is
Position function
where is measured in feet and is measured in seconds.
a. When does the diver hit the water?
b. What is the diver’s velocity at impact?
Solution
a. To find the time when the diver hits the water, let 
and solve for .
Set position function equal to 0.
Factor.
Solve for 
Because 
choose the positive value to conclude that the diver hits the water at
seconds.
b. The velocity at time is given by the derivative 
Velocity function
So, the velocity at time 
is
feet per second.

Product and Quotient Rules and Higher-Order Derivatives
Find the derivative of a function using the Product Rule.
Find the derivative of a function using the Quotient Rule.
Find the derivative of a trigonometric function.
Find a higher-order derivative of a function.
The Product Rule
In Section 3.2, you learned that the derivative of the sum of two functions is simply the
sum of their derivatives. The rules for the derivatives of the product and quotient of two
functions are not as simple.
Proof
Some mathematical proofs, such as the proof of the Sum Rule, are 
straightforward. Others involve clever steps that may appear unmotivated to a reader.
This proof involves such a step—subtracting and adding the same quantity—which is
shown in color.
Note that 
because is given to be differentiable and therefore
is continuous.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The Product Rule can be extended to cover products involving more than two
factors. For example, if 
and are differentiable functions of 
then

Chapter 3
Differentiation
Note the use of parentheses in Example 4. A liberal use of parentheses is 
recommended for all types of differentiation problems. For instance, with the Quotient
Rule, it is a good idea to enclose all factors and derivatives in parentheses, and to pay
special attention to the subtraction required in the numerator. 
When differentiation rules were introduced in the preceding section, the need for
rewriting before differentiating was emphasized. The next example illustrates this point
with the Quotient Rule.
Rewriting Before Differentiating
Find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of 
at 
Solution
Begin by rewriting the function.
Write original function.
Multiply numerator and denominator by 
Rewrite.
Next, apply the Quotient Rule.

To find the slope at 
evaluate 
Slope of graph at 
Then, using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, you can determine that the
equation of the tangent line at 
is 
See Figure 3.23.
Not every quotient needs to be differentiated by the Quotient Rule. For instance,
each quotient in the next example can be considered as the product of a constant times
a function of 
In such cases, it is more convenient to use the Constant Multiple Rule.

Product and Quotient Rules and Higher-Order Derivatives

In Section 3.2, the Power Rule was proved only for the case in which the 
exponent 
is a positive integer greater than 1. The next example extends the proof to
include negative integer exponents.
Power Rule: Negative Integer Exponents
If is a negative integer, then there exists a positive integer such that

is irrational are left as

to find the derivatives of the four remaining trigonometric functions.

and applying the Quotient Rule, you

Product and Quotient Rules and Higher-Order Derivatives

Higher-Order Derivatives
Just as you can obtain a velocity function by differentiating a position function, you 
can obtain an acceleration function by differentiating a velocity function. Another way
of looking at this is that you can obtain an acceleration function by differentiating a
position function twice.
Position function
Velocity function
Acceleration function
The function 
is the second derivative of 
and is denoted by 
The second derivative is an example of a higher-order derivative. You can define
derivatives of any positive integer order. For instance, the third derivative is the derivative
of the second derivative. Higher-order derivatives are denoted as shown below.
First derivative:
Second derivative:
Third derivative:

Finding the Acceleration Due to Gravity
Because the moon has no atmosphere, a falling
object on the moon encounters no air resistance. 
In 1971, astronaut David Scott demonstrated that 
a feather and a hammer fall at the same rate on 
the moon. The position function for each of these
falling objects is 
where 
is the height in meters and is the 
time in seconds, as shown in the figure at the 
right. What is the ratio of Earth’s gravitational
force to the moon’s?
Solution
To find the acceleration, differentiate the position function twice.
Position function
Velocity function
Acceleration function
So, the acceleration due to gravity on the moon is 
meters per second per second.
Because the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 
meters per second per second,
the ratio of Earth’s gravitational force to the moon’s is 
  6.0.

The moon’s mass is 
kilograms, and Earth’s mass is
kilograms.The moon’s
radius is 1737 kilometers, and
Earth’s radius is 6378 kilometers.
Because the gravitational force
on the surface of a planet is
directly proportional to its mass
and inversely proportional to the
square of its radius, the ratio of
the gravitational force on Earth 
to the gravitational force on the
moon is

The Chain Rule
This text has yet to discuss one of the most powerful differentiation rules—the Chain
Rule. This rule deals with composite functions and adds a surprising versatility to the
rules discussed in the two previous sections. For example, compare the functions shown
below. Those on the left can be differentiated without the Chain Rule, and those on the
right are best differentiated with the Chain Rule.
Without the Chain Rule

Basically, the Chain Rule states that if changes

then changes

The Derivative of a Composite Function
A set of gears is constructed so that the second and third gears are on the same axle (see
Figure 3.24). As the first axle revolves, it drives the second axle, which in turn drives
the third axle. Let 
and 
represent the numbers of revolutions per minute of the
first, second, and third axles, respectively. Find 
and 
and show that
Solution
Because the circumference of the second gear is three times that of the
first, the first axle must make three revolutions to turn the second axle once. Similarly,
the second axle must make two revolutions to turn the third axle once, and you can write
and
Combining these two results, you know that the first axle must make six revolutions to
turn the third axle once. So, you can write
.
In other words, the rate of change of 
with respect to 
is the product of the rate of
change of with respect to and the rate of change of with respect to x.

The Chain Rule

Example 1 illustrates a simple case of the Chain Rule. The general rule is stated in
the next theorem.
Proof
Let 
Then, using the alternative form of the derivative, you need
to show that, for 
An important consideration in this proof is the behavior of

approaches 
A problem occurs when there are values of 
other than 
such that
Appendix A shows how to use the differentiability of and to overcome this problem.
For now, assume that 
for values of 
other than 
In the proofs of the
Product Rule and the Quotient Rule, the same quantity was added and subtracted to
obtain the desired form. This proof uses a similar technique—multiplying and dividing by
the same (nonzero) quantity. Note that because 
is differentiable, it is also continuous,
and it follows that 
approaches 
as approaches 
Alternative form of derivative
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
When applying the Chain Rule, it is helpful to think of the composite function 
as having two parts—an inner part and an outer part.
Outer function
Inner function
The derivative of 
is the derivative of the outer function (at the inner function )
times the derivative of the inner function.

The Derivative of the Natural Logarithmic Function
Up to this point in the text, derivatives of algebraic functions have been algebraic and
derivatives of transcendental functions have been transcendental. The next theorem
looks at an unusual situation in which the derivative of a transcendental function is 
algebraic. Specifically, the derivative of the natural logarithmic function is the algebraic
function 
Proof
To prove the first part, let 
which implies that 
Differentiating
both sides of this equation produces the following.
Chain Rule
The second part of the theorem can be obtained by applying the Chain Rule to the first
part.

John Napier used logarithmic properties to simplify calculations involving
products, quotients, and powers. Of course, given the availability of calculators, there
is now little need for this particular application of logarithms. However, there is great
value in using logarithmic properties to simplify differentiation involving products,
quotients, and powers.

JOHN NAPIER (1550–1617)
Logarithms were invented by the
Scottish mathematician John
Napier. Although he did not 
introduce the natural logarithmic
function, it is sometimes called 
the Napierian logarithm. See
LarsonCalculus.com to read more
of this biography.
REMARK
In Examples 14
and 15, be sure that you see the
benefit of applying logarithmic
properties before differentiation.
Consider, for instance, the 
difficulty of direct differentiation
of the function given in
Example 15.

Bases Other than 
The base of the natural exponential function is 
This “natural” base can be used to
assign a meaning to a general base 
Logarithmic functions to bases other than can be defined in much the same way
as exponential functions to other bases are defined.
To differentiate exponential and logarithmic functions to other bases, you have two
options: (1) use the definitions of 
and 
and differentiate using the rules for the
natural exponential and logarithmic functions, or (2) use the differentiation rules for
bases other than given in the next theorem.
Proof
By definition,
Therefore, you can prove the first rule by letting
and differentiating with base to obtain
To prove the third rule, you can write
The second and fourth rules are simply the Chain Rule versions of the first and third
rules.

This section concludes with a summary of the differentiation rules studied so far.
To become skilled at differentiation, you should memorize each rule in words, not 
symbols. As an aid to memorization, note that the cofunctions (cosine, cotangent, and
cosecant) require a negative sign as part of their derivatives.

Implicit Differentiation
Distinguish between functions written in implicit form and explicit form.
Use implicit differentiation to find the derivative of a function.
Find derivatives of functions using logarithmic differentiation.
Implicit and Explicit Functions
Up to this point in the text, most functions have been expressed in explicit form. For
example, in the equation 
the variable is explicitly written as a function
of 
Some functions, however, are only implied by an equation. For instance, the 
function 
is defined implicitly by the equation
Implicit form
To find 
for this equation, you can write 
explicitly as a function of 
and then
differentiate.
Implicit Form

Derivative
This strategy works whenever you can solve for the function explicitly. You cannot,
however, use this procedure when you are unable to solve for as a function of 
For
instance, how would you find 
for the equation
For this equation, it is difficult to express as a function of explicitly. To find 
you can use implicit differentiation.
To understand how to find 
implicitly, you must realize that the differentiation
is taking place with respect to 
This means that when you differentiate terms involving
alone, you can differentiate as usual. However, when you differentiate terms involving
you must apply the Chain Rule, because you are assuming that is defined implicitly
as a differentiable function of

It is meaningless to solve for 
in an equation that has no solution points. (For
example,
has no solution points.) If, however, a segment of a graph can
be represented by a differentiable function, then 
will have meaning as the slope
at each point on the segment. Recall that a function is not differentiable at (a) points
with vertical tangents and (b) points at which the function is not continuous.
Graphs and Differentiable Functions
If possible, represent as a differentiable function of 
a.
b.
c.
Solution
a. The graph of this equation is a single point. So, it does not define as a differentiable
function of

b. The graph of this equation is the unit circle centered at 
The upper semicircle
is given by the differentiable function
and the lower semicircle is given by the differentiable function

the slope of the graph is undefined. See Figure

c. The upper half of this parabola is given by the differentiable function
and the lower half of this parabola is given by the differentiable function
At the point 
the slope of the graph is undefined. See Figure 3.27(c).

The kappa curve
Figure 3.31
ISAAC BARROW (1630–1677)
The graph in Figure 3.31 is called
the kappa curve because it 
resembles the Greek letter kappa,
The general solution for the
tangent line to this curve was 
discovered by the English 
mathematician Isaac Barrow.
Newton was Barrow’s student,
and they corresponded frequently 
regarding their work in the 
early development of calculus.

In Example 1, note that at the point 
the slope of the graph of is 4 and at the
point 
the slope of the graph of

(which follows from Theorem 3.17) is sometimes written as

When determining the derivative of an inverse function, you have two options:
(1) you can apply Theorem 3.17, or (2) you can use implicit differentiation. The first
approach is illustrated in Example 3, and the second in the proof of Theorem 3.18.

tangent function. To find the derivative of

Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
In Section 3.4, you saw that the derivative of the transcendental function 
is
the algebraic function 
You will now see that the derivatives of the inverse
trigonometric functions also are algebraic (even though the inverse trigonometric 
functions are themselves transcendental).
The next theorem lists the derivatives of the six inverse trigonometric functions.
Note that the derivatives of arccos

A Derivative That Can Be Simplified
In the 1600s, Europe was ushered into the scientific age by such great thinkers as
Descartes, Galileo, Huygens, Newton, and Kepler. These men believed that nature is
governed by basic laws—laws that can, for the most part, be written in terms of 
mathematical equations. One of the most influential publications of this period—
Dialogue on the Great World Systems, by Galileo Galilei—has become a classic
description of modern scientific thought.
As mathematics has developed during the past few hundred years, a small number
of elementary functions has proven sufficient for modeling most* phenomena in
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, economics, and a variety of other fields. An
elementary function is a function from the following list or one that can be formed as
the sum, product, quotient, or composition of functions in the list.
Algebraic Functions
Transcendental Functions
Polynomial functions
Logarithmic functions
Rational functions
Exponential functions
Functions involving radicals
Trigonometric functions
Inverse trigonometric functions
With the differentiation rules introduced so far in the text, you can differentiate any 
elementary function. For convenience, these differentiation rules are summarized below.

GALILEO GALILEI (1564–1642)
Galileo’s approach to science
departed from the accepted
Aristotelian view that nature had
describable qualities, such as 
“fluidity” and “potentiality.” He
chose to describe the physical
world in terms of measurable
quantities, such as time, distance,
force, and mass.

Finding Related Rates
You have seen how the Chain Rule can be used to find 
implicitly. Another 
important use of the Chain Rule is to find the rates of change of two or more related
variables that are changing with respect to time.
For example, when water is drained out of a conical tank (see Figure 3.36), the 
volume 
the radius 
and the height 
of the water level are all functions of time 
Knowing that these variables are related by the equation

GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING RELATED-RATE PROBLEMS
1. Identify all given quantities and quantities to be determined. Make a sketch
and label the quantities.
2. Write an equation involving the variables whose rates of change either are
given or are to be determined.
3. Using the Chain Rule, implicitly differentiate both sides of the equation with
respect to time
4. After completing Step 3, substitute into the resulting equation all known
values for the variables and their rates of change. Then solve for the required
rate of change.

Total area increases as the outer radius
increases.

REMARK
When using 
these guidelines, be sure you
perform Step 3 before Step 4.
Substituting the known 
values of the variables before
differentiating will produce an
inappropriate derivative.

An Inflating Balloon
Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon (see Figure 3.38) at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet
per minute. Find the rate of change of the radius when the radius is 2 feet.
Solution
Let 
be the volume of the balloon, and let 
be its radius. Because the 
volume is increasing at a rate of 4.5 cubic feet per minute, you know that at time the
rate of change of the volume is 
So, the problem can be stated as shown.
Given rate:

To find the rate of change of the radius, you must find an equation that relates the radius

Finally, when 
the rate of change of the radius is
foot per minute.
In Example 3, note that the volume is increasing at a constant rate, but the radius is
increasing at a variable rate. Just because two rates are related does not mean that they
are proportional. In this particular case, the radius is growing more and more slowly as
increases. Do you see why?

Newton’s Method
Approximate a zero of a function using Newton’s Method.
Newton’s Method
In this section, you will study a technique for approximating the real zeros of a function.
The technique is called Newton’s Method, and it uses tangent lines to approximate the
graph of the function near its -intercepts.
To see how Newton’s Method works, consider a function that is continuous on the
interval 
and differentiable on the interval 
If 
and 
differ in sign,
then, by the Intermediate Value Theorem,
must have at least one zero in the interval
To estimate this zero, you choose
First estimate
as shown in Figure 3.43(a). Newton’s Method is based on the assumption that the graph
of and the tangent line at 
both cross the -axis at about the same point.
Because you can easily calculate the -intercept for this tangent line, you can use it as
a second (and, usually, better) estimate of the zero of The tangent line passes through
the point 
with a slope of 
In point-slope form, the equation of the 
tangent line is
Letting 
and solving for produces
So, from the initial estimate 
you obtain a new estimate
Second estimate [See Figure 3.43(b).]
You can improve on 
and calculate yet a third estimate
Third estimate
Repeated application of this process is called Newton’s Method.

NEWTON’S METHOD
Isaac Newton first described the
method for approximating the real
zeros of a function in his text
Method of Fluxions. Although the
book was written in 1671, it 
was not published until 1736.
Meanwhile, in 1690, Joseph
Raphson (1648–1715) published 
a paper describing a method for
approximating the real zeros of 
a function that was very similar 
to Newton’s. For this reason, the
method is often referred to as 
the Newton-Raphson method.

Using Newton’s Method
Calculate three iterations of Newton’s Method to approximate a zero of 
Use 
as the initial guess.
Solution
Because 
you have 
and the iterative formula is
The calculations for three iterations are shown in the table.
Of course, in this case you know that the two zeros of the function are 
To six 
decimal places,
So, after only three iterations of Newton’s Method,
you have obtained an approximation that is within 0.000002 of an actual root. The first
iteration of this process is shown in Figure 3.44.
Using Newton’s Method
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Use Newton’s Method to approximate the zero(s) of
Continue the iterations until two successive approximations differ by less than 0.0001.
Solution
Begin by sketching a graph of 
as shown in Figure 3.45. From the graph,
you can observe that the function has only one zero, which occurs near 
Next,
differentiate and form the iterative formula
The calculations are shown in the table.
Because two successive approximations differ by less than the required 0.0001, you
can estimate the zero of to be 0.56714.

Newton’s Method involves division

will fail when the derivative is zero

It can be shown that a condition sufficient to produce convergence of Newton’s
Method to a zero of is that
Condition for convergence
on an open interval containing the zero. For instance, in Example 1, this test would yield
and
Example 1
On the interval 
this quantity is less than 1 and therefore the convergence of
Newton’s Method is guaranteed. On the other hand, in Example 3, you have 
and
Example 3
which is not less than 1 for any value of 
so you cannot conclude that Newton’s
Method will converge.
You have learned several techniques for finding the zeros of functions. The zeros
of some functions, such as
can be found by simple algebraic techniques, such as factoring. The zeros of other 
functions, such as
cannot be found by elementary algebraic methods. This particular function has only one
real zero, and by using more advanced algebraic techniques, you can determine the zero
to be
Because the exact solution is written in terms of square roots and cube roots, it is called
a solution by radicals.
The determination of radical solutions of a polynomial equation is one of the 
fundamental problems of algebra. The earliest such result is the Quadratic Formula,
which dates back at least to Babylonian times. The general formula for the zeros of a
cubic function was developed much later. In the sixteenth century, an Italian 
mathematician, Jerome Cardan, published a method for finding radical solutions to
cubic and quartic equations. Then, for 300 years, the problem of finding a general 
quintic formula remained open. Finally, in the nineteenth century, the problem was
answered independently by two young mathematicians. Niels Henrik Abel, a
Norwegian mathematician, and Evariste Galois, a French mathematician, proved that it
is not possible to solve a general fifth- (or higher-) degree polynomial equation by 
radicals. Of course, you can solve particular fifth-degree equations, such as
but Abel and Galois were able to show that no general radical solution exists.

Extrema of a Function
In calculus, much effort is devoted to determining the behavior of a function on an
interval 
Does have a maximum value on 
Does it have a minimum value? Where
is the function increasing? Where is it decreasing? In this chapter, you will learn how
derivatives can be used to answer these questions. You will also see why these questions
are important in real-life applications.
A function need not have a minimum or a maximum on an interval. For instance,in
Figure 4.1(a) and (b), you can see that the function 
has both a minimum
and a maximum on the closed interval 
but does not have a maximum on the
open interval 
Moreover, in Figure 4.1(c), you can see that continuity (or the lack
of it) can affect the existence of an extremum on the interval. This suggests the theorem
below. (Although the Extreme Value Theorem is intuitively plausible, a proof of this
theorem is not within the scope of this text.)

The minimum and maximum of a function on an interval are the extreme 
values, or extrema (the singular form of extrema is extremum), of the function 
on the interval. The minimum and maximum of a function on an interval are 
also called the absolute minimum and absolute maximum, or the global 
minimum and global maximum, on the interval. Extrema can occur at interior
points or endpoints of an interval (see Figure 4.1). Extrema that occur at the 
endpoints are called endpoint extrema.

Finding Minimum and Maximum Values
The Extreme Value Theorem

of the existence of minimum and maximum values but does not show how to
find these values. Use the minimum and maximum features of a graphing 
utility to find the extrema of each function. In each case, do you think the

Relative Extrema and Critical Numbers
In Figure 4.2, the graph of 
has a relative maximum at the point 
and a relative minimum at the point 
Informally, for a continuous function, you
can think of a relative maximum as occurring on a “hill” on the graph, and a relative
minimum as occurring in a “valley” on the graph. Such a hill and valley can occur in
two ways. When the hill (or valley) is smooth and rounded, the graph has a horizontal
tangent line at the high point (or low point). When the hill (or valley) is sharp and
peaked, the graph represents a function that is not differentiable at the high point (or
low point).
Example 1 examines the derivatives of functions at given relative extrema. (Much
more is said about finding the relative extrema of a function in Section 4.3.)

Definition of Relative Extrema
1. If there is an open interval containing on which 
is a maximum, then 
is called a relative maximum of 
or you can say that has a relative
maximum at 
2. If there is an open interval containing on which 
is a minimum, then 
is called a relative minimum of 
or you can say that has a relative
minimum at 
The plural of relative maximum is relative maxima, and the plural of relative 
minimum is relative minima. Relative maximum and relative minimum are 
sometimes called local maximum and local minimum, respectively.

Note in Example 1 that at each relative extremum, the derivative either is zero or
does not exist. The -values at these special points are called critical numbers. Figure

Because this quotient is positive, the signs of the denominator and numerator must

Right of c:

So, the assumption that

only one possibility—namely,

PIERRE DE FERMAT (1601–1665)
For Fermat, who was trained as 
a lawyer, mathematics was more
of a hobby than a profession.
Nevertheless, Fermat made 
many contributions to analytic
geometry, number theory, calculus,
and probability. In letters to
friends, he wrote of many of the
fundamental ideas of calculus,
long before Newton or Leibniz.
For instance,Theorem 4.2 is
sometimes attributed to Fermat.

Finding Extrema on a Closed Interval
Theorem 4.2 states that the relative extrema of a function can occur only at the critical
numbers of the function. Knowing this, you can use the following guidelines to find
extrema on a closed interval.
The next three examples show how to apply these guidelines. Be sure you see that
finding the critical numbers of the function is only part of the procedure. Evaluating the
function at the critical numbers and the endpoints is the other part.
Finding Extrema on a Closed Interval

Solution
Begin by differentiating the function.
Write original function.
Differentiate.
To find the critical numbers of in the interval 
you must find all -values for

Critical numbers

By evaluating at these two critical numbers and at the endpoints of 
you
can determine that the maximum is 
and the minimum is 
as
shown in the table. The graph of is shown in Figure 4.5.
In Figure 4.5, note that the critical number 
does not yield a relative minimum
or a relative maximum. This tells you that the converse of Theorem 4.2 is not true. In
other words, the critical numbers of a function need not produce relative extrema.

numbers and at the endpoints of the interval, you can conclude that the minimum is

Rolle’s Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem
Understand and use Rolle’s Theorem.
Understand and use the Mean Value Theorem.
Rolle’s Theorem
The Extreme Value Theorem (see Section 4.1) states that a continuous function on a
closed interval 
must have both a minimum and a maximum on the interval. Both
of these values, however, can occur at the endpoints. Rolle’s Theorem, named after the
French mathematician Michel Rolle (1652–1719), gives conditions that guarantee the
existence of an extreme value in the interior of a closed interval.
Proof
Let 
Case 1: If 
for all in 
then is constant on the interval and, by Theorem 3.2,
for all in 
Case 2: Consider 
for some 
in 
By the Extreme Value Theorem, you
know that has a maximum at some in the interval. Moreover, because 
this
maximum does not occur at either endpoint. So,
has a maximum in the open
interval 
This implies that 
is a relative maximum and, by Theorem 4.2,
is a
critical number of 
Finally, because 
is differentiable at 
you can conclude that
Case 3: When 
for some in 
you can use an argument similar to that in
Case 2, but involving the minimum instead of the maximum.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
From Rolle’s Theorem, you can see that if a function is continuous on 
and
differentiable on 
and if 
then there must be at least one -value
between 
and 
at which the graph of has a horizontal tangent [see Figure 4.8(a)].
When the differentiability requirement is dropped from Rolle’s Theorem,
will still
have a critical number in 
but it may not yield a horizontal tangent. Such a case
is shown in Figure 4.8(b).

ROLLE’S THEOREM
French mathematician Michel
Rolle first published the theorem
that bears his name in 1691.
Before this time, however, Rolle
was one of the most vocal critics
of calculus, stating that it gave
erroneous results and was based
on unsound reasoning. Later in
life, Rolle came to see the 
usefulness of calculus.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
A graphing utility can be used to indicate whether
the points on the graphs in Examples 1 and 2 are relative minima or relative maxima
of the functions. When using a graphing utility, however, you should keep in mind
that it can give misleading pictures of graphs. For example, use a graphing utility to
graph
With most viewing windows, it appears that the function has a maximum of 1 when
(see Figure 4.11). By evaluating the function at 
however, you can see
that 
To determine the behavior of this function near 
you need to
examine the graph analytically to get the complete picture.

See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Although the Mean Value Theorem can be used directly in problem solving, it is
used more often to prove other theorems. In fact, some people consider this to be the
most important theorem in calculus—it is closely related to the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus discussed in Section 5.4. For now, you can get an idea of the versatility 
of the Mean Value Theorem by looking at the results stated in Exercises 85–93 in this
section.
The Mean Value Theorem has implications for both basic interpretations of the
derivative. Geometrically, the theorem guarantees the existence of a tangent line that 
is parallel to the secant line through the points
and
as shown in Figure 4.12. Example 3 illustrates this geometric interpretation of the Mean
Value Theorem. In terms of rates of change, the Mean Value Theorem implies that there
must be a point in the open interval 
at which the instantaneous rate of change is
equal to the average rate of change over the interval 
This is illustrated in Example 4.

JOSEPH-LOUIS LAGRANGE
(1736–1813)
The Mean Value Theorem was 
first proved by the famous mathe-
matician Joseph-Louis Lagrange.
Born in Italy, Lagrange held a 
position in the court of Frederick
the Great in Berlin for 20 years.

Finding an Instantaneous Rate of Change
Two stationary patrol cars equipped with radar are 5 miles apart on a highway, as shown
in Figure 4.14. As a truck passes the first patrol car, its speed is clocked at 55 miles per
hour. Four minutes later, when the truck passes the second patrol car, its speed is
clocked at 50 miles per hour. Prove that the truck must have exceeded the speed limit
(of 55 miles per hour) at some time during the 4 minutes.
Solution
Let 
be the time (in hours) when the truck passes the first patrol car.
The time when the truck passes the second patrol car is
By letting 
represent the distance (in miles) traveled by the truck, you have 
and 
So, the average velocity of the truck over the five-mile stretch of
highway is
miles per hour.
Assuming that the position function is differentiable, you can apply the Mean Value
Theorem to conclude that the truck must have been traveling at a rate of 75 miles per
hour sometime during the 4 minutes.
A useful alternative form of the Mean Value Theorem is: If is continuous on 
and differentiable on 
then there exists a number in 
such that

Increasing and Decreasing Functions and the First DerivativeTest
Determine intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing.
Apply the First Derivative Test to find relative extrema of a function.
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
In this section, you will learn how derivatives can be used to classify relative extrema
as either relative minima or relative maxima. First, it is important to define increasing
and decreasing functions.
A function is increasing when, as 
moves to the right, its graph moves up, and 
is decreasing when its graph moves down. 
For example, the function in Figure 4.15 is 
decreasing on the interval 
is constant
on the interval 
and is increasing on the
interval 
As shown in Theorem 4.5
below, a positive derivative implies that the
function is increasing, a negative derivative
implies that the function is decreasing, and 
a zero derivative on an entire interval 
implies that the function is constant on 
that interval.
Proof
To prove the first case, assume that 
for all in the interval 
and
let 
be any two points in the interval. By the Mean Value Theorem, you know
that there exists a number such that 
and
Because 
and 
you know that 
which implies that
So,
is increasing on the interval. The second case has a similar proof
(see Exercise 117), and the third case is a consequence of Exercise 86 in Section 4.2.

Example 1 gives you one instance of how to find intervals on which a function is
increasing or decreasing. The guidelines below summarize the steps followed in that
example.
A function is strictly monotonic on an interval when it is either increasing on the
entire interval or decreasing on the entire interval. For instance, the function 
is strictly monotonic on the entire real number line because it is increasing on the entire
real number line, as shown in Figure 4.17(a). The function shown in Figure 4.17(b) is
not strictly monotonic on the entire real number line because it is constant on the 
interval 0, 1.

2. Determine the sign of

3. Use Theorem 4.5 to determine whether is increasing or decreasing on each
interval.
These guidelines are also valid when the interval

The First Derivative Test
After you have determined the intervals on
which a function is increasing or decreasing,
it is not difficult to locate the relative extrema 
of the function. For instance, in Figure 4.18
(from Example 1), the function
has a relative maximum at the point 
because is increasing immediately to the left 
of 
and decreasing immediately to the
right of 
Similarly,
has a relative 
minimum at the point 
because is
decreasing immediately to the left of 
and increasing immediately to the right of
The next theorem makes this more explicit.
Proof
Assume that 
changes from negative to positive at 
Then there exist and
in such that

and
for all in 
By Theorem 4.5,

and increasing on 
So,

minimum of on the open interval 
and, consequently, a relative minimum of 
This proves the first case of the theorem. The second case can be proved in a similar
way (see Exercise 118).

is the horizontal distance,
is the acceleration due to gravity,
is the initial velocity, and 
is the initial height. (This equation is derived in 
Section 12.3.) Let

Solution
To find the distance the projectile travels, let 
and 
Then substitute these values in the given equation as shown.
Next, solve for

Applications of Differentiation
When a projectile is propelled
from ground level and air 
resistance is neglected, the object
will travel farthest with an initial
angle of 45°. When, however, 
the projectile is propelled from 
a point above ground level, 
the angle that yields a maximum
horizontal distance is not 45°

Concavity and the Second Derivative Test
Determine intervals on which a function is concave upward or concave downward.
Find any points of inflection of the graph of a function.
Apply the Second Derivative Test to find relative extrema of a function.
Concavity
You have already seen that locating the intervals in which a function 
increases or
decreases helps to describe its graph. In this section, you will see how locating the 
intervals in which 
increases or decreases can be used to determine where the graph
of is curving upward or curving downward.
The following graphical interpretation of concavity is useful. (See Appendix A for
a proof of these results.) 
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
1. Let be differentiable on an open interval 
If the graph of is concave upward on
then the graph of lies above all of its tangent lines on 
[See Figure 4.23(a).]
2. Let be differentiable on an open interval 
If the graph of is concave downward
on 
then the graph of lies below all of its tangent lines on 
[See Figure 4.23(b).]
(a) The graph of lies above its tangent lines.
(b) The graph of lies below its tangent lines.
Figure 4.23
To find the open intervals on which the graph of a function is concave upward or
concave downward, you need to find the intervals on which 
is increasing or decreasing.
For instance, the graph of
is concave downward on the open interval 
because
is decreasing there. (See Figure 4.24.) Similarly, the graph of is concave upward on
the interval 
because 
is increasing on 0, .

The next theorem shows how to use the second derivative of a function 
to 
determine intervals on which the graph of is concave upward or concave downward.
A proof of this theorem follows directly from Theorem 4.5 and the definition of 
concavity.
To apply Theorem 4.7, locate the -values at which 
or 
does not exist.
Use these -values to determine test intervals. Finally, test the sign of 
in each of
the test intervals.
Determining Concavity
Determine the open intervals on which the graph of
is concave upward or concave downward.
Solution
Begin by observing that 
is continuous on the entire real number line.
Next, find the second derivative of 
First derivative
Differentiate.
Second derivative
Because 
when 
and 
is defined on the entire real number line, you
should test 
in the intervals 
and 
The results are shown in
the table and in Figure 4.25.
Note that the function in Example 1 is similar to the normal probability density
function, whose general form is
Normal probability density function
where 
is the standard deviation (
is the lowercase Greek letter sigma). This 
“bell-shaped” curve is concave downward on the interval 
The function given in Example 1 is continuous on the entire real number line.
When there are -values at which the function is not continuous, these values should be
used, along with the points at which 
or 
does not exist, to form the test
intervals.

A third case of
Theorem 4.7 could be that if
for all in

concavity is not defined for a

line is neither concave upward
nor concave downward.

Determining Concavity
Determine the open intervals on which the graph of
is concave upward or concave downward.
Solution
Differentiating twice produces the following.
Write original function.
Differentiate.
First derivative
Differentiate.
Second derivative
There are no points at which 
but at 
the function is not continuous.
So, test for concavity in the intervals 
and 
as shown in the
table. The graph of is shown in Figure 4.26.
Points of Inflection
The graph in Figure 4.25 has two points at which the concavity changes. If the 
tangent line to the graph exists at such a point, then that point is a point of inflection.
Three types of points of inflection are shown in Figure 4.27.
This definition of point of inflection requires that the tangent line exists at the point of
inflection. Some texts do not require this. For instance, using this definition, the function
does not have a point of inflection at the origin, even though the concavity of the graph
changes from concave downward to concave upward.

Finding Points of Inflection
Determine the points of inflection and discuss the concavity of the graph of 
Solution
Differentiating twice produces the following.
Write original function.
Find first derivative.
Find second derivative.
Setting 
you can determine that the possible points of inflection occur at
and 
By testing the intervals determined by these -values, you can 
conclude that they both yield points of inflection. A summary of this testing is shown
in the table, and the graph of is shown in Figure 4.28.
The converse of Theorem 4.8 is not generally true. That is, it is possible for the 
second derivative to be 0 at a point that is not a point of inflection. For instance, the
graph of 
is shown in Figure 4.29. The second derivative is 0 when 
but
the point 
is not a point of inflection because the graph of is concave upward in
both intervals 
and 
but 
is not a point of inflection.

The Second Derivative Test
In addition to testing for concavity, the second derivative can be used to perform a 
simple test for relative maxima and minima. The test is based on the fact that if the
graph of a function is concave upward on an open interval containing 
and 
then 
must be a relative minimum of 
Similarly, if the graph of a function is 
concave downward on an open interval containing 
and 
then 
must be a
relative maximum of (see Figure 4.30).
Proof
If 
and 
then there exists an open interval containing for
which

Also, if 
then

So,
changes from negative to positive at 
and the First
Derivative Test implies that

left to you.

Begin by finding the first derivative of 
From this derivative, you can see that

Limits at Infinity
This section discusses the “end behavior” of a function on an infinite interval. Consider
the graph of
as shown in Figure 4.32. Graphically, you can see that the values of 
appear to
approach 3 as increases without bound or decreases without bound. You can come to
the same conclusions numerically, as shown in the table.
The table suggests that the value of 
approaches 3 as 
increases without bound
Similarly,
approaches 3 as decreases without bound 
These
limits at infinity are denoted by
Limit at negative infinity
and
Limit at positive infinity
To say that a statement is true as 
increases without bound means that for some
(large) real number 
the statement is true for all
in the interval 
The next
definition uses this concept.
The definition of a limit at infinity is shown in Figure 4.33. In this figure, note that
for a given positive number 
there exists a positive number 
such that, for 
the graph of will lie between the horizontal lines

Horizontal Asymptotes
In Figure 4.33, the graph of approaches the line 
as increases without bound.
The line 
is called a horizontal asymptote of the graph of 
Note that from this definition, it follows that the graph of a function of can have
at most two horizontal asymptotes—one to the right and one to the left.
Limits at infinity have many of the same properties of limits discussed in

Similar properties hold for limits at

Finding a Limit at Infinity
Find the limit:
Solution
Note that both the numerator and the denominator approach infinity as 
approaches infinity.
This results in 
an indeterminate form. To resolve this problem, you can divide both
the numerator and the denominator by 
After dividing, the limit may be evaluated 
as shown.
Divide numerator and denominator by 
Simplify.
Take limits of numerator and denominator.
Apply Theorem 4.10.
So, the line 
is a horizontal asymptote to the right. By taking the limit as

is also a horizontal asymptote to the left. The graph of the

Solution
In each case, attempting to evaluate the limit produces the indeterminate
form 
a. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 
b. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 
c. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 
You can conclude that the limit does not exist because the numerator increases 
without bound while the denominator approaches 3.
Example 3 suggests the guidelines below for finding limits at infinity of rational
functions. Use these guidelines to check the results in Example 3.
The guidelines for finding limits at infinity of rational functions seem reasonable
when you consider that for large values of 
the highest-power term of the rational
function is the most “influential” in determining the limit. For instance,
is 0 because the denominator overpowers the numerator as 
increases or decreases
without bound, as shown in Figure 4.36.
The function shown in Figure 4.36 is a special case of a type of curve studied by
the Italian mathematician Maria Gaetana Agnesi. The general form of this function is 
Witch of Agnesi
and, through a mistranslation of the Italian word vertéré, the curve has come to be
known as the Witch of Agnesi. Agnesi’s work with this curve first appeared in a
comprehensive text on calculus that was published in 1748.

FUNCTIONS
1. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, then
the limit of the rational function is 0.
2. If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, then
the limit of the rational function is the ratio of the leading coefficients.
3. If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator,
then the limit of the rational function does not exist.

MARIA GAETANA AGNESI
(1718–1799)
Agnesi was one of a handful 
of women to receive credit for 
significant contributions to 
mathematics before the twentieth
century. In her early twenties, she
wrote the first text that included
both differential and integral 
calculus. By age 30, she was an
honorary member of the faculty
at the University of Bologna.

In Figure 4.36, you can see that the function
approaches the same horizontal asymptote to the right and to the left. This is always true
of rational functions. Functions that are not rational, however, may approach different
horizontal asymptotes to the right and to the left. A common example of such a function
is the logistic function shown in the next example.
A Function with Two Horizontal Asymptotes
Show that the logistic function
has different horizontal asymptotes to the left and to the right.
Solution
Begin by sketching a graph of the function. From Figure 4.37, it appears that
and
are horizontal asymptotes to the left and to the right, respectively. The table shows the
same results numerically.
You can obtain the same results analytically, as follows.
is a horizontal asymptote to the right.
For the horizontal asymptote to the left, note that as 
the denominator of
approaches infinity. So, the quotient approaches 0 and thus the limit is 0.You can conclude
that

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
If you use a graphing utility to estimate a limit,
be sure that you also confirm the estimate analytically—the pictures shown by a
graphing utility can be misleading. For instance, Figure 4.38 shows one view of the
graph of
From this view, one could be convinced that the graph has 
as a horizontal
asymptote. An analytical approach shows that the horizontal asymptote is actually
Confirm this by enlarging the viewing window on the graphing utility.

In Section 2.4, Example 7(c), you saw how the Squeeze Theorem can be used to
evaluate a limit involving a trigonometric function. This theorem is also valid for limits
at infinity.

Oxygen Level in a Pond
Let 
measure the level of oxygen in a pond, where 
is the normal (unpolluted)
level and the time is measured in weeks. When 
organic waste is dumped into
the pond, and as the waste material oxidizes, the level of oxygen in the pond is
What percent of the normal level of oxygen exists in the pond after 1 week? After 
2 weeks? After 10 weeks? What is the limit as approaches infinity?
Solution

To find the limit as approaches infinity, you can use the guidelines on page 238, or you
can divide the numerator and the denominator by 
to obtain

Infinite Limits at Infinity
Many functions do not approach a finite limit as increases (or decreases) without bound.
For instance, no polynomial function has a finite limit at infinity. The next definition is
used to describe the behavior of polynomial and other functions at infinity.
Finding Infinite Limits at Infinity
Find each limit.
a.
b.
Solution
a. As increases without bound,
also increases without bound. So, you can write
b. As decreases without bound,
also decreases without bound. So, you can write
The graph of 
in Figure 4.41 illustrates these two results. These results agree
with the Leading Coefficient Test for polynomial functions as described in Section 1.3.
Finding Infinite Limits at Infinity
Find each limit.
a.
b.
Solution
One way to evaluate each of these limits is to use long division to rewrite
the improper rational function as the sum of a polynomial and a rational function.
a.
b.
The statements above can be interpreted as saying that as approaches 
the function
behaves like the function 
In Section 4.6,
you will see that this is graphically described by saying that the line 
is a
slant asymptote of the graph of 
as shown in Figure 4.42.

REMARK
Determining
whether a function has an 
infinite limit at infinity is useful
in analyzing the “end behavior”
of its graph. You will see 
examples of this in Section 4.6
on curve sketching.

A Summary of Curve Sketching
Analyze and sketch the graph of a function.
Analyzing the Graph of a Function
It would be difficult to overstate the importance of using graphs in mathematics.
Descartes’s introduction of analytic geometry contributed significantly to the rapid
advances in calculus that began during the mid-seventeenth century. In the words of
Lagrange, “As long as algebra and geometry traveled separate paths their advance was
slow and their applications limited. But when these two sciences joined company, they
drew from each other fresh vitality and thenceforth marched on at a rapid pace toward
perfection.”
So far, you have studied several concepts that are useful in analyzing the graph of
a function.
•
intercepts and 
intercepts
(Section 1.1)
• Symmetry
(Section 1.1)
• Domain and range
(Section 1.3)
• Continuity
(Section 2.4)
• Vertical asymptotes
(Section 2.5)
• Differentiability
(Section 3.1)
• Relative extrema
(Section 4.1)
• Concavity
(Section 4.4)
• Points of inflection
(Section 4.4)
• Horizontal asymptotes
(Section 4.5)
• Infinite limits at infinity
(Section 4.5)
When you are sketching the graph of a function, either by hand or with a graphing
utility, remember that normally you cannot show the entire graph. The decision as to
which part of the graph you choose to show is often crucial. For instance, which of the
viewing windows in Figure 4.43 better represents the graph of
By seeing both views, it is clear that the second viewing window gives a more complete
representation of the graph. But would a third viewing window reveal other interesting
portions of the graph? To answer this, you need to use calculus to interpret the first and
second derivatives. Here are some guidelines for determining a good viewing window
for the graph of a function.

GUIDELINES FOR ANALYZING THE GRAPH OF A FUNCTION
1. Determine the domain and range of the function.
2. Determine the intercepts, asymptotes, and symmetry of the graph.
3. Locate the 
values for which 
and 
either are zero or do not exist.
Use the results to determine relative extrema and points of inflection.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
Without using the type of analysis outlined in
Example 1, it is easy to obtain an incomplete view of a graph’s basic characteristics.
For instance, Figure 4.45 shows a view of the graph of
From this view, it appears that the graph of is about the same as the graph of shown
in Figure 4.44. The graphs of these two functions, however, differ significantly. Try

Although the graph of the function in Example 2 has no horizontal asymptote, it
does have a slant asymptote. The graph of a rational function (having no common
factors and whose denominator is of degree 1 or greater) has a slant asymptote when
the degree of the numerator exceeds the degree of the denominator by exactly 1. To find
the slant asymptote, use long division to rewrite the rational function as the sum of a
first-degree polynomial and another rational function.
Write original equation.
Rewrite using long division.

The fourth-degree polynomial function in Example 5 has one relative minimum
and no relative maxima. In general, a polynomial function of degree can have at most
relative extrema, and at most
points of inflection. Moreover, polynomial
functions of even degree must have at least one relative extremum.
Remember from the Leading Coefficient Test described in Section 1.3 that the “end
behavior” of the graph of a polynomial function is determined by its leading coefficient
and its degree. For instance, because the polynomial in Example 5 has a positive leading
coefficient, the graph rises to the right. Moreover, because the degree is even, the graph
also rises to the left.

Optimization Problems
Solve applied minimum and maximum problems.
Applied Minimum and Maximum Problems
One of the most common applications of calculus involves the determination of
minimum and maximum values. Consider how frequently you hear or read terms such as
greatest profit, least cost, least time, greatest voltage, optimum size, least size, greatest
strength, and greatest distance. Before outlining a general problem-solving strategy for
such problems, consider the next example.
Finding Maximum Volume
A manufacturer wants to design an open box having a square base and a surface area of
108 square inches, as shown in Figure 4.54. What dimensions will produce a box with
maximum volume?
Solution
Because the box has a square base, its volume is
Primary equation
This equation is called the primary equation because it gives a formula for the 
quantity to be optimized. The surface area of the box is
Secondary equation
Because 
is to be maximized, you want to write 
as a function of just one variable.
To do this, you can solve the equation 
for 
in terms of 
to obtain
Substituting into the primary equation produces
Function of two variables
Substitute for 
Function of one variable
Before finding which 
value will yield a maximum value of 
you should determine
the feasible domain. That is, what values of 
make sense in this problem? You know
that 
You also know that 
must be nonnegative and that the area of the base
is at most 108. So, the feasible domain is
Feasible domain
To maximize 
find the critical numbers of the volume function on the interval
Differentiate with respect to 
Set derivative equal to 0.
Simplify.
Critical numbers
So, the critical numbers are 
You do not need to consider 
because it is
outside the domain. Evaluating 
at the critical number 
and at the endpoints of
the domain produces 
and 
So,
is maximum
when 
and the dimensions of the box are 6 inches by 6 inches by 3 inches.

In Example 1, you should realize that there are infinitely many open boxes having 
108 square inches of surface area. To begin solving the problem, you might ask yourself
which basic shape would seem to yield a maximum volume. Should the box be tall,
squat, or nearly cubical?
You might even try calculating a few volumes, as shown in Figure 4.55, to see if
you can get a better feeling for what the optimum dimensions should be. Remember
that you are not ready to begin solving a problem until you have clearly identified what
the problem is.

GUIDELINES FOR SOLVING APPLIED MINIMUM AND 
MAXIMUM PROBLEMS
1. Identify all given quantities and all quantities to be determined. If possible,
make a sketch.
2. Write a primary equation for the quantity that is to be maximized or 
minimized. (A review of several useful formulas from geometry is presented
inside the back cover.)
3. Reduce the primary equation to one having a single independent variable.
This may involve the use of secondary equations relating the independent
variables of the primary equation.
4. Determine the feasible domain of the primary equation. That is, determine 
the values for which the stated problem makes sense.
5. Determine the desired maximum or minimum value by the calculus 
techniques discussed in Sections 4.1 through 4.4.
REMARK
For Step 5, recall that to determine the maximum or minimum value of
a continuous function on a closed interval, you should compare the values of at its
critical numbers with the values of at the endpoints of the interval.

Newton, Sir Isaac (1643-1727), English mathematician and physicist, who brought the
scientific revolution of the 17th century to its climax and established the principal outlines
of the system of natural science that has since dominated Western thought. In mathematics,
he was the first person to develop the calculus. In optics, he established the heterogeneity
of light and the periodicity of certain phenomena. In mechanics, his three laws of motion
became  the  foundation  of  modern  dynamics,  and  from  them  he  derived  the  law  of
universal gravitation.
Newton was born on January 4, 1643, at W oolsthorpe, near Grantham in Lincolnshire.
When he was three years old, his widowed mother remarried, leaving him to be reared by
her mother. Eventually, his mother, by then widowed a second time, was persuaded to
send him to grammar school in Grantham; then, in the summer of 1661, he was sent to
Trinity College, University of Cambridge.
After receiving his bachelor's degree in 1665, and after an intermission of nearly two
years caused by the plague, Newton stayed on at Trinity, which elected him to a
fellowship in 1667; he took his master's degree in 1668. Meanwhile, he had largely
ignored the established curriculum of the university to pursue his own interests:
mathematics and natural philosophy. Proceeding entirely on his own, Newton investigated
the latest developments in 17th-century mathematics and the new natural philosophy that
treated  nature  as  a  complicated  machine.  Almost  immediately, he  made  fundamental
discoveries that laid the foundation of his career in science.
The Fluxional Method
Newton's first achievement came in mathematics. He generalized the earlier methods
that were being used to draw tangents to curves (similar to differentiation) and to calculate
areas under curves (similar to integration), recognized that the two procedures were inverse
operations, and—joining them in what he called the fluxional method—developed in the
autumn of 1666 what is now known as the calculus. The calculus was a new and powerful
instrument that carried modern mathematics above the level of Greek geometry.Although
Newton was its inventor, he did not introduce it into European mathematics. Always
morbidly fearful of publication and criticism, he kept his discovery to himself, although
enough was known of his abilities to effect his appointment in 1669 as Lucasian Professor
of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. In 1675 the German mathematician
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz arrived independently at virtually the same method, which he
called the differential calculus.  Leibniz proceeded to publish his method, and the world of
mathematics not only learned it from him but also accepted his name for it and his
notation. Newton himself did not publish any detailed exposition of his fluxional method
until 1704.
Optics
Optics was another of Newton's early interests. In trying to explain how phenomena of
colors arise, he arrived at the idea that sunlight is a heterogeneous mixture of different
rays—each of which provokes the sensation of a different color—and that reflections and
refractions cause colors to appear by separating the mixture into its components. He
devised an experimental demonstration of this theory, one of the great early exhibitions of
the power of experimental investigation in science. His measurement of the rings reflected
from  a  thin  film  of  air  confined  between  a  lens  and  a  sheet  of  glass  was  the  first
demonstration of periodicity in optical phenomena. In 1672 Newton sent a brief
exposition of his theory of colors to the Royal Society in London. Its appearance in the
Philosophical  Transactions led  to  a  number  of  criticisms  that  confirmed  his  fear  of
publication, and he subsequently withdrew as much as possible into the solitude of his
Cambridge study. He did not publish his full Opticks until 1704.

Finding Minimum Length
Two posts, one 12 feet high and the other 28 feet high, stand 30 feet apart. They are to
be stayed by two wires, attached to a single stake, running from ground level to the top
of each post. Where should the stake be placed to use the least amount of wire?
Solution
Let 
be the wire length to be
minimized. Using the figure at the right, you
can write
Primary equation
In this problem, rather than solving for in
terms of (or vice versa), you can solve for
both and in terms of a third variable 
as
shown in the figure at the right. From the
Pythagorean Theorem, you obtain
which implies that
So, you can rewrite the primary equation as
Differentiating 
with respect to yields
By letting 
you obtain
Because

and
you can conclude that the wire should be staked at 9 feet from the 12-foot pole.

Applications of Differentiation
In each of the first four examples, the extreme value occurred at a critical number.
Although this happens often, remember that an extreme value can also occur at an 
endpoint of an interval, as shown in Example 5.
An Endpoint Maximum
Four feet of wire is to be used to form a square and a circle. How much of the wire
should be used for the square and how much should be used for the circle to enclose the
maximum total area?
Solution
The total area (see Figure 4.59) is
Primary equation
Because the total length of wire is 4 feet, you obtain
So,
and by substituting into the primary equation you have
The feasible domain is 
restricted by the square’s perimeter. Because
the only critical number in 
is 
So, using
and
you can conclude that the maximum area occurs when 
That is, all the wire is
used for the circle.
Before doing the section exercises, review the primary equations developed in the
first five examples. As applications go, these five examples are fairly simple, and yet the
resulting primary equations are quite complicated.

Example 2
Example 3
Example 4
Example 5
You must expect that real-life applications often involve equations that are at least as
complicated as these five. Remember that one of the main goals of this course is to learn
to use calculus to analyze equations that initially seem formidable.

Maximizing an Angle
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A photographer is taking a picture of a 4-foot painting hung in an art gallery. The camera
lens is 1 foot below the lower edge of the painting, as shown in Figure 4.60. How far should
the camera be from the painting to maximize the angle subtended by the camera lens?
Solution

Finding a Maximum Revenue
The demand function for a product is modeled by
Demand function
where 
is the price per unit (in dollars) and is the number of units. What price will
yield a maximum revenue?
Solution
The revenue function is given by
Revenue function
Substituting for (from the demand function) produces
Primary equation
The rate of change of revenue 
with respect to the number of units sold is called the
marginal revenue and is given by
Setting the marginal revenue equal to zero,
yields 
units. From this, you can conclude that the maximum revenue occurs
when the price is
So, a price of about $20.60 will yield a maximum revenue (see Figure 4.61).

Whenever the Connecticut River reaches a level of 105 feet above
sea level, two Northampton, Massachusetts, flood control station
operators begin a round-the-clock river watch. Every 2 hours, they
check the height of the river, using a scale marked off in tenths of
a foot, and record the data in a log book. In the spring of 1996, the
flood watch lasted from April 4, when the river reached 105 feet
and was rising at 0.2 foot per hour, until April 25, when the level 
subsided again to 105 feet. Between those dates, their log shows
that the river rose and fell several times, at one point coming close
to the 115-foot mark. If the river had reached 115 feet, the city
would have closed down Mount Tom Road (Route 5, south of
Northampton).
The graph below shows the rate of change of the level of the river
during one portion of the flood watch. Use the graph to answer
each question.
(a) On what date was the river rising most rapidly? How do you
know?
(b) On what date was the river falling most rapidly? How do you
know?
(c) There were two dates in a row on which the river rose, then fell,
then rose again during the course of the day. On which days did
this occur, and how do you know?
(d) At 1 minute past midnight,April 14, the river level was 111.0 feet.
Estimate its height 24 hours later and 48 hours later. Explain
how you made your estimates.
(e) The river crested at 114.4 feet. On what date do you think this
occurred?

Tangent Line Approximations
Newton’s Method (Section 3.8) is an example of the use of a tangent line to 
approximate the graph of a function. In this section, you will study other situations in
which the graph of a function can be approximated by a straight line.
To begin, consider a function 
that is differentiable at

tangent line at the point 
is

Error Propagation
Physicists and engineers tend to make liberal use of the approximation of 
by 
One
way this occurs in practice is in the estimation of errors propagated by physical 
measuring devices. For example, if you let represent the measured value of a variable
and let 
represent the exact value, then 
is the error in measurement. Finally,
if the measured value 
is used to compute another value 
then the difference
between 
and 
is the propagated error.

Estimation of Error
The measured radius of a ball bearing is 0.7 inch,
as shown in the figure. The measurement is 
correct to within 0.01 inch. Estimate the 
propagated error in the volume 
of the ball 
bearing.
Solution
The formula for the volume of a
sphere is
where is the radius of the sphere. So, you can write
Measured radius
and
Possible error
To approximate the propagated error in the volume, differentiate 
to obtain
and write
Approximate 
by 
Substitute for and 
So, the volume has a propagated error of about 0.06 cubic inch.
Would you say that the propagated error in Example 3 is large or small? The
answer is best given in relative terms by comparing 
with 
The ratio
Ratio of 
to 
Simplify.
Substitute for 
and 
is called the relative error. The corresponding percent error is approximately 4.29%.

The notation in Example 4 is called the Leibniz notation for derivatives and
differentials, named after the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The
beauty of this notation is that it provides an easy way to remember several important
calculus formulas by making it seem as though the formulas were derived from algebraic
manipulations of differentials. For instance, in Leibniz notation, the Chain Rule
would appear to be true because the 
’s divide out. Even though this reasoning is
incorrect, the notation does help one remember the Chain Rule.

GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ
(1646–1716)
Both Leibniz and Newton are
credited with creating calculus.
It was Leibniz, however, who tried
to broaden calculus by developing
rules and formal notation. He
often spent days choosing an
appropriate notation for a 
new concept.

In fact, if you use a graphing utility to zoom in near the point of tangency 
, you
will see that the two graphs appear to coincide. Notice also that as you move farther
away from the point of tangency, the linear approximation becomes less accurate.

Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integration
281
Using Theorem 5.1, you can represent the entire family of antiderivatives of a 
function by adding a constant to a known antiderivative. For example, knowing that
you can represent the family of all antiderivatives of 
by
Family of all antiderivatives of
where 
is a constant. The constant 
is called the constant of integration. The family
of functions represented by 
is the general antiderivative of and 
is
the general solution of the differential equation
Differential equation

For instance,

Solving a Differential Equation
Find the general solution of the differential equation 
Solution
To begin, you need to find a function whose derivative is 2. One such 
function is
is an antiderivative of 2.
Now, you can use Theorem 5.1 to conclude that the general solution of the differential
equation is
General solution
The graphs of several functions of the form 
are shown in Figure 5.1.
When solving a differential equation of the form
it is convenient to write it in the equivalent differential form
The operation of finding all solutions of this equation is called antidifferentiation (or
indefinite integration) and is denoted by an integral sign 
The general solution is
denoted by
The expression 
is read as the antiderivative of 
with respect to 
So, the
differential 
serves to identify 
as the variable of integration. The term indefinite
integral is a synonym for antiderivative.

REMARK
Before you begin
the exercise set, be sure you
realize that one of the most
important steps in integration 
is rewriting the integrand in 
a form that fits one of the 
basic integration rules.
TECHNOLOGY Some 
software programs, such as
Maple and Mathematica,
are capable of performing 
integration symbolically. If 
you have access to such a 
symbolic integration utility, try
using it to evaluate the indefinite
integrals in Example 7.

Initial Conditions and Particular Solutions
You have already seen that the equation 
has many solutions (each differing
from the others by a constant). This means that the graphs of any two antiderivatives of
are vertical translations of each other. For example, Figure 5.2 shows the graphs of
several antiderivatives of the form
General solution
for various integer values of 
Each of these antiderivatives is a solution of the
differential equation
In many applications of integration, you are given enough information to determine
a particular solution. To do this, you need only know the value of 
for one
value of 
This information is called an initial condition. For example, in Figure 5.2,
only one curve passes through the point 
To find this curve, you can use the 
general solution

and the initial condition

By using the initial condition in the general solution, you can determine that

Chapter 5
Integration
So far in this section, you have been using 
as the variable of integration. In
applications, it is often convenient to use a different variable. For instance, in the next
example, involving time, the variable of integration is 
Solving a Vertical Motion Problem
A ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 64 feet per second from an initial
height of 80 feet.
a. Find the position function giving the height as a function of the time 
b. When does the ball hit the ground?
Solution
a. Let 
represent the initial time. The two given initial conditions can be written
as follows.
Initial height is 80 feet.
Initial velocity is 64 feet per second.
Using 
feet per second per second as the acceleration due to gravity, you can
write
Using the initial velocity, you obtain 
which implies
that 
Next, by integrating 
you obtain
Using the initial height, you obtain
which implies that 
So, the position function is
See Figure 5.4.
b. Using the position function found in part (a), you can find the time at which the ball
hits the ground by solving the equation 
Because 
must be positive, you can conclude that the ball hits the ground 
5 seconds after it was thrown.
In Example 9, note that the position function has the form 
where 
is the initial velocity, and 
is the initial height, as presented in
Section 3.2.
Example 9 shows how to use calculus to analyze vertical motion problems in which
the acceleration is determined by a gravitational force. You can use a similar strategy to
analyze other linear motion problems (vertical or horizontal) in which the acceleration
(or deceleration) is the result of some other force, as you will see in Exercises 61–68.

Sigma Notation
In the preceding section, you studied antidifferentiation. In this section, you will look
further into a problem introduced in Section 2.1—that of finding the area of a region in
the plane. At first glance, these two ideas may seem unrelated, but you will discover in
Section 5.4 that they are closely related by an extremely important theorem called the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
This section begins by introducing a concise notation for sums. This notation is
called sigma notation because it uses the uppercase Greek letter sigma, written as

Now you can evaluate the sum by substituting the appropriate values of

In the table, note that the sum appears to approach a limit as increases. Although
the discussion of limits at infinity in Section 4.5 applies to a variable 
where can be
any real number, many of the same results hold true for limits involving the variable

is restricted to positive integer values. So, to find the limit of

Area
In Euclidean geometry, the simplest type of plane region is a rectangle. Although 
people often say that the formula for the area of a rectangle is
it is actually more proper to say that this is the definition
of the area of a rectangle.
From this definition, you can develop formulas for 
the areas of many other plane regions. For example, to 
determine the area of a triangle, you can form a rectangle 
whose area is twice that of the triangle, as shown in 
Figure 5.5. Once you know how to find the area of a 
triangle, you can determine the area of any polygon by 
subdividing the polygon into triangular regions, as 
shown in Figure 5.6.
Parallelogram
Hexagon
Polygon
Figure 5.6
Finding the areas of regions other than polygons is more difficult. The ancient
Greeks were able to determine formulas for the areas of some general regions
(principally those bounded by conics) by the exhaustion method. The clearest description
of this method was given by Archimedes. Essentially, the method is a limiting process
in which the area is squeezed between two polygons—one inscribed in the region and
one circumscribed about the region.
For instance, in Figure 5.7, the area of a circular region is approximated by an 
-sided inscribed polygon and an -sided circumscribed polygon. For each value of 
the area of the inscribed polygon is less than the area of the circle, and the area of the
circumscribed polygon is greater than the area of the circle. Moreover, as 
increases,
the areas of both polygons become better and better approximations of the area of 
the circle.
The exhaustion method for finding the area of a circular region

A process that is similar to that used by Archimedes to determine the area of a
plane region is used in the remaining examples in this section.

ARCHIMEDES (287–212 B.C.)
Archimedes used the method of
exhaustion to derive formulas for
the areas of ellipses, parabolic 
segments, and sectors of a spiral.
He is considered to have been 
the greatest applied mathematician
of antiquity.

The Area of a Plane Region
Recall from Section 2.1 that the origins of calculus are connected to two classic problems:
the tangent line problem and the area problem. Example 3 begins the investigation of the
area problem.
Approximating the Area of a Plane Region
Use the five rectangles in Figure 5.8(a) and (b) to find two approximations of the area
of the region lying between the graph of
and the -axis between 
and 
Solution
a. The right endpoints of the five intervals are
Right endpoints
where 
The width of each rectangle is 
and the height of each 
rectangle can be obtained by evaluating at the right endpoint of each interval.
Evaluate at the right endpoints of these intervals.
The sum of the areas of the five rectangles is
Height Width
Because each of the five rectangles lies inside the parabolic region, you can conclude
that the area of the parabolic region is greater than 6.48.
b. The left endpoints of the five intervals are
Left endpoints
where 
The width of each rectangle is 
and the height of each 
rectangle can be obtained by evaluating at the left endpoint of each interval. So, the
sum is
Height
Width
Because the parabolic region lies within the union of the five rectangular regions,
you can conclude that the area of the parabolic region is less than 8.08.
By combining the results in parts (a) and (b), you can conclude that
By increasing the number of rectangles used in Example 3, you can obtain closer
and closer approximations of the area of the region. For instance, using 25 rectangles
of width 
each, you can conclude that
7.1712 < Area of region < 7.4912.

Upper and Lower Sums
The procedure used in Example 3 can be generalized as follows. Consider a plane
region bounded above by the graph of a nonnegative, continuous function
as shown in Figure 5.9. The region is bounded below by the -axis, and the left and right
boundaries of the region are the vertical lines 
and 
To approximate the area of the region, begin by subdividing the interval 
into
subintervals, each of width
as shown in Figure 5.10. The endpoints of the intervals are
Because 
is continuous, the Extreme Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a 
minimum and a maximum value of 
in each subinterval.
Minimum value of 
in th subinterval
Maximum value of 
in th subinterval
Next, define an inscribed rectangle lying inside the th subregion and a circumscribed
rectangle extending outside the th subregion. The height of the th inscribed rectangle
is 
and the height of the th circumscribed rectangle is 
For each
the 
area of the inscribed rectangle is less than or equal to the area of the circumscribed 
rectangle.
The sum of the areas of the inscribed rectangles is called a lower sum, and the sum of
the areas of the circumscribed rectangles is called an upper sum.
Area of inscribed rectangles
Area of circumscribed rectangles
From Figure 5.11, you can see that the lower sum 
is less than or equal to the upper
sum 
Moreover, the actual area of the region lies between these two sums.

Example 4 illustrates some important things about lower and upper sums. First,
notice that for any value of 
the lower sum is less than (or equal to) the upper sum.
Second, the difference between these two sums lessens as increases. In fact, when you
take the limits as 
both the lower sum and the upper sum approach 
Lower sum limit
and
Upper sum limit
The next theorem shows that the equivalence of the limits (as 
) of the upper
and lower sums is not mere coincidence. It is true for all functions that are continuous
and nonnegative on the closed interval 
The proof of this theorem is best left to a
course in advanced calculus.
In Theorem 5.3, the same limit is attained for both the minimum value 
and
the maximum value 
So, it follows from the Squeeze Theorem (Theorem 2.8) that
the choice of in the th subinterval does not affect the limit. This means that you are
free to choose an arbitrary -value in the th subinterval, as shown in the definition of
the area of a region in the plane.

A Region Bounded by the -axis

as shown in Figure 5.16.
Solution
When is a continuous, nonnegative function of

same basic procedure shown in Examples 5 and 6. Begin by partitioning the interval
into 
subintervals, each of width

The area of the region is 
In Examples 5, 6, and 7,
is chosen to be a value that is convenient for calculating
the limit. Because each limit gives the exact area for any
there is no need to find 
values that give good approximations when is small. For an approximation, however,
you should try to find a value of 
that gives a good approximation of the area of 
the th subregion. In general, a good value to choose is the midpoint of the interval,
and apply the Midpoint Rule.

the graph of

Riemann Sums
In the definition of area given in Section 5.2, the partitions have subintervals of equal
width. This was done only for computational convenience. The next example shows that
it is not necessary to have subintervals of equal width.
A Partition with Subintervals of Unequal Widths
Consider the region bounded by the graph of
and the 
axis for 
as shown in Figure 5.18. Evaluate the limit
where 
is the right endpoint of the partition given by 
and 
is the width
of the th interval.
Solution
The width of the th interval is
So, the limit is
From Example 7 in Section 5.2, you know that the region shown in Figure 5.19 has
an area of 
Because the square bounded by 
and 
has an area of 1,
you can conclude that the area of the region shown in Figure 5.18 has an area of . This
agrees with the limit found in Example 1, even though that example used a partition
having subintervals of unequal widths. The reason this particular partition gave the
proper area is that as 
increases, the width of the largest subinterval approaches zero.
This is a key feature of the development of definite integrals.

In Section 5.2, the limit of a sum was used to define the area of a region in the
plane. Finding area by this means is only one of many applications involving the limit
of a sum. A similar approach can be used to determine quantities as diverse as arc
lengths, average values, centroids, volumes, work, and surface areas. The next definition
is named after Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann. Although the definite integral had
been defined and used long before Riemann’s time, he generalized the concept to cover
a broader category of functions.
In the definition of a Riemann sum below, note that the function 
has no 
restrictions other than being defined on the interval 
(In Section 5.2, the function 
was assumed to be continuous and nonnegative because you were finding the area 
under a curve.)
The width of the largest subinterval of a partition 
is the norm of the partition and
is denoted by 
If every subinterval is of equal width, then the partition is regular
and the norm is denoted by
Regular partition
For a general partition, the norm is related to the number of subintervals of 
in the
following way.
General partition
So, the number of subintervals in a partition approaches infinity as the norm of the 
partition approaches 0. That is,
implies that 
The converse of this statement is not true. For example, let 
be the partition of
the interval 
given by
As shown in Figure 5.20, for any positive value of 
the norm of the partition 
is 
So, letting 
approach infinity does not force 
to approach 0. In a regular partition,
however, the statements
and
are equivalent.

Definite Integrals
To define the definite integral, consider the limit
To say that this limit exists means there exists a real number such that for each 
there exists a 
such that for every partition with 
it follows that
regardless of the choice of 
in the th subinterval of each partition 
It is not a coincidence that the notation for definite integrals is similar to that used
for indefinite integrals. You will see why in the next section when the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus is introduced. For now, it is important to see that definite integrals
and indefinite integrals are different concepts. A definite integral is a number, whereas
an indefinite integral is a family of functions.
Though Riemann sums were defined for functions with very few restrictions, a 
sufficient condition for a function to be integrable on 
is that it is continuous on
A proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this text.

Evaluating a Definite Integral as a Limit
Evaluate the definite integral 
Solution
The function 
is integrable on the interval 
because it is
continuous on 
Moreover, the definition of integrability implies that any partition
whose norm approaches 0 can be used to determine the limit. For computational 
convenience, define 
by subdividing 
into subintervals of equal width
Choosing 
as the right endpoint of each subinterval produces
So, the definite integral is
Because the definite integral in Example 2 is negative, it does not represent the area
of the region shown in Figure 5.21. Definite integrals can be positive, negative, or zero.
For a definite integral to be interpreted as an area (as defined in Section 5.2), the 
function must be continuous and nonnegative on 
as stated in the next theorem.
The proof of this theorem is straightforward—you simply use the definition of area
given in Section 5.2, because it is a Riemann sum.

and the axis, as shown in Figure 5.23. Because is continuous and nonnegative on the
closed interval 
the area of the region is
A straightforward technique for evaluating a definite integral such as this will be
discussed in Section 5.4. For now, however, you can evaluate a definite integral in two
ways—you can use the limit definition 
you can check to see whether the definite
integral represents the area of a common geometric region, such as a rectangle, triangle,
or semicircle.
Areas of Common Geometric Figures
Sketch the region corresponding to each definite integral. Then evaluate each integral
using a geometric formula.

c.
Solution
A sketch of each region is shown in Figure 5.24.
a. This region is a rectangle of height 4 and width 2.
(Area of rectangle)
b. This region is a trapezoid with an altitude of 3 and parallel bases of lengths 2 and 5.
The formula for the area of a trapezoid is 
(Area of trapezoid)
c. This region is a semicircle of radius 2. The formula for the area of a semicircle is
(Area of semicircle)

The variable of integration in a definite integral is sometimes called a dummy 
variable because it can be replaced by any other variable without changing the value of
the integral. For instance, the definite integrals
and
have the same value.

Properties of Definite Integrals
The definition of the definite integral of on the interval 
specifies that 
Now, however, it is convenient to extend the definition to cover cases in which 
or 
Geometrically, the next two definitions seem reasonable. For instance, it
makes sense to define the area of a region of zero width and finite height to be 0.
Evaluating Definite Integrals
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Evaluate each definite integral.
a.
b.
Solution
a. Because the sine function is defined at 
and the upper and lower limits of 
integration are equal, you can write
b. The integral 
is the same as that given in Example 3(b) except that the
upper and lower limits are interchanged. Because the integral in Example 3(b) has a
value of 
you can write
In Figure 5.25, the larger region can be divided at 
into two subregions whose
intersection is a line segment. Because the line segment has zero area, it follows that the
area of the larger region is equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller regions.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
You have now been introduced to the two major branches of calculus: differential
calculus (introduced with the tangent line problem) and integral calculus (introduced
with the area problem). So far, these two problems might seem unrelated—but there is
a very close connection. The connection was discovered independently by Isaac Newton
and Gottfried Leibniz and is stated in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Informally, the theorem states that differentiation and (definite) integration are
inverse operations, in the same sense that division and multiplication are inverse 
operations. To see how Newton and Leibniz might have anticipated this relationship,
consider the approximations shown in Figure 5.27. The slope of the tangent line was
defined using the quotient
(the slope of the secant line). Similarly, the area of a
region under a curve was defined using the product
(the area of a rectangle). So,
at least in the primitive approximation stage, the operations of differentiation and definite
integration appear to have an inverse relationship in the same sense that division and
multiplication are inverse operations. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that
the limit processes (used to define the derivative and definite integral) preserve this
inverse relationship.

(b) Definite integration
Differentiation and definite integration have an “inverse” relationship.

ANTIDIFFERENTIATION AND DEFINITE INTEGRATION
Throughout this chapter, you have been using the integral sign to denote an antiderivative
(a family of functions) and a definite integral (a number).
Antidifferentiation:
Definite integration:
The use of the same symbol for both operations makes it appear that they are related.
In the early work with calculus, however, it was not known that the two operations were
related.The symbol 
was first applied to the definite integral by Leibniz and was derived
from the letter 
(Leibniz calculated area as an infinite sum, thus, the letter S.

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
In Section 5.2, you saw that the area of a region under a curve is greater than the area of
an inscribed rectangle and less than the area of a circumscribed rectangle. The Mean Value
Theorem for Integrals states that somewhere “between” the inscribed and circumscribed
rectangles, there is a rectangle whose area is precisely equal to the area of the region
under the curve, as shown in Figure 5.30.
Proof
Case 1: If is constant on the interval 
then the theorem is clearly valid because
can be any point in 
Case 2: If is not constant on 
then, by the Extreme Value Theorem, you can
choose 
and 
to be the minimum and maximum values of on 
Because
for all in 
you can apply Theorem 5.8 to write the following.
See Figure 5.31.

Average Value of a Function
The value of 
given in the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is called the average
value of on the interval 
To see why the average value of is defined in this way, partition 
into 
subintervals of equal width
If 
is any point in the th subinterval, then the arithmetic average (or mean) of the 
function values at the ’s is 
Average of 
By multiplying and dividing by 
you can write the average as
Finally, taking the limit as 
produces the average value of on the interval 
as given in the definition above. In Figure 5.32, notice that the area of the region under
the graph of is equal to the area of the rectangle whose height is the average value.
This development of the average value of a function on an interval is only one
of many practical uses of definite integrals to represent summation processes. In
Chapter 7, you will study other applications, such as volume, arc length, centers of
mass, and work.

The Speed of Sound
At different altitudes in Earth’s atmosphere, sound travels at different speeds. The speed
of sound 
(in meters per second) can be modeled by
where 
is the altitude in kilometers (see Figure 5.34). What is the average speed of
sound over the interval 
Speed of sound depends on altitude.

Begin by integrating 
over the interval 
To do this, you can break
the integral into five parts.
By adding the values of the five integrals, you have

The first person to fly at a speed
greater than the speed of sound
was Charles Yeager. On October
14, 1947,  Yeager was clocked at
295.9 meters per second at an
altitude of 12.2 kilometers. If

The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Earlier you saw that the definite integral of on the interval 
was defined using the
constant as the upper limit of integration and as the variable of integration. However,
a slightly different situation may arise in which the variable is used in the upper limit
of integration. To avoid the confusion of using in two different ways,
is temporarily
used as the variable of integration. (Remember that the definite integral is 
a 
function of its variable of integration.)
The Definite Integral as a Number
The Definite Integral as a Function of
The Definite Integral as a Function
Evaluate the function
at 
and 
Solution
You could evaluate five different definite integrals, one for each of the
given upper limits. However, it is much simpler to fix 
(as a constant) temporarily
to obtain
Now, using 
you can obtain the results shown in Figure 5.35.
You can think of the function 
as accumulating the area under the curve
from 
to 
For 
the area is 0 and 
For 
gives the accumulated area under the cosine curve on the entire interval
This interpretation of an integral as an accumulation function is used often
in applications of integration.

Note that the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells you that when a 
function is continuous, you can be sure that it has an antiderivative. This antiderivative
need not, however, be an elementary function. (Recall the discussion of elementary

Net Change Theorem
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Theorem 5.9) states that if is continuous on
the closed interval 
and 
is an antiderivative of on 
then
But because 
this statement can be rewritten as
where the quantity 
represents the net change of F on the interval 
Using the Net Change Theorem
A chemical flows into a storage tank at a rate 
of 
liters per minute, where is the 
time in minutes and  
Find the 
amount of the chemical that flows into the 
tank during the first 20 minutes.
Solution
Let 
be the amount of the 
chemical in the tank at time 
Then 
represents the rate at which the chemical 
flows into the tank at time 
During the 
first 20 minutes, the amount that flows 
into the tank is
So, the amount that flows into the tank during 
the first 20 minutes is 4200 liters.
Another way to illustrate the Net Change Theorem is to examine the velocity of a
particle moving along a straight line, where 
is the position at time 
Then its 
velocity is 
and 
This definite integral represents the net change in position, or displacement, of the 
particle.

Pattern Recognition
In this section, you will study techniques for integrating composite functions. The 
discussion is split into two parts—pattern recognition and change of variables. Both
techniques involve a -substitution. With pattern recognition, you perform the substitution
mentally, and with change of variables, you write the substitution steps.
The role of substitution in integration is comparable to the role of the Chain Rule
in differentiation. Recall that for the differentiable functions
and
the Chain Rule states that
From the definition of an antiderivative, it follows that
These results are summarized in the next theorem.
Examples 1 and 2 show how to apply Theorem 5.13 directly, by recognizing the
presence of

Note that the composite function in the integrand has an
outside function
and an inside function 
Moreover, the derivative 
is present as
a factor of the integrand.

The integrands in Examples 1 and 2 fit the 
pattern exactly—you only
had to recognize the pattern. You can extend this technique considerably with the
Constant Multiple Rule
Many integrands contain the essential part (the variable part) of 
but are missing a
constant multiple. In such cases, you can multiply and divide by the necessary constant
multiple, as shown in Example 3.
Multiplying and Dividing by a Constant

This is similar to the integral given in Example 1, except that the integrand
is missing a factor of 2. Recognizing that

Integrate.
Simplify.
In practice, most people would not write as many steps as are shown in Example 3.
For instance, you could evaluate the integral by simply writing
Be sure you see that the Constant Multiple Rule applies only to constants. You 
cannot multiply and divide by a variable and then move the variable outside the integral
sign. For instance,
After all, if it were legitimate to move variable quantities outside the integral sign, you
could move the entire integrand out and simplify the whole process. But the result
would be incorrect.

Change of Variables
With a formal change of variables, you completely rewrite the integral in terms of 
and 
(or any other convenient variable). Although this procedure can involve more
written steps than the pattern recognition illustrated in Examples 1 to 3, it is useful for
complicated integrands. The change of variables technique uses the Leibniz notation for
the differential. That is, if 
then 
and the integral in Theorem 5.13
takes the form

REMARK
Because 
integration is usually more 
difficult than differentiation,
you should always check your
answer to an integration 
problem by differentiating. 
For instance, in Example 4,
you should differentiate

Because differentiation produces the original integrand, you know that you have obtained
the correct antiderivative.
The steps used for integration by substitution are summarized in the following
guidelines.
So far, you have seen two techniques for applying substitution, and you will 
see more techniques in the remainder of this section. Each technique differs slightly
from the others. You should remember, however, that the goal is the same with each 
technique—you are trying to find an antiderivative of the integrand.

REMARK
When making a
change of variables, be sure that
your answer is written using 
the same variables as in the
original integrand. For instance,
in Example 6, you should not
leave your answer as
but rather, you should replace 
by sin 3x.

The General Power Rule for Integration
One of the most common 
substitutions involves quantities in the integrand that are
raised to a power. Because of the importance of this type of substitution, it is given a
special name—the General Power Rule for Integration. A proof of this rule follows
directly from the (simple) Power Rule for Integration, together with Theorem 5.13.

Some integrals whose integrands involve quantities raised to powers cannot be
found by the General Power Rule. Consider the two integrals
and
The substitution
works in the first integral, but not in the second. In the second, the substitution fails
because the integrand lacks the factor needed for 
Fortunately, for this particular
integral, you can expand the integrand as
and use the (simple) Power Rule to integrate each term.

Change of Variables for Definite Integrals
When using 
substitution with a definite integral, it is often convenient to determine
the limits of integration for the variable rather than to convert the antiderivative back
to the variable 
and evaluate at the original limits. This change of variables is stated
explicitly in the next theorem. The proof follows from Theorem 5.13 combined with
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

Now, substitute to obtain
Geometrically, you can interpret the equation
to mean that the two different regions shown in Figures 5.38 and 5.39 have the 
same area.
When evaluating definite integrals by substitution, it is possible for the upper limit
of integration of the variable form to be smaller than the lower limit. When this happens,
do not rearrange the limits. Simply evaluate as usual. For example, after substituting
in the integral
you obtain 
when

So, the

variable form of this integral is
Expanding the integrand, you can evaluate this integral as shown.

Integration of Even and Odd Functions
Even with a change of variables, integration can be difficult. Occasionally, you can 
simplify the evaluation of a definite integral over an interval that is symmetric about the
axis or about the origin by recognizing the integrand to be an even or odd function
(see Figure 5.40).
Proof
Here is the proof of the first property. (The proof of the second property is left
to you see Exercise 119 ) Because 
is even, you know that 
Using
Theorem 5.13 with the substitution 
produces
Finally, using Theorem 5.6, you obtain
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Integration of an Odd Function
Evaluate the definite integral.
Solution
Letting 
produces
So, is an odd function, and because is symmetric about the origin over 
you can apply Theorem 5.16 to conclude that
From Figure 5.41, you can see that the two regions on either side of the axis have the
same area. However, because one lies below the axis and one lies above it, integration
produces a cancellation effect. (More will be said about areas below the -axis in
Section 7.1.)

Approximate a definite integral using the Trapezoidal Rule.
Approximate a definite integral using Simpson’s Rule.
Analyze the approximate errors in the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson’s Rule.
The Trapezoidal Rule
Some elementary functions simply do not have antiderivatives that are elementary 
functions. For example, there is no elementary function that has any of the following
functions as its derivative.
If you need to evaluate a definite integral involving a function whose antiderivative 
cannot be found, then while the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is still true, it cannot
be easily applied. In this case, it is easier to resort to an approximation technique. Two
such techniques are described in this section.
One way to approximate a definite integral is to use 
trapezoids, as shown in
Figure 5.42. In the development of this method, assume that is continuous and positive
on the interval 
So, the definite integral
represents the area of the region bounded by the graph of 
and the 
axis, from 
to 
First, partition the interval 
into 
subintervals, each of width
such that
Then form a trapezoid for each subinterval (see Figure 5.43). The area of the th
trapezoid is
Area of th trapezoid
This implies that the sum of the areas of the trapezoids is
Letting 
you can take the limit as 
to obtain

Most graphing utilities and computer algebra systems have
built-in programs that can be used to approximate the value of a definite integral. 
Try using such a program to approximate the integral in Example 1. How close is 
your approximation? When you use such a program, you need to be aware of its 
limitations. Often, you are given no indication of the degree of accuracy of the
approximation. Other times, you may be given an approximation that is completely
wrong. For instance, try using a built-in numerical integration program to evaluate

It is interesting to compare the Trapezoidal Rule with the Midpoint Rule given in
Section 5.2. For the Trapezoidal Rule, you average the function values at the endpoints
of the subintervals, but for the Midpoint Rule, you take the function values of the 
subinterval midpoints.
Midpoint Rule
Trapezoidal Rule
There are two important points that should be made concerning the Trapezoidal
Rule (or the Midpoint Rule). First, the approximation tends to become more accurate
as 
increases. For instance, in Example 1, when 
the Trapezoidal Rule yields
an approximation of 1.994. Second, although you could have used the Fundamental
Theorem to evaluate the integral in Example 1, this theorem cannot be used to evaluate
an integral as simple as 
because 
has no elementary antiderivative. Yet,
the Trapezoidal Rule can be applied to estimate this integral.
Simpson’s Rule
One way to view the trapezoidal approximation of a definite integral is to say that on
each subinterval, you approximate by a first-degree polynomial. In Simpson’s Rule,
named after the English mathematician Thomas Simpson (1710–1761), you take this
procedure one step further and approximate by second-degree polynomials.
Before presenting Simpson’s Rule, consider the next theorem for evaluating integrals
of polynomials of degree 2 (or less).

To develop Simpson’s Rule for approximating a definite integral, you again
partition the interval 
into 
subintervals, each of width 
This
time, however,
is required to be even, and the subintervals are grouped in pairs such
that
On each (double) subinterval 
, you can approximate by a polynomial 
of
degree less than or equal to 2. (See Exercise 49.) For example, on the subinterval 
choose the polynomial of least degree passing through the points 
and
as shown in Figure 5.45. Now, using as an approximation of on this subinterval,
you have, by Theorem 5.18,
Repeating this procedure on the entire interval 
produces the next theorem.
In Example 1, the Trapezoidal Rule was used to estimate 
In the next
example, Simpson’s Rule is applied to the same integral.

Error Analysis
When you use an approximation technique, it is important to know how accurate you
can expect the approximation to be. The next theorem, which is listed without proof,
gives the formulas for estimating the errors involved in the use of Simpson’s Rule and
the Trapezoidal Rule. In general, when using an approximation, you can think of the
error 
as the difference between 
and the approximation.
Theorem 5.20 states that the errors generated by the Trapezoidal Rule and
Simpson’s Rule have upper bounds dependent on the extreme values of 
and 
in the interval 
Furthermore, these errors can be made arbitrarily small by 
increasing
provided that 
and 
are continuous and therefore bounded in 
The Approximate Error in the Trapezoidal Rule
Determine a value of such that the Trapezoidal Rule will approximate the value of
with an error that is less than or equal to 0.01.
Solution
Begin by letting 
and finding the second derivative of 
and
The maximum value of 
on the interval 
So, by Theorem 5.20,
you can write
To obtain an error 
that is less than 0.01, you must choose 
such that
So, you can choose 
(because 
must be greater than or equal to 2.89) and apply
the Trapezoidal Rule, as shown in Figure 5.46, to obtain
So, by adding and subtracting the error from this estimate, you know that

Integrals to which the Log Rule can be applied often appear in disguised form. For
instance, when a rational function has a numerator of degree greater than or equal to
that of the denominator, division may reveal a form to which you can apply the Log
Rule. This is shown in Example 5.

As you study the methods shown in Examples 5 and 6, be aware that both methods
involve rewriting a disguised integrand so that it fits one or more of the basic integration
formulas. Throughout the remaining sections of Chapter 5 and in Chapter 8, much time
will be devoted to integration techniques. To master these techniques, you must
recognize the “form-fitting” nature of integration. In this sense, integration is not nearly
as straightforward as differentiation. Differentiation takes the form
“Here is the question; what is the answer?”
Integration is more like
“Here is the answer; what is the question?”
Here are some guidelines you can use for integration.
u-Substitution and the Log Rule
Solve the differential equation 
Solution
The solution can be written as an indefinite integral.
Because the integrand is a quotient whose denominator is raised to the first power, you
should try the Log Rule. There are three basic choices for 
The choices

fail to fit the 
form of the Log Rule. However, the third choice does fit. Letting

GUIDELINES FOR INTEGRATION
1. Learn a basic list of integration formulas. (By the end of Section 5.8, you 
will have 20 basic rules.)
2. Find an integration formula that resembles all or part of the integrand, and,
by trial and error, find a choice of that will make the integrand conform 
to the formula.
3. When you cannot find a -substitution that works, try altering the integrand.
You might try a trigonometric identity, multiplication and division by the
same quantity, addition and subtraction of the same quantity, or long division. 
Be creative.
4. If you have access to computer software that will find antiderivatives
symbolically, use it.

Keep in mind 
that you can check your answer
to an integration problem by 
differentiating the answer. For

Integrals of Trigonometric Functions
In Section 5.1, you looked at six trigonometric integration rules—the six that correspond
directly to differentiation rules. With the Log Rule, you can now complete the set of
basic trigonometric integration formulas.
Using a Trigonometric Identity

Solution
This integral does not seem to fit any formulas on our basic list. However,

Example 8 uses a trigonometric identity to derive an integration rule for the tangent
function. The next example takes a rather unusual step (multiplying and dividing by the
same quantity) to derive an integration rule for the secant function.
Derivation of the Secant Formula

Solution
Consider the following procedure.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions: Integration
Integrate functions whose antiderivatives involve inverse trigonometric functions.
Use the method of completing the square to integrate a function.
Review the basic integration rules involving elementary functions.
Integrals Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The derivatives of the six inverse trigonometric functions fall into three pairs. In each
pair, the derivative of one function is the negative of the other. For example,
and
When listing the antiderivative that corresponds to each of the inverse trigonometric
functions, you need to use only one member from each pair. It is conventional to use
as the antiderivative of 
rather than 
The next theorem
gives one antiderivative formula for each of the three pairs. The proofs of these
integration rules are left to you (see Exercises 75–77).

Integration by Substitution
Find 
Solution
As it stands, this integral doesn’t fit any of the three inverse trigonometric
formulas. Using the substitution 
however, produces
With this substitution, you can integrate as shown.

Rewriting as the Sum of Two Quotients
Find 
Solution
This integral does not appear to fit any of the basic integration formulas.
By splitting the integrand into two parts, however, you can see that the first part can be
found with the Power Rule and the second part yields an inverse sine function.

TECHNOLOGY PITFALL
A symbolic integration utility can be useful for
integrating functions such as the one in Example 2. In some cases, however, the 
utility may fail to find an antiderivative for two reasons. First, some elementary 
functions do not have antiderivatives that are elementary functions. Second, every
utility has limitations—you might have entered a function that the utility was not 
programmed to handle. You should also remember that antiderivatives involving
trigonometric functions or logarithmic functions can be written in many different
forms. For instance, one utility found the integral in Example 2 to be
Try showing that this antiderivative is equivalent to the one found in Example 2.

Completing the Square
Completing the square helps when quadratic functions are involved in the integrand.
For example, the quadratic 
can be written as the difference of two squares
by adding and subtracting

When the leading coefficient is not 1, it helps to factor before completing the
square. For instance, you can complete the square of

Review of Basic Integration Rules
You have now completed the introduction of the basic integration rules. To be efficient
at applying these rules, you should have practiced enough so that each rule is committed
to memory.
You can learn a lot about the nature of integration by comparing this list with the
summary of differentiation rules given in Section 3.6. For differentiation, you now have
rules that allow you to differentiate any elementary function. For integration, this is far
from true.
The integration rules listed above are primarily those that were happened on 
during the development of differentiation rules. So far, you have not learned any rules
or techniques for finding the antiderivative of a general product or quotient, the natural
logarithmic function, or the inverse trigonometric functions. More important, you cannot
apply any of the rules in this list unless you can create the proper 
corresponding to
the in the formula. The point is that you need to work more on integration techniques,
which you will do in Chapter 8. The next two examples should give you a better feeling
for the integration problems that you can and cannot solve with the techniques and rules
you now know.

Hyperbolic Functions
In this section, you will look briefly at a special class of exponential functions called
hyperbolic functions. The name hyperbolic function arose from comparison of the area
of a semicircular region, as shown in Figure 5.50, with the area of a region under a
hyperbola, as shown in Figure 5.51.

The integral for the hyperbolic region involves an inverse hyperbolic function:
This is only one of many ways in which the hyperbolic functions are similar to the
trigonometric functions.

derive rules for their derivatives. The next theorem lists these derivatives with the

of the other differentiation rules in Exercises 103–105.)

Using the result of Example 1(d), set the first derivative of equal to 0.
So, the critical numbers are 
and 
Using the Second Derivative Test, you
can verify that the point 
yields a relative maximum and the point 
yields a relative minimum, as shown in Figure 5.53. Try using a graphing utility to 
confirm this result. If your graphing utility does not have hyperbolic functions, you can
use exponential functions, as shown.
When a uniform flexible cable, such as a telephone wire, is suspended from two
points, it takes the shape of a catenary, as discussed in Example 3.

Power cables are suspended between two towers, forming the catenary shown in 
Figure 5.54. The equation for this catenary is

Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
Unlike trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions are not periodic. In fact, by
looking back at Figure 5.52, you can see that four of the six hyperbolic functions are
actually one-to-one (the hyperbolic sine, tangent, cosecant, and cotangent). So, you can
conclude that these four functions have inverse functions. The other two (the hyperbolic
cosine and secant) are one-to-one when their domains are restricted to the positive real
numbers, and for this restricted domain they also have inverse functions. Because the
hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions, it is not surprising to
find that the inverse hyperbolic functions can be written in terms of logarithmic functions,
as shown in Theorem 5.24.
Proof
The proof of this theorem is a straightforward application of the properties of
the exponential and logarithmic functions. For example, for

The graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions are shown in Figure 5.56.
The inverse hyperbolic secant can be used to define a curve called a tractrix or 
pursuit curve, as discussed in Example 5.
A Tractrix
A person is holding a rope that is tied to a boat, as shown in Figure 5.57. As the 
person walks along the dock, the boat travels along a tractrix, given by the equation
where 
is the length of the rope. For 
feet, find the distance the person must
walk to bring the boat to a position 5 feet from the dock.
Solution
In Figure 5.57, notice that the distance the person has walked is 
When 
this distance is
So, the person must walk about 41.27 feet to bring the boat to a position 5 feet from the
dock.

General and Particular Solutions

and derivatives of 
For example,
Differential equation
is a differential equation. In Section 6.2, you will see that problems involving radioactive
decay, population growth, and Newton’s Law of Cooling can be formulated in terms of
differential equations.
A function 
is called a solution of a differential equation if the equation 
is satisfied when 
and its derivatives are replaced by 
and its derivatives. For 
example, differentiation and substitution would show that 
is a solution of the
differential equation 
It can be shown that every solution of this differential
equation is of the form
General solution of 
where 
is any real number. This solution is called the general solution. Some 
differential equations have singular solutions that cannot be written as special cases of
the general solution. Such solutions, however, are not considered in this text. The order
of a differential equation is determined by the highest-order derivative in the equation.
For instance,
is a first-order differential equation. First-order linear differential
equations are discussed in Section 6.5.
In Section 5.1, Example 9, you saw that the second-order differential equation
has the general solution
General solution of 
which contains two arbitrary constants. It can be shown that a differential equation of
order has a general solution with arbitrary constants.

Geometrically, the general solution of a first-order differential equation represents
a family of curves known as solution curves, one for each value assigned to the 
arbitrary constant. For instance, you can verify that every function of the form
General solution of 
is a solution of the differential equation
Figure 6.1 shows four of the solution curves corresponding to different values of 
As discussed in Section 5.1, particular solutions of a differential equation are
obtained from initial conditions that give the values of the dependent variable or one
of its derivatives for particular values of the independent variable. The term “initial 
condition” stems from the fact that, often in problems involving time, the value of the
dependent variable or one of its derivatives is known at the initial time 
For
instance, the second-order differential equation
having the general solution
General solution of 
might have the following initial conditions.
Initial conditions
In this case, the initial conditions yield the particular solution
Particular solution
Finding a Particular Solution
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
For the differential equation
verify that 
is a solution. Then find the particular solution determined by the 
initial condition 
when 
Solution
You know that 
is a solution because 
and
Furthermore, the initial condition 
when 
yields
General solution
Substitute initial condition.
Solve for 
and you can conclude that the particular solution is 
Particular solution
Try checking this solution by substituting for 
and 
in the original differential
equation.
Note that to determine a particular solution, the number of initial conditions must
match the number of constants in the general solution.

Slope Fields
Solving a differential equation analytically can be difficult or even impossible. However,
there is a graphical approach you can use to learn a lot about the solution of a differential
equation. Consider a differential equation of the form
Differential equation
where 
is some expression in and 
At each point 
in the 
-plane where
is defined, the differential equation determines the slope 
of the solution
at that point. If you draw short line segments with slope 
at selected points 
in the domain of 
then these line segments form a slope field, or a direction field, for
the differential equation 
Each line segment has the same slope as the 
solution curve through that point. A slope field shows the general shape of all 
the solutions and can be helpful in getting a visual perspective of the directions of the
solutions of a differential equation.
Sketching a Slope Field
Sketch a slope field for the differential equation 
for the points 
and 
Solution
The slope of the solution curve at any point 
is
Slope at 
So, the slope at each point can be found as shown.
Slope at 
Slope at 
Slope at 
Draw short line segments at the three points with their respective slopes, as shown in
Figure 6.2.

satisfies this condition is 
So, the graph matches equation (ii).

is 0. The only equation that satisfies
this condition is 
So, the graph matches equation (i).

A solution curve of a differential equation 
is simply a curve in the
-plane whose tangent line at each point 
has slope equal to 
This is
illustrated in Example 5.
Sketching a Solution Using a Slope Field
Sketch a slope field for the differential equation
Use the slope field to sketch the solution that passes through the point 
Solution
Make a table showing the slopes at several points. The table shown is a
small sample. The slopes at many other points should be calculated to get a representative
slope field.
Next, draw line segments at the points with their respective slopes, as shown in
Figure 6.3.

After the slope field is drawn, start at the initial point 
and move to the right in the
direction of the line segment. Continue to draw the solution curve so that it moves 
parallel to the nearby line segments. Do the same to the left of 
The resulting 
solution is shown in Figure 6.4.
In Example 5, note that the slope field shows that 
increases to infinity as 
increases.

TECHNOLOGY
Drawing a slope field by
hand is tedious. In practice, slope fields are 
usually drawn using a graphing utility. If you
have access to a graphing utility that can graph
slope fields, try graphing the slope field for the
differential equation in Example 5. One example
of a slope field drawn by a graphing utility is
shown at the right.

Euler’s Method
Euler’s Method is a numerical approach to approximating the particular solution of the
differential equation
that passes through the point 
From the given information, you know that the
graph of the solution passes through the point 
and has a slope of 
at this
point. This gives you a “starting point” for approximating the solution.
From this starting point, you can proceed in the direction indicated by the slope.
Using a small step 
move along the tangent line until you arrive at the point 
where
and
as shown in Figure 6.5. Then, using 
as a new starting point, you can repeat the
process to obtain a second point 
The values of

are shown below.
When using this method, note that you can obtain better approximations of the exact
solution by choosing smaller and smaller step sizes.
Approximating a Solution Using Euler’s Method

Differential Equations: Growth and Decay
Use separation of variables to solve a simple differential equation.
Use exponential functions to model growth and decay in applied problems.
Differential Equations
In Section 6.1, you learned to analyze the solutions visually of differential equations
using slope fields and to approximate solutions numerically using Euler’s Method.
Analytically, you have learned to solve only two types of differential equations—those
of the forms 
and 
In this section, you will learn how to solve a more
general type of differential equation. The strategy is to rewrite the equation so that each
variable occurs on only one side of the equation. This strategy is called separation of
variables. (You will study this strategy in detail in Section 6.3.)
Solving a Differential Equation
Original equation
Multiply both sides by 
Integrate with respect to 
Apply Power Rule.
Rewrite, letting 
So, the general solution is 
When you integrate both sides of the equation in Example 1, you do not need to add
a constant of integration to both sides. When you do, you still obtain the same result.
Some people prefer to use Leibniz notation and differentials when applying separation
of variables. The solution to Example 1 is shown below using this notation.

Radioactive decay is measured in terms of half-life—the number of years required
for half of the atoms in a sample of radioactive material to decay. The rate of decay 
is proportional to the amount present. The half-lives of some common radioactive 
isotopes are listed below.

Radioactive Decay
Ten grams of the plutonium isotope 
were released in a nuclear accident. How long
will it take for the 10 grams to decay to 1 gram?
Solution
Let represent the mass (in grams) of the plutonium. Because the rate of
decay is proportional to 
you know that
where is the time in years. To find the values of the constants 
and 
apply the 
initial conditions. Using the fact that 
when 
you can write
which implies that 
Next, using the fact that the half-life of 
is 24,100 years,
you have

so you can write
So, the model is

To find the time it would take for 10 grams to decay to 1 gram, you can solve for in

The solution is approximately 80,059 years.

Most graphing utilities have curve-fitting capabilities that can
be used to find models that represent data. Use the exponential regression feature of
a graphing utility and the information in Example 2 to find a model for the data. How
does your model compare with the given model?
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
disaster occurred after an 
earthquake and tsunami. 
Several of the reactors at the
plant experienced full meltdowns.

The exponential
decay model in Example 3
could also be written as
This model is
much easier to derive, but for
some applications it is not as
convenient to use.

Population Growth
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
An experimental population of fruit flies increases according to the law of exponential
growth. There were 100 flies after the second day of the experiment and 300 flies after
the fourth day. Approximately how many flies were in the original population?
Solution
Let 
be the number of flies at time 
where is measured in days.
Note that 
is continuous, whereas the number of flies is discrete. Because 
when 
and 
when 
you can write
and
From the first equation, you know that
Substituting this value into the second equation produces the following.
So, the exponential growth model is
To solve for 
reapply the condition 
when 
and obtain
So, the original population (when 
) consisted of approximately 
flies,
as shown in Figure 6.8.
Declining Sales
Four months after it stops advertising, a manufacturing company notices that its sales
have dropped from 100,000 units per month to 80,000 units per month. The sales 
follow an exponential pattern of decline. What will the sales be after another 2 months?
Solution
Use the exponential decay model 
where is measured in months.
From the initial condition 
you know that 
Moreover, because
when 
you have
So, after 2 more months 
you can expect the monthly sales rate to be
See Figure 6.9.

In Examples 2 through 5, you did not actually have to solve the differential 
equation 
(This was done once in the proof of Theorem 6.1.) The next example 
demonstrates a problem whose solution involves the separation of variables technique.
The example concerns Newton’s Law of Cooling, which states that the rate of change
in the temperature of an object is proportional to the difference between the object’s
temperature and the temperature of the surrounding medium.
Newton’s Law of Cooling
Let represent the temperature 
of an object in a room whose temperature is kept
at a constant 
The object cools from 
to 
in 10 minutes. How much longer
will it take for the temperature of the object to decrease to 
Solution
From Newton’s Law of Cooling, you know that the rate of change in is
proportional to the difference between and 60. This can be written as

37. Radioactive Decay
Radioactive radium has a half-life of
approximately 1599 years. What percent of a given amount
remains after 100 years?
38. Carbon Dating
Carbon-14 dating assumes that the carbon
dioxide on Earth today has the same radioactive content as it
did centuries ago. If this is true, the amount of 
absorbed by
a tree that grew several centuries ago should be the same as the
amount of 
absorbed by a tree growing today. A piece of
ancient charcoal contains only 15% as much of the radioactive
carbon as a piece of modern charcoal. How long ago was the
tree burned to make the ancient charcoal? (The half-life of 
is 5715 years.)

Differential Equations: Separation of Variables
Recognize and solve differential equations that can be solved by separation 
of variables.

Separation of Variables

As you saw in Section 6.2, for this type of equation, all terms can be collected with
and all 
terms with 
and a solution can be obtained by integration. Such 
equations are said to be separable, and the solution procedure is called separation of
variables. Below are some examples of differential equations that are separable.

A common problem in electrostatics,
thermodynamics, and hydrodynamics involves
finding a family of curves, each of which is
orthogonal to all members of a given family of
curves. For example, Figure 6.13 shows a family
of circles
Family of circles
each of which intersects the lines in the family
Family of lines
at right angles. Two such families of curves are
said to be mutually orthogonal, and each curve 
in one of the families is called an orthogonal 
trajectory of the other family. In electrostatics,
lines of force are orthogonal to the equipotential 
curves. In thermodynamics, the flow of heat across a plane surface is orthogonal to the
isothermal curves. In hydrodynamics, the flow (stream) lines are orthogonal trajectories
of the velocity potential curves.
Finding Orthogonal Trajectories
Describe the orthogonal trajectories for the family of curves given by
for 
Sketch several members of each family.
Solution
First, solve the given equation for 
and write 
Then, by differentiating
implicitly with respect to 
you obtain the differential equation
Differential equation
Slope of given family
Because 
represents the slope of the given family of curves at 
it follows that
the orthogonal family has the negative reciprocal slope 
So,

Modeling Advertising Awareness
A new cereal product is introduced through an advertising campaign to a population of
1 million potential customers. The rate at which the population hears about the product
is assumed to be proportional to the number of people who are not yet aware of the
product. By the end of 1 year, half of the population has heard of the product. How
many will have heard of it by the end of 2 years?
Solution
Let be the number (in millions) of people at time who have heard of the
product. This means that 
is the number of people who have not heard of it, and
is the rate at which the population hears about the product. From the given
assumption, you can write the differential equation as shown.

The next example describes a growth model called a Gompertz growth model.
This model assumes that the rate of change of is proportional to the product of and
the natural log of 
where 
is the population limit.
Modeling Population Growth
A population of 20 wolves has been introduced into a national park. The forest service
estimates that the maximum population the park can sustain is 200 wolves. After 3 years,
the population is estimated to be 40 wolves. According to a Gompertz growth model,
how many wolves will there be 10 years after their introduction?
Solution
Let 
be the number of wolves at any time 
From the given assumption
about the rate of growth of the population, you can write the differential equation as
shown.
Using separation of variables or a computer algebra system, you can find the general
solution to be

In genetics, a commonly used hybrid selection model is based on the differential
equation
In this model,
represents the portion of the population that has a certain characteristic
and represents the time (measured in generations). The numbers 
and are constants
that depend on the genetic characteristic that is being studied.
Modeling Hybrid Selection
You are studying a population of beetles to determine how quickly characteristic D will
pass from one generation to the next. At the beginning of your study 
you find
that half the population has characteristic D. After four generations 
you find
that 80% of the population has characteristic D. Use the hybrid selection model above
with 
and 
to find the percent of the population that will have characteristic D
after 10 generations.
Solution
Using

model is

The Logistic Equation
Solve and analyze logistic differential equations.
Use logistic differential equations to model and solve applied problems.
Logistic Differential Equation
In Section 6.2, the exponential growth model was derived from the fact that the rate of
change of a variable is proportional to the value of 
You observed that the differential
equation 
has the general solution 
Exponential growth is unlimited,
but when describing a population, there often exists some upper limit 
past which
growth cannot occur. This upper limit 
is called the carrying capacity, which is the
maximum population 
that can be sustained or supported as time increases. A model
that is often used to describe this type of growth is the logistic differential equation
Logistic differential equation
where and 
are positive constants. A population that satisfies this equation does not
grow without bound, but approaches the carrying capacity 
as increases.
From the equation, you can see that if is between 0 and the carrying capacity 
then 
and the population increases. If is greater than 
then 
and
the population decreases. The general solution of the logistic differential equation is
derived in the next example.

A Falling Object with Air Resistance
An object of mass 
is dropped from a hovering helicopter. The air resistance is 
proportional to the velocity of the object. Find the velocity of the object as a function
of time 
Solution
The velocity satisfies the equation
gravitational constant,
constant of proportionality
Letting 
you can separate variables to obtain
Because the object was dropped,

so 
and it follows that
A simple electric circuit consists of an electric current (in amperes), a resistance
(in ohms), an inductance 
(in henrys), and a constant electromotive force 
(in
volts), as shown in Figure 6.28. According to Kirchhoff’s Second Law, if the switch 
is closed when 
then the applied electromotive force (voltage) is equal to the sum
of the voltage drops in the rest of the circuit. This, in turn, means that the current 
satisfies the differential equation
An Electric Circuit Problem

(in seconds), given that

One type of problem that can be described in terms of a differential equation
involves chemical mixtures, as illustrated in the next example.
A Mixture Problem
A tank contains 50 gallons of a solution composed of 90% water and 10% alcohol. A
second solution containing 50% water and 50% alcohol is added to the tank at the rate
of 4 gallons per minute. As the second solution is being added, the tank is being drained
at a rate of 5 gallons per minute, as shown in Figure 6.29. The solution in the tank is
stirred constantly. How much alcohol is in the tank after 10 minutes?
Solution
Let 
be the number of gallons of alcohol in the tank at any time 
You
know that 
when 
Because the number of gallons of solution in the tank at
any time is 
and the tank loses 5 gallons of solution per minute, it must lose
gallons of alcohol per minute. Furthermore, because the tank is gaining 2 gallons of
alcohol per minute, the rate of change of alcohol in the tank is
To solve this linear differential equation, let
and obtain
Because 
you can drop the absolute value signs and conclude that
So, the general solution is
Because 
when 
you have
which means that the particular solution is
Finally, when 
the amount of alcohol in the tank is
which represents a solution containing 33.6% alcohol.

A person’s weight depends on both the number of calories
consumed and the energy used. Moreover, the amount of energy
used depends on a person’s weight—the average amount of energy
used by a person is 17.5 calories per pound per day. So, the more
weight a person loses, the less energy a person uses (assuming that
the person maintains a constant level of activity). An equation that
can be used to model weight loss is
where 
is the person’s weight (in pounds),
is the time in days,
and 
is the constant daily calorie consumption.
(a) Find the general solution of the differential equation.
(b) Consider a person who weighs 180 pounds and begins a diet of
2500 calories per day. How long will it take the person to lose 
10 pounds? How long will it take the person to lose 35 pounds?
(c) Use a graphing utility to graph the solution. What is the
“limiting” weight of the person?

Predator-Prey Differential Equations
Analyze predator-prey differential equations.
Analyze competing-species differential equations.
Predator-Prey Differential Equations
In the 1920s, mathematicians Alfred Lotka (1880–1949) and Vito Volterra (1860–1940)
independently developed mathematical models to represent many of the different ways
in which two species can interact with each other. Two common ways in which species
interact with each other are as predator and prey, and as competing species.
Consider a predator-prey relationship involving foxes (predators) and rabbits (prey).
Assume that the rabbits are the primary food source for the foxes, the rabbits have an
unlimited food supply, and there is no threat to the rabbits other than from the foxes.
Let 
represent the number of rabbits, let 
represent the number of foxes, and let 
represent time. When there are no foxes, the rabbit population grows according to the
exponential growth model 
When there are foxes but no rabbits, the foxes have no food and their population decays
according to the exponential decay model 
When both foxes and rabbits are present, there is an interaction rate of decline for the
rabbit population given by 
and an interaction rate of increase in the fox
population given by 
where 
So, the rates of change of each population can
be modeled by the following predator-prey system of differential equations.
Rate of change of prey
Rate of change of predators
These equations are called predator-prey equations or Lotka-Volterra equations. The
equations are autonomous because the rates of change do not depend explicitly on time 
In general, it is not possible to solve the predator-prey equations explicitly for and
However, you can use techniques such as Euler’s Method to approximate solutions.
Also, you can discover properties of the solutions by analyzing the differential equations.

There are two points of interest you should consider when analyzing predator-prey
equations. Consider the predator-prey equations
and
when 
or 
and 
when 
or 
So, at the points 
and 
the prey and predator populations are constant. These points are called 
critical points or equilibrium points of the predator-prey equations.
Analyzing Predator-Prey Equations Graphically
Let the predator-prey equations from Example 1
Rate of change of rabbit population
and
Rate of change of fox population
model a predator-prey relationship involving foxes and rabbits, where is the number
of rabbits and is the number of foxes after months. Use a graphing utility to graph
the functions and when 
and the initial conditions are 200 rabbits and
10 foxes. What do you observe?
Solution
The graphs of and are shown in Figure 6.30. Here are some observations.
• The rabbit and fox populations oscillate periodically between their respective minimum
and maximum values.
• The rabbit population oscillates from about 125 rabbits to about 300 rabbits.
• The fox population oscillates from about 10 foxes to about 35 foxes.
• About 20 months after the rabbit population peaks, the fox population peaks.
• The period of each population appears to be about 115 months.
In Example 2, the graph shows the curves plotted together with time along the
horizontal axis. You can also use the predator-prey equations 
and 
to graph
a slope field. The slope field is graphed using the -axis to represent the prey and the 
-axis to represent the predators.
Predator-Prey Equations and Slope Fields
Use a graphing utility to graph the slope field of the predator-prey equations given in
Example 2.
Solution
The slope field is shown in Figure 6.31. The -axis represents the rabbit
population, and the -axis represents the fox population.

Graphing a Solution Curve
Use the predator-prey equations
and
and the slope field from Example 3 to graph the solution curve using the initial conditions
of 200 rabbits and 10 foxes. Describe the changes in the populations as you trace the
solution curve.
Solution
The graph of the solution is a closed curve, as shown in Figures 6.32 and 6.33.

So, the rabbit population is increasing at 
This means that you should trace the curve counterclockwise as increases. As you
trace the curve, note the changes listed in Figure 6.34.

Competing Species
Consider two species that compete with each other for the food available in their
common environment. Assume that their populations are given by 
and 
at time 
When there is no interaction or competition between the species, the populations and
each experience logistic growth. So, the populations of the first species and the second
species can be modeled by the following differential equations.
Rate of change of first species without interaction
Rate of change of second species without interaction
When the species interact, their competition for resources causes a rate of decline
in each population proportional to the product 
Using a negative interaction factor
leads to the following competing-species equations (where 
and 
are 
positive constants).
Rate of change of first species with interaction
Rate of change of second species with interaction
In this text it is assumed that competing-species equations have four critical points,
as shown in Example 5.
Deriving the Critical Points
Show that the critical points of the competing-species equations
and
are 
and 
Solution
Set 
and 
equal to 0 and then factor to obtain the following 
system of equations.
Set 
equal to 0 and factor out 
Set  
equal to 0 and factor out 
If 
then 
or 
If 
then 
or 
So three of the 
critical points are 
and 
At each of these critical points, one of
the populations is 0. These points represent the possibility that both species cannot
coexist.
The fourth critical point is obtained by solving the system
The solution of this system is
Assuming this point exists and lies in Quadrant I of the 
-plane, the point represents
the possibility that both species can coexist.

Integration as an Accumulation Process
In this section, the integration formula for the area between two curves was developed by
using a rectangle as the representative element. For each new application in the remaining
sections of this chapter, an appropriate representative element will be constructed using
precalculus formulas you already know. Each integration formula will then be obtained
by summing or accumulating these representative elements.
For example, the area formula in this section was developed as follows.
Integration as an Accumulation Process
Find the area of the region bounded by the graph of 
and the axis. Describe
the integration as an accumulation process.
Solution
The area of the region is
You can think of the integration as an accumulation of the areas of the rectangles formed
as the representative rectangle slides from 
to 
as shown in Figure 7.11.

Find the volume of a solid of revolution using the washer method.
Find the volume of a solid with known cross sections.
The Disk Method
You have already learned that area is only one of the many applications of the definite
integral. Another important application is its use in finding the volume of a three-
dimensional solid. In this section, you will study a particular type of three-dimensional
solid—one whose cross sections are similar. Solids of revolution are used commonly in
engineering and manufacturing. Some examples are axles, funnels, pills, bottles, and
pistons, as shown in Figure 7.12.
Solids of revolution
Figure 7.12
When a region in the plane is revolved about a line, the resulting solid is a solid of
revolution, and the line is called the axis of revolution. The simplest such solid is a
right circular cylinder or disk, which is formed by revolving a rectangle about an axis
adjacent to one side of the rectangle, as shown in Figure 7.13. The volume of such a
disk is
where 
is the radius of the disk and 
is the width.
To see how to use the volume of a disk to find the volume of a general solid of 
revolution, consider a solid of revolution formed by revolving the plane region in 
Figure 7.14 about the indicated axis. To determine the volume of this solid, consider a
representative rectangle in the plane region. When this rectangle is revolved about the
axis of revolution, it generates a representative disk whose volume is 
Approximating the volume of the solid by 
such disks of width 
and radius 
produces

The Washer Method
The disk method can be extended to cover solids of revolution with holes by replacing
the representative disk with a representative washer. The washer is formed by revolving
a rectangle about an axis, as shown in Figure 7.18. If and 
are the inner and outer
radii of the washer and 
is the width of the washer, then the volume is
To see how this concept can be used to find the volume of a solid of revolution,
consider a region bounded by an outer radius
and an inner radius
as shown
in Figure 7.19. If the region is revolved about its axis of revolution, then the volume of
the resulting solid is
Washer method
Note that the integral involving the inner radius represents the volume of the hole and
is subtracted from the integral involving the outer radius.

TECHNOLOGY
Some graphing utilities have the capability of generating (or
have built-in software capable of generating) a solid of revolution. If you have access
to such a utility, use it to graph some of the solids of revolution described in this 
section. For instance, the solid in Example 4 might appear like that shown in 
Figure 7.22.

Manufacturing
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A manufacturer drills a hole through the center of a metal sphere of radius 5 inches, as
shown in Figure 7.23(a). The hole has a radius of 3 inches. What is the volume of the
resulting metal ring?
Solution
You can imagine the ring to be generated by a segment of the circle whose
equation is 
as shown in Figure 7.23(b). Because the radius of the hole is
3 inches, you can let 
and solve the equation 
to determine that the
limits of integration are 
So, the inner and outer radii are 
and
and the volume is
Solids with Known Cross Sections
With the disk method, you can find the volume of a solid having a circular cross
section whose area is 
This method can be generalized to solids of any shape,
as long as you know a formula for the area of an arbitrary cross section. Some common
cross sections are squares, rectangles, triangles, semicircles, and trapezoids.

Volume: The Shell Method
Find the volume of a solid of revolution using the shell method.
Compare the uses of the disk method and the shell method.
The Shell Method
In this section, you will study an alternative method for finding the volume of a solid
of revolution. This method is called the shell method because it uses cylindrical shells.
A comparison of the advantages of the disk and shell methods is given later in this
section.
To begin, consider a representative rectangle as shown in Figure 7.27, where 
is
the width of the rectangle,
is the height of the rectangle, and is the distance between
the axis of revolution and the center of the rectangle. When this rectangle is revolved
about its axis of revolution, it forms a cylindrical shell (or tube) of thickness 
To find
the volume of this shell, consider two cylinders. The radius of the larger cylinder 
corresponds to the outer radius of the shell, and the radius of the smaller cylinder 
corresponds to the inner radius of the shell. Because is the average radius of the shell,
you know the outer radius is
Outer radius
and the inner radius is
Inner radius
So, the volume of the shell is
You can use this formula to find the volume of a solid of revolution. For instance,
the plane region in Figure 7.28 is revolved about a line to form the indicated solid.
Consider a horizontal rectangle of width 
As the plane region is revolved 
about a line parallel to the 
axis, the rectangle generates a representative shell whose
volume is
You can approximate the volume of the solid by 
such shells of thickness 
height
and average radius 
This approximation appears to become better and better as 
So, the
volume of the solid is

Solution
Because the axis of revolution is 
vertical, use a vertical representative rectangle,
as shown in Figure 7.30. The width 
indicates
that is the variable of integration. The distance
from the center of the rectangle to the axis of 
revolution is

Using the Shell Method to Find Volume
Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving the region bounded by
the graph of
and the 
axis 
about the 
axis.
Solution
Because the axis of revolution is horizontal, use a horizontal representative
rectangle, as shown in Figure 7.31. The width 
indicates that 
is the variable of 
integration. The distance from the center of the rectangle to the axis of revolution is
and the height of the rectangle is 
Because ranges from 0 to 1,

Integrate.
Comparison of Disk and Shell Methods
The disk and shell methods can be distinguished as follows. For the disk method, the
representative rectangle is always perpendicular to the axis of revolution, whereas
for the shell method, the representative rectangle is always parallel to the axis of
revolution, as shown in Figure 7.32.

Often, one method is more convenient to use than the other. The next example 
illustrates a case in which the shell method is preferable.
Shell Method Preferable
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of 
and
about the 
axis.
Solution
In Example 4 in Section 7.2, you saw that the washer method requires two
integrals to determine the volume of this solid. See Figure 7.33(a).
Apply washer method.
Simplify.
Integrate.
In Figure 7.33(b), you can see that the shell method requires only one integral to find
the volume.
Apply shell method.
Integrate.
Consider the solid formed by revolving the region in Example 3 about the vertical
line 
Would the resulting solid of revolution have a greater volume or a smaller
volume than the solid in Example 3? Without integrating, you should be able to reason
that the resulting solid would have a smaller volume because “more” of the revolved
region would be closer to the axis of revolution. To confirm this, try solving the 
integral
which gives the volume of the solid.

Volume of a Pontoon
A pontoon is to be made in the shape shown in Figure 7.34. The pontoon is designed
by rotating the graph of
about the 
axis, where and are measured in feet. Find the volume of the pontoon.
Solution
Refer to Figure 7.35 and use the disk method as shown.
Apply disk method.
Simplify.
Integrate.
To use the shell method in Example 4, you would have to solve for in terms of 
in the equation 
and then evaluate an integral that requires a -substitution.
Sometimes, solving for is very difficult (or even impossible). In such cases, you
must use a vertical rectangle (of width 
), thus making 
the variable of integration.
The position (horizontal or vertical) of the axis of revolution then determines the
method to be used. This is shown in Example 5.
Shell Method Necessary
Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by the graphs of
and 
about the line 
as shown in Figure 7.36.
Solution
In the equation 
you cannot easily solve for in terms of
(See the discussion at the end of Section 3.8.) Therefore, the variable of integration
must be 
and you should choose a vertical representative rectangle. Because the 
rectangle is parallel to the axis of revolution, use the shell method.
Apply shell method.

The Oblateness of Saturn
Saturn is the most oblate of the 
planets in our solar system. Its equatorial radius is 60,268 kilometers
and its polar radius is 54,364 kilometers. The color-enhanced 
photograph of Saturn was taken by Voyager 1. In the photograph,
the oblateness of Saturn is clearly visible.

Arc Length
In this section, definite integrals are used to find the arc lengths of curves and the areas
of surfaces of revolution. In either case, an arc (a segment of a curve) is approximated
by straight line segments whose lengths are given by the familiar Distance Formula
A rectifiable curve is one that has a finite arc length. You will see that a sufficient
condition for the graph of a function to be rectifiable between

check to see that this new definition agrees with the standard Distance Formula for the
length of a line segment. This is shown in Example 1.

TECHNOLOGY
Definite integrals representing arc length often are very 
difficult to evaluate. In this section, a few examples are presented. In the next 
chapter, with more advanced integration techniques, you will be able to tackle more
difficult arc length problems. In the meantime, remember that you can always use a
numerical integration program to approximate an arc length. For instance, use the
numerical integration feature of a graphing utility to approximate arc lengths in
Examples 2 and 3.

Area of a Surface of Revolution
In Sections 7.2 and 7.3, integration was used to calculate the volume of a solid
of revolution. You will now look at a procedure for finding the area of a surface of
revolution.
The area of a surface of revolution is 
derived from the formula for the lateral surface
area of the frustum of a right circular cone.
Consider the line segment in the figure at the 
right, where 
is the length of the line segment,
is the radius at the left end of the line segment,
and 
is the radius at the right end of the line 
segment. When the line segment is revolved 
about its axis of revolution, it forms a frustum 
of a right circular cone, with
Lateral surface area of frustum
where
Average radius of frustum
(In Exercise 54, you are asked to verify the formula for )
Consider a function that has a continuous derivative on the interval 
The
graph of is revolved about the 
axis to form a surface of revolution, as shown in
Figure 7.43. Let 
be a partition of 
with subintervals of width 
Then the line
segment of length
generates a frustum of a cone. Let 
be the average radius of this frustum. By the
Intermediate Value Theorem, a point 
exists (in the 
subinterval) such that
The lateral surface area 
of the frustum is

7.5 Work
Find the work done by a constant force.
Find the work done by a variable force.
Work Done by a Constant Force
The concept of work is important to scientists and engineers for determining the 
energy needed to perform various jobs. For instance, it is useful to know the amount of
work done when a crane lifts a steel girder, when a spring is compressed, when a 
rocket is propelled into the air, or when a truck pulls a load along a highway.
In general, work is done by a force when it moves an object. If the force applied
to the object is constant, then the definition of work is as follows.
There are four fundamental types of forces—gravitational, electromagnetic, strong
nuclear, and weak nuclear. A force can be thought of as a push or a pull; a force changes
the state of rest or state of motion of a body. For gravitational forces on Earth, it is 
common to use units of measure corresponding to the weight of an object.
Lifting an Object
Determine the work done in lifting a 50-pound object 4 feet.
Solution
The magnitude of the required force 
is the weight of the object, as shown
in Figure 7.46. So, the work done in lifting the object 4 feet is
pounds,
foot-pounds.
In the U.S. measurement system, work is typically expressed in foot-pounds
(ft-lb), inch-pounds, or foot-tons. In the International System of Units (SI), the basic
unit of force is the newton—the force required to produce an acceleration of 1 meter per
second per second on a mass of 1 kilogram. In this system, work is typically expressed
in newton-meters, also called joules. In another system, the centimeter-gram-second
(C-G-S) system, the basic unit of force is the dyne—the force required to produce an
acceleration of 1 centimeter per second per second on a mass of 1 gram. In this system,
work is typically expressed in dyne-centimeters (ergs) or newton-meters (joules).

How Much Work?
In Example 1, 200 foot-pounds of work was needed to lift
the 50-pound object 4 feet vertically off the ground. After lifting the object, you
carry it a horizontal distance of 4 feet. Would this require an additional 
200 foot-pounds of work? Explain your reasoning.

Work Done by a Variable Force
In Example 1, the force involved was constant. When a variable force is applied to an
object, calculus is needed to determine the work done, because the amount of force
changes as the object changes position. For instance, the force required to compress a
spring increases as the spring is compressed.
Consider an object that is moved along a straight line from 
to 
by a
continuously varying force 
Let 
be a partition that divides the interval 
into
subintervals determined by
and let 
For each 
choose 
such that
Then at 
the force is 
Because 
is continuous, you can approximate the work
done in moving the object through the th subinterval by the increment
as shown in Figure 7.47. So, the total work 
done as the object moves from to is 
approximated by
This approximation appears to become better 
and better as 
So, the work 
done is
The remaining examples in this section use some well-known physical laws. The
discoveries of many of these laws occurred during the same period in which calculus
was being developed. In fact, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there was
little difference between physicists and mathematicians. One such physicist-
mathematician was Emilie de Breteuil. Breteuil was instrumental in synthesizing the
work of many other scientists, including Newton, Leibniz, Huygens, Kepler, and
Descartes. Her physics text Institutions was widely used for many years.

The three laws of physics listed below were developed by Robert Hooke
(1635–1703), Isaac Newton (1642–1727), and Charles Coulomb (1736–1806).
1. Hooke’s Law: The force 
required to compress or stretch a spring (within its 
elastic limits) is proportional to the distance 
that the spring is compressed or
stretched from its original length. That is,
where the constant of proportionality 
(the spring constant) depends on the 
specific nature of the spring.
2. Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation: The force 
of attraction between two
particles of masses 
and 
is proportional to the product of the masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two particles. That is,
When 
and 
are in kilograms and 
in meters,
will be in newtons for a value
of 
cubic meter per kilogram-second squared, where 
is the 
gravitational constant.
3. Coulomb’s Law: The force 
between two charges 
and 
in a vacuum is
proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between the two charges. That is,
When 
and 
are given in electrostatic units and 
in centimeters,
will be in
dynes for a value of 
Compressing a Spring
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A force of 750 pounds compresses a spring 3 inches from its natural length of 
15 inches. Find the work done in compressing the spring an additional 3 inches.
Solution
By Hooke’s Law, the force 
required to compress the spring 
units
(from its natural length) is 
Because 
it follows that
So,
as shown in Figure 7.48. To find the increment of work, assume that
the force required to compress the spring over a small increment 
is nearly constant.
So, the increment of work is
Because the spring is compressed from 
to 
inches less than its natural
length, the work required is
inch-pounds.
Note that you do not integrate from 
to 
because you were asked to
determine the work done in compressing the spring an additional 3 inches (not
including the first 3 inches).

Moving a Space Module into Orbit
A space module weighs 15 metric tons on the 
surface of Earth. How much work is done in 
propelling the module to a height of 800 miles 
above Earth, as shown in Figure 7.49? (Use 
4000 miles as the radius of Earth. Do not consider 
the effect of air resistance or the weight of the 
propellant.)
Solution
Because the weight of a body varies
inversely as the square of its distance from the 
center of Earth, the force 
exerted by 
gravity is
where 
is the constant of proportionality. Because the module weighs 15 metric tons
on the surface of Earth and the radius of Earth is approximately 4000 miles, you have
So, the increment of work is
Finally, because the module is propelled from 
to 
miles, the total
work done is
Formula for work
Integrate.
In SI units, using a conversion factor of 1 foot-pound
joules, the work done is
joules.
The solutions to Examples 2 and 3 conform to our development of work as the
summation of increments in the form
Another way to formulate the increment of work is
This second interpretation of 
is useful in problems involving the movement of 
nonrigid substances such as fluids and chains.

Emptying a Tank of Oil
A spherical tank of radius 8 feet is half full of oil
that weighs 50 pounds per cubic foot. Find the 
work required to pump oil out through a hole in 
the top of the tank.
Solution
Consider the oil to be subdivided 
into disks of thickness 
and radius 
as shown 
in Figure 7.50. Because the increment of force 
for each disk is given by its weight, you have
For a circle of radius 8 and center at 
you have
and you can write the force increment as
In Figure 7.50, note that a disk 
feet from the bottom of the tank must be moved a 
distance of 
feet. So, the increment of work is
Because the tank is half full,
ranges from 0 to 8, and the work required to empty the
tank is
To estimate the reasonableness of the result in Example 4, consider that the weight of
the oil in the tank is
Lifting the entire half-tank of oil 8 feet would involve work of
Formula for work done by a constant force
foot-pounds.
Because the oil is actually lifted between 8 and 16 feet, it seems reasonable that the
work done is about 589,782 foot-pounds.

Lifting a Chain
A 20-foot chain weighing 5 pounds per foot is lying coiled on the ground. How much
work is required to raise one end of the chain to a height of 20 feet so that it is fully
extended, as shown in Figure 7.51?
Solution
Imagine that the chain is divided into small sections, each of length 
Then the weight of each section is the increment of force
Because a typical section (initially on the ground) is raised to a height of 
the 
increment of work is
Because ranges from 0 to 20, the total work is
In the next example, you will consider a piston of radius in a cylindrical casing,
as shown in Figure 7.52. As the gas in the cylinder expands, the piston moves, and work
is done. If 
represents the pressure of the gas (in pounds per square foot) against the
piston head and 
represents the volume of the gas (in cubic feet), then the work 
increment involved in moving the piston 
feet is
So, as the volume of the gas expands from 
to 
the work done in moving the 
piston is
Assuming the pressure of the gas to be inversely proportional to its volume, you have
and the integral for work becomes
Work Done by an Expanding Gas
A quantity of gas with an initial volume of 1 cubic foot and a pressure of 500 pounds
per square foot expands to a volume of 2 cubic feet. Find the work done by the gas.
(Assume that the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.)

Tidal power plants use “tidal energy” to produce electrical energy.
To construct a tidal power plant, a dam is built to separate a basin
from the sea. Electrical energy is produced as the water flows back
and forth between the basin and the sea. The amount of “natural
energy” produced depends on the volume of the basin and the tidal
range—the vertical distance between high and low tides. (Several
natural basins have tidal ranges in excess of 15 feet; the Bay of
Fundy in Nova Scotia has a tidal range of 53 feet.)
(a) Consider a basin with a rectangular base, as shown in the 
figure. The basin has a tidal range of 25 feet, with low tide 
corresponding to 
How much water does the basin hold
at high tide?
(b) The amount of energy produced during the filling (or the 
emptying) of the basin is proportional to the amount of work
required to fill (or empty) the basin. How much work is required
to fill the basin with seawater? (Use a seawater density of 
64 pounds per cubic foot.)
The Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia has an extreme tidal range,
as displayed in the greatly contrasting photos above.

Mass
In this section, you will study several important applications of integration that are 
related to mass. Mass is a measure of a body’s resistance to changes in motion, and is
independent of the particular gravitational system in which the body is located. However,
because so many applications involving mass occur on Earth’s surface, an object’s mass
is sometimes equated with its weight. This is not technically correct. Weight is a type of
force and as such is dependent on gravity. Force and mass are related by the equation
The table below lists some commonly used measures of mass and force, together with
their conversion factors.
Mass on the Surface of Earth
Find the mass (in slugs) of an object whose weight at sea level is 1 pound.
Solution
Use 32 feet per second per second as the acceleration due to gravity.
Because many applications involving mass occur on Earth’s surface, this amount of
mass is called a pound mass.

Center of Mass in a One-Dimensional System
You will now consider two types of moments of a mass—the moment about a point
and the moment about a line. To define these two moments, consider an idealized
situation in which a mass 
is concentrated at a point. If is the distance between this
point mass and another point 
then the moment of m about the point P is
and is the length of the moment arm.
The concept of moment can be demonstrated simply by a seesaw, as shown in
Figure 7.53. A child of mass 20 kilograms sits 2 meters to the left of fulcrum 
and an
older child of mass 30 kilograms sits 2 meters to the right of 
From experience, you
know that the seesaw will begin to rotate clockwise, moving the larger child down. This
rotation occurs because the moment produced by the child on the left is less than the
moment produced by the child on the right.
kilogram-meters
kilogram-meters
To balance the seesaw, the two moments must be equal. For example, if the larger child
moved to a position meters from the fulcrum, then the seesaw would balance, because
each child would produce a moment of 40 kilogram-meters.
To generalize this, you can introduce a coordinate line on which the origin
corresponds to the fulcrum, as shown in Figure 7.54. Several point masses are located
on the 
axis. The measure of the tendency of this system to rotate about the origin is
the moment about the origin, and it is defined as the sum of the products 
The
moment about the origin is denoted by 
and can be written as
If 
is 0, then the system is said to be in equilibrium.
If 
then the system is in equilibrium.
Figure 7.54
For a system that is not in equilibrium, the center of mass is defined as the point
at which the fulcrum could be relocated to attain equilibrium. If the system were 
translated units, then each coordinate 
would become
and because the moment of the translated system is 0, you have
Solving for produces

Rather than define the moment of a mass, you could define the moment of a force.
In this context, the center of mass is called the center of gravity. Consider a system of
point masses 
that is located at 
Then, because
the total force of the system is

Center of Mass in a Two-Dimensional System
You can extend the concept of moment to two dimensions by considering a system of
masses located in the 
plane at the points 
as shown in
Figure 7.56. Rather than defining a single moment (with respect to the origin), two
moments are defined—one with respect to the 
axis and one with respect to the
axis.
The moment of a system of masses in the plane can be taken about any horizontal
or vertical line. In general, the moment about a line is the sum of the product of the
masses and the directed distances from the points to the line.

Center of Mass of a Planar Lamina
So far in this section, you have assumed the total mass of a system to be distributed at
discrete points in a plane or on a line. Now consider a thin, flat plate of material of 
constant density called a planar lamina (see Figure 7.58). Density is a measure of
mass per unit of volume, such as grams per cubic centimeter. For planar laminas,
however, density is considered to be a measure of mass per unit of area. Density is 
denoted by 
the lowercase Greek letter rho.
Consider an irregularly shaped planar lamina 
of uniform density 
bounded by the graphs of
and 
as shown in
Figure 7.59. The mass of this region is
where 
is the area of the region. To find the 
center of mass of this lamina, partition the 
interval 
into subintervals of equal width 
Let 
be the center of the 
subinterval. 
You can approximate the portion of the lamina 
lying in the 
subinterval by a rectangle whose 
height is 
Because the density 
of the rectangle is 
its mass is
Density

Width
Now, considering this mass to be located at the center 
of the rectangle, the directed
distance from the axis to 
is 
So, the moment of

You can think of the center of mass

The Center of Mass of a Planar Lamina
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Find the center of mass of the lamina of uniform density 
bounded by the graph of
and the 
axis.
Solution
Because the center of mass lies on the axis of symmetry, you know that
Moreover, the mass of the lamina is
To find the moment about the 
axis, place a 
representative rectangle in the region, as shown 
in the figure at the right. The distance from 
the 
axis to the center of this rectangle is
Because the mass of the representative rectangle
is
you have
and is
So, the center of mass (the balancing point) of the lamina is 
as shown in
Figure 7.60.
The density in Example 4 is a common factor of both the moments and the mass,
and as such divides out of the quotients representing the coordinates of the center of
mass. So, the center of mass of a lamina of uniform density depends only on the shape
of the lamina and not on its density. For this reason, the point
Center of mass or centroid
is sometimes called the center of mass of a region in the plane, or the centroid of the
region. In other words, to find the centroid of a region in the plane, you simply assume
that the region has a constant density of 
and compute the corresponding center
of mass.

Theorem of Pappus
The final topic in this section is a useful theorem credited to Pappus of Alexandria 
(ca. 300 A.D.), a Greek mathematician whose eight-volume Mathematical Collection is
a record of much of classical Greek mathematics. You are asked to prove this theorem
in Section 14.4.
The Theorem of Pappus can be used to find the volume of a torus, as shown in the
next example. Recall that a torus is a doughnut-shaped solid formed by revolving a 
circular region about a line that lies in the same plane as the circle (but does not 
intersect the circle).
Finding Volume by the Theorem of Pappus

the circular region bounded by 
about the 
axis, as shown in Figure 7.64(b).

Solution

Fluid Pressure and Fluid Force
Find fluid pressure and fluid force.
Fluid Pressure and Fluid Force
Swimmers know that the deeper an object is submerged in a fluid, the greater the
pressure on the object. Pressure is defined as the force per unit of area over the surface
of a body. For example, because a column of water that is 10 feet in height and 1 inch
square weighs 4.3 pounds, the fluid pressure at a depth of 10 feet of water is 4.3 pounds
per square inch.* At 20 feet, this would increase to 8.6 pounds per square inch, and in
general the pressure is proportional to the depth of the object in the fluid.
Below are some common weight-densities of fluids in pounds per cubic foot.

When calculating fluid pressure, you can use an important (and rather surprising)
physical law called Pascal’s Principle, named after the French mathematician Blaise
Pascal. Pascal’s Principle states that the pressure exerted by a fluid at a depth 
is 
transmitted equally in all directions. For example, in Figure 7.65, the pressure at the
indicated depth is the same for all three objects. Because fluid pressure is given in terms
of force per unit area 
the fluid force on a submerged horizontal surface of
area 
is
Fluid force
(pressure)(area).
The pressure at is the same for all three objects.

* The total pressure on an object in 10 feet of water would also include the pressure due
to Earth’s atmosphere. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is approximately 14.7 pounds per

BLAISE PASCAL (1623–1662)
Pascal is well known for his work
in many areas of mathematics and
physics, and also for his influence
on Leibniz. Although much of
Pascal’s work in calculus was 
intuitive and lacked the rigor of
modern mathematics, he 
nevertheless anticipated many
important results.

Fluid Force on a Submerged Sheet
Find the fluid force on a rectangular metal sheet measuring 3 feet by 4 feet that is
submerged in 6 feet of water, as shown in Figure 7.66.
Solution
Because the weight-density of water is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot and the
sheet is submerged in 6 feet of water, the fluid pressure is
Because the total area of the sheet is 
square feet, the fluid force is
This result is independent of the size of the body of water. The fluid force would be
the same in a swimming pool or lake.
In Example 1, the fact that the sheet is rectangular and horizontal means that you
do not need the methods of calculus to solve the problem. Consider a surface that is 
submerged vertically in a fluid. This problem is more difficult because the pressure 
is not constant over the surface.
Consider a vertical plate that is submerged in
a fluid of weight-density 
(per unit of volume),
as shown in Figure 7.67. To determine the total
force against one side of the region from depth 
to depth 
you can subdivide the interval 
into subintervals, each of width 
Next,
consider the representative rectangle of width 
and length 
where 
is in the th 
subinterval. The force against this representative
rectangle is
The force against such rectangles is
Note that 
is considered to be constant and is factored out of the summation.
Therefore, taking the limit as 
suggests the next definition.

Fluid Force on a Vertical Surface
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A vertical gate in a dam has the shape of an
isosceles trapezoid 8 feet across the top and 
6 feet across the bottom, with a height of 
5 feet, as shown in Figure 7.68(a). What is 
the fluid force on the gate when the top of the
gate is 4 feet below the surface of the water?
Solution
In setting up a mathematical model
for this problem, you are at liberty to locate the 
and 
axes in several different ways. A 
convenient approach is to let the -axis bisect 
the gate and place the 
axis at the surface of 
the water, as shown in Figure 7.68(b). So, the 
depth of the water at in feet is
To find the length 
of the region at 
find 
the equation of the line forming the right side 
of the gate. Because this line passes through 
the points 
and 
its equation is
In Figure 7.68(b) you can see that the length of the region at is
Finally, by integrating from 
to 
you can calculate the fluid force to be
In Example 2, the axis coincided with the surface of the water. This was convenient,
but arbitrary. In choosing a coordinate system to represent a physical situation, you
should consider various possibilities. Often you can simplify the calculations in a problem
by locating the coordinate system to take advantage of special characteristics of the
problem, such as symmetry.

Fluid Force on a Vertical Surface
A circular observation window on a marine science ship has a radius of 1 foot, and the
center of the window is 8 feet below water level, as shown in Figure 7.69. What is the
fluid force on the window?
Solution
To take advantage of symmetry, locate a coordinate system such that the
origin coincides with the center of the window, as shown in Figure 7.69. The depth at
is then
The horizontal length of the window is 
and you can use the equation for the 
circle,
to solve for as shown.
Finally, because 
ranges from 
to 
and using 64 pounds per cubic foot as the
weight-density of seawater, you have
Initially it looks as though this integral would be difficult to solve. However, when you
break the integral into two parts and apply symmetry, the solution is simpler.
The second integral is 0 (because the integrand is odd and the limits of integration are
symmetric with respect to the origin). Moreover, by recognizing that the first integral
represents the area of a semicircle of radius 1, you obtain
So, the fluid force on the window is about 1608.5 pounds.

11. Archimedes’ Principle
Archimedes’ Principle states
that the upward or buoyant force on an object within a fluid is
equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces. For a
partially submerged object, you can obtain information about
the relative densities of the floating object and the fluid by
observing how much of the object is above and below the 
surface. You can also determine the size of a floating object if
you know the amount that is above the surface and the relative
densities. You can see the top of a floating iceberg (see figure).
The density of ocean water is 
kilograms per cubic
meter, and that of ice is 
kilograms per cubic meter.
What percent of the total iceberg is below the surface?

Fitting Integrands to Basic Integration Rules
In this chapter, you will study several integration techniques that greatly expand the set
of integrals to which the basic integration rules can be applied. These rules are reviewed
at the left. A major step in solving any integration problem is recognizing which basic
integration rule to use.

Using Two Basic Rules to Solve a Single Integral
Evaluate 
Solution
Begin by writing the integral as the sum of two integrals. Then apply the
Power Rule and the Arcsine Rule.
See Figure 8.1.
Rules 18, 19, and 20 of the basic integration rules on the preceding page all have
expressions involving the sum or difference of two squares:
and
These expressions are often apparent after a -substitution, as shown in Example 3.

Simpson’s Rule can be used to give a good approximation of
the value of the integral in Example 2 (for 
the approximation is 1.839).
When using numerical integration, however, you should be aware that Simpson’s
Rule does not always give good approximations when one or both of the limits of
integration are near a vertical asymptote. For instance, using the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, you can obtain
For 
Simpson’s Rule gives an approximation of 6.889.

Two of the most commonly overlooked integration rules are the Log Rule and the
Power Rule. Notice in the next two examples how these two integration rules can be
disguised.
A Disguised Form of the Log Rule
Find 
Solution
The integral does not appear to fit any of the basic rules. The quotient form,
however, suggests the Log Rule. If you let 
then 
You can obtain
the required 
by adding and subtracting 
in the numerator.

Integrate.
There is usually more than one way to solve an integration problem. For instance,
in Example 4, try integrating by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 
to
obtain an integral of the form 
See if you can get the same answer by this 
procedure. (Be careful: the answer will appear in a different form.)
A Disguised Form of the Power Rule

Solution
Again, the integral does not appear to fit any of the basic rules. However,
considering the two primary choices for

Find an antiderivative using integration by parts.
Integration by Parts
In this section, you will study an important integration technique called integration by
parts. This technique can be applied to a wide variety of functions and is particularly
useful for integrands involving products of algebraic and transcendental functions. For
instance, integration by parts works well with integrals such as
and
Integration by parts is based on the formula for the derivative of a product
where both and are differentiable functions of 
When 
and 
are continuous, you
can integrate both sides of this equation to obtain
By rewriting this equation, you obtain the next theorem.
This formula expresses the original integral in terms of another integral. Depending on
the choices of 
and 
it may be easier to evaluate the second integral than the 
original one. Because the choices of 
and 
are critical in the integration by parts
process, the guidelines below are provided.
When using integration by parts, note that you can first choose 
or first choose
After you choose, however, the choice of the other factor is determined—it must be
the remaining portion of the integrand. Also note that 
must contain the differential
of the original integral.

TECHNOLOGY
Remember that there are two ways to use technology to 
evaluate a definite integral: (1) you can use a numerical approximation such as the
Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson’s Rule, or (2) you can use a computer algebra system
to find the antiderivative and then apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Both
methods have shortcomings. To find the possible error when using a numerical
method, the integrand must have a second derivative (Trapezoidal Rule) or a fourth
derivative (Simpson’s Rule) in the interval of integration; the integrand in Example 3
fails to meet either of these requirements. To apply the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, the symbolic integration utility must be able to find the antiderivative.

Some integrals require repeated use of the integration by parts formula.
Repeated Use of Integration by Parts
Find 
Solution
The factors 
and sin 
are equally easy to integrate. However, the
derivative of 
becomes simpler, whereas the derivative of sin 
does not. So, you
should let 
Now, integration by parts produces
First use of integration by parts
This first use of integration by parts has succeeded in simplifying the original integral,
but the integral on the right still doesn’t fit a basic integration rule. To evaluate that 
integral, you can apply integration by parts again. This time, let 
Now, integration by parts produces
Second use of integration by parts
Combining these two results, you can write
When making repeated applications of integration by parts, you need to be careful
not to interchange the substitutions in successive applications. For instance, in Example 4,
the first substitution was 
and 
If, in the second application, you
had switched the substitution to 
and 
you would have obtained
thereby undoing the previous integration and returning to the original integral. When
making repeated applications of integration by parts, you should also watch for the
appearance of a constant multiple of the original integral. For instance, this occurs when
you use integration by parts to evaluate 
and it also occurs in Example 5
on the next page.
The integral in Example 5 is an important one. In Section 8.4 (Example 5), you will
see that it is used to find the arc length of a parabolic segment.

where either 
or 
is a positive integer. To find antiderivatives for these forms, try to
break them into combinations of trigonometric integrals to which you can apply the
Power Rule.
For instance, you can evaluate

JOHN WALLIS (1616–1703)
Wallis did much of his work in
calculus prior to Newton and
Leibniz, and he influenced the
thinking of both of these men.
Wallis is also credited with 
introducing the present symbol
for infinity.

GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING INTEGRALS INVOLVING POWERS OF SECANT AND TANGENT
1. When the power of the secant is even and positive, save a secant-squared factor and convert the remaining factors 
to tangents. Then, expand and integrate.
Even
Convert to tangents
Save for 
2. When the power of the tangent is odd and positive, save a secant-tangent factor and convert the remaining factors 
to secants. Then, expand and integrate.
Odd
Convert to secants
Save for 
3. When there are no secant factors and the power of the tangent is even and positive, convert a tangent-squared 
factor to a secant-squared factor, then expand and repeat if necessary.
Convert to secants
4. When the integral is of the form
where 
is odd and positive, use integration by parts, as illustrated in Example 5 in Section 8.2.
5. When none of the first four guidelines applies, try converting to sines and cosines.

Power of Secant Is Even and Positive
Find 
Solution
Let 
then 
and you can write
In Example 5, the power of the tangent is odd and positive. So, you could also find
the integral using the procedure described in the second guideline on page 527. In
Exercises 69 and 70, you are asked to show that the results obtained by these two 
procedures differ only by a constant.
Power of Tangent Is Even
Evaluate 
Solution
Because there are no secant factors, you can begin by converting a tangent-
squared factor to a secant-squared factor.
Next, evaluate the definite integral.
The area represented by the definite integral is shown in Figure 8.5. Try using
Simpson’s Rule to approximate this integral. With 
you should obtain an
approximation that is within 0.00001 of the actual value.

For integrals involving powers of cotangents and cosecants, you can follow a 
strategy similar to that used for powers of tangents and secants. Also, when integrating
trigonometric functions, remember that it sometimes helps to convert the entire 
integrand to powers of sines and cosines.
Converting to Sines and Cosines
Find 
Solution
Because the first four guidelines on page 527 do not apply, try converting
the integrand to sines and cosines. In this case, you are able to integrate the resulting
powers of sine and cosine as shown.
Integrals Involving Sine-Cosine Products with Different
Angles
Integrals involving the products of sines and cosines of two different angles occur in many
applications. In such instances, you can use the following product-to-sum identities.

Power lines are constructed by stringing wire between supports and
adjusting the tension on each span. The wire hangs between 
supports in the shape of a catenary, as shown in the figure.
Let 
be the tension (in pounds) on a span of wire, let 
be the 
density (in pounds per foot), let 
be the acceleration due
to gravity (in feet per second per second), and let 
be the distance
(in feet) between the supports. Then the equation of the catenary is
where and are measured in feet.
(a) Find the length of the wire between two spans.
(b) To measure the tension in a span, power line workers use the

8.4 Trigonometric Substitution
Use trigonometric substitution to solve an integral.
Use integrals to model and solve real-life applications.
Trigonometric Substitution
Now that you can evaluate integrals involving powers of trigonometric functions, you
can use trigonometric substitution to evaluate integrals involving the radicals
and
The objective with trigonometric substitution is to eliminate the radical in the integrand.
You do this by using the Pythagorean identities.
For example, for 
let 
where 
Then
Note that 
because 
The restrictions on 
ensure that the function that defines the substitution is 
one-to-one. In fact, these are the same intervals over which the arcsine, arctangent, and
arcsecant are defined.

When using trigonometric substitution to evaluate definite integrals, you must be
careful to check that the values of lie in the intervals discussed at the beginning of this
section. For instance, if in Example 4 you had been asked to evaluate the definite integral
then using 
and 
in the interval 
would imply that 
So, when determining the upper and lower limits of integration, you would have to
choose such that 
In this case, the integral would be evaluated as shown.
Trigonometric substitution can be used with completing the square. For instance,
try finding the integral
To begin, you could complete the square and write the integral as 
Because the integrand has the form
with 
and 
you can now use trigonometric substitution to find the 
integral.
Trigonometric substitution can be used to evaluate the three integrals listed in the
next theorem. These integrals will be encountered several times in the remainder of the
text. When this happens, we will simply refer to this theorem. (In Exercise 71, you are
asked to verify the formulas given in the theorem.)

Comparing Two Fluid Forces
A sealed barrel of oil (weighing 48 pounds per cubic foot) is floating in seawater
(weighing 64 pounds per cubic foot), as shown in Figures 8.11 and 8.12. (The barrel is
not completely full of oil. With the barrel lying on its side, the top 0.2 foot of the 
barrel is empty.) Compare the fluid forces against one end of the barrel from the inside
and from the outside.
Solution
In Figure 8.12, locate the coordinate system with the origin at the center of
the circle
To find the fluid force against an end of the barrel from the inside, integrate between
and 0.8 (using a weight of 
).
General equation (See Section 7.7.)
To find the fluid force from the outside, integrate between 
and 0.4 (using a weight
of 
).
The details of integration are left for you to complete in Exercise 70. Intuitively, would
you say that the force from the oil (the inside) or the force from the seawater (the 
outside) is greater? By evaluating these two integrals, you can determine that

Understand the concept of partial fraction decomposition.
Use partial fraction decomposition with linear factors to integrate rational functions.
Use partial fraction decomposition with quadratic factors to integrate rational 
functions.
Partial Fractions
This section examines a procedure for decomposing a rational function into simpler
rational functions to which you can apply the basic integration formulas. This
procedure is called the method of partial fractions. To see the benefit of the method
of partial fractions, consider the integral
To evaluate this integral without partial fractions, you can complete the square and use
trigonometric substitution (see Figure 8.13) to obtain
Now, suppose you had observed that
Partial fraction decomposition
Then you could evaluate the integral, as shown.
This method is clearly preferable to trigonometric substitution. Its use, however,
depends on the ability to factor the denominator,
and to find the partial
fractions
and
In this section, you will study techniques for finding partial fraction decompositions.

JOHN BERNOULLI (1667–1748)
The method of partial fractions
was introduced by John Bernoulli,
a Swiss mathematician who was
instrumental in the early 
development of calculus. John
Bernoulli was a professor at the
University of Basel and taught
many outstanding students, the
most famous of whom was
Leonhard Euler.

Recall from algebra that every polynomial with real coefficients can be factored
into linear and irreducible quadratic factors.* For instance, the polynomial 
can be written as
where 
is a linear factor,
is a repeated linear factor, and 
is an
irreducible quadratic factor. Using this factorization, you can write the partial fraction
decomposition of the rational expression
where 
is a polynomial of degree less than 5, as shown.

when the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the 
denominator), divide the denominator into the numerator to obtain

the partial fraction
decomposition must include the following sum of 
fractions.

Linear Factors
Algebraic techniques for determining the constants in the numerators of a partial 
fraction decomposition with linear or repeated linear factors are shown in 
Examples 1 and 2.
Distinct Linear Factors

Because 
you should include one partial
fraction for each factor and write

denominator

Because this equation is to be true for all 
you can substitute any convenient values

The most convenient values are the ones that make

So, the decomposition is

Be sure you see that the method of partial fractions is practical only for integrals
of rational functions whose denominators factor “nicely.” For instance, when the
denominator in Example 1 is changed to
its factorization as
would be too cumbersome to use with partial fractions. In such cases, you should use
completing the square or a computer algebra system to perform the integration. When
you do this, you should obtain

that made the linear factors equal to 0. This method works well when the
partial fraction decomposition involves linear factors. When the decomposition involves
only quadratic factors, however, an alternative procedure is often more convenient. For
instance, try writing the right side of the basic equation in polynomial form and 
equating the coefficients of like terms. This method is shown in Example 4.
Repeated Quadratic Factors
Find 
Solution
Include one partial fraction for each power of 
and write
Multiplying by the least common denominator 
yields the basic equation
Expanding the basic equation and collecting like terms produces
Now, you can equate the coefficients of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.
Using the known values 
and 
you can write
Finally, you can conclude that

When integrating rational expressions, keep in mind that for improper rational
expressions such as
you must first divide to obtain
The proper rational expression is then decomposed into its partial fractions by the usual
methods. 
Here are some guidelines for solving the basic equation that is obtained in a partial
fraction decomposition.
Before concluding this section, here are a few things you should remember. First,
it is not necessary to use the partial fractions technique on all rational functions. For
instance, the following integral is evaluated more easily by the Log Rule.
Second, when the integrand is not in reduced form, reducing it may eliminate the need
for partial fractions, as shown in the following integral.
Finally, partial fractions can be used with some quotients involving transcendental 
functions. For instance, the substitution 
allows you to write

Integration by Tables
So far in this chapter, you have studied several integration techniques that can be used
with the basic integration rules. But merely knowing how to use the various techniques
is not enough. You also need to know when to use them. Integration is first and 
foremost a problem of recognition. That is, you must recognize which rule or technique
to apply to obtain an antiderivative. Frequently, a slight alteration of an integrand will
require a different integration technique (or produce a function whose antiderivative is
not an elementary function), as shown below.
Integration by parts
Power Rule
Log Rule
Not an elementary function
Many people find tables of integrals to be a valuable supplement to the integration
techniques discussed in this chapter. Tables of common integrals can be found in
Appendix B. Integration by tables is not a “cure-all” for all of the difficulties that can
accompany integration—using tables of integrals requires considerable thought and
insight and often involves substitution.
Each integration formula in Appendix B can be developed using one or more of the
techniques in this chapter. You should try to verify several of the formulas. For instance,
Formula 4
Formula 4
can be verified using the method of partial fractions, Formula 19

can be verified using integration by parts, and Formula 84

can be verified using substitution. Note that the integrals in Appendix B are classified
according to the form of the integrand. Several of the forms are listed below.

TECHNOLOGY A computer
algebra system consists, in part,
of a database of integration 
formulas. The primary 
difference between using a 
computer algebra system and
using tables of integrals is that
with a computer algebra system,
the computer searches through
the database to find a fit. With
integration tables, you must do
the searching.

8.7 Indeterminate Forms and L’Hôpital’s Rule
Recognize limits that produce indeterminate forms.
Apply L’Hôpital’s Rule to evaluate a limit.
Indeterminate Forms
Recall that the forms 
and 
are called indeterminate because they do not 
guarantee that a limit exists, nor do they indicate what the limit is, if one does exist.
When you encountered one of these indeterminate forms earlier in the text, you
attempted to rewrite the expression by using various algebraic techniques.
Indeterminate
Form
Limit
Algebraic Technique
Occasionally, you can extend these algebraic techniques to find limits of
transcendental functions. For instance, the limit
produces the indeterminate form 
Factoring and then dividing produces
Not all indeterminate forms, however, can be evaluated by algebraic manipulation. This
is often true when both algebraic and transcendental functions are involved. For
instance, the limit
produces the indeterminate form 
Rewriting the expression to obtain
merely produces another indeterminate form,
Of course, you could use 
technology to estimate the limit, as shown in the table and in Figure 8.15. From the
table and the graph, the limit appears to be 2. (This limit will be verified in Example 1.)

L’Hôpital’s Rule
To find the limit illustrated in Figure 8.15, you can use a theorem called L’Hôpital’s
Rule. This theorem states that under certain conditions, the limit of the quotient
is determined by the limit of the quotient of the derivatives
To prove this theorem, you can use a more general result called the Extended Mean
Value Theorem.
To see why Theorem 8.3 is called the Extended Mean Value Theorem, consider the
special case in which 
For this case, you obtain the “standard” Mean Value
Theorem as presented in Section 4.2.
People occasionally use L’Hôpital’s Rule incorrectly by applying the Quotient
Rule to 
Be sure you see that the rule involves
not the derivative of 
L’Hôpital’s Rule can also be applied to one-sided limits. For instance, if the limit
of 
as 
approaches 
from the right produces the indeterminate form 
then
provided the limit exists (or is infinite).

GUILLAUME L’HÔPITAL (1661–1704)
L’Hôpital’s Rule is named after the
French mathematician Guillaume
François Antoine de L’Hôpital.
L’Hôpital is credited with writing
the first text on differential 
calculus (in 1696) in which the
rule publicly appeared. It was
recently discovered that the rule
and its proof were written in a
letter from John Bernoulli to
L’Hôpital.“… I acknowledge that 
I owe very much to the bright
minds of the Bernoulli brothers.
… I have made free use of their
discoveries …,” said L’Hôpital.
See LarsonCalculus.com to read
more of this biography.

Indeterminate Form 
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution results in the indeterminate form 
you can apply L’Hôpital’s Rule, as shown below.
Apply L’Hôpital’s Rule.
Differentiate numerator and denominator.
Evaluate the limit.
In the solution to Example 1, note that you actually do not know that the first limit
is equal to the second limit until you have shown that the second limit exists. In other
words, if the second limit had not existed, then it would not have been permissible to
apply L’Hôpital’s Rule.
Another form of L’Hôpital’s Rule states that if the limit of 
as approaches
(or 
) produces the indeterminate form

Occasionally it is necessary to apply L’Hôpital’s Rule more than once to remove
an indeterminate form, as shown in Example 3.
Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule More than Once
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution results in the indeterminate form 
you
can apply L’Hôpital’s Rule.
This limit yields the indeterminate form 
so you can apply L’Hôpital’s
Rule again to obtain
In addition to the forms 
and 
there are other indeterminate forms such
as 
and 
For example, consider the following four limits
that lead to the indeterminate form 
Limit is 1.
Limit is 2.
Limit is 0.
Limit is 
Because each limit is different, it is clear that the form 
is indeterminate in the
sense that it does not determine the value (or even the existence) of the limit. The 
remaining examples in this section show methods for evaluating these forms. Basically,
you attempt to convert each of these forms to 
or 
so that L’Hôpital’s Rule can
be applied.
Indeterminate Form 
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution produces the indeterminate form 
you
should try to rewrite the limit to fit the form 
or 
In this case, you can rewrite
the limit to fit the second form.
Now, by L’Hôpital’s Rule, you have
Differentiate numerator and denominator.
Simplify.
Evaluate the limit.

When rewriting a limit in one of the forms 
or 
does not seem to work,
try the other form. For instance, in Example 4, you can write the limit as
which yields the indeterminate form 
As it happens, applying L’Hôpital’s Rule to
this limit produces
which also yields the indeterminate form 
The indeterminate forms 
and 
arise from limits of functions that have
variable bases and variable exponents. When you previously encountered this type of
function, you used logarithmic differentiation to find the derivative. You can use a
similar procedure when taking limits, as shown in the next example.
Indeterminate Form 
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution yields the indeterminate form 
you can 
proceed as follows. To begin, assume that the limit exists and is equal to 
Taking the natural logarithm of each side produces
Because the natural logarithmic function is continuous, you can write

TECHNOLOGY
When evaluating complicated limits such as the one in
Example 6, it is helpful to check the reasonableness of the solution with a graphing
utility. For instance, the calculations in the table and the graph in the figure (see
below) are consistent with the conclusion that 
approaches 1 as approaches
0 from the right.
Use a graphing utility to estimate the limits 
and 
Then
try to verify your estimates analytically.

Indeterminate Form 
Evaluate 
Solution
Because direct substitution yields the indeterminate form 
you
should try to rewrite the expression to produce a form to which you can apply
L’Hôpital’s Rule. In this case, you can combine the two fractions to obtain
Now, because direct substitution produces the indeterminate form 
you can apply
L’Hôpital’s Rule to obtain
This limit also yields the indeterminate form 
so you can apply L’Hôpital’s Rule
again to obtain
The forms 
and 
have been identified as
indeterminate. There are similar forms that you should recognize as “determinate.”
Limit is positive infinity.
Limit is negative infinity.
Limit is zero.
Limit is positive infinity.
(You are asked to verify two of these in Exercises 108 and 109.)
As a final comment, remember that L’Hôpital’s Rule can be applied only to
quotients leading to the indeterminate forms 
and 
For instance, the 
application of L’Hôpital’s Rule shown below is incorrect.
Incorrect use of L’Hôpital’s Rule
The reason this application is incorrect is that, even though the limit of the denominator
is 0, the limit of the numerator is 1, which means that the hypotheses of L’Hôpital’s Rule
have not been satisfied.

8.8 Improper Integrals
Evaluate an improper integral that has an infinite limit of integration.
Evaluate an improper integral that has an infinite discontinuity.
Improper Integrals with Infinite Limits of Integration
The definition of a definite integral
requires that the interval 
be finite. Furthermore, the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, by which you have been evaluating definite integrals, requires that 
be
continuous on 
In this section, you will study a procedure for evaluating integrals
that do not satisfy these requirements—usually because either one or both of the limits
of integration are infinite, or because has a finite number of infinite discontinuities 
in the interval 
Integrals that possess either property are improper integrals.
Note that a function is said to have an infinite discontinuity at when, from the right
or left,
or
To get an idea of how to evaluate an improper integral, consider the integral
which can be interpreted as the area of the shaded region shown in Figure 8.17. Taking
the limit as 
produces
This improper integral can be interpreted as the area of the unbounded region between
the graph of 
and the 
axis (to the right of

Sending a Space Module into Orbit
In Example 3 in Section 7.5, you found that it would require 10,000 mile-tons of work
to propel a 15-metric-ton space module to a height of 800 miles above Earth. How
much work is required to propel the module an unlimited distance away from Earth’s
surface?
Solution
At first you might think that an infinite amount of work would be required.
But if this were the case, it would be impossible to send rockets into outer space.
Because this has been done, the work required must be finite. You can determine the
work in the following manner. Using the integral in Example 3, Section 7.5, replace the
upper bound of 4800 miles by 
and write
mile-tons
foot-pounds.
In SI units, using a conversion factor of
1 foot-pound 
1.35582 joules
the work done is

An Improper Integral with an Infinite Discontinuity
Evaluate 
Solution
The integrand has an infinite 
discontinuity at 
as shown in Figure 8.23.
You can evaluate this integral as shown below.
An Improper Integral That Diverges
Evaluate 
Solution
Because the integrand has an infinite discontinuity at 
you can write
So, you can conclude that the improper integral diverges.
An Improper Integral with an Interior Discontinuity
Evaluate 
Solution
This integral is improper because the integrand has an infinite discontinuity at
the interior point 
as shown in Figure 8.24. So, you can write
From Example 7, you know that the second integral diverges. So, the original improper
integral also diverges.
Remember to check for infinite discontinuities at interior points as well as at 
endpoints when determining whether an integral is improper. For instance, if you had
not recognized that the integral in Example 8 was improper, you would have obtained
the incorrect result

To evaluate this integral, split it at a convenient point (say,
) and write
See Figure 8.25.
An Application Involving Arc Length
Use the formula for arc length to show that the circumference of the circle 
is 
Solution
To simplify the work, consider the quarter circle given by 
where 
The function 
is differentiable for any 
in this interval except
Therefore, the arc length of the quarter circle is given by the improper integral
This integral is improper because it has an infinite discontinuity at 
So, you can
write
Finally, multiplying by 4, you can conclude that the circumference of the circle is
as shown in Figure 8.26.

This section concludes with a useful theorem describing the convergence or 
divergence of a common type of improper integral. The proof of this theorem is left as
an exercise (see Exercise 49).
An Application Involving a Solid of Revolution
The solid formed by revolving (about the axis) the unbounded region lying between
the graph of 
and the 
axis 
is called Gabriel’s Horn. (See 
Figure 8.27.) Show that this solid has a finite volume and an infinite surface area.
Solution
Using the disk method and Theorem 8.5, you can determine the volume 
to be
Theorem 8.5,
The surface area is given by
Because
on the interval 
and the improper integral
diverges, you can conclude that the improper integral
also diverges. (See Exercise 52.) So, the surface area is infinite.
Gabriel’s Horn has a finite volume and an infinite surface area.

Sequences
In mathematics, the word “sequence” is used in much the same way as it is in ordinary
English. Saying that a collection of objects or events is in sequence usually means that
the collection is ordered in such a way that it has an identified first member, second
member, third member, and so on.
Mathematically, a sequence is defined as a function whose domain is the set of
positive integers. Although a sequence is a function, it is common to represent
sequences by subscript notation rather than by the standard function notation. For
instance, in the sequence
1,
2,
3,
4,
Sequence
1 is mapped onto 
2 is mapped onto 
and so on. The numbers
are the terms of the sequence. The number 
is the th term of the sequence, and the
entire sequence is denoted by 
Occasionally, it is convenient to begin a sequence
with 
so that the terms of the sequence become 
and the
domain is the set of nonnegative integers.

REMARK
Some sequences
are defined recursively. To
define a sequence recursively,
you need to be given one or
more of the first few terms. All
other terms of the sequence are
then defined using previous
terms, as shown in Example 1(d).

Limit of a Sequence
The primary focus of this chapter concerns sequences whose terms approach limiting
values. Such sequences are said to converge. For instance, the sequence 
converges to 0, as indicated in the next definition.
Graphically, this definition says that eventually (for 
and 
), the terms
of a sequence that converges to 
will lie within the band between the lines 
and 
as shown in Figure 9.1.
If a sequence 
agrees with a function at every positive integer, and if 
approaches a limit 
as 
then the sequence must converge to the same limit 
Finding the Limit of a Sequence
Find the limit of the sequence whose 
term is 
Solution
In Theorem 5.15, you learned that
So, you can apply Theorem 9.1 to conclude that
There are different ways in which a sequence can fail to have a limit. One way is
that the terms of the sequence increase without bound or decrease without bound. These
cases are written symbolically, as shown below.
Terms increase without bound:

graphing utility to graph the

that as approaches infinity,
the value of the function gets
closer and closer to 0. If you

The symbol

factorial”) is used to simplify some of the formulas
developed in this chapter. Let be a positive integer; then 
factorial is defined as

Another useful limit theorem that can be rewritten for sequences is the Squeeze

In Example 5, the sequence 
has both positive and negative terms. For this
sequence, it happens that the sequence of absolute values,
also converges to 0.
You can show this by the Squeeze Theorem using the inequality
In such cases, it is often convenient to consider the sequence of absolute values—and
then apply Theorem 9.4, which states that if the absolute value sequence converges to
0, then the original signed sequence also converges to 0.
Proof
Consider the two sequences 
and 
Because both of these
sequences converge to 0 and
you can use the Squeeze Theorem to conclude that 
converges to 0.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Pattern Recognition for Sequences
Sometimes the terms of a sequence are generated by some rule that does not
explicitly identify the 
term of the sequence. In such cases, you may be required to
discover a pattern in the sequence and to describe the 
term. Once the 
term has
been specified, you can investigate the convergence or divergence of the sequence.
Finding the nth Term of a Sequence
Find a sequence 
whose first five terms are
and then determine whether the sequence you have chosen converges or diverges.
Solution
First, note that the numerators are successive powers of 2, and the 
denominators form the sequence of positive odd integers. By comparing 
with 
you
have the following pattern.
Consider the function of a real variable 
Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule
produces
Next, apply Theorem 9.1 to conclude that
So, the sequence diverges.

Without a specific rule for generating the terms of a sequence or some knowledge
of the context in which the terms of the sequence are obtained, it is not possible to 
determine the convergence or divergence of the sequence merely from its first several
terms. For instance, although the first three terms of the following four sequences are
identical, the first two sequences converge to 0, the third sequence converges to 
and
the fourth sequence diverges.
The process of determining an 
term from the pattern observed in the first several
terms of a sequence is an example of inductive reasoning.
Finding the nth Term of a Sequence
Determine the 
term for a sequence whose first five terms are
and then decide whether the sequence converges or diverges.
Solution
Note that the numerators are 1 less than 
So, you can reason that the numerators are given by the rule
Factoring the denominators produces
and
This suggests that the denominators are represented by 
Finally, because the signs
alternate, you can write the 
term as
From the discussion about the growth of 
it follows that
Applying Theorem 9.4, you can conclude that
So, the sequence 
converges to 0.

Monotonic Sequences and Bounded Sequences
So far, you have determined the convergence of a sequence by finding its limit. Even
when you cannot determine the limit of a particular sequence, it still may be useful to
know whether the sequence converges. Theorem 9.5 (on the next page) provides a test
for convergence of sequences without determining the limit. First, some preliminary 
definitions are given.
Determining Whether a Sequence Is Monotonic
Determine whether each sequence having the given 
term is monotonic.
a.
b.
c.
Solution
a. This sequence alternates between 2 and 4. So, it is not monotonic.
b. This sequence is monotonic because each successive term is greater than its 
predecessor. To see this, compare the terms 
and 
[Note that, because 
is
positive, you can multiply each side of the inequality by 
and 
without reversing the inequality sign.]
Starting with the final inequality, which is valid, you can reverse the steps to
conclude that the original inequality is also valid.
c. This sequence is not monotonic, because the second term is greater than the first term,
and greater than the third. (Note that when you drop the first term, the remaining
sequence 
is monotonic.)
Figure 9.3 graphically illustrates these three sequences.
In Example 8(b), another way to see that the sequence is monotonic is to argue that
the derivative of the corresponding differentiable function
is positive for all 
This implies that is increasing, which in turn implies that 
is
increasing.

Note that all three sequences in Example 3 (and shown in Figure 9.3) are bounded.
To see this, note that
and
One important property of the real numbers is that they are complete.
Informally, this means that there are no holes or gaps on the real number line. (The set
of rational numbers does not have the completeness property.) The completeness axiom
for real numbers can be used to conclude that if a sequence has an upper bound, then 
it must have a least upper bound (an upper bound that is less than all other 
upper bounds for the sequence). For example, the least upper bound of the sequence
is 1. The completeness axiom is used in the proof of Theorem 9.5.
Proof
Assume that the sequence is nondecreasing, as shown in Figure 9.4. For the
sake of simplicity, also assume that each term in the sequence is positive. Because the
sequence is bounded, there must exist an upper bound 
such that
From the completeness axiom, it follows that there is a least upper bound 
such that
For 
it follows that 
and therefore 
cannot be an upper bound
for the sequence. Consequently, at least one term of 
is greater than 
That is,
for some positive integer 
Because the terms of 
are nondecreasing,
it follows that 
for 
You now know that 
for every 
It follows that

which by definition means that

The proof for a nonincreasing sequence is similar (see Exercise 91).
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Bounded and Monotonic Sequences
a. The sequence 
is both bounded and monotonic, and so, by Theorem 9.5,
it must converge.
b. The divergent sequence 
is monotonic, but not bounded. (It is
bounded below.)
c. The divergent sequence 
is bounded, but not monotonic.

Definition of Bounded Sequence
1. A sequence 
is bounded above when there is a real number 
such that
for all 
The number 
is called an upper bound of the sequence.
2. A sequence 
is bounded below when there is a real number 
such that
for all 
The number 
is called a lower bound of the sequence.
3. A sequence 
is bounded when it is bounded above and bounded below.

Series and Convergence
Understand the definition of a convergent infinite series.
Use properties of infinite geometric series.
Use the th-Term Test for Divergence of an infinite series.
Infinite Series
One important application of infinite sequences is in representing “infinite
summations.” Informally, if 
is an infinite sequence, then
Infinite Series
is an infinite series (or simply a series). The numbers 
and so on are the terms
of the series. For some series, it is convenient to begin the index at 
(or some other
integer). As a typesetting convention, it is common to represent an infinite series as
In such cases, the starting value for the index must be taken from the context of
the statement.
To find the sum of an infinite series, consider the sequence of partial sums listed
below.
If this sequence of partial sums converges, then the series is said to converge and has
the sum indicated in the next definition.
As you study this chapter, you will see that there are two basic questions involving
infinite series.
• Does a series converge or does it diverge?
• When a series converges, what is its sum?
These questions are not always easy to answer, especially the second one.

INFINITE SERIES
The study of infinite series was
considered a novelty in the 
fourteenth century. Logician
Richard Suiseth, whose nickname
was Calculator, solved this 
problem.
If throughout the first half of 
a given time interval a variation 
continues at a certain intensity,
throughout the next quarter of 
the interval at double the intensity,
throughout the following eighth 
at triple the intensity and so ad 
infinitum; then the average intensity for
the whole interval will be the intensity
of the variation during the second
subinterval (or double the intensity).
This is the same as saying that the
sum of the infinite series
is 2.

series geometrically, as shown in Figure 9.6.)
Because
it follows that the series converges and its sum is 1.
b. The 
partial sum of the series
is
Because the limit of 
is 1, the series converges and its sum is 1.
c. The series

and the sequence of partial sums diverges.
The series in Example 1(b) is a telescoping series of the form
Telescoping series
Note that 
is canceled by the second term,

Convergent and Divergent Geometric Series
a. The geometric series
has a ratio of 
with 
Because 
the series converges and its
sum is 
b. The geometric series
has a ratio of 
Because 
the series diverges.
The formula for the sum of a geometric series can be used to write a repeating 
decimal as the ratio of two integers, as demonstrated in the next example.
A Geometric Series for a Repeating Decimal
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Use a geometric series to write 
as the ratio of two integers.
Solution
For the repeating decimal 
you can write
For this series, you have 
and 
So,
Try dividing 8 by 99 on a calculator to see that it produces 
The convergence of a series is not affected by the removal of a finite number of
terms from the beginning of the series. For instance, the geometric series
and
both converge. Furthermore, because the sum of the second series is 
you can conclude that the sum of the first series is

The properties in the next theorem are direct consequences of the corresponding
properties of limits of sequences.
th-Term Test for Divergence
The next theorem states that when a series converges, the limit of its 
term must be 0.
Proof
Assume that
Then, because 
and
it follows that
which implies that 
converges to 0.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The contrapositive of Theorem 9.8 provides a useful test for divergence. This
nth-Term Test for Divergence states that if the limit of the 
term of a series does
not converge to 0, then the series must diverge.

Bouncing Ball Problem
A ball is dropped from a height of 6 feet and begins bouncing, as shown in Figure 9.7.
The height of each bounce is three-fourths the height of the previous bounce. Find the
total vertical distance traveled by the ball.
Solution
When the ball hits the ground for the first time, it has traveled a distance
of 
feet. For subsequent bounces, let 
be the distance traveled up and down.
For example,
and 
are
Up
Down
and
Up
Down
By continuing this process, it can be determined that the total vertical distance is
  42 feet.

9.3
The Integral Test and p-Series
Use the Integral Test to determine whether an infinite series converges or diverges.
Use properties of -series and harmonic series.
The Integral Test
In this and the next section, you will study several convergence tests that apply to series
with positive terms.
Proof
Begin by partitioning the interval 
into 
unit intervals, as shown
in Figure 9.8. The total areas of the inscribed rectangles and the circumscribed
rectangles are
Inscribed area
and
Circumscribed area
The exact area under the graph of from 
to 
lies between the inscribed and
circumscribed areas.
Using the 
partial sum,
you can write this
inequality as
Now, assuming that 
converges to 
it follows that for 
Consequently,
is bounded and monotonic, and by Theorem 9.5 it converges. So,
converges. For the other direction of the proof, assume that the improper integral
diverges. Then 
approaches infinity as 
and the inequality
implies that 
diverges. So,
diverges.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Remember that the convergence or divergence of 
is not affected by deleting
the first 
terms. Similarly, when the conditions for the Integral Test are satisfied for all
you can simply use the integral 
to test for convergence or 
divergence. (This is illustrated in Example 4.)

You can integrate to obtain
So, the series diverges.

Because

So, the series converges (see Figure 9.9).
In Example 2, the fact that the improper integral converges to

-Series and Harmonic Series
In the remainder of this section, you will investigate a second type of series that has a
simple arithmetic test for convergence or divergence. A series of the form
-series
is a p-series, where is a positive constant. For 
the series
Harmonic series
is the harmonic series. A general harmonic series is of the form 
In
music, strings of the same material, diameter, and tension, and whose lengths form a
harmonic series, produce harmonic tones.
The Integral Test is convenient for establishing the convergence or divergence of
series. This is shown in the proof of Theorem 9.11.
Proof
The proof follows from the Integral Test and from Theorem 8.5, which states
that
converges for 
and diverges for 
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.

Discuss the convergence or divergence of (a) the harmonic series and (b) the 
series
with 
Solution
a. From Theorem 9.11, it follows that the harmonic series
diverges.
b. From Theorem 9.11, it follows that the

HARMONIC SERIES
Pythagoras and his students 
paid close attention to the 
development of music as an
abstract science.This led to the
discovery of the relationship
between the tone and the length
of a vibrating string. It was
observed that the most beautiful
musical harmonies corresponded
to the simplest ratios of whole
numbers. Later mathematicians
developed this idea into the 
harmonic series, where the terms
in the harmonic series correspond
to the nodes on a vibrating string
that produce multiples of the 
fundamental frequency. For example,
is twice the fundamental
frequency,
is three times the 
fundamental frequency, and so on.

The sum of the series in Example 3(b) can be shown to be 
(This was proved
by Leonhard Euler, but the proof is too difficult to present here.) Be sure you see that
the Integral Test does not tell you that the sum of the series is equal to the value of the
integral. For instance, the sum of the series in Example 3(b) is 
whereas the value of the corresponding improper integral is
Testing a Series for Convergence
Determine whether the series
converges or diverges.
Solution
This series is similar to the divergent harmonic series. If its terms were 
greater than those of the harmonic series, you would expect it to diverge. However,
because its terms are less than those of the harmonic series, you are not sure what to
expect. The function
is positive and continuous for 
To determine whether is decreasing, first rewrite
as
and then find its derivative.
So,
for 
and it follows that satisfies the conditions for the Integral Test.
The series diverges.
Note that the infinite series in Example 4 diverges very slowly. For instance, as
shown in the table, the sum of the first 10 terms is approximately 1.6878196, whereas
the sum of the first 100 terms is just slightly greater: 2.3250871. In fact, the sum of the
first 10,000 terms is approximately 3.0150217. You can see that although the infinite
series “adds up to infinity,” it does so very slowly.

The harmonic series
is one of the most important series in this chapter. Even though its
terms tend to zero as increases,
the harmonic series diverges. In other words, even though the terms
are getting smaller and smaller, the sum “adds up to infinity.”
(a) One way to show that the harmonic series diverges is attributed
to James Bernoulli. He grouped the terms of the harmonic
series as follows:
Write a short paragraph explaining how you can use this
grouping to show that the harmonic series diverges.

Comparisons of Series
Use the Direct Comparison Test to determine whether a series converges or
diverges.
Use the Limit Comparison Test to determine whether a series converges or
diverges.
Direct Comparison Test
For the convergence tests developed so far, the terms of the series have to be fairly
simple and the series must have special characteristics in order for the convergence tests
to be applied. A slight deviation from these special characteristics can make a test 
nonapplicable. For example, in the pairs listed below, the second series cannot be tested
by the same convergence test as the first series, even though it is similar to the first.

is geometric, but 
is not.
2.

series, but

3.
is easily integrated, but 
is not.
In this section, you will study two additional tests for positive-term series. These two
tests greatly expand the variety of series you are able to test for convergence or
divergence. They allow you to compare a series having complicated terms with a
simpler series whose convergence or divergence is known.
Proof
To prove the first property, let 
and let
Because 
the sequence 
is nondecreasing and bounded
above by 
so, it must converge. Because
it follows that 
converges. The second property is logically equivalent to the first.

term comparison reveals a series that is less than a divergent series, the Direct
Comparison Test tells you nothing.) Still expecting the series to diverge, you can
compare the series with
Divergent harmonic series
In this case, term-by-term comparison yields
and, by the Direct Comparison Test, the given series diverges. To verify the last 
inequality, try showing that
whenever 
Remember that both parts of the Direct Comparison Test require that 
Informally, the test says the following about the two series with nonnegative terms.
1. If the “larger” series converges, then the “smaller” series must also converge.
2. If the “smaller” series diverges, then the “larger” series must also diverge.

Limit Comparison Test
Sometimes a series closely resembles a 
series or a geometric series, yet you cannot
establish the term-by-term comparison necessary to apply the Direct Comparison Test.
Under these circumstances, you may be able to apply a second comparison test, called
the Limit Comparison Test.
Proof
Because 
and 
there exists 
such that
for 
This implies that
So, by the Direct Comparison Test, the convergence of 
implies the convergence of
Similarly, the fact that
can be used to show that the convergence of 
implies the convergence of 
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Using the Limit Comparison Test
Show that the general harmonic series below diverges.
Solution
By comparison with
Divergent harmonic series
you have
Because this limit is greater than 0, you can conclude from the Limit Comparison Test
that the series diverges.

The Limit Comparison Test works well for comparing a “messy” algebraic series
with a 
series. In choosing an appropriate 
series, you must choose one with an 
term of the same magnitude as the 
term of the given series.
Given Series
Comparison Series
Conclusion
Both series converge.
Both series diverge.
Both series converge.
In other words, when choosing a series for comparison, you can disregard all but the
highest powers of 
in both the numerator and the denominator.

Most wines are produced entirely from grapes grown in a single
year. Sherry, however, is a complex mixture of older wines with
new wines. This is done with a sequence of barrels (called a solera)
stacked on top of each other, as shown in the photo.
The oldest wine is in the bottom tier of barrels, and the newest is
in the top tier. Each year, half of each barrel in the bottom tier is
bottled as sherry. The bottom barrels are then refilled with the wine
from the barrels above. This process is repeated throughout the 
solera, with new wine being added to the top barrels.
A mathematical model for the amount of 
year-old wine that is
removed from a solera (with tiers) each year is
(a) Consider a solera that has five tiers, numbered 
2, 3, 4,
and 5. In 1995 
, half of each barrel in the top tier (tier 1)
was refilled with new wine. How much of this wine was
removed from the solera in 1996? In 1997? In 1998? .  .  . In
2010? During which year(s) was the greatest amount of the
1995 wine removed from the solera?
(b) In part (a), let 
be the amount of 1995 wine that is removed
from the solera in year

Alternating Series
Use the Alternating Series Test to determine whether an infinite series converges.
Use the Alternating Series Remainder to approximate the sum of an alternating
series.
Classify a convergent series as absolutely or conditionally convergent.
Rearrange an infinite series to obtain a different sum.
Alternating Series
So far, most series you have dealt with have had positive terms. In this section and the
next section, you will study series that contain both positive and negative terms. The
simplest such series is an alternating series, whose terms alternate in sign. For example,
the geometric series
is an alternating geometric series with 
Alternating series occur in two ways:
either the odd terms are negative or the even terms are negative.
Proof
Consider the alternating series 
For this series, the partial sum
(where 
is even)
has all nonnegative terms, and therefore 
is a nondecreasing sequence. But you can
also write
which implies that 
for every integer 
So,
is a bounded, nondecreasing
sequence that converges to some value 
Because 
and 
you have
Because both 
and 
converge to the same limit 
it follows that 
also
converges to 
Consequently, the given alternating series converges.

the sum 
of the series. The error involved in using

Approximating the Sum of an Alternating Series
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Approximate the sum of the series by its first six terms.
Solution
The series converges by the Alternating Series Test because
and
The sum of the first six terms is

So, the sum 
lies between

Finding the Number of Terms
Determine the number of terms required to approximate the sum of the series with an
error of less than 0.001.
Solution
By Theorem 9.15, you know that 
For an error of less than 0.001,
must satisfy the inequality 
So, you will need at least 5 terms. Using 5 terms, the sum is 
which
has an error of less than 0.001.

Absolute and Conditional Convergence
Occasionally, a series may have both positive and negative terms and not be an
alternating series. For instance, the series
has both positive and negative terms, yet it is not an alternating series. One way to
obtain some information about the convergence of this series is to investigate the
convergence of the series
By direct comparison, you have 
for all 
so
Therefore, by the Direct Comparison Test, the series 
converges. The next 
theorem tells you that the original series also converges.
Proof
Because 
for all 
the series
converges by comparison with the convergent series
Furthermore, because 
you can write
where both series on the right converge. So, it follows that 
converges.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The converse of Theorem 9.16 is not true. For instance, the alternating harmonic
series
converges by the Alternating Series Test. Yet the harmonic series diverges. This type of
convergence is called conditional.

a.
b.
Solution
a. This is an alternating series, but the Alternating Series Test does not apply because
the limit of the th term is not zero. By the 
Term Test for Divergence, however,
you can conclude that this series diverges.
b. This series can be shown to be convergent by the Alternating Series Test. Moreover,
because the

Consequently, by Theorem 9.16, you can conclude that the given series is absolutely

b. In this case, the Alternating Series Test indicates that the series converges. However,
the series

Rearrangement of Series
A finite sum such as
can be rearranged without changing the value of the sum. This is not necessarily true of
an infinite series––it depends on whether the series is absolutely convergent or 
conditionally convergent.
1. If a series is absolutely convergent, then its terms can be rearranged in any order
without changing the sum of the series.
2. If a series is conditionally convergent, then its terms can be rearranged to give a 
different sum.
The second case is illustrated in Example 8.
Rearrangement of a Series
The alternating harmonic series converges to 
That is,
(See Exercise 55, Section 9.10.) 
Rearrange the series to produce a different sum.
Solution
Consider the rearrangement below.
By rearranging the terms, you obtain a sum that is half the original sum.

The Ratio and Root Tests

Use the Root Test to determine whether a series converges or diverges.
Review the tests for convergence and divergence of an infinite series.
The Ratio Test
This section begins with a test for absolute convergence—the Ratio Test.
Proof
To prove Property 1, assume that
and choose 
such that 
By the definition of the limit of a sequence,
there exists some 
such that 
for all 
Therefore, you can
write the following inequalities.
The geometric series 
converges,
and so, by the Direct Comparison Test, the series
also converges. This in turn implies that the series 
converges, because discarding
a finite number of terms 
does not affect convergence. Consequently, by
Theorem 9.16, the series 
converges absolutely. The proof of Property 2 is similar
and is left as an exercise (see Exercise 99).
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The fact that the Ratio Test is inconclusive when 
can be seen by 
comparing the two series 
and 
The first series diverges and the second
one converges, but in both cases

A Failure of the Ratio Test
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Determine the convergence or divergence of
Solution
The limit of 
is equal to 1.
So, the Ratio Test is inconclusive. To determine whether the series converges, you need
to try a different test. In this case, you can apply the Alternating Series Test. To show
that 
let
Then the derivative is
Because the derivative is negative for 
you know that is a decreasing function.
Also, by L’Hôpital’s Rule,
Therefore, by the Alternating Series Test, the series converges.
The series in Example 3 is conditionally convergent. This follows from the fact that
the series
diverges by the Limit Comparison Test with 
but the series
converges.

The Root Test
The next test for convergence or divergence of series works especially well for series
involving 
powers. The proof of this theorem is similar to the proof given for the
Ratio Test, and is left as an exercise (see Exercise 100).
Using the Root Test
Determine the convergence or divergence of
Solution
You can apply the Root Test as follows.
Because this limit is less than 1, you can conclude that the series converges absolutely
(and therefore converges).
To see the usefulness of the Root Test for the series in Example 4, try applying the
Ratio Test to that series. When you do this, you obtain the following.
Note that this limit is not as easily evaluated as the limit obtained by the Root Test in
Example 4.

Strategies for Testing Series
You have now studied 10 tests for determining the convergence or divergence of an 
infinite series. (See the summary in the table on the next page.) Skill in choosing and
applying the various tests will come only with practice. Below is a set of guidelines for
choosing an appropriate test.
In some instances, more than one test is applicable. However, your objective should be
to learn to choose the most efficient test.
Applying the Strategies for Testing Series
Determine the convergence or divergence of each series.
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.
Solution
a. For this series, the limit of the 
term is not 0 
as 
So, by the 
Term Test, the series diverges.
b. This series is geometric. Moreover, because the ratio of the terms
is less than 1 in absolute value, you can conclude that the series converges.
c. Because the function
is easily integrated, you can use the Integral Test to conclude that the series converges.
d. The 
term of this series can be compared to the th term of the harmonic series.
After using the Limit Comparison Test, you can conclude that the series diverges.
e. This is an alternating series whose 
term approaches 0. Because 
you
can use the Alternating Series Test to conclude that the series converges.
f. The 
term of this series involves a factorial, which indicates that the Ratio Test
may work well. After applying the Ratio Test, you can conclude that the series
diverges.
g. The 
term of this series involves a variable that is raised to the 
power, which
indicates that the Root Test may work well. After applying the Root Test, you can
conclude that the series converges.

GUIDELINES FOR TESTING A SERIES FOR CONVERGENCE OR
DIVERGENCE
1. Does the 
term approach 0? If not, the series diverges.
2. Is the series one of the special types—geometric,
series, telescoping, or
alternating?
3. Can the Integral Test, the Root Test, or the Ratio Test be applied?
4. Can the series be compared favorably to one of the special types?

the elementary functions.
Find Taylor and Maclaurin polynomial approximations of elementary functions.
Use the remainder of a Taylor polynomial.
Polynomial Approximations of Elementary Functions
The goal of this section is to show how polynomial functions can be used as
approximations for other elementary functions. To find a polynomial function 
that
approximates another function 
begin by choosing a number 
in the domain of at
which and 
have the same value. That is,
Graphs of and 
pass through 
The approximating polynomial is said to be expanded about
or centered at 
Geometrically, the requirement that 
means that the graph of 
passes
through the point 
Of course, there are many polynomials whose graphs pass
through the point 
Your task is to find a polynomial whose graph resembles the
graph of near this point. One way to do this is to impose the additional requirement
that the slope of the polynomial function be the same as the slope of the graph of at
the point 
Graphs of and 
have the same slope at 
With these two requirements, you can obtain a simple linear approximation of 
as
shown in Figure 9.10.
First-Degree Polynomial Approximation of 
For the function 
find a first-degree polynomial function 
whose value and slope agree with the value and slope of at 
Solution
Because 
and 
the value and the slope of at 
are 
Value of at

Slope of at

you can use the condition that 
to conclude that
Moreover, because 
you can use the condition that

Example 1 is not
the first time you have used a
linear function to approximate
another function. The same 
procedure was used as the basis
for Newton’s Method.

In Figure 9.12, you can see that, at points near 
the graph of the first-degree
polynomial function
1st-degree approximation
is reasonably close to the graph of 
As you move away from 
however,
the graphs move farther and farther from each other and the accuracy of the 
approximation decreases. To improve the approximation, you can impose yet another
requirement—that the values of the second derivatives of 
and agree when 
The polynomial,
of least degree that satisfies all three requirements 
and 
can be shown to be
2nd-degree approximation
Moreover, in Figure 9.12, you can see that 
is a better approximation of than 
By
requiring that the values of 
and its first 
derivatives match those of

Third-Degree Polynomial Approximation of 
Construct a table comparing the values of the polynomial

with 
for several values of near 0.
Solution
Using a calculator or a computer, you can obtain the results shown in the
table. Note that for 
the two functions have the same value, but that as moves
farther away from 0, the accuracy of the approximating polynomial 
decreases.

Taylor polynomials and Maclaurin polynomials can be used to approximate the
value of a function at a specific point. For instance, to approximate the value of 
you can use Taylor polynomials for 
expanded about 
as shown in
Example 4, or you can use Maclaurin polynomials, as shown in Example 7.
Approximation Using Maclaurin Polynomials
Use a fourth Maclaurin polynomial to approximate the value of 
Solution
Because 1.1 is closer to 1 than to 0, you should consider Maclaurin
polynomials for the function 
Note that you obtain the same coefficients as in Example 4. Therefore, the fourth
Maclaurin polynomial for

Fourth Maclaurin Polynomial Approximation of 
These two tables illustrate two very important points about the accuracy of Taylor
(or Maclaurin) polynomials for use in approximations.
1. The approximation is usually better for higher-degree Taylor (or Maclaurin)
polynomials than for those of lower degree.
2. The approximation is usually better at values close to than at values far from c.

Remainder of a Taylor Polynomial
An approximation technique is of little value without some idea of its accuracy. To
measure the accuracy of approximating a function value 
by the Taylor polynomial
you can use the concept of a remainder
defined as follows.
So,
The absolute value of 
is called the error associated
with the approximation. That is,
The next theorem gives a general procedure for estimating the remainder
associated with a Taylor polynomial. This important theorem is called Taylor’s
Theorem, and the remainder given in the theorem is called the Lagrange form of the
remainder.
One useful consequence of Taylor’s Theorem is that
max 
where 
is the maximum value of 
between and 
For 
Taylor’s Theorem states that if 
is differentiable in an interval 
containing 
then, for each in 
there exists between and such that
or
Do you recognize this special case of Taylor’s Theorem? (It is the Mean Value
Theorem.)
When applying Taylor’s Theorem, you should not expect to be able to find the
exact value of 
(If you could do this, an approximation would not be necessary.)
Rather, you are trying to find bounds for 
from which you are able to tell how
large the remainder 
is.

Power Series
In Section 9.7, you were introduced to the concept of approximating functions by
Taylor polynomials. For instance, the function 
can be approximated by its
third-degree Maclaurin polynomial
In that section, you saw that the higher the degree of the approximating polynomial, the
better the approximation becomes.
In this and the next two sections, you will see that several important types of
functions, including 
can be represented exactly by an infinite series called a
power series. For example, the power series representation for 
is
For each real number 
it can be shown that the infinite series on the right converges to
the number 
Before doing this, however, some preliminary results dealing with power
series will be discussed—beginning with the next definition.

Radius and Interval of Convergence
A power series in can be viewed as a function of 
where the domain of
is the set of all 
for which the power series converges.
Determination of the domain of a power series is the primary concern in this section.
Of course, every power series converges at its center because
So,
always lies in the domain of 
Theorem 9.20 (see below) states that the domain
of a power series can take three basic forms: a single point, an interval centered at 
or
the entire real number line, as shown in Figure 9.17.
The domain of a power series has only three 
basic forms: a single point, an interval centered

THEOREM 9.20
Convergence of a Power Series
For a power series centered at 
precisely one of the following is true.
1. The series converges only at 
2. There exists a real number 
such that the series converges absolutely 
for
and diverges for
3. The series converges absolutely for all 
The number 
is the radius of convergence of the power series. If the series 
converges only at 
then the radius of convergence is 
If the series
converges for all 
then the radius of convergence is 
The set of all 
values of for which the power series converges is the interval of convergence
of the power series.
A proof of this theorem is given in Appendix A.

Endpoint Convergence
Note that for a power series whose radius of convergence is a finite number 
Theorem 9.20
says nothing about the convergence at the endpoints of the interval of convergence.
Each endpoint must be tested separately for convergence or divergence. As a result, the
interval of convergence of a power series can take any one of the six forms shown in
Figure 9.18.
Intervals of convergence

Finding the Interval of Convergence
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Find the interval of convergence of
Solution
Letting 
produces
So, by the Ratio Test, the radius of convergence is 
Moreover, because the series
is centered at 0,
it converges in the interval 
This interval,
however, is not necessarily the interval of convergence. To determine this, you must test
for convergence at each endpoint. When 
you obtain the divergent harmonic
series
Diverges when
When 
you obtain the convergent alternating harmonic series
Converges when
So, the interval of convergence for the series is 
as shown in Figure 9.19.

Differentiation and Integration of Power Series
Power series representation of functions has played an important role in the 
development of calculus. In fact, much of Newton’s work with differentiation and 
integration was done in the context of power series—especially his work with 
complicated algebraic functions and transcendental functions. Euler, Lagrange,
Leibniz, and the Bernoullis all used power series extensively in calculus.
Once you have defined a function with a power series, it is natural to wonder how
you can determine the characteristics of the function. Is it continuous? Differentiable?
Theorem 9.21, which is stated without proof, answers these questions.
Theorem 9.21 states that, in many ways, a function defined by a power series
behaves like a polynomial. It is continuous in its interval of convergence, and both its
derivative and its antiderivative can be determined by differentiating and integrating
each term of the power series. For instance, the derivative of the power series 
is
Notice that

The radius of convergence of the series obtained by differentiating or integrating 
a power series is the same as that of the original power series. The interval of 
convergence, however, may differ as a result of the behavior at the endpoints.

JAMES GREGORY (1638–1675)
One of the earliest mathematicians
to work with power series was a
Scotsman, James Gregory. He
developed a power series method
for interpolating table values––a
method that was later used by
Brook Taylor in the development
of Taylor polynomials and Taylor
series.

From Example 8, it appears that of the three series, the one for the derivative,
is the least likely to converge at the endpoints. In fact, it can be shown that if the series
for 
converges at the endpoints 
then the series for 
will also converge there.

JOSEPH FOURIER (1768–1830)
Some of the early work in 
representing functions by power
series was done by the French
mathematician Joseph Fourier.
Fourier’s work is important in the
history of calculus, partly because
it forced eighteenth-century 
mathematicians to question the
then-prevailing narrow concept 
of a function. Both Cauchy and
Dirichlet were motivated by
Fourier’s work with series, and 
in 1837 Dirichlet published the 
general definition of a function
that is used today.

Operations with Power Series
The versatility of geometric power series will be shown later in this section, following
a discussion of power series operations. These operations, used with differentiation and
integration, provide a means of developing power series for a variety of elementary
functions. (For simplicity, the operations are stated for a series centered at 0.)
The operations described above can change the interval of convergence for the
resulting series. For example, in the addition shown below, the interval of convergence
for the sum is the intersection of the intervals of convergence of the two original series.
Adding Two Power Series
Find a power series for
centered at 0.
Solution
Using partial fractions, you can write 
as
By adding the two geometric power series
and
you obtain the power series shown below.
The interval of convergence for this power series is 1, 1.

Finding a Power Series by Integration
Find a power series for

Solution
From Example 2, you know that
Interval of convergence:
Integrating this series produces
By letting 
you can conclude that 
Therefore,
Note that the series converges at 
This is consistent with the observation in the
preceding section that integration of a power series may alter the convergence at the
endpoints of the interval of convergence.
In Section 9.7, Example 4, the fourth-degree Taylor polynomial for the natural 
logarithmic function
was used to approximate 
You now know from Example 4 in this section that this polynomial represents the first
four terms of the power series for 
Moreover, using the Alternating Series
Remainder, you can determine that the error in this approximation is less than
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, mathematical tables for logarithms
and values of other transcendental functions were computed in this manner. Such
numerical techniques are far from outdated, because it is precisely by such means that
many modern calculating devices are programmed to evaluate transcendental functions.

Find a power series for
centered at 0.
Solution
Because 
you can use the series
Interval of convergence:
Substituting 
for produces
Finally, by integrating, you obtain
Let 
then 
Interval of convergence:
It can be shown that the power series developed for 
in Example 5 also 
converges (to 
) for 
For instance, when 
you can write
However, this series (developed by James Gregory in 1671) does not give us a 
practical way of approximating 
because it converges so slowly that hundreds of terms
would have to be used to obtain reasonable accuracy. Example 6 shows how to use two
different arctangent series to obtain a very good approximation of 
using only a few
terms. This approximation was developed by John Machin in 1706.
Approximating 
with a Series
Use the trigonometric identity
to approximate the number 
[see Exercise 46(b)].
Solution
By using only five terms from each of the series for 
and
you obtain
which agrees with the exact value of 
with an error of less than 0.0000001.

Taylor Series and Maclaurin Series
In Section 9.9, you derived power series for several functions using geometric series
with term-by-term differentiation or integration. In this section, you will study a 
general procedure for deriving the power series for a function that has derivatives of all
orders. The next theorem gives the form that every convergent power series must take.
Proof
Consider a power series 
that has a radius of convergence 
Then,
by Theorem 9.21, you know that the 
derivative of exists for 
and by
successive differentiation you obtain the following.
Evaluating each of these derivatives at 
yields
and, in general,
By solving for 
you find that the coefficients of the
power series representation of 
are
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Notice that the coefficients of the power series in Theorem 9.22 are precisely the
coefficients of the Taylor polynomials for 
at 
as defined in Section 9.7. For this
reason, the series is called the Taylor series for

COLIN MACLAURIN (1698–1746)
The development of power series
to represent functions is credited
to the combined work of many
seventeenth- and eighteenth-
century mathematicians. Gregory,
Newton, John and James Bernoulli,
Leibniz, Euler, Lagrange,Wallis, and
Fourier all contributed to this
work. However, the two names
that are most commonly associated
with power series are Brook
Taylor (1685–1731) and Colin
Maclaurin.

When you know the pattern for the coefficients of the Taylor polynomials for a
function, you can extend the pattern easily to form the corresponding Taylor series. For
instance, in Example 4 in Section 9.7, you found the fourth Taylor polynomial for 
centered at 1, to be
From this pattern, you can obtain the Taylor series for 
centered at 
Forming a Power Series
Use the function
to form the Maclaurin series
and determine the interval of convergence.
Solution
Successive differentiation of 
yields
and so on. The pattern repeats after the third derivative. So, the power series is as
follows.
By the Ratio Test, you can conclude that this series converges for all x.

Notice that in Example 1, you cannot conclude that the power series converges to
for all 
You can simply conclude that the power series converges to some
function, but you are not sure what function it is. This is a subtle, but important, point
in dealing with Taylor or Maclaurin series. To persuade yourself that the series
might converge to a function other than 
remember that the derivatives are being 
evaluated at a single point. It can easily happen that another function will agree with the
values of 
when 
and disagree at other 
values. For instance, the power
series (centered at 0) for the function shown in Figure 9.23 is the same series as in
Example 1. You know that the series converges for all 
and yet it obviously cannot
converge to both 
and 
for all 
Let have derivatives of all orders in an open interval centered at 
The Taylor

Or, even when it is convergent, it may
fail to have

then the next 
theorem tells us that the Taylor series for actually converges to

For a Taylor series, the

The guidelines for finding a Taylor series for

The direct determination of Taylor or Maclaurin coefficients using successive
differentiation can be difficult, and the next example illustrates a shortcut for finding
the coefficients indirectly—using the coefficients of a known Taylor or Maclaurin
series.
Maclaurin Series for a Composite Function
Find the Maclaurin series for
Solution
To find the coefficients for this Maclaurin series directly, you must
calculate successive derivatives of 
By calculating just the first two,
and
you can see that this task would be quite cumbersome. Fortunately, there is an
alternative. First, consider the Maclaurin series for sin found in Example 1.
Now, because 
you can substitute 
for in the series for 
to obtain
Be sure to understand the point illustrated in Example 3. Because direct
computation of Taylor or Maclaurin coefficients can be tedious, the most practical way
to find a Taylor or Maclaurin series is to develop power series for a basic list of elementary
functions. From this list, you can determine power series for other functions by the
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, integration,
and composition with known power series.

REMARK
When you have
difficulty recognizing a pattern,
remember that you can use
Theorem 9.22 to find the Taylor
series. Also, you can try using
the coefficients of a known
Taylor or Maclaurin series,
as shown in Example 3.

Binomial Series
Before presenting the basic list for elementary functions, you will develop one more
series—for a function of the form 
This produces the binomial series.
Binomial Series
Find the Maclaurin series for 
and determine its radius of convergence.
Assume that is not a positive integer and 
Solution
By successive differentiation, you have
which produces the series
Because 
you can apply the Ratio Test to conclude that the radius of
convergence is 
So, the series converges to some function in the interval
Note that Example 4 shows that the Taylor series for 
converges to some
function in the interval 
However, the example does not show that the series
actually converges to 
To do this, you could show that the remainder 
converges to 0, as illustrated in Example 2. You now have enough information to find a
binomial series for a function, as shown in the next example.

1. Cantor Set
The Cantor set (Georg Cantor, 1845–1918) is a
subset of the unit interval 
To construct the Cantor set,
first remove the middle third 
of the interval, leaving two
line segments. For the second step, remove the middle third of
each of the two remaining segments, leaving four line segments.

Conic Sections
Each conic section (or simply conic) can be described as the intersection of a plane and
a double-napped cone. Notice in Figure 10.1 that for the four basic conics, the intersecting
plane does not pass through the vertex of the cone. When the plane passes through the
vertex, the resulting figure is a degenerate conic, as shown in Figure 10.2.

There are several ways to study conics. You could begin as the Greeks did, by 
defining the conics in terms of the intersections of planes and cones, or you could define
them algebraically in terms of the general second-degree equation
General second-degree equation
However, a third approach, in which each of the conics is defined as a locus (collection)
of points satisfying a certain geometric property, works best. For example, a circle can
be defined as the collection of all points 
that are equidistant from a fixed point
This locus definition easily produces the standard equation of a circle

HYPATIA (370–415 A.D.)
The Greeks discovered conic 
sections sometime between 600
and 300 B.C. By the beginning of
the Alexandrian period, enough
was known about conics for
Apollonius (262–190 B.C.) to 
produce an eight-volume work on
the subject. Later, toward the end
of the Alexandrian period, Hypatia
wrote a textbook entitled On the
Conics of Apollonius. Her death
marked the end of major 
mathematical discoveries in
Europe for several hundred years.
The early Greeks were largely
concerned with the geometric
properties of conics. It was not
until 1900 years later, in the early
seventeenth century, that the
broader applicability of conics
became apparent. Conics then
played a prominent role in the
development of calculus.
See LarsonCalculus.com to read
more of this biography.

mathematical activities of Hypatia,

Mathematics” by Michael A. B.

Mathematical Monthly. To view

Parabolas
A parabola is the set of all points 
that are equidistant from a fixed line, the 
directrix, and a fixed point, the focus, not on the line. The midpoint between the focus
and the directrix is the vertex, and the line passing through the focus and the vertex is
the axis of the parabola. Note in Figure 10.3 that a parabola is symmetric with respect
to its axis.

To find the focus, convert to standard form by completing the square.

is negative, the parabola opens downward, as shown in Figure 10.4. So, the

A line segment that passes through the focus of a parabola and has endpoints on
the parabola is called a focal chord. The specific focal chord perpendicular to the axis
of the parabola is the latus rectum. The next example shows how to determine the
length of the latus rectum and the length of the corresponding intercepted arc.

Theorem 8.2
One widely used property of a parabola is its reflective property. In physics, a
surface is called reflective when the tangent line at any point on the surface makes equal
angles with an incoming ray and the resulting outgoing ray. The angle corresponding 
to the incoming ray is the angle of incidence, and the angle corresponding to the 
outgoing ray is the angle of reflection. One example of a reflective surface is a flat 
mirror.
Another type of reflective surface is that formed by revolving a parabola about its
axis. The resulting surface has the property that all incoming rays parallel to the axis
are directed through the focus of the parabola. This is the principle behind the design
of the parabolic mirrors used in reflecting telescopes. Conversely, all light rays emanating
from the focus of a parabolic reflector used in a flashlight are parallel, as shown in
Figure 10.6.

Ellipses
More than a thousand years after the close of the Alexandrian period of Greek
mathematics, Western civilization finally began a Renaissance of mathematical and 
scientific discovery. One of the principal figures in this rebirth was the Polish
astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. In his work On the Revolutions of the Heavenly
Spheres, Copernicus claimed that all of the planets, including Earth, revolved about the
sun in circular orbits. Although some of Copernicus’s claims were invalid, the
controversy set off by his heliocentric theory motivated astronomers to search for a
mathematical model to explain the observed movements of the sun and planets. The
first to find an accurate model was the German astronomer Johannes Kepler
(1571–1630). Kepler discovered that the planets move about the sun in elliptical orbits,
with the sun not as the center but as a focal point of the orbit.
The use of ellipses to explain the movements of the planets is only one of many
practical and aesthetic uses. As with parabolas, you will begin your study of this 
second type of conic by defining it as a locus of points. Now, however, two focal points
are used rather than one.
An ellipse is the set of all points 
the sum of whose distances from two 
distinct fixed points called foci is constant. (See Figure 10.7.) The line through the foci
intersects the ellipse at two points, called the vertices. The chord joining the vertices is
the major axis, and its midpoint is the center of the ellipse. The chord perpendicular
to the major axis at the center is the minor axis of the ellipse. (See Figure 10.8.)
Figure 10.7
Figure 10.8
You can visualize the definition of an ellipse by imagining two thumbtacks placed
at the foci, as shown in Figure 10.9.

NICOLAUS COPERNICUS (1473–1543)
Copernicus began to study 
planetary motion when he was
asked to revise the calendar. At
that time, the exact length of the
year could not be accurately pre-
dicted using the theory that Earth
was the center of the universe.

Theorem 10.2 presented a reflective property of parabolas. Ellipses have a similar
reflective property. You are asked to prove the next theorem in Exercise 84.
One of the reasons that astronomers had difficulty detecting that the orbits of the
planets are ellipses is that the foci of the planetary orbits are relatively close to the 
center of the sun, making the orbits nearly circular. To measure the ovalness of an
ellipse, you can use the concept of eccentricity.
To see how this ratio is used to describe the shape of an ellipse, note that because
the foci of an ellipse are located along the major axis between the vertices and the 
center, it follows that
For an ellipse that is nearly circular, the foci are close to the center and the ratio 
is
close to 0, and for an elongated ellipse, the foci are close to the vertices and the ratio
is close to 1, as shown in Figure 10.12. Note that 
for every ellipse.
The orbit of the moon has an eccentricity of

Finding the Circumference of an Ellipse
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Show that the circumference of the ellipse 
is
Solution
Because the ellipse is symmetric with respect to both the 
axis 
and the 
axis, you know that its circumference 
is four times the arc length of 
in the first quadrant. The function is differentiable for all in the interval 
except
at 
So, the circumference is given by the improper integral
Using the trigonometric substitution 
you obtain
Because 
you can rewrite this integral as
A great deal of time has been devoted to the study of elliptic integrals. Such
integrals generally do not have elementary antiderivatives. To find the circumference of
an ellipse, you must usually resort to an approximation technique.
Approximating the Value of an Elliptic Integral
Use the elliptic integral in Example 5 to approximate the circumference of the ellipse 
Solution
Because 
you have
Applying Simpson’s Rule with 
produces
So, the ellipse has a circumference of about 28.36 units, as shown in Figure 10.13.

Hyperbolas
The definition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse. For an ellipse, the sum
of the distances between the foci and a point on the ellipse is fixed, whereas for a 
hyperbola, the absolute value of the difference between these distances is fixed.
A hyperbola is the set of all points 
for which the absolute value of the
difference between the distances from two distinct fixed points called foci is constant.
(See Figure 10.14.) The line through the two foci intersects a hyperbola at two points
called the vertices. The line segment connecting the vertices is the transverse axis, and
the midpoint of the transverse axis is the center of the hyperbola. One distinguishing
feature of a hyperbola is that its graph has two separate branches.
Note that the constants 
and 
do not have the same relationship for 
hyperbolas as they do for ellipses. For hyperbolas,
but for ellipses,
An important aid in sketching the graph of a hyperbola is the determination of its
asymptotes, as shown in Figure 10.15. Each hyperbola has two asymptotes that
intersect at the center of the hyperbola. The asymptotes pass through the vertices of a
rectangle of dimensions 
by 
with its center at 
The line segment of length
joining
and
is referred to as the conjugate axis of the hyperbola.
In Figure 10.15, you can see that the asymptotes coincide with the diagonals of the
rectangle with dimensions 
and 
centered at 
This provides you with a quick
means of sketching the asymptotes, which in turn aids in sketching the hyperbola.

Begin by rewriting the equation in standard form.
The transverse axis is horizontal and the vertices occur at

The ends
of the conjugate axis occur at

Using these four points, you can
sketch the rectangle shown in Figure 10.16(a). By drawing the asymptotes through the

The application in Example 8 was developed during World War II. It shows how
the properties of hyperbolas can be used in radar and other detection systems.
A Hyperbolic Detection System
Two microphones, 1 mile apart, record an explosion. Microphone 
receives the sound
2 seconds before microphone 
Where was the explosion?
Solution
Assuming that sound travels at 1100 feet per second, you know that the
explosion took place 2200 feet farther from 
than from 
as shown in Figure 10.18.
The locus of all points that are 2200 feet closer to 
than to 
is one branch of the 
hyperbola 
where
and
Because 
it follows that
and you can conclude that the explosion occurred somewhere on the right branch of the
hyperbola
In Example 8, you were able to determine only the hyperbola on which the
explosion occurred, but not the exact location of the explosion. If, however, you had
received the sound at a third position 
then two other hyperbolas would be
determined. The exact location of the explosion would be the point at which these three
hyperbolas intersect.
Another interesting application of conics involves the orbits of comets in our solar
system. Of the 610 comets identified prior to 1970, 245 have elliptical orbits, 295 have
parabolic orbits, and 70 have hyperbolic orbits. The center of the sun is a focus of each
orbit, and each orbit has a vertex at the point at which the comet is closest to the sun.
Undoubtedly, many comets with parabolic or hyperbolic orbits have not been 
identified—such comets pass through our solar system only once. Only comets with
elliptical orbits, such as Halley’s comet, remain in our solar system.
The type of orbit for a comet can be determined as follows.
1. Ellipse:
2. Parabola:
3. Hyperbola:
In each of the above,
is the distance between one vertex and one focus of the comet’s
orbit (in meters),
is the velocity of the comet at the vertex (in meters per second),
kilograms is the mass of the sun, and 
cubic meters
per kilogram-second squared is the gravitational constant.

Plane Curves and Parametric Equations
Until now, you have been representing a graph by a single equation involving 
variables. In this section, you will study situations in which 
variables are used to
represent a curve in the plane.
Consider the path followed by an object 
that is propelled into the air at an angle of 
For an initial velocity of 48 feet per second,
the object travels the parabolic path given by
Rectangular equation
as shown in Figure 10.19. This equation,
however, does not tell the whole story. 
Although it does tell you where the object 
has been, it doesn’t tell you when the object 
was at a given point 
To determine 
this time, you can introduce a third variable 
called a parameter. By writing both and 
as functions of 
you obtain the parametric 
equations

and

From this set of equations, you can determine that at time 
the object is at the
point 
Similarly, at time 
the object is at the point 
and so on. (You will learn a method for determining this particular set of parametric
equations—the equations of motion—later, in Section 12.3.)
For this particular motion problem,

are continuous functions of

resulting path is called a plane curve.

At times, it is
important to distinguish
between a graph (the set of
points) and a curve (the points
together with their defining
parametric equations). When 
it is important, the distinction 
will be explicit. When it is not
important,

When sketching a curve represented by a set of parametric equations, you can plot
points in the 
plane. Each set of coordinates 
is determined from a value chosen
for the parameter 
By plotting the resulting points in order of increasing values of 
the curve is traced out in a specific direction. This is called the orientation of the curve.
Sketching a Curve
Sketch the curve described by the parametric equations
and
where 
Solution
For values of on the given interval,
the parametric equations yield the points 
shown in the table.
By plotting these points in order of increasing
and using the continuity of and 
you
obtain the curve 
shown in Figure 10.20. 
Note that the arrows on the curve indicate 
its orientation as increases from 
to 3.
According to the Vertical Line Test, the graph shown in Figure 10.20 does not
define 
as a function of 
This points out one benefit of parametric equations––they
can be used to represent graphs that are more general than graphs of functions.
It often happens that two different sets of parametric equations have the same
graph. For instance, the set of parametric equations
and
has the same graph as the set given in Example 1. (See Figure 10.21.) However,
comparing the values of in Figures 10.20 and 10.21, you can see that the second graph
is traced out more rapidly (considering 
as time) than the first graph. So, in 
applications, different parametric representations can be used to represent various
speeds at which objects travel along a given path.

Eliminating the Parameter
Finding a rectangular equation that represents the graph of a set of parametric equations
is called eliminating the parameter. For instance, you can eliminate the parameter
from the set of parametric equations in Example 1 as follows.
Once you have eliminated the parameter, you can recognize that the equation
represents a parabola with a horizontal axis and vertex at 
as
shown in Figure 10.20.
The range of 
and 
implied by the parametric equations may be altered by the
change to rectangular form. In such instances, the domain of the rectangular equation
must be adjusted so that its graph matches the graph of the parametric equations. Such
a situation is demonstrated in the next example.
Adjusting the Domain
Sketch the curve represented by the equations
and
by eliminating the parameter and adjusting the domain of the resulting rectangular
equation.
Solution
Begin by solving one of the parametric equations for 
For instance, you
can solve the first equation for as follows.
Parametric equation for 
Square each side.
Solve for 
Now, substituting into the parametric equation for produces
Parametric equation for 
Substitute 
for 
Simplify.
The rectangular equation,
is defined for all values of 
but from the
parametric equation for 
you can see that the curve is defined only when 
This
implies that you should restrict the domain of 
to positive values, as shown in 
Figure 10.22.

In Examples 2 and 3, it is important to realize that eliminating the parameter is 
primarily an aid to curve sketching. When the parametric equations represent the path
of a moving object, the graph alone is not sufficient to describe the object’s motion. You
still need the parametric equations to tell you the position, direction, and speed at a
given time.

Finding Parametric Equations
The first three examples in this section illustrate techniques for sketching the graph 
represented by a set of parametric equations. You will now investigate the reverse 
problem. How can you determine a set of parametric equations for a given graph or a
given physical description? From the discussion following Example 1, you know that
such a representation is not unique. This is demonstrated further in the next example,
which finds two different parametric representations for a given graph.
Finding Parametric Equations for a Given Graph

TECHNOLOGY
To be efficient at using a graphing utility, it is important that
you develop skill in representing a graph by a set of parametric equations. The 
reason for this is that many graphing utilities have only three graphing modes––
(1) functions, (2) parametric equations, and (3) polar equations. Most graphing 
utilities are not programmed to graph a general equation. For instance, suppose you
want to graph the hyperbola 
To graph the hyperbola in function mode,
you need two equations

Parametric Equations for a Cycloid
Determine the curve traced by a point 
on the circumference of a circle of radius 
rolling along a straight line in a plane. Such a curve is called a cycloid.

begin at the origin. When

CYCLOIDS
Galileo first called attention to
the cycloid, once recommending
that it be used for the arches of
bridges. Pascal once spent 8 days
attempting to solve many of the
problems of cycloids, such as find-
ing the area under one arch and
finding the volume of the solid 
of revolution formed by revolving
the curve about a line.The cycloid
has so many interesting properties
and has caused so many quarrels
among mathematicians that it has
been called “the Helen of geometry”
and “the apple of discord.”

Rolling Curves” by John Bloom
and Lee Whitt in The American
Mathematical Monthly. To view

The Tautochrone and Brachistochrone Problems
The curve described in Example 5 is related to one of the most famous pairs of problems
in the history of calculus. The first problem (called the tautochrone problem) began
with Galileo’s discovery that the time required to complete a full swing of a pendulum
is approximately the same whether it makes a large movement at high speed or a small
movement at lower speed (see Figure 10.26). Late in his life, Galileo realized that he
could use this principle to construct a clock. However, he was not able to conquer the
mechanics of actual construction. Christian Huygens (1629–1695) was the first to
design and construct a working model. In his work with pendulums, Huygens realized
that a pendulum does not take exactly the same time to complete swings of varying
lengths. (This doesn’t affect a pendulum clock, because the length of the circular arc is
kept constant by giving the pendulum a slight boost each time it passes its lowest point.)
But, in studying the problem, Huygens discovered that a ball rolling back and forth on
an inverted cycloid does complete each cycle in exactly the same time.
The second problem, which was posed by John Bernoulli in 1696, is called the
brachistochrone problem—in Greek, brachys means short and chronos means time.
The problem was to determine the path down which a particle (such as a ball) will slide
from point 
to point 
in the shortest time. Several mathematicians took up the 
challenge, and the following year the problem was solved by Newton, Leibniz,
L’Hôpital, John Bernoulli, and James Bernoulli. As it turns out, the solution is not a
straight line from 
to 
but an inverted cycloid passing through the points 
and 
as
shown in Figure 10.27.
An inverted cycloid is the path down which
a ball will roll in the shortest time.
Figure 10.27
The amazing part of the solution to the brachistochrone problem is that a particle 
starting at rest at any point 
of the cycloid between 
and 
will take exactly the same
time to reach 
as shown in Figure 10.28.
A ball starting at point 
takes the same time
to reach point 
as one that starts at point

Slope and Tangent Lines
Now that you can represent a graph in the plane by a set of parametric equations, it is
natural to ask how to use calculus to study plane curves. Consider the projectile 
represented by the parametric equations
and
as shown in Figure 10.29. From the discussion at the beginning of Section 10.2, you
know that these equations enable you to locate the position of the projectile at a given
time. You also know that the object is initially projected at an angle of 
or a slope
of 
But how can you find the slope at some other time 
The next 
theorem answers this question by giving a formula for the slope of the tangent line as a
function of 
Proof
In Figure 10.30, consider 
and let
and
Because 
as 
you can write
Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 
you can use the differentiability

In the preceding section, you saw that if a circle rolls along a line, then a point on
its circumference will trace a path called a cycloid. If the circle rolls around the 
circumference of another circle, then the path of the point is an epicycloid. The next
example shows how to find the arc length of an epicycloid.
Finding Arc Length
A circle of radius 1 rolls around the circumference of a larger circle of radius 4, as
shown in Figure 10.33. The epicycloid traced by a point on the circumference of the
smaller circle is given by
and
Find the distance traveled by the point in one complete trip about the larger circle.
Solution
Before applying Theorem 10.8, note in Figure 10.33 that the curve has
sharp points when 
and 
Between these two points,
and 
are
not simultaneously 0. So, the portion of the curve generated from 
to 
is
smooth. To find the total distance traveled by the point, you can find the arc length of
that portion lying in the first quadrant and multiply by 4.

Polar Coordinates and Polar Graphs
Understand the polar coordinate system.
Rewrite rectangular coordinates and equations in polar form and vice versa.
Sketch the graph of an equation given in polar form.
Find the slope of a tangent line to a polar graph.
Identify several types of special polar graphs.
Polar Coordinates
So far, you have been representing graphs as collections of points 
on the 
rectangular coordinate system. The corresponding equations for these graphs have been
in either rectangular or parametric form. In this section, you will study a coordinate
system called the polar coordinate system.
To form the polar coordinate system in the plane, fix a point 
called the pole (or
origin), and construct from 
an initial ray called the polar axis, as shown in 
Figure 10.35. Then each point 
in the plane can be assigned polar coordinates
as follows.
Figure 10.36 shows three points on the polar coordinate system. Notice that in this
system, it is convenient to locate points with respect to a grid of concentric circles 
intersected by radial lines through the pole.
(a)
(b)
(c)
Figure 10.36
With rectangular coordinates, each point 
has a unique representation. This is
not true with polar coordinates. For instance, the coordinates
and
represent the same point [see parts (b) and (c) in Figure 10.36]. Also, because 
is a
directed distance, the coordinates 
and
represent the same point. In general, the point 
can be written as
or
where is any integer. Moreover, the pole is represented by 
where is any angle.

Coordinate Conversion
To establish the relationship between polar and rectangular coordinates, let the polar
axis coincide with the positive 
axis and the pole with the origin, as shown in 
Figure 10.37. Because 
lies on a circle of radius 
it follows that
Moreover, for

Polar Graphs
One way to sketch the graph of a polar equation is to convert to rectangular coordinates
and then sketch the graph of the rectangular equation.
Graphing Polar Equations
Describe the graph of each polar equation. Confirm each description by converting to a
rectangular equation.
a.
b.
c.
Solution
a. The graph of the polar equation 
consists of all points that are two units from
the pole. So, this graph is a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2. [See
Figure 10.40(a).] You can confirm this by using the relationship 
to
obtain the rectangular equation
Rectangular equation
b. The graph of the polar equation 
consists of all points on the line that makes
an angle of 
with the positive axis. [See Figure 10.40(b).] You can confirm this
by using the relationship 
to obtain the rectangular equation
Rectangular equation
c. The graph of the polar equation 
is not evident by simple inspection, so you
can begin by converting to rectangular form using the relationship 
Polar equation
Rectangular equation
From the rectangular equation, you can see that the graph is a vertical line. [See
Figure 10.40(c).]

TECHNOLOGY
Sketching the graphs of complicated polar equations by hand
can be tedious. With technology, however, the task is not difficult. If your graphing
utility has a polar mode, use it to graph the equations in the exercise set. If your
graphing utility doesn’t have a polar mode, but does have a parametric mode, you
can graph 
by writing the equation as
For instance, the graph of 
shown in 
Figure 10.41 was produced with a graphing 
calculator in parametric mode. This equation 
was graphed using the parametric equations
with the values of varying from 
to 
This curve is of the form 
and is called 
a spiral of Archimedes.

After some experimentation, you will find that the entire curve, which is called a rose
curve, can be sketched by letting vary from 0 to 
as shown in Figure 10.42. If you
try duplicating this graph with a graphing utility, you will find that by letting 
vary
from 0 to 
you will actually trace the entire curve twice.

Slope and Tangent Lines
To find the slope of a tangent line to a polar graph, consider a differentiable function
given by 
To find the slope in polar form, use the parametric equations
and
Using the parametric form of 
given in Theorem 10.7, you have
which establishes the next theorem.
From Theorem 10.11, you can make the following observations.
1. Solutions of 
yield horizontal tangents, provided that 
2. Solutions of 
yield vertical tangents, provided that 
If 
and 
are simultaneously 0, then no conclusion can be drawn about 
tangent lines.
Finding Horizontal and Vertical Tangent Lines

Solution
Begin by writing the equation in parametric form.
and
Next, differentiate and with respect to and set each derivative equal to 0.
So, the graph has vertical tangent lines at

Finding Horizontal and Vertical Tangent Lines
Find the horizontal and vertical tangents to the graph of 
Solution
Let 
and then differentiate with respect to 
Setting 
equal to 0, you can see that 
and 
So,
when 
and 0. Similarly, using 
you have
Setting 
equal to 0, you can see that 
and 
So, you can 
conclude that 
when 
and 
From these results, and from
the graph shown in Figure 10.46, you can conclude that the graph has horizontal 
tangents at 
and 
and has vertical tangents at 
and 
This graph is called a cardioid. Note that both derivatives 
and
are 0 when 
Using this information alone, you don’t know whether the
graph has a horizontal or vertical tangent line at the pole. From Figure 10.46, however,
you can see that the graph has a cusp at the pole.
Theorem 10.11 has an important consequence. If the graph of 
passes
through the pole when 
and 
then the formula for 
simplifies as
follows.
So, the line 
is tangent to the graph at the pole,
Theorem 10.12 is useful because it states that the zeros of 
can be used to
find the tangent lines at the pole. Note that because a polar curve can cross the pole
more than once, it can have more than one tangent line at the pole. For example, the
rose curve 
has three tangent lines at the pole, as shown in Figure 10.47.
For this curve,
cos 
is 0 when 
is 
and 
Moreover, the 
derivative 
is not 0 for these values of .

Find the area of a surface of revolution (polar form).
Area of a Polar Region
The development of a formula for the area of a polar region
parallels that for the area of a region on the rectangular 
coordinate system, but uses sectors of a circle instead of 
rectangles as the basic elements of area. In Figure 10.48,
note that the area of a circular sector of radius is 
provided is measured in radians.
Consider the function 
where is continuous 
and nonnegative on the interval 
The region
bounded by the graph of and the radial lines 
and
is shown in Figure 10.49(a). To find the area of this 
region, partition the interval 
into equal subintervals
Then approximate the area of the region by the sum of the areas of the 
sectors, as
shown in Figure 10.49(b).
Taking the limit as 
produces
which leads to the next theorem.
You can use the formula in Theorem 10.13 to find the area of a region bounded by
the graph of a continuous nonpositive function. The formula is not necessarily valid,
however, when takes on both positive and negative values in the interval , .

Points of Intersection of Polar Graphs
Because a point may be represented in different ways in polar coordinates, care must
be taken in determining the points of intersection of two polar graphs. For example,
consider the points of intersection of the graphs of
and
as shown in Figure 10.52. As with rectangular equations, you can attempt to find the
points of intersection by solving the two equations simultaneously, as shown.
First equation
Substitute 
from 2nd equation into 1st equation.
Simplify.
Solve for
The corresponding points of intersection are 
and 
From Figure
10.52, however, you can see that there is a third point of intersection that did not show
up when the two polar equations were solved simultaneously. (This is one reason why
you should sketch a graph when finding the area of a polar region.) The reason the third
point was not found is that it does not occur with the same coordinates in the two
graphs. On the graph of 
the point occurs with coordinates 
but on the
graph of
the point occurs with coordinates 
In addition to solving equations simultaneously and sketching a graph, note that
because the pole can be represented by 
where 
is any angle, you should check
separately for the pole when finding points of intersection.
You can compare the problem of finding points of intersection of two polar graphs
with that of finding collision points of two satellites in intersecting orbits about Earth,
as shown in Figure 10.53. The satellites will not collide as long as they reach the points
of intersection at different times ( -values). Collisions will occur only at the points of
intersection that are “simultaneous points”—those that are reached at the same time 
( -value).
The paths of satellites can cross without 
causing a collision.

Finding the Area of a Region Between Two Curves
Find the area of the region common to the two regions bounded by the curves.
Circle
and
Cardioid
Solution
Because both curves are symmetric with respect to the 
axis, you can
work with the upper half-plane, as shown in Figure 10.54. The blue shaded region lies
between the circle and the radial line
Because the circle has coordinates 
at the pole, you can integrate between 
and 
to obtain the area of this region. The region that is shaded red is bounded by
the radial lines 
and 
and the cardioid. So, you can find the area of this
second region by integrating between 
and 
The sum of these two integrals gives
the area of the common region lying above the radial line 
Region between circle
Region between cardioid and
and radial line 
radial lines 
and 
Finally, multiplying by 2, you can conclude that the total area is
Area of region inside circle and cardioid
To check the reasonableness of this result, note that the area of the circular region is
Area of circle
So, it seems reasonable that the area of the region lying inside the circle and the 
cardioid is 
To see the benefit of polar coordinates for finding the area in Example 3, consider
the integral below, which gives the comparable area in rectangular coordinates.
Use the integration capabilities of a graphing utility to show that you obtain the same
area as that found in Example 3.

Conics, Parametric Equations, and Polar Coordinates
10.6
Polar Equations of Conics and Kepler’s Laws
Analyze and write polar equations of conics.
Understand and use Kepler’s Laws of planetary motion.
Polar Equations of Conics
In this chapter, you have seen that the rectangular equations of ellipses and hyperbolas
take simple forms when the origin lies at their centers. As it happens, there are many
important applications of conics in which it is more convenient to use one of the foci as
the reference point (the origin) for the coordinate system. For example, the sun lies at
a focus of Earth’s orbit. Similarly, the light source of a parabolic reflector lies at its
focus. In this section, you will see that polar equations of conics take simpler forms
when one of the foci lies at the pole.
The next theorem uses the concept of eccentricity, as defined in Section 10.1, to
classify the three basic types of conics.
In Figure 10.57, note that for each type of conic, the pole corresponds to the fixed
point (focus) given in the definition.
Ellipse:
Parabola:
Hyperbola:
Figure 10.57
The benefit of locating a focus of a conic at the pole is that the equation of the conic
becomes simpler, as seen in the proof of the next theorem.

Proof
This is a proof for 
with 
In Figure 10.58, consider a
vertical directrix 
units to the right of the focus 
If 
is a point on
the graph of 
then the distance between 
and the directrix can
be shown to be
Because the distance between 
and the pole is simply 
the ratio of 
to 
is 
and, by Theorem 10.16, the graph of the equation must be a conic. The proofs of the
other cases are similar. 
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The four types of equations indicated in Theorem 10.17 can be classified as
follows, where 
a. Horizontal directrix above the pole:
b. Horizontal directrix below the pole:
c. Vertical directrix to the right of the pole:
d. Vertical directrix to the left of the pole:
Figure 10.59 illustrates these four possibilities for a parabola. Note that for 
convenience, the equation for the directrix is shown in rectangular form.

Determining a Conic from Its Equation
Sketch the graph of the conic 
Solution
To determine the type of conic, rewrite the equation as
Write original equation.
So, the graph is an ellipse with 
You can sketch the upper half of the ellipse by
plotting points from 
to 
as shown in Figure 10.60. Then, using symmetry
with respect to the polar axis, you can sketch the lower half.
For the ellipse in Figure 10.60, the major axis is horizontal and the vertices lie at
(15, 0) and 
So, the length of the major axis is 
To find the length of the
minor axis, you can use the equations 
and 
to conclude that

Kepler’s Laws
Kepler’s Laws, named after the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, can be used to
describe the orbits of the planets about the sun.
1. Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit with the sun as a focus.
2. A ray from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas of the ellipse in equal times.
3. The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the mean distance between
the planet and the sun.*
Although Kepler derived these laws empirically, they were later validated by Newton.
In fact, Newton was able to show that each law can be deduced from a set of
universal laws of motion and gravitation that govern the movement of all heavenly 
bodies, including comets and satellites. This is shown in the next example,
involving the comet named after the English mathematician and physicist Edmund
Halley (1656–1742).
Halley’s Comet
Halley’s comet has an elliptical orbit with the sun at one focus and has an eccentricity
of 
The length of the major axis of the orbit is approximately 
35.88 astronomical units (AU). (An astronomical unit is defined as the mean distance
between Earth and the sun, 93 million miles.) Find a polar equation for the orbit. How
close does Halley’s comet come to the sun?
Solution
Using a vertical axis, you can choose an equation of the form
Because the vertices of the ellipse occur when 
and 
you can
determine the length of the major axis to be the sum of the values of the vertices, as
shown in Figure 10.62. That is,
So,
and
Using this value in the equation produces
where 
is measured in astronomical units. To find the closest point to the sun (the
focus), you can write 
Because is the distance between the focus and the center, the closest point is
miles.

Kepler’s Second Law states that as a planet moves about the sun, a ray from the sun
to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This law can also be applied to
comets or asteroids with elliptical orbits. For example, Figure 10.63 shows the orbit of
the asteroid Apollo about the sun. Applying Kepler’s Second Law to this asteroid, you
know that the closer it is to the sun, the greater its velocity, because a short ray must be
moving quickly to sweep out as much area as a long ray.
A ray from the sun to the asteroid Apollo sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
Figure 10.63
The Asteroid Apollo
The asteroid Apollo has a period of 661 Earth days, and its orbit is approximated by the
ellipse
where is measured in astronomical units. How long does it take Apollo to move from
the position 
to 
as shown in Figure 10.64?
Solution
Begin by finding the area swept out as increases from 
to 
Formula for area of a polar graph
Using the substitution 
as discussed in Section 8.6, you obtain
Because the major axis of the ellipse has length 
and the eccentricity is
you can determine that
So, the area of the ellipse is
Area of ellipse
Because the time required to complete the orbit is 661 days, you can apply Kepler’s
Second Law to conclude that the time required to move from the position 
to 
is
which implies that 
109 days.

Vectors and the Geometry of Space
11.1
Vectors in the Plane
Write the component form of a vector.
Perform vector operations and interpret the results geometrically.
Write a vector as a linear combination of standard unit vectors.
Component Form of a Vector
Many quantities in geometry and physics, such as area, volume, temperature, mass, and
time, can be characterized by a single real number that is scaled to appropriate units of 
measure. These are called scalar quantities, and the real number associated with each
is called a scalar.
Other quantities, such as force, velocity, and acceleration, involve both magnitude
and direction and cannot be characterized completely by a single real number. A directed
line segment is used to represent such a quantity, as shown in Figure 11.1. The 
directed line segment 
has initial point
and terminal point Q, and its length (or
magnitude) is denoted by 
Directed line segments that have the same length and
direction are equivalent, as shown in Figure 11.2. The set of all directed line segments
that are equivalent to a given directed line segment 
is a vector in the plane and is
denoted by 
In typeset material, vectors are usually denoted by lowercase, boldface letters such as
and 
When written by hand, however, vectors are often denoted by letters with
arrows above them, such as 
,
, and 
.
Be sure you understand that a vector represents a set of directed line segments
(each having the same length and direction). In practice, however, it is common not to
distinguish between a vector and one of its representatives.
Vector Representation: Directed Line Segments
Let 
be represented by the directed line segment from

Show that

are
equivalent.
Solution
Let

be the initial and terminal points of 
and let
and 
be the initial and terminal points of 
as shown in Figure 11.3. You
can use the Distance Formula to show that
and 
have the same length.
Both line segments have the same direction,
because they both are directed toward the 
upper right on lines having the same slope.
Slope of

Slope of 
Because 
and 
have the same length 
and direction, you can conclude that the two
vectors are equivalent. That is,

The directed line segment whose initial point is the origin is often the most
convenient representative of a set of equivalent directed line segments such as those
shown in Figure 11.3. This representation of 
is said to be in standard position. A
directed line segment whose initial point is the origin can be uniquely represented by
the coordinates of its terminal point 
as shown in Figure 11.4.
This definition implies that two vectors 
and 
are equal if and

The procedures listed below can be used to convert directed line segments to
component form or vice versa.

Vector Operations
Geometrically, the scalar multiple of a vector 
and a scalar is the vector that is
times as long as 
as shown in Figure 11.6. If 
is positive, then 
has the same
direction as 
If is negative, then 
has the opposite direction.
The sum of two vectors can be represented geometrically by positioning the 
vectors (without changing their magnitudes or directions) so that the initial point of one
coincides with the terminal point of the other, as shown in Figure 11.7. The vector
called the resultant vector, is the diagonal of a parallelogram having and as
its adjacent sides.
To find 
(1) move the initial point of 
(2) move the initial point of 
to the terminal point of 
or

WILLIAM ROWAN HAMILTON
(1805–1865)
Some of the earliest work with
vectors was done by the Irish
mathematician William Rowan
Hamilton. Hamilton spent many
years developing a system of 
vector-like quantities called 
quaternions. It wasn’t until the 
latter half of the nineteenth 
century that the Scottish physicist
James Maxwell (1831–1879)
restructured Hamilton’s 
quaternions in a form useful for
representing physical quantities
such as force, velocity, and 
acceleration.

Vector addition and scalar multiplication share many properties of ordinary
arithmetic, as shown in the next theorem.
Proof
The proof of the Associative Property of vector addition uses the Associative
Property of addition of real numbers.
The other properties can be proved in a similar manner. 
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
Any set of vectors (with an accompanying set of scalars) that satisfies the eight
properties listed in Theorem 11.1 is a vector space.* The eight properties are the 
vector space axioms. So, this theorem states that the set of vectors in the plane (with the
set of real numbers) forms a vector space.

Generally, the length of the sum of two vectors is not equal to the sum of their
lengths. To see this, consider the vectors 
and 
as shown in Figure 11.9. With 
and
as two sides of a triangle, the length of the third side is 
and
Equality occurs only when the vectors 
and 
have the same direction. This result is
called the triangle inequality for vectors. (You are asked to prove this in Exercise 77,
Section 11.3.)
Standard Unit Vectors
The unit vectors 
and 
are called the standard unit vectors in the plane and
are denoted by
Standard unit vectors
as shown in Figure 11.10. These vectors can be used to represent any vector uniquely,
as follows.
The vector 
is called a linear combination of and 
The scalars

Vectors have many applications in physics and engineering. One example is force.
A vector can be used to represent force, because force has both magnitude and 
direction. If two or more forces are acting on an object, then the resultant force on the
object is the vector sum of the vector forces.
Finding the Resultant Force
Two tugboats are pushing an ocean liner, as shown in Figure 11.12. Each boat is
exerting a force of 400 pounds. What is the resultant force on the ocean liner?
Solution
Using Figure 11.12, you can represent the forces exerted by the first and
second tugboats as
The resultant force on the ocean liner is
So, the resultant force on the ocean liner is approximately 752 pounds in the direction
of the positive 
axis.
In surveying and navigation, a bearing is a direction that measures the acute angle
that a path or line of sight makes with a fixed north-south line. In air navigation,
bearings are measured in degrees clockwise from north.
Finding a Velocity
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
An airplane is traveling at a fixed altitude with a negligible wind factor. The airplane 
is traveling at a speed of 500 miles per hour with a bearing of 
as shown in 
Figure 11.13(a). As the airplane reaches a certain point, it encounters wind with a 
velocity of 70 miles per hour in the direction N 
E (
east of north), as shown in
Figure 11.13(b). What are the resultant speed and direction of the airplane?
Solution
Using Figure 11.13(a), represent the velocity of the airplane (alone) as
The velocity of the wind is represented by the vector
The resultant velocity of the airplane (in the wind) is
To find the resultant speed and direction, write 
Because
you can write
The new speed of the airplane, as altered by the wind, is approximately 522.5 miles per
hour in a path that makes an angle of 
with the positive 
axis.

Space Coordinates and Vectors in Space
Understand the three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system.
Analyze vectors in space.
Coordinates in Space
Up to this point in the text, you have been primarily concerned with the 
two-dimensional coordinate system. Much of the remaining part of your study of
calculus will involve the three-dimensional coordinate system.
Before extending the concept of a vector to three dimensions, you must be able to
identify points in the three-dimensional coordinate system. You can construct this
system by passing a 
axis perpendicular to both the 
and 
axes at the origin, as
shown in Figure 11.14. Taken as pairs, the axes determine three coordinate planes: the
-plane, the 
-plane, and the 
-plane. These three coordinate planes separate 
three-space into eight octants. The first octant is the one for which all three coordinates
are positive. In this three-dimensional system, a point 
in space is determined by an
ordered triple 
where 
and are as follows.
directed distance from 
plane to 
directed distance from 
plane to 
directed distance from 
plane to 
Several points are shown in Figure 11.15.
Points in the three-dimensional coordinate system are 
represented by ordered triples.
Figure 11.15
A three-dimensional coordinate system 
can have either a right-handed or a left-
handed orientation. To determine the 
orientation of a system, imagine that you 
are standing at the origin, with your arms 
pointing in the direction of the positive

Many of the formulas established for the two-dimensional coordinate system can
be extended to three dimensions. For example, to find the distance between two points
in space, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem twice, as shown in Figure 11.17. By
doing this, you will obtain the formula for the distance between the points 
and

a nonzero vector 
have the same direction as 
whereas negative multiples have the
direction opposite of 
In general, two nonzero vectors and are parallel when there
is some scalar such that 
For example, in Figure11.21, the vectors

The Dot Product of Two Vectors
Use properties of the dot product of two vectors.

The Dot Product
So far, you have studied two operations with vectors—vector addition and multiplication
by a scalar—each of which yields another vector. In this section, you will study a third
vector operation, the dot product. This product yields a scalar, rather than a vector.
Proof

Angle Between Two Vectors
The angle between two nonzero vectors is the angle 
between their
respective standard position vectors, as shown in Figure 11.24. The next theorem shows
how to find this angle using the dot product. (Note that the angle between the zero 
vector and another vector is not defined here.)

Consider the triangle determined by vectors 
and 
as shown in
Figure 11.24. By the Law of Cosines, you can write
Using the properties of the dot product, the left side can be rewritten as
and substitution back into the Law of Cosines yields

From Theorem 11.5, you can see that two nonzero vectors meet at a right angle if
and only if their dot product is zero. Two such vectors are said to be orthogonal.
From this definition, it follows that the zero vector is orthogonal to every vector 
because 
Moreover, for

So, you can use Theorem 11.5 to conclude that two nonzero vectors are

the angle, measured counterclockwise,

convenient to measure direction in terms of the
angles

Projections and Vector Components
You have already seen applications in which two vectors are added to produce a
resultant vector. Many applications in physics and engineering pose the reverse
problem—decomposing a vector into the sum of two vector components. The following
physical example enables you to see the usefulness of this procedure.
Consider a boat on an inclined ramp, as shown in Figure 11.28. The force 
due to
gravity pulls the boat down the ramp and against the ramp. These two forces,
and
are orthogonal—they are called the vector components of 
Vector components of 
The forces 
and 
help you analyze the effect of gravity on the boat. For example,
indicates the force necessary to keep the boat from rolling down the ramp, whereas
indicates the force that the tires must withstand.

Finding a Force
A 600-pound boat sits on a ramp inclined at 
as shown in Figure 11.32. What force
is required to keep the boat from rolling down the ramp?
Solution
Because the force due to gravity is vertical and downward, you can
represent the gravitational force by the vector 
To find the force required to
keep the boat from rolling down the ramp, project 
onto a unit vector 
in the 
direction of the ramp, as follows.
Unit vector along ramp
Therefore, the projection of 
onto is 
The magnitude of this force is 300, and therefore a force of 300 pounds is required to
keep the boat from rolling down the ramp.

done by the constant force 
acting along the line of motion of an object
is given by

The Cross Product of Two Vectors in Space

11.4
The Cross Product of Two Vectors in Space
Find the cross product of two vectors in space.
Use the triple scalar product of three vectors in space.
The Cross Product
Many applications in physics, engineering, and geometry involve finding a vector in
space that is orthogonal to two given vectors. In this section, you will study a product
that will yield such a vector. It is called the cross product, and it is most conveniently
defined and calculated using the standard unit vector form. Because the cross product
yields a vector, it is also called the vector product.
It is important to note that this definition applies only to three-dimensional vectors. The
cross product is not defined for two-dimensional vectors.
A convenient way to calculate 
is to use the determinant form with cofactor
expansion shown below. (This 
determinant form is used simply to help remember
the formula for the cross product—it is technically not a determinant because not all the
entries of the corresponding matrix are real numbers.)
Note the minus sign in front of the component. Each of the three 
determinants
can be evaluated by using the diagonal pattern
Here are a couple of examples.

NOTATION FOR DOT AND CROSS 
PRODUCTS
The notation for the dot product
and cross product of vectors was
first introduced by the American
physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs
(1839–1903). In the early 1880s,
Gibbs built a system to represent
physical quantities called “vector
analysis.” The system was a 
departure from Hamilton’s theory
of quaternions.
REMARK
Note that this
result is the negative of that in
part (a).

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Note that Property 1 of Theorem 11.7 indicates that the cross product is not
commutative. In particular, this property indicates that the vectors 
and 
have
equal lengths but opposite directions. The next theorem lists some other geometric
properties of the cross product of two vectors.
Proof
To prove Property 2, note because 
it follows that
To prove Property 4, refer to Figure 11.35, which is a parallelogram having 
and 
as
adjacent sides. Because the height of the parallelogram is 
the area is

One
way to remember the orientations of the vectors 
and 
is to compare them with
the unit vectors

as shown in Figure 11.36. The three vectors

In physics, the cross product can be used to measure torque—the moment 
of a
force 
about a point 
as shown in Figure 11.39. If the point of application of the
force is 
then the moment of 
about 
is
Moment of 
about 
The magnitude of the moment 
measures the tendency of the vector 
to rotate
counterclockwise (using the right-hand rule) about an axis directed along the vector 
An Application of the Cross Product
A vertical force of 50 pounds is applied to the end of a one-foot lever that is attached
to an axle at point 
as shown in Figure 11.40. Find the moment of this force about the
point 
when 
Solution
Represent the 50-pound force as
and the lever as
The moment of 
about 
is
Moment of 
about 
The magnitude of this moment is 25 foot-pounds.
In Example 4, note that the moment (the tendency of the lever to rotate about its
axle) is dependent on the angle 
When 
the moment is 0. The moment is 
greatest when 
The Triple Scalar Product
For vectors 
and 
in space, the dot product of 
and 
is called the triple scalar product, as defined in Theorem 11.9. The proof of this
theorem is left as an exercise (see Exercise 59).
Note that the value of a determinant is multiplied by 
when two rows are 
interchanged. After two such interchanges, the value of the determinant will be
unchanged. So, the following triple scalar products are equivalent.

If the vectors 
and 
do not lie in the same plane, then the triple scalar 
product 
can be used to determine the volume of the parallelepiped (a 
polyhedron, all of whose faces are parallelograms) with 
and 
as adjacent edges,
as shown in Figure 11.41. This is established in the next theorem.
Proof
In Figure 11.41, note that the area of the base is 
and the height of the
parallelpiped is 
Therefore, the volume is

A natural consequence of Theorem 11.10 is that the volume of the parallelepiped
is 0 if and only if the three vectors are coplanar. That is, when the vectors

they lie in the same plane if and only if

Lines in Space
In the plane, slope is used to determine the equation of a line. In space, it is more
convenient to use vectors to determine the equation of a line.
In Figure 11.43, consider the line 
through the point 
and parallel to
the vector 
The vector is a direction vector for the line 
and 
and

is to say that it consists of
all points 
for which the vector 
is parallel to 
This means that

scalar multiple of and you can write 
where is a scalar (a real number).
By equating corresponding components, you can obtain parametric equations of a line
in space.
If the direction numbers 
and 
are all nonzero, then you can eliminate the
parameter to obtain symmetric equations of the line.

Finding Parametric and Symmetric Equations
Find parametric and symmetric equations of the line

Neither parametric equations nor symmetric equations of a given line are unique.

Planes in Space
You have seen how an equation of a line in 
space can be obtained from a point on the line
and a vector parallel to it. You will now see 
that an equation of a plane in space can be 
obtained from a point in the plane and a 
vector normal (perpendicular) to the plane.
Consider the plane containing the point

of all points

Finding the Line of Intersection of Two Planes
Find the angle between the two planes
and
Then find parametric equations of their line of intersection (see Figure 11.48).
Figure 11.48
Solution
Normal vectors for the planes are 
and 
Consequently, the angle between the two planes is determined as follows.
This implies that the angle between the two planes is 
You can find the line
of intersection of the two planes by simultaneously solving the two linear equations 
representing the planes. One way to do this is to multiply the first equation by 
and
add the result to the second equation.
Substituting 
back into one of the original equations, you can determine that
Finally, by letting 
you obtain the parametric equations

which indicate that 1, 4, and 7 are direction numbers for the line of intersection.
Note that the direction numbers in Example 4 can be obtained from the cross 
product of the two normal vectors as follows.
This means that the line of intersection of the two planes is parallel to the cross 
product of their normal vectors.

Sketching Planes in Space
If a plane in space intersects one of the coordinate planes, then the line of intersection
is called the trace of the given plane in the coordinate plane. To sketch a plane in space,
it is helpful to find its points of intersection with the coordinate axes and its traces in the
coordinate planes. For example, consider the plane
Equation of plane
You can find the 
trace by letting 
and sketching the line

plane. This line intersects the -axis at 
and the 
axis at 
In
Figure 11.49, this process is continued by finding the 
trace and the

from an equation of a plane, such as

between a point and a plane, and (2) finding the distance between a point and a line.
The solutions of these problems illustrate the versatility and usefulness of vectors in
coordinate geometry: the first problem uses the dot product of two vectors, and the 
second problem uses the cross product.
The distance 
between a point 
and a plane is the length of the shortest line 
segment connecting 
to the plane, as shown in Figure 11.52. For any point 
in the
plane, you can find this distance by projecting the vector 
onto the normal vector 
The length of this projection is the desired distance.
To find a point in the plane 
where 
let 
and
Then, from the equation 
you can conclude that the point
lies in the plane.

Finding the Distance Between Two Parallel Planes
Two parallel planes,
and 
are shown in
Figure 11.53. To find the distance between the planes, choose a point in the first plane,
such as 
Then, from the second plane, you can determine that
and 
and conclude that the distance is
The formula for the distance between a point and a line in space resembles that for
the distance between a point and a plane—except that you replace the dot product with
the length of the cross product and the normal vector 
with a direction vector for 
the line.
Proof
In Figure 11.54, let 
be the distance between the point 
and the line. Then
where 
is the angle between 
and 
By Property 2 of Theorem
11.8, you have

You have learned two distance formulas in this section—one for
the distance between a point and a plane, and one for the distance
between a point and a line. In this project, you will study a third
distance problem—the distance between two skew lines. Two lines
in space are skew if they are neither parallel nor intersecting (see
figure).
(a) Consider the following two lines in space.
(i) Show that these lines are not parallel.
(ii) Show that these lines do not intersect, and therefore are
skew lines.
(iii) Show that the two lines lie in parallel planes.
(iv) Find the distance between the parallel planes from part
(iii). This is the distance between the original skew lines.
(b) Use the procedure in part (a) to find the distance between the
lines.
(c) Use the procedure in part (a) to find the distance between the
lines.
(d) Develop a formula for finding the distance between the skew
lines.

Cylindrical Surfaces
The first five sections of this chapter contained the vector portion of the preliminary
work necessary to study vector calculus and the calculus of space. In this and the next
section, you will study surfaces in space and alternative coordinate systems for space.
You have already studied two special types of surfaces.
1. Spheres:
Section 11.2
2. Planes:
Section 11.5
A third type of surface in space is a cylindrical surface, or simply a cylinder. To
define a cylinder, consider the familiar right circular cylinder shown in Figure 11.56.
The cylinder was generated by a vertical line moving around the circle 
in
the 
plane. This circle is a generating curve for the cylinder, as indicated in the next
definition.
Without loss of generality, you can 
assume that 
lies in one of the three 
coordinate planes. Moreover, this text 
restricts the discussion to right cylinders––
cylinders whose rulings are perpendicular 
to the coordinate plane containing 
as shown in Figure 11.57. Note that the 
rulings intersect 
and are parallel to the 
line 
For the right circular cylinder shown in 
Figure 11.56, the equation of the generating 
curve in the 
-plane is
To find an equation of the cylinder, note that you can generate any one of the rulings by
fixing the values of and and then allowing to take on all real values. In this sense,
the value of is arbitrary and is, therefore, not included in the equation. In other words,
the equation of this cylinder is simply the equation of its generating curve.

Let 
be a curve in a plane and let 
be a line not in a parallel plane. The set
of all lines parallel to

rulings.

Quadric Surfaces
The fourth basic type of surface in space is a quadric surface. Quadric surfaces are the
three-dimensional analogs of conic sections.
The intersection of a surface with a plane is called the trace of the surface in 
the plane. To visualize a surface in space, it is helpful to determine its traces in some
well-chosen planes. The traces of quadric surfaces are conics. These traces, together
with the standard form of the equation of each quadric surface, are shown in the table
on the next two pages.
In the table on the next two pages, only one of several orientations of each quadric
surface is shown. When the surface is oriented along a different axis, its standard 
equation will change accordingly, as illustrated in Examples 2 and 3. The fact that the
two types of paraboloids have one variable raised to the first power can be helpful in
classifying quadric surfaces. The other four types of basic quadric surfaces have 
equations that are of second degree in all three variables.

three variables. The general form of the equation is
There are six basic types of quadric surfaces: ellipsoid, hyperboloid of one 
sheet, hyperboloid of two sheets, elliptic cone, elliptic paraboloid, and
hyperbolic paraboloid.

For a quadric surface not centered at the origin, you can form the standard 
equation by completing the square, as demonstrated in Example 4.

Solution
Begin by grouping terms and factoring where possible.
Next, complete the square for each variable and write the equation in standard form.

TECHNOLOGY
A 3-D graphing utility can help you visualize a surface in
space.* Such a graphing utility may create a three-dimensional graph by sketching
several traces of the surface and then applying a “hidden-line” routine that blocks out
portions of the surface that lie behind other portions of the surface. Two examples of
figures that were generated by Mathematica are shown below.
Elliptic paraboloid
Hyperbolic paraboloid
Using a graphing utility to graph a surface in space requires practice. For one
thing, you must know enough about the surface to be able to specify a viewing
window that gives a representative view of the surface. Also, you can often improve
the view of a surface by rotating the axes. For instance, note that the elliptic
paraboloid in the figure is seen from a line of sight that is “higher” than the line of
sight used to view the hyperbolic paraboloid.

Surfaces of Revolution
The fifth special type of surface you will study is a surface of revolution. In Section
7.4, you studied a method for finding the area of such a surface. You will now look at
a procedure for finding its equation. Consider the graph of the radius function
Generating curve
in the 
plane. When this graph is revolved about the 
axis, it forms a surface of 
revolution, as shown in Figure 11.62. The trace of the surface in the plane 
is a
circle whose radius is 
and whose equation is 
Circular trace in plane:
Replacing 
with produces an equation that is valid for all values of 
In a similar
manner, you can obtain equations for surfaces of revolution for the other two axes, and
the results are summarized as follows.
Finding an Equation for a Surface of Revolution

Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates
Use cylindrical coordinates to represent surfaces in space.
Use spherical coordinates to represent surfaces in space.
Cylindrical Coordinates
You have already seen that some two-dimensional graphs are easier to represent in polar
coordinates than in rectangular coordinates. A similar situation exists for surfaces in
space. In this section, you will study two alternative space-coordinate systems. The
first, the cylindrical coordinate system, is an extension of polar coordinates in the
plane to three-dimensional space.
To convert from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates (or vice versa), use the conversion
guidelines for polar coordinates listed below and illustrated in Figure 11.66.
Cylindrical to rectangular:
Rectangular to cylindrical:
The point 
is called the pole. Moreover, because the representation of a point in
the polar coordinate system is not unique, it follows that the representation in the 
cylindrical coordinate system is also not unique.
Cylindrical-to-Rectangular Conversion
Convert the point 
to rectangular coordinates.
Solution
Using the cylindrical-to-rectangular conversion equations produces
So, in rectangular coordinates, the point is 
as shown in

Spherical Coordinates
In the spherical coordinate system, each point is represented by an ordered triple: the
first coordinate is a distance, and the second and third coordinates are angles. This 
system is similar to the latitude-longitude system used to identify points on the 
surface of Earth. For example, the point on the surface of Earth whose latitude is 
North (of the equator) and whose longitude is 
West (of the prime meridian) is
shown in Figure 11.74. Assuming that Earth is spherical and has a radius of 4000 miles,
you would label this point as
Radius
clockwise from
down from
prime meridian
North Pole
The relationship between rectangular and spherical coordinates is illustrated in
Figure 11.75. To convert from one system to the other, use the conversion guidelines
listed below.

The spherical coordinate system is useful primarily for surfaces in space that have
a point or center of symmetry. For example, Figure 11.76 shows three surfaces with
simple spherical equations.

Vector-Valued Functions
12.1 Vector-Valued Functions
Analyze and sketch a space curve given by a vector-valued function.
Extend the concepts of limits and continuity to vector-valued functions.
Space Curves and Vector-Valued Functions
In Section 10.2, a plane curve was defined as the set of ordered pairs 
together with their defining parametric equations
and
where 
and 
are continuous functions of 
on an interval 
This definition can be
extended naturally to three-dimensional space. A space curve
is the set of all ordered
triples 
together with their defining parametric equations
and
where 
and are continuous functions of on an interval 
Before looking at examples of space curves, a new type of function, called a
vector-valued function, is introduced. This type of function maps real numbers to 
vectors.
Technically, a curve in a plane or in space consists of a collection of points and 
the defining parametric equations. Two different curves can have the same graph. For
instance, each of the curves
and
has the unit circle as its graph, but these equations do not represent the same curve—
because the circle is traced out in different ways on the graphs.
Be sure you see the distinction between the vector-valued function 
and the 
real-valued functions 
and 
All are functions of the real variable 
but 
is a
vector, whereas 
and 
are real numbers for each specific value of .
Vector-valued functions serve dual roles in the representation of curves. By letting
the parameter represent time, you can use a vector-valued function to represent motion
along a curve. Or, in the more general case, you can use a vector-valued function to
trace the graph of a curve. In either case, the terminal point of the position vector 
coincides with the point 
or 
on the curve given by the parametric 
equations, as shown in Figure 12.1. The arrowhead on the curve indicates the curve’s
orientation by pointing in the direction of increasing values of t.

Unless stated otherwise, the domain of a vector-valued function is considered to
be the intersection of the domains of the component functions 
and 
For instance,
the domain of 
is the interval 
Sketching a Plane Curve
Sketch the plane curve represented by the vector-valued function
Vector-valued function
Solution
From the position vector 
you can write the parametric equations 
and
Solving for 
and 
and using the identity 
produces the 
rectangular equation
Rectangular equation
The graph of this rectangular equation is the ellipse shown in Figure 12.2. The curve
has a clockwise orientation. That is, as increases from 0 to 
the position vector 
moves clockwise, and its terminal point traces the ellipse.
Sketching a Space Curve
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Sketch the space curve represented by the vector-valued function
Vector-valued function
Solution
From the first two parametric 
equations
and
you can obtain
Rectangular equation
This means that the curve lies on a right circular
cylinder of radius 4, centered about the axis. 
To locate the curve on this cylinder, you can 
use the third parametric equation
In Figure 12.3, note that as increases from 0 
to 
the point 
spirals up the cylinder 
to produce a helix. A real-life example of a 
helix is shown in the drawing at the left.
In Examples 1 and 2, you were given a vector-valued function and were asked to
sketch the corresponding curve. The next two examples address the reverse problem—
finding a vector-valued function to represent a given graph. Of course, when the graph
is described parametrically, representation by a vector-valued function is straightforward.
For instance, to represent the line in space given by 
and
you can simply use the vector-valued function
When a set of parametric equations for the graph is not given, the problem of representing
the graph by a vector-valued function boils down to finding a set of parametric equations.

Representing a Graph: Vector-Valued Function
Represent the parabola
by a vector-valued function.
Solution
Although there are many ways to choose the parameter 
a natural choice
is to let 
Then 
and you have
Vector-valued function
Note in Figure 12.4 the orientation produced by this particular choice of parameter. Had
you chosen 
as the parameter, the curve would have been oriented in the 
opposite direction.
Representing a Graph: Vector-Valued Function
Sketch the space curve 
represented by the intersection of the semiellipsoid
and the parabolic cylinder 
Then find a vector-valued function to represent the
graph.
Solution
The intersection of the two surfaces is shown in Figure 12.5. As in
Example 3, a natural choice of parameter is 
For this choice, you can use the given
equation 
to obtain 
Then it follows that
Because the curve lies above the 
plane, you should choose the positive square root
for and obtain the parametric equations
and
The resulting vector-valued function is
Vector-valued function
Note that the -component of 
implies 
From the points 
and 
shown in Figure 12.5, you can see that the curve is traced as increases
from 
to 2.
The curve 
is the intersection of the semiellipsoid and the parabolic cylinder.

Limits and Continuity
Many techniques and definitions used in the calculus of real-valued functions can 
be applied to vector-valued functions. For instance, you can add and subtract vector-
valued functions, multiply a vector-valued function by a scalar, take the limit of a
vector-valued function, differentiate a vector-valued function, and so on. The basic
approach is to capitalize on the linearity of vector operations by extending the
definitions on a component-by-component basis. For example, to add two vector-
valued functions (in the plane), you can write
Sum
To subtract two vector-valued functions, you can write
Difference
Similarly, to multiply a vector-valued function by a scalar, you can write
Scalar multiplication
To divide a vector-valued function by a scalar, you can write
Scalar division
This component-by-component extension of operations with real-valued functions to
vector-valued functions is further illustrated in the definition of the limit of a vector-valued
function.
If 
approaches the vector 
as 
then the length of the vector 
approaches 0. That is,
as
This is illustrated graphically in Figure 12.6. With this definition of the limit of a 
vector-valued function, you can develop vector versions of most of the limit theorems
given in Chapter 2. For example, the limit of the sum of two vector-valued functions is
the sum of their individual limits. Also, you can use the orientation of the curve 
to
define one-sided limits of vector-valued functions. The next definition extends the
notion of continuity to vector-valued functions.

TECHNOLOGY Almost any
type of three-dimensional sketch
is difficult to do by hand, but
sketching curves in space is
especially difficult. The problem
is trying to create the illusion 
of three dimensions. Graphing
utilities use a variety of techniques
to add “three-dimensionality”
to graphs of space curves: one
way is to show the curve on a
surface, as in Figure 12.7.

Differentiation and Integration of Vector-Valued Functions
Differentiate a vector-valued function.
Integrate a vector-valued function.
Differentiation of Vector-Valued Functions
In Sections 12.3–12.5, you will study several important applications involving the
calculus of vector-valued functions. In preparation for that study, this section is 
devoted to the mechanics of differentiation and integration of vector-valued functions.
The definition of the derivative of a vector-valued function parallels the definition
for real-valued functions.
Differentiation of vector-valued functions can be done on a component-by-
component basis. To see why this is true, consider the function 
Applying the definition of the derivative produces the following.
This important result is listed in the theorem shown below. Note that the derivative of the
vector-valued function is itself a vector-valued function. You can see from Figure 12.8
that 
is a vector tangent to the curve given by 
and pointing in the direction of
increasing values.

Definition of the Derivative of a Vector-Valued Function
The derivative of a vector-valued function
is
for all for which the limit exists. If 
exists, then is differentiable at 
If 
exists for all in an open interval 
then is differentiable on the
interval 
Differentiability of vector-valued functions can be extended to
closed intervals by considering one-sided limits.

Integration of Vector-Valued Functions
The next definition is a consequence of the definition of the derivative of a vector-
valued function.
The antiderivative of a vector-valued function is a family of vector-valued functions
all differing by a constant vector 
For instance, if 
is a three-dimensional vector-
valued function, then for the indefinite integral 
you obtain three constants of
integration
where 
and 
These three scalar constants 
produce one vector constant of integration

Example 6 shows how to evaluate the definite integral of a vector-valued function.
Definite Integral of a Vector-Valued Function
Evaluate the integral
Solution
As with real-valued functions, you can narrow the family of antiderivatives of a
vector-valued function 
down to a single antiderivative by imposing an initial
condition on the vector-valued function 
This is demonstrated in the next example.
The Antiderivative of a Vector-Valued Function
Find the antiderivative of

Solution
Letting 
you can write
Using the fact that 
you have

Vector-Valued Functions
12.3 Velocity and Acceleration
Describe the velocity and acceleration associated with a vector-valued function.
Use a vector-valued function to analyze projectile motion.
Velocity and Acceleration
You are now ready to combine your study of parametric equations, curves, vectors, and
vector-valued functions to form a model for motion along a curve. You will begin by
looking at the motion of an object in the plane. (The motion of an object in space can
be developed similarly.)
As an object moves along a curve in the plane, the coordinates 
and 
of its 
center of mass are each functions of time 
Rather than using the letters and 
to 
represent these two functions, it is convenient to write 
and 
So, the
position vector 
takes the form
Position vector
The beauty of this vector model for representing motion is that you can use the first and
second derivatives of the vector-valued function 
to find the object’s velocity and
acceleration. (Recall from the preceding chapter that velocity and acceleration are both
vector quantities having magnitude and direction.) To find the velocity and 
acceleration vectors at a given time 
consider a point 
that is
approaching the point 
along the curve 
given by 
as
shown in Figure 12.11. As 
the direction of the vector 
(denoted by 
)
approaches the direction of motion at time 
If this limit exists, it is defined as the velocity vector or tangent vector to the curve at
point 
Note that this is the same limit used to define 
So, the direction of 
gives the direction of motion at time 
Moreover, the magnitude of the vector 
gives the speed of the object at time 
Similarly, you can use 
to find acceleration,
as indicated in the definitions at the top of the next page.
As 
approaches the velocity vector.

The speed (at any time) is

By eliminating the parameter 
you obtain the rectangular equation

So, the curve is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, as shown in Figure 12.12.
Because the velocity vector 
has a constant magnitude but a changing direction as increases, the particle moves
around the circle at a constant speed.

Velocity and Acceleration Vectors in the Plane
Sketch the path of an object moving along the plane curve given by
Position vector
and find the velocity and acceleration vectors when 
and 
Solution
Using the parametric equations 
and 
you can determine
that the curve is a parabola given by
Rectangular equation
as shown in Figure 12.13. The velocity vector (at any time) is
Velocity vector
and the acceleration vector (at any time) is
Acceleration vector
When 
the velocity and acceleration vectors are
and
When 
the velocity and acceleration vectors are
and
For the object moving along the path shown in Figure 12.13, note that the
acceleration vector is constant (it has a magnitude of 2 and points to the right). This
implies that the speed of the object is decreasing as the object moves toward the vertex
of the parabola, and the speed is increasing as the object moves away from the 
vertex of the parabola.
This type of motion is not characteristic of comets that travel on parabolic 
paths through our solar system. For such comets, the acceleration vector always
points to the origin (the sun), which implies that the comet’s speed increases as it
approaches the vertex of the path and decreases as it moves away from the vertex.
(See Figure 12.14.)

So far in this section, you have concentrated on finding the velocity and 
acceleration by differentiating the position vector. Many practical applications involve
the reverse problem—finding the position vector for a given velocity or acceleration.
This is demonstrated in the next example.
Finding a Position Vector by Integration
An object starts from rest at the point 
and moves with an acceleration of 
Acceleration vector
where 
is measured in feet per second per second. Find the location of the object
after 
seconds.
Solution
From the description of the object’s motion, you can deduce the following
initial conditions. Because the object starts from rest, you have
Moreover, because the object starts at the point 
you have
To find the position vector, you should integrate twice, each time using one of the 
initial conditions to solve for the constant of integration. The velocity vector is
where 
Letting 
and applying the initial condition
you obtain
So, the velocity at any time is
Velocity vector
Integrating once more produces
where 
Letting 
and applying the initial condition
you have
So, the position vector is
Position vector
The location of the object after 
seconds is given by
as shown in Figure 12.16.

Projectile Motion
You now have the machinery to derive the parametric equations for the path of a
projectile. Assume that gravity is the only force acting on the projectile after it is
launched. So, the motion occurs in a vertical plane, which can be represented by the 
coordinate system with the origin as a point on Earth’s surface, as shown in 
Figure 12.17. For a projectile of mass 
the force due to gravity is
Force due to gravity
where the acceleration due to gravity is 
feet per second per second, or 
9.81 meters per second per second. By Newton’s Second Law of Motion, this 
same force produces an acceleration 
and satisfies the equation 
Consequently, the acceleration of the projectile is given by 
which implies
that
Acceleration of projectile
Derivation of the Position Vector for a Projectile
A projectile of mass 
is launched from an initial position 
with an initial velocity 
Find its position vector as a function of time.
Solution
Begin with the acceleration 
and integrate twice.
You can use the facts that 
and 
to solve for the constant vectors 
and 
Doing this produces
and
Therefore, the position vector is
Position vector
In many projectile problems, the constant vectors 
and 
are not given explicitly.
Often you are given the initial height 
the initial speed 
and the angle at which the
projectile is launched, as shown in Figure 12.18. From the given height, you can deduce
that 
Because the speed gives the magnitude of the initial velocity, it follows
that 
and you can write
So, the position vector can be written in the form

Describing the Path of a Baseball
A baseball is hit 3 feet above ground level at 
100 feet per second and at an angle of 
with
respect to the ground, as shown in Figure 12.19.
Find the maximum height reached by the 
baseball. Will it clear a 10-foot-high fence 
located 300 feet from home plate?
Solution
You are given
and
So, using Theorem 12.3 with 
feet per 
second per second produces
The velocity vector is
The maximum height occurs when
is equal to 0, which implies that
So, the maximum height reached by the ball is
Maximum height when 
seconds
The ball is 300 feet from where it was hit when
Solving this equation for produces 
seconds. At this time, the height
of the ball is
Height when

Find a unit tangent vector and a principal unit normal vector

Find the tangential and normal components of acceleration.
Tangent Vectors and Normal Vectors
In the preceding section, you learned that the velocity vector points in the direction of
motion. This observation leads to the next definition, which applies to any smooth
curve—not just to those for which the parameter represents time.
Recall that a curve is smooth on an interval when 
is continuous and nonzero on
the interval. So, “smoothness” is sufficient to guarantee that a curve has a unit tangent
vector.

The tangent line to a curve at a point is the line that passes through the point and
is parallel to the unit tangent vector. In Example 2, the unit tangent vector is used to find
the tangent line at a point on a helix.

The principal unit normal vector can be difficult to evaluate algebraically. For plane
curves, you can simplify the algebra by finding
Unit tangent vector
and observing that 
must be either
or
Because 
it follows that both 
and 
are unit normal
vectors. The 
unit normal vector 
is the one that points toward the concave
side of the curve, as shown in Figure 12.22 (see Exercise 76). This also holds for curves
in space. That is, for an object moving along a curve 
in space, the vector 
points
in the direction the object is moving, whereas the vector 
is orthogonal 
to 
and points in the direction in which the object is turning, as shown in 
Figure 12.23.
At any point on a curve, a unit normal vector
is orthogonal to the unit tangent vector. The
principal unit normal vector points in the
direction in which the curve is turning.

Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration
In the preceding section, you considered the problem of describing the motion of an
object along a curve. You saw that for an object traveling at a constant speed, the 
velocity and acceleration vectors are perpendicular. This seems reasonable, because the
speed would not be constant if any acceleration were acting in the direction of motion.
You can verify this observation by noting that
when 
is a constant. (See Property 7 of Theorem 12.2.)
For an object traveling at a variable speed, however, the velocity and acceleration
vectors are not necessarily perpendicular. For instance, you saw that the acceleration
vector for a projectile always points down, regardless of the direction of motion.
In general, part of the acceleration (the tangential component) acts in the line of
motion, and part of it (the normal component) acts perpendicular to the line of motion.
In order to determine these two components, you can use the unit vectors 
and 
which serve in much the same way as do and in representing vectors in the plane.
The next theorem states that the acceleration vector lies in the plane determined by 
and

a space curve is given in
terms of the parametric
equations used to represent
the curve. Does this mean
that the arc length of the

Would you want this to be
true? Explain your reasoning.

Arc Length Parameter
You have seen that curves can be represented by vector-valued functions in different
ways, depending on the choice of parameter. For motion along a curve, the convenient
parameter is time 
For studying the geometric properties of a curve, however, the 
convenient parameter is often arc length 
Note that the arc length function is nonnegative. It measures the distance along 
from the initial point 
to the point

Curvature
An important use of the arc length parameter is to find curvature—the measure of how
sharply a curve bends. For instance, in Figure 12.32, the curve bends more sharply at 
than at 
and you can say that the curvature is greater at 
than at 
You can
calculate curvature by calculating the magnitude of the rate of change of the unit
tangent vector 
with respect to the arc length 
as shown in Figure 12.33.
A circle has the same curvature at any point. Moreover, the curvature and the radius
of the circle are inversely related. That is, a circle with a large radius has a small 
curvature, and a circle with a small radius has a large curvature. This inverse 
relationship is made explicit in the next example.
Finding the Curvature of a Circle
Show that the curvature of a circle of radius is 
Solution
Without loss of generality, you can consider the circle to be centered at the
origin. Let 
be any point on the circle and let be the length of the arc from 
to 
as shown in Figure 12.34. By letting 
be the central angle of the circle, you
can represent the circle by
is the parameter.
Using the formula for the length of a circular arc 
you can rewrite 
in terms
of the arc length parameter as follows.
Arc length is the parameter.
So,
and it follows that 
which implies that the
unit tangent vector is
and the curvature is
at every point on the circle.
Because a straight line doesn’t curve, you would expect its curvature to be 0. Try
checking this by finding the curvature of the line given by

In Example 4, the curvature was found by applying the definition directly. This
requires that the curve be written in terms of the arc length parameter 
The next 
theorem gives two other formulas for finding the curvature of a curve written in terms
of an arbitrary parameter 
The proof of this theorem is left as an exercise [see 
Exercise 84, parts (a) and (b)].
Because 
the first formula implies that curvature is the ratio of the
rate of change in the tangent vector 
to the rate of change in arc length. To see that this
is reasonable, let 
be a “small number.” Then,
In other words, for a given

The next theorem presents a formula for calculating the curvature of a plane curve
given by 
Proof
By representing the curve 
by 
(where 
is the 
parameter), you obtain 
and 
Because 
it follows that the curvature is

Let 
be a curve with curvature 
at point 
The circle passing through point 
with radius 
is called the circle of curvature when the circle lies on the 
concave side of the curve and shares a common tangent line with the curve at point 
The radius is called the radius of curvature at 
and the center of the circle is called
the center of curvature.
The circle of curvature gives you a nice way to estimate the curvature 
at a point
on a curve graphically. Using a compass, you can sketch a circle that lies against the
concave side of the curve at point 
as shown in Figure 12.36. If the circle has a radius
of 
then you can estimate the curvature to be

Solution
The curvature at

Because the curvature at

it follows that the radius of the circle of curvature
at that point is 2. So, the center of curvature is

Arc length and curvature are closely related to the tangential and normal 
components of acceleration. The tangential component of acceleration is the rate of
change of the speed, which in turn is the rate of change of the arc length. This 
component is negative as a moving object slows down and positive as it speeds up—
regardless of whether the object is turning or traveling in a straight line. So, the tangential
component is solely a function of the arc length and is independent of the curvature.
On the other hand, the normal component of acceleration is a function of both
speed and curvature. This component measures the acceleration acting perpendicular to
the direction of motion. To see why the normal component is affected by both speed and
curvature, imagine that you are driving a car around a turn, as shown in Figure 12.38.
When your speed is high and the turn is sharp, you feel yourself thrown against the car
door. By lowering your speed 
taking a more gentle turn, you are able to lessen this
sideways thrust.
The next theorem explicitly states the relationships among speed, curvature, and
the components of acceleration.

Application
There are many applications in physics and engineering dynamics that involve the 
relationships among speed, arc length, curvature, and acceleration. One such 
application concerns frictional force.
A moving object with mass 
is in contact with a stationary object. The total force
required to produce an acceleration along a given path is
The portion of this total force that is supplied by the stationary object is called the force
of friction. For example, when a car moving with constant speed is rounding a turn, the
roadway exerts a frictional force that keeps the car from sliding off the road. If the car
is not sliding, the frictional force is perpendicular to the direction of motion and has
magnitude equal to the normal component of acceleration, as shown in Figure 12.39.
The potential frictional force of a road around a turn can be increased by banking the
roadway.
The force of friction is perpendicular to the direction of motion.
Figure 12.39
Frictional Force
A 360-kilogram go-cart is driven at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour around a 
circular racetrack of radius 12 meters, as shown in Figure 12.40. To keep the cart from
skidding off course, what frictional force must the track surface exert on the tires?
Solution
The frictional force must equal the mass times the normal component of
acceleration. For this circular path, you know that the curvature is

Functions of Several Variables
13.1 Introduction to Functions of Several Variables
Understand the notation for a function of several variables.
Sketch the graph of a function of two variables.
Sketch level curves for a function of two variables.
Sketch level surfaces for a function of three variables.
Use computer graphics to graph a function of two variables.
Functions of Several Variables
So far in this text, you have dealt only with functions of a single (independent) variable.
Many familiar quantities, however, are functions of two or more variables. Here are
three examples.
1. The work done by a force,
is a function of two variables.
2. The volume of a right circular cylinder,
is a function of two variables.
3. The volume of a rectangular solid,
is a function of three variables.
The notation for a function of two or more variables is similar to that for a function of
a single variable. Here are two examples.
Function of two variables
2 variables
and
Function of three variables
3 variables
Similar definitions can be given for functions of three, four, or 
variables, where
the domains consist of ordered triples 
quadruples 
and
tuples 
In all cases, the range is a set of real numbers. In this
chapter, you will study only functions of two or three variables.
As with functions of one variable, the most common way to describe a function of
several variables is with an equation, and unless it is otherwise restricted, you can
assume that the domain is the set of all points for which the equation is defined.
For instance, the domain of the function
is the entire 
-plane. Similarly, the domain of
is the set of all points 
in the plane for which 
This consists of all points in
the first and third quadrants.

MARY FAIRFAX SOMERVILLE
(1780–1872)
Somerville was interested in the
problem of creating geometric
models for functions of several
variables. Her most well-known
book, The Mechanics of the
Heavens, was published in 1831.

a. The function is defined for all points

and
So, the domain is the set of all points lying on or outside the circle 
except those points on the 
axis, as shown in Figure 13.1.
b. The function is defined for all points 
such that
Consequently, the domain is the set of all points 
lying inside a sphere of
radius 3 that is centered at the origin.
Functions of several variables can be combined in the same ways as functions of
single variables. For instance, you can form the sum, difference, product, and quotient
of two functions of two variables as follows.
You cannot form the composite of two functions of several variables. You can, however,
form the composite function 
where is a function of a single variable and
is a function of two variables.
Composition
The domain of this composite function consists of all 
in the domain of such that
is in the domain of 
For example, the function
can be viewed as the composite of the function of two variables given by 
and the function of a single variable given by
The domain of this function is the set of all points lying on or inside the ellipse
A function that can be written as a sum of functions of the form 
(where is
a real number and 
and 
are nonnegative integers) is called a polynomial
function of two variables. For instance, the functions
and
are polynomial functions of two variables. A rational function is the quotient of two
polynomial functions. Similar terminology is used for functions of more than two variables.

The Graph of a Function of Two Variables
As with functions of a single variable, you can learn a lot about the behavior of a function
of two variables by sketching its graph. The graph of a function of two variables is
the set of all points 
for which 
and 
is in the domain of 
This
graph can be interpreted geometrically as a surface in space, as discussed in Sections
11.5 and 11.6. In Figure 13.2, note that the graph of 
is a surface whose 
projection onto the 
plane is 
the domain of 
To each point 
in 
there 
corresponds a point 
on the surface, and, conversely, to each point 
on the
surface there corresponds a point

From Section 11.6, you know that the graph of is the upper half of an ellipsoid, as
shown in Figure 13.3.
To sketch a surface in space by hand, it helps to use traces in planes parallel to the
coordinate planes, as shown in Figure 13.3. For example, to find the trace of the surface
in the plane 
substitute 
in the equation 
and obtain
So, the trace is an ellipse centered at the point 
with major and minor axes of
lengths
and
Traces are also used with most three-dimensional graphing utilities. For instance,
Figure 13.4 shows a computer-generated version of the surface given in Example 2. For
this graph, the computer took 25 traces parallel to the 
plane and 12 traces in vertical
planes.
If you have access to a three-dimensional graphing utility, use it to graph several
surfaces.

Level Curves
A second way to visualize a function of two variables is to use a scalar field in which
the scalar
is assigned to the point 
A scalar field can be characterized by level curves (or
contour lines) along which the value of 
is constant. For instance, the weather
map in Figure 13.5 shows level curves of equal pressure called isobars. In weather
maps for which the level curves represent points of equal temperature, the level curves
are called isotherms, as shown in Figure 13.6. Another common use of level curves is
in representing electric potential fields. In this type of map, the level curves are called
equipotential lines.
Level curves show the lines of equal
Level curves show the lines of equal
pressure (isobars), measured in millibars.
temperature (isotherms), measured in 
degrees Fahrenheit.
Figure 13.5
Figure 13.6
Contour maps are commonly used to show regions on Earth’s surface, with the
level curves representing the height above sea level. This type of map is called a
topographic map. For example, the mountain shown in Figure 13.7 is represented by
the topographic map in Figure 13.8.
Figure 13.8
A contour map depicts the variation of 
with respect to 
and 
by the spacing
between level curves. Much space between level curves indicates that 
is changing
slowly, whereas little space indicates a rapid change in 
Furthermore, to produce a
good three-dimensional illusion in a contour map, it is important to choose values that
are evenly spaced.

One example of a function of two variables used in economics is the Cobb-
Douglas production function. This function is used as a model to represent the
numbers of units produced by varying amounts of labor and capital. If measures the
units of labor and measures the units of capital, then the number of units produced is

Level Surfaces
Describe the level surfaces of
Solution
Each level surface has an equation of the form
Equation of level surface
So, the level surfaces are ellipsoids (whose cross sections parallel to the 
plane are
circles). As increases, the radii of the circular cross sections increase according to the
square root of 
For example, the level surfaces corresponding to the values 
and 
are as follows.
Level surface for 
(single point)
Level surface for 
(ellipsoid)
Level surface for 
(ellipsoid)
These level surfaces are shown in Figure 13.15.
If the function in Example 6 represented the temperature at the point 
then
the level surfaces shown in Figure 13.15 would be called isothermal surfaces.
Computer Graphics
The problem of sketching the graph of a surface in space can be simplified by using a
computer. Although there are several types of three-dimensional graphing utilities, most
use some form of trace analysis to give the illusion of three dimensions. To use such a
graphing utility, you usually need to enter the equation of the surface and the region in
the 
plane over which the surface is to be plotted. (You might also need to enter the
number of traces to be taken.) For instance, to graph the surface
you might choose the following bounds for 
and 
Bounds for 
Bounds for 
Bounds for 
Figure 13.16 shows a computer-generated graph
of this surface using 26 traces taken parallel to 
the 
plane. To heighten the three-dimensional
effect, the program uses a “hidden line” routine.
That is, it begins by plotting the traces in the 
foreground (those corresponding to the largest 
values), and then, as each new trace is plotted,
the program determines whether all or only part 
of the next trace should be shown.
The graphs on the next page show a variety 
of surfaces that were plotted by computer. If you
have access to a computer drawing program, use 
it to reproduce these surfaces. Remember also 
that the three-dimensional graphics in this text 
can be viewed and rotated. These rotatable graphs 
are available at LarsonCalculus.com.

81. Ideal Gas Law
According to the Ideal Gas Law,
where 
is pressure,
is volume,
is temperature (in kelvins),
and 
is a constant of proportionality. A tank contains 
2000 cubic inches of nitrogen at a pressure of 26 pounds per
square inch and a temperature of 300 K.
(a) Determine 
(b) Write as a function of and and describe the level curves.
82. Modeling Data
The table shows the net sales 
(in 
billions of dollars), the total assets 
(in billions of dollars),
and the shareholder’s equity (in billions of dollars) for Apple
for the years 2006 through 2011.
(Source: Apple Inc.)
A model for these data is
(a) Use a graphing utility and the model to approximate for
the given values of and 
(b) Which of the two variables in this model has the greater
influence on shareholder’s equity? Explain.
(c) Simplify the expression for 
and interpret its
meaning in the context of the problem.
83. Meteorology
Meteorologists measure the atmospheric
pressure in millibars. From these observations, they create
weather maps on which the curves of equal atmospheric
pressure (isobars), are drawn (see figure). On the map, the
closer the isobars, the higher the wind speed. Match points 
and 
with (a) highest pressure, (b) lowest pressure, and 
(c) highest wind velocity.

84. Acid Rain
The acidity of rainwater is measured in units
called pH. A pH of 7 is neutral, smaller values are increasingly
acidic, and larger values are increasingly alkaline. The map
shows curves of equal pH and gives evidence that downwind
of heavily industrialized areas, the acidity has been increasing.
Using the level curves on the map, determine the direction of
the prevailing winds in the northeastern United States.
85. Construction Cost
A rectangular box with an open top
has a length of feet, a width of feet, and a height of feet.
It costs $1.20 per square foot to build the base and $0.75 per
square foot to build the sides. Write the cost 
of constructing
the box as a function of 
and 
True or False?
In Exercises 87–90, determine whether the
statement is true or false. If it is false, explain why or give an
example that shows it is false.

13.2 Limits and Continuity
Understand the definition of a neighborhood in the plane.
Understand and use the definition of the limit of a function of two variables.
Extend the concept of continuity to a function of two variables.
Extend the concept of continuity to a function of three variables.
Neighborhoods in the Plane
In this section, you will study limits and continuity involving functions of two or three
variables. The section begins with functions of two variables. At the end of the section,
the concepts are extended to functions of three variables.
Your study of the limit of a function of two variables begins by defining a 
two-dimensional analog to an interval on the real number line. Using the formula for
the distance between two points
and
in the plane, you can define the -neighborhood about 
to be the disk centered
at 
with radius 
Open disk
as shown in Figure 13.17. When this formula contains the less than inequality sign,
the disk is called open, and when it contains the less than or equal to inequality 
sign,
the disk is called closed. This corresponds to the use of 
and 
to define open
and closed intervals.

point of 
if every open disk centered at

By definition, a region must contain its interior points, but it need not contain its
boundary points. If a region contains all its boundary points, then the region is closed.
A region that contains some but not all of its boundary points is neither open nor closed.

SONYA KOVALEVSKY (1850–1891)
Much of the terminology used to
define limits and continuity of a
function of two or three variables
was introduced by the German
mathematician Karl Weierstrass
(1815–1897).Weierstrass’s 
rigorous approach to limits and
other topics in calculus gained him
the reputation as the “father of
modern analysis.” Weierstrass 
was a gifted teacher. One of his 
best-known students was the
Russian mathematician Sonya
Kovalevsky, who applied many 
of Weierstrass’s techniques to 
problems in mathematical physics
and became one of the first
women to gain acceptance as a
research mathematician.

Limit of a Function of Two Variables
Graphically, the definition of the limit 
of a function of two variables implies that 
for any point 
in the disk of
radius 
the value 
lies between
and 
as shown in Figure 13.19.
The definition of the limit of a function 
of two variables is similar to the definition 
of the limit of a function of a single variable,
yet there is a critical difference. To determine
whether a function of a single variable has a 
limit, you need only test the approach from 
two directions—from the right and from the 
left. When the function approaches the same
limit from the right and from the left, you 
can conclude that the limit exists. For a 
function of two variables, however, the 
statement
means that the point 
is allowed to approach 
from any direction. If the value of
is not the same for all possible approaches, or paths, to 
then the limit does not exist.

You need to show that for each 
there
exists a -neighborhood about 
such that

Limits of functions of several variables have the same properties regarding sums,
differences, products, and quotients as do limits of functions of single variables. (See
Theorem 2.2 in Section 2.3.) Some of these properties are used in the next example.
Verifying a Limit
Evaluate
Solution
By using the properties of limits of products and sums, you obtain
and 
Because the limit of a quotient is equal to the quotient of the limits (and the denominator
is not 0), you have
Verifying a Limit
Evaluate 
Solution
In this case, the limits of the numerator and of the denominator are both 0,
and so you cannot determine the existence (or nonexistence) of a limit by taking the
limits of the numerator and denominator separately and then dividing. From the graph
of in Figure 13.20, however, it seems reasonable that the limit might be 0. So, you can
try applying the definition to

For some functions, it is easy to recognize that a limit does not exist. For instance,
it is clear that the limit
does not exist because the values of 
increase without bound as 
approaches
along any path (see Figure 13.21).
For other functions, it is not so easy to recognize that a limit does not exist. For
instance, the next example describes a limit that does not exist because the function
approaches different values along different paths.
A Limit That Does Not Exist
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Show that the limit does not exist.
Solution
The domain of the function
consists of all points in the 
plane except for the point 
To show that the limit
as 
approaches 
does not exist, consider approaching 
along two
different “paths,” as shown in Figure 13.22. Along the axis, every point is of the form
and the limit along this approach is
Limit along 
axis
However, when 
approaches 
along the line 
you obtain
Limit along line 
This means that in any open disk centered
at 
there are points 
at which 
takes on the value 1, and other points at
which takes on the value 0. For instance,
at 
and 
and
at 
and 
So,
does not have 
a limit as 
approaches 
In Example 4, you could conclude that the limit does not exist because you found
two approaches that produced different limits. Be sure you understand that when two
approaches produce the same limit, you cannot conclude that the limit exists. To form
such a conclusion, you must show that the limit is the same along all possible approaches.

Continuity of a Function of Two Variables
Notice in Example 2 that the limit of 
as 
can
be evaluated by direct substitution. That is, the limit is 
In such cases, the
function is said to be continuous at the point 
In Example 3, it was shown that the function
is not continuous at 
Because the limit at this point exists, however, you can
remove the discontinuity by defining at 
as being equal to its limit there. Such a
discontinuity is called removable. In Example 4, the function
was also shown not to be continuous at 
but this discontinuity is nonremovable.
Theorem 13.1 establishes the continuity of polynomial and rational functions at
every point in their domains. Furthermore, the continuity of other types of functions can
be extended naturally from one to two variables. For instance, the functions whose
graphs are shown in Figures 13.23 and 13.24 are continuous at every point in the plane.

Functions of Several Variables
13.3 Partial Derivatives
Find and use partial derivatives of a function of two variables.
Find and use partial derivatives of a function of three or more variables.
Find higher-order partial derivatives of a function of two or three variables.
Partial Derivatives of a Function of Two Variables
In applications of functions of several variables, the question often arises, “How will
the value of a function be affected by a change in one of its independent variables?”You
can answer this by considering the independent variables one at a time. For example, to
determine the effect of a catalyst in an experiment, a chemist could conduct the
experiment several times using varying amounts of the catalyst, while keeping constant
other variables such as temperature and pressure. You can use a similar procedure to
determine the rate of change of a function with respect to one of its several independent
variables. This process is called partial differentiation, and the result is referred to as
the partial derivative of with respect to the chosen independent variable.
This definition indicates that if 
then to find 
you consider constant
and differentiate with respect to 
Similarly, to find 
you consider 
constant and
differentiate with respect to

JEAN LE ROND D’ALEMBERT
(1717–1783)
The introduction of partial 
derivatives followed Newton’s 
and Leibniz’s work in calculus by 
several years. Between 1730 and
1760, Leonhard Euler and Jean Le
Rond d’Alembert separately 
published several papers on
dynamics, in which they 
established much of the theory of
partial derivatives.These papers
used functions of two or more
variables to study problems
involving equilibrium, fluid motion,
and vibrating strings.

Partial Derivatives of a Function of Three or More Variables
The concept of a partial derivative can be extended naturally to functions of three or
more variables. For instance, if 
then there are three partial derivatives,
each of which is formed by holding two of the variables constant. That is, to define the
partial derivative of 
with respect to 
consider 
and 
to be constant and
differentiate with respect to 
A similar process is used to find the derivatives of 
with
respect to and with respect to 
In general, if 
then there are partial derivatives denoted by
To find the partial derivative with respect to one of the variables, hold the other
variables constant and differentiate with respect to the given variable.

Higher-Order Partial Derivatives
As is true for ordinary derivatives, it is possible to take second, third, and higher-order
partial derivatives of a function of several variables, provided such derivatives exist.
Higher-order derivatives are denoted by the order in which the differentiation occurs.
For instance, the function 
has the following second partial derivatives.
1. Differentiate twice with respect to 
2. Differentiate twice with respect to 
3. Differentiate first with respect to and then with respect to 
4. Differentiate first with respect to and then with respect to 
The third and fourth cases are called mixed partial derivatives.

REMARK
Note that the two
types of notation for mixed 
partials have different conventions
for indicating the order of 
differentiation.
You can remember the order by
observing that in both notations
you differentiate first with respect
to the variable “nearest” f.

Functions of Several Variables
111. Psychology
Early in the twentieth century,
an 
intelligence test called the Stanford-Binet Test (more 
commonly known as the IQ test) was developed. In this test,
an individual’s mental age 
is divided by the individual’s
chronological age 
and the quotient is multiplied by 100.
The result is the individual’s 
Find the partial derivatives of

Differentiability
In Section 4.8, you learned that for a differentiable function given by 
you can
use the differential 
as an approximation for small 
of the value
When a similar approximation is possible for a function of
two variables, the function is said to be differentiable. This is stated explicitly in the
next definition.
Showing that a Function Is Differentiable
Show that the function
is differentiable at every point in the plane.
Solution
Letting 
the increment of 
at an arbitrary point 
in the 
plane is
Increment of
where 
and 
Because 
and 
as 
it follows
that 
is differentiable at every point in the plane. The graph of 
is shown in
Figure 13.34.
Be sure you see that the term “differentiable” is used differently for functions of
two variables than for functions of one variable. A function of one variable is 
differentiable at a point when its derivative exists at the point. For a function of two
variables, however, the existence of the partial derivatives 
and 
does not guarantee
that the function is differentiable (see Example 5). The next theorem gives a sufficient
condition for differentiability of a function of two variables.

Approximation by Differentials
Theorem 13.4 tells you that you can choose 
close enough to 
to
make 
and 
insignificant. In other words, for small 
and 
you can use
the approximation
This approximation is illustrated graphically in Figure 13.35. Recall that the partial
derivatives 
and 
can be interpreted as the slopes of the surface in the 
and 
directions. This means that
represents the change in height of a plane that is tangent to the surface at the point
Because a plane in space is represented by a linear equation in the
variables 
and 
the approximation of 
by 
is called a linear approximation.
You will learn more about this geometric interpretation in Section 13.7.
Using a Differential as an Approximation
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Use the differential 
to approximate the change in 
as 
moves
from the point 
to the point 
Compare this approximation with the
exact change in 
Solution
Letting 
and 
produces
and
So, the change in can be approximated by
When 
and 
you have
In Figure 13.36, you can see that the exact change corresponds to the difference in the
heights of two points on the surface of a hemisphere. This difference is given by
A function of three variables 
is differentiable at 
provided that
can be written in the form
where 
and 
as 
With this definition of 
differentiability, Theorem 13.4 has the following extension for functions of three 
variables: If is a function of 
and 
where 
and are continuous in an open
region 
then is differentiable on 
In Section 4.8, you used differentials to approximate the propagated error introduced
by an error in measurement. This application of differentials is further illustrated in
Example 4.

Error Analysis
The possible error involved in measuring each dimension of a rectangular box is
millimeter. The dimensions of the box are 
centimeters,
centimeters,
and 
centimeters, as shown in Figure 13.37. Use 
to estimate the propagated
error and the relative error in the calculated volume of the box.
Solution
The volume of the box is 
and so
Using 0.1 millimeter
centimeter, you have
and the propagated error is approximately
cubic centimeters.
Because the measured volume is
cubic centimeters,
the relative error,
is approximately

A Function That Is Not Differentiable
For the function
show that 
and 
both exist, but that is not differentiable at 
Solution
You can show that is not differentiable at 
by showing that it is not
continuous at this point. To see that is not continuous at 
look at the values of
along two different approaches to 
as shown in Figure 13.38. Along the line
the limit is
whereas along 
you have
So, the limit of 
as 
does not exist, and you can conclude that is
not continuous at 
Therefore, by Theorem 13.5, you know that is not differentiable
at 
On the other hand, by the definition of the partial derivatives and 
you have
and
So, the partial derivatives at 
exist.

Find directional derivatives and gradients of functions of three variables.
Directional Derivative
You are standing on the hillside represented 
by 
in Figure 13.42 and want to 
determine the hill’s incline toward the axis. 
You already know how to determine the slopes 
in two different directions—the slope in the 
direction is given by the partial derivative
and the slope in the 
direction is 
given by the partial derivative 
In this
section, you will see that these two partial 
derivatives can be used to find the slope in 
any direction.
To determine the slope at a point on 
a surface, you will define a new type of 
derivative called a directional derivative.
Begin by letting 
be a surface and 
be a point in the domain of 
as
shown in Figure 13.43. The “direction” of the directional derivative is given by a unit
vector
where is the angle the vector makes with the positive axis. To find the desired slope,
reduce the problem to two dimensions by intersecting the surface with a vertical plane
passing through the point 
and parallel to 
as shown in Figure 13.44. This vertical
plane intersects the surface to form a curve 
The slope of the surface at
in the direction of is defined as the slope of the curve 
at that point.
Informally, you can write the slope of the curve 
as a limit that looks much like
those used in single-variable calculus. The vertical plane used to form 
intersects the
plane in a line 
represented by the parametric equations
and
so that for any value of 
the point 
lies on the line 
For each of the points 
and 
there is a corresponding point on the surface.
Point above
Point above 
Moreover, because the distance between 
and 
is
you can write the slope of the secant line through 
and 
as 
Finally, by letting approach 0, you arrive at the definition on the next page.

The Gradient of a Function of Two Variables
The gradient of a function of two variables is a vector-valued function of two variables.
This function has many important uses, some of which are described later in this section.
Notice that no value is assigned to the symbol 
by itself. It is an operator in the
same sense that 
is an operator. When 
operates on 
it produces the vector

the gradient is
Because the gradient of is a vector, you can write the directional derivative of in
the direction of 
as
In other words, the directional derivative is the dot product of the gradient and the 
direction vector. This useful result is summarized in the next theorem.

Applications of the Gradient

a surface. In many applications, you may want to know in which direction to move so
that 
increases most rapidly. This direction is called the direction of steepest
ascent, and it is given by the gradient, as stated in the next theorem.

To visualize one of the properties of the gradient, imagine a skier coming down a
mountainside. If 
denotes the altitude of the skier, then 
indicates the
compass direction the skier should take to ski the path of steepest descent. (Remember
that the gradient indicates direction in the

the mountainside.)

point 
on a flat metal plate. In this case,
gives the direction of greatest 
temperature increase at the point 
as illustrated in the next example.
Finding the Direction of Maximum Increase
The temperature in degrees Celsius on the surface of a metal plate is
where 
and 
are measured in centimeters. In what direction from 
does the
temperature increase most rapidly? What is this rate of increase?
Solution
The gradient is
It follows that the direction of maximum increase is given by

The solution presented in Example 5 can be misleading. Although the gradient
points in the direction of maximum temperature increase, it does not necessarily point
toward the hottest spot on the plate. In other words, the gradient provides a local
solution to finding an increase relative to the temperature at the point 
Once you
leave that position, the direction of maximum increase may change.
Finding the Path of a Heat-Seeking Particle
A heat-seeking particle is located at the point 
on a metal plate whose temperature

is
Find the path of the particle as it continuously moves in the direction of maximum 
temperature increase.
Solution
Let the path be represented by the position vector
A tangent vector at each point 
is given by
Because the particle seeks maximum temperature increase, the directions of 
and
are the same at each point on the path. So,
and
where depends on 
By solving each equation for

obtain
The solution of this differential equation is 
Because the particle starts at the
point 
you can determine that 
So, the path of the heat-seeking
particle is
The path is shown in Figure 13.52.
In Figure 13.52, the path of the particle (determined by the gradient at each point)
appears to be orthogonal to each of the level curves. This becomes clear when you 
consider that the temperature 
is constant along a given level curve. So, at any
point 
on the curve, the rate of change of 
in the direction of a unit tangent 
vector 
is 0, and you can write

Because the dot product of

Functions of Three Variables
The definitions of the directional derivative and the gradient can be extended naturally to
functions of three or more variables. As often happens, some of the geometric interpretation
is lost in the generalization from functions of two variables to those of three variables. For
example, you cannot interpret the directional derivative of a function of three variables as
representing slope.
The definitions and properties of the directional derivative and the gradient of a
function of three variables are listed below.

Tangent Plane and Normal Line to a Surface
So far, you have represented surfaces in space primarily by equations of the form
Equation of a surface 
In the development to follow, however, it is convenient to use the more general 
representation 
For a surface 
given by 
you can convert to
the general form by defining 
as
Because 
you can consider to be the level surface of 
given by
Alternative equation of surface 
Writing an Equation of a Surface
For the function
describe the level surface given by
Solution
The level surface given by 
can be written as
which is a sphere of radius 2 whose center is at the origin.
You have seen many examples of the 
usefulness of normal lines in applications 
involving curves. Normal lines are equally 
important in analyzing surfaces and solids.
For example, consider the collision of two 
billiard balls. When a stationary ball is struck 
at a point 
on its surface, it moves along the 
line of impact determined by 
and the center 
of the ball. The impact can occur in two ways.
When the cue ball is moving along the line 
of impact, it stops dead and imparts all of its
momentum to the stationary ball, as shown in
Figure 13.55. When the cue ball is not moving
along the line of impact, it is deflected to 
one side or the other and retains part of its 
momentum. The part of the momentum that is
transferred to the stationary ball occurs along 
the line of impact, regardless of the direction 
of the cue ball, as shown in Figure 13.56. This 
line of impact is called the normal line to the 
surface of the ball at the point P.

In the process of finding a normal line to a surface, you are also able to solve the
problem of finding a tangent plane to the surface. Let be a surface given by 
and let 
be a point on 
Let 
be a curve on 
through 
that is defined by
the vector-valued function 
Then, for all 
If 
is differentiable and 
and 
all exist, then it follows from the Chain
Rule that
At 
the equivalent vector form is
Gradient
This result means that the gradient at 
is orthogonal to the tangent vector of every
curve on 
through 
So, all tangent lines on 
lie in a plane that is normal to
and contains 
as shown in Figure 13.57.
To find an equation for the tangent plane to 
at 
let 
be an
arbitrary point in the tangent plane. Then the vector
lies in the tangent plane. Because 
is normal to the tangent plane at
it must be orthogonal to every vector in the tangent plane, and you have
which leads to the next theorem.

Knowing that the gradient 
is normal to the surface given by
allows you to solve a variety of problems dealing with surfaces and
curves in space.
Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line to a Curve
Describe the tangent line to the curve of intersection of the ellipsoid
Ellipsoid
and the paraboloid
Paraboloid
at the point (0, 1, 3), as shown in Figure 13.61.
Solution
Begin by finding the gradients to both surfaces at the point (0, 1, 3).
Ellipsoid
Paraboloid
The cross product of these two gradients is a vector that is tangent to both surfaces at
the point 
So, the tangent line to the curve of intersection of the two surfaces at the point 
is a line that is parallel to the 
axis and passes through the point 
The Angle of Inclination of a Plane
Another use of the gradient
is to determine the angle of inclination of the tangent plane to a surface. The angle of
inclination of a plane is defined as the angle 
between the given plane
and the 
plane, as shown in Figure 13.62. (The angle of inclination of a horizontal
plane is defined as zero.) Because the vector 
is normal to the 
plane, you can use
the formula for the cosine of the angle between two planes (given in Section 11.5) to
conclude that the angle of inclination of a plane with normal vector 
is
Angle of inclination of a plane

Finding the Angle of Inclination of a Tangent Plane
Find the angle of inclination of the tangent plane to the ellipsoid
at the point 
Solution
Begin by letting
Then, the gradient of 
at the point 
is
Because 
is normal to the tangent plane and 
is normal to the 
plane, it
follows that the angle of inclination of the tangent plane is
which implies that
as shown in Figure 13.63.
A special case of the procedure shown in Example 6 is worth noting. The angle of 
inclination of the tangent plane to the surface 
at 
is 
A Comparison of the Gradients 
and 
This section concludes with a comparison of the gradients 
and 
In the preceding section, you saw that the gradient of a function of two variables is
normal to the level curves of 
Specifically, Theorem 13.12 states that if 
is
differentiable at 
and 
then 
is normal to the level curve
through 
Having developed normal lines to surfaces, you can now extend this
result to a function of three variables. The proof of Theorem 13.14 is left as an exercise
(see Exercise 68).
When working with the gradients 
and 
be sure you remember
that 
is a vector in the 
plane and 
is a vector in space.

Functions of Several Variables
13.8 Extrema of Functions of Two Variables
Find absolute and relative extrema of a function of two variables.
Use the Second Partials Test to find relative extrema of a function of two variables.
Absolute Extrema and Relative Extrema
In Chapter 4, you studied techniques for finding the extreme values of a function of a
single variable. In this section, you will extend these techniques to functions of two
variables. For example, in Theorem 13.15 below, the Extreme Value Theorem for a
function of a single variable is extended to a function of two variables.
Consider the continuous function of two variables, defined on a closed bounded
region 
The values 
and 
such that
and 
are in 
for all 
in 
are called the minimum and maximum of in the region 
as shown
in Figure 13.64. Recall from Section 13.2 that a region in the plane is closed when it
contains all of its boundary points. The Extreme Value Theorem deals with a region in
the plane that is both closed and bounded. A region in the plane is bounded when it is
a subregion of a closed disk in the plane.
A minimum is also called an absolute minimum and a maximum is also called an
absolute maximum. As in single-variable calculus, there is a distinction made between
absolute extrema and relative extrema.
To say that has a relative maximum at 
means that the point 
is
at least as high as all nearby points on the graph of
Similarly,
has a relative minimum at 
when 
is at least as low as all
nearby points on the graph. (See Figure 13.65.)

a horizontal tangent plane at the point

such a point is a likely location of a relative extremum. This is confirmed by Theorem 13.16.

KARL WEIERSTRASS (1815–1897)
Although the Extreme Value
Theorem had been used by earlier
mathematicians, the first to 
provide a rigorous proof was the
German mathematician Karl
Weierstrass.Weierstrass also
provided rigorous justifications for
many other mathematical results
already in common use.We are
indebted to him for much of 
the logical foundation on which 
modern calculus is built.

The Second Partials Test
Theorem 13.16 tells you that to find relative extrema, you need only examine values of
at critical points. However, as is true for a function of one variable, the critical
points of a function of two variables do not always yield relative maxima or minima.
Some critical points yield saddle points, which are neither relative maxima nor relative
minima.
As an example of a critical point that does not
yield a relative extremum, consider the hyperbolic
paraboloid
as shown in Figure 13.69. At the point 
both partial derivatives
and
are 0. The function does not, however, have a 
relative extremum at this point because in any 
open disk centered at 
the function takes 
on both negative values (along the 
axis) and
positive values (along the 
axis). So, the point
is a saddle point of the surface. (The 
term “saddle point” comes from the fact that 
surfaces such as the one shown in Figure 13.69 
resemble saddles.)
For the functions in Examples 1 and 2, it was relatively easy to determine the relative
extrema, because each function was either given, or able to be written, in completed
square form. For more complicated functions, algebraic arguments are less convenient
and it is better to rely on the analytic means presented in the following Second Partials
Test. This is the two-variable counterpart of the Second Derivative Test for functions of
one variable. The proof of this theorem is best left to a course in advanced calculus.
A convenient device for remembering the formula for in the Second Partials Test
is given by the 
determinant

Absolute extrema of a function can occur in two ways. First, some relative extrema
also happen to be absolute extrema. For instance, in Example 1,
is an absolute
minimum of the function. (On the other hand, the relative maximum found in Example 3
is not an absolute maximum of the function.) Second, absolute extrema can occur at a
boundary point of the domain. This is illustrated in Example 5.
Finding Absolute Extrema
Find the absolute extrema of the function
on the closed region given by
and
Solution
From the partial derivatives
and
you can see that each point lying on the hyperbola 
is a critical point. These
points each yield the value
which you know is the absolute maximum, as 
shown in Figure 13.72. The only other critical 
point of lying in the given region is 
It 
yields an absolute minimum of 0, because
implies that
To locate other absolute extrema, you should 
consider the four boundaries of the region formed 
by taking traces with the vertical planes 
and 
In doing this, you will 
find that 
at all points on the 
axis,
at all points on the 
axis, and at the point 
Each of these points yields an absolute minimum
for the surface, as shown in Figure 13.72.
The concepts of relative extrema and critical points can be extended to functions of
three or more variables. When all first partial derivatives of
exist, it can be shown that a relative maximum or minimum can occur at
only when every first partial derivative is 0 at that point. This means
that the critical points are obtained by solving the following system of equations.
The extension of Theorem 13.17 to three or more variables is also possible, although
you will not consider such an extension in this text.

In this section, you will survey a few of the many applications of extrema of functions
of two (or more) variables.
Finding Maximum Volume
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
A rectangular box is resting on the 
plane with one vertex at the origin. The opposite
vertex lies in the plane
as shown in Figure 13.73. Find the maximum volume of such a box.
Solution
Let 
and 
represent the length, width, and height of the box. Because 
one vertex of the box lies in the plane 
you know that
and you can write the volume 
of the box as a function of two
variables.
Next, find the first partial derivatives of 
Note that the first partial derivatives are defined for all and 
So, by setting 
and 
equal to 0 and solving the equations 
and
you obtain the critical points 
and 
At 
the
volume is 0, so that point does not yield a maximum volume. At the point 
you
can apply the Second Partials Test.
Because
and
you can conclude from the Second Partials Test that the maximum volume is
cubic units.
Note that the volume is 0 at the boundary points of the triangular domain of V.

REMARK
In many applied
problems, the domain of the
function to be optimized is a
closed bounded region. To find
minimum or maximum points,
you must not only test critical
points, but also consider the 
values of the function at points
on the boundary.

Applications of extrema in economics and business often involve more than one
independent variable. For instance, a company may produce several models of one type
of product. The price per unit and profit per unit are usually different for each model.
Moreover, the demand for each model is often a function of the prices of the other models
(as well as its own price). The next example illustrates an application involving two
products.
Finding the Maximum Profit
An electronics manufacturer determines that the profit 
(in dollars) obtained by
producing and selling units of an LCD television and units of a plasma television is
approximated by the model
Find the production level that produces a maximum profit. What is the maximum profit?
Solution
The partial derivatives of the profit function are
and
By setting these partial derivatives equal to 0, you obtain the following system of equations.
After simplifying, this system of linear equations can be written as
.
Solving this system produces 
and 
The second partial derivatives
of 
are
Because 
and 
is greater than 0, you can conclude that the production level of 
units and
units yields a maximum profit. The maximum profit is
In Example 2, it was assumed that the manufacturing plant is able to produce the
required number of units to yield a maximum profit. In actual practice, the production
would be bounded by physical constraints. You will study such constrained optimization
problems in the next section.

The Method of Least Squares
Many of the examples in this text have involved mathematical models. For instance,
Example 2 involves a quadratic model for profit. There are several ways to develop such
models; one is called the method of least squares.
In constructing a model to represent a particular phenomenon, the goals are
simplicity and accuracy. Of course, these goals often conflict. For instance, a simple 
linear model for the points in Figure 13.74 is
However, Figure 13.75 shows that by choosing the slightly more complicated quadratic
model
you can achieve greater accuracy.
Figure 13.74
Figure 13.75
As a measure of how well the model 
fits the collection of points
you can add the squares of the differences between the actual 
values and the values
given by the model to obtain the sum of the squared errors
Sum of the squared errors
Graphically,
can be interpreted as the sum of the
squares of the vertical distances between the graph
of and the given points in the plane, as shown in
Figure 13.76. If the model is perfect, then 
However, when perfection is not feasible, you can
settle for a model that minimizes 
For instance,
the sum of the squared errors for the linear model 
in Figure 13.74 is
Statisticians call the linear model that minimizes 
the least squares regression line. The proof 
that this line actually minimizes involves the 
minimizing of a function of two variables.

Proof
Let 
represent the sum of the squared errors for the model
and the given set of points. That is,
where the points 
represent constants. Because is a function of and 
you can
use the methods discussed in the preceding section to find the minimum value of 
Specifically, the first partial derivatives of are
and 
By setting these two partial derivatives equal to 0, you obtain the values of and that
are listed in the theorem. It is left to you to apply the Second Partials Test (see 
Exercise 41) to verify that these values of and yield a minimum. 
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
If the 
values are symmetrically spaced about the 
axis, then 
and the
formulas for 
and 
simplify to
and
This simplification is often possible with a translation of the 
values. For instance,
given that the values in a data collection consist of the years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012,
and 2013, you could let 2011 be represented by 0.

ADRIEN-MARIE LEGENDRE
(1752–1833)
The method of least squares 
was introduced by the French 
mathematician Adrien-Marie
Legendre. Legendre is best known
for his work in geometry. In fact,
his text Elements of Geometry
was so popular in the United
States that it continued to be
used for 33 editions, spanning a
period of more than 100 years.

An oil company wishes to construct a pipeline from its offshore
facility 
to its refinery 
The offshore facility is 2 miles from
shore, and the refinery is 1 mile inland. Furthermore,
and 
are 
5 miles apart, as shown in the figure.
The cost of building the pipeline is $3 million per mile in the
water and $4 million per mile on land. So, the cost of the pipeline
depends on the location of point 
where it meets the shore. What
would be the most economical route of the pipeline?
Imagine that you are to write a report to the oil company about
this problem. Let be the distance shown in the figure. Determine
the cost of building the pipeline from

Lagrange Multipliers
Understand the Method of Lagrange Multipliers.
Use Lagrange multipliers to solve constrained optimization problems.
Use the Method of Lagrange Multipliers with two constraints.
Lagrange Multipliers
Many optimization problems have restrictions, or constraints, on the values that can be
used to produce the optimal solution. Such constraints tend to complicate optimization
problems because the optimal solution can occur at a boundary point of the domain. In
this section, you will study an ingenious technique for solving such problems. It is
called the Method of Lagrange Multipliers.
To see how this technique works, consider the problem of finding the rectangle of
maximum area that can be inscribed in the ellipse
Let 
be the vertex of the rectangle in the first quadrant, as shown in Figure 13.78.
Because the rectangle has sides of lengths 
and 
its area is given by
Objective function
You want to find and such that 
is a maximum. Your choice of

Now, consider the constraint equation to be a fixed level curve of
The level curves of represent a family of hyperbolas
In this family, the level curves that meet the constraint correspond to the hyperbolas that
intersect the ellipse. Moreover, to maximize 
you want to find the hyperbola that
just barely satisfies the constraint. The level curve that does this is the one that is 
tangent to the ellipse, as shown in Figure 13.79.

LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS
The Method of Lagrange Multipliers
is named after the French 
mathematician Joseph-Louis
Lagrange. Lagrange first introduced
the method in his famous paper
on mechanics, written when he
was just 19 years old.

To find the appropriate hyperbola, use the fact that two curves are tangent at a point
if and only if their gradient vectors are parallel. This means that 
must be a
scalar multiple of 
at the point of tangency. In the context of constrained 
optimization problems, this scalar is denoted by 
(the lowercase Greek letter lambda).
The scalar 
is called a Lagrange multiplier. Theorem 13.19 gives the necessary
conditions for the existence of such multipliers.
Proof
To begin, represent the smooth curve given by 
by the vector-
valued function
where 
and 
are continuous on an open interval 
Define the function 
as
Then, because 
is an extreme value of 
you know that

This implies that 
and, by the Chain Rule,
So,

Moreover, by Theorem 13.12,
is also
orthogonal to 
Consequently, the gradients 
and 
are parallel,
and there must exist a scalar 
such that
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.
The Method of Lagrange Multipliers uses Theorem 13.19 to find the extreme
values of a function subject to a constraint.

As you will 
see in Examples 1 and 2, the
Method of Lagrange Multipliers
requires solving systems of 
nonlinear equations. This 
often can require some tricky
algebraic manipulation.

Solution
Let 
Then, because
and

Constraint
The solution of this system is

So, the optimum value of is
From the original function and constraint, it is clear that 
has no maximum.
So, the optimum value of determined above is a minimum.
A graphical interpretation of constrained optimization problems in two variables
was given at the beginning of this section. In three variables, the interpretation is
similar, except that level surfaces are used instead of level curves. For instance, in
Example 3, the level surfaces of 
are ellipsoids centered at the origin, and the 
constraint
is a plane. The minimum value of is represented by the ellipsoid that is tangent to the
constraint plane, as shown in Figure 13.80.
Optimization Inside a Region
Find the extreme values of
Objective function
subject to the constraint 
Solution
To solve this problem, you can break the constraint into two cases.
a. For points on the circle
you can use Lagrange multipliers to find that
the maximum value of 
is 24—this value occurs at 
and at 
In a similar way, you can determine that the minimum value of 
is approximately
6.675—this value occurs at 
b. For points inside the circle, you can use the techniques discussed in Section 13.8 to
conclude that the function has a relative minimum of 2 at the point 
By combining these two results, you can conclude that 
has a maximum of 24 at
and a minimum of 2 at 
as shown in Figure 13.81.

The Method of Lagrange Multipliers with Two Constraints
For optimization problems involving two constraint functions and 
you can introduce
a second Lagrange multiplier,
(the lowercase Greek letter mu), and then solve the
equation
where the gradient vectors are not parallel, as illustrated in Example 5.

41. Minimum Cost
A cargo container (in the shape of a 
rectangular solid) must have a volume of 480 cubic feet. The
bottom will cost $5 per square foot to construct and the sides
and the top will cost $3 per square foot to construct. Use
Lagrange multipliers to find the dimensions of the container of
this size that has minimum cost.
42. Geometric and Arithmetic Means
(a) Use Lagrange multipliers to prove that the product of three
positive numbers 
and 
whose sum has the constant
value 
is a maximum when the three numbers are equal.
Use this result to prove that 
(b) Generalize the result of part (a) to prove that the product
is a maximum when 
and all 
Then prove that
This shows that the geometric mean is never greater than
the arithmetic mean.
43. Minimum Surface Area
Use Lagrange multipliers to
find the dimensions of a right circular cylinder with volume 
cubic units and minimum surface area.
44. Temperature
Let 
represent
the temperature at each point on the sphere
Find the maximum temperature on the curve formed by the
intersection of the sphere and the plane 
45. Refraction of Light
When light waves traveling in a
transparent medium strike the surface of a second transparent
medium, they tend to “bend” in order to follow the path of
minimum time. This tendency is called refraction and is
described by Snell’s Law of Refraction,
where 
and 
are the magnitudes of the angles shown in the
figure, and 
and 
are the velocities of light in the two
media. Use Lagrange multipliers to derive this law using
46. Area and Perimeter
A semicircle is on top of a rectangle
(see figure). When the area is fixed and the perimeter is a 
minimum, or when the perimeter is fixed and the area is a
maximum, use Lagrange multipliers to verify that the length of
the rectangle is twice its height.
Production Level
In Exercises 47 and 48, find the maximum
production level 
when the total cost of labor (at $72 per unit)
and capital (at $60 per unit) is limited to $250,000, where 
is
the number of units of labor and 
is the number of units of
capital.
47.
48.
Cost
In Exercises 49 and 50, find the minimum cost of
producing 50,000 units of a product, where 
is the number
of units of labor (at $72 per unit) and is the number of units
of capital (at $60 per unit).

a rectangular prism and has a volume of 1000 cubic feet, as

loss through the floor. The heat loss through the four walls is
three times as great as the heat loss through the floor. Determine
the room dimensions that will minimize heat loss and therefore
minimize heating costs.

14.1 Iterated Integrals and Area in the Plane
Evaluate an iterated integral.
Use an iterated integral to find the area of a plane region.
Iterated Integrals
In Chapters 14 and 15, you will study several applications of integration involving functions
of several variables. Chapter 14 is like Chapter 7 in that it surveys the use of integration
to find plane areas, volumes, surface areas, moments, and centers of mass.
In Chapter 13, you saw that it is meaningful to differentiate functions of several
variables with respect to one variable while holding the other variables constant. You can
integrate functions of several variables by a similar procedure. For example, consider
the partial derivative 
By considering 
constant, you can integrate with
respect to to obtain
Integrate with respect to
Hold constant.

Antiderivative of

The “constant” of integration,
is a function of 
In other words, by integrating
with respect to , you are able to recover 
only partially. The total recovery of a
function of and from its partial derivatives is a topic you will study in Chapter 15.
For now, you will focus on extending definite integrals to functions of several variables.
For instance, by considering 
constant, you can apply the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus to evaluate
Similarly, you can integrate with respect to 
by holding 
fixed. Both procedures are
summarized as follows.
Note that the variable of integration cannot appear in either limit of integration. For
instance, it makes no sense to write 


The result is
a function 
of y.
Replace x by
the limits of
integration.

of integration
and y is fixed.

Solution
Using the result of Example 1, you have

The integral in Example 2 is an iterated integral. The brackets used in Example 2
are normally not written. Instead, iterated integrals are usually written simply as
and
The inside limits of integration can be variable with
respect to the outer variable of integration. However,
the outside limits of integration must be constant 
with respect to both variables of integration. After 
performing the inside integration, you obtain a 
“standard” definite integral, and the second integration
produces a real number. The limits of integration for 
an iterated integral identify two sets of boundary 
intervals for the variables. For instance, in Example 2,
the outside limits indicate that lies in the interval
and the inside limits indicate that lies 
in the interval 
Together, these two intervals 
determine the region of integration R of the iterated 
integral, as shown in Figure 14.1.
Because an iterated integral is just a special type 
of definite integral—one in which the integrand is also
an integral—you can use the properties of definite 
integrals to evaluate iterated integrals.

Area of a Plane Region
In the remainder of this section, you will take a new look at an old problem—that of
finding the area of a plane region. Consider the plane region 
bounded by 
and 
as shown in Figure 14.2. The area of 
is
Area of 
Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, you can rewrite the integrand
as a definite integral. Specifically, consider

and you can write
Combining these two integrals, you can write the area of the region 
as an iterated integral
Area of 
Placing a representative rectangle in the region 
helps determine both the order and the limits of
integration. A vertical rectangle implies the order
with the inside limits corresponding to the
upper and lower bounds of the rectangle, as shown
in Figure 14.2. This type of region is vertically 
simple, because the outside limits of integration 
represent the vertical lines
and
Similarly, a horizontal rectangle implies the order
with the inside limits determined by the left
and right bounds of the rectangle, as shown in
Figure 14.3. This type of region is horizontally 
simple, because the outside limits represent the 
horizontal lines
and
The iterated integrals used for these two types of simple regions are summarized as follows.

If all four limits of integration happen to be constants, then the region of integration is
rectangular, as shown in Example 3.
The Area of a Rectangular Region
Use an iterated integral to represent the area of the rectangle shown in Figure 14.4.
Solution
The region shown in Figure 14.4 is both vertically simple and horizontally
simple, so you can use either order of integration. By choosing the order 
you

The region of integration of an iterated integral need not have any straight lines as
boundaries. For instance, the region of integration shown in Figure 14.5 is vertically
simple even though it has no vertical lines as left and right boundaries. The quality that
makes the region vertically simple is that it is bounded above and below by the graphs
of functions of x.

One order of integration will often produce a simpler integration problem than the
other order. For instance, try reworking Example 4 with the order 
—you may be
surprised to see that the task is formidable. However, if you succeed, you will see that
the answer is the same. In other words, the order of integration affects the ease of
integration, but not the value of the integral.
Comparing Different Orders of Integration
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Sketch the region whose area is represented by the integral
Then find another iterated integral using the order 
to represent the same area and
show that both integrals yield the same value.
Solution
From the given limits of integration, you know that

is bounded on the left by the parabola 
and on the

conclude that the inner bounds are 
So, the area of the region can also be

Sometimes it is not possible to calculate the area of a region with a single iterated
integral. In these cases, you can divide the region into subregions such that the area of
each subregion can be calculated by an iterated integral. The total area is then the sum
of the iterated integrals.
An Area Represented by Two Iterated Integrals
Find the area of the region 
that lies below the parabola
Parabola forms upper boundary.
above the 
axis, and above the line
Line and 
axis form lower boundary.
Solution
Begin by dividing 
into the two subregions 
and 
shown in Figure 14.7.
Figure 14.7
In both regions, it is convenient to use vertical rectangles, and you have
The area of the region is 
square units. Try checking this using the procedure for
finding the area between two curves, as presented in Section 7.1.
At this point, you may be wondering why you would need iterated integrals. After
all, you already know how to use conventional integration to find the area of a region
in the plane. (For instance, compare the solution of Example 4 in this section with that
given in Example 3 in Section 7.1.) The need for iterated integrals will become clear in
the next section. In this section, primary attention is given to procedures for finding the
limits of integration of the region of an iterated integral, and the following exercise set
is designed to develop skill in this important procedure.

REMARK
In Examples 3 
through 6, be sure you see the
benefit of sketching the region
of integration. You should 
develop the habit of making
sketches to help you determine
the limits of integration for all
iterated integrals in this chapter.
TECHNOLOGY
Some 
computer software can perform
symbolic integration for integrals
such as those in Example 6. 
If you have access to such 
software, use it to evaluate the
integrals in the exercises and
examples given in this section.

14.2 Double Integrals and Volume
Use a double integral to represent the volume of a solid region and use properties
of double integrals.
Evaluate a double integral as an iterated integral.
Find the average value of a function over a region.
Double Integrals and Volume of a Solid Region
You already know that a definite integral over an interval uses a limit process to assign
measures to quantities such as area, volume, arc length, and mass. In this section, you
will use a similar process to define the double integral of a function of two variables
over a region in the plane.
Consider a continuous function such that

in
the 
plane. The goal is to find the volume of the solid region lying between the surface
given by
Surface lying above the 
plane
and the 
plane, as shown in Figure 14.8. You can begin by superimposing a rectangular
grid over the region, as shown in Figure 14.9. The rectangles lying entirely within 
form an inner partition 
whose norm
is defined as the length of the longest
diagonal of the rectangles. Next, choose a point 
in each rectangle and form the
rectangular prism whose height is
Height of th prism
as shown in Figure 14.10. Because the area of the 
rectangle is 
Area of 
rectangle
it follows that the volume of the 
prism is
Volume of 
prism
and you can approximate the volume of the solid region by the Riemann sum of the volumes
of all prisms,
Riemann sum
as shown in Figure 14.11. This approximation can be improved by tightening the mesh
of the grid to form smaller and smaller rectangles, as shown in Example 1.

Approximating the Volume of a Solid
Approximate the volume of the solid lying between the paraboloid
and the square region 
given by 
Use a partition made up of
squares whose sides have a length of 
Solution
Begin by forming the specified partition of 
For this partition, it is convenient
to choose the centers of the subregions as the points at which to evaluate 
Because the area of each square is 
you can approximate the volume by the
sum
This approximation is shown graphically in Figure 14.12. The exact volume of the solid
is (see Example 2). You can obtain a better approximation by using a finer partition.
For example, with a partition of squares with sides of length 
the approximation
is 0.668.
In Example 1, note that by using finer partitions, you obtain better approximations
of the volume. This observation suggests that you could obtain the exact volume by
taking a limit. That is,
The precise meaning of this limit is that the limit is equal to 
if for every 
there
exists a 
such that
for all partitions 
of the plane region 
(that satisfy 
) and for all possible
choices of 
and 
in the 
region.
Using the limit of a Riemann sum to define volume is a special case of using the
limit to define a double integral. The general case, however, does not require that the
function be positive or continuous.

Having defined a double integral, you will see 
that a definite integral is occasionally referred to 
as a single integral.
Sufficient conditions for the double integral 
of on the region 
to exist are that 
can be written
as a union of a finite number of nonoverlapping 
subregions (see figure at the right) that are vertically
or horizontally simple and that is continuous on 
the region 
This means that the intersection of 
two nonoverlapping regions is a set that has an 
area of 0. In Figure 14.13, the area of the line 
segment common to 
and 
is 0.
A double integral can be used to find the 
volume of a solid region that lies between the 
plane and the surface given by 
Double integrals share many properties of single integrals.

Evaluation of Double Integrals
Normally, the first step in evaluating a double integral is to rewrite it as an iterated integral.
To show how this is done, a geometric model of a double integral is used as the volume
of a solid.
Consider the solid region bounded by the plane 
and the
three coordinate planes, as shown in Figure 14.14. Each vertical cross section taken 
parallel to the 
plane is a triangular region whose base has a length of 
and whose height is 
This implies that for a fixed value of 
the area of the
triangular cross section is
By the formula for the volume of a solid with known cross sections (Section 7.2), the
volume of the solid is
This procedure works no matter how 
is obtained. In particular, you can find 
by integration, as shown in Figure 14.15. That is, you consider 
to be constant, and
integrate 
from 0 to 
to obtain
Combining these results, you have the iterated integral
To understand this procedure better, it helps to imagine the integration as two sweeping
motions. For the inner integration, a vertical line sweeps out the area of a cross section.
For the outer integration, the triangular cross section sweeps out the volume, as shown
in Figure 14.16.

The next theorem was proved by the Italian mathematician Guido Fubini
(1879–1943). The theorem states that if 
is a vertically or horizontally simple region
and is continuous on 
then the double integral of on 
is equal to an iterated integral.
Evaluating a Double Integral as an Iterated Integral
Evaluate
where 
is the region given by
Solution
Because the region 
is a square,
it is both vertically and horizontally simple,
and you can use either order of integration.
Choose 
by placing a vertical representative 
rectangle in the region (see the figure at the 
right). This produces the following.
The double integral evaluated in Example 2 represents the volume of the solid
region approximated in Example 1. Note that the approximation obtained in Example 1
is quite good 
even though you used a partition consisting of only
16 squares. The error resulted because the centers of the square subregions were
used as the points in the approximation. This is comparable to the Midpoint Rule
approximation of a single integral.

The difficulty of evaluating a single integral 
usually depends on the 
function 
not on the interval 
This is a major difference between single and 
double integrals. In the next example, you will integrate a function similar to the one 
in Examples 1 and 2. Notice that a change in the region 
produces a much more difficult
integration problem.
Finding Volume by a Double Integral

and

plane, as shown in Figure 14.17(a).
Solution
By letting 
, you can see that the base of the region in the 
plane is

as shown in Figure 14.17(b). This plane region is both 
vertically and horizontally simple, so the order 
is appropriate.

In Examples 2 and 3, the problems could be solved with either order of integration
because the regions were both vertically and horizontally simple. Moreover, had you
used the order 
you would have obtained integrals of comparable difficulty. There
are, however, some occasions in which one order of integration is much more convenient
than the other. Example 4 shows such a case.
Comparing Different Orders of Integration

and the planes

The base of the solid region in the

and 
The two possible orders of integration are shown in Figure 14.19.

By setting up the corresponding iterated integrals, you can see that the order 
requires the antiderivative
which is not an elementary function. On the other hand, the order 
produces

Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates
Some double integrals are much easier to evaluate in polar form than in rectangular
form. This is especially true for regions such as circles, cardioids, and rose curves, and
for integrands that involve

To define a double integral of a continuous function 
in polar coordinates,
consider a region 
bounded by the graphs of
and
and the lines 
and 
Instead of partitioning 
into small rectangles, use a
partition of small polar sectors. On 
superimpose a polar grid made of rays and
circular arcs, as shown in Figure 14.25. The polar sectors 
lying entirely within form
an inner polar partition
whose norm
is the length of the longest diagonal of
the 
polar sectors.
Consider a specific polar sector 
as shown in Figure 14.26. It can be shown (see
Exercise 70) that the area of 
is
Area of 
where 
and 
This implies that the volume of the solid of
height 
above 
is approximately
and you have
The sum on the right can be interpreted as a Riemann sum for
The region 
corresponds to a horizontally simple region in the 
-plane, as shown in
Figure 14.27. The polar sectors 
correspond to rectangles 
and the area 
of 
is
So, the right-hand side of the equation corresponds to the double integral
From this, you can apply Theorem 14.2 to write
This suggests the theorem on the next page, the proof of which is discussed in Section 14.8.
The polar sector

Change of Variables: Polar Coordinates

TECHNOLOGY Any computer algebra system that can evaluate double integrals
in rectangular coordinates can also evaluate double integrals in polar coordinates.
The reason this is true is that once you have formed the iterated integral, its value is
not changed by using different variables. In other words, if you use a computer algebra
system to evaluate
you should obtain the same value as that obtained in Example 3.

Finding Areas of Polar Regions
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
To use a double integral to find the area enclosed by the graph of 
let 
be one petal of the curve shown in Figure 14.31. This region is 
simple, and the 
boundaries are 
and 
So, the area of one petal is
So, the total area is 
As illustrated in Example 4, the area of a region in the plane can be represented by
For 
you obtain
which agrees with Theorem 10.13.
So far in this section, all of the examples of iterated integrals in polar form have
been of the form
in which the order of integration is with respect to first. Sometimes you can obtain a
simpler integration problem by switching the order of integration.
Changing the Order of Integration
Find the area of the region bounded above by the spiral 
and below by the
polar axis, between 
and 
Solution
The region is shown in Figure 14.32. The polar boundaries for the region are
and
So, the area of the region can be evaluated as follows.

14.4 Center of Mass and Moments of Inertia
Find the mass of a planar lamina using a double integral.
Find the center of mass of a planar lamina using double integrals.
Find moments of inertia using double integrals.
Mass
Section 7.6 discussed several applications of integration involving a lamina of constant
density 
For example, if the lamina corresponding to the region 
as shown in Figure
14.33, has a constant density 
then the mass of the lamina is given by
Constant density
If not otherwise stated, a lamina is assumed to have a constant density. In this section,
however, you will extend the definition of the term lamina to include thin plates of 
variable density. Double integrals can be used to find the mass of a lamina of variable
density, where the density at 
is given by the density function
Density is normally expressed as mass per unit volume. For a planar lamina, however,
density is mass per unit surface area.
Finding the Mass of a Planar Lamina
Find the mass of the triangular lamina with vertices 
and 
given that
the density at 
is 
Solution
As shown in Figure 14.34, region 
has the boundaries 
and
Therefore, the mass of the lamina is
In Figure 14.34, note that the planar lamina is shaded so that the darkest shading 
corresponds to the densest part.

TECHNOLOGY On many occasions, this text has mentioned the benefits of 
computer programs that perform symbolic integration. Even if you use such a program
regularly, you should remember that its greatest benefit comes only in the hands of a
knowledgeable user. For instance, notice how much simpler the integral in Example 2
becomes when it is converted to polar form.
Rectangular Form
Polar Form
If you have access to software that performs symbolic integration, use it to evaluate
both integrals. Some software programs cannot handle the first integral, but any program
that can handle double integrals can evaluate the second integral.

Moments and Center of Mass
For a lamina of variable density, moments of mass are defined in a manner similar to
that used for the uniform density case. For a partition 
of a lamina corresponding 
to a plane region 
consider the 
rectangle 
of one area 
as shown in 
Figure 14.36. Assume that the mass of 
is concentrated at one of its interior points
The moment of mass of 
with respect to the 
axis can be approximated by
Similarly, the moment of mass with respect to the 
axis can be approximated by
By forming the Riemann sum of all such products and taking the limits as the norm of
approaches 0, you obtain the following definitions of moments of mass with respect
to the 
and 
axes.
For some planar laminas with a constant density 
you can determine the center
of mass (or one of its coordinates) using symmetry rather than using integration.
For instance, consider the laminas of constant density shown in Figure 14.37. Using
symmetry, you can see that 
for the first lamina and 
for the second lamina.

where the density at the point 
is proportional to the distance between 
and
the

Solution
The lamina is symmetric with respect to the

the center of mass lies on the axis and 
To find

Although you can think of the moments 
and 
as measuring the tendency 
to rotate about the 
or 
axis, the calculation of moments is usually an intermediate
step toward a more tangible goal. The use of the moments 
and 
is typical—to find
the center of mass. Determination of the center of mass is useful in a variety of 
applications that allow you to treat a lamina as if its mass were concentrated at just one
point. Intuitively, you can think of the center of mass as the balancing point of the 
lamina. For instance, the lamina in Example 3 should balance on the point of a pencil
placed at 
as shown in Figure 14.39.

Moments of Inertia
The moments of 
and 
used in determining the center of mass of a lamina are 
sometimes called the first moments about the 
and axes. In each case, the moment is
the product of a mass times a distance.
Mass
Mass
You will now look at another type of moment—the second moment, or the moment
of inertia of a lamina about a line. In the same way that mass is a measure of the
tendency of matter to resist a change in straight-line motion, the moment of inertia
about a line is a measure of the tendency of matter to resist a change in rotational
motion. For example, when a particle of mass 
is a distance 
from a fixed line, its
moment of inertia about the line is defined as
As with moments of mass, you can generalize this concept to obtain the moments of
inertia about the 
and 
axes of a lamina of variable density. These second moments
are denoted by 
and 
and in each case the moment is the product of a mass times the
square of a distance.
Mass

The sum of the moments 
and 
is called the polar moment of inertia and is denoted
by 
For a lamina in the 
plane,
represents the moment of inertia of the lamina
about the axis. The term “polar moment of inertia” stems from the fact that the square
of the polar distance is used in the calculation.
Finding the Moment of Inertia
Find the moment of inertia about the 
axis of the lamina in Example 3.

From the definition of moment of inertia, you have

The moment of inertia of a revolving lamina can be used to measure its kinetic
energy. For example, suppose a planar lamina is revolving about a line with an angular
speed of 
radians per second, as shown in Figure 14.40. The kinetic energy 
of the
revolving lamina is
Kinetic energy for rotational motion
On the other hand, the kinetic energy 
of a mass 
moving in a straight line at a
velocity is
Kinetic energy for linear motion
So, the kinetic energy of a mass moving in a straight line is proportional to its mass, but
the kinetic energy of a mass revolving about an axis is proportional to its moment of
inertia.
The radius of gyration
of a revolving mass 
with moment of inertia is defined as
Radius of gyration
If the entire mass were located at a distance from its axis of revolution, it would have
the same moment of inertia and, consequently, the same kinetic energy. For instance,
the radius of gyration of the lamina in Example 4 about the 
axis is
Finding the Radius of Gyration
Find the radius of gyration about the 
axis for the lamina corresponding to the region
where the density at 
is given by 
Solution
The region 
is shown in Figure 14.41. By integrating 
over the
region 
you can determine that the mass of the region is 
The moment of inertia
about the 
axis is
So, the radius of gyration about the 
axis is

14.5 Surface Area
Use a double integral to find the area of a surface.
Surface Area
At this point, you know a great deal about the
solid region lying between a surface and a 
closed and bounded region 
in the 
plane,
as shown in Figure 14.42. For example, you 
know how to find the extrema of on 
(Section 13.8), the area of the base 
of the 
solid (Section 14.1), the volume of the solid
(Section 14.2), and the centroid of the base 
(Section 14.4).
In this section, you will learn how to find 
the upper surface area of the solid. Later, you 
will learn how to find the centroid of the solid
(Section 14.6) and the lateral surface area 
(Section 15.2).
To begin, consider a surface given by
Surface defined over a region
defined over a region 
Assume that 
is closed and bounded and that has continuous
first partial derivatives. To find the surface area, construct an inner partition of 
consisting of 
rectangles, where the area of the 
rectangle 
is 
as
shown in Figure 14.43. In each 
let 
be the point that is closest to the origin. At
the point 
on the surface 
construct a tangent plane 
The
area of the portion of the tangent plane that lies directly above 
is approximately equal
to the area of the surface lying directly above 
That is,
So, the surface area
of is approximated by
To find the area of the parallelogram 
note that its sides are given by the vectors
and
From Theorem 11.8, the area of 
is given by 
where
So, the area of 
is 
and
This suggests the definition of surface area on the next page.

34. Modeling Data
A well-known property of liquids is that they will rise in narrow
vertical channels––this property is called “capillary action.” The
figure shows two plates, that form a narrow wedge in a container of
liquid. The upper surface of the liquid follows a hyperbolic shape
given by
where 
and are measured in inches. The constant 
depends
on the angle of the wedge, the type of liquid, and the material that
comprises the flat plates.
(a) Find the volume of the liquid that has risen in the wedge. 
Assume 
(b) Find the horizontal surface area of the liquid that has risen in
the wedge.

The procedure used to define a triple integral follows that used for double integrals.
Consider a function of three variables that is continuous over a bounded solid region
Then, encompass 
with a network of boxes and form the inner partition consisting
of all boxes lying entirely within 
as shown in Figure 14.52. The volume of the 
box is

The norm
of the partition is the length of the longest diagonal of the boxes in the
partition. Choose a point 
in each box and form the Riemann sum

To find the limits for a particular order of integration, it is generally advisable first
to determine the innermost limits, which may be functions of the outer two variables.
Then, by projecting the solid 
onto the coordinate plane of the outer two variables, you
can determine their limits of integration by the methods used for double integrals. For
instance, to evaluate
first determine the limits for 
the integral then has the form
By projecting the solid 
onto the 
plane, you can determine the limits for and as
you did for double integrals, as shown in Figure 14.53.
Using a Triple Integral to Find Volume

Because 
and play similar roles in the equation, the order of integration
is probably immaterial, and you can arbitrarily choose 
Moreover, you can 
simplify the calculation by considering only the portion of the ellipsoid lying in the first
octant, as shown in Figure 14.54. From the order 
you first determine the
bounds for 
In Figure 14.55, you can see that the boundaries for and are

Example 2 is unusual in that all six possible orders of integration produce 
integrals of comparable difficulty. Try setting up some other possible orders of integration
to find the volume of the elipsoid. For instance, the order 
yields the integral
The evaluation of this integral yields the same volume obtained in Example 2. This is
always the case—the order of integration does not affect the value of the integral.
However, the order of integration often does affect the complexity of the integral. In
Example 3, the given order of integration is not convenient, so you can change the order
to simplify the problem.
Changing the Order of Integration
Evaluate 
Solution
Note that after one integration 
in the given order, you would encounter 
the integral 
which is not an 
elementary function. To avoid this problem,
change the order of integration to 
so 
that is the outer variable. From Figure 14.56,
you can see that the solid region 
is
and the projection of 
in the 
plane yields 
the bounds
and
So, evaluating the triple integral using the 
order 
produces

Determining the Limits of Integration
Set up a triple integral for the volume of each solid region.
a. The region in the first octant bounded above by the cylinder 
and lying
between the vertical planes 
and 
b. The upper hemisphere 
c. The region bounded below by the paraboloid 
and above by the sphere
Solution
a. In Figure 14.57, note that the solid is bounded below by the 
plane 
and
above by the cylinder 
So,
Bounds for 
Projecting the region onto the 
plane produces a parallelogram. Because two sides
of the parallelogram are parallel to the 
axis, you have the following bounds:
and
So, the volume of the region is given by
b. For the upper hemisphere 
you have
Bounds for 
In Figure 14.58, note that the projection of the hemisphere onto the 
plane is the
circle 
and you can use either order 
or 
Choosing the first produces

which implies that the volume of the region is given by
c. For the region bounded below by the paraboloid 
and above by the
sphere 
you have

The sphere and the paraboloid intersect at 
Moreover, you can see in Figure 14.59

REMARK
In engineering
and physics, the moment of
inertia of a mass is used to find
the time required for the mass to
reach a given speed of rotation
about an axis, as shown in
Figure 14.60. The greater the
moment of inertia, the longer 
a force must be applied for the
mass to reach the given speed.

Finding the Center of Mass of a Solid Region
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Find the center of mass of the unit cube shown in Figure 14.61, given that the density
at the point 
is proportional to the square of its distance from the origin.
Solution
Because the density at 
is proportional to the square of the distance
between 
and 
you have
You can use this density function to find the mass of the cube. Because of the symmetry
of the region, any order of integration will produce an integral of comparable difficulty.
The first moment about the 
plane is
Note that 
can be factored out of the two inner integrals, because it is constant with
respect to and 
After factoring, the two inner integrals are the same as for the mass
Therefore, you have
So,
Finally, from the nature of 
and the symmetry of 
and in this solid region, you
have

Moments of Inertia for a Solid Region
Find the moments of inertia about the 
and 
axes for the solid region lying between
the hemisphere
and the 
plane, given that the density at 
is proportional to the distance
between 
and the 
plane.
Solution
The density of the region is given by
Considering the symmetry of this problem, you know that 
and you need to 
compute only one moment, say 
From Figure 14.62, choose the order 
and write
Wallis’s Formula
So,
In Example 6, notice that the moments of inertia about the 
and axes are equal
to each other. The moment about the axis, however, is different. Does it seem that the
moment of inertia about the 
axis should be less than or greater than the moments 
calculated in Example 6? By performing the calculations, you can determine that
This tells you that the solid shown in Figure 14.62 has a greater resistance to rotation
about the 
or 
axis than about the axis.

Write and evaluate a triple integral in cylindrical coordinates.
Write and evaluate a triple integral in spherical coordinates.
Triple Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates
Many common solid regions, such as spheres, ellipsoids, cones, and paraboloids, can
yield difficult triple integrals in rectangular coordinates. In fact, it is precisely this difficulty
that led to the introduction of nonrectangular coordinate systems. In this section, you
will learn how to use cylindrical and spherical coordinates to evaluate triple integrals.
Recall from Section 11.7 that the rectangular conversion equations for cylindrical
coordinates are
An easy way to remember these conversions is to note that the equations for and are
the same as in polar coordinates and is unchanged.
In this coordinate system, the simplest solid region is a cylindrical block 
determined by
and
as shown in Figure 14.63.
To obtain the cylindrical coordinate form of a triple integral, consider a solid region
whose projection 
onto the 
plane can be described in polar coordinates. That is,
is in 
and
If is a continuous function on the solid 
then you can write the triple integral of 
over 
as
where the double integral over 
is evaluated in polar coordinates. That is,
is a plane
region that is either simple or -simple. If 
is simple, then the iterated form of the
triple integral in cylindrical form is

PIERRE SIMON DE LAPLACE
(1749–1827)
One of the first to use a cylindrical
coordinate system was the French
mathematician Pierre Simon de
Laplace. Laplace has been called
the “Newton of France,” and he
published many important works
in mechanics, differential 
equations, and probability.

To visualize a particular order of integration, it helps to view the iterated integral
in terms of three sweeping motions—each adding another dimension to the solid. For
instance, in the order 
the first integration occurs in the direction as a point
sweeps out a ray. Then, as increases, the line sweeps out a sector. Finally, as increases,
the sector sweeps out a solid wedge, as shown in Figure 14.64.

Volume of a Paraboloid Sector
In the
Explorations on pages 979, 998, and 1010, you
were asked to summarize the different ways 
you know of finding the volume of the solid
bounded by the paraboloid

bounded by the
paraboloid 
and the plane 
as shown in Figure 14.67. The density at

Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates
Triple integrals involving spheres or cones are often easier to evaluate by converting to
spherical coordinates. Recall from Section 11.7 that the rectangular conversion equations
for spherical coordinates are
In this coordinate system, the simplest region is a spherical block determined by
where 
and
as shown in Figure 14.68.
If 
is a point in the interior of such 
a block, then the volume of the block can be 
approximated by 
(See Exercise 8 in the Problem Solving 
exercises at the end of this chapter.)
Using the usual process involving 
an inner partition, summation, and a limit,
you can develop a triple integral in spherical 
coordinates for a continuous function 
defined on the solid region 
This formula,
shown below, can be modified for different 
orders of integration and generalized to 
include regions with variable boundaries.
Like triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates, triple integrals in spherical
coordinates are evaluated with iterated integrals. As with cylindrical coordinates, you
can visualize a particular order of integration by viewing the iterated integral in terms
of three sweeping motions—each adding another dimension to the solid. For instance,
the iterated integral
(which is used in Example 4) is illustrated in Figure 14.69.

REMARK
The Greek letter 
used in spherical coordinates 
is not related to density. Rather,
it is the three-dimensional 
analog of the used in polar 
coordinates. For problems
involving spherical coordinates
and a density function, this 
text uses a different symbol 
to denote density.

CARL GUSTAV JACOBI (1804–1851)
The Jacobian is named after the
German mathematician Carl
Gustav Jacobi. Jacobi is known 
for his work in many areas of 
mathematics, but his interest in
integration stemmed from the
problem of finding the 
circumference of an ellipse.

Example 1 points out that the change of variables from rectangular to polar coordinates
for a double integral can be written as
where

-plane that corresponds to the region 
in the 
plane,
as shown in Figure 14.71. This formula is similar to that found in Theorem 14.3 on 
page 988.
In general, a change of variables is given by a one-to-one transformation

a region in the

Change of Variables for Double Integrals
Proof
Consider the case in which 
is a rectangular region in the 
plane with
vertices 
and 
as shown in Figure 14.74.
The images of these vertices in the 
plane are shown in Figure 14.75. If 
and 
are small, then the continuity of and implies that 
is approximately a parallelogram
determined by the vectors 
and 
So, the area of 
is
Moreover, for small 
and 
the partial derivatives of 
and 
with respect to 
can
be approximated by
and
Consequently,
Similarly, you can approximate 
by 
which implies that
It follows that, in Jacobian notation,
Because this approximation improves as 
and 
approach 0, the limiting case can
be written as
So,

The next two examples show how a change of variables can simplify the integration
process. The simplification can occur in various ways. You can make a change of 
variables to simplify either the region
or the integrand
or both.

Vector Fields
In Chapter 12, you studied vector-valued functions—functions that assign a vector to a
real number. There you saw that vector-valued functions of real numbers are useful in
representing curves and motion along a curve. In this chapter, you will study two other
types of vector-valued functions—functions that assign a vector to a point in the plane
or a point in space. Such functions are called vector fields, and they are useful in 
representing various types of force fields and velocity fields.
Although a vector field consists of infinitely many vectors, you can get a good idea
of what the vector field looks like by sketching several representative vectors 
whose initial points are 
The gradient is one example of a vector field. For instance, if

Vector field in the plane
is a vector field in the plane. From Chapter 13, the graphical interpretation of this field
is a family of vectors, each of which points in the direction of maximum increase along
the surface given by 
Similarly, if
then the gradient of

is a vector field in space. Note that the component functions for this particular vector
field are

A vector field 
is continuous at a point if and only if each of its component functions

Some common physical examples of vector fields are velocity fields, gravitational
fields, and electric force fields.
1. Velocity fields describe the motions of systems of particles in the plane or in space.
For instance, Figure 15.1 shows the vector field determined by a wheel rotating on
an axle. Notice that the velocity vectors are determined by the locations of their
initial points—the farther a point is from the axle, the greater its velocity. Velocity
fields are also determined by the flow of liquids through a container or by the flow
of air currents around a moving object, as shown in Figure 15.2.
2. Gravitational fields are defined by Newton’s Law of Gravitation, which states that
the force of attraction exerted on a particle of mass 
located at 
by a
particle of mass 
located at 
is
where 
is the gravitational constant and 
is the unit vector in the direction from
the origin to 
In Figure 15.3, you can see that the gravitational field 
has the
properties that 
always points toward the origin, and that the magnitude of
is the same at all points equidistant from the origin. A vector field with
these two properties is called a central force field. Using the position vector
for the point 
you can write the gravitational field 
as
3. Electric force fields are defined by Coulomb’s Law, which states that the force
exerted on a particle with electric charge 
located at 
by a particle with electric
charge 
located at 
is
where 
and is a constant that depends on the choice
of units for 
and 
Note that an electric force field has the same form as a gravitational field. That is,
Such a force field is called an inverse square field.

Because vector fields consist of infinitely many vectors, it is not possible to 
create a sketch of the entire field. Instead, when you sketch a vector field, your goal is
to sketch representative vectors that help you visualize the field.
Sketching a Vector Field
Sketch some vectors in the vector field
Solution
You could plot vectors at several random points in the plane. It is more
enlightening, however, to plot vectors of equal magnitude. This corresponds to finding
level curves in scalar fields. In this case, vectors of equal magnitude lie on circles.
Vectors of length

resulting circle. For instance, the following vectors occur on the unit circle.

Sketching a Velocity Field
Sketch some vectors in the velocity field

Solution
You can imagine that 
describes the velocity of a liquid flowing through
a tube of radius 4. Vectors near the axis are longer than those near the edge of the tube.
For instance, at the point 
the velocity vector is 
whereas at
the point 
the velocity vector is 
Figure 15.6 shows these and
several other vectors for the velocity field. From the figure, you can see that the speed
of the liquid is greater near the center of the tube than near the edges of the tube.
Conservative Vector Fields
Notice in Figure 15.5 that all the vectors appear to be normal to the level curve from
which they emanate. Because this is a property of gradients, it is natural to ask whether
the vector field 
is the gradient of some differentiable function 
The answer is that some vector fields
can be represented as the gradients of differentiable functions and some cannot—those
that can are called conservative vector fields.
Conservative Vector Fields
a. The vector field given by 
is conservative. To see this, consider
the potential function

As can be seen in Example 4(b), many important vector fields, including gravitational
fields and electric force fields, are conservative. Most of the terminology in this 
chapter comes from physics. For example, the term “conservative” is derived from the
classic physical law regarding the conservation of energy. This law states that the sum
of the kinetic energy and the potential energy of a particle moving in a conservative
force field is constant. (The kinetic energy of a particle is the energy due to its motion,
and the potential energy is the energy due to its position in the force field.)
The next theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a vector field in the
plane to be conservative.
Proof
To prove that the given condition is necessary for 
to be conservative, suppose
there exists a potential function such that
Then you have
and, by the equivalence of the mixed partials 
and 
you can conclude that
for all 
in 
The sufficiency of this condition is proved in
Section 15.4.

how to find a potential function of 
The problem is comparable to antidifferentiation.
Sometimes you will be able to find a potential function by simple inspection. For
instance, in Example 4, you observed that

Curl of a Vector Field
Theorem 15.1 has a counterpart for vector fields in space. Before stating that result, the
definition of the curl of a vector field in space is given.
The cross product notation used for curl comes from viewing the gradient 
as the
result of the differential operator 
acting on the function 
In this context, you can
use the following determinant form as an aid in remembering the formula for curl.

used to find the curl of a vector field. If you have access to a computer algebra system
that has such a command, use it to find the curl of the vector field in Example 7.

Later in this chapter, you will assign a physical interpretation to the curl of a 
vector field. But for now, the primary use of curl is shown in the following test for
conservative vector fields in space. The test states that for a vector field in space, the
curl is 
at every point in its domain if and only if 
is conservative. The proof is 
similar to that given for Theorem 15.1.
From Theorem 15.2, you can see that the vector field given in Example 7 is
conservative because 
Try showing that the vector field 
is not conservative—you can do this by showing that its curl is 
For vector fields in space that pass the test for being conservative, you can find a
potential function by following the same pattern used in the plane (as demonstrated in
Example 6).

Divergence of a Vector Field
You have seen that the curl of a vector field 
is itself a vector field. Another important
function defined on a vector field is divergence, which is a scalar function.
The dot product notation used for divergence comes from considering 
as a
differential operator, as follows.
Finding the Divergence of a Vector Field
Find the divergence at 
for the vector field
Solution
The divergence of 
is
At the point 
the divergence is
Divergence can be viewed as a type of derivative of 
in that, for vector fields 
representing velocities of moving particles, the divergence measures the rate of particle
flow per unit volume at a point. In hydrodynamics (the study of fluid motion), a velocity
field that is divergence free is called incompressible. In the study of electricity and
magnetism, a vector field that is divergence free is called solenoidal.
There are many important properties of the divergence and curl of a vector field 
see Exercise 77(a)–(g) . One that is used often is described in Theorem 15.3. You are
asked to prove this theorem in Exercise 77(h).

Piecewise Smooth Curves
A classic property of gravitational fields is that, subject to certain physical constraints,
the work done by gravity on an object moving between two points in the field is
independent of the path taken by the object. One of the constraints is that the path must
be a piecewise smooth curve. Recall that a plane curve 
given by
is smooth when
and
are continuous on 
and not simultaneously 0 on 
Similarly, a space curve 
given by
is smooth when
and
are continuous on 
and not simultaneously 0 on 
A curve 
is piecewise
smooth when the interval 
can be partitioned into a finite number of subintervals,
on each of which 
is smooth.
Finding a Piecewise Smooth Parametrization
Find a piecewise smooth parametrization of the graph of 
shown in Figure 15.7.
Solution
Because 
consists of three line segments 
and 
you can
construct a smooth parametrization for each segment and piece them together by
making the last value in 
correspond to the first value in 
So,
is given by
Because 
and 
are smooth, it follows that 
is piecewise smooth.
Recall that parametrization of a curve induces an orientation to the curve. For
instance, in Example 1, the curve is oriented such that the positive direction is from
following the curve to 
Try finding a parametrization that induces the
opposite orientation.

JOSIAH WILLARD GIBBS (1839–1903)
Many physicists and mathematicians
have contributed to the theory
and applications described in this
chapter––Newton, Gauss, Laplace,
Hamilton, and Maxwell, among
others. However, the use of 
vector analysis to describe these
results is attributed primarily to
the American mathematical 
physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs.

Line Integrals
Up to this point in the text, you have studied various types of integrals. For a single integral
Integrate over interval 
you integrated over the interval 
Similarly, for a double integral
Integrate over region 
you integrated over the region 
in the plane. In this section, you will study a new type
of integral called a line integral
Integrate over curve 
for which you integrate over a piecewise smooth curve 
(The terminology is
somewhat unfortunate—this type of integral might be better described as a “curve integral.”)
To introduce the concept of a line integral, consider the mass of a wire of finite
length, given by a curve 
in space. The density (mass per unit length) of the wire at
the point 
is given by 
Partition the curve 
by the points 
producing subarcs, as shown in Figure 15.8. 
The length of the 
subarc is given by 
Next, choose a point 
in each subarc. 
If the length of each subarc is small, then the 
total mass of the wire can be approximated 
by the sum
Mass of wire
By letting 
denote the length of the 
longest subarc and letting 
approach 0, it seems reasonable that the limit of this sum
approaches the mass of the wire. This leads to the next definition.
As with the integrals discussed in Chapter 14, evaluation of a line integral is 
best accomplished by converting it to a definite integral. It can be shown that if 
is continuous, then the limit given above exists and is the same for all smooth 
parametrizations of C.

So, the line integral takes the following form.
The value of the line integral in Example 2 does not depend on the parametrization of
the line segment

Line Integrals of Vector Fields
One of the most important physical applications of line integrals is that of finding the
work done on an object moving in a force field. For example, Figure 15.12 shows an
inverse square force field similar to the gravitational field of the sun. Note that the 
magnitude of the force along a circular path about the center is constant, whereas the
magnitude of the force along a parabolic path varies from point to point.
To see how a line integral can be used to find work done in a force field 
consider
an object moving along a path 
in the field, as shown in Figure 15.13. To determine
the work done by the force, you need consider only that part of the force that is acting
in the same direction as that in which the object is moving (or the opposite direction).
This means that at each point on 
you can consider the projection 
of the force
vector 
onto the unit tangent vector 
On a small subarc of length 
the increment
of work is
where 
is a point in the 
subarc. Consequently, the total work done is given
by the integral
At each point on 
the force in the direction of motion is

nothing to the total work. This occurs because in this particular example, the component

Line Integrals in Differential Form
A second commonly used form of line integrals is derived from the vector field 
notation used in Section 15.1. If 
is a vector field of the form 
and
is given by 
then 
is often written as 
This differential form can be extended to three variables. 
Evaluating a Line Integral in Differential Form
Let 
be the circle of radius 3 given by
as shown in Figure 15.17. Evaluate the line integral
Solution
Because 
and 
you have 
and
So, the line integral is
The orientation of 
affects the value of the differential form of a line integral.
Specifically, if 
has the orientation opposite to that of 
then
So, of the three line integral forms presented in this section, the orientation of 
does not
affect the form 
but it does affect the vector form and the differential form.

Understand and use the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals.
Understand the concept of independence of path.
Understand the concept of conservation of energy.
Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals
The discussion at the beginning of Section 15.2 pointed out that in a gravitational field
the work done by gravity on an object moving between two points in the field is
independent of the path taken by the object. In this section, you will study an 
important generalization of this result—it is called the Fundamental Theorem of Line
Integrals. To begin, an example is presented in which the line integral of a conservative
vector field is evaluated over three different paths.
Line Integral of a Conservative Vector Field
Find the work done by the force field
on a particle that moves from 
to 
along each path, as shown in Figure 15.19.

Independence of Path
From the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, it is clear that if 
is continuous 
and conservative in an open region 
then the value of 
is the same for every
piecewise smooth curve 
from one fixed point in 
to another fixed point in 
This
result is described by saying that the line integral 
is independent of path in
the region 
A region in the plane (or in space) is connected when any two points in the region
can be joined by a piecewise smooth curve lying entirely within the region, as shown in
Figure 15.22. In open regions that are connected, the path independence of 
is
equivalent to the condition that 
is conservative.
Proof
If 
is conservative, then, by the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, the
line integral is independent of path. Now establish the converse for a plane region 
Let 
and let 
be a fixed point in 
For any point 
in 
choose a piecewise smooth curve 
running from

The existence of

For the first path, choose

Because the first integral does not depend on

For the

Using reasoning similar to that used for the first

Therefore, the work done by

For the object in Example 4, how much work is done when the object moves on a
curve from 
to 
and then back to the starting point 
The
Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals states that there is zero work done. Remember
that, by definition, work can be negative. So, by the time the object gets back to its starting
point, the amount of work that registers positively is canceled out by the amount of
work that registers negatively.

Solution
You have the following three options.
a. You can use the method presented in Section 15.2 to evaluate the line integral along the
given curve. To do this, you can use the parametrization 
where 
For this parametrization, it follows that

This integral should dampen your enthusiasm for this option.
b. You can try to find a potential function and evaluate the line integral by the
Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals. Using the technique demonstrated in
Example 4, you can find the potential function to be

c. Knowing that 
is conservative, you have a third option. Because the value of the
line integral is independent of path, you can replace the semicircular path with a 
simpler path. Choose the straight-line path 
from

Then, the integral is

Theorem 15.7
gives you options for evaluating
a line integral involving a 
conservative vector field. You 
can use a potential function,
or it might be more convenient
to choose a particularly simple
path, such as a straight line.

Conservation of Energy
In 1840, the English physicist Michael Faraday wrote, “Nowhere is there a pure
creation or production of power without a corresponding exhaustion of something to
supply it.” This statement represents the first formulation of one of the most important
laws of physics—the Law of Conservation of Energy. In modern terminology, the law
is stated as follows: In a conservative force field, the sum of the potential and kinetic
energies of an object remains constant from point to point.
You can use the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals to derive this law. From
physics, the kinetic energy of a particle of mass 
and speed is
Kinetic energy
The potential energy
of a particle at point 
in a conservative vector field
is defined as 
where 
is the potential function for 
Consequently, the work done by 
along a smooth curve 
from 
to 
is
as shown in Figure 15.25. In other words, work 
is equal to the difference in the potential
energies of 
and 
Now, suppose that 
is the position vector for a particle moving
along 
from 
to 
At any time 
the particle’s velocity, acceleration,
and speed are 
and 
respectively. So, by Newton’s
Second Law of Motion,
and the work done by 
is
Equating these two results for 
produces
which implies that the sum of the potential and kinetic energies remains constant from
point to point.

MICHAEL FARADAY (1791–1867)
Several philosophers of science
have considered Faraday’s Law of
Conservation of Energy to be 
the greatest generalization ever 
conceived by humankind. Many
physicists have contributed to our
knowledge of this law.Two early
and influential ones were James
Prescott Joule (1818–1889) and
Hermann Ludwig Helmholtz
(1821–1894).

15.4 Green’s Theorem
Use Green’s Theorem to evaluate a line integral.
Use alternative forms of Green’s Theorem.
Green’s Theorem
In this section, you will study Green’s Theorem, named after the English mathematician
George Green (1793–1841). This theorem states that the value of a double integral over
a simply connected plane region 
is determined by the value of a line integral around
the boundary of 
A curve 
given by 
where 
is simple when it does
not cross itself—that is,
for all 
and 
in the open interval 
A 
connected plane region 
is simply connected when every simple closed curve in 
encloses only points that are in 
(see Figure 15.26). Informally, a simply connected
region cannot consist of separate parts or holes.
Proof
A proof is given only for a region that is both vertically simple and horizontally
simple, as shown in Figure 15.27.
On the other hand,
Consequently,
Similarly, you can use 
and 
to show that 
By
adding the integrals 
and 
you obtain the conclusion stated in the
theorem.
See LarsonCalculus.com for Bruce Edwards’s video of this proof.

An integral sign with a circle is sometimes used to indicate a line integral around
a simple closed curve, as shown below. To indicate the orientation of the boundary, an
arrow can be used. For instance, in the second integral, the arrow indicates that the
boundary 
is oriented counterclockwise.

Green’s Theorem cannot be applied to every line integral. Among other restrictions
stated in Theorem 15.8, the curve 
must be simple and closed. When Green’s Theorem
does apply, however, it can save time. To see this, try using the techniques described in
Section 15.2 to evaluate the line integral in Example 1. To do this, you would need to
write the line integral as

GEORGE GREEN
(1793–1841)
Green, a self-educated miller’s
son, first published the theorem
that bears his name in 1828 in 
an essay on electricity and 
magnetism. At that time, there was
almost no mathematical theory 
to explain electrical phenomena.
“Considering how desirable it was
that a power of universal agency,
like electricity, should, as far as
possible, be submitted to 
calculation, . . . I was induced to
try whether it would be possible
to discover any general relations
existing between this function and
the quantities of electricity in the
bodies producing it.”

When evaluating line integrals over closed curves, remember that for conservative
vector fields (those for which 
), the value of the line integral is 0. This
is easily seen from the statement of Green’s Theorem:
Green’s Theorem and Conservative Vector Fields
Evaluate the line integral
where 
is the path shown in Figure 15.30.
Solution
From this line integral,
and 
So,

This implies that the vector field

Finding Area by a Line Integral
Use a line integral to find the area of the ellipse 
Solution
Using Figure 15.32, you can induce a counterclockwise orientation to the
elliptical path by letting

So, the area is
Green’s Theorem can be extended to cover some regions that are not simply
connected. This is demonstrated in the next example.
Green’s Theorem Extended to a Region with a Hole
Let 
be the region inside the ellipse 
and outside the circle
Evaluate the line integral
where 
is the boundary of 
as shown in Figure 15.33.
Solution
To begin, introduce the line segments 
and 
as shown in Figure 15.33.
Note that because the curves 
and 
have opposite orientations, the line integrals
over them cancel. Furthermore, apply Green’s Theorem to the region 
using the
boundary 
to obtain
In Section 15.1, a necessary and sufficient condition for conservative vector fields
was listed. There, only one direction of the proof was shown. You can now outline the
other direction, using Green’s Theorem. Let 
be defined on an open
disk 
You want to show that if 
and 
have continuous first partial derivatives and
then 
is conservative. Let 
be a closed path forming the boundary
of a connected region lying in 
Then, using the fact that 
apply
Green’s Theorem to conclude that
This, in turn, is equivalent to showing that 
is conservative (see Theorem 15.7).

Alternative Forms of Green’s Theorem
This section concludes with the derivation of two vector forms of Green’s Theorem for
regions in the plane. The extension of these vector forms to three dimensions is the
basis for the discussion in the remaining sections of this chapter. For a vector field 
in the plane, you can write
so that the curl of 
as described in Section 15.1, is given by
Consequently,
With appropriate conditions on 
and 
you can write Green’s Theorem in the 
vector form
First alternative form
The extension of this vector form of Green’s Theorem to surfaces in space produces
Stokes’s Theorem, discussed in Section 15.8.
For the second vector form of Green’s Theorem, assume the same conditions for 
and 
Using the arc length parameter for 
you have 
So, a
unit tangent vector to curve is given by 
From Figure 15.34,
you can see that the outward unit normal vector 
can then be written as
Consequently, for 
you can apply Green’s Theorem to obtain
Green’s Theorem
Therefore,
Second alternative form
The extension of this form to three dimensions is called the Divergence Theorem and
will be discussed in Section 15.7. The physical interpretations of divergence and curl
will be discussed in Sections 15.7 and 15.8.

In this section, you will learn how to represent a surface in space by a set of parametric
equations—or by a vector-valued function. For curves, note that the vector-valued function
is a function of a single parameter For surfaces, the vector-valued function is a function
of two parameters

Sketching a Parametric Surface
Identify and sketch the parametric surface given by
where 
and 
Solution
Because 
and
you know that for each point
on the surface,
and are related 
by the equation
In other words, each cross section of taken 
parallel to the 
plane is a circle of radius 3,
centered on the axis. Because 
where
you can see that the surface is a right circular
cylinder of height 4. The radius of the cylinder
is 3, and the axis forms the axis of the cylinder,
as shown in Figure 15.36.
As with parametric representations of curves, parametric representations of
surfaces are not unique. That is, there are many other sets of parametric equations that
could be used to represent the surface shown in Figure 15.36.
Sketching a Parametric Surface
Identify and sketch the parametric surface given by
where

Solution
To identify the surface, you can try to use trigonometric identities to
eliminate the parameters. After some experimentation, you can discover that
So, each point on lies on the unit sphere, centered at the origin, as shown in Figure 15.37.

that are parallel to the 
plane, and for fixed

To convince yourself further that

Finding Parametric Equations for Surfaces
In Examples 1 and 2, you were asked to identify the surface described by a given set of
parametric equations. The reverse problem—that of writing a set of parametric equations
for a given surface—is generally more difficult. One type of surface for which this
problem is straightforward, however, is a surface that is given by 
You can
parametrize such a surface as
Representing a Surface Parametrically
Write a set of parametric equations for the cone given by
as shown in Figure 15.38.
Solution
Because this surface is given in the form 
you can let and be
the parameters. Then the cone is represented by the vector-valued function
where 
varies over the entire 
plane.
A second type of surface that is easily represented parametrically is a surface of
revolution. For instance, to represent the surface formed by revolving the graph of
about the 
axis, use
and
where 
and 
Representing a Surface of Revolution Parametrically
See LarsonCalculus.com for an interactive version of this type of example.
Write a set of parametric equations for the surface of revolution obtained by revolving
about the 
axis.
Solution
Use the parameters and as described above to write
and
where
and
The resulting surface is a portion of Gabriel’s Horn, as shown in Figure 15.39.
The surface of revolution in Example 4 is formed by revolving the graph of 
about the axis. For other types of surfaces of revolution, a similar parametrization can be
used. For instance, to parametrize the surface formed by revolving the graph of 
about the axis, you can use

Normal Vectors and Tangent Planes
Let be a parametric surface given by
over an open region 
such that 
and have continuous partial derivatives on 
The
partial derivatives of r with respect to and are defined as
and
Each of these partial derivatives is a vector-valued function that can be interpreted 
geometrically in terms of tangent vectors. For instance, if 
is held constant, then
is a vector-valued function of a single parameter and defines a curve 
that lies on
the surface 
The tangent vector to 
at the point
is given by
as shown in Figure 15.40. In a similar way, if 
is held constant, then 
is a 
vector-valued function of a single parameter and defines a curve 
that lies on the surface 
The tangent vector to 
at the point 
is given by
If the normal vector 
is not 
for any 
in 
then the surface 
is called
smooth and will have a tangent plane. Informally, a smooth surface is one that has no
sharp points or cusps. For instance, spheres, ellipsoids, and paraboloids are smooth,
whereas the cone given in Example 3 is not smooth.
Figure 15.40 shows the normal vector 
The vector 
is also normal to
and points in the opposite direction.

Finding a Tangent Plane to a Parametric Surface
Find an equation of the tangent plane to the paraboloid
at the point 
Solution
The point in the 
plane that is mapped to the point 
is
The partial derivatives of are
and
The normal vector is given by
which implies that the normal vector at 
is
So, an equation of the tangent plane at 
is
The tangent plane is shown in Figure 15.41.
Area of a Parametric Surface
To define the area of a parametric surface, you can use a development that is similar to
that given in Section 14.5. Begin by constructing an inner partition of 
consisting of
rectangles, where the area of the 
rectangle 
is 
as shown in 
Figure 15.42. In each 
let 
be the point that is closest to the origin. At the point
on the surface 
construct a tangent plane 
The area of the portion of 
that corresponds to 
can be approximated by a
parallelogram in the tangent plane. That is,
So, the surface of is given by
The area of the parallelogram in the tangent plane is
which leads to the next definition.

Orientation of a Surface
Unit normal vectors are used to induce an orientation to a surface in space. A surface
is orientable when a unit normal vector 
can be defined at every nonboundary point
of 
in such a way that the normal vectors vary continuously over the surface 
The 
surface
is called an oriented surface.
An orientable surface 
has two distinct sides. So, when you orient a surface, you
are selecting one of the two possible unit normal vectors. For a closed surface such as a
sphere, it is customary to choose the unit normal vector 
to be the one that points outward
from the sphere.
Most common surfaces, such as spheres, paraboloids, ellipses, and planes, are
orientable. (See Exercise 43 for an example of a surface that is not orientable.) Moreover, for
an orientable surface, the gradient vector provides a convenient way to find a unit normal 
vector. That is, for an orientable surface given by
Orientable surface
let
Then,
can be oriented by either the unit normal vector
Upward unit normal vector
or the unit normal vector
Downward unit normal vector
as shown in Figure 15.50. If the smooth orientable surface is given in parametric form by
Parametric surface
then the unit normal vectors are given by
and
For an orientable surface given by
or
you can use the gradient vector
or
to orient the surface.

Flux Integrals
One of the principal applications involving the vector form of a surface integral relates
to the flow of a fluid through a surface. Consider an oriented surface submerged in a
fluid having a continuous velocity field 
Let 
be the area of a small patch of the
surface over which 
is nearly constant. Then the amount of fluid crossing this region
per unit of time is approximated by the volume of the column of height 
as shown
in Figure 15.51. That is,
Consequently, the volume of fluid crossing the surface per unit of time (called the flux
of 
across ) is given by the surface integral in the next definition.
Geometrically, a flux integral is the surface integral over 
of the normal
component of 
If 
is the density of the fluid at 
then the flux integral
represents the mass of the fluid flowing across per unit of time.
To evaluate a flux integral for a surface given by

The result in Example 6 shows that the flux across a sphere in an inverse square
field is independent of the radius of 
In particular, if 
is an electric field, then the
result in Example 6, along with Coulomb’s Law, yields one of the basic laws of 
electrostatics, known as Gauss’s Law:
Gauss’s Law
where 
is a point charge located at the center of the sphere and 
is the Coulomb
constant. Gauss’s Law is valid for more general closed surfaces that enclose the 
origin, and relates the flux out of the surface to the total charge inside the surface.
Surface integrals are also used in the study of heat flow. Heat flows from areas of
higher temperature to areas of lower temperature in the direction of greatest change. As
a result, measuring heat flux involves the gradient of the temperature. The flux depends
on the area of the surface. It is the normal direction to the surface that is important,
because heat that flows in directions tangential to the surface will produce no heat loss.
So, assume that the heat flux across a portion of the surface of area 
is given by
where 
is the temperature,
is the unit normal vector to the 
surface in the direction of the heat flow, and is the thermal diffusivity of the material.
The heat flux across the surface is given by

Recall from Section 15.4 that an alternative form of Green’s Theorem is
In an analogous way, the Divergence Theorem gives the relationship between a triple 
integral over a solid region 
and a surface integral over the surface of 
In the statement
of the theorem, the surface is closed in the sense that it forms the complete boundary of

Regions bounded by spheres, ellipsoids, cubes, tetrahedrons, or combinations
of these surfaces are typical examples of closed surfaces. Let 
be a solid region on which
a triple integral can be evaluated, and let be a closed surface that is oriented by outward
unit normal vectors, as shown in Figure 15.54. With these restrictions on

REMARK
As noted at the left above, the Divergence Theorem is sometimes called
Gauss’s Theorem. It is also sometimes called Ostrogradsky’s Theorem, after the Russian
mathematician Michel Ostrogradsky (1801–1861).
CARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS 
(1777–1855)
The Divergence Theorem is also
called Gauss’s Theorem, after the
famous German mathematician
Carl Friedrich Gauss. Gauss is 
recognized, with Newton and
Archimedes, as one of the three
greatest mathematicians in history.
One of his many contributions to
mathematics was made at the age
of 22, when, as part of his doctoral
dissertation, he proved the 
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

Proof
For 
the theorem takes the form
You can prove this by verifying that the following three equations are valid.
Because the verifications of the three equations are similar, only the third is discussed.
Restrict the proof to a simple solid region with upper surface
Upper surface
and lower surface
Lower surface
whose projections onto the 
plane coincide and form region 
If 
has a lateral
surface like 
in Figure 15.55, then a normal vector is horizontal, which implies that
Consequently, you have
On the upper surface 
the outward normal vector is upward, whereas on the lower
surface 
the outward normal vector is downward. So, by Theorem 15.11, you have 
and
Adding these results, you obtain

If you have access to a computer algebra system that can evaluate
triple-iterated integrals, use it to verify the result in Example 1. When you are using
such a utility, note that the first step is to convert the triple integral to an iterated 
integral—this step may be done by hand. To give yourself some practice with this
important step, find the limits of integration for the following iterated integrals. Then
use a computer to verify that the value is the same as that obtained in Example 1.

Using the Divergence Theorem
Let

Solution
Direct evaluation of this surface integral would be difficult. However, by
the Divergence Theorem, you can evaluate the integral as follows.
Notice that cylindrical coordinates with
and
were used to evaluate the triple integral.
Even though the Divergence Theorem was stated for a simple solid region 
bounded by a closed surface, the theorem is also valid for regions that are the finite
unions of simple solid regions. For example, let 
be the solid bounded by the closed
surfaces

as shown in Figure 15.59. To apply the Divergence Theorem to this

Flux and the Divergence Theorem
To help understand the Divergence Theorem, consider the two sides of the equation
You know from Section 15.6 that the flux integral on the left determines the total fluid
flow across the surface 
per unit of time. This can be approximated by summing the
fluid flow across small patches of the surface. The triple integral on the right 
measures this same fluid flow across 
but from a very different perspective—namely,
by calculating the flow of fluid into (or out of) small cubes of volume 
The flux of
the 
cube is approximately 
for some point 
in the 
cube. Note that for a cube in the interior of 
the gain (or loss) of fluid through any
one of its six sides is offset by a corresponding loss (or gain) through one of the sides
of an adjacent cube. After summing over all the cubes in 
the only fluid flow that is
not canceled by adjoining cubes is that on the outside edges of the cubes on the bound-
ary. So, the sum
approximates the total flux into (or out of) 
and therefore through the surface 
To see what is meant by the divergence of 
at a point, consider 
to be the
volume of a small sphere 
of radius 
and center 
contained in region 
as shown in Figure 15.60. Applying the Divergence Theorem to 
produces
where 
is the interior of 
Consequently, you have
and, by taking the limit as 
you obtain the divergence of 
at the point
The point 
in a vector field is classified as a source, a sink, or incompressible,
as shown in the list below.

In hydrodynamics,
a source is a point at which 
additional fluid is considered as
being introduced to the region
occupied by the fluid. A sink
is a point at which fluid is 
considered as being removed.

15.8 Stokes’s Theorem
Understand and use Stokes’s Theorem.
Use curl to analyze the motion of a rotating liquid.
Stokes’s Theorem
A second higher-dimension analog of Green’s Theorem is called Stokes’s Theorem,
after the English mathematical physicist George Gabriel Stokes. Stokes was part of a
group of English mathematical physicists referred to as the Cambridge School, which
included William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and James Clerk Maxwell. In addition to
making contributions to physics, Stokes worked with infinite series and differential
equations, as well as with the integration results presented in this section.
Stokes’s Theorem gives the relationship between a surface integral over an oriented
surface 
and a line integral along a closed space curve 
forming the boundary of 
as shown in Figure 15.62. The positive direction along 
is counterclockwise 
relative to the normal vector 
That is, if you imagine grasping the normal vector 
with your right hand, with your thumb pointing in the direction of 
then your fingers
will point in the positive direction 
as shown in Figure 15.63.

Physical Interpretation of Curl
Stokes’s Theorem provides insight into a physical interpretation of curl. In a vector field
let 
be a small circular disk of radius 
centered at 
and with boundary 
as shown in Figure 15.66. At each point on the circle 
has a normal component
and a tangential component 
The more closely 
and 
are aligned, the
greater the value of 
So, a fluid tends to move along the circle rather than across
it. Consequently, you say that the line integral around 
measures the circulation of
around
That is,
Now consider a small disk 
to be 
centered at some point 
on the surface
as shown in Figure 15.67. On such a small
disk, curl 
is nearly constant, because it 
varies little from its value at 
Moreover, curl 
is also nearly constant on 
because all unit normals to 
are about the
same. Consequently, Stokes’s Theorem yields
So,
Assuming conditions are such that the approximation improves for smaller and smaller
disks 
it follows that
which is referred to as the rotation of F about N. That is,
rotation of 
about 
at 
In this case, the rotation of 
is maximum when curl 
and 
have the same direction.
Normally, this tendency to rotate will vary from point to point on the surface 
and
Stokes’s Theorem
Surface integral
Line integral
says that the collective measure of this rotational tendency taken over the entire surface
(surface integral) is equal to the tendency of a fluid to circulate around the boundary
(line integral).

You have learned many calculus techniques for finding the area of
a planar region. Engineers use a mechanical device called a
planimeter for measuring planar areas, which is based on the area
formula given in Theorem 15.9 (page 1078). As you can see in the
figure, the planimeter is fixed at point 
(but free to pivot) and has
a hinge at 
The end of the tracer arm 
moves counterclockwise
around the region 
A small wheel at 
is perpendicular to 
and
is marked with a scale to measure how much it rolls as 
traces out
the boundary of region 
In this project, you will show that the
area of 
is given by the length 
of the tracer arm 
multiplied
by the distance 
that the wheel rolls.
Assume that point 
traces out the boundary of

C.1 Real Numbers and the Real Number Line
Represent and classify real numbers.
Order real numbers and use inequalities.
Find the absolute values of real numbers and find the distance between two real
numbers.
Real Numbers and the Real Number Line
Real numbers can be represented by a coordinate system called the real number line
or -axis (see Figure C.1). The real number corresponding to a point on the real number
line is the coordinate of the point. As Figure C.1 shows, it is customary to identify those
points whose coordinates are integers.
The real number line
Figure C.1
The point on the real number line corresponding to zero is the origin and is
denoted by 0. The positive direction (to the right) is denoted by an arrowhead and is
the direction of increasing values of 
Numbers to the right of the origin are positive.
Numbers to the left of the origin are negative. The term nonnegative describes a 
number that is either positive or zero. The term nonpositive describes a number that is
either negative or zero.
Each point on the real number line corresponds to one and only one real number,
and each real number corresponds to one and only one point on the real number line.
This type of relationship is called a one-to-one correspondence.
Each of the four points in Figure C.2 corresponds to a rational number—one that
can be written as the ratio of two integers. Note that 
and 
Rational numbers can be represented either by terminating decimals such as 
or
by repeating decimals such as 
Real numbers that are not rational are irrational. Irrational numbers cannot be 
represented as terminating or repeating decimals. In computations, irrational numbers
are represented by decimal approximations. Here are three familiar examples.

Order and Inequalities
One important property of real numbers is that they are ordered. For two real numbers
and 
is less than
when 
is positive. This order is denoted by the inequality
This relationship can also be described by saying that 
is greater than
and writing
If three real numbers 
and are ordered such that 
and 
then 
is between
and and 
Geometrically,
if and only if 
lies to the left of 
on the real number line
(see Figure C.4). For example,
because 1 lies to the left of 2 on the real number
line.
Several properties used in working with inequalities are listed below. Similar 
properties are obtained when 
is replaced by 
and 
is replaced by 
(The symbols
and 
mean less than or equal to and greater than or equal to, respectively.)
Note that you reverse the inequality when you multiply the inequality by a negative
number. For example, if 
then 
This also applies to division by a
negative number. So, if 
then 
A set is a collection of elements. Two common sets are the set of real numbers and
the set of points on the real number line. Many problems in calculus involve subsets of
one of these two sets. In such cases, it is convenient to use set notation of the form 
{ : condition on }, which is read as follows.
The set of all such that a certain condition is true.
{
:
condition on }
For example, you can describe the set of positive real numbers as
Set of positive real numbers
Similarly, you can describe the set of nonnegative real numbers as
Set of nonnegative real numbers
The union of two sets 
and 
denoted by 
is the set of elements that are
members of 
or
or both. The intersection of two sets 
and 
denoted by 
is
the set of elements that are members of 
and
Two sets are disjoint when they have
no elements in common.

The most commonly used subsets are intervals on the real number line. For 
example, the open interval
Open interval
is the set of all real numbers greater than 
and less than 
where 
and 
are the
endpoints of the interval. Note that the endpoints are not included in an open interval.
Intervals that include their endpoints are closed and are denoted by
Closed interval
The nine basic types of intervals on the real number line are shown in the table below.
The first four are bounded intervals and the remaining five are unbounded intervals.
Unbounded intervals are also classified as open or closed. The intervals 
and
are open, the intervals 
and 
are closed, and the interval 
is considered to be both open and closed.
Note that the symbols 
and 
refer to positive and negative infinity,
respectively. These symbols do not denote real numbers. They simply enable you to
describe unbounded conditions more concisely. For instance, the interval 
is
unbounded to the right because it includes all real numbers that are greater than or equal
to a.

outside your solution set to verify that they do not satisfy the inequality. For example,

Solving a Double Inequality
Solve 
Solution
Write original inequality.
Subtract 2 from each part.
Simplify.
Simplify.
The solution set is 
as shown in Figure C.7.
The inequalities in Examples 2 and 3 are linear inequalities—that is, they involve
first-degree polynomials. To solve inequalities involving polynomials of higher degree,
use the fact that a polynomial can change signs only at its real zeros (the -values that
make the polynomial equal to zero). Between two consecutive real zeros, a polynomial
must be either entirely positive or entirely negative. This means that when the real zeros
of a polynomial are put in order, they divide the real number line into test intervals in
which the polynomial has no sign changes. So, if a polynomial has the factored form
then the test intervals are
and
To determine the sign of the polynomial in each test interval, you need to test only one
value from the interval.
Solving a Quadratic Inequality

Solution
Write original inequality.

Factor.
The polynomial 
has 
and 
as its zeros. So, you can solve the
inequality by testing the sign of 
in each of the test intervals 
and 
To test an interval, choose any number in the interval and 
determine the sign of 
After doing this, you will find that the polynomial 
is positive for all real numbers in the first and third intervals and negative for all real
numbers in the second interval. The solution of the original inequality is therefore
as shown in Figure C.8.

A Two-Interval Solution Set
Solve 
Solution
Using the third property of inequalities and absolute value, you can rewrite
the original inequality as two linear inequalities.
or
The solution set is the union of the disjoint intervals 
and 
as shown
in Figure C.10.
Examples 5 and 6 illustrate the general results shown in Figure C.11. Note that for
the solution set for the inequality 
is a single interval, whereas the
solution set for the inequality 
is the union of two disjoint intervals.
The distance between two points
and 
on the real number line is given by
The directed distance from a to b is 
and the directed distance from b to a is
as shown in Figure C.12.

C.2 The Cartesian Plane
Understand the Cartesian plane.
Use the Distance Formula to find the distance between two points and use the
Midpoint Formula to find the midpoint of a line segment.
Find equations of circles and sketch the graphs of circles.
The Cartesian Plane
Just as you can represent real numbers by points on a real number line, you can represent
ordered pairs of real numbers by points in a plane called the rectangular coordinate
system, or the Cartesian plane, after the French mathematician René Descartes.
The Cartesian plane is formed by using two real number lines intersecting at right
angles, as shown in Figure C.14. The horizontal real number line is usually called the
-axis, and the vertical real number line is usually called the -axis. The point of
intersection of these two axes is the origin. The two axes divide the plane into four parts
called quadrants.
The Cartesian plane
Points represented by ordered pairs
Figure C.14
Figure C.15
Each point in the plane is identified by an ordered pair
of real numbers 
and 
called the coordinates of the point. The number represents the directed distance
from the -axis to the point, and the number represents the directed distance from the
-axis to the point (see Figure C.14). For the point 
the first coordinate is the 
-coordinate or abscissa, and the second coordinate is the -coordinate or ordinate.
For example, Figure C.15 shows the locations of the points 
and 
in the Cartesian plane. The signs of the coordinates of a point determine
the quadrant in which the point lies. For instance, if 
and 
then the point
lies in Quadrant IV.
Note that an ordered pair 
is used to denote either a point in the plane or an
open interval on the real number line. This, however, should not be confusing—the
nature of the problem should clarify whether a point in the plane or an open interval is
being discussed.

The Distance and Midpoint Formulas
Recall from the Pythagorean Theorem that, in a right triangle, the hypotenuse 
and
sides and are related by 
Conversely, if 
then the triangle
is a right triangle (see Figure C.16).
The Pythagorean Theorem:
Figure C.16
Now, consider the problem of determining the distance 
between the two points
and 
in the plane. If the points lie on a horizontal line, then 
and
the distance between the points is 
If the points lie on a vertical line, then
and the distance between the points is 
When the two points do not
lie on a horizontal or vertical line, they can be used to form a right triangle, as shown
in Figure C.17. The length of the vertical side of the triangle is 
and the length
of the horizontal side is 
By the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that
Replacing 
and 
by the equivalent expressions 
and
produces the Distance Formula.

Verifying a Right Triangle
Verify that the points 
and 
form the vertices of a right triangle.
Solution
Figure C.18 shows the triangle formed by the three points. The lengths of
the three sides are as follows.
Because
Sum of squares of sides
and
Square of hypotenuse
you can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to conclude that the triangle is a right triangle.
Using the Distance Formula
Find such that the distance between 
and 
is 5.
Solution
Using the Distance Formula, you can write the following.
Distance Formula
Square each side.
Write in general form.
Factor.
So,
or 
and you can conclude that there are two solutions. That is, each
of the points 
and 
lies five units from the point 
as shown in
Figure C.19.
The coordinates of the midpoint of the line segment joining two points can be
found by “averaging” the -coordinates of the two points and “averaging” the -coordinates
of the two points. That is, the midpoint of the line segment joining the points 
and 
in the plane is
Midpoint Formula
For instance, the midpoint of the line segment joining the points 
and 
is

Equations of Circles
A circle can be defined as the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed
point. The fixed point is the center of the circle, and the distance between the center
and a point on the circle is the radius (see Figure C.21).
You can use the Distance Formula to write an equation for the circle with center
and radius 
Let 
be any point on the circle. Then the distance between 
and the center 
is given by
By squaring each side of this equation, you obtain the standard form of the equation
of a circle.
The standard form of the equation of a circle with center at the origin,
is
If 
then the circle is called the unit circle.
Writing the Equation of a Circle
The point 
lies on a circle whose center is at 
as shown in Figure C.22.
Write the standard form of the equation of this circle.
Solution
The radius of the circle is the distance between 
and 
You can write the standard form of the equation of this circle as
Write in standard form.
By squaring and simplifying, the equation 
can be written
in the following general form of the equation of a circle.
To convert such an equation to the standard form
you can use a process called completing the square. If 
then the graph of the
equation is a circle. If 
then the graph is the single point

Completing the Square
Sketch the graph of the circle whose general equation is
Solution
To complete the square, first divide by 4 so that the coefficients of 
and
are both 1.
Write original equation.
Divide by 4.
Group terms.
Write in standard form.
Note that you complete the square by adding the square of half the coefficient of and
the square of half the coefficient of y to each side of the equation. The circle is centered
at 
and its radius is 1, as shown in Figure C.23.
You have now reviewed some fundamental concepts of analytic geometry. Because
these concepts are in common use today, it is easy to overlook their revolutionary
nature. At the time analytic geometry was being developed by Pierre de Fermat and
René Descartes, the two major branches of mathematics—geometry and algebra—were
largely independent of each other. Circles belonged to geometry and equations belonged
to algebra. The coordination of the points on a circle and the solutions of an equation
belongs to what is now called analytic geometry.
It is important to become skilled in analytic geometry so that you can move
easily between geometry and algebra. For instance, in Example 4, you were given a
geometric description of a circle and were asked to find an algebraic equation for the
circle. So, you were moving from geometry to algebra. Similarly, in Example 5 you
were given an algebraic equation and asked to sketch a geometric picture. In this case,
you were moving from algebra to geometry. These two examples illustrate the two most
common problems in analytic geometry.
1. Given a graph, find its equation.

Angles and Degree Measure
An angle has three parts: an initial ray, a terminal ray, and a vertex (the point of 
intersection of the two rays), as shown in Figure C.24. An angle is in standard
position when its initial ray coincides with the positive -axis and its vertex is at the 
origin. It is assumed that you are familiar with the degree measure of an angle.* It is
common practice to use
(the lowercase Greek letter theta) to represent both an angle
and its measure. Angles between 
and 
are acute, and angles between 
and 
are obtuse.
Positive angles are measured counterclockwise, and 
negative angles are measured clockwise. For instance,
Figure C.25 shows an angle whose measure is 
You 
cannot assign a measure to an angle by simply knowing 
where its initial and terminal rays are located. To measure 
an angle, you must also know how the terminal ray was
revolved. For example, Figure C.25 shows that the angle 
measuring 
has the same terminal ray as the angle 
measuring 
Such angles are coterminal. In general,
if
is any angle, then
is a nonzero integer
is coterminal with 
An angle that is larger than 
is one whose terminal ray has been revolved more
than one full revolution counterclockwise, as shown in Figure C.26. You can form an
angle whose measure is less than 
by revolving a terminal ray more than one full
revolution clockwise.
Coterminal angles

Note that it is common to use the symbol
to refer to both an angle and its measure.
For instance, in Figure C.26, you can write the measure of the smaller angle as  45.

Radian Measure
To assign a radian measure to an angle
consider
to be a central angle of a circle of
radius 1, as shown in Figure C.27.The radian measure of
is then defined to be the length
of the arc of the sector. Because the circumference of a circle is 
the circumference
of a unit circle (of radius 1) is 
This implies that the radian measure of an angle
measuring 
is 
In other words,
radians.
Using radian measure for
the length of a circular arc of radius is 
as
shown in Figure C.28.

The Trigonometric Functions
There are two common approaches to the study of trigonometry. In one, the trigonometric
functions are defined as ratios of two sides of a right triangle. In the other, these 
functions are defined in terms of a point on the terminal side of an angle in standard
position. The six trigonometric functions, sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and
cosecant (abbreviated as sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, and csc, respectively), are defined below
from both viewpoints.
The trigonometric identities listed below are direct consequences of the definitions.

Evaluating Trigonometric Functions
There are two ways to evaluate trigonometric functions: (1) decimal approximations
with a calculator and (2) exact evaluations using trigonometric identities and formulas
from geometry. When using a calculator to evaluate a trigonometric function, remember
to set the calculator to the appropriate mode—degree mode or radian mode.
Exact Evaluation of Trigonometric Functions
Evaluate the sine, cosine, and tangent of 
Solution
Because 
radians, you can draw an equilateral triangle with sides
of length 1 and
as one of its angles, as shown in Figure C.32. Because the altitude of
this triangle bisects its base, you know that 
Using the Pythagorean Theorem, you
obtain
Now, knowing the values of 
and 
you can write the following.
Note that all angles in this text are measured in radians unless stated otherwise. 
For example, when sin 3 is written, the sine of 3 radians is meant, and when 
is
written, the sine of 3 degrees is meant.
The degree and radian measures of several common angles are shown in the table
below, along with the corresponding values of the sine, cosine, and tangent (see Figure
C.33).

The quadrant signs for the sine, cosine, and tangent functions are shown in Figure
C.34. To extend the use of the table on the preceding page to angles in quadrants other
than the first quadrant, you can use the concept of a reference angle (see Figure C.35),
with the appropriate quadrant sign. For instance, the reference angle for 
is 
and because the sine is positive in Quadrant II, you can write
Similarly, because the reference angle for

Graphical Reasoning
In Exercises 63 and 64, find 
and
such that the graph of the function matches the graph in the
figure.
63.
64.
65. Think About It
Sketch the graphs of 
and 
In general, how are the
graphs of 
and 
related to the graph of 
66. Think About It
The model for the height 
of a Ferris
wheel car is
where is measured in minutes. (The Ferris wheel has a radius
of 50 feet.) This model yields a height of 51 feet when 
Alter the model so that the height of the car is 1 foot when
67. Sales
The monthly sales 
(in thousands of units) of a
seasonal product are modeled by
where is the time (in months), with 
corresponding to
January. Use a graphing utility to graph the model for 
and
determine the months when sales exceed 75,000 units.
68. Investigation
Two trigonometric functions and 
have a
period of 2, and their graphs intersect at 
(a) Give one smaller and one larger positive value of 
at
which the functions have the same value.
(b) Determine one negative value of 
at which the graphs 
intersect.
(c) Is it true that 
Give a reason for your
answer.
Pattern Recognition In Exercises 69 and 70, use a graphing
utility to compare the graph of with the given graph. Try to
improve the approximation by adding a term to 
Use a
graphing utility to verify that your new approximation is better
than the original. Can you find other terms to add to make the
approximation even better? What is the pattern? (In Exercise
69, sine terms can be used to improve the approximation, and
in Exercise 70, cosine terms can be used.)

then the first 
derivatives of and 
agree at 
This allows the graph of 
to
resemble the graph of near the point 
61. See “Definitions of 
Taylor Polynomial and 
Maclaurin
Polynomial” on page 638.
63. As the degree of the polynomial increases, the graph of the
Taylor polynomial becomes a better and better approximation
of the function within the interval of convergence. Therefore,
the accuracy is increased.
