Foreword
In the last few years it has become apparent that the introduction of mobile 
technology applications is not progressing in any way close to the forecasts 
and scenarios. A number of technological advances took place alongside the 
introduction of GPRS in Europe. For example colour screens, cameras and 
Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) became available. Such features were 
first introduced in high-end smart phones, which operate with the Symbian 
OS that supports third party services. Java became more mature, which lead 
to the birth of a market for downloadable applications, in particular mobile 
games. Even streaming video to mobile phones became functional and it 
was generally believed that the new and better technology would promote 
and even drive both the emergence and the adoption of new mobile ser-
vices.
3G is a generic term that describes the next generation of mobile com-
munication and 3G refers in particular to high speed and multimedia data 
services. The introduction of 3G was intended to support a usage of high 
speed and multimedia data services and to bridge the gap between mobile 
phones and computing. The vision is – not surprisingly - the same as for the 
introduction of GPRS – higher speed networks, multimedia data services 
and the parallel use of multiple services should translate to more attractive 
mobile services, which will be adopted at increasing rates. As this did not 
happen with the GPRS there are now some elements of desperation and 
frustration in the new scenarios, and quite a few new services have been 
attributed to 3G but they have, in fact, already reached mature stages with 
the GPRS platform. Even services which rely on graphical browsing or mul-
timedia messaging have approached basic availability for regular users. In-
formation services, ticketing and different forms of entertainment are 
maturing services which can be used over a number of mobile technologies, 
including SMS (Short Message Service). Studies of the mobile Internet tend 
to neglect this because they do not consider SMS to be an Internet technol-
ogy. The user is more concerned with the service than the technology and 
the basic form of the service may well be sufficient for the everyday needs 
of the user; more advanced technology may not be seen as value-adding by 
the user; (s)he may not even notice the difference as it is not considered 
relevant.
MMS is commonly considered to be an extension of SMS and should 
therefore represent a natural progression within the industry. What is obvi-
ously not well understood is that MMS is a much more complicated service 
to use and most users do not see enough added values over SMS to adopt 
MMS; what is needed is a value adding usage context. Mobile phones with

wireless data capacity is another “inbred” design – as the use of the web is 
growing and the number of mobile phones is growing, the combination 
should be growing even faster; this is not the case, again we need a value 
adding usage context. 
The basic challenge for GPRS, 3G and sets of new mobile services 
(which are being pushed into the market) is to understand how and why 
people adopt or do not adopt mobile services. In a series of studies of the 
Finnish consumer markets (carried out by IAMSR every year 2002-7) we 
have found that the relationship between technology adoption and the 
adoption of mobile services based on that technology is asynchronous, i.e. 
the adoption processes are different – the adoption processes can even be 
explained from different conceptual frameworks. A partial explanation can 
be found through the insights which are formulated in the so-called Braudel 
Rule. This rule was introduced in the Freedom Economy by Keen-
Mackintosh (2001) and it states that “… freedom becomes value when it 
changes (actually “expands” in the original, French version; the difference is 
significant) the limits of the possible in the structure of everyday routines”; 
when this rule is applied to mobile services we could paraphrase it in the 
following way “… mobile services become mobile value services when they 
offer the possibility to expand the limits of the possible in the structure of 
everyday routines”. This is a simple and effective way to formulate some 
guidelines for understanding what mobile services will create value and what 
mobile services will not make any difference. When applied to mobile ser-
vice markets it may help us explain why some heavily promoted mobile ser-
vices have failed, and why the SMS has been a success even if it was not 
advertised at all in the beginning – it was not even understood to be a mo-
bile service. 
Another partial explanation is, no doubt, that industry aims and con-
sumer needs do not match; consumers are not part of the design process for 
the content/use context. Els van de Kar and Alexander Verbraeck have 
made a significant contribution to this part with the book they have au-
thored: the theory and the methodology for design of service systems, 
which are enabled by new technology advances and innovations, is a crucial 
step for developing mobile value services. The design approach offers the 
means for gaining and systematising a better understanding of what mobile 
service customers want and need in the everyday users’ contexts in order to 
“… expand the limits of the possible in the structure of everyday routines”.

Preface
This book is the second in the Research in Design series. Design is an effort 
that enjoys a growing attention in the academic world. At Delft University 
of Technology design is a recognized part of science. Like other technical 
universities, Delft is rooted in the engineering field. And in spite of  ques-
tions like ‘what is design’, ‘what is engineering’ and ‘what is science’, which 
can be debated in long sessions, and differences that are hard to explain, it is 
possible to feel the differences. In this book we aim to accept the challenge 
of our Rector Magnificus’ call (Fokkema, 2007) to contribute to the devel-
opment of a design language; in this book for the service domain. 
In general we observe that the engineering discipline is expanding into a 
field that embraces perspectives of more disciplines and actors, next to the 
engineer who is responsible for the artefact. The first volume in this Re-
search in Design Series stresses the stakeholder oriented approach in the 
domain of architecture and urban planning (Binnekamp, van Gunsteren, & 
van Loon, 2006). The domain in this volume is services. This is a field in 
which the involvement of different stakeholders with different interests in 
the design process is particularly a critical success factor.  
The design of service systems enabled by new technological opportuni-
ties is not easy. It is not always clear what users really want to do with e-
services, development is costly, devices and available bandwidth change very 
fast, and business models for the different parties involved are not always 
clear. User interaction is also a problem: providing natural input is hard, and 
interfaces like screens might be small and only hold a limited amount of in-
formation. Furthermore, the fragmentation of services which requires to 
link services developed by different organizations remains a big problem. 
Therefore, there is a lot of interest in methods and best practices for the 
design of (mobile) services that are able to combine information from dif-
ferent data sources by ICT and target the information of different organisa-
tions at the individual wishes of the user. Mobile is put between brackets 
since this book can be used two-fold: as a book covering service systems in 
general and as a book focussing on mobile service systems. Our explana-
tions, examples and illustrations are all from the mobile domain. The reason 
is that the challenges to overcome when designing mobile service systems 
are excellent examples for service systems design. Also, we believe that ser-
vices will become ubiquitous and therefore the distinction between services 
and mobile services will become obsolete. The “anytime, anyplace” dimen-
sion promised in the beginning of the Internet Era is becoming reality with 
mobile services being part of our everyday life.

The theory in the book is based on the research on ‘service systems en-
gineering’ as carried out between 2000 and 2005 in the Faculty of Technol-
ogy, Policy and Management of Delft University of Technology. We would 
like to thank all staff members of this programme who contributed to the 
concept and notions of Service System Engineering. Especially we want to 
mention Gert-Jan de Vreede, Harry Bouwman, Rudi Westerveld, Marion 
Wiethoff, Erik Andriessen, Mariëlle den Hengst and René Wagenaar.  We 
are very sorry that it is no longer possible to hand-over this book to René 
Wagenaar who always inspired us and recently passed away.  
Nowadays, the service system domain is part of the Faculty research pro-
grams “Infrastructures” and “Multi-actor systems”. In the Faculty’s educa-
tional programs, we offer courses on ‘Services Systems Engineering’ to 
graduate students and many of the examples in this book have been based 
on assignments carried out by students in these courses. We are grateful to 
the lecturers and students who contributed to and used former versions of 
this book in their courses. A special thanks goes to Mark de Reuver who 
edited one of the former versions of this book. 
Another inspiration for this book is the SmartAmlets© proposal that was 
submitted in October 2003 to the sixth framework programme of the Euro-
pean Union (Carlsson, 2003). Although the proposal was not granted, it was 
very useful as background for this book and we want to thank the pro-
gramme coordinator Christer Carlsson from IAMSR, Åbo University in 
Finland. Furthermore, some of the material in this book has been based on 
the Ph.D. thesis of Van de Kar (2004). We thank all institutes and persons 
who participated in providing information for this book. Finally, we thank 
our co-authors: Wieke Bockstael-Blok, Mirjam Huis in ‘t Veld, Marijn 
Janssen, Carleen Maitland and Yan Wang.  
To conclude we want to stress to our readers that we see the service de-
sign field as an emerging scientific area which is just at its beginning. We 
hope this book will be used in education, by practitioners, and by research-
ers. On our website www.mobileservicedesign.net we will publish educational 
material such as lecture notes and assignments, and references to relevant 
publications.

Introduction 
A key enabler for successful services is the move from a technology-centric 
world, where technology develops almost independently, to a user-centric 
world, where the development and use of technology originate from user 
needs. In this user-centric world companies with different backgrounds 
such as telecommunication, information technology, and media, have to 
cooperate to deliver services for these user needs.  
1.1
What are Services and Service Systems? 
Over the past decades, the nature of organisational work has changed. The 
manufacturing industry is no longer dominant. Today, the services industry, 
producing non-tangible goods, provides the majority of all jobs. In the 
OECD countries services in general account for 70% of total value added, 
and market services for 50% (OECD, 2007, p.48). In the USA more than 
80% of the non-farming workforce was employed in the service-providing 
industry in the first quarter of 2007 (USA Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
http://www.bls.gov.). However, the amount of research aimed at the de-
sign, development and management of services is low. A key characteristic 
of the services industry is the high information content of its products, 
showing the potential for the application of information and communica-
tion technology (ICT). Where ICT was traditionally considered a driver for 
changes in organisational and inter-organisational processes, its role is now 
moving towards becoming an enabler for creating innovative service-related 
concepts. Innovation has been recognised as a key to growth, but the role of 
service-sector innovation has long been under-appreciated (OECD, 2007). 
It is not even clear how to measure service innovation, because service is 
also a very broad concept, see also (Tidd & Hull, 2003). 
There are several definitions of a service, which highlight its main char-
acteristics: “A market transaction, where the object is other than the transfer 
of ownership of a tangible commodity” (Judd, 1964), “Any activity or bene-
fit that one party can offer to another that is essentially intangible and does 
not result in the ownership of anything. Its production may or not be tied to 
a physical product” (Kotler, 1997), and “A (series of) activities of more or 
less intangible nature that normally, but not necessarily, take place in inter-
actions between the customer and service employees and/or physical re-
sources or goods and/or systems of the service provider, which are 
provided as solutions to customer problems” (Grönroos, 2001). The main 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
2
two keywords that characterise every service definition are: transaction and 
intangible. 
Services are not only seen in an inter-organisational setting, such as business 
to consumer (b2c) services (e.g. a banking service using a mobile phone), 
business to business (b2b) services (e.g. a logistics service to organise the on 
time transport of goods between two places), and business to government 
(b2g) services (e.g. a service of the tax authorities to allow companies to file 
their tax statements electronically), but also as services within organisations.
Examples of such services are services from financial departments to the 
rest of the organisation or services for internal teaching and training, also 
called business to employee services (b2e). A final category of potential suc-
cessful services is in the consumer to consumer (c2c) domain; take SMS as 
an example of a well-known service in the c2c domain.  
In this book, we view services from a systems engineering perspective, 
and therefore study service systems which include the user needs translated 
into performance criteria and operational processes, the information and 
communication technology to deliver the service, and the (inter)-
organisational setting needed to develop and deliver the service. Designing 
effective service systems represents a challenge given the convergence in the 
service industry: the design object (the service system) represents an amal-
gamation of the service concept itself, the related organisational structure 
and the supporting information technology architecture. Focusing engineer-
ing efforts in an isolated fashion on one of these three elements is very inef-
fective, because the boundaries between the aspects of the service system 
are not clear and because they are reciprocally interdependent. Hence, there 
is a need for innovative engineering approaches, including design theories, 
design heuristics, modelling techniques and environments (laboratories) in 
which new organisational arrangements for services delivery can be tested 
and evaluated from a strategic, operational and technological perspective. In 
general, there is a need to integrate soft knowledge (e.g. the managerial per-
spective, trust issues, human factors) and hard knowledge (e.g. designing sys-
tems, identifying performance indicators, and developing state-of-the-art 
process simulations). 
Although service jobs are predominant in western economies, the meth-
ods and tools for developing and assessing services are lagging behind in 
comparison with methods and tools to develop products and infrastruc-
tures. This can be seen in several application domains, where organisations 
have big problems in, for instance, defining new services based on high 
bandwidth mobile networks. In spite of the available bandwidth, and the 
availability of necessary hardware, the services that sensibly utilise this 

 
 
1 Introduction

bandwidth are only appearing slowly. We see this, for instance, in the logis-
tics and transport domain, where a shift is visible from purely distributing 
goods to offering door-to-door services that span several nodes of the sup-
ply chain. Transporters and goods are ‘on the move’, but the services to 
support real-time decision making in supply chains are almost unavailable. 
Services that really help the users with the right information at the right time 
in regular situations (e.g. during travel) or in exceptional situations (e.g. dur-
ing a catastrophic event) are also hard to define, design, and deploy. How-
ever, the amount of research aimed at the design and management of 
services is rising (Amaoko-Gyampah & Salam, 2004; Grönroos, 2001; Me-
nor, Tatikonda, & Sampson, 2002; Shulver, 2005; Stevens & Dimitriadis, 
2005; Syson & Perks, 2004; Zeithaml, Bitner, & Gremler, 2006). This litera-
ture shows that the role of ICT is now changing towards an enabler for cre-
ating new service-related concepts. (Menor et al., 2002) argue that ‘the role 
technology plays in New Service Design (NSD) is one critical area requiring 
further exploration’. One approach to do this is to consider services as sys-
tems that consist of different elements and, thus, to take the systems engi-
neering perspective.  
The above examples of service systems usually involve a number of or-
ganisations (or actors), and can therefore be characterised as inter-
organisational systems. Inter-organisational systems are extremely hard to 
design, implement and manage, because there is not one ‘governing’ organi-
sation that can command the others to comply with the same ideas and 
standards. A second factor that complicates the deployment of these ser-
vices in practice is the inherent distributed character of inter-organisational 
services. Information and communication technology is needed to bridge 
the physical and cultural distances between the different organisations, both 
during the design and during the deployment phases. Standard ICT solu-
tions to accomplish this are, however, still lacking, and the effectiveness of 
the solutions that exist is largely unknown, and therefore needs careful at-
tention. Furthermore, the organisations involved are usually from different 
domains with their own habits and cultures. It takes time for these organisa-
tions to develop a common language. Strategic behaviour of the individual 
organisations might influence or even overrule the common interest of the 
network organisation.
1.2
Mobile Services Systems 
In mobile service systems, all the components, such as handsets, content, 
applications, networks, user interfaces, and involved organisations, such as 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
4
operators, content providers, service providers, have to work together to 
provide a mobile service to the users that adds value. If we combine the 
definitions on systems and services, and add the mobile component, the 
following definition for mobile service systems is derived: 
A mobile service system is a group of components that work together for de-
livering a coherent set of activities of intangible nature that provide added 
value for a mobile user using a mobile network. 
This book looks especially at the challenges that organisations face when 
developing mobile, IT-based service systems that cross organisational 
boundaries and as a result cross time and space. Tafazolli et al. (2005) state 
in the strategic research agenda for eMobility in the European Union:  
“Mobile and wireless communications, by the year 2020, is expected to 
play a central role in all aspects of European citizens’ lives. The technology 
will substantially expand on the current concept of ‘anywhere, anytime’ to a 
new paradigm summarised in the following: ‘Individual’s quality of life im-
provement by making available an environment for instant provision and 
access to meaningful multi-sensory information and content’. This vision 
statement demands that the starting point of the design of future systems 
and services should be consideration of a person’s basic needs and interests. 
This basic needs and interest involves comfort and welfare spanning one’s 
personal, family, professional and private life. The technology should be all 
about improving the quality of life in terms of; wealth creation, improving 
education, improving job skills, enhancing health, security and safety and 
stipulating appropriate entertainment at the right time with appropriate con-
tent in a secure and reliable manner.” 
The realisation of innovative mobile service systems demands multidis-
ciplinary research and development that crosses scientific and industrial 
boundaries. We aim to contribute to this by addressing the design issues for 
mobile service system from a socio-technical perspective.  
Many of the problems regarding mobile, IT-based services can be solved 
by targeting the distributed nature and isolated deployment of mobile appli-
cations, by increasing the ease of use given the fact that screens and key-
boards are small, and by providing business models that facilitate the linking 
of the applications and services of service providers when more providers 
are involved. One of the most promising ways to create viable services for 
mobile devices is to add extra intelligence to the services, both at the back-
end and in the mobile device itself. The extra intelligence has to limit the 
cumbersome user interaction with the mobile device, speed up the handling 
of the transactions and ease the integration of different services that need to 

 
 
1 Introduction 
 
 
 
5
be accessed in order to complete more complex transactions. Intelligent 
services should be adaptive and intelligent (“smart”) software modules, 
which are bundled from the perspective of the user and controlled by the 
context of the user. These software modules should be able to operate in a 
heavily distributed and multi-provider environment, and depend on mobile 
communication. With this type of services it should be easy for any person 
at any place, independent of preference, age, gender, education, background 
and nationality, to access services and complete transactions using a mobile 
device in an easy and efficient way. 
In order to realise the rich mobile services landscape, the availability of 
intelligent software will be a critical success factor that can hide the com-
plexity for the user, possess learning capabilities and so enable context 
aware personalised services. 
Intelligent information management also implies a much higher level of 
user modelling than is currently the case, for the organisation, processing 
and presentation of data. Most current projects implement user profiling
where the user’s likely behaviour is inferred from a set of keywords. The 
challenge is to move to the next stage – user modelling – in which a much 
richer representation and processing capability will be required. Representa-
tion needs to be more than attribute – value pairs, for example hierarchies 
of interests, and user models that are themselves programs. It also needs to 
model “usual” as well as definite preferences – for example, a hotel booking 
system should know that I prefer a room that is single-bedded (normally, 
but this is not a strong preference), non-smoking (always) with breakfast 
included (but I like this to be an option to be decided according to my 
schedule).
Another aspect of the representation that needs to be modelled is time-
varying preferences e.g. my browsing behaviour is different at weekends 
(leisure time) and during the week (business time). Finally the user model 
needs to be easily expandable for new services. Therefore it is necessary to 
develop an effective and scalable framework which can be embedded within 
any system to provide personalisation of system response, and understand 
ability and modifiability for the user. In particular this will include personal-
ised hierarchical classification, so that content and services are presented in 
a manner convenient for the user.  
At first sight, it may seem strange that it turns out to be so hard to create 
successful applications for high bandwidth mobile devices. The issue has 
been addressed in many publicly and privately funded projects, but, until 
now, with very limited success. One of the reasons is that mobile applica-

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
6
tions – often heavily distributed – are hard to develop. Another reason is 
that the business models are unclear: the organisation paying for the devel-
opment is often not the one receiving the revenues from the use of the mo-
bile application. Furthermore, the added value for the users appears to have 
been very limited until now: the small screen and small keyboard do not 
provide an easy user interface for more complex applications. A final reason 
is the isolated deployment of the applications, which force the user to access 
several applications sequentially to complete more complex transactions 
from the mobile device.  
Breakthroughs are needed in three different fields, in order to make ser-
vices intelligent. Firstly, the intelligence itself has to be designed, in such a 
way that it is flexible and can be easily deployed both on the client side and 
in the back office. Secondly, these adaptive, intelligent services differ so 
much from more traditional applications, that new design methods are 
needed that take the distribution of applications and providers into account. 
Finally, the bundling from the perspective of the user needs to take place. 
Only when the applications are aware of user needs and the user context, 
will it be possible to create added value for a particular user by taking away 
interaction steps that are ‘standard’ for that user.  
1.3
Domains for developing mobile services 
For this book, we chose example case studies from four domains that might 
benefit from mobile service technologies. Two domains are more domi-
nated by personal requirements and two are determined by the requirements 
of organisations. We explicitly do not label it as consumer and business 
market since mobile services are mostly individually used, in private or work 
circumstances. Another distinction is the frequency of use: do people use 
the services continually or incidentally. We immediately admit that Table 1-1 
is somewhat fuzzy since individuals might also be personally involved in 
crisis situations as a victim, workers need information, and so on.

The first domain is travel support. Especially when ‘on the road’, outside of 
the well-known day-to-day context, users have a need for support. As fixed 
connections are seldom available to access all kinds of personal transactions 
and choices, travel support is a good domain to check the applicability and 
added value of mobile services. Take a business traveller who is at a meeting 
that takes longer than expected and has to fly to the next destination one 
day later. This person would like to book a hotel at the current location, re-
schedule the flight, shift the taxi ride to the airport to the next morning (but 
then from the newly booked hotel and, dependent on the time of the new 
flight), cancel the hotel booking at the next location for one night, shift the 
taxi ride at the next location, and inform the partners at the next location 
that a delayed arrival is possible. With current mobile applications, it would 
take dozens of interactions and wading through long lists of flights, phone 
numbers and hotels to complete this simple ‘change of delaying travel by 
one night’. Probably it would be easiest to call on human resources in the 
own organisation or at a travel agency, who would also need one to several 
hours to carry out this change. Given the fact that all the bookings and 
payment information are individually accessible in an electronic way and, in 
the near future, from any mobile device, it is absurd that such a transaction 
should take so much effort and so much time to complete. 
The second domain is mobile information and entertainment services (MIES). 
These services have a high end-user context, and in Japan it has been shown 
that these services might well be the ‘killer application’, or the ‘breakthrough 
service’, especially for young people. Examples in this book show informa-
tion on sports and cultural heritage, through which we can look at the dif-
ferences between younger and older users in ease of accessing the services. 
Both b2c and c2c services can be considered here. The mobile information 
and entertainment service (MIES) domain is often quoted as a breakthrough 
application for mobile services, and the storyline could evolve as follows. A 
cyclist wants to do one of the famous classic cycle tours in Europe and gets 
travel descriptions dynamically on her mobile phone as she follows the 
route. On the road, she can get information about historical events that 
have taken place and when she passes a cultural heritage site which fits her 
interest profile she receives information and visiting options. Then the mo-
bile phone can be used to pay for extra information or admittance fees. And 
since the classic cycle tours are organised tours she can always get logistic 
support from the tour organiser and immediate help, e.g. in case of an 
emergency.  
The third domain is that of mobile workforce solutions. This is a business 
domain, and the users will be mobile workers. Mobile workers are consid-

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
8
ered to be people whose professional tasks can only be completed in a “mo-
bile environment”, which refers to the user’s mobility and the need for 
technology that supports this mobility. Four fundamental aspects of mobile 
work are mobile workers, mobile tasks, mobile context, and mobile tech-
nology (Yuan & Zjeng, 2005). Examples of mobile workforces are sales-
people in the field, travelling executives, people working in corporate yards 
and warehouses, and repair or installation employees who work at custom-
ers’ sites.  The nature of the services will be mainly b2b/b2e.  One example 
is logistic chain management, where persons can use mobile services to 
speed up logistic processes, inform other partners in the chain about delays 
or problems, and jointly assess and solve these problems. Mobile workforce 
solutions can be used to simplify operations, carry out tasks in real time in 
order to reduce administrative routines and to give operators needed knowl-
edge, provide information in the form needed, at the moment when needed 
and where needed, and ultimately reduce costs in each part of the logistic 
chain if it can be implemented in an effective and user supportive way.  
The fourth domain from which examples are included in this book is cri-
sis management. When we take emergency workers who are typical users of 
services in a crisis situation, we see, for instance, a clear need for flexible 
communication and for situational awareness. Because every crisis that 
emergency workers face is different, the services offered have to be quickly 
adaptable to the specific situation. What makes the design of end-user ser-
vices for crises so difficult is that emergency workers can easily suffer from 
an information overload, and due to the nature of their work they have very 
limited space and time to interact with devices. In hazardous conditions, the 
potential use of IT devices is even more limited. When we add the complex-
ity of overloaded networks during a crisis situation and the continuously 
changing picture of the crisis based on information that is slowly gathered 
by many different people and organisations, it is clear that the crisis man-
agement domain is one of the most difficult domains for service design. 
1.4
Service Systems Framework 
An ICT based mobile service system is part of a larger system. Systems are 
mostly associated with components, the relations between them and the 
purpose for which they are made. The purpose we are interested in in this 
book is to produce a service for end-users. We want to engineer, i.e. to de-
sign, make and maintain service systems. In this chapter we introduce a Ser-
vice Systems Framework and the characteristics of mobile service systems. 
The three main aspects of this framework will be discussed in more detail in 

 
 
1 Introduction 
 
 
 
9
the next three chapters. Sections 1.6 and 1.7 will show two design examples 
of service systems designed by our M.Sc. students, to illustrate the service 
systems framework. 
Service systems design is an extremely complex activity, and it encom-
passes several different disciplines. Therefore, we distinguish a number of 
different aspects that need attention when designing a service system. First, 
we need a service concept, which is the essence of the service which expresses 
how to create value for its users. Secondly, an appropriate organisational net-
work should be in place that supports the (distributed) service production 
from an (inter)organisational point of view. The organisational network 
provides, for instance, the co-ordination between the resources, such as 
people and knowledge, in a (set of) service organisation(s). Thirdly, a technical
architecture should be provided as well. For mobile service systems this in-
cludes of course information and communication technology. This technical 
architecture structures software, hardware, and netware that enable the de-
livery of a service. These three aspects, service concept, organisational net-
work and technical architecture are of course very much interrelated, and 
are usually addressed concurrently.  
For the total picture, see Figure 1-1. The picture also shows the interde-
pendencies and trade-offs that need to be managed between the aspects. 
The technical and organisational network determines both the service con-
cept that can or cannot be realised given the organisations that take part in 
the service system and the limitations of the technical architecture that is 
available to deliver the service. On the other hand, the organisational net-
work and technical architecture also heavily determine the actual service 
delivery to the user. 
The service system is positioned in an environment or application do-
main that is in a certain phase that can be labelled as trend. Furthermore, it 
might be dominated by other issues, the social, political and legal issues. 
This includes privacy issues, regulatory limitations, and ethical considera-
tions. The economical aspects are also relevant. From the outside world de-
velopments on for instance the stock-market and the labour market 
influence the service system. Inside the service system financial aspects have 
to be taken into account. (Faber et al., 2003) include the financial arrange-
ments as a separate aspect of business models for services in their STOF 
framework. In our framework, we do not separate the financial aspect as 
another element, and the pricing model for the customer is part of the ser-
vice concept; revenue models between partners are part of the organisa-
tional network, and costs are part of all three aspects.  

Designing Mobile Service Systems

Figure 1-1. Distinguished aspects of a service system 
In the service innovation model (Hertog, Broersma, & Ark, 2003) four 
dimensions for service innovation are distinguished: the technology dimen-
sion and three non-technology dimensions: the service concept, the client 
interface and the service delivery system. In our framework the first two 
elements are integrated into the service concept. The delivery system of the 
service is related to operational processes behind services. It depends on the 
system boundaries which aspects have to be taken into account. Designers 
choose the system boundaries based on the relevant issues in the specific 
application domain of their service system, e.g. a health care service or a 
transportation service. 
Mobile service systems are closely related to distributed information sys-
tems, and as such the service systems engineering field can learn much from 
the distributed or inter-organisational information systems field when de-
signing services systems, as we will see in chapter 5. There are, however, 

 
 
1 Introduction 
 
 
 
11
also several differences. Where information systems are usually aimed at 
realising the (support for) operational processes, the service system starts 
with a service concept that is offered to a set of (potential) customers. The 
service systems designer focuses on the added value that can be delivered 
through carefully designed interfaces for the users of the service. Because 
services are aimed at delivering added value through their interfaces, it is 
possible to link services and to have parallel services that are delivering the 
same or similar content through different channels. Think of the banking 
service of providing bank account information: the same information from 
the same underlying banking information system can be delivered on paper, 
by phone, through on-line banking or Internet access, and through an 
Automated Teller Machine. This example also shows an interesting link be-
tween the two fields; that service systems are usually built on top of sets of 
existing information systems that are already in place in organisations in-
volved in the service delivery.  
The challenge of designing mobile information service systems is a com-
bination of the design of service systems and the design of information sys-
tems in an inter-organisational setting. During this design process choices 
have to be made. These choices concern the trade-offs between the aspects 
of the service system as shown in Figure 1-1. An example of such a trade-
off is the choice between the position accuracy of a location-based service 
demanded by the user, and the position accuracy that can be provided by 
the available reliable technology (accuracy versus reliability). These trade-
offs have to be made between two aspects but sometimes also between 
three aspects, within one aspect or between the aspects and the environ-
ment. It might be more efficient to start testing a best effort solution than 
to continue searching for an optimal solution. In the next three chapters we 
will further elaborate on the three main aspects of the service framework: 
service concept, technical architecture and organisational network. To pre-
pare for this more in-depth discussion, we will discuss the typical character-
istics of mobile service systems in the next section. 
1.5
Mobile services systems characteristics 
A service system is aimed at providing added value for its users. This added 
value is realised when users can use the service system, and really do use the 
service system. This usage of the service is part of the service concept, en-
abled by a good technical architecture, and offered by a good organisational 
network. The design process of the mobile service system can start at any of 
these three aspects. The service system might be developed based on an 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
12
idea for a new service concept that adds value to users. The service system 
might be developed because a new technology has arrived from the lab. Or 
an organisational network has changed and therefore the service system had 
to be re-designed. Depending on the ‘triggering aspect’ the requirements for 
the service system will change.  
The usage of mobile services implies costs and benefits. This holds for 
companies as well as for consumers. For companies that want to incorpo-
rate mobile solutions in their business processes the value can be made ex-
plicit by the identification of fundamental objectives (Nah, Siau, & Sheng, 
2005). Nah et al. consider the following as the most important fundamental 
objectives: efficiency, effectiveness, customer satisfaction, security, cost and 
employee acceptance. Deighton (2003) indicates in a Gartner study the costs 
to achieve the potential benefits of mobile workforce solutions. Wang et al. 
(2005) summarised these benefits and costs for workforce solutions and we 
further extended it for mobile services in general; see Table 1-2.

We will illustrate the design of a mobile service system with two design 
examples, ‘Guido the Guide’ and ‘Relief workers’. For both design examples 
we will describe the three main aspects of the framework of Figure 1-1, il-
lustrating how these aspects can be described and how they relate to each 
other. The ‘Guido the Guide’ design example is triggered by a new service 
concept and the ‘Relief workers’ design example is triggered by opportuni-
ties to improve an existing service system that is already being used.  
1.6
Design example: Guido the Guide 
This design example concerns a service system that is developed for the travel-
ling domain. The service system assists tourists who are in an unfamiliar city, and 
have some spare time. It gives suggestions to these tourists on how they can 
spend this spare time, taking personal preferences and the context of the user 
into account. Personalisation and localisation are thus important issues in the 
design example.  
1.6.1
Service Concept 
Imagine that you are a tourist in London and that you just visited Tower Bridge. 
In the evening you have to visit your uncle in Notting Hill. Now, you are looking 
for an activity for the afternoon. You take your mobile device and ask Guido the 
Guide to propose an interesting programme for the afternoon according to your 
known preferences. The service knows where you are now and where you have 
to be tonight and at what time. With only a few clicks the service presents a list 
of possible routes for the afternoon. Each programme consists of an interesting 
set of activities that meet your personal interests. You select the programme you 
like best. Then, the mobile device tells you where to walk or tells you which pub-
lic transport you need. In the latter case it will lead you to the nearest station. 
While following the route, the service gives you some facts about the points of 
interest you pass on your route.  
When the Guido the Guide service generates the possible programs it takes 
several factors into account. Firstly, it knows where you are. By looking up your 
schedule it knows where you have to be in the evening. Of course, if you do not 
have any appointments that day, it would be possible to specify a location and 
end time yourself. The service will plan a route that has a starting point, your 
current location, and will end at the location where you have to be tonight. Of 
course it will take the time constraints into account as well.  
As mentioned before, the service knows your personal interests. These are not 
only used to select points of interest for your along the way, but also in planning 
the routes. Imagine that it is 11:00 hours when you ask your mobile device to 
devise a programme for you. The service knows that you usually have lunch be-

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
14
tween 12:00 and 13:00. It will take this into account and plan a stop at a res-
taurant at your usual lunchtime. If you like fast food more than an Italian lunch, it 
will automatically search for a snack bar along the route. If there is an attraction 
that exactly fits your personal preferences, but is far away, then you do not have 
time to lunch at a restaurant. It will also give this route, but puts it lower in the 
ranking. Many other aspects can be taken in account, such as the weather fore-
cast. If it knows you like theatres, it will search for an interesting play, see 
whether tickets are still available, and if you confirm you want to go there, the 
service will book a ticket for you. 
User process
In order to show how the service will work, a sketch of the user interfaces will 
be given. This is done by the use of a storyboard. 
It all starts with a person in a new city. And some spare time... What to do? 
Fortunately, Guido the Guide can help: 
With several clicks the user starts the service: 

 
 
1 Introduction 
 
 
 
15
Guido presents several routes to the user. The user chooses the route from the 
list he/she likes best. The route starts by presenting a map, and telling the user 
where to go... 
When the user walks by some interesting attractions (according to the per-
sonal profile) he/she immediately gets relevant information. As a result, the user 
follows a complete route, finishing at the right time and location. 
1.6.2
Organisational network 
Many information sources and sub-services are needed to fulfil the requirements 
for this service system. Where does all the information come from? Which sub-
services are needed? Who is responsible for which part of the information? 
Many parties have to collaborate to make this service a success. How should this 
be arranged? And how can this result in a viable service? The following actors 
can be distinguished who should make arrangements and distribute costs to de-
liver this service: 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
16
Guido the Guide service organisation. This is the actor that will set up and man-
age the service. This firm will be responsible for the functioning of the service. 
The “Guido the Guide” users will be clients of this actor, and therefore pay this 
actor. This actor has to make sure that the service works properly, and to deliver 
the correct information to the user.
GIS (Geographic Information System) provider. The information about the loca-
tion of the user will be retrieved using either GPS positioning or the positioning 
capabilities of the telecommunications network. Both will produce x-y coordi-
nates. These coordinates need to be translated into an address, postal code or a 
map. To do this, a GIS provider will be needed. 
Weather information provider. The service will make use of the local weather 
forecast. At least the service needs to have an answer to the question whether it 
will rain or not. Therefore a weather information provider will be needed. 
Public Transport information provider. The service may advise making use of 
public transport. Therefore it needs to know where stations are, what the lines 
are, how long transportation will take, and so on. There are many service pro-
viders who can give this kind of information. For every city in which the service is 
available a Public Transport information provider has to be contracted. 
Tourist information providers. To make this service work, information about at-
tractions, restaurants, cinemas, and so on in a city is needed. This might be one 
service that is already available in the city, or a collection of services from differ-
ent providers with whom separate contracts might be made.  
Booking service provider. The service needs to have access to a system to book 
tickets for the cinemas and theatres. Therefore, a party will be needed that pro-
vides such a system, for example via the Internet.  
Mobile network provider. The whole service will be presented on a mobile device 
to the user. This mobile device has to make contact with the server. Therefore it 
makes use of a GPRS or UMTS connection that is provided by a mobile network 
provider. To make sure that the user can use the service in any country, roaming 
agreements will be needed between different network providers. In a case where 
the positioning takes place using the positioning capabilities of the UMTS net-
work, this actor will also provide the x-y coordinates of the user. 
1.6.3
Technical architecture 
This section briefly describes the technical architecture of the service system, see 
Figure 1-2. 
The user accesses the service with his mobile device. The user is in a city and 
the mobile device sets up a connection to a local telecom operator. When the 
user is abroad, a roaming agreement is needed between this local telecom op-

 
 
1 Introduction 
 
 
 
17
erator and the user’s home operator. Via the UMTS or GPRS connection, the 
user is able to access the Internet. By this he/she can log on to the main server. 
Of course, this all happens by just selecting this service from a favourites list. 
The main server, that hosts the service, is also connected to the Internet. By 
the use of the Internet the service makes connection to all sub-services needed to 
provide the user with the route information. The main server also consists of a 
database with the personal profiles of the known users.

Result 
This design example illustrated how a service system can be developed by start-
ing with the context of a specific user. From this point on, first the concept of the 
mobile service is designed and next the other elements of the service system are 
determined.

1.7
Design example: Port Emergency Response System 
This is a design example in the crisis management domain. The context of the 
service system that is described consists of the activities of relief workers in the 
Port of Rotterdam. In a large port, there is always a risk that a major crisis can 
take place, for example the breakout of a fire in a location where fuel is stored. 
Once relief workers are present at the scene of such an emergency, they have to 
know what to do and they need to communicate and learn about the location of 
the disaster. The service systems that are currently used to do so have significant 
shortcomings. In this design example, a new service system is described that 
aims to solve these shortcomings, by providing real-time information to relief 
workers from different existing service systems and data sources about the emer-
gency situation and on how to respond to it.  
This design example illustrates how a service system can be designed when 
starting with the shortcomings of an existing service system.
1.7.1
Organisational network 
The responsibility for crisis response in the Port of Rotterdam is located in one 
office, called the Rotterdam Port Authority (RPA). One of the mission critical tasks 
of the RPA is the mitigation of crises and disasters in collaboration with other 
teams.
Once a crisis exceeds a certain magnitude, and cannot be considered a rou-
tine accident that can be solved independently by one or several different service 
organisations, actors from these organisations join to form a Commando Place 
Incident team (CoPI team). The CoPI team should be read as a local crisis re-
sponse team. The core tasks of a CoPI team are (Appelman & Van Driel, 2005): 

To coordinate the deployment of crisis mitigation units in the area of the in-
cident 

To guide and direct the operational execution of all involved teams 

To take measures aimed at the prevention of more casualties 

To provide information about the repression of the crisis to a higher-level 
Regional Operational Team (RegOT) 

To request potential support from RegOT 
In case of an emergency in the port of Rotterdam, the following four impor-
tant actors will be active as relief worker teams: 

Police. For traffic control and public control. There are different kinds of po-
licemen, for instance the national Dutch police force, the water police, and 
the harbour police. In this case they are considered as one, because their 
tasks are quite similar.

 
 
1 Introduction 
 
 
 
19

Medical workers. In an emergency situation there is a chance that there will 
be victims who need immediate medical treatment. This will be done by am-
bulances with medical workers who are experienced in helping victims at 
emergency locations. 

Fire brigade. A fire in the port is a potential crisis. Firemen should try to 
control and diminish the fire as soon as possible. 

Commando Place Incident team (CoPI team). This is a team that is formu-
lated at the RPA in emergency situations. The team consists of experts in dif-
ferent fields of experience. Together the team has knowledge about the local 
situation at the port. Because the team is going to help locally they can be 
considered as relief workers too.  
Next to these relief workers there are some actors who support the relief 
workers directly. 

Experts. These experts are for instance in charge of measuring the amount of 
chemical gas in the air and giving an indication of the danger for all people 
and especially relief workers in the area. 

Rotterdam Port Authority (RPA). In case of a crisis these headquarters are 
occupied by employees from different departments: Traffic, Operations & 
Maintenance, Dangerous & Poisonous Substances, Security, Processing and 
Information, and Regulations & Law enforcement. The RPA is the first line of 
command when a crisis occurs. After the crisis has been reported, the emer-
gency call centre contacts the RPA. The RPA is responsible for further emer-
gency handling. 

Emergency call centre. The Emergency call centre is the first contact point in 
case of emergencies. The main role is to handle incoming calls and transfer 
the situation to the RPA. There is also a role for the emergency call centre to 
provide advice and information to incoming calls from people in the area. 
Table 1-3 gives a general overview of the most likely activities for the differ-
ent relief workers in case of a fire.

The table shows that there is much more information required than the main 
actors can provide themselves. At least four resources of information are needed. 
To discover who can provide this missing information the following questions 
should be asked:

1.7.2
Service concept 
There is a need for a new service that enables relief workers to do their job bet-
ter in crisis situations. We will call this service the Harbour Emergency Response 
System (HERS). The goal of the HERS is to facilitate relief workers with real-time 
and relevant information in crisis situations in the Port of Rotterdam. So in short: 
the main concept of the service that we want to design is a system that provides 
real-time information from different services and data sources about what the 
situation is and how to respond to it in emergency situations. This section will 
illustrate the service concept. 
It is expected that better communication and better available information will 
improve the effectiveness of the relief workers. The service system will help by 
providing all kinds of information on the Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) of the 
relief workers. The relief workers can use the PDA to communicate with each 
other as well. On the screen, the first teams can indicate exactly where the disas-
ter occurred, so other teams can take the shortest routes. If roads are congested 
or blocked, the teams can see that on their PDA and take another route to the 
disaster area.  
So, the service system will provide five types of functionality to the relief 
workers. First, the PDA will provide the relief workers with information about the 
location of the disaster. Second, the PDA is used by the relief workers to commu-
nicate with each other. This communication can take place via voice and text 
exchange, but video and picture messaging will also be possible. The improved 
communication is expected to lead to higher productivity of the relief workers. 
Third, the PDA will show which actions need to be taken by the relief workers 
and which resources are available to them. This improves the quality and speed 
of decisions that are made by the relief workers. Fourth, the PDAs will store the 
information that has been exchanged and the actions that have been taken. As 
such, it enables ex-post evaluation about how the crisis was handled. Fifth, the 
service system will use the PDAs to find the location of the relief workers, which 
gives a better overview of the situation. 
Figure 1-3 shows an example of a possible screen lay-out. A route indicates 
how to get to the fire as soon as possible. On the screen it is visible where relief 
teams are located. It is also possible to see which roads are blocked.

Technical architecture 
An overview of the technical architecture is given in Figure 1-4. The technical 
architecture is based on the three tier model (see chapter 3 of this book). This 
architecture consists of a presentation layer, an application layer and a data 
layer.
Data layer
Data is needed from various distributed sources. These include data from the 
currently used emergency response systems, data from a traffic information ser-
vice, data about the location and loads of ships, and data about the working 
schedules of port workers. It is not desirable, and probably also not feasible to 
integrate all these data sources in the HERS service system. Therefore, all these 
existing data sources will stay in place, and all actors will remain responsible for 
their own data.  

 
 
1 Introduction 
 
 
 
23
Application layer
The main task of the application layer will be to make sure that the right data 
comes from the right data sources to the right users at the right moment. This is 
also the main functionality of the HERS service system. 
Presentation layer
The presentation layer describes how the service should be presented on the 
small screens and how the users can interact with the service system. For exam-
ple, the location of other relief workers and of the disaster will be visualised on a 
map that is shown on the screen of the PDA. The relief workers can access a 
menu on their PDA in which they can scroll through different functions. Personal 
settings will be stored on the device and can easily be altered by the relief work-
ers.

The presentation layer also describes how the RPA and the call centre will re-
ceive information from the HERS service system. This information is, for example, 
about the location and status of the relief worker teams. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
24
Communication
The communication between the data providing services and the application 
layer will be done by using, for example, the Simple Object Access Protocol 
(SOAP). This protocol provides a way to wrap information into ‘envelopes’ that 
can be exchanged platform independent between different services. A SOAP 
message from the traffic information service will for instance tell which roads are 
congested. Once this information comes in at the application layer it is immedi-
ately transferred to those devices who are receiving traffic information from that 
specific area. 
Messages between the presentation layer and the application layer will be 
exchanged by using eXtended Mark-up Language (XML). This is a standard way 
of marking up data so the structure of the information is understood by sender 
and receiver. The PDAs will convert the received XML-data to visible information 
on the screen. Computers in call centre and RPA will do the same, though for 
larger screens.  
Communication between the data providing services and the HERS service 
system will take place over the fixed broadband Internet lines that are already 
available. These lines are also used for communication between the HERS service 
system and the RPA and call centre. Communication between the application 
layer and the PDAs will take place over the wireless UMTS network. In order to 
enable UMTS communications some technical arrangements should be made 
with an UMTS service provider. The service management will pay the UMTS op-
erator for the data traffic. A problem is the current low coverage of the UMTS 
network. In order to receive the signals everywhere in the port, a denser network 
will be needed.  
To get information about the location of relief workers, some form of position-
ing technology is needed. Therefore, a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver 
will be integrated into the PDA. It may also be possible to use the positioning 
capabilities of the UMTS network. In that case, a GPS receiver will not be 
needed. The coordinates of each device will be sent periodically to the HERS 
service system.

Result 
This design example has illustrated how an existing service system can be im-
proved. The design example description started by analysing the current organ-
isational network and work practices of relief workers in the port of Rotterdam, 
and the shortcomings of these practices. Then, requirements for a new service 
were generated to solve these problems. Based on that, a new service concept 
was developed, as well as a technical architecture that supports this concept. 
Remarkable about the design example is that the organisational network remains

the same with this new service system. This is an advantage, as changes in an 
organisational network can be time consuming and costly. 
1.8
Comparison of the two design examples 
Both designs pay attention to the service concept, the technical architecture, 
and the organisational network: one in the domain of Information and En-
tertainment and the other in the domain of Crisis Management. There are 
also other differences between the two design examples. One difference is 
that ‘Guido the Guide’ is aimed at consumers (b2c), whereas ‘Support for 
relief workers in the Port of Rotterdam’ is aimed at employees of the emer-
gency services (b2b/b2e). Another difference is that ‘Guido the Guide’ is a 
design for a new service that does not replace any current services. The 
‘Support for relief workers in the Port of Rotterdam’ design is aimed at en-
hancing the current working methods of the relief workers in case of emer-
gency situations in the port. As a result, the design approach of the two 
groups was different, which can be seen from the section titles of the two 
design descriptions. The ‘Relief workers’ student team started by analysing 
the current way of working, the current problems, and the current organisa-
tional structure. Based on the analysis of the current situation, they formu-
lated requirements for the service to be designed. After that, they designed 
the service, staying close to the current work practices and the current or-
ganisational network to enable the embedding of the service into the current 
organisational structure and work processes. The ‘Guido the Guide’ group 
designed a totally new service that did not build on existing services that 
could be studied. Therefore, they started with a service concept without 
analysing the current situation. 
1.9
Structure of the book 
The structure of the book is as follows. In this introductory chapter, we 
have explained the domain of (mobile) service systems. In the next three 
chapters of the book, the aspects of the domain will be described in detail; 
this part answers the question “what is service systems design”? The chapters 
pay attention to the following aspects: service concept (chapter 2), technical 
architecture (chapter 3), and organisational network (chapter 4). Within and 
between the chapters, practical examples are given to illustrate the theory 
presented in the chapters. After this, we explain how to design those systems. 
Methodologies for service systems design should be able to support the de-
sign process for both existing services and new services. Chapter 5 provides 
the methodological background, and chapter 6 gives an example of a design

method that can be used for designing mobile service systems. Chapter 7 
provides an extensive case study with an application of the design method 
of chapter 6.

Service Concept 
The service concept is the differentiating value proposition as demanded by 
the end-user. It expresses how the service creates value for users. The ‘ser-
vice concept’ is one of the three aspects of the service systems framework, 
and it will be further explained in this chapter. First we discuss services in 
general and information services in particular, then we will zoom in on mo-
bile information services. We describe ways to categorise mobile informa-
tion services and present the characteristics of mobile information services; 
divided into general characteristics and characteristics that are specific for 
the consumer and business market. Next, we discuss the value and the qual-
ity of mobile services. This is followed by theories around the acceptance of 
services and pricing of services. The service concept aspect of the service 
systems framework is illustrated with two examples of mobile services, one 
for consumers and one for businesses.  
2.1
Concepts of mobile information services 
Designing services differs from designing physical goods since services and 
goods have different characteristics. The services literature provides a set of 
generally accepted definitions of traditional services (Bateson, 1992; Grön-
roos, 2001; Kasper, van Helsdingen, & de Vries, 1999; Kotler, 1997; 
Zeithaml et al., 2006). Grönroos identifies three basis characteristics of ser-
vices: 1) services are processes consisting of activities or a series of activities 
rather than things; 2) services are at least to some extent produced and con-
sumed simultaneously; 3) and the customer, to a greater or lesser extent, 
participates in the service production process. A comparison of a set of 
similar and generally accepted characteristics of traditional services, and the 
equivalent characteristics of physical goods is presented in Table 2-1.

The differences between products and services (as shown in Table 2-1) 
have consequences for adapting product design theories for service design. 
E.g. the quality of an activity or process is more difficult to measure than 
the quality of a thing. The question is whether a mobile information service 
can be considered as a pure service, because the mobile service is so de-
pendent on a handset. The characteristics of the handset are relevant for 
designing mobile information services, e.g. the size and resolution of the 
screen for the user interface of the service, and the keyboard of the mobile 
phone with limited data entry possibilities. The services and the physical 
goods necessary to use the service are related and interdependent. In addi-
tion to the differences between services and physical goods, electronic ser-
vices differ from traditional services. The common denominator that 
distinguishes e-services from regular services is the availability of the service 
via an Internet channel, which makes it accessible from anywhere and con-
sumable 24 hours a day. The following definition for an e-service is based 
on the definitions of Grönroos (2001) and Kasper et al. (1999): 
‘An e-service is an activity or series of activities of intangible nature that 
take place in interaction through an Internet channel between customers 
and service employees or systems of the service provider, which are pro-
vided as solutions to customer problems, add value and create customer 
satisfaction’.

Figure 2-1. Positioning services, e-services and mobile e-services 
Mobile e-services are a subset of both mobile services and of informa-
tion services or e-services, as shown in Figure 2-1. Mobile voice services are 
a subset of mobile services but not of mobile e-services. Considering the 
dynamic developments around technology and the use of technology one 
might wonder whether the distinction between e-services and mobile e-
services will still exist in the future. After all, mobility keeps growing and 
people request the information they need more and more place and time 
independent.   
When the information services definition is extended to include the mo-
bile aspect the following definition for mobile information service is de-
rived:
‘A mobile information service is an activity or series of activities of intangi-
ble nature that occur when the consumer is mobile and a mobile telecom-
munications network supports the interaction through an Internet channel 
between customers and service employees or systems of a service provider. 
The aim is to provide solutions to customer problems and needs, add value, 
and thus create customer satisfaction’. 
The heterogeneous quality of mobile e-services and the difficulty of 
measuring their quality are relevant when designing mobile information ser-
vices. Given this heterogeneous quality, the design of mobile e-services is 
complicated by the fact that different stakeholders are involved in the de-
sign of a mobile information service; that all these actors may have different 
perceptions regarding the user requirements for the services; and that these 
expectations regarding the technological performance often exceed what is 
possible in reality.

A widely acknowledged way of looking at service quality is to make a dis-
tinction between the outcome (what) and the process (how) (Grönroos, 
2001). The service outcome quality, also defined as technical quality, can be 
measured objectively by both producer and consumer.
The ‘what’ represents the value of the service for the users. We further 
discuss the ‘what’ in section 2.3; the ‘how’ is related to the process and how 
the user perceives the quality of the service. The processes determining the 
added value are discussed in section 2.4, service acceptance in section 2.5, 
and the service quality dimensions in section 2.6. First, different ways to 
categorise mobile services are described.  
2.2
Categorisation of mobile services 
Mobile information services are a merger of Internet and mobile telecom-
munication. Unlike the use of the mobile phone for communication services 
like making calls and sending SMS, mobile information services are not 
widespread in the market.  
There are many ways to categorise mobile information services. Mobile 
services can be classified by their basic function: information, communica-
tion, transaction and entertainment. All these basic functions might make 
use of the possibility to position the user. The subset of mobile information 
services that makes use of the positioning of the user is called location-
based mobile services; often abbreviated as LBS (location based services). In 
subsection 2.2.1 we will further discuss characteristics of location-based ser-
vices. First, we present three other approaches to categorise mobile services, 
in each category location-based and non location-based mobile services can 
be found. Examples are provided in subsection 2.2.2. 
Applications 
A very general mobile application is mobile commerce. Mobile commerce is 
the term for the extension of electronic commerce from wired to wireless 
computers and telecommunications, and from fixed locations to anytime, 
anywhere and anyone (Keen & Mackintosh, 2001). Turban et al. (2004) de-
fine mobile commerce as any e-commerce done in a wireless environment, 
especially via the Internet. Mobile commerce can also be viewed as mobile 
services with a transaction function; customers buy something from a third 
party using a mobile device and mobile telecommunication as a channel. By 
transaction services we mean services that facilitate the payment between 
third parties and customers for e.g. wireless shopping or mobile ticketing. 

 
 
2 Service concept 
 
 
 
31
Varshney and Vetter (2001) label ‘value-added services in mobile com-
merce’ as applications and classify them as follows: mobile financial applica-
tion, mobile advertising, mobile inventory management, proactive service 
management, product locating and shopping, wireless re-engineering, mo-
bile auction or reverse auction, mobile entertainment services, mobile office, 
mobile distance education, wireless data centre and mobile music. You can 
use mobile services anyplace, anytime, real time and with positioning you 
can determine your own location, and use the location of other persons or 
objects. The technology to enable localisation is available and develops con-
tinuously. Barnes (2003b) categorises location-based mobile applications in 
four key areas: Safety, Navigation or Tracking, Transactions, and Informa-
tion. Giaglis et al. (2003) provide a taxonomy of location-based mobile ap-
plications in which they distinguish the use for: Emergency, Navigation, 
Information, Advertising, Tracking, and Billing. Different applications pose 
different requirements for the accuracy of the location information and 
speed of the network. Other requirements are also affected by the type of 
application; trust in terms of privacy and security will be very different when 
designing a service for ‘mobile shopping’ or for ‘mobile music’. 
There is also a distinction between wireless and mobile applications. Kala-
kota and Robinson (2002) state that wireless commonly means mobile and 
online. This means that there is a real-time live Internet connection via sat-
ellite, cellular or radio transmitters. Mobile and offline means that the device 
runs self-contained programs but is not connected to the Internet, for ex-
ample a synchronised PDA. Sabat (2002) uses a matrix to categorise emerg-
ing solutions by the access mode (fixed or mobile) and the mode of 
connection (wired or wireless) of the device with the content source in the 
wired world. Broadband wireless access is an example of wireless-fixed; and 
the mobile Internet is an example of wireless-mobile. This distinction is im-
portant because it affects the way services are designed and used.   
Service model  
Services might be pushed or pulled. Services in the ‘pull category’ enable 
users to ‘pull’ information wherever and whenever required, such as travel 
directions, taxi hailing, mobile yellow pages and m-commerce. Services in 
the ‘push category’ utilise the position of the mobile device to determine 
whether the user meets the criteria of a potential customer or service recipi-
ent. An example is a mobile advertisement based on personal characteristics 
of the user, e.g. his or her location. An ‘in between’ service model is a model 
where the user first subscribes him/herself for a service and allows the ser-

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
32
vice provider to use his/her characteristics to push specific information. 
Privacy is an important issue for push services. 
Market segment 
Services might be targeted at the consumer market, business market, or 
public sector. Employees can be separately regarded or as part of the busi-
ness market. Market segments can be directed to consumers (b2c, e2c, g2c 
or c2c) and to businesses including employees and the public sector (b2b, 
b2g, g2b or b2e)1. Consumers might also be categorised by how they adopt 
services. Users might be divided by their adoption behaviour of technolo-
gies as described in Rogers’ Bell-curve in which the market is split up into 
innovators, early adopters, early majority, late adopters and laggards 
(Rogers, 2003). Another way of looking at segments is the demographic 
method, looking at age, sex, income, area, etcetera.  
2.2.1
Location based services (LBS) 
Making a distinction between location-based services and non-location 
based services is another way of categorizing mobile services. However, po-
sitioning is an inherent feature of mobile services that offers many opportu-
nities for value proposition to customers. It is expected that in the future 
the distinction between mobile services and location-based mobile services 
will vanish when this feature will be optimally exploited. Location based 
mobile services are attractive to both consumers and businesses alike and 
offer safety, convenience and productivity (Turban et al., 2004). If a third 
party wants to offer services to the end-user, an ability to locate this cus-
tomer may help the supplier to deliver services that are customised to his 
needs in a specific spatial context. The European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute (ETSI, 2001) describes location based services as a net-
work-provided enabling technology consisting of standardised service capa-
bilities enabling the provision of local applications. This term ‘location 
based services’ is used alternately with the term ‘location-based mobile ser-
vices’ (LBMS). The latter term indicates the type of service more precisely. 
LBMS can also be interpreted as any service in a given location, e.g. deliver-
ing groceries to the home, enabled by a fixed infrastructure or by digital 
traffic information. We define location-based mobile services as services 
based on the mobile telecommunication network, accessible by the mobile 
1 in the x2y acronyms, b stands for business, c for consumer or citizen, e for employee, 
and g for government.

device of an end-user, and making use of the automatically determined loca-
tion of the mobile station. A more practical shorter definition is: location-
based mobile services are services that exploit information about where a 
device (mobile user) is located. 
According to a white paper by Gravitate, Inc. in Koeppel (2000), differ-
ent generations of location-based mobile services can be distinguished. The 
first generation of services relies on the user to provide the location infor-
mation manually – e.g. as a street address or postal code – to applications, 
and the application returns maps and routing information. The next genera-
tion of services has some built-in positioning ability that is sufficient to pro-
vide routing or proximity information, for example, to find the nearest 
restaurant or petrol station. The third generation of location-based services 
has greater position awareness and thus can also deliver services in the push 
service category, such as notification of events or traffic alerts. A fourth 
generation of location-based mobile services consists of location-aware ap-
plications based on infrastructures, technologies and techniques that enable 
context aware information to be seamlessly offered to the end-customer.  
Localisation should be an integral part of context aware services. The 
development of context aware services is in its early days and there are 
many technology related and customer behavioural issues that need to be 
further explored. In the long term, location-based mobile services are likely 
to be integrated to offer customised, localised content wherever and when-
ever necessary and applicable.  
2.2.2
Examples
Examples of mobile services in which the environment of the user is impor-
tant, are given in Table 2-2 (based on various literature sources). The ser-
vices in Table 2-2 are categorised in two ways. The heading row indicates 
the market segment and the first column indicates the type of application.

Bundling of services focussed on the wants and needs of an individual 
offers added value for this individual. The integration of services around 
both business and personal use drives real economic value in mobile com-
merce (Malhotra & Segars, 2005). Nevertheless, some services will be tar-
geted on the consumer market and some on the business market.  
2.3
Mobile information services and their value 
The value of a service is mostly measured by the specific benefits for the 
context in which the service is delivered: “Is the service useful?” It is diffi-
cult to establish uniquely whether a service is useful to a customer, as we 
can find various drivers like saving time, easier execution of processes, im-
proved quality, working more quickly, better job performance, increased 
productivity, and higher effectiveness (Davis, 1989). These drivers consti-
tute the value proposition of the service.  
The value of mobile services has been considered in recent research pro-
jects and publications on mobile services. The value of mobile services 
arises from the freedom that they offer. Nah et al. (2005) referring to 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
36
(Keeney, 1999) define the value propositions of mobile applications as the 
net value of the benefits and costs associated with the adoption and adapta-
tion of mobile applications. The value mobile services offer is directly re-
lated to the characteristics of the mobile application(s) that provide access 
to the service. These applications are the interface to the service. Clarke 
(2001) mentions that the functionality of mobile services is based on the 
new value areas of ubiquity, localisation and convenience. 
Baldi and Thaung (2002) mention as distinctive characteristics of mobile 
services ubiquity, accessibility, reachability, localisation and personalisation. 
Anckar and D’Incau (2002) identify the following five different settings in 
which mobile services can create value: time-critical arrangements; sponta-
neous decisions and needs; entertainment needs; efficiency ambitions; and 
mobile situations. In these settings people might adopt mobile information 
services. The adoption of new technology further depends on factors such 
as perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use and other behavioural beliefs 
and normative beliefs. This is further explained in section 2.5 
For mobile services it holds that the value they might offer depends on 
the context of the user. The different settings described above are part of 
this context. For example, is the user a tourist who visits an unknown city? 
Is the user a victim in a crisis situation, such as a car crash where the driver 
has no idea of his or her exact location or is he/she a parent whose daugh-
ter is missing at Disneyworld, or an elderly citizen living alone who suddenly 
faints? Context should be the starting point in the service design process 
and the requirements resulting from the context analysis have to be 
matched with the capabilities of the available technological components 
(Blom, Chipchase, & Lehikoinen, 2005; Tamminen, Oulasvirta, Toiskallio, 
& Kankainen, 2004).  
A mobile information service can only be context aware if there is 
enough relevant content. In this regard, however, it is also important to 
manage the expectations of the customer. The Mobile Internet is not the 
Mobile Internet. The richness of the content on Internet is just not available 
on the mobile phone. Of course, it is not desirable that the complete con-
tent of the Internet is available on the mobile device. People on the move do 
not want to read large documents on a mobile device. The mobile feature 
means that rich content should be available that is adapted to the context of 
the user.

2.4
Processes determining the added value 
A service system is aimed at providing added value for its users. This added 
value is realised when users can use the service system, and really do use the 
service system. Figure 2-2 shows three different processes that can be dis-
tinguished in the design of a service system and which influence the added 
value for the user.  
At the right hand side of Figure 1-2 the user process is depicted. This proc-
ess is central in the design of a user-centred service system. The service sys-
tem designer has to be aware of the context in which the user uses the 
system. What logical steps from the user’s standpoint of view can be distin-
guished for using the service? Are there different situations in which the 
user might want to use the service? Is the user process with the service sys-
tem usually carried out under time pressure? If so, how can the system help 
maximally to make it easier for the user to reach the required state quickly? 
Many services fail because the way the service is offered does not match the 
way the user wants to use the service. An example could be a sequence of 
steps in the service delivery which is not logical to the user. When designing 
a good service, the following aspects need to be analysed or designed: the 
roles of the users, the contexts in which the users use the service, the rela-
tion with other users on whom the service delivery might be depending, and 
the sequence of user activities that the service system needs to support. 
When deploying a service in an existing situation, users might already have a 
preferred way of working that is not easily mapped on the service system. In 
that case, activities of users might have to be redesigned in order to create a 
successful service. 
The second process is the interaction process, which links the user processes 
and the business processes by the use of a (mobile) device. This interaction 
process has to be carefully designed as well, because the linkage of the user 
and business process is not easy, especially when taking into account differ-
ent preferences from different users in different contexts. When using a 
hand-held device, the requirements for the interaction process are even 
Figure 2-2.  Processes

more difficult, because the device has a small screen and a small keyboard, 
or even just a numerical keyboard in the case of a mobile phone. The aspect 
of ease of use of usability of a service is therefore one of the most important 
success or failure factors in service systems design. 
In the business process the service delivery is prepared for the user. This 
process consists of reacting to user requests, gathering the right data, and 
preparing the presentation to the user. In the background, several services 
can interact, for instance when some of the data has to be gathered from an 
external source. In the application, invisible for the user, the user’s prefer-
ences, and information on characteristics of the communication device are 
stored, so the service can be delivered in a personalised way that fits the de-
vice used. These processes have to be designed in such a way that the re-
sponse times are acceptable for the user, and that the service does not stop 
working completely when links to external services or external data sources 
are temporarily unavailable. The business processes have to be designed in 
such a way that the service delivery satisfies a well-defined service level. A 
service for emergency workers will of course have a much higher minimum 
service level than a tourist information service. 
When designing service systems for b2b situations, the business proc-
esses and the user processes are tightly linked. This makes it even more dif-
ficult to design the operational processes within a business. Take for 
example an insurance expert who visits customers to sell new insurance 
products or to change current insurance policies. The mobile services to 
support these processes have to match both the personal style of the sales-
person, and the rigid structure of the information systems of the insurance 
company. Moreover, the salesperson is part of the insurance information 
systems, and in the design of these systems, the sales process and policy 
maintenance processes have to be taken into account. As a result new pro-
cedures might have to be implemented. When the system is extended with 
mobile services to work with insurance policies at the customer’s location, 
this might not match with the approval procedures in the company. In the 
old situation, an approval procedure was followed that could take several 
days, whereas the salesperson now wants approval within 30 seconds. 
Clearly, the business processes and the design of the new service are not yet 
aligned to deliver the service according to the wishes of the salesperson. 
(Zeithaml et al., 2006) explain the difference of managing service quality by 
a gap model. They distinguish the following five gaps between the: (1) cus-
tomer’s expected service and marketer’s perception of customer expecta-
tions; (2) marketer’s perception of customer expectations and the translation 
of these perceptions into service quality specs; (3) translation of these per-

39
ceptions into service quality specs and actual service delivery; (4) service 
delivery and external communication to customers and (5) the customer’s 
perceived service and expected service. Before we look further into service 
quality we first explore the concept of service acceptance.   
2.5
Service Acceptance 
The consumer to a greater or lesser extent, participates in the service pro-
duction process. Via the user interface, the user interacts with the provider 
and in that manner he/she ‘consumes’ the service. The user interface con-
sists of all components that allow the user to interact with the service sys-
tem; this may include a mobile phone, a PDA, an office PC, or something 
else. In this book however, we focus on mobile services: What does the 
process of ‘consuming’ the service look like in this context? And what as-
pects are relevant in designing this process?  
Figure 2-3. System acceptability (based on Nielsen, 1993)  
To formulate an answer to these questions we will use the insights of 
system acceptance models. These models provide an overview of the issues 
that influence the acceptability of a system. The first model we want to dis-
cuss here is the model presented by Nielsen (1993), see Figure 2-3. Accord-
ing to Nielsen system acceptability is a combination of social acceptability 
and practical acceptability. The social context of the user is also relevant; 
social aspects also influence the adoption and manner of using the service. 
In the model of Nielsen this aspect is depicted with the concept of social 
acceptability. A close analysis of the context in which the activity takes place 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
40
is needed to understand why this activity is performed in a certain way and 
how tools can be adapted or designed to support it. This can be shown by 
an example: imagine you want to develop a mobile device that can be used 
in the ambulance to contact a specialist at the hospital. This device may be 
very useful in a case where a patient is injured in such a way that advice 
from this specialist supports a more adequate treatment. In this example it is 
not useful to focus only on the nurse in the ambulance. His main activity, 
treating the patient outside the hospital, contributes to the main outcome of 
providing the patient with medical care. Other people of the community 
contribute to this main goal as well. Implementation of the mobile device 
has a high impact on the division of labour and rules applied in this com-
munity (Example based on Van den Anker, 2002).  
Practical acceptability is a result of the combination of characteristics of 
the system, i.e. usefulness, cost, compatibility, reliability, and other factors. 
Where usefulness is related to how suitable a system is in achieving a certain 
goal. This concept is a combination of the utility and the usability of a sys-
tem. Utility describes whether appropriate functionality is at hand and usabil-
ity is defined as the extent to which a product can be used by specified users 
to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a 
specified context of use. In this last definition effectiveness refers to whether 
users can reach stated goals and efficiency relates to the resources needed to 
reach these goals. Nielsen further defines a usable system as a system that 
meets the criteria of learnability, efficiency, memorability, few errors, and 
satisfaction. These criteria are discussed in more detail in section 2.6.2. 
A slightly different approach is presented by Davis (1989; 1993). He de-
scribes that users are likely to use a system when the system is perceived as 
useful and perceived as easy to use (see Figure 2-4). In his model Perceived 
Usefulness (PU) is defined as “the degree to which a person believes that using a 
particular system would enhance his or her job performance” and Perceived Ease of 
Use (PEOU) as “the degree to which the person believes that using a particular system 
would be free of effort” (Davis, 1989, p. 320). This effort consists of physical 
effort, mental effort, and ease of learning the system. The two concepts 
Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use both influence the decision 
of (intended) users to use technological tools. In addition to his model 
Davis presents a questionnaire that can be used to measure the concepts in 
the model. This questionnaire enabled the application of the TAM model in 
several studies. Although the TAM model originally focuses on the adop-
tion of technology in organisational settings, from these studies it appeared 
to be applicable in other settings as well.

Figure 2-4. The Technology Acceptance Model (based on Davis, 1993)  
Compared to the model presented by Nielsen (1993) the TAM model is 
more generic. However, Perceived Usefulness in the TAM model is compa-
rable with the utility concept in the model of Nielsen. And, the concept of 
Perceived Ease of Use can be related to the usability concept in the model 
of Nielsen. The TAM model further refers to external variables that influ-
ence this attitude towards using the system, whereas Nielsen specifies some 
of these external factors. We will use the model of Nielsen as it appears to 
provide more handles in understanding the use of systems.   
How can the concepts presented by Nielsen (1993) be applied to service 
systems? From his overview we learn that if a service (system) is considered 
useful, it is more likely to be accepted and used. By translating the concept 
of usefulness we assume that a user should consider the service as having 
utility and being usable. In other words, the user is likely to consider a ser-
vice useful when it fits its needs and tasks and when the service is easy to 
use. The two concepts of usability and utility are highly interrelated. How-
ever: a user interface that is usable may contribute to a service being per-
ceived as having the utility to provide appropriate functionality. Vice versa, 
if a service (theoretically) has the utility to provide appropriate functionality, 
but it can only be ‘consumed’ via a badly designed user interface, a user may 
avoid using the service. The user might not be able to see through this inter-
face and as a result evaluate the service as not useful. Or, he/she may not 
want to put effort into overcoming the difficulties of the interface.  
Trade-off perceived usefulness and switching costs 
Briggs et al. (2001) translate perceived usefulness into perceived-magnitude-
of-net-value and the perceived-frequency-of-net-value. The perceived-
magnitude-of-net-value, refers to “an attitude, a balanced subjective assess-
ment of the probable consequences of changing from existing technology to 
the proposed technology. Upon being exposed to the technology, prospec-
tive users will synthesise a holistic sense of how their lives will be different if 
they change to the new technology.” The second concept, the perceived-
frequency-of-net-value, refers to the frequency users expect to derive the 
net-value they perceive. These concepts together influence the likeliness 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
42
users will adopt a new system. As a third concept they introduce the moder-
ating variable of perceived-net-value-of-transaction. This concept presents 
the value derived from the transition activity self; it represents the balance 
estimated by the user, between switching-costs and switching-benefits. This 
value is not only relevant as a mediator in case of replacing technologies, but 
also in case of newly introduced technologies. In the context of service sys-
tems: is the service attractive although it requires some time learning to use 
it?
Trade-off perceived added value and “real” added value 
There can be a major difference between the perception of the user about 
the added value and the “real” added value that can be established with, for 
instance, an economic model. Especially in b2c, g2c, and c2c services, the 
users will select the service on the basis of the perceived added value, and if 
that is judged to be low, users will not start using the service, even if the real 
added value is high. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the per-
ception of the users, through a good service concept and a well-defined user 
interface, and to the ‘fit’ between the activities of the user and the sequence 
of activities as offered by the service system. 
Pressure to use a service 
In the success of mobile services the pressure to use a service is another 
important factor. For some processes, use may be forced. It is not possible 
to neglect a service that is part of an organisational process that one has to 
contribute to.  
Another type of pressure that may be experienced by potential users of a 
service is social pressure: the pressure of other users using a specific service. 
If someone feels they are the only one not using the application, and he or 
she wants to fit into the group, they might feel as though they should also 
start to use the application. The adoption of a service may be partly deter-
mined by the social pressure of colleagues for example. 
Critical mass  
Of course, the success and usage of mobile services also depends on the 
number of users. Adoption likelihood is sensitive to critical mass and antici-
pation of future network size (Briggs et al., 2001; Shapiro & Varian, 1999). 
The aspect of critical mass may influence the success of a service in two 
ways: the first we will refer to as economical sustainability and the second 
service content sustainability. The first principal, economical sustainability 
refers to the need of developing a profitable service. Profitability is a pre-
requisite for suppliers of information or other necessary contributions, to 

 
 
2 Service concept 
 
 
 
43
continue to invest in the service. This implies, for example, keeping the in-
formation up-to-date. A mobile navigation support application looses its 
usefulness if no new updates of the map information are released.  
The second principal, service content sustainability, stresses the rele-
vance of critical mass in the case of a mobile service supports interaction 
between two (or more) parties. Fax and telephone are good examples of this 
aspect of critical mass. A fax is only useful if someone else has a fax too. 
And, the more people own a fax, the more useful your fax becomes. A 
‘friend finder’ service only makes sense if enough ‘friends’ are also using the 
service.
2.6
Service Quality 
The service process quality cannot be measured as objectively as the ele-
ments of technical quality because the customers’ presence affects the deliv-
ery process. Quality regarding the production process is widely defined as 
meeting customers’ expectations. The best known service quality dimen-
sions are proposed, and improved in later versions, in the SERVQUAL 
model of Parasuraman et al. (Parasuraman, Berry, & Zeithaml, 1991; 
Parasuraman, Zeithaml, & Berry, 1985 1988 ): i.e. tangibility, responsive-
ness, reliability, assurance and empathy. Liljander et al. (2002) published 
quality dimensions of ‘pure’ e-services based on the dimensions of the 
SERVQUAL model. We describe them here more specifically for mobile 
information services.  
x
Reliability: currency and accuracy of product information, correct techni-
cal functioning of e-services, explanation of purpose and accuracy of 
execution of service promises. This is very relevant for mobile services 
considering the fact that users are on the move and might be in time-
critical situations.  
x
Responsiveness: providing prompt service, help available, directly provid-
ing the information the customer wants to address his/her inquiry; both 
the dependency on the network and potential time-critical situations en-
force this requirement. 
x
User interface design: overall design, ease of navigation, finding needed 
functionality without difficulty, overall ease of use and aesthetics. The 
small screen of mobile devices poses special requirements on the user 
interface.
x
Trust: feeling of confidence and trust regarding privacy and security 
when using e-services.  

Designing Mobile Service Systems

Customisation and personalisation: presenting the information in a flexible, 
adequate and tailored format. This can be done both by and for the cus-
tomer. We define personalisation as a certain type of customisation and 
therefore as a category within customisation. For instance, mobile users 
personalise the screen, tunes and navigation menu of their mobile 
phone. Mobile services can usually be customised to avoid the need to 
enter personal preferences with every use of the system. 
2.6.1
Reliability and Responsiveness 
The infrastructure and the environment of the user influence the reliability 
and responsiveness during the usage of the service (Van de Kar, Wang, & 
Muniafu, 2006). To derive reliability, the service system should be con-
nected with different communications and data networks that ensure high 
availability of services. The services need to be decoupled from the infra-
structure, to handle failure issues and provide ubiquitous access to services. 
Furthermore, before engineers start to assemble service components, the 
separate components have to be proved to be reliable. The required robust-
ness of the service also depends on the context of usage. The required ro-
bustness is less for a tourist who requires information than for a policeman 
in a crisis situation.   
The service should handle the changing use of the services in the chang-
ing contexts of the user. The context study is important for this. Also 
changing infrastructure circumstances require that the service system should 
be flexible enough to handle changing user needs such as during periods of 
limited bandwidth, loss of signal, etc. and ensure that the service can still be 
delivered even at diminishing levels. 
2.6.2
User Interface Design 
The interaction processes refer to the way the user interacts with the service. 
Relevant aspects of this process concern the available devices to interact 
with the service, the operation of these devices, and the presentation of in-
formation on these devices. As most services are used via mobile devices, 
the limitations of these devices affect the overall performance of the inter-
face. The device has to be small and easy to transport for example and as a 
result screen size is limited: the portability versus usability trade-off of mo-
bile devices. To meet new prerequisites and requirements in design for these 
types of devices a number of new interaction techniques have evolved. 
Consequently they offer a number of interaction channels for input and 
output (Johansson, Lind, & Sandblad, 2005). As shown in section 2.5, Niel-

 
 
2 Service concept 
 
 
 
45
sen (1993) defines five aspects that contribute to a user friendly or usable 
user interface. These will be discussed below.
Ease of learning 
The system should be easy to learn so that the user can rapidly start getting 
some work done with the system. There is, for example, a big difference 
between user interfaces that are intuitive to use, because the interface is 
tuned to the terminology of the user, and user interfaces that are ‘generic’ 
and for which the user always has to make a translation between the terms 
of the user interface and his or her own terminology. 
Efficiency of use 
The system should be efficient to use, so that once the user has learned to 
use the system, a high level of productivity is possible. Examples of meas-
ures that can increase the efficiency of use are: storage of previous deci-
sions, automatic filling of fields for the user, and following a workflow that 
is close to the user’s workflow. Ease of learning and efficiency of use can be 
conflicting. In order to make a service system easy to learn, extra help can 
be given to the user, which an advanced user might resent because it delays 
efficient use of the system. Some systems offer the possibility to choose be-
tween a ‘novice’ mode and an ‘expert’ mode, where the latter mode is much 
faster as it omits all kinds of explanatory information and in-between steps. 
Memorability 
The system should be easy to remember, so that the casual user is able to 
return to the system after some period of not having used it, without having 
to learn everything all over again. Memorability is different from ease of 
learning in the sense that there is a difference between first-time use, and 
using the system again after a while.  
Errors
The system should have a low error rate, so that users make few errors dur-
ing the use of the system, and so that if they do make errors they can easily 
recover from them. Furthermore, catastrophic errors must not occur. (See 
also Lewis & Norman, 1986 on errors and error prevention). Rolling back 
to a previous state of the system (the undo function in many programmes) 
should always be possible. When an action cannot be undone, a user should 
be warned about it. 
Satisfaction 
The system should be pleasant to use, so that users are subjectively satisfied 
when using it; they like it.  

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
46
2.6.3
Trust  
People only want to use services if they trust what the effect of the service 
will be. Trust is a subjective matter, it is about feeling confident. Trust is a 
much researched item in the context of the Internet. It is closely related to 
security. “Security has to be one of the design criteria pervasive in system 
and service engineering. The way security is included has strong implications 
for functionality, efficiency and costs. The trustworthiness of the service 
depends on adequate provisions of security throughout in the chain. The 
converging sectors of the industry (including areas like internet and IT, info-
tainment, mobile communications, consumer electronics, etc.) carry a dif-
ferent history on security perspective and technical solutions. Therefore, 
security should integrate and evolve the existing security technologies 
through open standards in order to meet the requirements of the future ad-
vanced service products. The great challenge for the future security frame-
work is to maintain simplicity and efficiency without leading to heavy 
implementation solutions. Ultimately, it is the user experience that drives 
the adoption of new services. The level of offered security should adapt the 
service needs in terms of user authentication, information encryption, pri-
vacy, anonymity, identity management, and content delivery. Security de-
manding applications like m-payments, m-health, content distribution, user 
profile management, are expected to drive the evolution towards a future 
security framework” (Tafazolli et al., 2005). 
Security issues also have implications for the relevant regulatory and leg-
islation framework. E.g. copyrights; anti SPAM regulations; privacy regula-
tions; etceteras.  
Privacy and security can be considered as opposite values. Sometimes 
people take less privacy for granted to gain more security. They know for 
instance that their position might be known by authorities, but by allowing 
this they can always be found in case of accidents or attacks. Privacy is also 
an issue related to push advertisement services.  
In section 2.2 it is mentioned that one way to categorise services is by 
their service model. This service model might be pull or push or an in-
between method. These methods are also called delivery methods. The de-
livery of pull based services is triggered by the user him/herself who 
searches for information based on his/her location. Thus, the location in-
formation of the user is used for the service. For push based services the 
delivery of the service is triggered by a third party and not by the user 
him/herself. For these services privacy is an issue. Privacy sensitivity is con-
text dependent and changes according to the intensity of media reaction and 

 
 
2 Service concept 
 
 
 
47
focus on specific “cases”. Customers should have the option to not share 
their context information, and they should not be damaged or harmed by 
their context or location information becoming known.  
Dealing with privacy is possible on a so-called opt-in or opt-out basis. 
The first means that the user first gives permission to use his/her data. Opt-
out means that the user’s data are used until the user writes a letter with a 
request to delete his/her data from the mailing list.  
There is both governmental regulation and self-regulation within the in-
dustry dealing with anti SPAM regulation and privacy regulation. Anti 
SPAM regulation might be applicable for pushing advertisements without 
an active request from the end-user. Camponovo and Cerutti (2004) have 
researched the anti SPAM regulations in several countries and concluded 
that within the European Union an opt-in principal is obliged by the regula-
tions. An example of self-regulation is the code of conduct that is intro-
duced for location based services in the UK. This code of conduct describes 
rules for child location services, friend locations services and mobile gaming 
services that use localisation (http://www.spiked-online.com/pdf/ Loca-
tionServicesCodeofPractice.pdf) 
Safety is also important in a completely different sense: the safety that 
the usage of mobile services offers. For people driving by car (or bike!) in 
the dark it is a real necessity to have a mobile phone with them in case the 
car breaks down or they are harassed. Having a mobile phone might make 
the difference between staying at home and going out.  
2.6.4
Customisation and personalisation 
In order to make service systems successful, services have to be customised 
and personalised. Lots of unnecessary interactions with the user, such as 
browsing long lists within applications, can be avoided when the device 
knows where the user is, and what the most likely services are that the user 
would want at that location and that point in time. When context aware 
technologies have learning capabilities, context aware services can quickly 
adapt to specific user needs, again decreasing the amount of interactions 
needed. Imagine a business traveller who is in a meeting that takes much 
longer than originally planned. When the interdependencies between the 
used services are known, business services can immediately deduce that sev-
eral bookings need to be cancelled, shifted, or changed when one of the 
services (for instance a plane booking) is changed. When the business proc-
esses also recognise the preferences of the user, a new chain of potential 
bookings can be created, and the traveller can be provided with one or two 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
48
suggestions for new itineraries, probably within a few seconds or minutes. 
Although the implementation of location awareness and personalisation 
seems easy, it is extremely difficult. The context of a user consists of an 
unlimited number of variables, and the ‘right’ variables need to be identified 
that determine the success of the deployment of mobile services in practice. 
Even ‘location’ has many dimensions: when someone is in a business meet-
ing, ‘location’ could be the address of the meeting location, its GPS loca-
tion, the building in which the meeting takes place, the room in which the 
meeting takes place, or the business meeting itself. Depending on the ser-
vice, each of these contexts might contain valuable information for the ser-
vice.
2.7
Pricing 
There are also conditions for use of the service that are not directly related 
to the quality, value or perceived value of the service. People make a trade-
off when they decide on how they are going to spend their money.  
Various kinds of revenue models exist for Internet services and many of 
them can also be applied to mobile information services. The usage of the 
terminology revenue model and business model is sometimes not clearly 
distinguished. In our view the revenue model concerns the way the financial 
transactions are arranged and the business model is a broader concept. 
Rappa 
(http://digitalenterprise.org/models/models.html) 
provides 
an 
overview of what he calls business models and revenue models can be di-
rectly derived from these Possible revenue models to create income by of-
fering mobile information services are the following. 
Advertising; The web advertising model is an extension of the traditional me-
dia broadcast model. The website publisher provides content (usually, but 
not necessarily, for free) and services (like email) mixed with advertising 
messages in the form of banner ads. The advertising model works best 
when the volume of viewer traffic is large or highly specialised. Advertise-
ment on the mobile internet is even more difficult than on the internet due 
to the small screens. Clicking to links via a pay-for-performance model is 
more opportune. This is the so-called affiliate model  which, in contrast to a 
generalised portal, seeks to drive a high volume of traffic to one site. It does 
this by offering financial incentives (in the form of a percentage of revenue) 
to affiliated partner sites. The affiliate model is inherently well-suited to the 
internet and the mobile internet. 
Subscription; Users are charged a periodic – daily, monthly or annual – fee to 
subscribe to a service. It is not uncommon for sites to combine free content 

 
 
2 Service concept 
 
 
 
49
with “premium” (i.e., subscriber-only or member-only) content. Subscrip-
tion fees are incurred irrespective of actual usage rates. There are, for exam-
ple, many mobile services on portals (e.g. i-mode portal) on which one 
might take a subscription, like the news, sport news, weather, and traffic 
information. Subscription and advertising models are frequently combined. 
Utility; The utility or “on-demand” model is based on metering usage, or a 
“pay as you go” approach. Unlike subscriber services, metered services are 
based on actual usage rates. Traditionally, metering has been used for essen-
tial services (e.g., electricity water, long-distance telephone services). For 
mobile services the amount of data transferred is often charged by the ac-
tual usage.
Merchant; this is the revenue model for wholesalers and retailers of goods 
and services on the Internet. Sales may be made based on list prices or 
through auction. It is e.g. possible to buy a ringtone from a ringtone mer-
chant.  If this ringtone is bought directly from the content creator it is the 
manufacturer or “direct model”, 
Community; The viability of the community model is based on user loyalty. 
Users have a high investment in both time and emotion. Revenue can be 
based on the sale of ancillary products and services or voluntary contribu-
tions; or revenue may be tied to contextual advertising and subscriptions for 
premium services. The Internet is inherently suited to community business 
models and today this is one of the more fertile areas of development, as 
seen in rise of social networking. Mobile phones facilitate communities 
since people can access the community anytime anyplace. Even the combi-
nation of a real-life community and virtual community can be achieved by 
mobile services.  
The revenue models offered by service providers dictate how the cus-
tomers pay for the services. Pricing is a reflection of user value. Pricing is 
not only about ‘how much’ it costs; it is also about the price structure. Price 
levels for mobile services are always debatable and will be decided in the 
market. The pricing model (structure) should be part of the design process. 
Decisions have to be made regarding paying per minute or per data package 
and paying per subscription or per use. The option to pay per minute or 
data is also dependent on the chosen technology. The call to provide price 
transparency for customers has not yet been met.

Design example: Buddy on Demand service 
This design example has been developed for the travel support domain. The ser-
vice system in the design example is aimed at foreign truck drivers who drive to 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
50
and from the port of Rotterdam, and offers a mobile community to them. The 
truck drivers might be interested in meeting their fellow countrymen during their 
breaks in restaurants. The service sets up meetings between friendly truck drivers, 
while taking their preferences and driving schedule into account. The design ex-
ample focuses on the service concept of the service system, and visualises the 
user interaction with the system by a storyline and a storyboard.  
2.8.1
Storyline 
Imagine a user of the service, called Jurek. Jurek is a Polish truck driver, who 
drives between the port of Rotterdam and his home country. Before Jurek can 
use the service, he has to create his personal profile on the website of the ser-
vice. He can reach the website over the fixed broadband Internet or by using his 
mobile handset. His profile consists of his personal data and a list of his contacts. 
Jurek can add truck drivers that he knows to the list at any time. Jurek can be 
added to the contact list of other drivers after he has registered for the service.  
Now that Jurek has added his profile, he would like to use the service for his 
ride to Rotterdam this week. He leaves on Monday morning and is due to arrive 
in Rotterdam on Wednesday at 20.00. Jurek has entered this data on the web-
site, so the service system knows his schedule. The data can be edited during the 
ride by Jurek, for example, if the time that he is expected to arrive at the port 
changes. He can do this while on the road, by using his mobile device.
When leaving Poland on Monday morning, Jurek switches on his mobile de-
vice. The mobile device determines the location of Jurek every few minutes by 
using the GPS device in the truck. The software on the handset also detects when 
Jurek is taking a break. When it appears that he has not had a break for e.g. 
two hours, the device will start to transmit coordinates to the service system. Of 
course, this time interval can be altered by the driver. Jurek can also register 
himself that he wants to have a break, after which the sending of coordinates to 
the service system is triggered. 
At 18.00, Jurek has been driving for three hours without stopping, so the 
handset is transmitting coordinates to the service system. His friend Roman is 
driving fifteen kilometres ahead on the same road as Jurek. Roman is also sub-
scribed to the service, and is a member of Jurek’s buddy list. Roman also has not 
had a break for some time.  
At this point, the system makes a match between Roman, Jurek and a place 
where they can rest next to the road. Then, it sends a meeting proposal to the 
handsets of both drivers, and asks whether they would like to meet each other in 
a restaurant twenty kilometres ahead. If Roman and Jurek both accept this pro-
posal, they will meet in this restaurant.

Storyboard 
The storyboard in this section will show how the user interacts with the service 
system.
Step 1: Before the truck driver can use the service he has to register. In order 
to do so, he visits the website of the service provider by using a personal com-
puter or a handset that is connected to the Internet. On the website the user fills 
in a form.
Figure 2-5: Storyboard of the “Buddy on demand” service: Registering on the website 
Step 2: Before the driver starts his journey, he has to edit his personal profile. 
The driver has to insert his driving schedule, such as the destination and esti-
mated time of arrival. He can do this by using his personal computer or his mo-
bile device.

Step 3: During the ride, the service system will come up with personalised 
meeting proposals. When both drivers accept the proposal the meeting can take 
place. In this step, voice recognition is used to ensure a safe use of the service.

This design example has been developed for the information and entertainment 
domain. The service system in the design example is aimed visitors of a concert 
and offers wristband with information and transaction possibilities. The design 
example focuses on the service concept of the service system, and explains the 
service by a storyboard and a storyline.

Storyline 
The storyline that belongs to the numbered storyboard items above can be found 
here.
1. Imagine that with the purchase for a ticket of a concert, you received a wrist-
band with an integrated Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip. If you 
log-in online, you can log into a system where you can raise the credit of 
your account to spend during the concert. Arriving at the event, you could 
just walk through a gate where you move your wristband past a sensor, 
where the system recognises the SWIFTband and lets you through. Security 
does not need to check your ticket for authenticity. After passing security, 
other visitors to the concert will have to get in line again for the token dis-
penser. Since you already raised your credit online at home, you can just 
walk straight to the bar to get your drinks. To encourage people to raise their 
credit in advance a special combo with beers and chips has been offered. 
The usage of the service is fairly simple. The most difficult part is the online 
registration. Our target group consists of mostly young adults who are famil-
iar with internet portals. In addition, the service system can be used without 
using this registration because the SWIFTband functions as a ticket and is 
also distributed through the current channels. 
2. As RFID chips are difficult to copy, time consuming scanning of tickets for 
authenticity as happens today will not be necessary. 
3. The wardrobe is a normal selling point with a product called “wardrobe” 
against a price that can be zero or a small amount. Numbered tickets aren’t 
necessary because the number can be assigned to the visitor ID. This requires 
extra functionality from the transaction application. 
4. When a customer orders some drinks, the bartender enters the order on a 
touch screen, which should be clearly visible for the customer. When the cus-
tomer agrees with the order on the screen he moves his wristband along the 
scanner and the screen indicates that the bill has been paid. At the same time 
the bartender puts the drinks on the counter and the customer takes his 
drinks. This means the bartender has to enter the order instead of taking, 
counting and putting away the tokens. He has to reach for the counter only 
once and he will never have to wait for customers to reach for their tokens. 
Customers can even enter their order themselves if the touch screen is placed 
at their side of the counter. This saves the bartender even more time. 
5. Because the RFID chips are small and robust they can be easily incorporated 
into a festival type of wristband. If the wristband gets lost it can be blocked in 
order to prevent others paying with it. The credits can be transferred to a new 
RFID tagged wristband.

6. To reduce the queue at the token registry at the start of the event, people can 
raise their credit by transferring money to a SWIFTband bank account quot-
ing their visitor ID. Using these IDs, visitors can create an account and log in 
to the SWIFTband web server. There they can check whether their credits 
have been raised. After the event they can get the statistics of how much they 
have ordered where and when. 
2.10 Conclusions 
The service concept is the mirror of what the user demands. In this chapter 
we looked into mobile information services: what are these; how can they 
be characterised; how to provide value and increase the chance that users 
will accept those services. The acceptances also depend on the context of 
the user. New technology should enable easy-to-use mobile services accord-
ing to the context of a user, but designing these services is not an easy task. 
The contextual nature of mobile service needs makes it hard to reveal user 
requirements. Another factor that makes it difficult to sketch service con-
cepts is the lack of knowledge as to which value propositions will be re-
warded by which customers. Surveys of user requirements for mobile 
services too often support optimism in that users are favourable to a service 
or feature in abstract but it often appears that it does not fit into their situ-
ational needs in practice. Therefore the context of the user should be taken 
as the starting point in the development of new services. We shall elaborate 
on this in the design method chapters 5 and 6.

Technical architecture 
Organizations previous operating separately need to cooperate to offer ser-
vices to their customers. Often no single organization or department can 
provide all the required elements and even within one organization the de-
partments involved will have very different architectures. Each organization 
provides one or more of the building blocks to create the mobile service. 
Consequently, many organizations need to cooperate in a inter-
organisational network and each organization is involved in providing the 
service. The creation of such a network is complicated as all organizations 
have different and heterogeneous types of systems that cannot be easily 
connected to each other. Moreover, collaboration puts high requirements 
on the technical systems. The systems should be scalable, robust and reli-
able, as the performance is dependent on the weakest element and adaptive 
to be able to change to changing circumstance. 
In this chapter we will provide an overview of the foundations of the 
technical architecture. This chapter is structured as follows. In the next sec-
tion we will discuss the playing field and evolution towards today’s situation. 
This will explain why we are confronted with the current technical architec-
ture. In the section thereafter we discuss the use of service-oriented archi-
tectures for the design of service systems, and the use of layered 
components to construct service systems. After that, we go in more details 
by discussing 3-tier architectures. Next we discuss network infrastructures 
and finally we present potential future developments.  
3.1
The playing field 
Services provided to users consist often of a composition of services which 
are provided by different organizations over a network infrastructure. The 
network infrastructure provides the facilities enabling communication and 
can include basic services as authentication of users and billing services for 
the use of the network. Fortunately, the network infrastructures is often 
standardized and shared among parties, which enables connectivity. New 
end-user services can be created using a pool of existing and new services 
operated over the network infrastructure.  
Figure 3-1 schematically depicts the use of services provided by different 
organizations. Each organization can provide a number of services and the 
user is presented a composite. In this view organizations become service 
providers and the user is a service requester. Between and even within one 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
58
organization there might be services that rely on or make use of functions 
and information provided by services provided by external or internal ser-
vice providers. So one department might act in their role as service provider 
to the user and at the same time be a service requester by making use of 
other services. This creates a complex pallet of dependencies and relation-
ships.
Figure 3-1. The creation of a user service by composing services from various organiza-
tions in an inter-organisational network 
New services are more and more created in real-time for one unique 
customer dependent on the user actions and needs. In this way services are 
produced and consumed simultaneously. The composite service is often 
created by invoking a number of services provided by the organizations act-
ing as service providers. In this respect, composite services are a series of soft-
ware invocations using a predefined request resulting in a predefined 
response. A service can be a composite, made up of a number of other ser-
vices provided by one or more service providers. Each service in the com-
posite service might be a composite service in itself Services can be 
executed in parallel, at the same time, or sequentially, i.e. one after each 
other. Furthermore, the answer to a service invocation can be immediate or 
delayed. In this sense the term services is often used to describe a variety of 
electronic interactions ranging from basic services, such as the delivery of 
news, traffic information, games, processing a payment and the take out of 
an insurance policy, to more complex services, such as the delivery of con-
text-aware, personalized services.  
How did we end up with this mess? 
In the early days of computing, data was often processed on centralised 
mainframes. Processes and data existed within homogenous environments 

 
 
3 Technical architecture 
 
 
 
59
and there was hardly any communication between systems. Software ven-
dors had their own, non-standardised platforms and with the development 
of technology, all kinds of new platforms were created. Over time, smaller 
and more opens platforms, such as Unix and MS-Windows platforms, 
which could run all kinds of applications, challenged traditional mainframes. 
Nowadays, millions of personal computers can be found on millions of 
desktops within organisations and often no two computers are exactly alike. 
Application development also changes by adopting object-oriented and 
component-oriented development paradigms. In addition, the Internet be-
came the preferred vehicle for communications and the number of network 
connections has been growing with an exponential speed.  
In the rush to adopt these new systems, most companies applied mini-
mal architectural foresight for the selection of platforms and application. 
Many of the IT decisions were based on the perception of the current tech-
nology market. The installation of these systems has been a textbook exam-
ple of “management-by-magazine” (Linthicum, 2000). Rather than making 
business-driven decisions or using structured decision-making techniques, 
the decisions were often technology-driven. The decision-making process 
lacked the perspective of integrating systems as part of the architecture of 
the already installed base. The situation was even worsened as IT-decisions 
were made more and more at the lower levels within the organisation hier-
archy. Each department was free to select its own technology and applica-
tions. As a result, within (and between) organisation(s) many stovepiped 
applications were created that addressed and solved problems within de-
partments. The systems were built without giving considerations to the re-
quirements for information sharing. As a result, there were often no 
application programming interfaces (API), open architectures, standard data 
formats and standard terms and definitions. The data stored in various sys-
tems might be overlapping, e.g. name and address information in multiple 
systems, stored in different data-formats, e.g. “Marijn Janssen”, “M. 
Janssen”, “MFW Janssen”, “M.F.W.H.A. Janssen”, and using different for-
mats for storage, e.g. text, binary formats, XML, and so on. Moreover the 
quality of the data might be different and data was often not up-to-date. For 
example, changes in address information are often not communicated to all 
parts of the organisation that have systems storing address information. 
Even within one company address information within systems might not be 
up-to-date. The end result is a chaotic environment consisting of heteroge-
neous software, hardware and other systems. These systems are often ad-
dressed as legacy system, to show that these systems are based on outdated 
technology, which can often not easily be accessed. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
60
The technical architecture for new services need to be integrated with 
the legacy systems found in various departments and organisations to enable 
the reuse of data and functionality. The systems architecture has to deal 
with a heterogeneous information systems landscape and cannot be based 
on a greenfield approach. Therefore, when designing new service systems, it 
is very important to analyze already existing systems and to see if and how 
an interface to these systems can be made and what the cost of that inter-
face will be. 
With the rise of mobile technologies, various types of devices appeared, 
running different operating systems, and having various screen sizes. The 
constraints like limited user interface, small form factor, low processing 
power and low bandwidth might limit the services that have to be devel-
oped for these devices. To enable presentation and connection to all types 
of systems, a certain degree of standardisation is necessary. Furthermore, 
the installed base of handsets already in the market may hamper the use of 
services that require the newest technology. 
3.2
Service-oriented architectures 
Traditionally, the emphasis has been on developing systems for use within 
one organisation or department without considering the need for inter-
operable systems and processes. This has resulted in a huge interoperability 
problem as all organisations have their own heterogeneous types of systems. 
With the arrival of the service-oriented architecture paradigm and the stan-
dardization of web services protocols, the technological threshold for creat-
ing interoperable systems has been lowered. Software systems are viewed as 
providing services to service requesters, which could be other systems or users. 
Other systems can remotely request information or invoke some kind of 
functionality from the service. As such, software systems act as service provid-
ers and can be considered as consisting of a set of services. Organisations 
can describe and publish their service descriptions in a directory, and others 
who want to make use of these services can search the directory, select the 
right services, and subsequently invoke the services. In the e-services para-
digm, the world is viewed as a collection of service providers, requesters and 
brokers (yellow pages) as shown in the figure below.

Figure 3-2. The basic idea of a service-oriented architecture 
Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) define how computing entities 
can interact in such a way that one entity can perform a unit of work on be-
half of another entity. An SOA is essentially an architecture that describes 
the communication pattern between services communicating with each 
other, with functions and with their operations (Papazoglou & Georga-
kopoulos, 2003). In the perspective of SOA, a service is a function that is 
well defined, self-contained, and does not depend on the context or state of 
other services. SOAs do not have any specific technology or a description 
language. There are, however, a number of technologies that support the so-
called web services protocol stack, which are often viewed as the de facto 
standards for SOA.  
A service-oriented architecture utilises a firm's existing assets and appli-
cations as services to integrate business processes and supporting business 
needs. A well-implemented SOA can provide adaptiveness and agility for a 
business by aligning IT infrastructure with business needs by taking advan-
tage of its existing assets and modularising and coordinating systems, com-
ponents, and other resources as services to support new and existing 
business processes. Agility concerns the use of interoperability standards to 
minimize the time and costs of deploying new applications. Adaptability is 
the ability to deal with new environmental conditions. Higher levels of 
adaptability are able to deal with more complex changes in the environment. 
The SOA paradigm facilitates the creation of modular, accessible, self-
describing, implementation-independent, interoperable and reusable com-
ponents that can be published and remotely invoked (Fremantle, Weer-
awarana, & Khalaf, 2002). Generally, a service communicates using well-
defined, standardised interfaces, independently of other components. The 
manageability increases, because large modular services are constructed 
from smaller ones. In essence, a complex problem is split up into smaller 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
62
problems, which can be solved independently. Openness and flexibility is 
created as new services can be added and removed from the architecture 
and each single component can be replaced by another component without 
affecting the others. Service-oriented, modular architectures can leverage 
investments in legacy systems running the key business-critical applications 
(Arsanjani, 2002). Modularity has several major advantages: 
1.
It increases the range of manageable complexity during development 
and deployment,  
2.
allows different parts of a large system to be worked on concurrently, 
3.
enables reuse, and 
4.
accommodates uncertainty. 
In essence there are two main strategies for developing information sys-
tems, “frameworks” and “best-of-breed” (Lee, Siau, & Hong, 2003). A best-
of-breed strategy is based on the concept of modularity. 
Frameworks are often viewed as synonymous with Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) systems, however, there are many other types of frame-
works. An ERP system is an enterprise-wide software solution designed to 
streamline the data flow between different functions in an organisation. In 
essence an ERP is a piece of multi-module application software that assists 
a business in managing the important parts of the business, including finan-
cial reporting, planning and control, purchasing, customer relationship man-
agement, and collecting management information. Often ERP packages 
contain a whole range of adapters to connect to other systems. An ERP 
provides all business functionality in one package that can be configured to 
match a business. The ERP implementation is technology push oriented, 
and an ERP system forces the business to adapt the business processes to 
the functionality offered by the software. ERP systems are often bought by 
one organization and not by a complete interorganisational network. If the 
other network members use the same ERP system, the creation of interop-
erability is relatively easy and straightforward. If not it might be cumber-
some and very difficult. 
Best-of-breed approaches focus on assembling a system from modular 
components that are ‘best’ on some aspect, e.g. cost, performance, func-
tionality etc. A system is built by integrating the individual components. The 
premise of best-of-breed is that it allows a business-oriented approach to 
map software on business processes rather than technology-driven business 
process reengineering. The current trend is to make use of service-oriented 
architecture in the design of frameworks. In this way frameworks also 

 
 
3 Technical architecture 
 
 
 
63
modular as organizations can only use those modules that match their 
needs.
In this chapter we focus on ‘best-of-breed’ applications. Often these 
modular components are connected using service-oriented architectures. In 
such a strategy managers focus on decision-making around the selection of 
the best-of-breed components. Architects are involved in this decision-
making, and should have to possibilities and impossibilities in mind of inte-
gration best-of-breed applications in to total landscape. 
3.3
Technologies for service-oriented architectures 
There are many technologies that can be used to create a service-oriented 
architecture. The most notable that is used more and more are web services 
technology. Web services provide machine-to-machine communication to 
enable interoperability between (distributed) applications. Web services pro-
vide a way for sharing information and functionality using standard proto-
cols crossing departmental and organisational borders. In this way existing 
information and functionality can be used when building new service sys-
tems. Although web services enable technological interoperability, there is 
still a need to standardise the data formats of the interfaces.  
The paradigm of web-services is often associated with modularity 
(Janssen & Wagenaar, 2003). With web-services, software functionality and 
data can be “packaged” and accessed as a web service. Wrappers and adapt-
ers often make legacy systems accessible by providing an interface based on 
standard protocols. Many different types of modules can be found, de-
scribed, discovered, and integrated using web-services technology. Service-
oriented paradigms are becoming more important in today’s design of in-
formation systems. Service-oriented business integration enables the on-
demand composition of new business processes using already existing ser-
vices possibly provided by other parties. In service-oriented applications, 
services are configured to meet a specific set of requirements at a certain 
point in time, to be executed and then disengaged. Services only ‘exist’ dur-
ing execution, and modules provide services.  
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines a web services as “a 
software system designed to support interoperable machine-to machine in-
teraction over a network” (www.w3c.org). The goal of web-services is to 
abstract business logic from implementation. In this way it should provide a 
way for communication between applications that is platform, vendor and 
application independent. In fact, web services perform encapsulated busi-
ness functions, so that there is no need to bother with implementation de-

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
64
tails. The term web-services has already been overloaded, and it could be 
stated that, 
x
Web-services  (plural) is a blanket term referring to all technologies that 
enable interoperability. 
x
Web-service  (singular) is a term referring to a collection of application 
operations accessible over a network using web-services technologies. 
Web services technology also incorporates a technology for orchestrating 
the sequence of web-service invocations into complete business processes. 
It can be used to coordinate processes residing in various heterogeneous 
environment and can be used for creating workflows (Verbraeck, Tewolde-
berhan, & Janssen, 2006). In this sense the paradigms of workflow man-
agement and service-oriented become closer together. 
Mobile Web Services (MWS) are the application of web services tech-
nology to the mobile environment. The standard web services technology 
can be directly applied to applications on mobile devices. As web services 
concern machine-to-machine interactions, the use of mobile web services 
requires that an application is running on the mobile device. The application 
on the mobile device can find web services and then invoke them. In com-
bination with the “anytime and anywhere” availability of mobile devices and 
location information, web services can be used to design new innovative 
mobile services. A service is often composed of a number of standard web 
services.
3.4
Three-tier architectures 
Mobile devices communicate with services on servers using pre-defined 
protocols. Mobile networks themselves provide additional services such as 
user location and user identification that are used by mobile applications. 
Current architectures often consist of multiple tiers aimed at creating a 
modular architecture to increase the flexibility, usability and scalability in 
comparison to traditional systems. In a three tier architecture, a middle tier 
containing the business logic is added between the client tier that provides 
the user interface to the user, and the data tier that contains the relevant 
data for the service. Figure 3-3 shows an example of a three tier architec-
ture.
Although the three-tier model suggests a relatively simple architectural 
design, the reality can be much more complex. Different servers can be in 
place in each tier. Software systems that are used to implement the func-
tionality for one tier, can also contains functions for other tiers. An example 
is a database application that contains application logic and presentation 

 
 
3 Technical architecture 
 
 
 
65
modules. Separating the functions into tiers using the available applications 
is not an easy task. 
Figure 3-3 Three-tier technical architecture overview  
Although 2-tier, 4-tier and n-tiers architectures exist, typical current ar-
chitectures use a three-tier model, as shown in Figure 3-3. Tiers are also 
called “layers”, because one can think of the presentation layer sitting on 
top of the application layer, which uses and updates the information in the 
data layer. 
x
Presentation layer: The presentation tier can either generate the data in 
the right format to be transmitted to an end-user device, for in-
stance to display information to the end-user, or generate data to 
communicate to another application, either in the end-user device, 
or on a server. For presentation in mobile devices protocols like 
WML and WMLScript are often used. WML stands for Wireless 
Mark-up Language. It is a mark-up language that like HTML has been 
based on XML. WML uses WMLScript to run simple code on the 
client. WMLScript is a light JavaScript language. In contrast to 
JavaScript, WML scripts are not embedded in the WML pages. 
x
Business logic layer: The middle tier typically includes application logic 
and business rules, and it can contain messaging and transaction 
processing technology. The application layer often contains the 
business logic for managing business processes. A so-called server of-
ten makes up the application layer. The term server is not used to 
refer to a piece of hardware, but to a software programme that runs 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
66
on a computer to execute componentised pieces of software. An 
example of an open source Web server programme that is often 
used is Apache Tomcat. 
x
Data layer: This tier stores information, which could be pictures, 
data, geographical information and so on. Technically, the data layer 
includes relational and object databases, information systems, and 
other data sources.
A key decision in a multi-tier design is how different tasks involved in 
delivering a working application to the users are distributed over multiple 
tiers.
Mobile devices tend to have a more constrained environment (less 
bandwidth, smaller screen, less power and less processing speeds) than 
desktop computers, therefore a separate suite of protocols has been devel-
oped for mobile applications. For enabling mobile devices to communicate 
with remote applications often the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) or 
i-mode protocols are used. The WAP forum has aligned its standards closely 
with the Internet and Web standards for communication protocols and 
presentation languages. A closely related architecture is the i-mode architec-
ture developed by NTT DoCoMo in Japan. Their standards are aligned even 
more closely with web technology. Both technologies have converged to-
wards a common Internet-based architecture which can be used on top of 
network communication protocols like GSM, GPRS or UMTS.  
The WAP architecture defines an end-to-end application protocol. The 
application protocol is a communication protocol embedded in each WAP 
enabled mobile device. The server side (WAP gateway) implements the 
other end of the protocol and routes the request from the web enabled mo-
bile device (the client) to a web server. A WAP 2.0 or i-mode gateway ser-
vice can connect to a GPSR/UMTS gateway support node which acts as the 
interface the between mobile network and the Internet. WAP services are 
hosted on web servers that are often connected to the data layer to obtain 
user information, product information, and other content.  
Nowadays the mobile web and the Internet are more and more inter-
woven. Mobile devices are running operating system and browser similar to 
the browser in a conventional computer. 
3.5
Designing new services 
The services and network infrastructures are decoupled and can be com-
bined to create a service composition as discussed at the beginning of this 

 
 
3 Technical architecture 
 
 
 
67
chapter. The complexity of an interorganisational network is reduced by 
decomposing them in separate, well-defined services. These services need to 
be integrated in business processes or need to be composed to provide a 
service to the end-user. 
Many organisations are involved in providing the end-user service. Often 
information needs to be collected and distributed to various organisations to 
enable a customised response. The content can be provided by making in-
ternal information available, and by linking the service system to other in-
formation sources. Rather than linking directly to external databases, it 
becomes common to link to external web services instead and in this way 
separating the interface and the implementation(s). This enables the re-
placement of one implementation by another implementation without af-
fecting the other parts. 
Services can take care of the non-availability of the data or databases, for 
instance by implementing caching mechanisms or by providing mirror ser-
vices. One can think in terms of delegation when linking a service to other 
services. These other services have a delegated responsibility for providing 
the right information with an agreed quality, and within a time period that is 
aligned with the user needs and the user processes. This requires a good 
technical architecture, preferably with standard protocols, and a good organ-
isational network with agreements between the different parties. The chal-
lenge is to link the main service and the delegated services in such a way that 
the user of the main service does not see where the main service stops and 
the delegated services start. The information has to be truly integrated, and 
often it is necessary to make a conversion of the externally acquired data to 
fit the other data that is offered in the service. 
3.5.1
Customisation and identification 
In addition to the content, the service processes have to be designed as well. 
The organisational processes determine how the service will be offered: Is 
the user in control of the sequence of activities? Or is the system in control 
and is the sequence of activities fixed by the service system? Many systems 
are a mix of these two extremes, and especially in such a semi-flexible situa-
tion, it has to be carefully determined where flexibility can be offered and 
where the system is in control. 
In order to make personalisation work, user identification is needed. This 
might be as simple as a user code / password check, or as advanced as for 
instance a biometric scan. Often a single sign-on is used to enable the 
trusted partners in the interorganisational network to exchange user identi-

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
68
ties. Organisations are offered the ability to authenticate users in order to 
grant them access to the services provided by these organisations. 
Mobile devices are close the users. To avoid that users need to enter in-
formation on the flexible parts every time, personalisation is often applied as a 
strategy. The service system stores characteristics and preferences of the 
user in a personal profile. Personalisation can be implemented and invoked 
as a web service that governs the delivery of the main service to the user. 
Settings about the interaction (colours, font size, location of sub-windows, 
etc.) can be stored, as well as settings about information presentation (e.g., 
units and language to use), and the sequence of activities (when tasks A and 
B are independent of each other but must be completed before task C 
starts, some users prefer A-B-C, and others B-A-C).  
The most advanced processing schemes for service delivery also take the 
user context into account, such as the time of day, the user’s location (so-
called location-based services or LBS), or the status of the information that 
is important for the user. An example of a status dependent service is a ser-
vice for emergency workers where the type of information delivery is very 
different in a crisis situation as compared to a non-crisis situation. During a 
crisis, less important information such as incoming e-mails or private calls 
may be suppressed, and only the information that is relevant for the crisis 
response can be allowed to pass.  
3.5.2
Integrating legacy systems 
Often the architecture has to deal with a heterogeneous information systems 
landscape. In cases where existing information systems, which could be leg-
acy systems, are present in the organisation, these systems might have to be 
adapted or replaced in order to make the service system work. Redesign of 
information systems to satisfy the needs of a service-oriented architecture is 
not easy – often the older systems have been designed with a focus on the 
data that has to be retrieved and on users who are present from 9 to 5 in the 
office. In the new setting however, the user is in control, and he/she is very 
flexible in terms of sequence of activities and times when to use the service. 
When the existing information systems cannot be replaced to make them 
more service-oriented, they have to be ‘wrapped’ to make them appear ser-
vice-oriented on the outside. The wrapper ensures that the system can be 
approached as a web service. The activities to adapt the interfaces of exist-
ing systems to make them more compatible with new architectures can be 
an expensive and time-consuming process. Not only is there a mismatch 
between the old technologies available in the existing system and the new 
technologies that the services require, often it turns out that the demands 

 
 
3 Technical architecture

that the new services pose on the system are so high that the system cannot 
function anymore to fulfil its old tasks. 
3.6
Mobile network infrastructure 
In the past decade a move from traditional circuit-switched networks to 
packet-switched programmable networks that integrate both voice and 
packaged services has taken place (Bi, Zysman, & Menkes, 2001). The de-
velopments in mobile infrastructure technology are enabling the deploy-
ment of new mobile services. The new technologies support faster 
transmission speed and therefore multimedia data can be transmitted over 
wireless networks.  
The role of security is essential in all parts of the future network architec-
ture. Security should be taken into account in the operation of the device, 
the radio access network, the core network and the service platform part, 
and in all layers including hardware, operating systems, protocol stacks and 
applications, to address the relevant constraints and security threats (virus, 
DoS, spam, etc.). The great challenge for the security frameworks is to 
maintain simplicity and efficiency without leading to heavy implementation 
solutions (Tafazolli et al., 2005). 
 Figure 3-4 Mobile network example 
 Figure 3-4 illustrates the complexity of the infrastructure of a mobile 
network. Internet services can be accessed using mobile terminals such as 
mobile phones or PDA devices through wireless connections (left-hand side 
of the figure). The backbones are run by the Network Service Providers 
(NSPs), which include the major telecommunication companies. The deliv-
ery sub-networks are provided by the local and regional Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs). The ISPs exchange data with the NSPs at the Network

Access Points (NAPs). The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 
refers to the international telephone system based on copper wires often 
carrying voice data. This is in contrast to newer telephone networks based 
on digital technologies, such as ISDN and ADSL.  
Mobile technology uses signals that are transmitted through air or space 
and incorporates a variety of technologies varying in reach, scale and com-
plexity. Current technologies improve the multimedia use of the mobile de-
vice, and nowadays all kind of devices use mobile technologies, including 
PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), cellular phones, mice, headsets, digital 
cameras, printers, laptops, etc. Standardisation is often mentioned as the key 
to technology success.  
3.6.1
Communication protocols and technologies 
Table 3-1 shows an overview of the type of technologies and services based 
on the type of network and bandwidth. The geographical scope is used for 
defining the type of network. Definitions of broadband are subject to 
change over time, as faster networks speed becomes available. Broadband 
can be defined as a permanent high-speed connection in excess of 128 kilo-
bits per second. A Personal Area Network (PAN) is a communication net-
work enabling wearable devices to communicate with each other. An 
example is a RFID chip embedded in products in a shop. A Local Area 
Network (LAN) supplies networking capability to a group of computers 
within a short range, such as within a house, office or school. A Wide Area 
Network (WAN) is a geographically dispersed telecommunications network. 
The main technologies are positioned in this table. This is a simplified view 
showing the technologies and the geographical reach of these protocols.  
People choose systems in which they look for information and commu-
nication depending on the context and circumstances. Behind their desk in 
the office they use a PC connected through a broadband connection, at the 
airport they use their laptop connected through WLAN and out in the field 
they use their mobile phone connected through a network technology like 
GSM. In all these settings they might search for the same information, for 
example they look for contact information in a directory service like the yel-
low pages.

A current development is to combine technologies with each other to of-
fer mobile access whatever the technology and access mode is. This can 
provide significant cost-saving for users. Different network providers might 
use different technologies. Moreover, when moving across borders one 
might want to switch to a different service provider. Roaming refers to the 
switching from one network provider to another network provider. This 
means that the network providers have to have some kind of agreement 
with each other, as the second provider has no direct pre-existing financial 
or service agreement with the particular subscriber. Agreements can be 
based on barters, but often all kind of e-services are used to monitor the 
network use, to process the usage information, to bill each other and to set-
tle the bill. 
Personal Area Network technologies 
Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) refers to the technology that uses 
devices attached to objects that transmit data to an RFID receiver. These 
devices can be small or large, i.e. in a small one in books or clothes or a lar-
ger one on ocean containers. RFID has advantages over bar codes. It has 
the ability to hold more data, the ability to change the stored data as proc-
essing occurs, it does not require line-of-sight to transfer data, and it is very 
effective in harsh environments where bar code labels do not work. RFID 
can improve the efficiency and quality of services. RFID opens the way to 
better care for people in their own homes; more effective management of 
transport, warehousing and supplies, and simpler systems for accessing pub-
lic transport and building.

Bluetooth is a universal radio interface enabling electronic devices to 
communicate wirelessly via short-range ad hoc radio connections (Haartsen, 
2000). Bluetooth is an open specification and has gained support from lead-
ing manufactures. It is suitable for seamless wireless short-range communi-
cations of data and voice between devices, in this way enabling equipped 
electronic devices to communicate with each other. The objective of Blue-
tooth is a dual one: ensuring a good autonomy for Bluetooth devices while 
guaranteeing an optimal use of batteries. Bluetooth makes it possible for 
two devices to communicate over a distance of 10 metres, however, dis-
tances can be increased if outlet power is used. Bluetooth device can func-
tion in IP (Internet Protocol) packet communication mode or throughput 
switching mode. 
Local Area Network technologies 
Wifi (short for "wireless fidelity") or IEEE 802.11x. provides a hotspot cov-
erage and is suitable for high-speed Internet access services for stationary 
users (http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/). Therefore, Wifi is very 
suitable for businesses and private users who want to create a Local Area 
Network (LAN). A nomadic worker or researcher travelling around the 
world has to search for hotspots to make an Internet connection. Physically, 
a wireless access point is used to connect wireless devices to existing wired 
networks. From a user perspective, there is not much difference between 
connecting through a Wifi access point or though a network cable plugged 
into the computer, except for more mobility. This provides you the oppor-
tunity to sit outside and enjoy the weather and at the same time connect to 
the Internet. 
Wide Area Network technologies 
WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) or IEEE 802.16 
is a broadband wireless access system using point-to-multipoint infrastruc-
ture 
operating 
at 
frequencies 
between 
10 
and 
66 
GHz 
(http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/16/). Next versions support latency 
applications, e.g. voice and video, and provide broadband connectivity 
without requiring a direct line of sight between the terminal and the base 
station. WiMax extends the hotspot coverage of Wifi to Metropolitan Area 
Networks (MAN). WiMax uses the same technology as Wifi, but has the 
potential to become a widely used fast communication service like GPRS 
and UMTS.
Cellular phones transmit their signals to a grid of cellular stations that are 
linked to the wire-based telephone network (Bi et al., 2001). Coverage is 

 
 
3 Technical architecture 
 
 
 
73
created by a set of overlapping cells that collectively form a cell cluster as 
shown in  Figure 3-4. Each cell uses a base station to send and receive sig-
nals to and from mobile devices operating within the geographical reach of 
each cell. The signals are communicated to a base station controller (BSC) 
that is connected to a mobile switching centre (MSC) in order to communi-
cate with the PSTN. A cellular phone operates only if cellular stations sup-
porting the various types of transmission protocols are available. If so, 
cellular phones provide full mobility.  
The first generation of cellular technology was analogue based. The sec-
ond generation is widespread nowadays and is known as Global System for 
Mobile Communication (GSM), which uses the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz 
frequencies in Europe, Asia and Australia, and the 1900 MHz frequency in 
North America and Latin America. GSM is a digital cellular technology that 
is used predominantly in Europe and Asia. GSM is the world's leading stan-
dard in digital wireless communications. General Packet Radio Service 
(GPRS) is a radio technology for GSM networks that adds packet-switching 
protocols and is often know as “generation 2.5” of mobile phone technol-
ogy.
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a third gene-
ration mobile communications technology (http://www.umtsworld.com) 
that provides wideband code division multiple access (CDMA) radio tech-
nology. The CDMA technology offers higher throughput, real-time services, 
and end-to-end quality of service (QoS), and delivers pictures, graphics, 
video communications, and other multimedia information as well as voice 
and data to mobile wireless subscribers. UMTS offers tele-services (like 
speech or SMS) and bearer services, which provide the capability for infor-
mation transfer between access points. It is possible to negotiate and rene-
gotiate the characteristics of a bearer service at session or connection 
establishment, and during an ongoing session or connection. Both connec-
tion-oriented and connectionless services are offered for Point-to-Point and 
Point-to-Multipoint communication. Both GPRS and UMTS (Universal 
Mobile Telecommunication System) are evolutions of the GSM networks.  
Less known is the use of satellites moving in geostationary orbits that 
remain above the same part of the earth. Although it is not adopted on a 
large scale in many western countries, it provides many advantages. It can 
be used in remote areas, as it does not need a wire channel and does not 
need earth-bound stations. For example ships, oil platforms, and remote 
areas make use of satellite communication. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
74
Global Positioning System (GPS) is often associated with location-based 
service system. UMTS networks can support location service features, to 
allow innovative location based services to be developed. It will be possible 
to identify and report the current location of the user's terminal in a stan-
dard format (e.g. geographical co-ordinates), and to make the information 
available to the user, mobile device, network operator, and service provider. 
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are important for location systems 
as they provide the tools to provision and administer base map data such as 
man made structures (streets, buildings), terrain (mountains, rivers), and im-
portant facilities such as gas stations. 
The network operators are in important component of the total service 
system. They provide the connectivity over their network structure and ba-
sic services such as user location and user identification that can be lever-
aged by mobile service applications.  
3.7
Future developments 
The future is hard to predict and many predictions come not true, however, 
there are a number of developments that will most likely influence the fu-
ture. We expect the mobile industry to keep playing a dominant role in the 
coming years and mobile communication to become the usual mode of op-
erations. Ubiquitous high-speed wireless networks will become available 
everywhere and mobile hardware can become part of, or even integrated in, 
everyday’s outfit. In their technology roadmap for a wireless 2010 vision, 
Mihovska et al. (2006) describe several wide and metropolitan-range tech-
nologies and networks of which they expect that they will be available by 
2010. In addition, they expect that will be an increase in the use of short-
range network technologies. These can be used for the control and monitor-
ing of system operations or daily activities. Many products will contain em-
bedded RFID chips that allow monitoring of products when they move 
through an interorganisational network. 
One of the key developments is to be able to switch seamlessly from one 
type of network to another network. For example at a railway station a con-
nection to the installed Wifi spot can be made, when travelling one of the 
cellular phone networks can be used. This provides the opportunity to select 
the lowest cost or the fastest network available. Another trend is the move 
from narrowband to wideband with a family of standard tailored to a variety 
of applications needs (Bi et al., 2001). 
The network speed likely increases and broadband likely becomes avail-
able anytime, anyplace. Mobile devices will have more colourful and easy-to-

 
 
3 Technical architecture 
 
 
 
75
use interface able to display more data. Integration of GPS technology with 
wireless networks will continue and enable more location-based applications 
and emergency services. More advanced privacy and security mechanism 
might be developed to better ensure the privacy and security of mobile us-
ers.
3.7.1
Services become part of the network infrastructure 
Many current efforts in the mobile network infrastructure field are aimed at 
creating seamless connectivity. Devices operated by users can be roaming 
throughout different service providers’ networks that may use different 
technologies without losing connectivity. In this way advantages from dif-
ferent technology can be used and it will allow universal mobility and a high 
data rate without users noticing the change in providers.  
Another tendency is to include more and more basic services as part of 
the network infrastructures. In the past the mobile network infrastructures 
were primarily the cables and the protocols to connect one location with 
another. Currently, services like authentication and billing have become part 
of the mobile network infrastructure.  
3.7.2
Convergence of web services and semantic web tech-
nology 
In the world of web services the convergence of web services and semantic 
web technology takes place resulting in Semantic Web Services (SWS). 
SWSs are often advocated as the next major generation of the Web, in 
which services and business communication become more knowledge-based 
and agent-based. In its simple version semantic web means revealing informa-
tion related to web data, with the goal of making searches on the Internet 
more precise. For example a mark-up tag on a web page could describe a 
document's content and its key links to other documents. Dynamic access 
interfaces are improved by defining the types of parameters of the inter-
face's operations more precisely. On the other hand a completely fresh look 
at the storage, representation and access of web- based information and 
knowledge resources is advocated. The champions of this viewpoint aim at 
“unlimited” meaningful and knowledgeable access to distributed informa-
tion resources in real time. The software will automatically profile users and 
assemble and harmonise diverse information. Interfaces to software systems 
and enterprises are defined using new means to describe their semantic be-
haviour in order to almost automatically compose dynamic behaviour. As 
such semantic technologies are a necessary technology for effective discov-
ery, matching and integration of web services in business processes.

Design example: Cycling tours service 
The cycling tour service provides personalised cycling routes to mobile users. 
Based on the preferences of the user, including cultural interests, preferred types 
of cycling routes, and favourite cycling heroes, the service provides a cycling 
route. During the route, the user will receive cultural information, information 
about the performance of his or her cycling heroes, nearby hotels and restau-
rants, and instructions on the route itself. This design example emphasises the 
technical architecture of the service system, and illustrates the use of use cases in 
service system design; see also Appendix A. 
3.8.1
Service concept 
To access the service, the user will need a mobile phone and a GPS. Before us-
ing the service for the first time, the user has to fill in some personal information. 
When the user requests a cycling tour, the service determines where the user is, 
using the GPS. Then, based on the preferred endpoint and the predefined infor-
mation about the user, the service determines an interesting cycling route. This 
route has to be confirmed by the user, and is then presented to him/her on the 
screen of the mobile device. During the tour, the user will also receive spoken 
directions.
During the tour, the service will use the positioning capabilities of the GPS 
chip to determine the speed of the user. The service compares this to historical 
data about the user’s cycling heroes and shows this to the user. Based on the 
interests of the user, information about cultural sites is also given during the tour 
by voice messages. When such a message comes in, the cyclist can choose to 
stop and request more information about the cultural point of interest from the 
service. During the tour, the user can also request information about nearby ho-
tels and restaurants, which will be returned on the screen of the device. The in-
teractions of the user with the service system are visualised in a use case 
diagram, see Figure 3-5. 

 
 
3 Technical architecture 
 
 
 
77
Figure 3-5. Use case diagram for ‘Cycling tours service’ design example 
We will now describe each use case in more detail. 
7. Provide personal information: the user enters his/her personal preferences 
via the mobile device. The mobile device sends these preferences to the ser-
vice system, and there the information is stored in a database.  
8. Receive cycling routes: the user requests a cycling route via the mobile de-
vice. Optionally, the user can choose to enter the preferred duration of the 
tour and the preferred end location. The mobile device then uses the GPS 
chip to determine the location of the user. The coordinates, the duration and 
end location are now sent to the service system.  
The service system uses the information that has been sent by the device and 
the information about personal preferences of the user that is stored in the data-
base to calculate possible routes. It also uses information from the Algemene 
Nederlandse Wielrijders bond (ANWB, the Dutch Touring Club) in this step. This 
organisation provides information about cycling routes in Europe. The service 
system will also use the services of a GIS provider in this step, in order to calcu-
late the routes. Once the service system has calculated the routes, they are sent 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
78
to the mobile device. The user can browse through the routes and select which 
one he/she would like to take.
9. Receive directions while cycling: while cycling, the mobile device determines 
the position of the user with the GPS chip. This positioning information is pe-
riodically sent to the service system, which uses it to send instructions on how 
to drive to the user. The service system will use the services of the GIS pro-
vider to generate the driving instructions. 
10.
Receive information about nearby hotels and restaurants while cycling:
while cycling the user requests information about nearby hotels and restau-
rants. The user requests this via the mobile phone, and the mobile phone 
sends the current coordinates to the service system. Now, the service system 
uses the coordinates, the information about the preferences of the mobile user 
and information about hotels and restaurants to give an advice. This informa-
tion about hotels and restaurants will be provided by a catering information 
provider. The service system will again use the services of the GIS provider to 
compare the location of the user to the location of the hotels and restaurants. 
Information about the selected hotels or restaurants is sent back to the mobile 
device, and the user can read the information on the screen.  
11.
Receive information about cultural sites while cycling: as in the third use 
case, the coordinates of the user’s position are periodically sent to the service 
system. The service system uses the services of the GIS provider to compare 
these coordinates to the position of cultural points of interest. When the ser-
vice system sees that the user is passing a cultural point of interest, it looks up 
the preferences of the user to determine whether the user will like it. If so, it 
sends spoken information about the cultural heritage to the mobile device. 
The mobile device now reads or displays the announcement.  
If the user becomes curious as a result of the announcement, he/she can stop 
cycling and request more information about the cultural site via the mobile 
phone. This request is then sent to the service system, which returns additional 
information. Information about cultural heritage will be retrieved from the 
ANWB. 
3.9
Design example: Finding disaster victims service 
The service in this design example is developed for the emergency domain. It is 
intended for relief workers at the site of a large disaster in a residential area. In 
this situation, it is crucial for relief workers to know where potential victims of the 
disaster are. This can become complicated if the regular GSM or UMTS networks 
go down, because they are overloaded or even destroyed. The service in this 
design example enables the relief workers to communicate via an emergency 

 
 
3 Technical architecture 
 
 
 
79
network. This network is used to inform them on how to get to the location of 
potential victims of the disaster. 
The design example description starts by briefly introducing the service con-
cept. Next, the technical architecture of the service system is discussed in more 
depth. Finally, the steps and interactions that are involved in getting the informa-
tion on the whereabouts of the victims to the relief workers are described. 
3.9.1
Service concept 
When a residential area is struck by a major disaster, the mobile networks in 
that area may become overloaded or might even be destroyed. That makes these 
existing wireless networks unusable for emergency workers. At the same time, it 
is essential that the relief workers in the area are well informed about the loca-
tion of potential victims, in order to make the rescue operation as effective as 
possible.
The service in this design example consists of two main features. The first fea-
ture is that it provides an emergency network that can be used by relief workers 
to communicate with the outside world. The second functionality is that it sends 
information to the relief workers on how to get to the victims of the disaster. 
3.9.2
Technical architecture of emergency network 
We will first discuss the technical architecture of the emergency network as such, 
see Figure 3-6. It must be possible for the relief workers to communicate with 
each other, and with the outside world. Therefore, the architecture of the emer-
gency network has to consist of two connected parts. These are the communica-
tion link to the emergency centre, and the emergency network at the scene of the 
accident. 
Many technical options are possible to establish a connection from the disas-
ter area to the calamity centre. Most options, such as GSM, GPRS and UMTS are 
on ground level and are therefore at risk of failing in the event of large disasters. 
The only communication infrastructure that is beyond reach of almost any possi-
ble disaster is the satellite network. Therefore, the calamity centre will be con-
nected to the scene of the emergency through a communication satellite. To do 
so, a mobile station, e.g. a vehicle, will be equipped with a satellite receiver and 
dispatched to the area of the emergency. 
An emergency network is also needed at the scene of the disaster. To do this, 
the mobile stations that have a satellite receiver will also be equipped with a Wifi 
access point. The relief workers who carry laptops, palmtops and Voice over IP 
phones will be able to connect to this access point. In that way, they can com-
municate with each other via the mobile station.  

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
80
When combining the satellite link and the Wifi emergency network, the relief 
workers can also communicate with the emergency centre. First they have to con-
nect to the mobile station using Wifi, and then the mobile station forwards the 
communication via the satellite link to the emergency centre.  
Figure 3-6. Technical architecture of emergency network 
3.9.3
Sequence diagram for localising potential victims 
The service system will use the emergency network to send directions to the relief 
workers on how to get to the victims of the disaster fast. Of course, the emer-
gency network could be used in many more ways, such as communication be-
tween the relief workers, or exchange of voice and video messages between the 
relief workers and the emergency centre.  
Figure 3-7 visualises the steps between the moment that the relief worker 
sends a request on where to find the victims and the moment that he/she re-
ceives the instructions where to go. First, the relief worker enters a request for the 
location of nearby victims on the mobile device. The mobile device forwards this 
request to the emergency centre, by using the emergency network. The emer-
gency network also determines the position of the relief worker. Now, the emer-
gency centre sends a request to the mobile network operators having GSMs near 
the location of the relief worker. The mobile network operators use the databases 
in their network to determine the last known location of their subscribers at the 
location of the relief worker. Then, if still possible, the mobile network operators 
perform triangulation to get a more precise indication of the current location of 
the subscribers.  
Then, the mobile network operators return the location of their subscribers 
who are near the relief worker. The emergency centre uses this information to 
generate route instructions for the relief worker on how to get to these victims

fast. The route instructions are sent to the mobile device, via the emergency net-
work, and the relief worker reads them from the screen. 
Figure 3-7 Sequence diagram of the `Mobile satellite services’ design example 
 The diagram shows that many actions have to be performed by the mobile 
network operators. This means that the success of the service system will depend 
on the level of collaboration between the operators, both from a technical and 
an organisational perspective. 
3.10 Conclusions 
Information and communication technologies have evolved enormously 
over the past decades. With the availability of high-speed communication 
networks, high-bandwidth mobile technology becomes available on the 
market for a low price. As a result, we are now able to develop service sys-
tems for anytime, anyplace usage. With the high speed in which technolo-
gies evolve, choosing the right technology is, however, not easy. 
From a design perspective, a good technical design starts with a model of 
the interactions of the user and other actors with the service system. The 
most commonly used model nowadays is the use case diagram, as was illus-
trated in the first design example in section 3.8. The next step in the design 
process of a service system is retrieving the requirements for the technical 
architecture from these use cases. To get a better understanding of the 
technical architecture of a service system, we can then make use of UML 
sequence diagrams, as was shown in the second case example in section 3.9. 
The example also stresses the importance of cooperation between organisa-
tions to make the service work. This organisational network will be the 
topic of the next chapter.

Organisational network 
The organisational network deals with the interdependencies between re-
sources in a (set of) service organisations. While many organisations con-
tinue to attempt to develop online or even mobile products and services on 
their own, increasingly the production and delivery of new services that 
meet market demands requires technological support that can no longer be 
provided by single organisations. Consequently, service concepts will be 
more focused on cross-organisational service provision through complex 
value networks. These attempts are hindered by inadequate organisational 
structures that impede the ability of agencies to tailor and deliver services. 
In this chapter we describe the creation of network organisations for mobile 
service systems, the business models, the actors/roles/member types, and 
changing relationships. 
4.1
Blurring boundaries in mobile domain 
The domain of mobile information services highlights the blurring of organ-
isational and industry boundaries in the domains of telecommunications, IT 
and media. The roles needed to develop and deliver mobile information 
services are, for example, those of the mobile operator, service provider, 
content provider, hardware and software providers and, last but not least, 
the customer. Together they constitute a value network of actors who need 
to collaborate in order to deliver mobile information services.  
These value networks differ depending on the sort of activities, which 
range from research on new radio technologies to contracting sales channels 
and everything in between. One factor creating these differences is the large 
differences in the time required to develop new network technologies and 
services. In the market it can be observed that while the innovation cycle for 
radio network technologies is approximately 10 years, for applications it is 
several years and for services only roughly 1 year. The involved actors, such 
as the operators, application developers and content providers, have to in-
vest in the technology necessary to deliver their contribution to customer 
value. On the one hand this means that the risk is spread between different 
players but on the other hand it means that the different players are de-
pendent on one another; and this is further complicated by the different 
innovation cycle periods. Furthermore, the revenue models will often not be 
established at the time investments have to be made.

These differences can be observed through actions, for example, in the 
Research and Development phase companies will collaborate in consortia 
such as OMA (http://www.openmobilealliance.org/) and work together 
with research institutes in research programmes that might be partly funded 
through innovation subsidies from government. In the service innovation 
phase companies operate in a network organisation and coordinate their 
design activities such as building prototypes and testing. In the daily busi-
ness routine during the business development phase the value network is 
structured and governance mechanisms like a revenue model control the 
value network.  
We do not expect this innovation cycle to be a linear process; rather we 
expect it to be iterative with many feedback loops.  
Another distinction is between the exploration phase in which new prac-
tices are applied and the exploitation phase in which existing practices are 
applied. It is an assumption that networks for exploration can mainly be 
found in forms of cooperation that are usually labelled as Research and De-
velopment. This cooperation takes place long before market introduction 
and members make agreements on intellectual property issues. Often, the 
‘hard’ R&D phase concerns new technology development. Also during the 
next phase when companies are collaborating on developing services the 
networks can still have a more exploratory character. We label this phase as 
Service Innovation. During this Service Innovation phase the network 
evolves from a more exploratory character into a more exploitation kind of 
network. In the phase in which the market introduction is prepared and the 
business case is built the network will be used for exploitation. We label this 
as the Business Development phase. This is illustrated in Figure 4-1.  
Figure 4-1 also illustrates the position of the service system design phase 
in the design cycle: we position this between Research and Development on 
one side and Business Development on the other side. Thus, mobile infor-
mation services are developed in a network where companies cooperate. 
First in the exploration phase in which network organisations design ser-
vices by experimenting with and learning from using disruptive technologies 
and business models. If the service is on the market the network organisa-
tions successively exploit the service, this is the exploitation phase.  
Nooteboom and Gilsing (2004) distinguish networks for exploration and 
for exploitation: exploitation entails improvements with respect to estab-
lished practice, while exploration entails the development of new practices.

During the design process of the service systems the network organisa-
tions might evolve from exploration towards exploitation orientation. This 
might happen in an evolutionary way or by starting again. In both situations, 
contracts and agreements need to be reconfirmed or renegotiated when a 
service will be exploited on the market.

Networks of organisations 
In the logistic domain the concept of supply chains is well known. This 
concept was translated as value chains for a broader use (Porter, 1985). 
Value chains are helpful in identifying value-adding activities, but the com-
plexity and radical changes in the merging telecommunication and media 
sectors are disregarded in these chains. In particular, the traditional tele-
communications value chain is increasingly being deconstructed, which is 
leading to the development of a complex and rapidly evolving value net-
work that consists of a myriad of network relationships (Li & Whalley, 
2002). So currently, the rapid change in mobile telecommunication tech-
nologies, which in turn creates opportunities for new services, is increasing 
the interdependency of firms in the mobile sector. This increasing interde-
pendency is one of the most frequently cited reasons for firms coming to-
gether to form cooperative relations (Gulati & Gargiulo, 1999). In addition 
to the resource interdependencies human resource constraints, com-
pounded by time-to-market pressures, are driving the creation of inter-
organisational networks for the provision of information services to mobile 
devices. While these networks are being formed to make innovative mobile 
services possible, they must also meet the requirements of a successful busi-
ness venture. This can be quite a challenge. Thus, at the same time as mo-
bile service networks are formed to overcome resource constraints they 
must also ensure that the overall venture is successful for the individual 
members while delivering highly valued services at the right price to the cus-
tomers.
Powell (1990) begins his discussion of the network form of organisations 
by discussing why the familiar market-hierarchy continuum does not do jus-
tice to the notion of network forms of organisation. A starting point in this 
discussion is the transaction cost economics (TCE). TCE is an interdiscipli-
nary approach to the study of economic organisation in which the transac-
tion is made the basic unit of analysis (Williamson, 1985). Transaction costs 
serve as a measure of efficiency for the evaluation and selection of various 
institutional arrangements. Powell (1990) argues that besides economic ex-
change other forms of exchange also have to be taken into account. He 
compares the market, hierarchy and network form and describes them as 
follows.
x
In market transactions the benefits to be exchanged are clearly specified, 
no trust is required, and agreements are bolstered by the power of legal 
sanction. The means of communication are prices. The degree of flexi-
bility is high, the amount of commitment is low, the climate is precision 
and/or suspicion and the actors are independent.

x
In hierarchies, communication occurs in the context of the employment 
contract. Relationships matter and previous interactions shape current 
ones, but the patterns and context of intra-organisational exchange are 
most strongly shaped by one’s position within the formal hierarchical 
structure of authority. The means of communication are routines. The 
degree of flexibility is low, the amount of commitment is medium to 
high, the climate is formal, bureaucratic, and the actors are dependent.  
x
Network forms of exchange entail indefinite, sequential transactions 
within the context of a general pattern of interaction. Sanctions are typi-
cally normative rather than legal. The means of communication are rela-
tional. The degree of flexibility is medium, the amount of commitment 
is medium to high, the climate is open-ended, mutual benefits and the 
actors are interdependent. 
Networks or network organisations have emerged as an organisational 
form to overcome the problems with hierarchies and to create greater struc-
tural effectiveness and responsiveness with trade-partners (Powell, 1990). 
These characteristics have enabled mobile carriers to use networks in order 
to access scarce new know-how and capital needed to develop mobile in-
formation services. 
One way to describe an inter-organisational network is to use the charac-
teristics of its members. If we consider a limited set of organisations, firms, 
this creates a more narrow set of network relations: the inter-firm network. 
Sydow and Windeler (1998) define an inter-firm network as an institutional 
arrangement among distinct but related profit organisations which is charac-
terised by (1) a special kind of (network) relationship, (2) a certain degree of 
reflexivity and (3) a logic of exchange that operates differently from that of 
markets and hierarchies. The network relationship is typically complex and 
reciprocal and reflexivity implies problem solutions often requiring inter-
firm coordination. The logic of exchange is one that combines cooperative 
and competitive elements, dependency and autonomy and trust and control. 
A network must also have limits that define its membership. One such 
limit is the goal of the network, with network membership being established 
by each individual firm’s contribution to the attainment of this goal (Jones, 
Hesterly, & Borgatti, 1997). Using this approach, a service network will be 
limited to those firms actively involved in the provision of the service. 
Governance mechanisms are needed to control the emerging value net-
work and its interwoven relationships between the different value chains. 
The need for governance stems from the special problems of adapting, co-
ordinating and safeguarding exchanges created by networks of ties.  It has 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
88
been proposed that network forms of governance can overcome these 
problems by using social mechanisms rather than authority, bureaucratic 
rules, standardisation, or legal recourse (Jones et al., 1997).  Given the net-
work nature of mobile communications services and the position of the 
network operator in the industry, operators will act as the triggering entity, 
gathering partners to fulfil the roles necessary for provision of the service. 
These roles are filled in accordance with the evolving business model that 
defines the revenue model and the benefits to various members. We come 
back to business models in section 4.4. 
4.3
Inter-firm service networks in the mobile industry 
Currently, the mobile industry is undergoing a significant change as the net-
work infrastructure is upgraded to next generation technologies.  Previously, 
mobile operators, such as Verizon Wireless in the U.S., Vodafone in 
Europe, and NTT DoCoMo in Japan, were the dominant service providers, 
offering voice and text messaging, and controlling the customer relation-
ship.  While text messaging (SMS) sometimes brought relationships with 
third party service providers, these relationships were typically opaque to the 
end consumer.  However, when new technologies made possible mobile 
information and entertainment services such as news and games, there was 
much speculation as to whether or not mobile operators would allow third 
party service providers access to the mobile networks and hence the mobile 
customers. Some speculated that operators would restrict access to their 
networks and create content themselves and some operators did indeed 
dabble in content generation activities. Currently, however, most operators 
have realised that a very broad range of applications and services can be de-
veloped for mobile and wireless devices, far more than they could ever cre-
ate themselves, and thus have focused most of their attention on developing 
various arrangements for managing access to their networks.  Therefore, the 
general structure of the mobile industry is evolving to one with literally 
hundreds of content and application developers offering services through 
mobile operators to consumers. Apart from the content and application 
developers and operators, such an operation requires the services of various 
intermediaries, platform developers, billing services, testing services, etc. 
The firms are arranged around the operators in elaborate network structures 

 
 
4 Organisational network 
 
 
 
89
that due to the interdependencies have been labelled by the industry as the 
‘mobile ecosystem’ (Natsuno, 2003).2
In this mobile ecosystem there exist multiple tiers of suppliers, similar to 
other industries that produce complex products. However, from the per-
spective of a mobile network operator, the inter-firm network consists 
mainly of a large number of content providers, with intermediaries that may 
fill a variety of roles in between (see Figure 1a).  This configuration is similar 
to the ego-centric network, which consists of a set of direct, dyadic ties and 
the relationships between these ties, with the firm at the centre of the net-
work (Hite & Hesterly, 2001; Powell & Smith-Doerr, 1994). We refer to this 
as the ‘primary’ service network and the business models developed by mo-
bile carriers are primarily concerned with firms in this network.   
However, if one considers the network to be all the firms involved with 
the provision of one particular service, the network looks a bit different (see 
Figure 1b).  We refer to this as the ‘secondary’ service network. We contend 
that to understand the production of value, which in our case is service-
specific, both primary and secondary networks should be considered. Fur-
thermore, to understand the full extent to which firms from different indus-
tries (media, banking, advertising) are involved in the mobile industry 
secondary networks should also be considered. 
2 The concept of the mobile industry as an ‘ecosystem’ is not accepted by all. 
Some view the dominant business strategy as a closed model characterized by the op-
erator’s vertical integration of the production and distribution process, making them at 
the same time the provider of mobile services and internet access as well as the mar-
keter of user handheld devices (e.g. Ramos et al. 2002). In either case, the operators 
maintain a dominant position in offering the services to the end-users and controlling 
the relationship with the consumer. Early use of the term ‘business ecosystem’ includes 
Moore’s (1996) book titled ‘Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age 
of Business Ecosystems’.

Figure 4-2 Inter-firm networks in the mobile industry 
An example of a value network concept in the mobile domain is the 
iMode ecosystem. Natsuno (2003) describes the iMode ecosystem as a 
model centred on subscribers and content. In the middle is DoCoMo with a 
coordinating function that mediates between the subscribers and the con-
tent (Figure 4-2a). The coordinating role of DoCoMo in the ecosystem is to 
provide the business model, the marketing, servers (billing system), network 
and clients (mobile phones). The user experience is the critical factor in this 
complex ecosystem. iMode changed the traditional two-way business rela-
tionship between the service provider and the subscriber by adding a third 
player in the form of the content (or application) provider. iMode services 
are offered through an operator-run portal and are implemented through a 
business model that aims to establish a uniform set of governance mecha-
nisms across a broad range of operator-content provider relations. An ex-
ample of services delivered by a coordinating intermediary are the services 
of SMS brokers who deliver SMS voting services (e.g. vote for your favour-
ite idol) via all available operators in a country to the public. The SMS bro-
ker intermediates between the content providers and the consumers (Figure 
4-2b).
An important aspect of value is the value of network membership to 
each of its members. One motivation to join a value network might be gen-
erating revenue. However, in the ‘MIES on the campus’ service (see chapter 
7) we found that most important motivations to participate in a value net-
work are (a) working with partners with an established reputation in an in-

 
 
4 Organisational network

novative undertaking is that it supports a firm’s image and (b) to learn and 
to achieve a competitive advantage. Partners will learn in the exploration 
phase from user tests and in the exploitation phase from market reactions.  
4.4
Business models 
While several definitions of business models exist (e.g., Afuah & Tucci, 
2001; Amit & Zott, 2001; Hedman & Kalling, 2003; Weill & Vitale, 2001), 
one of the most frequently cited definitions of a business model is “the or-
ganisation (or ‘architecture’) of product, service and information flows and 
the sources of revenues and benefits for suppliers and customers” 
(Timmers, 1998). By this definition, the production of a particular product 
or service requires a network of firms and the components of a business 
model will define potential inducements for firms to create or join a net-
work. Furthermore, the consideration of inducements for both suppliers 
and customers makes the business model concept attractive for analysing 
service networks. Thus, for IT-enabled services, examining the business 
model may provide insights into the inducements for network formation. In 
the case of the mobile telecommunications industry, technological ad-
vancements enabled the development of new services and they could not be 
produced and sold through existing networks.  In order to produce and de-
liver new data services, including mobile games and mobile information ser-
vices such as weather and stock reports, mobile network operators created 
new business models. While at first there was speculation that they would 
produce the content and applications required for the new services them-
selves, it soon became clear that service provision would require a network 
of service providers.  
Therefore, examining the business models used to develop mobile ser-
vices should provide insight into network formation. The business model 
components likely to play the greatest role in network formation are the 
revenue model and the benefits for suppliers and customers.  The more de-
tailed aspects such as the organisation of service and information flows may 
have operational and managerial implications but are less likely to influence 
formation. This proposition points to the dynamic nature of a business 
model.  While research on ‘idealised’ business models implies a static and 
well-specified plan, in practice business models provide a general framework 
and continue to evolve as the firms that produce the service come together. 
Hence, while the general concept may exist a priori, it is adjusted as the 
network forms.  

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
92
Returning to the definition, the business model consists in part of the 
revenue model, as well as supplier and customer benefits. The revenue 
model specifies the direction of revenue flows as well as how the revenues 
will be shared amongst the parties.  It is surprising that something as basic 
as the direction in which revenue must flow would need to be specified but 
in areas of technological innovation it often unclear what value a particular 
component will have.  For example, in the early days of mobile content and 
applications it was unclear whether network owners should pay content 
providers or vice versa. While overall revenue models tend to be highly 
idiosyncratic to the manner in which the service is produced and is reflected 
in the amount of specialisation and outsourcing, there are some standard 
models for the customer segment. These standard models include the sub-
scription model, the advertisement model, the infomediary model, etc. (see 
Rappa www.digitalenterprise.org/models; see also chapter 3).   
Factors influencing the revenue model include the need to recoup in-
vestments, the expected size of the customer base, as well as the number of 
firms required to provision the service.  While a vertically integrated firm 
may have a good understanding of the possibility of recouping investments 
required for a new product, in network forms of production this process 
can be difficult.  
In addition to the revenue model, a business model will also reflect the 
benefits to its members or suppliers. Research on inter-organisational net-
works has identified several benefits to member firms including acquiring 
resources, cost and risk sharing, market entry and learning, (Das & Teng, 
2000; Porter, 1991). While this list is not exhaustive it does point to benefits 
that can be achieved through the framework presented in a business model.   
The first of these, acquiring resources, has been labelled as the most oft-
cited reason for firms to form alliances. This need is explained through the 
resource-based view (RBV) literature and explains a primary motivation for 
firms to seek to join a network. Business models, by laying out a plan for 
how the product or service will be produced, identify required actors and 
their roles. This is further explored in section 4.5. 
The second supplier benefit is that of sharing risks and costs. By combining 
transaction cost economics with social network theories, Jones et al. (1997) 
proposed that firms would choose a network form of governance in re-
sponse to exchange conditions that include demand uncertainty.  The mar-
ket for mobile applications has been very uncertain and under these 
conditions it is likely that firms would want to share risks, and hence costs 
of investing in technologies and developing business processes.  These costs 

 
 
4 Organisational network 
 
 
 
93
and the extent to which they are shared are laid out to some degree in the 
business model.  
A third benefit that network membership may present is the possibility of 
market entry.  Given the nature of the telecommunications industry, in which 
network operators control access to customers through handsets as well as 
through billing relationships, market entry for content providers is greatly 
facilitated by having a relationship with a network operator.  Conversely, 
network operators who do not wish to develop their own content need to 
have relationships with a wide variety of content providers in order to at-
tract customers and successfully enter the mobile content market. 
The fourth supplier benefit to joining a network is learning. The research 
on networks and learning covers both how networks of firms learn (Powell, 
1998; Powell, Koput, & Smith-Doerr, 1996) as well as how individual firms 
learn through participation in a network (J. E. Brown & Hendry, 1998).  
Here we are focused on the firm’s expectation of learning as an inducement 
to enter the network.  While a firm’s ability to learn in the network will likely 
be dependent to a large extent on firm-specific factors, characteristics of the 
network as laid out in the business model may facilitate learning.  
In addition the revenue model and supplier benefits, the business model 
must also specify the customer benefit. From the suppliers’ perspective ‘cus-
tomer benefit’ is often labelled as ‘customer value.’  From this perspective, 
network formation occurs when firms come together to develop and pro-
vide services based on their unique contribution to the end customer value.  
This concept assumes that there is some minimum level of agreement on 
what that customer value is; otherwise products could contain features that 
conflict. This agreed-upon notion of customer value may be determined by 
firms who are in a position to determine the dominant technical paradigm 
or through a more organic mutually agreed-upon perception of user value 
(Christensen & Rosenbloom, 1995).3
3 The meaning of customer value in this context differs from those used by 
marketing and market researchers.  Here service providers must assume what it is that 
customers value and hence could be referred as ‘perceived customer value’. However, 
marketing researchers have done extensive studies on ‘perceived customer value,’ which 
refers to what consumers believe will be the value of a product before they buy it and is 
an important precursor to purchase. Therefore, to avoid confusion the term ‘perceived 
customer value’ while appropriate is not used. See chapter 3 for more information on 
perceived customer value.  

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
94
Thus, with the revenue model, supplier benefits and customer value, the 
business model should provide a framework for understanding inducements 
for service network formation. However, theoretically the business model 
does not include a well known factor in alliance formation, namely embed-
ded relational ties (Granovetter, 1985; Uzzi, 1996).While the business 
model, through its components of revenue model, supplier benefits and 
customer value, may be able to shed light on the types of firms that may 
desire to join a network, reducing the set of potential partners, the embed-
ded relational ties variable often answers the question ‘why this particular 
firm?’  Therefore, in addition to the inducements presented by the business 
model, we add the opportunity of embedded relational ties as well as con-
sider the type of formation process. 
4.5
Actors, roles and resources 
So, acquiring resources is one of the drivers for inter-organisational net-
works. People and firms need outside sources of cognition and competence 
to complement their own. Companies cooperate because they lack certain 
resources in their own company. (Nooteboom, 1999) argues that this is the 
fundamental reason why inter-firm linkages are important, especially for 
innovation. The role divisions vary, the revenue models differ and the bene-
fits or value for being part of the network differ for each involved actor. 
Table 4-2 shows a standard list of roles for actors involved in mobile infor-
mation services based on case study research in the domain of mobile in-
formation and entertainment services (Maitland, Van de Kar, Wehn de 
Montalvo, & Bouwman, 2005)

Which roles have to be fulfilled depends on the kind of mobile informa-
tion service. For example, the LBS roles are only relevant for location-based 
mobile services. This counts for both the exploration and exploitation 
phase.
In next subsection we discuss what the contribution from each role is 
and what this implies for the kind of partnership.  
4.5.1
Resources and value networks 
As the driving force behind network formation, resources are a crucial 
component of any value network and as discussed below will vary in terms 
of their fundamental characteristics, create interdependencies among net-
work members, and give rise to power structures that can be used to deline-
ate different types of partners inherent in a service network (Wehn de 
Montalvo, Van de Kar, & Maitland, 2005). Resources have been studied 
from many perspectives and the concept can be conceived very broadly to 
include almost everything in an organisational (capital, labour, infrastruc-
ture, technology, knowledge, processes, routines, capabilities) and inter-
organisational setting (relationships, etc.). Distinctions can be made between
property-based resources and knowledge-based resources, identified by Miller and 
Shamsie (1996). This can be compared with the distinction between tangible
and intangible resources (Itami & Roehl, 1987; Wernerfelt, 1984). 
Haanes and Fjeldstad (2000) identify tangible resources as concrete and 
tradable, such as factories, technology, capital, raw material, and land and 
intangible resources as difficult to transfer, such as skills, knowledge, rela-
tionships, culture, reputation, competencies. Essentially, this distinction par-
allels the two types of property-based and knowledge-based resources.  
Building on this distinction, Das and Teng (2000) have identified three 
salient characteristics of resources and arrive at a matrix of resources that illus-
trates specific kinds of resources in each category. The basis for this classifi-
cation is the reasoning that alliances need to be formed in order to obtain 
resources featuring imperfect mobility, imitability and substitutability. Im-
perfect mobility refers to the difficulty and cost of moving certain resources 
from one firm to another and obtaining them from the owner. Imperfect 
imitability and imperfect substitutability imply the difficulty of obtaining 
similar resources elsewhere. Complementing this with the external assets 
identified by Porter (1991) (reputation and relationships),  (Wehn de 
Montalvo et al., 2005) arrive at the following illustration of resources in 
Table 4-3.

The application of the resource-based view to research on strategic alli-
ances provides the link with value network research in focus here. Strategic 
alliances can be regarded as a category of inter-organisational relations and 
networks. The common premise is that it is precisely the complementarity 
of resources that necessitates the formation and evolution of both, strategic 
alliances and value networks, and that none of the actors can make all the 
necessary components available for product development or service provi-
sion. ‘The resource-based logic suggests that the competitive advantage of alliances is based 
on the effective integration of partner firms’ valuable resources.’ (Das & Teng, 2000, p. 
48). A resource-based perspective of the actors therefore provides a relevant 
basis to examine interdependence in the value network. From a resource-
based perspective, paraphrasing Das and Teng (1998) on strategic alliances, 
value networks are about combining resources that an individual firm cannot provide all 
on its own, yet are critical for the provision of a mobile service. 
4.5.2
Interdependencies 
It has long been argued that all firms are embedded in one or more net-
works in which they collaborate with others to create value and in order to 
service the markets (Granovetter, 1985). Network boundaries are not easily 
defined because mostly there is no overarching purpose for the interactions. 
As shown in section 4.3, this is different for so-called value networks where 
the boundaries of the network can be more clearly distinguished by identify-
ing the actors involved in the provision of a specific service. As opposed to 
a social network, in a value network the interaction among actors is goal-
directed (i.e. the provision of a service) and cannot be assumed to be influ-
enced merely by the individual actors’ intention to influence each other. 
Value networks imply interdependencies (which may differ in their form 
and extent) among the organisations involved in it. Gadde et al (2003) have 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
98
argued that each actor has a unique position in the network that is perceived 
differently by the different actors in the network because all have different 
relationships. The question is whether a more ‘objective assessment’ of the 
different actors’ positions within the value network on the basis of the re-
sources and their relevance or importance to value creation in a given net-
work can be made.  
‘In social systems and social interactions, interdependence exists when one 
actor, does not entirely control all of the conditions necessary for the 
achievement of an action or for obtaining the outcome desired from the ac-
tion. … Interdependence characterises the relationship between the agents 
creating an outcome, not the outcome itself.’ (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978, p. 
40)
Activities within the value network bring together different types of ac-
tors and resources and create (different) relationships of (inter)dependency. 
Theories on strategic management and resource dependence have often re-
garded interdependencies among organisations as inherently negative. Em-
phasis is therefore placed on how to manage interdependencies, on the 
implication of different coordination mechanisms (e.g. Ebers, 1999) and on 
strategies to restructure the conditions of interdependence (e.g. Mintzberg, 
1979, 1983; Nassimbeni, 1998). The interdependence between various rela-
tionships in the network implies that a certain actor’s change in behaviour 
also influences the position of other actors (Axelsson, 1987).  
Several forces are identified binding networks together (Håkansson, 
1987):
1.
functional interdependence (actors, activities and resources as a sys-
tem that is functionally related),  
2.
power structure (actor power based on activities and resources),  
3.
knowledge structure (activities’ design and resource use bound to-
gether by actors’ knowledge), and  
4.
time-related structure (network as a product of its history).  
For an analysis of the strategic position of actors within the value net-
work in terms of their contribution to value creation, the second type 
(power structure) is of greatest interest. Actor power is assumed to be based 
on the activities and resources of a particular actor. In particular, we argue, 
that actor power stems from the characteristics (degree of mobility, imitabil-
ity and substitutability) of the resources. To typify the power ‘structure’ 
among the actors in a value network, (Wehn de Montalvo et al., 2005) pro-
pose a distinction between essential, network-specific and generic resource contri-

butions to value creation, ranging from greater to lesser relevance  to value 
creation in the network and based on resource characteristics, defined as 
follows.
x
Essential resources as resources that are indispensable to the value net-
work and the service it provides. These resources cannot be replaced 
without affecting the existence of the service and they are highly immo-
bile, difficult to imitate or substitute. 
x
Network-specific resources are crucial for the service that the value net-
work provides, yet their replacement would be possible without affect-
ing the service directly. They are fairly mobile, possible to be imitated or 
substituted. 
x
Generic resources are required for the provision of the service but they 
are so general that they could be replaced fairly easily without impacting 
the service. They are reasonably mobile, imitable or substitutable.
This distinction provides a basis to define different partner types in the 
value network: structural, contributing and supporting partners (ranging from 
greater to lesser actor power depending on the kind of resources they con-
tribute), thus identifying the nature of interdependencies in a given network 
and the strategic position of actors within the network (Ballon & Hawkins, 
2003). These network partners can also be described as members of a net-
work.
4.5.3
Summary of members types 
Members in a network are actors that provide roles, see examples given in 
Table 4-2. The roles they provide consist of property-based and knowledge-
based resources. The distinction of different resource contributions pro-
vides a basis to label different member types in each value network: structural 
members provide essential resources; contributing members add network-specific 
resources; and supporting members contribute generic resources to the process 
of value creation. This allows identifying the nature of resource-based inter-
dependencies in a given network and the strategic position of actors within 
the network.  
To capture the importance or relevance of different resources to value 
creation in a given network, a distinction between essential, network-specific and 
generic resource contributions to the value network can be made and each of 
these contributions may be in the form of tangible (property-based) or in-
tangible (knowledge-based) resources. For analysis, the following matrix can 
be used to ‘map out’ the different resources in a given value network and 
their relevance or importance to it.

At this level of analysis, it will be possible to carry out a cross-case com-
parison of power structures in different value networks and identify similari-
ties and differences in the positions of the various actors. This can be done 
in retrospective when analysing network organisations that explore or ex-
ploit services. In the following examples designs of services are described 
including the needed roles to provide those services. The structural, con-
tributing and supporting member types might be foreseen however they can 
only really be distinguished when a network organisation is in place.

Design example: Last minute business travel changes 
service 
This is a design example for the travel domain. The service in this case provides 
a set of interrelated services for business travellers who have to make last-minute 
changes to their travelling schedule. The focus is on a business traveller who is 
on a business trip while something unplanned takes place, which generates con-
flicts in his schedule.  
First, the service concept of the service system is briefly introduced. Next, the 
organisational network of the service system is described in depth.  
4.6.1
Service concept 
Frequent business travellers from large corporations often find themselves in 
situations where they have to make changes to their previously planned sched-
ules. Even a small schedule change can affect previous flight, hotel and taxi 
bookings. Changes to the travelling schedule involve a lot of work. Bookings 
have to be cancelled, and new alternatives have to be generated and chosen. 
This is a complicated and iterative process because current booking services in 
the travelling industry are independent of each other, making last minute 
changes a boring and time-consuming activity. 

 
 
4 Organisational network 
 
 
 
101
Business travellers often lack the time to make the changes themselves, as they 
will often have long and intensive business meetings. The natural reaction of 
business travellers under such circumstances is to contact their own organisation 
or a travel agency. This has also disadvantages, for example when the business 
traveller is in another time zone and the resources are not available at their own 
organisation to make the changes. The business traveller will also keep worrying 
that the process of changing his schedule will not be successful.
The service in this design example will minimise the inconveniences that are 
currently encountered by business travellers. The main idea behind the service is 
that it takes care of the entire process of changing the schedule. To do so, the 
service provider bundles the booking services that currently exist in the travel 
industry. The service will use these services to make a new schedule for the busi-
ness traveller. In this process, it takes the appointments of the traveller and his 
preferences into account.  
The service serves as insurance for the business traveller that the changes will 
be made correctly. In that way, it will increase the productivity of business travel-
lers. They can now concentrate more on their business objectives, instead of be-
ing worried about their planning. We also expect that this will give business 
travellers more satisfaction in their work. 
4.6.2
Organisational Design 
Because the service combines several existing travel services, many actors will be 
needed to make the service work. Figure 4-1 provides an overview of the value 
network of the service system.
The roles, activities, responsibilities and benefits of the relevant actors are de-
scribed below. 
Business traveller
The business traveller is the customer who uses the service. The business traveller 
will benefit from the service as it makes the process of last minute travelling 
changes easier and less time consuming. The business traveller will only need to 
have interaction with the provider of the service. 
Business organisation
This is the organisation that employs the business traveller. The business organi-
sation will have interaction with the service provider, and also with the billing 
provider who will send the bill for the changes that are made. The business or-
ganisation will benefit from the service by increased productivity and efficiency 
of the business traveller.

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
102
Figure 4-3: Value Network for last minute business travel changes service 
Travel change service provider
This new organisation will provide the service to the business travellers. The or-
ganisation is responsible for the entire operation and reliability of transactions 
made regarding changes in reservations. It is also responsible for managing the 
dynamic information that is part of the profiles of customers such as the personal 
preferences and reservations of the customers. The service provider will also per-
form marketing for the service, and answer questions from customers.  
The service provider will benefit from the service by charging the business or-
ganisations for using the service.
Mobile network operators
This actor will enable communication between the business traveller and the ser-
vice provider. Business travellers will typically be on the move, and therefore 
wireless access to the service will be needed. The network operators will benefit 
from the service as they can charge the business traveller for using their net-
works.

Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) providers
A GDS is defined as following: “a computer distribution system for displaying 
available services, affecting bookings, and ticketing by tourism producers – air-
lines or otherwise – on an international scale”. There are four major GDS pro-
viders: Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan. These systems essentially 
provide travel agents with the ability to make airline ticket reservations directly 
into the airline computer reservation systems. GDSs will thus play an integrative 
role in our service by contributing to the automation of activities involving the 
rescheduling of flight reservations. The activities of the systems involve collecting, 
integrating and distributing the content from content providers to other parties 
like travel agents. Maintenance and updates of the system are also part of their 
activities.
Switch system providers
Although GDSs in the past only handled airline reservations, it soon became 
apparent that they would also have to support other travel services such as hotel 
chains and car rental agencies. Therefore, ‘switch-systems’ were designed to 
connect reservation systems to hotel chains, thereby making them available 
through GDSs. The role of these switch-systems is therefore to enable the flow of 
content from various travel services into a GDS. It is a significant component for 
our service since it is necessary to link various travel services with one another to 
enable triggers between different reservations systems. 
The GDSs and switch-systems can benefit from the fact that through the intro-
duction of the service, they can achieve wider application of their systems. Fur-
thermore, these systems that participate in delivering the service can achieve a 
better competitive position since it enhances their own system and the service 
they offered. GDSs and switch-systems generate revenues through charging the 
other actors in the value network. 
Content providers
The content providers are the airlines, hotels, taxi companies, car rental agen-
cies, train operators, long-distance bus companies etc. Their role is to constantly 
provide accurate and up to date information regarding their travel services. 
These organisations are also responsible for providing information regarding the 
profiles of customers, for instance the in-flight or hotel room preferences or the 
recent flight/hotel history of a traveller to the service provider. 
The content providers are able to benefit from the fact that they can differen-
tiate themselves from competitors who do not participate in this project. When 
the customer is provided with a list of flights or hotel rooms, the participating 
airlines and hotel chains will be considered and perhaps chosen by the cus-
tomer.

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
104
Billing provider 
The role of the billing provider is to coordinate the billing and payment of differ-
ent organisations for delivering the service. It is responsible for ensuring reliable 
and secure payment between different parties. In order to fulfil their role, billing 
providers will obtain and utilise payment services that are available on the mar-
ket.
The billing providers will benefit through the increased number of transac-
tions that take place between business organisations and other parties in the 
value network. Billing providers will probably charge per transaction that takes 
place.
4.6.3
Result 
This design example shows that many actors are involved in a service that looks 
relatively easy: making a change in a business trip schedule. This provides op-
portunities for new intermediaries who can use ICT to work efficiently. By choos-
ing for a network organisation form these new intermediaries can start their 
business in a complex organisational landscape.  
4.7
Design example: People Tracing Service 
This is a design example for the emergency domain. It focuses on victims of dis-
asters at airports. Disasters can happen on an airport, such as the collapse of a 
terminal or a plane crash. When this sort of thing happens, the family and 
friends of people who are at the airport try to find out whether their loved ones 
were involved in the disaster. Currently, there is no effective and efficient system 
to provide unambiguous and fast information about the location of victims. The 
objective of this design example is to design a service that helps people to find 
the location of a close-one who might have been involved in a disaster at Schi-
phol airport. The design of the service is based on Schiphol Amsterdam, but 
could also be a starting point for designs for other airports. In this case, we will 
first briefly  introduce the service concept of this service system, and then empha-
sise the organisational network of the service system. 
4.7.1
Service concept 
An airport is a place where many lives may be in jeopardy. It contains a lot of 
people in a small area and aeroplanes take off and, loaded with thousands of 
gallons of kerosene. Fortunately there are a lot of safety measures and protocols 
that should minimise the possibility of a disaster happening. However, disasters 
still occur from time to time.  

 
 
4 Organisational network 
 
 
 
105
During a disaster, many different teams are involved in rescue operations 
and are trying to get the situation under control. In this hectic scene people like 
family and friends at home may be trying to find out if some one they know of 
was of involved in the accident and if so, where they can find them. People who 
are at the scene of the disaster and who are not heavily injured might want to 
search and find out where lost friends or travelling-companions are. Because of 
the high working pressure on the medical teams, there is no effective and effi-
cient way to provide clear information about the location of these victims quickly.  
The People Tracking Service (PTS) will help to find persons that might be in-
volved in the disaster at Schiphol airport. It will combine information from hospi-
tals near the airport, airline companies, check-in desks and information from 
ground personnel. All information about the whereabouts of people and their 
personal information (name, gender, etc.) will be combined and presented to 
next of line. The service can be used by people who are at Schiphol airport, and 
by people at home. 
The service will provide information about which people have been taken to 
the hospital or to a save of area on TV screens or on digital billboards at the 
airport. The information will also be available from ground personnel who will 
form a so-called `PTS-team’ and who are available to give information. At the 
Information Access Centre (IAC), which is an information point for passengers, 
mobile computer terminals will be available for accessing the service.
People at home who are worried that a relative is involved in the disaster at 
the airport can access the service on a website. On the website, a user can fill in 
the name of a person and then search for him. The service will then present in-
formation about the state of the person and his location. 
4.7.2
The organisational network  
Who are the actors and which roles do they fulfil? What is the benefit for each 
of the involved actors?

Figure 4-4 Value network for people tracing service 
Hospitals
The hospitals near Schiphol airport play a vital role in achieving a high per-
formance of the PTS. The PTS service system should constantly be updated with 
data from the hospital’s databases. Especially for those people that are in a criti-
cal condition, it is important to fill in data about them in the system with high 
priority.
The big advantage for hospitals when the PTS works correctly is the major 
reduction in incoming phone-calls from worried people trying to find someone. 
They will now look at the website for information. 
Airline companies
The airline companies that arrive and depart from Schiphol airport have to enter 
the information from their passenger lists for each flight. In that way, in case of 
an accident they can be traced faster with the PTS system.  

 
 
4 Organisational network 
 
 
 
107
Information Access Centre (IAC)
The IAC will connect to the PTS website in the event of a disaster. People could 
then come to the IAC and access the service system. The IAC could also enter 
new information in the PTS system, for example when a missing person turns up 
at the information point. 
Adverting companies at Schiphol airport
In the event of a disaster, the adverting companies have to remove their adver-
tisements from the digital billboards, and instead show the information from the 
PTS system. By cooperating in this, the adverting companies show their goodwill 
for the right cause, which creates positive exposure.  
Mobile network operators
The PTS-team will access the PTS system to provide information to the people at 
the airport. To do so, they need wireless connections to the system. Preferably, 
the mobile network operators should reserve some capacity in their network for 
the PTS service in case of a disaster. 
Schiphol Airport ground handling companies
At Schiphol, a small group of companies is active in checking-in passengers at 
the front desk. When travellers check-in at the front desk, their information will 
be entered in a database. This information has to be sent to the PTS system. Ac-
tive participation of the ground personnel is not needed here. The PTS system will 
automatically send requests and retrieve information from the database itself.  
The ground personnel will have an active role in the event of a disaster hap-
pening, because they will be (maybe not all) used as member of the PTS-team. 
Users
The active participation of users should be minimised because they will obviously 
be in a state of panic, stressed, and uncertainty. Therefore the PTS website 
should be very clear and simple. The users only have to click, enter a name and 
read the results from the screen. 
4.7.3
Result 
This design example describes the Passenger Tracking Service, which enables 
victims to find their friends or relatives at the scene of a major disaster at Schi-
phol airport. The service uses information from various sources, including air-
lines, airports, hospitals and the victims and relatives themselves. The design 
example presents the organisational network that is needed for the service, in-
cluding the actors involved in providing the information, their roles and their 
relationships. In Figure 4-4 it is visualised that some actors are more structural 
than others by using dotted lines for the supporting actors.

Conclusions 
The design of mobile service systems increasingly demands resources that 
cannot be provided by one organisation. This means that the organisation 
has to cooperate with other organisations. The network organisation form 
seems more suitable for mobile services than hierarchy or market transac-
tion oriented organisation forms. These network organisations are often 
quite complex and the members of these network organisations will fulfil 
different roles which are more or less structural, contributing or supporting 
in the network.  The design process in which these networks are formed 
also has to be designed itself. In next chapter we also describe theories that 
support the ‘soft’ system design that includes actors and their (potentially) 
conflicting interests.

Design approaches for Service Systems 
In the past three chapters, the characteristic features of services and service 
systems have been discussed. The focus in these chapters was on what mo-
bile services systems are. In this section, we present approaches for design-
ing mobile service systems, thereby shifting our focus towards how to design 
services systems. Various requirements on how to design these systems have 
emerged from discussing the specific characteristics of services systems. In 
this chapter several schools of design approaches will be presented and their 
suitability for designing mobile service systems is evaluated. We will show 
how certain of these existing approaches can be adopted for the design of 
mobile service systems. Besides the usage of design approach elements from 
longer existing disciplines, more and more results from research specifically 
focussed on service innovation and mobile service development is being 
published. We refer to these recent findings, such as the New Service De-
sign (NSD) literature as mentioned in chapter 1, when appropriate. 
This book deals with services and services systems that are enabled by 
information technology. So, naturally, we should be able to find inspiration 
from systems engineering which we do in section 5.1. We further deepen 
our knowledge of specific areas of system engineering: product design (5.2), 
information system design (5.3), and collaborative business engineering 
(5.4).  Section 5.5 explores how modelling can help in service system design. 
We especially look into the possibilities of component based design and the 
use of building blocks.  
The design, implementation and use of mobile service systems involves 
many stakeholders, such as providers, operators and users who together 
form a value network. These stakeholders may have different ideas, views, 
interests, and means with regard to the services that are designed. In section 
5.6 we look into the design of services from a user’s perspective. During the 
design process with the other actors cooperating in a network, decision 
making is an inseparable part of designing, which is complex and needs to 
be managed. Process management is complementary to the more traditional 
project management techniques that are also needed in the design of mobile 
services systems. In section 5.7 process management and project manage-
ment are discussed as ways to deal with management and decision making 
issues in designing mobile service systems. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
110
Finally, the principles, aspects, elements and techniques that can be use-
ful for the design of mobile service systems are presented together in sec-
tion 5.8.
5.1
System engineering 
Considering the complexity of mobile service systems, with the many disci-
plines needed, the many interrelated systems components that need to be 
considered, and the dynamic environment in which mobile service systems 
need to be designed, a systems approach is needed. Systems’ thinking 
(Checkland, 1993; Weinberg, 1975) includes holistic thinking, i.e., under-
standing the system as a whole in time (the system as it develops through its 
life cycle from conception until disposal or recycling) and space (a whole 
separated from the environment). All the components and organisations 
involved in a service-oriented system have to work together to provide a 
mobile service that adds value to the users. Mobile service systems are large 
scale technology enabled systems. For the design of such systems multiple 
disciplines need to be deployed and multiples stakeholders need to be in-
volved. Systems’ thinking also implies understanding dynamics and feed-
back relations between all these system components and between the 
system and its environment.  
Engineering, as in systems engineering, can be defined as creating cost-
effective solutions to practical problems by applying scientific knowledge to 
building things in the service of mankind (Maier & Rechtin, 2002; Shaw & 
Garlan, 1996). Essential in many definitions of engineering is the notion of 
solving real world problems using scientific knowledge. In our view, design 
is included in engineering, as one of the phases in the systems’ life cycle. 
Sage and Armstrong (2000) present a list of important issues that must 
be dealt with to engineer large systems. These issues are (1) many considera-
tions and interrelations; (2) many different and perhaps controversial value 
judgments; (3) knowledge from several disciplines; (4) knowledge at the lev-
els of principles, practices and perspectives; (5) considerations involving 
product definition, development and deployment; (6) considerations that 
cut across three different life cycles associated with systems planning and 
marketing, RDT&E, and system acquisition or production; (7) risks and un-
certainties involving future events that are difficult to predict; (8) frag-
mented decision-making structures; (9) human and organisational needs 
perspectives and value perspectives as well as technology perspectives; and 
(10) resolution of issues at the level of institutions and values as well as the 
level of symptoms.  

 
 
5 Design approaches for Service Systems 
 
 
 
111
Each of these issues needs to be dealt with when designing mobile ser-
vice systems. Some examples will illustrate this. The mobile field is charac-
terised by uncertainties (issue 7); for mobile service systems these 
uncertainties include technology, the demand, the supply market and the 
interaction between demand and supply. This shows that mobile services 
have to embrace the perspective of the need of the customer, the customer 
value, the value for the involved business actors delivering the services and 
the technology perspective taking into account the dynamic development in 
the mobile field (issue 9). Decision-making takes place at a company level, at 
a dyad, triad and network level. This makes decision-making complex and 
potentially fragmented (issue 8). 
It is clear from the above that in the design of mobile service systems we 
need to deal with these issues. We should therefore consider systems engi-
neering approaches as a basis for a design method for (mobile) service sys-
tems, and look both at hard systems engineering and soft systems 
engineering. The hard systems approach departs from the idea that the pre-
sent state and desired future state can be fully described, and are known. 
There is a strong use of scientific methods and quantitative modelling, and 
the aim is to find the optimal design or solution for the system that is being 
studied. Important schools are operations research (Winston, 2004), Sys-
tems Engineering and Analysis (Blanchard & Fabrycky, 2006; Buede, 2000; 
Sage & Armstrong, 2000), and System Dynamics (Forrester, 1968). Hard 
systems thinking can, however, not deal very well with the ‘human element’ 
or with qualitative factors, which are so important in service systems. Soft 
systems approaches, which were developed in the late 1980s and 1990s 
(Checkland, 1993; Checkland & Holwell, 1998; Checkland & Scholes, 1990) 
take different worldviews, qualitative factors, and the human element in the 
system as a starting point. Debate and reaching agreement among the dif-
ferent stakeholders are considered to be more important than the ‘one out-
come’ of the hard systems approach.  
As humans have been designing artefacts for a long time, many different 
design methods exist from which we can learn for designing service sys-
tems. Examples are methods for product design and methods for informa-
tion systems design. Both product design and information systems design 
have their own literature fields. We briefly explore these design theories for 
products in section 5.2 and for information systems in section 5.3. Then, we 
will use a number of components from product design, information systems 
design, and hard and soft systems thinking, and describe an integrated 
method that is sometimes called ‘business systems engineering’ (Van Meel, 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
112
1994) or ‘collaborative business engineering’ (Den Hengst & De Vreede, 
2004).
5.2
Product design methodologies 
Product design is important for service design for two reasons: (1) there is a 
vast body of knowledge with respect to the design of commercially and 
technologically feasible products and (2) the clear distinction between ser-
vices and physical goods seems to be rapidly eroding. Services are more of-
ten than not supported by tangible artefacts, such as the mobile phone that 
comes with the cell phone subscription. On the other hand, tangible arte-
facts (products) gain more added values through add-on services, such as a 
24 hour helpdesk for a home computer.  
Products are technical artefacts for which product design theories exist. 
Product design is about the prescription of structure, construction and use 
of a physical entity. Generally, product design is executed without the ex-
plicit order of a client who will also be the user of the product. Commis-
sioners of the design project typically are the marketing departments of 
organisations. A typical feature of product design is therefore the uncer-
tainty with regard to the user requirements. As a result in product design 
approaches great attention should be paid to revealing the needs and wants 
of the user, as the ultimate success of the product depends upon whether 
the end consumer will buy and use it (Rouse, 1991). User wants and needs 
are translated into explicit specifications suitable for the technical designers. 
These specifications are the touchstone for the whole project that follows.  
Generating an idea for a product is part of an innovation process with 
divergent and convergent activities. Product planning is part of the strategy 
process of a company, and the realisation of the product consists of a tech-
nical development process and a commercial development process. 
(Roozenburg & Eekels, 1995, referring to Hall 1969) argue that the basic 
product design cycle within product development is quite close to a special 
implementation of the empirical cycle of the problem-solving model of sys-
tems engineering. They present several product design overviews. Their ba-
sic cycle of design is presented in Figure 5-1.  

 
 
5 Design approaches for Service Systems 
 
 
 
113
Figure 5-1 The basic cycle of design (Roozenburg & Eekels, 1995) 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
114
The basic design cycle provides valuable input for the design approach 
for mobile service systems. Additionally, (Roozenburg & Eekels, 1995), 
provide methods, rules and recommendations for each phase of the basic 
cycle. Although these are directed towards tangible products like vending 
machines and phones, some of these methods, rules and recommendations 
provide inspiration for designing services. (Buijs & Valkenburg, 1996) pre-
sent a similar kind of model for developing innovative products with the 
phases: analysis, synthesis, materialisation and optimisation. For each phase 
they present the input, activities and output with an evaluation between 
each phase.  
Roozenburg and Eekels refer to Quality Function Deployment (QFD) in 
their description of how to get from a design problem to a design specifica-
tion. QFD is a method for structured product planning and development 
that enables a development team to specify clearly the customer’s wants and 
needs, and then to evaluate each proposed product or service capability sys-
tematically in terms of its impact on meeting those needs (Cohen, 1995). 
The method is tailored to the organisational context in which the process of 
developing a specification takes place (Roozenburg & Eekels, 1995). In 
QFD the sequential approach of product development is replaced by a con-
centric, concurrent approach in which different stakeholders are involved in 
the product development process from beginning to end. The method sup-
ports a team of designers in identifying the needs of the customer and in-
terpreting them in terms of technical parameters and target values. The 
QFD process involves structuring matrices of which the first displays the 
customers’ wants and needs. This matrix is the most well-known and is 
called the ‘house of quality’. In QFD handbooks the activities are structured 
in phases: phase 0 = planning phase; phase 1 = gather the voice of the cus-
tomer; phase 2 = build the house of quality; phase 3 = analyse and interpret.

Creveling et al. (2003) present a methodology for product and technol-
ogy development which is built upon a balanced portfolio of tools and best 
practices and enables a product development team to develop the right data. 
Their methodology is based on the Six Sigma Approach created by Mo-
torola and popularised in corporate business by General Electric. In their 
view, the critical components in product development are (1) the product 
development process; (2) tools and best practices and (3) project manage-
ment. Creveling et al. present a technology development roadmap (in-
vent/innovate, develop, optimise, verify), which deals with the 
manufacturing system, and a product development roadmap (concept, de-
sign, optimise and verify). They link quality function deployment (QFD) to 
the invent/innovate phase in the technology roadmap and the concept and 
design phases to the product development roadmap.  
Product design is about the prescription of structure, construction and 
use of a physical entity. Service designers can adapt this prescription for the 
design of intangible goods: services. Like product designers, service design-
ers have to deal with the conflict between the need for creativity and uncer-
tainty reduction. One might wonder why the established product design 
methodologies are not more accepted for service design. The question ‘how 
does service design differ from product design’ is often asked. The nature of 
services demands that its design tools support the characteristics of services 
as described in Table 2-1 in chapter 2; However, some design tools can be 
used for products as well as service development. Verkuijl, Tischner and 
Tukker (2006) present an overview of product-service development tools 
and show that many of these tools can be used for products as well as ser-
vices. We agree and like to emphasize that scenario development methods 
in which the user and his/her context are taken as a starting point can be 
used for products as well as services. Especially for services since the ‘the 
act of the value is gone with the consumption’ and therefore the service de-
velopment has to start with the viewpoint of the user; the user’s experience 
of the delivered service is integral part of the service. This also counts for 
ICT enabled services which offer only value when of current interest; e.g. a 
location based service has only value if the service uses the current position 
of the user and not the position of a few hours earlier; the weather news is 
only valuable if it is up-to-date. The service to be designed is most likely 
part of a multi-channel strategy of a company. When defining a multi-
channel service mix, focus and progression in the design process benefit 
from defining the e-services first and then adding multi-channel services 
(Simons, 2006). (Simons, 2006) developed the MuCh-QFD method to de-
sign e-services in a multi-channel context based on QFD.

Next section shows what specific information system design approaches 
are useful for services.  
5.3
Design of information systems 
Alter (2002) defined information systems as “a work system whose business 
process is devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulat-
ing and displaying information, thereby supporting other work systems”. It 
is very clear that the types of mobile service systems that we have described 
in earlier chapters and in the examples at the end of each chapter are exam-
ples of information systems. Information from the users is captured with a 
mobile device, transmitted to back-end systems, stored for later use, ma-
nipulated and combined with other information, and presented again on 
mobile devices after transmission. Mobile service systems belong to a cate-
gory of information systems that are hard to design and test, because they 
are distributed (Tagg & Freyberg, 1997). The importance of communication 
and interaction with the users also need more emphasis than when design-
ing ‘classical’ information systems.  
Waterfall and spiral models 
The waterfall and the spiral model are two basic development models for 
information systems (Cadle & Yeates, 2001). The waterfall model originates 
from the seventies, while Boehm (1988) introduced the spiral model at the 
end of the eighties. The waterfall model is a stage-by-stage model, the spiral 
model combines this with an evolutionary approach. The aim of the spiral 
model is to give a structured and incremental approach to the service design 
process. The project starts at the centre of the spiral and progresses out-
wards, so problems occur during the various stages and are not all found at 
the end. In three or more rounds various quadrants activities are carried out 
until the service designers are satisfied with the results, see Figure 5-3.

Evolutionary design 
It is difficult for users to list requirements for information systems in which 
they are involved. The same applies for mobile services. Different users will 
have different requirements and requirements will change over time. This 
problem can be mitigated through the inclusion of users in the design 
phases of mobile services as in an evolutionary development model. An 
evolutionary approach is suitable in situations where the requirements are 
not well formed or understood by the users, where it is difficult to specify 
the requirements, or where it is difficult to determine how a proposed solu-
tion will perform in practice. “An evolutionary design approach consists of 
expanding increments of an operational product with the directions of evo-
lution being determined by operational experience…. the disadvantage of 
this approach is to distinguish it from the old code-and-fix model, whose 
spaghetti code and lack of planning were the initial motivation for the wa-
terfall model” (Boehm, 1988).  
Often information systems are part of service systems and therefore we 
can use some elements from the information systems engineering field. A

spiral model for (information) system development seems to fit well with 
the design of mobile service systems, as it more or less provides some struc-
ture to the evolutionary design procedure that is needed for mobile service 
systems design. Design needs to balance incremental change and radical 
thinking. It is striking that right balance asks for continuous input from dif-
ferent stakeholders during the service system design process. Therefore, the 
next section introduces a collaborative design approach that combines ele-
ments from hard systems thinking and soft systems thinking.  
5.4
Collaborative Business Engineering  
Designing mobile service systems without considering the organisational 
structures and processes, i.e., the value network and the operational proc-
esses, might result in a design that is neither effective nor efficient, given the 
existing organisational processes. The Collaborative Business Engineering 
(CBE) approach focuses on collaboration within business processes. An 
organisation cannot design mobile service systems on its own, since these 
systems are the result of coordinated design activities by different actors like 
operators, handset manufacturers and content providers. Participation of 
various experts and stakeholders with much tacit knowledge of the situation 
is needed. During the engineering process stakeholders and experts need to 
work closely together, for instance in workshops and brainstorming ses-
sions. The ‘collaborative’ part is also important for this research since mo-
bile services have to be designed in a network of actors, as discussed in 
chapter 4.   
Den Hengst and De Vreede (2004) give an account of a number of case 
studies in which a collaborative design approach has been applied. They de-
scribe these case experiences and formulate the lessons learned that should 
ultimately evolve towards what they call, Collaborative Business Engineer-
ing (CBE). CBE is a good source of inspiration for a design approach for 
mobile service systems for several reasons. 
The CBE approach aims to deal with ill-structured problems for which 
bounded rationality is seen as the dominant decision-making paradigm. The 
design approach should not focus on finding the single optimal new organ-
isational design, but on facilitating a diagnosis and design process that will 
yield a satisfying and acceptable solution (Den Hengst & De Vreede, 2004), 
which is analogous with the soft systems thinking approach described earlier 
in this chapter.  
The CBE approach is a systems engineering approach in the sense that it 
aims to establish changes in complex systems. They are problem driven in 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
120
the sense that the design, engineering or change process is initiated and mo-
tivated by problems or opportunities perceived by a group of stakeholders. 
For the design of mobile service systems opportunity driven is usually more 
appropriate since the design of mobile services is more often aimed at find-
ing new business for companies than at solving problems for the users. The 
‘opportunity’ owner wants to make a profit with new mobile services and 
has to take a customer driven or market driven approach in a market with a 
lot of uncertainties. The services will only be successful if they are useful 
and help to solve problems and meet the needs of the (potential) users.  
A purely hard systems engineering approach would not suffice in view of 
the involvement of many stakeholders, the ambiguity of design goals and 
the qualitative character of many factors relevant in the design. Design of 
mobile service systems requires a balanced mix of hard systems engineering 
to deal with the technological aspects of the design and soft, collaborative, 
participative or consensus-oriented approaches to manage the actors in the 
value network. Therefore, the CBE approach combines the hard and soft 
system thinking from system engineering. Hard system thinking is useful to 
deal with the engineering aspects: designing the network infrastructure, mo-
bile middleware and applications. A hard systems approach cannot cope 
well with situations in which goals are not specified and ambiguous, such as 
is the case in situations with many stakeholders and in situations where 
many factors cannot be quantified, such as is the case in services design. 
Soft systems thinking is more focused on learning processes and ways of 
seeking consensus among the actors within the value network (Jackson, 
1991).
The design activities for solving CBE problems are problem or opportu-
nity formulation, problem or opportunity conceptualisation, model specifi-
cation, model checking, solution finding and solution implementation (Den 
Hengst & De Vreede, 2004). The CBE approach puts a strong emphasis on 
understanding of the current situation before going into a more solution 
oriented phase. The CBE approach is therefore usually based on incre-
mental improvement, as opposed to radical change. When designing mobile 
services we think that incremental improvement alone can be dangerous 
because organisations are locked in their existing processes and may not see 
mobile service systems opportunities. Relying only on radical thinking, how-
ever, is also impossible since organisations and markets have their history 
and institutionalised habits. The CBE approach supports both radical and 
incremental change (Den Hengst & De Vreede, 2004).

Modelling and component-based development 
Modelling plays an important role in every design method for systems. 
Formal models are used to describe the system that is being developed in 
each of the design steps, and can help to store and communicate the current 
design ideas. Quantitative models such as simulation models (Shannon, 
1975; Zeigler, Praehofer, & Kim, 2000) are used to compare different de-
sign options.  
As a formal modelling paradigm object-orientation presents itself as ex-
tremely suitable for the design of service systems. It enables modelling and 
communication ideas from the early stages of the design process (use cases) 
until the implementation (interaction diagrams, etc.). In line with this, com-
ponent-based development is a promising way of designing the technical 
architecture of the mobile service systems. We refer to sections 3.2 and 3.3 
for the description of this technical architecture, like service oriented archi-
tectures.
Modelling will be described in more detail in section 5.5.1. With respect 
to conceptual modelling object oriented modelling is applied more often 
nowadays in the CBE approach, next to flow-oriented modelling techniques 
like SADT. Object-oriented modelling and component-based engineering 
potentially align very well. We further look into that in section 5.5.2, and 
elaborate on a specific form of component-based development in section 
5.5.3.
5.5.1
Model-based development  
Modelling has a prominent place in service design approaches, especially in 
an environment where customer value is key and the customer cannot en-
visage whether he or she is interested in the services. The systems in which 
new services are introduces are often complex dynamic systems. It is be-
lieved that formal and explicit modelling techniques can and should be used 
to enhance understanding of the system and facilitate communication be-
tween stakeholders and analysts.  
A distinction can be made between conceptual models, that define the 
structure of a problem situation, and empirical models, that represent a fur-
ther specification and quantification of the problem situation and facilitate 
analysis and diagnosis of the problem or possible solutions. With respect to 
empirical modelling discrete event simulation and visualisation are relevant 
modelling approaches that can also be very useful for mobile service sys-
tems design. Modelling visual interactive features graphically may be very 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
122
time consuming but it has a high added value in terms of a vehicle for 
communication and gaining insight. 
In product design, models are used to communicate functional and non-
functional characteristics to potential users or to the client, to communicate 
characteristics of interfaces and components between various design teams 
and to test the design on essential performance criteria. For these purposes 
product designers use artist’s impressions, technical drawings, scale models, 
prototypes, calculation models and simulations.  
Models are used for similar purposes in the design of mobile service sys-
tems. The usability of devices, for example, can be modelled in mock-ups or 
prototypes. In the development of WAP, an emulator of WAP pages, the 
WAP toolkit, can be used to test WAP pages on a PC. The focus, however, 
will need to be more on models that can express actions or processes in ad-
dition to structural or physical modelling. Story boards can take the place of 
the artist’s impression. 
Simulation models (Banks, 1998) can also play a role in researching sys-
tem aspects such as scalability and robustness in early design phases, which 
normally can only be tested with a large user community. Simulated users 
and simulated content take the place of the majority of the expected users, 
where some of the users can be real at the same time. This enables us to 
study the perceived effect of the system load on the other users. An exam-
ple of a project where this has been applied successfully was the testing of a 
new timeslot allocation service for trucks in the Port of Rotterdam (Boer & 
Verbraeck, 2003). A prototype service was developed by several parties, and 
tested using a simulated road system and simulated container terminals. 
Several of the trucking companies could use the prototype application, while 
their competitors were simulated. This allowed us to test the behaviour and 
response time of the system under a realistic load (Boer, 2005). 
This type of use of simulation models is very close to the concept of 
management gaming (Mayer & Veeneman, 2002), where the concept of in-
teraction with the simulation model is taken one step further. Serious 
games, as Mayer and Veeneman (2002) call them, can also be used to study 
interactions between users of the system and to train stakeholders. 
5.5.2
Component-based development  
Growing commercial pressure to achieve competitive advantage by develop-
ing systems quickly, means that component-based approaches are becoming 
increasingly popular (Cadle & Yeates, 2001). Many varieties exist for these 
approaches such as Rapid Application Development (RAD) and Dynamic 

 
 
5 Design approaches for Service Systems 
 
 
 
123
System Development Method (DSDM). The methods take into account 
management issues and design issues related to the user. Management issues 
are conditions relating to the environment, empowerment of staff and fit 
for business purpose. Important elements for a user-centred design ap-
proach are the following. 
x
Testing is seen as being an integral part of the iterative cycle. 
x
Products are delivered frequently rather than as a perfect end product. 
x
Interactive and incremental development is an integral part of the ap-
proach.
x
Users must be actively involved. 
Component-based development offers the most promising attempt to 
meet the challenges in the rapidly changing domains in that it provides the 
basis of a new set of techniques supporting the next generation of software-
intensive solutions (A. W. Brown, 2000).Components are defined as ‘an in-
dependently deliverable piece of functionality providing access to its ser-
vices through interfaces’. A component-based development approach 
consists of the following activities (A. W. Brown, 2000). 
x
‘Understand the context’, the objective of ‘understand the context’ is to 
obtain a clear statement of initial requirements. This can be done by use 
case modelling and business type modelling. 
x
‘Define the architecture’, the aim is to identify all the components that 
will be used to build the application, and to identify the dependencies 
between these components.  
x
Component architecture modelling; for example UML use case dia-
grams (see Appendix 2). The components architecture modelling of 
mobile services can be structured in layers: the telecommunication net-
work, the middleware, the applications and the presentation layer. 
x
Context modelling; the aim is here to understand how the system works 
within the context of the defined business types. 
x
Interface modelling; the aim is to obtain a set of candidate interfaces, 
and to begin to describe the details of those interfaces.   
x
‘Provision the solution’. In a pure top-down approach, the provisioning 
of the solution starts when the architecture of the system has been 
completed. In reality this is an interleaved development process in 
which architecture definition guides provisioning decisions, and provi-
sioning experiences are used to inform and refine the architecture. 
 As we can see in the approach above, modelling is the key for different 
activities of the component based development.  It is important to define 
proper modelling techniques and notations that satisfy the needs of all 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
124
stakeholders in a development process. The standard object-oriented mod-
elling language UML is the basis for most of the current component based 
development methods and approaches. The standard UML offers a number 
of extension mechanisms that enable the user to extend the UML founda-
tion with new modelling constructs according to his purposes.   
In the past few years the software industry has been characterised by 
rapid and continual change in the domains in which software is applied, and 
in the underlying technologies they target and use (A. W. Brown, 2000). The 
domain of mobile services is one of the domains in which software is ap-
plied. The idea of components is derived from software-engineering envi-
ronments (Allen, 2001; Allen & Frost, 1998; A. W. Brown, 2000; Heineman 
& Councill, 2001; Szyperski, 1998; Wallnau, Hissam, & Seacord, 2002), and 
builds upon the notion of distributed objects (Fingar, Read, & Stikeleather, 
1996; Orfali, Harkey, & Edwards, 1996). Three main reasons for using 
components are relevant for mobile services: (1) reducing delivery time, (2) 
making use of best-in-class, and (3) supporting parallel and distributed de-
velopment.   To better achieve these benefits in mobile system design, the 
use of “building blocks” will be introduced in the next section.  
5.5.3
Use of “Building Blocks” 
Often, complex service systems are built from scratch on top of different 
network protocols. In addition, the systems have to interface with a number 
of legacy systems. As a result, architectures are incompatible, there is a lack 
of integration with existing hard- and software and re-use of earlier devel-
oped parts of the system is almost impossible, which results in high invest-
ment costs. Therefore, it is expected to be more profitable to design generic 
building blocks that can be used over and over in different service systems 
in time (Verbraeck & Dahanayake, 2001). Depending on the type of build-
ing block, it can be used in different service systems, and sometimes the 
building blocks can be so generic that they can be used for completely dif-
ferent types of systems. The definition of a building block used here is 
(Verbraeck et al., 2001): 
A building block is a self-contained, interoperable, reusable and replace-
able unit, encapsulating its internal structure and providing useful services 
or functionality to its environment through precisely defined interfaces. A 
building block may be customised in order to match the specific require-
ments of the environment in which it is ‘plugged’ or used.  
An example of a building block could be a transportation service for 
goods that are bought through a website. If the transportation service is 

 
 
5 Design approaches for Service Systems 
 
 
 
125
self-contained, interoperable, reusable and replaceable, it can be classified as 
a building block. When well designed, the transportation building block 
could easily be used as a part of other services where transportation is 
needed. Other examples are building blocks for inventory management of 
the shop, for payment, and for ordering new goods. Each of the building 
blocks offer a clear service in the system, and on the system level, they hide 
their internal structure and communicate through a well-defined interface. 
An example of a component is for instance a universal connector to one of 
the databases in the shop: an essential, unique element of the solution of the 
shop that is a (software) enabler for e.g. the inventory management service 
and the ordering service. 
The relationship between a building block and a component can be 
summarised as follows: a component is the implementation of (part of) a 
building block in a software environment. The interface (functionality) of 
the building block and the component are therefore different presentations 
of the same thing. However, the building block can also be used in an or-
ganisational engineering environment. This clear relationship between a 
component and a building block – where the latter is clearly the broader 
notion – is supported by the following comments (Herzum & Sims, 2000, 
p.155).
“A business component is the software implementation of an autonomous 
business concept (entity or process). It consists of all the software artefacts 
necessary to represent, implement, and deploy a given business concept as an 
autonomous, reusable element of a larger distributed information system. 
Important characteristics of the business component concept are its strong 
concepts of software artefact ownership, of black box/white box across the 
development lifecycle, of architectural viewpoints, of distribution tiers; and 
of its use as a unit of modularisation, of deployment, of reuse, and of man-
agement.”
The underlying assumption is that a building block on its own cannot 
provide the functionality a user requires in the sense that a building block 
on its own – without domain specific context, and communicating, co-
operating or even competing with other building blocks – does not provide 
the required functionality. A search algorithm is nothing without the data to 
search; a communication protocol is nothing without the sender, message or 
receiver; and a routing algorithm is nothing without origins, destinations 
and transporting means, et cetera. A service system, on the other hand, is 
fundamentally a meaningful whole for a user. That means that a service sys-
tem is an aggregate of more than one building block, where the building 
blocks interact with each other in such a way that the functionality the user 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
126
requests is provided. An example: a user wants to retrieve information from 
a remote geodetic database. To accomplish this functionality we could de-
fine a building block for the remote communication and data interchange, a 
building block for the authentication of the user, a user-dialog so the user 
can specify his or her needs, a search function in the database and the data-
base itself, et cetera. Together these building blocks form the desired repre-
sentation.
In order to provide functionality, service systems are constructed by 
combining building blocks. More precisely, new – conceptual – building 
blocks can be formed by aggregation, which is combining lower level building 
blocks into new higher level building blocks. We embrace the object ori-
ented paradigm and we want to be able to use the building blocks repeti-
tively in our service systems or models (Booch, 1991; Jacobson, Ericsson, & 
Jacobson, 1995). Instances of building blocks will be combined to construct 
service systems or models. The instantiation means that the attributes in the 
instance of the building block get a value in order to give the building block 
the exact functionality that the user wants within that service system or 
model. Possibly, a number of attribute variables have a default value so the 
user does not have to worry about the values of all attributes of the building 
block.
Based on this the additional properties – inspired by Orfali et al. (1996)– 
of a building block can be given: 
x
It can have different levels of granularity. Building blocks can be composed of 
other building blocks and so form larger building blocks with more 
functionality. Building blocks have an extension that is dealt with in the 
former property. 
x
It fulfils a clear function. A building block is logically and physically cohe-
sive, and thus denotes a meaningful structural and/or behavioural 
chunk of a larger system. It is not just some arbitrary grouping.  
x
It has a well-specified interface. A building block can only be manipulated 
through its interface. The functionality of the building block is ad-
dressed by its interface. In that way it is exposed to the outside world. 
x
It exists in the context of a well-defined architecture. A building block represents 
a fundamental building block upon which systems can be designed and 
composed. This definition is recursive: a system at one level of abstrac-
tion may simply be a building block at a higher level of abstraction.  
x
It is nearly independent of other building blocks. It rarely stands alone. A given 
building block collaborates with other building blocks and in so doing 

 
 
5 Design approaches for Service Systems 
 
 
 
127
assumes a specific architectural context. This architectural context is 
driven in large part by the implementation we chose.  
x
It can be used in unpredictable combinations. Building blocks can be used in 
ways that were totally unanticipated by the original developer. Typically, 
building blocks can be combined with other building blocks based on 
their interfaces.  
x
It is an interoperable object. A building block can be invoked as an object 
across address spaces, networks, languages, operating systems, and 
tools.
x
It may have several states. A building block has some function, and by per-
forming the function, its state may change from state, e.g. from passive 
to active.
x
It has limited domain specificity. A building block is defined as being more 
or less generic. 
x
It is a replaceable part of a system. A building block is a substitute for any 
other building block, which realises the same interfaces. This aspect 
helps during development, where parts of a system can be stubbed, 
sketched, and then replaced by mature, robust implementations. It also 
supports the evolution of a system, once deployed by making it possible 
to upgrade and evolve parts of the system independently. 
When designing building blocks, one has to take into account three dif-
ferent perspectives. First, the perspective of the user, who is the person that 
uses the service offered by the service system. The second perspective is 
from the administrator, who is responsible for the maintenance of a service 
system.  The third perspective is of the developer of the service system. The 
perspectives are distinguished because the requirements from each perspec-
tive differ. The user is usually not interested in the technical structure of the 
service system itself. He or she is interested in the contribution of the ser-
vice system to the function, system or organisation it supports. For the user, 
the advantages of current ICT developments (Internet, Multimedia, Wireless 
connections) are important. They should be an enabler to manage more and 
more complex business systems, processes and organisations, rapidly adapt 
the way of doing business according to ever-changing demands on the mar-
ket, and/or lead to answers to questions of how to improve the productivity 
and quality of business services, using these developments. 
The following requirements are defined from a user’s perspective: 
x
Quality: the information offered should be as correct, timely, controlla-
ble, precise and complete, as the user deems necessary. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
128
x
Composition: service systems must fit together; only in exceptional cir-
cumstances they will function in a stand-alone situation. Service bun-
dling is a term used for this. 
x
Speed: the speed with which the service system performs its function 
must be adequate to carry out the user’s tasks. 
The following requirements can be defined from an administrator’s perspec-
tive:
x
Flexibility: business processes change very fast, so should their support-
ing ICT infrastructure. In order to accommodate this fast change, the 
elements should be easily adaptable.  
x
Scalability: in order to be sure that an ICT infrastructure will remain 
functional when the supported system is expanding, scalability of the in-
frastructure – i.e. expansion without relative loss of speed or of control 
– is required.   
x
Maintainability: an ICT infrastructure has to fulfil its function for a 
longer period of time. During this period the infrastructure environ-
ment in which a part of the ICT infrastructure functions is likely to 
change. This may require change of other parts as well. Besides it is eas-
ier and more effective to maintain parts of the service system than by 
handling it as a monolithic unit, where changes in one part affect the 
other parts of the system as well. 
The following requirements can be defined from a developer’s point of 
view:
x
Generality: an infrastructure must not only be applicable in case XYZ, 
but also in other cases of the type XYZ, possibly even in a case of X-
something. Tools that can only be used in a specific domain, for a spe-
cific goal, in a specific project, do not have added value within other 
domains or within other projects. On the other hand, if a solution is too 
generic, practice often shows it is useless. A reasonable number of case 
variants and some customisable parts may lead to a ‘useful-generic’ tool. 
This kind of generality of an ICT infrastructure could contribute to the 
speed of development.  
x
Reusability: in order to reduce development time of service systems, re-
usability of parts is preferred. Reusability does not mean only multi-
times usability of the whole software elements, but also of the ideas, 
methods and design choices. Reusability can be either “as-is”, technical 
oriented, take an element and plug it in without changes to other solu-
tions or “pattern based”, more conceptually oriented, from a frame-

work, which can be used to develop various specific tools for a variety 
of cases.
x
Modularity: the need for a modular structure of a service system in-
creases, especially when the complexity of service systems increases. 
That means that a service system consists of a number of highly inde-
pendent modules.  
In conclusion, the expectation is that the development of libraries of 
building blocks from which mobile service systems can be assembled will 
lead to more efficient development of mobile service systems.  In addition, 
it will allow more flexible design to adapt to the ever changing demands 
from the users and the environment. In this design process choices have to 
be made to find a balance between requirements like generality versus flexi-
bility, etcetera.  We further explore the user perspective in the next section, 
considering its importance.   
5.6
User centred design  
The service system has to support the activities of the user and has to be 
aligned with the goals and information needs of the user. Knowing the (po-
tential) users, and knowing the setting in which they will use the service, 
supports the development of a successful service. It supports the identifica-
tion of services the user might consider useful, and functionalities that need 
to be provided by these services.   
Depending on the type of user and his context the service system has to 
satisfy different requirements. These requirements are implications of the 
interaction between (1) the user, (2) his/her context, and (3) the service 
concept. The user can apply the service in only in one setting or in different 
settings; alone or as part of a community. These aspects are relevant to ad-
dress in order to formulate useful requirements and are therefore further 
discussed in more detail below.  
5.6.1
User characteristics 
In the design of a service two types of user characteristics are relevant: 
Firstly, general human factors such as cognitive, perceptual and motor ca-
pabilities and constraints of people in general are relevant. These character-
istics influence the way users observe, interpret, decide and act. Think of the 
limited cognitive capability of a user for example. Secondly, special and 
unique characteristics of the intended user population in particular need to 
be addressed. Characteristics such as their education level, knowledge, skills, 
and experience (see Mayhew, 1999). 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
130
In mobile service systems however, several types of users can be dis-
cerned. The service can be provided in private as well as organisational set-
tings: users may for example be tourists or truck drivers, as is described in 
case descriptions in this book. Some services may even be suitable for both 
types of users, e.g. a mobile service system that supports the booking of 
hotels.
It is hard to identify which users might be interested in your service. If 
you ask people whether they would be interested, they can answer this ques-
tion without committing themselves to the service. As a result they tend to 
be overly positive, and your estimation of the number of interested users is 
likely to be too high. Furthermore, it is often hard to imagine exactly what a 
service looks like when it is not yet fully ready, especially when new tech-
nology will be implemented to provide the service. As a consequence, re-
sults of test panels might not always be useful in predicting the success of a 
service.
5.6.2
Context of use 
The functionalities provided by the service (utility of the system), as well as 
the interface applied (usability) should match the context of use of the user. 
The user may for example be involved in other tasks and processes while 
using the service. In that case, the service needs to be aligned with these 
tasks. A secretary, who is frequently disturbed by incoming phone calls for 
example, has different service requirements than someone who can fully 
concentrate on using the service. In addition, using speech input to com-
municate with the interface is not so suitable in a noisy environment. How-
ever, users of mobile services, even one single user, are likely to use the 
service in different environments and under different circumstances. In 
most cases, use of the service occurs in varying contexts, some of which are 
unpredictable. As a result, it is hard to foresee the precise context in which 
the user, the technology and interaction between them will occur.  
The functionalities that are provided by the service have to match the 
goals and sub-goals of the users. Vice versa, functionality that they do not 
need should be hidden. One strategy to achieve this is to apply personalisa-
tion. Storage of user preferences and characteristics contributes to a service 
that exactly provides what a user needs to achieve his goals. These goals 
may however shift, depending on the context the user is in. The service sys-
tem thus should be flexible and also be able to handle these exceptions.  
Although, you might not know all relevant aspects in advance, the occur-
rence of some environmental aspects can usually be estimated. Gorlenko 

 
 
5 Design approaches for Service Systems 
 
 
 
131
and Merrik (2003) illuminate a number of substantial aspects that are to be 
considered in the design of mobile systems: 
x
Environmental variations e.g. temperature, precipitation and lighting 
conditions might affect performance of mobile hardware. Batteries are 
consumed more quickly, processors run more slowly at low tempera-
tures and screens are more difficult to see clearly in bright light 
x
Noisy and distractive environments make mobile systems hard to fully 
interact with 
x
Users move, to some extent, from place to place and mobile systems 
must be able to follow and be usable on the move 
x
Competition for attention in multitask mobile settings where users are 
engaged in other tasks and using a mobile system at the same time. 
x
Users might need to manipulate other physical objects during interac-
tion with mobile systems. 
In these five aspects utility and usability issues highly interrelate. The first 
aspect for example may result in a non-functional device, as a result the ser-
vice-product cannot be provided. However, even in a case where only the 
interface does not function, the result is the same: the service-product can-
not be provided. And although the fourth aspect certainly needs to be con-
sidered in the analysis of user processes and the fit of the service to these 
processes; smart design of the interface might resolve some of these atten-
tion issues. In this case it is very important to attract the attention of the 
user; the system may for example apply a combination of audio signals and 
visual signals, instead of only using visual signals. 
The criteria presented here all more or less relate to the notion of fit. The 
technology has to fit the user, the task and the context of use. Several re-
searchers have elaborated on this notion of task-technology fit which is also 
referred to as the Contingency Perspective. See for example Benbasat and 
Lim (1993) and Zigurs and Buckland (1998). Gebauer and Shaw applied the 
concept in their study of the success factors and impacts of mobile business 
applications (Gebauer & Shaw, 2004). They investigated the influence of 
technology characteristics and task characteristics on the usage of the mo-
bile application that provided the service. Poor technology characteristics 
inhibited the usage of the application to a great extent. With respect to task 
support users valued two things most: notification, and support of simple 
activities like tracking, as opposed to handling more complex processes 
completely on-line.

5.6.3
Assessment of the user and his/her context 
In the ergonomics discipline several methods have been developed that 
support the analysis of all kind of aspects of the user and the setting the 
user is in. Methods include (see for example Stanton and Young (1999), 
Mayhew (1999), and Andriessen (2003) for an overview): 
x
interviews (unstructured, semi-structured, and structured) 
x
questionnaires
x
surveys
x
(cognitive) task analysis methods, (see (Schraagen, Chipman, & Shute, 
2000)
x
(participative) observation 
x
participative design (Holtzblatt & Beyer, 1996) 
Currently participative design approaches are more popular in software 
design than approaches where experts design the system based on limited 
input of the users. Researchers found that studying users from the ‘outside’ 
is not enough; users had to be involved in the design process itself (Bannon, 
1991; Crabtree, 2003). In participative approaches (intended) users of the 
system are involved in the design process and in evaluation activities related 
to this process. As Bannon (1991) describes it: “users are not simply passive ob-
jects that others must study and design for. […] People are, or can become, active agents.”
The information offered by the service system should match the infor-
mation needs of the user as closely as possible. The interface should offer all 
the information needed and leave out irrelevant information. Just as user 
goals may shift, their information needs may shift as well. As a consequence, 
different requirements concerning the information provided may evolve. 
These changes may relate to the information itself, as well as to how it is 
presented. A navigation support system for example may provide an over-
view of all traffic-jams on the route, or limit this overview to the first 20 
km. The system may also provide an overview of traffic-jams within a radius 
of 20 km, and in that way support the driver in his orientation on alternative 
routes (or on the availability of restaurant to have a lunch break). In this 
example, the goals of the user influence two aspects of his information 
needs: the content of information and the way it should be presented. Re-
quirements for the content of information are related to user processes, and 
requirements for the presentation of information are related to the interac-
tion process. 
With the complicating dynamics of mobile service systems in mind we 
propose to follow this trend in designing these service systems. Involving

133
users from the beginning in the design of the user process increases the 
quality of the design. For, the users are the real experts on their task and 
context. Human factors experts may still have an important role in partici-
pative design processes, although this role is slightly different and demands 
different skills. For users can not fully understand all the possibilities of-
fered by ICT. They need input in order to be able to imagine what the fu-
ture might be like, using the system to be developed (Kuutti, 1996). This 
input can be provided by a technology expert for example; someone who 
knows the capabilities of the available technology very well. The expert and 
user may be able to construct the future situation together, using scenarios 
for example. The role of the design expert transforms into a facilitator of 
this process.  
5.7
Process management and project management  
In chapter 4, the value networks and organisational network of mobile ser-
vice systems have been discussed. Mobile service systems include many or-
ganisations. Each of these organisations, including operators, content 
providers, IT-application providers and hand set providers is important at 
some point in the development process, as shown in chapter 3. Mobile ser-
vices need to be developed jointly by operators, content providers and IT 
application providers. In many cases organisations are open for participation 
in innovative service development projects. It appears that the main reasons 
for participation, in the explorative phase in particular, are not profit but the 
strengthening of the image as a high-tech and innovative firm keeping up 
with state-of-the art developments and initiatives. Another observation 
made was that often already existing ties between organisations are pre-
ferred over new relationships when starting risky innovative projects. Since 
various dependent actors are involved in a relatively unknown area it is im-
portant to create advantages for each actor. 
Process management 
Involving relevant organisations, creating win-win situations, managing their 
involvement and the design process requires a way to deal with decision 
making in actors networks. Process management techniques can help to 
involve the relevant actors in the design process. As (Checkland, 1999) ar-
gues ‘a systems thinker would know that the process of policy creation and 
policy content are entirely complementary, the process itself conditioning 
what might emerge as content. Both need to be thought about together; but 
this is not yet a familiar concept.’ De Bruijn et al. (2002) elaborated on 
process management. Actors and their values, language and argumentation 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
134
are important in a process management approach. The focus is on identifi-
cation and implementation of changes. The design requirements are more 
than just involving parties, but include a sense of urgency, openness and 
integrity, protection of core interests and core values of parties, incentives 
for continuation, and process type arrangements to facilitate sufficient and 
validated content.  
The actors focus on following agreements, meetings and negotiations. 
The process architect has to design a decision-making process that complies 
with rules and agreements that result from negotiations with the involved 
stakeholders. The process manager then schedules negotiating rounds in 
accordance with the process design, monitoring to ensure that negotiating 
rules are upheld, and adjusts the process design with the stakeholders when 
necessary. Gaming is a tool applied with success to design processes.  
Process designers have few tools to test their designs. It is difficult to 
predict the developments and events of decision making in actor networks. 
One instrument that is applied with some success for this purpose is gam-
ing-simulations (Mayer & Veeneman, 2002). 
Project management 
Process management can be positioned versus project management. Project 
management is the traditional form of management used to control pro-
jects, including system design projects. In project management it is assumed 
that problems and solutions are reasonably stable within certain limits, and 
that clear goals and targets can be set, a fixed time schedule can be followed, 
a clear framework and a prefixed end product can be used (Meredith & 
Mantel, 2003). De Bruijn et al. (2002) argue that this only works in a static 
world and that this approach is impossible for dynamic activities. They add 
“there will be dynamic particularly when decisions have to be taken in a 
network. The various parties hold different views about how a problem and 
a solution should be defined. As a result, the decision making will always be 
capricious and unstructured”. For the design of mobile service systems 
there are nevertheless components and development stages in which project 
management is a most effective management approach. 
Use of management approaches in designing mobile service systems 
Both project and process management is needed in designing mobile service 
systems:
x
Process management is required for committing actors to the develop-
ment of the project and seeking consensus on common goals and nego-
tiating win-win situations.

x
Project management techniques are required for managing the devel-
opment of the project with respect to time and money constraints. Pro-
ject organisations are needed to embed interdisciplinary design teams 
within the network of actors.  
5.8
Mobile Service Systems design approach elements  
In the above we discussed systems engineering, product design, information 
systems design, collaborative business engineering, component based devel-
opment, user centred design, and project and process management as 
sources of inspiration for formulating a design approach for the design of 
mobile service systems. None of the above discussed families of design ap-
proaches completely cover the needs for designing mobile service systems. 
A combination of elements of the approaches offers a good start to fulfil 
the requirements for a design approach. This consists of a general set of 
rules, conditions and characteristics for such an approach. We will address 
the underlying worldview and principles of such an approach (way of think-
ing), the managerial aspects of the approach (design process), features relat-
ing to the methodical aspect of the approach (design activities) and features 
relating to the modelling techniques that are suitable for such an approach 
(modelling methods). 
Way of thinking for designing mobile service systems 
A central theme in our way of thinking is systems thinking (see section 5.1). 
In designing these systems it is necessary to address the three elements as 
discussed in the first chapters: (a) the service concept based on the cus-
tomer’s needs, (b) the ‘hard’ enabling information and communication 
technology or the technical architecture, (c) the ‘soft’ organisational network 
with its value drivers and actor interdependencies.  
With respect to the service concept a number of questions around the future 
use and future users of the service need to be answered. Important factors 
to assess or define are a profile of the intended users, their level of experi-
ence, and their interest in the new service. Around the service itself, it is im-
portant to assess the context of use, the user him-/herself, whether the 
service is replacing one or more existing services, and what the added value 
of the new service is compared to what the intended users are using right 
now. Designers have to make many decisions when designing the service 
concept starting with pinpointing the target group. To get a good idea about 
the financial feasibility of the service, an estimation of the frequency of use, 
the number of users, and the price the users are potential prepared to pay 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
136
should be estimated. Pilots, or even free connection plans to allow custom-
ers to explore services can help companies to find answers to these ques-
tions. Depending on the kind of service there are many other issues such as 
localisation-based or not; privacy sensitivity; availability of suitable handsets 
owned by the target group; content quality and richness; the non-functional 
requirements.  
With respect to the technical architecture the limitations of enabling tech-
nology should not be neglected in the decision making process concerning a 
target group and market launch. Examples of these limitations are limited 
processing power, battery life and memory of devices and limited band-
width and latencies of the network. These limitations have to be taken into 
account when formulating the service process requirements; otherwise a 
potentially good service concept suffers from a bad start due to technical 
limitations. In chapter 2, we formulated reliability, responsiveness, user in-
terface, trust and customisation as parameters of the service process quality 
requirements. The level of quality has to match customer demand, and what 
has been promised must be technologically feasible. A guideline with regard 
to the technical architecture for designing mobile service systems is to build 
only services based on robust components and not to promise more than is 
technologically feasible. Three other important requirements are to deal with 
the complexity of technological architectures, the legacy systems with which 
the technology component have to be connected, and often the lack of stan-
dardization to realise easy interfaces.  
With respect to the organisational network the design of mobile services 
should be looked upon as designing a complex system with resource inter-
dependencies and constraints that have to be taken into account when cre-
ating the network organisation. An actor network perspective should be 
adopted and it is important to incorporate dynamics: partners join the net-
work, leave the network and get a changing role when they are involved in 
take-overs or mergers. Agreeing on entry and exit rules when creating a 
network organisation (for example with operators, content providers, IT 
application providers and handset providers) for co-development of ser-
vices can help to deal with those dynamics is important.  Reasons for or-
ganisations to participate in a network organisation might differ; for 
example they might be driven by innovation, learning, market entry options, 
or reputation building. The reason does not have to be profit driven in first 
instance. Embedded relational ties, either through earlier joint projects or 
through personal transitions between firms, heavily influence the choice of 
partners.

137
Design activities 
Design activities for services cannot be serially executed; a waterfall method 
is too static to deal with the necessary iteration. The design activities have to 
be part of an  incremental and structured work methods, for example the 
spiral model as introduced by Boehm (1988). A distinction can be made be-
tween the early exploration and the later exploitation phase in the mobile 
service systems design process. In the exploration phase, mobile service de-
sign should include radical thinking with at the same time structured tasks. 
In the exploitation phase a more evolutionary approach is recommended to 
ensure the buy-in of the various partners and the customers.  
The design has to start by determining customers’ wants and needs fo-
cusing on delivering value to a target group in a specific context. User re-
quirements are often uncertain, necessitating the involvement of users in the 
design process. Alam and Perry (2002) list the activities performed by cus-
tomers in the new service development process. Also, design activities used 
in established participative design methods are recommended (see e.g., Ban-
non, 1991; Holtzblatt & Beyer, 1996).  
The design activities for the functional design have to be done in itera-
tion with the activities for the technical design. The continuous feedback is 
necessary to realise a design which is technical feasible as well as functional 
for the user. This iterative way of working is also needed to cooperate effec-
tively with all the involved stakeholders. The chance for a successful realisa-
tion and exploitation of the service will increase when all actors are 
committed to the designed service system. The actors all together also have 
to agree on the business for the service system. The business case for each 
partner can be derived from the services’ business model.  
Furthermore, testing should be an integral part of an iterative cycle, i.e. 
technological testing and user tests aimed at offering added value and us-
ability.
Design process 
Little is known about how the design process for new services should be 
managed. One of the reasons is that service development differs from 
product development because of the involvement of the customers in ser-
vices which requires a customer-oriented new service process (Alam & 
Perry, 2002). This means that the customer’s input in the service develop-
ment process has to be managed. Furthermore, the design of new services 
needs the involvement of different kind of actors and organisations. This 
implies that there will be an ongoing multi-actor decision-making process in 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
138
different phases (Stevens & Dimitriadis, 2005). The following is necessary 
to manage this design process. 
x
The design process should be managed as a project, although process 
management elements are also needed to commit participants and cre-
ate an inspiring environment. Participation of stakeholders and experts 
is very important. Managing their involvement differs in the exploration 
and exploitation phase considering the different features of the network 
organisation. Openness and integrity are important to reach achieve-
ment between the different involved stakeholders. Use incentives for 
continuation such as learning and reputation in the exploration phase, 
and revenues in the exploitation phase. 
x
Use agreements, meetings and negotiations aiming for the creation of 
win-win situations, trust is important in the exploration phase and con-
tracts in the exploitation phase. Reducing uncertainty is possible using 
established relational ties when creating the value network. From the 
first moment of intention to cooperate on, a common communication 
strategy shared by all stakeholders is needed.  
x
To achieve results the use of a project management approach is needed 
to manage the interdisciplinary teams in which the different roles with 
their skills are represented, such as creative content developers, innova-
tive application builders and procedural operators.  
Modelling methods 
During the design process models help to describe and visualise the service 
system. These models can be used to support communication between de-
signers and between designers and users.  
x
The service concept can be modelled with modelling tools from the 
product design and information system design disciplines. E.g. scenar-
ios, storyboards, artist impressions, prototypes and emulations.  
x
Object oriented dynamic modelling is recommended for the application 
designs. Appendix A briefly illustrates the modelling technique called 
UML – Unified Modelling Language, which is currently the most fre-
quently used modelling technique used for designing information sys-
tems such as mobile service systems. 
x
Conceptual modelling of the organisational network is helpful to get an 
overview of the network’s actors and roles. When situations arise with 
conflicts of interest using gaming can be considered as a way to model 
the interaction between persons.

139
Tools 
During the design process we can use many support tools to facilitate the 
design process. The main reasons for using tools are: dealing with and re-
ducing complexity during the design process, communicating design options 
with other designers, clients, potential users, and other stakeholders, and 
documenting the design process and its outcomes. Good tools help design-
ers to follow a clear process while generating important deliverables that 
form the basis for the next stage in the design process. Therefore, most 
tools have a process part and a content part. 
Many classical design support tools from other disciplines can be used in 
service system design, such as case tools (e.g. CAD/CAM), presentation 
tools (e.g. beamers), simulation and gaming tools (e.g. ArenaTM), diagram-
ming tools (e.g. Visio), application development tools (mostly supplier 
based, e.g. SDK from Nokia), usability laboratories (see section 5.6), and 
Group Support Systems (see chapter 7) for user elicitation and supplier ne-
gotiation. Each of the disciplines mentioned in this chapter has its own pre-
ferred tools, and designers can use any of these tools for service design. The 
fact that tools partially overlap is not seen as a huge problem, because a 
good overview is best provided by describing the service from different an-
gles. Recently, literature appears in which is described which tools are suit-
able for service design, e.g. (Tukker & Tischner, 2006, p.102) mention 
“blueprinting for visualising the structure of a service, gap analysis for de-
tecting possible problems and quality function deployment (QFD) for 
minimising those gaps” as existing tools that play a major role in service 
design. Simons (2006) introduces tools also based on QFD to design e-
services in a multi-channel context.  
To conclude 
The above inventory lists requirements and ideas for a design approach for 
mobile service systems. These features form the basis for an illustrative im-
plementation of a design approach for Mobile service systems which is pre-
sented in the next chapter.

Mobile Service System Design approach 
An example of an approach to designing mobile services is provided in this 
chapter. An overview of the design approach for mobile service systems is 
shown in Figure 6-1.  
Figure 6-1 An overview of the design approach for mobile information service systems 

Designing Mobile Service Systems

The approach consists of a way of thinking, a design process, design ac-
tivities, modelling methods and tools presented in a framework. The way of 
thinking is used to provide guidelines that can be used as leading principles 
for the design activities. The design process is the design of the ‘design 
process’ which consists of process management and project management 
activities. The design activities are divided into the phases analysis, prepara-
tion, synthesis, implementation and test. Models are used during these de-
sign activities. Tools support the whole design approach. The light bulb is 
used to express an idea that might come from radical thinking and that 
starts the design process. This design approach will be further explained in 
the next sections.  
6.1
The way of thinking 
Mobile Information Services systems result from combining enabling tech-
nology, a service concept demanded by users and this service being supplied 
by organisational network. This model was introduced in chapter 1. In 
chapters 2 to 4 of this book these ‘what’ aspects are explained.  
The guidelines in the way of thinking are the three trade-offs between 
the service system elements service concept, technological architecture and 
organisational network.  
6.1.1
Trade-off between service concept – technological ar-
chitecture 
A lot of money has been invested in new technologies in which business 
developers believed. However, their expectations are often not realised. It is 
very difficult to know which service concepts users demand based on new 
technology. The uncertainty in demand causes anxiety levels to rise as it oc-
curs at times when operators are under financial strain. The design approach 
should include elicitation of user requirements and have user’s test proto-
types. The market failure of WAP services confirms this. Users cannot be 
regarded as one big amorphous group. First, different target groups have to 
be distinguished and representatives of these target groups have to be in-
volved in the design approach. In chapter 2 we concluded that starting the 
design process with customers’ wants and needs in mind and focusing on 
delivering value to the target group is one of the requirements of our design 
approach.  

 
 6 Mobile Service System Design approach 
 
 
 
143
Guidelines: 
x
the targeted user has to be part of the design approach in all phases of 
the design process; except in the synthesis phase. 
x
the design approach has to start with the investigation of the targeted 
user’s context, wants and needs. 
We argue that the targeted user has to be involved as much as possible 
during the design process in the exploration and the exploitation phase. 
However, this does not mean that experts only do what users tell them to 
do. The experts have to be creative and hopefully come with great ideas and 
designs. The designers need to have knowledge of the performance of the 
available technology. Involving the user means that designers can have their 
ideas tested by users in several phases of the design process. We will elabo-
rate on how to do this in the way of working.  
6.1.2
Trade-off between service concept -  organisational 
network
The partners in the value network have to agree on the service concept, 
the differentiating value proposition offered to the customer. The service 
concept is determined by dominant actors’ decisions along the dimensions 
of their business models (after Pedersen & Methlie, 2004). Together they 
have to decide on the value proposition and this can only be based on their 
perception of the customer’s expectations. The gap between the customer’s 
expectations and the service as delivered by the service provider has to be 
carefully managed (see e.g. (Zeithaml et al., 2006)).  
Marketing is crucial for handling the perceived customer value. The 
company that has a billing relationship with a customer is often considered 
to be the ‘owner of the customer’. This owner takes care of customer rela-
tionship management. The operators almost always have the billing relation-
ship in the case of mobile information services. This makes the other actors 
in the network dependent on the operator. The operator can decide to do 
the marketing and branding together with the content provider, for example 
as in some iMode cases where the operator and content providers together 
advertise in the market [(see e.g. the Radio 538 ringtone iMode service case 
in (Van de Kar, Maitland, Wehn de Montalvo, & Bouwman, 2003)].  This is 
different if an independent service provider has the relationship with the 
customer. A service provider might decide to hide the brand of the operator 
for the customers. Service providers or content providers can start their 
own marketing campaign or join with a distributor with a known reputation 
in the targeted customer market, e.g. a supermarket. Another example is the

marketing and distribution of a mobile service packaged with a holiday or 
conference offer. 
6.1.3
Trade-off between technological architecture - organ-
isational network  
Fast developing technology is present in all layers involved in producing 
mobile information services. The layers between the mobile service and the 
user are the content, servers, content platform area, gateways, networks and 
clients (Natsuno, 2003).  Each of these layers has it’s own industry partici-
pants and together they produce mobile information services. In the last few 
years new technology in all the layers enabling new services have came onto 
the market. Improved technology with regard to the client and the network 
has had the most impact on service development. On the client side new 
phones have appeared and continue to do so, that are smaller and lighter 
and have colour displays, built-in cameras, sound chips for playing poly-
phonic ring tones, wireless connectivity to other devices, and software to 
connect the device to the Internet. The network has evolved, from analogue, 
to GSM, HSCSD, GPRS, EDGE, and UMTS, and now provides the user 
with higher transmission speeds and shorter downloading times. To profit 
fully from the capabilities the client side and network offer, the gateways, con-
tent platforms, and servers also have to evolve. If the various firms involved in 
this process manage to cooperate, the new technology will enable new ser-
vices that will be adopted by users.  
Technology development in the mobile field is quite dynamic. New wire-
less technology faces competition from other wireless technologies. This 
means that firms must get services to market quickly to forestall the poten-
tial that the technology in which they have invested heavily is bypassed. This 
pressure is either compounded by or mediated by a firm’s general innova-
tion strategy, whether it prefers to develop first-mover advantages or to ob-
serve and enter a market later. There are also time pressures related to 
network rollout requirements that governments place on network operators 
when granting a license. Although not a direct mandate to cooperate, dead-
lines for a network rollout often do not allow an operator the time to de-
velop all of the competencies in-house and thus firms are forced to turn to 
cooperative relationships to procure services. However, the increasing in-
volvement of companies outside the traditional (mobile) telecommunication 
industry creates longer timeframes for establishing cooperative relations. 
Thus, despite the increased time-to-market pressure, the development of 
innovative services across traditional industries takes time. It takes time to 
establish cooperative relations. Yet time pressure is the case when attempt-

ing to get a first-mover advantage in the upcoming UMTS competitive mar-
ket. The process management elements openness, protection of core values, 
speed and substance mentioned in the theory of De Bruijn et al. (2002) are 
helpful here. Incorporating dynamics is required when creating the network.  
Guideline: 
x
take your time to establish a value network and speed up the develop-
ment process when that is in place. 
The need for the flexible creation of a value network puts a heavy de-
mand on the supporting technical systems. New services and processes for 
service provisioning should be created using a pool of existing and new 
components and web-services. Openness of the standards used for this is 
key in being able to couple various services. A radical innovation might 
originate from a new technology. However, as the service design process 
starts complexity has to be reduced and the specification should be made 
explicit (Roozenburg & Eekels, 1995). The service should be assembled 
from robust components. This will prevent problems such as those that 
occurred in the first WAP services (Barnes, 2003; Van de Kar, 2002). Tech-
nical resource interdependencies are defined by the service requirements; 
existing technology often does not answer the customer’s demands for use-
ful and usable services. The technology interdependencies are extensive; 
companies have to cooperate to make a service work technically, and such 
technological interdependencies require a new form of coordination where a 
proven service IT architecture leads the various applications and content 
providers in the value network.  
Guideline: 
x
actors in the network can only start to design applications if a proven 
service IT architecture is provided by the leading actor as basis for the 
various applications. 
6.2
Design process, design activities and modelling 
methods
The guidelines listed in section 6.1 outline the design process, design activi-
ties and modelling methods. These design activities are divided into phases, 
i.e. Analysis, Preparation, Synthesis, Implementation and Test. In each of 
these phases we have to deal with the trade-offs between the service system 
elements.
The design process is controlled by project and process management ac-
tivities. These activities are all related to the actors and their interests and 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
146
values. These are covered in design activities in the service element ‘organ-
isational network’. The design activities to build the ‘hard’ part of the service 
system are related to the technical architecture. All based on continuous in-
put of the users. The deliverables of each design element in each phase are 
described in Table 6-1.

We describe the design activities per phase below. The activities are visu-
alised in diagrams for each phase. We number the design activities with first 
the letter of the phase followed by the letter of the element and at the end 
the number of the activity in this combination. The duration of the design 
project depends on the sense of urgency, amount of resources, unexpected 
incidents and other variables. Models are mentioned if recommended for an 
activity in the activity description.  
The ‘APSIT’ method described below for mobile information services 
can be used as a kind of cookbook. Activities can be added in each of the 
phases depending on the project specific circumstances. It is important that 
the triad ‘organisational network, technical architecture and service concept’ 
is always taken into account. The deliverables mentioned in Table 6-1 are 
also mentioned in the next subsections in which we further explain the five 
phases. The exact form of these deliverables depends on the project specific 
circumstances. It is important to decide at the start of a project what the 
form and content of the deliverables will be.

6.2.1
Analysis 
Figure 6-2 Analysis 
A.O.1 Process design 
First, the process for forming the network of actors has to be run through. 
It is important to incorporate dynamics in this process and to do this care-
fully. The creating of the network organisation can be done by executing the 
following sub activities (based on De Bruijn et al., 2002). 
x
Exploring the problem; although the process involves several actors, the 
start of the process will be the concern of one actor or a limited number 
of actors. If there is a vague idea of the service that will be designed it is 
time to investigate the available actors that are in the market and willing 
to participate in the project. The initiator will first discuss the idea with 
actors that it knows and trusts. 
x
Actor scans; it takes quite some time to figure out what kinds of exper-
tise will be needed and with what actors ‘it clicks’. Since the service pro-
vider, operator and content provider will form the core of the network 
they have to be scanned. In innovation projects the drivers for firms to 
participate are to support the firm’s image, to learn and to achieve a 
competitive advantage. Therefore it is most fruitfu to approach firms 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
148
for which the above count. The table of roles (Table 4-2) can be used as 
a checklist to figure out whether the necessary roles are fulfilled.   
x
Quick scan of configurations; there might be conflicting views held by 
actors that the initiator has to deal with. The initiator can nominate a 
process architect to deal with this when the initiator has too great a part 
of the process. The conflicts should be formulated as dilemmas where 
possible, as framing a conflict as a dilemma has positive effects on the 
process (De Bruijn et al., 2002). 
x
Process dilemmas and fixing the rules of the game. The initiator has to 
make sure that the dilemmas are solvable to an extent that they will not 
hinder the result. Dilemmas in the exploitation phase might be centred 
on the revenue model. Is revenue sharing an option if the result is an 
uncertainty? If the initiator is a large company the situation is different 
from that where the initiator is a small or medium sized enterprise 
(SME). In the first case, the initiator might speed up the process by hav-
ing a governance model in place, as used in portals such as iMode and 
Vodafone Life. However, this might hinder open cooperation. 
When it becomes clear what the network will look like agreements have 
to be made regarding entry and exit rules, decision-making rules and project 
management issues such as the organisation of the project, i.e. chairman, 
steering committee, workgroups, secretariat and the planning and budget. It 
is recommended that sufficient time is taken to establish the network as this 
prevents problems later. Modelling methods can help here with actor and 
role diagrams.  
A.O.2 Agreement on intention to cooperate and external communi-
cation with main actors 
At the point that actors express their intention to participate it is necessary, 
and important in this early phase, to make clear what information is confi-
dential and what can be made public. It is also necessary to agree on which 
actor is going to communicate what externally, to the press and so on. One 
of the issues is to prevent negative publicity regarding first reactions. In in-
novation projects agreements on confidentially and communication have to 
be made at the start. This activity is related to the process of formulating the 
storyboards (A.S.3) and the technical and functional design decisions 
(A.T.2) since the output of these activities are resource and knowledge. 
A.T.1 
Scan available and usable technologies 
 
It is a time consuming task to figure out a good combination of handsets, 
applications and the network. The innovation cycle for each of these differ 

 
 6 Mobile Service System Design approach 
 
 
 
149
substantially. One of our guidelines is that the design approach has to start 
with the targeted user’s context. However, since the services are driven by 
the technology that enables these services, it is necessary to investigate the 
availability of technologies that are reliable and robust enough to function as 
an enabler. This also sets the boundaries for how advanced the service will 
be.
A.T.2 
Making an overview of functional and technical design deci-
sions
Between the service and the user is the layered structure of the Internet that 
consists of the content, servers, content platform, gateways, networks and 
clients (Natsuno, 2003). The details of this structure will be defined in the 
preparation and synthesis field. However, based on the output of activity 
A.T.1, the initiator will have ideas regarding which functionalities and tech-
nologies it absolutely does not want to use and which it absolutely does 
want to use. The output is an overview of remaining options to discuss with 
the other partners when the value network of actors has been formed. Ex-
amples are mobile network technology, i.e. GSM, GPRS, UMTS, WLAN or 
combinations there-of, positioning technology, i.e. network-based, satellite-
based or hybrid and the application protocols, i.e. WAP, iMode or Java (see 
also chapter 3).  
A.S.1 
Getting knowledge on what the customer wants 
The design approach starts with deciding which target group to address and 
then with asking the target group about the problems they want to be 
solved in a certain circumstance. 
Each activity in the user requirement elicitation process requires selecting 
effective and efficient techniques (Bruseberg & McDonagh, 2003). Demon-
stration of future scenarios can be realised, for example, through a visual 
presentation or through letting the users handle a prototype. Solution gen-
eration can be realised through different brainstorming techniques. Thin-
kLets can be used for the selection of techniques for the collaborative 
activities (Briggs, De Vreede, & Nunamaker, 2003). ThinkLets are modular 
components for building a “script” for the facilitation of the group process. 
Each thinkLet addresses a specific subtask and is highly structured in order 
to make it repeatable and easy for a new facilitator to draw on the proven 
experience on which it is based. The modular nature of the ThinkLets pro-
vides for flexibility and adaptiveness in developing the script. There are 
about fifty thinkLets documented and each helps a group move through 
one of five activities: diverge, converge, organise, evaluate, and build con-

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
150
sensus. Thinklets are often used as part of a Group Support System. For 
more information on thinkLets we refer to (Briggs et al., 2003). 
There are three decisions when designing a repeatable process for user 
requirements elicitation: the participants to invite, the steps to take, and the 
techniques to use (Den Hengst, Van de Kar, & Appelman, 2004). Each of 
these three elements will be presented below. Together they form the re-
peatable process for user requirements elicitation. 
Selecting and inviting the participants is the first step for analysing user 
requirements. The guidelines for selecting participants are: 
x
Participants need to be reasonable knowledgeable about the topic.  
x
Participants should be interested in talking about it.  
x
The group should not include too many different types of people; the 
participants should share a similar background.  
x
Participants should be comfortable of talking to each other, but over-
familiarity might have a negative effect on the results.  
The size of the group depends on the facilitation equipment. Group ses-
sions that are not facilitated by a Group Support System (GSS) ideally have 
between five and twelve participants. GSS, however, have been found to 
effectively support large groups (more than 8 members) (Dennis, Valacich, 
& Nunamaker, 1990). The number of participants is only limited by the fa-
cilities used. Facilities are available that can easily host 50 participants. 
More than one session is needed when the number of people is larger 
that the numbers mentioned above. A second reason for having more than 
one session is the identification of different types of users who do not have 
a similar background. For each type of user, a separate session should be 
planned.
Steps to take during a user requirement elicitation session are: Warming-
up; Problem analysis; Solution generation; Demonstration of future scenar-
ios (presentation); and the Redefinition of solutions. In this last step the 
participants start drawing the first designs for the service. These are pre-
sented and discussed.
The time schedule for the repeatable process is 3.5 hours in total. Prior 
experience has shown that three hours is a suitable length for these kinds of 
sessions (Bruseberg & McDonagh, 2003). The warm-up takes about 30 
minutes; the problem analysis is scheduled for 75 minutes. The generation 
of solutions takes no more than 15 minutes. The demonstration is sched-
uled for 20 minutes, and the redefinition of solutions takes 55 minutes. 
With a break in the middle and a closure in the end, the session totals to 3.5 

 
 6 Mobile Service System Design approach 
 
 
 
151
hours. This schedule is based on a group size of 15 participants and the use 
of a GSS. With more or less participants, the time schedule should be 
adapted.
A.S.2 
Analysis of existing services 
If the initiator has any idea of the offer she or he has to find out whether 
the offer is readily available from competitors. The business strategy is dif-
ferent if the mobile service proposition is completely new or has some new 
service features. The service might also be innovative regarding the underly-
ing technology of the target group in relation to context or the business 
model. For any of these situations market research is recommended. Rea-
sons for doing market research might include to monitor competitive activi-
ties, stay on top of industry events, analyse new business opportunities, or 
to search out strategic alliance partners (Vassos, 1996). The market research 
will provide insight into the uniqueness of the mobile service idea and might 
provide ideas for partners and service features. The Internet can be a pow-
erful resource to find out what is going on in the market. The Internet can 
be used to conduct primary research and to access market research that has 
already been completed by other organisations or government agencies (see 
Vassos, 1996). Furthermore, it is important to take care that the market re-
search and existing service ideas do not hinder lateral thinking. 
A.S.3 
Drawing storyboards  
Professionals add their knowledge, expertise and creativity to develop story-
lines based on the output of the user requirement elicitation sessions. Mod-
elling techniques originating from product design theories are helpful here. 
The terms storyboards, storylines and scripts can be used. The result of this 
activity should provide the first ideas for this and these issues have to be 
further elaborated in the activities which follow. Usage scenarios can be 
used to model the service in the context of many interactions. Otherwise, 
storyboards are sufficient. Photographs, descriptive text and drawn pictures 
can be used to create storyboards.

Preparation 
Figure 6-3 Preparation 
P.O.1 Shared requirement session 
The involved actors have their own expertise, views and interest in partici-
pating in the design process. The deliverable of the analysis phase is that 
they intend to participate in the network organisation. The first activity in 
the Preparation phase is to agree on the requirements for the service system.  
So, once the actors are known an initial meeting can be organised. This 
can be combined with a collaborative service design session to deal with the 
complexity of the information service requirements. One of the objects of 
this should be to come to a shared vision of what the delivered customer 

 
 6 Mobile Service System Design approach 
 
 
 
153
value will be. The EasyWinWin methodology with GSS can be used for this. 
For an overview of the design of such a WinWin approach session we refer 
to (Boehm, 1988; Briggs & Grünbacher, 2002). 
When all actors have a shared view on the value to offer this can be for-
mulated in terms of rough requirements for the service system. The actors 
involved with the technical design and service concept design can from 
there on further detail their part of the service system.  
P.O.2 Business case for the network and for each partner 
During the preparation phase the final decisions are made as to which ac-
tors are partners in the project. Every partner has to decide: ‘What is in it 
for us?’; ‘What risk are we taking?’. Each partner must develop a kind of 
business case. In the exploration phase especially the partners’ benefits are 
beyond financial figures. Partners who are enthusiastic about the project 
have ‘to sell’ participation within their company; they have to explain the 
benefits of participation. Based on Afuah and Tucci (2001); Hedman and 
Kalling (2003) and Timmers (1998) we suggest the following business 
model components to use as ‘hard’ evaluation criteria. Be aware that this is 
NOT on the level of the individual organisation but on the level of the net-
work organisation designing the mobile information service. 
x
Potential benefits: Are the partners strategically interesting? What is the 
relative benefit of participating in the value network? Is there an advan-
tage for each partner regarding reputation or learning?  
x
Cost structure and revenue source models: Is there concordance con-
cerning the division of the needed investment and revenue flows? What 
is the outcome of a risk analysis? 
x
Connected activities: Do the partners have complementary resources 
and skills? Is the partnership good for each partner’s reputation? 
x
Scope: What is the scope of the service development purpose? What is 
the scope of the market to reach? 
x
Implementation: Which organisational structure, systems and skills are 
necessary and available to execute the project? 
x
Capabilities: What are the capabilities of the value network? What are 
the shortcomings? Can they be overcome? 
x
Sustainability: Is it hard to imitate the network organisation? Is there a 
competitive advantage for the network organisation? 
These questions have to be answered for the whole network organisation 
and based on these starting points the individual actors can define their own 
business case. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
154
P.O.3 Define roles, responsibilities and tasks  
The roles, responsibilities and tasks for the building activities have to be 
decided in this phase. During the design process specific design roles like 
application design have to be fulfilled. The actor and role table in chapter 4 
can be used to check if the roles are covered. It is important to communi-
cate clearly to all project members which actor is expected to fulfil which 
role. At the same time co-development of the services between operators, 
content providers, application developers and handset providers is a must, 
as shown in chapter 4.  It is not recommended to control this process too 
tightly during an exploration phase. This is a situation with a network struc-
ture that has a high density, limited stability and low centrality; therefore the 
duration should be limited and the frequency of interaction high.   
Process management elements are required to guarantee speed in the de-
sign process (see also chapter 5 referring to De Bruijn et al., 2002):  
x
the process should create the prospects of gain and incentives for coop-
erative behaviour 
x
the participants should have commitment power 
x
the environment should enable the process to be speeded up 
x
conflicts should be transferred to the periphery of the process 
x
command and control should be used as an incentive to speed up the 
process.
x
In this activity project management approaches and tools are also 
needed to achieve the planned results. E.g. the project management ap-
proach ‘Six Sigma’ and structured product development approach 
‘QFD’, although these methods are very detailed, strict and require dis-
cipline (Cohen, 1995; Creveling et al., 2003). 
P.T.1 
Technical architecture design 
The principles of a technical architecture are explained in chapter 3. This 
can be used to make an overview of the whole technical architecture; this 
has to be designed from a top-down perspective and then filled in. Jagoe 
(2003) presents examples of a simple LBS infrastructure and of a J2EE ap-
plication server that delivers characteristics that are very useful for building 
mobile location services. 
As explained in chapter 5 it is advisable to use a component based de-
velopment (CBD) approach to model the mobile information service sys-
tem. The modelling consists of ‘component architecture modelling’, where a 
collection of related components are proposed and redefined, ‘context 
modelling’, to understand the scope of the system to be developed, and ‘in-

 
 6 Mobile Service System Design approach 
 
 
 
155
terface modelling’, in which the interfaces are described in detail. Unified 
Modelling Language (UML) tools such as use cases, sequence diagrams and 
component diagram can be used for CBD. See also appendix A. 
P.T.2 
Selection of technical component suppliers 
Once the technical architecture has been constructed the different compo-
nents have to be chosen. Decisions have to be made as to which compo-
nents to use and where to get them. What components are in-house and 
what need to be bought? This has to be discussed and negotiated with pos-
sible suppliers. These suppliers might become part of the value network and 
of the team designing the new mobile information service. Components 
have to be integrated to deliver mobile information services that take care of 
the following. 
x
End-to-end security: Depending on the security required for the service 
concept it might be a problem if end-to-end security is not available. 
This is for example a problem in architectures based on WAP.  
x
Authentication, authorisation and access: one-time password authentica-
tion is one of the desired features for mobile phone customers as per-
sonalisation further develops (Salonen & Karjalainen, 2003). This is not 
just for security reasons; it is also to facilitate customers by making the 
use of mobile services easier. This requires a high level of coordination 
between the different players in the mobile field. 
x
Personalisation and profiling; customer profiles are nothing more than a 
database of information with defined fields (Hagel III & Singer, 1999)4.
A profile system allows you to personalise services. This often raises 
concern over privacy abuses. One of the challenges in personalisation 
and profiling is to provide a simple method for users to tell service pro-
viders the information they are willing to share, and under which condi-
tions they are willing to share this information (Jagoe, 2003).  
x
Positioning: for location-based services, it must be possible to look up 
and pinpoint a user’s location. Different technological solutions exist 
for positioning. These can be roughly divided between satellite based 
(e.g. GPS), network based (e.g. Cell-ID) and hybrid solutions (e.g. A-
GPS). For indoor solutions technologies like WIFI and Bluetooth can 
provide positioning information based on the nearest send equipment.   
4 (Hagel III & Singer, 1999) provide a method for the user profiling process; 
(Jagoe, 2003) has adapted this for locations based mobile services. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
156
Experiments and pilots with seamless use of those technologies and the 
usage of it has to provide more insight.   
x
Billing; the billing system will be related to the chosen pricing model. 
The current billing systems of operators are mostly designed for post-
pay voice billing, quite straight-forward and leave little room for service 
providers to introduce innovative billing systems. The iMode model is 
one of the first that gives content providers the opportunity to earn 
some revenues. Billing systems should be able to handle pre-pay cus-
tomers, and billing based on number of bytes transferred, URL ac-
cessed, application accessed and even quality of service delivered (Jagoe, 
2003). The first sophisticated billing products that provide for this are 
beginning to appear on the market. 
P.T.3 
Installing platforms 
It is necessary to choose platforms on which to run mobile services. Kala-
kota and Robinson (2002) introduce the following four ‘breakthrough plat-
forms’ for mobile business. 
x
Client-side software platform; consisting of operating systems such as 
Palm, Windows CE and Symbian; and browsers with mark-up languages 
like WML, cHTML, GML and other XML variants. 
x
Device platforms; like cell or mobile phones, smart phones, handheld 
organisers and pagers, specialised industrial handhelds and Pocket PCs 
like the iPAQ of HP™.  
x
Hardware platforms; the business-to-business industry with e.g. micro-
processor and chipset manufacturers. The major challenge is to stan-
dardise the technology. If the mobile service architecture consists of 
interchangeable hardware and software building blocks it will be able to 
support a wide range of services across devices, networks and plat-
forms.
x
Web services platform; runtime environments, to deploy these applica-
tions have to be in place, e.g. JAVA and Microsoft .NET.  
A number of design decisions on these platforms have to be taken be-
fore deciding on an application.    
x
Many tools can be used during this phase, e.g. J2ME technology con-
sisting of a Java virtual machine and a suite of interfaces that are de-
signed to provide customised run-time environments for embedded and 
consumer electronics (Jagoe, 2003, p. 115); location interoperability 
tools 
from 
the 
OMA 
Location 
Working 
Group (www.openmobilealliance.org); end tools from the Platform for 
Privacy Preferences, an emerging industry standard promoted by the 

 
 6 Mobile Service System Design approach 
 
 
 
157
W3C for automating and giving users more control over the use of per-
sonal information at the web sites they visit (www.w3.org/mobile) .
P.T.4 
Application design 
When the decisions regarding the platforms have been made, several people 
may design the various applications. Two standards that provide applica-
tion-level support for wireless networking are mobile IP and Wireless Ap-
plication Protocol (Stallings, 2002). An application server provides a server-
side platform for building and deploying business logic and can provide 
many technical benefits (Jagoe, 2003). The application design depends heav-
ily on the choices made in P.T.1, P.T.2 and P.T.3. This activity is closely 
related to the Service Concept activities P.S.1-4. 
P.S.1 
Content design 
This activity is closely related to the application design and navigation de-
sign. The content depends on what the users will trigger. The term content 
should be understood as referring to text, emails, web pages, graphics, audio 
and video. In this activity the storyboard is further designed to show what 
the service will look like. This design has to be rich and provide a ‘feel-good’ 
impression; the required content is also described in this activity, e.g. the 
geographical information, databases with restaurant information, games, etc.  
QFD is a method that can be used to check whether the content fulfils 
the customer needs. The planning matrix addresses the following questions 
for each customer need: “How important is this need to the customer?’; 
‘How well are we doing in meeting this need today?’; ‘How well is the com-
petition doing in meeting this need today?’ ‘How well do we want to do in 
meeting this need with the product or service being developed?’ and ‘If we 
meet this need well, could we use that fact to help sell the product?’. By fill-
ing in the planning matrix including the goal, improvement ratio, sales point 
and raw weight it is possible to calculate the normalised raw weight with the 
in QFD provided formulas (Cohen, 1995, pp. 92-122). 
P.S.2/P.S.3/P.S.4   Navigation design, User interface design and Tests  
A simplified view of the user-centred design process is to conduct user re-
search, set usability goals, design, model and test the user interface; and 
specify the user interface (Wiklund, 1994). The design, model and test of the 
user interface should be repeated until the user is satisfied. The navigation 
design leads to the application design. The user interface design determines 
the ‘look and feel’ of the service. The designers develop the font, colour, 
icons and text. The underlying process of getting a user interface that is us-
able is a user-centred design process; the targeted user has to be part of the 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
158
whole design approach. ‘Usefulness’ and the ‘Ease of Use’ have to be tested 
by potential users to determine whether the designers are still working ac-
cording the users’ requirements. This is a repetitive activity. The concept 
behind it is to stress that customers and technology-providers jointly ex-
plore the possibilities and constraints of a technology using simulation 
(hands-on experience) and developing scenarios. Test sessions consist of a 
participative evaluation process in which the users actively participate in 
evaluation and defining usability problems. These aspects can be technical, 
i.e. a slow device, but also include aspects such as perceived usefulness, i.e. 
functionality that is not perceived as useful. Different methodologies in us-
ability labs for evaluation may be practiced, including customer field studies, 
competitive analysis, contextual inquiry, surveys, usability focus groups, par-
ticipatory design, exploratory lab studies, expert evaluations, and more. To 
run a usage test you need to organise willing participants, a prototype, a way 
to make the prototype available to participants, mechanisms for collecting 
data and a process for interpreting feedback (Isaacs & Walendowski, 2002). 
This activity can benefit much from modelling methods, e.g. prototyping 
to get hands-on experience and emulation to test the user interface. Test 
and control rooms are handy to use. Interaction design programs like the 
Adobe programmes Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign and Flash (for multi-
media design) can be used to make user interfaces.

Detailed planning of roles, responsibilities and tasks during 
execution 
In the Preparation phase the actors agreed on the role, responsibility and 
task division during the design project. In the Synthesis phase they have to 
decide on these issues for the implementation and test phase. This depends 
heavily on the service life cycle: is this a first prototype test in real life set-
tings, a controlled market introduction for a specified group, or the launch 
in a region?  
The procedure for a first test of the service that will be executed in the 
next phase has to be completely clear to everybody. This includes the test 
scenario; it should be clear which researcher does what, when and how they 
will guarantee that the test results are valid. Workflow models can support 
this. Practical details like detailed planning for providing and receiving the 
equipment, a manual for the users, questionnaires, and contracts, the sup-
port, etc. also have to be planned. Arrangements have to be made for the 
operationalisation of the test. What if a server goes down? What if the net-
work goes down? Who is the first line support for the user? If the service 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
160
will be launched on the market for more than a one-time test period the 
complete operational processes have to be designed.  
S.O.2 
Calculating benefits and costs 
The results of the preparation phase have to provide an overview of the 
service system design, while during the synthesis phase, the system has to be 
built and this costs money. In this phase investments have to be made in the 
network, in hardware and software. In the benefit and cost model the in-
vestment for the next phase, the implementation and test phase, has to be 
calculated. The risk will vary depending on the size of the test group. The 
benefits and the costs will be of a financial and a non-financial nature, for 
example time and reputation.  
S.T.1/S.T.2/S.T.3   Programming, scripting, assembling and testing  
Many books have been written on developing Internet applications (e.g.: 
Ince, 2004). These are also applicable in the mobile field. Concerning a 
value network of various actors that will be located in different places a 
work method is recommended that is suitable in a distributed environment. 
A team of programmers in a distributed environment can do the program-
ming if the software is well tested and documented. In the open source de-
velopment communities, programmers have the adagio ‘code somewhere 
and deploy everywhere’. First the various completed parts have to be tested. 
Emulators might be helpful here. Next the tested parts have to be assem-
bled and the whole system has to be technically tested. The deliverable of 
this activity is labelled a ‘prototype’. How advanced this prototype is de-
pends on the evolutionary stage of the project. Just before the market 
launch the prototype should perform in the test as the final service.  
To prevent a lot of documentation work afterwards tools like Concur-
rent Version Systems (CVS) take care of the documentation during the pro-
gramming work.  
S.S.1 
Decide on service quality and how to manage the market 
communication 
Grönroos (2001) argues that better quality leads to higher customer reten-
tion rates and more profit. The perceived value of the total service offered 
to the customer has to be calculated during the design process. The devel-
opers can calculate the revenue benefit, cost benefit and investment per fea-
ture. The further the service is matured the more detailed the calculations 
will be. Decisions have to be made regarding communication with the users. 
This is crucial for a market launch, and also for prototype test decisions 
which have to be made regarding attracting users and how to communicate 

 
 6 Mobile Service System Design approach 
 
 
 
161
with them. How will the service be branded, priced, etc.? The whole process 
of communication with the (prototype) users has to be managed and this 
can be modelled using the Relationship Dialogue Process Model (Grönroos, 
2001). The gaps in the GAP analysis model to manage service quality can be 
checked to figure out where and how to influence the quality of the deliv-
ered service, (Grönroos, 2001; Tukker & Tischner, 2006; Zeithaml et al., 
2006) and chapter 2). 
S.S.2 
Handling privacy and legal aspects 
Before the implementation starts it is necessary to check whether all legal 
aspects are covered. These range from issues like ‘can you ask a test person 
to be personally liable for a piece of technology if it is stolen?’ to ‘is the mo-
bile information service completely legal?’  As mentioned in chapter 2, pri-
vacy legislation is an issue for mobile information services that needs to be 
carefully checked, especially for location-based services. The privacy of the 
participants has to be taken care of by making sure that they understand 
what data you will collect and how the information will be used (Isaacs & 
Walendowski, 2002). For example the Consent Provider Model can be used 
to manage privacy (Ali Eldin & Wagenaar, 2004).

Preparing the equipment 
Depending on the number of users in the test group this might be a rather 
labour intensive activity. The devices have to be pre-installed; a manual with 
instructions also has to be written. 
I.S.1 
Organising the launch 
The launch might concern a first version or a ready-for-market version of 
the service to the customers. The contact with the customers should be 
carefully managed. Results of former tests form the basis for addressing tar-
get groups and triggering values of the service. Publicity can be organised 
when all involved actors are confident with the outcome of the test users’ 
experiences. 

 
 6 Mobile Service System Design approach 
 
 
 
163
I.S.2 Distribution 
The relationship with the customers starts once the service is distributed. In 
test situations the test subjects will receive the equipment, receive instruc-
tions and have to sign some form of consent regarding participation. This 
activity is related to the marketing of the service. One of the issues, for ex-
ample, is whether the service will be distributed as part of a service bundle. 
This issue becomes more important closer to a mass-market launch.

Analysing the business case  
The business partners then evaluate their benefits from participating in the 
design project. They decide if they are willing to participate in the next 
round. They might use predefined criteria with a ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ character 
to estimate the chances for success. The parameters formulated in P.O.2 
can be validated once again. At this stage the partners can also better judge 
the more ‘soft’ characterised criteria, as mentioned in P.O.3, and answer 
questions like 'Was there a good atmosphere?’ And ‘Are the partners reli-
able?’

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
164
T.T.1 
Support by developers during test 
The application developers can sometimes solve problems that pop up dur-
ing the test. This is also an opportunity to have informal conversations with 
the users and get a better understanding of the usage. 
T.T.2 
Monitor usage and evaluation 
The usage of the network, platform and applications has to be logged. The 
operators can test the load and peak load on the network. The service pro-
viders can use the log files to scale the necessary capacity on the servers. At 
the same time, the usage designers can use these log files to evaluate the 
usage, see T.S.2. Observation is also important for evaluation. Questions 
that are important to answer for the evaluation of the technology are: 
x
Is the technology reliable, robust and scalable? 
x
In what phase of the innovation life cycle is the deployed technology? 
In other words, Is there an expectation that the technology will become 
obsolete in the near future? 
T.S.1 
Gathering user experiences 
Data collection begins at the first moment the users start to use the service. 
The use of a combination of multiple sources to get good feedback on the 
usefulness and usability of the service is recommended. Questions that need 
to be answered are: ‘what are the users willing to pay for the service?’, ‘is the 
service evaluated as useful and easy-to-use by the targeted users?’ and: ‘is it 
clear who the target group is and what the size of this target group is?’ As 
mentioned, lessons from case studies, pilots and free connection plans allow 
customers to explore the services and help companies to find answers to 
these questions. 
There are many methods and tools that can be used to gather user ex-
periences. Examples are the planning matrix of QFD, (see P.S.1.), logging 
user activity, formal observation and videotaping, informal observation and 
conversation, surveys. (Isaacs & Walendowski, 2002, pp. 243-273) also pro-
vide a good overview for this.  
6.3
Next phases 
The design approach can be reiterated after a first round has been com-
pleted and a test group has used the service. In the second round some ac-
tivities may be modified and might be done more quickly. After each round 
the service can be distributed towards a larger test group. After two or three 
rounds the object of the approach will be the market launch and the start of 

 
 6 Mobile Service System Design approach 
 
 
 
165
exploitation. In the last round before exploitation more emphasis should be 
placed on the business model of the service and the business cases for the 
various partners. Exploitation might start with only a small part of the target 
group. After the first real market experience more market exposure risk can 
be taken. The number of necessary rounds will vary per situation.  
Figure 6-7 Design approach spiral 
The whole design approach spiral is presented in Figure 6-7. The light 
bulb is used to denote that the whole process has to start with radical and 
lateral thinking. Iterative design steps should be taken within each round; 
and after each round follows an incremental step towards the next round. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
166
The described design approach can be modified and extended in all di-
rections: technical details, usability aspects, distribution, marketing, social 
interaction, etceteras, etceteras. Designing service systems is a multidiscipli-
nary and complex process. The approach described in this chapter can be 
used as kind of checklist. In next chapter the experience of applying this 
design approach in a first round in an action research case is described.

Case: MIES on the campus 
This case describes the experience of applying the design approach ex-
plained in the previous chapter.  The occasion was that Delft University of 
Technology and the mobile operator T-Mobile organised a UMTS test-bed 
at Delft, in the Netherlands. A mobile information service system for cam-
pus visitors, called ‘MIES on the campus’, was designed in one of the pro-
jects on this test-bed. The service system consist of a service concept, 
technological architecture and organisational network. The service concept 
was based on storylines derived from brainstorm sessions with users. The 
available technical building blocks were a UMTS network in a test-bed set-
ting, servers, a UMTS phone; a PDA including a navigation application; and 
a GPS receiver. The organisational network consisted of a mobile operator, 
an IT firm, content providers, game developer, a navigation software sup-
plier and developers from the university. Together they designed, built, im-
plemented and tested ‘MIES on the campus’. 
7.1
Background
The Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM) within Delft 
University of Technology (TU Delft) is concerned with complex techno-
logical systems which function within a socio-economic context 
(www.tbm.tudelft.nl). The Faculty develops interdisciplinary theories, meth-
ods and tools to address technologically complex problems. One of the re-
search themes is concerned with the design and evaluation of innovative 
service concepts; the focus being on services which have been made possi-
ble by ICT and that are designed in a multi-actor context. The mobile ser-
vice field is one of the domains in which the researchers apply their 
research. These researchers were interested in opportunities for cooperating 
with industry to apply and test the design methods and tools they had de-
veloped.
In particular, the mobile telecommunications industry is interesting since 
it is searching for new services, not only to regain its investments in licenses 
but also to stay competitive in the future. The industry is undergoing a radi-
cal transformation and organisations in the mobile telecommunications, in-
formation technology and media sector are becoming increasingly 
interdependent. Organisations have to collaborate in complex networks to 
create new mobile information services. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
168
These first years of the 2nd millennium, mobile operators are working 
hard on their plans to roll out the third generation mobile network accord-
ing to the European standard: Universal Mobile Telecommunication System 
(UMTS). In 2002, mobile telecommunication operators started to make 
plans for pilots to investigate all user and technology issues related to 
UMTS. This system provides broadband mobile connectivity Europe-wide. 
In 2003, manufacturers were delivering the first network systems and termi-
nals were appearing slowly on the market. However, the new services that 
had to be delivered, were - and still are - in the development stage. One of 
the five Dutch mobile operators, T-Mobile, approached Delft University of 
Technology to exploit a UMTS test bed at the university.  
The UMTS test-bed initiative allowed researchers to design an advanced 
mobile service system. A test-bed can deliver valuable information about the 
users experience of intended services. This also concerns the new terminals 
that can be used with UMTS. A university campus environment with stu-
dents and staff members can deliver important inputs for the further design 
of the services and terminals. The campus environment can be seen as a 
breeding place for ideas for new services generated by the creativity of cam-
pus users. 
One of the working packages on the test-bed was the project ‘MIES on 
the campus’. MIES is an acronym for Mobile Information and Entertainment 
Services. The service ‘MIES on the campus’ used the features as offered by 
UMTS, for T-Mobile the purpose of the UMTS test-bed was to show the 
public the advantages of UMTS. For the university, the focus of the project 
was on concept exploration, prototyping and testing of innovative services 
on this new broadband wireless infrastructure UMTS. The specific purpose 
of the ‘MIES on the campus’ project was to apply a developed design ap-
proach that focused on the value network issues: how to create a value net-
work of actors and how to coordinate the activities between those actors.  
The challenges of the project were to develop and test a mobile informa-
tion service system that fulfilled the following criteria. 
 To provide a mobile information service that is useful and usable. For 
mobile services this is based on needs and the service must be usable in a 
setting where the situation of the user is critical concerning location and 
timing (Anckar & D'Incau, 2002; Baldi & Pyu-Pyu Thaung, 2002).  
 To provide an innovative service. The innovativeness of a service can 
either be related to the technology used, target group in relation to con-
text, the business model used or new service features/applications.  

 
 
7 Case: MIES on the Campus 
 
 
 
169
 To provide a service system that makes use of existing building blocks as 
much as possible. This meant that the application should consist of 
available building blocks with only some programming to assemble the 
building blocks. The reason for this is that the research should be fo-
cused on service design and not on the design of technical components.  
 The last criterion concerns the multi actor environment. The service sys-
tem had to be developed in a value network with various actors who ful-
filled the roles of the mobile operator, service provider, application 
developer, content developer(s), hard and software suppliers etcetera.  
This situation reflects the reality and fits into the long term multi-actor 
research programme within the Faculty of TPM.  
 Furthermore, the aim of the project was to develop a service in a rela-
tively short period of time. Arrangements for the UMTS network oc-
curred during the autumn of 2002 and the spring of 2003 and the 
network was operational in June of 2003. The time available to develop 
the ‘MIES on the campus’ service on the network was less than five 
months (May, June, September, October in 2003; hardly any work was 
done in the holiday months July and August). The operation of the test-
bed network benefited from the experience of the T-Mobile staff with 
their own test-bed in their local office.  
The ‘MIES on the campus’ project started in April 2003 and the project 
was divided into five phases: analysis (April-August 2003), preparation (Au-
gust-October 2003), synthesis (October 2003), implementation & test (Oc-
tober-December 2003). The outcome of the design activities for the 
organisational network, technical architecture and service concept respec-
tively are described below.  
7.2
Analysis phase 
In the analysis phase the rough outline of the value network of actors be-
came apparent, there will be an overview of the technical options and there 
would be an idea of the service concept.  
7.2.1
Analysis phase - Organisational network 
Below the backgrounds of the most important partners in this network are 
further described. Founded in 1842, Delft University of Technology is the oldest, 
largest, and most comprehensive technical university in The Netherlands. 
With over 13,000 students and 2,100 scientists (including 200 professors), it 
is an establishment of both national importance and significant international 
standing (www.tudelft.nl). The Faculty of Technology, Policy and Manage-

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
170
ment is the youngest faculty of the university. The focus of the research and 
education of the Faculty of TPM are problems with technical aspects as well 
as 
organisational, 
administrative, 
economic 
or 
legal 
aspects 
(www.tbm.tudelft.nl). The faculty cooperates closely with business and gov-
ernment organisations in research centres and research projects to solve 
social and corporate problems. The TPM researchers involved in this re-
search project are part of a research programme in which theories, methods, 
and tools to support design and evaluation of (distributed) organisations, 
processes and policy in the services sector are being developed. Further-
more, two other faculties were involved, one to provide knowledge on 
product design, usability, and ergonomics and another for their knowledge 
on GIS and GPS.  
T-Mobile Netherlands provides mobile telecommunication solutions to 2 
million active customers in the Netherlands (January 2004). T-Mobile Inter-
national is the shareholder (100% subsidiary of Deutsch Telekom). T-
Mobile and the other branches of Deutsche Telekom serve a large number 
of customers worldwide, about 80 million (www.t-mobile.nl). T-Mobile in 
the Netherlands had a special group of people assigned to prepare the 
UMTS launch.  
Another important partner in the project was Delft Plaza, this is a local 
content provider who maintains a website with all local information on 
events, shops, restaurants, etcetera (www.delftplaza.nl; in Dutch).  
Ex Machina is an independent, Amsterdam, Netherlands based developer 
of games. Ex Machina has enabled successful multiplayer games for Web 
and Mobile since 1998, with millions of games played. All their work is 
based on their unique multiplayer technology Deus+ (www.exmachina.nl). 
Another application and content provider in the project was AtoBe. This 
firm makes web enabled applications available on all current and future mo-
bile devices, browsers and technologies (www.atobe.nl). Their role was fo-
cussed on video applications in the project.  
The Vision Web is a consulting firm with about 400 consultants and deliv-
ers ICT solutions to their customers. A group of consultants specialised in 
IT architecture was involved in this project (www.thevisionweb.com).  
A set of standard roles related to mobile services was used to search for 
actors to build MIES (see chapter 4). Embedded relational ties were without 
doubt a very important factor in the network formation. Everyone involved 
in the project knew at least on other person involved in the project, as a 
teacher, (former) colleague, business partner or personally. T-Mobile was 
already involved because they had already worked on the initiative of UMTS 

 
 
7 Case: MIES on the Campus 
 
 
 
171
test-bed at the campus with colleagues from Delft University of Technol-
ogy. T-Mobile was also the connection to the handset suppliers and video 
application provider. A content provider offering local content on Delft and 
a multi-user game developer were found via the personal relationships of 
researchers at the TPM faculty. The IT organisation was a former employer 
of the researcher. Expertise of researchers of other faculties at the large 
Delft University of Technology was determined via personal relationships. 
Only TomTom was chosen for experience with their product, at the start of 
the project nobody knew anybody in the company personally. This influ-
enced the cooperation with them, there was only contact a few times by 
phone and email and they did not really participate in the design project. 
For the test-bed project more companies were contacted than those that 
actually participated. The reasons chose not to participate with more com-
panies were: not enough time to get familiar with the technology, nobody 
had experience of the company and they asked too much money, or simply 
nobody got in touch with them.  
The network was recognisable as an exploration network with high 
trust/openness and low control (Nooteboom & Gilsing, 2004). None of the 
actors asked for a letter of intention during the network creation phase.  
7.2.2
Analysis phase - Technological architecture 
T-Mobile provided the conditions and determined what technologies could 
be used regarding the network and the handset. As a pre-commercial im-
plementation, the test-bed network represents a particular incarnation of the 
UMTS technology and as such presents a platform with unique features and 
functions.  
The UMTS network test-bed was built to be partially integrated into the 
existing T-Mobile GSM network. The way this network has been set up 
means that no phone calls can be made to the GSM network from the test-
bed in Delft (and also not to the fixed PSTN network as this is also linked 
to the GSM network) but data transfer is possible to and from the Internet, 
and GPRS could be used, provided the mobile phone supports an appropri-
ate browser. As the WAP gateway is also located within the GSM network, 
WAP services also cannot be used. 
It was a difficult task to figure out what the best technological solution 
was for localisation. The choice was made for GPS since Cell ID was not 
available. Another decision that had to be made was the choice between a 
client or server based application. A big advantage for a server-based solu-
tion is that the information can always be updated, e.g. information on 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
172
roadworks provided as and when necessary. A disadvantage is that the user 
always has to go online via the mobile network, which costs money, can 
cost extra time and has a chance of failure.  
Figure 7-1. Chosen handsets 
It was a time consuming task to figure out a good combination of hand-
sets and the UMTS network. The starting point was to determine what was 
available on the market. E.g. a UMTS phone with integrated GPS was not 
available. The UMTS phone Nokia 6650, the iPAQ2210 and a GPS receiver 
were the devices chosen to enable the service. The connection between the 
Nokia and the iPAQ was via Bluetooth. The GPS receiver was a Compact-
Flash card that fits the iPAQ, see Figure 7-1. 
7.2.3
Analysis phase - Service Concept 
One of the dilemma’s in the ‘service concept – technology’ trade-off is that 
there is no known demand profile for services based on new technologies 
like UMTS; there is no history of use and no customer experience base and 
reliable survey data to draw on. You also cannot ask customers what they 
want if they have no idea of what you are talking about. One way to solve 
this problem is to start with the context of the user.  
The ‘MIES on the campus’ project started with brainstorm sessions sup-
ported by Group Support Systems (GSS) with visitors to the campus to find 
out about problems they encountered when they visited Delft. Three differ-
ent groups of participants, being foreign academics, Dutch academics and

Dutch practitioners were defined and a GSS session was held with each 
group. In a structured way the target groups provided information on the 
problems they encountered when visiting the campus (for a detailed descrip-
tion of these sessions see Den Hengst et al., 2004). The result of the selec-
tion of the most important problems is shown in Table 7-1.

Based on the results of the sessions storylines were developed as input 
for the service descriptions. 
Seven storylines were formulated based on the outcome of the GSS ses-
sions. To make the storylines realistic a situation was based on a fictitious 
person. This description was as follows.   
‘A researcher, ‘Mabel Jones’ from Great Britain visits the conference on 
simulation from 26-29 October 2003 in Delft. Mabel arrives on the 25th 
of October at hotel Dish in Delft and receives a package at the reception 
desk with a UMTS device, iPAQ and GPS receiver that together provide 
the ‘MIES on the campus’ package.’ 

Designing Mobile Service Systems

Storyline 1: find the conference venue 
The next day, Mabel reads the instructions and starts us-
ing MIES to work out where she is, where the conference 
location is and how to get there. She could walk, take a taxi 
or go by public transport. The answer is that it is a 10 min-
utes walk. So she starts walking using the handheld device to 
help her find the route. She finds her way easily. 
 Storyline 2: find the right session 
Mabel arrives at the venue and registers. She can 
choose between three parallel sessions that start in 15 
minutes. Two of them are relevant for her. Mabel uses 
MIES to download the abstracts of the papers from the 
two relevant sessions and she makes a choice. She decides 
to plan the rest of the sessions she wants to attend later. 
During the morning session she receives an update of the 
programme. One session is cancelled; another one delayed and there is an-
other keynote speaker.  
Storyline 3: find the right people 
The morning sessions are over and lunch starts. Mabel 
wants to find some people who are involved in the same 
research issues as she is. She starts MIES ‘getting in 
touch’ module and searches for people based on key 
words she enters in the search fields. She receives pictures 
and descriptions of people that match her request. She 
recognises Juan Gonzales from Spain and sends him a 
message inviting him to sit next to her at lunch. The 
lunch is held at the conference venue and Juan and Mabel 
have an interesting talk during lunch. They exchange business cards via their 
devices.
 Storyline 4: find a nice restaurant 
The first day there is no dinner organised by the con-
ference committee. Mabel and some other conference 
visitors decide to go into Delft to have dinner.  They 
search with the help of MIES for a nice restaurant. They 
want an informal restaurant with a reasonably priced 
menu in the centre of Delft. They can choose between

several places, one of them has a webcam and they can have a look at the 
actual situation at that time in that place. They decide to go there and call 
the restaurant to make a reservation.  MIES advises them to take the bus to 
the restaurant and MIES provides them with the bus number, where and at 
what time the bus departs and how to get to the bus stop.  
 Storyline 5: tour through the campus 
The second day in the afternoon there is no session 
that Mabel and Juan like and they decide to explore the 
TU Delft campus. The MIES service has a tour that guides 
them through the campus and that provides interesting 
information on the buildings, e.g. about the library and 
faculty buildings; where famous professors work and their 
research fields; the current courses available at the univer-
sity; and they find they can download a preview of a lec-
ture from a professor they know. Practical information 
such as where the coffee machines are, copiers, ATM's and lunch facilities is 
also available. 
Storyline 6: more time to kill 
They end the tour and still have some time to kill be-
fore the official conference gala dinner. They decide to 
play some multi user games on the mobile. Then they re-
ceive a message that there is an extra social meeting at 
Speakers, a big pub/dance venue downtown, which they 
can attend along with people from the conference. They 
take a look at the situation via a webcam in Speakers, and 
they see what appears to be a good party. They decide to go there and get 
directions via MIES.  
Storyline 7: appointment info 
Next day the conference is over but Mabel has an ap-
pointment with an assistant professor at the Faculty of 
TPM. The appointment is at 09:00 o’clock.  Mabel is late 
because she slept through the alarm (due to the party the 
night before?). She phones a taxi and sends a message to 
her appointment that she is late. In the taxi she has a quick 
look at the profile of the person she will visit. Thanks to 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
176
MIES she can easily find the room in the TPM building where the meeting 
is. She recognises the person from having seen her picture on MIES. 
7.3
Preparation phase 
In the preparation phase the organisational network becomes established, 
the functional and technical design will be made and there will be a detailed 
service description.  
7.3.1
Preparation phase - Organisational network 
In this phase the final value network creation was finished, the result is 
shown in Figure 7-2. 
Figure 7-2. MIES value network 
At the start of this phase the project initiator of the university organised 
a launch meeting, including drinks afterwards, with all involved actors. They 
told their background and plans and hopes for the project. Researchers of 
the Faculty of TPM presented the first ideas for solutions. As shown in 
Figure 7-2 many roles were provided by this organisation. A consultant 
from The Vision Web, an IT architect, was appointed technical project 
leader. He organised a meeting every week and made minutes providing ac-

tion points for all these meetings. Two application programmers of The Vi-
sion Web later contributed to the programming work that had to be done. 
Ex Machina had developed a multi-user game on GPRS and wanted to test 
this for UMTS. They hired a student to do this as a study project. Delft 
Plaza is the local content provider in Delft and maintains a website for in-
habitants and tourists. Their business model is that they are paid by shops 
etc. for the companies to be mentioned on the Internet. They considered 
offering their content on the Mobile Internet to be a good extension of 
their business. This project was a good experiment to start to gain experi-
ence. T-Mobile offered the UMTS network in the overall UMTS test-bed 
project of which ‘MIES on the campus’ was a sub-project. In this sub-project 
T-Mobile’s role mainly dealt with choosing and arranging for availability of 
handsets and keeping the network ‘in the air’ during the experiments. T-
Mobile was also the actor who brought in AtoBe to test video applications 
in the project since video applications are suitable for testing the specific 
features of UMTS such as speed. The navigation programme of TomTom 
was first just bought at the shop but when it became clear that licenses were 
necessary for all the iPAQs the firm was approached and asked whether 
they could sponsor these software packages, and they did. The faculty of 
industrial design participated in the navigation and user interface design. 
Two students worked on this as a study project under the supervision of an 
associate professor. They collaborated intensively with programmers of 
Delft Plaza who had to convert their Internet content to the mobile Inter-
net. Geodesy researchers were involved in providing knowledge on GIS and 
GPS conversion.

7.3.2
Preparation phase - Technical Architecture 
The functions of MIES are ordered in a Presentation-Logic-Data architec-
ture, see
Figure 7-3. This overview was made as a start for the technical design of the 
MIES service. The presentation layer is on the client side (plain); the data is 
on the server site (dots) with the exception of the TomTom maps that are 
on the client site. Satellites provide the GPS data and these data are con-
verted by a script to GIS coordinates. This is further explained below re-
garding localisation. The logic layer (stripes) describes the actions between 
the client and the server. Again, the logic that is only related to TomTom is 
completely on the client site (plain). The data layer was extended with con-
tent from other content providers who joined the MIES portal later, e.g. the 
video clips of AtoBe. This layer can be extended indefinitely.  
Figure 7-3. Presentation-Logic-Data architecture 
Besides the Presentation-Logic-Data architecture a Technical Architec-
ture was also made, see Figure 7-4. This technical Architecture consists of 
the following building blocks. 
The UMTS network. Due to its higher bandwidth than GPRS, and also 
GSM on which it is based, the UMTS network is a 3G broadband packet-
based transmission of text, digitised voice, video and multimedia at data 
rates up to 2 Megabits/second theoretically; in practice the maximum is 
much lower.   

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
182
The Internet. The Internet fulfilled a central role in MIES: all informa-
tion to be retrieved through the MIES portal was requested and provided 
via the Internet.   
Content. Multiple content providers made their content available for the 
MIES portal via a connection from their private network (via a firewall) to 
the Internet. Of course, this required the right configuration of various net-
work equipment, e.g. routers, firewall, at the content provider’s network and 
the telecom provider’s network. 
The MIES technical architecture is flexible: new content providers can 
be added to the web portal, they can be “clicked into the value network” 
easily.
MIES enabled users to find another person (finding people) and to find 
buildings (finding a restaurant). For both of these functions the users had to 
know what their current position was and receive the requested location. A 
client-based solution was chosen for the location-based function to MIES 
users. There were more standard components available for this and the 
TomTom Navigator, a standard navigation package for iPAQ users, was 
chosen. The maps are all stored locally on the iPAQ.  
Figure 7-4: Technical architecture 

 
 
7 Case: MIES on the Campus 
 
 
 
183
7.3.3
Preparation phase - Service Concept 
Based on the storylines and the available raw content, user interface design-
ers made the navigation structure and user interface for MIES. Websites for 
tourists, e.g. of London and Rotterdam, were also checked. The design was 
made in a few iterations, where users provided feedback between results. 
Two user test sessions with three test persons each session took place. The 
first session was a user studio session with three test persons taking around 
30 minutes for each test. This was the first test to get feedback on the navi-
gation structure after two weeks of designing. The pictures in Figure 7-5 
illustrate the project’s usage studio session.  
A few weeks after the studio sessions the second user test session, a field 
test with three different test persons, was held. For this test all content was 
available and the test persons walked outside so that the designers could 
observe ‘MIES on the campus’ being used in the field. 
7.4
Synthesis phase 
In the synthesis phase the service system is actual built. The focus of the 
activities is the technical architecture. The involved actors prepare them-
selves for the implementation phase by defining activities, roles and prepar-
ing decisions on the marketing aspects of the service concept. Users are not 
involved in this phase of the design process. 
7.4.1
Synthesis phase - Organisational network 
During the synthesis phase of the project, the interdependency of the tech-
nology and the value network became very clear. Some of the programmers 
wanted to program in Java, some in PHP and some in ASP. In the end 
some actors programmed a part of MIES in PHP and other actors another 
part of MIES in ASP. This was not the preferred choice, however consider-
Figure 7-5. Control-room and Test-room 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
184
ing the available resources this was the best available in the allocated time 
span. The consequence of this was that two servers were needed; a UNIX 
and a Windows environment, and two similar templates had to be made. In 
the second version of MIES for the student test it was decided to program 
everything in PHP. This meant that the ASP partner left the project.    
Ex Machina worked stand-alone. This was not a problem for the service 
since the game was a client side solution on the Nokia but this situation was 
not so nice for the programmer. This was a student who wanted to learn 
from the project and as such was hindered since there was not much col-
laboration with him.  
People worked under time pressure in this synthesis phase and it was 
very hectic trying to get the designed service ready in time. For example, T-
mobile ordered 20 iPAQs but somehow the order did not come through. 
One day before the implementation was supposed to start project members 
drove to a shop with enough stock and bought the iPAQs. None of the ac-
tors bothered about calculating benefits and costs because everybody’s fo-
cus was on realising the service.  
7.4.2
Synthesis phase - Technical Architecture 
Various programmers from different organisations worked on the pro-
gramming of the functionalities. The functionalities related to finding peo-
ple and finding buildings were supported by the Mobile Position Updater 
(MPU). For this, a PhD student formulated requirements for the following 
functionalities: user authentication, look and feel management, separation of 
the business logic from the look and feel by means of templates and 
MySQL database connection. 
The MPU is a programme written in Embedded Visual Basic that runs 
on an iPAQ pocket PC. The programme name is “MIES Position Up-
dater.vb”. The following software had to be installed on the iPAQ: the eVB 
Runtime, TomTom activeX control and the programme file to run it. The 
MPU fulfilled two functions: (1) send the current GPS location of the iPAQ 
to a web server, and receive a (latitude, longitude) position from the web 
server in return and (2) when the web server returned a position the Tom-
Tom Navigator map-view had to show the (latitude, longitude) location on 
the screen. The setting screen and the information flow between the iPAQ 
and the web server for finding a person are shown in Figure 7-6.  

 
 
7 Case: MIES on the Campus 
 
 
 
185
Figure 7-6. MPU setting screen and locating persons information flows 
The same principle as shown in Figure 9-6 was used for locating build-
ings. The difference was that the information on these buildings is held in a 
database. The database of Delft Plaza is the information on restaurants in-
cluding the XY coordinates according to the GIS standard. This GIS infor-
mation had to be converted to the GPS standards longitudes and latitudes 
so that the MIES Position Updater could request the map in the TomTom 
navigators.  
The PHP scripting was implemented in the following WebPages ‘Login 
screen’, ‘Main page’, ‘Finding other user’s locations’ and ‘Chat’. The vAu-
thenticate system was downloaded and used for user authentication. This is 
a ready-to-use user management system that supports a number of levels. 
Furthermore it comes with some code to check user permissions for every 
page that has to be protected. User data on the client side is stored in cook-
ies. These PHP scripts were assembled using the PHP scripting of Delft 
Plaza that made their content available for the iPAQ. The Vision Web 
worked on an ASP application for the personal settings. This was a stand-
alone solution that also was stored on another server. The multi-user game 
Razor was programmed standalone for the client side, the Nokia.  
7.4.3
Synthesis phase - Service Concept 
The following service applications were developed based on the storylines 
and using the available building blocks and resources.  
Goal 1: Finding locations. This functionality was supported by a navigation 
programme, called TomTom, that runs on the iPAQ. The GPS knows the 
location of the user and the user can insert the address he or she wants to 
go to and TomTom will then show the route. The locations relevant to the 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
186
conference visitors were pre-installed as favourites in the TomTom pro-
gramme. Since GPS does not work within buildings it is not possible to 
guide users once inside buildings.  
Goal 2: Update of the conference programme. There was up-to-date information 
about the conference programme provided via the Internet on the ‘MIES on 
the campus’ PDA pages. There was also a function to alert people to impor-
tant information. 
Goal 3: Finding people who ‘match’. People could search for other people 
who share the same interest, research field or speak the same language. In 
the first prototype of the service, users were able to search for other sub-
scribed users only, while in the second prototype, they could search for 
other subscribed users and send messages. A privacy control functionality 
was embedded in this service (see Ali Eldin & Wagenaar, 2004).  
Goal 4: Finding a nice restaurant. If you are in a strange environment you 
need help to find restaurants, shops, hotels etc.. A selection of information 
that was already in the database with local content of an Internet content 
provider, and all that was relevant for conference visitors, was translated 
into English and formatted into the right format for the ‘MIES on the campus’ 
PDA pages; including search functions, information and pictures of the res-
taurants and the locations. The MPU script took care of providing the re-
quested location to the user.  
Goal 5: Killing time: playing games. Mobile games are played on mobile 
phones and not on PDAs. Part of the MIES project was a multi-user game 
called Razor. It was not interesting for a game developer to invest time in 
developing a game for the PDA. Thus, Razor ran on the UMTS phone in-
stead of on the iPAQ. Users anywhere on the campus could race against 
each other. The game was already available on GPRS and was adapted for 
UMTS. The advantage of UMTS for multi-user games is the improvement 
of the latency. This is more important than the availability of more band-
width.
Goal 6: Guided campus tour.  The guided campus tour consisted of infor-
mation about the buildings of TU Delft presented on the ‘MIES on the cam-
pus’ PDA pages. Part of the information was instructions on how to walk 
round the campus to view the various buildings. This could also be viewed 
using the TomTom navigation programme. A Delft city tour was also de-
veloped in addition to the campus tour.  
Goal 7: Being on time at the right place for an appointment. Address information 
including phone numbers and room numbers of TU Delft employees were 
obtainable on the iPAQ via the LDAP server of TU Delft. However, it was 

 
 
7 Case: MIES on the Campus 
 
 
 
187
not feasible to give direct access to the agenda of the people. Thus this 
storyline was only partly executed. In Figure 9-2 an example is given for one 
of the TU Delft paths in which MIES users could find information about 
TU Delft on people, locations, facilities and transport.  
Figure 7-7. ‘MIES on the campus’ screen dumps – example path of TU Delft submenu 
7.5
Implementation and test phase 
At the end of the implementation and test phase the results on the design of 
the organisational network, technical architecture and service concept are 
evaluated. Measuring tools are important. Implementation and test took 
place very iteratively and is described together.   
7.5.1
Implementation and test phase - Organisational network 
In this phase the relationships between the actors were established. The 
partners evaluated the benefits and costs from participating in the design 
project. The benefits are mentioned in the test results (section 7.6). The 
partners did not make the analysis of the business cases separately. Theo-
retically the initiator did make a start with looking at the revenue model for 
the service.  
7.5.2
Implementation and test phase - Technical Architecture 
In the implementation phase, two people dealt with the pre-installing of the 
test equipment and wrote the manual. This was done interactively so the 
manual text could be checked for accuracy. This took two people about a 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
188
week. Then, the applications had to be installed on the iPAQs and the 
Nokia’s; the three devices had to be connected and tested; all the terminals 
had to be put in special bags and the manual had to be added. This was a 
very labour intensive task that had to be done precisely. Four student assis-
tants spent an entire day on this for 18 sets, see Figure 7-8.  
Figure 7-8. Pre-installing the equipment 
During the tests there was a first line and a second line help function in 
place. Sometimes the test persons needed help with the software settings 
etc.
7.5.3
Implementation and test phase - Service Concept 
With regard to the user test the decisions were made to test the service us-
ing attendees to a technically oriented conference. The test persons did not 
have to pay for the service. They only had to sign a contract in which it was 
stated that they should take good care of the equipment. They would not be 
liable for any equipment damage that was not the test person’s fault.  
The prototype test was organised during the 15th European Simulation 
Symposium (ESS) in Delft and symposium attendees were asked to use and 
test the MIES service for three days. The ESS conference is a conference on 
simulation and all the attendees were researchers in this field and can thus 
be considered to be early technology adapters. This was a good group of 
people for a prototype test. The 15 test persons came from all over the 
world, had different ages and were mainly male.  
After analysing the results from the first test round the initiator wanted 
more data.  Therefore, a second test round was organised. Master students 
taking a course on Service System Engineering performed the second test. 
One of the assignments in this course is to design a service. Testing MIES 
for a week allowed the students to experience the complexity of putting 
ideas into practice.

Test results 
The findings can be divided into the results of the user tests and the results 
of the partners’ experiences.  
7.6.1
User tests results 
The extent to which the test persons felt MIES was useful is shown in Table 
7-4 on a scale of 1 to 7. Note that ‘7’ means that they strongly agree that it is 
useful. The first round test persons gave a 5.4 for usefulness; this is good 
since it is more than the neutral 4.

Table 7-4 shows that the first round test persons answered all service 
performance parameters positively, meaning better than the neutral 4. This 
was not the result of the second round test group. There is a big difference 
in the results between the groups regarding the usefulness of the service. 
The fact that the first group was the real target group (conference visitors) 
and the second group was not (the students) seems to have had a big impact 
on the usefulness judgment.  
Besides the more general service performance, the test persons were also 
asked to give their opinion on specific MIES functions. The users’ opinions 
on specific MIES functions are shown in Table 7-5.  
In the second test round more questions on specific functions were 
asked. It shows that some items were given a negative answer by the test 
persons; finding an employee, the Delft City Tour and Chatting all had a 
mean below 4.

The test persons were asked, using open questions, to say what their fa-
vourite MIES function was and what function(s) they missed. Favourite 
functions of both groups were access to the Internet and the ability of find 
locations with the navigation programme. The conference visitors also men-
tioned as a favourite the up to date conference information while the stu-
dents liked the chat function. Functions mentioned that could be improved 
were the automatic functioning of the login settings and the MIES position 
updater, the integration of the Internet browser and the navigation pro-
gramme, the possibility to update personal information for example to per-
sonalise the conference schedule, content richness for example on health 
care and museums. Some recommendations to improve the navigation were 
also provided.  
The general impression is that the test persons were quite positive about 
MIES. Despite the fact that there were some technical problems, not all the 
features worked as well as they were intended to and the test persons had to 
carry a bag with the devices and chargers, the users loved playing with the 
equipment; the possibility to access the Internet anyplace, anytime especially 
was consistently mentioned as a good functionality. The TomTom navigator 
was found to be a favourite function; this was a surprise since the pro-
gramme needs some time to get to know it.

Partners’ experiences 
The results of the interviews with 12 partners and participant-observation 
provided information to gain an understanding of the partner’s point of 
view regarding the value network related issues. It was evident that there 
should be a win-win situation for all participants. In the long run this win 
has to be expressed in a financial way. In the short term value is gained 
from improving actors’ image and gaining experience. One respondent re-
marked that there are partners with an established reputation, but that this 
might be a reputation with which you do not want to be associated. E.g. 
when a small company wants to establish an innovative, entrepreneurial im-
age, it might not want to be associated with a (large) firm with an estab-
lished but conservative image. All the firms involved were asked what the 
benefit was for them to participate. In the short term earning revenues was 
not an option for any of the partners since they were not paid and a market 
launch was not planned. Nevertheless they saw other benefits that made 
them decide to participate. The research opportunities were the major rea-
son for the research organisations. Reasons such as getting experience, im-
age and thus revenues in the long run were important for the corporate 
partners. An important reason to participate for the consultancy firm The 
Vision Web was that T-Mobile is one of their most important customers. 
Reasons to participate for the partners from the TU Delft  were mainly re-
search opportunities and chances to learn, gain experience, and also – to 
some extent – to build a reputation.  
The involved partners strongly agreed that it is important to reduce un-
certainty when creating a value network by using embedded relational ties. 
They argued that especially in innovative projects under time pressure it is 
important to know the right people if you are searching for some knowl-
edge.
In Table 7-6 is described to what extent the planned design activities 
were executed satisfactorily, not executed satisfactorily or were not executed 
at all.

The actors’ scope rested heavily on the 
embedded relational ties. Remarks for 
organising the project management:

keep track of design decisions made, 
make them explicit and communicate 
them to all involved actors

Besides agreeing on participation it is 
already necessary in this phase to make 
clear who is going to communicate what 
externally, to the press etc. The mobile

Not
explicitly 
enough
The storylines were not specific enough 
as a basis for functional requirements. 
One of the important lessons learnt is 
that the functional requirements should 
have been clearer. One supplier men-
tioned that technical requirements are 
not formulated in projects under time 
pressure. He advocated that the only 
thing that counts is to make it work and 
people use the trial and error method.

User requirement

Yes 
A very important activity. This activity 
was academically very interesting; we 
published a paper on this activity and 
got ideas for further work.   
A remark on activity A.S.1 was that us-
ers should get feedback on what is done 
with the outcome of the GDR sessions. 
Asking for feedback on design decisions 
for users would do this. This should be 
added as a process control activity.

Shared require-
ment session 
Yes/No 
A launch meeting to get to know each 
other is important. We organised such a 
meeting with drinks. The planned col-
laborative service design session with 
partners was not executed. One of the 
partners mentioned that he would have 
liked a GDR session as done with the 
users but then with all the partners. This 
confirms that activity P.O.1 including a 
collaborative service design session 
should have taken place. 
P.O.2 
Business case for 
each partner 
Yes/No 
The partners did this more implicitly. 
All had their own reasons to participate. 
T-mobile had a planned budget for the 
whole UMTS test-bed. The investments 
of the other partners were relatively low 
and they decided to spend time or 
money when a decision had to be made.

and tasks 
Yes/No 
The project initiator took care of the 
coordination of the activities to keep the 
network intact. This also included social 
activities like a launch meeting and a 
dinner at the end. The governance 
model to manage the content providers 
can be described as a ‘thin-walled-
garden’ model managed by the Service 
Provider. The project leader for tech-
nology was explicitly appointed and he 
organised weekly sessions to discuss 
design decisions and the progress of the 
project. A service project leader was 
missing and critical comments on this 
were made during the interviews.

This was not done properly. During 
activity S.T.1 different teams did the 
programming for the privacy and the

that they had used different software 
languages and the impact of this was 
that different servers were needed. The 
solution in the first version of MIES 
(for the ESS test) was that templates had 
to be copied and if one team changed 
something in the template the user saw 
differences in the MIES menu. This was 
of course not what was wanted. In the 
second version of MIES all applications 
were reprogrammed to the same lan-
guage.

Evaluation 
The project was considered a success by the users of the service and the 
organisations involved in the project. However, critical remarks can be 
made on the design process and on the further course of the project. In 
chapter 6 it was mentioned that the challenge is to find design methods and 
tools that provide answers to the trade-offs between the elements value 
network, technology and service concept. The challenges are discussed 
along the lines of these trade-offs. 
The first trade-off concerns the service concept and the technology: 
‘How to get the enabling technology to support a service that fulfils the de-
mand of the users?’ The design method followed in this case has as starting 
point that the design process should start with the investigation of the wants 
and needs of the user. This is followed by an inventory of the available 
building blocks to assemble the service. In the project was found that the 
gap between the storylines and the programming required for ‘MIES on the 
campus’ was too big. The overview of the technical functions and the techni-
cal architecture design was not clear enough for the programmers. The 
technical project leader argued that functional design and technical design 
can only be done later in circumstances of time pressure since you cannot 
build a service fast if you first have to build a detailed technical architecture. 
The discussion reflects the contrast between proponents and opponents of 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
198
rapid application design. It is a challenge to find a way to do this satisfacto-
rily during the design phase. 
The second trade-off concerns the technology and value network ‘How 
to get a value network in place to provide the necessary technology?’ There 
is interdependency between the technology and the needed resources. In 
cases like this the resources can only be found in different companies. 
These companies might work with different standards. It was found that 
one company works with PHP platforms and another one with ASP plat-
forms. Since the process of standardisation is not finished, and probably will 
never be, it is important to find a way to deal with two conflicting require-
ments. It is necessary to have an open platform to facilitate many actors 
who can add value adding services, but it is also necessary that their applica-
tions work together. The provided solution for this was a platform in which 
it is easy to add building blocks. However, in the project it became clear that 
the installation of the web services platform cannot be completely open and 
needs orchestration. This taught that it is very important to make a central-
ised decision on runtime environments. 
The third trade-off concerns the value network and the service concept 
‘How to create a network of actors and coordinate the activities of these 
different actors to deliver value to the user?’ In the project a combination of 
project management and process management principles were applied. An 
important issue in this trade-off is that all partners share the same percep-
tion on the customer value of the service. It was intended to hold a collabo-
rative service design session with all partners, based on the EasyWinWin 
approach from Briggs and Gruenbacher (2002), at the start of the project. 
However, somehow it did not happen. This may have been due to bad time 
management (‘there was no time’) or due to a lack of interest on behalf of 
the partners. It would be worthwhile to do a follow up project with this ac-
tivity explicitly included.  
This project ended with the results of the prototype test in a pilot. The 
service was not further elaborated and launched on the market. Therefore, it 
was not possible to assess the business case. The test persons were asked 
how much they were prepared to pay for the service. This has to be as-
sessed by estimating the costs necessary to develop and maintain service, 
the expected amount of users and what they are prepared to pay for the ser-
vice. These revenues and costs are input for the revenue model, which 
shows how these costs and profits are divided among the participants. Such 
a revenue model must be negotiated with all the involved partners. This ac-
tivity falls in the next round of the design approach.  

 
 
7 Case: MIES on the Campus 
 
 
 
199
The next round of the design approach should be initiated by a corpo-
rate partner and not the university. The mobile operator appeared not to be 
this actor since they argued that they offer the network and expect other 
service providers to develop services to run on the network. The local con-
tent provider in this case was not large enough to be this service provider. 
So there seems to be a gap in the market for an entrepreneur who wants to 
be in the service provider business. This means the whole round of the de-
sign approach needs to be repeated with emphasis around the revenue 
model of the ‘MIES on the campus’ service. Under what conditions do the 
partners want to launch this service on the market? Do the partners forecast 
a good business case for their role in the value network that offers the ser-
vice? After the second round it should become clear if it is necessary to go 
through the design approach for a third time before the market launch.

Appendix A Unified Modelling Language dia-
grams
Modelling languages provide a vocabulary for stakeholders to communicate 
with each other. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is designed to let 
system analyst, developers, programmers and maintainers view a system 
from different perspectives and in varying degrees of abstraction (Fowler. 
2000). UML is a modelling language whose vocabulary can be used to both 
conceptually describe a service systems as well as specifying the methods 
and attributes of a software system at the programming code level. UML is 
often viewed as a de facto standard for modelling software systems and to-
day computer science students are expected to know this language. UML is 
supported by many software programmes provided by different software 
vendors (e.g. MS Visio) and programmes even exist that are able to generate 
software code from UML diagrams (e.g. Rational Rose).  
Models are of essential importance in the design process. They help to 
visualise concepts and specify them in more details. They can be used to 
communicate and specify design ideas. Moreover, they can be used for 
documenting the designed blueprint. An essential requirement for the use of 
models is that stakeholders are able to understand the modelling language. 
Communication of ideas often enables discussion about the design con-
straints and requirements and can help to generate creative ideas and in this 
way improve the design of the service system. Although UML is developed 
for designing software systems it can be helpful in designing service sys-
tems, especially in modelling the behaviour of users interacting with the ser-
vice system.  
UML consists of a collection of modelling notations that can be used to 
describe different views on the service system. One of those modelling no-
tations, Use Case modelling, is of especial importance for the engineering of 
service systems as it specifies how users interacts with service systems and 
will be discussed next. In the situation that the service system is a software 
system other UML modelling notations can be used. Before we present Use 
Case diagrams for modelling the behaviour of service systems we provide an 
overview of UML diagrams commonly used. Theses include (e.g. Fowler. 
2000):
Class Diagram. Class diagrams are widely used to describe the types of 
objects in a system and their relationships, using design elements such as 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
202
classes, packages and objects. It also displays relationships between object 
classes such as containment, inheritance, and associations. 
Use Case Diagram. The Use Case diagram displays the relationship among 
actors (types of users or roles) and “Use Cases”. Use Cases are typical situa-
tions in which the system that is designed, can be used. 
Interaction Diagram .Two different types of interaction diagrams exist 
within UML: 
1.
Sequence Diagram displays the time sequence of the objects participat-
ing in the interaction. This consists of the vertical dimension (time) and 
horizontal dimension (different objects). 
2.
Collaboration Diagram displays an interaction organised around the ob-
jects and their links to one another. Numbers are used to show the se-
quence of messages. 
State Diagram. The State Diagram displays the sequences of states that an 
object of an interaction goes through during its life in response to received 
stimuli, together with its responses and actions. It provides a detailed de-
scription of the life cycle of each object class. 
Activity Diagram. The Activity Diagram displays a special state diagram 
where most of the states are action states and most of the transitions are 
triggered by completion of the actions in the source states. This diagram 
focuses on flows driven by internal processing. 
Physical Diagrams. The physical diagrams give more detail about the im-
plementation of the system, and two different types can be distinguished: 
3.
Component Diagram displays the high level packaged structure of the 
code itself. Dependencies among components are shown, including 
source code components, binary code components, and executable 
components. Some components exist at compile time, at link time, at 
run times as well as at more than one time. 
4.
Deployment Diagram displays the configuration of run-time processing 
elements and the software components, processes, and objects that live 
on them. Software component instances represent run-time manifesta-
tions of code units. 
In the following section we discuss the use of one UML modelling notation 
for modelling service systems.

The Use Case modelling notation 
The mobile service systems are operated by all kind of actors from various 
organisations. Actors can include the end-user of a service, users updating 
the content of a system, administrators and so on. The Use Case modelling 
notation described how actors interact with the elements of a service sys-
tem. A Use Case is a description of a set of actions that a system performs 
and results in some observable result for the actors. In this way Use Cases 
structure the behavioural of a system from the user point of view. As such, 
Use Cases specifies the behaviour of a (part of) a systems, and a description 
of a typical set of sequence of actions that a system performs.  
Use Case modelling helps with reasoning about how the service system 
will be used. A service system can be used in many ways and consequently 
many sequences of activities are possible. A particular sequence of behav-
iour describing how a user interacts with the service systems is called a Use 
Case scenario, or scenario for short. Scenarios can be developed to detail the 
different paths of events and activities for each Use Case. Actors can often 
use a service system in almost an infinite number of ways. Therefore Use 
Case descriptions are often limited to a number of typical scenarios, called 
primary scenarios. The primary scenario describes the typical case where noth-
ing goes wrong. In a typical design of a service system many scenarios are 
included.
Use Case modelling is a technique often used by developers in interac-
tions with the possible users of the service system. As such it is a communi-
cation vehicle between users and developers. By making use of modelling 
technique, system developers can capture the intended behaviour of the 
service system they are developing without having to specify how the be-
haviour is implemented. During the initial stage of a project the typical sce-
narios should be defined. As the project continues non-typical scenarios and 
exceptions might be needed to be modelled and more Use Case models 
might become necessary. Moreover, as the design process continues often 
Use Cases are developed that are specialised version of the initial Use Case 
scenarios. Also Use Case diagrams might not only be applied to model the 
complete system, but also to parts of the system. 
Use Case models are sets of scenarios describing the interaction between 
a user and a system. The Use Case Model describes the proposed function-
ality of the service system from an actor point of view. A Use Case model 
represents a discrete unit of interaction between a user (human or machine) and the system 
(Fowler, 2000). The two main components of a Use Case diagram are Use 
Cases and actors as shown in Figure A-1. The Use Case specifies how the 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
204
service system should behave without having to specify how the Use Case 
will be implemented. For example someone would like to describe the typi-
cal scenario to transfer money using a banking system. The actor is the cus-
tomer of the banking service system who wants to transfer money from one 
account to another account. Examples of Use Cases are login transfer 
money, select amount and account, confirm transfer and log out. The Use 
Case model describes the sequences, in which each sequence represents the 
interaction of the user outside the system (the person who wants to transfer 
the money) with the service systems. 
Use case
Actor
Figure A - 1. Use Case notations 
Within the Use Case notation a Use Case is a functionality performed by 
the service system, and presents an external view of the system that repre-
sents some action the user might perform in order to complete a task. A 
Use Case is a single unit of meaningful work. Each Use Case contains some 
functionality that should be included in the proposed service system. Every 
Use Case must be given a unique name in order to distinguish it from other 
Use Cases. As a guideline Use Cases are short active verb phrases naming some 
behaviour. The name is often derived from the vocabulary of the service 
system that needs to be designed, i.e. the typical naming by persons is used. 
This can avoid conflicts and misunderstanding. 
Actors can carry out Use Cases. An actor represents a coherent set of 
roles that users of Use Cases play. In our example this could be “customer”. 
An actor is not necessarily a human being; it can be another system that will 
interact with the system you are modelling. Actors are not part of the sys-
tems and should be positioned outside the system. Actors describe the roles 
that human or other information systems can play. A user is often described 
by several roles. For example a customer can have a transfer money role, 
deposit money role, and manage account role.

Figure A - 2. Use Case interaction notations 
There are three types of relationships in a Use Case diagram as shown in 
Figure A - 2.. The <<communication>> relationship visualises the relation-
ship between Actors and Use Cases. The <<extend>> relationship is used 
when one Use Case is similar to another Use Case but does have more func-
tionality, for example grade sufficient degree extends grading. The 
<<uses>> relationship occurs when functionality is similar across more than 
one Use Case and you do not want to keep copying the description over 
again. In this way reuse of functionality is enabled, for example buying uses 
credit card check. 
The behaviour of a Use Case scenario is described by a flow of events. It 
should be clearly defined how the Use Case scenario is initiated and when it 
starts and ends. The list of actions starts at the top of a Use Case model and 
ends at the bottom of the model. Often Use Cases are derived from inter-
views or from written text like reports, memos and so on. A number of 
steps can be taken to develop a Use Case model. 
1.
Identify the actors of the service system. These are often denoted 
by the subject in a sentence.  
2.
Organise the actors by identifying general (e.g. customer role) and 
specialised roles (transfer money role). Often the specialised roles 
result in a typical scenario. 
3.
Identify the typical Use Case scenarios. This can be used by looking 
the primary ways in which actors can operate the service system and 
also by defining a clear goal that should be accomplished.  
4.
Determine the start and the end of the typical Use Case scenario. If 
a Use Case scenario grows too complex, it can be split up into sub-
sequent scenarios. 

Designing Mobile Service Systems 
206
5.
Identify the Use Cases in each of the scenarios. Describe the flow 
clearly enough, so stakeholders involved and non-involved are able 
to understand it. Focus on what the Use Case does and not on how 
it does it. 
6.
Determine the systems functionality that might be reused and 
model this using the <<uses>> relationship.  
7.
Determine exceptional ways and model this using <<extend>> rela-
tionship.
8.
Draw the Use Case model. In general show only those Use Cases 
that are important to understand the complex behaviour of the ser-
vice system. Rare or exceptional Use Cases might be omitted, how-
ever, they should be described in the additional list of requirements. 
The Use Case model should have clear defined system boundaries 
and only show actors related to the Use Case. 
The steps are often not performed sequentially and may contain many 
loops and iterations. Often a Use Case scenario might become more com-
plex over time as more and more behaviour is added. Then the Use Case 
scenario can be split up into multiple scenarios. It is unusual that only one 
Use Case scenario needs to be made. 
A Use Case Modelling Example 
We will demonstrate these steps using the text below derived from several 
interviews with potential users of the system. When reading the text the Use 
Case developer can start with marking the words that denote to actors (of-
ten the subject) and to Use Cases (often verbs). 
A customer wants to buy a service and therefore needs to transfer money 
to another account. The customer starts its computer and a web browser. If 
the user has no account it might contact the account manager of the bank to 
create a new account. The Use Case starts when the systems prompts for a 
login name and password. The customer logs in and the system shows the 
menu. The customer selects the transfer money options and a dynamic form 
appears. The customer should fill in the amount and the account number of 
the account the money should be transferred to. After sending the form 
over a secure connection, the information the service system checks if there 
is sufficient money in the account available. A confirmation screen appears 
and the customer should either confirm or cancel the transaction.  
When modelling the Use Case it is of crucial importance to focus on 
what the Use Case does, not on how it does it. The main actor in this sce-

 
 
Appendix A UML diagrams 
 
 
 
207
nario is the customer who wants to transfer money. The modelling of Use 
Cases starts by listing a sequence of steps a user might take in order to 
complete an action. The beginning and end are already clear from the text. 
The Use Cases can be identified by looking at the verbs and marking them. 
For example a user transferring money might follow these steps as shown in 
the following figure.  
Use Case scenario name: 
Transfer money 
Use Case scenario intent:
To enable a customer to transfer money 
from one account to another account to pay 
for a service 
Version number 
1.0
Use Case scenario description 
1.
Log in using a username and password 
2.
Select money transfer option from the menu 
3.
Fill in amount of money that needs to be transfer and the ac-
count number of the destination 
4.
Either Confirm or cancel money transfer 
 
4a Confirm the money transfer 
 
4b Cancel the money transfer 
5.
Log out 
Requirements and other information 
The whole session should be secured 
The account check function should be reused  
Figure A - 3. Description of the Money transfer scenario for the banking service system 
Often other roles are involved, for example, an account manager who is 
able to create a new account for a non-existing customer. Also the account 
might be destroyed. This results in the money transfer scenario for the 
banking service systems as shown below. It might become clear that the 
graphical representation is much easier to understand and to communicate 
that the written Use Case description. In the case studies description in this 
book many more examples of Use Case descriptions can be found.

Figure A - 4. Money transfer scenario for the banking service system 
The banking service systems can be completely described by modelling 
several typical scenarios. These scenarios might also re-use the account 
check functionality, as this is described using a <<uses>> relationship. The 
Use Case models can be used for the following purposes: 
1.
Model a service system to a degree sufficient for developers to pro-
gramme the software, without going into too many details which 
would make it more difficult to understand.  
2.
Communicating the behaviour to potential users. Use Cases are 
relatively easy-to-understand. By specifying classes, methods and at-
tributes users might be lost in details instead of understanding the 
main system behaviour. The communication process might even re-
sult in suggestions fro improvement of the Use Case model.  
3.
Understand the complex relationship between the elements of a sys-
tem. For example it is relatively easy to determine the building 
blocks that should be made generic to enable reuse in multiple 
situations.

4.
Supporting testing. Typical user scenarios might be followed to test 
the systems if it satisfies requirements. 
5.
Ensuring adaptability. Not only the current behaviour might be de-
scribed, but also scenarios might be developed describing potential 
future behaviour of the system that might be added later. In this 
way the system might become more sustainable and have a longer 
life-cycle. 
The Use Case description can be completed by specifying the non-
functional requirements, constraints and other information that might 
be used when implementing the service system. Constraints are the 
formal rules and limitations that a Use Case operates under, and in-
cludes pre- post- and invariant conditions. A pre-condition specifies 
what must have already occurred or be in place before the Use Case 
may start. A post-condition specifies what will be true once the Use 
Case is complete. An invariant specifies what will be true throughout 
the time the Use Case operates. Also information describing exceptional 
situations or expected problems when implementing the service system 
might be included.
