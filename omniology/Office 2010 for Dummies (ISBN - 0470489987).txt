About the Author
In case you’re reading this biography, wondering who wrote this book, the 
answer is simple. I did.
If that simple statement doesn’t satisfy your curiosity, you might like to know 
that I’ve written several dozen computer books, most of which are out of 
print (unless someone still wants a book teaching them about the joys 
of Turbo Pascal programming or how to write macros in WordPerfect 5.0 
for DOS). 
Besides writing books on obsolete computer topics, I’ve also written books 
about the Macintosh, computer hackers, real estate investing, stock market 
day trading, computer programming, the iPhone, the iPad, and breaking into 
acting. I enjoy writing about different topics just to keep myself amused and 
learn something new each time. Otherwise if I let my mind stagnate, I might 
wind up believing what left and right wing extremists try to tell me.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to all those happy Microsoft Offi ce users who sud-
denly fi nd themselves trying to fi gure out Microsoft’s latest incarnation with-
out losing their mind and going completely crazy in the process. If you fi nd 
Microsoft Offi ce 2010 confusing, relax. It’s not your fault, it’s Microsoft’s fault 
for piling on features and then burying once-familiar commands behind a new 
user interface that’s designed to be easier to use, but which often just winds 
up being harder to use.
Remember, you’re not alone in your suffering trying to master Microsoft 
Offi ce, and with the help of this book, you can learn what you need to know 
and start doing something productive right away. For putting up with all of 
Microsoft’s quirks and nuisances, this book is dedicated to every Microsoft 
Offi ce user in the world.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This book could never have been written without Bill Gladstone and Margot 
Hutchison at Waterside Productions. Of course, if they weren’t my agents, 
they would have just gotten someone else to write this book and that per-
son’s name would be plastered across the cover.
A big round of thanks must also go to the whole, happy crew at Wiley 
Publishing for turning this project into reality: Bob Woerner, Pat O’Brien, 
Debbye Butler, and Vince McCune for editing, revising, and correcting what 
I wrote so I don’t wind up looking as poorly educated as many of our recent 
American politicians. 
I also want to acknowledge all the stand-up comedians I’ve met, who have 
made those horrible crowds at comedy clubs more bearable: Darrell Joyce 
(http://darrelljoyce.com), Leo “the Man, the Myth, the Legend” 
Fontaine, Chris Clobber, Bob Zany (www.bobzany.com), Russ Rivas 
(http://russrivas.com), Doug James, Don Learned, Dante, and Dobie 
“The Uranus King” Maxwell. Another round of thanks goes to Steve Schirripa 
(who appeared in HBO’s hit show The Sopranos) for giving me my break in 
performing at the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, one of the few old-
time casinos left that the demolition crews still haven’t imploded (yet).
Finally, I’d like to acknowledge Cassandra (my wife), Jordan (my son), and 
Bo and Nuit (my cats) for putting up with my long hours sitting in front of 
my Windows 7 laptop, goofi ng around with the latest version of Microsoft 
Offi ce 2010.

Introduction
W
elcome to the most popular office productivity software in the world. 
If you’re already familiar with Microsoft Office 2007, you’ll find that 
the new Microsoft Office 2010 is familiar enough to use right away with mini-
mal training, but comes jampacked with additional features to make Office 
even more useful than ever before. If you’ve been using a much older version 
of Office such as Office 2003 or earlier, you’ll find Office 2010 to be a radical 
leap forward in both features and its new user interface.
Like most software, the real challenge is figuring out where to find the com-
mands you need to do something useful. While this book won’t turn you into 
a Microsoft Office 2010 expert overnight, it will give you just enough informa-
tion so you can feel confident using the new Office 2010 and get something 
done quickly and easily. 
In this book, you find out how to master the “Ribbon” user interface along 
with discovering the dozens of new features that Microsoft added to Office 
2010. More important, you find a host of shortcuts and tips to help you work 
faster and more efficiently than ever before. Whether you rely on Word, 
Excel, PowerPoint, Access, or Outlook, you’re sure to glean something new 
from this book to help you master Office 2010 on your own computer.
Who Should Buy This Book
This book is targeted toward three distinct groups. First, there are the people 
already familiar with Microsoft Office 2007 who want to catch up with the 
new features of Office 2010. For these people, this book can serve as a handy 
reference to finding out how to use the latest features.
Second, there are people upgrading from an older version of Microsoft Office, 
such as Office 2003 or Office XP. For these people, this book can serve as 
a gentle guide to help you make the transition from traditional pull-down 
menus to the new “Ribbon” user interface. 
Finally, there might be people who may have rarely (if ever) used any version 
of Microsoft Office at all. For those people, this book can serve as a guide 
through word processing (Microsoft Word), number calculations (Microsoft 

2
Office 2010 For Dummies 
Excel), presentations (Microsoft PowerPoint), database management 
(Microsoft Access), and managing your personal resources like time, appoint-
ments, and e-mail (Microsoft Outlook).
No matter how much (or how little) you may know about Microsoft Office, 
this book can show you how to use the most common and most useful fea-
tures of Office 2010 so you can start being productive right away.
How This Book Is Organized
To help you find what you need, this book is organized into parts where each 
part covers a different program in Office 2010.
Part I: Getting to Know 
Microsoft Office 2010
To use Microsoft Office 2010, you need to know how to find the commands 
you need. This part of the book focuses on showing you how to use the 
Ribbon user interface that appears in all Office 2010 programs. By the time 
you finish this part of the book, you’ll feel comfortable using any program in 
Office 2010.
Part II: Working with Word
Word processing is the most popular use for Office 2010, so this part of the 
book explains the basics of using Word. Not only will you find out how to 
create and save different types of documents, but you’ll also master different 
ways to alter text, such as using color, changing fonts, adding headers and 
footers, checking spelling and grammar, and printing your written master-
piece so it looks perfect.
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel
If you need to manipulate numbers, you need Microsoft Excel. This part of 
the book explains the three basic parts of any spreadsheet, how to format 
data, how to create formulas, and how to create different types of charts to 
help you visualize what your spreadsheet numbers really mean. Not only will 

3
 Introduction
you discover how to calculate and “crunch” numbers, but you’ll also find 
how to analyze the results and turn them into eye-catching charts to help you 
understand trends that may be buried within your data. If you want to find 
out how to use Microsoft Excel to create, format, and display spreadsheets, 
this is the part of the book for you.
Part IV: Making Presentations 
with PowerPoint
Throw away your overhead transparencies and clumsy whiteboard and 
pads of paper. If you need to give a presentation to a large group, you need 
to know how to create colorful and visually interesting presentations with 
PowerPoint instead. With PowerPoint, you can organize a presentation into 
slides that can display text, pictures, animation, and even video. By master-
ing PowerPoint, you can create presentations that grab an audience’s atten-
tion and emphasize the points you want to make while holding their interest 
at the same time.
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook
Almost nobody feels that they have enough time to stay organized, so this 
part of the book explains why and how to use Microsoft Outlook. With 
Outlook, you can read, sort, and write e-mail, keep track of appointments, 
store names and addresses of your most important contacts, and even orga-
nize your daily to-do tasks. By using Outlook to manage your busy schedule, 
you can turn your computer into a personal assistant to make you more pro-
ductive than ever before.
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access
If you need to store large amounts of information, such as tracking inven-
tories, organizing customer orders, or storing names and addresses of pro-
spective customers, you may need to use a database program like Microsoft 
Access. In this part of the book, you see how to use Access to store, retrieve, 
sort, and print your data in different ways. With Access able to slice and dice 
your information, you can better analyze your data to understand how your 
business really works.

Office 2010 For Dummies 
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Almost every program offers multiple ways of accomplishing the same task, 
and Office 2010 is no exception. After you get familiar with using Office, take 
a peek in this part of the book to read about different types of shortcuts you 
can use to work with Office even faster than before. By the time you get to 
this part of the book, you’ll be much more comfortable using Office 2010 so 
you can feel comfortable exploring and experimenting with different features 
on your own.
How to Use This Book
Although you can just flip through this book to find the features you need, 
browse through Part I for a quick refresher (or introduction) to the Office 2010 
user interface Ribbon. After you understand the basics of using this new Ribbon 
user interface, you’ll be able to master any Office 2010 program in no time.
Conventions
To get the most from this book, you need to understand the following 
conventions:
 
✓ The mouse pointer usually appears as an arrow and serves multiple pur-
poses. First, you use the mouse pointer to select data (text, numbers, 
e-mail messages, and so on) to change. Second, you use the mouse 
pointer to tell Office 2010 which commands you want to use to change 
the data you selected. Finally, the appearance of the mouse pointer can 
reveal the options available to you at that moment.
 
✓ Clicking means moving the mouse pointer over something on the screen 
(such as a menu command or a button), pressing the left mouse button 
once, and then letting go. Clicking tells the computer, “See what I’m 
pointing at? That’s what I want to choose right now.”
 
✓ Double-clicking means pointing at something with the mouse pointer and 
clicking the left mouse button twice in rapid succession.
 
✓ Dragging means holding down the left mouse button while moving 
the mouse. Dragging typically moves something from one location to 
another, such as moving a word from the top of a paragraph to the 
bottom.
 
✓ Right-clicking means moving the mouse pointer over something and 
clicking the right mouse button once. Right-clicking typically displays a 
shortcut menu of additional options.

5
 Introduction
In addition to understanding these terms to describe different mouse actions, 
you also need to understand different keystroke conventions too. When you 
see an instruction that reads Ctrl+P, that means to hold down the Ctrl key, 
press the P key, and then let go of both the Ctrl and P key at the same time.
Finally, most computer mice offer a scroll wheel that lets you roll it up or 
down, or press on it. This scroll wheel works to scroll windows up or down, 
whether you’re using Office 2010 or nearly any other type of program as well. 
In Office 2010, the scroll wheel doesn’t serve any unique purpose, but it can be 
a handy tool for rapidly scrolling through windows in any Office 2010 program.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons highlight important or useful information.
 
This icon highlights information that can save you time or make it easier for 
you to do something.
 
This icon emphasizes information that can be helpful, although not crucial, 
when using Office 2010.
 
Watch out! This icon highlights something that could hurt or wipe out impor-
tant data. Read this information before making a mistake that you might not 
be able to recover from again.
 
This icon highlights interesting technical information that you can safely 
ignore but which may answer some questions about why Office 2010 works a 
certain way.
Getting Started
The best way to master anything is to jump right in and start fiddling with dif-
ferent commands just to see what they do and how they work. In case you’re 
afraid of breaking your computer or wiping out important data, play around 
with Office 2010 on a “dummy” document filled with useless information you 
can afford to lose (like your boss’s income tax returns).

6
Office 2010 For Dummies 
Here’s your first tip. Any time you do something in Office 2010, you can undo 
or take back your last command by pressing Ctrl+Z. (Just hold down the Ctrl 
key, press the Z key, and release both keys at the same time.) There, now 
that you know about the powerful Undo command, you should have a surging 
sense of invulnerability when using Office 2010, knowing that at any time you 
make a mistake, you can turn back time by pressing Ctrl+Z to undo your last 
command.
If you get nothing else from this book, always remember that the Ctrl+Z com-
mand can save you from yourself. See? Mastering Office 2010 is going to be 
easier than you think.

Getting to Know 
Microsoft Office 
2010

In this part . . .
I
f you’re already familiar with an earlier version of 
Microsoft Office, then staring at the bizarre appear-
ance of today’s Microsoft Office 2010 might feel foreign 
and alienating. However, after you get over your initial 
fear or hesitation about Microsoft Office 2010, you’ll soon 
find that there’s actually an elegance behind its seemingly 
chaotic appearance.
Since you can’t really use Microsoft Office 2010 without 
knowing how to find the commands you need to make the 
program do what you want, this part of the book gently 
introduces you to the basics of using all of its programs. 
You’ll learn how to create, edit, add, and delete text and 
pictures. More importantly, you’ll also learn how to mod-
ify pictures within each program. If you have pictures cap-
tured from a digital camera, Microsoft Office 2010 makes it 
easier than ever to add those pictures in your documents 
and modify them for corrective or artistic purposes.  
This part of the book also introduces you to the strange 
new Ribbon user interface. If you’re already familiar with 
Microsoft Office 2007, you’ll find that the Ribbon interface 
has gone through minor modifications. However, if you’re 
more familiar with older versions of Microsoft Office 
(2003/XP/2000/97), then you might wonder where all the 
pull-down menus have gone.
Relax. This part of the book is where you can learn how to 
decipher all icons and commands buried on the Ribbon 
interface. You’ll learn how to tell what various icons do 
and what kind of information they can show you. Of 
course, you’ll also learn how to see all your options and 
learn how to find the command you want and accomplish 
a specific task in the shortest amount of time possible.  
While this book can guide you into mastering Microsoft 
Office 2010, it can’t provide all the answers. To get the 
answers that you need, this part of the book will also 
show you how to browse and search through Microsoft 
Office’s own help system. 
Before you know it, you’ll be well on your way to under-
standing and feeling comfortable using Microsoft Office 
2010. At that point, you can start using your favorite pro-
gram and get something useful done.

M
icrosoft Office 2010 consists of five core programs: Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, Access, and Outlook. Each of these core programs spe-
cializes in manipulating different data. Word manipulates words, sentences, 
and paragraphs; Excel manipulates numbers; PowerPoint manipulates 
text and pictures to create a slide show; Access manipulates data, such as 
inventories; and Outlook manipulates personal information, such as e-mail 
addresses and phone numbers.
Although each Office 2010 program specializes in storing and manipulating 
different types of data, they all work in similar ways. First, you have to enter 
data into an Office 2010 program by typing on the keyboard or loading data 
from an existing file. Second, you have to tell Office 2010 how to manipulate 
your data, such as underlining, enlarging, coloring, or deleting it. Third, you 
have to save your data as a file.
To help you understand this three-step process of entering, manipulating, 
and saving data, Office 2010 offers similar commands among all its programs 
so you can quickly jump from Word to PowerPoint to Excel without having to 
learn entirely new commands to use each program. Even better, Office 2010 
rearranges its numerous commands so finding the command you need is 
faster and easier than ever before. (If you think this implies that previous ver-
sions of Microsoft Office were clumsy and hard to use, you’re right.)
 
If you’re already familiar with computers and previous editions of Microsoft 
Office, you may want to browse through this chapter just to get acquainted 
with how Office 2010 rearranges common program commands. If you’ve never 
used a computer before or just don’t feel comfortable using Microsoft Office, 
read this chapter first.

Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
Starting an Office 2010 Program
The most straightforward way to load any Office 2010 program is to choose 
a program from the Start menu, and then create a new document or open an 
existing one. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
2. Choose All Programs.
 
 Another pop-up menu appears.
 
3. Choose Microsoft Office.
 
 A list of programs appears on the Start menu.
 
4. Choose the Office 2010 program you want to use, such as Microsoft 
Word 2010 or Microsoft PowerPoint 2010.
 
 Your chosen program appears on the screen. At this point, you can open 
an existing file.
Starting an Office 2010 program from the Start menu is most useful when 
you want to create a new document. If you just want to load an existing file, 
loading a Microsoft Office 2010 program and then loading that file is a clumsy 
two-step process. For a faster way to load a file and the Microsoft Office 2010 
program that created it, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
2. Choose Documents.
 
 A dialog box appears.
 
3. Double-click the file you want to open.
 
 You may need to open a different folder or drive to find the file that 
you want.
Introducing the Microsoft 
Office Backstage View
One major change in Office 2010 is the Microsoft Office Backstage View, 
which replaces the traditional File menu in older versions of Office and the 
Office Button in Office 2007.

11
 Chapter 1: Introducing Microsoft Office 2010
The Microsoft Office Backstage View appears in all Office 2010 programs and 
isolates common file commands on a single screen so you can see all your 
options at once, as shown in Figure 1-1:
 
✓ The left pane of the Backstage View lists common commands for creat-
ing, saving, or printing your file.
 
✓ The middle pane typically displays additional options you can choose 
for the command selected in the left pane. 
 
✓ The right pane displays additional details about your file.
In Figure 1-1, the Info command is selected in the left pane, the middle pane 
displays three options, and the right pane displays detailed information 
about your document, such as how long you’ve been working on it and how 
many words it contains. 
In Figure 1-2, the New command is selected in the left pane, the middle pane 
displays different types of files you can create, and the right pane displays a 
preview of a file type selected in the middle pane.

To use the Backstage View, follow these basic steps:
 
1. Click the File tab to display the Backstage View.
 
 You can also open the Backstage View by pressing Alt+F and using 
either the keyboard or the mouse to choose additional commands.
 
2. Select a command in the left pane to view your options in the middle 
pane.
 
3. Select an option in the middle pane.
 
4. View the information (or select a command) in the right pane.
 
Sometimes when you select a command in the left pane (such as the Save 
command), you won’t see any further options in the middle or right panes. 
Likewise, sometimes when you select an option in the middle pane, you won’t 
see any additional information displayed in the right pane.
To exit the Backstage View, click the File tab again.

13
 Chapter 1: Introducing Microsoft Office 2010
The File tab
The various commands available on the File tab include
 
✓ Save: Saves your file. If you haven’t named your file yet, the Save com-
mand is equivalent to the Save As command.
 
✓ Save As: Save the current file under a new name and/or in a different file 
format.
 
✓ Open: Loads an existing file.
 
✓ Close: Closes an open file but keeps the Office 2010 program running.
 
✓ Recent: Displays a list of files that you recently loaded.
 
✓ New: Creates a new file.
 
✓ Print: Prints the current file.
 
✓ Share: Sends a file as an e-mail attachment or fax along with saving the 
file in different formats (similar to the Save As command).
 
✓ Options: Displays various options for customizing the way each Office 
2010 program behaves.
 
✓ Exit: Closes any open files and exits the Office 2010 program.
 
In Word, a file is called a document. In Excel, a file is called a workbook. In 
PowerPoint, a file is called a presentation. In Access, a file is called a database.
Creating a new file
Each time you create a new file, you have the option of choosing different 
types of templates that are already formatted and designed for specific pur-
poses, such as a calendar, newsletter, sales report, or corporate slide show 
presentation, as shown in Figure 1-3. 
To create a new file, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click New.
 
 A list of templates appears (see Figure 1-3).
 
3. Double-click the template you want to use.
 
 Office 2010 creates a new file based on your chosen template. For some 
templates, you may need access to the Internet to download the tem-
plates from Microsoft’s Web site.

Opening an existing file
When you load an Office 2010 program, you may want to edit a file that you 
created and modified earlier. To open an existing file, you need to tell Office 
2010 the location and name of the file you want to open. Just follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click Open.
 
 An Open dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-4.
 
3. (Optional) Click a folder, and then click Open to search for a file 
inside a folder. Repeat this step as many times as necessary.
 
4. Click the file you want to open, and then click Open.
 
 Your chosen file appears, ready for editing.

Figure 1-4: 
The Open 
dialog box 
lets you 
change 
drives and 
folders to 
find the file 
you want 
to use.
 
Opening a recently used file
As a shortcut, Office 2010 keeps track of your most recently opened files and 
stores them in a list so you can find them again. If you need to open a file that 
you opened earlier, you may find it much faster by locating it through this list 
of recently opened files. 
To open through the recently used file list, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click Recent.
 
 The list of recently opened files appears, as shown in Figure 1-5.
 
3. Click a file.
 
 Your chosen file appears.
 
Figure 1-5:

16
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
 
The list of recently opened files changes each time you open a different file. If 
you want to keep a particular filename always displayed on this list, click the 
Pin icon that appears to the right of the filename.
Saving files
Saving a file stores all your data on a hard disk or other storage device (such 
as a USB flash drive). The first time you save a file, you need to specify three 
items:
 
✓ The drive and folder to store your file
 
✓ The name of your file
 
✓ The format to save your file
The drive and folder where you store your files are completely arbitrary. 
However, it’s a good idea to store similar files in a folder with a descrip-
tive name, such as Tax Evasion Information for 2011 or Extortion Letters to 
Grandma. By default, Office 2010 stores all your files in the Documents folder.
The name of your file is also completely arbitrary, but it’s also a good idea 
to give your file a descriptive name, such as Latest Resume to Escape My 
Dead-End Job or Global Trade Presentation for World Domination Meeting on 
September 9, 2012.
The format of your file defines how Office 2010 stores your data. The default 
file format is simply called Word Document, Excel Workbook, PowerPoint 
Presentation, or Access Database. Anyone using Office 2010 or Office 2007 
can open these files.
Saving a file for Office 2010/2007
To save your files in the latest Office format, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click Save.
 
 If you have previously saved this file, you just need to complete Steps 1 
and 2. If this is the first time you’re saving the file, a Save As dialog box 
appears and you need to complete Steps 3, 4, and 5.
 
 For a quick way to save a file, click the Save icon that appears above the 
File tab or press Ctrl+S.
 
3. Click in the File Name text box and type a descriptive name for 
your file.
 
4. (Optional) Click on a different folder or location to store your file.
 
5. Click Save.

17
 Chapter 1: Introducing Microsoft Office 2010
 
After you save a file once, you have to go through only Steps 1 and 2 again.
Saving a file for older versions of Microsoft Office
If you need to share files with people using older versions of Microsoft Office, 
you need to save your files in a different file format known as 97-2003, such as 
Word 97-2003 Document or PowerPoint 97-2003 Presentation.
This special 97-2003 file format saves Office 2010 files so that previous ver-
sions of Microsoft Office 97/2000/XP/2003 can open and edit your files.
 
When you save files in the 97-2003 format, Microsoft Office 2010 saves your 
files with a three-letter file extension, like .doc or .xls. When you save files 
in the Office 2010 format, Microsoft Office 2010 saves your files with a four- or 
five-letter file extension, such as .docx or .pptx, as shown in Table 1-1.

To save your Office 2010 files in the 97-2003 format, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click Save & Send.
 
 The middle pane displays different options.
 
3. Click Change File Type under the File Types category.
 
 A list of different formats appears, as shown in Figure 1-6.
 
4. Click the 97-2003 format option, such as Word 97-2003 Document or 
Excel 97-2003 Workbook.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears.
 
 If you want to share your file with different types of programs, you may 
need to choose a different file format, such as Rich Text Format or Text.

Closing a file
When you’re done editing a file, you need to close it. Closing a file simply 
removes the file from your screen but keeps your Office 2010 program run-
ning so you can edit or open another file. If you haven’t saved your file, clos-
ing a file will prompt you to save your changes.
To close a file, follow these steps:

Using the Quick Access Toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar appears in the upper-left corner of the screen, dis-
playing icons that represent commonly used commands such as Save, Undo, 
and Redo, as shown in Figure 1-7.

commands.
 
Quick Access toolbar
Using the Quick Access icons
If you click the Save icon in the Quick Access toolbar, Office 2010 saves your 
current file. If you’re saving a new file, a dialog box pops up, asking you to 
choose a name for your file.
The Redo icon reverses the last Undo command you chose. For example, if 
you delete a paragraph, Office 2010 makes that paragraph disappear. Then 
if you immediately click the Undo icon, the paragraph magically reappears. If 
you immediately click the Redo icon, the Redo command reverses the Undo 
command and deletes the paragraph once more.
The Undo icon is unique in that it offers two ways to use it. First, you can 
click the Undo icon to undo the last action you chose. Second, you can click 
the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the Undo icon to 
display a list of one or more of your previous actions, as shown in Figure 1-8.
 
Figure 1-8: 
The Undo 
icon dis-
plays a list 
of actions 
you can 
undo.
 

20
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
The most recent action you chose appears at the top of this list, the second 
most recent action appears second, and so on. To undo multiple commands, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the 
Undo icon in the Quick Access toolbar.
 
2. Move the mouse pointer to highlight one or more actions you want to 
undo.
 
3. Click the left mouse button.
 
 Office 2010 undoes all the multiple actions you selected.
Adding icons
The Quick Access toolbar is designed to put your most commonly used com-
mands (such as the Save, Undo, and Redo commands) where you can find 
them quickly. To add other icons to the Quick Access toolbar, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar arrow.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 1-9.
 
Figure 1-9:

 You can add an icon to the toolbar by clicking on an icon name, such as 
Quick Print or New, from the pull-down menu.
 
2. Click More Commands.
 
 An Options window appears, as shown in Figure 1-10. The panel on the 
right shows all the current icons on the Quick Access toolbar. The panel 
on the left shows all the additional icons you can add.

as Home Tab or Insert Tab.
 
 The left panel displays a list of icons and commands.
 
4. Click an icon and then click the Add button.
 
5. (Optional) Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for each additional icon you want to 
add to the Quick Access toolbar.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Your chosen icon (or icons) now appears on the Quick Access toolbar.
Removing icons
You can remove icons from the Quick Access toolbar at any time. To remove 
an icon, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click an icon on the Quick Access toolbar.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
2. Click Remove from Quick Access Toolbar.
 
 Office 2010 removes your selected icon from the Quick Access toolbar.

22
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
Moving the Quick Access toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar can appear in one of two places:
 
✓ Above the Ribbon (its default location)
 
✓ Below the Ribbon
To move the Quick Access toolbar, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Customize Quick Access Toolbar arrow.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
2. Choose Place Quick Access Toolbar Below (or Above) the Ribbon.
 
 If the Quick Access toolbar currently appears over the Ribbon, you’ll see 
the Place Quick Access Toolbar Below the Ribbon command. 
 
 If the Quick Access toolbar appears under the Ribbon, you’ll see the 
Place Quick Access Toolbar Above the Ribbon command.
Using the Ribbon
With Office 2007, Microsoft abandoned the traditional pull-down menu bars 
and replaced them with the Ribbon, which organizes commands into catego-
ries called contextual tabs. Office 2010 uses the same Ribbon interface but 
with a slightly different look. If you’re already familiar with Office 2007, you’ll 
have no trouble learning Office 2010. If you’ve never used Office 2007, take 
some time to get acquainted with the Ribbon interface. At first it might seem 
strange, but over time, you’ll see how handy it can be.
Each tab displays a different group of commands. For example, the Page 
Layout tab displays only those commands related to designing a page, and 
the Insert tab displays only those commands related to inserting items into 
a file, such as a page break or a picture, as shown in Figure 1-11. The Ribbon 
usually shows the Home tab when you start.
Using the Ribbon is a two-step process. First, you must click the tab that con-
tains the command you want. Second, you click the actual command.
 
Tabs act exactly like traditional pull-down menus. Whereas a pull-down menu 
simply displays a list of commands, tabs display a list of icons that represent 
different commands.

23
 Chapter 1: Introducing Microsoft Office 2010
 
Figure 1-11: 
Each tab 
displays 
a differ-
ent group 
of related 
commands.
 
Deciphering Ribbon icons
Each Ribbon tab displays commands as buttons or icons, organized into 
groups. There are four types of icons displayed on the Ribbon:
 
✓ One-click icons: These icons do something with a single click.
 
✓ Menu icons: These icons display a pull-down menu of options you can 
choose.
 
✓ Split-menu icons: These icons consist of two halves. One half lets you 
choose a command like a one-click icon, and the second half displays a 
downward-pointing arrow, which displays additional options.
 
✓ Combo boxes: These display a text box where you can type a value in or 
click on a downward-pointing arrow to choose from a menu of options.
Using one-click icons
One-click icons simply display an icon, or an icon with text. To use a one-
click icon, you select the data you want to manipulate, such as a paragraph 
or a picture, and then click the icon. Figure 1-12 shows one-click icons that 
display only an icon or both text and an icon.
 
The most common one-click icons are the Cut and Copy commands, which 
appear on the Home tab of every Office 2010 program.
Using menu icons
A one-click icon represents a single command. However, there isn’t enough 
room on the Ribbon to display every possible command as a single icon. As 
a result, menu icons display a pull-down menu that stores multiple options 
within a single icon, as shown in Figure 1-13.

The Line Spacing icon, found on the Home tab of Word and PowerPoint, is a 
typical menu icon that lets you click it to view a pull-down menu of options. 
Selecting an option in the pull-down menu immediately manipulates your 
selected data.
Using split-menu icons
Split-menu icons give you two choices:
 
✓ If you click the top or left half of a split-menu icon, you choose a default 
value. For example, the left half of the Font Color icon lets you choose 
the currently displayed color. 
 
✓ If you click the bottom or right half of a split-menu icon, a pull-down 
menu appears, letting you choose a new default option, as shown in 
Figure 1-14.

The Paste and Font Color icons, found on the Home tab of Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint, are typical split-menu icons. 
 
You can identify split-menu icons because only half of the icon appears high-
lighted when you move the mouse pointer over that half.
Using combo boxes
A combo box gives you two ways to choose an option:
 
✓ Type directly into the combo box.
 
✓ Click the downward-pointing arrow to display a list of options, as shown 
in Figure 1-15.
 
Figure 1-15:

The Font and Font Size combo boxes, found on the Home tab of Word, Excel 
and PowerPoint, are typical combo boxes:
 
✓ If you click the left side of the Font Size combo box, you can type your 
own value in for a font size.
 
✓ If you click the downward-pointing arrow on the right side of the Font 
Size combo box, you can choose a value from a pull-down menu.
Identifying Ribbon icons
While some icons include descriptive text (such as Format Painter or Paste), 
most icons simply look like cryptic symbols from an alien language. To 
get additional help deciphering icons on the Ribbon, just point the mouse 
pointer over an icon and a short explanation appears, called a ScreenTip, as 
shown in Figure 1-16.

26
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
ScreenTips provide the following information:
 
✓ The official name of the command (which is Format Painter in Figure 1-16)
 
✓ The equivalent keystroke shortcut you can use to run the command 
(which is Ctrl+Shift+C in the figure)
 
✓ A short explanation of what the command does
 
Figure 1-16: 
A ScreenTip 
explaining 
the Format 
Painter icon.
 
To view the ScreenTip for any icon on the Ribbon, move the mouse pointer 
over that icon and wait a few seconds for the ScreenTip to appear.
 
Shortcut keystrokes let you choose a command from the keyboard without 
the hassle of clicking a tab and then clicking the icon buried inside that tab. 
Most shortcut keystrokes consist of two or three keys, such as Ctrl+P or 
Ctrl+Shift+C.
Displaying dialog boxes
On each tab, the Ribbon displays related commands in a group. For exam-
ple, the Home tab groups the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands within the 
Clipboard group and the text alignment and line spacing commands within 
the Paragraph group. 
Although you can choose the most commonly used commands directly from 
the Ribbon, Word often contains dozens of additional commands that don’t 
appear on the Ribbon. To access these more obscure commands, you need 
to open a dialog box.
In the bottom-right corner of a group of icons on the Ribbon, you’ll see the 
Show Dialog Box icon, which looks like an arrow pointing diagonally down-
ward, as shown in Figure 1-17.
 
Not every group of icons on the Ribbon displays the Show Dialog Box icon.

2. Click on the Show Dialog Box icon in the bottom-right corner of a 
group such as the Font or Paragraph group found on the Home tab.
 
 Office 2010 displays a dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-18.
 
3. Choose any options in the dialog box, and then click OK or Cancel 
when you’re done.

Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
Using Live Preview
With earlier versions of Office, you had to select data and then choose a com-
mand without knowing exactly how that command would affect the appear-
ance of your data. If you didn’t like the way a command changed your data, 
you had to choose the Undo command and start all over again.
To avoid this hassle of constant experimentation with different commands, 
Office 2010 offers a feature called Live Preview. Live Preview lets you move 
the mouse pointer over certain icons displayed in the Ribbon and then imme-
diately see the changes displayed in your current file.
 
✓ If you like the way your data looks, go ahead and choose the command. 
 
✓ If you don’t like the way the data looks, just move the mouse away. Your 
data returns to its original appearance without forcing you to choose 
the Undo command.
To use Live Preview, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor (or click the mouse) on an object (text, picture, table, 
and so on) that you want to change.
 
2. Move the mouse pointer over any command.
 
 Office 2010 shows you how your chosen object will look if you choose 
the command, as shown in Figure 1-19.
 
3. Choose the command to change your object (or move the mouse 
pointer away from the command so you don’t choose that command).
 
In Word, Live Preview will not work if you display your document in Draft 
view.
Minimizing the Ribbon
Some people like the Ribbon displaying various icons at all times, but others 
find that it makes the screen appear too cluttered. In case you want to tuck 
the Ribbon out of sight (or display a Ribbon that is already tucked out of 
sight) so icons only appear when you click on a tab, choose one of the follow-
ing methods as shown in Figure 1-20:
 
✓ Double-click on the current tab.
 
✓ Press Ctrl+F1.
 
✓ Click the Minimize Ribbon icon that appears on the far right next to the 
Help (Question Mark) icon.

To make the icons temporarily appear, click once on any tab. The moment 
you click away from the Ribbon, the Ribbon will hide its icons again.
Customizing an Office 2010 Program
If you don’t like the default settings of your favorite Office 2010 program, 
you can modify them. Some common ways to modify an Office 2010 program 
include
 
✓ Changing the file format and location to save files
 
✓ Customizing the icons that appear on the Ribbon

30
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
Changing the file format and 
default location
Every Office 2010 program is designed to share files easily with anyone who 
uses Office 2010 or 2007. However, if you need to share files with people who 
use earlier versions of Office or other programs altogether, you may need to 
save your files in a different format.
To choose a default file format that each Office 2010 program will use every 
time you choose the Save command, follow these steps:
 
1. Load an Office 2010 program.
 
2. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
3. Click the Options button in the left pane.
 
 An Options dialog box appears.
 
4. Click Save.
 
 The Options dialog box displays multiple options for defining a default 
file format and file location, as shown in Figure 1-21.
 
Figure 1-21:

5. Choose a different file format and location.
 
6. Click OK when you’re done choosing different options.
Customizing the Ribbon icons
If you don’t use certain Ribbon icons, you can remove them and replace them 
with icons that represent the commands you do use most often. To custom-
ize the Ribbon icons, follow these steps:
 
1. Load an Office 2010 program.
 
2. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
3. Click the Options button in the left pane.
 
 An Options dialog box appears.

6. Click OK when you’re done choosing different options.
Exiting Office 2010
No matter how much you may love using Office 2010, eventually there will 
come a time when you need to exit an Office 2010 program and do something 
else with your life. To exit from any Office 2010 program, choose one of the 
following:
 
✓ Click the Close box in the upper-right corner of the Office 2007 window.
 
✓ Click the File tab, and then click Exit.
 
✓ Press Alt+F4.
 
If you try to close an Office 2010 program before saving your file, a dialog 
box pops up to give you a chance to save your file. If you don’t save your file 
before exiting, you’ll lose any changes you made to that file.

A
lthough you create a file only once, you can edit it many times. Editing 
can add, rearrange, or delete data, such as text, numbers, or pictures. 
All Office 2010 programs work in similar ways to edit data, so whether you 
use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Access, you’ll know the right commands to 
edit data no matter which program you may be using.
 
Whenever you edit a file, save your file periodically by clicking the Save icon 
in the Quick Access toolbar, pressing Ctrl+S, or clicking the File tab and choos-
ing Save. That way if your computer crashes or the power goes out, you won’t 
lose all the editing changes you made.
Adding Data by Pointing
When you enter data into a file, your data appears wherever the cursor 
appears on the screen. The cursor appears as a blinking vertical bar, which 
basically says, “Anything you type now will appear right here!”
Because the cursor won’t always magically appear exactly where you want 
to type data, you must move the cursor by using either the mouse or the key-
board. To move the cursor by using the mouse, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the mouse pointer where you want to move the cursor.
 
2. Click the left mouse button.
 
 The cursor appears where you click the mouse pointer.

34
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
To move the cursor by using the keyboard, you can use one of many cursor 
movement keys:
 
✓ The (up/down/left/right) arrow keys
 
✓ The Home/End keys
 
✓ The Page Up/Page Down keys
Use the up/down/right/left arrow keys when you want to move the cursor 
a small distance, such as up one line or right to the next cell in an Excel 
spreadsheet.
 
To move the cursor faster, hold down the Ctrl key and then press the arrow 
keys. If you hold down the Ctrl key, the up-arrow key moves the cursor up one 
paragraph, the down-arrow key moves the cursor down one paragraph, the 
left-arrow key moves the cursor left one word, and the right-arrow key moves 
the cursor right one word.
Pressing the Home key moves the cursor to the beginning of a sentence (or a 
row in a spreadsheet), and pressing the End key moves the cursor to the end 
of a sentence (or a row in a spreadsheet).
Pressing the Page Up/Page Down keys moves the cursor up or down one 
screen at a time.
Using any of the cursor movement keys moves the cursor to a new location. 
Wherever the cursor appears will be where you can enter new data. Table 2-1 
lists ways to move the cursor in each Office 2010 program.

Selecting Data
To modify data, you must tell Office 2010 what you want to change by select-
ing it. Then choose a command that changes your data, such as underlining 
text or deleting a picture.
To select anything in Office 2010, you can use either the mouse or the key-
board. Generally, the mouse is faster but takes some time getting used to 
coordinating the motion of the mouse with the movement of the mouse 
pointer on the screen. The keyboard is slower but much simpler to use.
Selecting data with the mouse
The mouse provides two ways to select data. The first way involves pointing 
and dragging the mouse, as shown in Figure 2-1.
 
1. Point the mouse pointer at the beginning or end of the data you want 
to select.
 
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse pointer 
over the data to select it.
 
When you drag the mouse, hold down the left mouse button. If you don’t hold 
down the left mouse button as you move the mouse, you won’t select any data 
when you move the mouse pointer across the screen.

36
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
 
Figure 2-1: 
Dragging

You can also select data by clicking the mouse. To select a picture, such as 
a chart in Microsoft Excel or a photograph added to a Microsoft Word docu-
ment, just click the picture to select it. Office 2010 displays rectangles, called 
handles, around the border of any selected picture, as shown in Figure 2-2.
To select text with the mouse, you can click the mouse in one of three ways:
 
✓ Single-click: Moves the cursor
 
✓ Double-click: Selects the word that you click
 
✓ Triple-click: Selects the entire paragraph that contains the word you 
click

37
 Chapter 2: Selecting and Editing Data
 
Figure 2-2: 
To select a 
picture, just 
click it once.
 
 
Office 2010 defines a paragraph as any chunk of text that begins on a separate 
line and ends with a Return character (¶), created by pressing the Enter key.
Selecting data with the keyboard
To select data with the keyboard, you need to use the following keys:
 
✓ The cursor movement keys (up/down/left/right arrow keys, Home/End 
keys, or Page Up/Page Down keys)
 
✓ The Shift key
 
To select all the data in a file, press Ctrl+A.
The cursor movement keys simply move the cursor. When moving the 
cursor, you can also hold down the Shift key to tell Office 2010 what to select. 
To select data, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor to the beginning or end of the data you want to 
select.
 
2. Hold down the Shift key. (Keep it pressed down.)
 
3. Move the cursor by using any of the cursor movement keys, 
such as the up-arrow key or the End key.
 
4. Release the Shift key.
 
You may find it easier to place the cursor with the mouse and then hold down 
the Shift key while pressing a cursor movement key to select data more pre-
cisely than you can by dragging the mouse.

38
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
Selecting multiple chunks of data 
with the mouse and keyboard
For greater flexibility in selecting data, you can use both the mouse and the 
keyboard to select multiple chunks of data at the same time. To select two or 
more chunks of data, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a picture or chunk of text, using either the keyboard or the 
mouse.
 
2. Hold down the Ctrl key.
 
3. Select another picture or chunk of text, using either the keyboard or 
the mouse.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 for each additional item you want to select.
 
5. Release the Ctrl key when you’re done selecting data.
Editing Text with the Pop-up Toolbar
As soon as you select text with the mouse, Office 2010 displays a pop-up tool-
bar that displays the most commonly used commands (displayed as icons). 
This pop-up toolbar appears to the upper right of the text you selected as a 
faint image. The closer you move the mouse toward this pop-up toolbar, the 
darker and sharper the toolbar appears, as shown in Figure 2-3. The farther 
you move away from the toolbar, the fainter it appears.
 
The pop-up toolbar appears only if you select text by using the mouse. If you 
select text by using the keyboard, this pop-up toolbar will not appear.
To use this pop-up toolbar, follow these steps:
 
1. Select data by using the mouse.
 
 Selecting data with the keyboard will not display the pop-up toolbar.
 
2. Move the mouse pointer to the area to the upper right of the selected 
data.
 
 The pop-up toolbar appears.
 
 The closer you move the mouse to the toolbar, the more visible the tool-
bar will appear.
 
3. Click a command (icon) on the pop-up toolbar.

area.
 
Deleting Data
The simplest way to edit a file is to delete your existing data. If you just need 
to delete a single character, you can use one of two keys:
 
✓ Backspace: Deletes the character immediately to the left of the cursor
 
✓ Delete: Deletes the character immediately to the right of the cursor
If you need to delete large chunks of text, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the data you want to delete, using either the keyboard or the 
mouse. (See the earlier section, “Selecting Data.”)
 
2. Press the Delete (or Backspace) key.
 
 Office 2010 wipes away your data.
Cutting and Pasting (Moving) Data
Moving data in Office 2010 requires a two-step process: cut and paste. When 
you cut data, you delete it but save a copy in a special area of the computer’s 
memory known as the Clipboard. When you paste data to a new location, you 
copy the data off the Clipboard and paste it in your file, as shown in Figure 2-4.

explained in the earlier section, “Selecting Data.”
 
2. Choose one of the following:
 
• Click the Cut icon (from the Home tab).
 
• Right-click the mouse; when the pop-up menu appears, choose Cut.
 
• Press Ctrl+X.
 
3. Move the cursor to a new location.

 Chapter 2: Selecting and Editing Data
 
4. Choose one of the following:
 
• Click the Paste icon (from the Home tab).
 
• Right-click the mouse; when the pop-up menu appears, choose 
Paste.
 
• Press Ctrl+V.
 
If you select data in Step 3, you can replace that selected data with the pasted 
data you selected in Step 1.
Copying and Pasting Data
Unlike the Cut command, the Copy command leaves your selected data in its 
original location but places a second copy of that data somewhere else. To 
copy and paste data, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the data you want to copy, using the keyboard or mouse, as 
explained in the earlier section, “Selecting Data.”
 
2. Choose one of the following:
 
• Click the Copy icon.
 
• Right-click the mouse; when the pop-up menu appears, choose 
Copy.
 
• Press Ctrl+C.
 
3. Move the cursor to a new location.
 
4. Choose one of the following:
 
• Click the Paste icon.
 
• Right-click the mouse; when the pop-up menu appears, choose 
Paste.
 
• Press Ctrl+V.
Using Paste Options
Cutting, copying, and pasting text from one location to another is easy. 
However, a problem can occur when you paste formatted text from one loca-
tion to another. When you paste formatted text, you have several choices, 
depending on the Office 2010 program you’re using. Three common choices 
include:

42
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
 
✓ Paste the text with the original formatting of the copied or cut text.
 
✓ Merge the pasted data with the formatting of the current text.
 
✓ Paste the text but strip away the formatting.
 
Each Office 2010 program displays slightly different options for Paste Options.
To use the Paste Options feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Select text.
 
 You can select text by either dragging the mouse over text or holding 
down the Shift key and pressing an arrow key.
 
2. Click the Home tab and click the Cut or Copy icon.
 
 If you select the Cut icon, your selected text disappears.
 
3. Move the cursor to where you want to paste your cut or copied text.
 
4. Click the Home tab, and then click the downward-pointing arrow at 
the bottom of the Paste icon.
 
 The Paste Options menu appears, displaying the different Paste Option 
options, as shown in Figure 2-5.
 
Figure 2-5: 
The Paste 
Options 
menu 
appears 
when you 
click the 
bottom half 
of the Paste 
icon.
 
 
5. Move the mouse pointer over each Paste Options icon to see how your 
pasted text will look in the file.
 
 Each time you move the mouse pointer over a different Paste Option 
icon, the appearance of the pasted text will change.
 
6. Click the Paste Options icon that you want to use.
 
If you right-click in Step 3, a pop-up menu appears with the Paste Options dis-
played, as shown in Figure 2-6.

 Chapter 2: Selecting and Editing Data
 
Figure 2-6: 
Right-
clicking can

Options.
 
Dragging with the Mouse to 
Cut, Copy, and Paste
The mouse can also cut/copy and paste data. To move data with the mouse, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select the data you want to move by using the methods described in 
the earlier section, “Selecting Data.”
 
2. Move the mouse pointer over the highlighted data.
 
3. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse.
 
 The mouse pointer displays an arrow and a box while the cursor turns 
into a dotted vertical line.
 
 Alternatively, to copy data, hold down the Ctrl key while holding down 
the left mouse button and dragging (moving) the mouse. The mouse 
pointer displays an arrow and a box with a plus sign while the cursor 
turns into a dotted vertical line.
 
4. Move the dotted vertical line cursor where you want to place the data 
you selected in Step 1.
 
5. Release the left mouse button.
 
 Your data appears in its new location.
Undo and Redo
To protect you from mistakes, Office 2010 offers a special Undo command, 
which essentially tells the computer, “Remember that last command I just 
gave? Pretend I never chose it.”

44
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
You can use the Undo command any time you edit data and want to reverse 
your changes. The two ways to choose the Undo command are
 
✓ Click the Undo icon on the Quick Access toolbar (see Figure 2-7).
 
✓ Press Ctrl+Z.
Sometimes you may make many changes to your file and suddenly realize 
that the last five or ten changes you made messed up your data by mistake. 
To undo multiple commands, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the 
Undo icon.
 
 A list of your previously chosen commands appears.
 
2. Move the mouse pointer to highlight all the commands that you want 
to undo, as shown in Figure 2-7.
 
Figure 2-7: 
The 
downward-
pointing 
arrow to the 
right of the 
Undo icon 
lets you 
view a list 
of your last 
commands.
 
 
3. Click the left mouse button.
 
 Office 2010 undoes your chosen commands.
Until you choose the Undo command at least once, the Redo icon appears 
dimmed. The Redo command lets you reapply the last command you chose 
to undo. The two ways to choose the Redo command are
 
✓ Click the Redo icon (refer to Figure 2-7).
 
✓ Press Ctrl+Y.
 
Each time you choose the Redo command, you reverse the effect of the last 
Undo command. For example, if you use the Undo command four times, you 
can choose the Redo command only up to four times.

45
 Chapter 2: Selecting and Editing Data
Sharing Data with Other 
Office 2010 Programs
Cutting, copying, and pasting data may be handy within the same file, but 
Office 2010 also gives you the ability to cut, copy, and paste data between 
different programs, such as copying a chart from Excel and pasting it into a 
PowerPoint presentation.
Using the Office Clipboard
When you cut or copy any data, Windows stores it in a special part of 
memory called the Clipboard. This Windows Clipboard can only hold one 
item at a time, so Office 2010 comes with its own Clipboard called the Office 
Clipboard, which can store up to 24 items.
Whereas the Windows Clipboard works with any Windows program (such 
as Microsoft Paint or Internet Explorer), the Office Clipboard works only 
with Office 2010 programs (such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and 
Outlook). To store data on the Office Clipboard, you just need to use the Cut 
or Copy command, and Office 2010 automatically stores your data on the 
Office Clipboard.
The two big advantages of the Office Clipboard are
 
✓ You can store up to 24 items.
 
 The Windows Clipboard can store only one item.
 
✓ You can select what you want to paste from the Clipboard.
 
 The Windows Clipboard lets you paste only the last item cut or copied.
Viewing and pasting items 
off the Office Clipboard
After you use the Cut or Copy command at least once, your data gets stored 
on the Office Clipboard. You can then view the Office Clipboard and choose 
which data you want to paste from the Clipboard into your file.
To view the Office Clipboard and paste items from it, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor to the spot where you want to paste an item from the 
Office Clipboard.
 
2. Click the Home tab.

46
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
 
3. Click the Show Dialog Box icon in the bottom-right corner of the 
Clipboard group.
 
 The Office Clipboard pane appears on the left side of the screen, as 
shown in Figure 2-8. The Office Clipboard also displays an icon that 
shows you the program where the data came from, such as Word or 
PowerPoint.
 
Figure 2-8: 
The Office 
Clipboard 
pane lets 
you view 
the current 
contents of 
the Office 
Clipboard.
 
 
4. Click the item you want to paste.
 
 Office 2010 pastes your chosen item into the file where you moved the 
cursor in Step 1.
 
5. Click the Close box of the Office Clipboard window to tuck it out of sight.
 
If you click the Paste All button, you can paste every item on the Office 
Clipboard into your file.
Deleting items from the Office Clipboard
You can add up to 24 items to the Office Clipboard. The moment you add a 
25th item, Office 2010 deletes the oldest item from the Office Clipboard to 
make room for the new cut or copied item.
You can also manually delete items from the Office Clipboard as well, by 
following these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Show Dialog Box icon in the bottom-right corner of the 
Clipboard group.
 
 The Office Clipboard appears.

47
 Chapter 2: Selecting and Editing Data
 
3. Move the mouse pointer over an item on the Office Clipboard.
 
 A downward-pointing arrow appears to the right. 
 
4. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of an item.
 
 A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 2-9.
 
Figure 2-9: 
To remove 
an item from 
the Office 
Clipboard, 
click the 
downward-
pointing 
arrow and 
click Delete.
 
 
5. Click Delete.
 
 Office 2010 deletes your chosen item.
 
6. Click the Close box to tuck the Office Clipboard out of sight.
 
If you click the Clear All button, you can delete every item currently stored on 
the Office Clipboard.
 
Make sure that you really want to delete an item from the Office Clipboard 
because after you delete it, you can’t retrieve it.

Modifying Pictures
In This Chapter
▶ Adding (and deleting) pictures
▶ Modifying pictures
▶ Altering the appearance of pictures
O
ne way to spice up your Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, or 
PowerPoint presentations is to add photographs that you’ve captured 
through a digital camera. Adding photographs is simple enough, but Office 
2010 also includes different ways to manipulate your picture by using special 
visual effects.
One common problem with photographs is that they may appear too light or 
too dark. In the past, the only way to correct these types of problems was to 
edit the picture in a photo-editing program like Adobe Photoshop. Because 
not many people have Photoshop or know how to use it, Office 2010 now con-
tains simple photo-editing tools that anyone can use to correct minor flaws.
After you’ve corrected any flaws, Office 2010 also lets you turn your photo-
graphs into art by adding frames, tilting the picture sideways, or adding a 
visual effect that makes the picture look more like a painting. 
With Office 2010, you can add photographs, correct them, and modify them 
to give all your Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files that extra bit of color and 
showmanship.
Adding (And Deleting) Pictures
To add a picture to a file, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab.
 
2. Click the Picture icon.
 
 The Insert Picture dialog box appears.

50
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
 
3. Select the picture file you want to insert.
 
 You may need to select a different folder or drive that contains the pic-
ture you want to insert.
 
4. Click the Insert button.
 
• In Word, your picture appears wherever the cursor appears. 
 
• In Excel, the upper-left corner of your picture appears in the cell 
where the cursor appears. 
 
• In PowerPoint, your picture appears in the center of the currently 
displayed slide.
To delete a picture in a file, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the picture that you want to delete.
 
 Handles appear around your selected picture.
 
2. Press the Delete or Backspace key.
Manipulating Pictures
After you add a picture to a file, it may not be in the correct position or be 
the right size. As a result, you may want to move, resize, or rotate it.
Moving a picture
To move a picture, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the picture that you want to move.
 
 Handles appear around your selected picture, as shown in Figure 3-1.
 
2. Move the picture, using one of the following methods:
 
• Move the mouse pointer over the picture and drag the mouse.
 
• Press the up/down or left/right arrow keys.

51
 Chapter 3: Modifying Pictures
 
Figure 3-1:

Resizing a picture
To resize a picture, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the picture that you want to move.
 
 Handles appear around your selected picture.
 
2. Move the mouse pointer over a handle and drag the mouse.
 
If you drag a corner handle, you can change the height and width of a picture 
at the same time.
If you click the Format tab, you can type a precise width and height for your 
picture in the Height and Width text box displayed in the Size group.
Rotating a picture
To create an interesting effect, you may want to rotate a picture in a file. To 
rotate a picture, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the picture that you want to rotate.
 
 Handles appear around your selected picture. Note that the rotate han-
dles appear separate from the resizing handles.
 
2. Move the mouse pointer over the rotate handle and drag the mouse.
 
 The mouse pointer turns into a circular arrow icon when you move it 
over the rotate handle.

52
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
Enhancing Pictures
Sometimes a picture might look almost perfect, but needs some minor cor-
rections. Other times a picture might look plain, but by adding some visual 
effects, you can turn a plain picture into a work of art.
To help you make your pictures look prettier and more visually engaging, 
Office 2010 lets you choose different effects, colors, frames, and styles. 
Choosing visual effects
Office 2010 offers several different ways to alter a picture’s visual appearance:
 
✓ Corrections: Sharpens or softens a picture, or adjusts the brightness or 
contrast
 
✓ Color: Adjusts the tone or saturation of a picture’s color, or lets you 
change the color of a picture altogether
 
✓ Artistic Effects: Makes a picture appear as different styles, such as a 
mosaic or watercolor painting
 
✓ Picture Effects: Lets you add visual effects to a picture, such as shad-
ows, glows, or rotation
To choose a visual effect for a picture, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the picture that you want to modify.
 
 The Format tab appears on the Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Corrections icon.
 
 When you click the Corrections icon, a menu of different correction 
options appears, as shown in Figure 3-2.

Choosing a picture style
Rather than force you to make individual changes to a picture, Office 2010 
provides a collection of predefined picture styles that you can apply to any 
picture added to a file. To choose a picture style, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the picture that you want to modify.
 
 The Format tab appears on the Ribbon.
 
2. Click on a style displayed in the Picture Styles group.

border can appear in different colors, thicknesses, and styles (such as a solid 
line or a dotted line).
To add or modify a border around a picture, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the picture that you want to modify.
 
 The Format tab appears on the Ribbon.

▶ Changing the appearance of the Help window
M
icrosoft did its best to make Office 2010 the easiest version of Office 
ever. No matter much or how little you may know about Office, you 
may still have a question about using the features buried in one of the many 
Office programs.
To answer any questions, Office 2010 provides a Help system, which lets you 
browse through different help topics until you (hopefully) find the answer 
you need. There are two ways to use the Help system. One, you can browse 
through the various topics displayed until you find the answer you want. This 
can take time to search but can also show you related help that you might 
find useful.
A second way to use the Help system is to type a query such as Page mar-
gins or Font size. The Help system will then display all topics related to your 
query. This can be a fast way to search for help, but if you don’t type the 
right terms that the Help system recognizes, this method may not find the 
exact help you need.
 
To view the latest help information about Office 2010, make sure that your 
computer is connected to the Internet.

Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
Browsing the Help Window
Each Office 2010 program comes with its own help files that you can access 
at any time. To browse through the Help system, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose one of the following to display the Help window, as shown in 
Figure 4-1:
 
• Click the Help icon.
 
• Press F1.
 
2. Click a topic.
 
 The Help window displays a list of Help topics as shown in Figure 4-2. 
 
3. Click a Help topic.
 
 The Help window displays information about your chosen topic. You 
may need to click on multiple Help topics until you get the answer that 
you want.

If you click the Back icon, you can view the previous text displayed in the Help 
window. If you click the Forward icon (after clicking the Back icon at least 
once), you can return forward to the text that you were looking at before you 
clicked the Back icon. If you click the Home icon, you can view the Help win-
dow’s list of topics that appear every time you open the Help window.
Searching in the Help Window
Rather than browse through one or more subcategories to find help, you may 
want to search for help by typing in one or more keywords. Such keywords 
can identify a specific topic, such as Printing or Editing charts.
 
If you misspell a topic, the Help system may not understand what you want to 
find, so check your spelling.
To search the Help window by typing in a keyword or two, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose one of the following methods to display the Help window 
(refer to Figure 4-1):
 
• Click the Help icon.
 
• Press F1.
 
2. Click in the Search list box and type one or more keywords, such as 
Formatting or Aligning text.

60
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
 
 Type as few words as possible. So rather than type “I want to find help 
on printing,” just type “Printing.” Not only will this make it easier for you 
to search for help, but it will also keep Office 2010 from looking up extra 
words that have nothing to do with your topic such as “I want to find 
help on…” 
 
3. Click Search.
 
 The Help window displays a list of topics, as shown in Figure 4-3.

Making the Help Window Easier to Read
One problem with the Help window is that it may appear too small to read 
comfortably. To get around this problem, you have two choices:
 
✓ Resize the Help window.
 
✓ Expand the size of the text inside the Help window.

61
 Chapter 4: Getting Help from Office 2010
Resizing the Help window
You can resize the Help window just like any other window by clicking one of 
the following icons in the upper-right corner:
 
✓ Minimize: Shrinks the Help window to an icon on the Windows taskbar
 
✓ Maximize: Expands the Help window to fill the entire screen
 
✓ Restore Down: Shrinks a maximized window to a smaller window that 
you can move and resize
You can also resize a window by moving the mouse pointer over one edge or 
bottom corner, holding down the left mouse button, and dragging (moving) 
the mouse.
Enlarging the text in the Help window
In addition to, or as an alternative to, resizing the Help window, you can 
enlarge the text inside the Help window to make it larger (or smaller) so you 
can read it easier or so you can cram more text within the limited confines 
of the Help window. To change the size of the text inside the Help window, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Help icon or press F1 to open the Help window.
 
2. Click the Change Font Size icon.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: 
Clicking 
the Change

62
Part I: Getting to Know Microsoft Office 2010 
 
3. Choose an option, such as Smaller or Largest.
 
 The Help window text changes in size.
Keeping the Help window 
visible at all times
When you open the Help window, Office 2010 keeps that window displayed 
on the screen while letting you use the Office 2010 program underneath. That 
way, you can read and follow the instructions in the Help window while using 
your program at the same time.
If you turn the Keep on Top feature off, the Help window will appear; but the 
moment you click in your Office 2010 program underneath, the Help window 
disappears from sight.
To turn the Keep on Top feature on (or off), click the Keep on Top (or Not on 
Top) icon in the Help window (refer to Figure 4-4).
Printing the text in the Help window
Sometimes you may find the step-by-step instructions in the Help window 
so useful that you may want to reference them again. Rather than open the 
Help window each time, you can print the step-by-step instructions so you’ll 
always have them at your fingertips when you need them.
To print the text displayed in the Help window, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Help icon or press F1 to open the Help window.
 
2. Make sure that your printer is connected to your computer and turned on.
 
3. Click the Print icon (refer to Figure 4-4).
 
 The Print dialog box appears.
 
4. Choose any options in the Print dialog box (such as choosing a printer to 
use), and then click OK to print the current contents of the Help window.
Viewing the Table of Contents
One problem with searching through the Help window is that you can easily 
lose track of which subcategory or category led you to view the current con-
tents of the Help window. To avoid this confusion, you can expand the Help 
window to display two panes. The left pane displays a table of contents while 
the right pane displays additional information, as shown in Figure 4-5.

Working with 
Word

In this part . . .
A
lmost everyone needs to use a word processor to 
write a letter, jot down some notes from a meeting 
or class, or create a report. Although this latest incarna-
tion of Word may look and feel familiar to anyone who has 
used a word processor, you’ll find that Word 2010 con-
tains dozens of useful features that this part of the book 
will help you discover and use for your everyday life.
You’ll learn simple tasks such as formatting text quickly 
and checking your spelling and grammar. Then you’ll 
learn about Word’s page design features for creating 
headers and footers (to display page numbers or titles), 
dividing a page into multiple columns, and using tables to 
organize and display data. 
You’ll find that you can use Word as a simple word pro-
cessor or as a more complicated page layout program. 
Whatever you want to create that involves words and pic-
tures, you’ll find that Word can help you turn your ideas 
into a printed page faster and easier than ever.

T
he whole purpose of Microsoft Word is to let you type in text and make 
it look pretty so you can print or send it for other people to read. So the 
first step in using Microsoft Word is finding how to enter text in a Word file, 
called a document.
In every document, Word displays a blinking cursor that points to where 
your text will appear if you type anything. To move the cursor, you can use 
the keyboard or the mouse.
Moving the Cursor with the Mouse
When you move the mouse, Word turns the mouse pointer into an I-beam 
pointer. If you move the mouse over an area where you cannot type any text, 
the mouse pointer turns back into the traditional arrow, pointing up to the left.
To move the cursor with the mouse, just point and click the left mouse 
button once. The blinking cursor appears where you clicked the mouse.
If you have a blank page or a blank area at the end of your document, you can 
move the cursor anywhere within this blank area by following these steps:

68
Part II: Working with Word 
 
1. Move the mouse pointer over any blank area past the end of a document.
 
 Word defines the end of a document as the spot where no more text 
appears. To find the end of a document, press Ctrl+End.
 
• In a new document: The end of the document is in the upper-left 
corner where the cursor appears.
 
• In a document with existing text: The end of the document is the last 
area where text appears (including spaces or tabs).
 
 Notice that a Left, Left Indent, Center, or Right Justification icon appears 
to the right or bottom of the I-beam mouse pointer, as shown in Figure 5-1.
 
2. Make sure that the correct justification icon appears next to the mouse 
pointer.
 
 For example, if you want to center-justify your text, make sure that the 
Center Justification icon appears at the bottom of the I-beam pointer.
 
 Getting the Left, Center, or Right Justification icon to appear in Step 2 
can be tricky. The Left Justification icon appears most of the time. If 
you move the mouse pointer slightly indented from the left margin of 
the page, the Left Indent icon appears. To make the Center Justification 
icon appear, move the mouse pointer to the center of the page. To make 
the Right Justification icon appear, move the mouse pointer to the right 
edge of the page.
 
3. Double-click the mouse pointer.
 
 Word displays your cursor in the area you clicked. Any text you type 
now will appear justified according to the justification icon displayed in 
Step 3.

cation icon

Moving the Cursor with the Keyboard
Moving the cursor with the mouse can be fast and easy. However, touch-
typists often find that moving the cursor with the keyboard is more conve-
nient and sometimes faster too. Table 5-1 lists different keystroke combina-
tions you can use to move the cursor.
 
You can move the cursor with both the keyboard and the mouse.

Viewing a Document
Word can display your document in one of five views, which can help you 
better understand the layout, margins, and page breaks in your document:
 
✓ Print Layout: Displays page breaks as thick, dark horizontal bars so you 
can clearly see where a page ends and begins. (This is the default view.)
 
✓ Full Screen Reading: Displays pages side by side so you see how adja-
cent pages appear next to each other.

70
Part II: Working with Word 
 
✓ Web Layout: Displays your document exactly as it would appear if you 
saved it as a Web page.
 
✓ Outline: Displays your document as outline headings and subheadings.
 
✓ Draft: Displays the document without top or bottom page margins 
where page breaks appear as dotted lines.
Switching between views
Microsoft Word gives you two ways to switch between different document 
views, as shown in Figure 5-2:
 
✓ Click the view icons in the bottom of your document window.
 
✓ Click the View tab and then click the view you want to use, such as Print 
Layout view.
Print Layout view can help you edit and create the design of your pages. If 
you just want to focus on writing and not see your page margins or headers 
and footers, you might be happier switching to Draft view instead. The two 
most unusual views are Full Screen Reading and Outline views.

 Chapter 5: Typing Text in Word
Using Full Screen Reading view
Full Screen Reading view makes documents appear side by side like the 
pages of a book, as shown in Figure 5-3. To “turn the pages” of a document 
displayed in Full Screen Reading view, choose one of the following:
 
✓ Click the Previous Screen or Next Screen button.
 
✓ Click the Jump to a Page icon.
To exit Full Screen Reading view, choose one of the following:
 
✓ Press Esc.
 
✓ Click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the screen.
 
✓ Click the Print Layout button.

72
Part II: Working with Word 
Using Outline view
Outline view divides a document into sections defined by headings and text. 
A heading represents a main idea. Text contains one or more paragraphs that 
are “attached” to a particular heading. A subheading lets you divide a main 
idea (heading) into multiple parts. A typical outline might look like Figure 5-4.
Within Outline view you can
 
✓ Collapse headings to hide parts (subheadings and text) temporarily 
from view.
 
✓ Rearrange headings to move subheadings and text easily within a large 
document.
Moving a heading automatically moves all subheadings and text. Instead of 
cutting and pasting multiple paragraphs, Outline view lets you rearrange a 
document by just moving headings around.
To switch to Outline view, click the Outline View icon at the bottom of the 
document window (or click the View tab and then click the Outline icon).
 
Figure 5-4: 
A typical 
outline 
consists of 
headings,

ings, and

can expand 
or collapse 
to hide sub-
headings 
or text from 
view.

73
 Chapter 5: Typing Text in Word
Defining a heading
Outline view considers each line as either a heading or text. To define a line 
as either a heading style (Level 1 to Level 9) or text, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor on the line that you want to define as a heading 
or text.
 
2. Click in the Outline Level list box and choose a heading level, such as 
Level 2.
Word displays Level 1 headings in large type to the far left margin. Level 2 
headings appear in smaller type that’s slightly indented to the right, Level 3 
headings appear in even smaller type that’s indented farther to the right, and 
so on, as shown in Figure 5-5.
 
To create a heading quickly, move the cursor to the end of an existing head-
ing and press Enter to create an identical heading. For example, if you put the 
cursor at the end of a Level 3 heading and press Enter, Word creates a new 
blank Level 3 heading.

different 
heading

74
Part II: Working with Word 
Promoting and demoting a heading
After you define a heading (such as a Level 1 or Level 3 heading), you can 
always change its level, such as changing a Level 1 heading to a Level 2 
heading or vice versa. When you raise a heading from one level to another 
(such as from Level 3 to Level 2), that’s promoting. When you lower a heading 
(such as from Level 4 to Level 5), that’s demoting.
 
A Level 1 heading cannot be promoted because Level 1 is the highest heading. 
Likewise, a Level 9 heading cannot be demoted because Level 9 is the lowest 
heading.
To promote or demote a heading to a different level, follow these steps:
 
1. Using either the mouse or the keyboard, move the cursor to the head-
ing you want to promote or demote.
 
2. Choose one of the following methods:
 
• Click the Outline Level list box and click a level (such as Level 2).
 
• Press Tab (to promote) or Shift+Tab (to demote) the heading.
 
• Click the Promote or Demote arrow.
 
• Move the mouse pointer over the circle that appears to the left 
of the heading, hold down the left mouse button, drag the mouse 
right or left, and then release the left mouse button.
 
You can convert a heading to a Level 1 heading quickly by just clicking the 
Promote to Heading 1 arrow.
 
Promoting or demoting a heading moves any subheadings or text attached to 
the promoted or demoted heading.
Moving headings
You can move headings up or down within a document. To move a heading, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Using either the mouse or the keyboard, move the cursor to the head-
ing you want to promote or demote.
 
2. Choose one of the following methods:
 
• Click the Move Up or Move Down arrow.
 
• Press Alt+Shift+↑ or Alt+Shift+↓.
 
• Move the mouse pointer over the circle that appears to the left of 
the heading, hold down the left mouse button, drag the mouse up 
or down, and then release the left mouse button.

75
 Chapter 5: Typing Text in Word
 
If you collapse a heading before moving it, you can move any subheadings or 
text underneath that heading.
Creating text
Text can consist of a single sentence, multiple sentences, or several para-
graphs. Text always appears indented underneath a heading (or subheading). 
To create text, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor to the end of a heading or subheading.
 
 This is the heading (or subheading) that your text will be attached to if 
you move the heading (or subheading).
 
2. Press Enter.
 
 Word creates a blank heading.
 
3. Click the Demote to Body Text button (or click in the Outline Level list 
box and choose Body Text).
 
 Word displays a bullet indented underneath the heading you chose in 
Step 1.
 
4. Type your text.
Collapsing and expanding headings and subheadings
If a heading or subheading contains any subheadings or text underneath, you 
can collapse that heading. Collapsing a heading simply hides any indented 
subheadings or text from view temporarily. Expanding a heading displays any 
previously hidden subheadings or text.
To collapse a heading along with all subheadings or body text underneath it, 
double-click the plus icon that appears to the left of the heading.
If you just want to collapse the subheading or body text immediately under-
neath a heading, choose one of the following:
 
✓ Move the cursor anywhere in the heading you want to collapse, and then 
click the Collapse button.
 
✓ Press Alt+Shift++ (plus sign key).
To expand a collapsed heading to reveal all subheadings and body text, dou-
ble-click the plus icon that appears to the left of the heading.
If you just want to expand the subheading or body text immediately under-
neath a collapsed heading, choose one of the following:

76
Part II: Working with Word 
 
✓ Move the cursor anywhere in the heading you want to expand, and then 
click the Expand button.
 
✓ Press Alt+Shift+– (minus sign key).
Navigating through a Document
If you have a large document that consists of many pages, you won’t be able 
to see all the pages at the same time. Instead, you’ll have to scroll through 
your document by using either the mouse or the keyboard.
Navigating with the mouse
To scroll through a document with the mouse, you have two choices:
 
✓ Use the vertical scroll bar that appears on the right side of every docu-
ment window.
 
✓ Use the scroll wheel of your mouse (assuming that your mouse has a 
scroll wheel).
Using the scroll bar
The scroll bar gives you multiple ways to navigate through a document, as 
shown in Figure 5-6:
 
✓ Up arrow (↑): Moves up one line at a time.
 
✓ Down arrow (↓): Moves down one line at a time.
 
✓ Scroll box: Dragging the scroll box up displays different pages. Moving 
the scroll box up moves closer to the beginning; moving the scroll box 
down moves closer to the end.
 
✓ Scroll area: Clicking above the scroll box moves the document one 
screen up; clicking below the scroll box moves the document one 
screen down.
 
✓ Previous Page (Ctrl+PgUp): Moves the cursor to the top of the preced-
ing page.
 
✓ Next Page (Ctrl+PgDn): Moves the cursor to the top of the next page.
 
✓ Select Browse Object (Alt+Ctrl+Home): Gives you a variety of ways 
to move to another part of a document, such as by page, section, or 
heading.

Using a mouse scroll wheel
If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can use that to scroll through a docu-
ment in one of two ways:
 
✓ Move the mouse pointer over your document and roll the scroll wheel 
up or down.
 
✓ Move the mouse pointer over your document and click the scroll wheel; 
then move the mouse up or down. (The scrolling speeds up the farther 
up or down you move the mouse from the position where you clicked 
the scroll wheel.) Click the left mouse button or the scroll wheel to turn 
off automatic scrolling when you’re done.
Using the Go To command
If you know the specific page number of your document that you want to 
scroll to, you can jump to that page right away by using the Go To command. 
To use the Go To command, follow these steps:

78
Part II: Working with Word 
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Choose one of the following:
 
• Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Find icon 
and click Go To.
 
• Click the Page button in the bottom-left corner.
 
• Click the Select Browse Object icon, and then click the Go To icon.
 
• Press Ctrl+G.
 
 The Find and Replace dialog box appears with the Go To tab selected, as 
shown in Figure 5-7.
 
Figure 5-7:

options.
 
 
3. Click in the Enter Page Number text box and type a page number.
 
 If you type a plus sign (+) or a minus sign (–) in front of a number, you 
can scroll that many pages forward or backward from the currently dis-
played page. For example, if the displayed page is 5, typing –2 displays 
page 3 and typing +12 displays page 17.
 
4. Click the Go To button.
 
 Word displays your chosen page.
 
5. Click Close to make the Find and Replace dialog box disappear.
Finding and Replacing Text
To help you find text, Word offers a handy Find feature. Not only can this 
Find feature search for a word or phrase, but it also offers a Replace option 
so you can make Word find certain words and automatically replace them 
with other words.

79
 Chapter 5: Typing Text in Word
Using the Find command
The Find command can search for a single character, word, or a group of 
words. To make searching faster, you can either search an entire document 
or just a specific part of a document. To make searching a document more 
flexible, Word lets you search for specific words or phrases, headings, or 
pages. 
Searching for text
To search for words or phrases by using the Find command, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Find icon in the Editing group.
 
 The Navigation Pane appears in the left side of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 5-8.
 
 If you click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Find icon, a 
menu appears that lets you choose the Find or Go To command.
 
Figure 5-8: 
The 
Navigation 
Pane lets 
you type 
the text you 
want to find.
 
 
3. Click in the Search Document text box, type a word or phrase to find, 
and press Enter.
 
 The Navigation Pane lists all matching text, as shown in Figure 5-9.

80
Part II: Working with Word 
 
Figure 5-9: 
All matching 
text appears

 As you type, Word displays all matching text. So if you start typing he, 
Word will find all text that matches “he,” such as “hello,” “helicopter,” 
or “help.”
 
4. Click on any of the text displayed in the Navigation Pane.
 
 Word highlights your chosen text in your document.
 
5. Click on the X icon that appears in the Search Document text box in 
the Navigation pane.
 
 Word clears the text you typed in Step 3.
Customizing text searching
If you just want to find a word or phrase, the ordinary Find command works, 
but if Word finds too much irrelevant text, you might want to take time to 
customize how Word searches for text. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Find icon in the Editing group.
 
 The Navigation Pane appears in the left side of the screen (refer to 
Figure 5-8).
 
3. Click the Magnifying Glass icon in the Search Document text box in 
the Navigation pane.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-10.

• Match case: Finds text that exactly matches the upper- and lower-
case letters you type
 
• Find whole words only: Finds text that is not part of another word. 
Searching for on will not find words like onion

82
Part II: Working with Word 
 
• Use wildcards: Lets you use the single character (?) or multiple 
character (*) wildcards, such as searching for d?g, which will find 
dog or dig; or b*t, which will find but, butt, or boost
 
• Sounds like: Searches for words based on their phonetic pronun-
ciation, such as finding elephant when searching for elefant
 
• Find all word forms: Finds all variations of a word, such as finding 
run, ran, and running
 
• Match prefix: Searches for the prefix of words, such as finding 
words like “interact” just by searching for “inter”
 
• Match suffix: Searches for the suffix of words, such as finding words 
like “runner” or “keeper” just by searching for “er”
 
• Ignore punctuation characters: Ignores punctuation characters in 
text, such as finding the phrase “Hello, there” when you searched 
for “Hello there” in the Navigation Pane
 
• Ignore white-space characters: Ignores spaces when searching, such 
as finding the phrase “BotheCat” when you searched for “Bo the 
Cat” in the Navigation Pane
 
6. Click OK to make the Find Options dialog box disappear.
 
 The next time you search for text, Word will use the options you chose.
Searching by headings
Rather than search for a word or phrase, you might want to browse a long 
document by headings. After you find the heading you want, then you can 
edit or read the text underneath that heading. 
To search by headings, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Find icon in the Editing group.
 
 The Navigation Pane appears in the left side of the screen (refer to 
Figure 5-8).
 
3. Click the Headings tab (underneath the Search Document text box) in 
the Navigation Pane.
 
 A list of headings appears in the Navigation Pane, as shown in Figure 5-12.
 
4. Click on a heading in the Navigation Pane.
 
 Word displays the heading in your document.

 Chapter 5: Typing Text in Word
 
Figure 5-12: 
The Heading 
tab lets you 
view all the 
headings in 
a document.
 
Browsing through pages
In a long document, you often have to scroll or flip through multiple pages to 
find specific text. To simplify this task, Word can display all pages as thumb-
nail images. You can browse through these thumbnail images and click on 
the page that you want to view in more detail.
To browse through multiple pages, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Find icon in the Editing group.
 
 The Navigation Pane appears in the left side of the screen (refer to 
Figure 5-8).
 
3. Click the Pages tab (the middle tab) in the Navigation Pane.
 
 Word displays thumbnail images of all your pages, as shown in Figure 5-13.

replace it with something else. To use the Find and Replace command, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Replace icon in the Editing group. (You can also press 
Ctrl+H.)

7. Click Find Next to search for additional occurrences of the text you 
typed in Step 3.
 
8. Click Cancel to make the Find and Replace dialog box disappear.
Checking Your Spelling
As you type, Word tries to correct your spelling automatically. (Try it! Type 
tjhe, and Word will automatically change it to the in the blink of an eye.) If 
you type something that Word doesn’t recognize, it underlines it with a red 
squiggly line.

86
Part II: Working with Word 
 
Just because Word underlines a word doesn’t necessarily mean that the word 
is spelled wrong. It could be a proper name, a foreign word, or just a word that 
Word isn’t smart enough to recognize.
To correct any words that Word underlines with a red squiggly line, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Right-click any word underlined with a red squiggly line.
 
 A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 5-16.
 
2. Choose one of the following:
 
• The word you want: Click the correct spelling of the word that 
appears in bold in the pop-up menu.
 
• Ignore: This tells Word to ignore this word but flag this same word 
anywhere else in your document.
 
• Ignore All: This tells Word to ignore this word throughout your 
document.
 
• Add to Dictionary: This tells Word to remember this word and 
never flag it again as a misspelled word.
 
Figure 5-16:

 Chapter 5: Typing Text in Word
Checking Your Grammar
Sometimes Word may underline one or more words with a green squiggly line 
to highlight possible grammar errors. To correct any grammar errors, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Right-click any text underlined with a green squiggly line.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
2. Choose one of the following:
 
• What you want: Click the correct grammar that appears in bold in 
the pop-up menu.
 
• Ignore Once: This tells Word to ignore the sentence.
 
• About This Sentence: This displays a help window that provides 
examples of correct grammar, as shown in Figure 5-17.
 
Figure 5-17: 
Choosing 
the About 
This 
Sentence 
option 
displays 
grammatical 
examples.
 
 
Rather than right-click on each possible grammatical error, you may find 
it easier to click the Proofing icon (which looks like an open book) in the 
bottom-left corner of the screen.
Although Word’s spell and grammar checker can catch most errors, it prob-
ably won’t catch all of them and it may even highlight words and sentences 
that are actually correct. Use Word’s spell and grammar checker as a tool, 
but don’t rely on it to do all your proofing for you.

▶ Clearing formatting
A
fter you type text into a document, edit it, and check it for spelling 
and grammatical errors, you’re ready to make it look pretty; a process 
known as formatting text. A properly formatted document can make your text 
easy to read, while a poorly formatted document can make even the best 
writing difficult or confusing to read.
The Home tab groups Word’s formatting tools into three categories:
 
✓ Font: Defines the font, font size, color, highlighting, and style (bold, 
italic, underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, and case)
 
✓ Paragraph: Defines justification (left, center, or right), line spacing, 
shading, borders, indentation, formatting symbols, and list style (bul-
lets, numbered, and outline)
 
✓ Styles: Displays predefined formatting that you can apply to your text
To format any text, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text you want to format.
 
2. Choose a formatting tool.
 
When you choose most formatting commands, that command stays on until 
you turn it off by choosing the same command again.

90
Part II: Working with Word 
 
As soon as you select text by dragging the mouse, Word displays the most 
commonly used formatting tools in a floating toolbar. You can click any icon 
on this floating toolbar rather than click the same icon stored on the Ribbon.
Changing the Font
The most common way to format text is to change the font. The font defines 
the uniform style and appearance of letters such as Baskerville, Courier, 
Old English, or stencil.
To change the font, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text you want to change.
 
3. Click the Font list box.
 
 A list of available fonts on your computer appears, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
4. Move the mouse pointer over each font.
 
 Word temporarily changes your selected text (from Step 2) so you can 
see how the currently highlighted font will look.
 
5. Click the font you want to use.
 
 Word changes your text to appear in your chosen font.
 
Figure 6-1: 
The Font list 
box displays 
the appear-
ance of 
each font.
 

91
 Chapter 6: Formatting Text
 
As a general rule, try not to use more than three fonts in a document. If you use 
too many fonts, the overall appearance can be annoying and distracting.
 
Not all computers have the same lists of fonts, so if you plan on sharing 
documents with others, stick with common fonts that everybody’s computer 
can display.
Changing the Font Size
The font changes the appearance of text, but the font size defines how big (or 
small) the text may look. To change the font size, you have two choices:
 
✓ Select a numeric size from the Font Size list box.
 
✓ Choose the Grow Font/Shrink Font commands.
 
You can use both methods to change the font size of text. For example, you 
may use the Font Size list box to choose an approximate size for your text, and 
then use the Grow Font/Shrink Font commands to fine-tune the font size.
To change the font size, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text you want to change.
 
3. Choose one of the following:
 
• Click the Font Size list box and then click a number, such as 12 or

Changing the Text Style
The text style defines the appearance of text in one or more of the following 
ways:
 
✓ Bold: Press Ctrl+B.
 
✓ Italic: Press Ctrl+I.
 
✓ Underline: Press Ctrl+U.
 
✓ Strikethrough: This formatting draws a line through text.
 
✓ Subscript: Use this to create text that falls below the text line, as in the 2 
in H2O.
 
✓ Superscript: Use this to create text that sits higher than the top of the 
text line, as in the 2 in E = mc2.
To change the style of text, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text you want to change.
 
3. Click a Style icon, such as Bold or Underline.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 for each additional style you want to apply to your text 
(such as italic and underlining).
 
If you select any style change without selecting any text, Word applies your 
style changes to any new text you type from the cursor’s current position.
Changing Colors
Color can emphasize text. There are two ways to use color:
 
✓ Change the color of the text (Font color).
 
✓ Highlight the text with a different color (Text Highlight color).
Changing the color of text
When you change the color of text, you’re physically displaying a different 
color for each letter. Normally, Word displays text in black, but you can 
change the color to anything you want, such as bright red or dark green.

93
 Chapter 6: Formatting Text
 
If you choose a light color for your text, it may be hard to read against a white 
background.
To change the color of text, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text you want to color.
 
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Font Color icon.
 
 A color palette appears, as shown in Figure 6-3.
 
4. Click a color.
 
 Word displays your selected text (from Step 2) in your chosen color.
 
Figure 6-3: 
Coloring text 
in different 
ways can 
emphasize 
parts of your 
document.
 
 
After you choose a color, that color appears directly on the Font Color icon. 
Now you can select text and click directly on the Font Color icon (not the 
downward-pointing arrow) to color your text.
Highlighting text with color
Highlighting text mimics coloring chunks of text with a highlighting marker 
that students often use to emphasize passages in a book. To highlight text, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text you want to highlight.
 
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Text Highlight 
Color icon.
 
 A color palette appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.

 Word highlights your selected text (from Step 2) in your chosen color.
 
5. Press Esc (or click the Text Highlight Color icon again) to turn off the 
Text Highlight Color command.
To remove a highlight, select the text and choose the same color again.
 
If no text is selected and the Text Highlight Color currently displays a color 
you want to use (such as yellow), you can click the Text Highlight Color 
icon (not its downward-pointing arrow). This turns the mouse pointer into a 
marker icon. Now you can select and highlight text in one step.
Using Text Effects
If you want a fast way to format text that appears colorful like a neon sign, 
then you can use Text Effects by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text you want to modify.
 
3. Click the Text Effects icon.
 
 A menu of different effects appears, as shown in Figure 6-5.
 
4. Click an effect.
 
 Word changes your selected text (from Step 2) in your chosen visual 
effect.

Text Effects are a unique feature of Office 2010. If you save your document in 
an older Word file format (such as Word 97-2003), you won’t be able to use 
Text Effects.
Justifying Text Alignment
Word can align text in one of four ways, as shown in Figure 6-6:
 
✓ Left: Text appears flush against the left margin but ragged on the right 
margin.
 
✓ Center: Every line appears centered within the left and right margins.
 
✓ Right: Text appears flush against the right margin but ragged on the left 
margin.
 
✓ Justified: Text appears flush against both the left and right margins.
To align text, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Move the cursor anywhere in the text you want to align.
 
3. Click one of the alignment icons, such as Center or Justify.

Rather than click an alignment icon, you can use one of the alignment key-
stroke shortcuts as follows: Align Left (Ctrl+L), Center (Ctrl+E), Align Right 
(Ctrl+R), or Justify (Ctrl+J).
Adjusting Line Spacing
Line spacing defines how close lines appear stacked on top of each other. To 
change the line spacing of text, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text where you want to adjust the line spacing.
 
3. Click the Line Spacing icon.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 6-7.
 
4. Click the line spacing you want, such as 1 (single spacing) or 3 (triple 
spacing).

97
 Chapter 6: Formatting Text
 
Figure 6-7: 
Line spacing 
can make 
text appear 
farther apart 
or squashed

vertically.
 
 
If you click the More option in the pull-down menu, you can precisely define 
your own line spacing, such as 2.75 or 3.13.
By default, Word automatically adds a blank line between paragraphs regard-
less of the line spacing you choose. To get rid of this extra space between 
paragraphs, click the Page Layout tab, click in the After text box in the 
Paragraph group, and type 0. (The default value is 10 pt.)
Making Lists
Word can organize and arrange text in three types of lists:
 
✓ Bullets (like this list)
 
✓ Numbering
 
✓ Multilevel list

98
Part II: Working with Word 
You can create a list from scratch or convert existing text into a list. To 
create a list from scratch, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Move the cursor where you want to create a list.
 
3. Click the Bullets, Numbering, or Multilevel List icon.
 
 Word creates your list (bulleted or numbered).
 
4. Type your text and press Enter to create another blank item in your list.
 
5. Repeat Step 4 for each additional bullet or numbered item you want 
to make.
If you have existing text, you can convert it into a list by following these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text you want to convert into a list.
 
3. Click the Bullets, Numbering, or Outline Numbering icon.
 
 Word converts your selected text into your chosen list where each para-
graph appears as a separate item in the list.
Indenting list items
After you create a list, you may want to indent one list item underneath 
another one. To indent an item in a list, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor anywhere in the text in the list item you want to 
indent.
 
2. Press the Home key to move the cursor to the front of the line.
 
3. Press the Tab key to indent an item to the right (or press the Shift+Tab 
keystroke combination to indent an item to the left).
 
 When you indent a list, Word changes the number or bullet style to set 
the line apart from the rest of your list.
Converting list items back into text
If you have a list, you may want to convert one or more items back into ordi-
nary text. To convert a list item into plain text, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the list items you want to convert into plain text.

99
 Chapter 6: Formatting Text
 
3. Click the appropriate Bullets, Numbering, or Outline Numbering icon.
 
 If you want to convert a bullet list item into text, click the Bullets icon.
Customizing a list
When you create a bullet or numbered list, you can choose from a variety of 
different styles. To choose a numbering style, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of a list icon, such as 
the Bullet or Numbering icon.
 
 Make sure that you don’t click the Numbering icon itself.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, listing all the different numbering styles 
available, as shown in Figure 6-8.
 
Figure 6-8:

2. Click the numbering style you want.
 
 The next time you click the Numbering icon, Word will use the number-
ing style you chose.
 
The changes you make to the numbering or bullet style will apply only to your 
current document.
Renumbering numbered lists
Number lists can cause special problems when dividing or copying them 
because the numbering may get out of sequence, or you may want to start 
numbering from a number other than one.

100
Part II: Working with Word 
To change the starting number of a numbered list, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the item that you want to renumber.
 
 If you want to renumber your entire list, right-click the first item at the 
top of the numbered list.
 
 A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 6-9.

• Restart at 1: Changes the numbering of the current list item to 1, 
the list item directly below to 2, and so on. (This option does not 
appear if you right-click the first item in a number list.)
 
• Continue Numbering: Changes the number of the current list item to 
one greater than the last numbered list item earlier in the 
document.
 
• Set Numbering Value: Displays the Set Numbering Value dialog box, 
shown in Figure 6-10, so you can change the current list item to a 
specific number such as 34 or 89.

Using the Ruler
When you create a document, Word creates page margins automatically. 
However, if you want to adjust the left and right page margins, or define how 
far the Tab key indents text, you need to use the Ruler.
By default, Word hides the Ruler to avoid cluttering up the screen. To display 
(or hide) the Ruler, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the View tab.
 
2. Select (or clear) the Ruler check box in the Show group.
 
 The ruler appears at the top and left margin of your document, as shown 
in Figure 6-11.

103
 Chapter 6: Formatting Text
Defining indentation with the Ruler
The two icons on the Ruler that define indentation are the First Line Indent 
and the Hanging Indent icons. The First Line Indent icon defines the position 
of (what else?) the first line of every paragraph. The Hanging Indent icon 
defines the position of every line of text except for the first line, as shown in 
Figure 6-13.
 
Figure 6-13: 
Drag the 
icons to set

2. Select any text.
 
3. Move the mouse pointer over the Left Indent icon on the Ruler, hold 
down the left mouse button, and drag (move) the mouse to the right.
 
 Word displays a dotted vertical line to show you where the new indenta-
tion margin will be.

right (or left).
 
 Word displays a dotted vertical line to show you where the new first line 
indentation will be.
 
6. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the position of 
the first line indent position.
Using Format Painter
Formatting can be simple, such as underlining text, or fairly complicated, 
such as underlining text while also changing its font and font size. After you 
format one chunk of text a certain way, you may want to format other parts 
of your document the exact same way.

104
Part II: Working with Word 
Although you could take time to format text manually, it’s much easier to use 
Format Painter instead. Format Painter tells Word, “See the way I formatted that 
chunk of text over there? Apply that same formatting to a new chunk of text.”
To use Format Painter, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text that contains the formatting you want to copy.
 
3. Click the Format Painter icon, as shown in Figure 6-14.
 
Figure 6-14: 
After you 
choose 
the Format 
Painter 
command, 
the mouse 
pointer 
turns into a 
paintbrush 
icon.

4. Select the text that you want to format. (Move the mouse pointer 
over the beginning of the text you want to format, hold down the left 
mouse button, and drag the mouse until you reach the end of the text 
you want to format.)
 
 Word applies your formatting to your selected text.
Using Styles
As an alternative to choosing fonts, font sizes, and text styles (like bold) indi-
vidually, Word offers several predefined formatting styles. To apply a style to 
your text, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text that you want to format.
 
3. Click the up/down arrows of the Styles scroll bar to scroll through the 
different styles available. Or click the More button to display a pull-
down menu of all the Quick Formatting styles, as shown in Figure 6-15.

105
 Chapter 6: Formatting Text
 
4. Move the mouse pointer over a style.
 
 Word displays what your text will look like if you choose this style.
 
5. Click the style you want to use, such as Heading 1, Title, or Quote.
 
 Word formats your text.
 
Figure 6-15: 
Clicking the 
More button 
displays a 
menu of all 
available 
styles.
 
Using Templates
In case you need to format an entire document a certain way, you may want 
to use templates instead. Templates act like preformatted documents. Word 
comes with several templates, but Microsoft offers several through its Web 
site as well.
To create a new document from a template, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab and then choose New.
 
 An Available Templates window appears, as shown in Figure 6-16.
 
2. Double-click on a template.
 
 Word creates a blank document with “dummy” text to show you how the 
formatting looks.
 
3. Type new text into your newly created document.
 
 You may need to be connected to the Internet to download some of the 
available templates.

Part II: Working with Word 
 
Figure 6-16: 
Templates 
let you cre-
ate a new

the format-
ting of an

Removing Formatting from Text
After you format text, you can always remove that formatting. The simplest 
way to do this is to apply the same formatting you want to remove. For exam-
ple, if you underline text, you can remove the underlining by highlighting all 
the underlined text and choosing the underline command (by pressing Ctrl+U 
or by clicking the Underline icon).
If you want to remove multiple formatting from text, you could remove 
each formatting style one by one, but it’s much easier just to use the Clear 
Formatting command instead, which removes all formatting on text no matter 
how much formatting there may be.
To use the Clear Formatting command, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Select the text that contains the formatting you want to remove.
 
3. Click the Clear Formatting icon, as shown in Figure 6-17.
 
 Word removes all formatting from your selected text.

Designing Your Pages
In This Chapter
▶ Inserting pages
▶ Organizing text in tables
▶ Displaying text as WordArt
▶ Creating text boxes
▶ Dividing text into columns
▶ Adding pictures
▶ Printing
T
he Insert and Page Layout tabs contain the most frequently used com-
mands for designing the layout and appearance of your pages. You can 
add columns or headers and footers that display titles or page numbers, or 
add colors and pictures to your pages.
The Insert tab provides commands for inserting items into a document, such 
as new pages, tables, pictures, and headers and footers.
The Page Layout tab provides commands for defining how your pages look, 
such as creating columns; defining top, bottom, left, and right page margins; 
as well as defining how text wraps around pictures or other objects you place 
in the middle of a page.
Inserting New Pages
Word automatically adds new pages to your document as you write. 
However, Word also gives you the option of adding a new page anywhere in 
your document, such as in the middle or the beginning.

110
Part II: Working with Word 
To insert a new, blank page in your document, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab.
 
2. Move the cursor where you want to insert the new page.
 
3. Click the Blank Page icon in the Pages group.
 
 Word adds a blank page to your document where the cursor appears. 
So if you put the cursor between two sentences and insert a blank page, 
the first sentence will appear on one page, a blank page will appear next, 
and the second sentence will appear after the blank page.
 
You don’t need to add a page to the end of a document. Just move the cursor 
to the end of your document (Ctrl+End), start typing, and Word automatically 
adds new pages at the end of your document.
Adding (And Deleting) a Cover Page
Rather than add more pages to type text, you may just need a cover page that 
is the first page that anyone can read. A cover page typically displays a title 
and any additional information such as your company name and a date. 
To create a cover page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab.
 
2. Click the Cover Page icon in the Pages group.
 
 Word displays a list of cover page designs, as shown in Figure 7-1.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Word can 
insert a 
variety of 
preformat-
ted cover 
pages into 
your docu-
ment.
 

111
 Chapter 7: Designing Your Pages
 
3. Click a cover page design.
 
 Word adds your chosen cover page as the first page of your document.
 
A document can have only one cover page at a time. If you choose another 
cover page, Word deletes your current cover page and replaces it with the 
new one you chose.
After you add a cover page, you may want to delete it later. To delete a cover 
page, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab.
 
2. Click Cover Page in the Pages group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 7-1).
 
3. Choose Remove Current Cover Page.
 
 Word deletes your cover page.
Inserting Page Breaks
Rather than insert a new page, you may want to break text on an existing 
page into two pages. To insert a page break in your document, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Move the cursor where you want to break your document into two 
pages.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click the Page Break icon in the Pages group.
 
 Word breaks your document into two pages.
 
To delete a page break, move the cursor to the top of the page directly follow-
ing the page break you want to delete. Then press Backspace.
 
As an alternative to following Steps 2 and 3 in the preceding step list, you can 
just press Ctrl+Enter to create a page break at the cursor’s current location.
Inserting Headers and Footers
Headers and footers appear at the top (headers) and bottom (footers) on one 
or more pages of your document. Headers and footers can display informa-
tion such as titles, chapter names, dates, and page numbers.

112
Part II: Working with Word 
Creating a header (or footer)
To create a header or footer, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab.
 
2. Click the Header or Footer icon in the Header & Footer group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
3. Click Edit Header (or Edit Footer).
 
 Word displays your header or footer.
 
 You can click on a predefined header (or footer) that’s already format-
ted to look pretty so you don’t have to spend time formatting it yourself.
 
 Headers and footers are visible only when you display a document in 
Print Layout view.
 
4. Type, edit, or delete any text you want to change.
 
5. (Optional) Click the Date & Time or Page Number icons of the 
Design contextual tools to insert the date and time or page numbers, 
respectively.
 
6. Click the Close Header and Footer icon.
 
 Word dims your header and footer text.
Defining which pages to display 
a header (or footer)
Usually when you define a header or footer, Word displays that header or 
footer on every page of your document. However, Word gives you the option 
of displaying a different header and footer for your first page only, or display-
ing different headers and footers for odd and even pages.
Creating a unique header or footer for your first page
Often, you want a header or footer to display page numbers and document 
or chapter titles — just not on the first page of your document. To create a 
unique header or footer that appears only on your first page, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab, click the Header icon in the Header & Footer 
group, and choose Edit Header.
 
 The Design tab appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.

113
 Chapter 7: Designing Your Pages
 
Figure 7-2: 
The Design 
tab provides 
additional 
commands 
for modify-

2. Select the Different First Page check box in the Options group.
 
 Word displays a header or footer with the name First Page Header 
or First Page Footer.
 
3. Click the Close Header and Footer icon.
 
 Word dims your header and footer text.
Creating unique headers and footers for odd and even pages
Sometimes you may want different headers or footers to appear on even or 
odd pages. In most books, even page numbers (headers) appear in the upper-
left corner while odd page numbers (headers) appear in the upper-right 
corner. To create this effect in your own documents, you need to create dif-
ferent headers to appear on odd and even pages.
To create a different header or footer for even and odd numbered pages, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab, click the Header icon in the Header & Footer 
group, and choose Edit Header.
 
 The Design tab appears.

114
Part II: Working with Word 
 
2. Select the Different Odd & Even Pages check box in the Options 
group.
 
 Word displays a header or footer with the name Odd Page Header or 
Even Page Footer.
 
3. Click the Close Header and Footer icon.
 
4. Switch to another page.
 
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 to define the other odd or even header.
 
 If an odd page number originally appeared in Step 2, switch to an even 
page number (or vice versa) for Step 5.
Deleting a header (or footer)
In case you want to get rid of a header or footer, you can always delete it by 
following these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab.
 
2. Click the Header or Footer icon in the Header & Footer group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
3. Click Remove Header (or Remove Footer).
 
 Word removes your header or footer.
Organizing Text in Tables
Tables organize text into rows and columns, which can make it easy to type, 
edit, and format text while spacing it correctly in your document. Tables 
organize text in cells, where a cell is the intersection of a row and a column.
Word provides four ways to create a table:
 
✓ Click the Insert tab, click the Table icon, and then highlight the number 
of rows and columns for your table (up to a maximum of eight rows and 
ten columns).
 
✓ Use the Insert Table dialog box.
 
✓ Draw the size and position of the table with the mouse.
 
✓ Convert existing text (divided by a delimiter character such as a Tab 
or comma).

 If you need to draw new lines on a table later, click anywhere inside that 
table and the Design tab appears. Then click the Draw Table icon to turn 
the mouse pointer into a pencil icon. Now you can draw new lines in 
your table.
Creating a table from existing text
If you have existing text that you’d like to turn into a table, you need to first 
separate text into chunks so Word knows how to place the text into indi-
vidual cells in a table. To separate text, you need to use a unique character 
such as
 
✓ Paragraphs: The invisible Return character separates text.
 
✓ Tabs: The invisible Tab character separates text.
 
✓ Commas: Commas separates text.
 
✓ Other: You can define other characters to separate text, such as the # 
or @ characters.
By dividing text with the same unique character, you can define how you 
want Word to define how much text to display in each individual cell of a 
table, as shown in Figure 7-6.

 Chapter 7: Designing Your Pages
Formatting and Coloring a Table
After you create a table, you can format individual cells (the intersection of a 
row and column) or entire rows and columns by aligning text in cells, resizing 
columns and rows, and adding borders, shading, or colors, all of which can 
make the text inside easier to read.
Selecting all or part of a table
To format and color a table, you must first select the table, row, column, 
or cell that you want to modify. To select all or part of a table, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click in the table, row, column, or cell you want to modify.
 
 The Table Tools tab appears.
 
2. Click the Layout tab.
 
3. Click Select in the Table group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 7-10.
 
Figure 7-10: 
The Select 
icon 
displays a 
pull-down 
menu.
 
 
4. Choose an option, such as Select Row or Select Column.
 
 Word highlights your chosen item in the table.
Aligning text in a table cell
You can align text in a table cell in nine different ways: Top Left (the default 
alignment), Top Center, Top Right, Center Left, Center, Center Right, Bottom 
Left, Bottom Center, and Bottom Right, as shown in Figure 7-11.

122
Part II: Working with Word 
 
Figure 7-11: 
Tables can 
align text 
within cells 
in nine dif-
ferent ways.
 
To align one or more cells, follow these steps:
 
1. Click in the cell that contains text you want to align.
 
 The Table Tools tab appears.
 
2. Click the Layout tab.
 
3. Click an alignment icon in the Alignment group (refer to Figure 7-11) 
such as Top Right or Bottom Center.
 
 Word aligns your text. If you changed the alignment of blank cells, any 
new text you type in those blank cells will appear according to the align-
ment you chose.
Picking a table style
By coloring rows or columns and adding borders, you can customize the 
appearance of your tables. However, it can be much faster to use a prede-
signed table style instead, which can automatically format your text, color 
rows, and add borders to your tables.
To choose a table style, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor inside the table you want to modify.
 
2. Click the Design tab.
 
3. (Optional) Click or clear check boxes under the Table Style Options 
group, such as the Header Row or Last Column check box.

123
 Chapter 7: Designing Your Pages
 
4. Click the More button on the Table Styles group.
 
 A pull-down menu of all available styles appears, as shown in Figure 7-12.

Styles group 
displays dif-
ferent ways 
to format 
your table.
 
 
5. Click a table style.
 
 Word formats your table according to the style you chose.
Resizing columns and rows
You may need to resize a column or row in your table to expand or shrink it 
so your text doesn’t appear crowded or surrounded by empty space. You can 
resize a column or row by using the mouse or by defining row heights and 
column widths.
To resize a row or column with the mouse, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the mouse over the row or column border that you want to 
resize.
 
 The mouse pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow.

124
Part II: Working with Word 
 
2. Hold the left mouse button down and drag (move) the mouse to resize 
the row or column.
 
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the size of the 
row or column.
Using the mouse to resize a row or column can be fast, but if you want to 
resize a row or column to a specific height or width, you can type in the spe-
cific dimensions by following these steps:
 
1. Select the row, column, or table that you want to modify. (If you select 
the entire table, you can adjust the width or height of rows and col-
umns for your entire table.)
 
2. Click the Layout tab and look in the Cell Size group.
 
 If you want to define the width or height of multiple rows or columns 
equally, either
 
• Click the Distribute Columns or Distribute Rows icon in the Cell 
Size group. 
 
• Click the Show Table Properties icon in the bottom-right corner of 
the Cell Size group to display the Table Properties dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 7-13.

adjust the 
size of col-
umns and 
rows.
 
 
3. To precisely define a column’s width, click the Width list box and type 
a value (or click the up/down arrows to choose a value).

125
 Chapter 7: Designing Your Pages
 
4. To precisely define a row’s height, click the Height list box and type a 
value (or click the up/down arrows to choose a value).
 
5. (Optional) Click AutoFit and choose one of the following:
 
• AutoFit Contents: Shrinks your columns or rows to largest cell
 
• AutoFit Window: Expands the table to fit the width of the current 
document window
Sorting a Table
Tables not only can organize data, but they can also sort your data alpha-
betically. To sort a table, you need to specify a single column of data to sort. 
When Word sorts the data in this column, it automatically sorts every row in 
the table as well, as shown in Figure 7-14.
 
Figure 7-14: 
Sorting data 
in a column 
rearranges 
every row in 
a table.

specify 
whether 
to sort by 
ascending 
or descend-
ing order.
 
 
4. Click in the top Type list box and choose the type of data you want to 
sort: Text, Number, or Date.
 
5. Select either the Ascending or Descending radio button.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Word sorts your entire table based on the data in the column you 
selected.
Deleting Tables
After you create a table, you can delete the entire table, delete one or more 
rows or columns, or just delete individual cells along with their data.
Deleting an entire table
Word gives you two choices in deleting a table. First, you can wipe out just 
the data inside the table while leaving the table itself intact. Second, you can 
wipe out both the data and the table at the same time.

127
 Chapter 7: Designing Your Pages
To delete just the data in a table, follow these steps:
 
1. Select every row and column in the table.
 
2. Press Delete.
 
 Word wipes out all your data and leaves an empty table.
To delete both your table and all the data stored in it at the same time, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor into the table you want to wipe out.
 
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
 
3. Click the Delete icon in the Rows & Columns group.

Deleting cells
You can delete data in cells just by selecting the data and pressing the Delete 
key. If you want to delete data and the cell itself, you have two options:
 
✓ Delete a cell and shift adjacent rows or columns. This creates an odd-
shaped table.
 
✓ Delete the data and cell borders. This keeps the table symmetrical but 
often merges cells.
To delete a cell and change the physical layout of a table, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell or cells you want to delete.
 
2. Click the Layout tab under the Table Tools tab.
 
3. Click the Delete icon in the Rows & Columns group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 7-16).

 Word deletes the selected cell lines and any data stored in adja-
cent cells.
 
5. Press Esc or double-click the mouse to turn off the Eraser and convert 
the mouse pointer back into an I-beam cursor.
Making Text Look Artistic
To spice up the appearance of individual paragraphs, Word lets you add drop 
caps, text boxes, or WordArt. Drop caps make the first letter of a paragraph 
appear huge. WordArt displays text as graphical images. Text boxes let you 
display chunks of text in separate boxes that you can arrange anywhere in 
your document.

Before you print your document, you may want to preview how it will look 
so you don’t waste paper printing something you can’t use anyway. After 
you see that your pages will look perfect, then you can finally print out your 
document for everyone to read.
Defining page size and orientation
If you need to print your document on different sizes of paper, you may need 
to define the page size and paper orientation. By doing this, Word can accu-
rately show you what your text may look like when printed on an 8.5" x 11" 
page compared with an 8.27" x 11.69" page.
To define the Page Size, follow these steps:

Playing the 
Numbers with 
Excel

In this part . . .
I
f you need to manipulate numbers for business, scien-
tific, or financial reasons, you can use the most popu-
lar spreadsheet program in the world – Microsoft Excel. 
Anyone who has used another version of Excel in the past 
will find that Excel 2010 simply provides easier access to 
the complicated features buried within Excel’s silicon 
brain.
For anyone not familiar with Excel or spreadsheet pro-
grams at all, this part of the book starts with the basics by 
explaining what a spreadsheet does, how they work, and 
the parts you’ll need to create your own spreadsheet 
within Excel.
After you get comfortable with Excel, additional chapters 
show you how to create formulas to make Excel do all its 
fancy (and accurate) calculations and convert your rows 
and columns of numbers into easy to understand pie, line, 
and bar charts.  
Think of Excel as your personal calculating machine. Just 
feed it numbers, define formulas, and Excel cranks 
through your numbers to spit out different results so you 
can forecast trends, analyze past results, or play “What 
if?” games with your numbers such as asking, “What if I 
gave myself a 25 percent raise and laid off 3,000 employ-
ees? How would that affect my stock options by increas-
ing profits in the short-term?” 
Calculating numbers can be fun, especially when those 
numbers represent profits and losses. With the help of 
Excel, you can maximize your profits and minimize your 
losses, or at least have fun fantasizing about different 
results by playing around with Excel.

E
veryone needs to perform simple math. Businesses need to keep track 
of sales and profits, and individuals need to keep track of budgets. In the 
old days, people not only had to write down numbers on paper, but they also 
had to do all their calculations by hand (or with the aid of a calculator).
That’s why people use Excel. Instead of writing numbers on paper, they can 
type numbers on the computer. Instead of adding or subtracting columns or 
rows of numbers by hand, Excel can do it for you automatically. Basically, 
Excel makes it easy to type and modify numbers and then calculate new 
results accurately and quickly.
 
Besides calculating numbers, spreadsheets can also store lists of data orga-
nized in rows and columns.
Understanding Spreadsheets
Excel organizes numbers in rows and columns. An entire page of rows and 
columns is called a spreadsheet or a worksheet. (A collection of one or more 
worksheets is stored in a file called a workbook.) Each row is identified by a 

140
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
number such as 1 or 249; and each column is identified by letters, such as A, 
G, or BF. The intersection of each row and column defines a cell, which con-
tains one of three items:
 
✓ Numbers
 
✓ Text (labels)
 
✓ Formulas
Numbers provide the data, and formulas calculate that data to produce a 
useful result, such as adding sales results for the week. Of course, just dis-
playing numbers on the screen may be confusing if you don’t know what 
those numbers mean, so labels simply identify what numbers represent. 
Figure 8-1 shows the parts of a typical spreadsheet.
 
Formulas usually appear as numbers, so at first glance, it may be difficult to 
tell the difference between ordinary numbers and numbers that represent a 
calculation by a formula.
The strength of spreadsheets comes by playing “What-if?” games with your 
data, such as “What if I gave myself a $20-per-hour raise and cut everyone 
else’s salary by 25%? How much money would that save the company every 
month?” Because spreadsheets can rapidly calculate new results, you can 
experiment with different numbers to see how they create different answers.

To type data in a single cell, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose one of the following to select a single cell:
 
• Click a cell.
 
• Press the up/down/right/left arrow keys to highlight a cell.
 
2. Type a number (such as 34.29 or 198), a label (such as Tax Returns), or 
a formula.
 
 You can see how to create formulas in Chapter 9.
Typing data in multiple cells
After you type data in a cell, you can press one of the following four key-
strokes to select a different cell:
 
✓ Enter: Selects the cell below in the same column
 
✓ Tab: Selects the cell to the right in the same row
 
✓ Shift+Enter: Selects the cell above in the same column
 
✓ Shift+Tab: Selects the cell to the left in the same row
If you type data in cell A1 and press Enter, Excel selects the next cell below, 
which is A2. If you type data in A2 and press Tab, Excel selects the cell to the 
right, which is B2.
However, what if you want to type data in a cell such as A1 and then have 
Excel select the next cell to the right (B1)? Or what if you want to type data in 
cells A1 and A2 but then jump back to type additional data in cells B1 and B2?
To make this easy, Excel lets you select a range of cells, which essentially 
tells Excel, “See all the cells I just highlighted? I only want to type data in 
those cells.” After you select multiple cells, you can type data and press 

142
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
Enter. Excel selects the next cell down in that same column. When Excel 
reaches the last cell in the column, it selects the top cell of the column to the 
right.
To select multiple cells for typing data in, follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight multiple cells by choosing one of the following:
 
• Move the mouse pointer over a cell, hold down the left mouse 
button, and drag (move) the mouse to highlight multiple cells. 
Release the left mouse button when you’ve selected enough cells.
 
• Hold down the Shift key and press the up/down/right/left arrow 
keys to highlight multiple cells. Release the Shift key when you’ve 
selected enough cells.
 
 Excel selects the cell that appears in the upper-left corner of your 
selected cells.
 
2. Type a number, label, or formula.
 
3. Press Enter.
 
 Excel selects the cell directly below the preceding cell. If the preceding 
cell appeared at the bottom of the selected column, Excel highlights the 
top cell in the column that appears to the right.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until you fill your selected cells with data.
 
5. Click outside the selected cells or press an arrow key to tell Excel not 
to select the cells any more.
Typing in sequences with AutoFill
If you need to type the names of successive months or days in a row or 
column (such as January, February, March, and so on), Excel offers a short-
cut to save you from typing all the day or month names yourself. With this 
shortcut, you just type one month or day and then drag the mouse to high-
light all the adjacent cells. Then Excel types the rest of the month or day 
names in those cells automatically.
To use this shortcut, follow these steps:
 
1. Click a cell and type a month (like January or just Jan) or a day (like 
Monday or just Mon).
 
 The Fill Handle, a block box, appears in the bottom-right corner of the 
cell.

143
 Chapter 8: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas
 
 You can also type in a sequence of numbers in Step 1. So if you typed 
the numbers 2, 4, and 6 in adjacent cells, highlighted all these adjacent 
cells, and grabbed the Fill Handle, Excel is smart enough to detect the 
pattern and display the numbers 8, 10, and 12 in the next three adjacent 
cells.
 
2. Move the mouse pointer over the Fill Handle until the mouse pointer 
turns into a black crosshair icon.
 
3. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse down a 
column or across the row.
 
 As you drag the mouse, Excel automatically types in the remaining 
month or day names, as shown in Figure 8-2.
 
Figure 8-2: 
By drag-
ging the 
Fill Handle, 
Excel auto-
matically 
enters the 
names of 
the month 
or days.
 
Formatting Numbers and Labels
When you first create a spreadsheet, numbers and labels appear as plain 
text. Plain labels might look boring, but plain numbers (such as 8495 or 0.39) 
can be difficult to read and understand if the numbers are supposed to repre-
sent currency amounts ($8,495) or percentages (39%).

144
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
To make labels visually interesting and numbers appear more descriptive of 
what they actually represent, you need to format your data after you type it 
into a spreadsheet.
 
You can format a cell or range of cells after you’ve already typed in data or 
before you type in any data. If you format cells before typing any data, any 
data you type in will appear in your chosen format.
Formatting numbers
To format the appearance of numbers, follow these steps:
 
1. Select one or more cells by using the mouse or keyboard.
 
 To select multiple cells, drag the mouse or hold the Shift key while 
pressing the arrow keys.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the Number Format list box in the Number group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
Figure 8-3: 
The Number 
Format list 
box lists the 
different 
ways you 
can format 
the appear-
ance of 
numbers.
 
 
 The Number group also displays three icons that let you format num-
bers as Currency, Percentage, or with Commas in one click, as shown 
in Figure 8-4. If you click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of 
the Accounting Number Format icon, you can choose different currency 
symbols to use, such as $, £, or €.

145
 Chapter 8: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas
 
4. Click a number format style, such as Percentage or Scientific.
 
 Excel displays your numbers in your chosen format.

Displaying negative numbers
Because many people use spreadsheets for business, they often want nega-
tive numbers to appear highlighted so they can see them easier. Excel can 
display negative numbers in parentheses (–23) or in red so you can’t miss 
them.
To define how negative numbers appear in your spreadsheet, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the cell or range of cells that you want to modify.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the Format icon in the Cells group.
 
 A menu appears, as shown in Figure 8-5.
 
4. Choose Format Cells.
 
 The Format Cells dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-6.
 
5. Choose Currency or Number from the Category list.
 
 You can choose how to format negative numbers only if you format your 
numbers by using the Currency or Number category.
 
6. Click a negative number format and then click OK.
 
 If any of your numbers become negative in the cell or cells you selected 
in Step 1, Excel automatically displays those negative numbers in the 
negative number format you chose.

Formatting decimal numbers
If you format cells to display numbers with decimal places, such as 23.09 or 
23.09185, you can modify how many decimal places appear. To define the 
number of decimal places, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell or cells that contain the numbers you want to format.
 
2. Click the Home tab.

147
 Chapter 8: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas
 
3. Click in the Number Format list box (refer to Figure 8-3) and choose a 
format that displays decimal places, such as Number or Percentage.
 
 Excel formats the numbers in your chosen cells.
 
You can click the Increase Decimal (increases the number of decimal places 
displayed) or Decrease Decimal icon (decreases the number of decimal places 
displayed) in the Number group on the Home tab, as shown in Figure 8-7.

Formatting cells
To make your data look prettier, Excel can format the appearance of cells 
to change the font, background color, text color, or font size used to display 
data in a cell.
Excel provides two ways to format cells: You can use Excel’s built-in format-
ting styles, or you can apply different types of formatting individually. Some 
of the individual formatting styles you can choose include
 
✓ Font and font size
 
✓ Text styles (underlining, italic, and bold)
 
✓ Text and background color
 
✓ Borders
 
✓ Alignment
 
✓ Text wrapping and orientation

148
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
Formatting cells with built-in styles
Excel provides a variety of predesigned formatting styles that you can apply 
to one or more cells. To format cells with a built-in style, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell or cells that you want to format with a built-in style.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the Cell Styles icon in the Styles group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears listing all the different styles you can choose, 
as shown in Figure 8-8.
 
4. Move the mouse pointer over a style.
 
 Excel displays a Live Preview of how your selected cells will look with 
that particular style.
 
5. Click the style you want.
 
 Excel applies your chosen style to the selected cells.
 
Figure 8-8: 
The Cell 
Styles menu 
offers dif-
ferent ways 
to format 
your cells

Formatting fonts and text styles
Different fonts can emphasize parts of your spreadsheet, such as using one 
font to label columns and rows and another font or font size to display the 
actual data. Text styles (bold, underline, and italic) can also emphasize data 
that appears in the same font or font size.
To change the font, font size, and text style of one or more cells, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the cell or cells that you want to change the font and font size.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the Font list box.
 
 A pull-down menu of different fonts appears.

149
 Chapter 8: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas
 
4. Click the font you want to use.

• Click the Increase Font Size or Decrease Font Size icon until your 
data appears in the size you want.
 
6. Click one or more text style icons (Bold, Italic, Underline).
Formatting with color
Each cell displays data in a Font color and a Fill color. The Font color defines 
the color of the numbers and letters that appear inside a cell. (The default 
Font color is black.) The Fill color defines the color that fills the background 
of the cell. (The default Fill color is white.)
To change the Font and Fill colors of cells, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell or cells that you want to color.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the 
Font Color icon.
 
 A color palette appears, as shown in Figure 8-9.
 
4. Click the color you want to use for your text.
 
 The color you select appears directly on the Font Color icon. The next 
time you want to apply this same color to a cell, you can click the Font 
Color icon directly instead of the downward-pointing arrow to the right 
of the Font Color icon.

Navigating a Spreadsheet
If you have a large spreadsheet, chances are good that information may be 
hidden by the limitations of your computer screen. To help you view and 
select cells in different parts of your spreadsheet, Excel offers various ways 
to navigate a spreadsheet by using the mouse and keyboard.
Using the mouse to move 
around in a spreadsheet
To navigate a spreadsheet with the mouse, you can click the scroll bars or 
use the scroll wheel, on your mouse, if you have one. To use the scroll bars, 
you have three choices:
 
✓ Click the up/down or right/left arrows on the horizontal or vertical 
scroll bars.
 
 This moves the spreadsheet one row (up or down) or column (right or 
left) at a time.
 
✓ Drag the scroll box of a scroll bar.
 
✓ Click the scroll area (any area to the left/right or above/below the 
scroll box on the scroll bar).
 
 This moves the spreadsheet one screen left/right or up/down.
If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can use this wheel to move through a 
spreadsheet by two methods:
 
✓ Roll the mouse’s scroll wheel up or down to scroll your spreadsheet up 
or down.
 
✓ Press the scroll wheel to display a four-way pointing arrow, and then 
move the mouse up, down, right, or left. (When you’re done, click the 
scroll wheel again.)
Using the keyboard to move 
around a spreadsheet
Using the mouse can be faster to jump from one place in a spreadsheet to 
another, but sometimes using the mouse can be frustrating, trying to line it 
up just right. For that reason, you can also use the keyboard to move around 
a spreadsheet. Some of the common ways to move around a spreadsheet are 
shown in Table 8-1.

If you know the specific cell you want to move to, you can jump to that cell 
by using the Go To command. To use the Go To command, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Find & Select icon in the Editing group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
3. Click Go To.
 
 The Go To dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-11.

153
 Chapter 8: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas
 
Figure 8-11: 
The Go To 
dialog box 
lets you 
jump to a 
specific cell.
 
Naming cells
One problem with the Go To command is that most people won’t know which 
cell contains the data they want to find. For example, if you want to view the 
cell that contains the total amount of money you owe for your income taxes, 
you probably don’t want to memorize that this cell is G68.
To help you identify certain cells, Excel lets you give them descriptive names. 
To name a cell or range of cells, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell or cells that you want to name.
 
2. Click in the Name box, which appears directly above the A column 
heading, as shown in Figure 8-12.
 
3. Type a descriptive name without any spaces and then press Enter.

After you name a cell, you can jump to it quickly by following these steps:
 
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Name box.
 
 A list of named cells appears.
 
2. Click the named cell you want to view.
 
 Excel displays your chosen cell.
Eventually, you may want to edit or delete a name for your cells. To delete or 
edit a name, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Formulas tab.
 
2. Click the Name Manager icon.
 
 The Name Manager dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-13.
 
3. Edit or delete the named cell as follows:
 
• To edit the name, click the cell name you want to edit and then 
click the Edit button. An Edit Name dialog box appears, where you 
can change the name or the cell reference.
 
• To delete the name, click the cell name you want to delete and 
then click the Delete button.
 
4. Click Close.

 Chapter 8: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas
Searching a Spreadsheet
Rather than search for a specific cell, you may want to search for a particular 
label or number in a spreadsheet. Excel lets you search for the following:
 
✓ Specific text or numbers
 
✓ All cells that contain formulas
 
✓ All cells that contain conditional formatting
Searching for text
You can search for a specific label or number anywhere in your spreadsheet. 
To search for text or numbers, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Find & Select icon in the Editing group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
3. Click Find.
 
 The Find and Replace dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-14.
 
 If you click the Replace tab, you can define the text or number to find 
and new text or numbers to replace it.
 
4. Click in the Find What text box and type the text or number you want 
to find.
 
Figure 8-14: 
The Find 
and Replace 
dialog box 
lets you 
search your 
worksheet.
 

156
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
 
 If you click the Options button, the Find and Replace dialog box expands 
to provide additional options for searching, such as searching in the dis-
played sheet or the entire workbook.
 
5. Click one of the following:
 
• Find Next: Finds and selects the first cell, starting from the cur-
rently selected cell that contains the text you typed in Step 4
 
• Find All: Finds and lists all cells that contain the text you typed in 
Step 4, as shown in Figure 8-15
 
6. Click Close to make the Find and Replace dialog box go away.
 
Figure 8-15: 
The Find 
All button 
names all 
the cells 
that contain 
the text or 
number you 
want to find.
 
Searching for formulas
Formulas appear just like numbers; to help you find which cells contain for-
mulas, Excel gives you two choices:
 
✓ Display formulas in your cells (instead of numbers)
 
✓ Highlight the cells that contain formulas
To display formulas in a spreadsheet, press Ctrl+` (an accent grave charac-
ter, which appears on the same key as the ~ sign and often appears to the left 
of the number 1 key near the top of a keyboard). Figure 8-16 shows what a 
spreadsheet looks like when formulas appear inside of cells.
To highlight all cells that contain formulas, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Find & Select icon in the Editing group.

Editing a Spreadsheet
The two ways to edit a spreadsheet are
 
✓ Edit the data itself, such as the labels, numbers, and formulas that make 
up a spreadsheet.
 
✓ Edit the physical layout of the spreadsheet, such as adding or deleting 
rows and columns, or widening or shrinking the width or height of rows 
and columns.
Editing data in a cell
To edit data in a single cell, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the cell that contains the data you want to edit.
 
 Excel displays a cursor in your selected cell.
 
2. Edit your data by using the Backspace or Delete key, or by typing new 
data.
 
If you click a cell, Excel displays the contents of that cell in the Formula bar. 
You can click and edit data directly in the Formula bar, which can be more 
convenient for editing large amounts of data such as a formula.

158
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
Changing the size of rows and 
columns with the mouse
Using the mouse can be a quick way to modify the sizes of rows and columns. 
To change the height of a row or the width of a column, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the mouse pointer over the bottom line of a row heading, such 
as the 2 or 18 heading. (Or move the mouse pointer over the right line 
of the column heading, such as A or D.)
 
 The mouse pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow.
 
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse.
 
 Excel resizes your row or column.
 
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the size of your 
row or column.
Typing the size of rows and columns
If you need to resize a row or column to a precise value, it’s easier to type 
a specific value into the Row Height or Column Width dialog box instead. 
To type a value into a Row Height or Column Width dialog box, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the row or column heading that you want to resize.
 
 Excel highlights your entire row or column.
 
3. Click the Format icon that appears in the Cells group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 8-17.
 
4. Click Height (if you selected a row) or Width (if you selected a 
column).
 
 The Row Height or Column Width dialog box appears.
 
5. Type a value and then click OK.
 
 Excel resizes your row or column.
 
Excel measures column width in characters. (A cell defined as 1 character 
width can display a single letter or number.) Excel measures row height by 
points where 1 point equals 1⁄72 inch.

ize that you need to add or delete extra rows or columns. To add a row or 
column, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the row or column heading where you want to add another row 
or column.
 
 Excel highlights the entire row or column.
 
3. Click the Insert icon in the Cells group.
 
 Inserting a row adds a new row above the selected row. Inserting a 
column adds a new column to the left of the selected column.
To delete a row or column, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the row or column heading that you want to delete.
 
3. Click the Delete icon in the Cells group.
 
Deleting a row or column deletes any data stored in that row or column.

2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse.
 
 The downward-pointing black arrow points where Excel will place your 
sheet.
 
3. Release the left mouse button to place your sheet in a new order.
Deleting a sheet
Using multiple sheets may be handy, but you may want to delete a sheet if 
you don’t need it.
 
If you delete a sheet, you also delete all the data stored on that sheet.
To delete a sheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the sheet that you want to delete.
 
2. Choose one of the following:
 
• Right-click the tab of the sheet you want to delete. When a pop-up

Printing Workbooks
After you create a spreadsheet, you can print it out for others to see. When 
printing spreadsheets, you need to take special care how your spreadsheet 
appears on a page because a large spreadsheet will likely get printed on two 
or more sheets of paper.
This can cause problems if an entire spreadsheet prints on a one page but a 
single row of numbers appears on a second page, which can make reading 
and understanding your spreadsheet data confusing. When printing spread-
sheets, take time to align your data so that it prints correctly on every page.
Using Page Layout view
Excel can display your spreadsheets in two ways: Normal view and Page 
Layout view. Normal view is the default appearance, which simply fills your 
screen with rows and columns so you can see as much of your spreadsheet 
as possible.
Page Layout view displays your spreadsheet exactly as it will appear if you 
print it. Not only can you see where your page breaks occur, but you can also 
add any headers to the top of your spreadsheet.
To switch back and forth from Normal view to Page Layout view, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the View tab.
 
2. Click the Normal or Page Layout View icon in the Workbook Views 
group, as shown in Figure 8-20.
 
You can also click the Normal or Page Layout View icons in the bottom-right 
corner of the Excel window.

the bottom 
and sides 
of your 
spread-
sheet.
 
Adding a header (or footer)
Headers and footers are useful when printing out your spreadsheet. A header 
may explain the information in the spreadsheet, such as 2012 Tax Return 
Information, and a footer may display page numbers. To create a header or 
footer, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Insert tab.
 
2. Click the Header & Footer icon in the Text group.
 
 Excel displays the Design tab and creates a text box for your header and 
footer, as shown in Figure 8-21.
 
Figure 8-21: 
The Design 
tab provides 
tools for 
creating a 
header or 
footer.
 

165
 Chapter 8: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas
 
3. Type your header text in the header text box.
 
4. Click the Go To Footer icon in the Navigation group.
 
 Excel displays your footer text box.
 
5. Type your footer text in the footer text box.
 
If you switch to Page Layout view, you can click directly in the header or 
footer box at the top or bottom of the page.
Printing gridlines
Gridlines appear on the screen to help you align data in rows and columns. 
However, when you print your worksheet, you can choose to omit gridlines 
or print them to make your data easier to understand.
To print gridlines and/or row and column headings, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
 
2. (Optional) Select the Print check box under the Gridlines category.
 
3. (Optional) Select the Print check box under the Heading category.
Defining a print area
Sometimes you may not want to print your entire spreadsheet but just a 
certain part of it, called the print area. To define the print area, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the cells that you want to print.
 
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
 
3. Click the Print Area icon in the Page Setup group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 8-22.
 
Figure 8-22: 
The Print 
Area menu 
lets you 
define or

4. Choose Set Print Area.
 
 Excel displays a dotted line around your print area.
 
5. Click the File tab and then click Print.
 
 A print preview image of your chosen print area appears.
 
6. Click Print.
 
After you define a print area, you can see which cells are part of your print 
area by clicking the downward-pointing arrow of the Name box and choosing 
Print_Area.
 
After you define a print area, you can always add to it by following these steps:
 
1. Select the cells adjacent to the print area.
 
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
 
3. Click the Print Area icon in the Page Setup group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
4. Choose Add to Print Area.
 
 Excel displays a dotted line around your newly defined print area.
After you define the print area, you can always remove it by following these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
 
2. Click Print Area.
 
 A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 8-22).
 
3. Choose Clear Print Area.
Inserting (and removing) page breaks
One problem with large spreadsheets is that when you print them out, parts 
may get cut off when printed on separate pages. To correct this problem, you 
can tell Excel exactly where page breaks should occur.
To insert page breaks, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the cursor in the cell to define where the vertical and horizontal 
page breaks will appear.
 
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
 
3. Click the Breaks icon in the Page Setup group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 8-23.

167
 Chapter 8: The Basics of Spreadsheets: Numbers, Labels, and Formulas
 
Figure 8-23: 
The Breaks 
menu lets 
you insert a 
page break.
 
 
4. Choose Insert Page Break.
 
 Excel inserts a horizontal page directly above the cell you selected in 
Step 1 and a vertical page break to the left of that cell, too.
To remove a page break, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose one of the following:
 
• To remove a horizontal page break: Click in any cell that appears 
directly below that horizontal page break.
 
• To remove a vertical page break: Click in any cell that appears 
directly to the right of that horizontal page break.
 
• To remove both a vertical and horizontal page break: Click in the 
cell that appears to the right of the vertical page break and directly 
underneath the horizontal page break.
 
2. Click the Page Layout tab.
 
3. Click the Breaks icon in the Page Setup group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears (refer to Figure 8-23).
 
4. Choose Remove Page Break.
 
 Excel removes your chosen page break.
Printing row and column headings
If you have a large spreadsheet that fills two or more pages, Excel may print 
your spreadsheet data on separate pages. Although the first page may print 
your labels to identify what each row and column may represent, any addi-
tional pages that Excel prints won’t bear those same identifying labels. As a 
result, you may wind up printing rows and columns of numbers without any 
labels that identify what those numbers mean.

168
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
To fix this problem, you can define labels to print on every page by following 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
 
2. Click the Print Titles icon in the Page Setup group.
 
 The Page Setup dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-24.
 
Figure 8-24:

a printed page.
 
Figure 8-25: 
The Margins 
icon lists 
different 
predefined 
margins you 
can choose.
 
Defining paper orientation and size
Paper orientation can be either landscape (the paper width is greater than its 
height) or portrait mode (the paper width is less than its height). Paper size 
defines the physical dimensions of the page.
To change the paper orientation and size, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Page Layout tab.
 
2. Click the Orientation icon in the Page Setup group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.

W
hat makes Excel useful is its ability to manipulate data by using for-
mulas. Formulas can be as simple as adding two or more numbers 
together or as complicated as calculating a second-order differential equation.
Formulas use data, stored in other cells, to calculate a new result that 
appears in another cell. To create even more complicated spreadsheets, you 
can even make a formula use data from other formulas so that changes in a 
single cell can ripple throughout an entire spreadsheet.
Creating a Formula
Formulas consist of three crucial bits of information:
 
✓ An equal sign (=)
 
✓ One or more cell references
 
✓ The type of calculation to do on the data (addition, subtraction, and so on)
A cell reference is simply the unique row and column heading that identifies 
a single cell, such as A4 or D9. The four common calculations that a formula 
can use are addition (+), subtraction (–), multiplication (*), and division (/). 
Table 9-1 lists other mathematical operators you can use in a formula.

A simple formula uses a single mathematical operator and two cell references 
such as:
=A4+C7
This formula consists of three parts:
 
✓ The = sign: This identifies your formula. If you type just A4+C7 into a 
cell, Excel treats it as ordinary text.
 
✓ Two cell references: In this example, A4 and C7.
 
✓ The addition (+) mathematical operator.
To type a formula in a cell, follow these steps:
 
1. Click in the cell where you want to store the formula.
 
 You can also select a cell by pressing the arrow keys.
 
 Excel highlights your selected cell.

173
 Chapter 9: Playing with Formulas
 
2. Type the equal sign (=).
 
 This tells Excel that you are creating a formula.
 
3. Type your formula that includes one or more cell references that iden-
tify cells that contain data, such as A4 or E8.
 
 For example, if you want to add the numbers stored in cells A4 and E8, 
you would type =A4+E8.
 
4. Press Enter.
 
Typing cell references can get cumbersome because you have to match the 
row and column headings of a cell correctly. As a faster alternative, you can 
use the mouse to click any cell that contains data; then Excel types that cell 
reference into your formula automatically.
To use the mouse to click cell references when creating a formula, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click in the cell where you want to store the formula. (You can also 
select the cell by pressing the arrow keys.)
 
 Excel highlights your selected cell.
 
2. Type the equal sign (=).
 
 This tells Excel that anything you type after the equal sign is part of your 
formula.
 
3. Type any mathematical operators and click any cells that contain 
data, such as A4 or E8.
 
 If you want to create the formula =A4+E8, you would do the following:
 
a. Type =.
 
 This tells Excel that you’re creating a formula.
 
b. Click cell A4.
 
 Excel types the A4 cell reference in your formula automatically.
 
c. Type +.
 
d. Click cell E8.
 
 Excel types in the E8 cell reference in your formula automatically.
 
4. Press Enter.
After you finish creating a formula, you can type data into the cell references 
used in your formula to calculate a new result.

174
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
Organizing formulas with parentheses
Formulas can be as simple as a single mathematical operator such as =D3*E4. 
However, you can also use multiple mathematical operators, such as
=A4+A5*C7/F4+D9
There are two problems with using multiple mathematical operators. First, 
they make a formula harder to read and understand. Second, Excel calcu-
lates mathematical operators from left to right, based on precedence, which 
means a formula may calculate results differently than you intended.
Precedence tells Excel which mathematical operators to calculate first, as 
listed in Table 9-2. For example, Excel calculates multiplication before it cal-
culates addition. If you had a formula like
=A3+A4*B4+B5
Excel first multiplies A4*B4 and then adds this result to A3 and B5.

Typing parentheses around cell references and mathematical operators not 
only organizes your formulas, but also tells Excel specifically how you want to 
calculate a formula. In the example =A3+A4*B4+B5, Excel multiplies A4 and B4 
first. If you want Excel to first add A3 and A4, then add B4 and B5, and finally 
multiply the two results together, you have to use parentheses, like this:
=(A3+A4)*(B4+B5)

175
 Chapter 9: Playing with Formulas
Copying formulas
In many spreadsheets, you may need to create similar formulas that use dif-
ferent data. For example, you may have a spreadsheet that needs to add the 
same number of cells in adjacent columns.
You could type nearly identical formulas in multiple cells, but that’s tedious 
and error-prone. For a faster way, you can copy a formula and paste it in 
another cell; then Excel automatically changes the cell references, as shown 
in Figure 9-1.
 
Figure 9-1: 
Rather 
than type 
repetitive 
formulas 
over and 
over again, 
Excel can 
copy a 
formula 
but auto-
matically 
change 
the cell 
references.
 
From Figure 9-1, you can see that cell B9 contains the formula 
=B3+B4+B5+B6+B7+B8, which simply adds the numbers stored in the six 
cells directly above the cell that contains the formula (B9). If you copy this 
formula to another cell, that new formula will also add the six cells directly 
above it. Copy and paste this formula to cell C9, and Excel changes the for-
mula to =C3+C4+C5+C6+C7+C8.
To copy and paste a formula so that each formula changes cell references 
automatically, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell that contains the formula you want to copy.
 
2. Press Ctrl+C (or click the Copy icon under the Home tab).
 
 Excel displays a dotted line around your selected cell.

176
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
 
3. Select the cell (or cells) where you want to paste your formula.
 
 If you select multiple cells, Excel pastes a copy of your formula in each 
of those cells.
 
4. Press Ctrl+V (or click the Paste icon under the Home tab).
 
 Excel pastes your formula and automatically changes the cell references.
 
5. Press Esc or double-click away from the cell with the dotted line to 
make the dotted line go away.
Using Functions
Creating simple formulas is easy, but creating complex formulas is hard. To 
make complex formulas easier to create, Excel comes with prebuilt formulas 
called functions. Table 9-3 lists some of the many functions available.
Table 9-3 
Common Excel Functions
Function 
Name
What It Does
AVERAGE
Calculates the average value of numbers stored in two or more cells
COUNT
Counts how many cells contain a number instead of a label (text)
MAX
Finds the largest number stored in two or more cells
MIN
Finds the smallest number stored in two or more cells
ROUND
Rounds a decimal number to a specific number of digits
SQRT
Calculates the square root of a number
SUM
Adds the values stored in two or more cells
Excel literally provides hundreds of functions that you can use by themselves 
or as part of your own formulas. A function typically uses one or more cell 
references:
 
✓ Single cell references, such as =ROUND(C4,2), which rounds the 
number found in cell C4 to two decimal places
 
✓ Contiguous (adjacent) cell ranges, such as =SUM(A4:A9), which adds all 
the numbers found in cells A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, and A9
 
✓ Noncontiguous cell ranges, such as =SUM(A4,B7,C11), which adds all 
the numbers found in cells A4, B7, and C11

177
 Chapter 9: Playing with Formulas
To use a function, follow these steps:
 
1. Click in the cell where you want to create a formula using a function.
 
2. Click the Formulas tab.
 
3. Click one of the following function icons in the Function Library 
group:
 
• Financial: Calculates business-related equations, such as the 
amount of interest earned over a specified time period
 
• Logical: Provides logical operators to manipulate True and False 
(also known as Boolean) values
 
• Text: Searches and manipulates text
 
• Date & Time: Provides date and time information
 
• Lookup & Reference: Provides information about cells, such as 
their row headings
 
• Math & Trig: Offers mathematical equations
 
• More Functions: Provides access to statistical and engineering 
functions

Using the AutoSum command
One of the most useful and commonly used command is the AutoSum com-
mand. The AutoSum command uses the SUM function to add two or more cell 
references without making you type those cell references yourself. The most 
common use for the AutoSum function is to add a column or row of numbers.
To add a column or row of numbers with the AutoSum function, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Create a column or row of numbers that you want to add.
 
2. Click at the bottom of the column or the right of the row.
 
3. Click the Formulas tab.
 
4. Click the AutoSum icon in the Function Library group.
 
 Excel automatically creates a SUM function in the cell you chose in Step 
2 and highlights all the cells where it will retrieve data to add, as shown 
in Figure 9-4. (If you accidentally click the downward-pointing arrow 
under the AutoSum icon, a pull-down menu appears. Just choose Sum.)

function.
 
 
5. Press Enter.
 
 Excel automatically sums all the cell references.
 
The AutoSum icon also appears on the Home tab in the Editing group.
Using recently used functions
Digging through all the different function library menus can be cumbersome, 
so Excel tries to make your life easier by creating a special Recently Used 
list that contains (what else?) a list of the functions you’ve used most often. 
From this menu, you can see just a list of your favorite functions and ignore 
the other hundred functions that you may never need in a million years.
To use the list of recently used functions, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the cell where you want to store a function.
 
2. Click the Formulas tab.
 
3. Click the Recently Used icon in the Function Library group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 9-5.
 
4. Choose a function.
 
The more functions you use, the more your list will vary from what you see in 
Figure 9-5.

Editing a Formula
After you create a formula, you can always edit it later. You can edit a for-
mula in two places:
 
✓ In the Formula bar
 
✓ In the cell itself
To edit a formula in the Formula bar, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell that contains the formula you want to edit.
 
 Excel displays the formula in the Formula bar.
 
2. Click in the Formula bar and edit your formula by using the 
Backspace and Delete keys.
To edit a formula in the cell itself, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click in the cell that contains the formula you want to edit.
 
 Excel displays a cursor in the cell you selected.
 
2. Edit your formula by using the Backspace and Delete keys.
 
Because formulas display their calculations in a cell, it can be hard to tell the 
difference between cells that contain numbers and cells that contain formu-
las. To make formulas visible, press Ctrl+` (an accent grave character, which 
appears on the same key as the ~ symbol).

181
 Chapter 9: Playing with Formulas
Conditional Formatting
A formula in a cell can display a variety of values, depending on the data that 
the formula receives. Because a formula can display any type of a number, 
you might want to use conditional formatting as a way to highlight certain 
types of values.
Suppose you have a formula that calculates your monthly profits. You can 
change the formatting to emphasize the results:
 
✓ If your result is zero or a loss, display that value in red. 
 
✓ If you make a profit under $1,000, display that value in yellow. 
 
✓ If the profit is at least $100,000, display that value in green.
 
Conditional formatting simply displays data in a formula in various ways, 
depending on the value that the formula calculates. 
Comparing data values 
The simplest type of conditional formatting displays different colors or icons 
based on adjacent values, which makes it easy to compare, at a glance, differ-
ent numbers.
Excel offers three types of conditional formatting for identifying values, as 
shown in Figure 9-6:
 
✓ Data Bars: Higher values display more color while lower values display 
less color.
 
✓ Color Scales: Different colors identify different ranges of values.
 
✓ Icon Sets: Different icons identify different ranges of values.
To apply conditional formatting, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cells that you want to apply conditional formatting.
 
2. Click the Home tab and then click the Conditional Formatting icon in 
the Styles group.
 
 A menu appears (refer to Figure 9-6).
 
3. Move the mouse over Data Bars, Color Scales, or Icon Sets.
 
 A menu appears.

182
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
 
4. Click on the type of conditional formatting you want.
 
 Excel applies your conditional formatting over the cells you chose in 
Step 1.
 
Figure 9-6: 
Conditional 
formatting 
can identify 
values of 
different 
cells.
 
Creating conditional formatting rules
Using colors or icons to identify ranges of values might be nice, but you may 
want to define your own rules for how conditional formatting should work, 
such as displaying all negative values in red and all values above 1,000 in 
green. 
To define your own rules for formatting values, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cells that you want to apply conditional formatting.
 
2. Click the Home tab and then click the Conditional Formatting icon in 
the Styles group.
 
 A menu appears (refer to Figure 9-6).
 
3. Move the mouse over Highlight Cells Rules.
 
 A menu appears, as shown in Figure 9-7.
 
4. Click on an option such as Greater Than or Between.
 
 A dialog box appears, which lets you define one or more values and 
choose a color for formatting your selected cells, as shown in Figure 9-8.

 Excel displays conditional formatting only to those selected cells that 
meet the criteria you defined.

184
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
 
If you click the Conditional Formatting icon on the Home tab and choose Top/
Bottom Rules, Excel can apply conditional formatting to your top (or bottom) 
ten values or those values above or below the average, as shown in Figure 9-9.
 
Figure 9-9: 
The Top/
Bottom 
Rules menu 
can identify 
the top/bot-
tom values 
or those

Data Validation
Because formulas are only as accurate as the data they receive, it’s impor-
tant that your spreadsheet contains only valid data. Examples of invalid data 
might be a negative number (such as –9) for a price or a decimal number 
(such as 4.39) for the number of items a customer bought.
To keep your spreadsheet from accepting invalid data, you can define a cell 
to accept only certain types of data, such as numbers that fall between 30 
and 100. The moment someone tries to type invalid data into a cell, Excel 
immediately warns you, as shown in Figure 9-10.
To define valid types of data for a cell, follow these steps:
 
1. Click a cell that contains data used by a formula.

4. Click Clear All and then click OK.
 
 Excel clears all your data validation rules for your chosen cell.
Goal Seeking
When you create a formula, you can type in data to see how the formula 
calculates a new result. However, Excel also offers a feature known as Goal 
Seeking. With Goal Seeking, you specify the value you want a formula to cal-
culate, and then Excel changes the data in the formula’s cell references to tell 
you what values you need to achieve that goal.
For example, suppose you have a formula that calculates how much money 
you make every month by selling a product such as cars. Change the number 
of cars you sell, and Excel calculates your monthly commission. But if you 
use Goal Seeking, you can specify you want to earn $5,000 for your monthly 
commission, and Excel will work backward to tell you how many cars you 
need to sell. As its name implies, Goal Seeking lets you specify a goal and see 
what number, in a specific cell, needs to change to help you reach your goal.
To use Goal Seeking, follow these steps:
 
1. Click in a cell that contains a formula.
 
2. Click the Data tab.

188

 The Goal Seek dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-15.
 
5. Click in the To Value text box and type a number that you want 
to appear in the formula stored in the cell that you clicked in 
Step 1.
 
6. Click in the By Changing Cell text box and click one cell that contains 
data used by the formula you chose in Step 1.
 
 Excel displays your cell reference, such as B5, in the Goal Seek 
dialog box.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 The Goal Seek Status dialog box changes the data in the cell you chose 
in Step 6, as shown in Figure 9-16.

Creating Multiple Scenarios
Spreadsheets show you what happened in the past. However, you can also 
use a spreadsheet to help predict the future by typing in data that represents 
your best guess of what might happen.
When you use a spreadsheet as a prediction tool, you may create a best-case 
scenario (where customers flood you with orders) and a worst-case scenario 
(where hardly anybody buys anything). You could type in different data to 
represent multiple possibilities, but then you’d wipe out your old data. For 
a quick way to plug different data in the same spreadsheet, Excel offers 
scenarios.
A scenario lets you define different data for multiple cells. That way, you can 
choose a scenario to plug in one set of data, and then switch back to your 
original data without retyping all your original data and formulas all over 
again.
Creating a scenario
Before you can create a scenario, you must first create a spreadsheet with 
data and formulas. Then you can create a scenario to define the data to plug 
into one or more cells.

Viewing a scenario summary
If you have multiple scenarios, it can be hard to switch back and forth 
between different scenarios and still understand which numbers are chang-
ing. To help you view the numbers that change in all your scenarios, you can 
create a scenario summary.

193

A scenario summary displays your original data along with the data stored in 
each scenario in a table. By viewing a scenario summary, you can see how 
the values of your spreadsheet can change depending on the scenario, as

a formula that your scenario affects.
 
7. Click OK.
Auditing Your Formulas
Your spreadsheet results are only as good as the data you give it and the 
formulas you create. Feed a spreadsheet the wrong data, and it will obviously 
calculate the wrong result. More troublesome is when you feed a spreadsheet 
the right data but your formula is incorrect, which produces a misleading 
and incorrect result.
Even if Excel appears to be calculating your formulas correctly, recheck your 
calculations just to make sure. Some common errors that can mess up your 
formulas include:
 
✓ Missing data: The formula isn’t using all the data necessary to calculate 
the proper result.
 
✓ Incorrect data: The formula is getting data from the wrong cell (or 
wrong data from the right cell).
 
✓ Incorrect calculation: Your formula is incorrectly calculating a result.
If a formula is calculating data incorrectly, you probably didn’t type the for-
mula correctly. For example, you may want a formula to add two numbers, 
but you accidentally typed in the formula to multiply two numbers instead. 
To check whether a formula is calculating data incorrectly, give it data that 
you already know what the result should be. For example, if you typed the 
numbers 4 and 7 into a formula that should add two numbers, but it returns 
28 instead, you know that it’s not calculating correctly.
If your formula is correct but it’s still not calculating the right result, chances 
are good it’s not getting the data it needs from the correct cells. To help you 
trace whether a formula is receiving all the data it needs, Excel offers audit-
ing features that visually show you which cells supply data to which formu-
las. By using Excel’s auditing features, you can
 
✓ Make sure that your formulas are using data from the correct cells.
 
✓ Find out instantly whether a formula could go haywire if you change a 
cell reference.

195
 Chapter 9: Playing with Formulas
Finding where a formula gets its data
If a formula is retrieving data from the wrong cells, it’s never going to calcu-
late the right result. By tracing a formula, you can see all the cells that a for-
mula uses to retrieve data.
 
Any cell that supplies data to a formula is a precedent.
To trace a formula, follow these steps:
 
1. Click a cell that contains the formula you want to check.
 
2. Click the Formulas tab.
 
3. Click the Trace Precedents icon in the Formula Auditing group.
 
 Excel draws arrows that show you all the cells that feed data into the 
formula you chose in Step 1, as shown in Figure 9-22.
 
4. Click the Remove Arrows button to make the auditing arrows go 
away.
 
Figure 9-22: 
Excel draws 
arrows that 
trace prec-
edent cells 
that feed 
data into a 
formula.
 
Finding which formula(s) 
a cell can change
Sometimes you may be curious how a particular cell might affect a formula 
stored in your worksheet. Although you could just type a new value in that 
cell and look for any changes, it’s easier (and more accurate) to identify all 
formulas that are dependent on a particular cell.

196
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
 
Any formula that receives data is a dependent.
To find one or more formulas that a single cell might affect, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click any cell that contains data (not a formula).
 
2. Click the Formulas tab.
 
3. Click Trace Dependents.
 
 Excel draws an arrow that points to a cell that contains a formula, as 
shown in Figure 9-23. This tells you that if you change the data in the cell 
you chose in Step 1, it will change the calculated result in the cell con-
taining a formula.
 
4. Click the Remove Arrows icon in the Formula Auditing group to make 
the arrows go away.
 
Figure 9-23: 
Excel can 
identify 
which 
formulas a 
particular 
cell can 
change.
 
Checking for Errors
If you create large worksheets with data and formulas filling rows and col-
umns, it can be hard to check to make sure that there aren’t any problems 
with your spreadsheet, such as a formula dividing a number with a non-exis-
tent value in another cell.
Fortunately, Excel can catch many types of errors by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Formulas tab.
 
2. Click the Error Checking icon in the Formula Auditing group.

197
 Chapter 9: Playing with Formulas
 
 Excel displays a dialog box and highlights any errors, as shown in 
Figure 9-24.
 
3. Click any of the options such as Previous or Next to see any additional 
errors.

▶ Playing with pivot tables
T
he biggest problem with looking at any Excel spreadsheet is wondering, 
“What the heck do these numbers really mean?” 
To help you analyze and understand what rows and columns of numbers 
might mean, Excel can convert data into a variety of charts such as pie 
charts, bar charts, and line charts. By letting you visualize your data, Excel 
helps you quickly understand what your data means so you can spot trends 
and patterns.
Understanding the Parts of a Chart
To create charts that clarify your data (rather than confuse you even more), 
you need to understand the parts of a chart and their purpose, as shown in 
Figure 10-1:
 
✓ Data Series: The numeric data that Excel uses to create the chart
 
✓ X-axis: Defines the width of a chart
 
✓ Y-axis: Defines the height of a chart
 
✓ Legend: Provides text to explain what each visual part of a chart means
 
✓ Chart Title: Explains the purpose of the entire chart

200
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
 
Figure 10-1: 
Each part 
of a typical 
Excel chart 
displays 
information 
about your 
data.
 
Data series
Y-axis
X-axis
Charts typically use two data series to create a chart. For example, one data 
series may be sales made that month, while a second data series may be the 
names of each salesperson.
The X-axis of such a chart would list the names of different products while 
the Y-axis would list a range of numbers that represent dollar amounts. The 
chart itself could display different colors that represent products sold in dif-
ferent months, and the legend would explain what each color represents.
By glancing at the column chart in Figure 10-1, you can quickly identify:
 
✓ Which products sell best
 
✓ How each product sells in each month
 
✓ Whether sales of a particular product are improving (or getting worse)
All this data came from the spreadsheet in Figure 10-1. By looking at the num-
bers in this spreadsheet, identifying the above information is nearly impos-
sible. However, by converting these numbers into a chart, identifying this 
type of information is so simple even your boss could do it.

201
 Chapter 10: Charting and Analyzing Data
Although Figure 10-1 shows a column chart, Excel can create a variety of 
other types of charts so you can look at your data in different ways, as shown 
in Figure 10-2. Some other types of charts Excel can create include
 
✓ Column chart: Displays quantities as vertical columns that “grow” 
upward. Useful for creating charts that compare two items, such as sales 
per month or sales per salesperson.
 
✓ Line chart: Displays quantities as lines. Essentially shows the tops of a 
column chart.
 
✓ Area chart: Identical to a line chart except that it shades the area under-
neath each line.
 
✓ Bar chart: Essentially a column chart turned on its side where bars 
“grow” from left to right.
 
✓ Pie chart: Compares multiple items in relation to a whole, such as which 
product sales make up a percentage of a company’s overall profits.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Common 
types of 
charts that 
Excel can 
create to 
help you 
visualize 
your data 
in different 
ways.
 
 
Excel can create both two- and three-dimensional charts. A 3-D chart can look 
neat, but sometimes the 3-D visual can obscure the true purpose of the chart, 
which is to simplify data and make it easy for you to understand in the first 
place.

202
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
Creating a Chart
Before you create a chart, you need to type in some numbers and identifying 
labels because Excel will use those labels to identify the parts of your chart. 
(You can always edit your chart later if you don’t want Excel to display cer-
tain labels or numbers.)
To create a chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the numbers and labels that you want to use to create a chart.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
 A list of chart type icons appears in the Charts group, as shown in 
Figure 10-3.
 
Figure 10-3: 
The Insert 
tab displays 
icons for 
creating dif-
ferent types 
of charts.
 
 
3. Click a Chart icon, such as the Pie or Line icon.
 
 The Create Chart gallery appears (refer to Figure 10-3).
 
4. Click a chart type.
 
 Excel creates your chart and displays a Chart Tools tab, as shown in 
Figure 10-4.

203
 Chapter 10: Charting and Analyzing Data
 
Figure 10-4: 
The Chart 
Tools tab 
appears 
so you can 
modify a 
chart after 
you 
create it.
 
Editing a Chart
After you create a chart, you may want to edit it. Editing a chart can mean 
moving it to a new location, changing the data source (the numbers that 
Excel uses to create the chart), modifying parts of the chart itself (such as 
switching to a different chart type), or editing text (such as the chart title or 
legend).
Moving a chart on a worksheet
When you create a chart, Excel plops it right on your displayed spreadsheet, 
which may not be exactly where you want it to appear. Excel gives you the 
option of moving a chart to a different place on the current worksheet page 
or on a different worksheet page altogether.
To move a chart to a different location on the same worksheet, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Move the mouse pointer over the border of the chart until the mouse 
pointer turns into a four-way pointing arrow.
 
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse.
 
 The chart moves with the mouse.
 
3. Move the chart where you want it to appear and release the left mouse 
button.

204
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
Moving a chart to a new sheet
Rather than move a chart on the same sheet where it appears, you can also 
move the chart to another worksheet. That way your data can appear on one 
worksheet, and your chart can appear on another.
To move a chart to an entirely different sheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart you want to move to another worksheet.
 
 The Chart Tools tab appears.
 
2. Click the Design tab.
 
3. Click the Move Chart icon in the Location group.
 
 The Move Chart dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
 As an alternative to Steps 1 through 3, you can right-click a chart; then 
when the pop-up menu appears, choose Move Chart.
 
Figure 10-5: 
Specify a 
worksheet 
where you 
want to 
move your 
chart.
 
 
4. Select one of the following radio buttons:
 
• New Sheet: Creates a new worksheet and lets you name it
 
• Object In: Lets you choose the name of an existing worksheet
 
5. Click OK.
 
 Excel moves your chart.
Resizing a chart
You can always resize any chart to make it bigger or smaller. To resize a 
chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the mouse pointer over any corner of the chart until the mouse 
pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow.

205
 Chapter 10: Charting and Analyzing Data
 
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse to shrink 
or expand your chart.
 
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the new size of 
your chart.
Using the Chart Tools
As soon as you create a chart or click on an existing chart, Excel displays the 
Chart Tools category, which displays Design, Layout, and Format tabs. If you 
click on the Design tab, you’ll see tools organized into four categories:
 
✓ Type: Lets you change the chart type
 
✓ Data: Lets you change the source where the chart retrieves its data or 
switch the data from appearing along the X-axis to the Y-axis and vice 
versa
 
✓ Chart Layouts: Lets you change the individual parts of a chart, such as 
the chart title, X- or Y-axis labels, or the placement of the chart legend 
(top, bottom, left, right)
 
✓ Chart Styles: Provides different ways to change the appearance of your 
chart
Changing the chart type
After you create a chart, you can experiment with how your data may look 
when displayed as a different chart, such as switching your chart from a bar 
chart to a pie chart. To change chart types, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart you want to change.
 
 The Chart Tools category appears.
 
2. Click the Design tab under the Chart Tools category.
 
3. Click the Change Chart Type icon in the Type group.
 
 The Change Chart Type dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
4. Click a chart type, such as Pie or Column.
 
 The dialog box displays a list of chart designs in the right panel of the 
dialog box.
 
5. Click the chart design you want in the right panel.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Excel displays your new chart.

to its original design.
 
Figure 10-6: 
The Change 
Chart Type 
dialog box 
lets you pick

Changing the data source
Another way to change the appearance of a chart is to change its data source 
(the cells that contain the actual data that the chart uses). To change a 
chart’s data source, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart you want to change.
 
 The Chart Tools category appears.
 
2. Click the Design tab under the Chart Tools category.
 
3. Click the Select Data icon in the Data group.
 
 The Select Data Source dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-7.
 
4. (Optional) Click the Shrink Dialog Box icon to shrink the Change Data 
Source dialog box so you can see more of your spreadsheet.
 
5. Select all the cells that contain data to create a chart, including any 
cells that contain labels, numbers, and formulas.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Excel displays your chart, using the data you specify in Step 5.

Switching rows and columns
When Excel creates a chart, it displays your data’s labels on the X- and 
Y-axes. However, you can switch these around, and Excel can show you how 
your chart may change.
To switch the rows and columns used to create a chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart you want to change.
 
 The Chart Tools category appears.
 
2. Click the Design tab under the Chart Tools category.
 
3. Click the Switch Row/Column icon in the Data group.

208
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
Changing the parts of a chart
To make your charts more informative, you can add additional text, such as
 
✓ A chart title
 
✓ A legend
 
✓ Data labels
 
✓ Axis labels
 
✓ Axes
 
✓ Gridlines
With each part of a chart, Excel can either hide it completely or move it to a 
different location. To modify any part of a chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart you want to change.
 
 The Chart Tools category appears.
 
2. Click the Layout tab under the Chart Tools category.
 
3. Click the icon that identifies the part of the chart you want to modify, 
such as Chart Title or Axis Titles.
 
 A menu of different options appears, as shown in Figure 10-8.

 Chapter 10: Charting and Analyzing Data
Designing the layout of a chart
Although you could add and modify the individual parts of a chart yourself, 
such as the location of the chart title or legend, you may find it faster to 
choose a predefined layout for your chart. To choose a predefined chart 
layout, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart you want to modify.
 
 The Chart Tools category appears.
 
2. Click the Design tab under the Chart Tools category.
 
3. Click the More button in the Chart Layouts group, as shown in 
Figure 10-9.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
4. Click a chart layout.
 
 Excel changes your chart.

Deleting a chart
Charts may be nice to look at, but eventually you may want to delete them. 
To delete a chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the chart you want to delete.
 
2. Press Delete.
 
You can also right-click a chart; then when the pop-up menu appears, 
choose Cut.
Using Sparklines
Creating a chart can help you visualize your data, but sometimes a massive 
chart with legends, titles, and X/Y-axis can seem like too much trouble for 
just identifying trends in your data. For a much simpler tool, Excel offers 
Sparklines. 
Sparklines allow you to see, at a glance, the relationship between values 
stored in multiple cells. Rather than look at a row or column of numbers to 
determine if the values are increasing or decreasing over time, you can create 
a Sparkline that condenses this information in a single cell that you can see at 
a glance. Excel offers three types of Sparklines, as shown in Figure 10-10:
 
✓ Line
 
✓ Column
 
✓ Win/Loss
Creating a Sparkline
To create and display a Sparkline in a spreadsheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cells that contain the data you want to turn into a Sparkline.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click on the Line, Column, or Win/Loss icon in the Sparklines group.
 
 A Create Sparklines dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-11.

Deleting a Sparkline
After you’ve created one or more Sparklines, you may want to delete them. 
To delete a Sparkline, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the cell that contains a Sparkline.
 
2. Click on the Design tab.
 
3. Click the Clear icon in the Group category.
 
 Your chosen Sparkline disappears.
Organizing Lists in Pivot Tables
Ordinary spreadsheets let you compare two sets of data such as sales versus 
time or products sold versus the salesperson who sold them. Unfortunately, 
if you want to know how many products each salesperson sold in a certain 
month, deciphering this information from a spreadsheet may not be easy.
That’s where pivot tables come in. A pivot table lets you yank data from your 
spreadsheet and organize it in different ways in a table. By rearranging (or 
“pivoting”) your data from a row to a column (and vice versa), pivot tables 
can help you spot trends that may not be easily identified trapped within the 
confines of an ordinary spreadsheet.
Creating a pivot table
Pivot tables use the column headings of a spreadsheet to organize data in 
a table. Ideally, each column in the spreadsheet should identify a different 
type of data, such as the name of each salesperson, the sales region he or she 
works in, and the total amount of sales made, as shown in Figure 10-13.
After you design a spreadsheet with multiple columns of data, follow these 
steps to create a pivot table:
 
1. Select the cells (including column labels) that you want to include in 
your pivot table.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click the top half of the PivotTable icon in the Tables group.
 
 The Create PivotTable dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-14.

4. (Optional) Select the cells that contain the data you want to use in 
your pivot table.
 
 You only need to follow Step 4 if you didn’t select any cells in Step 1, or 
if you change your mind and want to select different cells than the ones 
chosen in Step 1.
 
5. Select one of the following radio buttons:
 
• New Worksheet: Puts the pivot table on a new worksheet
 
• Existing Worksheet: Puts the pivot table on an existing worksheet
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Excel displays a PivotTable Field List pane, as shown in Figure 10-15.
 
7. Mark (select) one or more check boxes inside the PivotTable Field List 
pane.
 
 Each time you select another check box, Excel modifies how data 
appears in your pivot table, as shown in Figure 10-16.

Rearranging labels in a pivot table
A pivot table organizes data according to your spreadsheet’s column head-
ings (which appear in a pivot table as row labels). The pivot table shown in 
Figure 10-16 shows sales divided by salesperson. Each salesperson’s amounts 
are further divided by sales region, and the names of the products sold.
However, you may be more interested in seeing the sales organized by sales 
region. To do this, you can modify which column heading your pivot table 
uses to organize your data first. To rearrange column headings in a pivot 
table, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the pivot table you want to rearrange.
 
 The PivotTable Field List pane appears. A group called Row Labels 
appears in the bottom-left corner of the PivotTable Field List pane. This 
Row Labels box displays the names of your different PivotTable catego-
ries, such as Region, Product, and Sales Person.

217
 Chapter 10: Charting and Analyzing Data
 
2. Click on a label in the Row Labels box.
 
 A menu appears, as shown in Figure 10-17.
 
 Select one of the following:
 
• Move Up: Moves the label one level closer to the beginning
 
• Move Down: Moves the label one level down to the end
 
• Move to Beginning: Makes the label the dominant criteria for sort-
ing data
 
• Move to End: Makes the label the last criteria for sorting data
 
 Figure 10-18 shows different ways a pivot table can organize the same 
data.

 Chapter 10: Charting and Analyzing Data
Modifying a pivot table
Row labels let you organize data according to different criteria, such as sales 
per region and then by product. For greater flexibility, you can also turn a 
row label into a column heading. Figure 10-19 shows a pivot table where row 
labels are stacked on top of each other, and then the same pivot table where 
one row label (Products) is turned into a column heading.
 
Figure 10-19:

To turn row labels into column headings in a pivot table (or vice versa), 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the pivot table you want to modify.
 
 The PivotTable Field List pane appears.
 
2. Click a heading in the Row Labels box near the bottom-left corner of 
the PivotTable Field List pane.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
3. Choose Move to Column Labels.

220
Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
 
 You can also drag headings from the Row Labels box to the Column 
Labels box and vice versa.
Filtering a pivot table
The more information your pivot table contains, the harder it can be to make 
sense of any of the data. To help you out, Excel lets you filter your data to 
view only certain information, such as sales made by each salesperson or 
total sales within a region. To filter a pivot table, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the pivot table you want to filter.
 
 The PivotTable Field List pane appears.
 
2. Click a heading in the Row Labels or Column Labels group in the 
PivotTable Field List pane.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
3. Click Move to Report Filter.
 
 Excel moves your chosen label into the Report Filter group in the 
PivotTable Field List pane, as shown in Figure 10-20.
 
Figure 10-20:

 Chapter 10: Charting and Analyzing Data
Summing a pivot table
A pivot table not only displays information, but it can also count the number 
of occurrences of information, such as the number of sales per sales region. 
To display a count of data, you need to move a heading in the Values group 
inside the PivotTable Field List pane by following these steps:
 
1. Click the pivot table you want to modify.
 
 The PivotTable Field List pane appears.
 
2. Click a heading that you want to count in the PivotTable Field List 
pane.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
3. Click Move to Values.
 
 Excel moves your chosen heading to the Values group inside the 
PivotTable Field List pane and displays a count of items under your 
chosen heading, as shown in Figure 10-21.

Part III: Playing the Numbers with Excel 
Slicing up a pivot table
If your pivot table contains large amounts of data, trying to decipher this 
information can be difficult. Rather than display all your pivot table data, 
you can choose to slice the pivot table so it shows only the specific data you 
want to view. 
To slice a turn row labels into column headings in a pivot table (or vice 
versa), follow these steps:
 
1. Click anywhere inside the pivot table you want to modify.
 
 The PivotTable category appears and displays an Options and 
Design tab.
 
2. Click the Options tab, click the Slicer icon in the Filter group, and 
choose Insert Slicer.
 
 An Insert Slicers dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-22.
 
Figure 10-22: 
The Insert 
Slicers dia-
log box lets 
you define 
the data 
you want to

223
 Chapter 10: Charting and Analyzing Data
 
3. Select one or more check boxes in the Insert Slicers dialog box and 
click OK.
 
 Slicer panes appear, listing the types of data. For example, a Sales 
Person slicer pane would list the names of all the salespeople while a 
Product slicer pane would list the names of all products sold.
 
4. Click on each slicer pane to select it, and then move the mouse 
pointer over the slicer pane border and drag the mouse to move the 
slicer pane to a more convenient location on the screen.
 
5. Click the item inside each slicer pane to display that data in the pivot 
table. (Hold down the Ctrl key and click to choose multiple items.)
 
 If you want to view sales results from a single salesperson, select that 
salesperson’s name and select all the products you want to examine to 
see how many sales that person made for each product, as shown in 
Figure 10-23.
 
Figure 10-23: 
Slices help 
you zero in 
on specific 
information

 You can remove a slicer pane by right-clicking on the slicer pane and 
when a pop-up menu appears, choose Remove Slicer.
Creating PivotCharts
Pivot tables can contain rows and columns of numbers that you might find 
easier to understand by converting them into a chart, called a PivotChart.
PivotCharts are like other types of charts except you can selectively display 
(or hide) different data. This lets you create a chart showing sales from all 
your salespeople, and then selectively hide all data except anything sold by a 
single salesperson, as shown in Figure 10-24.
 
Figure 10-24: 
A PivotChart 
lets you 
choose 
how much

Making 
Presentations with 
PowerPoint

In this part . . .
M
ost people are more terrified of public speaking 
than they are of dying. While Microsoft Office 2010 
can’t help you overcome your fear of death, it can help 
you overcome your fear of public speaking by helping you 
making presentations using the number one presentation 
program in the world — PowerPoint.
With the help of PowerPoint, you can organize your ideas 
and present them in a visually compelling manner so you 
won’t need to rely on speaking alone (or the threat of 
firing someone) to captivate your audience. By using 
PowerPoint, you can forever banish whiteboards, over-
head projectors, and even drawings when giving a 
presentation. 
The next time you need to dazzle, convince, and persuade 
an audience with information (whether it’s true or not), 
you can flip through this part of the book and learn how 
to create slideshows, add graphics, animation, and sound, 
and design interesting and informative presentations that 
can keep your audience enthralled. 
Using the presentation abilities of PowerPoint, you’ll 
never be at a loss for words again as long as you take a 
moment to think ahead, plan your presentation, and dis-
play your information through the magic of PowerPoint.

P
owerPoint works as a visual aid for giving presentations. (If you never 
give presentations, you probably don’t need PowerPoint.) Instead of 
fumbling around creating, organizing, and displaying transparencies with an 
overhead projector, you can use PowerPoint on your computer to create, 
organize, and display slides that organize information as text and graphics.
Besides displaying slides on the screen, PowerPoint also lets you add notes 
and turn your entire slide show presentation into printed handouts so the 
audience can review your presentation with a printed copy of each slide. 
The next time you need to convince or inform an audience, use PowerPoint 
to create and deliver your presentation. (Just make sure that you never use 
PowerPoint to propose marriage, though.)
Defining the Purpose of 
Your Presentation
PowerPoint can make creating and delivering a presentation easy, but before 
you start creating fancy visuals with eye-popping graphics and colors, step 
away from your computer, put down your copy of PowerPoint, and place 
your hands in the open where anyone can see them.
Rushing into PowerPoint to create a presentation is likely to create a daz-
zling array of colors, fonts, and graphics that may look interesting but won’t 

230
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 
convey your message effectively. The best way to create an effective presen-
tation is to take some time to think about the following:
 
✓ What is your point? Define the single most important idea of your 
presentation.
 
✓ Who is the target audience? A presentation given to engineers and sci-
entists will look different than the same presentation given to CEOs and 
venture capital executives.
 
✓ What do you want the audience to do? A speaker may present new 
ideas to a conference, while a politician may present ideas designed to 
sway the audience to take certain actions, such as voting a specific way.
After you understand the purpose of your presentation, your audience, and 
what you hope your presentation will do, you’re ready to go through the 
physical steps of creating a presentation in PowerPoint.
Creating a PowerPoint Presentation
A PowerPoint presentation consists of one or more slides where each slide 
can display text and graphics. Creating a presentation means adding slides 
and typing text or pasting graphics on each slide.
 
When you first start PowerPoint, the program loads a blank presentation that 
you can modify right away.
If you’ve been working on another presentation in PowerPoint and you need 
to start a new, blank presentation from scratch, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click New.
 
 PowerPoint displays different templates you can choose.
 
3. Click Blank Presentation and then click Create.
 
 PowerPoint displays a blank slide with a title and subtitle box, as shown 
in Figure 11-1.
After you create a new presentation, you need to fill it with content (text and 
graphics). PowerPoint gives you two ways to view, edit, and design your 
presentation:
 
✓ Slide view
 
✓ Outline view

231
 Chapter 11: Creating a PowerPoint Presentation
 
Figure 11-1: 
A new pre-
sentation 
consists of a 
single blank 
slide.
 
Both views let you add, delete, rearrange, and edit slides. The main differ-
ence is that Slide view lets you add graphics and modify the visual appear-
ance of a slide. Outline view displays your entire presentation as an outline in 
which each slide appears as an outline heading, and additional text on each 
slide appears as a subheading. Outline view makes it easy to focus on the text 
of your presentation without the distraction of the visual appearance of your 
slides.
 
You can create an entire presentation in Slide view without ever using Outline 
view at all (or use Outline view without ever using Slide view at all). Outline 
view is most useful for creating and organizing a presentation. Slide view is 
most useful for viewing the appearance of multiple slides at once.
Designing a presentation with Slide view
Slide view shows your entire slide show as thumbnails in the left pane and 
the currently selected slide in full size view in the right pane, as shown in 
Figure 11-2.

232
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 
 
Figure 11-2:

Creating a new slide
To create a new slide within Slide view, follow these steps:
 
1. Click an existing slide in the thumbnail pane.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the New Slide icon in the Slides group.
 
 PowerPoint inserts your new slide after the slide you selected in Step 1.
 
If you click the top half of the New Slide icon, PowerPoint creates a blank 
slide based on the slide you selected in Step 1. If you click the bottom half of 
the New Slide icon, a menu appears, letting you choose from a variety of dif-
ferent slide designs.

233
 Chapter 11: Creating a PowerPoint Presentation
Rearranging slides
You can rearrange the order of your slides by following these steps:
 
1. In the thumbnail pane, click the slide that you want to move to a new 
position in your presentation.
 
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse up or 
down within the thumbnail pane.
 
 PowerPoint displays a horizontal line between slides to show you where 
your slide will appear. If you drag the mouse to the top or bottom of the 
thumbnail pane, PowerPoint automatically scrolls up or down the list.
 
3. Release the left mouse button when you’re happy with the slide’s new 
position.
Hiding or deleting a slide
If you have a slide that you no longer want in your presentation, you can 
either hide or delete it. Hiding a slide keeps the slide but doesn’t display that 
slide when you give your presentation. You may want to hide a slide in case 
you need it later or so you can reference the information on this slide with 
the rest of your presentation.
To hide a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. In the thumbnail pane, click the slide that you want to hide.
 
2. Click the Slide Show tab.
 
3. Click Hide Slide in the Set Up group.
 
 PowerPoint dims your chosen slide and highlights the Hide Slide icon.
 
To unhide a slide, repeat the preceding steps.
If you’re sure that you want to get rid of a slide, you can just delete it. To 
delete a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. In the thumbnail pane, click the slide that you want to delete.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Press the Delete key.
 
 PowerPoint deletes your chosen slide.
 
If you press Ctrl+Z or click the Undo icon right away, you can recover a 
deleted slide.

234
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 
Designing a presentation 
with Outline view
In the Outline view, each slide appears with one or more of the following:
 
✓ A title (appears to the right of a slide icon)
 
✓ A subheading (appears to the right of a number in a small box)
 
✓ Text (appears without any icon next to it)
The Outline pane only displays the text on each slide. Clicking on a slide in 
the Outline pane displays the entire slide, including graphics, as shown in 
Figure 11-3.
The biggest advantage of Outline view is that it lets you rearrange and orga-
nize your slides by focusing on their content (title, subtitles, and text). To 
switch from Slide view to Outline view, click the Outline tab. To switch from 
Outline view to Slide view, click the Slides tab.

 Chapter 11: Creating a PowerPoint Presentation
Creating a new slide
In Outline view, each outline heading represents a slide. To create a new slide 
in Outline view, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Outline tab to switch to Outline view.
 
2. Click a slide title in the Outline pane.
 
3. Choose one of the following:
 
• Press Home to move the cursor to the front of the outline heading. 
This creates a new slide before the currently displayed slide.
 
• Press End to move the cursor to the end of the outline heading. This 
creates a new slide after the currently displayed slide.
 
4. Press Enter.
 
 PowerPoint adds a new, blank slide to your presentation.
Creating subtitles on a slide
Outline view lets you create slides and add subtitles to each slide as well. To 
add a subtitle to a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Outline view tab to display the Outline pane.
 
2. Click a slide title and then press End to move the cursor to the end of 
the slide title.
 
3. Press Enter.
 
 PowerPoint creates a blank slide title underneath.
 
4. Press Tab.
 
 PowerPoint indents your slide title and turns it into subtitle text under 
the preceding outline heading.
Collapsing and expanding subtitles
A large presentation consisting of multiple slides with subtitles can be hard 
to read. To simplify the appearance of your outline, PowerPoint lets you col-
lapse or expand outline headings. To collapse or expand an outline heading, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Outline tab to display the Outline pane.
 
2. Double-click the slide icon of a slide title in the Outline pane.
 
 PowerPoint collapses any subtitles that appear under your chosen outline 
heading and displays a gray line under your outline heading to let you 
know that its subtitle text is collapsed (hidden), as shown in Figure 11-4.

To expand a collapsed slide title, just double-click its slide icon.
Rearranging slides
Outline view makes it easy to rearrange slides just by moving slide titles up 
or down. To move a slide title, follow these steps:
 
1. Move the mouse pointer over the slide icon that appears to the left of 
the slide title (or slide subtitle) that you want to move.
 
 The mouse turns into a four-way pointing arrow.
 
2. Hold down the left mouse button and drag (move) the mouse up or 
down.
 
 PowerPoint displays a horizontal gray line to show where the new posi-
tion of the slide will appear in your presentation.
 
3. Release the left mouse button.
 
 PowerPoint moves your outline heading to its new position in your 
presentation.
Deleting a slide
To delete a slide in Outline view, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the slide icon that appears to the left of the slide title (or sub-
title) you want to delete.
 
2. Press Delete.

237
 Chapter 11: Creating a PowerPoint Presentation
Working with Text
Most slides contain exactly one title and one subtitle text box. The title text 
box typically defines the information that the slide presents, while the sub-
title text box displays supporting information.
When you create a new slide, both the title and subtitle text boxes will be 
empty, although they’ll both display the message Click here to add 
title or Click here to add subtitle. (This text won’t appear on your 
slides if you don’t type anything there.)
 
If you delete all the text inside of a title or subtitle text box, PowerPoint auto-
matically displays the Click here to add title or Click here to 
add subtitle text in the empty text boxes.
To add text inside a title or subtitle text box, follow these steps:
 
1. Click in the title or subtitle text box, directly on the slide.
 
 PowerPoint displays a cursor in your chosen text box.
 
2. Type your text.
 
You can also create title and subtitle text in Outline view as explained in the 
earlier section, “Designing a presentation with Outline view.”
Typing text in a text box
A typical PowerPoint slide lets you type text in the Title text box or the Subtitle

Adding Color and Pictures 
to a Presentation
In This Chapter
▶ Using themes
▶ Changing a background
▶ Adding graphics
▶ Showing movies on a slide
▶ Adding sound to a presentation
T
o make your presentations look more visually appealing, PowerPoint lets 
you add color and graphics to your slides. Color and graphics can’t turn 
a worthless presentation into an informative one, but they can enhance an 
informative presentation and make it easier for people to watch.
For additional appeal, PowerPoint lets you add audio and video to a presen-
tation. That way, you can make your presentation more interesting by letting 
people read, hear, and see information.
Applying a Theme
By default, PowerPoint displays each slide with a white background. Although 
you could change the colors and appearance of each slide individually, it’s 
much easier to change every slide in your presentation by using a theme. A 
theme provides predesigned colors and designs that are applied to each slide 
to give your presentation a uniform and professional look.
To define a theme for a presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Design tab.
 
 If you click on a slide in the thumbnail view and hold down the Ctrl key, 
you can select which slides you’ll change. If you don’t select any slide, 
PowerPoint will change all your slides.

248

Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 
Changing the Background
Another way to change the appearance of your presentation is to modify 
the background of your slides. PowerPoint provides predefined background 
themes that you can choose. To choose a background theme, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Design tab.
 
 If you click on a slide in the thumbnail view and hold down the Ctrl key, 
you can select which slides you’ll change. If you don’t select any slide, 
PowerPoint will change all your slides.

designs for 
your slide.
 
 
3. Click a background style.
 
 PowerPoint applies your chosen background style to every slide in your 
presentation.
Choosing a solid color background
Rather than choose a theme, you may want to choose a solid color. If you 
choose a solid color background, make sure that any text or graphics that 
appear on your slides can still be seen. For example, if you choose a dark red 
background, any text or graphics on your slides should appear in light colors 
to make them visible against the dark red background.
To make sure that solid background colors don’t obscure your text and 
graphics, you can also adjust its transparency to make the color appear 
darker or lighter.

251
 Chapter 12: Adding Color and Pictures to a Presentation
To change the background to a solid color, follow these steps:

background of the currently selected slide.
 
 If you click the Reset All Background button, you can remove any back-
ground changes you made.
 
9. Click Close.
Choosing a gradient background
A gradient displays one color that gradually fades into another color, such 
as green to orange. To define a gradient, you can define one or more stops, 
transparency, and the gradient direction. Stops define where the colors in the 
gradient start and end. Transparency defines how opaque a color appears. 
The gradient direction defines how the gradient appears, such as vertically or 
diagonally.
To define a gradient background, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Design tab.
 
 If you click on a slide in the thumbnail view and hold down the Ctrl key, 
you can select which slides you’ll change. If you don’t select any slide,

Adding Graphics to a Slide
Another way to spice up the appearance of your presentation is to include 
graphics on one or more slides. Such graphics can be informative, such as a 
chart that displays sales results; or they can be decorative, such as a cartoon 
smiley face that emphasizes the presentation’s good news.
Three common types of graphics you can add to a PowerPoint slide include
 
✓ Picture files: Includes clip art images as well as images you may have 
stored on your hard drive, such as photographs from your digital 
camera

Layering objects
PowerPoint treats graphics and text boxes (see Chapter 11) as objects that 
you can move around on a slide. If you move one object over another, it may 
block part of another object, as shown in Figure 12-9.
When one object covers another one, PowerPoint considers the first object to 
be on top and the other object (the one being obscured) to be on the bottom. 
By moving objects from top to bottom (or vice versa), you can create unique 
visual effects (or just cover up parts of other objects by mistake).
To move a graphic image to the top or bottom when layered over another 
object, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the graphic image you want to move.
 
 The Format contextual tab appears.

Adding a movie to a slide
PowerPoint slides can also display a movie. When you store a movie on a 
slide, you can resize its size and move it anywhere on your slide. In case you 
need to modify it, PowerPoint will even let you trim parts of your video.
 
PowerPoint can use movies stored in common video formats such as AVI, 
MPEG, ASF (streaming video), QuickTime, Flash, and WMV files. If your movie 
is stored in a different file format, such as Real Video, you must convert the 
file before you add it to a PowerPoint presentation.
To add a movie to a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the slide (in either Slide or Outline view) to which you want to 
add a movie.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click the top half of the Video icon in the Media group.
 
 The Insert Video dialog box appears.
 
 If you click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the Video icon, a 
pull-down menu appears. Choose Video from File.
 
4. Click the movie file you want to add and then click OK.
 
 PowerPoint displays your video on the slide. If you click on the video, 
PowerPoint displays a Format tab underneath a Video Tools heading, as 
shown in Figure 12-11.
 
 If you click the Play button on the Format tab, you can view your video.
Trimming a video
Before you add a video to your PowerPoint presentation, take a moment to 
edit it by using a video-editing program. However, you may still add a video 
to your presentation and suddenly realize that the video is too long. To fix 
this problem, PowerPoint lets you trim a video from the beginning or end.

 A menu appears, letting you choose different color settings.
Formatting the shape of a video
To make your video appear even more visually interesting, PowerPoint lets 
you modify the shape of the video. Instead of appearing as a boring rectangle, 
your video can now appear with shadows, in shapes like a triangle or arrow, 
or with a frame around it.
To format the shape of a video, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the slide (in either Slide or Outline view) that contains the video 
you want to trim.

Adding Sound to a Slide
Sound can be as simple as a sound effect (like a gun firing to wake up people 
in the middle of your presentation) or a recorded speech from the CEO, 
explaining why everyone’s going to be forced to take a 25 percent pay cut 
while the CEO gets a golden parachute of $500,000 a year for the rest of his 
life.
 
PowerPoint can use audio files stored in common formats such as AIFF, MIDI, 
MP3, and WAV files. If your audio file is stored in a different file format, such 
as Real Audio, you have to convert the file before you add it to a PowerPoint 
presentation.
Adding an audio file to a presentation
If you already have music, sound effects, or a speech stored as a file, such 
as an MP3 file, you can add it to your presentation. To add an audio file to a 
slide, follow these steps:

267
 Chapter 12: Adding Color and Pictures to a Presentation
 
1. Click the slide (in either Slide or Outline view) to which you want to 
add an audio file.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click the top half of the Audio icon in the Media group.
 
 An Insert Audio dialog box appears.
 
4. Click the audio file you want to add and then click Insert.
 
 PowerPoint adds your audio file to the currently displayed slide (repre-
sented as a horn icon). You may want to move the sound icon on your 
slide so it doesn’t obscure part of your slide.
 
To hear your audio file, click on the audio file to display a Play button under-
neath. Then click the Play button.
Recording audio
For greater flexibility, PowerPoint lets you record audio directly from your 
computer’s microphone (if you have one, of course). Recorded audio lets you 
or someone else (such as the CEO) make comments that you can insert and 
play into your presentation. 
To record audio for your presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the slide (in either Slide or Outline view) to which you want to 
add an audio file.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click the bottom half of the Audio icon in the Media group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
4. Choose Record Audio.
 
 A Record Sound dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-15.

T
he whole point of creating a PowerPoint presentation is to show it off to 
an audience. To help you keep an audience’s attention, PowerPoint pro-
vides Hollywood-style special effects to make your presentation look more 
interesting.
PowerPoint also provides features for creating handouts for your audience. 
Because people often want to take notes during an interesting presentation 
(or just doodle during a really boring presentation), PowerPoint can create 
handouts that you can print and distribute.
Spell-Checking Your Presentation
You could have the best presentation in the world, but it will look like the 
worst presentation in the world if you have misspellings and typos on your 
slides for everyone to snicker at. To prevent this problem from occurring, 
PowerPoint can spell-check your entire presentation.
 
PowerPoint automatically underlines all misspelled words with a red squiggly 
line. If you right-click any word underlined with a red squiggly line, a pop-up 
menu appears with a list of correctly spelled alternatives that you can choose.

270
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 
To spell-check your entire presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Review tab.
 
2. Click the Spelling icon.
 
 PowerPoint displays the Spelling dialog box when it finds a misspelled 
word, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1: 
The Spelling 
dialog box 
can identify 
potential 
misspellings 
and offer 
corrections.
 
 
3. Choose one of the following for each word that PowerPoint highlights 
as misspelled:
 
• Change: Click the correct spelling of the word and then click 
Change. (Click Change All to change all identical misspellings 
throughout your presentation.)
 
• Ignore All: Click Ignore All to ignore all instances of that word 
throughout your presentation.
 
• Add: Click Add to add the word to the PowerPoint dictionary so it 
won’t flag the word as misspelled again.
 
4. Click Close to stop spell-checking.
 
PowerPoint won’t recognize technical terms, proper names, or correctly 
spelled words used incorrectly, such as using the word there instead of their, 
so it’s important to also proofread your presentation yourself.

271
 Chapter 13: Showing Off a Presentation
Organizing Slides in Sections
PowerPoint displays all the slides of your presentation in the Slides or 
Outline view. While this makes it easy to see all the slides that make up your 
presentation, such a long list of slides can make it hard for you to find any 
particular slide.
To help you avoid searching for a single slide among a huge list, PowerPoint 
gives you the option of organizing in groups called sections. You might group 
the first slides in one section (labeled “Problems”), the next 7 slides in a 
second section (labeled “Consequences”), and the last 13 slides in a third 
section (labeled “My Solutions”). 
After grouping slides into sections, you can selectively hide or display all 
slides in a section. Sections simply help you organize a large presentation of 
slides so you can find and edit particular slides at any given time. 
Adding a section
By default, presentations don’t contain any sections. When you add a section, 
PowerPoint groups all slides in that section, starting with the first slide you 
picked all the way to the end of your presentation or the next section head-
ing, whichever comes first.
To add a section to a presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the slide that you want to define the beginning of a section.
 
2. Click the Home tab and click the Section icon under the Slides group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 13-2.
 
Figure 13-2: 
The Section 
menu lets 
you group 
slides 
together.
 

272
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 
 
3. Choose Add Section.
 
 PowerPoint displays a section heading (named Untitled Section) above 
the slide you selected in Step 1; refer to Figure 13-2.
 
4. Click on the selection heading, click the Section icon in the Slides 
group, and choose Rename Section.
 
 A Rename Section dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-3.
 
Figure 13-3: 
The Rename 
Section dia-
log box. 
 
5. Click in the Section name: text box and type a descriptive name for 
your section. Then click Rename.
 
 PowerPoint renames your chosen section.
 
When you add a section to a presentation, PowerPoint automatically creates 
a Default Section that contains the first slide and all additional slides up to the 
section heading you just created.
Expanding and collapsing a section
After you’ve created at least one section, you can collapse (and expand it). 
Collapsing a section temporarily hides those slides in that section from view 
so you can focus on the rest of your slides. Expanding a section makes the 
slides in that section appear again.
To expand and collapse a section, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the Collapse Section arrow that appears to the left of the sec-
tion name, as shown in Figure 13-4.
 
 PowerPoint collapses your chosen section and displays the number of 
slides(in parentheses) hidden in that collapsed section, as shown in 
Figure 13-5.
 
2. Click the Expand Section arrow that appears to the left of the col-
lapsed section name.
 
 The section expands, displaying all slides within that section.

Deleting a section
Sections can help divide a large presentation into more manageable chunks, 
but you might eventually decide you don’t need a section anymore. When 
you delete a section, you have the option of just deleting the section (and 
leaving the slides intact) or deleting both the section and all slides inside that 
section.
To delete a section, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click on the section name that you want to delete.
 
 PowerPoint displays a pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 13-6.
 
2. Choose Remove Section (to remove your chosen section), Remove 
All Sections (to remove all sections), or Remove Section & Slides (to 
remove your chosen section and all the slides in that section).
 
 PowerPoint deletes your section (or sections).

 Chapter 13: Showing Off a Presentation
Adding Visual Transitions
Transitions define how slides or part of a slide (text or graphics) appear 
during your presentation. By default, slides appear one at a time with all the 
text and graphics displayed at once, which can get monotonous.
To spice up your presentation, PowerPoint offers two types of transitions:
 
✓ Slide transitions
 
✓ Text and picture transitions
 
Use transitions sparingly. Transitions may be visually interesting, but too 
many transitions can be distracting.
Adding slide transitions
Slide transitions can make a slide appear to melt or break into multiple 
pieces that slip away, revealing the next slide underneath.
When creating a transition, you need to define the following:
 
✓ The actual visual appearance of the transition
 
✓ The speed of the transition (Slow, Medium, or Fast)
 
✓ Any sound effects you want to play during the transition (these can get 
really annoying, so use them sparingly)
 
✓ When to display the transition (after a certain time period or when you 
click the mouse)
To create a slide transition, follow these steps:
 
1. Click a slide (in the Slide or Outline view pane).
 
 Any transition you choose will end by displaying the slide you choose in 
this step.
 
2. Click the Transitions tab.
 
 PowerPoint displays the different animation (transition) tools, as shown 
in Figure 13-7.

4. Click the transition you want.
 
5. (Optional) Click in the Sound list box in the Timing group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, listing all the sound effects you can choose, 
as shown in Figure 13-8.
 
Figure 13-8: 
The Sound 
list box 
shows avail-
able sound 
effects.
 
 
6. (Optional) Select the On Mouse Click or After check box.
 
 If you select the After check box, you have to specify a time to wait 
before running the transition.

277
 Chapter 13: Showing Off a Presentation
 
 You can select both the On Mouse Click and Automatically After check 
boxes, so the slide transition waits until you click the mouse or until a 
certain amount of time passes.
 
7. (Optional) Click Apply to All to apply your transitions to every slide in 
your presentation.
 
Applying the same transition throughout your presentation can give your slide 
show a consistent look, but it’s best for only simple, visual transitions and not 
for transitions that involve noisy sound effects that get tedious after awhile.
Text and graphic transitions
Besides animating how your slides appear and disappear, you can also add 
transitions to your text boxes or graphics so they fly or drop into place 
across a slide.
 
Use text and graphic transitions sparingly because the transitions can get 
distracting when people just want to read your presentation without having to 
watch letters zoom around the screen.
To create a simple text or graphic transition, follow these steps:
 
1. Click a text box or picture on a slide.
 
 PowerPoint displays handles around your chosen item.
 
2. Click the Animations tab.
 
3. Click the More button in the Animations group to display a menu of 
options, as shown in Figure 13-9.
 
4. Click an animation, such as Fly In or Wipe.
 
 PowerPoint displays a number near your chosen item. These numbers 
define the order that your transitions will appear.
 
5. Click the top half of the Preview icon to see how your animation will 
look.
 
To remove a transition, just select that text box or graphic, click the 
Animations tab, and choose No Animation from the Animation group.

Using the Animation Painter
If you create a transition that you want to apply to other text boxes or 
graphic objects, you could tediously re-create that transition all over again. 
However, it’s much simpler to use the Animation Painter, which lets you copy 
transitions from one object to another.
To use the Animation Painter, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on a text box or picture that contains the transition you want to 
copy.
 
 PowerPoint displays handles around your chosen item.
 
2. Click the Animations tab.

279
 Chapter 13: Showing Off a Presentation
 
3. Click the Animation Painter icon under the Advanced Animation 
group.
 
4. Click on a text box or picture.
 
 PowerPoint applies the transition, from the object you selected in Step 
1, to the object you selected in Step 4.
Adding Hyperlinks
For greater flexibility in presenting information, PowerPoint lets you add 
hyperlinks to your slides. Hyperlinks let you open a Web page (provided you 
have an Internet connection) or a file (such as a Word document). By adding 
hyperlinks to your slides, you can display additional information stored out-
side of your PowerPoint file.
Creating Web page hyperlinks
A Web page hyperlink lets you convert text into a hyperlink that can load 
your default browser and display any Web site. When you exit the browser 
(or just switch back to PowerPoint), you can see your slide again and con-
tinue with your presentation.
By accessing a Web site, you can avoid copying data and pasting it on a slide. 
For example, if you’re giving a presentation about advertising, you can create 
Web page hyperlinks to show how your competitors use the Internet to 
advertise and sell their products.
To create a Web page hyperlink, follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight the text in a title or subtitle text box that you want to turn 
into a Web page hyperlink.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click the Hyperlink icon in the Links group.
 
 An Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-10.
 
4. Click in the Address text box and type a Web site address, such as 
www.dummies.com.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 PowerPoint underlines the text you selected in Step 1. When you view 
your presentation, PowerPoint turns the mouse pointer into a hand icon 
when you move the mouse over the hyperlink. Clicking on your hyper-
link loads the default browser. 

280
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 
 
Figure 13-10: 
The Insert 
Hyperlink 
dialog box 
lets you 
type in a 
Web site 
address.
 
Creating hyperlinks to external files
You may have data stored in another file that you want to include in your 
PowerPoint presentation. Rather than copy the data and paste it in your 
presentation, it may be easier just to display the file itself. That way you can 
update the file, and PowerPoint will always link to the updated file.
 
When you create a hyperlink to a file, PowerPoint opens that file by loading 
the program that created it. For example, if you want to view a Microsoft Word 
file, make sure that you have a copy of Microsoft Word installed on your 
computer.
To create a hyperlink that opens an external file, follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight the text in a title or subtitle text box that you want to turn 
into an external file hyperlink.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click the Hyperlink icon in the Links group.
 
 The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears (refer to Figure 13-10).
 
4. Click in the Look In list box and choose a drive and folder that holds 
the file you want to use.
 
 You may need to click through several folders to find the file you want.
 
5. Click the file you want to use and then click OK.
Running a program through a hyperlink
A PowerPoint hyperlink can also run any program from within a presentation. 
For example, you could create a presentation that explains how to market a 

281
 Chapter 13: Showing Off a Presentation
new computer program, and then create a hyperlink to that same program so 
you can demonstrate how that program actually works. When you exit that 
program, you return to your PowerPoint presentation again.
 
Make sure that your computer has enough memory to run both PowerPoint 
and any other program you want to run.
To create a hyperlink that runs a program, follow these steps:
 
1. Highlight the text in a text box that you want to turn into a program 
hyperlink.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click the Action icon in the Links group.
 
 The Action Settings dialog box appears.
 
4. Select the Run Program radio button.
 
5. Click Browse.
 
 The Select a Program to Run dialog box appears.
 
6. Click in the Look In list box to choose the drive that contains the pro-
gram you want to run.
 
7. Click in the folder and then click Open to find the program you want 
to run.
 
 You may have to repeat this step multiple times.
 
8. Click the program you want to run and then click OK.
 
 The Action Settings dialog box appears again.
 
9. Click OK.
Viewing a Presentation
After you finish arranging your slides, adding transitions, and adding hyper-
links, you’re ready to test how your entire presentation looks. To view your 
entire presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Slide Show tab.
 
2. Click the From Beginning icon in the Start Slide Show group, as shown 
in Figure 13-11.
 
 PowerPoint displays the first slide of your presentation.
 
 You can also choose the From Beginning command by pressing F5.

3. Choose one of the following:
 
• Click the mouse or press the spacebar to view the next slide.
 
• Press Esc to exit your presentation.
 
If you have a large presentation consisting of 300 slides, you may not want to 
view the first 290 slides just to test how your last 10 slides look. To avoid this 
problem, click the From Current Slide icon in Step 2.
Creating a custom slide show
You may have a presentation organized for one audience (engineers and sci-
entists) but need to give the same presentation to a different audience (sales 
executives). Although you could copy your original presentation and then 
modify it, now you’ll be stuck with two copies of the same information. And, 
if you modify the information in one presentation, you have to modify the 
same information in the second (or third or fourth) presentation.
To avoid this problem, PowerPoint lets you create custom slide shows based 
on an existing presentation. Such a custom slide show can selectively show 
slides in a different order. To create a custom slide show, you need to define 
the order you want to display the slides.
To arrange the order of a custom slide show, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Slide Show tab.
 
2. Click the Custom Slide Show icon in the Start Slide Show group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
3. Choose Custom Shows.
 
 The Custom Shows dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-12.

shows you’ve created.
 
3. Click the name of the custom slide show you want to view.
 
4. Choose one of the following:
 
• Click the mouse or press the spacebar to view the next slide.
 
• Press Esc to exit your presentation.
Hiding a slide
PowerPoint can hide a slide, which lets you keep your slide but not display it 
during a presentation. Hiding a slide can be especially handy when you need 
to create a custom slide show and need a slide to appear only in the custom 
slide show but not the original presentation (or vice versa).
To hide a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the slide that you want to hide (in Slide or Outline view).
 
2. Click the Slide Show tab.
 
3. Click the Hide Slide icon in the Set Up group.
 
 PowerPoint dims your selected slide.
 
To unhide a slide, just repeat the preceding three steps.
Organizing with Slide Sorter view
After you view your presentation, you may want to rearrange slides. To help 
you organize your presentation, switch to Slide Sorter view, which numbers 
each slide to show you the order that they appear, as shown in Figure 13-14.
To use Slide Sorter view, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the View tab.
 
2. Click the Slide Sorter view icon in the Presentation Views group.
 
 You can also click the Slide Sorter icon in the bottom-right corner of the 
PowerPoint window.

Creating Handouts
When people view a particularly interesting presentation, they often want 
copies of that presentation so they can review the information later or have 
a place to jot down notes during the presentation itself. For that reason, 
PowerPoint lets you create handouts from your presentation.

286
Part IV: Making Presentations with PowerPoint 
Handouts typically contain a thumbnail of each slide along with blank space 
for jotting down notes about the information presented by that slide. To 
create a handout, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
2. Choose Print.
 
 The middle pane displays a variety of print options, as shown in 
Figure 13-15.

with piles of memos, reports, books, and papers. If you’d 
rather use the surface of your desk for writing rather than 
a disorganized filing cabinet, then you may need the help 
of Microsoft Outlook, a combination e-mail program and 
personal organizer.
By using Outlook with your e-mail account, you can 
search, sort, and organize your messages so you an see 
what’s important (fun stuff like messages from your 
friends) while ignoring the annoying messages (like notes 
from your boss). 
Besides helping you organize your e-mail, Outlook can 
also be your personal organizer, helping you keep track of 
tasks that you need to get done and appointments you 
need to keep. 
To help you keep track of all the people in your life, 
Outlook lets you store names, addresses, e-mail 
addresses, and phone numbers of all your important con-
tracts so you’ll be able to find and contact someone right 
away.
By helping organize your life, Outlook gives you time to do 
what you do best — working more productively or just 
gathering more information to store on your computer 
that can give your boss the illusion that you’re actually 
doing something important after all.

M
icrosoft Outlook is the personal organizer portion of Office 2010, 
able to handle information such as your appointments, names and 
addresses of important people, and list of to-do tasks. However, the most 
popular uses for Outlook are reading, writing, and organizing your e-mail.
Configuring E-Mail Settings
The first time you run Outlook, you need to configure your e-mail account 
information. To retrieve e-mail from your account within Outlook, you may 
need to know the following:
 
✓ Your name
 
✓ The username of your e-mail account, which might be JSmith (for Joe 
Smith)
 
✓ Your e-mail address (such as JSmith@microsoft.com)
 
✓ Your e-mail account password
 
✓ Your e-mail account type (such as POP3 or IMAP)
 
✓ Your incoming mail server name (such as pop.microsoft.com)
 
✓ Your outgoing mail server name (such as smtp.microsoft.com)

292
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 
 
Outlook can often recognize many popular e-mail accounts such as Hotmail, 
but if Outlook can’t set up your e-mail account automatically, you will need to 
ask your Internet service provider (ISP) for all these details.
Adding an e-mail account
Before you can use Outlook to manage your e-mail, you must add your e-mail 
account. To add a new e-mail account, follow these steps:
 
1. Load Outlook and click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click Info and then click the Add Account button.
 
 An Add New Account dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-1.
 
Figure 14-1: 
The Add 
New 
Account 
dialog box 
lets you 
create 
an e-mail 
account to 
work with 
Outlook.
 
 
3. Type in the appropriate information and click Next.
 
 You may need to wade through several sets of questions before Outlook 
can properly configure your e-mail account.
 
To delete an e-mail account, right-click on the account name in the left panel 
of the Outlook window. When a pop-up menu appears, choose Remove.
Creating E-Mail
After you set up an e-mail account, you can start sending e-mail. The three 
ways to create and send e-mail are

293
 Chapter 14: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
 
✓ Create a message and type the recipient’s e-mail address manually.
 
✓ Reply to a previously received message. Outlook then adds the recipi-
ent’s e-mail address automatically.
 
✓ Create a message and use a previously stored e-mail address. Outlook 
adds the e-mail address automatically.
Creating a new e-mail message
The most straightforward way to send a message is to type the recipient’s 
e-mail address and then type your message. To create a new e-mail message 
and type the e-mail address, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Mail in the left pane of the Outlook window. (You can also press 
Ctrl+1.)
 
 Outlook displays the Mail pane.
 
2. Click the Home tab and click the New E-mail icon in the New category.
 
 The message window appears, as shown in Figure 14-2. Notice that the 
message window displays a Ribbon with Message, Insert, Options, and 
Format Text tabs.
 
Figure 14-2: 
The 
message 
window lets 
you type 
and format a 
message.
 

294
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 
 
3. Click in the To text box and type the e-mail address of the person you 
want to receive your message.
 
 Make sure that you type the e-mail address correctly. One incorrect 
character, and your message won’t go to your intended recipient.
 
4. (Optional) Click in the Cc text box and type another e-mail address to 
send the message to more than one person.
 
5. Click in the Subject text box and type a brief description of your 
message.
 
 Many people use spam filters that examine the Subject line of a mes-
sage, so it’s a good idea not to type your subject text in ALL CAPITAL 
LETTERS or use multiple exclamation points!!! Otherwise, your recipi-
ent’s spam filter may inadvertently flag your message as spam and 
delete it before anyone can even read it.
 
6. Click in the message text box and type your message.
 
 If you click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar, you can store the 
message in your Drafts folder so you can edit and send it at a later time.
 
7. Click the Send icon to send your message.
Replying to an e-mail message
Oftentimes, you may receive a message from someone else and want to send 
a reply to that person. When you send a reply, Outlook automatically copies 
the original message as part of your e-mail; that way, the recipient can read 
the original message that you’re responding to.
Even better, when you reply to a message, you won’t have to retype the 
recipient’s e-mail address and risk misspelling it. To reply to an e-mail mes-
sage, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Mail in the left pane of the Outlook window. (You can also press 
Ctrl+1.)
 
 Outlook displays the Mail pane.
 
2. Click the Inbox folder.
 
 Outlook displays the Inbox pane that lists all the messages you’ve 
received.
 
3. Click a message that you want to reply to.
 
 Outlook displays the contents of that message in a pane on the right 
side of the Outlook window.

295
 Chapter 14: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
 
4. Click the Home tab and click the Reply icon in the Respond category.
 
 Outlook displays a message window with the recipient’s e-mail address 
and subject line already typed in, along with a copy of the original 
message.
 
 If you click the Forward icon instead of the Reply icon, you can send a 
message to another person instead of the person who originally sent 
you the message.
 
5. Click in the message text box and type your message.
 
 If you click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar, you can store the 
message in your Drafts folder so you can edit and send it at a later time.
 
6. Click the Send icon.
Using a stored e-mail address to 
create a new e-mail message
If you send e-mail to certain people regularly, you can type that person’s 
e-mail address once, store it, and then have Outlook type that e-mail address 
whenever you need it again.
To store an e-mail address, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Mail in the left pane of the Outlook window. (You can also press 
Ctrl+1.)
 
 Outlook displays the Mail pane.
 
2. Click the Home tab and click the Address Book icon in the Find 
category.
 
 The Address Book: Contacts window appears, as shown in Figure 14-3.
 
3. Choose File➪New Entry.
 
 A New Entry dialog box appears.
 
4. Choose New Contact and click OK.
 
 A Contact window appears, as shown in Figure 14-4.
 
5. Click in the Full Name text box and type a person’s name.
 
6. Click in the E-mail text box and type a person’s e-mail address.
 
7. Click the Save & Close icon.
 
 Your newly added name appears in the Address Book: Contacts window.
 
8. Choose File➪Close.

5. Click the To button at the bottom of the Select Names: Contacts 
dialog box.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Outlook automatically enters your chosen e-mail address in the To 
text box.

 If you click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar, you can store the 
message in your Drafts folder so you can edit and send it at a later time.
 
9. Click the Send icon to send your message.
Attaching Files to Messages
Rather than just send plain text, you can also attach a file to your message. 
This file can be anything from a picture, a song (stored as an audio file), a 
program, a video file, or even another e-mail message.
 
Be careful when attaching files to messages because many ISPs put a limit on 
the maximum size of an e-mail message, such as 10MB. Also try to keep any 
file attachments small because if the recipient has a slow Internet connection, 
downloading a large file attachment can take a really long time.
If you want to send someone a picture, video, audio file, compressed file, or 
even an entire program, you need to attach that file to a message by following 
these steps:
 
1. Follow the steps in the earlier section, “Creating E-Mail,” to create a 
new e-mail message, type a subject, and type an e-mail address.
 
2. Click the Insert tab.
 
3. Click the Attach File icon in the Include group.
 
 The Insert File dialog box appears.

298
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 
 
4. Click the file you want to attach to your message and then click Insert.
 
 Outlook displays an Attach text box in the message window, as shown in 
Figure 14-5.
 
 If you hold down the Ctrl or Shift key while clicking a file, you can select 
multiple files at once.
 
Figure 14-5: 
Every 
message 
with a file 
attachment 
displays an 
Attach text 
box that 
displays the 
filename 
attached 
to the 
message.
 
 
5. (Optional) Click the Attach button to display the Insert File dialog box 
so you can select more files.
 
6. (Optional) Right-click any file in the Attachment text box; when a 
pop-up menu appears, choose Remove if you change your mind about 
attaching a file to a message.
 
7. Click the Send icon.
 
Rather than select multiple files to attach to a message, you can compress or 
zip multiple files into a single compressed file by using a separate program 
like WinZip or by using the built-in Zip compression feature in Windows.

 Chapter 14: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
Reading and Organizing E-Mail
One of the biggest problems with receiving e-mail is trying to sort through 
all the important messages. To help you organize your e-mail, Outlook offers 
several ways to group related messages together and search for specific text 
in messages so you can find exactly what you need.
Grouping messages into categories
Outlook can display messages with the newest message on top and the oldest 
message at the bottom (or vice versa). In addition, Outlook can also group 
messages according to Date, Subject, Size, or even by e-mail accounts.
To view and sort your e-mail messages, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Mail in the left pane of the Outlook window. (You can also press 
Ctrl+1.)
 
 Outlook displays the Mail pane.
 
2. Click the Arrange by column heading in the middle pane.
 
 A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 14-6.
 
Figure 14-6: 
Clicking the 
Arrange 
by column 
displays 
a menu of 
other ways 
to organize 
e-mail.
 

300
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 
 
3. Click on a category such as Date or Conversation.
 
4. Click in the Newest on top column heading.
 
 Each time you click this heading, it toggles to display Newest on top or 
Oldest on top.
Viewing messages in the conversation view
By default, Outlook organizes received messages by Conversation. This 
essentially keeps all messages that you reply to and get a response back 
grouped together so you can review the flow of the conversation from each 
message.
To view a conversation, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Mail in the left pane of the Outlook window. (You can also press 
Ctrl+1.)
 
 Outlook displays the Mail pane.
 
2. Click the Arrange by column heading in the middle pane and choose 
Conversation.
 
3. Click on a message.
 
 If you have replied to this message and received replies before, Outlook 
displays a list of related messages received, as shown in Figure 14-7.
 
Figure 14-7: 
A message 
with 
multiple 
replies.
 

301
 Chapter 14: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
 
4. Click on any message underneath the message you selected in Step 3.
 
 Outlook displays your chosen message so you can review the trail of 
messages that led up to the latest message.
Retrieving a file attachment 
from a message
Rather than just send text, people might send you pictures, word processor 
documents, or databases as file attachments. When you receive a message 
with a file attachment, Outlook displays a paper clip icon next to the message.
 
Never open a file attachment unless you absolutely trust its contents. Many 
malicious hackers send viruses, worms, spyware, and Trojan Horses as file 
attachments, so if you aren’t careful, you could accidentally infect your com-
puter and lose your data.
To open a file attachment, follow these steps:
 
1. Click a message that displays a paper clip icon.
 
 Outlook displays the message’s contents in the right pane of the Outlook 
window, as shown in Figure 14-8.
 
Figure 14-8: 
The file 
attachment 
appears as 
a tiny icon.
 
 
2. Double-click the file (paper clip) icon displayed in the message.
 
 Your chosen files appear.

302
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 
 
If you right-click on the paper clip icon in Step 2, a pop-up menu appears. Then 
you can click Preview and see a preview of the file contents without opening it.
Deleting E-Mail Messages
To keep your Inbox folder from getting too cluttered, you can always delete 
messages that you’re sure you’ll never need to read again. To delete a mes-
sage, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Mail in the left pane of the Outlook window. (You can also press 
Ctrl+1.)
 
 Outlook displays the Mail pane.
 
2. Click a message in the Mail pane that you want to delete.
 
3. Press Delete or click the Home tab and click the Delete icon in the 
Delete group.
 
If you accidentally delete the wrong e-mail message, you can undelete it by 
pressing Ctrl+Z or clicking the Undo icon in the Quick Access toolbar.
When you delete messages, Outlook stores them in the Deleted Items folder 
so you can always retrieve them later. To retrieve a deleted message, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click Mail in the left pane of the Outlook window. (You can also press 
Ctrl+1.)
 
 Outlook displays the Mail pane.
 
2. Click on the Deleted Items icon in the Mail Folders pane.
 
 A list of deleted e-mail messages appears.
 
3. Right-click on a deleted message and choose Move➪Other Folder.
 
 The Move Items dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 14-9.
 
Figure 14-9: 
Move an 
item to 
another 
folder.
 

303
 Chapter 14: Managing E-Mail with Outlook
 
4. Click a folder (such as Inbox) to store your message and then click OK.
 
 Outlook removes your message from the Deleted Items folder and stores 
it in the folder you chose.
If you delete a message from the Deleted Items folder, that message will be 
gone forever. To clean out your Deleted Items folder (to save space or to 
destroy incriminating e-mail messages), follow these steps:
 
1. Click Mail in the left pane of the Outlook window. (You can also press 
Ctrl+1.)
 
 Outlook displays the Mail pane.
 
2. Choose one of the following:
 
• Click a message.
 
• Hold down the Ctrl key and click each message you want to delete.
 
• Hold down the Shift key, click the first message you want to delete, 
and then click the last message you want to delete.
 
 Outlook selects all the messages in between the first and last mes-
sages you selected.
 
3. Press Delete or click the Home tab and click the Delete icon in the 
Delete group.
 
 A dialog box appears, asking whether you’re sure that you want to 
delete your selected messages.
 
 If you delete any messages from the Deleted Items folder, you will not be 
able to retrieve them ever again for the rest of eternity.
 
4. Click Yes (or No).
 
 To help avoid unwanted e-mail messages, give out your e-mail address 
sparingly. To find how to filter out unwanted messages, see Chapter 19 
for tips on configuring Outlook to detect and block spam.

▶ Setting an appointment
▶ Storing names and addresses
▶ Tracking your tasks
O
utlook 2010 is more than just an e-mail program; it’s also a complete 
personal organizer to help you keep track of appointments, names and 
addresses, and to-do tasks. With Outlook helping keep your life organized, 
you no longer have an excuse not to get anything done on time — unless, of 
course, you really don’t want to do it.
Setting Appointments
Everyone can get busy and miss deadlines and appointments. To avoid this 
problem, let Outlook keep track of your schedule. That way, you’ll know what 
days and times you’ll be busy and when you’ll be free to do anything else.
Making an appointment
Before you can add an appointment to Outlook, you need to decide which 
day that appointment will occur and what time it will start. You can also add 
details like how long it should last and where it takes place, but the impor-
tant part is to define the date and time. To do this, you need to look at the 
Outlook calendar.
Outlook offers several ways to display its calendar:
 
✓ Day: Displays a single time divided into 24 hours
 
✓ Week: Displays a single week divided into five or seven days
 
✓ Month: Displays a single month divided into days

306
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 
Outlook lets you define starting and ending times of an appointment in half-
hour increments such as 1:30 or 11:00 whether you’re using the day, week, or 
month calendar. To set an appointment, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Calendar button in the left pane of the Outlook window (or 
press Ctrl+2).
 
 Outlook displays the Calendar view.
 
2. Click the Home tab and then click the Day, Work Week (5 days), Week 
(7 days), or Month icon in the Arrange category.
 
 Outlook displays the Calendar based on the time frame you chose, such 
as Work Week or Month, as shown in Figure 15-1.
 
 You can also click the New Appointment icon on the Home tab to define 
an appointment.
 
3. Double-click the day (or time if you’re in the Day calendar) where you 
want to schedule an appointment.
 
 Outlook displays the Appointment window, as shown in Figure 15-2.

4. Click in the Subject text box and type a brief description of your 
appointment, such as Another boring meeting with Mike or Meet with 
reluctant client.
 
5. (Optional) Click in the Location text box and type the location of your 
appointment, such as Break Room 10 or Back alley near the dumpster.
 
 If you often set appointments for specific locations, Outlook will remem-
ber these locations. In the future, just click the downward-pointing 
arrow in the Location text box and then click a previously used location 
in the list that appears.
 
6. Click in the Start Time list box and choose a time. 
 
 You can also type a time directly in the Start time list box, such as 9:53, 
or even choose a different date.
 
7. Click in the End Time list box and choose a time. 
 
 You can also type a time directly in the End time list box, such as 2:23, 
or even choose a different date.
 
8. Click in the big text box and type any additional information you want 
to store about your appointment, such as items you need to bring or 
information you want to remind yourself about the person you’re 
meeting.

308
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 
 
9. Click the Save & Close icon in the Actions group.
 
 Outlook displays your appointment in Day, Week, or Month view of the 
calendar, as shown in Figure 15-3.
 
If you need to edit an appointment, just double-click on it to display the 
Appointment window again. You can also drag an appointment from one loca-
tion on the calendar to another to switch it to a different time or date.
Viewing appointments
If you store several appointments, you might find it hard to keep track of 
them all. To help you out, Outlook can display your appointments as a pic-
ture so you can see the times and dates when you have something planned.
To visually see your appointments, click the Home tab and then click the 
Schedule View icon in the Arrange group. Outlook displays your appoint-
ments so you can quickly spot your free and busy times, as shown in 
Figure 15-4.

Deleting an appointment
After an appointment has passed or been canceled, you can delete it to make 
room for other appointments. To delete an appointment, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click on an appointment to open the Appointment window.
 
2. Click Delete (or press Ctrl+D).
 
 Outlook deletes your appointment.
 
If you delete an appointment by mistake, press Ctrl+Z to recover it.
Storing Names and Addresses
Everyone has important names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and phone num-
bers that need to be saved. Rather than use Access or another complicated 
database program to store this type of information, it’s much easier to use 
Outlook.

Adding a name
To store a name in Outlook, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Contacts button in the left pane of the Outlook window (or 
press Ctrl+3).
 
 Outlook displays the Contacts view.
 
2. Click the Home tab and click the New Contact icon in the New group.

3. Type the information you want to store about each person, such as the 
name in the Full Name text box.
 
 You can store as much or as little data about a person as you want. For 
example, you may not want to store someone’s home phone number or 
IM (instant messaging) address.
 
4. Click the Save & Close button.
 
 Outlook saves your information.

 Chapter 15: Calendars, Contacts, and Tasks
Viewing names
After you’ve stored one or more names in Outlook, you’ll probably need to 
find it again. If you just want to browse through your list of names, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Contacts button in the left pane of the Outlook window (or 
press Ctrl+3).
 
 Outlook displays the Contacts view.
 
2. Click the Home tab and click the Business Card or Card icon in the 
Current View group.
 
 The Business Card displays names and additional information as large 
windows, as shown in Figure 15-6. The Card view displays names as 
smaller windows, allowing you to see more names on the screen.

3. Double-click on a name to open the Contact window.
 
 The Contact window opens, allowing you to edit or add new information 
to your chosen contact.

312
Part V: Getting Organized with Outlook 
Searching names
If you know all or part of a name or other information about a person, 
you can exhaustively browse through your entire list of stored contacts. 
However, it’s much easier to just search for that information instead.
That way, if you know you want to find a person named Bill, you just have to 
search for “Bill.” Likewise, if you know you need to call someone located in 
the 408 area code, you could just search for “408” and Outlook will show you 
all contacts with a phone number in that particular area code. 
Searching makes it easier to find a particular name. To search for a name, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Contacts button in the left pane of the Outlook window (or 
press Ctrl+3).
 
 Outlook displays the Contacts view.
 
2. Click the Home tab and click in the Search Contacts text box (or press 
Ctrl+ E).
 
 The cursor appears in the Search Contacts text box.
 
3. Type as much data as you can about the person you want to find, such 
as typing all or part of a name or phone number.
 
4. Press Enter.
 
 Outlook displays all contacts that match your search criteria that you 
typed in Step 3.
 
5. Click the Close Search icon that appears at the far right of the Search 
Contacts text box.
 
 Outlook displays all your contacts once more.
Managing Tasks
Everyone’s busy. However, the big difference between busy, efficient people 
and overwhelmed people is that busy people simply know how to manage 
their tasks so they get things done.
To help you manage your tasks, Outlook lets you store your most impor-
tant tasks and assign due dates and priorities. Now at a glance, you can see 
what’s most important for you to focus on. By spending more of your time on 
important tasks and less of your time on trivial matters, you’ll become more 
efficient (provided you actually do the work you’re supposed to be doing).

313
 Chapter 15: Calendars, Contacts, and Tasks
Storing a task
A goal is simply a dream with a deadline. When storing tasks in Outlook, you 
need to define what it is that you want to do and set a date for when you 
want to complete it. 
Microsoft OneNote 2010
If you need to take notes in meetings, you’re 
probably dragging your laptop around and 
typing notes in a Microsoft Word document. 
There’s nothing wrong with that, except by the 
end of the meeting, your notes will appear in 
one long document and you’ll need to edit those 
notes so you can keep track of everything you 
wrote.
While you can use Microsoft Word to jot down 
notes, you may prefer using a more specialized 
note-taking program called Microsoft OneNote 
2010. Like Microsoft Word, Microsoft OneNote 
lets you type and store notes. However, the pro-
gram goes much farther than that.
OneNote lets you divide your notes into sec-
tions to help you find what you need. Instead 
of typing everything on a single page like 
Microsoft Word forces you to do, OneNote lets 
you create one section for action items and 
another section for upcoming meetings to keep 
the project on track.
Now when you want to read your notes, you 
don’t have to scroll through endless pages like 
in Microsoft Word. Instead, you can just flip to 
the section that contains the information you 
want to find. Think of the difference between 
trying to find information printed on a scroll of 
paper (Microsoft Word) or information orga-
nized in separate sections like tabs in a note-
book (OneNote).
If you have a microphone and a webcam, you 
can even capture audio and video to store in 
your notes. That way you can capture an entire 
classroom lecture or meeting in audio or video, 
and then jot down notes at the same time. To 
review, you can study your written notes as 
well as replay the audio or video to catch some-
thing you might have missed earlier. 
Because notes don’t always rely on words, 
OneNote also lets you draw pictures, which can 
be handy for capturing ideas visually. Now you 
can use both your left brain (words) and right 
brain (pictures) to capture notes during any 
classroom lecture or meeting.
More important, OneNote can link to Outlook 
to share data. If you’re in a meeting, you might 
need to write down a task for yourself and a 
future appointment. Now you could retype all 
that information into Outlook later, or just trans-
fer that data from OneNote to Outlook with the 
click of the mouse. By working with Outlook, 
OneNote lets you capture information and store 
it in Outlook so you can keep track of your busy 
schedule.
OneNote can be a great note-taking program 
by itself, but when combined with Outlook, the 
two programs make an efficient information-
gathering system.

Part VI
Storing Stuff 
in Access

In this part . . .
I
n the old days, people wrote important information on 
paper and then stored these important papers in filing 
cabinets where they would never be able to find this 
important information again even if their lives depended 
on it. To avoid this problem, Microsoft Office 2010 pro-
vides Access, a program specially designed to help you 
store important information that you can’t afford to lose. 
You can use Access to store names and addresses, or you 
can use it to store, sort, and organize names and 
addresses of your most important customers so you’ll 
know who has a birthday, who hasn’t spent money with 
you lately, who has spent money with you lately, and who 
your best customers might be. 
Information is more than just storage – it involves analyz-
ing and manipulating that data as well. Using Access, 
you’ll be able to search through your data in a slit second, 
even if you have thousands of names stored in your data-
base. Access also lets you filter through your data to find 
just the best customers who live in Alaska, earn more 
than $75,000 a year, and own two boats and a cat. 
Best of all, Access can slice and dice your information to 
create reports so you can print out your information and 
use it to decipher what your information might mean. 
Who are your best customers and what are their charac-
teristics? Once you known this information through 
Access’s filtering and analyzing capabilities, you’ll be able 
to pinpoint the best potential customers to spend your 
marketing dollars wisely by going after the customers 
most likely to give you the greatest amount of money.
If all this sounds like a miracle, it’s not. With a database 
like Access, you can store, manipulate, and analyze any 
type of data for whatever purpose you need. By browsing 
through this part of the book, you’ll learn how to tame 
Access for your needs and turn your computer into a tool 
for understanding your information (or at least pretending 
that you do).

Chapter 16
Using a Database
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how databases work
▶ Designing a database
▶ Editing a database
▶ Typing information into a database
▶ Closing a database
A
 database is a program that stores information such as names, addresses, 
and phone numbers, or inventory part numbers, shipping dates, cus-
tomer codes, and any other type of information that you think is worth saving.
To help you store information in a database, Office 2010 comes with the 
database program, Access. Access provides two huge advantages over stor-
ing information on paper. First, Access can store literally billions of chunks 
of information (try doing that with a filing cabinet). Second, Access makes it 
easy to search and sort through your information in the blink of an eye.
 
The three main advantages of a computer database over a paper database are
 
✓ Massive storage: The largest computer database can fit on a hard drive, 
but a paper database might take a roomful of file cabinets.
 
✓ Fast retrieval: Searching for a single name in a computer database is 
fast and easy. Doing the same thing in a paper database is difficult, error 
prone, and nearly impossible with a large database.
 
✓ Reporting: A report can help you make sense out of your data, such as 
showing a list of customers who earn a certain amount of money and 
live in a specific area. Trying to find this information in a paper database 
is time consuming and error prone.

320
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
Understanding the Basics of a Database
A database is nothing more than a file that contains useful information that 
you need to save and retrieve in the future. A database can consist of a single 
name and address, or several million names and addresses.
A typical Access database file consists of several parts:
 
✓ Fields: A field contains a single chunk of information, such as name, 
street address, or phone number.
 
✓ Records: A record consists of one or more fields. A business card is a 
paper version of a database record that stores fields (name, address, 
phone number, and so on) about a single person (record).
 
✓ Tables: A table displays records in rows and columns, much like a 
spreadsheet. Tables group related records, such as records of all your 
customers or records of all your invoices.
 
✓ Forms: A form displays all the fields of a single record on-screen, mim-
icking a paper form, so that you can add, edit, or view a single record at 
a time.
 
✓ Queries: A query lets you retrieve certain information based on your cri-
teria, such as only retrieving names and addresses of people who earn 
more than $50,000 a year and have children.
 
✓ Reports: A report arranges your data in a certain way, such as showing 
all customers who placed more than 1,000 orders last year or all custom-
ers who live within a certain zip code.
 
Access is known as a relational database. Basically, this means that you can 
store data in separate tables and link or “relate” them together to avoid dupli-
cating data in multiple tables. One table might contain customer names and 
addresses while a separate, related table might contain those same custom-
ers’ purchase orders.
Here are the two basic steps to using a database. First, you need to design 
your database, which means deciding what type of information your data-
base will hold, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone num-
bers, and so on.
After you design a database, the second step is filling it with actual data, 
such as typing the name Bob Jones in the Name field or the e-mail address 
BJones@somecompany.com in the E-mail field.
When you first create a database, you’ll probably start out with a single table 
that contains customer information. Inside the Customer Information table 
will be multiple records where each record represents a single customer. 

321
 Chapter 16: Using a Database
Each record will consist of multiple fields, such as Last Name, Company 
Name, Phone Number, and E-mail Address.
To help you edit and view your database table information, you might even-
tually want to create a form that displays your fields on the screen mimicking 
a paper form that’s easy to read.
If you find yourself searching for the same type of information on a regular 
basis, such as looking for the names of your best customers (say, those who 
order more than $1,000 worth of products from you a week), you can store 
this search criteria as a query. Then you can just click on the query name 
and make Access show you exactly what you want to find.
Finally, you may want to print your data in a way that makes sense to you, 
such as printing a quarterly sales report. By saving your printing criteria in a 
report, you can make Access print selected data on a page that’s easy for you 
to read and understand.
 
Features like forms, queries, and reports are optional but handy. Features like 
tables, records, and fields are necessary to store your information in your 
database.
Designing a Database
To design a database, you need to first create a database table and then 
define the names of all the fields you want to store in that particular table. 
Database tables let you divide a file into separate parts. For example, one 
database table may hold the names and addresses of all your customers, a 
second database table may hold the names and addresses of all your employ-
ees, and a third database table may hold the names and addresses of your 
suppliers. Access stores all this related information in a single Access file 
that’s saved on your hard drive, as illustrated in Figure 16-1.
 
Figure 16-1: 
You can 
divide an 
Access file 
into sepa-
rate tables 
that contain 
different 
fields.

322
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
To design your database, you can create a database from scratch or use an 
existing template, which you can modify. Designing a database means defin-
ing both the number of fields to use for storing information and the maximum 
amount of data each field can hold.
If you have a field that stores numbers, what are the maximum and minimum 
limits on the numbers you want to save in that field? If you’re storing some-
one’s age, you probably don’t want the field to contain negative numbers or 
numbers beyond 200. If your field needs to hold salaries, the field may need 
to hold large numbers but no negative numbers.
 
In general, store information in separate fields. So rather than create a single 
field to hold someone’s full name, create two separate fields: One field holds 
a first name and the second field holds the last name. By storing last names in 
a separate field, you can easily yank last names out of your database to create 
form letters that state, “The Smith family has just won $200,000 dollars in the 
Publisher’s Sales Pitch Sweepstakes!”
Access can create a blank database or a special database by using one of 
many templates available from the Microsoft Web site. No matter how you 
create a database, you will likely need to modify it to customize it for the type 
of data you want to store.
To create a database, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
2. Choose New.
 
 Access displays a variety of options, as shown in Figure 16-2.
 
3. Click on an icon such as Blank Database or a database template. 
 
 If you click on a template, the right pane shows a preview of your 
template.
 
4. Click in the File Name text box and type a descriptive name for your 
database.
 
 If you click on the folder icon that appears to the right of the File Name 
text box, you can open a dialog box that will let you define a specific 
drive and folder to store your database file.
 
5. Click the Create button to create your database file.
 
 Access displays your database.

Editing and Modifying a Database
After you create a database from scratch or from a template, you need to 
modify it by giving each field a descriptive name, defining the size of each 
field, or adding and deleting a field.
Naming a field
If you create a database from scratch, Access displays generic field names 
such as Field1. If you create a database from a template, you’ll see the 
descriptive field names, but you may still want to rename the fields to some-
thing else.
To rename a field, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the table 
that contains the fields you want to rename.
 
 Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.

324
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
 
2. Double-click the field (column head) that you want to rename.
 
 Access highlights the column.
 
3. Type a new name for your field and then press Enter when you’re 
done.
Adding and deleting a field
Sometimes you may need to add a field to make room to store new informa-
tion. Other times, you may want to delete a field that you don’t really want 
after all. To add a field to a database table, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the 
Click to Add heading.
 
 A menu appears, as shown in Figure 16-3.
 
Figure 16-3: 
The Add 
Field menu.
 
 
2. Choose the type of field you want to add, such as Currency or Text.
 
 Access inserts your field and gives it a generic name like Field3.

325
 Chapter 16: Using a Database
To delete a field from a database table, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the field (column head) you want to delete.
 
 Access highlights the entire column in your database table.
 
2. Click the Delete button in the Add & Delete group.
 
 If you have stored data in that field, a dialog box appears, asking 
whether you want to permanently delete all the data in the field.
 
 If you delete a field, you also delete any data that may be stored in that 
field. Depending on how much data you have stored, you could wipe out 
a lot of information by deleting a single field, so be careful.
 
3. Click Yes (or No).
 
 If you click Yes, Access deletes your chosen field.
Defining the type and size of a field
The type of a field defines the type of data the field can hold (numbers, text, 
dates, and so on), and the size of a field defines the amount of data the field 
can hold (no numbers larger than 250 digits, any text string fewer than 120 
characters, and so on).
The purpose of defining the type and size of a field is to make sure that you 
store only valid data in a particular field. If a field is meant to store names, 
you don’t want someone typing in a number. If a field is meant to store a per-
son’s age, you don’t want the field to accept negative numbers.
To define the type and amount of a data a field can store, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the table 
that contains the fields you want to define.
 
 Access displays the Datasheet view of your table.
 
3. Click the bottom half of the View icon (that displays a downward-
pointing arrow), which appears in the Views group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
4. Click Design View.
 
 Access displays the Design view of your database table.

326
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
 
5. Click in the Field Name column and edit an existing field name.
 
 If you click in a blank row, you can add a field to a database table.
 
6. Click in the Data Type column.
 
 A downward-pointing arrow appears.
 
7. Click the downward-pointing arrow.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, listing all the different types of data you can 
define to store in a field, as shown in Figure 16-4.
 
Figure 16-4: 
You can 
choose a 
specific 
data type 
to make 
sure that a 
field stores 
the correct 
information.
 
 
8. Choose a data type, such as Number, Text, or Date/Time.
 
 Access displays a General tab at the bottom of the screen, which con-
tains different options for modifying your chosen data type.
 
9. Click one of the data type options, such as Format or Input Mask, 
listed under the General tab.
 
 Sometimes you have to type a value directly into a data type option. 
Other times a pull-down menu appears, from which you can choose an 
option.
 
10. Repeat Step 9 for each data type option you want to modify.
 
 You do not need to modify every data type option.

327
 Chapter 16: Using a Database
Typing Data into a Database
After you create a database table and define fields within that table to hold 
chunks of information, you’re ready to type in actual names, phone numbers, 
and e-mail addresses into each field. Access gives you two ways to enter data:
 
✓ Through Datasheet view
 
✓ Through Form view
Datasheet view displays information in rows and columns, where each row 
represents a single record and each column defines a specific field name. 
Datasheet view can be especially handy for examining multiple records at 
once.
Form view displays all the fields of a single record on-screen. Form view is 
most useful when you just need to view or edit a single record, such as typing 
in the phone number of your cousin or boss.
Using Datasheet view
Datasheet view is the default view for entering data. To view and enter data 
in Datasheet view, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click a table.
 
 Access displays the Datasheet view of your table.
 
2. Click in a field defined by the column and row.
 
 Each column defines a field, such as a name or address. Each row repre-
sents a single record.
 
 If you click in a field that already contains data, you can edit or delete 
that data.
 
3. Press Tab to select the next field (or Shift+Tab to select the preceding 
field).
 
4. Type or edit the data in the field.
Using Form view
The biggest problem with Datasheet view is that it can be confusing to find a 
field for a specific record. Because most people are familiar with paper forms 

328
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
or index cards that arrange related data (fields) on a page, Access offers you 
Form view.
Form view simply displays the fields of a single record on-screen. To use 
Form view, you must first create a form and arrange your fields on that form. 
After you create a form, you can add, edit, and view data through that form.
Creating a form
The simplest way to create a form is to let Access design one for you, which 
you can modify. To create a form quickly, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click a table.
 
 Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
 
2. Click the Create tab.
 
3. Click the Form icon in the Forms group.
 
 Access creates a form, as shown in Figure 16-5. Notice that the form 
name automatically uses the name of the database table you chose in 
Step 3.
 
Figure 16-5: 
Form view 
displays 
multiple 
fields of 
a single 
record.
 

329
 Chapter 16: Using a Database
 
4. Click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar (or press Ctrl+S).
 
 The Save As dialog box appears, asking you to type a name for your form.
 
5. Type a descriptive name for your form in the Form Name text box and 
then click OK.
 
 Access displays your form’s name underneath the All Tables pane. The 
next time you open this database and want to view the form, you can 
double-click the form’s name in the left pane.
Viewing and editing data in a form
After you create a form, you can use it to edit and add data at any time. To 
view a form, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name 
of the form you want to use.
 
 Access displays the Form view of your database. 
 
2. Click one of the following icons (they appear near the bottom of the 
screen) to display a record:
 
• First Record: Displays the first record stored in your file
 
• Previous Record: Displays the preceding record in the file
 
• Next Record: Displays the next record in the file
 
• Last Record: Displays the last record that contains data
 
• New (Blank) Record: Displays a blank form so you can type in data 
that will create a new record in your file
 
3. Click in a field and type the information you want to store, such as a 
name or phone number.
 
You don’t need to use the Save command to save your changes because 
Access automatically saves any data you add or edit in your file as soon as 
you type or edit the data and move the cursor to a new field or record.
Editing a form
A form can be a convenient way to view all the fields of a single record. 
However, you can always rearrange the position of certain fields on-screen 
(to make them easier to find), or you can delete one or more fields alto-
gether. This can be handy to create a form that shows only a filtered view 
of your data, such as a form that shows you only employee names, phone 
numbers, and e-mail addresses instead of also showing you their salaries and 
employee ID numbers at the same time.

330
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
Deleting a field
If you delete a field from a form, you simply prevent the form from displaying 
any data stored in that field. For example, if you don’t want to see each per-
son’s hire date, you can delete the Hire Date field from your form.
 
Deleting a field on a form doesn’t erase any data; it just keeps you from seeing 
that data on a particular form.
To delete a field from a form, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name 
of the form you want to use.
 
 Access displays the Form view of your database.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the View icon in the 
Views group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
4. Choose Design View.
 
 Access shows your chosen form in Design view, which displays a back-
ground grid to help you align fields on your form.
 
5. Click a field you want to delete.
 
 Access highlights your chosen field.
 
 Each field consists of a field label and the actual field itself. The field 
label contains descriptive text that defines the data, such as Name, Age, 
or Sales. The field contains the actual data, such as “Fred,” 47, or $34.08.
 
6. Click the Delete icon in the Records group.
 
 Access deletes your chosen field.
 
 If you press Ctrl+Z right away, you can undelete any field that you just 
deleted.
 
7. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the View icon in the 
Views group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
8. Choose Form View.
 
 Access shows your form with the deleted field missing.
Adding a field
Before you can add a field to a form, you must make sure that the field 
already exists in your database table. For example, if you want to add a field 

331
 Chapter 16: Using a Database
on a form that displays phone numbers, you must first create that field in 
your database table and then stuff it with actual data.
To add a field to a form, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name 
of the form you want to use.
 
 Access displays the Form view of your database.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the View icon in the 
Views group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
4. Choose Design View.
 
 Access displays your form in Design view.
 
5. Click the Design tab.
 
6. Click the Add Existing Fields icon in the Tools group.
 
 The Field List window appears, as shown in Figure 16-6.
 
Figure 16-6: 
The Field 
List window 
shows you 
all the fields 
stored in 
your data-
base table 
that you

332
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
 
7. Double-click a field.
 
 Access displays the field label and a field on your form.
 
8. (Optional) Move the mouse pointer over the upper-right corner of the 
field label and drag the mouse (hold down the left mouse button and 
move the mouse) to move the field label on your form.
 
9. (Optional) Repeat Step 8, except move the field instead of the field 
label.
 
10. Click the downward-pointing arrow underneath the View icon in the 
Views group and choose Form View.
 
 Access displays the Form view. Notice that the form displays both your 
newly added field and any data stored in that field.
Closing and Saving a Database
When you’re done using a database file, you can either close it or exit Access 
altogether. Access gives you two options for closing a database:
 
✓ Close a single database table.
 
✓ Close the entire Access database file.
Closing a database table
Closing a single database table simply removes the data from view. After you 
close a database table, you can open another one. (You don’t have to close a 
database table to open another one, but if you know you won’t need to view a 
particular database table, you might as well close it to get it out of the way.)
To close a database table, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the database table tab that you want to close.
 
 A pop-up menu appears.
 
2. Choose Close.
 
 Access closes your chosen database table.
 
If you choose Close All, you can close all open database tables so you won’t 
have to right-click each tab and close the tables one at a time.

333
 Chapter 16: Using a Database
Closing a database file
Closing a database file keeps Access running so you can open another data-
base file. To close a database file but keep Access running, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab and when the Backstage View appears, choose Close 
Database.
 
 To exit Access, choose Exit Access instead.
 
 If you haven’t saved any changes to the design of your database, a dialog 
box appears, asking whether you want to save your changes.
 
2. Click Yes (or No).
 
 Access remains running so you can load another database file.
 
When you save an Access database, you’re saving only the changes you made 
to the database table or form. Access automatically saves any data you type 
or edit in your database file. (When you type or edit data, Access saves it as 
soon as you move the cursor to a new field or record.)

would prove tedious and time consuming. Yet, Access can search for this 
information at the blink of an eye.
If you search for specific types of data on a regular basis, you probably 
don’t want to keep telling Access what to search for over and over again. To 
simplify this, you can create a query. A query lets you define specific ways 
to search your data and save those parameters so you can retrieve data 
instantly the next time you need it.
Besides searching through data, Access can also sort data. Sorting can be as 
simple as organizing names alphabetically, or it can be more complicated, 
such as sorting names according to zip code, annual salary, and alphabeti-
cally by last name. Sorting simply rearranges your data so you can study it 
from a new point of view.
By searching, sorting, and querying your data, you can extract useful infor-
mation about your data.

Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
Searching a Database
A paper database is useful for storing information, but not so useful for find-
ing it again. If you have a thousand business cards stored in a Rolodex file, 
how much time do you want to waste trying to find the phone number of a 
single person?
Searching a database is crucial to make your data useful, so Access provides 
two ways to search a database:
 
✓ Search for a specific record.
 
✓ Use a filter to show one or more records that meet a specific criterion.
Searching for a specific record
The simplest type of search looks for a specific record. To search for a 
record, you need to know the data stored in at least one of its fields, such as 
a phone number or e-mail address.
The more information you already know, the more likely Access will find the 
one record you want. If you search for all records that contain the first name 
Bill, Access could find dozens of records. If you just search for all records 
that contain the first name Bill, the last name Johnson, and a state address of 
Alaska, Access will likely find just the record you want.
To search for a specific record in a database table, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name 
of the database table you want to search.
 
 Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the Find icon in the Find group.
 
 The Find and Replace dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-1.
 
4. Click in the Find What text box and type in the data you know is 
stored in the record you want to find.
 
 For example, if you want to find the phone number of a person but you 
know only that person’s last name, you type that person’s last name in 
the Find What text box.
 
5. Click the Look In list box and choose Current field or Current 
document.

337
 Chapter 17: Searching, Sorting, and Querying a Database
 
Figure 17-1: 
Search for 
a specific 
record in a

table.
 
 
6. (Optional) Click in the Match list box and choose one of the following:
 
• Any Part of Field: The Find What text can appear in any part of a 
field.
 
• Whole Field: The Find What text is the only text stored in a field.
 
• Start of Field: The Find What text can be only at the beginning of a 
field.
 
7. (Optional) Click in the Search list box and choose one of the following:
 
• Up: Searches from the record where the cursor appears, up to the 
beginning of the database table
 
• Down: Searches from the record where the cursor appears, down 
to the end of the database table
 
• All: Searches the entire database table
 
8. Click Find Next.
 
 Access highlights the field where it finds the text you typed in Step 4.
 
9. Repeat Step 8 to search for more records that might contain the text 
you typed in Step 4.
 
10. Click Cancel or the Close button.
Filtering a database
Searching a database is easy but somewhat limited because you can retrieve 
only a record that matches any text that you want to find. If you want to find 
multiple records, you can use a filter.
A filter lets you tell Access to display only those records that meet certain cri-
teria, such all records that contain people who earn more than $200,000 a year, 
are currently married, live in Las Vegas, Nevada, and own two or more cats.

338
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
To filter a database table, you must tell Access which field to use as a filter, 
and then you must define the criteria for that filter. For example, if you want 
to filter your database table to see only those records listing the names of 
people who are at least 65, you filter the Age field and set the criterion to 
Greater than or equal to 65.
 
Filtering simply hides all records in a database table that don’t match your cri-
teria. Filtering doesn’t delete or erase any records.
Using an exact match for a filter
The simplest filtering criterion searches for an exact match. When you filter 
a field by an exact match, you’re telling Access, “I want to see only those 
records that contain this specific chunk of data in this particular field.” By 
using an exact match filter, you could display only those records that contain 
CA in the State field.
To filter a database table, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name 
of the database table you want to filter.
 
 Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click in the field (column) that you want to use as a filter.
 
4. Click the Filter icon in the Sort & Filter group.
 
 A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 17-2.
 
Figure 17-2: 
The Filter 
pop-up 
menu lets 
you specify 
the criteria 
for a spe-
cific field.
 

339
 Chapter 17: Searching, Sorting, and Querying a Database
 
5. (Optional) Clear one or more of the check boxes that appear to the left 
of the list of data that appears in the field you chose in Step 3.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 Access displays the filtered view of your database table of only those 
items that appeared selected in Step 5.
 
7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 for each additional field you want to filter.
Filtering by form
One problem with defining filters in Datasheet view is that you have all your 
database table records cluttering the screen. To avoid this problem, Access 
lets you define filters by using a form, which basically displays an empty 
record so you can click the fields that you want to use to filter your database 
table.
To define a filter by form, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name 
of the database table that you want to filter.
 
 Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the Advanced icon in the Sort & Filter group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
4. Choose Filter By Form, as shown in Figure 17-3.
 
 Access displays a blank record.
 
Figure 17-3: 
The 
Advanced 
pop-up 
menu lets 
you specify 
the criteria 
for a spe-
cific field. 
 
5. Click in any field.
 
 A downward-pointing arrow appears.

340
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
 
6. Click the downward-pointing arrow.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, listing all the data currently stored in that 
field, as shown in Figure 17-4.
 
Figure 17-4: 
Filtering by 
form lets 
you choose 
the type of 
data you 
want to 
view from a

7. Click the data you want.
 
 You can only click on one entry in the list.
 
8. Click the Toggle Filter icon in the Sort & Filter group.
 
 Access displays a filtered view of your database table.
Using a filter criteria
Searching for an exact match in a field can be handy, but sometimes you may 
want to see records that meet certain criteria, such as finding the names of 
everyone whose salary is greater than $50,000 a year. Instead of filtering by 
an exact match, you have to define the filter criteria.
The type of data stored in each field determines the type of criteria you can 
create. Three common types of data stored in fields include Text, Numbers, 
and Dates, which you can filter in different ways, as shown in Table 17-1.

 Chapter 17: Searching, Sorting, and Querying a Database
 
 Access filters your database table according to your criteria.
 
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7 for each additional filter you want to add.
Clearing a filter
When you apply a filter to a database table, you see only those records that 
match that filter. Access displays a Filtered message at the bottom of the 
screen to let you know when you’re looking at a filtered database table.
To remove a filter so you can see all the records, choose one of the following:
 
✓ Click the Toggle Filter icon in the Sort & Filter group.
 
✓ Click the Filtered or Unfiltered button on the status bar near the bottom 
of the screen.
Access temporarily turns off any filters so you can see all the information 
stored in your database table.
 
When you choose the Save command (Ctrl+S) to save a database table, Access 
also saves your last filter. The next time you open that database table, you’ll 
be able to use the last filter you created. If you want to save multiple filters, 
you’ll have to save them as a query (see the section “Querying a Database” 
later in this chapter).
Sorting a Database
Sorting simply rearranges how Access displays your information. Sorting can 
be especially handy for rearranging your records alphabetically by last name, 
by state, or by country. You can also sort data numerically so that customers 
who buy the most from you appear at the top of your database table, while 
customers who don’t buy as much appear near the bottom.
To sort a database table, follow these steps:
 
1. In the All Tables pane on the left of the screen, double-click the name 
of the database table you want to sort.
 
 Access displays the Datasheet view of your database.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click in a field (column) that you want to use for sorting.
 
4. Click the Ascending or Descending icon in the Sort & Filter group.
 
 Access sorts your records and displays an Ascending or Descending 
icon in the field name so you know you’re looking at a sorted list, as 
shown in Figure 17-7.

344
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
 
Figure 17-7: 
The 
Ascending 
and 
Descending 
icons let you 
sort a data-
base table 
by a specific 
field.
 
 
5. Click the Remove Sorts icon in the Sort & Filter group when you don’t 
want to view your sorted database table any more.
Querying a Database
One problem with sorting or filtering a database table is that you must con-
stantly define what you want to sort or filter. In case you sort or filter your 
data a certain way on a regular basis, you can use a query instead.
A query is nothing more than a saved version of your sort or filter criteria. 
By saving the particular sort or filter criteria as a query, you can select that 
query by name later.
Creating a simple query
If your database table contains dozens of different fields, you may find it con-
fusing to make sense of all your information. As an aid, a simple query strips 
away fields so you see only the fields containing data you want to see, such as 
a person’s name and phone number but not her hire date or employee number.
To create a query, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create tab.
 
2. Click the Query Wizard icon in the Macros & Code group.
 
 The New Query dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-8.

345
 Chapter 17: Searching, Sorting, and Querying a Database
 
Figure 17-8: 
The New 
Query dialog 
box lets 
you choose

lets you pick 
the fields to 
use for your 
query.
 
 
4. Click a field name listed in the Available Fields box and then click 
the > button.
 
 Access displays your chosen field in the Selected Fields box.
 
5. Repeat Step 4 for each field you want to use in your query.
 
6. Click Next.
 
 Another dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 17-10. This dialog box 
asks whether you want to display a Detail (shows every record) or 
Summary (shows numerical information such as the total number of 
records found, the average value, and the minimum/maximum value) 
view of your data.

346

your query.
 
8. Click in the text box, type a descriptive name for your query, and then 
click Finish.
 
 Access displays the results of your query as a separate tab.
 
9. Click the File tab and then choose Save to save your query.
Creating a crosstab query
A crosstab query lets you combine two or more fields to calculate and display 
a calculation based on a third field. For example, if your database contains 
the names of salespeople and the products they sold, you can use those two 
fields to create a crosstab that tells you how much each salesperson sold of 
each product, as shown in Figure 17-11.
To create a crosstab query, you need to identify three types of fields:
 
✓ One to three fields to identify each record (such as the First Name and 
Last Name fields)
 
✓ A single field to display specific data from each record (such as the 
Product field, which displays the actual product names like Purses, 
Unicorn meat, or Missiles)
 
✓ A crosstab field that displays a calculated result (such as Sales)

 Another dialog box appears, asking for a single field to use to cross-
tabulate data with the fields you chose in Steps 5 and 6, as shown in 
Figure 17-14.
 
8. Click a field name and then click Next.
 
 Ideally, this field should consist of text information that lists different 
data, such as sales regions (East, West, North, or South) or products 
(Missiles, Unicorn meat, and so on). If you choose a field that contains 
numerical data, your crosstab query displays only those numbers in the 
column headings, which will appear meaningless. Another dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 17-15.

Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
Creating a query that finds 
duplicate field data
Suppose you sell a hundred different products. How can you tell which prod-
ucts customers are buying the most? To find the answer to this type of ques-
tion, you could search your database manually to find a Products Sold field 
and then count how many times each product appears.
As a simpler solution, you can create a query that finds and counts how 
many times duplicate data appears. To create a query to find duplicate field 
data, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create tab.
 
2. Click the Query Wizard icon in the Other group.
 
 The New Query dialog box appears (refer to Figure 17-8).
 
3. Click Find Duplicates Query Wizard and then click OK.
 
 The Find Duplicates Query Wizard dialog box appears, asking you to 
choose the database table to search.
 
4. Click a database table and then click Next.
 
 Another dialog box appears, asking you to choose the fields to examine 
for duplicate data.
 
5. Click a field name and then click the > button. Repeat this step for 
each additional field you want to search.
 
6. Click Next.
 
 Another dialog box appears, asking whether you want to display any 
additional fields. If you choose to look for duplicate data in a Product 
field (Step 5) to see which products are most popular, you can display 
additional fields such as each salesperson’s name so you can also see 
who is responsible for selling the most products.
 
7. Click a field and click the > button. Repeat this step for each addi-
tional field you want to display.
 
8. Click Next.
 
 A dialog box appears, asking whether you want to give your query a 
descriptive name.
 
9. Type a descriptive name in the top text box and then click Finish.
 
 Access displays your query as a separate tab.
 
10. Click the File tab and then choose Save to save your query.

351
 Chapter 17: Searching, Sorting, and Querying a Database
Creating an unmatched query
Access can store huge amounts of data, but the more data you store, the 
harder it can be to view your data. To help you organize your data, you can 
divide data into separate tables. One table may contain a list of customers, 
and a second table may contain a list of salespeople.
When you store data in separate tables, each table may share one or more 
common fields. For example, a table containing customers may contain a 
SalesPerson field that shows which salesperson deals exclusively with which 
customer. A second table listing salespeople could contain the Customer 
field (along with additional information such as each salesperson’s phone 
number, address, sales region, and so on).
An unmatched query examines two (or more) database tables to look for 
missing information. For example, you could also use an unmatched query to 
find customers who haven’t ordered anything in the past six months, sales 
regions that haven’t ordered certain products, or salespeople who have not 
been assigned to a sales region. Basically, an unmatched query can help you 
find missing pieces or holes in your entire database file.
To create an unmatched query, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create tab.
 
2. Click the Query Wizard icon in the Other group.
 
 The New Query dialog box appears (refer to Figure 17-8).
 
3. Click Find Unmatched Query Wizard and then click OK.
 
 The Find Unmatched Query Wizard dialog box appears, asking you to 
choose a database table that contains the unmatched records you want 
to find.
 
4. Click a database table and then click Next.
 
 Another dialog box appears, asking you to choose a database table that 
contains at least one field that also appears in the table you chose in 
Step 3.
 
5. Click a second database table and then click Next.
 
 Another dialog box appears, asking you to identify the field that both 
database tables have in common.
 
6. Click the common field that both database tables share.
 
7. Click on the gray <=> button that appears between the two fields and 
then click Next.

352
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
 
 A dialog box appears, asking you to identify the fields you want to dis-
play from the database table you chose in Step 4.
 
8. Click a field and then click the > button. Repeat this step for each 
additional field you want to display.
 
9. Click Next.
 
 A dialog box appears, asking you to give your query a descriptive name.
 
10. Type a descriptive name in the text box and then click Finish.
 
 Access displays your query results, which show you only the data in 
fields you selected in Step 8.
 
11. Click the File tab and choose Save to save your query.
Viewing, renaming, closing, 
and deleting queries
Each time you create and save a query, Access stores it for future use. After 
you create and save a query, you can add or delete data from your tables and 
then apply your queries on the newly modified data.
To view a query, just double-click on the query name in the left pane. In case 
you need to rename your query to give it a better descriptive name, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Right-click on the query name in the left pane.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
2. Choose Rename.
 
 Access highlights the query name.
 
3. Type a new name and then press Enter.
Each time you view a query, it displays a tab. Eventually, you’ll probably 
want to get rid of a query, so to close a query, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click on the query name that appears in the tab.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
2. Choose Close.
 
 Access closes your chosen query and removes its tab from view.

353
 Chapter 17: Searching, Sorting, and Querying a Database
Eventually, you may no longer need a query. To delete it, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click a query name; when a pop-up menu appears, choose 
Delete.
 
 A dialog box appears, asking whether you really want to delete your 
query.
 
2. Click Yes (or No).

▶ Creating a report with the Report Wizard
▶ Displaying and printing reports
▶ Modifying the appearance of a report
▶ Erasing a report
D
ata is useless if you can’t understand what it means, so that’s why 
Access lets you create reports. A report simply provides a printed ver-
sion of your data arranged in some useful way.
A report could dig through your data and print a list of your top ten sales-
people. Another report may print out the top ten products you sold last year. 
Reports simply provide a way to make sense of your data and print it so you 
can examine your data on paper.
Using the Report Wizard
The easiest way to create a report is to use the Report Wizard, which guides 
you step by step through arranging and selecting which data to print on a 
report, along with sorting your data at the same time. To use the Report 
Wizard, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create tab.
 
2. Click the Report Wizard icon in the Reports group.

modified since the last time you viewed the report.

359
 Chapter 18: Creating a Database Report
 
Access won’t automatically update your reports just because you modified 
any data that the report displays.
Manipulating the Data in a Report
After you create a report, you can manipulate the data displayed in that 
report, such as sorting data in ascending or descending order, or applying a 
filter that only displays data that meets a certain criteria.
By using a report, you get a different view of your data. By manipulating 
the data in a report, you create alternate views of the same report. Some 
common ways to extract information from a report include counting, sorting, 
and filtering.
Switching a report to Layout view
To manipulate data in a report, you must first display your report in Layout 
view, which you can do by following these steps:
 
1. Double-click on the report name in the left pane of the Access 
window.
 
 Access displays your chosen report.
 
2. Click the Home tab and click the downward-pointing arrow under-
neath the View icon in the Views group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
3. Choose Layout View.
 
 Access displays your report in Layout view, which highlights an entire 
column (field) at a time, as shown in Figure 18-6.
Counting records or values
To make reports more useful, you can have Access count and display 
information, such as which products are selling the best or the total dollar 
amount of each sale so you can tell exactly how much money your company 
made during March. By counting records or adding up values stored in fields, 
Access can help you better interpret the data displayed in a report.

360
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
 
Figure 18-6: 
Layout view 
highlights 
a single 
column of 
your report 
so you can 
manipulate 
the data 
within the 
highlighted 
field.
 
 
You can count values only of fields that contain numbers; you cannot count 
values of a field that contains text, such as names.
To count the number of records or values in a report, follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to the Layout view of your report by following the steps in the 
preceding section, “Switching a report to Layout view.”
 
2. Right-click in the column (field) that you want to count.
 
 Access highlights your chosen column and displays a pop-up menu, as 
shown in Figure 18-7.
 
3. Click Total.
 
 The menu command displays the Total command along with the field 
name you right-clicked, such as Total Last Name or Total Sales.
 
 Access displays a submenu that displays Count Records or Count 
Values.
 
4. Choose either Count Records or Count Values.
 
 Access displays the total count in your report.
 
If you choose the Count Records or Count Values command again, you can 
hide the total count in your report.

Sorting a field
Access can sort each field in ascending or descending order. Sorting a field 
simply rearranges the data in your report for your convenience. To sort a 
column (field) in a report, follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to the Layout view of your report by following the steps in the 
preceding section, “Switching a report to Layout view.”
 
2. Right-click in the column (field) that you want to sort.
 
 Access highlights your chosen column and displays a pop-up menu 
(refer to Figure 18-7).
 
3. Choose one of the following:
 
• Sort A to Z (or Sort Smallest to Largest): Sorts in ascending order
 
• Sort Z to A (or Sort Largest to Smallest): Sorts in descending order
 
 Access sorts your chosen data in your report.

362
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
Filtering a field
Filtering can tell Access to only display data that meets certain criterion, such 
as a fixed amount. For example, if you have a report that lists all the sales of 
products, you could filter your report to show only those products that sold 
over a fixed amount, such as $1,000.
To filter data in a field, follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to the Layout view of your report by following Steps 1 through 
in the previous section, “Manipulating the Data in a Report.”
 
2. Right-click in the column (field) that you want to filter.
 
 Access highlights your chosen column and displays a pop-up menu 
(refer to Figure 18-7).
 
3. Choose Filters.
 
 Depending on the type of data your column contains, the Filter com-
mand may appear as Text Filters or Number Filters.
 
 A submenu appears, as shown in Figure 18-8.
 
Figure 18-8: 
The Filters 
command 
displays a 
submenu 
of different 
criteria you 
can choose.
 

363
 Chapter 18: Creating a Database Report
 
4. Choose a filter criteria, such as Equals or Less Than.
 
 Depending on the criteria you choose, a Custom Filter dialog box 
appears.
 
5. Type your criteria in the Custom Filter dialog box and then click OK.
 
 Access applies your filter to your report.
 
You can always turn off your filter by clicking the Home tab and then clicking 
the Toggle Filter icon in the Sort & Filter group.
Editing a Report
After you create a report, you may want to modify it later to expand the 
space used to display data or eliminate fields altogether.
 
To edit a report, you must switch to the Design view of your report, as shown 
in the sidebar “Switching to Design view.” You can modify your report while 
you view it in Design view.
Resizing fields
When the Report Wizard creates a report, it doesn’t always leave enough 
room to display your actual data. If a field is too small, Access may display 
data as a series of x’s, such as xxxxx. If this occurs, resize a field to make it 
wider. (If your data turns out to be smaller than the field, you may need to 
shrink the field.) To resize a field, follow these steps:
 
1. Display your report in Design view.
 
 Follow the steps in the sidebar “Switching to Design view.”
 
2. Choose the field you want to resize.
 
 Access highlights your chosen field.
 
3. Move the mouse pointer over the left or right edge of the field until 
the mouse pointer turns into a two-way pointing arrow.
 
4. Drag the mouse to resize and expand or shrink the field.
 
 Access displays your report with your modified field size.

364
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
Switching to Design view
To see the Design view of a report, follow these 
steps:
 1. Double-click on the name of the report in 
the left pane of the Access window.
 2. Click the Home tab.
 3. Click the downward-pointing arrow under-
neath the View icon that appears in the 
Views group.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 4. Choose Design View.
 
 Access displays your report in Design view, 
as shown here. 
At this point, you can move, resize, add, or 
delete fields on your report:
 ✓ Text is bold for labels that print identifying 
text, such as First Name or Sales Region. 
 ✓ Text in normal typeface (not in bold) repre-
sents fields that display data in your report.

365
 Chapter 18: Creating a Database Report
Deleting fields
If a report displays data that you no longer want to see, you can delete that 
field from your report by following these steps:
 
1. Display your report in Design view.
 
 Follow the steps in the sidebar “Switching to Design view.”
 
2. Right-click the field you want to delete.
 
 Access highlights your chosen field and displays a pop-up menu.
 
3. Click Delete.
 
 Access deletes your chosen field.
 
 You can press Ctrl+Z right away to retrieve any fields you may have 
deleted accidentally.
Making Reports Look Pretty
Reports can be useful for displaying data, but go one step farther and make 
your reports look visually pleasing as well. One way to change the appear-
ance of a report is to use a predefined theme, which can instantly add color 
to make even the dullest report look interesting.
Applying themes 
A theme simply rearranges the appearance of your entire report so it doesn’t 
look like a boring list of text and numbers. To apply a theme to a report, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Display your report in Design view.
 
 Follow the steps in the sidebar “Switching to Design view.”
 
2. Click the Design tab.
 
3. Click the Themes icon in the Themes group.
 
 A menu appears, listing all the available themes (see Figure 18-9).
 
4. Move the mouse pointer over a theme.
 
 Access shows how your report will look with the selected theme.

366
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
 
Figure 18-9: 
Themes 
give you a 
quick way to 
modify the 
appearance 
of a report.
 
 
5. Select a theme to choose it for your report.
 
 Access displays your report with your selected theme.
Creating conditional formatting
A report can display data, but sometimes you may want help in identifying 
certain types of data. For example, you might want Access to highlight sales 
figures that are greater than $250,000 so you can spot this information easier. 
While you could manually examine a report and highlight such information 
yourself, it’s faster and more accurate to let Access do it instead.
Formatting data based on certain criteria is known as conditional formatting. 
The idea is that Access formats data only when certain conditions are met, 
such as a value greater than $250,000 or less than $10,000.
To use conditional formatting, you need to define the field to format, define 
a rule to trigger the formatting, and then the type of formatting you want to 
apply, such as highlighting the field in red or yellow.
To apply conditional formatting to data in a report, follow these steps:
 
1. Display your report in Design view.
 
 Follow the steps in the sidebar “Switching to Design view.”
 
2. Select the field to which you want apply conditional formatting.
 
 You can apply conditional formatting to a numeric or text field.

367
 Chapter 18: Creating a Database Report
 
3. Click the Format tab.
 
4. Click the Conditional Formatting icon in the Control Formatting group.
 
 A Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box appears, as shown 
in Figure 18-10.
 
Figure 18-10: 
The 
Conditional 
Formatting 
Rules 
Manager 
dialog box.
 
 
5. Click the New Rule button.
 
 A New Formatting Rule dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18-11.
 
 You can click the Edit Rule or Delete Rule button here to edit or delete a 
rule that you’ve created.
 
Figure 18-11: 
The New 
Formatting 
Rule dialog 
box lets you 
define a 
rule.
 
 
6. Select a rule type:
 
• Check values in the current record or use an expression (you can 
create a rule that only considers the value of a single field). 
 
• Compare to other records (you can create a rule that examines the 
value of the same field stored in other records).

368
Part VI: Storing Stuff in Access 
 
7. Define your rule under the Edit the rule description category.
 
 Depending on the option you chose in Step 6, the Edit the rule descrip-
tion category may display different options. 
 
8. Choose the type of formatting to display if the data in a field matches 
your rule that you defined in Step 7.
 
9. Click OK.
 
 The Conditional Formatting Rules Manager dialog box appears again, 
displaying your newly created rule. 
 
10. Click OK.
 
 Access now displays your formatting changes in the field if it matches 
your defined rule. 
Deleting a Report
Eventually, you may find that you no longer need a report, so you might as 
well delete it. To delete a report, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the Report tab.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
2. Choose Close.
 
3. In the left pane, right-click on the report that you want to delete.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
4. Click Delete.
 
 A dialog box asks whether you really want to delete your report.
 
 Make sure that you really want to delete a report. You won’t be able to 
retrieve it afterwards.
 
5. Click Yes (or No).

Chapter 19
Ten Tips for Using Office 2010
M
icrosoft Office is famous for burying tons of useful features that most 
people never know about, so this chapter is about exposing some of 
Office 2010’s features so you can take advantage of them and make Office 
2010 more convenient (and safer) for you to use.
Saving Office 2010 Files
Most people dump their documents inside a folder in the Documents folder. 
However, store too many documents in this folder and you’ll find it’s nearly 
impossible to find anything. To make retrieving files easier, it’s a good idea to 
store different data in its own folders, such as storing tax-related information 
in a special Tax Returns folder or invoices in a special 2010 Invoices folder.
Of course, Office 2010 will cheerfully save all your files in the Documents 
folder, so you’ll need to tell Office 2010 where you want it to save files.
In addition to defining a default folder to store files, you can also define a 
default file format for your Office 2010 programs. This can be especially 
useful if you need to share files with others, such as people still stuck using 
an older version of Microsoft Office (97/2000/XP/2003).
Finally, to protect your data (as much as possible) from inevitable com-
puter crashes and hard drive failures, Office 2010 programs include a special 
AutoRecover feature, which saves a temporary copy of your file at fixed inter-
vals, such as every ten minutes. That way, if the power goes out, you lose only 
those changes you made in the last ten minutes and not all your changes.
 
Access doesn’t offer an AutoRecover feature because it automatically saves 
any changes to your data anyway.
To customize the location, format, and AutoRecover feature of an Office 2010 
program, follow these steps:
 
1. Load the Office 2010 program you want to customize (such as Word or 
PowerPoint).

372
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
2. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
3. Click Options.
 
 An Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-1.
 
Figure 19-1: 
The Options 
dialog box 
lets you 
define 
default 
settings to 
save a file.
 
 
4. Click Save in the left pane.
 
 The Options dialog box displays various Save options.
 
5. (Optional) Click in the Save Files in This Format list box and choose a 
file format, such as the 97–2003 format to save files that are compat-
ible with previous versions of Office.
 
6. (Optional) Click in the Default File Location text box and type the 
drive and folder that you want to define as your default folder. (Or 
click the Browse button and then choose a folder.)
 
7. (Optional) Select the Save AutoRecover Information Every check box, 
click in the Minutes text box, and type a value or click the up/down 
arrows to define a value, such as 7 minutes.
 
8. Click OK.

 Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Using Office 2010
Password-Protecting Your Files
To prevent prying eyes from peeking at your Word, Excel, or PowerPoint 
files, you can password-protect them. That way, if someone wants to open, 
view, or edit your files, she must use your password. If someone doesn’t 
know your password, she won’t be able to view — let alone edit — your files.
 
You can buy programs off the Internet that can crack an Office 2010 password-
protected file. For real security, don’t rely on Office 2010’s password-protection 
feature.
To password-protect a file, follow these steps:
 
1. Load Word, Excel, or PowerPoint.
 
2. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
3. Choose Save As.
 
 The Save As dialog box appears.
 
4. Click the Tools button.
 
 A pull-down menu appears, as shown in Figure 19-2.

5. Choose General Options.
 
 The General Options dialog box appears.
 
6. (Optional) Click in the Password to Open text box and type a password.
 
 Another dialog box appears and asks you to confirm the password by 
typing it again.
 
7. Type the password again and then click OK.
 
8. (Optional) Click in the Password to Modify text box and type a 
password.
 
 This password can be different than the password you typed in Step 6. 
Another dialog box appears and asks you to confirm the password by 
typing it again.
 
9. Type the password again and then click OK.
 
10. Click Save.
 
You can create a password or remove passwords altogether by repeating 
the preceding steps and retyping a new password or deleting the password 
completely.
Guarding Against Macro Viruses
Macro viruses are malicious programs designed to attach themselves to 
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. When an unsuspecting victim opens an 
infected file, the virus can spread and do something nasty, such as deleting 
your files or your entire hard drive.
To stop these pests from wrecking your files, get an antivirus program, avoid 
downloading or accepting any files from unknown people, and turn on Office 
2010’s built-in macro protection feature, which can disable macros or restrict 
what macro viruses and worms can do even if they do infect your computer.
To turn on macro protection, follow these steps:
 
1. Load Word or PowerPoint.
 
2. Click the File tab.
 
 A pull-down menu appears.
 
3. Click Options.
 
 The Options dialog box appears.
 
4. Click Trust Center.
 
 The Trust Center options appear in the right pane.

375
 Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Using Office 2010
 
5. Click the Trust Center Settings button.
 
 The Trust Center dialog box appears with the Macro Settings options 
displayed.
 
6. Select one of the following radio buttons:
 
• Disable All Macros without Notification: The safest but most restric-
tive setting, this prevents any macros (valid or viruses) from run-
ning when you open the file.
 
• Disable All Macros with Notification: This is the default setting and 
displays a dialog box that lets you turn on macros if you trust that 
the file isn’t infected.
 
• Disable All Macros except Digitally Signed Macros: Blocks all 
macros except for the ones “authenticated” (previously defined as 
“trusted”) by the user.
 
• Enable All Macros: This setting runs all macros, which is the most 
dangerous setting.
 
7. Click OK until you return to the Save As dialog box.
 
8. Click Save.
Customize the Ribbon
Some people love the Ribbon interface of Office 2010, while others only toler-
ate it. No matter what your feelings toward the Ribbon interface may be, you 
can customize which icons appear on it so it only displays those features you 
need (and use) most often. 
To customize the Ribbon interface, follow these steps:
 
1. Load an Office 2010 program, such as Word or Access.
 
2. Click the File tab.
 
 The Backstage View appears.
 
3. Click Options.
 
 The Options dialog box appears.
 
4. Click Customize Ribbon in the left pane.
 
 The Options dialog box displays two columns. The left column displays 
all additional commands you can place on the Ribbon, while the right 
column lists all currently displayed tabs and commands, as shown in 
Figure 19-3.

376
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 19-3: 
You can 
custom-
ize which 
tabs and 
commands 
appear on 
the Ribbon.
 
 
5. (Optional) Clear a check box in the right column to hide an entire tab 
from view.
 
 Hiding tabs can be handy when you never use a particular group of com-
mands and you want to simplify the Ribbon interface.
 
6. (Optional) Click the New Tab button to create a new tab. Then you 
can click on a command in the left column and click the Add button to 
place commands on a new tab of your own design.
 
7. (Optional) Click the Restore Defaults button.
 
 The Restore Defaults button lets you restore the default settings of a 
single tab or the entire Ribbon. Use this feature to make your copy of 
Office 2010 look like everyone else’s.
 
8. Click OK.
 
Customizing the Ribbon can make your copy of Office 2010 work exactly the 
way you want. However, if other people need to use your copy of Office 2010 
or if you need to use someone else’s copy of Office 2010, you may find that 
using different Ribbon interfaces can get confusing.

 Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Using Office 2010
Zooming In (And Out) 
to Avoid Eyestrain
For many people, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint may display text too tiny to 
see comfortably. To overcome this problem, you can increase the magnifica-
tion in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint so that text appears bigger without physi-
cally altering the file itself.
Here are three ways to zoom in (or out) the magnification:
 
✓ Drag the Zoom slider that appears in the bottom-right corner.
 
✓ Hold down the Ctrl button and scroll the wheel of your mouse (assum-
ing your mouse has a wheel).
 
✓ Click the View tab and then click the Zoom icon in the Zoom group. 
When a dialog box appears, click a magnification percentage (such as 
125%) or type your own magnification percentage (such as 138%).
 
Changing the magnification only changes the way your text appears. Zooming 
in (or out) doesn’t physically alter the text itself.
When in Doubt, Right-Click the Mouse
As a shortcut to giving commands to Office 2010, remember this simple 
guideline: First select, and then right-click.
So if you want to change text or a picture, first select it to tell Office 2010 
what you want to modify. Then right-click the mouse to display a pop-up 
menu of the commands. These pop-up menus display a list of only relevant 
commands for the item you just selected.
Freezing Row and Column 
Headings in Excel
One problem with creating large spreadsheets in Excel is that your identify-
ing row and column headings may scroll out of sight if you scroll down or to 
the right of your worksheet.

378
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
To prevent this from happening, you can “freeze” a row or column that con-
tains identifying labels. That way, when you scroll through your worksheet, 
your frozen row or column always remains visible.
To freeze a row or column in an Excel worksheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the View tab.
 
2. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the 
Freeze Panes icon in the Window group.
 
3. Click one of the following:
 
• Freeze Panes: Divides a worksheet into multiple panes
 
• Freeze Top Row: Always displays the top row no matter how far 
down you scroll
 
• Freeze First Column: Always displays the first column no matter 
how far to the right you scroll
 
To unfreeze a row or column, repeat Steps 1 through 3 but click Unfreeze 
Panes.
Displaying Slides Out of 
Order in PowerPoint
When you display a PowerPoint presentation, your slides typically appear in 
the order that you arranged them, starting with the first slide. If you want to 
display your slides in a different order in the middle of a presentation, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Load your presentation in PowerPoint and press F5.
 
 The first slide of your presentation appears.
 
2. Type the number of the slide you want to view and press Enter.
 
 If you want to jump to the fifth slide in your presentation, type 5 and 
press Enter. If you jump to the fifth slide, clicking the mouse or pressing 
the spacebar next displays the sixth slide, and then the seventh, and 
so on.
 
Print a list of your slide titles and slide numbers on a sheet of paper so that 
you know which slide number to type to view a particular slide.

Reduce Spam in Outlook
If you have an e-mail account, you will get spam, that unwanted e-mail that 
clogs millions of Inboxes every day with obnoxious offers for mortgage refi-
nancing, low-cost prescription drugs, or celebrity pornography. Unless you 
actually enjoy deleting these messages manually, you can use Outlook to 
filter your e-mail for you.
Setting up Outlook’s junk e-mail filter
Outlook can move suspected spam to a special junk e-mail folder automati-
cally. Because Outlook looks for keywords in spam, be aware that it will 
never be 100 percent effective in identifying spam, but it can identify the 
more blatant spam and save you the time and effort of deleting the messages 
yourself.
To define Outlook’s spam filter, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on your Inbox folder.
 
2. Click the Home tab.
 
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow that appears to the right of the 
Junk icon.
 
 A menu appears, as shown in Figure 19-4.
 
Figure 19-4: 
The Junk 
menu.
 
 
4. Click Junk E-mail Options.
 
 The Junk E-mail Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-5.

lets you 
define how

you want 
Outlook’s 
spam filter 
to work.
 
 
5. Select one of the following radio buttons:
 
• No Automatic Filtering: Turns off the Outlook spam filter.
 
• Low: Identifies and moves most obvious spam to the Junk E-mail 
folder.
 
• High: Identifies and moves nearly all spam into the Junk E-mail 
folder along with some regular e-mail messages, too, so check the 
Junk E-mail folder periodically to look for valid messages.
 
• Safe Lists Only: Identifies and moves e-mail messages into the Junk 
E-mail folder, except for those messages sent from addresses listed 
in your Safe Senders List or Safe Recipients List.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The Options dialog box appears again.
 
7. Click OK.
Creating a Safe Senders list
A Safe Senders list lets you define all the e-mail addresses you want to accept 
messages from, and Outlook routes all e-mail from other e-mail addresses 
directly to your Junk E-mail folder.

381
 Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Using Office 2010
The advantage of a Safe Senders list is that it guarantees you will never 
receive spam. On the downside, though, it also guarantees that if some-
one tries to contact you whose e-mail address doesn’t appear on your Safe 
Senders list, you will never get that valid message, either.
To create a Safe Senders list, follow Steps 1 through 4 in the preceding sec-
tion, “Setting up Outlook’s junk e-mail filter,” to display the Junk E-mail 
Options dialog box. Then follow these steps:
 
1. In the Junk E-mail Options dialog box (refer to Figure 19-5), click the 
Safe Senders tab.
 
 The Safe Sender’s tab of the Junk E-mail Options dialog box appears.
 
2. (Optional) Select (or clear) the Also Trust E-mail from My Contacts 
check box.
 
 Selecting this check box tells Outlook that if you store someone’s e-mail 
address in your Contacts list, you will also accept e-mail from that 
person, too.
 
3. (Optional) Select (or clear) the Automatically Add People I E-mail to 
the Safe Senders List check box.
 
 This tells Outlook that if you send e-mail to someone, you’ll accept his 
or her messages in return.
 
4. (Optional) Click the Add button.
 
 The Add Address or Domain dialog box appears.
 
5. Type a complete e-mail address. (Or type a domain name — for exam-
ple, if you trust everyone from Microsoft.com to send you valid e-mail, 
type @microsoft.com in this dialog box.)
 
6. Click OK.
 
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 for each additional e-mail address or domain 
you want to add.
 
8. Click OK until all the dialog boxes disappear.
 
If you click on the Safe Recipients tab, you can repeat these steps to define 
another list of e-mail addresses that you’ll accept as valid.
Creating a Blocked Senders list
If a particular e-mail address persists in sending you spam, you can choose 
to selectively block that single e-mail address or domain. To create a Blocked 
Senders list, follow Steps 1 through 4 in the earlier section, “Setting up 

382
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Outlook’s junk e-mail filter,” to display the Junk E-mail Options dialog box. 
Then follow these steps:
 
1. In the Junk E-mail Options dialog box (refer to Figure 19-5), click the 
Blocked Senders tab.
 
 The Blocked Senders tab of the Junk E-mail Options dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Add button.
 
 The Add Address or Domain dialog box appears.
 
3. Type an e-mail address or domain name and then click OK.
 
 The Options dialog box appears again.
 
4. Click OK until all the dialog boxes disappear.
Using Office Web
Office 2010 gobbles up a huge chunk of hard drive space and bombards you 
with waves of features that you’ll probably never need (or use) in a million 
years. In case you want to use Microsoft Office but find it too complicated, 
try the free Office Web version instead.
Office Web provides simplified versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 
that you use over the Internet. As long as you have an Internet connection, a 
browser, and a free Windows Live account, you can use Office Web to create, 
edit, and share files with others.
Perhaps the greatest advantage of Office Web is that multiple people can col-
laborate on a single document from anywhere in the world. Instead of swap-
ping files back and forth (and risk losing track which file might be the latest 
one), Office Web lets you store a single copy of your document online for 
everyone to access.
Of course, the biggest drawback of Office Web is that you need an Internet 
connection to use it. However, as Internet access becomes cheaper and more 
accessible, this disadvantage shouldn’t be a problem for most people.
Even better, anyone with a browser can use Office Web, including Windows, 
Mac OS X, and Linux users. Office Web is basically Microsoft’s answer to 
Google Docs, so if the idea of using a word processor, spreadsheet, or presen-
tation program over the Internet appeals to you, then give Office Web a try.

Ten Keystroke Shortcuts
O
ne common theme of Office 2010 is that all programs look and work alike. 
After you learn how to use Word, you’ll find it isn’t much harder to learn 
Excel or PowerPoint because the Ribbon tabs all work in similar ways.
Even better, the same keystroke commands work alike in all Office 2010 pro-
grams. By memorizing the keystroke shortcuts in this chapter, you’ll be able 
to work faster and more efficiently with Office 2010, no matter which particu-
lar program you may be using at the time.
Protecting Yourself with Undo 
(Ctrl+Z) and Redo (Ctrl+Y)
Many people are terrified of making a mistake, so they wind up never 
trying anything new that could save them time and make their lives easier. 
Fortunately, Office 2010 lets you freely experiment with different commands 
because if you do anything, such as delete or modify text or add a picture or 
page, you can immediately reverse what you just did by using the Undo com-
mand (Ctrl+Z) right away.
With the Undo command protecting you, you can try out different commands 
to see what they do. If things don’t work the way you thought, press Ctrl+Z 
and undo your last changes.
If you wind up undoing a change and then suddenly realize you didn’t want to 
undo that change after all, you can redo a command you previously reversed. 
To redo a command that you had undone, choose the Redo command (Ctrl+Y).
To undo multiple commands, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the downward-pointing arrow to the right of the Undo icon on 
the Quick Access toolbar.
 
 A pull-down menu appears of all the latest commands you’ve chosen.

384
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
2. Highlight one or more commands on the Undo menu and click the last 
command you want to undo.
 
3. (Optional) If you undo a command and suddenly want to redo it, 
choose the Redo command by choosing one of the following:
 
• Click the Redo icon on the Quick Access toolbar.
 
• Press Ctrl+Y.
Cut (Ctrl+X), Copy (Ctrl+C), 
and Paste (Ctrl+V)
Editing any file often means moving or copying data from one place to 
another. Understandably, three of the most common commands are the Cut, 
Copy, and Paste commands.
To use the Cut or Copy command, just select an item (text or picture) and 
choose the Cut or Copy icon on the Home tab (or press Ctrl+X to cut or 
Ctrl+C to copy). 
 
Both the Cut and Copy commands are most often used with the Paste com-
mand. However, the Cut command, without the Paste command, is essentially 
equivalent to deleting selected text or objects.
Each time you choose the Cut or Copy command, Office 2010 stores that 
selected data (text or pictures) on the Office Clipboard, which can hold up to 
24 items. After you cut or copy items to the Office Clipboard, you can always 
retrieve them.
 
If you turn off your computer or exit Office 2010, any items on the Office 
Clipboard are lost.
To retrieve a cut or copied item from the Office Clipboard and paste it into a 
document, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Home tab.
 
2. Click the Clipboard icon in the Clipboard group.
 
3. Move the cursor to where you want to paste an item.
 
4. Click an item displayed on the Office Clipboard.
 
 Office 2010 pastes your chosen item in your file.

385
 Chapter 20: Ten Keystroke Shortcuts
Saving a File (Ctrl+S)
Never trust that your computer, operating system, or Office 2010 will work 
when you need it. That’s why you should save your file periodically while 
you’re working: If you don’t, and the power suddenly goes out, you’ll lose 
all the changes you made to your file since the last time you saved it. If the 
last time you saved a file was 20 minutes ago, you’ll lose all the changes you 
made in the past 20 minutes.
It’s a good idea to save your file periodically, such as after you make a lot of 
changes to a file. To save a file, choose one of the following:
 
✓ Press Ctrl+S.
 
✓ Click the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar.
 
The first time you save a file, Office 2010 asks you for a descriptive name. After 
you have saved a file at least once, you can choose the Save command, and 
Office 2010 will save your file without bothering you with a dialog box.
Printing a File (Ctrl+P)
Despite all the promises of a paperless office, more people are printing and 
using paper than ever before. As a result, one of the most common com-
mands you’ll use is the Print command.
To choose the Print command, press Ctrl+P or click the Print icon on the 
Quick Access toolbar.
Checking Your Spelling (F7)
Before you allow anyone to see your file, run a spell-check first. Just press 
F7, and Office 2010 diligently checks the spelling of your text. When the spell 
checker finds a suspicious word, it displays a dialog box that lets you choose 
a correct spelling, ignore the currently highlighted word, or store the high-
lighted word in the Office 2010 dictionary so it won’t flag that word as mis-
spelled again.
 
Spell checkers are handy and useful, but they can be fooled easily. You might 
spell a word correctly (such as their) but use that word incorrectly, such as 
You knead two move over their. Spell-checking won’t always recognize gram-
matical errors, so you still need to proofread your file manually just to make 
sure that you don’t have any misspelled or incorrect words in your file.

386
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
If you don’t want Office 2010 to spell-check your entire file, just highlight the 
text you want to spell-check and then press F7.
Opening a File (Ctrl+O)
Generally, you’ll spend more time working with existing files than creating 
new ones. Rather than force you to click the Office Button each time and find 
the Open command buried on the Backstage View, just press Ctrl+O instead. 
This immediately displays an Open dialog box so you can click the file you 
want to open.
Creating a New File (Ctrl+N)
Normally, if you want to create a new file in Office 2010, you have to click the 
Office Button and click New. Then you have to decide if you want to create a 
blank document or use a template. 
Here’s a quick way to create a blank document: Just press Ctrl+N. Office 
2010 immediately creates a blank file without making you wade through the 
Backstage View.
 
Pressing Ctrl+N in Outlook 2010 creates a different item, such as creating a 
new e-mail message or task, depending on what you’re doing with Outlook at 
the time.
Finding Text (Ctrl+F)
The Find command lets you search for a word or phrase buried somewhere 
within your file. To use the Find command, just press Ctrl+F. This opens a 
dialog box that lets you type the text you want to find.
Finding and Replacing Text (Ctrl+H)
Sometimes you may need to find and replace text with something else, such 
as replacing your cousin’s name with your own name (especially useful for 
changing a will in a rich inheritance). To find and replace text, press Ctrl+H. 
When a dialog box appears, type in the text you want to find and the text you 
want to replace it.

387
 Chapter 20: Ten Keystroke Shortcuts
 
When replacing text, you have a choice of using the Replace or the Replace 
All command. The Replace command lets you review each word before you 
replace it to make sure that’s what you really want to do. The Replace All com-
mand replaces text without giving you a chance to see whether it’s correct. 
When using the Replace All command, be aware that Office 2010 may replace 
words incorrectly. For example, in addition to replacing Bob with Frank, Office 
2010 might also replace all occurrences of Bobcat with Frankcat, which is prob-
ably something you don’t want to do.
Closing a Window (Ctrl+W)
To close a window, you can either click on that window’s Close box or click 
the File tab and then click Close. For a faster alternative, just press Ctrl+W to 
close the current window right away.
 
If you haven’t saved the contents of the current window, Office 2010 displays a 
dialog box asking if you want to save your data before it closes the window.

Almost Ten Ways to Make Office 
2010 Easier to Use
I
f you haven’t noticed by now, there are plenty of features buried in Office 
2010 that you probably don’t need most of the time. However, if you’re a 
die-hard Office 2010 power user, you may want to peek at some of the more 
advanced features buried inside the operating system.
Although these advanced features may take time to learn and master, you 
may find the effort worth it to make Office 2010 behave exactly the way you 
want it to. Best of all, you can learn these new features by playing with them 
at work — so that way, you can learn something new and get paid for doing it 
at the same time.
Learning Visual Basic for 
Applications (VBA)
If you’re like most people, you probably just want to use a program, make it 
do what you need it to do, and then go home afterwards. However, if you find 
yourself wishing Office 2010 could do something more, then you might want 
to take some time to learn Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming.
The VBA programming language is what Office 2010 uses every time you 
create a macro in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Access. While VBA might look 
a bit strange at first, it’s based on the BASIC programming language, which 
was specifically designed to make programming easy for beginners. Unlike 
other programming languages like C++ that resemble chicken scratchings, 
VBA actually looks like normal English commands.
The simplest way to learn how VBA works is to create your own macros and 
then see how Office 2010 created a VBA program to make your macro work. 

390
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
To view the VBA code that makes up a macro in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the View tab.
 
2. Click the Macros icon that appears in the far-right side of the Ribbon.
 
 If a menu appears, click View Macros. The Macros dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the macro name that you want to examine and click the Edit 
button.
 
 The Visual Basic for Applications window appears. In this window, you 
can edit and create VBA code.
 
 To take advantage of VBA programming, you’ll need to learn more about 
the VBA language, such as from a book like VBA For Dummies, by John 
Paul Mueller (Wiley).
 
4. Choose File➪Close and Return.
Collaborating with the Review Tab
If you’re the only person who needs to edit, view, and use your Office 2010 
documents, you can safely skip over this section. However, if you’re like 
many people, you need to collaborate with others.
The old-fashioned way of collaborating meant printing paper copies, sending 
them to others, and writing directly on them, but with Office, you can high-
light, mark up, and edit documents electronically so that you can distribute 
files by e-mail or through a network. Each time someone makes a change to 
a document, Office 2010 tracks these changes with a different color and even 
identifies the contributor by name. Now you can see who wrote what, and 
you can selectively keep those comments that are most valuable and ignore 
the ones you don’t like.
Some of the more useful commands hidden on the Review tab include:
 
✓ New Comment: Lets you insert a comment directly into a document 
without affecting the existing text.
 
✓ Track Changes: Highlights any new text or data that someone adds to an 
existing document.
 
✓ Compare: Examines two files and highlights the differences between 
the two. This tool also gives you the option of selectively merging the 
changes into a single document.
By using the features stored on the Review tab, you can send multiple copies of a 
file to others, let everyone make comments, mark up the text, move data around, 
and then merge everyone’s comments and changes into a single, final version. 

391
 Chapter 21: Almost Ten Ways to Make Office 2010 Easier to Use
Using Word’s References Tab
Most people use Word just to write letters or short reports. If you need to 
create longer documents, then you might be interested in using the features 
buried on Word’s References tab, such as:
 
✓ Insert Footnote: Creates a footnote at the bottom of the page.
 
✓ Insert Endnote: Creates a list of notes at the end of a document.
 
✓ Table of Contents: Creates a table of contents based on the header 
styles used in a document.
 
✓ Insert Caption: Automatically numbers figures, tables, or equations.
 
✓ Insert Table of Figures: Creates a list of figures, tables, or equations that 
you created using the Insert Caption command.
 
✓ Mark Entry: Tags words or phrases to appear in an index.
 
✓ Insert Index: Creates an index based on words or phrases tagged with 
the Mark Entry command.
Using Excel’s Data Tab
Most people type data directly into an Excel worksheet and then manipu-
late that data through formulas or other commands. However, you can also 
design a worksheet and then import data from another location (such as 
stock quotes that you retrieve from a Web site), from a text file, from an 
Access database, or even from a database file created by another program 
(such as an ancient dBASE database). 
Some of the features available on Excel’s Data tab include:
 
✓ From Access: Retrieves data from an Access database.
 
✓ From Web: Retrieves data stored in a table on a Web page.
 
✓ From Text: Retrieves data stored as an ASCII text file.
 
✓ From Other Sources: Retrieves data stored in other sources, such as an 
SQL Server or XML file.
Saving and Sending Files
The traditional way to send a file to someone is to save your file, load your 
e-mail program (such as Outlook), create a new message, attach your file (if 
you can remember where you stored it), and send it over the Internet.

392
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Here’s a faster way to send a file:
 
1. In the file that you want to send, click the File tab.
 
 Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click Save & Send.
 
3. Click Send Using E-mail and click one of the following:
 
• Send as Attachment: Attaches the Office 2010 file. Recipients will be 
able to view and edit this file only if they also have Office 2010.
 
• Send as PDF: Converts the file to PDF format before attaching it to 
the message. Recipients who don’t have special PDF-editing soft-
ware will be able to view the file only, but not edit it.
Password-Protecting a File
After creating a file, you may want to show it to others, but not let anyone 
else modify it. You could trust that nobody will mess up your file, but a better 
option is to password protect it so nobody can modify it without your per-
mission.
To password protect a file, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click Info and then click the Protect button (such as Protect Document 
or Protect Presentation).
 
 A menu appears.
 
3. Click Encrypt with Password. 
 
 An Encrypt Document dialog box appears.
 
4. Type a password and click OK. 
 
If you forget your password, you won’t be able to access your own file, so 
make sure you remember your password.

393
 Chapter 21: Almost Ten Ways to Make Office 2010 Easier to Use
Checking File Compatibility
Not everyone may be using Office 2010, so if you need to share files with 
people stuck with older versions of Microsoft Office, you need to make sure 
your files can be opened by others. Otherwise, you risk creating a great docu-
ment, but nobody else can see what you did.
To check your file’s compatibility with previous versions of Office, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the File tab.
 
 Backstage View appears.
 
2. Click Info and then click the Check for Issues button.
 
 A menu appears.
 
3. Click Check Compatibility. 
 
 A Compatibility Checker dialog box appears, listing any parts of your file 
that may not be compatible with older versions of Office. 
Ignoring the Silly Office Ribbon
Although the Office Ribbon represents a more visual way to use Microsoft 
Office, some people still prefer the classic pull-down menu interface of previ-
ous versions of Microsoft Office. For those who don’t want to give up their 
familiarity with pull-down menus, you can buy an add-on program dubbed 
Classic Menu for Office (which is available at www.addintools.com).
This program essentially gives back your pull-down menus so you can 
choose between the Office Ribbon or the traditional pull-down menus. Now 
you can have the best of both worlds without giving up either one.
The main drawback with this add-on program is that if you have to use 
someone else’s copy of Office 2010 that doesn’t have this add-on installed, 
you may feel lost trying to use the Ribbon alone. For this reason, it’s a good 
idea to become familiar with the Office Ribbon and use this Classic Menu for 
Office add-on program to help you make the transition from an older version 
of Office to Office 2010.
