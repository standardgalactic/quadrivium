About the Authors
Mark Phillips is a guitarist, arranger, and editor with more than 30 years in
the music publishing field. He earned his bachelor’s degree in music theory
from Case Western Reserve University, where he received the Carolyn Neff
Award for scholastic excellence, and his master’s degree in music theory from
Northwestern University, where he was elected to Pi Kappa Lambda, the most
prestigious U.S. honor society for college and university music students. While
working toward a doctorate in music theory at Northwestern, Phillips taught
classes in theory, ear-training, sight-singing, counterpoint, and guitar.
During the 1970s and early ’80s, Phillips was Director of Popular Music at
Warner Bros. Publications, where he edited and arranged the songbooks of
such artists as Neil Young, James Taylor, the Eagles, and Led Zeppelin. Since
the mid-’80s he has served as Director of Music and Director of Publications
at Cherry Lane Music, where he has edited or arranged the songbooks of
such artists as John Denver, Van Halen, Guns N’ Roses, and Metallica, and has
served as Music Editor of the magazines Guitar and Guitar One.
Phillips is the author of several books on musical subjects, including Metallica
Riff by Riff, Sight-Sing Any Melody Instantly, and Sight-Read Any Rhythm Instantly.
In his non-musical life, Phillips is the author/publisher of a series of “fun” high
school English textbooks, including The Wizard of Oz Vocabulary Builder, The
Pinocchio Intermediate Vocabulary Builder, and Tarzan and Jane’s Guide to
Grammar. For the reference value of his numerous publications, Phillips is 
profiled in Who’s Who in America.
Jon Chappell is a multistyle guitarist, transcriber, and arranger. He attended
Carnegie-Mellon University, where he studied with Carlos Barbosa-Lima, and
he then went on to earn his master’s degree in composition from DePaul
University, where he also taught theory and ear training. He was formerly
Editor-in-Chief of Guitar magazine, Technical Editor of Guitar Shop Magazine,
and Musicologist for Guitarra, a classical magazine. He has played and
recorded with Pat Benatar, Judy Collins, Graham Nash, and Gunther Schuller,
and he has contributed numerous musical pieces to film and TV. Some of
these include Northern Exposure, Walker, Texas Ranger, Guiding Light, and
the feature film Bleeding Hearts directed by actor-dancer Gregory Hines. In
1990, he became Associate Music Director of Cherry Lane Music where he has
transcribed, edited, and arranged the music of Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Steve
Morse, Mike Stern, and Eddie Van Halen, among others. He has  more than 
a dozen method books to his name, and is the author of Rock Guitar For
Dummies and the textbook The Recording Guitarist — A Guide for Home and
Studio, published by Hal Leonard.

Introduction
S
o you wanna play guitar, huh? And why wouldn’t you?
Because you may as well face it: In the music world, guitars set the standard
for cool (and we’re not just being biased here). Since the 1950s, many of the
greatest showmen in rock ’n’ roll, blues, and country have played the guitar.
Think of Chuck Berry doing his one-legged hop across the stage (the “duck
walk”) while belting out “Johnny B. Goode,” Jimi Hendrix wailing on his
upside-down, right-handed (and sometimes flaming) Stratocaster, Bonnie
Raitt playing slide guitar, Garth Brooks with his acoustic guitar and flannel
shirts, B.B. King’s authoritative bending and expressive vibrato on his guitar
“Lucille,” or George Benson’s mellow jazz guitar stylings. (Even Elvis Presley,
whose guitar prowess may not have exceeded five chords, still used the
guitar effectively onstage as a prop.) The list goes on.
Playing electric guitar can put you out in front of a band, where you’re free to
roam, sing, and make eye contact with your adoring fans. Playing acoustic
guitar can make you the star of the vacation campfire singalong. And playing
any kind of guitar can bring out the music in your soul and become a valued
lifetime hobby.
About This Book
Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, delivers everything the beginning to inter-
mediate guitarist needs: From buying a guitar to tuning the guitar, to playing
the guitar, to caring for the guitar, this book has it all!
Finding a guitar
Believe it or not, many would-be guitarists never really get into playing because
they have the wrong guitar. Or maybe the strings are too difficult to push
down (causing a great deal of pain). Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, unlike
some other books we could mention, doesn’t assume that you already have
the right guitar — or even any guitar at all, for that matter. In this book, you
find everything you need to know (from a buyer’s guide to buying strategies,
to guitars and accessories for particular styles) to match yourself with the
guitar and equipment that fit your needs and budget.

Playing the guitar
Most guitar books want you to practice the guitar in the same way that you
practice the piano. First, you learn where the notes fall on the staff; then you
learn about the length of time that you’re supposed to hold the notes; then
you move on to practicing scales; and the big payoff is to practice song after
unrecognizable song that you probably don’t care about playing anyway. If
you’re looking for this kind of ho-hum guitar book, you’ve definitely come to
the wrong place. But don’t worry, you can find no shortage of that kind of book.
The truth is that many great guitarists don’t know how to read music, and
many who can read music learned to do so after they learned to play the
guitar. Repeat after us: You don’t need to read music to play the guitar. Chant
this mantra until you believe it, because this principle is central to the design
of Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
One of the coolest things about the guitar is that, even though you can devote
your lifetime to perfecting your skills, you can start faking it rather quickly. We
assume that, instead of concentrating on what the 3/4 time signature means,
you want to play music — real music (or at least recognizable music). We
want you to play music, too, because that’s what keeps you motivated and
practicing.
So how does Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, deliver? Glad you asked. The
following list tells you how this book starts you playing and developing real
guitar skills quickly:
 Look at the photos. Fingerings that you need to know appear in photos
in the book. Just form your hands the way we show you in the photos.
Simple.
 Read guitar tablature. Guitar tablature is a guitar-specific shorthand for
reading music that actually shows you what strings to strike and what
frets to hold down on the guitar for creating the sound that’s called for.
Tab (as it’s known to its friends and admirers) goes a long way toward
enabling you to play music without reading music. Don’t try this stuff on
the piano!
 Listen to the CD. You can listen to all the songs and exercises on the CD
in the back of the book. Doing so is important for a couple of reasons:
You can figure out the rhythm of the song as well as how long to hold
notes by listening instead of reading. We could tell you all sorts of really
cool things about the CD, such as how it has the featured guitar on one
channel and the accompaniment on the other (so that you can switch
back and forth by using the balance control on your stereo) or how the
book and CD are tightly integrated so that you can always find the track
2
Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

you’re looking for easily, but, aw shucks, we don’t want to brag on our-
selves too much.
 Look at the music staff as you improve. To those who would charge
that Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, doesn’t give you diddley in terms
of reading music, we respond: “Not so, Fret Breath!” The music for all the
exercises and songs appears above the shortcut methods. So you get
the best of both worlds: You can associate the music notation with the
sound you’re making after you already know how to make the sound.
Pretty cool, huh?
Caring for your guitar
A serious guitar is a serious investment, and, as with any other serious
investment, you need to maintain it. Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, pro-
vides the information you need to correctly store, maintain, and care for your
six-string, including how to change strings and what little extras to keep
stashed away in your guitar case.
Not-So-Foolish Assumptions
We really don’t make many assumptions about you. We don’t assume that
you already own a guitar. We don’t assume that you have a particular prefer-
ence for acoustic or electric guitars or that you favor a particular style. Gee,
this is a pretty equal-opportunity book!
Okay, we do assume some things. We assume that you want to play a guitar,
not a banjo, Dobro, or mandolin, and we concentrate on the six-string variety.
We assume you’re relatively new to the guitar world. And we assume that you
want to start playing the guitar quickly, without a lot of messing around with
reading notes, clefs, and time signatures. You can find all that music-reading
stuff in the book, but that’s not our main focus. Our main focus is helping you
make cool, sweet music on your six-string.
What You’re Not to Read
We started out with a book full of only cool, exciting, and useful stuff, but our
editor told us that we needed to throw in some boring, technical stuff for bal-
ance (just kidding!).
3
Introduction

Actually, knowing the theory behind the music can sometimes help you take
the next step after mastering the basics of a technique. But those technical
explanations aren’t really necessary for you to play basic music. For this
reason, we use a Technical Stuff icon to mark those explanations that you
may want to skip at first and then come back to later, after you’re getting
more advanced and developing an intuitive feel for the instrument. You also
have our permission to skip over the gray-shaded sidebars you find in some
chapters. Don’t get us wrong; it’s some really fine information. But you won’t
miss a beat if you take a pass on it.
Conventions We Use in This Book
This book has a number of conventions that we use to make things consis-
tent and easy to understand. Here is a list of conventions:
 Right hand and left hand: Instead of saying “strumming hand” and “fret-
ting hand” (which sounds really forced to us), we say “right hand” for
the hand that picks or strums the strings and “left hand” for the hand
that frets the strings. We apologize to those left-handed readers who are
using this book, and we ask that you folks read right hand to mean left
hand and vice versa.
 Dual music notation: The songs and exercises in this book are arranged
with the standard music staff on top (occupying the exalted, loftier posi-
tion that it deserves) and the tablature staff below for the rest of us to use.
The point is that you can use either of these methods, but you don’t need
to look at both at the same time, as you must while playing the piano.
 Up and down, higher and lower (and so on): If we tell you to move a
note or chord up the guitar neck or to play it higher on the neck, we mean
higher in pitch, or toward the body of the guitar. If we say to go down or
lower on the neck, we mean toward the headstock, or lower in pitch. If we
ever mean anything else by these terms, we tell you. (Those of you who
hold your guitar with the headstock tilted upward may need to do a bit of
mental adjustment whenever you see these terms. Just remember that
we’re talking pitch, not position, and you should do just fine.)
How This Book Is Organized
We separate the book into two distinct kinds of chapters: information chap-
ters and playing chapters. Information chapters tell you stuff about the nuts
4
Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

and bolts of the guitar, such as how to tune the guitar, select the right guitar,
and care for the guitar. The playing chapters provide you with the informa-
tion you need to (you guessed it) play the guitar.
Each playing chapter contains exercises that enable you to practice the skill
we discuss in that particular section. And at or near the end of each playing
chapter, you find a section of songs that you can play that use the techniques
in that chapter. At the beginning of each “Playing Songs” section is a section
called “About the Songs,” where you can find a list of skills you need and spe-
cial information about each song.
We divide the chapters in Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, into eight logical
parts for easier access. The parts are organized as follows:
Part I: So You Wanna Play Guitar
Part I provides three information chapters on some guitar basics that you
need to know before you can start playing. Chapter 1 helps you understand
what to call the various parts of the guitar, and what they do. Chapter 2 tells
you how to tune the guitar, both in reference to itself and to a fixed source —
such as a tuning fork, piano, or electronic tuner — so that you can be in tune
with other instruments. Chapter 3 covers the basic skills you need to know to
be successful in this book, such as how to read guitar tablature, how to pick
and strum, and how to produce a clean, clear, buzz-free tone.
Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics
In Part II, you begin to actually play the guitar. All the chapters in this part
deal with playing the guitar, so “strap” yourself in (and get used to bad puns).
Chapter 4, the first playing chapter, shows you the easiest way to start play-
ing real music — with major and minor chords. Chapter 5 goes over how to
play simple melodies by using single notes, and Chapter 6 adds a little bit of
oomph with some basic 7th chords. Remember the old joke about the tourist
who asked the New York beatnik, “How do you get to Carnegie Hall?” Answer:
“Practice, man, practice.” Well, you may not be headed for Carnegie Hall (but
then, who are we to say?), but practicing the basics is still going to be impor-
tant if you want to become a good guitar player.
5
Introduction

Part III: Beyond the Basics: 
Starting to Sound Cool
Part III moves beyond the simple stuff into some intermediate material.
Chapter 7 provides you with the techniques that you use in playing in posi-
tion, which not only makes you sound cool, but makes you look cool, too.
Chapter 8 tells you about playing barre chords, which refers to using one
finger to lay across all the strings and then making chords in front of that
finger. Chapter 9 goes into some special techniques for creating particular
guitar effects, all with pretty cool-sounding names such as hammer-ons,
bends, and slides.
Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles
Part IV, the final set of playing chapters, covers the methods that you use in
particular music styles. Chapter 10, about the rock style, tells you about play-
ing lead by using the pentatonic minor scale, playing solos in a box, and other
rock stylings. (The chapter also gives you some information on country-style
pickin’ with the pentatonic major scale.) Chapter 11, on blues, provides more
lead boxes and special blues articulations and tells you how to get your mojo
working. Chapter 12, on folk music, provides you with the specific picking
patterns that give folk music its distinctive sound (and throws in some coun-
try finger-pickin’ techniques as well). Chapter 13, on classical guitar, introduces
you to techniques necessary to play Bach and Beethoven. Chapter 14, the jazz
chapter, presents jazz chords, rhythm playing, and soloing.
Part V: Purchasing and 
Caring for Your Guitar
Part V contains two chapters designed to help you find the equipment that’s
right for you. Chapter 15 covers finding not only your first practice guitar, but
also finding the second and third guitars (often more difficult decisions than
your first). Chapter 16, on guitar accessories, gives you a primer on guitar
amps, and goes over the little extras you need for a well-rounded assortment
of equipment.
Also included are two chapters on how to care for your guitar. Chapter 17
covers the process of changing strings, something you gotta know if you’re
going to play the guitar for more than a month. Chapter 18 covers the basic
maintenance and repairs that can save you money at the guitar store and
keep you playing well into the night.

Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a For Dummies trademark that provides fun and interest-
ing information in a top-ten-style format. Chapter 19 should inspire you with
ten great guitarists. And, Chapter 20, on ten classic guitars, may lure you to
your local guitar store to acquire one of these babies for yourself.
Part VII: Appendixes
The appendixes in this book cover some important issues. Appendix A suc-
cinctly explains what all those strange symbols on the staff mean and tells
you just enough about reading music to get you by. Appendix B provides a
handy table of 96 of the most commonly used chords. And Appendix C tells
you about the CD that accompanies this book.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins of this book, you find several helpful little icons that can make
your journey a little easier:
Skip to a real song for some instant guitar gratification.
Something to write down on a cocktail napkin and store in your guitar case.
The whys and wherefores behind what you play. The theoretical and, at
times, obscure stuff that you can skip if you so desire.
Expert advice that can hasten your journey to guitar excellence.
Watch out, or you could cause damage to your guitar or someone’s ears.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, has been carefully crafted so that you can
find what you want or need to know about the guitar and no more. Because
each chapter is as self-contained as possible, you can skip information that
you’ve already mastered and not feel lost. Yet, at the same time, you can also
follow along from front to back and practice the guitar in a way that builds
step-by-step on your previous knowledge.
To find the information you need, you can simply look through the Table of
Contents to find the area that you’re interested in, or you can look for partic-
ular information in the Index at the back of the book.
If you’re a beginner and are ready to start playing right away, you can skip
Chapter 1 and go straight to Chapter 2, where you get your guitar in tune.
Then browse through Chapter 3 on developing the skills that you need to
play and dive straight in to Chapter 4. Although you can skip around some-
what in the playing chapters, if you’re a beginner, we urge you to take the
chapters in order, one at a time. Moreover, you should stick to Chapter 4 until
you start to form calluses on your fingers, which really help you to make the
chords sound right without buzzing.
If you don’t yet have a guitar, you should start in Part V, the buyer’s guide,
and look for what you need in a basic practice guitar. You’re better off not
splurging on an expensive guitar until you’re sure that this instrument is for
you. After you buy your ax, you can get on with playing, which is the real fun
after all, right?

A
ll guitars — whether painted purple with airbrushed skulls and lightning
bolts or finished in a natural-wood pattern with a fine French lacquer —
share certain physical characteristics that make them behave like guitars and
not violins or tubas. If you’re confused about the difference between a head-
stock and a pickup or you’re wondering which end of the guitar to hold under
your chin, this chapter is for you.
The following sections describe the differences among the various parts of
the guitar and tell you what those parts do. We also tell you how to hold the
instrument and why the guitar sounds the way it does. And, in case you took
us seriously, you don’t hold the guitar under your chin — unless, of course,
you’re Jimi Hendrix.
Anatomy of a Guitar
Guitars come in two basic flavors: acoustic and electric. From a hardware
standpoint, electric guitars have more components and doohickeys than do
acoustic guitars. Guitar makers generally agree, however, that making an
acoustic guitar is harder than making an electric guitar. That’s why, pound for
pound, acoustic guitars cost just as much or more than their electric counter-
parts. (When you’re ready to go guitar or guitar accessory shopping, you can
check out Chapters 15 and 16, respectively.) But both types follow the same
basic approach to such principles as neck construction and string tension.
That’s why both acoustic and electric guitars have very similar construc-
tions, despite a sometimes radical difference in tone production (unless, of
course, you think that Segovia and Metallica are indistinguishable). Figures
1-1 and 1-2 show the various parts of an acoustic and electric guitar.

The following list tells you the functions of the various parts of a guitar:
 Back (acoustic only): The part of the body that holds the sides in place;
made of two or three pieces of wood.
 Bar (electric only): A metal rod attached to the bridge that varies the
string tension by tilting the bridge back and forth. Also called the
tremolo bar, whammy bar, vibrato bar, and wang bar.
 Body: The box that provides an anchor for the neck and bridge and cre-
ates the playing surface for the right hand. On an acoustic, the body
includes the amplifying sound chamber that produces the guitar’s tone.
On an electric, it consists of the housing for the bridge assembly and
electronics (pickups as well as tone and volume controls).
 Bridge: The metal (electric) or wooden (acoustic) plate that anchors the
strings to the body.
 End pin: A metal post where the rear end of the strap connects. On
acoustic-electrics (acoustic guitars with built-in pickups and electronics),
the pin often doubles as the output jack where you plug in.
 Fingerboard: A flat, planklike piece of wood that sits atop the neck, where
you place your left-hand fingers to produce notes and chords. The finger-
board is also known as the fretboard, because the frets are embedded in it.

 Frets: 1) Thin metal wires or bars running perpendicular to the strings
that shorten the effective vibrating length of a string, enabling it to pro-
duce different pitches. 2) A verb describing worry, as in “He frets about
how many little parts are on his guitar.”
 Headstock: The section that holds the tuning machines (hardware
assembly) and provides a place for the manufacturer to display its logo.
Not to be confused with “Woodstock,” the section of New York that pro-
vided a place for the ’60s generation to display its music.
 Neck: The long, clublike wooden piece that connects the headstock to
the body.
 Nut: A grooved sliver of stiff nylon or other synthetic substance that
stops the strings from vibrating beyond the neck. The strings pass
through the grooves on their way to the tuners in the headstock. The
nut is one of the two points at which the vibrating area of the string
ends. (The other is the bridge.)
 Output jack (electric only): The insertion point for the cord that con-
nects the guitar to an amplifier or other electronic device.
 Pickup selector (electric only): A switch that determines which pickups
are currently active.

 Pickups (electric only): Barlike magnets that create the electrical cur-
rent, which the amplifier converts into musical sound.
 Sides (acoustic only): Separate curved wooden pieces on the body that
join the top to the back.
 Strap pin: Metal post where the front, or top, end of the strap connects.
(Not all acoustics have a strap pin. If the guitar is missing one, tie the
top of the strap around the headstock.)
 Strings: The six metal (for electric and steel-string acoustic guitars) or
nylon (for classical guitars) wires that, drawn taut, produce the notes of
the guitar. Although not strictly part of the actual guitar (you attach and
remove them at will on top of the guitar), strings are an integral part of
the whole system, and a guitar’s entire design and structure revolves
around making the strings ring out with a joyful noise. (See Chapter 17
for more information on changing strings.)
 Top: The face of the guitar. On an acoustic, this piece is also the sound-
ing board, which produces almost all the guitar’s acoustic qualities. On
an electric, the top is merely a cosmetic or decorative cap that overlays
the rest of the body material.
 Tuning machines: Geared mechanisms that raise and lower the tension
of the strings, drawing them to different pitches. The string wraps tightly
around a post that sticks out through the top, or face, of the headstock.
The post passes through to the back of the headstock, where gears con-
nect it to a tuning key. Also known as tuners, tuning pegs, tuning keys,
and tuning gears.
 Volume and tone controls (electric only): Knobs that vary the loudness
of the guitar’s sound and its bass and treble frequencies.
How Guitars Work
After you can recognize the basic parts of the guitar, you may also want to
understand how those parts work together to make sound (in case you
happen to choose the parts of a guitar category in Jeopardy! or get into a heavy
argument with another guitarist about string vibration and string length). We
present this information just so that you know why your guitar sounds the
way it does, instead of like a kazoo or an accordion. The important thing to
remember is that a guitar makes the sound, but you make the music.
14
Part I: So You Wanna Play Guitar 

String vibration and string length
Any instrument must have some part of it moving in a regular, repeated motion
to produce musical sound (a sustained tone, or pitch). In a guitar, this part is
the vibrating string. A string that you bring to a certain tension and then set in
motion (by a plucking action) produces a predictable sound — for example,
the note A. If you tune a string of your guitar to different tensions, you get dif-
ferent tones. The greater the tension of a string, the higher the pitch.
You couldn’t do very much with a guitar, however, if the only way to change
pitches was to frantically adjust the tension on the strings every time you
pluck a string. So guitarists resort to the other way to change a string’s pitch —
by shortening its effective vibrating length. They do so by fretting — pacing
back and forth and mumbling to themselves. Just kidding; guitarists never do
that kind of fretting unless they haven’t held their guitars for a couple of days.
In guitar-speak, fretting refers to pushing the string against the fretboard so
that it vibrates only between the fingered fret (metal wire) and the bridge.
This way, by moving the left hand up and down the neck (toward the bridge
and the nut, respectively), you can change pitches comfortably and easily.
The fact that smaller instruments such as mandolins and violins are higher in
pitch than are cellos and basses (and guitars, for that matter) is no accident.
Their pitch is higher because their strings are shorter. The string tension of all
these instruments may be closely related, making them feel somewhat consis-
tent in response to the hands and fingers, but the drastic difference in string
lengths is what results in the wide differences of pitch among them. This prin-
ciple holds true in animals, too. A Chihuahua has a higher-pitched bark than a
St. Bernard because its strings — er, vocal cords — are much shorter.
Using both hands to make a sound
The guitar normally requires two hands working together to create music. If
you want to play, say, middle C on the piano, all you do is take your index
finger, position it above the appropriate white key under the piano’s logo, and
drop it down: donnnng. A preschooler can sound just like Horowitz if playing
only middle C, because just one finger of one hand, pressing one key, makes
the sound.
The guitar is somewhat different. To play middle C on the guitar, you must
take your left-hand index finger and fret the 2nd string (that is, press it down
15
Chapter 1: Guitar 101

to the fingerboard) at the first fret. This action, however, doesn’t itself pro-
duce a sound. You must then strike or pluck that 2nd string with your right
hand to actually produce the note middle C audibly. Music readers take note:
The guitar sounds an octave lower than its written notes. For example, play-
ing a written, third-space C on the guitar actually produces a middle C.
Frets and half steps
The smallest interval (unit of musical distance in pitch) of the musical scale is
the half step. On the piano, the alternating white and black keys represent
this interval (except for the places where you find two adjacent white keys
with no black key in between). To proceed by half steps on a keyboard instru-
ment, you move your finger up or down to the next available key, white or
black. On the guitar, frets — the horizontal metal wires (or bars) that you see
embedded in the fretboard, running perpendicular to the strings — represent
these half steps. To go up or down by half steps on a guitar means to move
your left hand one fret at a time, higher or lower on the neck.
Pickups
Vibrating strings produce the different tones on a guitar. But you must be
able to hear those tones, or you face one of those if-a-tree-falls-in-a-forest
questions. For an acoustic guitar, that’s no problem, because an acoustic
instrument provides its own amplifier in the form of the hollow sound cham-
ber that boosts its sound . . . well, acoustically.
But an electric guitar makes virtually no acoustic sound at all. (Well, a tiny
bit, like a buzzing mosquito, but nowhere near enough to fill a stadium or
anger your next-door neighbors.) An electric instrument creates its tones
entirely through electronic means. The vibrating string is still the source of
the sound, but a hollow wood chamber isn’t what makes those vibrations
audible. Instead, the vibrations disturb, or modulate, the magnetic field that
the pickups — wire-wrapped magnets positioned underneath the strings —
produce. As the vibrations of the strings modulate the pickup’s magnetic
field, the pickup produces a tiny electric current that exactly reflects that
modulation.
If you remember from eighth-grade science, wrapping wire around a magnet
creates a small current in the wire. If you then take any magnetic substance
and disturb the magnetic field around that wire, you create fluctuations in the
current itself. A taut steel string vibrating at the rate of 440 times per second
creates a current that fluctuates 440 times per second. Pass that current
16
Part I: So You Wanna Play Guitar 

through an amplifier and then a speaker and — voilà — you hear the musical
tone A. More specifically, you hear the A above middle C, which is the stan-
dard absolute tuning reference in modern music — from the New York
Philharmonic to the Rolling Stones to Metallica (although we’ve heard that
Metallica sometimes uses a tuning reference of 666 — just kidding, Metallica
fans!). For more on tuning, see Chapter 2.
Guitars, therefore, make sound either by amplifying string vibrations acousti-
cally (by passing the sound waves through a hollow chamber), or electronically
(by amplifying and outputting a current through a speaker). That’s the physi-
cal process anyway. How a guitar produces different sounds — and the ones
that you want it to make — is up to you and how you control the pitches that
those strings produce. Left-hand fretting is what changes these pitches. Your
right-hand motions not only help produce the sound by setting the string in
motion, but they also determine the rhythm (the beat or pulse), tempo (the
speed of the music), and feel (interpretation, style, spin, magic, mojo, je ne
sais quoi, whatever) of those pitches. Put both hand motions together, and
they spell music — make that guitar music.

Turn On, Tune In
In This Chapter
 Tuning the guitar relatively (to itself)
 Tuning to a fixed source
T
uning is to guitarists what parallel parking is to city drivers: an everyday
and necessary activity that can be vexingly difficult to master. And the
task is never fun. Unlike the piano, which a professional tunes and you never
need to adjust until the next time the professional tuner comes to visit, the
guitar is normally tuned by its owner — and it needs constant adjusting.
One of the great injustices of life is that, before you can even play music on the
guitar, you must endure the painstaking process of getting your instrument in
tune. Fortunately for guitarists, you have only six strings as opposed to the
couple hundred of a piano. Also encouraging is the fact that you can use sev-
eral different methods to get your guitar in tune, as this chapter describes.
Counting on Your Strings and Frets
We’re going to start from square one, or in this case, string one. Before you
can tune your guitar, you need to know how to refer to the two main players —
strings and frets.
 Strings: Strings are numbered consecutively 1 through 6. The 1st string
is the skinniest, located closest to the floor (when you hold the guitar in
playing position). Working your way up, the 6th string is the fattest, clos-
est to the ceiling. 
 We recommend that you memorize the letter names of the open strings
(E, A, D, G, B, E, from 6th to 1st) so that you’re not limited to referring to
them by number. An easy way to memorize the open strings in order is
to remember the phrase “Eddie Ate Dynamite; Good Bye, Eddie.”

 Frets: Fret can refer to either the space where you put your left-hand finger
or to the thin metal bar running across the fingerboard. Whenever you
deal with guitar fingering, fret means the space in between the metal
bars — where you can comfortably fit a left-hand finger.
The first fret is the region between the nut (the thin, grooved strip that
separates the headstock from the neck) and the first metal bar. The fifth
fret, then, is the fifth square up from the nut — technically, the region
between the fourth and fifth metal fret bars. (Most guitars have a marker
on the fifth fret, either a decorative design embedded in the fingerboard
or a dot on the side of the neck, or both.)
You can always check out the diagram on the Cheat Sheet at the front of the
book while you get comfortable with these naming conventions. 
One more point of business to square away. You’ll come across the terms
open strings and fretted strings from this point on in the book.
 Open string: A string that you play without pressing down on it with a
left-hand finger.
 Fretted string: A string that you play while pressing down on it at a par-
ticular fret. 
Everything’s Relative: Tuning 
the Guitar to Itself
Relative tuning is so named because you don’t need any outside reference to
which you tune the instrument. As long as the strings are in tune in a certain
relationship with each other, you can create sonorous and harmonious tones.
Those same tones may turn into sounds resembling those of a catfight if you
try to play along with another instrument, however; but as long as you tune
the strings relative to one another, the guitar is in tune with itself.
To tune a guitar using the relative method, choose one string as the starting
point — say, the 6th string. Leave the pitch of that string as is; then tune all
the other strings relative to that 6th string.
The fifth-fret method
The fifth-fret method derives its name from the fact that you almost always
play a string at the fifth fret and then compare the sound of that note to that
of the next open string. You need to be careful, however, because the fourth
fret (the fifth fret’s jealous understudy) puts in a cameo appearance toward
the end of the process.
20
Part I: So You Wanna Play Guitar 

Here’s how to get your guitar in tune by using the fifth-fret method (check out
the diagram in Figure 2-1 that outlines all five steps):
1. Play the fifth fret of the 6th (low E) string (the fattest one, closest to
the ceiling) and then play the open 5th (A) string (the one next to it).
Let both notes ring together. Their pitches should match exactly. If they
don’t seem quite right, determine whether the 5th string is higher or
lower than the fretted 6th string. If the 5th string seems lower, or flat,
turn its tuning key with your left hand to raise the pitch. If the 5th string
seems sharp, or higher sounding, use its tuning key to lower the pitch.
You may go too far with the tuning key if you’re not careful; if so, you
need to reverse your motions. In fact, if you can’t tell whether the 5th
string is higher or lower, tune it flat intentionally (that is, tune it too low)
and then come back to the desired pitch. 
2. Play the fifth fret of the 5th (A) string and then play the open 4th (D)
string.
Let both of these notes ring together. If the 4th string seems flat or sharp
relative to the fretted 5th string, use the tuning key of the 4th string to
adjust its pitch accordingly. Again, if you’re not sure whether the 4th
string is higher or lower, “overtune” it in one direction — flat, or lower, is
best — and then come back.
3. Play the fifth fret of the 4th (D) string and then play the open 3rd (G)
string.
Let both notes ring together again. If the 3rd string seems flat or sharp
relative to the fretted 4th string, use the tuning key of the 3rd string to
adjust the pitch accordingly.
4. Play the fourth (not the fifth!) fret of the 3rd (G) string and then play
the open 2nd (B) string.
Let both strings ring together. If the 2nd string seems flat or sharp, use
its tuning key to adjust the pitch accordingly.
5. Play the fifth (yes, back to the fifth for this one) fret of the 2nd (B)
string and then play the open 1st (high E) string.
Let both notes ring together. If the 1st string seems flat or sharp, use its
tuning key to adjust the pitch accordingly. If you’re satisfied that both
strings produce the same pitch, you’ve now tuned the upper (that is,
“upper” as in higher-pitched) five strings of the guitar relative to the
fixed (untuned) 6th string. Your guitar’s now in tune with itself.
You may want to go back and repeat the process, because some strings may
have slipped out of tune.
21
Chapter 2: Turn On, Tune In

When you tune in the normal way, you use your left hand to turn the tuning
peg. But after you remove your finger from the string that you’re fretting, it
stops ringing; therefore, you can no longer hear the string you’re trying to tune
to (the fretted string) as you adjust the open string. However, there’s a way to
tune the open string while keeping your left-hand finger on the fretted string.
Simply use your right hand! After you strike the two strings in succession (the
fretted string and the open string), take your right hand and reach over your
left hand (which remains stationary as you fret the string) and turn the tuning
peg of the appropriate string until both strings sound exactly the same.
In Deference to a Reference: 
Tuning to a Fixed Source
Getting the guitar in tune with itself through the relative method is good for
your ear but isn’t very practical if you need to play with other instruments or
voices that are accustomed to standard tuning references (see the section
“Sinking your teeth into the tuning fork,” a little later in this chapter). If you
want to bring your guitar into the world of other people, you need to know
how to tune to a fixed source, such as a piano, pitch pipe, tuning fork, or elec-
tronic tuner. Using such a source ensures that everyone is playing by the
same tuning rules. Besides, your guitar and strings are built for optimal tone
production if you tune to standard pitch.
The following sections describe some typical ways to tune your guitar by
using fixed references. These methods not only enable you to get in tune, but
also to make nice with all the other instruments in the neighborhood.

Taking a turn at the piano
Because it holds its pitch so well (needing only biannual or annual tunings,
depending on the conditions), a piano is a great tool that you can use for
tuning a guitar. Assuming that you have an electronic keyboard or a well-tuned
piano around, all you need to do is match the open strings of the guitar to the
appropriate keys on the piano. Figure 2-2 shows a piano keyboard and the
corresponding open guitar strings.

Tuning your guitar with a pitch pipe
Obviously, if you’re off to the beach with your guitar, you’re not going to want
to put a piano in the back of your car, even if you’re really fussy about tuning.
So you need a smaller and more practical device that supplies standard-
tuning reference pitches. Enter the pitch pipe. The pitch pipe evokes images
of stern, matronly chorus leaders who purse their prunelike lips around a cir-
cular harmonica to deliver an anemic squeak that instantly marshals together
the reluctant voices of the choir. Yet pitch pipes serve their purpose.
For guitarists, special pitch pipes exist consisting of pipes that play only the
notes of the open strings of the guitar (but sounding in a higher range) and
none of the in-between notes. The advantage of a pitch pipe is that you can
hold it firmly in your mouth while blowing, keeping your hands free for
tuning. The disadvantage to a pitch pipe is that you sometimes take a while
getting used to hearing a wind-produced pitch against a struck-string pitch.
But with practice, you can tune with a pitch pipe as easily as you can with a
piano. And a pitch pipe fits much more easily into your shirt pocket than a
piano does! Check out Chapter 16 for a picture of a pitch pipe.
Sinking your teeth into the tuning fork
After you get good enough at discerning pitches, you need only one single-
pitched tuning reference to get your whole guitar in tune. The tuning fork
offers only one pitch, and it usually comes in only one flavor: A (the one
above middle C, which vibrates at 440 cycles per second, commonly known
as A-440). But that note’s really all you need. If you tune your open 5th string
(A) to the tuning fork’s A (although the guitar’s A sounds in a lower range),
you can tune every other string to that string by using the relative tuning
method that we discuss in the section “Everything’s Relative: Tuning the
Guitar to Itself,” earlier in this chapter.
Using a tuning fork requires a little finesse. You must strike the fork against
something firm, such as a tabletop or kneecap, and then hold it close to your
ear or place the stem (or handle) — and not the tines (or fork prongs) —
against something that resonates. This resonator can be the tabletop again or
even the top of the guitar. (You can even hold it between your teeth, which
leaves your hands free! It really works, too!) At the same time, you must
somehow play an A note and tune it to the fork’s tone. The process is kinda
like pulling your house keys out of your pocket while you’re loaded down
with an armful of groceries. The task may not be easy, but if you do it enough,
you eventually become an expert.

Experiencing the electronic tuner
The quickest and most accurate way to get in tune is to employ an electronic
tuner. This handy device seems to possess witchcraftlike powers. Newer elec-
tronic tuners made especially for guitars can usually sense what string you’re
playing, tell you what pitch you’re nearest, and indicate whether you’re flat
(too low) or sharp (too high). About the only thing these devices don’t do is
turn the tuning keys for you (although we hear they’re working on that).
Some older, graph-type tuners feature a switch that selects which string you
want to tune. Figure 2-3 shows a typical electronic tuner.
You can either plug your guitar into the tuner (if you’re using an electric instru-
ment) or you can use the tuner’s built-in microphone to tune an acoustic. In
both types of tuners — the ones where you select the strings and the ones
that automatically sense the string — the display indicates two things: what
note you’re closest to (E, A, D, G, B, E) and whether you’re flat or sharp of
that note.
Electronic tuners are usually powered by 9-volt batteries or two AAs that can
last for a year with regular usage (up to two or even three years with only
occasional usage). Many electronic tuners are inexpensive (as low as $20 or
so) and are well worth the money. (For more on tuners, see Chapter 16.)

Chapter 2: Turn On, Tune In

Using your CD
Lest we forget, you have at your disposal (although you should never toss it
in the trash) one more fixed source as a tuning reference: your Guitar For
Dummies CD.
For your tuning convenience, we play the open strings on Track 1 of the
audio CD that comes with this book. Listen to the tone of each open string as
they sound slowly, one at a time (from the 1st to the 6th, or skinniest to fat-
test) and tune your guitar’s open strings to those on the CD. Use the track
skip button on the CD player’s remote control or front panel to go back to the
beginning of Track 1 to repeat the tuning notes as often as necessary to get
your strings exactly in tune with the strings on the CD.
Unlike a cassette tape — or any analog tape system, for that matter — a CD
always plays back the exact pitch that it records and never goes sharp or flat,
not even a little bit. So you can use your For Dummies CD on any CD player at
any time to get perfectly tuned notes.

uitars are user-friendly instruments. They fit comfortably into the arms
of most humans, and the way your two hands fall on the strings natu-
rally is pretty much the position from which you should play. In this chapter,
we tell you all about good posture techniques and how to hold your hands —
just as if you were a young socialite at a finishing school.
We jest because we care. But you really do need to remember that good pos-
ture and position, at the very least, prevent strain and fatigue and, at best,
help develop good concentration habits and tone. After we get you posi-
tioned correctly with the guitar, we go over some basic music-deciphering
skills and show you how to play a chord.
Hand Position and Posture
You can either sit or stand while playing the guitar, and the position you
choose makes virtually no difference whatsoever to your tone or technique.
Most people prefer to practice while sitting but perform publicly while stand-
ing. The one exception to the sit or stand option is the classical guitar, which
you normally play in a sitting position. The orthodox practice is to play in a
seated position only. This practice doesn’t mean that you can’t play a classical-
style guitar or classical music while standing, but the serious pursuit of the
classical guitar requires that you sit while playing.

Settling in to a sitting position
To hold the guitar in a sitting position, rest the waist of the guitar on your
right leg. (The waist is the indented part between the guitar’s upper and
lower bouts, which are the protruding curved parts that look like shoulders
and hips.) Place your feet slightly apart. Balance the guitar by lightly resting
your right forearm on the bass bout, as shown in Figure 3-1. Don’t use the left
hand to support the neck. You should be able to take your left hand com-
pletely off the fretboard without the guitar dipping toward the floor.
Classical guitar technique, on the other hand, requires you to hold the instru-
ment on your left leg, not on your right. This position puts the center of the
guitar closer to the center of your body, making the instrument easier to play,
especially with the left hand, because you can better execute the difficult fin-
gerings of the classical-guitar music in that position. Chapter 13 shows the
classical-guitar sitting position.
You must also elevate the classical guitar, which you can do either by raising
the left leg with a specially made guitar foot stool (the traditional way) or by
using a support arm, which goes between your left thigh and the guitar’s
lower side (the modern way). This device enables your left foot to remain on
the floor and instead pushes the guitar up in the air.
Figure 3-1:

Part I: So You Wanna Play Guitar 

Standing position
To stand and play the guitar, you need a strap that is securely fastened to
both strap pins on the guitar (or otherwise tied to the guitar). Then you can
stand in a normal way and check out how cool you look in the mirror with
that guitar slung over your shoulders. You may need to adjust the strap to
get the guitar at a comfortable playing height. 
If your strap slips off a pin while you’re playing in a standing position, you
have about a fifty-fifty chance of catching your guitar before it hits the floor
(and that’s if you’re quick and experienced with slipping guitars). So don’t
risk damaging your guitar by using an old or worn strap or one with holes
that are too large for the pins to hold securely. Guitars aren’t built to bounce,
as Pete Townshend has demonstrated so many times.
Your body makes a natural adjustment in going from a sitting to a standing
position. So don’t try to overanalyze where your arms fall, relative to your 
sitting position. Just stay relaxed and, above all, look cool. (You’re a guitar
player now! Looking cool is just as important as knowing how to play . . . 
well, almost.) Figure 3-2 shows a typical standing position.

Left-hand position: Fretting made easy
To get an idea of correct left-hand positioning on the guitar, extend your left
hand, palm up, and make a loose fist, placing your thumb roughly between
your first and second fingers. All your knuckles should be bent. Your hand
should look about like that after you stick a guitar neck in there. The thumb
glides along the back of the neck, straighter than if you were making a fist but
not rigid. The finger knuckles stay bent whether they’re fretting or relaxed.
Again, the left hand should fall in place very naturally on the guitar neck — as if
you were picking up a specially made tool that you’ve been using all your life.
To fret a note, press the tip of your finger down on a string, keeping your
knuckles bent. Try to get the fingertip to come down vertically on the string
rather than at an angle. This position exerts the greatest pressure on the string
and also prevents the sides of the finger from touching adjacent strings —
which may cause either buzzing or muting (deadening the string, or prevent-
ing it from ringing). Use your thumb from its position underneath the neck to
help “squeeze” the fingerboard for a tighter grip.
When playing a particular fret, remember that you don’t place your finger
directly on the metal fret wire, but in between the two frets (or between the
nut and first fret wire). For example, if you’re playing the fifth fret, place your
finger in the square between the fourth and fifth fret wires. Don’t place it in
the center of the square (midway between the fret wires), but closer to the
higher fret wire. This technique will give you the clearest sound and prevent
buzzing.
Left-hand fretting requires strength, but don’t be tempted to try speeding up
the process of strengthening your hands through artificial means. Building up
the strength in your left hand takes time. You may see advertisements for
hand-strengthening devices and believe that these products may expedite
your left-hand endurance. Although we can’t declare that these devices never
work (and the same goes for the home-grown method of squeezing a racquet
ball or tennis ball), one thing’s for sure: Nothing helps you build your left-
hand fretting strength better or faster than simply playing guitar.
Because of the strength your left hand exerts while fretting, other parts of
your body may tense up to compensate. At periodic intervals, make sure that
you relax your left shoulder, which has a tendency to rise up as you work 
on your fretting. Take frequent “drop-shoulder” breaks. Make sure as well
that your left elbow doesn’t stick out to the side, like that of some rude
dinner guest. You want to keep your upper arm and forearm parallel to the
side of your body. Relax your elbow so that it stays at your side.
30
Part I: So You Wanna Play Guitar 

The important thing to remember in maintaining a good left-hand position is
that you need to keep it comfortable and natural. If your hand starts to hurt
or ache, stop playing and take a rest. As with any other activity that requires
muscular development, resting enables your body to catch up.
Electric endeavours
Electric necks are both narrower (from the 1st string to the 6th) and shal-
lower (from the fingerboard to the back of the neck) than acoustics. Electric
guitars are, therefore, easier to fret. But the space between each string is
smaller, so you’re more likely to touch and deaden an adjacent string with
your fretting finger. The biggest difference, however, between fretting on an
electric and on a nylon or steel-string acoustic is the action.
A guitar’s action refers to how high above the frets the strings ride and, to a
lesser extent, how easy the strings are to fret. On an electric guitar, fretting
strings is like passing a hot knife through butter. The easier action of an elec-
tric enables you to use a more relaxed left-hand position than you normally
would on an acoustic, with the palm of the left hand facing slightly outward.
Figure 3-3 shows a photo of the left hand resting on the fingerboard of an
electric guitar, fretting a string.
Classical conditions
Because nylon-string guitars have a wide fingerboard and are the model of
choice for classical music, their necks require a slightly more (ahem) formal
left-hand approach. Try to get the palm-side of your knuckles (the ones that
connect your fingers to your hand) to stay close to and parallel to the side of
the neck so that the fingers run perpendicular to the strings and all the fingers

are the same distance away from the neck. (If your hand isn’t perfectly paral-
lel, the little finger “falls away” or is farther from the neck than your index
finger.) Figure 3-4 shows the correct left-hand position for nylon-string guitars.
Right-hand position
If you hold a guitar in your lap and drape your right arm over the upper bout,
your right hand, held loosely outstretched, crosses the strings at about a 
60-degree angle. This position is good for playing with a pick. For fingerstyle
playing, you want to turn your right hand more perpendicular to the strings.
For classical guitar, you want to keep the right hand as close to a 90-degree
angle as possible.
If you’re using a pick
You do almost all your electric guitar playing with a pick, whether you’re belt-
ing out rock ’n’ roll, blues, jazz, country, or pop. On acoustic, you can play
either with a pick or with your fingers. On both electric and acoustic, you
play most rhythm (chord-based accompaniment) and virtually all lead (single-
note melodies) by holding the pick, or plectrum (the old-fashioned term),
between the thumb and index finger. Figure 3-5 shows the correct way to 
hold a pick — with just the tip sticking out, perpendicular to the thumb.
Figure 3-4:

left-hand

32
Part I: So You Wanna Play Guitar 

If you’re strumming (playing rhythm), you strike the strings with the pick by
using wrist and elbow motion. The more vigorous the strum, the more elbow
you must put into the mix. For playing lead, you use only the more economi-
cal wrist motion. Don’t grip the pick too tightly as you play — and plan on
dropping it a lot for the first few weeks that you use it.
Picks come in various gauges. A pick’s gauge indicates how stiff, or thick, it is.
Thinner picks are easier to manage for the beginner. Medium picks are the
most popular, because they’re flexible enough for comfortable rhythm play-
ing, yet stiff enough for leads. Heavy-gauge picks may seem unwieldy at first,
but they’re the choice for pros, and eventually all skilled instrumentalists
graduate to them (although a few famous holdouts exist — Neil Young being
a prime example).
If you’re using your fingers
If you eschew such paraphernalia as picks and want to go au naturel with
your right hand, you’re fingerpicking (although you can fingerpick with spe-
cial individual, wraparound picks that attach to your fingers — called, confus-
ingly enough, fingerpicks). Fingerpicking means that you play the guitar by
plucking the strings with the individual right-hand fingers. The thumb plays
the bass, or low, strings, and the fingers play the treble, or high, strings. In fin-
gerpicking, you use the tips of the fingers to play the strings, positioning the
hand over the sound hole (if you’re playing acoustic) and keeping the wrist
stationary but not rigid. Maintaining a slight arch in the wrist so that the fingers
come down more vertically on the strings also helps. Chapter 12 contains
more information on fingerpicking style, including figures showing proper
hand position.

33
Chapter 3: Ready, Set . . . Not Yet: Developing the Tools and Skills to Play

Because of the special right-hand strokes that you use in playing classical
guitar (the free stroke and the rest stroke), you must hold your fingers almost
perfectly perpendicular to the strings to execute the correct technique. A
perpendicular approach enables your fingers to draw against the strings with
maximum strength. See Chapter 13 for more information on the rest stroke
and free stroke.
You Don’t Have to Read Music to
Understand Guitar Notation
Although you don’t need to read music to play the guitar, musicians have
developed a few simple tricks through the years that aid in communicating
such basic ideas as song structure, chord construction, chord progressions,
and important rhythmic figures. Pick up on the shorthand devices for chord
diagrams, rhythm slashes, and tablature (which we describe in the following
sections), and you’re sure to start coppin’ licks faster than Roy Clark pickin’
after three cups of coffee.
We promise that you don’t need to read music to play the guitar. With the
help of the chord diagrams, rhythm slashes, and tablature that we explain in
this section, plus hearing what all this stuff sounds like through the magic of CD
technology, you can pick up on everything that you need to understand and
play the guitar. Beginning in Chapter 4, listen closely to the CD and follow the
corresponding written examples to make sure that you understand how the
two relate.
Getting by with a little help 
from a chord diagram
Don’t worry — reading a chord diagram is not like reading music; it’s far sim-
pler. All you need to do is understand where to put your fingers to form a
chord. A chord is defined as the simultaneous sounding of three or more notes.
Figure 3-6 shows the anatomy of a chord chart, and the following list briefly
explains what the different parts of the diagram mean:
 The grid of six vertical lines and five horizontal ones represents the guitar
fretboard, as if you stood the guitar up on the floor or chair and looked
straight at the upper part of the neck from the front.
 The vertical lines represent the guitar strings. The vertical line at the far
left is the low 6th string, and the right-most vertical line is the high 1st
string.
34
Part I: So You Wanna Play Guitar 

 The horizontal lines represent frets. The thick horizontal line at the top
is the nut of the guitar, where the fretboard ends. So the first fret is actu-
ally the second vertical line from the top. (Don’t let the words here con-
fuse you; just look at the guitar.)
 The dots that appear on vertical string lines between horizontal fret lines
represent notes that you fret.
 The numerals directly below each string line (just below the last fret line)
indicate which left-hand finger you use to fret that note. On the left hand,
1 = index finger; 2 = middle finger; 3 = ring finger; and 4 = little finger. You
don’t use the thumb to fret, except in certain unusual circumstances.
 The X or O symbols directly above some string lines indicate strings that
you leave open (unfretted) or that you don’t play. An X (not shown in
Figure 3-6) above a string means that you don’t pick or strike that string
with your right hand. An O indicates an open string that you do play.
If a chord starts on a fret other than the first fret (which you can see in
Chapters 10 and 11), a numeral appears to the right of the diagram, next to
the top fret line, to indicate in which fret you actually start. (In such cases,
the top line is not the nut.) In most cases, however, you deal primarily with
chords that fall within only the first four frets of the guitar. Chords that fall
within the first four frets typically use open strings, so they’re referred to as
open chords.

Reading rhythm slashes
Musicians use a variety of shorthand tricks to indicate certain musical direc-
tions. They use this shorthand because, although a particular musical con-
cept itself is often simple enough, to notate that idea in standard written
music form may prove unduly complicated and cumbersome. So they use a
“cheat sheet” or a “road map” that gets the point across yet avoids the issue
of reading (or writing) music.
Rhythm slashes are slash marks (/) that simply tell you how to play rhythmi-
cally but not what to play. The chord in your left hand determines what you
play. Say, for example, that you see the diagram shown in Figure 3-7.
If you see such a chord symbol with four slashes beneath it, as shown in the
figure, you know to finger an E chord and strike it four times. What you don’t
see, however, is a number of differently pitched notes clinging to various
lines of a music staff, including several hole-in-the-center half notes and a
slew of solid quarter notes — in short, any of that junk that you needed to
memorize in grade school just to play “Mary Had a Little Lamb” on the
recorder. All you need to remember on seeing this particular diagram is to
“play an E chord four times.” Simple, isn’t it?
Taking a look at tablature
Tablature (or just tab, for short) is a notation system that graphically repre-
sents the frets and strings of the guitar. Whereas chord diagrams do so in a
static way, tablature shows how you play music over a period of time. For all
the musical examples that appear in this book, you see a tablature staff (or
tab staff, for short) beneath the standard notation staff. This second staff
reflects exactly what’s going on in the regular musical staff above it — but in
guitar language. Tab is guitar-specific — in fact, many call it simply guitar tab.
Tab doesn’t tell you what note to play (such as C or F# or E%). It does, how-
ever, tell you what string to fret and where exactly on the fingerboard to fret
that string.

Part I: So You Wanna Play Guitar 

Figure 3-8 shows you the tab staff and some sample notes and a chord. The
top line of the tab staff represents the 1st string of the guitar — high E. The
bottom line of the tab corresponds to the 6th string on the guitar, low E. The
other lines represent the other four stings in between — the second line from
the bottom is the 5th string, and so on. A number appearing on any given line
tells you to fret that string in that numbered fret. For example, if you see the
numeral 2 on the second line from the top, you need to press down the 2nd
string in the second fret above the nut (actually, the space between the first
and second metal frets). A 0 on a line means that you play the open string.
How to Play a Chord
Chords are the basic building blocks of songs. You can play a chord (the
simultaneous sounding of three or more notes) several ways on the guitar —
by strumming (dragging a pick or the back of your fingernails across the
strings in a single, quick motion), plucking (with the individual right-hand fin-
gers), or even smacking the strings with your open hand or fist. (Okay, that’s
rare, unless you’re in a heavy metal band.) But you can’t just strike any group
of notes; you must play a group of notes organized in some musically mean-
ingful arrangement. For the guitarist, that means learning some left-hand
chord forms.
Fingering a chord
After you think that you understand (somewhat) the guitar notation that we
describe in the preceding sections, your best bet is to just jump right in and
play your first chord. We suggest that you start with E major, because it’s a
particularly guitar-friendly chord and one that you use a lot.
After you get the hang of playing chords, you eventually find that you can
move several fingers into position simultaneously. For now, however, just
place your fingers one at a time on the frets and strings, as the following
instructions indicate (you can also refer to Figure 3-6):

Chapter 3: Ready, Set . . . Not Yet: Developing the Tools and Skills to Play

1. Place your first (index) finger on the 3rd string, first fret (actually
between the nut and first fret wire but closer to the fret wire).
Don’t press down hard until you have your other fingers in place. Apply
just enough pressure to keep your finger from moving off the string.
2. Place your second (middle) finger on the 5th string (skipping over the
4th string), second fret.
Again, apply just enough pressure to keep your fingers in place. You now
have two fingers on the guitar, on the 3rd and 5th strings, with an as-yet
unfretted string (the 4th) in between.
3. Place your third (ring) finger on the 4th string, second fret.
You may need to wriggle your ring finger a bit to get it to fit in there
between the first and second fingers and below the fret wire. Figure 3-9
shows a photo of how your E chord should look after all your fingers are
positioned correctly.
Now that your fingers are in position, strike all six strings with your right
hand to hear your first chord, E.
Avoiding buzzes
One of the hardest things to do in playing chords is to avoid buzzing. Buzzing
results if you’re not pressing down quite hard enough when you fret. A buzz
can also result if a fretting finger accidentally comes in contact with an adja-
cent string, preventing that string from ringing freely. Without removing your
fingers from the frets, try “rocking and rolling” your fingers around on their
tips to eliminate any buzzes when you strum the chord.

A
ccompanying yourself as you sing your favorite songs — or as someone
else sings them if your voice is less than melodious — is one of the best
ways to pick up basic guitar chords. If you know how to play basic chords,
you can play lots of popular songs right away — from “Skip to My Lou” to
“Louie Louie.”
In this chapter, we organize the major and minor chords into families. A
family of chords is simply a group of related chords. We say they’re related
because you often use these chords together to play songs. The concept is
sort of like color-coordinating your clothing or assembling a group of foods
to create a balanced meal. Chords in a family go together like peanut butter
and chocolate (except that chords in a family are less messy). Along the way,
we help you expand your guitar-notation vocabulary as you start to develop
your chord-playing and strumming skills. 
Think of a family of chords as a plant. If one of the chords — the one that
feels like home base in a song (usually the chord you start and end a song
with) — is the plant’s root, the other chords in the family are the different
shoots rising up from that same root. Together, the root and shoots make up
the family. Put ’em all together and you have a lush garden . . . er, make that a
song. By the way, the technical term for a family is key. So you can say some-
thing like “This song uses A-family chords” or “This song is in the key of A.”

Playing Chords in the A Family
The A family is a popular family for playing songs on the guitar because, like
other families we present in this chapter, its chords are easy to play. That’s
because A-family chords contain open strings (strings that you play without
pressing down any notes). Chords that contain open strings are called open
chords, or open-position chords. Listen to “Fire and Rain,” by James Taylor, to
hear the sound of a song that uses A-family chords.
The basic chords in the A family are A, D, and E. Each of these chords is
what’s known as a major chord. A chord that’s named by a letter name alone,
such as these (A, D, and E), is always major. (See the “Chord qualities” side-
bar in this chapter for an explanation of different types of chords.)
Fingering A-family chords
Remember that when fingering chords, you use the “ball” of your fingertip,
placing it just behind the fret (on the side toward the tuning pegs). Arch your
fingers so that the fingertips fall perpendicular to the neck. And make sure
that your left-hand fingernails are short so that they don’t prevent you from
42
Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 
Playing callusly
Playing chords can be a little painful at first. (We
mean for you, not for people within earshot;
c’mon, we’re not that cruel.) No matter how
tough you are, if you’ve never played the guitar
before, your left-hand fingertips are soft.
Fretting a guitar string, therefore, is going to feel
to your fingertips almost as if you’re hammering
a railroad spike with your bare hand. (Ouch!)
In short, pressing down the string hurts. This sit-
uation isn’t weird at all — in fact, it’s quite
normal for beginning guitarists. (Well, it’s weird
if you enjoy the pain.) You must develop nice,
thick calluses on your fingertips before playing
the guitar can ever feel completely comfortable.
You may take weeks or even months to build up
those protective layers of dead skin, depending
on how much and how often you play. But after
you finally earn your calluses, you never lose
them (completely, anyway). Like a Supreme
Court justice, you’re a guitar player for life.
You can develop your calluses by playing the
basic chords in this chapter over and over
again. As you progress, you also gain strength
in your hands and fingers and become more
comfortable in general while playing the guitar.
Before you know it’s happening, fretting a guitar
becomes as natural to you as shaking hands
with your best friend.
As with any physical-conditioning routine, make
sure that you stop and rest if you begin to feel
tenderness or soreness in your fingers or
hands. Building up those calluses takes time,
and you can’t hurry time (or love, for that matter,
as Diana Ross would attest).

pressing the strings all the way down to the fingerboard. Figure 4-1 shows the
fingering for the A, D, and E chords — the basic chords in the A family. (If
you’re unclear about reading the chord diagrams, check out the information
in Chapter 3 on chord diagrams.) 
Don’t play any strings marked with an X (the 6th string on the A chord and
the 5th and 6th strings on the D chord). Strike just the top five (5th through
1st) strings in the A chord and the top four (4th through 1st) strings in the D
chord. Selectively striking strings may be awkward at first, but keep at it and
you’ll get the hang of it. If you play a string marked with an X and we catch
you, we’ll revoke your picking privileges on the spot.
Strumming A-family chords
Use your right hand to strum these A-family chords with one of the following:
 A pick
 Your thumb
 The back of your fingernails (in a brushing motion toward the floor)
Start strumming from the lowest-pitched string of the chord (the side of the
chord toward the ceiling as you hold the guitar) and strum toward the floor.

Chapter 4: The Easiest Way to Play: Basic Major and Minor Chords

A progression is simply a series of chords that you play one after the other.
Figure 4-2 presents a simple progression in the key of A and instructs you to
strum each chord — in the order shown (reading from left to right) — four
times. Use all downstrokes (dragging your pick across the strings toward the
floor) as you play.
Listen to the example on the CD to hear the rhythm of this progression and
try to play along with it.
After strumming each chord four times, you come to a vertical line in the
music that follows the four strum symbols. This line is a bar line. It’s not
something that you play. Bar lines visually separate the music into smaller

Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 
Chord qualities
Chords have different qualities, which has noth-
ing to do with whether they’re good or bad little
chords. You can define quality as the relationship
between the different notes that make up the
chord — or simply, what the chord sounds like.
Besides the quality of being major, other chord
qualities include minor, 7th, minor 7th, and
major 7th. The following list describes each of
these types of chord qualities:
 Major chords: These are simple chords that
have a stable sound.
 Minor chords: These are simple chords that
have a soft, sometimes sad sound.
 7th chords:These are bluesy, funky-sounding
chords.
 Minor 7th chords: These chords sound
mellow and jazzy.
 Major 7th chords: These chords sound
bright and jazzy.
Each type of chord, or chord quality, has a dif-
ferent kind of sound, and you can often distin-
guish the chord type just by hearing it. Listen, for
example, to the sound of a major chord by
strumming A, D, and E. (For more information on
7th, minor 7th, and major 7th chords, check out
Chapter 6.)

sections known as measures, or bars. (You can use these terms interchange-
ably; they both mean the same thing.) Measures make written music easier to
grasp, because they break up the music into little, digestible chunks. See
Appendix A for more information on bar lines and measures.
Don’t hesitate or stop at the bar line. Keep your strumming speed the same
throughout, even as you play “between the measures” — that is, in the imagi-
nary “space” from the end of one measure to the beginning of the next that
the bar line represents. Start out playing as slowly as necessary to help you
keep the beat steady. You can always speed up as you become more confi-
dent and proficient in your chord fingering and switching.
By playing a progression over and over, you start to develop left-hand strength
and calluses on your fingertips. Try it (and try it . . . and try it. . . .).
If you want to play a song right away, you can. Skip to the section “Playing
Songs with Basic Major and Minor Chords,” at the end of this chapter.
Because you now know the basic open chords in the A family, you can play
“Kumbaya.” Rock on!
Playing Chords in the D Family
The basic chords that make up the D family are D, Em (pronounced “E minor”),
G, and A. The D family, therefore, shares two basic open chords with the A
family (D and A) and introduces two new ones: Em and G. Because you

Practicing and getting good
It may sound obvious to say that the more you
practice the better you’ll get, but it’s true.
However, perhaps even more important is this
concept: The more you practice, the faster
you’ll get good. Although there’s no set amount
of practice time for “getting good,” a good rule
of thumb is to practice a minimum of 30 minutes
every day. Also, it’s generally agreed that prac-
ticing at regular intervals is better than jamming
a week’s worth of time (say, 31⁄2 hours) all into
one practice session.
If at first you find a new technique difficult to
master, stick with it, and you’ll eventually get the
hang of it. To get even better on the guitar, we
suggest the following:
 Set aside a certain time every day for 
practicing.
 Get together with your guitar-playing friends,
and get them to listen to what you’re doing.
 Create a practice environment where you
have privacy, away from distractions (TV,
conversations, your mother bugging you to
come to dinner, and so on).
 Watch videos of guitar players who play the
kind of music you like and that you’d like to
learn.

already know how to play D and A from the preceding section (“Playing
Chords in the A Family”), you need to work on only two more chords to add
the entire D family to your repertoire: Em and G. Listen to “Here Comes the
Sun,” by the Beatles, to hear the sound of a song that uses D-family chords.
Minor describes the quality of a type of chord. A minor chord has a sound
that’s distinctly different from that of a major chord. You may characterize the
sound of a minor chord as sad, mournful, scary, or even ominous. Remember
that the relationship of the notes that make up the chord determines a chord’s
quality. A chord that’s named by a capital letter followed by a small “m” is
always minor.
Fingering D-family chords
Figure 4-3 shows you how to finger the two basic chords in the D family that
aren’t in the A family. You may notice that none of the strings in either chord
diagram displays an X symbol, so you get to strike all the strings whenever
you play a G or Em chord. If you feel like it, go ahead and celebrate by drag-
ging your pick or right-hand fingers across the strings in a big keraaaang.
Try the following trick to quickly pick up how to play Em and to hear the dif-
ference between the major and minor chord qualities: Play E, which is a
major chord, and then lift your index finger off the 3rd string. Now you’re
playing Em, which is the minor-chord version of E. By alternating the two
chords, you can easily hear the difference in quality between a major and
minor chord.
Also, notice the alternative fingering for G (2-3-4 instead of 1-2-3). As your
hand gains strength and becomes more flexible, you want to switch to the

2-3-4 fingering instead of the initially easier 1-2-3 fingering (the version shown
in Figure 4-3). You can switch to other chords with greater ease and efficiency
by using the 2-3-4 fingering for G.
Strumming D-family chords
In Figure 4-4, you play a simple chord progression using D-family chords.
Notice the difference in the strum in this figure versus that of Figure 4-2. In
Figure 4-2, you strum each chord four times per measure. Each strum is one
pulse, or beat. Figure 4-4 divides the second strum of each measure (or the
second beat) into two strums — up and down — both of which together take
up the time of one beat, meaning that you must play each strum in beat 2
twice as quickly as you do a regular strum.
The additional symbol 2 with the strum symbol means that you strum down
toward the floor, and 4 means that you strum up toward the ceiling. (If you
play your guitar while hanging in gravity boots, however, you must reverse
these last two instructions.) The term sim. is an abbreviation of the Italian
word simile, which instructs you to keep playing in a similar manner — in
this case to keep strumming in a down, down-up, down, down pattern.
If you’re using only your fingers for strumming, play upstrokes with the back
of your thumbnail whenever you see the symbol 4.
Knowing the basic open chords in the D family (D, Em, G, and A) enables you
to play a song in the key of D right now. If you skip to the section “Playing
Songs with Basic Major and Minor Chords,” later in this chapter, you can play
the song “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” right now. Go for it!

Chapter 4: The Easiest Way to Play: Basic Major and Minor Chords

Playing Chords in the G Family
By tackling related chord families (as A, D, and G are), you carry over your
knowledge from family to family in the form of chords that you already know
from earlier families. The basic chords that make up the G family are G, Am,
C, D, and Em. If you already know G, D, and Em (which we describe in the pre-
ceding sections on the A and D families), you can now try Am and C. Listen to
“You’ve Got a Friend,” as played by James Taylor, to hear the sound of a song
that uses G-family chords.
Fingering G-family chords
In Figure 4-5, you see the fingerings for Am and C, the new chords that you
need to play in the G family. Notice that the fingering of these two chords is
similar: Each has finger 1 on the 2nd string, first fret, and finger 2 on the 4th
string, second fret. (Only finger 3 must change — adding or removing it — in
switching between these two chords.) In moving between these chords, keep
these first two fingers in place on the strings. Switching chords is always
easier if you don’t need to move all your fingers to new positions. The notes
that different chords share are known as common tones. Notice the X over the
6th string in each of these chords. Don’t play that string while strumming
either C or Am. (We mean it!)
Strumming G-family chords
Figure 4-6 shows a simple chord progression that you can play by using G-
family chords. Play this progression over and over to accustom yourself to
switching chords and to build up those left-hand calluses. It does get easier
after a while. We promise!

Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 

Notice that, in each measure, you play beats 2 and 3 as “down-up” strums.
Listen to the CD to hear this sound.
Knowing the basic open chords in the G family (G, Am, C, D, and Em) enables
you to play a song in the key of G right now. Skip to the section “Playing
Songs with Basic Major and Minor Chords,” later in this chapter, and you can
play “Auld Lang Syne.” As the relieved shepherd said after the mother sheep
returned to the flock, “Happy, Ewe Near.”
Playing Chords in the C Family
The last chord family that we need to discuss is C. Some people say that C 
is the easiest key to play in. That’s because C uses only the white-key notes 
of the piano in its musical scale and, as such, is sort of the music-theory
square one — the point at which everything (and, usually, everyone) begins
in music.
We chose to place the C family last in this chapter because, heck, it’s so easy
that it has lots of chords in its family — too many to master all at once.
The basic chords that make up the C family are C, Dm, Em, F, G, and Am. If
you practice the preceding sections on the A-, D-, and G-family chords, you
know C, Em, G, and Am. (If not, check them out.) So in this section, you need
to pick up only two more chords: Dm and F. After you know these two additional
chords, you have all the basic major and minor chords that we describe in
this chapter down pat. Listen to “Dust in the Wind,” by Kansas or “The
Boxer,” by Simon and Garfunkel to hear the sound of a song that uses 
C-family chords.

Fingering C-family chords
In Figure 4-7, you see the new chords that you need to play in the C family.
Notice that both the Dm and F chords have the second finger on the 3rd
string, second fret. Hold this common tone down as you switch between
these two chords.
Many people find the F chord the most difficult chord to play of all the basic
major and minor chords. That’s because F uses no open strings, and it also
requires a barre. A barre is what you’re playing whenever you press down
two or more strings at once with a single left-hand finger. To play the F chord,
for example, you use your first finger to press down both the 1st and 2nd
strings at the first fret simultaneously.
You must exert extra finger pressure to play a barre. At first, you may find
that, as you strum the chord (hitting the top four strings only, as the Xs in the
chord diagram indicate), you hear some buzzes or muffled strings. Experiment
with various placements of your index finger. Try adjusting the angle of your
finger or try rotating your finger slightly on its side. Keep trying until you find
a position for the first finger that enables all four strings to ring clearly as you
strike them.
Strumming C-family chords
Figure 4-8 shows a simple chord progression that you can play by using C-
family chords. Play the progression over and over to get used to switching
among the chords in this family and, of course, to help build up those nasty
little calluses.

Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 

Look at Figure 4-8. Notice the small curved line joining the second half of beat
2 to beat 3. This line is known as a tie. A tie tells you not to strike the second
note of the two tied notes (in this case, the one on beat 3). Instead, just keep
holding the chord on that beat (letting it ring) without restriking it with your
right hand.
Listen to the CD to hear the sound of this strumming pattern. This slightly
jarring rhythmic effect is an example of syncopation. In syncopation, the musi-
cian either strikes a note (or chord) where you don’t expect to hear it or fails
to strike a note (or chord) where you do expect to hear it.
You probably usually expect to strike notes on the beats (1, 2, 3, 4). In the
example in Figure 4-8, however, you strike no chord on beat 3. That variation
in the strumming pattern makes the chord on beat 21⁄2 feel as if it’s accentu-
ated (or, as musicians say, accented). This accentuation interrupts the normal
(expected) pulse of the music, resulting in the syncopation of the music.
Syncopation breaks up the regular pattern of beats and presents an element
of surprise in music. The balance between expectation and surprise in music
is what holds a listener’s interest. (Well, that and the promise of free hors
d’oeuvres at the intermission.)
To play a song that uses C-family chords right now, skip to the song “Michael,

say it? — hipper musical genres. Pick up on these songs first, and you’re cer-
tain to be playing the music of your choice in no time — we promise!
You may notice that all the strumming examples that we provide in this chap-
ter are only four measures long. Must all your exercises be limited this way,
you may ask? No, but songwriters do very commonly write music in four-
measure phrases. So the length of these exercises prepares you for actual
passages in real songs. You may also notice that each strumming example is
in 4/4 time, which means that each measure contains four beats. Any reason?
Most popular songs contain four beats per measure, so the 4/4 time signature
in the exercises also prepares you to play actual songs. (See Appendix A for
more information on time signatures.)
In the examples that you find in earlier sections of this chapter, you play each
chord for one full measure. But in this section of actual songs, you sometimes
play a single chord for more than a measure, and sometimes you change
chords within a single measure. Listen to the CD to hear the rhythm of the
chord changes as you follow the beat numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) that appear below
the guitar staff.
After you can comfortably play your way through these songs, try to memo-
rize them. That way, you don’t need to stare into a book as you’re trying to
develop your rhythm.
If you get bored with these songs — or with the way you play these songs —
show the music to a guitar-playing friend and ask him to play the same songs
by using the strumming patterns and chord positions that we indicate. Listening
to someone else play helps you hear the songs objectively, and if your friend
has a little flair, you may pick up a cool little trick or two. Work on infusing a
bit of personality into all your playing, even if you’re just strumming a simple
folk song.
Here’s some special information to help you play the songs in this section:
 Kumbaya: To play “Kumbaya” (the ultimate campfire song), you need to
know how to play A, D, and E chords (see the section “Fingering A-family
chords,” earlier in this chapter); how to strum by using all downstrokes;
and how to start a fire by using only two sticks and some dried leaves.
The first measure in this song is known as a pickup measure, which is
incomplete; it starts the song with one or more beats missing — in this
case, the first two. During the pickup measure, the guitar part shows a rest,
or a musical silence. Don’t play during the rest; begin playing on the syl-
lable “ya” on beat 1. Notice, too, that the last bar is missing two beats —
beats 3 and 4. The missing beats in the last measure enable you to repeat
the pickup measure in repeated playings of the song, and to make that
measure, combined with the first incomplete measure, total the requisite
four beats.
52
Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 

 Swing Low, Sweet Chariot: To play “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,” you
need to know how to play D, Em, G, and A chords (see the section
“Fingering D-family chords,” earlier in this chapter); how to play down
and down-up strums; and how to sing like James Earl Jones.
This song starts with a one-beat pickup, and the guitar rests for that
beat. Notice that beat 2 of measures 2, 4, and 6 has two strums instead
of one. Strum those beats down and then up (2 and 4) with each strum
twice as fast as a regular strum.
 Auld Lang Syne: To play “Auld Lang Syne,” you need to know how to
play G, Am, C, D, and Em chords (see the section “Fingering G-family
chords,” earlier in this chapter); how to play down and down-up strums;
and what “Auld Lang Syne” means in the first place.
Measure 8 is a little tricky, because you play three different chords in the
same measure (Em, Am, and D). In the second half of the measure, you
change chords on each beat — one stroke per chord. Practice playing
only measure 8 slowly, over and over. Then play the song. Note: In
changing between G and C (bars 4–6 and 12–19), fingering G with fingers
2, 3, and 4 instead of 1, 2, and 3 makes the chord switch easier. If you
finger the chord that way, the second and third fingers form a shape that
simply moves over one string.
 Michael, Row the Boat Ashore: To play “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore,”
you need to know how to play C, Dm, Em, F, and G chords (see the section
“Fingering C-family chords,” earlier in this chapter); how to play a synco-
pated eighth-note strum (see the section “Strumming C-family chords,”
earlier in this chapter); and the meaning of the word hootenanny.
The strumming pattern here is syncopated. The strum that normally
occurs on beat 3 is anticipated, meaning that it actually comes half a
beat early. This kind of syncopation gives the song a Latin feel. Listen to
the CD to hear the strumming rhythm. Remember, on the Dm and F
chords, you don’t strum the lowest two strings (the 6th and 5th). For the
C chord, don’t strum the bottom string (the 6th).

Chapter 4: The Easiest Way to Play: Basic Major and Minor Chords

Having Fun with Basic Major and Minor
Chords: The “Oldies” Progression
As we promise in the introduction to this chapter, you can play lots of popular
songs right away if you know the basic major and minor chords. One cool thing
that you can do right now is play oldies — songs from the late ’50s and early
’60s such as “Earth Angel” and “Duke of Earl.” These songs are based on what’s
sometimes called the oldies progression. The oldies progression is a series of four
chords; they’re repeated over and over to form the accompaniment for a song.
You can play the oldies progression in any key, but the best guitar keys for the
oldies progression are C and G. In the key of C, the four chords that make up
the progression are C-Am-F-G. And in the key of G, the chords are G-Em-C-D. Try
strumming the progression in each key by playing four down-strums per chord.
Play the four chords over and over, in the sequence given. If you need help
with the fingerings for these chords, check out the sections “Playing Chords in
the C Family” and “Playing Chords in the G Family,” earlier in this chapter.
The fun begins as you sing oldies while accompanying yourself with the
oldies progression. As you sing a particular song, you find that one of the
keys (C or G) better suits your vocal range, so use that key. Playing oldies can
become addicting, but the good news is that, if you can’t stop, you build up
your calluses very quickly.
For some songs, you play four one-beat strums per chord; for others, you
play eight or two. Below, we list some songs you can play with the oldies pro-
gression right now. Next to each, we show you how many times you strum
each chord. Don’t forget to sing. Have fun! 
 All I Have to Do Is Dream. Two strums per chord.
 Blue Moon. Two strums per chord.
 Breaking Up Is Hard to Do. Two strums per chord.
 Come Go with Me. Two strums per chord.
 Duke of Earl. Four strums per chord.
 Earth Angel. Two strums per chord.
 Heart and Soul. Two strums per chord.
 Hey Paula. Two strums per chord.
 In the Still of the Night. (The one by the Five Satins, not the Cole Porter
one.) Four strums per chord.

Playing Melodies without 
Reading Music!
In This Chapter
 Reading tablature
 Using correct left-hand fingering
 Using alternate picking style
 Playing songs with single notes
M
ost guitar books present melodies as a way to teach you to read music.
In fact, the primary goal of most guitar books isn’t to teach you to play
guitar in the real world but to teach music reading through the guitar. The dif-
ference is significant.
If you pick up guitar playing through a book, you can eventually play nursery-
rhyme ditties in perfect quarter and half notes. But if you learn to play as
most guitar players do — through friends showing you licks or by using your
ear — you can come away playing “Smoke on the Water,” “Sunshine of Your
Love,” “Blackbird,” and the entire repertoire of Neil Young. All of which
means that you don’t need to read music to play guitar.
Okay, so maybe reading music is a valuable skill. But the purpose of this
chapter isn’t to teach you to read; it’s to get you to play. If we need to show
you a lick, we use tablature — a special notation system designed especially
for showing how you play the guitar. Or we refer you to the CD so that you can
hear the lick. Or both.
We offer melodies in this chapter primarily so that you can accustom your
hands to playing single notes. That way, whenever you decide that you want
to play like a real guitarist — someone who combines chords, melodies, riffs,
and licks into an integrated whole — you’re ready to rock.
By the way, a lick is a short, melodic phrase, often made up on the spot and
played only once. A riff is a short melodic phrase, often composed to be 
the main accompaniment figure in a song (as in “Can you play the ‘Day
Tripper’ riff?”).

Reading Tablature While 
Listening to the CD
Numbers on the tablature (or tab) staff tell you which frets on which strings
to finger with your left hand. A 0 indicates an open string. By listening to the
CD, you can hear when to play these notes. And just to be safe, thorough, and
completely redundant, we also include the standard notation for the follow-
ing reasons:
 For people who read music already.
 For people who plan to read Appendix A (on how to read music) and
apply what they read there.
 For people who want to gradually pick up the skill of music reading (at
least by osmosis if not rigorous study) by listening to the CD and follow-
ing along with the rhythm notation.
 For us, the authors, who get paid by the page.
Top or bottom?
The music in this book contains a double staff: standard music notation on
the top, tab on the bottom. The top staff is for music readers or for people
interested in standard notation. The bottom staff shows the same info (minus
the rhythm) but in tab numbers. Here’s how the tab staff works.
The top line of the tab staff represents the top string of the guitar (high E).
This positioning of the strings in the tab staff may momentarily confuse you,
because the top string in the tab staff — the 1st — is actually the string clos-
est to the floor as you hold the guitar in playing position. But trust us, the
setup’s more intuitive this way, and after you make the adjustment, you never
think about it again. By the way, if you hold the guitar flat on your lap, with
the neck facing the ceiling, the 1st string is farthest away from you, just as the
top line is when you see the tab staff on the page. Check out the cheat sheet
at the beginning of the book to see a visual representation of this concept.
Moving on, the second tab line from the top represents the 2nd string (B) and
so on down to the bottom tab line, which represents the 6th (low E) string on
the guitar.
In guitar tab, lines represent strings and numbers represent frets. Tab does
not, however, tell you which left-hand fingers to use. (Neither does standard
notation, for that matter.) But more on fingering later.
62
Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 

Right or left?
Just as in reading text or music, you start from the left and proceed to the
right in reading tab. Using Figure 5-1 as your example, begin with the first
note, which you play at the first fret of the 2nd string. The placement of the
tab number on the second line from the top tells you to play the B string —
the one next to high E — and the number 1 tells you to place your finger at
the first fret. Go ahead and play that note and then proceed to the next note,
which is also on the 2nd string, first fret. Keep moving right, playing the notes
in order, until you reach the end. (Don’t worry about the symbols above the
numbers for now; we explain them in the section “Alternate Picking,” later in
this chapter.) The vertical lines that appear on the staff after every few notes
are bar lines. They divide the staff into small units of time, called bars or mea-
sures. Measures help you count beats and break up the music into smaller,
more manageable units. In Figure 5-1, you see four measures of four beats
each. See Appendix A for more information on beats and measures.
After you understand the concepts of top versus bottom and left versus right
in the tab staff and also understand that the lines indicate strings and the
numbers on the lines indicate fret position, you can listen to the CD and
easily follow (and play) the tab. The two media, CD and print, serve to rein-
force each other. If you didn’t realize it yet, you’re picking up guitar the multi-
media way. (Mail us your proof-of-purchase and we even send you a secret
decoder ring and virtual-reality goggles! Just kidding!)

Chapter 5: Playing Melodies without Reading Music!

Getting a Grip on Left-Hand Fingering
After you figure out how to read guitar tablature, you know what frets to
press down, but you still may have no idea of which fingers to use to press
down the frets. Well, we can clear that up pretty quickly. Usually, you don’t
need any notation to alert you to which fingers to use, because you most
often play in position. Stick with us for a moment. 
A position on the guitar is a group of four consecutive frets; for example, frets
1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, 6, 7, 8. The first fret in a series of four marks the beginning of a
new position; for example, frets 2, 3, 4, and 5, frets 3, 4, 5, and 6, and so on,
are positions as well. But the easiest way to play melodies on the guitar is to
play them in first or second position — that is, using frets 1 through 4 or frets
2 through 5 — because these positions are close to the nut, allowing you to
easily and smoothly utilize the open strings as well as the fretted notes in
playing a melody.
Open position itself consists of the combination of all the open strings plus
the notes in the first or second position — just as the chords that you play
low on the neck using open strings (A, D, Em, and so on) are known as open
chords. (For more information on open chords, check out Chapter 4.)
In any position, each finger plays the notes of a specific fret — and only of
that fret. The index finger always plays the notes of the lowest fret in that
position (lowest meaning towards the nut), with the other fingers covering
the other frets in sequential order. In first position, for example, the fret num-
bers correspond to the fingers — the first finger (the index finger) plays the
notes in the first fret; the second finger (middle finger) plays the notes in the
second fret; and so on. Using one finger per fret enables you to switch
between notes quickly.
As you play the open-position melodies in this chapter, make sure that you
press your left-hand fingers down correctly, as follows:
 Press down on the string with the tip of your finger just before the metal
fret wire (toward the nut).
 Keep the last joint of the finger perpendicular (or as close to perpendic-
ular as possible) to the fretboard.
Using Alternate Picking
As you play a song, you use both hands at once. After you figure out which
notes to press with the left hand, you need to know how to strike the strings
with the right.
64
Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 

You can use either a pick or the right-hand fingers to strike single notes; for
now, use the pick, holding it firmly between the thumb and index finger (per-
pendicular to the thumb with just the tip sticking out). Check out Chapter 3
for more information on holding the pick. (We discuss playing with the fin-
gers in Chapters 12 and 13.)
Alternate picking is the right-hand picking technique that uses both down-
strokes (toward the floor) and upstrokes (toward the ceiling). The advantage
of alternate picking is that you can play rapid, successive notes in a smooth,
flowing manner. Single notes that you need to play relatively fast almost
always require alternate picking.
Try the following experiment:
1. Hold the pick between your thumb and index finger of your right hand.
Again, see Chapter 3 for more information on holding the pick.
2. Using only downstrokes, pick the open 1st string repeatedly as fast as
possible (down-down-down-down, and so on).
Try to play as smoothly and evenly as possible.
3. Now try the same thing but alternating downstrokes and upstrokes
(down-up-down-up, and so on).
This alternating motion feels much quicker and smoother, doesn’t it? 
The reason that you can play faster with alternate picking is clear. To play
two successive downstrokes, you’d need to bring the pick back up above the
E string anyway. But by actually striking the string with the pick on the way
back up (using an upstroke) instead of avoiding the string, you can greatly
increase your speed. 
Check to make sure that you understand the concept of alternate picking by
following the next two sets of steps. The symbols for a downstroke and
upstroke are the same ones used for strumming in Chapter 4.
To play a downstroke (the 2 symbol above the tab), follow these steps:
1. Start with the pick slightly above the string (on the “ceiling” side).
2. Strike the string in a downward motion (toward the floor).
To play an upstroke (the 4 symbol above the tab), follow these steps:
1. Start with the pick below the string (on the “floor” side).
2. Strike the string in an upward motion (toward the ceiling).
65
Chapter 5: Playing Melodies without Reading Music!

The melody in the tab staff example that we show you in Figure 5-1 is actually
that of “Old MacDonald Had a Farm.” Try playing that melody to see how it
sounds. First, play the tune slowly, using only downstrokes. Then play it
faster by using alternating picking, as the symbols above the tab staff indi-
cate. Here a pick, there a pick, everywhere a pick-pick. . . .
Playing Songs with Simple Melodies
In Chapter 4, all the songs that you play are in 4/4 time. The songs in this
chapter, on the other hand, are in various meters. (The meter indicates how
many beats per measure: 4, 3, 2, and so on; see Appendix A for more informa-
tion on beats and measures.) You play all these songs in open position. (See
the section “Left-Hand Fingering,” earlier in this chapter.)
You’ve probably known the songs in this chapter all your life, but never
thought about them in a musical sense — what meter they’re in and what
rhythms they use — and you almost certainly never thought of “E-I-E-I-O” as
alternating downstrokes and upstrokes.
The fact that a bunch of supposedly simple folk songs — tunes you’ve never
thought twice about before — now make you feel slow and clumsy as you try
to play them may seem a bit deflating. But playing the guitar is a cumulative
endeavor. Every technique you pick up, even if you practice it in “Little
Brown Jug,” applies to all songs that use those same techniques, from Van
Morrison to Beethoven, from “Moondance” to the “Moonlight Sonata.” Hang
in there with the technical stuff and the rest follows.
Here is some useful information about the songs to help you along:
 Little Brown Jug: To play this song, you need to know how to count two
beats per measure (see Appendix A and listen to the CD); how to finger
notes in first position (see the section “Left-Hand Fingering,” earlier in
this chapter); and how to make a song about getting drunk sound suit-
able for small children.
This song has only two beats per measure (not four). The time signature
(2/4) tells you this fact. Play all the fretted notes in the first position by
using the same-numbered left-hand fingers as the fret numbers — that is,
use the first finger for the first fret, the second finger for the second fret,
and so on. Follow the 2 and 4 indications above the tab numbers for
downstrokes and upstrokes. The sim. means to continue the same pick-
ing pattern for the rest of the song.
66
Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 

 On Top of Old Smoky: To play this song, you need to know how to
count three beats per measure (see Appendix A and listen to the CD);
how to finger notes in first position (see the section “Left-Hand
Fingering,” earlier in this chapter); and how to make a song about infi-
delity sound childlike and whimsical.
This old favorite has three beats per measure, as the time signature
(3/4) indicates. This song is in open position — the one that combines
first position with the open strings. Use the same finger numbers for
fretting as the indicated fret number. We don’t indicate any symbols for
up and down picking for you in this song; use your own judgment and
pick out the notes of the song in the way that feels most natural to you.
Some of these notes you can play by using either up- or downstrokes.
 Swanee River: To play this song, you need to know how to count four
beats per measure (see Appendix A and listen to the CD); how to finger
notes in second position (see the section “Left-Hand Fingering,” earlier
in this chapter); and how to sound politically correct while playing a
song about the old plantation.
This old tune of the South has four beats per measure, as its 4/4 time sig-
nature indicates. Play the song by using the open position that combines
the second position with the open strings — that is, your first finger
plays the notes on the second fret; your second finger plays the notes of
the third fret; and your third finger plays the notes of the fourth fret. You
can also play the song by using the first position with open strings, but
playing it that way is a lot harder. (Fingers 1 and 3 are stronger than 2
and 4.) Try it if you don’t believe us. See — we told you! (Oh, and see the
section “Left-Hand Fingering,” earlier in this chapter, if you don’t know
what positions you’re playing here at all.)
Notice the symbols for up and down picking above the tab staff. Play
downstrokes (2) for the notes that fall on the beats and upstrokes (4)
for the notes that fall between the beats. Again, sim. means keep playing
that same picking pattern to the end. By the way, this song’s actual title
is “Old Folks at Home,” but most people just call it “Swanee River.” (It’s
the song that stumped Ralph Kramden on the game show The $99,000
Answer on the old Honeymooners episode. The tune was written by
Stephen Foster — not Ed Norton!)

Chapter 6
Adding Some Spice: 
Basic 7th Chords
In This Chapter
 Playing dominant 7th chords
 Playing minor 7th chords
 Playing major 7th chords
 Playing songs that use 7th chords
 Having some fun with 7th chords
I
n this chapter, we show you how to play what are known as open-position
7th chords. Seventh chords are no more difficult to play than are the
simple major or minor chords that we describe in Chapter 4, but their sound
is more complex than that of major and minor chords (because they’re made
up of four different notes instead of three), and their usage in music is a little
more specialized.
The situation’s kind of like that of the knives in your kitchen. Any big, sharp
knife can cut both a pizza and a pineapple, but if you spend a lot of time
doing either, you figure out that you need to use the circular-bladed gizmo for
the pizza and a cleaver for the pineapple. These utensils may not be as versa-
tile or as popular as your general-purpose knives, but if you’re making
Hawaiian-style pizza, nothing beats ’em. The more your culinary skills
develop, the more you appreciate specialized cutlery. And the more your ear
skills develop, the more you understand where to substitute 7th chords for
the more ordinary major and minor chords. The different 7th chords can
make the blues sound “bluesy” and jazz sound “jazzy.”
Seventh chords come in several varieties, and each type has a different
sound, or quality. In this chapter, we introduce you to the three most impor-
tant types of 7th chords that you encounter in playing the guitar — dominant
7th, minor 7th, and major 7th.

Dominant 7th Chords
Dominant seems a funny, technical name for a chord that’s called a plain
“seven” if you group it with a letter-name chord symbol. If you say just C7 or
A7, for example, you’re referring to a dominant 7th chord. 
Actually, the term dominant refers to the 5th degree of a major scale — but
don’t worry about the theory. 
The important thing is that you call the chords “dominant 7ths” merely to
distinguish them from other types of 7th chords (minor 7ths and major 7ths).
Note, too, that dominant has nothing whatsoever to do with leather and stud-
ded collars. You can hear the sound of dominant sevenths in such songs as
Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs’ “Wooly Bully” and the Beatles’ “I Saw Her
Standing There.”
D7, G7, and C7
The D7, G7, and C7 chords are among the most common of the open domi-
nant 7ths. (For more on open chords, see Chapter 4.) Figure 6-1 shows you
diagrams of these three chords that guitarists often use together to play songs.

Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 

If you already know how to play C (which we introduce in Chapter 4), you can
form C7 by simply adding your pinky on the 3rd string (at the third fret).
Notice the Xs above the 5th and 6th strings on the D7 chord. Don’t play those
strings as you strum. Similarly, for the C7 chord, don’t play the 6th string as
you strum.
Practice strumming D7, G7, and C7. You don’t need written music for this
exercise, so you’re on the honor system to do it. Try strumming D7 four
times, G7 four times, and then C7 four times. You want to accustom your left
hand to the feel of the chords themselves and to switching among them.
If you want to play a song right now using these new chords, skip to the sec-
tion “Playing Songs with 7th Chords,” later in this chapter. You can play
“Home on the Range” with the chords you know right now.
E7 and A7
Two more 7th chords that you often use together to play songs are the E7
and A7 chords. Figure 6-2 shows how you play these two open 7th chords.
If you know how to play E (check out Chapter 4), you can form E7 by simply
removing your 3rd finger from the 4th string. 
This version of the E7 chord, as the figure shows, uses only two fingers. You
can also play an open position E7 chord with four fingers (as we describe in
the following section). For now, however, play the two-finger version, because
it’s easier to fret quickly, especially if you’re just starting out.
Practice E7 and A7 by strumming each chord four times, switching back and
forth between them. Remember to avoid striking the 6th string on the A7
chord.
If you want to play a song that uses these two open 7th chords right now,
skip to the section “Playing Songs with 7th Chords,” later in this chapter, and
play “All Through the Night.”
73
Chapter 6: Adding Some Spice: Basic 7th Chords

E7 (four-finger version) and B7
Two more popular open-position 7th chords are the four-finger version of E7
and the B7 chord. Figure 6-3 shows you how to finger the four-finger E7 and
the B7 chords. Most people think that this E7 has a better voicing (vertical
arrangement of notes) than does the two-finger E7. You often use the B7
chord along with E7 to play certain songs. Remember to avoid striking the
6th string on the B7 chord.
If you already know how to play E (see Chapter 4), you can form this E7 by
simply adding your pinky on the 2nd string (at the third fret). 
Practice these chords by strumming each one four times, switching back and
forth. As you do so, notice that your second finger plays the same note at the
same fret in each chord — the one at the second fret of the 5th string. This
note is a common tone (that is, it’s common to both chords). In switching
back and forth between the two chords, keep this finger down on the 5th
string — doing so makes switching easier. Note: Always hold down common
tones whenever you’re switching chords. They provide an anchor of stability
for your left hand. 
To use these chords in a song right now, skip to the section “Playing Songs
with 7th Chords,” later in this chapter, and play “Over the River and Through
the Woods.”

Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 

Minor 7th Chords — Dm7, 
Em7, and Am7
Minor 7th chords differ from dominant 7th chords in that their character 
is a little softer and jazzier. Minor 7th chords are the chords you hear in
“Moondance,” by Van Morrison, and the verses of “Light My Fire,” by the
Doors.
Figure 6-4 shows diagrams for the three open-position minor 7th (m7) chords.
(See Chapter 8 and Appendix B for more minor 7th chords.)
Notice that the Dm7 uses a two-string barre — that is, you press down two
strings with a single finger (the first finger, in this case) at the first fret.
Angling your finger slightly or rotating it on its side may help you fret those
notes firmly and eliminate any buzzes as you play the chord. The 6th and 5th
strings have Xs above them. Don’t strike those strings while strumming.
You finger the Am7 chord much like you do the C chord that we show you in
Chapter 4; just lift your third finger off a C chord — and you have Am7. In
switching between C and Am7 chords, remember to hold down the two
common tones with your first and second fingers. This way, you can switch
between the chords much more quickly. And if you know how to play an F
chord (see Chapter 4), you can form Dm7 simply by removing your third finger.

Chapter 6: Adding Some Spice: Basic 7th Chords

Major 7th Chords — Cmaj7, 
Fmaj7, Amaj7, and Dmaj7
Major 7th chords differ from dominant 7th chords and minor 7th chords in
that their character is bright and jazzy. You can hear this kind of chord at the
beginning of “Ventura Highway,” by America, and “Don’t Let the Sun Catch
You Crying,” by Gerry and the Pacemakers.
Figure 6-5 shows four open-position major 7th (maj7) chords. (For more
major 7th chords, check out Chapter 8 and Appendix B.)
Notice that the Dmaj7 uses a three-string barre with the first finger. Rotating
the first finger slightly on its side helps make the chord easier to play. Don’t
play the 6th or 5th strings as you strike the Dmaj7 or Fmaj7 (see the Xs in the
diagrams in Figure 6-5). And don’t play the 6th string on the Amaj7 or Cmaj7.
In moving between Cmaj7 and Fmaj7, notice that the second and third fingers
move as a fixed shape across the strings in switching between these chords.
The first finger doesn’t fret any string in a Cmaj7 chord, but keep it curled
and poised above the first fret of the 2nd string so that you can bring it down
quickly for the switch to Fmaj7.
Practice moving back and forth (strumming four times each) between Cmaj7
and Fmaj7 and between Amaj7 and Dmaj7.

Playing Songs with 7th Chords
Listen to the CD to hear the rhythm of the strums of these songs as you
follow the slash notation in the guitar part. If you have difficulty remembering
how to finger the chords, rip out the cheat sheet in the front of the book and
consult the back side of it for some crib notes. Don’t try to play the vocal
line. It’s there only as a reference.
Here is some useful information about the songs to help you along:
 Home on the Range: To play “Home on the Range,” you need to know
how to play C, C7, F, D7, and G7 chords (see Chapter 4 for the C and F
chords and the section “Dominant 7th Chords,” earlier in this chapter,
for the others); how to play a “bass strum strum” pattern; and how to
wail like a coyote.
In the music, you see the words “Bass strum strum” over the rhythm
slashes. Instead of simply strumming the chord for three beats, play
only the lowest note of the chord on the first beat and then strum the
remaining notes of the chord on beats 2 and 3. The sim. means to keep
on playing this pattern throughout.

Chapter 6: Adding Some Spice: Basic 7th Chords

 All Through the Night: To play “All Through the Night,” you need to
know how to play D, E7, A7, and G chords (see Chapter 4 for the D and G
chords and the section earlier in this chapter on the E7 and A7 chords);
how to read repeat signs; and how to stay awake during this intensely
somnolent ditty.
In the music, you see repeat signs, which tell you to play certain mea-
sures twice. In this case, you play measures 1, 2, 3, 4, and then measures
1, 2, 3, 5. See Appendix A for more information on repeat signs. Use the
two-finger E7 for this song.
 Over the River and Through the Woods: To play “Over the River and
Through the Woods,” you need to know how to play A, D, E7, and B7
chords (see Chapter 4 for the A and D chords and the section on the
four-finger version of E7 and B7, earlier in this chapter); how to strum in
6/8 time (see the following paragraph); and the way to Grandma’s house
(in case your horse stumbles and you need to shoot it).
The 6/8 time signature has a lilting feel to it — sort of as though the music
has a gallop or limp. “When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again” is
another familiar song that you play in 6/8 time. (See Appendix A for more
information on time signatures.) Count only two beats per measure —
not six (unless you want to sound like a rabbit that’s had three cups of
coffee). Use the four-finger E7 for this song.
 It’s Raining, It’s Pouring: To play “It’s Raining, It’s Pouring,” you need to
know how to play Amaj7 and Dmaj7 chords (see the section, “Major 7th
Chords,” earlier in this chapter) and how to sing in a really whiny,
annoying voice.
This song is a jazzed-up version of the old nursery rhyme “It’s Raining,
It’s Pouring,” also known as the childhood taunt “Billy Is a Sissy” (or
whichever personal childhood nemesis you plug in to the title). The
major 7th chords that you play in this song sound jazzy and give any
song a modern sound. Use all downstrokes on the strums.
 Oh, Susanna: To play “Oh, Susanna,” you need to know how to play
Cmaj7, Dm7, Em7, Fmaj7, Am7, D7, Dm7, G7, and C chords (see Chapter 4
for C and various sections earlier in this chapter for the different 7th
chords) and how to balance a banjo on your knee while traveling the
Southern United States.
This arrangement of “Oh, Susanna” uses three types of 7th chords: domi-
nant 7ths (D7 and G7), minor 7ths (Dm7, Em7, and Am7), and major 7ths
(Cmaj7 and Fmaj7). Using minor 7ths and major 7ths gives the song a
hip sound. Lest you think this attempt to “jazz up” a simple folk song
comes from out of the blue, listen to James Taylor’s beautiful rendition
of “Oh, Susanna” on the 1970 album Sweet Baby James to hear a similar
approach. He actually says “banjo” without sounding corny. Use all
downstrokes on the strums.

Fun with 7th Chords: The 12-Bar Blues
Playing the guitar isn’t all about folk songs and nursery rhymes, you know.
Sometimes you can pick up something really cool. And what’s cooler than the
blues? By knowing a few dominant 7th chords and being able to strum four
beats per measure, you already have the basics down pat for playing 99 per-
cent of all blues songs ever written.
Ninety-nine percent?! That’s right! The 12-bar blues follow a simple chord for-
mula, or progression, that involves three dominant 7ths. In this progression,
you don’t need to know any new chords or techniques; you need to know
only which three dominant 7th chords to play — and in which order.
Playing the 12-bar blues
The key of E is one of the best “guitar keys” for playing the blues. Figure 6-6
shows the chord progression to a 12-bar blues in E. Practice this pattern and
become familiar with the way chords change in a blues progression.
Famous 12-bar blues songs include “Rock Around the Clock,” “Blue Suede
Shoes,” “Roll Over Beethoven,” “Long Tall Sally,” “Kansas City,” “The Twist,”
“The Peppermint Twist,” and “Johnny B. Goode.” You can play any of these
right now just by singing along and observing the 12-bar scheme in Figure 6-6.
(For more information on 12-bar blues, see Chapters 10 and 11.)

Part II: So Start Playing: The Basics 

Writing your own blues song
Blues songs are simple to write lyrics for. (Just think of any Little Richard song.)
Usually, you repeat lines and then finish off with a zinger — for example:
My baby she done left me, and she stole my best friend Joe. My baby she
done left me, and she stole my best friend Joe. Now I’m all alone and
cryin’, ’cause I miss him so.
Try composing some lyrics yourself, improvise a melody, and apply them to
the blues progression that we outline here.
As a rule, a good blues song must include the following elements:
 A subject dealing with hardship or injustice.
 A locale or situation conducive to misery.
 Bad grammar.
Use the following table to find mix-and-match elements for your blues songs.

Why not compose one yourself? Call it the “Left-Hand Callus Blues” and talk
about how them bad ol’ strings put a big hurtin’ on your fingertips. Then see

In this part . . .
A
fter you’ve got a pretty good handle on the basics of
guitar playing and your fingers stop screaming in
pain after a practice session, you’ll want to move into
some more advanced territory. This is the place to look
for it! Chapter 7 introduces you to position playing, in
which you no longer pick or strum open strings; instead,
they’re all fretted. Chapter 8 tells you about barre chords,
which are really useful because after mastering a finger
position, you can move that position up and down the
guitar neck to create new chords. Chapter 9 tells you
about special licks that you can use to really strut your
stuff!

Chapter 7
Playing Melodies in Position 
and in Double-Stops
In This Chapter
 Playing single notes in position
 Playing double-stops as string pairs
 Playing double-stops across the neck
 Playing songs in position and in double-stops
O
ne of the give-aways of beginning players is that they can play only
down the neck, in open position, and that they play only single-string
melodies. As you get to know the guitar better, you find you can use the
whole neck to express your musical ideas, and that you’re not limited to
plunking out just single notes.
In this chapter, you venture out of open-position base camp into the higher
altitudes of position playing. You also pick up the technique of playing in
double-stops along the way.
Playing in Position
As you listen to complicated-sounding guitar music played by virtuoso guitarists,
you may imagine their left hands leaping around the fretboard with abandon.
But usually, if you watch those guitarists on stage or TV, you discover that their
left hands hardly move at all. Those guitarists are playing in position.
Playing in position means that your left hand remains in a fixed location on
the neck, with each finger more or less on permanent assignment to a spe-
cific fret, and that you fret every note — you don’t use any open strings. If
you’re playing in fifth position, for example, your first finger plays the fifth
fret, your second finger plays the sixth fret, your third finger plays the sev-
enth fret, and your fourth finger plays the eighth fret. A position, therefore,
gets its name from the fret that your first finger plays.

In addition to enabling you to play notes where they feel and sound best on
the fingerboard — not just where you can most easily grab available notes
(such as the open-string notes in open position), playing in position makes
you look cool — like a nonbeginner! Think of it this way: A layup and a slam
dunk are both worth two points in basketball, but only in the latter case does
the announcer scream, “And the crowd goes wild!”
Playing in position versus 
playing with open strings
Why play in position? Why not use open position and open strings all the
time? We can give you two key reasons:
 It’s easier to play high-note melodies. Playing in open position allows
you to play only up to the fourth or fifth fret. If you want to play higher
than that, position playing enables you to play the notes smoothly and
economically.
 You can instantly transpose any pattern or phrase that you know in
position to another key simply by moving your hand to another posi-
tion. Because position playing involves no open strings, everything you
play in position is movable.
People have the idea that playing guitar in lower positions is easier than play-
ing in higher ones. The higher notes actually aren’t harder to play; they’re
just harder to read in standard notation if you don’t get too far in a conven-
tional method book (where reading high notes is usually saved till last). But
here, you’re not focusing on music reading but on guitar playing — so go for
the high notes whenever you want.
Playing exercises in position
The major scale (you know, the familiar do-re-me-fa-sol-la-ti-do sound you get
by playing the white keys on the piano starting from C) is a good place to
start practicing the skills you need to play in position. Figure 7-1 shows a C
major scale in second position. Although you can play this scale in open posi-
tion, play it as the tab staff in the figure indicates, because you want to start
practicing your position playing.
90
Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

The most important thing about playing in position is the location of your left
hand — in particular, the position and placement of the fingers of your left hand.
The following list contains tips for positioning your left hand and fingers:
 Keep your fingers over the appropriate frets the entire time you’re
playing. Because you’re in second position for this scale, keep your first
finger over the second fret, your second finger over the third fret, your
third finger over the fourth fret, and your fourth finger over the fifth fret
at all times — even if they’re not fretting any notes at the moment.
 Keep all your fingers close to the fretboard, ready to play. At first, your
fingers may exhibit a tendency to straighten out and rise away from the
fretboard. This tendency is natural, so work to keep them curled and to
hold them down over the frets where they belong for the position.
 Relax! Although you may think that you need to intensely focus all your
energy on performing this maneuver correctly or positioning that finger
just so, you don’t. What you’re actually working toward is simply adopt-
ing the most natural and relaxed approach to playing the guitar. (You may
not think it all that natural right now, but eventually, you’ll catch the drift.
Honest!) So take things easy, but remain aware of your movements. Is
your left shoulder, for example, riding up like Quasimodo’s? Check it peri-
odically to make sure that it stays tension-free. And remember to take fre-
quent deep breaths, especially if you feel yourself tightening up.
Look at Figure 7-1 and notice that the score indicates left-hand fingerings
under the tab numbers. These indicators aren’t essential because the posi-
tion itself dictates these fingerings. But if you want, you can read the finger
numbers (instead of the tab numbers) and play the C scale that way (keeping
an eye on the tab staff to check which string you’re on). Then, if you memo-
rize the fingerings, you have a movable pattern that enables you to play a
major scale in any key.

Chapter 7: Playing Melodies in Position and in Double-Stops

Play the one-octave scale (one having a range of only eight notes) shown in
Figure 7-1 by using both up- and downstrokes — that is, by using alternate
(up and down) picking. Try it descending as well (you should practice all
scales ascending and descending). (See Chapter 5 for more information on
alternate picking.) This scale is not on the CD; you already know how it
sounds — it’s the familiar do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do.
Figure 7-2 shows a two-octave C-major scale (one with a range of 15 notes) in
the seventh position. Notice that this scale requires you to play on all six
strings. 
To help you remember to hold your fingers over the appropriate frets all the
time, even if they’re not playing at the moment, and keep your fingers close
to the fretboard, we have a twist on an old expression: Keep your friends
close, your enemies closer, and your frets even closer than that.
Practice playing the scale shown in Figure 7-2 up and down the neck, using
alternate picking (see Chapter 5). If you memorize the fingering pattern (shown
under the tab numbers), you can play any major scale simply by moving your
hand up or down to a different position. Try it. And then challenge the nearest
piano player to a transposing (key-changing) contest using the major scale.
Play scales slowly at first to ensure that your notes sound clean and smooth;
then gradually increase your speed.
Shifting positions
Music isn’t so simple that you can play it all in one position, and life would 
be pretty static if you could. In real-world situations, you must often play an
uninterrupted passage that takes you through different positions. To do so
successfully, you need to master the position shift with the aplomb of an old
politician.

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

Andrés Segovia, legend of the classical guitar, devised fingerings for all 12
major and minor scales. (See Chapter 19 for more information on Segovia.)
Figure 7-3 shows how Segovia played the two-octave C-major scale. It differs
from the two scales in the preceding section in that it requires a position shift
in the middle of the scale.
Play the first seven notes in second position and then shift up to fifth posi-
tion by smoothly gliding your first finger up to the fifth fret (3rd string). As
you play the scale downward, play the first eight notes in fifth position, and
then shift to second position by smoothly gliding your third finger down to
the fourth fret (3rd string). The important thing is that the position shift
sound seamless.
Someone listening shouldn’t be able to tell that you shift positions. The trick
is in the smooth gliding of the first (while ascending) or third (while descend-
ing) finger.
You must practice this smooth glide to make it sound uninterrupted and
seamless. Isolate just the two notes involved (3rd string, fourth fret, and 3rd
string, fifth fret) and play them over and over as shown in the scale until you
can make them sound as if you’re making no position shift at all.
Building strength and dexterity 
by playing in position
Some people do all sorts of exercises to develop their position playing. They
buy books that contain nothing but position-playing exercises. Some of these
books aim to develop sight-reading skills, and others aim to develop left-hand
finger strength and dexterity. But you don’t really need such books. You can
make up your own exercises to build finger strength and dexterity. (And
sight-reading doesn’t concern you now anyway, because you’re reading tab
numbers.)

Chapter 7: Playing Melodies in Position and in Double-Stops

To create your own exercises, just take the two-octave major scale shown back
in Figure 7-2 and number the 15 notes of the scale as 1 through 15. Then make
up a few simple mathematical combinations that you can practice playing.
Following are some examples:
 1-2-3-1, 2-3-4-2, 3-4-5-3, 4-5-6-4, and so on. (See Figure 7-4a.)
 1-3-2-4, 3-5-4-6, 5-7-6-8, 7-9-8-10, and so on. (See Figure 7-4b.)
 15-14-13, 14-13-12, 13-12-11, 12-11-10, and so on. (See Figure 7-4c.) 
Figure 7-4 shows how these numbers look in music and tab. Remember, these
notes are just suggested patterns to memorize and help build dexterity.

You get the idea. You can make up literally hundreds of permutations and
practice them endlessly — or until you get bored. Piano students have a book
called Hanon that contains lots of scale permutations to help develop
strength and independence of the fingers. You can check out that book for
permutation ideas, but making up your own is probably just as easy.
Double-Stops
The term double-stop doesn’t refer to going back to the store because you forgot
milk. Double-stop is guitar lingo for playing two notes at once — something
the guitar can do with relative ease but that’s impossible on woodwinds and
only marginally successful on bowed string instruments. (Actually, guitarists
lifted the term from violin playing but quickly made double-stops truly their
own.) By the way, you do nothing special in fretting the notes of a double-
stop. Fret them the same way that you do chords or single notes.
You experience the guitar’s capability to play more than one note simultane-
ously as you strum a chord, but you can also play more than one note in a
melodic context. Playing double-stops is a great way to play in harmony with
yourself. So adept is the guitar at playing double-stops, in fact, that some
musical forms — such as ’50s rock ’n’ roll, country, and Mariachi music (you
know, the music that Mexican street bands play) — use double-stops as a
hallmark of their styles.
Understanding double-stops
A double-stop is nothing more than two notes that you play at the same time.
It falls somewhere between a single note (one note) and a chord (three or
more notes). You can play a double-stop on adjacent strings or on nonadja-
cent strings (by skipping strings). The examples and songs that you find in
this chapter, however, involve only adjacent-string double-stops, because
they’re the easiest to play.
If you play a melody in double-stops, it sounds sweeter and richer, fuller and
prettier than if you play it by using only single notes. And if you play a riff in
double-stops, it sounds gutsier and fuller — the double-stops just create a
bigger sound. Check out some Chuck Berry riffs — “Johnny B. Goode,” for
example — and you can hear that he uses double-stops all the time.
Playing exercises in double-stops
There are two general ways to play double-stops: You can play double-stop pas-
sages using only one pair of strings (the first two strings, for example) — moving
the double-stops up and down the neck — or in one area of the neck by using
95
Chapter 7: Playing Melodies in Position and in Double-Stops

different string pairs and moving the double-stops across the neck (first play-
ing the 5th and 4th strings, for example, and then the 4th and 3rd, and so on).
Playing double-stops up and down the neck
Start with a C-major scale that you play in double-stop thirds (notes that are
two letter names apart, such as C-E, D-F, and so on), exclusively on the first
two strings, moving up the neck. This type of double-stop pattern appears in
Figure 7-5. The left-hand fingering doesn’t appear below the tab numbers in
this score, but that’s not difficult to figure out. Start with your first finger for
the first double-stop. (You need only one finger to fret this first double-stop
because the 1st string remains open.) Then, for all the other double-stops in
the scale, use fingers 1 and 3 if the notes are two frets apart (the second and
third double-stops, for example) and use fingers 1 and 2 if the notes are one
fret apart (the fourth and fifth double-stops, for example). With your right
hand, strike only the 1st and 2nd strings.
Playing double-stops across the neck
Playing double-stops across the neck is probably more common than playing
up and down the neck on a string pair. Figure 7-6 shows a C-major scale that
you play in thirds in open position, moving across the neck.

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

What’s especially common in rock and blues songs is playing double-stops
across the neck where the two notes that make up the double-stop are on the
same fret (which you play as a two-string barre). Check out Chapters 10 and 11
for more information on rock and blues.
Again, the example in Figure 7-6 doesn’t show the fingerings for each double-
stop. But you can use fingers 1 and 2 if the notes are one fret apart and fingers
1 and 3 if the notes are two frets apart.
To hear double-stops in action, listen to the opening of Jimmy Buffett’s
“Margaritaville,” Leo Kottke’s version of the Allman Brothers’ “Little Martha,”
Van Morrison’s “Brown-Eyed Girl,” Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode,” and the
intros to Simon and Garfunkel’s “Homeward Bound” and “Bookends.”
Playing Songs in Position 
and in Double-Stops
Certain keys fall comfortably into certain positions on the guitar. Songs are
based in keys, so if you play a song in a particular key, the song will also fall
comfortably into a certain position. You can see the importance of position
playing in crystal clarity in the various chapters in Part IV of this book. Rock,
jazz, blues, and country lead playing all demand certain positions in order to
render an authentic sound.
Telling you that the melody of a song sounds best if you play it in one posi-
tion rather than another may seem a bit arbitrary to you. But trust us on this
one — playing a Chuck Berry lick in A is almost impossible in anything but
fifth position. Country licks that you play in A, on the other hand, fall most
comfortably in second position, and trying to play them anywhere else is just
making things hard on yourself.
That’s one of the great things about the guitar: The best position for a certain
style not only sounds best to your ears, but also feels best to your hands.
And that’s what makes playing the guitar so much fun.
Play these songs by reading the tab numbers and listening to the CD; notice
how cool playing up the neck feels instead of playing way down in open posi-
tion, where those beginners play.
Whenever you’re playing in position, remember to keep your left hand in a
fixed position, perpendicular to the neck, with your first finger at a given fret
and the other fingers following in order, one per fret. Hold the fingers over
the appropriate frets, very close to the fretboard, even if they’re not fretting
notes at the moment.
97
Chapter 7: Playing Melodies in Position and in Double-Stops

Here is some useful information to help you play the songs:
 Simple Gifts. To play this song, you need to know how to play in fourth
position (see the section “Playing in Position,” earlier in this chapter)
and what ’tis and ’twill mean.
This song is in the key of A, making fourth position ideal, because you
find all the notes between the fourth and seventh frets. Because you play
no open strings in this song, memorize the fingering and then try playing
the same melody in other positions and keys. The fingering is the same in
every position, even though the tab numbers change. Go on — try it.
 Turkey in the Straw. To play this song, you need to know how to play in
seventh position (see the section “Playing in Position,” earlier in this
chapter) and what saying “day-day to the wagon tongue” means.
 Aura Lee. To play this song, you need to know how to play double-stops
up and down the neck on the 1st and 2nd strings (see the aptly entitled
section “Playing double-stops up and down the neck,” earlier in this chap-
ter) and how to gyrate your pelvis while raising one side of your upper lip.
You play this arrangement of “Aura Lee” — a song made famous by Elvis
Presley as “Love Me Tender” — exclusively on the first two strings, moving
up and down the neck. In the double-stop scales that you practice in
Figures 7-5 and 7-6, the two notes of the double-stop move up or down
together. In “Aura Lee” the two notes of the double-stop sometimes move
in the same direction and sometimes in opposite directions. Other times,
one of the notes moves up or down while the other remains stationary.
Mixing directions makes an arrangement more interesting. Play and listen
to “Aura Lee” and you see what we mean.
Notice that the left-hand fingerings appear under the tab numbers. If the
same finger plays successive notes, but at different frets, a slanted line
indicates the position shift (as in measures 5, 7, and 9). For your right-
hand picking, use all downstrokes. Remember to repeat the first four bars
(as the repeat signs around them indicate) before continuing to bar 5.
(Check out Appendix A for more information on repeat signs.) And make
the song tender, just as Elvis did. Uh-thank yew verrah much.
 The Streets of Laredo. To play this song, you need to know how to play
double-stops across the neck (see the section “Playing double-stops
across the neck,” earlier in this chapter) and how to sound light-hearted
while playing a song about a conversation with a corpse.
In this arrangement, you play double-stops across the strings, near the
bottom of the neck. The double-stops give the song a sweet, pretty
sound — just the thing for a tête-à-tête between a passerby and a mum-
mified cowboy. The tab doesn’t indicate fingering, but you can use fingers
1 and 2 for double-stops that are one fret apart and 1 and 3 for double-
stops that are two frets apart. For right-hand picking, use all downstrokes.

Stretching Out: Barre Chords
In This Chapter
 Playing barre chords based on E
 Playing barre chords based on A
 Playing power chords
 Playing songs with barre chords and power chords
I
n this chapter, we show you how to play chords that you can move all
around the neck. Unlike open-position chords, which can be played only in
one place, movable chords can be played at any fret. In most of these movable
chords, you play what’s called a barre (pronounced “bar”).
As you play a barre, one of your left-hand fingers (usually the index) presses
down all or most of the strings at a certain fret, enabling the remaining fin-
gers to play a chord form immediately above (toward the body of the guitar)
the barre finger. Think of your barre finger as a sort of movable nut or capo
and your remaining fingers as playing certain open-position chord forms
directly above it. (See Chapter 12 if you’re not sure how a capo works.) A
movable barre chord contains no open strings — only fretted notes. You can
slide these fretted notes up or down the neck to different positions to pro-
duce other chords of the same quality. 
Movable barre chords are either E-based, getting their names from the notes
that you play on the 6th (low E) string, or A-based, getting their names from
the notes that you play on the 5th (A) string. We cover both of these types of
chords in this chapter. We also give you a quick lesson on power chords.
Playing Major Barre Chords Based on E
One of the most useful movable barre chords is the one based on the open E
chord. (See Chapter 4 if you’re not sure how to finger an open E chord.) The
best way to get a grip on this barre chord is to start out with an open-position
E chord. Follow these steps (as shown in Figure 8-1):

1. Play an open E chord, but instead of using the normal 2-3-1 left-hand
fingering, use fingers 3-4-2.
This fingering leaves your first (index) finger free, hovering above the
strings.
2. Lay your first finger down across all six strings on the other side of
the nut (the side toward the tuning pegs).
Placing your index finger across the strings at this location doesn’t
affect the sound of the chord because the strings don’t vibrate on that
side of the nut. Extending your first finger across the width of the
strings, however, helps you get the “feel” of a barre chord position. Don’t
press too hard with any of your fingers, because you’re going to move
the chord.
3. Take the entire left-hand shape from Step 2 and slide it up (toward the
body of the guitar) one fret so that your first finger is barring the first
fret and your E-chord fingers have all advanced up a fret as well.
You’re now in an F-chord position (because F is one fret higher than E),
and you can press down across all the strings with your index finger.
4. Try playing the notes of the chord one string at a time (from the 6th
string to the 1st) to see whether all the notes ring out clearly.
The first few times you try this chord, the chances are pretty good that
some of the notes aren’t going to ring clearly and that your left-hand fin-
gers are going to hurt.
You can use this “sliding up from an open-position chord” technique to form
all the barre chords in this chapter. (But we also provide you with another
approach in later sections.)

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

Having difficulty at first in creating a barre F is normal (discouraging maybe,
but normal). So before you give up on the guitar and take up the sousaphone,
here are some tips to help you nail this vexing chord:
 Make sure that you line up your left-hand thumb on the back of the
guitar neck under the spot between your first and second fingers. This
position gives you maximum leverage while exerting pressure.
 Instead of holding your first finger totally flat, rotate it a little onto its side.
 Move the elbow of your left arm in close to your body, even to the point
that it’s touching your body at the waist. As you play open-position
chords, you find that you usually hold your elbow slightly away from
your body. Not so with full barre chords.
 If you hear muffled strings, check to see that your left-hand fingers are
touching only the appropriate strings and not preventing adjacent ones
from ringing. Try exerting more pressure with the fingers and make sure
to play on the very tips for extra clearance. Calluses and experience
help you get a clear sound from a barre chord.
You need to exert more pressure to fret at the bottom of the neck (at the first
fret) than you do at, say, the fifth fret. Try moving your F chord up and down
the neck to different frets on the guitar to prove to yourself that playing the
chord gets easier as you move up the neck. Remember that the essence of
this chord form is that it’s movable. Unlike what your elementary school
teachers may have told you, don’t sit so still! Move around already!
Playing barre chords on an electric guitar is easier than playing them on an
acoustic guitar. The string gauges (the thickness of the strings) are lighter on
an electric guitar and the action (distance of the strings to the fretboard) is
lower than on an acoustic. If you’re using an acoustic and you’re having trou-
ble with barre chords, try playing them on an electric (but not one of those
el-cheapo ones from the pawn shop) and take note of the difference. Doing so
may inspire you to keep at it.
Finding the right fret
Because you can play an F chord as a barre chord, you can now, through the
miracle of movable chords, play every major chord — all 12 of them — simply
by moving up the neck. To determine the name of each chord, you simply have
to know what note name you’re playing on the 6th (low E) string — because
all E-based barre chords get their name from the 6th string (just as the open
E chord does).
105
Chapter 8: Stretching Out: Barre Chords

Remember that each fret is a half step away from each adjacent fret. So if a
first-fret barre chord is F, the second-fret barre chord is F#; the third-fret
chord is G; the fourth fret is G#; and so on through to the twelfth fret. Check
out Appendix A for a listing of the names of the notes on the low E string.
After you reach the twelfth fret, the notes — and thus the barre chords that
you play at those frets — repeat: The thirteenth-fret barre chord is the same
as the first (F); the fourteenth is the same as the second (F#); and so on. The
frets work sort of like a clock: 13 equals 1, 14 equals 2, and so on.
Playing progressions using major 
barre chords based on E
A good way to build your comfort and confidence in playing barre chords is
by practicing a progression, which is a series of chords. Listen to the CD to
hear what a four-measure progression using E-based major barre chords
sounds like. Figure 8-2 shows the exercise. Below the staff, you see the cor-
rect first-finger fret for each chord.
Use only barre chords for this exercise (and for all the exercises in this chap-
ter), even if you know how to play these chords as open-position chords. Play
the C chord, for example, by barring at the eighth fret. Then play A at the fifth
fret, G at the third fret, and F at the first fret. Use the F-chord fingering for all
these chords.
Trying to make all six strings ring out clearly on each chord can get a little
tiring. You can give your left-hand fingers a break by releasing pressure as
you slide from one chord to the next. This action of flexing and releasing can
help you develop a little finesse and keep you from tiring so easily. You don’t
need to keep a Vulcan Death Grip on the neck all the time — only while
you’re strumming the chord.

Although you can stop altogether if your hand starts to cramp, try to keep at
it; as with any physical endeavor, you eventually build up your strength and
stamina. Without question, barre chords are the triathlon of guitar playing, so
strap on your best Ironman regalia and feel the burn.
To demonstrate the versatility of barre-chord progressions, here’s an exam-
ple that has a syncopated strum and sounds a little like the music of the
Kinks. In syncopation, you either strike a chord (or note) where you don’t
expect to hear it or fail to strike a chord (or note) where you do expect to
hear it. (The Kinks, in case you don’t recall, were the English proto-punk band
of the ’60s, who gave us such classic hits as “You Really Got Me,” “So Tired,”
and “Lola.”) Figure 8-3 shows you how to play this progression by using
major barre chords. Because the two chords move back and forth so quickly,
the release time (the period during which you can relax your fingers) is very
short. Check out the CD to hear how this exercise should sound before you
get ready to sub for Ray Davies on a world tour.
Playing Minor, Dominant 7th, and 
Minor 7th Barre Chords Based on E
After you’re familiar with the basic feel and movement of the major barre
chords, start adding other chord qualities into your repertoire (which is a
fancy French word for “bag of tricks” that musicians frequently use in dis-
cussing their music).
The good news is that everything you know about moving chords around the
neck — getting a clear, ringing tone out of the individual notes in the chord
(you are practicing, aren’t you?) and the flex-and-release action that you use
in playing major barre chords — carries over to the other forms of barre
chords. Playing a minor, a 7th, or a minor 7th barre form is no more physi-
cally difficult than playing a major barre, so as you practice all the various
barre chords, you should start to notice things getting a little easier.

Chapter 8: Stretching Out: Barre Chords

Minor chords
Forming an E-based minor barre chord is similar to forming a major barre
chord, as we explain in the steps in the section “Playing Major Barre Chords
Based on E,” earlier in this chapter. You can follow that set of steps, starting
with an open Em chord but fingering it with fingers 3-4 (instead of how you
usually finger the chord, as we describe in Chapter 4). Next, lay your first
finger across all the strings on the other side of the nut and then slide the
shape up one fret, producing an Fm chord.
As we state in the “Playing Major Barre Chords Based on E” section earlier in
the chapter, you can use this “sliding up from an open-position chord” tech-
nique to form all the barre chords in this chapter. But you don’t need to go
through all that. The following simple steps describe another way to
approach the Fm barre chord:
1. Play an F major barre chord.
See the section “Playing Major Barre Chords Based on E,” earlier in this
chapter.
2. Remove your second finger from the 3rd string.
The first-finger barre, which is already pressing down all the strings,
now frets the new note on the 3rd string.
That’s all you need to do. You instantly change a major barre chord to a
minor barre chord by removing just one finger. Now, by using the low-E string
chart in Appendix A again as the reference, you can play any of the 12 minor
chords by moving the Fm chord to the appropriate fret. To play an Am barre
chord, for example, you just move the barre to the fifth fret.
If you’re not sure whether you’re playing a barre chord on the correct fret, try
alternating the chord with its open-position form, playing first the barre and
then the open form. Play the two versions in rapid succession several times.
You can then hear whether the two chords are the same or different.
Try playing the simple progression shown in Figure 8-4, which uses both
major and minor barre chords.

The dots above the slashes in bars 2 and 4 of Figure 8-4 are called staccato
marks. They tell you to cut the notes short. (Instead of playing daahh-daahh-
daahh, play di-di-di.) The best way to cut these notes short is to slightly release
your left-hand finger pressure right after you strum the chord. The symbols at
the end of the measures 2 and 4 are called rests. Don’t play during a rest.
Now try playing the progression shown in Figure 8-4 two frets higher than the
figure indicates. This two-fret variation gives you a D-Bm-Gm-A progression.
You’ve just transposed (changed the key of) the progression quickly and
easily — through the magic of movable chords!
Dominant 7th chords
Dominant 7th chords have a sharper, more complex sound than do straight
major chords. (See Chapter 6 for more information on dominant 7ths.)
Switching to a barre dominant 7th chord from a major barre chord, however,
is just as easy as switching from a major to a minor barre chord — you just
lift a single (although different) finger.
To change an F major barre chord into an F7 barre chord, follow these steps:
1. Finger an F major barre chord, as we describe in the section “Playing
Major Barre Chords Based on E,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Remove your fourth finger from the 4th string.
The first-finger barre now frets the chord’s new note.
Try playing the simple progression shown in Figure 8-5 using major and domi-
nant 7th barre chords.
Playing the progression in Figure 8-5 in different keys is as simple as starting
in a different location from the third fret and moving the same distance. From
wherever you start, simply move up two frets for the second chord, up three
more frets for the third chord, and then up two more frets for the fourth and
last chord.

Chapter 8: Stretching Out: Barre Chords

Say the names of the chords you play out loud to help you associate their
names with their locations. Although movable chords make transposing on
the guitar a snap, memorizing just the pattern of the hand movement instead
of the actual chord names you’re playing is far too easy. So say the names of
the chords as you play them. After enough times through, you instinctively
come to know that you play a B7 chord at the seventh fret.
Minor 7th chords
Minor 7th chords have a softer, jazzier, and more complex sound than straight
minor chords do. (Check out Chapter 6 for more information on minor 7th
chords.) You can form a minor 7th E-based barre chord by simply combining
the actions you take to change major to minor and major to dominant 7th.
To change an F major barre chord into an Fm7 barre chord, follow these steps:
1. Play an F major barre chord, as we describe in the section “Playing
Major Barre Chords Based on E,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Remove your second finger from the 3rd string and your fourth finger
from the 4th string.
The first-finger barre, which is already pressing down all the strings,
frets the new notes on the 3rd and 4th strings.
To help you get accustomed to minor 7th barre chords, we put together the
exercise shown in Figure 8-6. Listen to the CD to hear what it sounds like.
You can play this progression in different keys simply by starting from chords
other than G and moving the same relative number of frets to make the next
chord. After the first chord, simply move up four frets for the second chord
and then down two for the third chord; then move down another two for the
last chord. (You can transpose the other progressions in this section in a sim-
ilar manner.)

Say the names of the chords as you play them. Say them out loud. We’re not
kidding. You want to get so sick of hearing your own voice say the names of
these chords at their correct locations that you can never forget that you play
Am7 — the third chord of this progression — at the fifth fret. 
What’s that we hear? It must be the pitter-patter of little reindeer feet. In the
next exercise, as shown in Figure 8-7, you can practice lots of E-based barre
chords all over the neck by playing the chord progression to the song “We
Wish You a Merry Christmas.” To help you out in this exercise, we indicate
the fret number your first finger barres for each chord.
If you’re playing a nylon-string acoustic guitar, you can’t play the Em chord at
the twelfth fret — the body of the guitar gets in the way. (Even on a steel-string
acoustic, this chord is almost unplayable.) Substitute an open-position Em
chord, but play it with fingers 3 and 4 to keep your hand in the barre formation.
In the section “Playing Songs with Barre Chords and Power Chords,” later in this
chapter, you can find another version of this song, with melody and lyrics — but
don’t jump there until after you master your A-based barre chords!
Playing Major Barre Chords Based on A
In the following sections, we introduce another major group of barre chords,
the A-based barre chords. The A-based major barre chord looks like an open A
chord (but with different fingering, which we give you in the following section)

and takes its letter name from the fret on the 5th string at which you place
your first-finger barre.
The theory seems simple enough, but you may find that this chord is a little
more difficult to play than the E-based major barre chord. Don’t worry, how-
ever, because we have a substitute waiting for you that involves only two fin-
gers. But for now, humor us and create the A-based barre chord according to
the directions in the following section.
Fingering the A-based major barre chord
To finger an A-based major barre chord, follow these steps:
1. Finger an open A chord, but instead of using the normal fingering of
1-2-3, use 2-3-4.
This fingering leaves your first (index) finger free and ready to act as the
barre finger. (If you’re not sure how to finger an open A chord, see
Chapter 4.)
2. Lay your first finger down across all six strings, just above the nut 
(the side toward the tuning pegs).
Because you strum only the top five strings for A-based barre chords,
you could lay your finger down across just five strings. But most gui-
tarists cover all six strings with the barre because it feels more comfort-
able and it prevents the open 6th string from accidentally sounding.
Placing your index finger across the strings at this point doesn’t affect
the sound of the chord because the strings don’t vibrate on this side of
the nut. Right now, you’re just getting the feel of the chord position.
Don’t press too hard with any of your fingers because you’re going to
move the chord.
3. Take the entire left-hand shape from Step 2 and slide it up one fret so
that your first finger barres the first fret, producing a B% chord, as
shown in Figure 8-8.
After you finger the B% chord, try playing the notes of the chord one string at
a time (from the 5th string to the 1st) to see whether all the notes ring out
clearly. If you encounter any muffled notes, check to see that your left-hand
fingers are touching only the appropriate strings and aren’t preventing adja-
cent ones from ringing. If the sound is still muted, you need to exert more
pressure with your fingers.

Finding the right fret
Because you can play a B% chord as a barre chord, you can now play all 12 
A-based major barre chords — but only if you know the names of all the notes
on the 5th string. All A-based barre chords get their name from the 5th string
(just as the open A chord does). Check out Appendix A for the names of the
notes on the 5th string.
The notes and frets work sort of like a clock. After you get past 12, they repeat,
so the thirteenth fret is the same as the first (B%); the fourteenth is the same
as the second (B); and so on.
Progressions using A-based 
major barre chords
Before playing any progressions using A-based major barre chords, you need
to know that most guitarists don’t finger them as we describe earlier (refer to
Figure 8-8). Take a look at Figure 8-9 to see another way to finger this chord
(using the B% chord at the first fret as an example). Use your ring finger to
barre the three notes at the third fret.
Figure 8-8:
The barre 
B% chord.
113
Chapter 8: Stretching Out: Barre Chords

The tricky thing about the fingering in Figure 8-9 is that, for the 1st string to
ring, you need to engage in a mean contortion with your third finger, elevat-
ing the middle knuckle out of the way (see photo). Some people can accom-
plish this position and some can’t — it’s kind of like wiggling your ears. The
people who can’t (lift their finger, not wiggle their ears) can use the fingering
shown in Figure 8-10.
If you play the B% barre chord as shown in Figure 8-10 (with the 1st string not
played), make sure that the 1st string doesn’t accidentally sound. To keep the
1st string quiet either avoid striking it with your right hand or mute it
(deaden it by lightly touching it) with the third finger. 
Experiment with all three fingerings and pick the one that feels best for you,
but we bet that you decide on the form shown in Figure 8-10.

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

The exercise shown in Figure 8-11 uses A-based major barre chords and has a
light, early rock sound. You can give your left-hand fingers a break by releasing
pressure as you slide from one chord to the next. Don’t forget that you can
(and should) transpose this progression to other keys by moving the entire
pattern to a new starting point. Do so for all the exercises in this chapter.
Notice, too, the staccato marks in measure 4 (play it di-di-di).
Playing Minor, Dominant 7th, Minor 7th,
and Major 7th Barre Chords Based on A
We admit that the A-based major barre chord is something of an oddball with
respect to left-hand fingering. But all the other A-based forms are much more
logical and comfortable in terms of left-hand fingering.
For the rest of the A-based forms, you don’t encounter any weird hand con-
tortions or new techniques. All you do is pick up a variety of different forms
to enrich your chord vocabulary.
Minor chords
To form an A-based minor barre chord you could follow steps similar to the
ones that we describe in the section “Playing Major Barre Chords Based on A,”
earlier in this chapter: Play an open Am chord by using a 3-4-2 fingering instead
of 2-3-1 (see Chapter 4 if you need help with the open Am chord); lay your first
finger down across all the strings on the other side of the nut; and then slide
the shape up one fret and press down firmly, producing a B%m chord.
But if you want, you can form the B%m chord by skipping the “sliding up from
an open chord” process and just placing your fingers directly on the frets, as
indicated by the first chord diagram in Figure 8-12. Check your strings indi-
vidually to see that they’re clear and buzz-free. (Notice that we’ve gone ahead
and also given you the fingerings for B%7, B%m7, and B%maj7 in Figure 8-12.
More on these in the following sections.)

Chapter 8: Stretching Out: Barre Chords

The progression in Figure 8-13 is typical of a rock, folk, or country song and
uses both major and minor A-based barre chords. Refer to Appendix A if you
need the appropriate fret (on the A string) for each chord.
Dominant 7th chords
Dominant 7th chords sound bluesy and funky compared to major chords.
Refer to Figure 8-12 to see the fingering for the B%7 barre chord (A-based).
Remember that you can “slide up” to this chord from a two-finger, open-
position A7 chord (but only if you use a 3-4 fingering for the A7).
Now, using the A-String chart in Appendix A to find the appropriate fret for
any A-based barre chord, try playing the simple progression shown in Figure
8-14, which uses major, minor, and dominant 7th A-based barre chords.

Minor 7th chords
Minor 7th chords sound soft and jazzy compared to major chords. You can
form the B%m7 chord by “sliding up” from an open-position Am7 chord (using
a 3-2 fingering), or you can refer to the example shown in Figure 8-12 and
place your fingers directly on the frets for the B%m7.
The simple progression that Figure 8-15 shows uses A-based minor 7th
chords exclusively. If you need to, use Appendix A to find the appropriate fret
for each chord.
Major 7th chords
Major 7th chords have a bright and jazzy sound compared to major chords.
(You may notice that, in the section on E-based barre chords earlier in this
chapter, we don’t include the major 7th chord. That’s because you don’t play
such chords in a barre form.)
You can form the B%maj7 chord by “sliding up” from an open-position Amaj7
chord (using a 3-2-4 fingering), or you can refer to the example shown in
Figure 8-12 and place your fingers directly on the frets for the barre chord, as
the figure shows you.
The simple progression shown in Figure 8-16 uses A-based minor 7th and
major 7th barre chords. Use Appendix A to find the appropriate fret for each
chord, if necessary.

Chapter 8: Stretching Out: Barre Chords

The exercise shown in Figure 8-17 uses the chord progression for the song
“We Wish You a Merry Christmas.” Play this progression by using only A-
based barre chords. To help you out in this exercise, we indicate at which 
fret to place your first-finger barres for each chord. You may notice that the
chords are different from those in the other “We Wish You a Merry Christmas”
example (refer to Figure 8-7), but that’s only because we use a different start-
ing chord here.
If you’re playing a nylon-string acoustic guitar, you’re going to have trouble
playing the Am chord at the twelfth fret — the body of the guitar gets in the
way. (And playing the chord’s no picnic on a steel-string acoustic either.)
Substitute an open-position Am chord but use a 3-4-2 fingering to keep your
hand in the barre position.
You may notice, in playing the exercises in this chapter — and especially in
the “We Wish You a Merry Christmas” exercises — that your left hand leaps
around in sudden, jerky movements. That’s because you’re playing all the
required chords by using only one chord form — either the E-based form or
the A-based form. If you combine forms, you base your chord selection on
economy of movement. The F and B% chords are five frets away from each
other if you use the same barre form, but they’re at the same fret (the first) if
you use the E-based form of F and the A-based form of B%. Playing songs actu-
ally gets easier as you add additional chords to your arsenal.

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

To see how much easier playing “We Wish You a Merry Christmas” is if you
use both A-based barre chords and E-based barre chords together, check it
out in the section “Playing Songs with Barre Chords and Power Chords,” later
in this chapter.
Wailing on Power Chords
A power chord — not to be confused with a power cord (the cable that pro-
vides electricity to your motorized shoe buffer) — is usually nothing more
than the lowest two or three notes of a regular open-position or barre chord.
Guitarists often use power chords in rock music to create a low sound. Power
chords are easier to play than are their full-version counterparts and don’t
contain a major or minor quality to them, so they can stand in for either type
of chord. Plus they’re loads of fun to play!
Fingering power chords
A power chord consists of only two different notes that are always five steps
apart, such as A–E or C–G. (Count letter names on your fingers to confirm
that A to E and C to G are five steps apart.) But the actual chord that you play
may involve more than two strings, because you may be doubling each of the
notes that makes up the power chord — that is, playing the same notes in dif-
ferent octaves (and on different strings).
As do most other chords, power chords come in two varieties: 
 Open-position: We show you the most common open-position power
chords — E5, A5, and D5 — in Figure 8-18. These chords are merely the
two or three lowest notes of the simple open-position E, A, and D chords
that we describe in Chapter 4.
 Movable: Movable power chords are simply the two or three lowest notes
of the movable barre chords that we describe in the preceding sections of
this chapter. As is the case with movable barre chords, movable power
chords are either E-based, getting their names from the notes that you play
on the 6th (low E) string, or A-based, getting their names from the notes
that you play on the 5th (A) string. Figure 8-19 shows the F5 and B%5 power
chords that you play at the first fret, but you can move these chords to any
fret, determining their names from the charts in Appendix A on the low-E
string and A string. Or, better yet, you can determine the power-chord
names by memorizing the names of the notes on the 6th and 5th strings —
and then you don’t need to resort to the Appendix at all! (Hint, hint.)
Chapter 8: Stretching Out: Barre Chords 119

For the most part, the two- and three-string power chords are interchange-
able. For some situations, such as in playing the Chuck Berry–style figures
that we present in Chapter 10, the two-string version is preferable.

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

How you use power chords
In straight-ahead rock music (and even in some pop music), guitarists often
substitute power chords for full chords to give the accompaniment (specifi-
cally, the rhythm guitar part) a sparser, leaner sound than what you can get
with full chords. This course is sometimes taken to enable the vocal part to
stand out more from the music. You can hear this kind of power chord sound
in old songs such as “Johnny B. Goode” and “Peggy Sue.” The progression
shown in Figure 8-20 illustrates the power chords that you use to produce
this kind of sound. Play this progression by using either two- or three-string
power chords.

Chapter 8: Stretching Out: Barre Chords

The > symbol is called an accent. It tells you to play the accented notes a
little louder than the other notes — to accentuate them. Sometimes accents
form a rhythmic pattern that gives a song a certain flavor, such as a Latin
flavor, a Bo Diddley flavor, a polka flavor, or even a tutti-frutti flavor.
In hard-rock and heavy-metal music, guitarists often like to use a heavy or
ominous sound in their chords. They achieve this mood by playing low notes
with distortion — a fuzzy-sounding signal that results if the signal is too pow-
erful for the amp’s circuitry and speakers to handle effectively.
Hard-rock and heavy-metal guitarists love to play power chords instead of full
chords right off the bat, because power chords sound lower (mainly because
they don’t include the higher strings). In addition, the distorted tone really
limits them to power chords, because full chords (chords with more than two
different notes in them) can sound like mud with heavy distortion.
The progression shown in Figure 8-21 illustrates a typical heavy-metal riff
using both movable and open-position power chords. If you have an electric
guitar and an amp or effect device that enables you to overdrive it (see
Chapter 15), use distortion while practicing this progression, as you hear on
the CD. You can use either the two- or three-string version of the power
chords, but the two-string version is what you hear on the CD.

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

To play a song with power chords right away, check out “Power Play” in the
following section, “Playing Songs with Barre Chords and Power Chords.”
Playing Songs with Barre 
Chords and Power Chords
Now the fun begins. You revisit a song that you may have already played at
some point (refer to Figures 8-7 and 8-17, earlier in this chapter), but in this
section, we show you how playing a song is easier if you combine different
chord forms.
Here is some useful information about the songs to help you along:
 We Wish You a Merry Christmas. To play “We Wish You a Merry Christ-
mas,” you need to know how to play E-based barre chords (see the sec-
tions “Playing Major Barre Chords Based on E” and “Playing Minor, Domi-
nant 7th, and Minor 7th Barre Chords Based on E,” earlier in this chapter);
how to play A-based barre chords (see the sections “Playing Major Barre
Chords Based on A” and “Playing Minor, Dominant 7th, Minor 7th, and
Major 7th Barre Chords Based on A,” earlier in this chapter); and how to
play guitar dressed in a stuffy costume with a pillow strapped to your belly.
Chord progressions for this song appear twice in exercises in this chap-
ter, first in the exercise in Figure 8-7, as practice for E-based barre
chords, and then again in the exercise for Figure 8-17, as practice for A-
based barre chords. In each of those exercises, your left hand must jump
all over the fingerboard. By combining both kinds of barre chords (E-
based and A-based), you can play this song with much less left-hand
movement. Minimizing left-hand movement enables you to play both
faster and more smoothly as well as to achieve better voice leading, or
smoothness of motion between the individual notes of the changing
chords. (Good voice leading produces a pleasing sound.)
 Power Play. To play “Power Play” you need to know how to finger and
play the A5, G5, and D5 power chords (see the section “Fingering power
chords,” a bit earlier in this chapter) and how to crank your amp up to 11
(à la Spinal Tap).
This “song” is a four-bar rock progression using only power chords. Count-
less rock songs use this progression, including the classic “Takin’ Care of
Business,” by Bachman-Turner Overdrive (known as BTO to their friends).
Remember that power chords are well-suited to a heavier, distorted
sound, and you can use them in place of full versions of chords because
they usually contain the same bottom two or three notes. So if you’re
feeling a bit rebellious, a bit wicked, crank up your amp and play “We
Wish You a Merry Christmas” with power chords, a distorted sound, and
a really bad attitude.

Special Articulation:
Making the Guitar Talk
In This Chapter
 Playing hammer-ons
 Playing pull-offs

 Playing vibratos
 Muting
 Playing in an integrated style
A
rticulation refers to how you play and connect notes on the guitar. Look
at it this way: If pitches and rhythms are what you play, articulation is
how you play. Articulation gives your music expression and enables you to
make your guitar talk, sing, and even cry. From a technical standpoint, such
articulation techniques as hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, and bends enable you
to connect notes together smoothly, giving your playing a little “grease” (a
good thing, especially in playing the blues). Vibratos add life to sustained (or
held) notes that otherwise just sit there like a dead turtle, and muting shapes
the sound of individual notes, giving them a tight, clipped sound.
As you start to incorporate articulation in your playing, you begin to exercise
more control over your guitar. You’re not merely playing “correctly” — you’re
playing with individual style.
This chapter shows you how to play all the articulation techniques you need
to get your guitar talking. After we explain each technique, we present some
idiomatic licks (musical phrases that naturally suit a particular technique or
style) so that you can play the technique in context.

Getting the Hang of Hammer-Ons
A hammer-on doesn’t refer to playing the guitar while wearing a tool belt; a
hammer-on is a left-hand technique that enables you to play two consecutive
ascending notes by picking only the first note. The hammer-on derives its
name from the action of your left-hand finger, which acts like a hammer strik-
ing the fretboard, causing the note of that fret to sound out. This technique
makes the connection between the notes sound smooth — far smoother than
if you simply pick each note separately.
In the tab (and standard) notation in this book, the letter H with a slur (a
curved line) indicates a hammer-on. (The slur connects the first fret number,
or note, of the hammer-on with the last, and the H appears centered over the
slur. If two Hs appear over the slur, the hammer-on involves three notes.)
Playing a hammer-on
An open-string hammer-on (or just hammer, for short) is the easiest kind to
play. Following are the steps for the open-string hammer-on, as shown in
Figure 9-1a:
1. Pick the open G string (the 3rd string) as you normally do.
2. While the open string is still ringing, use a finger of your left hand
(say, the first finger) to quickly and firmly strike (or slam or smack, as
you prefer) the second fret of the same string.
If you bring your finger down with enough force, you hear the new note
(the second fret A) ringing. Normally, your left hand doesn’t strike a fret;
it merely presses down on it. But to produce an audible sound without
picking, you must hit the string pretty hard, as though your finger’s a
little hammer coming down on the fretboard.
Figure 9-1b shows a hammer-on from a fretted note on the 3rd string. Use
your first finger to fret the first note at the fourth fret and strike the string;
then, while that note’s still ringing, use your second finger to hammer down
on the fifth fret.
Double hammer-on
Figure 9-1c shows a double hammer-on on the 3rd string. Play the open string
and hammer the second fret with your first finger; then, while that note’s still
ringing, hammer the string again (at the fourth fret) with your third finger,
producing a super-smooth connection between all three notes. 
128
Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

Don’t rush the notes together; rushing is a tendency as you first work with
hammer-ons.
Figure 9-1d shows a double hammer-on on the same string using three fretted
notes. This type of hammer-on is the most difficult to play and requires some
practice. Play the note at the fourth fret, fretting with your first finger;
hammer-on the fifth-fret note with your second finger; then hammer the sev-
enth-fret-note with your fourth finger.
Double-stop hammer-on
You can also play hammer-ons as double-stops. The most common double-stop
hammer-ons — and the ones that are the easiest to play — are the ones where
both double-stop notes lie on the same fret, enabling you to barre them (play
them with one finger). (See Chapter 7 for more information on double-stops.)
Figure 9-2a shows a double-stop hammer-on from open strings (the 2nd and
3rd). After striking the two open strings with the pick, and while the open
strings are still ringing, slam down your first finger at the second-fret, across
both strings at the same time.
Next, try a double-stop hammer-on from the second fret to the fourth fret, also
on the 2nd and 3rd strings, as shown in Figure 9-2b. Use your first finger to
barre the second fret and your third finger to barre the fourth fret. Now, to get
really fancy, try a double double-stop hammer-on, on the same strings, as shown
in Figure 9-2c. Start with the open strings; hammer the second-fret barre with
your first finger; then hammer the fourth-fret barre with your third finger.
Hammer-on from nowhere
Figure 9-3 shows what we call a “hammer-on from nowhere.” It’s not a typical
hammer-on in that the hammered note doesn’t follow an already-ringing
lower note. In fact, the hammered note is on an entirely different string than
the previous note. Sound the hammered note by fretting it very hard (ham-
mering it) with a left-hand finger — hard enough that the note rings out with-
out your striking it with the pick.

Why would you even use this type of hammer-on? Sometimes, in fast pas-
sages, your right-hand picking pattern just doesn’t give you time for that one
extra pick attack when you need it. But you can sound the note anyway by
fretting it hard enough with a finger of the left hand — hammering it from
nowhere.
Getting idiomatic with hammer-ons
In Figures 9-4 through 9-7, you see some idiomatic licks using hammer-ons.
(The little numbers next to the noteheads in the standard notation indicate
left-hand fingerings.) The lick in Figure 9-4 uses single-note hammer-ons from
open strings. You may hear this kind of lick in a rock, blues, or country song.
Try it out for a bit more practice with hammer-ons.
Another cool trick is to strum a chord while hammering one of the notes.
Figure 9-5 shows this technique — which James Taylor often employs — in
the context of a musical phrase.

Chapter 9: Special Articulation: Making the Guitar Talk

Keep your first finger barring the fifth fret for this lick as you play it. You get a
smoother sound, and you find that it’s easier to play, too.
Figure 9-7 combines a double-stop hammer-on with a hammer-on from
nowhere in fifth position. (See Chapter 7 for more information on playing in
position.) Try picking that last note, and you can easily see that the hammer-
on from nowhere feels more comfortable than the picked version of the note.
Getting Playful with Pull-Offs
A pull-off is another technique that enables you to connect notes more
smoothly. It enables you to play two consecutive descending notes by picking
only once with the right hand and, as the first note rings, pulling your finger
off that fret. As you pull your finger off one fret, the next lower fretted (or
open) note on the string then rings out instead of the first note. You can sort
of think of a pull-off as the opposite of a hammer-on, but that particular con-
trast doesn’t really tell the whole story. A pull-off also requires that you exert
a slight sideways pull on the string where you’re fretting the picked note and
then release the string from your finger in a snap as you pull your finger off
the fret — something like what you do in launching a tiddly-wink.
The tab (and standard) notation in this book indicates a pull-off by showing
the letter P centered over a slur (short curved line) connecting the two tab
numbers (or notes).
Playing pull-offs
A pull-off (or pull, for short) to an open string is the easiest kind to play.
Following are the steps for the open-string pull-off shown in Figure 9-8a:

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

1. Press down the 3rd string at the second fret with your first or second
finger (whichever is more comfortable) and pick the note normally
with your right hand.
2. While the note is still ringing, pull your finger off the string in a side-
ways motion (toward the 2nd string) in a way that causes the open
3rd string to ring — almost as if you’re making a left-hand finger
pluck.
If you’re playing up to speed, you can’t truly pluck the string as you
remove your finger — you’re half lifting and half plucking . . . or some-
where in between. Experiment to find the left-hand finger motion that
works best for you.
Figure 9-8b shows a pull-off involving only fretted notes. The crucial factor in
playing this kind of pull-off is that you must finger both pull-off notes ahead of
time. We put that last part in italics because it’s so important. This require-
ment is one of the big differences between a hammer-on and a pull-off. You
must anticipate, or set up, a pull-off in advance. Following are the steps for
playing the fretted pull-off shown in Figure 9-8b:
1. Press down both the second fret of the 3rd string with your first finger
and the fourth fret of the 3rd string with your third finger at the same
time.
2. Strike the 3rd string with the pick and, while the fourth-fret note is
still ringing, pull your third finger off the fourth fret (in a half pluck,
half lift) to sound the note of the second fret (which you’re already
fingering).
Try to avoid accidentally striking the 2nd string as you pull off. Also, you
can see that if you aren’t already pressing down that second-fret note,
you end up pulling off to the open string instead of the second fret!
Double pull-off
Figure 9-8c shows a double pull-off to the open 3rd string. Start by simultane-
ously fretting the first two notes (with your first and third fingers). Pick the
string and then pull off with your third finger to sound the note at the second
fret; then pull off with your first finger to sound the open string. (Notice that
two Ps appear over the slur connecting the three notes; these indicate
that you’re pulling off two notes and not just one.)
Figure 9-8d shows a double pull-off on the 3rd string using only fretted notes.
Start with all three notes fretted (using your first, second, and fourth fingers).
Pick the string and then pull off with your fourth finger to sound the fifth-fret
note; then pull off with your second finger to sound the fourth-fret note.
133
Chapter 9: Special Articulation: Making the Guitar Talk

Double-stop pull-off
You can also play pull-offs as double-stops. As is true with hammer-ons, the
double-stop pull-offs that are the most common and are the easiest to play
are those where both double-stop notes lie on the same fret, enabling you to
barre them. (See Chapter 7 for more information on double-stops.)
Figure 9-9a shows a double-stop pull-off to open strings on the 2nd and 3rd
strings. After striking the notes at the second fret, and while the strings are
still ringing, pull off your first finger (in a half pluck, half lift) from both
strings at the same time (in one motion) to sound the open strings.
Next, try a double-stop pull-off from the fourth fret to the second fret, as shown
in Figure 9-9b. Place your first finger at the second fret, barring the 2nd and 3rd
strings, and place your third finger at the fourth fret (also barring the 2nd and
3rd strings) at the same time. Pick the strings and then pull your third finger off
the fourth fret to sound the notes at the second fret of both strings.
Now try a double double-stop pull-off, on the same strings, as shown in Figure
9-9c. This type of pull-off is similar to what you play in the example shown in
Figure 9-9b except that, after the notes on the second fret sound, you pull
your first finger off the second fret to sound the open strings.

Getting idiomatic with pull-offs
In Figures 9-10 and 9-11, you see two idiomatic licks using pull-offs. Figure
9-10 involves single-note pull-offs to open strings. You can hear this kind of
lick in many rock and blues songs.
Figure 9-5, in the section “Getting idiomatic with hammer-ons,” earlier in this
chapter, shows you how to strum a chord while hammering on a note of that
chord. Figure 9-11 shows the opposite technique: strumming a chord while
pulling off one note. The passage in this figure leads off with two single-note
pull-offs, just to get you warmed up.
Getting Slippery with Slides
A slide is an articulation technique in which you play a note and then move
your left-hand finger along the string to a different fret. This technique
enables you to connect two or more notes smoothly and quickly. It also
enables you to change positions on the fretboard seamlessly.

Chapter 9: Special Articulation: Making the Guitar Talk

Many different types of slides are possible. The most basic are as the follow-
ing list describes:
 Slides between two notes where you pick only the first note.
 Slides between two notes where you pick both notes.
 Slides from an indefinite pitch a few frets above or below the target note.
(The pitch is indefinite because you begin the slide with very little finger
pressure, gradually increasing it until you land on the target fret.)
 Slides to an indefinite pitch a few frets above or below the starting note.
(The pitch is indefinite because you gradually release finger pressure as
you move away from the starting fret.)
 Slides into home plate.
In the tablature (and standard) notation, we indicate a slide by the letters sl.
centered over a slanted line.
Playing slides
The name of this technique, slide, gives you a pretty good clue about how to
play it. You slide a left-hand finger up or down a string, maintaining contact
with it, to arrive at a new note. Sometimes, you connect two notes (for exam-
ple, you slide from the seventh fret to the ninth), and sometimes you connect
a note (at a given fret) with an indefinite pitch (you produce indefinite pitches
by picking a string while you gradually add or release finger pressure as
you’re sliding).
Connecting two notes
Figure 9-12a shows a slur (curved line) along with the slanted line. The slur
indicates that this is a legato slide, which means that you don’t pick the second
note. Play the first note at the ninth fret normally, holding the note for one beat.
At beat 2, while the string is still ringing, quickly slide your left-hand finger to
the twelfth fret, keeping full finger pressure the whole time. This action causes
the note at the twelfth fret to sound without you picking it.
In Figure 9-12b, which notates a slide without a slur, you do pick the second
note. Play and hold the ninth-fret note for a beat; then, at beat two, slide up
to the twelfth fret — maintaining full finger pressure as you go — and strike
the string with the pick just as you arrive at the twelfth fret.
If you play the slide in Figure 9-12b slowly enough, you produce what’s known
as a glissando. A glissando is an effect that you hear on harps, pianos, and
guitars, wherein all the notes between the two principal notes sound.
136
Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

Working with indefinite pitch
What we call an “ascending immediate slide” is a quick slide, not in rhythm,
that serves to decorate only one note and isn’t something that you use to
connect two different notes. In the example shown in Figure 9-13a, you slide
into the ninth fret from a few frets below. Follow these steps:
1. Start the slide from about three frets below the target fret (the sixth
fret if the ninth fret is your target), using minimal finger pressure.
2. As your finger slides up, gradually increase your finger pressure so
that, as you arrive at the target fret, you exert full pressure.
3. Strike the string with the pick while your left-hand finger is in motion,
somewhere between the starting and target frets (the sixth and ninth
frets, in this example). 
The slide shown in Figure 9-13b is what we call a “descending immediate
slide.” This kind of slide usually occurs after you hold a note for a while. It
gives a long note a fancy ending. Follow these steps:
1. Pick the note that the tab indicates (the one on the twelfth fret in this
case) in the normal manner.
2. After letting the note ring for the indicated duration, slide your left-
hand finger down the string, gradually releasing finger pressure as
you go, to cause a fading-away effect.
After a few frets, you should lift your finger completely off the string —
unless you want to play what’s known as a long slide. In that case, you
can slide your finger all the way down the neck, releasing finger pressure
(and finally removing your finger from the string) toward the end of the
neck, as near to the nut as you want to go.

Playing idiomatic licks using slides
Figures 9-14 and 9-15 show two idiomatic licks using slides. Figure 9-14
shows immediate ascending slides, including a barred double-stop slide.
Use your first finger to play the barred double-stop at the fifth fret, sliding
into it from only one or two frets below. This lick has a Chuck Berry sound
to it.
Figure 9-15 (which also contains a hammer-on and a pull-off) shows how
you can use slides to smoothly change positions. (The small numbers in
the standard notation indicate left-hand fingering.) Here you move from
third position to fifth position and back to third position. Notice that the
tab indicates the slides with slurs — so don’t pick the second note of
each slide. And follow the up- and downstroke picking indications on the
tab (4 and 2) — you pick notes only five times, even though you actually
play nine notes!

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

Getting the Bends
More than any other type of articulation, the string bend is what makes your
guitar talk (or sing or cry), giving the instrument almost voicelike expressive
capabilities. Bending is nothing more than using a left-hand finger to push or
pull a string out of its normal alignment, stretching it across the fingerboard
toward the 6th or 1st string. (More later on how to tell in which direction to
stretch the string.)
As you bend a string, you raise its pitch by stretching that string. This rise
in pitch can be slight or great, depending on exactly how far you bend the
string. Between the slightest and greatest bends possible are infinite degrees
of in-between bends. It’s those infinite degrees that make your guitar sing.
The tab notation in this book indicates a bend by using a curved arrow and
either a number or a fraction (or both) at the peak of the arrow. The fraction
1⁄2, for example, means that you bend the string until the pitch is a half step
(the equivalent of one fret) higher than normal. The numeral 1 above a bend
arrow means that you bend the string until the pitch is a whole step (the
equivalent of two frets) higher than normal. You may also see fractions
such as 1⁄4 and 3⁄4 or bigger numbers such 11⁄2 or 2 above a bend arrow. These
fractions or numbers all tell you how many (whole) steps to bend the note.
But 1⁄2 and 1 are the most common bends that you see in most tab notation.
You can check to see that you’re bending in tune by fretting the target note
normally and comparing that to the bent note. If the bend indicates a whole
step (1) on the seventh fret of the 3rd string, for example, play the ninth fret
normally and listen carefully to the pitch. Then try bending the seventh-fret
note to match the ninth-fret pitch in your head.

Chapter 9: Special Articulation: Making the Guitar Talk

Although nearly all publishers of printed guitar music use curved arrows and
numbers to indicate bends in tablature, not all publishers use these indications
on the standard notation staff as well. Some publishers instead show the pitch
of both the unbent and bent notes, with one of them in parentheses or one of
them very small. To avoid confusion, make sure that you establish how each
system treats the issue of bent notes before you start playing that music.
You don’t normally do a lot of string bending on acoustic guitars, because
the strings are too thick. In electric guitar playing, where string bending is an
integral technique, the strings are thinner.
Strings are measured in gauges, with that term referring to the diameter of
the string in millimeters. A light-gauge set of acoustic strings starts with the
diameter for the 1st string at .012 millimeters, which is generally considered
unbendable by all except the most dedicated masochists. (Guitarists refer to
the entire set in shorthand as twelves.) For electric guitars, the most common
gauges start with sets that use a .009 or .010 millimeter gauge for the top string
(“nines” and “tens,” to use the vernacular). You can bend with .011s and .012s
(“elevens” and “twelves”) on your guitar, but doing so isn’t much fun unless
you’re seriously into pain.
Playing bends
Take the photo at Figure 9-16a as a starting point for playing a bend. You play
this bend on the 3rd string with the third finger, which represents a very
common bending situation — probably the most common. Follow these steps:
1. Place your third finger at the seventh fret but support the third finger
by placing the second finger at the sixth fret and the first finger at the
fifth fret, all at the same time (see Figure 9-16a).
The first and second fingers don’t produce any sound, but they add
strength to your bend. Supporting your bends with any other available
fingers is always a good idea.
2. Pick the 3rd string with your right hand.
3. After picking, use all three fingers together to push the string toward
the 6th string, raising the pitch a whole step (to the pitch you nor-
mally get at the ninth fret — see Figure 9-16b).
Pushing your hand into the neck as you execute the bend gives you added
leverage. Also, using light-gauge, or thin, strings on your guitar also makes
bending easier.
140
Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

Figure 9-17 shows what bends look like in standard notation and tab. Figure
9-17a shows what we call an “immediate bend.” Pick the note and then imme-
diately bend it up.
Figure 9-17b is called a bend and release. Pick the note; then bend it (without
repicking), and unbend it (release it without repicking) to its normal position.
Unlike the bend in Figure 9-17a, this bend isn’t immediate; instead, you see it
notated in a specific rhythm (that you can hear on the CD). You can refer to
this type of bend as a bend in rhythm, or a measured bend.
Figure 9-17c shows a prebend and release. You prebend the note, or bend it
before you strike it with the pick. Bend the note as you do in Figure 9-17a but
don’t pick the string until after you bend it. After you pick the note, unbend
(release without repicking) the string to its normal position.

Chapter 9: Special Articulation: Making the Guitar Talk

Most often, as the examples in Figure 9-17 show, you push the string toward
the 6th string (or toward the ceiling). But if you bend notes on the bottom
two strings (the 5th and 6th strings), you pull the string toward the 1st string
(or toward the floor) — otherwise the string slides right off the fretboard.
Getting idiomatic with bends
Figure 9-18 shows a very common bend figure that you can use in rock solo-
ing. Notice the fingering that the standard notation staff indicates to use.
Your left hand hardly moves — it’s locked in fifth position (see Chapter 7 for
more information on positions), with the first finger barring the 1st and 2nd
strings at the fifth fret. The second note of the figure (fifth fret, 2nd string)
happens to be the same pitch (E) as your target bend, so you can use that
second note to test the accuracy of your bend. Soon, you start to feel just
how far you need to bend a string to achieve a whole-step or half-step rise in
pitch. All the bends in this example are immediate bends.
After you play each 3rd-string bend, just before you pick the 2nd-string note,
reduce your finger pressure from the bent note. This action causes the 3rd
string to stop ringing as you pick the 2nd string.
In Figure 9-19, you bend the 2nd string, once as an immediate bend and once as
a bend in rhythm. Listen to the CD to hear how this example sounds. Strictly
speaking, because you’re in twelfth position, you should be using your fourth
finger to play the fifteenth fret. But we indicate for you to use the third finger,
because if you’re up at the twelfth fret, the frets are closer together, so your
third finger can easily make the reach and is stronger than your fourth finger.

You play the examples shown in Figures 9-18 and 9-19 in what lead guitarists
call a “box” pattern — a group of notes in one position that vaguely resembles
the shape of a box. You can use this pattern for improvising lead solos. (For
more information on box patterns and soloing, see Chapters 10 and 11.) Note:
The 8va indication above the standard music notation in Figure 9-19 tells you
to play the notes an octave higher than written.
Figure 9-20 uses a small box pattern in the eighth position. This example fea-
tures a bend and release, in which the bend is immediate and the release is in
rhythm. Listen to the CD to hear this sound.
Although you bend most notes by pushing a string toward the 6th string,
you may sometimes need to bend a string the other way, even on a middle
or upper string (but not on the 1st string because it slides off the neck if you
do). You need to use this type of opposite-direction bend if the note that fol-
lows a bend is on a string that’s adjacent to the bent string. You need to bend
away from the upcoming string; otherwise, your bending finger may acciden-
tally touch it, inadvertently muting it.

Chapter 9: Special Articulation: Making the Guitar Talk

Figure 9-21 shows two first-finger, half-step bends on the 3rd string. The first
one bends toward the 6th string because the following note is on the 2nd
string. (Remember that you’re bending away from the following note.) The
second one, however, bends toward the floor because the following note is
on the adjacent 4th string. Again, you’re bending away from the next note.
You can create an interesting effect by bending a note, letting it ring in its
bent state, striking a note on another string, and then restriking the bent
string and releasing it. Many southern-rock and country-rock guitarists are
fond of this kind of bend. Figure 9-22 shows this “held-bend” technique. In the
notation, the dotted line after the arrow indicates that you hold the bend not
only as you strike the 2nd string, but also as you restrike the 3rd string; the
downward-curved solid line shows the release of the bend. Make sure that
you bend the 3rd string toward the ceiling so that your bending finger is out
of the way of the 2nd string. Listen to the CD to hear how this lick sounds.
You can also play bends as double-stops — you just bend two strings at the
same time, usually by barring the two strings with one finger. (See Chapter 7
for more information on double-stops.) Figure 9-23 shows a double-stop bend
of the 2nd and 3rd strings in the box pattern at the fifth fret. Use your first
finger to play the fifth-fret double-stop; then use your third finger to play the
double-stop bend and release at the seventh fret. The double arrow in the
notation tells you to bend both notes. By the way, it’s shown as a single arrow
on the release of the bend only to avoid messiness in the notation — so go
ahead and release both notes.

Varying Your Sound with Vibrato
Think of the term vibrato, and you may imagine a singer’s wavering voice or a
violinist’s twitching hand. On the guitar, however, vibrato is a steady, even (and
usually slight) fluctuation of pitch, most often achieved by rapidly bending
and releasing a note a slight degree. A vibrato can add warmth, emotion, and
life to a held, or sustained, note.
The most obvious time to apply vibrato is whenever you hold a note for a long
time. That’s when you can add some emotion to the note by using vibrato.
Vibrato not only gives the note more warmth, but it also increases the sustain
period of the note. Some guitarists, such as blues great B.B. King, are renowned
for their expressive vibrato technique. Both the tab and standard notation indi-
cate a vibrato by placing a wavy line at the top of the staff over the note to
which you apply the technique.

Chapter 9: Special Articulation: Making the Guitar Talk

You can produce a vibrato in several ways, as the following list describes:
 You can slightly bend and release a note over and over again, creating
a wah-wah-wah effect. The average pitch of the vibrato is slightly higher
than the unaltered note. The left-hand technique for this method is the
same as the technique for bending — you move a finger back and forth,
perpendicular to the string, creating a fluctuation of pitch.
 You can very rapidly slide your finger back and forth along the length
of a string, within one fret. Although you’re not actually moving your
finger out of the fret, the pitch becomes slightly sharper as you move
toward the nut and slightly flatter as you move toward the bridge.
Consequently, the average pitch of the vibrato is the same as the 
unaltered note. This type of vibrato is reserved almost exclusively for
playing classical guitar with nylon strings. (See Chapter 13 for more
information on playing classical guitar.)
 If your electric guitar has a whammy bar mounted on it, you can move
the bar up and down with your right hand, creating a fluctuation in
pitch. In addition to giving you greater rhythmic flexibility and pitch
range, the whammy bar enables you to add vibrato to an open string.
The first type of vibrato that we mention in the preceding list, the bend-and-
release type, is the most common, by far, and is the one shown in the examples
in this chapter. Support your vibrato finger with other available fingers by plac-
ing them all on the string at the same time. You can either move your whole
hand by rotating it at the wrist and keeping the finger fixed, or you can move
just your finger(s). Try both ways and see which feels most comfortable.
You may find that playing a vibrato is easier if you anchor your left hand on
the neck as you play. Squeeze the neck a little between the side of your thumb
and the part of your palm that’s about half an inch below your first finger. This
action gives you better leverage and helps you control the evenness of the
fluctuation.
Figure 9-24a shows a vibrato at the ninth fret of the 3rd string. Anchor your
hand, as we describe in the preceding paragraph, and slightly bend and release
the note over and over. Try the vibrato with each finger. Try it at different frets
and on different strings. The notation for a vibrato never tells you how fast or
slowly to bend and release — that’s up to you. But whether you play a fast
vibrato or a slow one, make sure that you keep the fluctuations steady and
even. The notation does tell you, however, whether to make the vibrato narrow
(that is, you bend the string only slightly — less than a half step — for each
pulsation) or wide (you bend the string to a greater degree — about a half
step or more). Figure 9-24a shows a regular (narrow) vibrato, and Figure 9-24b
shows a wide vibrato, indicating the latter by using an exaggerated wavy line
(with deeper peaks and valleys). Try playing a wide vibrato with each finger.
Try it at different frets and on different strings.
146
Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

If the note that you’re holding is a bent note (see the section “Getting the
Bends,” earlier in this chapter), you create the vibrato by releasing and bending
(instead of bending and releasing) — because the note’s already bent as you
start the vibrato. This action makes the average pitch lower than the held
(bent) note, which itself produces the highest pitch in the vibrato.
After a long vibrato, guitarists often play a descending slide, gradually releasing
finger pressure as they go, to give the vibrato a fancy little ending. Another
trick is to play a long note without vibrato for a while and then add some
vibrato toward the end of the note. This “delayed vibrato” is a favorite tech-
nique that singers often use.
To practice playing vibratos, play the examples shown in Figures 9-19, 9-20,
and 9-23 again, but add vibrato to the final note of each figure. Be careful
with the example in Figure 9-19 — the last note is bent, so you need to
unbend (release) and bend the note to produce the vibrato. If you want,
finish off each vibrato with a little slide-off. (See the section “Getting Slippery
with Slides,” earlier in this chapter, for more information on this technique.)
Getting Mellow with Muting
To mute notes or chords on the guitar, you use your right or left hand to
touch the strings so as to partially or completely deaden the sound. You
apply muting for one of following reasons:
 To create a thick, chunky sound as an effect.
 To prevent unwanted noises from strings that you’re not playing.
 To silence annoying commercials on TV.

Chapter 9: Special Articulation: Making the Guitar Talk

Creating a thick, chunky sound
as an effect
To use muting to create percussive effects, lightly lay your left hand across
all six strings to prevent the strings from ringing out as you strike them. Don’t
press them all the way down to the fretboard (which would cause the fretted
notes to sound), but press them hard enough to prevent the strings from
vibrating. Then strike the strings with the pick to hear the muted sound. The
tab notation indicates this type of muting by placing little Xs on the string
lines (and in place of the actual notes on the standard staff), as shown in
Figure 9-25a.
Although left-hand muting deadens the strings completely, right-hand muting
deadens them only partially — to whatever degree you desire. With partial
muting, you can still discern the strings’ pitches. To accomplish this tech-
nique, place the heel of your right hand (the side of your hand) against the
bridge as you play. It may seem a little awkward at first, but don’t worry. With
a little practice, you can keep your hand on the bridge and still strike the
strings with the pick. As you move your right hand toward the fretboard, you
increase the amount of muting. That way, you can vary the degree of muting.
The tab notation indicates this type of muting by placing the letters P.M. (for
palm mute) above the tab staff, with a dotted line indicating how long to con-
tinue the muting, as shown in Figure 9-25b.

Part III: Beyond the Basics: Starting to Sound Cool 

Preventing unwanted string noise
As a beginner, you don’t normally worry too much about preventing
unwanted string noises — you’re too involved in just getting your hands into
a comfortable position on the instrument. But as an experienced guitarist,
you prevent unwanted string noises all the time, sometimes without even
being aware of it. Following are some examples of how you do so:
 If you finger, say, the seventh fret of the 3rd string with your third finger,
your third finger leans slightly against the 2nd string, preventing it from
ringing. And as you pick the string with your right hand, your pick also
lands against the 2nd string, further preventing it from ringing.
 If you play an open-position D chord, and you don’t want to strike the
6th string because it doesn’t belong in the chord, you can bring your
left thumb up around the neck ever so slightly to touch the 6th string,
ensuring that it doesn’t ring.
 If you play a chord that omits a middle string, you need to mute that
string with a finger of the left hand. A lot of people, for example, just
because they think it sounds better, like to omit the 5th string if they
play the open-position G chord (even though you normally fret that
string for the chord). The finger that’s playing the 6th string leans
against the 5th, muting it completely.
Playing idiomatic licks using muting
If you strum the same chord over and over, especially a barre chord in a
steady eighth-note pattern, you can create additional interest by sometimes
lifting your left hand slightly to mute out the strings. The alternation of the
normally fretted chord and the muted strings can create some interesting syn-
copation effects (effects where the normal, expected accentuation of notes is
intentionally altered or disrupted). Figure 9-26 demonstrates this technique.

Chapter 9: Special Articulation: Making the Guitar Talk

Figure 9-27 demonstrates how to use right-hand muting in a typical hard rock
or heavy-metal rhythm-guitar figure. Keep the heel of your right hand against
or near the bridge as you play the notes for which the tab indicates a palm
mute (P.M.). Don’t deaden the notes so much, however, that you can’t
discern their pitches. Lift your hand for the accented notes (indicated by
the symbol >).
On Johnny Cash records and other classic country records, you can hear the
sound of muted country guitars. Figure 9-28 is based on a simple C chord, but
the palm muting gives the riff a country sound.

Playing a Song with Varied Articulation
“The Articulate Blues” is a short solo piece, in the form of a 12-bar blues, that
employs all the articulations that we discuss in this chapter. (See Chapters 6,
10, and 11 for more on the 12-bar blues form.) It combines single notes,
chords, and riffs. It’s an integrated style of playing that real-life guitarists use.
Looking at the song’s notation, you see slides, pull-offs, bends, vibratos, and
a hammer-on. The tab doesn’t indicate any muting, but you can use that tech-
nique any time that you want to avoid unwanted noises; in measure 5, for
example, you can lean your left thumb lightly against the 6th string to pre-
vent it from ringing while you play the A7 chord.

P
laying rock ’n’ roll guitar is arguably the most fun that you can have with
an inanimate object in your hands. With the volume turned up and your
adrenaline flowing, nothing’s quite like laying down a chunking rhythm or rip-
ping through a searing lead to screaming, adoring fans — or even to your
own approving smile coming back at you from the mirror. All you need to do
is figure out how to play a couple of simple patterns and you can be gyrating
like Elvis, duck-walking like Chuck Berry, and windmilling like Pete Townshend
in no time.
Stripped of all bravado and showmanship, rock guitar is just like any other
guitar style. You absorb it in simple, easy steps and then practice, practice,
practice until it comes naturally. After you pick up some rhythm and lead pas-
sages and get the techniques down, the real work begins: standing in front of
a mirror and perfecting your moves.
In this chapter, we hit all the high notes — classic rock, modern rock, and
Southern rock sounds. Along the way, you can pick up some skills and tech-
niques applicable to other styles, such as playing from box positions and
using alternative ways to tune your guitar. 
Classic Rock ’n’ Roll
Classic rock ’n’ roll is defined here as the straightforward style pioneered by
Chuck Berry and heard in the music of the early Beatles, the Rolling Stones,
the Who, the Beach Boys, and others who based their sound on a solid,

chord-based rhythm guitar groove. It also includes the sound of the blues-
based rockers, such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, and Cream’s
Eric Clapton.
Rhythm guitar
About 99 percent of all rock guitar playing involves what’s known as rhythm
guitar playing. To a guitarist, playing rhythm means supplying the accompani-
ment or backing part to a vocalist or other featured instrument. Mostly, this
accompaniment involves strumming chords and, to a lesser extent, playing
single-note or double-stop (two notes played at once; see Chapter 7) riffs in
the lower register (the bottom two or three strings). Listen to the verses of
Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode” or the Beatles’ “I Saw Her Standing There”
for some good, unadulterated rhythm guitar, and check out the Beatles’ “Day
Tripper” for low-note riffing. Listen also to almost anything by the Who’s Pete
Townshend, who’s (no pun intended) the quintessential rock rhythm guitarist
and who immortalized the “windmill” technique — the sweeping circular
motion of the right hand that you can use for strumming chords. And although
he’s mostly known for his innovative lead work, Eddie Van Halen is one of the
best rhythm guitarists in the modern-rock genre.
Open-position accompaniment
The Chuck Berry style, a simple rhythm figure (accompaniment pattern) in
open position (using open strings), gains its name from the fact that almost all
of Berry’s songs use this pattern. Figure 10-1 shows the pattern for this style.
The pattern in Figure 10-1 features a movement within the chord between
two notes, the fifth and sixth degrees (steps) of the scale (that is, of the major
scale that corresponds to whatever key you’re playing in). (You know the
major scale; it’s what you get when you play all the white keys from C to C on
a piano — the familiar do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do.) Knowing the degrees isn’t impor-
tant, except that musicians sometimes refer to this figure as the 5-to-6 pattern. 
To play this rhythm effectively, use the following techniques:
 Anchor the first finger (at the second fret) and add the third finger (at
the fourth fret) as you need it.
 Pick the notes using all downstrokes.
 Don’t lift the first finger while adding the third finger.
Notice that all three chords, A, D, and E, use the exact same fingering and
that the open strings make the pattern easy to play.
156
Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

The 12-bar blues pattern
The 5-to-6 pattern sounds great, but to make it work for you, you need to put
it into a progression. Figure 10-2 shows what’s known as a 12-bar blues pro-
gression, a common chord progression in tons of rock songs: “Johnny B.
Goode,” “Roll Over Beethoven,” “Tutti Frutti,” “At the Hop,” and “Blue Suede
Shoes,” to name but a few. 
Notice that the 12-bar blues progression in Figure 10-2 is in the key of A, uses
the 5-to-6 movement, and has major chord symbols above the notes. The 12-
bar blues progression can occur in any key, and often uses dominant-seventh
chords (as in Chapter 6) instead of major chords.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Lead guitar
After you gain a solid feel for a basic rock ’n’ roll rhythm, you may want to
try some lead guitar, which simply involves playing single notes over an
underlying accompaniment. You can play memorized licks, which are short,
self-contained phrases, or you can improvise by making up melodies on the
spot. In this section, we provide you with the building blocks for great classic
rock solos, help you mix in some articulation, show you how to string it all
together, and finish up with some tips on building your own solos.
What’s behind Box I? The pentatonic minor scale
You can play lead right away by memorizing a few simple patterns on the
guitar neck, known as boxes, that produce instant results. Basically, guitarists
memorize a finger pattern that vaguely resembles the shape of a box —
hence the term box position — and use notes from that pattern (in various
orders) over and over pretty much throughout a solo or a section of a solo.
In soloing over a basic chord progression, you can keep using this one pat-
tern even if the chords change. By learning the boxes in this chapter, your
arsenal for soloing over the 12-bar blues will be almost complete. (For more
on soloing, see Chapter 11.)
The first box we’re going to show you is made up of notes of what’s known
as the pentatonic minor scale, and it’s the most useful box for rock music
(and is also the daddy of the blues boxes — see Chapter 11). You don’t need
to think about theory, scales, or chords — only the fingering, which you
memorize. These patterns contain no “wrong notes,” so by virtue of just
moving your fingers around in time to a rhythm track, you can play instant
rock ’n’ roll lead guitar. You don’t even need to add water (which is especially
hazardous if you’re playing an electric guitar).
The pentatonic minor scale is a five-note scale; its formula, in scale degrees
(in comparison to a major scale that starts from the same note) is: 1, %3, 4, 5, %7.
If the notes of a C major scale, for example, are numbered 1 through 7 — as
follows: C(1), D(2), E(3), F(4), G(5), A(6), B(7) — the notes of the C pentatonic
minor scale are C(1), E%(%3), F(4), G(5), B%(%7). That’s the theory anyway, but
for now, you’re just going to memorize a pattern and use your ear — not your
brain — to guide your fingers.
Figure 10-3 shows a two-octave A pentatonic minor scale in fifth position.
(See Chapter 7 for more information about positions.) This example is your
first box, here called Box I.
Before proceeding, make sure you understand how the neck diagrams and
staff correspond. Note that the neck diagram does not show a chord, but a
scale, where the notes are played one at a time, from lowest to highest (as
shown in the standard notation and tab below).
159
Chapter 10: Rock

Notice that in the figure we show you (beneath the notes in the standard nota-
tion) the scale degree (not so important) and (beneath the tab numbers) the
fingering (very important) for each note; we also show you which notes are
good for bending. Memorize the fingering until you can play it in your sleep.
This pattern is essential to know if you want to play rock guitar. Memorize it.
Really do it. Play it over and over, up and down. Really. (We mean it. Honest!)
We use the key of A for all the examples in this section because the backing
chords (as shown in Figure 10-2) are easy to play and the soloing notes fall
around the middle of the neck, where they’re comfortable to play. But if you’d
like to play lead in other keys, move your box patterns up or down the neck
the appropriate number of frets. For example, to play in the key of B, move
your boxes up two frets.
Having a box to use in improvising lead guitar is what makes playing classic
rock ’n’ roll (or blues) so much fun; you don’t need to think — you just gotta
feel. Of course, you can’t just play the five notes of the scale up and down, over
and over — that would get boring very fast. Instead, you use your creativity to
create licks by using the scale and adding articulations such as bends, slides,
and hammer-ons until you have a complete solo. (See Chapter 9 for more infor-
mation on articulation techniques.) We show you how to add these articula-
tions in the following section.
Adding articulations
The box pattern shows you what to play, but articulations show you how to
play. Articulations include hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, bends, and vibrato.
These elements are what make a solo sound like a solo, give the solo

expression, and personalize it. Chapter 9 explains each articulation step by
step, but we tell you how to use articulations to make some righteous rock ’n’
roll right here. 
Figure 10-4 shows a four-bar lick using notes of Box I (the pentatonic minor
scale) in ascending and descending order that you connect by using hammer-
ons and pull-offs. Notice how much smoother and more flowing the sound is,
as opposed to what you hear if you pick every note separately.
Bending notes is probably the coolest sound in lead soloing, but the trick is
knowing which notes to bend and when to do so. When using Box I, guitarists
really like to bend notes on the 2nd and 3rd strings because the tension feels
right, and they get to bend toward the ceiling — their favorite direction. Start
off by bending the third-finger note on the 3rd string and the fourth-finger note
on the 2nd string. (See Chapter 9 for more information on how to bend a note.)
Figure 10-5 shows a typical four-bar phrase featuring a 3rd- and 2nd-string bend
in Box I.

Chapter 10: Rock

Figure 10-6 shows a typical two-bar phrase featuring a double-stop bend in
Box I. The note that’s on the seventh fret of the 2nd string isn’t part of the A
pentatonic minor scale, but it sounds good anyway, and it’s easy to play
because the third finger barres both notes of the double-stop.
Add some vibrato to the final note to give it some expression.
Building a solo using Box I
An improvised solo is something that you create, and nobody can show you
exactly what to play. But we can show you the tools for soloing so that you
can practice and get a feel for it. Beyond that, however, your personality does
the talking.
For now, start out by getting the feel of playing lead over the 12-bar blues
accompaniment pattern that we show you in Figure 10-2, which is incorpo-
rated into the rhythm track on the CD.
Notice that each of the phrases (in Figures 10-4, 10-5, and 10-6) that we show
you in the preceding section, “Adding articulations,” alternates one active
measure (containing lots of notes) with one static measure (containing just
one note). This alternation between activity and rest prevents monotony.
Play these phrases in the order that we describe in the following instructions,
and you have a ready-made 12-bar solo. (If you want, you can play the solo
over and over.) To play such a solo, just follow these steps:
1. For the first four bars of the solo, play the double-stop lick, shown in
Figure 10-6 twice.
2. For the next four bars of the solo, play the hammer-on/pull-off lick, as
shown in Figure 10-4.
3. For the last four bars of the solo, play the “bending the 3rd and 2nd
strings” lick (refer to Figure 10-5).

Chapter 10: Rock

Boxes II and III
The next two boxes, which we name here Box II and Box III, don’t show notes
on all six strings as Box I does, because guitarists generally play only the
notes on the top two or three strings.
Box II consists of five notes, as shown in Figure 10-8. Notice that the two
notes at the top of this box (at the eighth fret) are also part of Box I, but in
Box I, you play them with the pinky or third finger. This box shows notes
from the A pentatonic minor scale in eighth position. Again, in the figure, we
show you the scale degree and fingering for each note, and we show you
which note is good for bending.
Box II is popular because it features a good note for bending under the third
finger, and that note also happens to be the highest note in the box. In play-
ing lead, high is good. You can play the highest note in the box and then make
it even higher by bending it up a step. This technique produces quite a dra-
matic effect. Try it.
In Figure 10-9 you see a typical lick using Box II notes that features a bend on
the highest note of the box.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Box III is a funny one because some of its notes aren’t in the A pentatonic
minor scale — but guitarists use this box a lot anyway. The following list tells
you all the stuff that Box III has going for it:
 Box III is easy to play and memorize — it’s exactly like Box II but lies two
frets higher on the neck.
 Box III has two notes — F# (the sixth degree) and B (the second degree) —
that don’t fall in the A pentatonic minor scale. And this is a good thing.
These two notes are borrowed from the parent major scale (the major
scale that starts on the same note — in this case, A), and sometimes 
guitarists like to add them to the pentatonic minor scale for variety and
spice. The predominance of notes from the pentatonic minor scale is what
gives classic rock ’n’ roll (and blues) its flavor — not the total exclusion of
all other notes.
 The good note for bending in Box III falls under the third finger.
 The first degree of the scale, the note on which you often end a phrase,
is under the first finger on the 2nd string in this box. You tend to apply
vibrato to the ending note of a phrase (especially if you hold it), and this
note provides an ideal finger and string on which to vibrato.
Figure 10-10 shows Box III (in tenth position for the key of A). Again we show
you the scale degree and fingering for each note — and the note that’s good
for bending we circle again.
Often, guitarists concentrate on the 2nd and 3rd strings of Box III, as shown
in Figure 10-11, which depicts a typical Box III phrase. Don’t forget to vibrato
that last note!

Building a solo by using Boxes I, II, and III
This section simply puts together licks from the three boxes that we describe
in the preceding sections. You don’t need any new information; you just need
to piece together what you know if you read the information we give in those
sections. (If you haven’t yet, we suggest that you do so now, before you try
out the solo we describe here.) In other words, after you make the bricks, you
can put them together to make a house.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

In the following list, we show you how to build a ready-made 12-bar solo con-
sisting of six two-bar phrases (using three boxes) that we show you in the
preceding sections. Follow these steps:
1. Play the Box I double-stop lick, as shown in Figure 10-6.
2. Play the Box I “bending the 3rd string” lick, as shown in the first half
of Figure 10-5.
3. Play the Box III lick, as shown in Figure 10-11.
4. Play the Box I “bending the 2nd string” lick, as shown in the second
half of Figure 10-5.
5. Play the Box II lick, as shown in Figure 10-9.
6. Play the Box I double-stop lick again, as shown in Figure 10-6.
Figure 10-12 shows you the music to the preceding steps. Listen to the CD to
hear how this solo sounds.
As you play this solo over and over, you get a feel for soloing with the three
boxes over a 12-bar blues progression. The fun begins after you start making
up your own solos. Following are some guidelines for creating your own leads:
 Think in terms of short phrases strung together. You can even play just
one short phrase over and over, even though the backing chords change.
A good way to make up a phrase is to make it a singable one. Sing a short
phrase in your mind but use notes from the box.
 Add some articulation — especially bends, because they sound the
coolest. Add vibrato to long notes that end a phrase, sometimes sliding
down at the very end.
 Alternate between activity (lots of notes) and rest (a few notes or just
one note or even silence for a few beats).
 Move from box to box to give your solo some variety.
Don’t be inhibited or worry about making a mistake. In our opinions, you
can’t really make a mistake, because all the notes in the boxes sound good
against all the chords in the backing progression. The only mistake that you
can make is to avoid soloing for fear of sounding lame. Soloing takes practice,
but you gradually build confidence. If you’re too shy to solo in front of people,
start out by doing it along with the CD, where no one can hear you. Pretty
soon, no one can stop you.
Listen to recordings to get new ideas as you become more confident in your
playing. As you hear a recording, you may be able to figure out exactly what
the guitarist is playing, because most guitarists use the same boxes, bends,
vibratos, and so on that you do. Some good people to listen to for ideas are
Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Eddie Van Halen.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Modern Rock
Whereas classic rock ’n’ roll rhythm guitar uses simple chords, modern-rock
music makes use of chords other than basic major, minor, and 7th chords. Sus
chords, add chords, slash chords, and unusual chords that result from retuning
your guitar are all part of the modern-rock lexicon.
Alternate tunings enable you to create entirely new rhythm guitar colors and
textures that aren’t possible in standard tuning, and this sound is an espe-
cially important component of the ’90s alternative movement.
Also in this section we describe another approach to lead playing in which
you use the pentatonic major scale — a scale that’s different from the bluesier
pentatonic minor scale that you play mainly in classic rock ’n’ roll and blues.
You can use the pentatonic major scale for Southern- and country-rock leads,
as well as for adding variety to blues-based leads.
Sus and add chords
Chords are often built by taking every other note of a major scale. For exam-
ple, if you build a three-note chord by taking every other note of the C major
scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B), you get C-E-G (a C major chord). The chord members
(the individual notes that make up the chord) are labeled according to their
scale degrees: C is “1” (or the root of the chord); E is “3” (or the third of the
chord); and G is “5” (or the fifth of the chord).
In sus chords, you replace the third of a chord with the fourth, as in sus4
(which you pronounce suss-four) or sometimes with the second, as in sus2.
The resulting sound is incomplete or unresolved but creates an interesting
sound that’s neither major nor minor.
An add chord is simply a basic chord (such as a major chord) to which you add
an extra note. If you take a C chord and add a D note to it, for example, you
have a Cadd2 (which you pronounce see-add-two) chord (with notes C-D-E-G).
This chord is different from Csus2, which has no E. (The D took its place.)
Open-position sus chords
Although you can play sus chords as movable barre chords, the open-position
ones are the easiest to play and are the ones guitarists most commonly use.
Figure 10-13 shows the fingerings for a progression that uses Dsus4, Dsus2,
Asus4, and Asus2 chords.
169
Chapter 10: Rock

Open-position add chords
You can play add chords as movable barre chords, but the open-position add
chords are the most common and the easiest to play. Figure 10-14 shows the
fingerings and a progression for the Cadd9 (which adds a D note, the ninth
degree of the C scale, to the three notes that make up the basic C major
chord) and “four-fingered” G chords. The “four-fingered” G chord isn’t an
add chord, but you almost always use this G fingering before or after a Cadd9
chord.
Slash chords
Slash chords are colorful, interesting chords that add spice and flavor to
modern rock music. A slash chord is, simply, a chord with a slash (/) in its
name, as in Am/C (which you pronounce as A minor over C). To the left of the

slash is the chord itself. To the right of the slash is the bass note for that
chord. Often, the lowest-pitched note of a chord — the bass note — is the
root of the chord (the note that gives the chord its name). So if you see a
chord name such as Am, you assume that the bass note is A. But the root
isn’t always the lowest note of a chord. In fact, any note can serve as a bass
note, be it a chord tone other than the root (such as the third or fifth of the
chord) or a note that isn’t even a member of the chord at all. If you do have
such a nonroot bass note, you indicate that bass note by placing it to the
right of the slash. So Am/C means that you’re playing an A minor chord —
but with a C as the lowest note.
Guitarists often use slash chords in progressions where the bass line forms
an ascending or descending scale. This sort of bass pattern gives interest
and unity to a progression. You can hear a progression such as this one
in the song “Whiter Shade of Pale,” by Procol Harum. Figure 10-15 shows
another progression using slash chords in this manner. To bring out the
bass line, in each measure, play only the bottom note of the chord on
beat 1 and then strum the chord on beats 2 and 3 (what “Bass strum strum”
means).
The chords in Figure 10-15 show Xs in the chord diagrams, which tell you
which strings not to play. To keep a string from sounding, use the left-hand
finger that’s fretting the adjacent lower-pitched string to mute it by lightly
touching it.

Chapter 10: Rock

Alternate tunings
Modern rock guitar music of the late ’80s and ’90s makes frequent use of 
alternate tunings — tunings other than the standard EADGBE tuning (see
Chapter 2). By using alternate tunings, you can achieve new, exciting sounds
that are impossible to attain in standard tuning. Alternate tunings may also
enable you to play licks or chords that are difficult to finger in standard
tuning but that are easy to finger in alternate tuning. But remember; after you
retune your guitar, all your familiar fingerings are out the window. That’s why
picking up new licks and riffs in alternate tunings by reading tab can prove
especially helpful. Artists as diverse as Joni Mitchell, the Rolling Stones, and
Soundgarden make extensive use of alternate tunings.
Drop D (DADGBE)
Drop-D tuning (so called because you detune, or drop, the low E string down
to D) is the alternate tuning that’s closest to standard tuning — you retune
only the 6th string. To get into this tuning, lower (drop) your 6th string until
it sounds an octave lower than your 4th string. This tuning enables you to
play a D or Dm chord with a low D as a root on the 6th string, giving you a
full, rich sound.
Figure 10-16 shows a typical passage in drop-D tuning. It has a bluesy sound.
Bend the third-fret note of the 6th string very slightly.
An advantage of drop-D tuning is that you can play low power chords on the
bottom two strings as two-string barres, which enables you to play power
chord riffs more easily, as shown in Figure 10-17.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Open D (DADF#AD)
In an open tuning, the open strings form a major chord. In open-D tuning, they
form (big surprise) a D chord. In this tuning, most of the chords that you play
are nothing but open strings or one finger barring across all six strings. You
can, for example, play a G chord simply by barring the entire fifth fret with
your index finger. Joni Mitchell has made extensive use of this tuning in songs
such as “Big Yellow Taxi.”
To get into this tuning, follow these steps:
1. Drop your 6th string until it sounds an octave lower than the open 4th
string.
2. Drop your 3rd string so that it matches the note at the fourth fret of
the 4th string.
3. Drop your 2nd string so that it matches the note at the third fret of the
3rd string.
4. Drop your 1st string so that it matches the note at the fifth fret of the
2nd string (and is one octave higher than the open 4th string).
If you raise all six strings by one whole step (two frets) from open-D tuning,
you get open-E tuning (EBEG#BE), which you can consider as essentially the
same tuning as open D, because the relationships between the strings remain
the same, even though the actual notes differ.
In Figure 10-18 you see a typical phrase using open-D tuning that sounds like
something Joni Mitchell may have played on one of her early albums.

Chapter 10: Rock

Another common alternate tuning that you may run across is open-G
(DGDGBD, low-pitched to high), often used by Keith Richards of the Rolling
Stones on such songs as “Brown Sugar” and “Start Me Up.” (See Chapter 12
for an example that uses open-G tuning.)
Country-rock and Southern-rock lead
Since the days of the Eagles, the Grateful Dead, and the Allman Brothers
Band, country rock and Southern rock have enjoyed mainstream success
and appeal. The sound of these styles falls somewhere between that of
straight country music and blues, although both are too rock-oriented for
straight country and yet not quite hard-edged enough to pass as blues-
based rock. The slightly simpler, more major sound of these styles can be
attributed to the chords the guitarists typically use and, to a greater extent,
the scales that they use in the solo passages. To get a feel for this sound,
listen to the music of the Byrds, the Allman Brothers Band, the Marshall
Tucker Band, Pure Prairie League, Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Grateful Dead, and
the Eagles, as well as that of folk rockers Jackson Browne, J.D. Souther,
and Linda Ronstadt.
The Pentatonic major scale
You can define the notes of the pentatonic minor scale in any key as 1, %3, 4, 5,
%7, as compared to the parent major scale. You practice the scale as a memo-
rized box, which is just fine. The pentatonic major scale, on the other hand,
uses the 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 notes of the parent major scale. It’s a five-note scale that
has no chromatic alterations (that is, notes that you alter by raising or lower-
ing a half step), so it sounds just like a major scale with two notes left out.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Again, the pentatonic major scale is a very useful scale because it practically
makes music itself, and you can’t play any “wrong” notes. (See the section
“What’s behind Box I? The pentatonic minor scale,” earlier in this chapter,
for more information on scale degrees and the pentatonic minor scale.)
After you master the pentatonic minor scale, the pentatonic major scale is a
cinch. Just move the pentatonic minor scale down three frets and voilà, you
have a pentatonic major scale. Just play the same pattern, and the notes,
theory, and all that nonsense take care of themselves.
Say, for example, that you know that you play the A pentatonic minor scale at
the fifth fret against a chord progression in the key of A. Well, drop that lead
pattern down to the second position (where your left-hand index finger plays
the notes on the second fret), and you have an A pentatonic major scale, suit-
able for country-rock and Southern-rock progressions. (See Chapter 7 for
more information on positions.)
Figure 10-19 shows the A pentatonic major scale in second position (Box I)
and fifth position (Box II), along with the scale degree and fingering for each
note and the good note for bending in each box (circled). Notice that the only
real difference from the pentatonic minor scale is the starting fret.

Licks that you base on the pentatonic major scale
The good news is that, as is true of the pentatonic minor scale, the penta-
tonic major scale has all the right things going for it: Bending notes lie in
good places; you use your index finger on each string of Box I for a solid feel;
and the scale is especially suitable for the use of hammer-ons, pull-offs, and
slides for more expressive possibilities.
The bad news is that, although you’re still in A, the fingering is shifted, so you
no longer can count on landing on the usual fingers to end your solo. But we
don’t think that this problem is an especially big one. With just a little reori-
entation (and your ear), you can find good alternative notes in no time.
And here’s a tip: Good notes for ending a pentatonic major solo in A are the
second fret of the 3rd string (Box I) and the fifth fret of the 1st string (Box I
or II).
Figure 10-20 shows a four-bar lick to get you starting down that Southern
country road. Notice that this lick features bends in both positions (Boxes I
and II) and a slide from Box II back down to Box I to bring you home.

Playing Songs in the Rock Style
Don your tour jackets and pile into your limousines, because you’re going to
be rockin’ out in style in this part of the chapter.
This section’s songs cover two styles: the deliberate-sounding, classic rock
’n’ roll of the late ’50s and the easy-sounding twang of the country- and
Southern-rock movements of the ’70s.
Here is some special information about the songs to help you along:
 Chuck’s Duck. To play “Chuck’s Duck,” you need to know how to play
licks with the pentatonic minor scale (see the section “What’s behind
Box I? The pentatonic minor scale,” earlier in this chapter); how to play
double-stops and double-stop bends (see Chapters 7 and 9); and how to
bend down on one knee and hop across a stage without requiring arthro-
scopic surgery afterward.
Double-stops, the pentatonic minor scale, and continuous eighth notes
characterize the classic rock ’n’ roll sound. Notice the quick, bursting
bends on the 3rd string in bars 6 through 9.
 Southern Hospitality. To play “Southern Hospitality,” you need to know
how to play the pentatonic major scale (see the section “The pentatonic
major scale,” earlier in this chapter); how to play sus, add, and slash
chords (see the section “Modern Rock,” earlier in this chapter); and how
to grow an overly long beard.
By taking the pentatonic minor scale and moving it down three frets, you
have the pentatonic major scale, which you use to create a true country-
rock and Southern-rock sound in the styles of the Eagles, Poco, and Pure
Prairie League. After playing the lead part, try the rhythm guitar part,
which features sus, add, and slash chords. We’ve indicated the left-hand
chord fingerings for you, but listen to the CD for the right-hand strum-
ming pattern.

Chapter 11
Blues
In This Chapter
 Playing electric blues
 Playing acoustic blues
 Playing songs about heartbreak and sorrow and looking good doing it!
B
lues is one of the most popular forms of guitar music, both for the lis-
tener and the player. And why not? Who could resist the easy rhythms,
the expressive melodies, and the soulful lyrics of the blues? Not every form
of music can warm your heart as the singer is lamenting his death-row plight
for a murder he didn’t commit while his baby runs off with his best friend.
Ah, the sweet sorrow.
But before we get too sentimental, we want to tell you why playing the blues
just seems born for the guitar. One reason is that it’s a relatively easy style
to play (especially if you compare it to jazz or classical music): Blues accom-
paniment patterns are accessible and comfortable to the hands, and blues
melodies fall particularly well on the guitar’s neck because of the scales the
style uses and the way you tune the instrument’s strings. Plus, blues isn’t
technically demanding, and you play it best by ear with the heart guiding
the way. 
Playing great blues — following in the musical footsteps of such legends as
B.B. King or the late Stevie Ray Vaughan — may be difficult, but playing
pretty good blues right away is still fairly easy if you know the form, a couple
of scales, and some simple blues moves. 
In this chapter, we cover electric and acoustic blues. Along the way, we 
introduce you to more boxes, the blues scale, Roman-numeral naming, and
turnarounds.

Electric Blues
Electric blues is the kind of blues that all the giants of the genre play: Buddy
Guy, B.B. King, Albert King, Albert Collins, Johnny Winter, and Duane Allman,
among others. Electric-blues guitar playing breaks down fairly neatly into two
categories: rhythm and lead.
Blues rhythm guitar
Rhythm playing is what you do whenever you’re not playing lead — such as
accompanying a singer or another featured instrument by playing chords,
background figures, and repeated low-note riffs. Rhythm generally requires
less technical proficiency than playing lead does and relies more on the gui-
tarist’s “feel” than on his technique. To put chord playing into some kind of
context, you want to begin with the most popular form, or progression, in the
style, the 12-bar blues.
The basic structure of the 12-bar blues form
Blues and rock guitar are similar in that each leans heavily on the 12-bar blues
form for song structure (see Chapter 10). Taking the key of A as an example,
the 12-bar blues progression consists of four bars of A, two bars of D, two bars
of A, one bar of E, one bar of D, and two bars of A. In music notation, the 12-
bar blues progression looks like the example shown in Figure 11-1.
Chords in any common progression, including the blues progression in Figure
11-1, are often referred to by Roman numerals. These numerals identify the
chords generically rather than by key. You always assign Roman numeral I to
the chord that names the key you’re in. Then, you count up alphabetically,
letter by letter, assigning other numbers to chords.

on your fingers, starting from A, to confirm that A is I, D is IV, and E is V.) In
the key of G, on the other hand, G is I, C is IV, and D is V. By using such a
system, if you decide to switch keys, you can always just say, “Start playing at
the IV (four) chord in bar 5.” If you know which chords are I, IV, and V in that
key, you’re ready to play. See Table 11-1 for a handy reference that shows the
I, IV, and V chords in common keys.

If you’re playing your blues accompaniment by using barre chords (see
Chapter 8 for more information on barre chords), you can remember which
chords are which merely by their position on the neck. Say, for example, that
you’re playing a blues progression in A. If you make an E-based barre chord
at the fifth fret (A), you’re playing the I chord in A. If you switch to the A-
based barre chord form at that same fret, you’re now playing the IV chord, or
D. Move that same A-based barre two frets higher on the neck — to the sev-
enth fret — and you’re playing the V chord, E. See how easy playing the blues
can be! Use those same positions anywhere on the neck — an E-based barre
chord at any fret, following it with an A-based barre chord at the same fret,
and moving that barre up two frets — and you know the I-IV-V progression for
whatever key goes with the starting fret.
The following are two important variations of the 12-bar blues form:
 Quick IV: Still using the key of A as an example, you substitute a D (IV)
chord for A (I) in bar 2. Ordinarily, you must wait until bar 5 to play the
IV chord, so switching to it in bar 2 feels pretty quick, hence the name.
 Turnaround: A turnaround is a V chord that you play on the last bar
(bar 12) instead of a I chord. This change helps draw the music back to
the I chord of the first bar, “turning the progression around” to bar 1.
Blues guitarists base many lead licks just on the turnaround at the pro-
gression’s end.
185
Chapter 11: Blues

Try substituting 7th or 9th chords (A7, D9, or E9, for example) for the basic I-
IV-V chords to make the music sound even bluesier (see Chapters 6 and 8).
Triplet feel
Blues relies heavily on a rhythmic feel known as a triplet feel (sometimes
called a shuffle feel or a swing feel). In a triplet feel, you divide each beat into
three parts (instead of the normal two). You can hear this feel on the CD
recording of Figure11-2, but here’s a good way to get an understanding of the
difference between straight feel and triplet feel. Recite each of the following
phrases out loud, snapping your fingers on each capitalized syllable. (Make
sure that you snap your fingers — it’s important!)
1. TWIN-kle TWIN-kle LIT-tle STAR.
That’s a straight feel — each finger snap is a beat, and each beat you divide
into two parts.
2. FOL-low the YEL-low brick ROAD.
That’s a triplet feel — each finger snap is a beat, and each beat you divide
into three parts. Because lots of blues use a triplet feel, you need to know
how to play a 12-bar blues accompaniment figure with that feel.
Figure 11-2 shows you an accompaniment figure — here with the quick IV
(bar 2) and turnaround (bar 12) variation — consisting of nothing more than
strummed chords in a triplet rhythm. Typically, the last bar of a blues song
uses a progression in which you approach the final chord from one fret above
or below it (see measure 13). See the chord diagrams on the figure for the fin-
gerings of the 9th chords in the song.
If you know how to play a rock boogie-woogie accompaniment figure (in
Chuck Berry–style — see Chapter 10), you should have no trouble at all play-
ing Figure 11-3, which is actually the same boogie accompaniment figure (but
with the quick IV variation), except that you play it in a triplet feel. Again, you
approach the last chord from a fret above. 
In the music in Figure 11-2, the equivalency (qr = qce) that appears next to
the words “Triplet feel” indicates that you should substitute triplet (or shuf-
fle) eighths for straight eighth notes. In triplet eighths, you hold the first note
of each beat a little longer than the second.

Blues lead guitar
Blues lead is the single-note melodic line, consisting of a mixture of com-
posed lines and improvised phrases. A great lead solo includes both these
elements in one seamless, inspired whole.
The boxes
Blues guitarists improvise mostly by using “boxes” — just as rock guitarists
do. A box is a fingerboard pattern — usually outlining a pentatonic minor
scale — that vaguely resembles the shape of a box. (See Chapter 10 for more
information on pentatonic minor scales and boxes.) By using notes in the
box, you can improvise lead lines that automatically sound good as you play
them over a 12-bar blues accompaniment.
You may already know how to use boxes to play rock ’n’ roll lead guitar,
which employs the same scales and chords as blues. (And we describe these
in Chapter 10.) If so, you should have no trouble understanding the example
in Figure 11-4, which shows the three boxes that you can use for soloing in
the key of A that we introduce in Chapter 10; we circle the notes that are
good for bending. (For more information on bending, see Chapter 9.) 
189
Chapter 11: Blues
Blues lyrics and structure
In dealing with the blues, one good way to keep
the song’s structure straight is to think of the 12-
bar progression as three four-bar phrases. You
can do so because the lyrics of a typical blues
song usually fall in an AAB form (which means
that the first two sections of the song are the
same and the third one is different), with each
of the three sections taking up four bars. A typ-
ical blues song, for example, may go something
like the following:
First phrase: “I woke up this morning; I was feel-
ing mighty bad.” This phrase you sing over the
first four bars of the 12-bar progression (I, I, I, I
or I, IV, I, I for the quick IV variation).
Second phrase: “I woke up this morning; I was
feeling mighty bad.” This phrase repeats the
same lyrics that you sing in the first phrase, and
you sing it over the second four bars of the pro-
gression (IV, IV, I, I).
Third phrase: “I can’t stop thinking I lost the best
gal I ever had.” This phrase is different from the
first two phrases, and you sing it over the last
four bars of the progression (V, IV, I, I — or V, IV,
I, V if you’re going to repeat the progression).
Usually, you sing each vocal phrase within the
first two measures of the four-bar phrase, giving
the instrumentalist (maybe even you!) a chance
to play some cool blues licks during measures
3 and 4 of each phrase, which gives the song a
kind of question-answer feeling. But even if
you’re not using a vocalist on a particular song,
the instrumentalists can still play the tune with
this two-bar plus two-bar, question-answer
mentality in each four-bar phrase.

Figure 11-5 shows two new boxes that you can also use for blues soloing. The
one we’re calling “Box IV” (because no standard names or numberings exist
for the boxes) is similar to Box III, except that we move it up three frets to the
thirteenth position (for the key of A) and we eliminate the two notes on the
1st string (see Chapter 7 for information on playing in position). Again, we
circle the good note for bending. Play the notes in this box by using your
second finger on the 3rd string and your first and third fingers on the 2nd
string. Box V is sometimes thought of as a lower extension of Box I. Use your
first and third fingers to play the notes on both strings.
You may notice that Box I covers all six strings while the other boxes cover
only two or three strings. Actually, what we’re showing you in Boxes II
through V are partial boxes. Full-box versions (using all six strings) exist for
these, but in the full versions, you end up with some “bad” or uncomfortable
fingerings, such as playing the important notes with fingers 2 and 4 instead of
the stronger 1 and 3 or having the good notes for bending end up under a bad
finger for bending. That’s why most guitarists use just the partial boxes, as
shown in these figures.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

If you know how to play typical licks by using Boxes I, II, and III (see Chap-
ter 10), the lick in Figure 11-6 that uses Box IV should give you no trouble.
Play with a triplet feel, and make sure that you apply vibrato to the last note
for a real blues effect. (See Chapter 9 for more information about vibrato.)
Notice how the bend falls under the third finger — the best finger for bending.
Figure 11-7 shows a typical lick that uses Box V. A common blues technique is
to slide on the 5th string (third finger) back and forth between Box V and Box I.
(See Chapter 9 for more information about slides.) See how nicely all the notes
fall under the first and third fingers, even as you move between the boxes.
Adding depth with additional notes
The pentatonic minor scale produces good blues notes, but adding two more
notes gives you an even richer sonic palette of note choices. The flatted fifth
and the major third help give more definition to a line by introducing a disso-
nant, or tension-filled, note (the flatted fifth) and another note (the major
third) that reinforces the major quality of the I chord.

Chapter 11: Blues

A flatted fifth is a note that’s a half step (or one fret) lower than the regular
fifth of a scale. In the A pentatonic minor scale, for example, the E note is the
fifth. (Count letter names from A to E on your fingers to confirm that E is five
notes above A.) The E% note is therefore the flatted fifth. A major third is a note
that’s a half step (or one fret) higher than the regular (minor) third of a pen-
tatonic minor scale. In the A pentatonic minor scale, for example, the C note
is the minor third. The C# note is the major third. (See Appendix A for more
information on sharps and flats.)
Creating the blues scale with the flatted fifth
The five-note pentatonic scale works great for basic blues, but for a really
funky, crying sound, toss in the flat-five note (E% in the key of A) now and then.
Adding the flat-five note to the pentatonic scale creates the six-note blues
scale. The flat five is particularly dissonant but adds some spice to the more
“vanilla-sounding” quality of the straight pentatonic minor scale. But as with
any spice, whether salt, fennel, or a flat five, add it sparingly and judiciously.
Boxes I, II, and IV, as shown in Figure 11-8, consist of notes from the penta-
tonic minor scale. The notes in circles indicate the added E% — the %5 (flat
five) — this time and not the bending notes. Box I shows the complete (two-
octave) A blues scale in fifth position, while Boxes II and IV show partial
blues scales that are good to use for improvising.
Figure 11-9 shows a typical Box-I blues lick using the blues scale. Notice that
you can produce the E% in two ways — by playing it at the eighth fret of the
3rd string or by bending the seventh-fret note (the typical good note for bend-
ing in Box I) up a half step.
Figures 11-10 and 11-11 show a typical blues-scale lick, first using Box II (in
eighth position) and then (the same lick) using Box IV (in thirteenth posi-
tion). Again, you play the %5 both straight and as a bent note (with the third
finger) in each position.

Borrowing the major third
Another note that blues players commonly add to the pentatonic minor or
blues scale is the major third. You can think of this note as one that you
“borrow” from the pentatonic major scale or from the full major scale. In the
key of A, the added major third is C#, and Figure 11-12 shows where it falls in

Chapter 11: Blues

Box I (the note in the circle). It’s the only note that you play with your second
finger if you’re using Box I (unless you’re also using the flat five that we
describe in the preceding section).
Very often, you hammer on the major third from the minor third a fret below
it, as shown in Figure 11-13. (See Chapter 9 for more on hammer-ons.) 
Even though you use the pentatonic minor scale for soloing, the key of a typi-
cal blues song is major (as in A major) because the rhythm guitarist plays
major background chords (which contain major thirds). In double-stop licks,
often heard in the music of Chuck Berry and the Beach Boys, the end of a
descending lead lick usually contains a major third to help establish the key
as major rather than minor, as shown in Figure 11-14.
Phrasing
Although blues soloing uses many of the same techniques, scales, chords,
and boxes as rock soloing does, the two styles are different in the area of
phrasing. Lots of steady-flowing eighth notes often characterize rock soloing
(think of the solo to “Johnny B. Goode”). But blues soloing (think B.B. King)
more often employs phrases that are shorter and sparser (more separated)
than those of rock. (See Appendix A for more information on eighth notes.)

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

In a typical blues melody, you may hear a very short phrase, some empty
space, and then a repetition of the same phrase. Usually, these short phrases
have a vocal quality to them in that they’re expressive, often conveying pain
or sorrow. Sometimes, if the guitarist is also the singer, the vocal phrases and
the guitar phrases are practically one and the same. Figure 11-15 shows you
a short passage that demonstrates the short-phrase concept. Notice how
the same figure (the pull-off from the eighth fret to the fifth) sounds good but
different if you play it against a different chord (first against A7 and then D7).
Repeating a figure after the chord changes is a typical blues technique.
Blues moves
Figure 11-16 shows four typical blues moves. A blues move is nothing more
than a short, cool-sounding lick (a self-contained musical phrase). The CD
demonstrates how these moves sound if you play them in the context of a
progression.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Blues moves are easy to create because they’re so short. Make up your own
and see how they sound as you play them over the 12-bar blues progressions
shown in Figures 11-2 and 11-3.
If you want to play an electric blues song right now by using the blues moves
of Figure 11-16, skip ahead to “Chicago Shuffle” in the section “Playing Blues
Songs,” later in this chapter.
Acoustic Blues
Blues guitar today is most often heard on electric guitar. B.B. King, Buddy
Guy, Muddy Waters, Johnny Winter, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Albert King, Albert
Collins, and Eric Clapton, for example, are all known for their electric guitar
playing. But blues started out as an acoustic form, played fingerstyle, and
still evokes images of the rural Mississippi Delta, where it originated and
flourished.
General concepts
Although you play electric blues in various keys by using movable boxes
(see the section “Blues lead guitar,” earlier in this chapter), you play acoustic
blues (sometimes called Delta Blues) in open position (usually playing low on
the neck and using a combination of open strings and fretted notes), almost
always in the key of E.
Steady bass with open-position pentatonic minor
The basic idea behind acoustic blues is that you’re playing a solo that incor-
porates both the melody (which you often improvise) and the accompani-
ment at the same time. This method is just opposite that of electric blues,
where one guitarist plays the melody (the lead) while another guitarist plays
the accompaniment (the rhythm).
The essence of the style is as follows: Your right-hand thumb plays the root of
each chord (the note the chord is named after) in steady quarter notes on
the bass strings. (See Appendix A for more information on quarter notes.)
Meanwhile, your right-hand fingers play melody notes that you take from the
E pentatonic minor scale or the E blues scale, in open position. (For more
information on the pentatonic minor scale and the blues scale, see Chap-
ter 10 and the section “Blues lead guitar,” earlier in this chapter.) You can use
either scale or mix them up. Figure 11-17 represents a grid showing the E pen-
tatonic minor/E blues scales in open position. Without the circled notes, you
have the E pentatonic minor scale; with the circled notes — the flat-five (%5)
notes, or B% in this key — you have the E blues scale.
197
Chapter 11: Blues

Notice that the scale in Figure 11-17 is actually Box I in open position! For the
left-hand fingering, play in first position — that is, use the same finger number
as the fret number. Because your thumb is usually steadily plucking away at
the low strings, you usually take your melody notes from the high strings.
Figure 11-18 shows a simple exercise that demonstrates the basic acoustic
blues style by using the E blues scale, first descending and then ascending.
Make sure that you play in a triplet feel, as on the CD. You can see how you
can play both the melody and accompaniment at the same time — and doing
so isn’t even difficult. That’s because the bass part is so easy to play!
Repetition
An important aspect of acoustic blues (and electric, too) is repetition. This
idea involves a motive (a short musical phrase) that you repeat, sometimes
once, sometimes over and over. In acoustic blues, you can achieve this effect
in one of the following two ways:

 Repeat a phrase at the same pitch as the background chord changes.
In Figure 11-19, the chord changes from E to A. (The different bass notes
that the thumb plays imply the chord change.) The motive, however,
repeats at the same pitch. Notice how the same notes sound different
if you play them against a different chord (even an implied one). This
technique is a blues staple.
 Repeat a phrase at a different pitch as the background chord changes.
If you use this technique, the relationship between the melody and 
background chord stays the same. This type of repetition is shown in
Figure 11-20. Barre the fifth fret to play the A chord in the second mea-
sure. (We cover barre chords in Chapter 8.)
Notice in Figure 11-20 that, for each chord, you use a hammer-on to move from
the minor third to the major third. This technique is common in the acoustic-
blues style. (See Chapter 9 for more information about hammer-ons.)

Specific techniques
You can use two simple techniques to give your blues playing more variety.
Alternating the texture (that is, combining different musical patterns, such as
playing one bar of rhythm and then a bar of lead) creates an unexpected, less
homogeneous sound. And combining open strings with fretted ones creates
some unusual results by enabling some notes to ring while others move
melodically.
Alternation
Alternation refers to the practice of playing the melody and bass parts one at a
time, in an alternating fashion, instead of at the same time. Rather than having
the thumb constantly play bass notes while the fingers simultaneously play
melody notes, you can sometimes play just melody notes or just bass notes.
This technique not only adds variety to the music’s texture, but it also enables
you (because all your fingers are available) to play some cooler-sounding,
more-difficult, trickier licks that may otherwise be impossible.
Figure 11-21 shows a phrase that begins with only the melody (which you
play in double-stops, a common acoustic blues technique) and ends with
only bass (playing a boogie groove). You can see how the bass part —
instead of playing merely quarter notes on the low roots — becomes more
elaborate if you don’t need to worry about melody notes. (See Chapter 7 for
more information about double-stops.)
An effective and fancy little trick is to play an actual bass lick (that is, a bass
melody instead of just a boogie figure) in an alternation scheme. The example
in Figure 11-22 begins like that of Figure 11-21. That’s the melody’s turn in the
alternation scheme. Then, in bar 2, the bass part takes its turn, so you can go
to town with an exciting bass lick. Typically, these bass licks use notes of the

E pentatonic minor (or E blues) scale with some major thirds (on the fourth
fret of the 6th string) and major sixths (on the fourth fret of the 5th string)
thrown in.
Open-string/fretted-string combinations
Another important acoustic-blues technique is alternating between an open
string and a fretted note (on an adjacent string) that’s the same pitch or a
nearby pitch. You usually play this technique on the treble strings, but you
can play it in the bass part as well.
In the example shown in Figure 11-23, you play the first high E on the 2nd
string (a fretted note); next, you play the E on the 1st string (an open note)
and then you play it back on the 2nd string again. The open E then recurs
after you play some nearby notes on the 2nd string. Then the same idea
occurs with the Bs on the fretted 3rd and open 2nd strings. Measure 2 (with
the bass part playing alone) illustrates the same idea in a bass-part setting.
On beats 3 and 4, the open D on the 4th string alternates with the 5th-string D
and nearby notes.

Turnarounds
In a typical acoustic blues solo, you play the 12-bar blues progression over
and over; otherwise, your entire solo ends up very, very short. Ordinarily, as
you get to the end (bars 11 and 12) each time through, you play a fancy little
lick known as a turnaround lick that’s designed to both punctuate the ending
and set you up to go back (or turn around) to bar 1 again.
In a broad sense, if you’re in the key of E, the turnaround puts you on some
kind of B or B7 chord (because that chord best leads back to the E chord —
the chord in bar 1 of the next time through). But if you simply play an E7
chord in bar 11 and a B7 in bar 12, you miss out on a world of musical
delights, as the following examples demonstrate.
Figure 11-24 shows four commonly played acoustic blues turnarounds. Notice
that most turnarounds employ some kind of chromatically moving line (that
is, one that’s moving by half steps).
202
Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 
Slide guitar
Slide guitar is an important addition to blues-
guitar technique. In playing slide, you don’t use
your left hand to fret the guitar by pressing the
strings to the fretboard, as you normally do.
Instead, you hold a metal or glass bar (the slide)
over the neck and stop the strings (shorten their
vibrating length) by pressing the slide lightly
against the strings at a given fret. To play in
tune, you must position the slide directly over
the fret wire itself, not behind it as you do in
normal fretting.
For the slides themselves, you can use anything
from the neck of a wine bottle to a medicine bottle
(the cough medicine Coricidin made the ideal
vessel and was a favorite of Duane Allman’s), to
a small length of brass pipe. The back edge of a
knife works in a pinch too. Today, specially made
glass and brass slides come in various diameters
to accommodate different finger sizes. Most
people usually wear the slide on the ring finger or
pinkie, which leaves the other fingers free for fret-
ting. The slide material itself determines the
weight and tone, and whether you choose a
heavier or lighter slide is a subjective matter.
Because the slide lays across the strings in a
straight line, playing chords where the notes
are on different frets becomes rather difficult.
Many guitarists solve this problem by tuning the
guitar to an open tuning, such as G or D. (See
Chapter 10 for more information on open tun-
ings.) Many slide-blues greats used (or still use)
open tunings. Robert Johnson played in open G;
Duane Allman played in open D or E; and Bonnie
Raitt plays in open A.
The quality of lead guitar becomes sustained,
expressive, and vocal-like if you play with a
slide. Because the slide rides on top of the
strings and doesn’t use the frets for its pitches,
the response is more like that of a violin or a
voice, where the pitch change is smooth and
continuous as opposed to the more “detached”
sound that results from normal fretting. As you
listen to the great slide artists, listen especially
to their phrasing. That’s the best way to appre-
ciate slide guitar’s emotional power — in the
expressive execution of the melodic line.

Chapter 11: Blues

If you feel pretty good about playing the figures in the “Acoustic Blues” sec-
tion, you are ready to play the song “Mississippi Mud,” in the following sec-
tion. Get down with your bad self!
Playing Blues Songs
B.B. King once said, “I have a right to sing the blues,” and if you’re ready to
try playing a couple of authentic blues songs, you have that right too! The
two songs in this section employ many of the techniques that we present
throughout the chapter.
As you first attempt to play these pieces, don’t try to rush the process. In
blues, feel comes before technique, and the best way to develop a feel is to
keep the tempo slow and manageable while you work your way up. Focus on
your feel and let the technique catch up on its own. It always does — we
promise.
Here is some special information about the songs to help you along:
 Chicago Shuffle: To play this song, you need to know how to play single-
note blues lines (see the section “Blues lead guitar,” earlier in this chap-
ter); how to piece together separate blues moves into a cohesive whole
(see the section “Blues moves,” earlier in this chapter); and how to
boogie like your back ain’t got no bone.
The lead guitar in this piece uses several devices common to blues lead
playing: short phrases with wide spaces between them, repetition, the
blues scale, double-stops, and a turnaround at the end. (For more infor-
mation on these techniques, see the earlier sections of this chapter.)
The rhythm part (not notated here, except by chord names) is the same
pattern that you use in Figure 11-3 (also not notated there either, but you
can hear it on the CD). Notice that this particular progression includes a
quick IV.
 Mississippi Mud: To play this song, you need to know how to play an
independent bass line with the thumb working against a melody that you
play with the fingers (see the section “Steady bass with open-position
pentatonic minor,” earlier in this chapter); how to alternate textures
smoothly (see the section “Alternation,” earlier in this chapter); how to
play a turnaround; and how to get your mojo workin’.
This song features many of the acoustics blues concepts covered
throughout this chapter: E pentatonic minor scale in open position,
steady bass notes, alternation (the bass plays alone in measure 2, for
example), repetition of a lick at the same pitch even though the back-
ground chord changes (measure 5), fretted note/open string combina-
tion (measure 9), and a turnaround lick (measures 11–12).

 Playing in open tunings
 Playing folk songs
I
n terms of a guitar style, “folk” means a lot more today than just playing
“Jimmy Crack Corn” around a campfire with a bunch of doleful cowboys
and a cook named Stumpy wheezing on an out-of-tune harmonica. Although
folk guitar did enjoy a humble beginning as a plaintive strumming style to
accompany simple songs, it has since evolved as a popular music category
all its own.
Folk guitar has progressed from cowboy ditties of the 19th century through
Appalachian songs and ballads in the ’30s and ’40s, to the hits of early country
artists such as Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, and Johnny Cash, to the rocka-
billy of the late-’50s. In the ’60s, folk music enjoyed a popular revival, beginning
with the Kingston Trio and continuing all the way through the heyday of Bob
Dylan, Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul, and Mary. From there, folk guitar crossed
over into the mainstream, via the sophisticated pop-folk stylings of John
Denver, James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash.
In this chapter, we cover a wide range of approaches to playing folk guitar,
including arpeggio, thumb-brush, and Carter and Travis styles. As well, we
show you how to use the capo to change keys, create new sounds with open
tunings, and play harmonics.
Playing Fingerstyle
Folk music favors fingerstyle playing (a style in which you pluck the strings
with your right-hand fingers instead of a pick). Think of the songs of Peter,

Paul, and Mary (“Puff the Magic Dragon”), Bob Dylan (“Don’t Think Twice, It’s
Alright”), and Arlo Guthrie (“Alice’s Restaurant”), and you can hear the easy,
rolling patterns that the fingers produce in the accompaniment.
But you also hear fingerstyle in rock (the Beatles’ “Blackbird,” Kansas’s “Dust
in the Wind,” and the intro to Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven”), country,
and blues. And, of course, you play all classical guitar music fingerstyle.
Fingerstyle playing opens a world of musical possibilities that the pick simply
can’t deliver. You can play two or more lines simultaneously, for example, while
fingerpicking: Your right-hand thumb plays the bass line while the fingers play
the melody and inner voices (filler or background notes on the middle strings,
between the melody and bass) for an even fuller and more complex sound.
Fingerstyle technique
In fingerstyle guitar, you pluck the strings with the individual right-hand fingers
instead of striking them with the pick. In most cases, you play the strings one
at a time, in some form of repeated pattern, while your left hand holds down a
chord. Typically, the thumb, plucking downward, plays the low (bass) strings,
and the fingers, plucking upward, play the high strings (one finger per string).
After you strike each note, move your finger away so as not to rest against
the adjacent string. This technique enables all the strings to ring out and pro-
duce chords instead of merely a succession of individual notes. In this way,
you play the guitar much as you would a harp, except that playing this way
on a guitar looks so much cooler than it does on a harp.
Right-hand position
As you play with the fingers, you want to rotate your right hand slightly so
that the fingers are more or less perpendicular to the strings. Figure 12-1
shows a before-and-after picture of the right hand in the normal, pick-holding
position and then in a rotated, perpendicular placement better suited to fin-
gerstyle playing. By keeping your right hand perpendicular to the strings, you
meet them dead-on — as opposed to at an angle if you keep your hand unro-
tated and in line with the arm. (Incidentally, this position represents the same
perpendicular approach that you use for playing classical guitar. See Chapter
13 for more information about right-hand position.)
You can do what many guitarists do and grow your right-hand fingernails a little
long so that, as you pluck, you produce a brighter or louder sound. If you want
a super-bright sound, use fingerpicks — plastic or metal devices that you actu-
ally wear on your thumb and fingers — or adhere acrylic nails to your own nat-
ural nails (a common procedure at any nail salon and an emergency measure
that many classical guitarists use if they break a nail just before a concert).
208
Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

The music notation in this book indicates the right-hand fingers by the letters
p (thumb), i (index), m (middle), and a (ring). This scheme comes from classi-
cal guitar notation. The letters p, i, m, and a are the first letters of the Spanish
words for the fingers (classical guitar being very big in Spain): pulgar (thumb),
indice (index), medio (middle), and anular (ring). Sometimes you see the
English equivalents of t, i, m, and r. You don’t ordinarily use the little finger
of the right hand in fingerstyle playing.

Chapter 12: Folk

Using the Capo
A capo is a device that clamps down across the fingerboard at a particular
fret. Capos can operate by means of elastic, springs, or even threaded bolts,
but they all serve the same purpose — they shorten the length of all the
strings at the same time, creating, in effect, a new nut. All the “open” strings
now play in higher pitches than they do without the capo.
How much higher? A half step for each fret. If you place the capo at the third
fret, for example, the open E strings become Gs (three half steps higher in pitch
than E). All the strings become correspondingly higher in pitch as well — B
becomes D; G becomes B%; D becomes F; and A becomes C. (By the way, you
can’t play anything below the capo — only above it on the neck.)
To correctly set the capo, place it just before the third fret (toward the tuning
pegs), not directly over the third metal fret wire. Figure 12-2 shows a capo set
correctly on the guitar at the third fret. See Chapter 16 for more information
on different kinds of capos.
Why should you use a capo? A capo enables you to instantly change the key
of a song. Say that you know how to play “Farmer in the Dell” in the key of C
and only in the key of C. But you want to accompany a singer (maybe your-
self) whose vocal range is better suited for singing “Farmer in the Dell” in the
key of D.
No problem. Put your capo at the second fret and simply play the song in C
as you normally do. The capo causes all the strings to sound two half-steps
higher than normal, and the music sounds in D! In fact, you can move the
capo to any fret, sliding it up and down the neck, until you find the fret (key)
that’s perfect for your vocal range.
Of course, if the notes and chords in the song you’re playing have no open
strings, you can simply change positions on the neck (using movable chords)
to find the best key for singing. Use a capo only if the song requires the use of
open strings.
People also use a capo for a reason that has nothing to do with vocal ranges.
If you place a capo on the neck (especially high on the neck), the guitar has a
brighter sound. It can even sound more like a mandolin (you know, that
teardrop-shaped little stringed instrument that you hear gondoliers play in
films set in Italy).
Capos can prove especially useful if you have two guitarists playing a song
together. One can play the chords without a capo — in the key of C, for exam-
ple. The other guitarist can play the chords in, say, the key of G with a capo at
the fifth fret, sounding in C. The difference in timbre (that is, the tone color or
the quality of the sound) between the two instruments creates a striking effect.
210
Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Some people refer to capos as “cheaters.” They think that if you’re a beginner
who can play only in easy keys (A and D, for example), you need to “cheat”
by using a capo if you want to play in B%. After all, if you’re worth your salt as
a guitarist, you could play in B% without a capo by using barre chords.
But in folk-guitar playing, the combination of open strings and fretted ones is
the essence of the style. Sometimes these open-string/fretted-note combina-
tions can become quite intricate.
Think, for example, of the introduction to “Fire and Rain,” by James Taylor,
which he fingers in the key of A. James plays it, however, by using a capo at
the third fret, causing the music to sound three half-steps higher, in C,
because that key best fits his vocal range. So why not just play the song in C
without a capo? Because the fingering makes that option impossible; the nec-
essary open strings that James plays don’t exist in C — only in A!
One more advantage of using a capo: Because the frets get closer together as
you go up the neck, playing with a capo requires less stretching in the left
hand, making some songs a little easier to play.
Throughout this chapter, as you play the various exercises and songs, experi-
ment with the capo. See how you can use a capo to find the best key for your
vocal range. And even on the instrumental selections, experiment by placing
the capo at various frets to see how that placement affects the timbre. You’re
sure to like what you hear.
Sometimes, engaging or disengaging a capo causes the strings to go out of
tune. Remember to check your tuning and make any necessary adjustments
whenever you attach or remove the capo.

Chapter 12: Folk

Arpeggio Style
To play in arpeggio style (also known as broken chord style), hold down a
chord with your left hand, and play the notes one at a time, in succession,
with your right, allowing the notes to ring out or sustain. This technique pro-
duces a lighter flowing sound to the music than you get by playing all the
notes at once, as you do in strumming. 
Playing arpeggio style
To play in arpeggio style, put your right-hand fingers on the strings in the
basic fingerstyle position — thumb (p) against the 6th string, index finger (i)
against the 3rd string, middle finger (m) against the 2nd string, and ring
finger (a) against the 1st string. All the fingers are now ready to pluck.
Even without actually fingering a left-hand chord (because all the strings
you’re plucking are open strings in an Em chord), you can still play an Em
arpeggio by plucking first p, then i, then m, and finally a. You should hear a
pretty Em chord ringing out.
Just so that you know how this pattern looks in notation, see Figure 12-3,
which shows you exactly how to play the open strings of an Em chord in
arpeggio style.
Now try arpeggiating up (from low-pitched to high-pitched strings) and back
down on the open Em chord. Again use only the 6th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st strings.
Instead of playing just p-i-m-a, as before, play p-i-m-a-m-i. Refer to the notation
in Figure 12-4 to check that you’re playing the correct notes.

Next try fingering the various chords you learned in Chapters 4 and 6, and
playing p-i-m-a or p-i-m-a-m-i. But for each new chord, make sure that your
thumb hits the correct bass string — the root of the chord (the 6th string for
all the E and G chords, the 5th string for all the A and C chords, and the 4th
string for all the D chords). (The root of a chord is simply the note from which
the chord takes its name; for example, the root of a C chord is a C note.)
Many arpeggio patterns are possible, because you can pluck the strings in
lots of different orders. The p-i-m-a and the p-i-m-a-m-i patterns are two of the
most common.
To play a song right now using the p-i-m-a-m-i arpeggio pattern, skip to the
section “Playing Folk Songs,” later in this chapter, and check out “House of
the Rising Sun.”
“Lullaby” pattern
Some guitarists refer to the accompaniment pattern shown in Figure 12-5 as
the “lullaby” pattern because it’s a pretty-sounding pattern suitable for play-
ing accompaniments to lullabies.
This pattern incorporates a double-stop (two notes sounded at once; see
Chapter 7) into an arpeggio pattern. After playing p and i individually, you
play m and a together (at the same time) on the top two strings. Remember
to hold down each chord with the left hand while the notes ring out. Again,
use the capo to find your best key for singing.
To play a song right now by using the “lullaby” pattern, skip to the section

Raging.”

Thumb-Brush Style
The thumb-brush style is an accompaniment pattern that has a “boom-chick”
sound. Here, the thumb plays normally (plucking a bass string downward),
but the fingers strike (brush) the top three or four strings with the backs of
the nails in a downward motion (toward the floor). The fingers actually strum
the strings as a pick does but without you moving your arm or your whole
hand. Basically, you curl your fingers into your palm and then quickly extend
them, changing from a closed-hand position to an open-hand position, strik-
ing the strings with the nails in the process.
Simple thumb-brush
Figure 12-6 shows two measures of the thumb-brush pattern on a C chord.
Don’t worry about hitting exactly three strings with the finger brush. Getting
a smooth, flowing motion in the right hand is more important.

Thumb-brush-up
A variation of the simple thumb-brush is the thumb-brush-up (which yields a
“boom-chick-y” sound). After strumming with the backs of the nails of the
middle and ring fingers, you use the flesh of your index finger to pluck the
1st string (upward). You invariably perform this technique in an eighth-note
rhythm on beats 2 and 4 (one, two-and, three, four-and). (See Appendix A for
more information on eighth notes.)
Figure 12-7 shows a two-measure pattern using the thumb-brush-up technique.
Keep the down- and upstrokes steady, with no break in the rhythm. (Make
sure that you listen to the CD for this one, and don’t be discouraged if this 
pattern takes a little getting used to.)
Don’t think of the upstroke with the finger as a fingerpicking move, but as an
upward brush with the whole hand. In other words, keep the right hand loose
and flowing as you pull it upward to strike the 1st string with your first finger.
You can use the thumb-brush or thumb-brush-up pattern for any song that
has a “boom-chick” or “boom-chick-y” sound, such as “Jingle Bells” or “I’ve
Been Working on the Railroad.”
Carter Style
In Carter style (named after the famous Carter family, whose members included
June Carter, “Mother” Maybelle, and “Uncle” A.P.), you play the melody on the
low strings with the thumb while the fingers provide an accompaniment in the
form of brushes. This style works well for songs with melody notes that fall
mostly on beats 1 and 3. (The brushes occur on beats 2 and 4.) But if a melody
note falls on beat 2 or 4, you can simply omit the brush on that beat.

Chapter 12: Folk

You can play this style just as easily by using a pick as you can with the fin-
gers, so try it both ways and see which is more comfortable for you.
Figure 12-8 shows a passage that you can play by using Carter style, where
the melody falls entirely on the lower strings. The melody comes from a 
traditional melody, called “Wildwood Flower,” that the Carter family made
famous. Woody Guthrie wrote his own lyrics and called it “The Sinking of
the Ruben James.”
To play a song right now in Carter style, skip to the section “Playing Folk
Songs,” later in this chapter, and check out the tune “Gospel Ship.”
Travis Picking
Travis picking, named after country guitarist Merle Travis, is probably the
most popular fingerstyle folk technique. Here, the thumb alternates between
two (and sometimes three) bass strings in steady quarter notes while the fin-
gers pluck the treble (higher) strings, usually between the quarter notes (on
the off-beats). The result is a driving, rhythmic feel that you can use for a
variety of settings from ragtime to blues, to the rolling 4/4 accompaniment
pattern that you hear in Simon and Garfunkel’s “The Boxer” and Kansas’s
“Dust in the Wind.”
This technique is more complex than the ones we discuss in the preceding
sections, so we’re going to show you how to play it step by step.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Playing the pattern
You can create different Travis patterns by varying the timing that you use to
hit the treble strings. What remains the same is the steady rhythm that you
play with the thumb. One pattern of treble strings is so popular that we’re
calling it the “basic Travis pattern.” You can play it by following these steps:
1. Start out by fingering a D chord with your left hand and hold the
chord down throughout the measure.
2. Using only your thumb, alternate between picking the 4th and 3rd
strings in steady quarter notes, as shown in Figure 12-9a.
The thumb part is the foundation of the pattern. The standard notation
marks the thumb part by using downstems (descending vertical lines
attached to the noteheads). Play this thumb part several times so that
it’s rock steady.
3. Now add the 2nd string to the pattern by plucking it with your index
finger after beat 2 (between the thumb notes), as shown in Figure 12-9b.
Make sure that the 2nd string continues to ring as your thumb hits the
4th string on beat 3. Play this partial pattern several times until it feels
natural. Listen to the CD for the rhythm.
4. Now add the 1st string to the pattern by plucking it with your middle
finger after beat 3 (between the thumb notes), as shown in Figure 12-9c.
Play this partial pattern several times until it feels comfortable.
5. Finally, add the 1st string (which you play by using the middle finger)
to beat 1, playing the 4th string simultaneously with your thumb, as
shown in Figure 12-9d.
In Travis picking, playing a treble string and bass string together is
known as a pinch.
A variation of the basic pattern is sometimes called the roll. This pattern uses
no pinches, and you pluck every off-beat, as shown in Figure 12-9e. Typically,
you play the last off-beat only if you don’t change chords as you go to the
next measure. If you do change chords, leave out the last off-beat.
You can create other variations of the basic pattern by adding or omitting
pinches and off-beats — but never omit the thumb notes. You can create
these variations as you go, using them to break the monotony of one pattern
that you otherwise repeat over and over.
For the basic Travis pattern, an easy way to remember which strings to hit
and the order in which to hit them is to think of the four-note group of strings
you pluck as a set of outside strings and a set of inside strings. On the D chord,
for example, the 1st and 4th strings are “outside” and the 2nd and 3rd strings
217
Chapter 12: Folk

are “inside.” Look at Figure 12-9d again. Say the following phrase as you play:
“Pinch, insides, outsides, thumb.” The following steps relate this phrase to
the corresponding actions that you take:
1. Pinch: On beat 1, play the outside strings (4th and 1st) as a pinch — the
thumb striking the 4th string and the middle finger striking the 1st simul-
taneously.
2. Insides: On beat 2, play the inside strings (3rd and 2nd) one at a time —
the thumb striking first and then the index finger.
3. Outsides: On beat 3, play the outside strings (4th and 1st) one at a
time — the thumb striking first and then the middle finger.
4. Thumb: On beat 4, play just the thumb on the bass string of the inside
set (the 3rd string).
Note that you don’t normally use your ring finger when playing Travis patterns.

Accompaniment style
After you know the basic pattern, you can create an entire accompaniment to
a song by simply stringing together a series of chords and applying the
appropriate pattern for each chord. You can play the pattern for any chord
by memorizing the following information:
 Which group of four strings to play for each chord. (See the chart shown
in Figure 12-10.)
 Which right-hand fingers to use on those strings. (The thumb and
middle finger play the outside strings, the thumb and index finger play
the inside strings.)
 The phrase “pinch, insides, outsides, thumb.” By using this phrase, you
can play any pattern for any chord.
Figure 12-10 shows which four strings you can use for various chords and
identifies the “inside” and “outside” strings for each group. Try the groups
indicated for each chord, playing both the basic pattern and the roll.

To play a song right now by using Travis-style accompaniment, skip to the sec-
tion “Playing Folk Songs,” later in this chapter, and check out “All My Trials.”
Solo style
You can use Travis picking to create exciting instrumental solos by placing
the song’s melody in the treble (as pinches or off-beats) while the bass —
along with other, strategically placed off-beats — provides an accompani-
ment. In this solo style, you don’t necessarily play strict four-string groupings
(as you would in accompaniment style) — the melody pretty much dictates
the groupings, which sometimes expand to five strings.
Figure 12-11 shows how a melody — in this case, “Oh Susanna” — plays in a
solo Travis picking style. Notice that beats 1 and 2 in each bar are pinches
(the thumb and finger play the strings together), because both the melody
and bass fall on these beats. Other melody notes fall on the off-beats, coming
in between bass notes.
To play a song right now by using Travis solo style, skip to the section
“Playing Folk Songs,” later in this chapter, and check out “Freight Train.”
Open tuning
You can create some interesting effects if you Travis pick in open tunings.
Figure 12-12 is a passage in open-G tuning (D-G-D-G-B-D, low pitched to high)
that sounds like something Joni Mitchell may have played on one of her early
albums. The only unusual thing here is that you tune the guitar differently.
Nothing in the right hand changes from a normal Travis pick.
To get into open-G tuning follow these steps:
1. Drop your 6th string until it sounds an octave lower than the open 4th
string.

tion about producing harmonics). Think “pinch, insides, outsides, thumb”

Chapter 12: Folk

A harmonic is a pretty, high-pitched, bell-like tone that you produce by lightly
touching a string (with the fleshy part of a left-hand finger) at a certain fret
(usually the twelfth, seventh, or fifth) directly over the metal fret wire rather
than in front of it, as you would when fretting normally, and then striking the
string.
Playing Folk Songs
The range of songs that we present here runs the gamut from a simple accom-
paniment pattern that you repeat over and over to a solo-style treatment of a
tune, with independent bass, superimposed melody on top, and a couple of
tricks thrown in. In these five songs, you find just about every fingerpicking
approach possible that’s appropriate for songs in the folk vein. Don’t let the
simple nature of the songs themselves deceive you, however; the guitar parts
here make them sound full and complete. After you get these arrangements
down, all you need is the requisite flannel shirt and hiking boots and you’re on
your way to a career in hoboing, labor organizing, and political protest.
Here is some information about the songs to help you along. Some of the
songs employ a technique known as a bass run. This technique is a single-
note line — played by the thumb — that leads to the next chord and serves
to break up the monotony of a repeated pattern.
 House of the Rising Sun: To play “House of the Rising Sun,” you need to
know how to play an up-and-down arpeggio pattern (see the section
“Arpeggio Style,” earlier in this chapter); how to finger basic major and
minor chords (see Chapter 4); and how to make a song about a wasted
life in a house of ill repute sound light and frothy.
The up-and-down arpeggio pattern (p-i-m-a-m-i) makes a nice accompani-
ment for “House of the Rising Sun” and other songs like it. Your left hand
should hold down each chord for the entire measure. Think broken
chords (where the notes ring out) and not individual notes (where the
notes stop short). Notice that the fingers play only the top three strings
for every chord in the song, even though the thumb changes strings
from chord to chord.
 The Cruel War Is Raging: To play “The Cruel War Is Raging,” you need to
know how to play the “lullaby” pattern (see the section “Arpeggio Style,”
earlier in this chapter); how to finger basic major and minor chords (see
Chapter 4); and how to coo a baby to sleep with a song about annihila-
tion and destruction.
Remember to hold down each chord with the left hand while the notes
ring out. Use a capo to find your best key for singing.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

 Gospel Ship: To play “Gospel Ship,” you need to know how to play a
Carter-style solo (see the section “Carter Style,” earlier in this chapter);
how to play hammer-ons and pull-offs (see Chapter 9); and whether any
person on the planet actually knows the lyrics to this song.
Hammer-ons, pull-offs, and bass runs are an important part of Carter
style, as you see in this arrangement, loosely based on the traditional
song “Gospel Ship.” (See Chapter 9 for more information on hammer-ons
and pull-offs.) The standard notation helps you determine which notes
you play with the thumb (the ones with the stems going down) and
which you play with the fingers (the ones with the stems going up). This
song works equally well, however, if you use a pick. Try it both ways.
 All My Trials: To play “All My Trials,” you need to know how to play a
Travis-style accompaniment (see the section “Travis Picking,” earlier in
this chapter); how to play hammer-ons (see Chapter 9); and how to con-
vincingly sing a song about toil and hardship without sounding preten-
tious because you’ve led a life of relative ease and privilege.
Measure 1 uses the lower string group for the G chord, because if you
use the higher set, you end up with an incomplete chord. Because mea-
sure 2 has only two beats, you play only half the pattern in that measure.
Measure 5 begins as if you’re using the higher string set (to smoothly
resolve the high note of the previous bar), but then on beat 2, it
switches to the lower string set, again to avoid an incomplete chord.
Measure 9 incorporates a little bass line into the pattern on the way
from G to Em. In measure 12, a pinched hammer-on adds an extra-folky
flavor.
 Freight Train: To play “Freight Train,” you need to know how to play a
Travis-style solo (see the section “Travis Picking,” earlier in this chap-
ter); how to play hammer-ons (see Chapter 9); and how to sound like a
simple hobo while playing a sophisticated fingerpicking arrangement
with four new techniques.
A bass run breaks up the monotony in measures 4 and 8. In measure 9,
you’re fingering an E chord, and you can use your first finger, flattened
into a barre, to play the 1st string, first fret. Use your left thumb,
wrapped around the neck, to finger the 6th string in bars 11 and 12.
Measure 14 features a fancy little trick — you hammer a treble note at
the same time that you strike a bass note. In measure 15, the bass alter-
nates among three notes, not two.

C
lassical guitar not only suggests a certain musical style, but also implies
an approach to the instrument that’s quite different from that of any
other style, whether folk, jazz, rock, or blues. Classical guitar encompasses a
long tradition of techniques and practices that composers and performers
have observed through the ages and to which they still adhere, even with the
advent of more modern and avant-garde musical compositions.
To play the great music of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven — and to have it
sound authentic — you must play it in the classical style. Even if you have no
intention of becoming a serious classical guitarist, you can improve your
tone, technique, and phrasing by practicing classical techniques.
Don’t get the impression that, because it adheres to certain disciplines, clas-
sical music is all rigid rules and regulations. Many guitarists with careers in
both the pop and classical fields feel that some aspects of classical guitar
playing are liberating, and these rugged individualists have actually tried to
infuse classical techniques into pop and rock playing. Steve Howe of Yes,
Michael Hedges, and Chet Atkins have each appropriated classical tech-
niques into their own inimitable styles. Still, we can’t quite picture Metallica
having the same headbanging effect if they were to perch on straight-backed
chairs with left legs raised and wrists folded at right angles.
In this chapter, we get serious about classical guitar and present the correct sit-
ting position and the proper right- and left-hand positions. In addition, we show
you how to combine melodies to create counterpoint and how to use rest
strokes and free strokes to bring out a melody from within an arpeggio pattern.

Getting Ready to Play Classical Guitar
You always play classical guitar on a nylon-string guitar (as opposed to the
steel-string models used for many other styles), in a sitting position. Beyond
that, you must employ certain right-hand strokes (methods of plucking the
strings) to get the expected sound. In addition, you must adopt a new
approach to left-hand positioning.
How to sit
Real classical guitarists (that is, most real classical guitarists) sit differently
from other guitarists in that they hold the guitar on the left leg instead of on
the right one. They also elevate the left leg about six inches by using a foot-
stool. If you perform this balancing act, you accomplish the following goals:
 You rest the guitar’s treble side (the side closer to the higher-pitched
strings) on the left leg, with the back of the instrument resting against
your abdomen. The weight of your right arm on the bass side holds the
instrument in place (balanced, so to speak). Your hands are thus com-
pletely free to play — and only play. You don’t need to use your hands to
keep the guitar from falling to the floor (unless you jump up suddenly to
answer the phone).
 You position the guitar so that the left hand can play any fret at the cor-
rect (perpendicular) angle — see the “Left-hand position” section later
in the chapter. This allows you to play the higher positions (seventh and
up) more easily than you can in the steel-string acoustic sitting position
(see Chapter 3).
The truth is, however, that a lot of people who attempt classical guitar simply
don’t even bother with all this stuff about how to hold the instrument. Why?
Because it’s too much trouble. Where would you even get a footstool? (Okay,
you can get one at your local music store — maybe.) If you just want to try
out a few classical-guitar pieces for the fun of it, hold the guitar as you nor-
mally do. The music police aren’t likely to arrest you, and you can still hear
the beautiful arrangement of the notes, even if you’re not playing strictly “by
the rules.”
However, if you’re really serious about playing classical guitar, buy a footstool
and refer to Figure 13-1, which shows the correct sitting position. You can also
use a special gizmo that pushes the guitar up from your leg, enabling you to
keep both feet flat on the floor. These devices are gaining popularity because
they don’t create the uneven pull on your leg and back muscles that often
results from elevating one leg and keeping the other flat. Oh, and if you want
to pursue classical guitar, learn to read music (if you can’t already), because
lots of printed classical guitar music comes without tab. (Check out Appendix
A to get started in music reading.)
232
Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

What’s important is to make sure that you sit upright and at the edge of the
chair, elevating your left leg (or the guitar) and holding the instrument at the
center of your body. Keep the head of the guitar (where the tuning pegs con-
nect) at about the same height as your shoulder, as shown in Figure 13-1.
The right hand
After posture, your right-hand approach is the most critical consideration for
achieving a true classical guitar sound. You must play with your right hand in
the correct position and execute the correct finger strokes.
Right-hand position
The most important concept about right-hand position is that you hold your
fingers — index, middle, and ring — perpendicular to the strings as they
strike. (You normally don’t use the little finger in classical guitar.)
This positioning is no easy feat. Why? Because your hand, which is an exten-
sion of your arm, naturally falls at about a 60-degree angle to the strings. Try
it. See? But if you hold your fingers at an angle, you can’t get maximum volume
from the strings. To get the strongest sound (which you need to do to bring
out melodies from the bass and inner voices), you must strike the strings at a
90-degree angle — perpendicular.

Chapter 13: Classical

Rotate your right hand at the wrist so that the fingers fall perpendicular to the
strings and your thumb stays about 11⁄2 inches to the left (from your vantage
point) of your index finger, as shown in Figure 13-2. Rest your right-hand thumb
and fingers (index, middle, and ring) on the 6th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st strings,
respectively, as shown in the figure. This setup is the basic classical-guitar
position for the right hand. Are your fingers perpendicular to the strings?
If you’re serious about perfecting classical right-hand technique, here’s a tip to
force your fingers into the correct position: Place all four fingers (thumb, index,
middle, and ring) on the same string (the 3rd, say), lining them up in a row. By
positioning your fingers this way, your thumb can’t rest to the right of your
index finger. Then, without turning your hand, move each finger to its normal
place: thumb to the 6th string, index staying on the 3rd, middle to the 2nd, and
ring to the 1st. Refer to Figure 13-2 to make sure that your thumb is in the cor-
rect position with respect to the fingers (to the side and not behind them).
The fingernails
Your right-hand fingernails affect the tone of your playing. If your nails are
very short, only the flesh of your finger hits the string, and the resulting tone
is rather mellow and soft. Conversely, if your nails are very long, only the nail
hits the string, and the tone is sharper and more metallic. Most classical gui-
tarists grow their nails somewhat long so that both the flesh and the nail hit
the string at the same time, producing a pleasing, well-rounded tone.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Some guitarists own a special fingernail-care kit that contains scissors or clip-
pers, nail files, emery boards, and fine abrasive cloths to enable them to keep
their nails at a desired length, shape, and smoothness.
If you’re serious about playing classical guitar, grow your nails a bit long and
cut them so that they’re rounded, following the same contour as your finger-
tips. Then file or buff them with a nail file or emery board. Grow only the
right-hand nails. You must keep the left-hand nails short so that they don’t hit
the fretboard as you press down the strings, preventing the notes from
sounding out correctly. But if you’re playing classical guitar casually, for fun
or just to try it out, don’t worry about the length of your right-hand nails.
Lots of people play classical guitar with short nails (and with the guitar set
on their right leg, too!).
Changing tone color
You can alter the tone color of the strings by placing your right hand at differ-
ent points along the string — closer to the bridge or closer to the fretboard
or directly over the sound hole. If you play directly over the sound hole, the
tone is full and rich. As you move toward the bridge, the tone becomes
brighter and more metallic; and as you move toward the fretboard, the tone
becomes more rounded and mellow.
Why do you need to change timbre (tone color)? Mostly for the sake of variety. If
you’re playing a piece with a section that repeats, you may play over the sound
hole for the first pass and then on the repeat play closer to the bridge. Or
maybe you’re approaching the climax in a piece and you want to heighten the
effect by playing with a brighter, more metallic sound. You can then play closer
to the bridge. Printed classical guitar music often indicates these positions, and
you can clearly hear the changes in recordings of classical guitar pieces.
Left-hand position
As you’re fingering frets in the classical style, try to think of your left hand as
a piece of machinery that you lock into one position — a position that you
can characterize by right angles and perpendicularity (to achieve ease of
playing and optimal sound). As you move up and down the neck or across
the strings, the little machine never changes its appearance. You simply
move it along the two directions of a grid — as you would an Etch-a-Sketch.
Here’s how the machine works:
 Keep your fingers rounded and arched so that the tips come down to the
fingerboard at a 90-degree angle and place them perpendicular to the
strings.
 Straighten your thumb and keep it pretty much opposite the index finger
as you lightly press it against the back of the guitar neck. As you move
to higher frets, bring your thumb along, always keeping it opposite the
235
Chapter 13: Classical

index finger. You can move it across the neck as your fingers do, but
don’t ever allow it to creep above the fingerboard.
 Move your arm with your hand so that your hand stays perpendicular to
the strings. As you play the lower frets, keep your elbow out, away from
your body. At the higher frets, bring your elbow in, closer to your body.
Theoretically, no matter what string or fret you play, your left hand position
looks the same — as shown in Figure 13-3. Of course, special requirements of
the music could force you to abandon the basic left-hand position from time
to time. So think of the preceding guidelines as just that: guidelines.
If you’ve been playing other guitar styles (such as rock or blues) for a while,
you probably often see your left thumb tip coming all the way around the
neck, sticking out above the 6th string. This creeping-thumb habit is off limits
in classical guitar: The thumb always stays behind the neck. Fortunately, we
have a good way to cure you of this habit (although you must be willing to
suffer a little pain). Have a friend hold a sharp object (such as a pencil) while
watching you play. Every time your thumb peeks out from behind the neck,
have your friend lightly poke your thumb with the sharp object! This training
method may hurt a bit, but after a few pokes, your thumb stays tucked away
behind the neck, where it belongs. This method is how children in Charles
Dickens’ time learned correct left-hand technique.

Free Strokes and Rest Strokes
If you had a golf or bowling coach, he’d probably lecture you on the impor-
tance of a good follow-through. Well, believe it or not, the same thing’s true in
plucking a guitar string. Your finger can follow through after plucking a string
in one of two ways, giving you two kinds of strokes. One is the free stroke,
which you use for arpeggios and fast scale passages. The other, the rest
stroke, you use for accentuating melody notes. The thumb, however, virtually
always plays free strokes, even when playing melodies. (Free strokes are used
in both classical and folk playing; rest strokes are unique to classical guitar.)
The following sections describe both strokes.
Playing free strokes
If you pluck a string at a slightly upward angle, your finger comes to rest in
the air, above the next adjacent string. (Of course, it doesn’t stay there for
long, because you must return it to its normal starting position to pluck
again.) This type of stroke, where your finger dangles freely in the air, is
called a free stroke. Figure 13-4, with its before and after pictures, shows you
how to play a free stroke.
In classical guitar, you use free strokes for playing nonmelodic material, such
as arpeggios (chords played one note at a time instead of all at once). Try
arpeggiating the open strings (thumb on the 6th string, index finger on the
3rd, middle on the 2nd, and ring on the 1st), using all free strokes.
Figure 13-5 is an excerpt from a Spanish piece, “Malagueña,” that just about
every guitar player picks up at some time or other. You play the melody with
the thumb while the middle finger plays free strokes on the open high-E string.

237
Chapter 13: Classical

Classical guitar notation indicates the right-hand fingers by the letters p, i, m,
and a, which stand for the first letters of the Spanish names for the fingers: The
thumb is p (pulgar), the index is i (indice), the middle is m (media), and the
ring is a (anular). You also see these notations used in fingerstyle folk guitar.
Playing rest strokes
The rest stroke uses a different kind of follow-through from the free stroke.
Instead of striking the string at a slightly upward angle, pluck straight across
(not upward) so that your finger lands, or rests, against the adjacent lower-
pitched string. By coming straight across the string (instead of coming across
at an upward angle), you get the maximum sound out of the string. That’s why
rest strokes are good for melody notes; the melody notes are the prominent
ones — the ones that you want to accentuate.
Figure 13-6, with its before and after pictures, shows how to play a rest stroke. 
Use rest strokes to accentuate melody notes in a classical piece that includes
inner voices — filler or background notes on the middle strings (played with
free strokes) — and bass notes.

Play the two-octave C major scale shown in Figure 13-7 slowly, using all rest
strokes. Change from second to fifth position at the end of measure 1 by
smoothly gliding your first finger along the 3rd string, up to the fifth fret. (See
Chapter 7 for more information on playing in position.) On the way down,
shift back to second position by smoothly gliding your third finger along the
3rd string, down to the fourth fret. Alternate between i (index finger) and m
(middle finger) as you go.
For the sake of speed and accuracy, alternating between two right-hand fin-
gers (usually i and m) is customary for playing classical-guitar melodies.

Chapter 13: Classical

Arpeggio Style and Contrapuntal Style
You play most classical guitar pieces in either an arpeggio style or a contra-
puntal style. In arpeggio style, you hold chords with the left hand while pluck-
ing the strings in succession with your right hand (so that each string rings
out and sustains). Usually, you simultaneously play a melody on the top
strings (using rest strokes) over the arpeggios.
Contrapuntal classical guitar music usually has two parts — a bass part that
you play with the thumb, and a treble part (the melody) that you play (usu-
ally by using free strokes) with alternating fingers (for example, i and m). The
word contrapuntal refers to the counterpoint style, where you play two or more
melodies (usually with different or contrasting rhythms) simultaneously —
sort of like what you get if two people with opposing ideas talk at the same
time. In music, however, the separate lines support rather than negate each
other. Imagine if political debates had that effect.
Combining free strokes and 
rest strokes in arpeggios
Figure 13-8 shows an exercise in arpeggio style. You play the first note of each
measure and the notes with stems that point down in the standard notation
with the thumb; the other notes you play with the fingers (i on the 3rd string,
m on the 2nd, and a on the 1st). 
The notes that you play on the 1st string have an accent mark (>) over them in
standard notation. Accent marks tell you to accentuate (or stress) certain notes
by playing them louder to bring them to the fore. In other words, use the more
powerful rest stroke for accented notes and free strokes for all other notes. The
sim. means to keep playing the same fingering pattern throughout the exercise.
Remember to hold down all the notes of each measure simultaneously with
the left hand, for the duration of the measure.
Before combining rest strokes and free strokes, play Figure 13-8 using all free
strokes to get the feel of the piece. After you’re comfortable with it, add the
rest strokes to the notes on the 1st string.
Point/counterpoint
Figure 13-9 is an excerpt from a composition by an unknown composer of the
Baroque era — an era during which contrapuntal music was very popular.
Play the downstem notes (in the standard notation) by using the thumb. Use
alternating fingers (free strokes) to play the melody.
240
Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

The piece doesn’t indicate any particular right-hand fingering. As long as you
apply the concept of alternating fingers (even loosely) to attain speed and
accuracy, you can use whatever fingering feels most comfortable to you. No
single way is really right or wrong.
We do indicate the left-hand fingering, however, because this particular fin-
gering is the only one that’s feasible for this piece. The slanted line in front of
the 2 on the second beat of measure 3 and the third beat of measure 5 indi-
cates that you’re using the same finger you used to play the previous note.
Practice by playing only the top part with the (alternating) fingers a few
times. Then play the bass line alone with the thumb a few times. Then play
both parts simultaneously. Listen to the CD to help you with the rhythm.

Playing Classical Pieces
Playing classical guitar pieces is never a hassle because you don’t need to
sing and you don’t need an amplifier. You can do it any time, any place (as
long as you have a nylon-string guitar).
Standard classical guitar notation uses some special symbols for indicating
barre chords (see Chapter 8 for more information on barre chords). The
symbol C with a Roman numeral after it indicates a barre across all six
strings. (The Roman numeral tells you which fret to barre.) A C with a line (|)
through it indicates a partial barre (fewer than six strings). And a dotted hori-
zontal line to the right of the C tells you how long to hold down the barre.
The songs that you play in this chapter are ones that all classical players
meet at one time or another. They’re great if you want a life full of Romanza
that’s always exciting and never Bourrée.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

 Romanza: To play “Romanza,” you need to know how to play free
strokes and rest strokes (see the section “Free Strokes and Rest
Strokes,” earlier in this chapter); how to barre chords (check out
Chapter 8); and how to roll your Rs while saying “Romanza” (to sound
truly continental).
“Romanza” is a simple arpeggiated piece that gives you an opportunity
to accentuate the melody notes with rest strokes (all of which you play
on the 1st string with the a finger). For practice, you can play the piece
by using all free stokes, adding the rest strokes later. Use the thumb to
play all the bass notes (downstems in the standard notation). Use the
right-hand fingering that we give you in the first measure throughout the
piece. In measures 9–10, make sure that you keep your first finger barred
at the seventh fret with your second finger pressing down at the eighth
fret (3rd string) the whole time. Stretch your little finger up to the eleventh
fret for the first beat of measure 10. Note that this is reflected in the left-
hand fingering indications. 
 Bourrée in E minor: To play “Bourrée in E minor,” you need to know
how to play a melody by using alternating fingers while playing a bass
line with the thumb (see the section “Point/counterpoint,” earlier in this
chapter); how to barre chords (see Chapter 8); and how to pronounce
and spell bourrée.
A bourrée is a dance people did a couple hundred years ago (just
slightly before the advent of the “funky chicken”). This contrapuntual
piece is an excerpt that’s loads of fun to play because it sounds beautiful
and intricate, but it’s actually rather simple to play. Leo Kottke plays a
fingerstyle version of it, and Jethro Tull did a jazz arrangement of it. Play
all the bass notes (downstems in the standard notation) by using the
thumb. Alternate fingers (for example, m-i-m-i and so on) with the right
hand. The alternation doesn’t need to be strict. Use what feels the most
comfortable to you. We indicate some left-hand fingerings at the very
beginning to get you going. After that, use whatever fingering feels nat-
ural. For inspiration, listen to recordings of this piece by classical gui-
tarist John Williams, as well as the folk version by Kottke and the
swing-jazz version by Jethro Tull. Heavy metal guitarist Yngwie (pro-
nounce ING-vay) Malmsteen even does a version with ear-splitting stun-
gun distortion. Although J.S. Bach never imagined all these wacky
settings for his unprepossessing little dance suite segment, they all
sound great.

Jazz
In This Chapter
 Understanding what jazz guitar means
 Jazz rhythm comping
 Playing jazz solo pieces
 Playing jazz lead
 Playing jazz songs
Jazz is a form of music that instrumentalists created when they began
taking liberties with existing song forms, improvising off composed
melodies, and varying harmonic structures. Guitarists followed the early
efforts of other instrumentalists like the great trumpeter Louis Armstrong,
who was one of the first early masters of melodic improvisation.
Jazz guitar can be difficult to master because improvisation (making up music
on the spot) is such an important part of the style. Normally, making up the
music is the job of the composer. But in jazz, the performers are (usually)
expected to improvise — and to do that well, you need to know far more than
what you could learn in one chapter of a For Dummies book! But fret not. We
show you some simple things to make you sound like a jazz guitarist, which
will help to get you on your way.
In this chapter, we put on our shades and help you get hip to jazz chords, jazz
progressions, chord melody style, chord substitutions, and single-note lead
playing. We also show you the difference between inside and outside chords,
and how to jazz up a melody.

Introducing a Whole New Harmony
Jazz guitar differs from rock and blues guitar most significantly in the follow-
ing ways:
 Jazz guitar uses no distortion, favoring a softer, mellower tone.
 Jazz melodies are more harmonically sophisticated, observing more
closely the chord constructions — which are themselves more complex.
 Jazz lines often employ more skips (musical distances of more than a
step — for example, A to C) than rock or blues lines do.
A jazz guitarist’s approach to chords is deeper than a rock or blues player’s.
In rock and blues, guitarists typically use one scale to play over all the chords,
but in jazz, they may use many scales. They also must be aware of the notes
that make up each chord, as arpeggiating, or playing chord tones in succes-
sion, is a hallmark of the jazz sound.
Most of the music you hear — pop, rock, blues, folk, and classical (especially
classical music from the 17th and 18th centuries, like that of Bach and
Mozart) — relies on traditional harmony (basic chords and progressions, like
those found in Chapters 4 through 13). But jazz harmony uses what most
people call (big surprise) jazz chords. Jazz chords often contain more notes
than basic chords, or sometimes they can have the same number of notes as
basic chords, but one or more of their notes is chromatically altered (raised
or lowered a half step). 
Extended chords
Simple major and minor chords are made up of only three notes (the 1st, 3rd,
and 5th degrees of the major or minor scale whose starting note is the same
as the chord’s root). (For more on scale degrees and building chords see
Chapter 10.) These chords are called triads (three notes). Seventh chords are
made up of four notes — the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th degrees of the chord’s
namesake scale.
In jazz you find chords made up of five or more notes. By continuing to take
every other scale degree, you can go beyond the 7th to create 9th chords
(using the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th degrees), 11th chords (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th,
9th, and 11th) and 13th chords (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th).
These chords that include notes beyond the 7th are called extended chords.
Usually, not all the members of an extended chord are actually played. For
example, in a 13th chord, you might play only four or five of the seven notes,
so it’s possible to play a 13th chord using only four strings.
248
Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Altered chords
Jazz chords often contain notes that are altered (raised or lowered a half
step). These alterations produce all sorts of funny-sounding chord names,
like C7%9, B%13#11, and G7#5. And each of these jazz chords — and there are
dozens of them — has a unique sound.
In playing jazz versions of popular songs, altered chords are usually substi-
tuted for more traditional chords — but knowing which chord to substitute,
and when, is no easy feat, and requires the skill of an accomplished jazz musi-
cian. (For more on substituting chords, see “Making Substitutions,” later in
the chapter.) Also, turn to the “Playing Jazz Songs” section in this chapter to
see some typical chord substitutions.
Rhythm Comping
Comping is the term jazz players use when referring to playing the back-
ground or accompaniment. For the guitarist, comping translates into rhythm
guitar — playing the chords. Jazz guitarists generally employ inside chords,
outside chords, and full chords, which we explain in the following sections.
Inside chords
Inside chords are chords that don’t use the 1st (high E) string. They’re usually
four-note chords played on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and either 5th or 6th strings.
Jazz guitarists love to play inside chords — and there are lots of them.
Inside voicings 
Figure 14-1 shows 15 typical inside jazz-chord voicings. Voicing is the particu-
lar arrangement of notes in a chord chosen over another arrangement to suit
a musical purpose or situation. Each chord in Figure 14-1 is movable and is
shown at the lowest possible position on the neck. To produce other chords
of the same type, just move the chord one fret for each half step. For exam-
ple, the first chord shown is B7#9. To play C7#9, move the chord up one fret.
Some of the chord names may be strange looking. This is how to pronounce
the first three, left to right along the top row (after that you should have the
hang of it): “B seven sharp nine,” “B seven flat nine,” and “F sharp six nine.” A
little circle in a chord name (”) stands for “diminished.” The next-to-last
chord (in the bottom line) is pronounced “F sharp diminished seven.”

Chapter 14: Jazz

If you do nothing more than strum some of these chords, you sound jazzy
right away. Actually, jazz players especially like to finger these chords around
the middle of the neck, or slightly above it (usually between, say, the fourth
and eleventh frets). Try strumming them there.
Inside moves
Jazz guitarists like to exercise good voice leading; that is, they like their chord
changes to sound smooth and economical. Often in jazz progressions, the only
difference between one chord and the next is that one of the notes has moved
a fret or two (see Figures 14-2 and 14-4). This economy of movement makes the
music easier to play and, at the same time, makes the music sound pleasing.
Figure 14-2 shows three typical moves (progressions) consisting of inside chords
that jazz players use. Play each chord once, and then play the next chord — you
sound just like a jazz player. Try the progressions at different frets — these
moves are movable!
Outside chords
Outside chord is a term used for a chord, especially a jazz chord, that uses
only the top four strings — the low E and A strings get the night off. With out-
side chords, you often don’t have the root (the note the chord is named after)
on the bottom, or you don’t include a root at all.

lowest possible position on the neck, and each is movable. Try playing them
somewhere between the fourth and eleventh frets, where jazz guitarists most
like to play these chords.

voice leading, which is so important in jazz guitar. The last move, Figure 14-4c,

Chapter 14: Jazz

looks like a bit of an exception because you must jump around the neck, but
this is a pretty common move. You can take the diminished-7th chord shape
and move it up or down three frets without changing the chord (you’re
changing the voicing, or order of the notes, but you’re still playing the same
four notes). When jazz guitarists play a diminished 7th chord, they often
move it up the neck in this fashion for the sake of variety or to provide a
sense of movement.
Full chords
Not all jazz chords are limited to four-note inside or outside chords. Figure 14-5
shows five different full jazz chords (chords that use five or six strings) that
can be played at any fret (but shown here at the lowest possible position).

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Playing Solo: Chord-Melody Style
Chord-melody style, as its name implies, is a jazz solo style that incorporates
both the melody and chords of a song. You can hear this style of playing in
the music of such jazz greats as Johnny Smith, Jim Hall, and Joe Pass. Chord-
melody style often involves jazzing up an existing non-jazz song. Although the
melody of the song is usually played straight (as composed), the performer
changes the chords from traditional ones to jazz versions. These jazz chords,
when they take the place of straight chords, are called substitutions.
Although playing a written-out chord-melody solo isn’t especially difficult,
creating one yourself (which is what jazz guitarists do) is no easy task. For
starters, you need to know how to harmonize (put chords underneath) a
melody; then you need to know how to apply chord substitutions. These
skills go beyond merely playing the guitar — they enter the realm of compos-
ing and arranging. That’s why we’re not going to teach you how to do it.
Instead, we’re going to give you an idea of what’s involved and then show you
an easy way to cheat, so you sound like you’re creating a chord-melody solo.
Then in the “Playing Jazz Songs” section of this chapter, you can play
“Greensleeves” as a chord-melody arrangement by reading the tab.
Making substitutions
Substitutions are jazzy chords that you use in place of straight chords. These
chords come in one of two general forms: 
 Same root: Sometimes you substitute a chord with the same root, but
using an extended version or chromatic alteration (see the “Introducing
a Whole New Harmony” section earlier in the chapter). For example, if
the chord progression of the song starts with C and goes to A7, you
might substitute Cmaj7 and A7%9, just to make it sound jazzy.
 Different root: Other times, you can substitute chords that don’t even
have the same root. Instead, the substitute chord may have other notes
in common with the original. Taking the same example, instead of play-
ing C and A7, you might play something like C6/9 and E%7, because A7
and E%7 have two notes in common (C# and G).
Anyway, there are countless possible chord substitutions you can make, and
it can take years of playing jazz to develop an intuitive feel for knowing which
chords can substitute where.
253
Chapter 14: Jazz

Faking it with three chords
Instead of learning hundreds of substitutions, try faking a chord-melody solo
by using three simple chords. Look again at the first three movable chord
shapes in Figure 14-3: the outside voicings for m7, ”7, and 6/9. Because these
chords have a somewhat ambiguous sound, they usually won’t sound wrong
no matter where you play them, or what order you put them in: They just
sound jazzy.
You can stick with one chord for a while, moving it to different frets — sliding
up or down one fret at a time sounds cool. Or you can switch freely among
the chords, playing them at various frets. Make up the rhythm as you go. If
you like, you can use Figure 14-6 to get started and to see an example of what
we’re talking about. Have fun with it!
Taking the Lead: Jazz Melody
Playing lead in jazz is very similar in approach to playing lead in blues or rock.
You play mostly single-note melodies — either composed or improvised —
and licks (short passages idiomatic to the style). You don’t have to vary your
technique much either; play the notes with a pick, in alternate-picking fash-
ion (see Chapter 5). What does change is the feel and the approach to the
melodies. Vocabulary, phrasing, and tone separate jazz lead playing from
other guitar styles.

Part IV: A Cornucopia of Styles 

Beyond the quality of the chords, you can create a jazz melody or make your
lead playing jazzier sounding by applying a few simple principles. The follow-
ing three techniques can have you sounding like a jazz icon in no time.
Scales with altered tones
One thing jazz does is introduce altered tones, or tones not within the key. In
blues, the notes are added sparingly; in jazz any tone can be altered and
included in the improvised melody. As long as an altered note is resolved
(brought to a logical conclusion via an “in the key” melody note or a chord
tone), any note is fair game.
Figure 14-7 shows a melody played two ways: first in the straight, composed
way; and then with altered tones added. Notice that this figure is in triplet
feel, also called swing feel. Many jazz pieces are played with a swing feel. (For
more information on the triplet feel, see Chapter 11.)

Chapter 14: Jazz

Approaching target notes
Part of jazz’s loose and liquid quality results from the way you sometimes
approach a principal (or target) melody note from one fret above or below. In
doing so, you add spice and variety to your playing.
Figure 14-8 shows a melody played two ways: in its straight context, and then
with principal melody notes approached from a fret above or below (arrows
indicate principal notes).
Making melodies from arpeggiated chords
Sometimes, to produce a jazzy-sounding line, all you have to do is play the
chord tones contained in the rhythm part. Because jazz chords are often
complex — like a C7%9#5 — just playing the chord tones as an arpeggio (one
at a time, in succession) creates instant jazz (see Figure 14-9). In general,
though, good jazz playing incorporates a healthy mix of arpeggios and linear
(stepwise) playing.

Playing Jazz Songs
In the songs that follow, you find a wide range of jazz techniques: extended
chords, altered chords, inside and outside chords, chord substitutions,
altered tones, and melodies formed from arpeggiated chord tones.
You can play “Greensleeves” either with a pick or fingerstyle. Play “Swing
Thing” with a pick (both the chords and the melody). Here are some hints
that will help you understand and play the songs:
 Greensleeves: We treat this old English folksong to a chord-melody solo
arrangement. The straight chords for this song are Em, D, C, B, and so
on, but here, as is typical in a jazz chord-melody arrangement, we’ve
used jazzy chord substitutions. To play this song, you need to know how
to play jazz chord forms, how to combine single-note melody with chords
(see the section “Playing Solo: Chord-Melody Style”), and how to look
cool while playing a 16th-century folksong.
Work on smoothly blending the single melody notes with the chord-sup-
ported melody notes. When playing the chords, be sure to bring out the
top note by plucking it slightly harder or rolling the chord (arpeggiating
it) slightly so the melody voice stands out.
 Swing Thing: This song employs some typical jazz moves in both the
rhythm and lead. To swing this piece, you need to know how to play
inside chord forms (see the “Inside chords” section in this chapter), how
to play single-line eighth notes up the neck (see Chapter 7), and how to
bop till you drop.
The progression begins with a typical comping figure in F. The lead part fol-
lows a II-V-I-VI progression (Gm7-C7-F-D7), over which a series of variations
are written. Note the arpeggio pattern in the first half of bar 6, which is fol-
lowed by a triplet of altered tones. These are two examples of typical jazz
techniques discussed in the chapter. See how many more you can find.

Purchasing
and Caring
for Your Guitar

In this part . . .
W
hether you want to figure out how to buy your first
practice guitar, your second electric guitar, or your
first amp to take on tour, you can find what you need in
this part. Chapter 15 shows you what to look for in a guitar
that matches your playing level, style, and budget, and
Chapter 16 tells you about the extras that you either 
desperately need or desperately want.
And, as you practice on your guitar more and more, you’re
likely to find that it’s not unlike a favorite pet. You become
very attached to it, but you also have to take care of it and
baby it. Okay, you probably won’t find yourself dropping
it table scraps, but you do have to know how to do some
everyday maintenance. Chapter 17 outlines the procedure
for dealing with broken strings, and Chapter 18 tells you
about the daily maintenance that every guitarist should be
able to perform.

B
uying a new guitar is an exciting proposition. You go to the music store
and immediately face a world of possibilities, a supermarket of tantalizing
choices. Every guitar on the wall seems to scream, “Pick me! Pick me!” Should
you resist, exercise restraint, and avoid the models you know you can’t afford?
Heck, no. Be bold and just try any model that strikes your fancy. After all,
you’re not asking to test drive the Ferrari appearing in the showroom
window; you’re simply asking the salesperson to see how different guitars
feel and sound. And you’re not being frivolous either. Playing a range of gui-
tars helps you understand the differences between high-quality, expensive
guitars and acceptable but affordable guitars.
So indulge yourself. Even if you don’t have enough experience to recognize
the subtle differences between a good guitar and a great guitar, at least
expose yourself to them. And don’t wait until the day that you decide to buy
an instrument to pick one up for the first time. Make several visits to the
music store before you’re ready to buy and then take the time to absorb your
experiences. Try to visit several different music stores if you can. Some
stores may be the exclusive dealer of a specific brand in your region; other
retailers may not be able to sell that brand of guitar. Also, you pick up far
more knowledge about what makes a good, playable guitar than you may
think just by handling several different instruments.
Buying a guitar can be like what happens after you think that you have the
basics of a foreign language down pat and then visit the country where it’s
spoken: You practice your best Berlitz for weeks, but the first time that a
native starts speaking to you, you’re completely flustered. But don’t rush it;
hang in there. You’re just buying a guitar; you’re not in a strange land trying
to find the closest restroom facilities. You’re eventually gonna sort it all out.

Before Breaking Out Your Wallet
Before you walk into your local music store ready to plop down your hard-
earned dough on a new guitar, you need to take stock of what you’re doing. You
need to ask yourself some tough questions about your pending purchase —
and you need to do so now. Don’t simply wait until you get to the store to
develop a buying strategy (which, by that time, usually translates into no
strategy at all). Keep in mind that the two most important factors in making
any purchasing decision — especially concerning a guitar, where passions
tend to run high — are to develop a plan and to gather all the information
you need to make the best choice.
Start developing your purchasing plan by answering some specific questions
about exactly what you want in a guitar — and how much you can spend to
attain it. Narrowing your scope doesn’t mean that you can’t change your
mind after you get to the store and see all the nifty instruments available or
that you can’t let on-the-spot inspiration and whim play a significant part in
your final decision. (“I just can’t decide between these two guitars . . . oh,
what the heck! Just give me both of them!”) But you do need a point from
which to depart.
In focusing in on the instrument of your (practical) dreams, ask yourself the
following questions:
 What’s my level of commitment? Regardless of your current ability, do
you realistically envision yourself practicing every day for the next five
years, pursuing a dedicated program of guitar excellence? Or do you
first want to see whether this whole “guitar thing” is going to stick? Just
because you can afford a $1,000 guitar doesn’t mean that you should
necessarily buy it. Before plunking down any cash, honestly determine
the importance of the guitar in your life and then act responsibly accord-
ing to that priority. (Or completely ignore this advice and go crazy, you
guitar-playing rebel, you!)
 What’s my spending limit? The answer to this question is critical because,
often, the more expensive the guitar, the greater its appeal. So you need to
balance your level of commitment and your available resources. You don’t
want to have to give up food for six months and live in a cardboard box
just because you got carried away in a moment of buying fever at the
music store. You can very easily overextend yourself — especially in these
days of generous credit limits. If you don’t set a limit on how much you can
spend, you can’t know whether you exceed that limit . . . or by how much.
 Do I buy retail or online or mail order? If you know exactly what you
want — down to the color and options — you may consider buying a
guitar through mail order or online; you often get the best deal available
on your chosen instrument by going either route and may even avoid
paying sales tax on your purchase (if the music company is out of state).
264
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Buying sight unseen is common with many products, such as automo-
biles and computers. But if you can’t cotton to buying something as per-
sonal as a guitar without falling in love with it first — and you want to
“date” your guitar before “marrying” it — you definitely want to stick
with retail. A retail outlet usually comes with an official service agree-
ment and unofficial, friendly cooperation from the staff that’s worth its
weight in gold. Music stores know they’re competing with online and
mail-order services, and they make up for it in spades with service.
 Am I a “new-guitar person” or a “used-guitar person”? You’re going to
have a much easier time comparing attributes among new guitars. And
all the retail and discount prices of new instruments are pretty much
standardized — which is not, however, to say that all the prices are the
same; stores usually discount at different rates. Expect to pay between
10 and 35 percent off the “list” price (manufacturer’s suggested retail
price) at a music store and a slightly higher discount if you’re going
online or mail order. Big chains offer better discounts than smaller mom-
and-pop stores, because they buy in quantity and get a better price from
the manufacturer.
Retail, online, and mail-order operations also offer a warranty against
any manufacturer defects on new instruments. You don’t find any compa-
rable protection if you’re buying a guitar from a newspaper ad (although
music stores also sell used instruments, usually with warranties). But on
the other hand, you can sometimes get a really good deal on a used
instrument . . . if you know what to look for. And, of course, if you want a
vintage instrument, you’re looking at a used guitar by definition.
As a rule, most asking prices in newspaper ads are too high. Be ready to
dicker to get a better price for such a guitar — even if it’s exactly what
you’re looking for.
After you feel that you have satisfactory answers to the preceding questions,
proceed to the second prong of your guitar-purchasing attack plan: gathering
information on the specific guitar for you. The following section will help you
become more knowledgeable about guitar construction, materials, and work-
manship. Remember, being an informed buyer is the best defense against
making a bad deal in the retail arena.
Beginner Guitars
If you’re just starting out as a novice guitarist, you may ask the musical ques-
tion, “What’s the minimum I need to spend to avoid winding up with a piece
of junk?” That’s a good question, because modern manufacturing practices
now enable luthiers (the fancy term for guitar makers) to turn out some
pretty good stuff for around $200 — and even less sometimes.
265
Chapter 15: Perfectly Good Guitars

If you’re an adult (that is, someone older than 14), and you’re looking to grow
with an instrument, plan to spend between $200 and $250 for an acoustic
guitar and a little less for an electric. (Electric guitars are a little easier to
build than acoustics are, so they usually cost a bit less than comparable
acoustics.) Not bad for something that can provide a lifetime of entertain-
ment and help you develop musical skills, is it?
In trying to decide on a prospective guitar, consider the following criteria:
 Appearance: You must like the way a particular guitar looks, or you’re
never really happy with it. So use your eye and your sense of taste (and
we’re referring here to your sense of aesthetics, so please, don’t lick the
guitar with your tongue) to select possible candidates. A red guitar isn’t
inherently better or worse than a green one, but you’re perfectly free to
base your decision to buy simply on whether you like the look of the
guitar.
 Playability: Just because a guitar is relatively inexpensive doesn’t neces-
sarily mean that it’s difficult to play (although this correlation was often
the case in the past). You should be able to press the strings down to
the fretboard with relative ease. And you shouldn’t find the up-the-neck
frets unduly difficult either, although they’re sometimes harder to play
than the lower frets are.
Here’s a way to get some perspective on playability. Go back to that
Ferrari — er, more expensive guitar — at the other end of the rack and see
how a high-quality guitar plays. Then return to the more affordable instru-
ment you’re considering. Is the playability wildly different? It shouldn’t be.
If your prospective instrument doesn’t feel comfortable to you, move on.
 Intonation: Besides being relatively easy to play, a guitar must play in
tune. Test the intonation by playing a twelfth fret harmonic (see Chapter
12 for information on how to produce a harmonic) on the first string and
match that to the fretted note at the twelfth fret. Although the notes are
of a different tonal quality, the pitch should be exactly the same. Apply
this test to all six strings. Listen especially to the 3rd and the 6th strings.
On a guitar that’s not set up correctly, these strings are likely to go out
of tune first. If you don’t trust your ears to tell the difference, enlist the
aid of an experienced guitarist on this issue; it’s crucial. See Chapter 18
for more information about intonation.
 Solid construction: If you’re checking out an acoustic, rap gently on the
top of the instrument (like your doctor does to check your ribs and chest)
to make sure that it’s rattle free. Peer inside the hole, looking for gobs of
glue and other evidence of sloppy workmanship. (Rough-sanded braces
are a big tip-off to a hastily constructed instrument.) On an electric, test
that the metal hardware is all tightly secured and rattle free. Without plug-
ging into an amp, strum the open strings hard and listen for any rattling.
Running your hand along the edge of the neck to check that the frets are
smooth and filed correctly is another good test. If you’re not sure what you
should be feeling, consult an experienced guitarist on this “fret check.”
266
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Models for a Particular Style
Can you imagine walking into a music store and saying, “I’m a folk player. Do
you have a folk bassoon? No, not a rock bassoon or a jazz bassoon — and
please, not that country bassoon. How about that nice folk bassoon over in
the corner?”
But you’re a guitarist, so asking for a type of guitar by musical style is com-
pletely legitimate. Ask for a heavy-metal guitar, for example, and the salesper-
son nods knowingly and leads you to the corner of the store with all the
scary-looking stuff. If you request a jazz guitar, you and the salesperson trun-
dle off in a different direction (down toward the guys wearing berets and
black turtlenecks sporting “Bird lives!” buttons).
Figure 15-1 shows a collection of some popular models. Notice the diversity
in shape and style.
Now, some musical styles do share guitar models. You can play both blues
and rock, for example, with equal success on a Fender Stratocaster. And a
Gibson Les Paul is just as capable of playing a wailing lead as a Strat. (As a
rule, however, the tone of a Les Paul is going to be fatter and less jangly than
that of a Strat.) Making your own kind of music on the guitar of your choice is
part of the fun.
Following are some popular music styles and classic guitars that most people
associate with those styles. This list is by no means exhaustive but does
include recognized standard bearers of the respective genres:

Although the preceding list contains guitars that people generally associate
with given styles, don’t let that limit your creativity. Play the music you want
to play on the guitar you want to play it on, no matter what some chart tells
you. In other words, after you study this list, take it with a grain of salt and go
pick out the guitar you want, play the music you want, and never mind what
some chart tells you. These guitars are all super sweet, and the price tag
reflects the quality as well as the heritage of these guitars.
The Second (And Third . . .) Guitars
Your toughest decisions in buying a guitar may come not with your first
instrument at all but with your second. Admit it — your first time out was
probably a blur, but now that you know a little bit about guitar playing and
what’s available out there, you face perhaps an even more daunting prospect
than before: What should you choose as your next guitar?
If you haven’t already developed gear-lust for a certain model but are hanker-
ing for a new toy just the same, consider the following three common
approaches to choosing another guitar:
268
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

 The contrasting and complementary approach: If you own an acoustic,
you may want to consider getting an electric (or vice versa), because
having an array of different guitars in your arsenal is always nice.
Diversity is very healthy for a person seeking to bolster a collection.
 The clone approach: Some people just want to acquire as many, say, Les
Pauls as they can in a lifetime: old ones, new ones, red ones, blue ones . . .
hey — it’s your money. Buy as many as you want (and can afford).
 The upgrade approach: If all you ever want to do is master the
Stratocaster, just get a better version of what you had before. That way,
you can use the new guitar for important occasions, such as recording
and performing, and the old ax for going to the beach.
How much should you spend on your second (or later) instrument? One
guideline is to go into the next spending bracket from your old guitar. This
way, you don’t end up with many similar guitars. Plan on spending about $200
more than the current value (not what you paid) of the guitar you own. By
doing so, you ensure that even if you stick with a certain model line, you’re
getting a guitar that’s categorically different from your initial instrument.
When should you stop buying guitars? Why, as soon as the money runs out,
of course. Actually, no hard-and-fast rules dictate how many guitars are
“enough.” These days, however, a reasonably well-appointed guitar arsenal
includes a single-coil electric (such as a Fender Strat), a humbucker electric
(such as a Gibson Les Paul), a semihollow-body electric, a hollow-body jazz
(electric), an acoustic steel-string, an acoustic 12-string, and a nylon-string
classical. Then maybe you can add one or two more guitars in a given spe-
cialty, such as a guitar set up especially for playing slide, a 12-string electric,
or an electric bass.
Then, of course, you can start collecting nonguitar fretted instruments, such
as mandolins, banjos, and Dobros (a type of guitar that is fretted and played
with a slide) . . . but that’s another story.
In upgrading to a second guitar, the issue again becomes one of quality. But
this time, instead of just making sure that you have an instrument that plays
in tune, frets easily, and doesn’t collapse like a house of cards if you breathe
on it, you also need to make informed decisions. Don’t worry — that’s not as
grave as it sounds. Consider for the moment, however, the following four pil-
lars for judging quality in an instrument:
 Construction: How the guitar is designed and put together
 Materials: The woods, metals (used in hardware, pickups, electronics),
and other substances used
269
Chapter 15: Perfectly Good Guitars

 Workmanship: The quality of the building
 Appointments: The aesthetic additions and other doodads
Not sure just what all those terms mean in determining the quality of a
guitar? The following sections clue you in.
Construction
How a guitar is built defines what type of guitar it is and (generally) what
type of music it’s used for. Consider just two examples: A solid-body electric
guitar is used for rock. It has no holes in the body — which adds to its sustain
(the guitar’s ability to increase the amount of time a plucked note rings). An
acoustic archtop is used for traditional jazz, because it has a carved, con-
toured top, which produces the mellow tones most associated with that
style. The following sections cover the three most important issues regarding
guitar construction.
Solid wood versus laminated wood
A solid-wood acoustic guitar is more desirable than a laminated acoustic guitar
(where, instead of using a solid, thicker piece of top-wood, the guitar maker
uses several layers of inexpensive wood pressed together and covered with a
veneer). Guitars made completely out of solid wood are very expensive — 
costing more than $1,000.
The guitar’s top is the most critical element in sound production; the back
and sides primarily reflect the sound back through the top. So, if you can’t
pick up the tab for a solid-wood acoustic guitar, look to various configura-
tions in which the top is solid and various other parts are laminated. A good
choice is a solid-top guitar with laminated back and sides, which can cost as
little as $350.
Another very popular configuration, just a step higher in quality, is a guitar
with a solid top, a solid back, and laminated sides. You can find a wide vari-
ety of acoustics constructed this way at around the $1,000 mark and even
slightly less. Because the sides have a negligible effect on the sound (even
less so than the back does) and because laminates are structurally stronger
than solid woods, this setup equates to a win-win situation for both manufac-
turer and buyer. Some people argue, therefore, that the cheaper manufactur-
ing process (using laminated sides) is also the superior one (because the
laminates are stronger than the solid-wood construction).
If you’re unsure as to whether a guitar has solid or laminated wood, ask the
dealer or consult the manufacturer.
270
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Body caps
In the electric realm, one big determinant of price is whether the top has a
cap. A cap is a decorative layer of fine wood — usually a variety of figured
maple (one having a naturally occurring decorative grain pattern) — that sits
on top of the body without affecting the sound. Popular cap woods include
flame maple and quilted maple. Figured-wood tops usually come with clear,
or see-through, finishes to show off the wood’s attractive grain pattern.
Neck construction
The following list describes the three most common types of neck construc-
tion, from the least expensive to the most expensive:
 Bolt-on: The neck attaches to the back of the guitar at the heel with four
or five bolts (although a heel plate sometimes covers the bolt holes).
Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters have bolt-on necks.
 Set in (or glued in): The neck joins the body with an unbroken surface
covering the connection, creating a seamless effect from neck to body.
The joint is then glued. Gibson Les Pauls and Paul Reed Smiths have 
set-in necks.
 Neck through body: A high-end construction where the neck is one long
unit (although usually consisting of several pieces of wood glued
together) that doesn’t stop at the body but continues all the way
through to the tail of the guitar. This type of neck is great for getting
maximum sustain. A Jackson Soloist is an example of a guitar with a
neck-through-body design.
Just because a construction technique is more advanced or expensive doesn’t
mean that it’s necessarily better than other techniques. Could you “improve”
the sound of Jimi Hendrix’s Strat by modifying its neck to a glued-in configu-
ration? Sacrilege!
Materials
A guitar isn’t limited by what it’s made of any more than a sculpture is.
Michelangelo’s David and your Aunt Agnes’ candy dish are both made of
marble, but which one would you travel to Paris to see? (Hint: Assume that
you don’t have an overly developed sweet tooth.) So don’t judge a guitar only
by its materials, but consider that a guitar with better materials (abalone
inlays as opposed to plastic ones) tends to have commensurately better
workmanship — and therefore be a better guitar — than a model that uses
inexpensive materials.
271
Chapter 15: Perfectly Good Guitars

Woods
As you may expect, the more expensive or rare a wood, the more expensive
the guitar you construct from that wood. Guitar makers break woods down
into categories, and each category has a bearing on the guitar’s overall
expense. 
Following are the three criteria used for classifying wood:
 Type: This category simply determines whether a piece of wood is
mahogany, maple, or rosewood. Rosewood tends to be the most expen-
sive wood used in the construction of acoustic-guitar bodies, followed
by maple, and then mahogany.
 Style: You can classify woods further by looking at the wood’s region or
grain style. Brazilian rosewood is redder and wavier than East Indian
rosewood and is also more expensive. The figured maples, such as
quilted and flame, are more expensive than rock or bird’s-eye maples.
 Grade: Guitar makers use a grading system, from A to AAA (the highest),
to evaluate woods based on grain, color, and consistency. High-quality
guitars get the highest-grade wood.
Hardware: Tuners and bridge assemblies
In more expensive instruments, you see upgrades on all components, includ-
ing the hardware, or the metal parts of the guitar. Chrome-plated hardware is
usually the cheapest, so if you begin looking at more expensive guitars, you
start to see gold-plated and black-matte-finished knobs, switches, and tuning
machines in place of chrome.
The actual hardware the manufacturer uses — not just the finishes on it —
changes, too, on more expensive instruments. High-quality, name-brand hard-
ware often replaces the guitar maker’s less prestigious, generic brand of hard-
ware on high-end axes. For example, manufacturers may use a higher-grade
product for the tuning machines on an upscale guitar — such as locking
Spurzels (a popular third-party tuner type and brand), which lock the string
in place as opposed to forcing the user to tie the string off at the post.
The bridge is an important upgrade area as well. The so-called floating bridge
(so designated because you can move it up and down by means of the
whammy bar) is a complicated affair of springs, fine-tuning knobs, and
anchors. The better floating assemblies, such as the Floyd Rose system or
systems manufactured under a Floyd Rose license, operate much more
smoothly and reliably than do the simple three-spring varieties found on low-
cost guitars. (The strings spring right back to pitch on a Floyd Rose system,
even after the most torturous whammy bar abuse.)
272
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Pickups and electronics (electrics only)
Unless a guitar manufacturer is also known for making great pickups, you see
more and more use of third-party pickups as you go up the quality ladder. In
the electric arena, Seymour Duncan, DiMarzio, Bartolini, Bill Lawrence, Lace,
and EMG are examples of high-quality pickup brands that guitar makers
piggy-back onto their models. Fishman and L.R. Baggs are two popular
acoustic pickup systems found on many well-known guitars.
Although they’re not known by name brands, the electronics in guitars also
improve along with the other components as you venture into more expen-
sive territory. You can see a greater variety, for example, in pickup manipula-
tion. Manufacturers can provide circuitry that changes double-coil, or
humbucker, pickups into single-coils, enabling them to emulate the behavior
of Stratlike pickups. Having one guitar that can imitate the pickup behavior of
other guitar types provides you with a tonally versatile instrument. You also
see more manipulation in wiring schemes. For example, guitar makers may
reverse the polarity of a pickup — the direction the signal flows — to make
the guitar sound softer and more swirly.
With more expensive guitars, you may also encounter improved volume and
tone controls, resulting in better taper. Taper is the gradualness or abrupt-
ness of change (also called response) of a signal’s characteristics (in this
case, volume and tone) as you turn a knob from its minimum value to its max-
imum. A knob exhibiting a smoother taper is evidence of a higher grade of
electronics. Really cheap guitars give you no sound at all until turned up to 3;
then you get a swell of sound from about 4 to about 7 and no change at all
between 7 and the knob’s maximum value, 10 — or, on those really rare, loud
guitars, 11. (And if you don’t get that last joke, go out and rent the hilarious
rockumentary spoof This Is Spinal Tap. It’s required viewing for all guitarists.)
Workmanship
For more expensive guitars, you can really bring out the white glove and get
fussy. We’ve seen prospective buyers bring in a dentist’s mirror to inspect the
interior of an acoustic guitar.
For acoustic guitars more expensive than the $600 range, you should expect
to find gapless joints — solid wood-to-wood connections between compo-
nents, especially where the neck meets the body. You should also expect
clean and glob-free gluing (in the top and back bracing), a smooth and even
finish application, and a good setup: the strings at the right height with no
buzzing, the neck warp- and twist-free, and the intonation true. (See Chapter
18 for more information on intonation.)
273
Chapter 15: Perfectly Good Guitars

You can glean all this information by simply playing the guitar and noting
your impressions. Like traveling in a Rolls-Royce or Bentley, playing a quality
guitar should be one smooth ride.
Appointments (cosmetics)
Appointments are the fancy stuff that have no acoustic or structural effect on
the guitar. They exist solely as decorative elements. Some people find fancy
appointments showy or pretentious, but we feel that a great guitar is a work
of art to behold with the eye as well as the ear.
Typical appointments include intricate neck inlays (such as abalone figures
countersunk into the fretboard), a fancy headstock design, gold-plated hard-
ware, and, on an acoustic guitar, lining around the edges of the body and the
sound hole.
One subtle aspect about appointments: You may think that the only differ-
ence between two guitars is in the appointments — for example, a fancy inlay
job may seem to be the only thing that distinguishes between a certain com-
pany’s Grand Deluxe and Deluxe models. But the truth is that the more expen-
sive guitar — although nominally the same in materials and construction —
often gets the choicest materials and enjoys higher quality-control standards.
This situation is just a Darwinian reality. If 12 pieces of wood, all destined to
become guitar tops, come into the factory, slated for six Grand Deluxes and
six Deluxes (fictitious titles, by the way, bearing no resemblance to actual
guitar models, living or deceased), the six best pieces of wood go to the
Grand Deluxes and the six next-best pieces to the Deluxe models. They all
share identical grading, but humans with subjective powers decide which
models get which tops.
Buying an Ax to Grind
Buying a guitar is similar to buying a car or house (okay, it’s a little less monu-
mental than buying a house) in that it’s an exciting endeavor and lots of fun,
but you must exercise caution and be a savvy customer, too. Only you know
the right guitar for you, what the right price is for your budget and commit-
ment level, and whether a deal feels right or not. Don’t deny your natural
instincts as a shopper, even if you’re new to guitar shopping. Look, listen,
consider, go have lunch before the big buy, and talk it over with your sweetie.
274
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Bringing along an expert
A certain saying goes, “An expert is someone who knows more than you do.”
If you have such a friend — whose knowledge and experience in guitars
exceeds your own — bring the friend along, by all means. This friend not only
knows about guitars, but also knows you. A salesperson doesn’t know you,
nor does he necessarily have your best interests in mind. But a friend does.
And another opinion never hurts, if only to help you articulate your own.
Enlist your guitar teacher (if you have one) to help you navigate through the
guitar buyer’s jungle, especially if he’s been with you a while and knows your
tastes and playing style. Your teacher may know things about you that you
may not even realize about yourself — for example, that you’ve gotten side-
tracked in the steel-string section although your principal interests lie in
nylon-string guitar music. A good teacher asks questions, listens to your
answers, and gently guides you to where you want to go.
Another saying, however, goes, “Moe was the smartest of the Three Stooges.”
If you have a friend who’s like Moe — smarter than you in matters of the
guitar but otherwise one string short of a set — leave him at home. You don’t
need a wise guy goofing around (and tweaking the salesperson’s nose with a
pair of pliers) while you’re trying to concentrate.
Meeting the salesperson
Dealing with a salesperson doesn’t need to be a stressful, adversarial affair,
but some people get pretty anxious about the entire situation. If you establish
your priorities before you enter the store, you don’t come off as vague and
unprepared as he begins his salvo of questions.
A typical first question from a salesperson may be “How much do you want
to spend?” In essence, the question means “What price range are you looking
at so that I know to which end of the store to take you?” It’s a fair question, and
if you can answer directly, you end up saving a lot of time. He may also ask
about your playing ability and your style preferences, so be ready to answer
those questions, too.
Be prepared to answer the salesperson’s questions succinctly — for example,
“I prefer Strat-style guitars, although not necessarily by Fender, and I’m an
intermediate blues player — not a shredder — and I’d like to keep costs at less
than $600.” Answers such as these make you sound decisive and thoughtful.
The salesperson should have plenty to go on from that kind of information. But

what’s-his-name plays on MTV,” you’re not going to be taken seriously — nor
are you likely to end up with the instrument you need.
As the salesperson speaks, listen carefully and ask questions. You’re there to
observe and absorb, not impress. If you decide you’re not ready to buy at
this point, tell him that. Thank him for his time and get his card. You’re cer-
tainly free to go elsewhere and investigate another store. To do so not only is
your option — it’s your duty!
Remember that you’re shopping. And the whole shopping experience is no
different with guitars than with any other commodity. Do your research and
get differing opinions before you buy. And trust your instincts.
The art of the deal
You can find out the retail, or list, price of an instrument before you walk into
the store. The manufacturer presets these numbers, and they’re public
knowledge. Look at the ads in guitar magazines for the company’s contact
info and call the company or visit its Web site to determine the manufac-
turer’s suggested retail price on a particular product or to receive literature.
As of this writing, a Gibson Les Paul Standard lists for $3,248.00, and a Fender
American Standard Stratocaster lists for $1,327.99. Figure 15-2 shows these
two industry stalwarts.

Again, the preceding numbers are list prices. Music stores offer discounts,
and the range can vary greatly. Big, urban-based stores that buy mass quanti-
ties of instruments can usually offer greater discounts than can smaller
(mom-and-pop) stores in outlying or remote areas. Mail-order and online out-
lets can match and sometimes beat big-store prices, because they don’t have
the overhead of maintaining a retail facility.
In deciding where to buy, don’t neglect the value of service. Retail stores —
unlike online and mail-order houses — are in a better position to devote
close, personal service to a new guitar customer. Perhaps as a result of facing
stiff competition from the booming online and mail-order biz, many stores are
upping their service incentives. Service includes anything from fixing minor
problems and making adjustments to providing periodic setups (sort of like a
tune-up and oil change for your guitar). A music store can be a great place to
just hang out and talk guitars!
Remember, however, that list prices are public knowledge, and salespeople
from all types of vendors must tell you their selling price with no strings
attached (uh, by that we mean with no conditions). The vendor can rightfully
charge up to list price; you must wrangle the maximum discount yourself.
How you do that is as old as bargaining itself, but a reasonable haggling range
is somewhere between the cut-rate quote of a nationally advertising online
and mail-order house and 10 percent off list.

In This Chapter
 Cranking up the wattage with amps
 Completing your arsenal
 Understanding the importance of the little things
A
fter you get your guitar squared away, you need to think about all the
little (and not-so-little) items that make life so much easier — if you’re a
guitarist, that is. Some of the products that we describe in this chapter are
essential — for example, cases and strings (and amps if you’re playing elec-
tric) — but you can think of others merely as accessories. We do think that
all these items are useful and have some musical or practical application. You
find no plugs for bumper stickers and mugs that read “Guitarists are strum-thing
special” in these pages — just the short list of stuff that can really help you out.
Amps
Strictly speaking, you can play an electric guitar without any amplification,
but playing that way’s not much fun. Without an amp, you hear the notes
buzzing like little musical mosquitoes, but you don’t achieve any expression
or tone. And you can’t possibly rattle the windows and shake the floorboards
with your newly learned “Smoke on the Water” riff unless you’re wired up and
have decibels to burn.
We recommend that you save your most critical purchasing decision for the
guitar. But after you break the bank to get that guitar that’s just beyond your
means, you may as well go right out and exercise some more financial irre-
sponsibility and get a good amp. You can’t start to develop a fully mature and
individual tone until you have both a quality guitar and a decent amp to run
it through. But if you must skimp somewhere, we suggest that you skimp on
the amp side — at first.

Amps come in two general flavors — practice and performance varieties. The
biggest differences between practice amps and performance amps boil down
to size, wattage, and cost. Figure 16-1 shows a practice amp and a perfor-
mance amp.
Getting started with a practice amp
If you have limited funds, start out with what’s known as a practice amp —
one that has a decent feature set (tone controls, reverb, and two or more
volume controls so that you can sculpt your distorted sound) and that deliv-
ers a good sound but at low volumes (6 to 12 watts is typical on practice
amps). This type of starter amp accustoms you to hearing the electric guitar
as it’s designed to be heard — through a guitar amp.
Practice amps can run as little as $175 and boast features that appear on their
higher-priced performance counterparts. In amplifiers, power — not features —
is what drives up the price. Power is expensive to build, requiring heavy-duty
transformers, speakers, and cabinetry. For home and casual use — such as jam-
ming with a couple of friends in a garage or basement — 15 or 20 watts is often
plenty loud enough, and 6 to 12 watts is sufficient for solo practicing and play-
ing along with your stereo.
Features, on the other hand, such as tone controls and effects (reverb,
tremolo), are easier to implement because the manufacturers can stamp
them onto a chip and install it on a circuit board. Following are some useful
things to look for in a practice amp:

 Multiple-gain stages: Gain is the technical word for “loudness power,”
and having two or more separate volume controls on an amp gives you
more flexibility in shaping the distorted sound.
 Three-band EQ: EQ, or equalization, is tone controls for bass, mid, and
high. An EQ device is a fancy tone control that gives you increased flexi-
bility over the bass, midrange, and treble makeup of your sound.
 Built-in reverb: Reverb is an echo effect that makes the guitar sound like
it’s playing within a given environment — rooms of varying sizes, a con-
cert hall, cathedral, canyon, etc. (See the “Effect Pedals and Devices”
section later in the chapter for more information.)
 Channel switching via footswitch: Channel switching enables you to
access different sets of volume and tone control. Some practice amps
include it; others don’t. Decide whether that feature is important enough
to pay for in a practice amp. You can always get your distorted sound
through an external effect, such as a stomp box, but that’s a little bit
more of a hassle. (See the section “Effect Pedals and Devices” later in
this chapter for more information on distortion and other effects.)
 Headphone jack: A headphone jack is a very handy thing in a practice
amp as it enables you to get a fully amp-treated sound without going
through the speaker. Great for late-night practice sessions!
Because of the miniaturization of all things electronic, you can now get full-
sounding, authentic guitar sounds from a unit the size of a disposable camera —
as long as you listen to it through headphones (meaning that it has no speaker
or amplifier of its own). These strap-on wonders come with belt clips and are
battery powered for untethered practicing (great for walking into the bathroom
and standing in front of the mirror). And they offer distortion, EQ, reverb, and
other effects; numerous presets (sounds programmed or set up by the manufac-
turer); and stereo sound. These units are great for playing in a moving vehicle
and can even output a signal to tape or disk, suitable for recording. They cost
about $200 (the Korg Pandora and Zoom 9000 series are just two makes and
models) but are worth the price if portability, privacy, and authentic tone are
important to you.
Powering up to a performance amp
Practice amps serve a purpose, but they don’t hold up if you try to turn them
up to performance levels. Performance, in this case, means anything from cut-
ting through three friends in a garage jam to making yourself heard over the
antics of the overly zealous drummer and bass player at Slippery Sam’s
Saturday Night Blues Bash.

Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 
Amplification without an amp
You can get away without buying an amp by
plugging your electric guitar into the auxiliary
inputs of your home stereo, but you do need to
buy a special adapter. You can readily purchase
these devices at Radio Shack or at a music
store for about $2. (Just tell the salesperson
what you want to do, and he can supply you
with the right unit.) The adapter is just a metal
or plastic-coated plug that has a mono, female,
1⁄4-inch jack on one end and a male, RCA (some-
times called phono) plug on the other.
Warning! Before you go plugging anything in to
a stereo or boom box, make sure that the
volume control on the receiver is turned all the
way down. This precaution prevents any
sudden pop or surge in the system, which is
potentially damaging to the speakers.
Because you plug into, say, the left input of your
receiver, you hear music only out of the left
speaker. Some higher-end receivers enable you
to set the output mode (the stereo configura-
tion) of the source signal. If you see a bunch of
settings such as L, R, L+R, and so on, set that
knob to L (meaning left channel out of both
speakers). It’s not stereo, but it sounds fuller and
more widely dispersed than if it’s coming out of
only one speaker.
The figure below shows the procedure for plug-
ging into the back of your receiver. Plug one end
of the guitar cord into your guitar and the other
end into the adapter. Plug the adapter into the
left auxiliary input in the back of your receiver.
On the receiver’s front panel, select Aux 1 or
whatever is the corresponding name of the
input into which you plugged your guitar. (It may
be Tape 1 or some other name — check the
input itself or your owner’s manual if in doubt.)
Turn your guitar’s volume up full. Then, slowly,
turn up the receiver’s volume knob until you
hear sound.

After you decide to take the plunge into higher-quality amps, you have a
galaxy of makes and models from which to choose. Talk to other guitarists
and music salespeople, read guitar magazines, and listen to CDs to find out
what amps the artists you like are using. Your choice of amp is just as per-
sonal and individual as that of your guitar. The amp must not only sound
good, but also look good and feel as if it’s just the right amp for you. The pur-
suit of the perfect amp is as elusive as the quest for the perfect guitar. Well,
almost.
Performance amps are more powerful than practice amps. More power doesn’t
just mean a louder amp. Increased power also delivers a cleaner, purer signal
at higher volumes. In other words, if two amps of different power are produc-
ing the same overall loudness, the more powerful amp yields the cleaner
signal.
A 50-watt amp is usually more than sufficient for home and normal perform-
ing circumstances, such as playing in a five-piece band at a local pub. If you
play larger venues or play in a genre that requires unusually loud levels —
such as heavy metal — go with 100 watts. Some players who desire a squeaky-
clean sound and who run in stereo (requiring double the power) may opt for
100 watts regardless, because they can stay cleaner at louder levels.
Many amps can operate at either 100 or 50 watts by enabling you to select
the power via a switch. Why would you want to operate at 50 watts if you
paid for a 100-watt amp? Because a 50-watt amp “breaks up,” or distorts,
sooner (at a lower level) than a 100-watt one does, and for many types of
music (blues, rock, metal), this distortion is desirable.
Once upon a time, all electronic circuits were powered by vacuum tubes —
those glass cylinders that glow red in the back of old radios. As technology
has developed, solid-state electronics (which consists of transistors and,
later, microchips) has replaced tubes, except in guitar amps. The latest gen-
eration of amps feature digital technology to “model,” or emulate, a variety of
guitar tones and effects. Many argue, however, that tube technology still pro-
duces the best tone (warmest and fullest, due in part to the way tubes affect
the signal) for guitars because, although they’re not as efficient or even as
283
Chapter 16: Guitar Accessories
Recording amps
Though high-power amps usually cost more
than similarly featured low-power ones, that
doesn’t mean all low-power amps are inexpen-
sive. Many manufacturers make high-quality,
high-priced amps that deliver only low power,
and these amps are especially popular for
recording because they don’t shake the foun-
dations of your house to make music. With
recording amps, it is quality, not power, that
makes them expensive.

accurate in faithfully reproducing the original signal, tube amps actually
deliver the most musical tone. All your favorite guitarists record and play
exclusively with tube amps, from the 100-watt Marshall to the Fender Twin, to
the Vox AC30 and the MESA/Boogie Dual Rectifier.
As a beginner, you may not appreciate (or care about) the differences
between tube and solid-state tone. You can get good-sounding distortion out
of a solid-state amp anyway, and these are usually cheaper, so you should
probably go with a solid-state amp and ignore the whole tone debate.
Besides, you may prefer to get your distortion sound from a pedal, and then
the whole issue is moot. Look instead for features such as built-in effects
(reverb, chorus, and so on) and a headphone jack. Above all, listen to the
sound and turn the knobs. If you like what you hear and you feel comfortable
dialing in the different sounds, the amp is for you.
A Case for Cases
A guitar case is so important to your guitar that many manufacturers include
the case in the price of the guitar. Many manufacturers make cases specially
designed for particular models and ship the guitars inside these cases to the
retailer. This practice makes buying the guitar without the case difficult —
and rightly so.
To buy a serious instrument and then try to carry it away from the store with-
out the appropriate, quality protection is a foolish way to save a few bucks.
The most important gesture of respect that you can show your instrument is
to give it a safe place to sleep.
Cases come in three basic types: the hard or hard-shell type; the soft variety;
and the gig bag. Each has its advantages, and the protection factor is propor-
tional to cost: The more expensive the case, the better the protection that it
offers your instrument.
Hard cases
The hard case is the most expensive option ($80 to $120 and more) but offers
the best insurance against damage to your guitar. It’s composed of leather- or
nylon-covered wood and can even survive the rigors of airline baggage han-
dlers, providing crush-proof protection to your instrument. They can drop
heavy objects on the case and stack it safely under other luggage items with-
out any damage accruing to the precious guitar inside.
The safest thing to do is to go with a hard case, unless you have some really
compelling reason not to. If you don’t already have a case for your guitar and
are thinking of buying one, try to think of any situation where a hard case
284
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

may not be appropriate. If you can’t produce a quick and ready response,
spring for the hard case and be done with it.
Soft cases
The soft case isn’t completely soft, being in fact more stiff than truly soft. It
usually consists of some pressed-particle material, such as cardboard, and
can provide some protection for your instrument — for example, if someone
drops a coffee mug on it (an empty coffee mug, that is). But that’s about it.
You can pick up these cases for about $30.
The soft case is the inexpensive alternative to the hard case because it
enables you to transport your instrument without exposing it to the elements
and at least prevents an outside intruder from scratching it. But these cases
easily buckle if put to any real stress (such as getting caught in an airport con-
veyer belt) and cave in, fold, and puncture much more easily than a hard case
does. In most cases, however, a soft case provides protection against the daily
bumps and grinds that would otherwise scratch an unprotected guitar.
Gig bags
The gig bag provides almost no protection against shock because it’s a form-
fitting nylon, leather, or other fabric enclosure — you know, a bag. Gig bags
zip shut and are about the consistency of any other soft luggage carrier. They
cost anywhere from $25 to $150.
The advantage of gig bags is that they’re light, they fit on your shoulder, and
they take up no more room than the guitar itself — making them the ideal
case if you’re trying to fit your electric guitar into the overhead bin of an 
airplane. 
People who live in big cities and take public transportation favor gig bags.
With the gig bag over their shoulder and a luggage cart toting an amp in one
hand, they still have a hand free to feed a token into a subway turnstile and
hold the poles on a train car. But a gig bag isn’t nearly as protective as a soft
case, and you can’t stack anything on top of a bagged guitar.
Capos
A capo (pronounced KAY-po) is a spring-loaded, adjustable-tension (or elas-
tic) clamp that wraps around the neck of a guitar and covers all the strings,
forcing them all down to the fretboard at a given fret. This device effectively
raises the pitch of all the strings by a given number of frets (or half steps). In
285
Chapter 16: Guitar Accessories

some cases, you may want to tune your guitar with the capo on, but most of
the time, you tune up without it and then place it on the desired fret. Capos
enable you to transpose the music you play on your guitar to another key,
while you still play the chord fingerings in the original key. (See Chapter 12
for more information on capos.) Figure 16-2 shows a few different capo types
you can find at most music stores.
Capos cost between $5 and $25, with the elastic-band type being the cheap-
est. The higher-priced clamp and screw-on types are more popular with seri-
ous capo users because you can put them on with one hand, and these types
of capos generally hold the strings down better than the elastic kinds do. The
screw-on type, such as the one made by Shubb, is a particular favorite
because you can vary the size and tension of the capo’s grip, which enables
you to customize the capo size for different parts of the neck. (The lower
frets of the neck, toward the headstock, require a smaller capo opening than
do the higher frets.)
Effect Pedals and Devices
Electric guitarists seldom just plug into an amp and start playing. Well, they
may start out that way, but if you listen to the radio — or any recorded guitar
music, for that matter — you quickly notice a lot more going on than just a
“straight” guitar sound. At the very least, you hear some ambient treatment
in the form of artificially created echo, or reverb, as the effect is known in
guitar lingo. You may hear some (intended) distortion, especially in rock and
blues music, and you may hear additional effects, such as wah-wah, vibrato,
and other electronic manipulations.

Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Welcome to the wonderful, wacky world of effects. Effects are devices that
plug in between your guitar and amplifier and enable you to alter your signal
in all sorts of creative and unusual ways. Scores and scores of these little
devices are available from all different manufacturers and in all price ranges.
You can buy them as individual units or as an all-in-one box, called a multi-
effects processor. But whether you go for the package deal or à la carte, effects
can spice up the basic sound of your guitar in all sorts of exciting ways.
Most effects come in the form of foot-accessed pedals, also known as stomp
boxes because they reside on the floor and you activate them by stepping on
a footswitch. This setup enables you to selectively turn effects on and off
while playing the guitar without interruption. Figure 16-3 shows a typical
effects setup with a reasonable number of pedals in the signal chain (that is,
the path from guitar to amp).
If you plug, say, a reverb device inline (that is, between the amp and guitar),
you can make your guitar sound as if you’re playing in a cathedral. A distor-
tion unit can make your tones sound like those of Jimi Hendrix, even at low
volumes and with your amp set to a clean sound.

Chapter 16: Guitar Accessories

Dozens of different types of effects are available — more than you could pos-
sibly own, not to mention use all at once. The price of these individual units
varies, too, with distortion boxes as cheap as $45 and digital reverbs and
delays as much as $175 (or more). To help you sort through the myriad of fla-
vors and types, following is a list of some of the most popular effects:
 Distortion: This effect simulates the sound of a guitar signal driven too
hard for the amplifier; the device overdrives the signal to the point that
it breaks up — but in a musically pleasing way. Distortion, to a guitarist,
can mean anything from a slightly fat, warm quality to a fuzzy sustain, to
screaming chain-saw fuzz, as used by metal and grunge bands.
 Chorus: This effect simulates the sound of many guitars playing at once,
making the overall sound fatter. Increasing the speed yields a warbling
or tremolo-like effect. The Police’s “Every Breath You Take” exemplifies
the chorus sound.
 Flanger/Phase shifter: These two devices produce similar effects that
create a whooshy, swirly, underwater sound, heard on early Van Halen
albums and in the rhythm guitar sound of many funk songs of the 1970s.
 Pitch shifter: This device (also known as a harmonizer) enables you to
play in harmony with yourself by splitting your signal into two paths,
the original and a user-defined musical interval, such as a major third
(four half steps away); it also provides choruslike effects. A popular
fixed-interval pitch shifter is the octave pedal, used to great effect by
Jimi Hendrix, which produces a pitch one or two (or both) octaves (12
half steps) lower than the original.
 Digital delay: This device produces a discrete repetition of your sound,
good for echoes, spacious effects, and creating rhythmically timed
repeats of your notes. The analog version was a tape-echo device that
actually recorded the sound on magnetic tape and played it back
moments later. Tape echoes still enjoy some popularity because of their
unique, vintage-sounding, tonal quality (which is inferior to the digital
version in terms of exact replication of the original signal). Listen to the
opening of Guns N’ Roses “Welcome to the Jungle” to hear the sound of
digital delay. 
 Wah-wah pedal: This effects pedal is a type of frequency filter (which
varies the bass and treble content of a signal) that imbues the guitar
with expressive, voicelike characteristics (it actually sounds as if it’s
saying “wah”). You control the sound by raising and lowering a foot
pedal. This device was made popular by Jimi Hendrix and was a staple
of the disco-guitar sound. Eric Clapton also gave the wah a workout on
“White Room” during his Cream days.
 Reverb: This effect reproduces the natural echo sound produced in
environments such as a large room, gymnasium, cathedral, and so on.
288
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

It’s usually included on amps in a limited version (often having only one
control), but having it as a separate effect gives you a lot more variety
and control.
 Tremolo: Like reverb, tremolo was included on many amps from the ’50s
and ’60s (such as the Fender Twin Reverb) and is now available in a
pedal. Tremolo is the rapid wavering of the volume (not pitch, like
vibrato) that makes your guitar sound as if you’re playing it through a
slowly moving electric fan. Tommy James and the Shondells’ “Crimson
and Clover” features a prominent tremolo effect.
Individual pedals are a great convenience because they enable you to buy
effects one at a time and use them in a modular fashion — you can choose to
include them in your chain or not, and you can rearrange their order to
create different effects. But many guitarists opt for a multi-effects unit, which
puts all the individual effects into one housing. Multi-effects units are pro-
grammable, meaning that you can store different settings in the effects and
recall them with the tap of a foot. Multi-effects units, like individual pedals,
also offer a modular approach to effect ordering, although they accomplish
this electronically rather than physically. 
Generally, a multi-effects unit can do anything that individual pedals do, so
most guitarists who use a lot of effects eventually buy one. You can still use
your individual pedals, too, by hooking them up with the multi-effects unit.
Most guitarists still keep their individual pedals even after acquiring a multi-
effects unit, because the individual pedals are small, simple to operate, and
convenient. A guitarist may not want to lug the larger, more cumbersome
multi-effects unit to a casual jam session when he needs only one or two
effects. The price range for guitar multi-effects units is $140 to $1,500.
Picks
You’re sure, in your musical career, to lose, break, toss to adoring fans as sou-
venirs, and otherwise part company with hundreds of picks, so don’t get
attached (in a sentimental sense) to them. Treat them as the inexpensive,
expendable commodity they are. Stock up by the gross with your favorite
color and gauge (thickness) and always carry spares in your wallet, the car,
the flaps of your penny loafers, and any other . . . er, convenient place. After
you get used to a certain gauge, shape, and make of pick, you don’t change
around much, even going from electric to acoustic or vice versa. (Check out
Chapter 2 for more information on selecting an appropriate gauge. We leave it
to you to sort out the color.)
289
Chapter 16: Guitar Accessories

Strings
You always need to keep extra strings on hand for the simple reason that, if
you break one, you need to replace it immediately. To do so requires that you
carry at least an extra full set — any one of your six strings could break.
Unlike car tires, where one spare fits all, guitars use six individually gauged
strings. Woe to the guitarists who keep breaking the same string over and
over — they’re going to have an awful lot of partial sets around! Fortunately,
string sets are cheap — about $7 if you buy them in single sets and cheaper
still if you buy in boxes of 12 sets. Or, you can buy single strings for about
$1.50 apiece.
The higher, thinner strings tend to break more easily than do the lower,
thicker ones, so try to carry three spares each of the high E, B, and G strings
(on an electric and nylon, the G is unwound).
In a pinch, you can substitute the higher adjacent string (a B string for a G,
for example), but doing so will cause your playing to sound and feel strange,
and the string will be more difficult to tune. So make sure to replace the
emergency substitute with the proper string at the very next opportunity
(during the drum solo, perhaps). (For more information on strings, including
how to change them, see Chapter 17.)
Straps
Straps come in all kinds of styles and materials, from nylon to woven fabric to
leather. The first rule in choosing a strap is that you get the most comfortable
one that you can afford. Wearing a guitar on your shoulder for long periods of
time can cause discomfort, and the better the strap is, the more it protects
your muscles against strain and fatigue.
Appearance is a close second to comfort as a factor in deciding what strap to
buy. You must like the look of your strap, as its function isn’t just utilitarian
but aesthetic as well. Because it drapes over your shoulder, a strap functions
almost like an article of clothing. So try to match the look of your strap to
your own look as well as to the look of your guitar.
You can get custom-made straps with your initials embroidered in them, if
that’s your thing (a must-have if you plan on being a country music matinee
idol). Or you can get them in all sorts of motifs, from Southwest patterns to
lighting bolts and pentagrams. But if you’re looking at strictly the price, a
simple, no-frills nylon strap costs as little as $5 and holds your guitar as
securely as a $200 one with your name embossed in leather.
290
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

For extra insurance, purchase strap locks, which secure your strap ends to
the guitar using a two-piece locking mechanism, kind of like what you find on
earrings (the pierced kind).
If you own more than one guitar, you’re best off with a strap for each type of
guitar, electric and acoustic. That way, you don’t need to keep adjusting it as
you switch from electric to acoustic and back again.
Electronic Tuners
Although you can tune a guitar to itself, keeping the guitar up to concert pitch —
the absolute tuning reference of A-440 — is best, especially if you plan to play
with other instruments. A guitar is also structurally and acoustically happiest
at that tuning. (See Chapter 2 for more information on tuning your guitar.) The
best way to keep your guitar at this tuning is to secure a battery-powered elec-
tronic tuner and keep it in your guitar case. The way you use the tuner
depends on the type of guitar you’re tuning:
 Electric: If you’re using an electric guitar, plug it right into the tuner. Plug
into the tuner first, and then, from the tuner’s output jack, plug into your
amp. That way, your tuner stays inline the entire time you play. Turn off
the tuner, however, after you’re done tuning to preserve the life of its
battery. The signal passes through the dormant tuner unaffected.
 Acoustic: If you have an acoustic, you can use the tuner’s built-in micro-
phone for tuning. You don’t need to go to great pains to get the micro-
phone to pick up the guitar. Placing the tuner an arm’s length away on a
tabletop is fine; balancing it on your knee works well, too. If the sur-
rounding atmosphere is quiet enough, you can even keep your tuner on
the floor. (But excessive room noise can confuse a tuner.)
Virtually all electronic tuners sold these days are the auto-sensing, chromatic
type. Auto-sensing means that the tuner listens to your note and tells you
what its nearest pitch is (with indicator lights). A meter with a moving needle
or an array of indicator lights then tells you if you’re flat or sharp of that
note. As you tune the guitar, you see the meter change in the direction of
your tuning motions. The word chromatic just means that the tuner shows
you all the notes in the musical scale (flats and sharps, too), not just the
notes of the open strings of the guitar. Having all notes available on your
tuner is important should you ever decide to tune the guitar differently. (See
Chapter 10 for more information on alternate tunings.) The prices of elec-
tronic tuners range from $20 to $300.

Some Other Helpful (But 
Nonessential) Goodies
You can treat yourself to a number of other little doodads and contraptions
that make guitar playing a lot more painless and convenient. In no particular
order, consider some of these gizmos, which are often worth their weight 
in thumbpicks. Figure 16-4 shows these items, which we define in the follow-
ing list:
 Batteries: Tuners, effects pedals, and even some guitars run on batter-
ies. Stock up on a couple of nine-volts and a few AAs and store them in a
sealed plastic bag.
 Bridge pins: These little plastic pieces wedge your strings into the
bridge of your acoustic guitar. The problem is this: If you lose one
(because it goes flying off a dock or into the grass after you yank it out),
you can’t find anything to substitute for it. Matchsticks are the closest
things, but who carries those around these days? The next time you’re
at the music store buying strings, make sure that you also pick up a
couple of extra bridge pins.
 Cords and cables: A crackling cable is no fun for either you or your audi-
ence. That nasty sound means that your connections are worn and bad —
it happens. Keep extra cables on hand of both the long variety (for con-
necting your guitar to an effect or an amp) and the short (for interpedal
connections).
 Cassette recorder: Don’t miss capturing a once-in-a-lifetime musical
moment because you don’t have a tape recorder on hand. You never
know when inspiration may strike. If you play with other people — espe-
cially those who can teach you something — keep the recorder handy so
that you can preserve licks, riffs, and other cool moves for later study.
Microcassette recorders are great because they fit right into your guitar
case. After you get good at recording your ideas, you may even consider
taking along a four-track recorder (one that enables you to overdub, or
add parts to, existing tracks). You can create multipart arrangements
with a four-track instead of being limited to only the simple ideas that
you can capture on a normal cassette recorder. You can get a four-track
for as little as $200.
 Cloth: You should always wipe down your guitar after playing to remove
body oils that can corrode strings and muck up the finish. Cotton is
good, and chamois is better. At least give your fingerboard a wipe before
you put it in the case, and if you’re playing with short sleeves, give the
top a rubdown, too.

 Earplugs: If you play electric guitar and find yourself in a lot of impromptu
jam sessions, you should carry earplugs. Your ears are your most pre-
cious musical commodities — more important than even your fingers.
Don’t damage them by exposing them to loud noises in close rehearsal
quarters. Buy the kind of earplugs made especially for music listening;
they attenuate (reduce) frequencies at equal rates across the spectrum.
So it’s like hearing the original music . . . only softer. Many guitarists are
advocates of earplugs, including the Who’s Pete Townshend, who claims
to have suffered significant hearing loss resulting from long-term expo-
sure to loud music.
 Pencil and paper: Always carry something that you can write with and
on. That way, you can jot down lyrics, a cool chord that someone shows
you, a cheat sheet so that you can pick up a chord progression in a jiffy,
or even a surreptitious note to another musician. (“Please tell your bass
player to turn it down — I’ve lost three fillings already!”)
 Reversible screwdriver: You can fix everything from a rattling pickup to
a loose-set screw in a tuning key with such a handy screwdriver. Get one
that has both a Phillips and straight-blade tip.

 Peg winder: This inexpensive ($2) crank turns your tuning keys at about
10 times the rate that you can turn them by hand. At no extra charge,
these devices include a notched groove that’s perfect for removing stuck
bridge pins in your acoustic.
 Wire cutters/needle-nose pliers: Strings are, after all, wires. When you
change strings, use wire cutters to trim away any excess and use the
pliers for digging out the stubborn remnants of a broken string from a
tuning post.
Other doodads you may want to consider throwing in your back pack, gym
bag, or all-leather monogrammed accessories case include the following:
 Tuning fork/Pitch pipe: Having one of these low-tech tuning devices as
a spare never hurts, in case the battery on your electronic tuner fails or
the tuner itself gets stepped on by the gravitationally challenged drum-
mer. Both of these devices are like rowboats in a speedboat and sailboat
world: After the gas is gone and the wind stops blowing, you can still
function using your own power.
 Penlight: You don’t need to wait until night to use a flashlight. Shadows
and small sizes pose as much a problem for diagnosing, say, a simple
electrical problem as does the complete absence of light. You can hold a
penlight between your teeth as you reach into the back of your amp to
fix a broken speaker lead.
 Cable tester and volt/ohm meter: These items cost about $12 and $20,
respectively, and earn their keep the first time they diagnose a bad or
reverse-wired cable. Learn how to use the volt-ohm meter with respect
to your equipment — that is, know what power supplies you have and
what the appropriate settings are on the meter. You can impress your
friends with your “gearhead-geek” aptitude.
 Fuses: Any new environment can have unpredictable wiring schemes
that could cause havoc with your gear — and especially your amp. Your
amp’s first line of defense is its fuse. If the house current is weird, the
fuse blows, and you must have a replacement to get the amp working
again.
 Duct tape: This stuff is the musician’s baking soda — an all-purpose util-
ity product that cures a multitude of maladies. You can use duct tape to
fix everything from a rattling tailpiece to a broken microphone clip. Even
the roll itself is handy: You can use it to tilt your amp up for better monitor-
ing. Use duct tape to fix your car’s upholstery or even patch the holes of
your jeans, onstage or off. In some circles, it’s even considered fashionable.

Changing Strings

M
any people consider their guitars to be delicate, precious, and fragile
instruments: They seem reluctant to tune their strings, let alone
change them. Although you should be careful not to drop or scratch your
guitar (and setting guitars afire à la Jimi Hendrix generally causes significant
damage), you needn’t worry about causing damage by changing, tuning, or
overtightening guitar strings. The fact is that guitars are incredibly rugged
and can deal with hundreds of pounds of string tension while enduring the
playing styles of even the most heavy-handed guitarists.
Changing strings isn’t something you should be shy about: You can jump into
it with both feet. The task’s sort of like giving your dog a bath: It’s good for
the dog, you’re glad you did it, and it gives you an opportunity to get closer
to man’s best friend. Similarly, changing your guitar strings has few draw-
backs: It improves the sound of the guitar, helps to prevent broken strings at
inopportune moments, and aids you in identifying other maintenance prob-
lems. During periodic string changing, for example, you may discover a
gouged bridge slot or a loose or rattling tuning post. (We cover these mal-
adies more fully in Chapter 18.)
Restringing Strategies
Old guitars improve with age, but old strings just get worse. The first time you
play new strings is the best they ever sound. Strings gradually deteriorate
until they either break or you can’t take the dreary sounds they produce. Old
strings sound dull and lifeless, and they lose their tensility (their capability to

hold tension), becoming brittle. This condition makes the strings feel stiffer
and harder to fret, and because the strings no longer stretch to reach the fret,
they get tighter, causing your notes to go sharp, particularly up the neck.
You should replace all the strings at once, unless you break one and must
replace it quickly. The strings tend to wear at the same rate, so if you replace
all the old strings with new ones simultaneously, the strings start the race
against time on an equal footing.
The following list contains the conditions under which you should probably
replace your strings:
 They exhibit visible signs of corrosion or caked-on dirt or grime.
 They don’t play in tune, usually fretting sharp, especially in the upper
register.
 You can’t remember the last time you changed them and you have an
important gig (and don’t want to chance any breakage).
Removing Old Strings
Obviously, to put on a new string, you have to remove the old one. Unless
you’re really in a hurry (such as in the middle of the first verse, trying to get
your new string on and tuned up by the guitar solo), you can take off any
string by turning the tuning peg to loosen the string so much that you can
grab the string from the center and pull it off the post. You don’t need to wind
it completely off the post by using the peg.
A quicker method is to simply snip off the old string with wire cutters. It
seems weird and brutal to snip off a string, but neither the sudden release of
tension nor the cutting itself hurts the guitar. It does a number on the old
string, but you don’t need to concern yourself with that. (We have it on good
authority that guitar strings have no pain receptors.)
The only reason not to cut the string is to save it as a spare, in case the new
one breaks while putting it on (rare, but it happens). An old B string is better
than no B string.
A common misconception is that you should maintain constant string tension
on the guitar neck at all times. Therefore, you may hear that you should replace
the strings one at a time because removing all the strings is bad for the guitar,
but this simply isn’t true. Replacing strings one at a time is convenient for tuning
but is no healthier for the guitar. Guitars are made of tougher stuff than that.
296
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

However you remove the old string, after it’s off, you’re ready to put on a new
one. The methods for stringing a guitar diverge slightly, depending on whether
you’re stringing a steel-string acoustic, a classical, or an electric guitar.
Stringing a Steel-String Acoustic Guitar
Generally, steel-string acoustic guitars are probably easier to string than clas-
sicals or electrics (which we cover in later sections in this chapter).
Changing strings step-by-step
Following are step-by-step instructions on restringing your guitar. You have
two places to attach your new string: the bridge and the headstock. Start by
attaching the string to the bridge, which is a pretty straightforward task.
Step 1: Attaching the string to the bridge
Acoustic guitars have a bridge with six holes leading to the inside of the
guitar. To attach a new string to the bridge, follow these steps:
1. Remove the old string (see the section “Removing Old Strings”) and
pop out the bridge pin.
Bridge pins sometimes stick, so you may need to use a table knife to pry
it out, but be careful not to ding the wood. A better alternative is the
notched edge in a peg winder or needle-nose pliers. (See Chapter 16 for
more information on peg winders.)
2. Place the end of the new string that has a little brass ring (called a
ball) inside the hole that held the bridge pin.
Just stuff it down the hole a couple of inches. (How far isn’t critical,
because you’re going to pull it up soon.)
3. Wedge the bridge pin firmly back in the hole with the slot facing for-
ward (toward the nut).
The slot provides a channel for the string to get out. Figure 17-1 shows
the correct disposition for the new string and the bridge pin.
4. Pull gently on the string until the ball rests against the bottom of the
pin. Keep your thumb or finger on the pin so that it doesn’t pop out
and disappear into the abyss. 
Be careful not to kink the string as you pull it.
297
Chapter 17: Getting Strung Along: Changing Strings

5. Test the string by gently tugging on it.
If you don’t feel the string shift, the ball is snug against the bridge pin,
and you’re ready to secure the string to the tuning post, which is the
focus of the following section.
Step 2: Securing the string to the tuning post
After securely attaching the string to the bridge pin, you can focus your
attention on the headstock. The steps are slightly different for the treble
strings (G, B, E) and the bass strings (E, A, D). You wind treble strings clock-
wise and bass strings counterclockwise.
To attach a treble string to the tuning post, follow these steps:
1. Pass the string through the hole in the post.
Leave enough slack between the bridge pin and the tuning post to
enable you to wind the string around the post several times.
2. Kink (or crease) the metal wire toward the inside of the guitar.
Figure 17-2 shows how to kink the string to prepare it for winding.
Figure 17-1:

place 
the new
string in the

298
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

3. While keeping the string tight against the post with one hand, wind
the tuning peg clockwise with the other hand.
This step is a bit tricky and requires some manual dexterity (but so does
playing the guitar). Keep your eye on the post to ensure that as the
string wraps around the post, it winds down, toward the headstock sur-
face. Figure 17-3 shows how the strings wrap around the posts. Be sure
that the strings go into the correct slot in the nut. Don’t get discouraged
if you can’t get your windings to look exactly like the strings shown in
Figure 17-3. Getting everything to go smoothly takes a bit of practice.
Winding the string downward on the post increases what’s called the
breaking angle. The breaking angle is the angle between the post and the
nut. A sharper angle brings more tension down onto the nut and creates
better sustain, the length of time the note continues. To get the maxi-
mum angle, wind the string so that it sits as low as possible on the post.
(This fact is true for all guitars, not just acoustics.)
To attach a bass string, you follow the above steps except that you wind the
strings counterclockwise in Step 3 so that the string goes up the middle and
goes over the post to the left (as you face the headstock).
Figure 17-2:

299
Chapter 17: Getting Strung Along: Changing Strings

If you find that you’ve left too much slack, unwind the string and start again,
kinking the string farther down. If you don’t leave enough slack, your winding
doesn’t go all the way down the post, which may result in slipping if the string
doesn’t have enough length to grab firmly around the post. Neither situation
is tragic. You simply undo what you’ve done and try again. As may happen in
trying to get the two ends of a necktie the same length, you may need a
couple tries to get it right.
Tuning up
After you secure the string around the post, you can begin to hear the string
come up to pitch. As the string draws tight, place it in its correct nut slot. If
you’re changing strings one at a time, you can just tune the new one to the
old ones, which, presumably, are relatively in tune. Check out Chapter 2 for
the nuts and bolts (or was that nuts and posts?) of tuning your guitar.
After you get the string to the correct pitch, pull on it in various places up
and down its length to stretch it out a bit. Doing so can cause the string to go
flat — sometimes drastically if you left any loose windings on the post — so
tune it back up to pitch by winding the peg. Repeat the tune-stretch process
two or three times to help the new strings hold their pitch.
Using a peg winder to quickly turn the tuning pegs reduces your string-wind-
ing time considerably. A peg winder also features a notch in one side of the
sleeve that can help you pop a stuck bridge pin. Just make sure that you
don’t lose the pin when it comes flying out! Chapter 16 has more information
on peg winders.

Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

After the string is up to pitch and stretched out, you’re ready to remove the
excess string that sticks out from the post. You can snip this excess off with
wire cutters (if you have them) or bend the string back and forth over the
same crease until it breaks off.
Whatever you do, don’t leave the straight string length protruding. It could
poke you or someone standing next to you (such as the bass player) in the
eye or give you a sharp jab in your fingertip.
Stringing Nylon-String Guitars
Stringing a nylon-string guitar is different from stringing a steel-string
acoustic because both the bridge and the posts are different. Nylon string
guitars don’t use bridge pins (strings are tied off instead) and their head-
stocks are slotted and have rollers, as opposed to posts.
Changing strings step-by-step
In one sense, nylon strings are easier to deal with than steel strings are,
because nylon isn’t as springy as steel. Attaching the string to the tuning
post, however, can be a bit trickier. As you do with the steel-string acoustic,
begin by securing the bridge end of the string first and then turn your atten-
tion to the headstock.
Step 1: Securing the string to the bridge
Whereas steel-string acoustic strings have a ball at one end, nylon strings
have no such ball: Both ends are loose. (Well, you can buy ball-ended nylon-
string sets, but they’re not what you normally use.) You can, therefore, attach
either end of the string to the bridge. If the ends look different, however, use
the one that looks like the middle of the string, not the one that has the
loosely coiled appearance. Just follow these steps:
1. Remove the old string, as we describe in the section “Removing Old
Strings,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Pass one end of the new string through the hole in the top of the
bridge, in the direction away from the soundhole, leaving about 11⁄2
inches sticking out the rear of the hole.
301
Chapter 17: Getting Strung Along: Changing Strings

3. Secure the string by bringing the short end over the bridge and pass-
ing it under the long part of the string, as shown in Figure 17-4a. Then
pass the short end under, over, and then under itself, on the top of the
bridge, as shown in Figure 17-4b.
You may need a couple tries to get the end at just the right length, where
not too much excess is dangling off the top of the bridge. (You can
always cut the excess away, too.)
4. Pull on the long end of the string with one hand and move the knot
with the other to remove excess slack and cause the knot to lie flat
against the bridge.
Step 2: Securing the string to the tuning post
On a nylon-string guitar, the tuning posts (called rollers) pass through the
headstock sideways instead of going through perpendicularly as on a steel-
string acoustic or electric guitar. This configuration is known as a slotted
headstock.
To attach the string to the tuning post in a slotted headstock, follow these steps:
1. Pass the string through the hole in the tuning post. Bring the end of
the string back over the roller toward you; then pass the string under
itself in front of the hole. Pull up on the string end so that the long
part of the string (the part attached to the bridge) sits in the U-shaped
loop you just formed, as shown in Figure 17-5a.
a
b
Figure 17-4:
Tying off the
bridge end

302
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Make your loop come from the outside (that is, approaching from the
left on the lower three bass strings, and from the right on the upper
three treble strings). 
2. Pass the short end under and over itself, creating two or three wraps.
Doing so should hold the loose end firmly in place, as shown in Figure
17-5b, and prevent the string from slipping out of the hole.
3. Wind the peg so that the string wraps on top of the loop you just
formed, forcing it down against the post.
4. Pull the string length taut with one hand and turn the tuning peg with
the other hand.
Wrap the windings to the outside of the hole, away from the center of
the guitar.
Tuning up
As you continue turning the tuning peg, the string slowly comes nearer to
pitch. Nylon strings, like steel strings, require quite a bit of stretching out, so
after you get the string initially up to pitch, grab it at various places around
its length, pull on it, and then tune it up again. Repeat this process two or
three times to keep the guitar in tune longer.
Snip away the excess after you’re done with all six strings. Nylon strings
aren’t as dangerous as steel strings if any excess protrudes, but the extra
string hanging out is unsightly, and besides, classical guitarists are a little
fussier about how their instruments look than acoustic guitarists are.

Chapter 17: Getting Strung Along: Changing Strings

Stringing an Electric Guitar
Generally, electric guitarists need to change their strings more often than do
steel-string acoustic or classical guitarists. Because changing strings is so
common on electric guitars, builders take a more progressive approach to
the hardware, often making changing strings very quick and easy. Of the
three types of guitars — steel-string acoustic, classical, and electric — you
can change the strings on electric guitars most easily by far.
Changing strings step-by-step
As you would on steel-string acoustic and nylon-string guitars, begin string-
ing an electric guitar by first securing the string to the bridge and then
attaching the string to the headstock. Electric strings are similar to steel-
string acoustic strings in that they have ball ends and are made of metal, but
electric strings are usually composed of a lighter-gauge wire than steel-string
acoustic strings, and the 3rd string is unwound, or plain, whereas a steel-
string acoustic guitar’s is wound. (A nylon-string’s 3rd string also is unwound
but is a thicker nylon string.)
Step 1: Securing the string to the bridge
Most electric guitars use a simple method for securing the string to the bridge.
You pass the string through a hole in the bridge (sometimes reinforced with a
collar, or grommet) that’s smaller than the ball at the end of the string — so the
ball holds the string just as the knot at the end of a piece of thread holds a
stitch in fabric. On some guitars (such as the Fender Telecaster), the collars
anchor right into the body, and the strings pass through the back of the
instrument, through a hole in the bridge assembly, and out the top.
Figure 17-6 shows two designs for attaching a string to an electric: from a top-
mounted bridge and through the back. The following steps show how to
secure the strings to the bridge.
1. Remove the old string, as we describe in the section “Removing Old
Strings,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Anchor the string at the bridge by passing the string through the hole
(from the back or bottom of the guitar) until the ball stops the move-
ment. Then you’re ready to focus on the tuning post. You do this on all
but a few guitars (such as those fitted with a Floyd Rose mechanism
which we discuss at the end of the chapter).
304
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Step 2: Securing the string to the tuning post
In most cases, the posts on an electric resemble those of a steel-string
acoustic. A post protrudes through the headstock, and you pass your string
through the post’s hole, kink the string to the inside (toward the center of the
headstock), and begin winding while holding the long part of the string with
one hand for control. Refer to Figure 17-2 to see how to kink the string to pre-
pare it for winding and about how much slack to leave.
Some electric guitars, notably Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters, feature
string retainers, which are little rollers or channels screwed into the top of the
headstock that pull the top two or four strings down low onto the headstock,
sort of like a tent stake. If your guitar has string retainers, make sure that you
pass the strings under them.
Some tuners feature a locking mechanism, so that you don’t need to worry
about winding, slack, and all that bother. Inside the post hole is a viselike
device that clamps down on the string as it passes through. A knurled (ridge-
covered) dial underneath the headstock loosens and tightens the vise.
Perhaps the best-known company to make this locking device is Spurzel.

Chapter 17: Getting Strung Along: Changing Strings

Some guitars have tuners with slotted posts instead of a hole. These devices
also enable quick string changes, because you simply lay the string in the slot
at the top of the post, kink it, and begin winding. You don’t even need to leave
any slack for winding.
The special case of the Floyd Rose bridge
Rock music in the ’80s made extensive use of the whammy bar and floating
bridge (where the bridge isn’t fixed, but floats on a spring assembly).
Standard floating bridges weren’t meant for the kind of abuse that creative
guitarists such as Steve Vai and Joe Satriani cook up, however, so manufac-
turers developed better ways to make sure that bridges return to their origi-
nal position and the strings remain in tune.
Floyd Rose invented the most successful of these assemblies. Rose used his
own patented design to ensure a highly accurate, movable bridge system and
locking nut (a clamplike device that replaces the standard nut).
The bridge takes the strings in a top-mounted approach, instead of through
the back, but with one notable difference: Guitarists must snip the ball end
off before attaching the string so that the end can fit in the tiny viselike mech-
anism that holds the string in place. If you own a Floyd, you must carry a set
of spare strings with the balls snipped off or at least have wire cutters always
at the ready.
Because the Floyd Rose also features a locking nut, winding the string on the
post isn’t so critical. After you lock the nut (by using a small Allen wrench),
what you do with the tuning pegs doesn’t matter. You then do all tuning by
using ridge-covered knobs on the bridge. These knobs are known as “fine
tuners” because their movements are much smaller and more precise than
are those on the headstock.
Stringing up an electric guitar fitted with a Floyd Rose system takes a little
longer than it does on a regular electric, but if you plan to do a lot of
whammy bar work, a Floyd Rose is well worth the effort.

uitars are surprisingly hardy creatures. You can subject them to a rigor-
ous performing schedule, keep them up all night, bang on them relent-
lessly, and they don’t mind a bit.
Generally speaking, guitars never wear out, although you may need to
replace some parts and perform some tweaks along the way: Unlike your car
or body, you don’t need to do anything much to a guitar to keep it in excel-
lent health. 
If you don’t abuse it or subject it to extreme conditions, a guitar not only
stays structurally sound for decades, but it also plays in tune and remains
comfortable in your hands. In fact, guitars actually improve with age and use.
We should all be so lucky!
Even so, preventing a guitar from sustaining some injury or needing a few
repairs along the way is virtually impossible. You can and should practice
good guitar maintenance, and if your guitar does go out of whack, you can
perform the repairs yourself in most cases. If you’re at all in doubt about
your technical abilities, however — or if you’re just a plain klutz — consult a
qualified repairperson.

Some examples of repairs that you can perform yourself include eliminating
rattles, raising and lowering the strings at the bridge, removing dirt and
grime, replacing some worn or broken parts, and changing strings. Plus, we
devote all of Chapter 17 to changing strings, so turn to that chapter if you
just want to replace a broken or worn string.
Before starting on individual maintenance and repair issues, it may be helpful
to consult this quick guide to diagnose a guitar-related problem that you may
already have. Take a look at Table 18-1 to see whether your guitar suffers

Cleaning Your Guitar
The simplest type of maintenance is cleaning. You should clean your guitar
regularly or, intuitively enough, every time it gets dirty. If a guitar gets dirty, it
doesn’t exactly come home with mud on its shirt and grass stains on its
pants, but it does collect a laundry list of its own washday terrors.
Removing dirt and grime
Unless you live in a bubble, dust and dirt are part of your environment. Certain
objects just seem to attract dust (for example, the top of a TV set), and guitars
definitely attract their fair share. If dust collects under the strings on your
headstock and bridge, you can dust them off by using a cloth or a feather
duster. Feather dusters may seem silly things that only uniformed maids in old
movies use, but they serve a purpose: They knock the dust off an object with-
out applying pressure (which can scratch a delicate finish). So even if you don’t
use a feather duster — or if your maid’s outfit is at the cleaners — follow the
example of old Alice from The Brady Bunch and dust lightly.
As dust mixes with the natural moisture content of your hands and fingers
(and forearm, if you play in short sleeves, shirtless, or in the raw), that dust
becomes grime. Grime can stick to all surfaces, but it’s especially noticeable
on your strings.
310
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

The strings
The natural oils from your fingertips coat the strings every time you play. You
can’t see this oily coating, but it’s there, and over time, these oils corrode the
string material and create a grimy buildup (which is not only icky, but also
impedes play and can actually injure the wood over time). String grime
makes the strings go dead sooner and wear out faster than they normally do;
if you let the condition go too long, the string grime can even seep into the
pores of the fingerboard. Yuck!
The best way to combat the grimy-buildup menace is to wipe down the
strings after every playing session, just before you put the guitar back in the
case. (Notice that we’re assuming that you put the guitar back in the case —
another “case” of good preventative maintenance; see Chapter 16.) Chamois
(pronounced “shammy”) is a great material to use to wipe the strings
because it doubles as a polishing cloth; a (clean) cotton diaper, however,
works well, too (but no disposable diapers, please). Bandannas may give you
that Willie Nelson/Janis Joplin appeal, but they’re not made of good
absorbent material, so keep your bandanna around your neck or on your
head, and don’t wipe your guitar with it.
Give the strings a general wipe down and then pinch each string between
your thumb and index finger, with the cloth in between, and run your hand
up and down the string length. This dries the string all the way around its cir-
cumference and shucks off any grunge. That’s all you need to do to maintain
clean strings and increase their useful life many times over. (And while you’re
at it, wipe the back of the guitar neck, too.)
The wood
A guitar is mostly wood, and wood likes a good rubdown. (Hey, who doesn’t?)
If you have a really dusty guitar — for example, one that’s been sitting open
in a musty attic for a while — blow the excess dust off before you start dust-
ing with a cloth (or feather duster). This simple act may prevent a scratch or
abrasion in the finish.
Gently rub the various places on the guitar until it’s dust-free. You may need
to frequently shake out your dust cloth, so do so outside, or you’re going to
be wiping sneezes off your guitar as well as the dust. Unless your guitar is
really dirty — maybe displaying some caked-on gunk that you don’t even
want to know the origin of — dusting is all you need to do to the wood.
If dullness persists or a grimy film is clearly present over the finish, you can
rub your guitar down with furniture polish or, better yet, guitar polish. Guitar
polish is made specifically for the finishes that the manufacturers use on guitars,
311
Chapter 18: Staying Fit: Basic Maintenance and Repairs

whereas some furniture polish may contain abrasives. If you’re at all in
doubt, use the guitar goop that music stores sell. And follow the directions
on the bottle.
Although the guitar-goop companies write this information on the label, it
bears repeating here: Never put any liquid or spray polish directly onto the
guitar surface. Doing so could soak and stain the wood permanently. Pour or
spray the substance onto your dustcloth and work it in a bit before putting
the cloth to wood.
To dust between the strings in hard-to-reach places such as the headstock,
bridge, and pickup areas, use a small camel’s hair paintbrush. Keep the brush
in your case.
The hardware
Grimy buildup doesn’t really hurt hardware (tuners, bridges, and so on) the
way that it can more porous wood, but it sure looks bad — and you don’t
want to appear on MTV with hardware that’s duller than your drummer. (Just
kidding, fellow percussionists!)
Rubbing with a dustcloth is all you really need to do for your guitar’s hardware,
but you can certainly use a mild jewelry or chrome polish if you want — as
long as it’s not abrasive. Polish not only removes really greasy residue (which
a simple wipe won’t do), but also brings the hardware to a luster — very
important for TV lights.
Many inexpensive hardware components are dipped, meaning that they have
a thin coating of shiny metal over an otherwise ugly and mottled-looking sur-
face. So you don’t want to rub through the coating (which could happen with
repeated polishing). And you certainly (we hope) don’t want to get any liquid
polish in the moving parts of a tuning machine.
Don’t ever touch the pickups of an electric guitar with anything other than a
dry cloth or your dusting brush. Pickups are magnetic and abhor liquid as
much as the Wicked Witch of the West did. You don’t want to risk upsetting a
pickup’s sensitive magnetic fields with liquid, my pretty.
Caring for the finish
Acoustic guitars have a finish of lacquer or another synthetic coating to pro-
tect the wood’s surface and give it a shiny appearance. Whether your instru-
ment has a high-gloss finish or the satin variety (more subdued and natural-
looking), the plan is the same: Keep the finish dust-free so that it stays shiny
312
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

and transparent for years. Don’t subject your guitar to direct sunlight for long
periods of time and avoid drastic humidity and temperature changes. Follow-
ing these simple guidelines helps keep the finish from checking (cracking) as
it swells and shrinks along with the wood.
If your finish ever cracks because of a ding (a small inadvertent gouge, such
as occurs if you bang your guitar into the corner of the table), take it to a
repairperson quickly to prevent the crack from spreading like a spider pat-
tern on a windshield.
Protecting Your Guitar
If you play guitar, you certainly don’t want to keep it a secret. Well, in the
beginning maybe, but after you can play a little bit, you want to bring your
music to the people. Unless you plan on doing a lot of entertaining — as in
having people come over to your place — you need to take your guitar out
into the world. And that requires protection. Never leave the house without
putting the guitar in some kind of protective case.
On the road
Most people don’t even think about the guitar’s health as they toss their
favorite acoustic into the station wagon and head for the beach. But they
should. Using a bit of common sense can keep your guitar looking like a
guitar instead of a surfboard.
If you’re traveling in a car, keep the guitar in the passenger compartment
where you can exercise control over the environment. A guitar in a trunk or
untreated luggage compartment gets either too hot or too cold in comparison
to what the humans are experiencing up front. (Guitars like to listen to the
radio, too, as long as it’s not playing disco or Milli Vanilli.)
If you must put the guitar in with the spare tire, push it all the way forward so
that it can benefit from some “environmental osmosis” (meaning that it’s not
going to get quite as cold or hot next to the climate-controlled passenger
cabin as it is at the rear of the car). This practice also helps if, heaven forbid,
you’re ever rear-ended. You can pay a couple of bucks to have Freddie’s
Fender Fix-it repair your car, but all the king’s horses and all the king’s men
can’t restore the splinters of your priceless acoustic should it absorb the
brunt of a bumptious Buick.
313
Chapter 18: Staying Fit: Basic Maintenance and Repairs

A hardshell case is a better form of protection for a guitar than either a nylon
gig bag or a cardboardlike soft case. With a hardshell case, you can stack
things on top, whereas other cases require the guitar to be at the top of the
heap, which may or may not please an obsessive trunk-packer. (You know,
like your old man used to pack before the big family vacation.) See Chapter 16
for more information on cases.
Nylon gig bags are lightweight and offer almost no protection from a blow,
but they do fend off dings. If you know the guitar is never going to leave your
shoulder, you can use a gig bag. Gig bags also enable an electric guitar to fit
in the overhead compartments of most aircraft. Savvy travelers know what
kinds of crafts can accommodate a gig bag and stand in line early to secure a
berth for their precious cargo.
In storage
Whether you’re going on a long vacation, or doing three-to-five in the slam-
mer, you may, at some point, need to store your guitar for a long period of
time. Keep the guitar in its case and put the case in a closet or under a bed.
Try to keep the guitar in a climate controlled environment rather than a
damp basement or uninsulated attic.
If you store the guitar, you can lay it flat or on edge. The exact position makes
no difference to the guitar. You don’t need to loosen the strings significantly,
but dropping them down a half step or so ensures against excess tension on
the neck, should it swell or shrink slightly.
Providing a Healthy Environment
Guitars are made under specific temperature and humidity conditions. To
keep the guitar playing and sounding as the builder intended, you must main-
tain an environment within the same approximate range of the original.
If a human is comfortable, a guitar is comfortable. Keep the environment near
room temperature (about 72 degrees Fahrenheit) and the relative humidity at
about 50 percent, and you’re never going to hear your guitar complain (even
if you have a talking guitar). Don’t go too far with this rule about guitars and
humans being comfortable under the same conditions, however. You shouldn’t
put your guitar in a hot tub even if you offer it a margarita, no matter how
comfortable that makes you.
314
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Temperature settings
A guitar can exist comfortably in a range of temperatures between about 65
and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. For a guitar, heat is worse than cold, so keep the
guitar out of the sun and avoid leaving a guitar to sit in a hot car trunk all day.
If your guitar’s been cold for several hours because it was riding in the back
of the truck that you drove from North Dakota to Minnesota in December,
give the guitar time to warm up gradually after you bring it indoors. A good
practice is to leave the guitar in its case until the case warms up to room tem-
perature. Avoid exposing the guitar to radical temperature shifts if at all pos-
sible to prevent finish checking, the cracking of your finish that results
because it can’t expand and contract well enough with the wood beneath it.
Humidity
Guitars, whether they’re made in Hawaii or Arizona, are all built under humidity-
controlled conditions, which stay at about 50 percent. To enable your guitar
to maintain the lifestyle that its maker intended for it, you must also maintain
that humidity at about 45 to 55 percent. (If you live in a dry or wet climate
and compensate with a humidifier or dehumidifier, you should aim for those
settings as a healthy human anyway.) Guitars that get too dry crack; guitars
that absorb too much moisture swell and buckle.
If you can’t afford either a humidifier or dehumidifier, you can achieve good
results with the following inexpensive solutions:
 Guitar humidifier: This item is simply a rubber-enclosed sponge that
you saturate with water, squeeze the excess out of, and then clip onto
the inside of the soundhole or keep inside the case to raise the humidity
level.
 Desiccant: A desiccant is a powder or crystal substance that usually
comes in small packets and draws humidity out of the air, lowering the
local relative humidity level. Silicagel is a common brand, and packets
often come in the cases of new guitars.
 Hygrometer: You can buy this inexpensive device at any hardware store;
it tells you the relative humidity of a room with a good degree of accu-
racy (close enough to maintain a healthy guitar anyway). Get the
portable kind (as opposed to the wall-hanging variety) so that you can
transport it if you need to or even keep it inside the guitar case.

Chapter 18: Staying Fit: Basic Maintenance and Repairs

Do-It-Yourself Repairs
If you turn on the light in your house and the bulb blows, do you call a handy-
man? Of course not. You look at the dead bulb to note its wattage, go to the
closet, get the right replacement bulb, and in a jiffy, you’re bathed in 60-watt
luminescence. You suffer no anxiety about performing that “repair,” right?
If you can develop this same intuitive approach toward your guitar, you can
perform simple adjustments, tweaks, and repairs. Nothing magical goes on in
a guitar mechanically. The magic comes in the way that it produces that glori-
ous sound, not in how the tuning machines work or the way the strings
attach to the bridge. The following sections describe several adjustments,
replacements, and repairs you can perform yourself.
Tightening loose connections
A guitar is a system of moving parts, many of which are mechanical, and as
anyone who’s ever owned a car can attest, moving things come loose. In gui-
tars, the hardware connections are what typically work themselves loose,
such as the nuts on the bridge post or the screws that hold down the pickup
covers.
If you hear a rattle, try strumming with one hand to re-create the rattle while
touching the various suspects with your other hand. As you touch the offend-
ing culprit, the rattle usually stops. Then you can take appropriate measures
to tighten up whatever’s come loose. (Screws in tuning machines, pickup
covers, or jack plates are the most common.) Usually that involves using
ordinary tools — screwdrivers, wrenches, chain saws (just kidding) — but
designed for the appropriated-sized screws, nuts, and so on. Take an inven-
tory of the sizes and shapes of the screws, nuts, and bolts on your guitar and
create a miniature tool kit just for fixing your instrument. (For more on this
topic, see “Having the Right Tools” later in the chapter.)
Adjusting the neck and bridge
Guitars do change over time (such as in going from one season to another),
especially if your environment experiences temperature and humidity
swings. If the temperature and humidity change frequently, the guitar natu-
rally absorbs or loses moisture, which causes the wood to swell or shrink.
This condition is normal and doesn’t hurt the guitar.
316
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

The problem with this expansion and contraction lies in the fact that the
playing and setup tolerances are fairly critical, so a slight bow in the neck
results in a guitar that plays buzzy or is suddenly much harder to fret. If this
situation occurs, you can often correct the problem through a simple adjust-
ment of the neck and/or bridge.
Tightening and loosening the truss rod
The neck of most guitars has what’s known as a truss rod, which is a one- or
two-piece adjustable metal rod that goes down the inside of the center of the
neck. You can adjust the truss rod with a nut located at one end. Different
manufacturers put them in different places, but they’re usually at the head-
stock, under a cap just behind the nut, or where the neck joins the body, just
under the fingerboard. Some older models don’t have truss rods or, in the
case of old Martin guitars, have truss rods that you can’t adjust without
taking off the fingerboard. All newer guitars have accessible truss rods.
All guitars come with their particular truss-rod wrench, so if you don’t have a
truss rod wrench for your guitar, try to find a replacement immediately. (Try
your local guitar store first and, failing that, get in touch with the manufac-
turer itself.)
The necessary truss-rod adjustment depends on which way the neck bows:
 If your neck bows outward between the seventh and twelfth frets, creat-
ing a large gap that makes pressing down the strings difficult, tighten the
truss rod by turning the nut clockwise (as you face the nut straight on).
Tighten the nut a quarter turn at a time, giving the neck a few minutes to
adjust after each turn. (You can play during the adjustment time.)
 If your neck bows inward between the seventh and twelfth frets, causing
the strings to buzz and fret out (that is, come in contact with frets they’re
not supposed to as you press down the strings), loosen the truss rod
with the truss-rod wrench. Turn the nut a quarter turn at a time,
enabling the neck to adjust after each turn.
If you can’t correct the problem in a few full turns, stop. You may need a qual-
ified repairperson to investigate. Overtightening or overloosening a truss rod
can damage the neck and/or body.
Action
Action is how a guitar plays, specifically the distance of the strings to the fin-
gerboard. If the strings sit too high, they’re hard to fret; if they’re too low,
buzzing occurs. In either case, you have to adjust the action. You usually do
this by raising or lowering components of the bridge known as saddles (the
317
Chapter 18: Staying Fit: Basic Maintenance and Repairs

parts just in front of the bridge where the strings sit). You raise or lower the
saddle by turning the hex screws with a tiny hex wrench. Turn the screw clock-
wise to raise the saddle; turn it counter-clockwise to lower the saddle. If the
saddle has two hex screws, be sure to turn them the same amount so that 
the saddle stays level. (Figure 18-1 shows the saddles’ hex screws.)
Intonation
Intonation refers to the accuracy of the pitches produced by fretting. For
example, if you play the twelfth fret, the resulting note should be exactly an
octave higher than the open string. If the twelfth fret note is slightly higher
than an octave, your string is fretting sharp; if the twelfth fret note is slightly
lower than an octave, the string is fretting flat. You can correct a string’s into-
nation by moving the saddle away from the nut if the string frets sharp and
toward the nut if the string frets flat. Different bridges have different methods
for this, but it’s pretty obvious after you look at the bridge assembly carefully. 
In one common mechanism (used on Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters),
screws at the back of the bridge determine the saddle front-to-back position.
Here’s how they work:
 Turning the screw clockwise (with a simple Phillips or flat-head 
screwdriver — being careful not to ding the top with the handle as 
you turn the screw) pulls the saddle back toward the bridge, which 
corrects a string that frets sharp. 
 Turning the screw counter-clockwise moves the saddle toward the nut,
which corrects a string that frets flat. 
Figure 18-1:
Turn the
saddles’ hex
screws to

lower the
action.
318
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

Keep in mind that adjusting the saddle for a string corrects only that string.
You must perform intonation adjustments for each string. So don’t invite us
to that 38-string guitar’s intonation adjustment!
Put on brand-new strings before you adjust the intonation. Old strings often
fret sharp and don’t give you a true reading of your intonation. (For more
information on replacing strings, see Chapter 17.)
Replacing worn or old parts
The following sections list all the parts on your guitar that are most likely to
wear out or break and need replacing. You can perform any of these fixes
yourself without doing damage to the guitar — even if you screw up.
Tuning machines
Tuning machines consist of a system of gears and shafts, and as the clutch on
your car usually does eventually (or the automatic transmission if you never got
that whole stick thing), tuners can wear out. Tuning machines deal with a lot of
stress and tension, and we don’t mean the kind that you endure at your job.
Tuning machines simply screw into the guitar’s headstock with wood screws
(after you push the post through the hole and fasten the hex nut on top); so,
if you have a worn or stripped gear, consider replacing the entire machine. If
more than one tuner is giving you trouble, consider replacing the entire set.
Check that the replacement machine has its screws in the same positions as
the original, because you don’t want to drill new holes in your headstock. If
you’re having trouble matching the holes of your new machines with the exist-
ing ones already drilled in your headstock, take the guitar to a repairperson.
Strap pins
Strap pins are the little “buttons” that you put through your strap holes to
attach the strap to your instrument. The strap pins usually attach to the
guitar with ordinary wood screws, and they can sometimes work themselves
loose. If simply tightening the wood screw with a screwdriver doesn’t do the
trick, try applying a little white glue on the screw threads and put it back in. If
it’s still loose, take the guitar to a repairperson.
Bridge springs
If an electric guitar doesn’t have a whammy bar, its bridge affixes directly to
the guitar’s body. This setup is known as a fixed bridge. If the guitar does have
a whammy bar, however, it has a floating bridge. A floating bridge is one that
319
Chapter 18: Staying Fit: Basic Maintenance and Repairs

is held in place by the string tension (which pulls it one way), and a set of
metal springs — known as bridge springs — which pull in the opposite direc-
tion, holding the bridge in balance. You can find the springs (which are about
2 inches long and 1⁄4 inch wide) in the back cavity of the body (see Figure 18-2). 
If one of the springs loses tension through age and wear, your guitar will go
out of tune when you use the whammy bar. When this happens, replace the
springs; change them all at once so that they wear evenly. The springs just
hook onto little hooks, and with a little tugging and the aid of pliers, you can
pop them off and on in no time. You can even tighten the screws on the plate
(called the claw) where the hooks attach, increasing the spring tension. Don’t
worry — these springs don’t go sproingggg and hit you in the eye or go flying
off across the room.
Some people like a loose bridge (which is more responsive but goes out of
tune more easily) and some like a tight bridge:
Figure 18-2:
The bridge

back cavity.
320
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

 If you like a stiff bridge that stays in tune (and who doesn’t!) and you
only occasionally use the whammy bar, go for a stiff bridge setup. The
more springs, the tighter the bridge; so if you have a two-spring setup,
consider switching to a three-spring setup.
 If you like to use the bar and you’re willing to trade a little tuning trouble
for having a bridge with a lot of play, consider a looser setup. Guitarists
who like to create ambient music (atmospheric music without a defined
melody) prefer flexible bridges, because they do a lot of dips and pulls
on the bar.
Crackling controls
Dust and rust (oxidation) pose a potential threat to any electronic connec-
tion, and your guitar is no exception. If your volume and tone knobs start to
make crackling or popping noises through your speaker whenever you’re
plugged in, or if the signal is weak, inconsistent, or cuts out altogether in cer-
tain positions on your controls, some foreign matter (however minute) has
probably lodged itself in your controls.
Vigorously turn the knobs back and forth around the trouble spot to work out
the dust or rub off the little bit of corrosion that may be causing the problem.
You may need to perform this action several times on each knob, in different
places in the knob’s travel. If turning the knobs doesn’t do the trick, you may
need a repairperson to give your pots (short for potentiometer, the variable
resistors on your volume and tone controls) a thorough cleaning.
Loose jacks
On electric guitars, you do a lot of plugging and unplugging of your cable, and
these actions can eventually loosen the output jack, causing a crackling
sound through the speaker. This crackling indicates a disconnected ground
wire. Here’s the fix: Take off the jack plate or pick guard and locate the
detached wire causing the problem.
 If you’re handy with a soldering iron, attach the broken wire back to its
original lug, and you’re done. You may even feel like a real electrician. 
 If you’re not handy, have a friend who is do the job or take the instru-
ment in to the shop.
Replacement pickups
Replacing your pickups can seem like a daunting task, but it’s really a very
simple one. Often, the best way to change your sound (assuming that you like
321
Chapter 18: Staying Fit: Basic Maintenance and Repairs

the way your guitar plays and looks) is to substitute replacement pickups for
the originals — especially if the originals weren’t too good to begin with.
Here’s how:
1. Purchase pickups of the same size and type as the originals.
Doing so ensures that they fit into the existing holes and hook up the
same way electrically. 
2. Connect and solder two or three wires.
Clear directions come with the new pickups.
3. Seat the pickups in the cavities.
You’re not dealing with high-voltage electricity either, so you can’t hurt
yourself or the electronics if you wire something backward. 
Again, however, if you don’t feel comfortable doing the job yourself, enlist the
aid of a handy friend or take your guitar to a repairperson.
Changing your pickups is like changing your car’s oil. You can do the job
yourself and save money, but you may choose not to because of the hassle.
Having the Right Tools
Assemble a permanent tool kit containing all the tools that you need for your
guitar. Don’t “cannibalize” this set if you’re doing other household fixes. Buy
two sets of tools — one for general use and one that never leaves your guitar
case or gig bag. Look at your guitar to determine what kind of tools you may
need should something come loose. Determine (through trial-and-error)
whether your guitar’s screws, bolts, and nuts are metric or not. Here’s a list
of what you need:
 A set of miniature screwdrivers: A quick inspection of the kinds of
screws on an electric guitar reveals different-sized Phillips-head and slot-
ted varieties in several places: the strap pins, the pickup cover, the pick-
guard, the tuning-machine mounts, the set screws (the screws that hold
the tuning button to the shaft), the string retainers (the metal devices on
the headstock — between the tuning posts and the nut — that hold
down the strings on Strats and Teles), the volume and tone controls, and
the on-the-neck back plates.
 A miniature ratchet set: You can also find several places for bolts: the
output jack and the tuning-post collars (hex-shaped nuts on top of the
headstock that keep the posts from wobbling). A miniature ratchet set
322
Part V: Purchasing and Caring for Your Guitar 

gives you better leverage and a better angle than does a small crescent
wrench.
 A hex wrench and an Allen wrench: The truss rod takes its own tool,
usually a hex wrench, which usually comes with the guitar if you buy it
new. If your guitar doesn’t have one (because you bought it used or
you’ve lost it since buying it new), get the right one for your guitar and
keep it in the case at all times.
Floating bridge systems, including those by Floyd Rose, require hex or
Allen wrenches to adjust the saddles and other elements of the assem-
bly. Keep these wrenches on hand in case you break a string.
Ten Things That You Can’t Do Yourself
Some repairs always require a qualified repairperson to fix (assuming that
anyone can repair them at all). Among such repairs are the following:
 Fixing finish cracks.
 Repairing dings and scratches (if they’re severe and go through the
finish to the wood).
 Filing worn frets. (If frets start to develop grooves or crevices, they need
a pro to file or replace them.)
 Fixing pickup failure or weakening. (One pickup is seriously out of bal-
ance with another, you have possible magnetic damage to the pickup
itself, or one of the electronic components in a pickup fails.)
 Fixing dirty volume and tone knobs (if vigorous turning back and forth
no longer eliminates the crackle such dirt causes).
 Solving grounding problems. (You check the cavity and no wires are
loose, but you still have inordinate noise problems.)
 Fixing severe neck distortion (twisting or severe bowing).
 Healing certain injuries and breakage (such as the nut, fingerboard, 
or headstock).
 Refinishing or restoring your guitar’s wood. (Don’t even get near your
guitar’s finish with a sander or wood chemicals.)
 Rewiring your electronics. (You decide, say, to replace your five-way
with on/off switches, install a coil-tap and phase-reversal switch if any
two adjacent pickups are active, plus insert a presence-boost knob in
place of the second volume control . . . .)
323
Chapter 18: Staying Fit: Basic Maintenance and Repairs

Huh?! If you understand that last one, you may be beyond Guitar For Dummies!
If you have any anxiety about performing any repair or maintenance routine,
take the guitar to a repairperson. A repairperson can tell you whether the
problem is something you can fix yourself and maybe even show you how 
to do it correctly the next time the problem occurs. You’re much better off
being safe (and out a couple of bucks) than taking a chance of damaging 
your guitar.

R
egardless of style, certain guitarists have made their mark on the world
of guitar so that any guitarist who comes along after them has a hard
time escaping their legacy. We present here, in chronological order, ten who
mattered and why they mattered.
Andrés Segovia (1893–1987)
Not only was Segovia the most famous classical guitarist of all time, but he
also literally invented the genre. Before his arrival, the guitar was a lowly
instrument of the peasant classes. Segovia began performing Bach pieces and
other serious classical music on the guitar (writing many of his own tran-
scriptions), eventually elevating this “parlor” activity to a world-class style.
His incredible performing career lasted more than 70 years. His signature
pieces include Bach’s “Chaconne” and Albeniz’s “Granada.”
Charlie Christian (1916–42)
Charlie Christian invented the art of electric jazz guitar. His fluid solos with
Benny Goodman’s big band and smaller combos were sophisticated, scintil-
lating, and years ahead of their time. After hours, he used to jam with fellow
jazz rebels at Minton’s in New York, where his adventurous improvisations
helped create the genre known as bebop. Christian played the guitar like a
horn, incorporating intervallic (non-stepwise) motion into his lines. His signa-
ture tunes include “I Found a New Baby” and “I Got Rhythm.”

Chet Atkins (1924–2001)
Known as “Mr. Guitar,” Atkins is the definitive country guitarist. Building on
Merle Travis’ fast fingerpicking technique, Atkins refined the style, adding
jazz, classical, and pop nuances to create a truly sophisticated country-guitar
approach. He’s played with Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, and countless
country stars over the decades. His signature tunes include “Stars and
Stripes Forever” and “Yankee Doodle Dixie.”
Wes Montgomery (1925–68)
A legendary jazz player, Wes’s brand of cool jazz was based on the fact that he
used his thumb to sound notes, instead of a traditional guitar pick. Another of
his innovations was the use of octaves (that is, two identical notes in different
ranges) to create fat, moving, unison lines. He died young, but his proponents
still call him one of the all-time jazz greats. His signature tunes include “Four
on Six” and “Polka Dots and Moonbeams.”
B.B. King (1925– )
Although he wasn’t the first electric bluesman, B.B. King is easily the most
popular: His swinging, high-voltage guitar style complements charismatic
stagemanship and a huge, gospel-fueled voice. Along with his trademark ES-
355 guitar, nicknamed “Lucille,” King’s minimalist soloing technique and mas-
sive finger vibrato has cemented his place in the annals of electric blues
history. His signature tunes include “Every Day I Have the Blues” and “The
Thrill Is Gone.”
Chuck Berry (1926– )
Perhaps rock’s first real guitar hero, Berry used fast, rhythmic double-stops
to create his signature guitar style. Although some regard him equally for his
songwriting and lyric-writing skills, his fire-breathing breaks made his signa-
ture tunes “Johnny B. Goode,” “Rockin’ in the U.S.A.,” and “Maybelline,” bona
fide guitar classics.
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Jimi Hendrix (1942–70)
Considered the greatest rock guitarist of all time, Hendrix fused R&B, blues,
rock, and psychedelia into a mesmerizing sonic soup. His 1967 breakthrough
at the Monterey Pop Festival instantly rewrote the rock guitar textbook, espe-
cially after he whipped off his Stratocaster and lit it on fire. Young guitarists
religiously copy his licks to this day. Hendrix was known for his fiery aban-
don (even when his guitar wasn’t actually on fire) and innovative work with
feedback and the whammy bar. His signature tunes include “Purple Haze” and
“Little Wing.”
Jimmy Page (1944– )
Page succeeded Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck in the Yardbirds, but he didn’t
really find his niche until forming Led Zeppelin, one of the great ’70s rock
bands. Page’s forte was the art of recording guitars, layering track upon track
to construct thundering avalanches of electrified tone. Yet he could also play
sublime acoustic guitar, regularly employing unusual tunings and global influ-
ences. In rock circles, his six-string creativity in the studio is unmatched. His
signature tunes include “Stairway to Heaven” and “Whole Lotta Love.”
Eric Clapton (1945– )
In many ways, Clapton is the father of contemporary rock guitar. Before
Hendrix, Beck, and Page showed up, the Yardbirds-era Clapton was already
fusing electric Chicago blues with the fury of rock ’n’ roll. He later expanded
upon this style in Cream, Blind Faith, and the legendary Derek and the
Dominoes. Clapton eventually went solo, turning into one of the most popular
recording artists of the last 20 years. A true living legend, his signature tunes
include “Crossroads” and “Layla.”
Eddie Van Halen (1955– )
Rock guitar’s equivalent to Jackson Pollock, Eddie Van Halen’s splatter-note
approach to metal guitar completely reinvented the style starting in the late
’70s. He turned two-handed tapping into a common guitar technique (thanks
to his groundbreaking “Eruption”), while pushing the limits of whammy-bar
329
Chapter 19: Ten Guitarists You Should Know

and hammer-on expertise. He is also a master at fusing blues-based rock with
modern techniques, and his rhythm playing is one of the best examples of the
integrated style (combining low-note riffs with chords and double-stops). A
guitar hero in every sense of the term, his signature tunes include “Eruption”
and “Panama.”

o musical instrument offers a greater variety of appearance, function,
and sound than a guitar. Whether it’s the quietly elegant Ramirez, the
smoothly debonair D’Angelico, or the raucously funky Telecaster, each guitar
presented below has left an indelible mark on the guitar-playing canon and
will forever be known as a classic.
D’Angelico Archtop
Manufactured: 1932–1964
Considered by many to be the greatest jazz guitar ever made, D’Angelicos
were custom archtop (the tops were arched slightly instead of flat like steel-
string folk guitars) hollow-bodies built by the grand master of the genre, John
D’Angelico (1905–64). In addition to their warm, lush tone, these guitars were
meticulously constructed and graced with some of the most elegant decora-
tions of all time.

Fender Stratocaster
Manufactured: 1954–
The world’s most famous electric guitar, the Stratocaster was designed as a
space-age instrument in the early ’50s, featuring sleek lines, trebly tone, and
small body dimensions (at least compared to the huge jazz archtops of the
day). In the hands of masters such as Buddy Holly, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray
Vaughan, and Eric Clapton, this solid-body ax became ubiquitous, and today,
you can’t go into any guitar store without seeing at least a few Strats on the wall.
Fender Telecaster
Manufactured: 1951–
Fender’s other great contribution to electric guitar lore is the Telecaster,
which was also the first commercially made solid-body (1950). The Tele made
its mark in the country world, adding a bright, twangy sound to countless
recordings. A simple guitar made out of a plank of ash or alder, basic elec-
tronics, and a maple neck, it set the standard for electric guitar design and
remains a classic today.
Gibson ES-335
Manufactured: 1958–
Introduced in the late 1950s, this ax is a thin “semihollow-body” design,
which sought to combine the acoustic qualities of a big archtop with the
compactness of a solid-body electric. The result was a superb guitar with a
smooth woody tone, good for both clean jazz and heavy rock ’n’ roll. This
guitar’s most famous advocate was ’70s jazz-popper Larry Carlton, also
known as “Mr. 335.”
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Gibson J-200
Manufactured: 1937–
For a booming acoustic tone and stylish looks, look no farther than Gibson’s
venerable J-200. This “jumbo” steel-string was targeted toward country 
guitarists and quickly became a Nashville classic. Of special note is its highly
ornamental rosewood and mother-of-pearl inlaid bridge, which is shaped
something like a mustache.
Gibson Les Paul
Manufactured: 1952–
Named after Les Paul, the ’50s jazz-pop sensation, the Gibson Les Paul model
ironically went on to become one of the definitive rock ’n’ roll instruments.
Championed by Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck, this single-cutaway electric
exudes the fat, bassy tone that helped define the sound of hard rock and
heavy metal. Some original models from the late 1950s — notably the 1959
Standard — can now fetch more than $75,000.
Gretsch 6120
Manufactured: 1954–
Best known as country virtuoso Chet Atkins’s main electric guitar, the big,
funky tones of this hollow-body were common on many ’50s and ’60s rock
and country records. With its unusual FilterTron pickups and warbly Bigsby
vibrato bar, the 6120 also gave early rocker Duane Eddy his signature twangy
guitar sound.
Martin D-28
Manufactured: 1931–
Martin first mass-produced “dreadnought” (named after a class of battleship)
acoustic guitars in 1931 and its D-28 is the quintessential example of that
great design. With a fat waist and bass-heavy tone, this big guitar became
integral to the sounds of country, bluegrass, and, indeed, just about all steel-
string acoustic music.
335
Chapter 20: Ten Guitars You Should Know

Ramirez Classical
Manufactured: mid-1800s
Serious classical and flamenco guitarists often consider playing only one kind
of guitar — a Ramirez. First built in the mid-19th century, Jose Ramirez’s clas-
sical guitars helped define the style, with soft gut (later, nylon) strings, superb
workmanship, and a luscious tone. Among Ramirez’s earliest champions was
none other than the master, Andrés Segovia, himself.
Rickenbacker 360-12
Manufactured: 1963–
The ringing guitar tone on early Beatles and Byrds records came from one
great guitar: the Rickenbacker 360-12. A semihollow-body electric with 12
strings, this classic has a completely distinctive tone in the guitar universe.
The timeless Rick sound later resurfaced in the ’80s on smash records by Tom
Petty and R.E.M., among many others.

f you’d like to move beyond simply reading tab num-
bers, Appendix A is for you. Here, we show how to
make sense of the various dots, lines, and squiggles that
appear in standard music notation. You also see how to
find, on your fretboard, any note you might encounter in
standard notation. Appendix B shows you, at a glance,
how to play 96 of the most widely used chords — a must
for any guitarist. Finally, in Appendix C, you find useful
tips for getting the most out of your accompanying inter-
active CD.

Appendix A
How to Read Music
R
eading music can seem intimidating at first, but it’s not difficult at all.
Even little children can do it. This appendix explains the concepts of
reading music in the context of a familiar song. After reading this, you can
practice your music reading by working on the songs throughout this book
using the standard notation instead of the tab. (If you have trouble getting
the durations, you can check them against the CD. And if you have trouble
with the pitches, you can refer to the tab.)
The important thing to understand about written music is that it tells you
three kinds of information all at the same time: pitch (the note’s name), dura-
tion (how long to hold the note), and expression and articulation (how you
play the note). If you think about how it all fits together, you recognize that
our written music system is really pretty ingenious — three kinds of informa-
tion all at the same time and in such a way that any musician can look at it
and play just what the composer intended! Take a closer look at these three
kinds of information that written music conveys simultaneously:
 Pitch: This element tells you which notes (or pitches) to play (A, B, C,
and so on) by the location of noteheads (the oval-shaped symbols) on a
five-line staff. The notes take their names from the first seven letters of
the alphabet (A–G), with the pitches getting higher as the letters pro-
ceed from A. After G, the next higher note is A again. (If you call it “H,”
you’re sure to get some funny looks.) 
 Duration: This element of music tells you how long to hold each note rel-
ative to the pulse, or beat. You may, for example, hold a note for one beat
or two beats or only half a beat. The symbols that music scores use for
duration are whole notes (w), half notes (h), quarter notes (q), eighth
notes (e), 16th notes (x), and so on. 
 Expression and articulation: These elements tell you how to play the
notes — loudly or softly, smoothly or detached, with great emotion or
with no emotion (that one’s rare). These instructions can consist of
either little marks written above or below the noteheads or little verbal
messages written into the music. Often, the words are in Italian (piano,
mezzo-forte, staccato) because when composers started adding expres-
sion and articulation to their scores, the Italians had the most influence
in the music scene. Besides, Italian sounds so much more romantic than
English or German.

Review the notational elements in order, referring to the explanations that
follow for each number. Numbers 1 to 6 explain the mechanics of reading
pitches; 7 to 19 explain the mechanics of reading durations; and 20 to 26
explain expression and articulation markings.
Reading pitch
Table A-1 explains what the various symbols dealing with pitch mean in music
notation. Refer to Figure A-1 and this table for the meanings of the symbols.
Table A-1 refers to the symbols numbered from 1 to 6 in Figure A-1.

Staff
Composers write music on a five-line system
called a staff. In talking about the individual
lines of the staff, refer to the bottom line as the
first line. Between the five lines are four spaces.
Refer to the bottom space as the first space.
You can place noteheads on lines or in spaces.
As the noteheads get higher on the staff, they
get correspondingly higher in pitch. The dis-
tance from one line to the next higher space (or
from one space to the next higher line) is one
letter of the alphabet (for example, A to B).
2
Clef
The staff alone doesn’t tell you the pitches
(letter names) of the various lines and spaces.
But a symbol called a clef, at the left edge of
each staff, identifies a particular note on the
staff. From that note, you can determine all the
other notes by moving alphabetically up and
down the staff (line to space to line, and so on).
The clef that you use in guitar music is called
the treble clef (or G clef — see G note following).
3
G note
The clef that you use in guitar music is the
treble clef (sometimes called the G clef), which
vaguely resembles an old-fashioned letter G. It
curls around the second line of the staff and
indicates that this line is G, and any note on that
line is a G note. Some people memorize the
letter names of all the lines (E, G, B, D, F, bottom
to top) by the mnemonic “Every Good Boy Does
Fine.” For the spaces (F, A, C, E, bottom to top),
they think of the word face.

Ledger lines
If you want to write notes higher or lower than
the staff, you can “extend” the staff, above or
below, by adding very short additional staff lines
called ledger lines. The notes (letter names)
move up and down alphabetically on the ledger
lines just as they do on the normal staff lines.
5
Accidentals 
The seven notes that correspond to the first 
(sharps, flats, 
seven letters of the alphabet (sometimes called
and naturals) 
natural notes) aren’t the only notes in our musi-
cal system. Five other notes occur in between
certain of the natural notes. Picture a piano key-
board. The white keys correspond to the seven
natural notes, and the black keys are the five
extra notes. Because these “black-key” notes
don’t have names of their own, musicians refer
to them by their “white-key” names, along with
special suffixes or symbols. To refer to the black
key to the right of a white key (a half step
higher), use the term sharp. The musical symbol
for a sharp is #. So the black key to the right of
C, for example, is C-sharp (or C#). On the guitar,
you play a C# one fret higher than you play a C.
Conversely, to indicate the black key to the left
of a white key (a half step lower), you use the
term flat. The musical symbol for a flat is %. So
the black key to the left of B, for example, is B-
flat (or B%). On the guitar, you play a B% one fret
lower than B. If you sharp or flat a note, you can
undo it (that is, restore it to its natural, “white-
key” state) by canceling the sharp or flat with a
symbol known as a natural sign ($). The last note
of the first staff of Figure A-1, A-natural, shows
this kind of cancellation.

Key signature
Sometimes you play a particular pitch (or
pitches) as a sharp or flat (see the preceding
explanation of accidentals) consistently
throughout a song. Rather than indicate a flat
every time a B occurs, for example, you may
see a single flat on the B line just after the clef.
That indicates that you play every B in the song
as B%. Sharps or flats appearing that way are
known as a key signature. A key signature tells
you which notes to sharp or flat throughout a
song. If you need to restore one of the affected
notes to its natural state, a natural sign ($) in front
of the note indicates that you play the natural
note (as in the seventh note of figure A-1, where
the natural sign restores B-flat to B-natural).
Reading duration
A note’s shape helps tell how long you need to hold it. Notes can have a
hollow notehead (as in the case of the whole note and half note) or a solid
notehead (quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes), and the solid
noteheads can even have vertical lines (called stems) with flags (curly lines)
dangling off them. If you join together two or more notes, beams (horizontal
lines between the stems) replace the flags. Table A-2 refers to the symbols
numbered from 7 to 19 in Figure A-1.

Sixteenth note
The sixteenth note has a solid oval head
with a stem and either two flags or two
beams. It lasts half as long as the eighth

12
Rest
Music consists not only of notes, but of
silences, too. What makes music interesting
is how the notes and silences interact.
Silences in music are indicated by rests. The
rest in Figure A-1 is a quarter rest, equal in
duration to a quarter note. Other rests, also
equal in duration to their corresponding
notes, are the whole rest ( ; ), half rest ( ; ),
eighth rest (E) and sixteenth rest (X).
13
Tempo heading
The tempo heading tells you how fast or
slow the song’s beat, or pulse, is. As you
listen to music, you (usually) hear an imme-
diately recognizable beat. The beat is what
you tap your foot or snap your fingers to.
14
Time signature
Most songs group their beats in twos,
threes, or fours. A song’s beats may, for
example, sound out as “One-two-three-four,
one-two-three-four, one-two-three-four”
and not as “One-two-three-four-five-six-
seven-eight-nine-ten-eleven-twelve.” The
time signature looks like a fraction (but actu-
ally is two numbers sitting one above the
other, but with no dividing line), and it tells
you two things: First, the top number tells
you how many beats make up one grouping.
In “Shine On Harvest Moon,” for example,
the top number, 4, tells you that each group-
ing contains four beats. Second, the bottom
number tells you which type of note (quarter
note, half note, and so on) gets one beat. In
this case, the bottom number, 4, tells you
that the quarter note gets one beat.
Assigning the quarter note one beat is very
common and so is having four beats per
grouping. In fact, 4/4 time is sometimes
called simply common time, and you some-
times indicate it by using the letter C instead
of the numbers 4/4.

Bar line
A bar line is a vertical line drawn
through the staff after each grouping
that the time signature indicates. In
“Shine On Harvest Moon,” a bar line
appears after each four beats.
16
Double bar line
A double bar line indicates the end of 
a song.
17
Measure (bar)
The space between two consecutive
bar lines is known as a measure, or bar.
Each measure consists of the number
of beats that the time signature indi-
cates (in the case of Figure A-1, four).
Those four beats can comprise any
combination of note values that add up
to four beats. You may have four quarter
notes, or two half notes, or one whole
note, or one half note and one quarter
and two eighth notes — or any other
combination. You can even use rests
(silences) as long as everything adds up
to four. Check out each measure of
“Shine On Harvest Moon” to see vari-
ous combinations.
18
Tie
A short curved line that connects two
notes of the same pitch is known as a
tie. A tie tells you to not strike the
second of the two notes, but to leave
the first note sustaining for the com-
bined time value of both notes.
19
Augmentation dot 
A dot appearing after a note increases 
(also called a dot)
that note’s time value by half. If a half
note is equal to two beats, for example,
a dotted half note is equal to three —
two plus half of two, or two plus one, 
or three.

Expression, articulation, and miscellaneous
terms and symbols
Expression and articulation deal with how you play the music. Table A-3, in
conjunction with Figure A-1, tells you about the symbols and terms that deal
with these issues. Table A-3 deals with the symbols numbered 20 to 26 in
Figure A-1.

Dynamic marking
A dynamic marking tells you how loud or soft
to play. These markings are usually abbrevi-
ations of Italian words. Some of the common
markings, from soft to loud, are pp (pianis-
simo), very soft; p (piano), soft; mp (mezzo-
piano), moderately soft; mf (mezzo-forte),
moderately loud; f (forte), loud; and ff (fortis-
simo), very loud.
21
Crescendo and 
The wedge-shaped symbol is known as a 
Ritardando
crescendo and indicates that the music gets
gradually louder. If the wedge-shaped symbol
goes from open to closed, it indicates a
decrescendo, or a gradual softening. Often,
instead of wedges (or, as some musicians
call them, “hairpins”), the abbreviation cresc.
or decresc. appears. Another term you can
use to indicate a softening of volume is
diminuendo, abbreviated dim. The abbrevia-
tion rit. (sometimes abbreviated ritard.)
stands for ritardando and indicates a grad-
ual slowing of the tempo. Rallentando
(abbreviated rall.) means the same thing. 
A gradual increase in tempo you can indi-
cate by using accel., which stands for
accelerando.
22
Slur
A slur is a curved line that connects two
notes of different pitch. A slur tells you to
connect the notes smoothly, with no break in
the sound.
23
Staccato dot
Staccato dots above or below notes tell you
to play the notes short and detached.

Accent
An accent mark above or below a note tells
you to stress it, or play it louder than normal.
25
Repeat sign
The repeat sign tells you to repeat certain
measures. The symbol C brackets the
repeated section at the beginning (in this
case, measure 1), and B brackets it at the
end (refer to measure 8 of “Shine On
Harvest Moon”).
26
Ending brackets
Sometimes a repeated section starts the
same both times but ends differently. These
different endings you indicate by using num-
bered ending brackets. Play the measures
under the first ending bracket the first time,
but substitute the measures under the
second ending bracket the second time.
Taking “Shine On Harvest Moon” as an
example, you first play measures 1–8; you
then play measures 1–5 again, and then 9–11.
Finding Notes on the Guitar
Figures A-2 through A-7 show you how to find the notes in standard notation
on each of the six strings of the guitar. By the way, the actual sounding pitch
of the guitar is an octave (12 half steps) lower than the written pitch is. Note:
You sometimes see two notes (for example, F#/G%) at the same fret. These
notes (known as enharmonic equivalents) have the same pitch.

Appendix C
How to Use the CD
E
very music example in Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is performed on
the CD that comes with this book — over 160 examples! This makes
Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, a true multimedia experience. You have text
explaining the techniques used, visual graphics of the music in two forms —
guitar tablature and standard music notation — and audio performances of
the music (playable on your CD or MP3 player), complete with the appropri-
ate tonal treatment (distortion for rock, sparkly acoustic colors for folk, and
so on) and the appropriate accompaniment settings.
One fun way to experience Guitar For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is to just scan
the text by music examples, looking at the printed music in the book and lis-
tening to the corresponding performances on the CD. When you hear some-
thing you like, read the text that goes into detail about that particular piece
of music. Or go to a particular chapter that interests you (say, Chapter 10 on
rock guitar playing), skip to the appropriate tracks on the CD, and see if you
can hack it. A little above your head at this point? Better go back to Chapter 8
on barre chords!
Relating the Text to the CD
Whenever you see written music in the text and you want to hear what it
sounds like on the CD, refer to the box in the upper-right-hand corner, which
tells you the track number and start time (in minutes and seconds).
Use the track skip control on your CD or MP3 player’s front panel or remote to
go to the desired track number and then use the cue button of the cue/review
function (also known as the “fast forward/rewind” control) to go to the spe-
cific time, indicated in minutes and seconds, within that track. When you get
on or near the start time, release the cue button and the example plays.
If you want to play along with the CD, “cue up” to a spot a few seconds before
the start time. Giving yourself a few seconds head start allows you to put
down the remote and place your hands in a ready position on the guitar.

Count-offs
Many of the music examples are preceded by a count-off, which is a metronome
clicking in rhythm before the music begins. This tells you what the tempo is, or
the speed at which the music is played. It’s like having your own conductor
going, “A-one, and a-two . . .” so that you can hit the downbeat (first note of
music) in time with the CD. Examples in 4/4 time have four beats “in front”
(musician lingo for a four-beat count-off before the music begins), examples in
3/4 have three beats in front.
Stereo separation
We’ve recorded some of the examples in what’s known as a stereo split. In cer-
tain pieces, the backing, or accompanying, music appears on the left channel
of your stereo, while the featured guitar appears on the right. If you leave
your stereo’s balance control in its normal position (straight up, or 12:00),
you’ll hear both the rhythm tracks and the featured guitar equally — one
from each speaker. By selectively adjusting the balance control (turning the
knob to the left or right) you can gradually or drastically reduce the volume
of one or the other.
Why would you want to do this? If you have practiced the lead part to a cer-
tain example and feel you’ve got it down good enough to where you want to
try it “along with the band,” take the balance knob and turn it all the way to
the left. Now only the sound from the left speaker comes out, which is the
backing tracks. The count-off clicks are in both channels, so you’ll always
receive your cue to play in time with the music. You can reverse the process
and listen to just the lead part, too, which means you play the chords against
the recorded lead part. Good, well-rounded guitarists work on both their
rhythm and their lead playing.
Always keep the CD with the book, rather than mixed in with your rack of
CDs. The plastic envelope helps protect the CD’s surface from scuffs and
scratches, and whenever you want to refer to Guitar For Dummies, 2nd
Edition (the book), the CD will always be right where you expect it. Try to get
in the habit of following along with the printed music whenever you listen to
the CD, even if your sight-reading skills aren’t quite up to snuff. You absorb
more than you expect just by moving your eyes across the page in time to the
music, associating sound and sight. So store the CD and book together as
constant companions and use them together as well for a rich visual and
aural experience.

Part VII: Appendixes 

System Requirements
Audio CD players
The CD included with this book will work just fine in any standard CD player.
Just put it into your home stereo system, and check out “CD audio tracks,”
later in the chapter, for the track descriptions.
Computer CD-ROM drives
If you have a computer, you can pop the accompanying CD into your CD-ROM
drive to access the MP3 files that we’ve included. Make sure that your com-
puter meets the minimum system requirements shown here.
 A computer running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS
 Software capable of playing MP3s and CD Audio
 A CD-ROM drive
 A sound card for PCs (Mac OS computers have built-in sound support)
Using the CD with Microsoft Windows
To install the items from the CD to your hard drive, follow these steps:
1. Insert the CD into your computer’s CD-ROM drive.
2. The CD-ROM interface will appear. The interface provides a simple
point-and-click way to explore the contents of the CD.
If you do not have autorun enabled, or if the CD-ROM interface does not
appear, follow these steps to access the CD:
1. Click Start _ Run.
2. In the dialog box that appears, type d:\start.exe, where d is the letter
of your CD-ROM drive. This brings up the autorun window described in
the preceding set of steps.
357
Appendix C: How to Use the CD

Using the CD with Mac OS
To install the items from the CD to your hard drive, follow these steps:
1. Insert the CD into your computer’s CD-ROM drive.
In a moment, two icons representing the CD you just inserted appear on
your Mac desktop. Chances are good that both icons look like a
CD-ROM. In addition, the Audio portion of the CD may automatically
begin playing, depending on how you have your Mac set up.
2. Double-click the CD icon labeled “Guitar FD” to show the CD-ROM’s
extra content.
If you want to use your Mac’s CD player to merely play the audio on the
CD, you can either let it play automatically, or you can double-click on
the icon labeled “Audio CD” to view the individual tracks. Double-click
on a track to play it.
3. Double-click the License Agreement icon, then double-click the Read
Me First icon.
This is the license that you are agreeing to by using the CD. You can
close this window once you’ve looked over the agreement. The Read Me
First text file contains information about the CD’s programs and any last-
minute instructions you may need in order to correctly install them.
4. To install files from the CD onto your computer, just drag each file
from the CD window and drop it on your hard drive icon.
What You’ll Find on the CD
CD audio tracks
Here is a list of the tracks on the CD along with the figure numbers that they
correspond to in the book. Use this as a quick cross-reference to finding more
about interesting-sounding tracks on the CD. The first number equates to the
chapter in which we explain how to play the track. Then just flip through the
captions and songs in order until you find the track you’re interested in play-
ing. To ease matters a bit, the exercises also contain the track numbers (and
times, if appropriate) to help you find just the track you need.
