Preface
This book describes the fundamental grammar and structure of modern
literary Arabic. It is complete with exercises and offers a strong founda-
tion for reading and writing the Arabic of newspapers, books, broad-
casts and formal speech, as well as providing the student with a course
for self-study. The exercises and examples contain modern vocabulary
and expressions taken from everyday use.
The work contains thirty-nine chapters with an appendix of tables for
verb forms and verb conjugation paradigms. All chapters are progres-
sive and they complement each other. For this reason it is recommended
that the student master each lesson before going on to the next.
Up to chapter 22, a full transliteration into the Latin alphabet is given
for all Arabic examples and exercises. From chapter 22 onwards, the
transliteration is omitted from the exercises only.
There are two types of exercise: Arabic sentences translated into
English, and English sentences to be translated into Arabic. The words
of the English to Arabic translation exercises are taken from the Arabic
to English exercises of the same chapter.
So that readers do not have to use Arabic–English dictionaries, which a
learner of Arabic would ﬁnd difﬁcult at this stage, most Arabic words
in the exercises are indexed with a superscript number and the same
number is given to the equivalent English word.
I am conﬁdent that this book will prove to be of great help to those who
have begun or will begin the study of Arabic, and that teachers will ﬁnd
it a useful aid.

Chapter 1
Arabic script, transliteration
and alphabet table
1.1
The Arabic script
The Arabic alphabet consists of 28 letters representing consonants. In
addition there are three vowel signs which are used in writing both short
and long vowels. Moreover, there are various other orthographic signs
that are explained in the following chapters.
The 28 letters are written from right to left. When writing words, the
letters are connected (joined) together from both sides, except in
the case of six letters, which can only be joined from the right side.
These letters are numbered 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 27 in the table below
and are marked with an asterisk (*). It is important to remember that
these letters cannot be connected to the following letter (i.e. on their left
side).
Most of the letters are written in slightly different forms depending on
their location in the word: initially, medially, ﬁnally or standing alone.
There are no capital letters.
Arabic grammarians use three different names for the alphabet:
َأ ْﻟـ ُﺤ ُﺮو ُف  ْ َﻷ ْﺑ َﺠ ِﺪ َّﻳ ُﺔ
al-h˙uru¯fu l-abg˘adiyyatu
َأ ْﻟـ ُﺤ ُﺮو ُف  ْﻟ ِﻬ َﺠﺎ ِﺋ َّﻴ ُﺔ
al-h˙uru¯fu l-hig˘a¯iyyatu
َأ ْ َﻷ ِﻟ ْﻔـ َﺒﺎ ُء
al-alifba¯u

1.2
Transliteration
The transliteration of the Arabic alphabet given below is based on the
Latin alphabet, but some of the letters have an extra sign indicating
some special feature of the Arabic pronunciation of the letter in
question.
The alif ( ,)اwhich is the ﬁrst letter, has so far not been given any
transliteration, because its sound value varies (to be dealt with in
chapters 6 and 7).

Chapter 2
Pronunciation of consonants
(1) Alif اThis ﬁrst letter has no pronunciation of its own. One of
its main functions is to act as a bearer for the sign hamzah,
discussed separately in chapter 7. Alif is also used as a long vowel
/a¯/ (see chapter 6).
(2) Ba¯ / بb/
A voiced bilabial stop as the /b/ in English ‘habit’.
(3) Ta¯ / تt/
An unaspirated voiceless dental stop as the t in English
‘stop’. Never pronounced as American English tt as in ‘letter’.
(4) T¯ a¯ / ثt¯/
A voiceless interdental fricative as th in English ‘thick’,
‘tooth’.
(5) G˘ ı¯m / جg˘/
A voiced palato-alveolar affricate. In reality, this let-
ter has three different pronunciations depending on the dialectal
background of the speaker:
(a)
In Classical Arabic and the Gulf area, as well as in many
other places in the Arab world, it is pronounced as a voiced
palato-alveolar affricate as the j in ‘judge’, ‘journey’, or the g
in Italian ‘giorno’.
(b)
In Lower Egypt (Cairo, Alexandria) it is pronounced as a
voiced velar stop as the g in English ‘great’.
(c)
In North Africa and the Levant it is pronounced as a voiced
palato-alveolar fricative /zˇ/ as the s in English ‘pleasure’, and
as j in French ‘jour’.
(6) H˙ a¯ /حh˙ /
This consonant has no equivalent in European
languages. It is pronounced in the pharynx by breathing with
strong friction and no uvular vibration or scrape, so that it sounds

like a loud whispering from the throat. It must be kept distinct
from the sounds of / خh˘/ (7) and ../ ﻫـh/ (26).
(7) H˘ a¯ / خh˘/
This consonant occurs in many languages. It is a
voiceless postvelar (before or after /i/) or uvular (before or after /a/
or /u/) fricative, quite similar to the so-called ach-Laut in German
‘Nacht’ or Scottish ‘loch’ or the Spanish j in ‘mujer’, but in Arabic
it has a stronger, rasping sound.
(8) Da¯l / دd/
A voiced dental stop as the d in English ‘leader’.
(9) D¯¯ a¯l / ذd¯/
A voiced interdental fricative, as the th in English
‘either’.
(10) Ra¯ / رr/
A voiced alveolar trill, which differs from English r in
that it is a rolled sound or trill, pronounced as a rapid succession
of ﬂaps of the tongue, similar to Scottish r in ‘radical’ or Italian r
in ‘parlare’ or Spanish rr in ‘perro’.
(11) Zayn / زz/
A voiced alveolar sibilant, as the z in English ‘gazelle’.
(12) Sı¯n / سs/
A voiceless alveolar sibilant as the s in English ‘state’.
(13) Sˇı¯n / شsˇ/
A voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant as the sh in
English ‘shave’, ‘push’.
(14) S˙a¯d / صs˙/
Belongs to the group of emphatic consonants. The
emphatic consonants are pronounced with more emphasis and
further back in the mouth than their non-emphatic (plain)
counterparts. In pronouncing them the body and root of the
tongue are (simultaneously) drawn back towards the rear wall
of the throat (pharynx), and also the tip of the tongue is slightly
retracted. Hence the emphatic consonants are also called
pharyngealized consonants. / صs˙/ is thus the emphatic or
pharyngealized counterpart of the plain alveolar / سs/ (12) and
sounds somewhat similar to the s in English ‘son’ or ‘assumption’.
For the retracting and lowering effect of the emphatic consonants
on the adjacent vowels, see chapter 4.
(15) D˙ a¯d / ضd˙ /
It is also an emphatic consonant, classiﬁed as a
pharyngealized voiced alveolar stop. Arab phoneticians and
reciters of the Quran recommend it is pronounced as a counter-
6
Pronuncia-
tion of
consonants

part to / دd/ (8). In current use in many dialects it is, however, also
pronounced as the counterpart of / ذd¯/ (9), somewhat similar to
the sound th in English ‘thus’. See also chapter 4.
(16) T˙ a¯ / طt˙/
An emphatic consonant, classiﬁed as a pharyngealized
voiceless alveolar stop. It is the counterpart of / تt/ (3), and simi-
lar to the sound /t/ at the beginning of the English word ‘tall’. See
also chapter 4.
(17) D
˙¯ a¯  / ظd¯˙
/
An emphatic consonant, classiﬁed as a pharyngealized
voiced interdental fricative. It is the emphatic counterpart of ذ
/d¯/ (9). In some dialects it is pronounced as / ضd˙ / (15). In some
other dialects it is pronounced as pharyngealized / زz/ (11). See
also chapter 4.
(18) Ayn // عThis consonant has no equivalent in European
languages. It is deﬁned as a voiced emphatic (pharyngealized)
laryngeal fricative, which is pronounced by pressing the root of
the tongue against the back wall of the pharynx (upper part of the
throat) and letting the pressed air stream from the throat pass
through the pharynx with some vibration. In a way it is the voiced
counterpart of / حh˙ / (6). It sounds as if you are swallowing your
tongue or being strangled.
(19) G˙ ayn / غg˙/
A voiced postvelar (before or after /i/) or uvular
(before or after /a/ or /u/) fricative, a gargling sound, produced
by pronouncing the / خh˘/ (7) and activating the vocal folds,
similar to Parisian French r in ‘Paris’ and ‘rouge’ but with more
scraping.
(20) Fa¯ / فf/
A voiceless labiodental fricative as the f in English
‘fast’.
(21) Qa¯f / قq/
This has no equivalent in European languages. It is a
voiceless postvelar or uvular stop, pronounced by closing the back
of the tongue against the uvula as if it were to be swallowed. It is
like / خh˘/ (7) without vibration. This sound should not be con-
fused with / كk/ (22), e.g.   َﻗ ْﻠﺐqalb, ‘heart’, but   َﻛ ْﻠﺐkalb ‘dog’.
(22) Ka¯f / كk/
An unaspirated voiceless velar stop as the k of English
‘skate’.

Pronuncia-
tion of
consonants

(23) La¯m / لl/
A voiced alveolar lateral as the l in English ‘let’.
(24) Mı¯m / مm/
A voiced bilabial nasal as the m in English ‘moon’.
(25) Nu¯n / نn/
A voiced alveolar nasal as the n in English ‘nine’.
(26) Ha¯ / )ه( ﻫـh/
A voiceless glottal fricative as the h in English
‘head’.
Note: This letter has another function when it occurs at the end of a word with
two superscript dots:  ...ـﺔ v ةThen it is pronounced exactly like / تt/ (3) and is
called ta¯ marbu¯t˙ah (see chapter 10 on gender).
(27) Wa¯w / وw/
A voiced bilabial semivowel, as the w in English
‘well’.
(28) Ya¯ / يy/
A voiced alveo-palatal semivowel, as the y in English
‘yes’.

Chapter 3
Punctuation and handwriting
3.1
Punctuation
Punctuation marks are not found in early Arabic manuscripts. The
Arabs have borrowed modern European punctuation marks with some
modiﬁcations in order to distinguish them from Arabic letters, as
follows:
.

:

!؟
) (″
〈〈
〉〉
3.2
Arabic handwriting
It is recommended that handwriting technique is practised from the very
beginning, otherwise it may become difﬁcult to learn not only to write
but even to read handwritten texts. Arabs consider good handwriting a
sign of erudition.
Printed and handwritten Arabic texts do not differ from each other as
much as they do in European languages.
Arabic handwriting follows certain rules. The straight horizontal direc-
tion used in writing English must be modiﬁed in Arabic handwriting,
since some of the letters change their form according to the preceding or
following letter.
3.3
Some remarks concerning the dots with certain consonants
The most common way of marking the dots which belong to certain
consonants in handwriting is to use a straight stroke  instead of two

dots, as in 
 /t/ or 
 /y/; and  instead of three dots, as in 
 /t¯/.
One might suspect that the straight stroke replacing two dots could be
confused with the vowels fath˙ ah  ـــ َـــor kasrah  , ــ ِـــbut this is not the
case, since these vowel signs are diagonal (slanting) strokes. As noted
above, handwritten as well as printed texts are normally written with-
out vowel signs.
Exercises
The examples below and in the next few chapters are intended mainly for
practising how to read and write Arabic script.

Chapter 4
Vowels
4.1
There are three vowels in Arabic called   َأ ْﻟـ َﺤ َﺮ َﻛﺎ ُتal-
h˙ araka¯tu. They can be both short and long (see chapter 6).
4.2
Short vowels
The three short vowels are written as diacritical signs above or below
the consonant to which they belong. As a word always begins with a
consonant, the consonant is pronounced before the vowel.
Fath˙ah:/ ــ َــa/ is a small diagonal stroke above the consonant:
بَ
/ba/, e.g.َﻛـ َﺘـ َﺐkataba, to write.
Kasrah:/ ـ ِـــi/ is a small diagonal stroke under the consonant:
بِ
/bi/, e.g.َﻗـ ِﺒـ َﻞqabila, to accept.
D˙ ammah:/ ـ ُـــu/ is a sign similar to a comma above the consonant:
بُ
/bu/, e.g.ﺣ َـ ُﺴـ َﻦh˙asuna, to be handsome.
4.3
The sound quality of fath˙ ah / ــ َــa/ tends to be slightly
coloured towards /æ/, like /a/ in the word ‘fat’ in English.
4.4
Short vowels are not normally marked in personal handwriting
or in most Arabic publications. In order to avoid misunderstandings, the
vowel signs are marked on unusual or foreign words, and in the Quran
and children’s books.
4.5
The vowel qualities of the three vowels mentioned above are
inﬂuenced by the emphatic (pharyngealized) consonants. The emphatic

consonants are most easily heard in conjuction with fath˙ ah / ــ َــa/,
which is then coloured towards /o/, or to American English /u/ in ‘but’
or /o/ in ‘bottle’, ‘hot’, etc.
Example: The non-emphatic /s/ in the word َﺳـ َﻠ َﺐ
 salaba ‘to steal’
sounds like sælæbæ, but the emphatic /s˙/ in the word َﺻ َﻠ َﺐ
 s˙alaba ‘to
crucify’ sounds almost like s˙olobo.
Note a: The following two consonants may sometimes also function as
emphatic: / رr/ (10), and / لl/ (23) only with the word ّﻠ ُﻪ
ا
  َأﻟalla¯h, ‘God’.
Note b: The uvular / قq/ has almost the same effect on the adjacent vowels as
the emphatic consonants. Thus the word   َﻛ ْﻠﺐkalb, ‘dog’, with a velar /k/,
sounds almost like kælb, whereas   َﻗ ْﻠﺐqalb ‘heart’, with an uvular / قq/,
sounds almost like qolb.
Note c: Phonologically the above sounds /æ/ and /o/ both represent the fath˙ ah
 .ـ َـــHowever, in the transliteration system used in this book they are replaced
by /a/. This is because they function as /a/ phonemically.

Suku¯n, sˇaddah, noun cases
and nunation as indeﬁnite
form
5.1
Suku¯n: ــ ْـــ
A small circle written above a consonant indicates the absence of a
vowel, e.g.
5.2
Sˇaddah: ( ــ ّــــdoubling of a consonant)
(a)
When a consonant occurs twice without a vowel in between, the
consonant is written only once but with the sign sˇaddah above and
the pronunciation is also doubled, e.g.
(b)
When kasrah / ــ ِـــi/ appears together with sˇaddah  , ـــ ّـــthe
kasrah is usually placed above the consonant but under the
sˇaddah, e.g.
5.3
Noun cases
Case inﬂection is called   ِإ ْﻋـ َﺮا ُب  ِْﻻ ْﺳ ِﻢira¯bu l-ismi in Arabic.
Arabic nouns and adjectives have three cases. For the most part they
  ُﻫ ْﻢhum, they  ِﻣ ْﻦmin, from  َﺗ ْﺤ َﺖtah˙ta, under
  َﻟ ْﻮlaw, if  َﻛ ْﻲkay, in order to  َﻛ ْﻴ َﻒkayfa, how

are indicated by adding a vowel to the last consonant, and they are
called:
(There is more about cases in later chapters.)
5.4
Nunation as indeﬁnite form
Nouns and adjectives are generally indicated as indeﬁnite forms,
  َأﻟ َّﻨ ِﻜ َﺮ ُةan-nakiratu, by doubling the ﬁnal vowel sign and pro-
nouncing them with a ﬁnal /...n/. The ﬁnal vowel itself does not,
however, become long in spite of the double vowel sign. This process
of making a noun or adjective indeﬁnite is called   َﺗ ْﻨ ِﻮﻳ ٌﻦtanwı¯nun
in Arabic and nunation in English. The indeﬁnite forms of the three
different cases are:
Nominative indef.: The word ends with a double d˙ammah:
ـ ُــ ُــor.../ ــ ٌـــun/   َﻣ ِﻠ ٌﻚmalikun, a king   
Accusative indef.: The word ends with a double fath˙ah and often an extra
alif  اwhich is not pronounced as a long vowel a¯:
.../ ـ ًـﺎan/   َﻣ ِﻠ ًﻜﺎmalikan, a king (object)
Genitive indef.: The word ends with a double kasrah:
.../ ــ ٍــــin/   َﻣ ِﻠـ ٍﻚmalikin, a king’s, of a king
Note a: The form of the double d˙ ammah  ــ ٌـــis the commonest of the two
alternatives and will be used in this book.
Note b: In spoken Arabic the use of nunation, i.e. /...un/, /...an/ and /...in/ in
nouns, is rare.

Chapter 6
Long vowels, alif maqs˙u¯rah,
dagger or miniature alif,
word stress and syllable
structure 
6.1
The three short vowels, / ــ َـــa/, / ــ ُـــu/, and / ــ ِـــi/, also have
long variants. They are written by adding one of the following three
letters after the short vowel signs. These letters are called in Arabic
  ُﺣ ُﺮو ُف ا ْﻟـ َﻤ َّدh˙ uru¯ fu l-maddi ‘letters of prolongation’:
Note: In some books long vowels are transliterated as double vowels. Here we
use the macron above the vowel to indicate length.
6.2
It should be noted that the combination of the letter la¯m ...ﻟـ
followed by alif  ...ـﺎis called la¯m-alif and written as   َﻻor / ....ـ َﻼla¯/
(not as  .) َﻟـﺎAlso, the la¯m-alif   َﻻfollows the rule of alif (1)  ,...ـﺎwhich
means that it cannot be connected to the following letter (to the left),
e.g.
alif ,اwhich is related to fath˙ah/ ــ َــــa/
wa¯w ,وwhich is related to d˙ammah/ ــ ُــــu/
ya¯ ,يwhich is related to kasrah/ ــ ِــــi/

6.3
Alif maqs˙u¯rah
The long vowel /a¯/ at the end of a word can be written with alif  ...ـَﺎor,
in some words, with ya¯, but without dots  ... َـﻰThat ya¯ is then called
ُﺼﻮ َر ٌة
  َأ ِﻟ ٌﻒ  َﻣ ْﻘalif maqs˙u¯ rah, e.g.
Note: Certain rules explained in later chapters govern which one of the two
alifs is to be used in a word.
6.4
Dagger or miniature alif
In some common words the long vowel /a¯/ is written with a miniature
alif, also called dagger alif. As the name suggests, this is a small vertical
stroke  ــاــplaced above the consonant, replacing the ordinary full alif
( ,)اe.g.
6.5
Word stress and syllable structure
Surprisingly enough, the Arabic grammarians did not deal with the
position of stress (dynamic accent) in Arabic words. Nevertheless
almost all Arabic words must be stressed on one of their syllables, which
may be short or long. The stress appears as an increase in vocal intensity
as well as a raising of the pitch of voice.
The following general rules are mainly based on the methods of pro-
nunciation employed by the reciters of the Quran. In some cases there
are variations between different traditions, and the native dialect of the
speaker may also inﬂuence the pronunciation.
Syllables are divided into short and long. A short syllable consists of a
consonant plus a short vowel (CV), whereas a long syllable consists of:
(1) a consonant plus a long vowel (CV¯ ), (2) a consonant plus a short
vowel plus a consonant (CVC), or (3) a consonant plus a long vowel

plus a consonant (CV¯ C). No syllable can start with more than one
consonant.
1a)
The stress falls on the ﬁrst long syllable counting from the end of
the word. However, the ﬁnal syllable cannot itself carry the stress,
except when the word has only one syllable, e.g. yak-tu-bu¯-na,
qal-bun, uq-tu-lu¯ , ka-tab-tum, ka-tab-tun-na, mam-la-ka-tun,
d¯ u¯. (The hyphens here indicate syllable not morpheme junctures.)
1b)
Another tradition holds that if the ﬁrst long syllable is the fourth
syllable counting from the end or any syllable before that syllable,
then the third syllable counting from the end receives the stress,
e.g. mam-la-ka-tun.
2)
If there is no long syllable or if only the last syllable is long, the
ﬁrst syllable receives the stress, e.g. ka-ta-ba, qa-ta-lu¯ , sa-ma-ka-
tun, sa-ma-ka-tu-hu-ma¯. According to another tradition, in these
cases the stress cannot be retracted to an earlier position than the
third syllable counting from the end. E.g. sa-ma-ka-tun, sa-ma-ka-
tu-hu-ma¯.
3)
The stress cannot normally fall on the deﬁnite article al- or a
preﬁxed preposition or conjunction, e.g. al-ya-du, ka-d¯ a¯, wa-ra-
mat.
Note: The ﬁnal short vowel or ﬁnal syllable of certain word endings to be dealt
with later tend to be left out in pronunciation, especially in pausa (at the end
of a sentence). Yet the given stress rules still apply in most cases, if you bear in
mind that the ﬁnal vowel or syllable has been lost. E.g. maf-hu¯m(-un), mad-ra-
sa(-tun), sa-ma-ka(-tun), lub-na¯-nı¯ (lub-na¯-niy-yun).

Chapter 7
Hamzah (hamzatu l-qat˙
i)
and the maddah sign
7.1
 Hamzah or hamzatu l-qat˙
i,  , َﻫ ْﻤ َﺰ ُة  ْﻟ َﻘ ْﻄ ِﻊmeans the cutting
or disjunctive hamzah. Hamzah is considered to represent the ﬁrst letter
of the alphabet and it has a full consonantal value like other consonants.
(Arabic grammarians refer to alif as the alif hamzah.)
The sign of hamzah was added to the Arabic script at a rather late stage.
Therefore hamzah does not have a real independent form comparable to
the other consonant letters. Hamzah is written with the special sign ,ء
which is transliterated as //.
7.2
 The sound of hamzah exists in European languages in speech but
is not represented in writing. In Arabic it is both heard and written.
Phonetically it is a glottal stop, pronounced as a catch in the throat by
holding one’s breath and suddenly releasing it. This sound occurs as
follows in some other languages:
In Cockney English ‘little bottle’ is pronounced as /lil bol/, i.e. with two
glottal stops.
In German, beobachten ‘to consider’, is pronounced as /beobachten/.
Vereisen, ‘to freeze, be frozen’, is pronounced as /feraizen/, but the word
verreisen, meaning ‘to travel away’ has no glottal stop. Iss auch ein Ei!
‘Eat also an egg!’, is pronounced as /iss auch ain Ai!/.
Note: Hamzah  // ءshould not be confused with the completely different letter
ayn  // عin either pronunciation or transliteration.

7.3
 Hamzah is used frequently, but the rules for writing it are quite
complicated and are therefore dealt with in more detail in chapter 20.
7.4
 Since hamzah does not have a regular independent form, it is
mainly written on the letters  ؤ ,أand ( ئwithout dots), and these three
letters are called seats or chairs for the hamzah.
7.5
Some basic rules for writing hamzah
The initial glottal stop hamzah // is written above or below the letter
alif  اand is pronounced before the vowel, according to the following
rules.
(a)
Hamzah together with fath˙ah are written above the alif: /  َأa/,
e.g.
(b)
Hamzah together with d˙ammah are written above the alif: /  ُأ
u/, e.g.
(c)
Hamzah together with kasrah are both written under the alif: إِ
/i/, e.g.
(d)
Hamzah on alif in the middle of the word, e.g.
(e)
Hamzah on alif at the end of the word, e.g.

7.6
The maddah sign
The maddah sign   َﻣ َّﺪ ٌةis a long slanting or curved superscript line
representing the alif, which is written above another alif to signify the
lengthening of /a/ as /a¯/. It is used when an alif which has hamzah and
fath˙ ah ( ) َأis followed by another alif ( .) َأاThe alif, hamzah and fath˙ ah
are all omitted, and only one alif is written with the sign maddah above
it as (  اfor:  ,) َأاwhich is pronounced as /a¯/. This is to avoid having to
write the alif twice, e.g.
When an alif having hamzah and fath˙ ah   َأis followed by another alif
with hamzah and suku¯n ( ,) ْأonly one alif is written with maddah above
it (  اfor:  ,) َأ ْأwhich is also pronounced /a¯/. In this way one avoids
having to write two glottal stops in one syllable, e.g.

Chapter 8
Deﬁnite article ...  َأ ْﻟـal...,
nominal sentences, verbal
sentences, word order and
adjectives
8.1
The deﬁnite article ...  َأ ْﻟـal... is the only deﬁnite article in Arabic.
It is used for all noun cases, genders and numbers by attaching it to the
beginning of a noun or adjective. There is no indeﬁnite article, but only
an indeﬁnite form, which has already been covered in chapter 5.
Note: Concerning writing hamzah over the alif ( )أin the deﬁnite article, see the
ﬁnal note in chapter 9.
8.2
When the indeﬁnite form becomes deﬁnite, it loses its nunation
/...n/, and only one vowel is written on or under the ﬁnal consonant, e.g.
8.3
The basic functions of the three noun cases are as follows:
•
The nominative case is used for the subject and predicate noun or
adjective.
•
The accusative case is used for the direct object, predicative
complement in verbal sentences, and for most adverbs.
Indeﬁnite
Deﬁnite
Nominative:َﺑ ْﻴ ٌﺖ
َأ ْﻟ َﺒ ْﻴـ ُﺖ
baytun, a house
al-baytu, the house
Accusative:َﺑ ْﻴ ًﺘﺎ
َأ ْﻟ َﺒ ْﻴـ َﺖ
baytan, a house
al-bayta, the house
Genitive:َﺑ ْﻴ ٍﺖ
َأ ْﻟ َﺒ ْﻴـ ِﺖ
baytin, of a house
al-bayti, of the house

•
The genitive case is used for expressing possession (explained in
chapter 12) and after prepositions.
Note: Often the case endings are not pronounced, except for the indeﬁnite
accusative ending -an in adverbs, e.g. ُﺷ ْﻜ ًﺮا
 sˇukran ‘thank you!’.
8.4
The deﬁnite article ...  َأ ْﻟـal... is used more frequently in Arabic
than in English. One of the reasons for this is that nouns referring to
abstract things, whole collectives and generic terms, generally take the
deﬁnite article, e.g.
  َأ ْﻟ ِﻌ ْﻠ ُﻢal-ilmu, science
  َأ ْﻟ ِﻜ َﻼ ُب  َﺣ َﻴ َﻮا َﻧﺎ ٌتal-kila¯bu h˙ayawa¯na¯tun. Dogs are animals.
8.5
Nominal and verbal sentences
There are two types of Arabic sentence: nominal sentences ُﺟ ْﻤ َﻠ ٌﺔ  ْﺳ ِﻤ َّﻴ ٌﺔ
g˘umlatun ismiyyatun, and verbal sentences    ُﺟ ْﻤ َﻠ ٌﺔ  ِﻓ ْﻌ ِﻠ َّﻴ ٌﺔg˘umlatun
ﬁliyyatun.
8.6
A nominal sentence does not contain a verb and consists of two
components: subject and predicate. The subject is usually a noun
(phrase) or pronoun in the nominative case. The predicate may be a
noun (phrase), pronoun, an indeﬁnite adjective, or an adverb of place or
time. A nominal sentence refers to the present tense and does not require
the copula to be, e.g.
ﺾٌ
  َأ ْﻟـ ِﻘ ُّﻂ  َﻣ ِﺮﻳal-qit˙t˙u marı-d˙un. The cat (is) ill.
  َأ َﻧﺎ  َﻃﺎ ِﻟ ٌﺐana¯ t˙a¯libun. I (am) a student.
  َأ ْﻟ َﻮ َﻟ ُﺪ  ُﻫ َﻨﺎ َكal-waladu huna¯ka. The boy (is) there.
  ُﻫ ْﻢ  ُﻋ َّﻤﺎ ٌلhum umma¯lun. They (are) workers.

8.7
Verbal sentence and word order
A verbal sentence contains a verb, and has the following basic word
order:
verb + subject + object or complement
The subject is normally in the nominative case. The direct object, which
may occur only with transitive verbs, is in the accusative case.
  َﺧ َﺮ َج  َﻃـﺎ ِﻟـ ٌﺐh˘arag˘a (verb) t˙a¯libun (subject).
A student went out.
  َأ َﻛ َﻞ  َﻛ ْﻠ ٌﺐ  ُﺧ ْﺒ ًﺰاakala (verb) kalbun (subject) h˘ubzan (object).
A dog ate bread.
Remember: If the subject or object is a personal pronoun, it is usually
left out, because the verb is conjugated for the person, gender and
number of the subject and pronominal object (see chapter 15).
8.8
Adjectives
An adjective normally follows the noun it qualiﬁes and agrees with it in
gender, number and case, except when the noun refers to non-humans,
i.e. animals and things.
When the adjective functions as predicate in a nominal sentence
(predicative construction), it is always indeﬁnite, even when the subject
is deﬁnite:
  َأ ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﺘ َﺤ ُﻒ  َﺟ ِﻤﻴ ٌﻞal-math˙afu g˘amı-lun. The museum (is) beautiful/nice.
  َأ ْﻟ َﺒ ْﻴ ُﺖ  َوا ِﺳ ٌﻊal-baytu wa¯siun. The house (is) large.
When the adjective functions as a modiﬁer of a noun (attributive
construction), it also agrees with the head noun in terms of deﬁniteness.
In other words, if the head noun is deﬁnite, the adjective also takes the
deﬁnite article, whereas if the head noun is indeﬁnite, the adjective is
also indeﬁnite.

  َأ ْﻟ َﺒ ْﻴـ ُﺖ  ْﻟ َﻮا ِﺳ ُﻊal-baytu l-wa¯siu, the large house
  َﺑ ْﻴ ٌﺖ  َوا ِﺳ ٌﻊbaytun wa¯siun, a large house OR A house is large.
Note a: The alif  اof the deﬁnite article in  ... ... ْﻟ َﻮا ِﺳ ُﻊl-wa¯siu in the ﬁrst of
the two sentences above is elided in pronunciation after a vowel (discussed in
chapter 9 dealing with was˙lah).
Note b: There is no formal difference between the predicative and attributive
construction of an adjective when the head noun is indeﬁnite (compare the
translations of the second sentence in the above pair).
Note c: Again, when the combination of the letter .../ ﻟـl/ followed by alif ا
is written as  ,ﻻor / ..ـﻼla¯/, the same principle is applied as when ../ ﻟـl/ is
followed by alif with hamzatu l-qat˙
i  ,أi.e. / ﻷl... / (refer to chapter 6).

Chapter 9
Sun and moon letters,
hamzatu l-was˙li (was˙lah)
9.1
Sun and moon letters
The Arabic consonants are phonetically divided into two major classes
called:
sun letters,   ُﺣ ُﺮو ٌف  َﺷ ْﻤ ِﺴـ َّﻴ ٌﺔh˙uru¯fun sˇamsiyyatun, assimilating
moon letters,   ُﺣ ُﺮو ٌف  َﻗ َﻤ ِﺮ َّﻳ ٌﺔh˙uru¯fun qamariyyatun, non-assimilating
9.2
Sun letters
The sun letters have received their name from the Arabic word for
‘sun’, ﺲٌ
َﺷـ ْﻤ
 sˇamsun, whose ﬁrst letter, .../ ﺷـsˇ/, belongs to the class
of assimilating letters.
There are fourteen sun letters. These letters are pronounced with the
tongue touching the teeth or front part of the mouth:
9.3
When the deﬁnite article .../  َأ ْﻟـal.../ is attached to a word
which begins with a sun letter, the sound .../ ﻟـl/ of the deﬁnite article is
assimilated to the sound of the following sun letter. Although the ...ﻟـ
/l/ is not pronounced, it is written as such (without a suku¯n), but in the
transliteration it is omitted. Owing to the assimilation, the ﬁrst con-
sonant of the word is doubled, which is indicated by a sˇaddah ــ ّــــ
above it.

9.4
Moon letters
The other fourteen letters are called moon letters, because the ﬁrst letter,
.../ ﻗـq/, of the Arabic word for ‘moon’,   َﻗ َﻤ ٌﺮqamarun, represents the
class of non-assimilating letters:
9.5
When the deﬁnite article .../  َأ ْﻟـal.../ is attached to a word
beginning with a moon letter, the la¯m .../ ﻟـl.../ of the article is not
assimilated and retains its pronunciation, e.g.
Note: The letters / جg˘/ and / يy/ are counted as moon letters (non-assimilating),
although they are pronounced with the tongue touching the front part of the
mouth, e.g.
  َأ ْﻟـ َﺠ َﺒ ُﻞal-g˘abalu, the mountain
9.6
Hamzatu l-was˙li (or was˙lah)
Hamzatu l-was˙li, ْﺻ ِﻞ
 , َﻫ ْﻤ َﺰ ُة  ْﻟ َﻮalso called was˙lah, ْﺻ َﻠﺔ
 , َوmeans
‘joining hamzah’. It is a small sign written above the alif (), which is
not pronounced and appears only at the beginning of a word.
The role of hamzatu l-was˙li (was˙lah) is to connect two words together
in one pronunciation without an intervening glottal stop (hamzatu
l-qat˙
i). It may be compared to the French apostrophe in l’homme
(instead of le homme).

When the article .../  َأ ْﻟـal.../ and the nouns in the table below,
as well as certain verb forms (see chapter 18) with an initial hamzatu
l-qat˙
i such as /  َأa/ and /  ِإi/, are preceded by another word or preﬁx,
they lose their initial hamzatu l-qat˙
i with its vowel. Instead the sign
of hamzatu l-was˙li (was˙lah)  is written in their place over the alif,
as 	, e.g.
Note a: The above-mentioned word /  َﺑﺎ ُبba¯bu/ does not take the deﬁnite
article, according to a rule explained in chapter 12.
Note b: In the above word ّﻄ ْﻔ ُﻞ
ِ
../ ..	ﻟt˙-t˙iﬂu/ (not: َأ ْﻟ ِﻄ ْﻔﻞ- al-t˙iﬂu) the deﬁnite
article is not pronounced as such at all, because there is a was˙lah above the alif
and the initial /t˙/ is a sun letter.

hamzatu l-qat˙
i. Grammarians recommend that only the alif be written with a
vowel over or under it and without hamzatu l-qat˙
i, although it is fully pro-
nounced at the beginning of a sentence or in isolation. However, most school
textbooks throughout the Arab world do write hamzatu l-qat˙
i initially over or
under the alif ( .) ِإ , أIn keeping with the principle of the phonetic rather than
historical-etymological way of spelling, the hamzatu l-qat˙
i initially over or
under the alif will be used in this book also.

Chapter 10
Gender
10.1
There are two genders in Arabic. The term used for gender
is ﺲُ
  َأ ْﻟـ ِﺠ ْﻨal-g˘insu, which literally means ‘sex, race, kind’.
(a)
Masculine nouns,   َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤ َﺬ َّﻛ ُﺮal-mud¯akkaru, are without special
form.
(b)
Feminine nouns,   َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤ َﺆ َّﻧـ ُﺚal-muannat¯u, have several forms as
explained below.
10.2
Ta¯ marbu¯t˙ah
When the letter ha¯ / ...ـﻪ ...هh/ (26) is written with two dots above
( ,)...ـﺔ ...ةit is pronounced as /t/, exactly like the letter / تt/ (3). It
is then called ta¯ marbu¯t˙ah and occurs only at the end of a word, mostly
to indicate the feminine gender of nouns or adjectives.
The most common way to derive feminine nouns and adjectives is by
adding the ending .../ .. َ. ٌة .. َ.ـ ٌﺔatun/ to the masculine form, e.g.
Note a: A few nouns with the feminine ending ta¯ marbu¯t˙ah are masculine,
because they are used only in reference to males, e.g.
Masculine
Feminine
ُﻫ َﻮ َﻃﺎ ِﻟ ٌﺐhuwa t˙a¯libun.ِﻫ َﻲ َﻃﺎ ِﻟ َﺒ ٌﺔhiya t˙a¯libatun.
He is a student.
She is a student.
ُﻫـ َﻮ َوا ِﻟـ ٌﺪhuwa wa¯lidun.ِﻫ َﻲ َوا ِﻟ َﺪ ٌةhiya wa¯lidatun.
He is a father.
She is a mother.

Note b: Nouns ending in ta¯ marbu¯t˙ah .../ . َ.. ٌة . َ.. ـ ٌﺔatun/ do not take the extra
ﬁnal alif  ...ـﺎin the indeﬁnite accusative form. So the correct form is َﻃـﺎ ِﻟـ َﺒـ ًﺔ
t˙a¯libatan (not: .) َﻃـﺎ ِﻟـ َﺒـ ًﺘﺎ
Note c: At the end of a sentence the ﬁnal vowel of a word is normally not
pronounced. Even ta¯ marbu¯t˙ah is usually left unpronounced at the end of a
sentence, as in /  َﻃﺎ ِﻟ َﺒ ٌﺔt˙a¯liba(h)/ for /t˙a¯libatun/ (cf. chapter 4).
10.3
Most parts or organs of the body which occur in pairs are femi-
nine, e.g.
10.4
There are words which are feminine by nature, e.g.
10.5
Most geographical proper names, i.e. names of countries, cities,
towns, villages, etc. are treated as feminine. They are so-called diptotes,
i.e. have only two case endings and no nunation (to be explained in
chapter 22), e.g.
10.6
A few nouns are feminine by usage, e.g.
10.7
There are a number of words, which can be either masculine or
feminine, e.g.

10.8
There are also two other feminine endings. They form diptotes
like the words in paragraph 10.5:
(a)
fath˙ ah + alif + hamzah (... .. َ.ـﺎ ُءa¯u), e.g.
Note: See the discussion of the independent hamzah after alif in
chapter 20.
(b)
fath˙ ah + alif maqs˙u¯rah (... .. َ.ـﻰa¯), e.g.
Note: If a word ends in suku¯n and is followed by another word beginning
with hamzatu al-was˙li (was˙lah), the suku¯n is changed to kasrah. This is
to avoid three consonants occurring after each other. For example, the
verb /  َو َﻗ َﻌ ْﺖwaqaat/ in number 1 in the exercise below is changed to
.../  َو َﻗ َﻌ ِﺖ  ْﻟـwaqaati l-.../.

Chapter 11
Conjunctions, prepositions
and the particle   َﺣ َّﺘﻰh˙ atta¯
11.1
Some conjunctions and prepositions consist of only one con-
sonant with a short vowel. They are joined to the following word.
11.2
Conjunctions   ُﺣ ُﺮو ُف  ْﻟ َﻌ ْﻄـ ِﻒh˙ uru¯fu l-at˙ﬁ
The three conjunctions   َوwa, ...  َﻓـfa and   ُﺛ َّﻢt¯umma are the most
commonly used coordinative conjunctions.
11.3
The conjunction ‘  َوand’ should be joined to the following word
and repeated before every member (constituent) of a series of linked
words, e.g.
1 ٌﺐـِﻟﺎـَﻃَو ُذﺎـَﺘـْﺳ ْ ُﻷَو ُﺮﻳِﺪُﻤـْﻟ َجَﺮـَﺧ
2ﻣَﻌًﺎ
h˘arag˘a l-mudı-ru wa-l-usta¯d¯u wa-t˙a¯libun maan.
The rector and the professor and a student 1went out 2together.
1أَﻛَـﻞَ 
2ﻟـﺰَّﺑُﻮنُ 
3ﺧُـﺒْـﺰًا 
4وَزُﺑْـﺪَةً

6وَﺑَـﻴْﻀًﺎ
akala z-zabu¯nu h˘ubzan wa-zubdatan wa-g˘ubnatan wa-bayd˙an.
2The customer 1ate 3bread 4and butter 5and cheese 6and eggs.
Note: In English it is customary to add the conjunction ‘and’ only before the last
member of a series of coordinated words.
11.4
The conjunction ...‘  َﻓـthen, and then’ is joined to the word
which follows it. It indicates an order or succession between actions or
states, e.g.

1ﺧَﺮَجَ 
2ٌﺐـِﻟﺎَﻄَﻓ ُذﺎَﺘـْﺳ ْ ُﻷَﻓ ُﺮﻳِﺪُﻤـْﻟ
h˘arag˘a l-mudı-ru fa-lusta¯d¯u fa-t˙a¯libun.
2The rector 1went out and then the professor and then a student.
...  َﻓـis also used with a causal sense between two or more verbs or
sentences. It can then be translated into English as ‘so, therefore’, e.g.
1ﺗَﻌِـﺐَ ﻟﻄّ
ِ
ـﻔـْﻞُ 
2ﻓَـﻨَﺎمَ
taiba t˙-t˙iﬂu fa-na¯ma. The child 1became tired 2and so he slept.
OR The tiredness caused the child to sleep.
1وَﻗَﻊَ ﻓِﻲ ﻟﻨَّﻬْﺮِ 2ﻓَﻐَﺮِقَ
waqaa fı- n-nahri fa-g˙ariqa. 
1He fell in the river 2and so he drowned.
11.5‘  ُﺛ َّﻢthen, and’, indicates succession with a break in time between
the actions, e.g.
1ﺧَﺮَجَ ﻟْﻮَزِﻳﺮُ 
2ﺛُﻢَّ 
3ﻟﺴَّﻔِﻴﺮُ ﺛُﻢَّ ﻟﺸُّـﺮْﻃِﻲُّ
h˘arag˘a l-wazı-ru t¯umma s-safı-ru t¯umma sˇ-sˇurt˙iyyu.
The minister 1went out, 2then 3the ambassador and then the policeman.
Note:   َأ ْوaw, ‘or’ is used as a disjunctive conjunction. There is also the
expression:   ِإ َّﻣﺎimma¯ ...   َأ ْوaw ... ‘either ... or ...’, e.g.
إِﻣَّﺎ أَﻧَﺎ أَوْ أَﻧْﺖَimma¯ ana¯ aw anta¯
either me or you
11.6  َﺣ َّﺘﻰh˙ atta¯ is a particle with many meanings and functions.
In the meaning ‘even’, it is considered by Arab grammarians to be a
conjunction, because in this function it can connect a clause or phrase
with a following apposition. Modern Western linguists would, however,
classify it then as a focus particle (or more generally, additive adjunct).
When   َﺣ َّﺘﻰhas this function, the following noun remains in the same case
as the preceding one, e.g.
Conjunc-
tions,
preposi-
tions and
the particle
َﺣ َّﺘﻰh˙atta¯
52

After a transitive verb:
أَﻛَﻞَ ﻟﺴَّﻤَﻜَﺔَ ﺣَﺘَّﻰ ﻟﺮَّأْسَakala s-samakata h˙atta¯ r-rasa.
He ate the ﬁsh, even the head.
After an intransitive verb:
ﻣَﺎتَ ﻟﻨَّﺎسُ ﺣَﺘَّﻰ ﻟْـﻤُﻠُﻮكُ.
ma¯ta n-na¯su h˙atta¯ l-mulu¯ku.
The people died, even the kings.
11.7
Prepositions   ُﺣ ُﺮو ُف  ْﻟـ َﺠ َّﺮh˙ uru¯fu l-g˘arri
The Arabic prepositions can be formally divided into two basic groups:
primary and secondary. The primary prepositions can moreover be
divided into two subgroups: independent and bound (preﬁxed).
The noun governed by the preposition always follows it and is in the
genitive case. If the preposition governs an adverb, the latter does not, of
course, change its form.
As in many other languages, the Arabic prepositions have several
different meanings. The primary prepositions with their basic meanings
are:
Note a: The bound (preﬁxed) prepositions are: ...  ِﺑـ... ,)ﻟ َـ...( ِﻟـand ... . َﻛـThey
are written together with the following word.
Note b: When the prepositions   ِﻣـ ْﻦmin ‘from’, and   َﻋـ ْﻦan, ‘about’, are fol-
lowed by a word having an initial alif with hamzatu l-was˙li (was˙lah), the suku¯n

is changed to fath˙ ah or kasrah, in order to avoid having three consonants fol-
lowing each other, thus smoothing the pronunciation, e.g.
Note c: In certain idioms words such as those below with a sufﬁxed personal
pronoun have the preposition ...  ِﺑـbi..., e.g.
(See more about ..  ِﺑـbi... in chapter 37.)
Examples:

11.8  َﺣ َّﺘﻰh˙ atta¯ as a preposition
When   َﺣ َّﺘﻰfunctions as a preposition with the meaning ‘until, till, up to,
as far as’, the following noun must be in the genitive, e.g.
أَﻛَﻞَ
1ﻟﺴَّﻤَﻜَﺔَ ﺣَﺘَّﻰ ﻟﺮَّأْسِakala s-samakata h˙atta¯ r-rasi. (genitive)
He ate 1the ﬁsh as far as (i.e. except) the head.

11.9
The secondary prepositions are formed from (verbal) nouns by
means of the accusative ending -a. The following are the most common
of them:
Examples:
  َﻗ ْﺒ َﻞ ﻟ ُّﻈ ْﻬ ِﺮqabla d¯˙
-d¯˙
uhri, before noon 
  َﺑ ْﻌ َﺪ ﻟ ُّﻈ ْﻬ ِﺮbada d¯˙
-d¯˙

Note: The above   ُدو َنdu¯ na and   ِﺑ ُﺪو ِنbi-du¯ ni have the same function and may
replace each other, e.g.

sentences by using any of the four prepositions   َﻣ َﻊmaa,   ِﻋ ْﻨ َﺪinda, َﻟـ َﺪى
lada¯ or ... ) َﻟـ...(  ِﻟـli... (la...) after the noun expressing the owner. The
thing owned is expressed in the nominative case as the nominal predi-
cate. The differences in the use of these prepositions often depend on
nuances.
(a)
The preposition   َﻣ َﻊis more frequently used when referring to
available possession at a given time, e.g.
  َﻣ َﻊ ﻟ َّﻄﺎ ِﻟ ِﺐ  َﺳ َّﻴﺎ َر ٌةmaa t˙-t˙a¯libi sayya¯ratun.
The student has a car (with him). (lit. With the student [now] a car.)
(b)
The preposition   ِﻋ ْﻨ َﺪis the general way of expressing possession,
both concrete and abstract, e.g.
ﻋِﻨْﺪَ ﻟﻄَّﺎﻟِﺐِ ﺳَﻴَّﺎرَةٌ
inda t˙-t˙a¯libi sayya¯ratun. The student has a car.
ﻋِﻨْﺪَ ﻟْـﺨَﺒِﻴﺮِ ﻓِﻜْﺮَةٌ
inda l-h˘abı-ri ﬁkratun. The expert has an idea.
  ِﻋ ْﻨ َﺪcan also be used for time, e.g.
  ِﻋ ْﻨ َﺪ ﻟ ُّﻈ ْﻬ ِﺮinda d¯˙
-d¯˙
uhri, at (by) noon
(c)
The preposition   َﻟـ َﺪىlada¯ is used in the elaborate literary style
more or less in the same way as   َﻣ َﻊmaa and   ِﻋ ْﻨ َﺪinda to express
possession.
ﻟَﺪَى ﻟﺘّﺎﺟِﺮِ ﻣَﺎلٌ ﻛَﺜِﻴﺮٌ
lada¯ t-ta¯g˘iri ma¯lun kat¯ı-run. The merchant has a lot of money.
(d)
The preposition ...  )ﻟ َـ...( ِﻟـexpresses both concrete and abstract
possession and can also be used with inanimate possessors, as well
as in the sense of ‘for, to, because of’, e.g.
ﻟِﻠْﺒَﻴْﺖِ ﺑَﺎبٌ وَاﺣِﺪٌ
li-l-bayti ba¯bun wa¯h˙idun. The house has only one door.

11.11
Spelling rules for the preposition  ... ِﻟـli...
(a)
When ...  ِﻟـli... ‘for, to’ precedes a word with the deﬁnite article
...  َأ ْﻟـal..., the hamzah with its alif  أis omitted in writing and
pronunciation, and the two la¯ms are joined together, e.g.
(b)
When the preposition ...  ِﻟـli... precedes a word which itself begins
with the letter la¯m ...  ِﻟـand which has a deﬁnite article, the alif +
hamzah of the deﬁnite article will again be elided, but because
three la¯ms cannot be written in succession, the la¯m of the article
and the initial la¯m of the following word are written as one with
the sign sˇaddah (remember that la¯m is a sun letter), e.g.
11.12
The adjective qualifying a noun preceded by a preposition is
also in the genitive case, thus agreeing with the noun it qualiﬁes, e.g.
1ﺳَـﻜَـﻦَ ﻓِﻲ 
2ﻟﺸَّـﺎرِعِ ﻟْـﺠَﺪِﻳـﺪِ

Chapter 12
Id˙a¯fah construction (genitive
attribute) and the ﬁve nouns
12.1
The meaning of the Arabic term id˙ a¯fah   ِإ َﻀﺎ َﻓ ٌﺔis ‘addition’,
‘annexation’, or ‘attachment’. This kind of annexation occurs when two
nouns (or an adjective and a noun) are linked together and immediately
follow each other. It is comparable to a genitive or attributive construc-
tion, where the ﬁrst noun (or adjective) is the head constituent and the
second noun is the attribute.
The ﬁrst noun (or adjective) of the id˙ a¯fah construction is called
َﻀﺎ ُف
  َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤal-mud˙ a¯fu, meaning ‘annexed’ or ‘attached’. The second
noun is called َﻀﺎ ُف  ِإ َﻟ ْﻴ ِﻪ
  َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤal-mud˙ a¯fu ilay-hi, meaning ‘annexer’ or
‘attacher’. There are two variants of the id˙ a¯fah construction.
12.2
The ﬁrst variant: genitive construction
The ﬁrst variant is called َﺿﺎ َﻓ ُﺔ  ْﻟـ َﺤ ِﻘﻴ ِﻘ َّﻴ ُﺔ
  َأ ِْﻹal-id˙ a¯fatu l-h˙ aqı¯qiyyatu,
genuine annexation. It corresponds to the genitive construction and is
similar to English ‘of ...’ or ‘...’s’. In the following examples, the annexer
expresses the possessor and the annexed a possessed item:
Indeﬁnite form
Deﬁnite form
َﻀﺎ ُف  ِإ َﻟ ْﻴ ِﻪ
َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤ

12.3
The semantic relation between the two constituents of the
id˙ a¯fah construction is not, however, always that of possessed/property
+ possessor or item + the entity to which the item belongs.
(a)
In the following example the relation is that of item and material:
Note: You can also use the preposition   ِﻣ ْﻦmin to express the material,
e.g.
(b)
In the following example the relation is that between part and
whole (partitive attribute):
(c)
In the following cases, which are ambiguous, the relation is that of
item and contents or item and purpose/material:

Rules concerning the id˙ a¯fah construction
(a)
Whether or not the ﬁrst noun (the annexed) refers to something
deﬁnite or indeﬁnite, it never takes the deﬁnite article ...  َأ ْﻟـal... or
nunation.
(b)
The second noun (the annexer) is always in the genitive case.
It may take the article ...  َأ ْﻟـal... or nunation according to its
deﬁniteness status.

construc-
tion, the
ﬁve nouns

(c)
If the second noun (the annexer) is in the deﬁnite form, it
causes the whole id˙ a¯fah construction to be deﬁnite. If the
second noun is indeﬁnite, then the entire id˙ a¯fah construction is
indeﬁnite.
12.5
The second variant: id˙ a¯fah adjective
The second variant of the id˙ a¯fah construction may also be called
id˙ a¯fah adjective, because an adjective is construed with a deﬁnite noun
in the genitive case. The noun then expresses something with regard or
respect to which the quality of the adjective obtains (Latin: genetivus
respectus). In Arabic this construction is called َﺿﺎ َﻓ ُﺔ  َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮ  ْﻟـ َﺤ ِﻘﻴ ِﻘ َّﻴ ِﺔ
َأ ِْﻹ
al-id˙ a¯fatu g˙ayru l-h˙ aqı¯qiyyati, which means improper annexation,
e.g.
12.6
The ﬁrst adjective in the above examples may take the deﬁnite
article ...  َأ ْﻟــal... when a noun in the deﬁnite form precedes it, although
this contradicts rule 12.4a mentioned above.

ﬁve nouns

12.7
When the ﬁrst noun (the annexed) in the genuine id˙ a¯fah con-
struction is qualiﬁed by an adjective, the adjective agrees with the noun
in number, gender and case. But the adjective must be placed after the
whole id˙ a¯fah construction, e.g.
12.8
In an unvocalized text it is difﬁcult to know which noun (ﬁrst
or second) the adjective is referring to when it is placed after an
id˙ a¯fah construction. Vowelling/vocalization is the remedy for this,
e.g.
12.9
A complex id˙ a¯fah phrase may contain several nested annexers
(َﻀﺎ ٌف  ِإ َﻟ ْﻴ ِﻪ
 ,) ُﻣbut only the last annexer may take the deﬁnite article,
e.g.

Number
Dual and plural
13.1
Arabic nouns and adjectives are inﬂected for three numbers:
13.2
Dual
The dual is used for pairs, namely for two individuals or things of the
same kind or class, e.g. two boys, two girls, two hands, two books, etc.
The dual is formed by replacing the case endings of the singular form
with the following sufﬁxes:
.../ .. َ.ـﺎ ِنa¯ni/ for nominative
.../ .. َ.ـ ْﻴـ ِﻦayni/ for accusative and genitive
13.3
The ﬁnal ta¯ marbu¯t˙ah  .. َ. ٌة ,.. َ.ـ ٌﺔin a singular noun becomes a
regular ....../...ـﺘـt.../ before dual endings, e.g.
singular   ُﻣ ْﻔ َﺮ ٌدmufradun
dual   ُﻣ َﺜـ ّﻨ ًـﻰmut¯annan

malikatun, a queen
malikata¯ni

13.4
The ﬁnal syllable .../... ِنni/ of the dual masculine and feminine is
elided when the word is in the id˙ a¯fah construction, e.g.
(a)
Dual (nom. masc.)
(b)
Dual (acc. and gen. masc.)
(c)
Dual (nom. fem.)
(d)
Dual (acc. and gen. fem.)
13.5
When a singular feminine noun ends with .../ ,.. َ.ـﺎءa¯/, the ﬁnal
hamzah  // ءis replaced by wa¯w  وbefore dual endings, e.g.
(There is more about hamzah as a ﬁnal radical  .. َ.ـﺎءin chapter 20.)

13.6
The ﬁnal alif maqs˙u¯rah  ـﻰ
ِ
 ...of a singular noun becomes
ya¯ ....../ ...ـﻴـy.../ before dual endings, e.g.
13.7
In the dual, adjectives always agree with the nouns they qualify
in gender and case, e.g.
13.8
The plural
There are two plural types in Arabic:
(a)
The sound plural   َأ ْﻟـ َﺠ ْﻤ ُﻊ ﻟ َّﺴـﺎ ِﻟ ُﻢmay be compared to the English
external plural or regular plural.
(b)
The broken plural   َﺟـ ْﻤـ ُﻊ ﻟ َّﺘـ ْﻜ ِﺴـﻴ ِﺮmay be compared to the English
internal or irregular plural. (Broken plurals are explained in
chapter 21.)
13.9
The sound masculine plural   َﺟـ ْﻤـ ُﻊ  ْﻟـ ُﻤـ َﺬ َّﻛـ ِﺮ ﻟ َّﺴــﺎ ِﻟـ ُﻢof nouns
and adjectives is formed by replacing the case endings of the singular
with the following two sufﬁxes:
.../ ... ُ.ـﻮ َنu¯na/ in the nominative
.../ ... ِ ـﻴـ َﻦı-na/ in the accusative and genitive

13.10
As in the dual, the ﬁnal syllable .../ ...ـ َﻦna/ of the sound
plural masculine disappears, if the word enters the id˙ a¯fah construction,
e.g.
(a)
Sound masculine plural nominative:
(b)
Sound masculine plural accusative and genitive:
13.11
The sound feminine plural   َﺟ ْﻤ ُﻊ  ْﻟـ ُﻤ َﺆ َّﻧ ِﺚ ﻟ َّﺴـﺎ ِﻟ ُﻢis formed by
adding the following two sufﬁxes to the singular word stem:
.../ .. َ.ـﺎ ٌتa¯tun/ in the nominative
.../ .. َ.ـﺎ ٍتa¯tin/ in the accusative and genitive
13.12
It should be noted that the sound feminine plural has only two
vowel endings for the three cases, whether they are in the deﬁnite or
indeﬁnite form, e.g.
13.13
The sound feminine plural mostly refers to human beings.
However, some masculine nouns indicating non-human beings also take
the sound feminine plural endings, e.g.
ُﻣـ َﻌـ َّﻠـ ُﻤـﻮ  ْﻟـ َﻤـ ْﺪ َر َﺳـ ِﺔ

Number
73

13.14
As in the dual, any feminine noun which has a ﬁnal hamzah
.../ .. َ.ـﺎ ُءa¯u/ replaces it in the plural with wa¯w / وw/, e.g.
13.15
As in the dual, an adjective always agrees in gender and case
with the noun it qualiﬁes, e.g.
13.16
An adjective qualifying a sound feminine plural referring to
non-human beings or things is in the feminine singular, e.g.
Note a: The general principle is that plural non-human nouns are grammatically
feminine singular, which is why the adjective and any other element (including
the verb) that qualiﬁes such a noun will also be in the feminine singular. This is
called agreement or concord.
Note b: If two nouns of different gender are qualiﬁed by the same element, that
element will be in the masculine dual.

Chapter 14
Perfect tense verbs, root and
radicals, triliteral verbs and
word order
14.1
There are two main verb tenses in Arabic:
(a)
Perfect tense: corresponds usually to the English past or perfect
tense.
(b)
Imperfect tense: corresponds usually to the English present or
future tense (see chapter 17).
Note: The tenses in Arabic do not express the time of an event in the same
precise way as the primary tenses in Indo-European languages. The Arabic
tenses can be better understood as different aspects of viewing the action in
terms of an opposition between a stated or proposed fact and an action or state
in progress or preparation. That is why the terms perfect and imperfect tense do
not correspond to the meaning of these terms in, for example, English (in fact,
the literal Latin meanings of the terms perfect and imperfect are more helpful in
this regard). In spite of this, we will keep to the traditional terms, since they are
widely employed in Western Arabic textbooks.
14.2
Perfect tense
The perfect tense, ِﺿﻲ
 , َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ  ْﻟـ َﻤﺎindicates mostly a past state, com-
pleted action or established fact. In the third and second persons
the perfect may also express a wish or benediction. In conditional
sentences the perfect expresses a hypothesis (to be explained in
chapter 39).
Note: Because there is no inﬁnitive in Arabic in the same sense as in English, the
third person masculine singular of the perfect tense is given as the corresponding
basic or reference form of the verb. Thus, for example, the basic verb form
  َﻛـ َﺘـ َﺐkataba means ‘he wrote’ or ‘he has written’. But when used as a general

reference form for the said verb with all its various forms,   َﻛـ َﺘـ َﺐkataba is
conventionally translated by the English inﬁnitive ‘to write’.
14.3
Root and radicals
Most of the Arabic basic verb forms consist of three consonants
(radicals) and three vowels (CVCVCV). The three consonants constitute
the root of the verb, which is why they are called radicals (i.e. ‘root-
makers’). (Vowels cannot function as radicals.) It is important to know
and recognize the root of every verb, because the root is the absolute
(invariable) basis of all the different forms of the verb as well as of
most nouns, adjectives and adverbs and even many prepositions. In
Arabic dictionaries most words and word forms are therefore entered
alphabetically under the respective root.
Note: The abbreviation ‘C’ above denotes ‘consonant’ and ‘V’ denotes ‘vowel’.
14.4
Triliteral verbs
(a)
Roots with three radicals are called triliteral verbs (singular:
  َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ  ْﻟـ ُّﺜـ َﻼ ِﺛﻲal-ﬁlu t¯-t¯ula¯t¯ı¯). Thus the root of the triliteral verb
kataba ‘to write’ is k-t-b. This is the form under which you will
ﬁnd the verb kataba (and other forms of this verb) in Arabic
dictionaries.
(b)
The triliteral verbs have three patterns of vowelling. In the basic
form the ﬁrst and last consonants (radicals) are always vowelled
with fath˙ ah /a/. But the middle consonant (radical) may be
vowelled with any of the three short vowels:
14.5
Separate personal pronouns for the subject and object are
usually not used in Arabic verbal sentences. Verbs are conjugated for the
CaCaCa

person, gender and number of the subject and pronominal object by
means of sufﬁxes (and in the imperfect also preﬁxes). Sufﬁxes which
refer to the subject are called personal endings. These endings are
written in bold type in the transliteration of the conjugation table below.
Note: There are various ways to read the order of the Arabic verb conjugation.
The order used in this book is not the Arabic way, but rather an old tradition
still employed in most of the European Arabic textbooks.

(a)
When a verb in the third person is placed ﬁrst in the sentence, the
verb must be in the singular, even though the subject may be in the
plural or dual. The verb always agrees with the gender of the
subject, however, e.g.
Remember: When a verb in the third person feminine singular is
followed by a word beginning with hamzatu l-was˙li (was˙lah), the
suku¯n on the ﬁnal /...t/  .. َ.ـ ْﺖis replaced by kasrah  ... َـ ِﺖto avoid
having three consonants in succession, e.g.
...َﺷ ِﺮ َﺑ ِﺖ  ْﻟـ ِﺒ ْﻨ ُﺖ
 sˇaribati l-bintu... (not: .َﺷـ ِﺮ َﺑ ْﺖ  ْﻟـ ِﺒ ْﻨ ُﺖ
 sˇaribat l-
bintu...)
(b)
If the subject refers to a human being and the verb is placed after
the subject, the verb must agree with the subject in number and
gender, e.g.
14.7
If the subject is not expressed by a noun or separate pronoun, the
verb alone expresses its number, whether it be singular, dual or plural,
e.g.
14.8
If the subject is in the plural and refers to non-humans, the verb
is in the feminine singular, e.g.

14.9
If the subject is in the dual and refers to non-humans, the verb
is in the dual (if following the subject) and agrees with the gender of the
subject, just as with dual human beings, e.g.
َﺷـ ِﺮ َب  ْﻟ َﻜ ْﻠ َﺒﺎ ِن  َﺣ ِﻠﻴ ًﺒﺎ
sˇariba l-kalba¯ni h˙alı-ban. The (two) dogs (m.) drank (m. sing.) milk.
َأ ْﻟ َﻜ ْﻠ َﺒﺎ ِن  َﺷـ ِﺮ َﺑﺎ  َﺣ ِﻠﻴ ًﺒﺎ
al-kalba¯ni sˇariba¯ h˙alı-ban. The (two) dogs (m.) drank (m. dual) milk.
َﺷـ ِﺮ َﺑ ِﺖ  ْﻟ َﻜ ْﻠ َﺒ َﺘﺎ ِن  َﺣ ِﻠﻴ ًﺒﺎ
sˇaribati l-kalbata¯ni h˙alı-ban. The (two) dogs (f.) drank (f. sing.) milk.
َأ ْﻟ َﻜ ْﻠ َﺒ َﺘﺎ ِن  َﺷـ ِﺮ َﺑ َﺘﺎ  َﺣ ِﻠﻴ ًﺒﺎ
al-kalbata¯ni sˇaribata¯ h˙alı-ban. The (two) dogs (f.) drank (f. dual) milk.
14.10
The verb in the perfect tense is sometimes preceded by the
particle   َﻗ ْﺪqad, or   َﻟ َﻘ ْﺪla-qad, which is usually not translated. The
purpose of these particles is merely a matter of style or to emphasize
the completion or realization of the action of the verb, like adding the
corroborating auxiliary ‘do’, the adverb ‘really’ or ‘already’, e.g.
  َﻗ ْﺪ  َﺷ ِﺮ َب  ْﻟـ َﺤ ِﻠﻴ َﺐqad sˇariba l-h˙alı-ba.
He did drink the milk. OR He has already drunk the milk.
14.11
Negative of the perfect tense
The negative particle   َﻣـﺎma¯ ‘not’ is used to negate the perfect tense and
is placed before the verb, e.g.
  َﻣﺎ  َﺷ ِﺮ َب  ْﻟـ َﺤ ِﻠـﻴ َﺐma¯ sˇariba l-h˙alı-ba. He did not drink the milk.
Note: A more common way of negating the perfect in modern literary Arabic is
introduced in chapter 28.
َﺷ ِﺮ َﺑـ ِﺖ  ْﻟ ِﻜ َﻼ ُب  َﺣ ِﻠﻴ ًﺒﺎ
َأ ْﻟ ِﻜ َﻼ ُب  َﺷـ ِﺮ َﺑ ْﺖ  َﺣ ِﻠﻴ ًﺒﺎ

I passed by you. (You are the one I passed by.)
15.3
Sometimes the verb is preceded by a separate personal pronoun

The sufﬁx pronouns ِﺼ َﻠ ُﺔ
َّﻀ َﻤﺎ ِﺋ ُﺮ  ْﻟـ ُﻤ َّﺘ

and genitive forms of the personal pronouns. They can be attached to
nouns, prepositions or verbs:

Note: The sufﬁx pronoun for the ﬁrst person singular ../ ... ِﻧﻲnı¯/ ‘me’, is attached
only to a verb, indicating the direct object (verbal object).
15.5
When sufﬁx pronouns are attached to nouns, they function as
possessive pronouns, i.e. as the genitive case of the separate personal
pronouns. The noun and the sufﬁxed pronoun form together a type of
id˙ a¯fah construction, e.g.
15.6
The ﬁnal syllable nu¯n .../  ...نn/ + fath˙ ah/kasrah of the dual
and sound masculine plural endings is dropped before a sufﬁx pronoun,
e.g.
15.7
The ﬁrst person singular sufﬁx .../ ... ِ يı¯/ ‘my’ becomes / ... َي
...ya/ when it is preceded by a long vowel or a diphthong, e.g.
  َﻗ َﻠ ِﻤﻲqalam-ı-, my pen  َﺑ ْﻴ ُﺘ ُﻪbaytu-hu, his house

15.8
When the sufﬁx pronoun for the ﬁrst person singular is attached
to a sound masculine plural, the ﬁnal .../ ... ُ.وu¯ / is changed to / ... ِ  َّي
...iyya/ in all three cases, e.g.
15.9
The id˙ a¯fah construction may contain more than one annexed

 In contradiction to the above grammatical rule, in modern
literary Arabic two coordinated annexed nouns are often placed before
the annexer, e.g.

preposition ending in alif maqs˙u¯rah  ى

The sufﬁx pronouns may be attached to the bound particle
  ِإ َّﻳﺎiyya¯, which functions as supporter for the direct object when it is
placed ﬁrst or when the verb takes a sufﬁx pronoun that denotes the
indirect object.
ِإ َّﻳﺎ َك  َﻧ ْﻌ ُﺒ ُﺪ  َو ِإ َّﻳﺎ َك  َﻧ ْﺴ َﺘ ِﻌﻴ ُﻦ

Thee (alone) do we worship; Thee (alone) we do ask for help.
(Quran)
  َﺑﺎ َﻋ ِﻨﻲ  ِإ َّﻳﺎ ُهba¯a-nı- iyya¯-hu. He sold it to me.
In the above sentence the sufﬁx pronoun after the verb is the indirect
object. Therefore the particle   ِإ َّﻳﺎiyya¯ is needed to carry the sufﬁx
pronoun that functions as direct object.
(a)
The particle   ِإ َّﻳﺎiyya¯ can also be used in the meaning ‘(together)
with’ in combination with the preﬁxed conjunction   َوwa in
phrases coordinating a separate pronoun with a sufﬁx pronoun,
e.g.
  َأ َﻧﺎ  َو ِإ َّﻳﺎ ُﻫ ْﻢana¯ wa-iyya¯-hum, I together with them
(b)
The particle   ِإ َّﻳﺎiyya¯ may be used as a warning when it is attached
to a sufﬁx pronoun in the second person singular and plural,
e.g.
15.22
The alif maqs˙u¯rah / ...ىa¯/ changes to the regular form of
/ ...اa¯/ when a sufﬁx pronoun is attached to the word, e.g.
  ِإ َّﻳﺎ َك  ْﻟ َﻜ ِﺬ َبiyya¯-ka l-kad¯iba.
Beware of lies!
OR  ِإ َّﻳﺎ َك َو ْﻟ َﻜ ِﺬ َبiyya¯-ka wa-l-kad¯iba.

Demonstrative, reﬂexive and
reciprocal pronouns
16.1
As in English, there are in Arabic two series of demonstrative
pronouns   َأ ْﺳ َﻤﺎ ُء  ِْﻹ َﺷﺎ َر ِةasma¯u l-isˇa¯rati. Both of them have separate
masculine and feminine forms in the singular and dual (in the plural
there is no distinction between masculine and feminine forms). In the
singular and plural each series has only one form for all three cases, but
in the dual they are declined for two cases: nominative and accusative-
genitive:
this, this one
singular
dual
plural
masc.
fem.

16.2
The demonstrative pronouns can be used both independently (as
nouns) and adjectivally in Arabic:
Note: In the adjectival construction the noun must be preceded by the deﬁnite
article.
16.3
When a demonstrative pronoun is used as the subject in a
nominal sentence where the predicate is a noun made deﬁnite by the
article ...  َأ ْﻟـal-, a third-person personal pronoun must be inserted
between the subject and predicate to serve as a copula ‘is, are’, e.g.
that, that one

16.4
When the predicate noun is in the id˙ a¯fah construction, or
followed by a sufﬁxed pronoun, or when it is a proper name, the
insertion of the personal pronoun between the demonstrative pronoun
and predicate is optional, e.g.
16.5
When the predicate is a noun in the indeﬁnite form, no personal
pronoun is needed between the demonstrative pronoun and predicate
to act as copula, e.g.
16.6
Demonstrative pronouns qualifying plural nouns referring to
non-human beings take the feminine singular forms, viz. ‘ ﻫ ِﺬ ِهthis’ and
‘  ِﺗ ْﻠ َﻚthat’, e.g.
Note: The adjectives   َﻣ ْﻜ ُﺴﻮ َر ٌةand َﻀ ٌﺔ
  َﻣ ِﺮﻳare in the singular because they
refer to non-human beings.
16.7
When a demonstrative pronoun qualiﬁes the ﬁrst noun (the
annexed) in the id˙ a¯fah construction, the demonstrative pronoun is
placed after the whole phrase, e.g.

16.8
Reﬂexive and emphasizing (corroborative) pronouns
(a)
Arabic uses the noun ﺲٌ
  َﻧ ْﻔnafsun (pl. ٌﺲ
  َأ ْﻧ ُﻔanfusun), ‘soul, self,
same’, as a reﬂexive pronoun: ‘-self, -selves’. Then it must be
followed by a sufﬁx pronoun, e.g.
(b)
Another use of ﺲٌ
  َﻧ ْﻔnafsun is to emphasize or corroborate a
following noun in the id˙ a¯fah construction. It then has the
meaning ‘same’ or ‘-self, -selves’, e.g.
ِﺲ  ْﻟ َﻴ ْﻮ ِم
ِﻓﻲ  َﻧ ْﻔ
fı- nafsi l-yawmi
on the same day
(c)
Alternatively, ﺲٌ
  َﻧ ْﻔnafsun can follow the noun or (implicit) pro-
noun it emphasises, but then it must take a sufﬁx pronoun, e.g.
(d)
The noun   َذا ٌتd¯a¯tun (pl.   َذ َوا ٌتd¯a¯wa¯tun) ‘essence, identity, same,
self’ can be used just like ﺲٌ
  َﻧ ْﻔnafsun, though less commonly in the
reﬂexive meaning. For example:
ِﻓﻲ  َذا ِت  ْﻟ َﻴ ْﻮ ِم
fı- d¯a¯ti l-yawmi
on the same day
ﻫ َﺬا  َﺟ َّﻴ ٌﺪ

(e)
The adjective form (nisbah, introduced in chapter 25) of َذا ٌت
d¯a¯tun is   َذا ِﺗﻲd¯a¯tı¯, ‘self-’, e.g.
َأ ْﻟـ ُﺤ ْﻜ ُﻢ ﻟ َّﺬا ِﺗﻲ
al-h˙ukmu d¯-d¯a¯tı-
self-rule (autonomy)
Note a:   ُرو ٌحru¯ h˙ un (pl.   َأ ْروا ٌحarwa¯h˙ un), ‘spirit’, is used in some Arabic-
speaking countries in the same way as ﺲُ
  َﻧ ْﻔnafsun.
Note b: The word   َﻋ ْﻴ ٌﻦynun ‘eye, essence’ is also sometimes used to empha-
size a noun, just like   َﻧ ْﻔﺲnafsun.
Note c: Reﬂexive action is often expressed by special derived verb forms, which
will be introduced in chapter 18.
16.9
Reciprocal pronoun
Arabic uses the noun ﺾٌ
  َﺑ ْﻌbad˙ un ‘some, a few’, as the reciprocal
pronoun, ‘each other, one another’. Then ﺾٌ
  َﺑ ْﻌbad˙ un is often
repeated. The ﬁrst ﺾٌ
  َﺑ ْﻌbad˙ un takes a sufﬁx pronoun, e.g.
Note: A reciprocal action is often conveyed in Arabic by a special derived verb
form to be introduced in chapter 18.

Chapter 17
Imperfect tense verb in the
indicative and word order
17.1
The Arabic imperfect tense َﻀﺎ ِر ُع
  َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤexpresses an incomplete,
continuous or habitual action or on-going state. It refers usually to
the present, in which case it is translated by the English (simple
or progressive) present tense, for example   َﻳ ْﺸ َﺮ ُبyasˇrabu, ‘he drinks’
OR ‘he is drinking’. In certain appropriate contexts, which will be
explained later, it may, however, refer to the past or future, in which case
it is translated by the English (simple or progressive) imperfect or future
(sometimes present), respectively. It is thus to be emphasized that the
Arabic imperfect tense is not like the English imperfect, which almost
always refers to the past. (See also chapter 14 on the perfect tense.)
17.2
There are three moods in Arabic for the imperfect tense: indica-
tive, subjunctive and jussive. The indicative mood is the basic mood of
the verb and it is mostly used in forming statements and questions. In
this chapter we will deal only with the indicative mood of the imperfect
tense, َﻀﺎ ِر ُع  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﺮ ُﻓﻮ ُع
( . َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤSee chapter 28 regarding the other moods.)
17.3
‘Vowelling’ of the middle radical in the imperfect tense
It was mentioned in chapter 14 that the triliteral verb in the perfect tense
has three patterns of vowelling for the middle radical. The following are
the rules of corresponding vowelling for the middle radical in the
imperfect tense:
If the middle radical in the perfect tense has:

(a)
fath˙ ah, then the middle vowel of the imperfect tense can be fath˙ ah,
kasrah or d˙ ammah, e.g.
(b)
kasrah, then the middle vowel of the imperfect is in almost all
cases fath˙ ah, e.g.
(c)
d˙ ammah, then the middle vowel of the imperfect is also d˙ ammah,
e.g.
17.4
Here is the conjugation of the imperfect indicative as exempliﬁed
by the verb   َﻛ َﺘ َﺐkataba, ‘to write’. The third person masculine singular
of this verb is   َﻳ ْﻜ ُﺘ ُﺐyaktubu, which can be translated as ‘he writes’, ‘he is
writing’, or ‘he will write’. In the conjugation table below, the preﬁxes
and endings referring to the person, gender and number of the subject
are written in bold type and small letters, and the roots in capitals. (See
also conjugation A2.1 in Appendix 2.)

Word order in sentences with an imperfect tense verb
The imperfect verb either precedes or follows its subject. The verb
agrees with its subject in the same way as for the perfect tense, e.g.
Sing.َأ ْﻟ َﻌﺎ ِﻣ ُﻞ  َﻳ ْﺬ َﻫ ُﺐ  ُﻛ َّﻞ  َﻳ ْﻮ ٍم  ِإ َﻟﻰ  َﻋ َﻤ ِﻠ ِﻪ

yad¯habu l-umma¯lu kulla yawmin ila¯ amali-him.
17.6
Future
The imperfect tense indicates the future when the context clearly refers
to the future, e.g.
(v. َﻳ ْﺬ َﻫ ُﺐ  ْﻟ َﻮ ِزﻳ ُﺮ  َﺑ ْﻌ َﺪ  ُأ ْﺳ ُﺒﻮ ٍع  ِإ َﻟﻰ  َﺑ ْﻴ ُﺮو َت ) َذ َﻫ َﺐ
yad¯habu l-wazı-ru bada usbu¯in ila¯ bayru¯ta.
The minister will go (OR is going) to Beirut after one week (in a week’s
time).

َأ ْﺑ َﻌ ُﺚ  ا
abat¯u ha¯d¯ihi r-risa¯lata g˙adan.
I will send (OR I am going to send) this letter tomorrow.
17.7
When the context does not refer speciﬁcally to the future, it is
necessary to specify it by adding the particle ...َﺳـ
 sa... or َﺳ ْﻮ َف
 sawfa
‘will, shall’ before the imperfect verb, e.g.
(v. َﺳ َﻜ َﻦ
َﺳ ْﻮ َف /  َﺳ َﻴ ْﺴ ُﻜ ُﻦ  َﻣ ِﻌﻲ)
sawfa/sa-yaskunu maı-. He will live with me.
Note: Even when the context refers to the future, very often the particles
...َﺳـ
 sa... or َﺳ ْﻮ َف
 sawfa are added before the imperfect verb anyway,
e.g.
َﺳ ْﻮ َف /  َﺳ َﻴ ْﺬ َﻫ ُﺐ  ْﻟ َﻮ ِزﻳ ُﺮ  َﺑ ْﻌ َﺪ  ُأ ْﺳ ُﺒﻮ ٍع  ِإ َﻟﻰ  َﺑ ْﻴ ُﺮو َت

The particle   َﻗ ْﺪqad with the imperfect
The particle   َﻗ ْﺪhas already been mentioned in chapter 14 in connection
with the perfect tense in order to emphasize the completion of an action
or state. But the particle   َﻗ ْﺪis used with the imperfect tense to denote the
uncertainty of an action or state, and is translated as ‘may’, ‘might’ or
‘perhaps’, e.g.
  َﻗ ْﺪ  َﻧ ْﻜ ُﺘ ُﺐ  ِإ َﻟ ْﻴ ِﻬ ْﻢqad naktubu ilay-him.
We may write to them. OR Perhaps we will write to them.

  َﻗ ْﺪ  َﻳ ْﺤqad yah˙d˙uru l-usta¯d¯u g˙adan.
The teacher might come tomorrow.
17.9
Negative of the imperfect tense
The following three negative particles precede the verb in the imperfect:
Example:
َﻣﺎ /  َﻻ  َﻳ ْﺸ َﺮ ُب  َﻗ ْﻬ َﻮ ًة  ِﻓﻲ  ْﻟـ َﻤ َﺴﺎ ِء
ma¯ / la¯ yasˇrabu qahwatan fı- l-masa¯I.

َﺳ ْﻮ َف  َﻻ  َﻳ ْﺬ َﻫ ُﺐ  َو َﻻ  َﻳ ْﻜ ُﺘ ُﺐ  ِإ َﻟﻰ  ُأ َّﻤ ِﻪ
sawfa la¯ yad¯habu wa-la¯ yaktubu ila¯ ummi-hi.
He will neither go nor write to his mother.

Chapter 18
Derived verb forms (stems),
roots and radicals, transitive
and intransitive verbs
18.1
Until now we have dealt with the basic verb form of triliteral
verbs (  َأ ْﻟ ِﻔـ ْﻌـ ُﻞ  ْﻟـ ُّﺜـ َﻼ ِﺛﻲal-ﬁlu t¯-t¯ula¯t¯ı¯). The basic verb form has the
pattern CVCVCV, as for example   َﻛ َﺘ َﺐkataba ‘to write’ (lit. ‘he wrote’,
perfect tense). The basic verb form is called in Arabic   َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤ َﺠ َّﺮ ُدal-
mug˘arradu, meaning ‘peeled’ or ‘stripped’, because it lacks preﬁxes and
inﬁxes.
18.2
At this point it is important to explain more about the terms
(verbal) root and radical, which are very special features in Arabic
grammar. The root is the absolute basis for forming all verb forms
as well as most nouns, adjectives, adverbs and even prepositions (see
chapter 14). The root usually consists of three consonants. These con-
sonants are called radicals, because together they make up the root, e.g.
/ ﻛﺘﺐktb/ ‘to write’,   ِﻛ َﺘﺎ ٌبkita¯bun ‘book’, / ﻗـﻮلqwl/ ‘to speak’ (basic
verb form   َﻗﺎ َلqa¯la ‘he spoke’, imperfect   َﻳـ ُﻘـﻮ ُلyaqu¯ lu ‘he speaks’),
verbal noun   َﻗـ ْﻮ ٌلqawlun ‘speech’.
18.3
Some grammarians call the radicals simply letters, but the term
radical is more appropriate, because letters refer to units of writing,
whereas radicals refer to more theoretical units, which may sometimes
be dropped or transformed in the actual verb forms and derivations (see
chapters 31–33 on weak radicals). Roots with three radicals are called
triliteral. There are no roots with fewer than three radicals. Some roots
have four radicals. They are called quadriliteral. This type of verb will
be dealt with in chapter 29.

18.4
The derived verb forms are called  , َأ ْﻟـ َﻤـ ِﺰﻳ ُﺪal-mazı¯du, which
means ‘increased’ or ‘added’. They are formed from the root by means
of consonant doubling, preﬁxes or inﬁxes, according to certain patterns
(mentioned below, and in table A1.1, the ten forms of   َﻓ َﻌ َﻞfaala, in
Appendix 1).
18.5
The meanings of the derived verb forms are generally derived
from the basic verb form according to a system explained below. As a
rule, grammarians prefer to call the derived verb forms derived verb
stems, because each derived verb form has a complete set of conjugated
forms (tenses, verbal noun, participles, etc.). (See table A1.1 faala in
Appendix 1.)
18.6
There are 14 derived verb forms (stems). Western Arabists
traditionally number these forms with Roman numerals starting from
the basic form, which is numbered as I, and the derived verb forms as II,
III, IV, etc. Forms I to X are the most frequent and only these will be
explained in this book.
18.7
There is no verb which is used in all ten forms; normally the verb
is used in ﬁve or six of the derived forms, and sometimes even the basic
verb form itself is not used. For example, the verb form I   َﻋ ِﻠ َﻢalima ‘to
know’ occurs in forms II, IV, V, and X, but another verb might occur
only in forms III, VI, X, and so on.
18.8
As mentioned in chapter 14, there is no inﬁnitive in Arabic in
the same sense as in Indo-European languages. The derived verb forms
are listed in the dictionary under the root, which is mostly the same as
the basic verb form (I) without vowels.
18.9
It is crucially important to learn by heart these ten verb forms
and their derivations from table A1.1 of the verb   َﻓـ َﻌ َﻞfaala in Appen-
dix 1; otherwise it is almost impossible to ﬁnd a word in a dictionary.
18.10
Arab grammarians chose the basic verb /  َﻓـ َﻌ َﻞfl/ faala ‘to do,
to act’ as a pattern or model for describing other verb forms and nouns
which are derived from it.
18.11
Although the vowelling of the middle consonant (radical) of
the basic verb form (I) in the perfect tense varies:   َﻛ َﺘ َﺐkataba ‘to write’,
116
Derived
verb forms,
transitive
and
intransitive
verbs

َﺷـ ِﺮ َب
 sˇariba ‘to drink’ or   َﻛ ُﺒ َﺮkabura ‘to grow up’, the vowelling of the
derived verb forms remains the same for all verbs.
18.12
Transitive and intransitive verbs
A transitive verb is called   ُﻣ َﺘ َﻌ ًّﺪmutaaddin, and an intransitive verb
  َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮ  ُﻣ َﺘ َﻌ ًّﺪg˙ayru mutaaddin or   َﻻ ِز ٌمla¯zimun. Transitive verbs can take
a direct object in the accusative case, whereas intransitive cannot do so
(some of them can, however, take an accusative predicative comple-
ment). The basic verb form may be transitive or intransitive, depending
on its meaning and construction. Some derived verb forms are typically
transitive, while others are generally intransitive, but there are no
absolute rules for determining their meaning.
In the following examples, the basic form (I) is transitive and the corres-
ponding form VII is intransitive.
18.13
In addition to the nouns mentioned in chapter 9, with the
initial hamzatu l-qat˙
i /  ِإi/ or /  ُأu/, the verb forms VII–X (perfect,
imperative and verbal noun) also follow the rule of hamzatu
l-was˙li (was˙lah). However, the verb form IV follows the rule of hamzatu
l-qat˙
i.
18.14
Formation of the ten verb forms I–X
The table presents the ten verb forms I–X in the perfect and the
imperfect (third person sing. masc.), as exempliﬁed by the verb َﻓ َﻌ َﻞ
faala ‘to do, to act’.

The meanings of the ten verb forms I–X
The basic meanings of the ten verb forms I–X are outlined below with
some examples. Observe that many derived verb forms can have
several different meanings and that some verbs have quite idiomatic or
specialized meanings in some of their derived verb forms. Therefore it
is recommended that the student learn the speciﬁc meaning of each
derived verb form of each verb separately, rather than relying upon the
general rules given below.

Chapter 19
Passive verbs
19.1
The passive verb,  , َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ ا ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﺠ ُﻬﻮ ُلis used in Arabic when the
performer of the action is not named.
The active verb,  , َأ ْﻟـ ِﻔـ ْﻌ ُﻞ  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻌ ُﻠﻮ ُمis used in Arabic when the performer of
the action is named and expressed as the grammatical subject. So far we
have only dealt with active verb forms in the perfect and imperfect tense.
The passive forms of the perfect and imperfect tenses differ from their
active counterparts by having different vocalization. A characteristic
sign of all passive tense forms is that they have the vowel d˙ ammah /u/ on
the ﬁrst radical.
The passive of the perfect tense has only one pattern of vowelling for
all verbs and forms (stems I–X). The ﬁrst radical has d˙ ammah /u/ (as
mentioned) and the second radical has kasrah /i/. The pattern of the
passive perfect in the third person masculine singular is thus:   ُﻓ ِﻌ َﻞfuila,
e.g.
19.2
The passive of the basic form (I) of the verb in the imperfect tense
has also only one pattern of vowelling for all verbs. The ﬁrst radical still

commonly kasrah, e.g.   ِإ ْﻧ ُﺘ ِﺨ َﺐand . ِإ ْﺳ ُﺘ ْﻘ ِﺒ َﻞ
See the conjugations of the derived verb forms in Appendix 2.

Passive
verbs

19.4
 The derived verb forms V, VI and VII have no passive because
their active forms often have a passive or intransitive meaning, e.g.
Form V   َﺗ َﻐ َّﻴ َﺮtag˙ayyara, to be changed (he/it changed)
Form VI   َﺗ َﺒﺎ َر َكtaba¯raka, to be blessed (he/it got blessed)
Form VII   ِإ ْﻧ َﻜ َﺴ َﺮinkasara, to be broken (he/it broke)
19.5
The grammatical subject of the passive verb is called in Arabic
grammar  , َﻧﺎ ِﺋ ُﺐ  ْﻟ َﻔﺎ ِﻋ ِﻞwhich means ‘the deputy of the doer’. Like any
subject, it takes the ending of the nominative case and the verb agrees
with it in person, gender and number. But logically it represents the
object (or goal) of the action; compare in English: ‘I (subject) saw him
(object)’ ⇒ ‘He (subject) was seen [by me (agent)].’ Arabic passive
sentences are considered to be impersonal, because they do not express
the performer of the action.
19.6
When the performer of the action is mentioned, one cannot use
a passive verb in traditional Arabic. This means that the English
sentence ‘The book was written by the teacher’ should in Arabic be
rendered by an active sentence, where the performer (semantic agent) is
expressed by the grammatical subject: ‘The teacher wrote the book’:
  َﻛـ َﺘـ َﺐ  ْﻟـ ُﻤـ َﻌـ َّﻠـ ُﻢ  ْﻟـ ِﻜـ َﺘـﺎ َبkataba l-muallimu l-kita¯ba.
19.7
In modern literary Arabic, it is, however, increasingly common
to use certain compound prepositions to express the semantic agent in
passive sentences, in the same way as in many European languages. The

Chapter 20
Rules for writing the hamzah
(hamzatu l-qat˙
i)
20.1
With regard to the discussion in chapter 7 of the hamzah and the
difﬁculties with its orthography, the following rules can contribute to
the student’s understanding of the biggest part of this problem.
It is not necessary to learn all these rules by heart now. The idea is to
become acquainted with them, and to use them for reference.
20.2
As mentioned in chapter 7, the hamzah can be written on any
of the three letters alif  ,أwa¯w  ؤand ya¯  ﺋـ .. .. ـﺌـ.. ئwithout dots.
When they have the hamzah, these three letters are not pronounced as
vowels, but function merely as bearers (seats) of the hamzah. In some
cases the hamzah is left without a bearer, however.
It is important to remember that each of these three letters is related to
one of the three vowels as follows:
(a)
The related letter of fath˙ ah / ـ َـــa/ is alif .ا
(b)
The related letter of d˙ ammah / ــ ُــu/ is wa¯w .و
(c)
The related letter of kasrah / ـ ِـــi/ is ya¯ ( ىwithout dots).
The three vowels have different strengths, as explained in the list below.
The letter bearing the hamzah in a word is decided by the relative
strength of the vowels, when one compares the vowel of the hamzah
itself and the vowel of the preceding letter. The stronger vowel (usually)
decides which related letter becomes the bearer of the hamzah.
(a)
The strongest vowel is kasrah / ـ ِـــi/. (The ya¯ with the suku¯n
يْ
/  ْﻳـ.. ..ـ ْﻴـ..y/ is considered to be as strong as the kasrah.)

(b)
The second strongest vowel is d˙ ammah / ــ ُــu/.
(c)
The weakest vowel is fath˙ ah / ـ َـــa/.
(d)
The suku¯n  ـ ْـــis not a vowel and has no related letter. It is con-
sidered as the weakest of all, except when it is written with ya¯, as
mentioned above.
Note: Hamzah at the beginning of a word has already been discussed in
chapter 7.
20.3
Hamzah in the middle of a word
When the hamzah appears with a suku¯n in the middle of a word, the
bearer of the hamzah is the related letter of the preceding vowel,
e.g.
(The bearer of the hamzah is the related letter of the preceding vowel,
because the preceding vowel is stronger than its own suku¯n.)
20.4
When the hamzah appears with a vowel of its own after a suku¯n
in the middle of a word, the bearer of the hamzah is the related letter of
its own vowel, e.g.
(The bearer of the hamzah is the related letter of its own vowel, because
its own vowel is stronger than the preceding suku¯n.)
20.5
When the hamzah appears with a vowel of its own after another
vowel in the middle of a word, the bearer of the hamzah is the related
letter of the stronger one of these two vowels, e.g.
سٌ
َﺑ ْﺄ
سٌ
ُﺑ ْﺆ
ﺲٌ
ِﺑ ْﺌ
basun, harm
busun, misery
bisun, misfortune
َﻳ ْﺴ َﺄ ُل
َﻣ ْﺴ ُﺆو ٌل
َأ ْﺳ ِﺌ َﻠ ٌﺔ
yasalu, he asks
masu¯lun, responsible
asilatun, questions
(a)ُﺳ ِﺌ َﻞ
 suila, he was asked  ِﻣ َﺌ ٌﺔmiatun, hundred
(The kasrah of the hamzah is
(The preceding kasrah is 
stronger than the preceding
d˙ammah.)
stronger than the fath˙ah of the
hamzah.)
136

hamzah
(hamzatu

i)

20.6
When the hamzah appears with a vowel of its own after ya¯ with
suku¯n ....../ ...ـ ْﻴـy.../, the bearer of the hamzah is ya¯ without dots
... ,...ـﺌـe.g.
(The preceding ya¯ with suku¯n ... ...ـ ْﻴـis stronger than the fath˙ ah of
the hamzah and therefore the bearer of the hamzah is .../ ...ـ َﺌـy/
without dots.)

Hamzah at the end of a word (or word stem)
When hamzah with a vowel occurs at the end of a word (or word
stem) after a vowel, the bearer of the hamzah is the related letter of the
preceding vowel, regardless of the vowel of the hamzah, e.g.
(a)  َﺑ َﺪ َأbadaa, he started (alif  اis the related letter of the preceding
vowel /a/)
(b)  َﺟ ُﺮ َؤg˘arua, he dared (wa¯w  وis the related letter of the preceding
vowel /u/)
(c)  ُﻗ ِﺮ َئquria, it was read (ya¯  ىis the related letter of the preceding
vowel /i/)
Note: If a word ending in hamzah has the accusative ending with nunation
/...an/, an extra ﬁnal alif  اis added (as in the above example:   َﺗـ َﻨـ ُّﺒـ ًﺆاtanabbuan
‘prophecy’), except when the bearer of the hamzah itself is alif ( اowing to a
preceding fath˙ ah or alif), e.g.   َﻧ َﺒ ًﺄnabaan (not:   َﻣ َﺴﺎ ًء ,) َﻧ َﺒ ًﺄاmasa¯an ‘evening’

will be two alternatives for writing the hamzah:

(b)
The bearer of the hamzah is decided by its own vowel, inasmuch
as it is considered as being in the middle of a word preceded by a
suku¯n, and the sufﬁx pronoun is considered to be a part of the
word, e.g.
20.14
If a preﬁx (or preﬁxed conjunction or preposition) is attached
to a word beginning with hamzah, the preﬁx will not interfere with the
spelling of the hamzah, e.g.
(An exception is   ِﻟ َﺌ َّﻼli-alla¯ ‘in order not to’.)
20.15
In contradiction to the above rules, some exceptional variations
can be found in the writing of well-known authors, even in common
words, e.g.

Chapter 21
Broken plurals and
collective nouns
21.1
A very large number of nouns and adjectives have a plural called
the broken plural,  . َﺟ ْﻤ ُﻊ ﻟـ َّﺘ ْﻜ ِﺴﻴ ِﺮIt may be compared to the English
irregular plural, e.g., ‘man – men’, ‘mouse – mice’, ‘foot – feet’, etc.
Broken plurals are formed from the singular by internal changes and/or
speciﬁc increments according to some thirty different patterns. There
are hardly any rules about how to form the broken plural from the
singular. The broken plural occurs more frequently than the sound
plural (regular plural).
Some singular nouns may have more than one form of the broken
plural, and some may have both a sound plural and a broken plural.
21.2
The list below contains some of the most common patterns of
the broken plural.

21.3
Agreement of adjectives with plural nouns
(a)
Broken plurals referring to masculine or feminine human beings
may take the adjective both in the broken plural and sound plural,
e.g.
(b)
Even sound plurals referring to masculine human beings may take
the adjective in both broken plural and sound plural, e.g.
(c)
Broken plurals or sound plurals referring to non-human beings
take the adjective in the feminine singular, e.g.

21.4
Collective nouns,  , ِإ ْﺳ ُﻢ  ْﻟـ َﺠ ْﻤ ِﻊindicate a gathering in one unit
or group, and they can refer to both humans and non-humans. They
may form either the sound or the broken plural or sometimes both.

21.5
Agreement of verbs and adjectives with collective nouns
Collective nouns,  ,  ِإ ْﺳ ُﻢ  ْﻟـ َﺠ ْﻤ ِﻊreferring either to humans or non-

Chapter 22
Triptotes and diptotes
22.1
Nouns, adjectives and proper names are classiﬁed according to
their inﬂection into two major inﬂectional types: triptotes and diptotes.
(a)
Triptotes
All deﬁnite as well as most other nouns and adjectives and some
proper names are triptotes. This means that they take all three
different vocalic case endings (-u, -a, -i) and nunation (-un, -an,
-in) in the indeﬁnite form (see chapters 5 and 8). In Arabic a
triptotic noun or adjective is called َﺼ ِﺮ ُف
 , َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤ ْﻨi.e. fully declined.
(b)
Diptotes
Certain indeﬁnite nouns and adjectives as well as many proper
nouns are called diptotes. They have only two vocalic case
endings: -u for the nominative, and -a for the accusative and
genitive jointly. Another important feature is that they do not
take nunation (-un, -an, -in). Diptotes are therefore called in
Arabic َﺼ ِﺮ ِف
  َﻏـ ْﻴ ُﺮ  ْﻟـ ُﻤ ْﻨor َّﺼ ْﺮ ِف
 , َأ ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻤ ُﻨﻮ ُع  ِﻣ َﻦ ﻟi.e. not fully
declined.
22.2
 When a diptote is made deﬁnite by the deﬁnite article .. , َأ ْﻟـa
sufﬁx possessive pronoun, or by being the ﬁrst noun (َﻀﺎ ُف
  َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤal-
mud˙ a¯fu) of an id˙ a¯fah construction, it takes the usual three case
endings, i.e. it becomes a triptote, e.g.
Diptote indeﬁnite
Nominative: one d˙ammah/ ـ ُـــ-u/
Accusative and genitive: one fath˙ah/ ـ َـــ-a/

The most common classes of diptotes are:

Triptotes
and
diptotes

Note: Even masculine proper names ending in   ُة .. َـ ُﺔ
ِ
.../ ...atu/ are
diptotes, e.g.
(b)
Feminine proper names containing three consonants and suku¯n ـ ْـــ
on the middle consonant are treated either as triptotes or diptotes,
e.g.
Note: Most commonly in modern Arabic, ْﺼ ُﺮ
  ِﻣmis˙ru is used as a diptote
and   ِﻫ ْﻨ ٌﺪhindun as a triptote.
(c)
Masculine proper names which contain more than three con-
sonants, e.g.
(d)
All geographical names which do not have the deﬁnite article .., َأ ْﻟـ
e.g.
Note: The name of Cairo has the deﬁnite article ../ َأ ْﻟـal../. It is there-
fore a triptote and takes all three cases endings: .. َأ ْﻟ َﻘﺎ ِﻫ َﺮ ُة  َأ ْﻟ َﻘﺎ ِﻫ َﺮ َة  َأ ْﻟ َﻘﺎ ِﻫ َﺮ ِة
(e)
Compound geographical names:
(f)
Masculine and feminine proper names which simulate verbal
forms and do not have the ending   ُة .. َـ ُﺔ

Triptotes
and
diptotes

Note: The noun below has the same structure as the proper names above,
but it is not a diptote, because its feminine singular is formed by adding
the ending .../ . َ.ـ ٌﺔ .. َ. ٌةatun/ e.g.
(g)
Masculine proper names ending in .../ ... َـﺎ ُنa¯nu/, e.g.
(h)
Proper names (masculine and feminine) which have the pattern of
  ُﻓ َﻌ ُﻞfualu, e.g.
22.4
Adjectives
(a)
Most of the classical grammarians consider the masculine adjec-
tives ending in .../ . َ.ﺎ ُنa¯nu/ (pattern:   َﻓـ ْﻌـ َﻼ ُنfala¯nu) and having
the feminine ending .../ . َ.ﻰa¯/ (pattern:   َﻓـ ْﻌـ َﻠﻰfala¯) to be diptotes,
but some other grammarians consider the feminine ending
of the above .../ . َ.ﺎ ُنa¯nu/ to be .../ . َ.ـ ٌﺔatun/ (pattern: َﻓـ ْﻌـ َﻼ َﻧ ٌﺔ
fala¯natun, not   َﻓـ ْﻌـ َﻠﻰfala¯). In this case they have to be triptotes
(as pattern:   َﻓـ ْﻌـ َﻼ ٌنfala¯nun), according to the rule mentioned
in note (b) below, and this type of feminine is more frequently used
in modern Arabic, e.g.

Triptotes
and
diptotes

Note a: When the above adjectives occur as proper names then they are
treated as diptotes, following rule 3 (g) above, e.g. ْﻀ َﺒﺎ ُن
  َﻏg˙ad˙ ba¯nu (as
proper name).
Note b: The adjective below is not a diptote, because its feminine singular
does not end in .../ .. َـﻰa¯/ (pattern:   َﻓ ْﻌ َﻠﻰfala¯):
Note c: Adjectives of the pattern   ُﻓ ْﻌ َﻼ ٌنfula¯nun are all triptotes, e.g.
(b)
Masculine adjectives of the pattern   َأ ْﻓ َﻌ ُﻞafalu, e.g.
(c)
Nouns and adjectives ending in .../ ..ـ َـﺎ ُءa¯u/ which is not part of
the verb root, e.g.
Note a: The triptote nouns ending in .../ ..ـ َـﺎ ٌءa¯un/ below do not belong
to the above group, because they are derived from verbs ending in a weak
radical (chapter 33), e.g.
  َﻋ ْﻄ َﺸﺎ ُنOR   َﻋ ْﻄ َﺸﺎ ٌنat˙sˇa¯nu/

Note b: The word   َأ ْﺷ َﻴﺎ ُءasˇya¯u ‘things’ (sing. َﺷ ْﻲ ٌء

Chapter 23
Participles, verbal nouns
(mas˙dar), nouns of place,
time and instrument
23.1
Active participle
The active participle,  , ِإ ْﺳ ُﻢ  ْﻟ َﻔﺎ ِﻋ ِﻞis a deverbal adjective or noun indicating
the doer of an action or doing the action. The pattern of the active
participle of the triliteral verb (form I) is (  َﻓﺎ ِﻋ ٌﻞfem.  ,) َﻓﺎ ِﻋ َﻠـ ٌﺔfrom the verb
 , َﻓ َﻌ َﻞe.g.
  َﻛﺎ ِﺗ ٌﺐka¯tibun, one who writes, writer, clerk (from the verb   َﻛ َﺘ َﺐkataba,
to write)
  َﻗﺎ ِﺗ ٌﻞqa¯tilun, one who kills, killer, murderer (from the verb   َﻗ َﺘ َﻞqatala, to
kill)
23.2
Some active participles are often used to indicate an on-going,
simultaneous or imminent action or state, having a meaning close to the
verb in the imperfect tense. They may then correspond to the English
present participle, progressive present or future, e.g.
Hence it is sometimes difﬁcult to know whether to use the active
participle or the imperfect tense. It is a question of practice, e.g.
(  ُﻣ َﺴﺎ ِﻓ ٌﺮIII) travelling, going to travelٌﺲ
  َﺟﺎ ِﻟـsitting  َذا ِﻫ ٌﺐgoing
Active participle
Imperfect verb
َأ َﻧﺎ  ُﻣ َﺴﺎ ِﻓ ٌﺮ  َﻏ ًﺪا
ُأ َﺳﺎ ِﻓ ُﺮ  َﻏ ًﺪا
ana¯ musa¯ﬁrun g˙adan.
usa¯ﬁru g˙adan.
I am travelling tomorrow.
I will travel tomorrow.

Note: The above words   َﻏ ًﺪاand َﺿﺎ ِﺣ ًﻜﺎ
 are in the accusative case, because they
function as adverbs (see chapter 38).
23.3
In the case of a habitual action or something which happens
regularly, the imperfect tense should replace the active participle as
follows:
23.4
Passive participle
The passive participle,  ,  ِإ ْﺳ ُﻢ  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻔ ُﻌﻮ ِلis a deverbal adjective or noun
which indicates (the result or effect of) a completed action. In English
it corresponds to the past participle. The passive participle of the tri-
literal verb (form I) is formed according to the pattern of َﻣـ ْﻔ ُﻌﻮ ٌل
mafu¯ lun, e.g.

  َﻗ ْﺘ ٌﻞqatlun, ‘killing, murder’ is derived from the verb   َﻗ َﺘ َﻞqatala,
‘to kill’; similarly,   ُﺣ ْﺴ ٌﻦh˙ usnun ‘beauty’, is derived from َﺣ ُﺴ َﻦ
h˙ asuna ‘to be handsome’. The Arabic verbal noun corresponds
to the English gerund ending in ‘-ing’ (e.g. ‘playing, going’), or to
action nouns like ‘departure’, ‘arrival’, ‘treatment’, etc.
The patterns for forming verbal nouns from the different verb
forms (I–X) are given below:
(See also table A1.1 (faala) in Appendix 1.)
Note a: The verbal nouns of forms IV–X have only one pattern, but forms
II and III may have two.
Note b: The initial hamzatu l-qat˙
i   ِإand   ُأin the verbal nouns of verb
forms VII–X is subject to the rule of hamzatu l-was˙li (was˙lah), in the same
way as the corresponding hamzah in the perfect and imperative forms.

Chapter 24
Interrogative particles and
pronouns, vocative particles
24.1
Interrogative particles ُﺣ ُﺮو ُف  ِْﻻ ْﺳ ِﺘ ْﻔ َﻬﺎ ِم
(a)
A sentence is made interrogative by introducing it with the inter-
rogative particle   َﻫ ْﻞhal, or by preﬁxing the ﬁrst word of the
sentence with the interrogative particle ..  َأa.
(b)
The particle   َأcannot be used before a word having the deﬁnite
article .. . َأ ْﻟـIt can, however, be joined to another word which
begins with ... , َأe.g.
Remember:   َﻫ ْﻞbecomes   َﻫ ِﻞbefore hamzatu l-was˙li (was˙lah). This
form is used to avoid three consecutive consonants, e.g.
َﻫ ِﻞ  ْﻟ َﻮ َﻟ ُﺪ  ِﻓﻲ  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﺪ َر َﺳ ِﺔ؟
hali l-waladu fı- l-madrasati? Is the boy at school?
24.2
Interrogative pronouns َﺿ َﻤﺎ ِﺋ ُﺮ  ِْﻻ ْﺳ ِﺘ ْﻔ َﻬﺎ ِم
In addition to the above interrogative particles, there are several inter-
rogative pronouns, the following being the most common:
َﻫ ْﻞ  َﻓ َﺘ ْﺤ َﺖ ﻟ ُّﺸـ َّﺒﺎ َك؟ORَأ َﻓ َﺘ ْﺤ َﺖ ﻟ ُّﺸـ َّﺒﺎ َك؟
hal fatah˙ta sˇ-sˇubba¯ka?
a-fatah˙ta sˇ-sˇubba¯ka?
Did you open the window?
َﻫ ْﻞ  َأ ْﻧ َﺖ  َﺗﺎ ِﺟ ٌﺮ؟ORَأ َأ ْﻧ َﺖ  َﺗﺎ ِﺟ ٌﺮ؟
hal anta ta¯g˘irun? Are you a merchant?
a-anta ta¯g˘irun?

(a)  َﻣ ْﻦ؟man, ‘who? whom? whose?’
This pronoun may occur as subject, object or in any other nominal
function in the sentence. In a nominal sentence   َﻣ ْﻦis placed before
or after a pronominal subject. In an id˙ a¯fah construction it is, of
course, placed after the ﬁrst noun, e.g.
Note: Like the following interrogative pronoun   َﻣﺎ؟ma¯ ‘what?’, َﻣ ْﻦ
is indeclinable, i.e. it has the same form for all genders, numbers and
cases.
(b)
When the preﬁxed preposition ...  ِﻟـprecedes  , َﻣ ْﻦit has the
meaning ‘whose?’, ‘for/to whom?’, e.g.
  ِﻟـ َﻤ ِﻦ  ْﻟ َﺒ ْﻴ ُﺖli-mani l-baytu? Whose house is it? (lit. For whom is the
house?)
Note: In the above sentence   َﻣ ْﻦgets the kasrah and becomes  , َﻣ ِﻦbecause
it is followed by hamzatu al-was˙li (was˙lah).
(c)  َﻣﺎ؟ma¯ ‘what?’ may be preceded by the preposition   ِﻟـand is then
written as   ِﻟ َﻢ؟
)
...ـ َﻤﺎ+.. ,) ِﻟـmeaning ‘why? for what?’.
(d)
The above-mentioned pronoun has a longer synonym َﻣﺎ َذا؟
ma¯d¯a¯ ‘what?’. It can also be preceded by the bound preposition
... , ِﻟـgiving:   ِﻟـ َﻤﺎ َذا؟
)
...ـ َﻤﺎ َذا+.. ,) ِﻟـwhich means ‘why? for
what?’.
(e)  َأ ٌّيayyun, masc.,   َأ َّﻳ ٌﺔayyatun, fem., are adjectival interrogative
pronouns meaning ‘which...?, what...?’. They precede the noun
they qualify, which is always in the indeﬁnite singular genitive,
e.g.
Masc:  َأ ُّي  ُﻣ َﻌ َّﻠ ٍﻢ؟ayyu muallimin, which/what teacher?
Fem:  َأ َّﻳ ُﺔ  ُﻣ َﻌ َّﻠ َﻤ ٍﺔ؟ayyatu muallimatin, which/what teacher?
Note:   َأ ٌّيand   َأ َّﻳ ٌﺔcan also be used as (adjectival) indeﬁnite pronouns in
the meaning ‘any’, e.g.
ُﻫ َﻮ َﻣ ْﻦ؟huwa man?  َﻣ ْﻦ  ُﻫ َﻮ؟man huwa?  َﺑ ْﻴ ُﺖ  َﻣ ْﻦ؟baytu man?
Who is he?
Who is he?
whose house?

24.3
Vocative particles ُﺣ ُﺮو ُف ﻟ َّﻨ َﺪا ِء
(a)
The vocative particles are   َﻳﺎya¯ for both genders,   َأ ُّﻳ َﻬـﺎayyuha¯ for
the masculine, and   َأ َّﻳـ ُﺘ َﻬـﺎayyatuha¯ for the feminine. They can
be rendered as ‘O(h)...!’, ‘Hey (you)...!’, ‘I say...!’ Often they need
not be translated at all, the ﬁnal exclamation mark after the noun
or sentence being sufﬁcient.
(b)‘  َﻳﺎO...!’ is followed by a noun (in any number) or proper name
in the nominative case without the deﬁnite article or nunation,
e.g.
(c)
In complex titles and compound names, the noun after the
vocative particle is followed by another noun and this last noun
must be in the genitive case. However, the noun after the vocative
particle must be in the accusative instead of the nominative case,
e.g.
  َﻳﺎ  َر ُّبya¯ rabbu! O Lord!ّﻠ ُﻪ
ا
  َﻳﺎ  َأﻟـya¯ alla¯hu! O God!
  َﻳﺎ  َر ُﺟ ُﻞya¯ rag˘ulu! O man!  َﻳﺎ  ِر َﺟﺎ ُلya¯ rig˘a¯lu! O men!

ا
  َﻳﺎ  َﻋ ْﺒ َﺪ ﻟya¯ abda-lla¯hi! (O) Abdullah!
(d)
The vocative particles   َأ ُّﻳ َﻬـﺎayyuha¯, masc., and   َأ َّﻳـ ُﺘ َﻬـﺎayyatuha¯,
fem., are also used for all numbers. As usual, the following noun is
in the nominative case, but it takes the deﬁnite article ... .أﻟـThese
longer vocative particles are often used at the beginning of a
speech or by the announcers of radio and television programmes.
They may be preceded by the shorter vocative particle  ,  َﻳﺎe.g.
َأ ُّﻳ َﻬﺎ /  َﻳﺎ  َأ ُّﻳ َﻬﺎ  ْﻟـ ُﻤ َﻌ َّﻠ ُﻢ
ayyuha¯ OR ya¯ ayyuha¯ l-muallimu! O teacher!
َأ ُّﻳ َﻬﺎ /  َﻳـﺎ  َأ ُّﻳ َﻬـﺎ  ْﻟـ ُﻤ َﻌـ َّﻠ ُﻤﻮ َن
ayyuha¯ OR ya¯ ayyuha¯ l-muallimu¯na! O teachers!
َأ َّﻳـ ُﺘ َﻬﺎ /  َﻳـﺎ  َأ َّﻳـ ُﺘ َﻬﺎ  ْﻟـ ُﻤ َﻌ َّﻠـ َﻤ ُﺔ
ayyatuha¯ OR ya¯ ayyatuha¯ l-muallimatu! O teacher! (fem.)
َأ َّﻳـ ُﺘ َﻬﺎ /  َﻳﺎ  َأ َّﻳـ ُﺘ َﻬﺎ  ْﻟـ ُﻤ َﻌﻠ َّـ َﻤﺎ ُت
ayyatuha¯ OR ya¯ ayyatuha¯ l-muallima¯tu! O teachers! (fem.)

ayyuha¯ s-sayyida¯tu wa-s-sa¯datu! Ladies and gentlemen!
Note: In the last mentioned phrase the masculine vocative particle َأ ُّﻳ َﻬـﺎ
is used, because in phrases with mixed gender, the masculine determines
agreement.

Negation with   َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮg˙ayru
(a)
The noun   َﻏ ْﻴ ٌﺮg˙ayrun, ‘other (than)’, can be used before an
indeﬁnite adjective or noun in the genitive case to express negation
or contradiction. It is thus translated as ‘not..., non-, un-, in-, dis-’,
172
Interroga-
tive
particles
and
pronouns,
vocative
particles

etc. Note that   َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮthen appears without article or nunation (i.e. in
the form called construct state), e.g.
  َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮ  َﻗﺎ ِد ٍرg˙ayru qa¯dirin, unable (other than able)
  َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮ  ُﻣ ِﻬ ًّﻢg˙ayru muhimmin, unimportant

  َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮ  َﻋ َﺮ ِﺑ ًّﻲg˙ayru arabiyyin, not an Arab, non-Arab
  َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮ  َﻣ ْﻮ ُﺟﻮ ٍدg˙ayru mawg˘u¯din, unavailable, not present, absent, non-
existent
(b)
When   َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮg˙ayru has a sufﬁxed pronoun, it means ‘other(s) (than)’,
e.g.
(c)
When   َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮis preceded by a negative predicate or negative particle
like  , َﻻit is translated as ‘only’, e.g.
ﻫ َﺬا  َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮ  ْﻟـ ُﻤ ِﺪﻳ ِﺮ
  َﻻ  َﻳ ْﻌ َﻠ ُﻢ  اla¯ yalamu ha¯d¯a¯ g˙ayru l-mudı-ri.

the director).
  َأ ْﻟ ُﻒ  ِدﻳ َﻨﺎ ٍر  َﻻ  َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮalfu dı-na¯rin la¯ g˙ayru, only a thousand dinars
(d)
When   َﻏ ْﻴ ٌﺮprecedes  , َأ َّنas in  , َﻏ ْﻴ َﺮ  َأ َّنit means ‘except that, neverthe-
less, however, but’.
24.5
Negation with   َﻋ َﺪ ُمadamu
The noun   َﻋ َﺪ ٌمadamun ‘non-being, lack, absence’ or the adjective
  َﻋ ِﺪﻳ ٌمadı¯mun ‘lacking’, can be followed by a noun in the genitive,
meaning ‘non-, in-, un-, dis-, -less, lack of...’, etc. The noun   َﻋ َﺪ ٌمappears
without article or nunation, e.g.
َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤ ِﺪﻳ ُﺮ  َو َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮ ُه
al-mudı-ru wa-g˙ayru-hu
the director (masc.) and others (than him)
َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤ ِﺪﻳ َﺮ ُة  َو َﻏ ْﻴ ُﺮ َﻫﺎ

  َﻋ َﺪ ُم  ُﺣadamu h˙ud˙u¯ri ah˙adin, without anyone being present
24.6
Negation of nominal sentences with   َﻻla¯
The negative particles ‘  َﻻno, not’ and ‘  َو َﻻneither, nor’ have already
been discussed as negative particles for the verb of the imperfect tense.
The negative particle   َﻻcan also be placed before a noun that functions
as the subject of a nominal sentence. The noun must be in the accusative
case without article or nunation. The negative particle functions then
as an existential or locative negative copula: ‘There is no X’ OR ‘X is not
(there)’, e.g.
  َﻻ  َأ َﺣ َﺪ  ِﻓﻲ  ْﻟ َﺒ ْﻴ ِﺖla¯ ah˙ada fı- l-bayti. (There is) no one (nobody) at home.
  َﻻ  َﺳ َﻼ َم  َو َﻻ  َﺣ ْﺮ َبla¯ sala¯ma wa-la¯ h˙arba. (There is) neither peace nor war.
24.7  ُﻛـ ٌّﻞkullun
The noun   ُﻛـ ٌّﻞkullun means basically ‘totality, entirety, whole, all,
everything’. It is fully declined (inﬂected for all cases) and can be
employed as a universal indeﬁnite pronoun modifying a following noun,
or standing alone. The following are its uses:
(a)
When   ُﻛ ٌّﻞwithout an article or nunation is followed by an
indeﬁnite noun in the genitive singular, it means ‘each, every’, e.g.
  ُﻛـ ُّﻞ  َﻃـﺎ ِﻟ ٍﺐkullu t˙a¯libin, each student
  ُﻛـ ُّﻞ  َﻳ ْﻮ ٍمkullu yawmin, every day
(b)
When   ُﻛ ٌّﻞwithout an article or nunation is followed by a deﬁnite
noun in the genitive singular, it means ‘all, the whole’, e.g.

  ُﻛـ ُّﻞ  ْﻟـ َﻴ ْﻮ ِمkullu l-yawmi, the whole day, all day long
  ُﻛـ ُّﻞ  ْﻟـ َﻮ ْﻗ ِﺖkullu l-waqti, the whole time, all the time
(c)
When   ُﻛ ٌّﻞwithout an article or nunation is followed by a deﬁnite
noun in the genitive plural, it means ‘all’, e.g.
  ُﻛـ ُّﻞ  ْﻟـ َﺤ َﻴ َﻮا َﻧﺎ ِتkullu l-h˙ayawa¯na¯ti, all the animals
  ُﻛـ ُّﻞ ا ْﻟ ُﺒ ُﻴﻮ ِتkullu l-buyu¯ti, all the houses
(d)
When   ُﻛ ٌّﻞis indeﬁnite (having nunation) and followed by the
preposition   ِﻣ ْﻦmin ‘from’, i.e.  , ُﻛـ ٌّﻞ  ِﻣ ْﻦit has the meaning ‘each
(one) of (a group)’, e.g.
  ُﻛـ ٌّﻞ  ِﻣ َﻦ ﻟ ُّﻄ َّﻼ ِبkullun mina t˙-t˙ulla¯bi, each (one) of the students
(e)
When the deﬁnite article ..  َأ ْﻟـis attached to   ُﻛـ ٌّﻞas  , َأ ْﻟ ُﻜ ُّﻞit becomes
an independent (pro)noun which means ‘everyone, everything, the
whole thing’, e.g.
َﺷﺎ َﻫ ْﺪ ُت  ْﻟـ ُﻜـ َّﻞ
 sˇa¯hadtu l-kulla. I saw everything (the whole thing).
24.8  ِﻛ َﻼkila¯ (masc.),   ِﻛ ْﻠ َﺘﺎkilta¯ (fem.)
These two words mean ‘both, both of them, each one of the two’. They
are used in the id˙ a¯fah construction preceding a dual noun which is
deﬁnite and in the genitive case, or preceding a dual sufﬁx pronoun.
The following predicative adjective or verb is, nevertheless, in the
singular. Both   ِﻛ َﻼkila¯ and   ِﻛ ْﻠ َﺘﺎkilta¯ are indeclinable before nouns,
but declinable before a sufﬁx pronoun.
Note:   ِﻛ َﻼkila¯ is likely to be from   ِﻛ َﻼ ِنkila¯-ni, and   ِﻛ ْﻠ َﺘﺎkilta¯ from ِﻛ ْﻠ َﺘﺎ ِن
kilta¯-ni (see chapter 13 on the elision of the ﬁnal  ...ـﻦof the dual).

Adjectives َّﺼـ َﻔـ ُﺔ
َأﻟ
There are several adjectival forms in Arabic and the following patterns
for forming adjectives from verbs are the most common:
25.2
Adjectives denoting colours or (bodily) defects are formed
according to the patterns   َأ ْﻓ َﻌ ُﻞafalu, masc. sing., and   َﻓ ْﻌ َﻼ ُءfala¯u,
fem. sing. Both of these patterns are diptotes and the corresponding
broken plural pattern (for both genders) is:   ُﻓ ْﻌ ٌﻞfulun (triptote), e.g.

Relative adjectives,   ِﻧـ ْﺴ َﺒـ ٌﺔnisbah
The relative adjective is called in Arabic   ِﻧـ ْﺴ َﺒـ ٌﺔnisbah, which means
‘relation’. Relative adjectives are derived from nouns by adding the
so-called nisbah sufﬁx, which is ../ ... ِـ ٌّﻲiyyun/ in the masculine and
.../ ... ِـ َّﻴـ ٌﺔiyyatun/ in the feminine. The nisbah sufﬁx thus makes a noun
into an adjective (which often can be employed as a noun as well),
expressing the meaning: ‘related or pertaining to (the entity or thing
denoted by the noun)’. It may be compared to English derivational mor-
phemes like ‘-ish, -(i)an, -ese, -i, -ic(al), -al, -ly,’ e.g. ‘English, American,
Egyptian, Lebanese, Iraqi, Arabic, formal, periodical, monthly’, etc. The
relative adjective often refers to geographical, national or ethnic names
or names of occupations (as in English, these kinds of derived adjectives
may often be reused as independent nouns), e.g.

Note: Plural nisbah forms often have a collective meaning, e.g. َأﻟ َّﻠ َﺴﺎ ِﻧ َّﻴﺎ ُت
al-lisa¯niyya¯tu ‘linguistics’, from the noun ‘  ِﻟ َﺴﺎ ٌنtongue, language’.
25.7
In pausal form (at the end of a sentence) the above nisbah sufﬁx
.../ ... ِـ ٌّﻲiyyun/ is pronounced as a long vowel: .../ ... ِـﻲı¯/, which does
not take nunation. In pausa the ﬁnal ta¯ marbu¯t˙ah (.../ )...ـﺔ ةt/ is
pronounced as /...h/, e.g.

The above relative adjective (nisbah) usually takes the sound
plural, e.g.
Note: The adjective   َﻋ َﺮ ِﺑ ٌّﻲarabiyyun ‘Arab, Arabic’ does not form the sound
plural, but uses the collective noun   َﻋ َﺮ ٌبarabun ‘the Arabs, Arab’ as the plural

َأ ْﻓ َﻌ ُﻞ ﻟـ َّﺘـ ْﻔ
As mentioned in 25.2, the pattern   َأ ْﻓـ َﻌ ُﻞafalu (diptote) is characteristic
of adjectives denoting colours and bodily defects. But the same pattern
is also used to form the comparative and superlative degree of adjec-
tives, and participles of the ﬁrst form in all genders and numbers. This
form of the adjective is also called the elative, e.g.
25.10
Comparative sentences
The preposition   ِﻣـ ْﻦmin ‘from’ is used like the English preposition
‘than’ as a link between the two parts (item compared and object of
comparison) of the comparative sentence. The comparative sentence
thus has the following structure: item compared + comparative (elative)
form of the adjective +   ِﻣـ ْﻦmin + object of comparison, e.g.
ْﺻـ َﻐـ ُﺮ  ِﻣـ ْﻦ  ُأ ْﺧـ ِﺘ ِﻪ
  َأ ْﻟ َﻮ َﻟـ ُﺪ  َأal-waladu as˙g˙aru min uh˘ti-hi.
The boy is younger than his sister.
  َأ ْ ُﻷ ُّم  َأ ْﺟـ َﻤـ ُﻞ  ِﻣـ ْﻦ  ِﺑـ ْﻨـ ِﺘـ َﻬـﺎal-ummu ag˘malu min binti-ha¯.
The mother is more beautiful than her daughter.
  َأ ْﻟـ َﺒـ َﻨـﺎ ُت  َأ ْﺣـ َﺴـ ُﻦ  ِﻣـ َﻦ  ْ َﻷ ْو َﻻ ِدal-bana¯tu ah˙sanu mina l-awla¯di.
(The) girls are better than (the) boys.
25.11
The pattern   َأ ْﻓـ َﻌ ُﻞafalu cannot be used to form the compara-
tive of the participles of the derived forms, nor of adjectives with more
than three consonants. In these cases, the comparative is formed by

The two nouns/adjectives   َﺧ ْﻴ ٌﺮh˘ayrun ‘good(ness)’ and َﺷ ُّﺮ
sˇarrun ‘evil’ are used as comparatives and superlatives with the
meanings ‘better’ and ‘worst’, respectively, e.g.

Superlative sentences
The superlative is formed by making the comparative pattern

The diminutive
The diminutive ْﺼ ِﻐﻴ ِﺮ
  ِإ ْﺳ ُﻢ ﻟ َّﺘcan be formed according to the pattern
  ُﻓ َﻌ ْﻴ ٌﻞfuaylun. It is restricted to certain nouns and adjectives and
indicates diminishing or reducing. As in many other languages, the
diminutive may, in addition, often be employed with a positive or
negative feeling or tone. With a positive feeling it expresses ﬂirtation,
coquetry or endearment. With a negative feeling it conveys contempt or
downgrading.
The diminutive form can be learned with practice or from the dic-
tionary. Some diminutives are common as proper names, e.g.
25.17
Some prepositions can sometimes be used in diminutive form,
e.g.
In words where the second consonant is followed by a long vowel, the
vowel changes to ...../ .. َــ َّﻴـayyi.../ in the diminutive, e.g.

Inna   ِإ َّنand its sisters,
ka¯na   َﻛـﺎ َنand its sisters
26.1  ِإ َّنinna is an assertive particle, which can be translated as
‘indeed, certainly’, or by the biblical word ‘verily, (and) lo’. Mostly it is
not, however, translated at all, as it is basically used as a matter of style
or a simple syntactic device. It is placed at the beginning of a nominal
sentence before the (logical) subject, which takes the accusative case or
is expressed by a sufﬁxed pronoun.
There are a number of other particles (and conjunctions) that are con-
strued in the same way as   ِإ َّنinna. The Arab grammarians refer to them
as ‘  ِإ َّن  َو َأ َﺧ َﻮا ُﺗ َﻬﺎinna and its sisters’. After all these particles the (logical)
subject is in the accusative case. The nominal predicate remains in the
nominative case.
The following are the particles   ِإ َّنinna and its sisters:
Note: ﻟـ ِﻜـ َّﻦ
ا
 la¯kinna is very often preﬁxed with   َوwa.   َﻟـ ْﻴـ َﺖlayta is very often
preﬁxed with   َﻳـﺎya¯.
Examples:
  ِإ َّنinna, indeed, that  َأ َّنanna, that  َﻛـ َﺄ َّنkaanna, as if
ﻟ ِﻜ َّﻦ
ا
 la¯kinna, but  َﻟ ْﻴ َﺖlayta, would, if only, wish  َﻟ َﻌ َّﻞlaalla, perhaps

inna l-mudı-ra masˇg˙u¯lun.
inna-hu masˇg˙u¯lun.
The director is (indeed) busy.
He is (indeed) busy.

26.2
After   ِإ َّنinna, the nominal predicate can be emphasized by pre-
ﬁxing .../  َﻟـla.../. (This is optional.) This particle has no inﬂuence on the
case of the predicate, e.g.
26.3  ِإ َّنinna and its sisters can also occur before the (logical) subject
in a verbal sentence, but then the subject must be in the accusative case,
e.g.
26.4  ِإ َّنinna, takes the form   َأ َّنanna ‘that’ (complementizer), when
it introduces indirect speech or a complement clause after the main
clause, e.g.
Note:   ِإ َّنinna, nevertheless, remains unchanged after the verb   َﻗﺎ َلqa¯la ‘to
say’, e.g.
26.5  َأ َّنanna can be combined with prepositions and then gets various
other meanings:

26.6
When   ِإ َّنinna or   َأ َّنanna takes a sufﬁxed pronoun in the ﬁrst
person singular or plural, there are two alternative forms:
26.7
When   ِإ َّنinna or   َأ َّنanna is not immediately followed by the
subject in a verbal sentence, it takes the sufﬁxed pronoun of the third
person masculine singular: .../ ...ـ ُﻪhu/, i.e.   ِإ َّﻧـ ُﻪinna-hu,   َأ َّﻧـ ُﻪanna-hu,
for all genders and numbers, e.g.

26.8
Ka¯na   َﻛﺎنand its sisters
There are dozens of verbs which behave like the verb   َﻛﺎ َنka¯na ‘to be’
(lit. ‘he was’), referred to as ‘  َﻛﺎ َن  َو َأ َﺧ َﻮا ُﺗ َﻬﺎka¯na and its sisters’. All these
verbs take the predicative complement in the accusative case. Hence
they are construed in the opposite way to ‘  ِإ َّنinna and its sisters’.
26.9
The following are the most common verbs known as sisters of
  َﻛﺎ َنka¯na:
ْﺻـ َﺒ َﺢ
  َأas˙bah˙a, to become (to be/become in the morning) (form IV)

Examples:
26.10
The above-mentioned verb   َزا َلza¯la (imperfect:   َﻳ َﺰا ُلyaza¯lu)
means literally ‘to cease, to disappear, to go away’. It is frequently used
as an auxiliary when preceded by the negative particle /  َﻣﺎma¯/ in the
perfect tense, or /  َﻻla¯/ in the imperfect tense. It is then translated as ‘is
still (doing)’ or ‘continues to (do)’, with the main action expressed by a
participle. Both tenses have the same meaning (see also chapter 36), e.g.

relative clauses
27.1
Relative pronoun
The basic form (masc. sing.) of the relative pronoun ُﺻﻮ ُل
َأ ِ ْﻻ ْﺳ ُﻢ  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻮ
is   َأ َّﻟـ ِﺬيallad¯ı¯ ‘(the one) who, which, that’. It is declined as follows:
Note a: For historical reasons, the masculine and feminine singular and mascu-
line plural forms are written with one la¯m ... ﻟـand the other forms with two.
There is no difference in pronunciation.
Note b: The plural forms are used only for human beings.

27.2
Deﬁnite relative clause
The role of the relative pronoun is to link the relative clause with a
deﬁnite antecedent   َأﻟ َّﺴﺎ ِﺑ ُﻖas-sa¯biqu, which precedes it. The relative
pronoun agrees with the antecedent in gender and number, e.g.
27.3
The relative pronoun is used only when the antecedent   َأﻟ َّﺴﺎ ِﺑ ُﻖis
deﬁnite. If the antecedent is indeﬁnite, the relative clause is introduced
after the antecedent without a relative pronoun, e.g.
Observe that, in contrast to Arabic, when you leave out the relative
pronoun in English, the antecedent becomes object in the relative clause,
e.g. ‘This is the man you saw.’
27.4
An active participle may replace both the relative pronoun and
the following perfect or imperfect verb, e.g.

respectively. This kind of anaphoric (back-referring) sufﬁx pronoun is
called   َأ ْﻟ َﻌﺎ ِﺋﺪal-a¯id ‘the returner’. The returner has no equivalent in
English, because in English it is possible to use a relative pronoun as
object or add a preposition or attribute to it. The following are the most
common uses of al-a¯id:
(a)
Al-a¯id attached to a verb
َأ ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﺮ َأ ُة  َّﻟ ِﺘﻲ  َﺳﺎ َﻋ ْﺪ ُﺗ َﻬﺎ

27.7
Interrogatives used as relative pronouns
(a)
The interrogative pronouns   َﻣ ْﻦman, ‘who?’ and   َﻣﺎma¯ ‘what?’ are
also used as relative pronouns in the following ways:
(  َﻣ ْﻦthe one) who, whom (with reference to human beings)
(  َﻣﺎthe thing) that, which, what (with reference to non-human beings
or things)
They differ, however, from the deﬁnite relative pronoun َأ َّﻟ ِﺬي
allad¯ı¯ in that they never take an antecedent  . َأﻟـ َّﺴـﺎ ِﺑ ُﻖThat
is to say, the antecedent is included in their meaning. Moreover,
they tend to be used with generalized or indeﬁnite reference,
e.g.

(b)
When   َﻣﺎma¯ ‘what?’ or   ِﻣ َّﻤﺎmimma¯ ‘of what?, of which?’ (which
is a combination of   ِﻣ ْﻦ+  ) َﻣﺎare used as relative pronouns, the
addition of al-a¯id ‘the returner’ is optional, e.g.

Moods
Subjunctive, jussive (apocopatus)
and imperative
28.1
We have already dealt with the verb in the indicative mood of the
imperfect tense َﻀﺎ ِر ُع  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﺮ ُﻓـﻮ ُع
 . َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤNow we will deal with the two
other moods of the imperfect, and with the imperative mood.
(a)
Imperfect subjunctive mood: ُﺼﻮ ُب
َﻀﺎ ِر ُع  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻨ
َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤ
(b)
Imperfect jussive mood: َﻀﺎ ِر ُع  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﺠ ُﺰو ُم
َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤ
(c)
Imperative mood: َأ ْ َﻷ ْﻣ ُﺮ
(See the conjugations in Appendix 2.)
28.2
The subjunctive particles and their use
The imperfect subjunctive mood is mostly used in subordinate clauses
after the subjunctive particles listed below to indicate an externally con-
ditioned or internally motivated action. The subjunctive particles are:
َأ ْن
َﻟـ ْﻦ
ِإ َذ ْن
َأ َّﻻ
ِﻟـ...
an
lan
id¯an
alla¯
li...
that, to
will not, never
then, in that case
that not, not to
in order to, to
ِﻟ َﺌ َّﻼ

َِﻷ َّن
َﺣـ َّﺘﻰ
َﺣ َّﺘﻰ  َﻻ
li-anna
h˙atta¯
h˙atta¯ la¯
because
so that, until, in order to
in order not to

Note: Except for   َﻟـ ْﻦlan, these particles are, in fact, subordinating
conjunctions.
28.3
The subjunctive mood is formed from the imperfect indicative
by changing the ﬁnal vowel /-u/ of the personal endings to /-a/ or, in
the case of personal endings having the ﬁnal syllable .../ ...ـ َﻦna/, by
dropping this syllable completely.
Examples of the subjunctive:
َﻗ ِﺒ َﻞ  َأ ْن  َﻳ ْﺬ َﻫ َﺐ  َﻏ ًﺪا
qabila an yad¯haba g˙adan.
He agreed (accepted) that he would go tomorrow.
(= He agreed to go tomorrow.)
ﺬ ِﻟ َﻚ
َأ ْﻃ ُﻠ ُﺐ  ِﻣ ْﻨ ُﻜ ْﻢ  َأ ْن  َﺗ ْﻔ َﻌ ُﻠﻮا  ا
at˙lubu min-kum an tafalu¯ d¯a¯lika. (not:   َﺗ ْﻔ َﻌ ُﻠﻮ َنtafalu¯na)
I ask you (masc. plur.) that you do that.
(= I ask you to do that.)
َﻫ ْﻞ  َد َﺧ ْﻠ ِﺖ  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻄـ َﺒ َﺦ  ِﻟ َﺘـ ْﺸ َﺮ ِﺑﻲ  َﻣﺎ ًء؟
hal dah˘alti l-mat˙bah˘a li-tasˇrabı- ma¯an? (not:   ِﻟـ َﺘ ْﺸ َﺮ ِﺑﻴ َﻦli-tasˇrabı-na)
Did you (fem. sing.) enter the kitchen to drink water?
َد َر ُﺳﻮا  َﺟ َّﻴ ًﺪا  َﻛ ْﻲ  َﻳ ْﻨ َﺠ ُﺤﻮا  ِﻓﻲ  ِْﻻ ْﻣ ِﺘ َﺤﺎ ِن
darasu¯ g˘ayyidan kay yang˘ah˙u¯ fı- l-imtih˙a¯ni. (not:   َﻳ ْﻨ َﺠ ُﺤﻮ َنyang˘ah˙u¯na)
They studied well so that they would pass (succeed in) the
examination.
(= They studied well in order to pass the examination.)
َﻟ ْﻦ  َأ ْذ َﻫ َﺐ  َﻣ َﻌ َﻬﺎ
lan ad¯haba maa-ha¯.
I shall never go with her. (I will not go with her.)
28.4
The subjunctive particles   ِإ َذ ْنand   ِإ ًذاid¯an ‘then, in that case, so’
have the same meaning and pronunciation. Both are used in discourse
when you draw a conclusion on the basis of a previous statement.
210
Moods:
subjunctive,
jussive
(apocopa-
tus),
imperative

(a)  ِإ َذ ْنid¯an is always followed by the subjunctive mood:
ُس  َﻛ ِﺜﻴ ًﺮا ـ  ِإ َذ ْن  َﺳ َﺘ ْﻨ َﺠ َﺢ  َﻏ ًﺪا
َأ َﻧﺎ  َأ ْد ُر
ana¯ adrusu kat¯ı-ran – id¯an sa-tang˘ah˙a g˙adan.
‘I study a lot.’ – ‘Then (I suppose) you will succeed tomorrow!’
(b)  ِإ ًذاid¯an, is used in nominal sentences:
ِﺻ ٌﺪ  َﺟ َّﻮ ٌّي
  ِإ ًذا  َأ ْﻧ َﺖ  َرا-َﺳ ُﺘ ْﻤ ِﻄ ُﺮ  َﻏ ًﺪا
satumt˙iru g˙adan. – id¯an anta ra¯s˙idun g˘awwiyyun.
‘It will rain tomorrow.’ – ‘Then (I gather) you are a meteorologist.’
28.5
The subjunctive particle   َأ ْنan may sometimes be used after the
prepositions   َﻗ ْﺒ َﻞqabla ‘before’ and   َﺑ ْﻌ َﺪbada ‘after’, i.e.   َﻗ ْﺒ َﻞ  َأ ْنqabla
an,   َﺑ ْﻌ َﺪ  َأ ْنbada an. It is then followed by a verb in the subjunctive
mood, e.g.
َض  َﻗ ْﺒ َﻞ  َأ ْن  ُﻳ َﺴﺎ ِﻓ َﺮ
َﻣ ِﺮ
marid˙a qabla an yusa¯ﬁra. He became sick before he travelled.
ُس  َﺑ ْﻌ َﺪ  َأ ْن  ا ُﻛ َﻞ
َﺳ َﺄ ْد ُر
sa-adrusu bada an a¯kula. I will read (study) after I have eaten.
28.6
The verbal noun (mas˙dar) can be used as a verb to replace
the subjunctive mood in a subordinate clause, in the same way as the
English inﬁnitive, e.g.
28.7  َﺣـ َّﺘﻰh˙ atta¯ has already been described as a preposition and
focus particle. Here it is introduced as a subjunctive particle, taking the
Imperfect subjunctive
Verbal noun
َﻃ َﻠ ْﺒ ُﺖ  ِﻣ ْﻨ َﻬﺎ  َأ ْن  َﺗ ْﺬ َﻫ َﺐORَﻃ َﻠ ْﺒ ُﺖ  َذ َﻫﺎ َﺑ َﻬﺎ
t˙alabtu min-ha¯ an tad¯haba.
t˙alabtu d¯aha¯ba-ha¯.
I asked that she leave.
I asked her to leave.

subjunctive mood of the verb. The meaning of this expression is ‘so that,
in order to’:
ُس  َﺣ َّﺘﻰ  َﻳ ْﻨ َﺠ َﺢ  ِﻓـﻲ  ِ ْﻻ ْﻣ ِﺘ َﺤﺎ ِن
َﻳ ْﺪ ُر
yadrusu h˙atta¯ yang˘ah˙a fı- l-imtih˙a¯ni.
He studies so that he should succeed in the examination.
(= He studies in order to succeed in the examination.)
  َﺣـ َّﺘﻰh˙ atta¯ can be followed by the negative particle   َﻻla¯, i.e. , َﺣ َّﺘﻰ  َﻻ
meaning ‘so that . . . not, in order not to . . .’. It is quite commonly used
nowadays, e.g.
َﺺ  َﺣ َّﺘﻰ  َﻻ  َﻳ ْﻈ َﻬ َﺮ  َﻋ َﻠ ْﻴ ِﻪ  ْﻟ َﻮ َﺳ ُﺦ

nad¯˙
d¯˙
afa l-qamı-s˙a h˙atta¯ la¯ yad¯˙
hara alay-ha¯ l-wasah˘u.
He cleaned the shirt so that the dirt would not show on it.
28.8
Imperfect jussive (apocopatus)
The imperfect jussive mood is also called apocopatus (‘cut from the
end’) in Arabic َﻀﺎ ِر ُع  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﺠ ُﺰو ُم
 . َأ ْﻟـ ُﻤWith some exceptions, it is formed
from the subjunctive mood simply by dropping the last short vowel. (See
the conjugations in Appendix 2.) The jussive mood is employed after the
negative particles
and after the exhortative particle ...  ِﻟـli... .
(a)  َﻻla¯ ‘not, no, don’t’, is the most common negative particle, called
 . َأﻟـ َّﻨـﺎ ِﻫـ َﻴـ ُﺔTogether with a jussive verb of the second person (sing.,
du., pl.; masc. and fem.), it expresses a prohibition or negative
command, e.g.
!  َﻻ  َﺗ ْﺸ َﺮ ْب  َﺧ ْﻤ ًﺮاla¯ tasˇrab h˘amran! Don’t drink wine ! (masc. sing.)
!  َﻻ  َﺗـ ْﺠـ ِﻠـ ِﺴـﻲ  ُﻫـ َﻨـﺎla¯ tag˘lisı- huna¯! (not: ...  َﻻ  َﺗـ ْﺠـ ِﻠـ ِﺴـﻴـ َﻦla¯ tag˘lisı-na...)
Don’t sit here! (fem. sing.)
  َﻻla¯  َﻟ ْﻢlam  َﻟـ َّﻤﺎlamma¯
212
Moods:
subjunctive,

(apocopa-
tus),
imperative

!  َﻻ  َﺗـﺬ َﻫـ ُﺒﻮا  َﻣـ َﻌـ ُﻪla¯ tad¯habu¯ maa-hu! (not:  ..  َﻻ  َﺗـ ْﺬ َﻫـ ُﺒﻮ َنla¯
tad¯habu¯na ...)
Don’t go with him! (masc. pl.)
(b)
The negative particle   َﻟ ْﻢlam ‘did not’ is used before a jussive verb
with the same meaning as   َﻣﺎma¯ ‘not’ + perfect (i.e. negative past,
cf. chapter 14.11), e.g.
  َﻟ ْﻢ  َﻳ ْﻜـ ُﺘ ْﺐ  َﻟ ُﻪlam yaktub la-hu. He did not write to him.
  َﻟ ْﻢ  َﻳ ْﻜـ ُﺘ ِﺐ ﻟ َّﺮ َﺳﺎ َﻟ َﺔlam yaktubi r-risa¯lata. He did not write the letter.
Remember: The kasrah /i/ in the above phrase ‘lam yaktubi ...’ is
the result of the rule given before that a ﬁnal suku¯n is changed to
kasrah as a connective vowel before hamzatu l-was˙li (was˙lah).
(c)  َﻟـ ْﻢlam is sometimes sufﬁxed by ... ...ـ َﻤـﺎma¯, becoming َﻟـ َّﻤـﺎ
lamma¯, which means ‘not yet’. The following verb is in the jussive
mood, e.g.
  َﻟـ َّﻤﺎ  َﻳ ْﻜ ُﺘ ْﺐ  َﻟ ُﻪlamma¯ yaktub la-hu. He has not written to him yet.
28.9
The particle .../  ِﻟـli.../ (also called the la¯m of imperative)
expresses either a direct or indirect command, exhortation or sugges-
tion. It can be translated as ‘let . . .!, may . . .!, let’s . . .!’, e.g.
Note a: The la¯m with kasrah ...  ِﻟـli... may be preceded by the conjunction
.../  َﻓـfa.../ or /  َوwa../. Then the kasrah is replaced by suku¯n: .../  َﻓ ْﻠـfa-l.../, ...َو ْﻟـ
/wa-l.../.
Note b: This function of the particle .../  ِﻟـli.../ should not be confused with its
use together with the subjunctive mood, expressing intent or purpose.
!  ِﻟ َﺘ ْﺸ َﺮ ْبli-tasˇrab!
!  ِﻟ َﻴ ْﻜـ ُﺘ ْﺐli-yaktub!
!ﺲْ
  ِﻟ َﻨ ْﺠ ِﻠli-nag˘lis!
May you drink! (Drink!)
Let him write!
Let us sit down!
!  َو ْﻟ َﺘ ْﺸ َﺮ ْبwa-l-tasˇrab!
!  َو ْﻟ َﻴ ْﻜـ ُﺘـ ْﺐwa-l-yaktub!
!ﺲْ
  َﻓ ْﻠـ َﻨ ْﺠ ِﻠfa-l-nag˘lis!
May you drink! (Drink!)
And let him write!
So let us sit down!

28.10
Imperative mood
The imperative mood   َأ ْ َﻷ ْﻣـ ُﺮis formed from the second person (sing.,
du., pl.; masc. and fem.) of the jussive mood by skipping the personal
preﬁx .../  َﺗـta.../ and replacing it with hamzatu l-qat˙
i (written on/under
alif) and d˙ ammah /  ُأu/ or kasrah /  ِإi/, in accordance with the
following rules:
(a)
When the verb has d˙ ammah /u/ on the middle radical in the
imperfect tense, the hamzah will take d˙ ammah in the imperative
mood: /  ُأu/, e.g.
(b)
When the verb has fath˙ ah /a/ or kasrah /i/ on the middle radical in
the imperfect tense, the hamzah will take kasrah in the imperative
mood: /  ِإi/, e.g.

Doubled verbs (mediae
geminatae) and
quadriliteral verbs
29.1
A doubled verb in Arabic, َﻀﺎ َﻋ ُﻒ
 , َأ ْﻟ ِﻔـ ْﻌ ُﻞ  ْﻟـ ُﻤـis a triliteral verb
whose second and third radicals are identical. In the basic form they are
thus written as one, with sˇaddah above. This phenomenon is called
‘ , ِإ ْد َﻏﺎ ٌمcontraction’, e.g.
29.2
The imperfect and imperative
The imperfect tense is vocalized in the same way as the imperfect of
the regular triliteral verb, which can have any of the three vowels on the
middle radical. The vowel is transferred between the ﬁrst and second
radical in doubled verbs.
The last consonant of the imperative of the second person masculine
singular has fath˙ ah, and not suku¯n like the regular verbs. Another
difference is that the imperative does not have the initial alif with
hamzah, which is preﬁxed to the imperative in regular verbs, e.g.
  َﻣـ َّﺮmarra
(for:  َﻣ َﺮ َرmarara)
to pass
  َﻓـ َّﺮfarra
(for:  َﻓ َﺮ َرfarara)
to escape, to ﬂee
  َد َّلdalla
(for:   َد َﻟ َﻞdalala)
to show
  َﻋ َّﺪadda
(for:   َﻋ َﺪ َدadada)
to count

See table A1.2, the patterns of the doubled verb   َﻓ َّﺮfarra, and conjuga-
tion A2.3, the doubled verb   َﻣـ َّﺮmarra, in the appendices.
Note: The derived verb forms are conjugated to a certain extent like the regular
verbs.
29.3
The nouns of place and time for the doubled verb are formed as
follows:
29.4
Quadriliteral verbs
The quadriliteral or four-radical verbs,  , َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ ﻟ ُّﺮ َﺑﺎ ِﻋﻲhave four
consonants in the root (the pattern   َﻓ ْﻌ َﻠ َﻞfalala). They are conjugated
as form II   َﻓـ َّﻌـ َﻞfaala (i.e. CaCCaCa) of the regular triliteral verb.
There are very few quadriliteral verbs and, apart from the basic form,
they have only two derived verb forms: II and IV. The derived forms
are less common and have no passive. The verbal noun (mas˙dar) of
the quadriliteral verb of the basic form follows the pattern of َﻓ ْﻌ َﻠ َﻠ ٌﺔ
falalatun. The perfect, imperfect indicative and verbal noun of the
quadriliteral verb are exempliﬁed below:

Verbs with hamzah
There are verbs where hamzah occurs as one of the radicals. These are
called,  ,  َأ ْﻟـ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻬ ُﻤﻮ ُزal-ﬁlu l-mahmu¯ zu.
30.1
Verbs with initial hamzah
Verbs with hamzah as the ﬁrst radical,  , َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ أ ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻬ ُﻤﻮ ُز  ْ َﻷ َّو ِلare con-
jugated on the same principles as the regular strong verbs, with some
exceptions. (See below and the conjugations in Appendix 2.)
30.2
When the imperative is preceded by the conjunction   َوwa... or ...َﻓـ
fa..., the long vowel after the initial hamzah disappears, i.e. is replaced
by suku¯n: ...  َو ْأwa-..., ...  َﻓ ْﺄfa..., e.g.

!  َﻓ ْﺄ ُﻣ ْﻞfa-mul! and hope!
(for:   َﻓ ُﺄو ُﻣ ْﻞfa-u¯mul)

30.3
In some verbs, such as   َأ َﺧ َﺬah˘ad¯a, ‘to take’, and   َأ َﻛ َﻞakala ‘to
eat’, the initial hamzah is elided in the imperative, e.g.
30.4
Assimilation process
If the initial radical of the basic verb form is   َأa, as   َأ َﺧ َﺬah˘ad¯a ‘to take’,
then the initial hamzah in verb form VIII is assimilated to the inﬁx /-t-/,
producing a doubled .../ .ـ َّﺘـ-tt-/, e.g.
  ِإ َّﺗ َﺨ َﺬittah˘ad¯a, to take up, to adopt (instead of   ِإ ْأ َﺗ َﺨ َﺬitah˘ad¯a)
30.5
Verbs with hamzah as the middle radical
(a)
The medial hamzah,  , َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻬ ُﻤﻮ ُز  ْﻟ َﻮ َﺳ ِﻂcan be written on alif
(.. ,)..أwa¯w (.. )..ـﺆor ya¯ (..( .)..ـﺌـFollow the rules for writing
hamzah provided in chapter 20.) These verbs are conjugated on
the same principle as the regular verbs, with the exception of the
two verbs َﺳـ َﺄ َل
 saala ‘to ask’ and   َر َأىraa¯ ‘to see’, which lose
their medial hamzah. (See the conjugation of the verb   َر َأىraa¯
(A2.16 in Appendix 2) and chapter 33.)
(b)
The irregular verb َﺳـ َﺄ َل
 saala ‘to ask’ can drop its medial hamzah
in the imperfect jussive and imperative. Thus it has two alternative

of verb are also conjugated like regular strong verbs, e.g.

In the verb   َد ِﻓﻰ َءdaﬁa ‘to be warm’, the inﬁx / ت-t-/ of verb
form VIII (iftaala  ) ِإ ْﻓ َﺘ َﻌ َﻞis assimilated to the initial radical

instead of   ِإ ْد َﺗ َﻔ َﺄidtafaa.
Note: The derived verb forms (II–X) of all verbs with hamzah mentioned
above are conjugated in the active and passive more or less on the same
principles as the derived verb forms (II–X) of strong verbs.

Chapter 31
Verbs with a weak initial
radical
31.1
The weak verbs,  , َا ْ َﻷ ْﻓ َﻌﺎ ُل  ْﻟـ ُﻤ ْﻌ َﺘ َّﻠـ ُﺔwhich literally means ‘sick
verbs’ are verbs whose roots contain one or more weak radicals,
 . ُﺣ ُﺮو ُف  ْﻟ ِﻌ َّﻠ ِﺔThe weak radicals are the semivowels/ وw/ and / يy/. They
are called ‘weak’ because they are dropped or assimilated with vowels
according to certain rules in many conjugational forms. The weak verbs
are also called assimilated verbs.
Note: A verb is called strong, if none of its radicals is dropped or assimilated
with a vowel in the conjugation of the verb.
31.2
Weak verbs fall into four main categories:
(a)
Initial weak radical (assimilated verb)  َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ  ْﻟـ ِﻤ َﺜﺎ ُلsee below;
(b)
Middle weak radical (hollow verb)  َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ  ْ َﻷ ْﺟ َﻮ ُفchap. 32;
(c)
Final weak radical (defective verb)ﺺُ
  َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ ﻟ َّﻨﺎ ِﻗchap. 33;
(d)
Doubly and trebly weak verbs  َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ ﻟـ َّﻠ ِﻔﻴ ُﻒchap. 33.
31.3
Verbs with the weak initial radical / وw/
(a)
Verbs with the weak initial radical / وw/ drop this radical in the
active imperfect and imperative. In the passive imperfect it is
assimilated to the preceding vowel, e.g.

Note: It may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd the root in the dictionary when the ﬁrst
initial weak radical of the imperfect and imperative is missing.
(b)
In a small number of verbs the initial weak radical /  َوw/ is also
retained in the imperfect. These verbs have kasrah / ــ ِـــi/ as the
middle vowel in the perfect, and fath˙ ah / ــ َـــa/ in the imperfect,
e.g.
31.4
Assimilation of the weak radical / وw/ in the derived
verb forms
(a)
The initial / وw/ of the basic verb form َﺻ َﻞ
  َوwas˙ala ‘to arrive’ in
verb form VIII is assimilated to the inﬁx / تt/, which then appears
as doubled ../ ــ ّﺘـtt../, e.g.
َﺼ َﻞ
  ِإ َّﺗittas˙ala, to be joined, to contact (for: َﺼ َﻞ
  ِإ ْو َﺗiwtas˙ala)
(b)
The IVth form   َأ ْو َﻗ َﻊawqaa ‘to drop’ is derived from the verb
  َو َﻗ َﻊwaqaa ‘to fall’. Its verbal noun (mas˙dar) is   ِإﻳ َﻘﺎ ٌعı¯qa¯un
‘rhythm’ (for:   ِإ ْو َﻗﺎ ٌعiwqa¯un).

initial
radical

‘to deposit’. Its verbal noun (mas˙dar) is   ِإ ْﺳ ِﺘﻴ َﺪا ٌعistı¯da¯un
‘lodging, depositing’ (for:  إ ْﺳ ِﺘ ْﻮ َدا ٌعistiwda¯un).
31.5
The nouns of place and time are formed as follows.
31.6
Verbs with the initial weak radical / يy/
There are very few verbs with the initial weak radical / يy/. These verbs
are mostly conjugated like strong verbs. The imperative and the passive
of the basic verb form are rare, e.g.
See table A1.3, the pattern of the derived verb forms with a weak initial
radical / وw/, and conjugation A2.8 of the weak verb َﺿ َﻊ
  َوwad˙ aa ‘to
put’ in the appendices.

Verbs with a weak middle
radical
32.1
Verbs with a weak middle radical,  , َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ  ْ َﻷ ْﺟ َﻮ ُفare those
which have alif (.. )..اas the middle letter of the basic verb form. This
middle alif (.. )..اis derived from the weak radical / وw/ or / يy/. These
types of verb are also called ‘hollow’ because their middle radical is lost
in the basic (and many other) verb forms, e.g.
  َﻗﺎ َلqa¯la, to say (for:   َﻗ َﻮ َلqawala) from the root  ﻗﻮلqwl
  َﺑﺎ َعba¯a, to sell (for:   َﺑ َﻴ َﻊbayaa) from the root  ﺑﻴﻊby
32.2
The ﬁrst radical in the ﬁrst and second persons of the basic verb
form in the perfect tense receives the related vowel of the middle radical,
which is itself lost, according to the rules below.
(About the three vowels and their three related consonants, see
chapter 20.)
(a)
If the middle radical is / وw/, then the ﬁrst and second persons take
d˙ ammah /u/ on the ﬁrst radical in the perfect:
(Remember from chapter 20 that  وis related to d˙ ammah /u/.)
(b)
If the middle radical is / يy/, then the ﬁrst and second persons take
kasrah /i/ on the ﬁrst radical in the perfect:
Perfect
Root

  َﻗﺎ َلqa¯la, he said
( ﻗﻮلqwl)  ُﻗ ْﻠـ ُﺖqultu, I said
  َﻛﺎ َنka¯na, he was
( ﻛﻮنkwn)  ُﻛـ ْﻨ ُﺖkuntu, I was

(Remember from chapter 20 that  يis related to kasrah /i/.)
32.3
In the imperfect indicative and subjunctive, the weak middle
radical ../ ..ـﻮw/ or ../ ..ـﻴـy/ reappears, but it disappears in the
jussive and some of the imperative forms, e.g.
See table A1.4 for the patterns of the derived verb forms with a weak
middle radical  .وSee paradigms A2.9 and A2.10 for the verbs ‘  َﻗﺎ َلto
say’ and ‘  َﺑﺎ َعto sell’ in Appendix 2.
32.4
A very small number of verbs with a weak middle radical / وw/
or / يy/ also change the  وor  يto alif ( )اin the imperfect and some
forms of the imperative, e.g.

Chapter 33
Verbs with a weak ﬁnal
radical, doubly weak verbs
and weak verbs with hamzah
33.1
Verbs with a weak ﬁnal radical / وw/ or / يy/ are called defective
verbs  . َأ ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻌ ُﻞ ﻟ َّﻨﺎ ِﻗﺺThe ﬁnal weak radical appears as alif / اa¯/ or alif
maqs˙u¯rah / ىa¯/ in the basic verb form (perfect, third person masc. sing.)
upon combining with the personal ending. The defective verbs fall into
the following categories according to their vocalization.
33.2
If the ﬁnal radical is / وw/, then the basic form (perfect, third
person masc. sing.) ends in alif .../ ...اa¯/ (contraction of...a-w-a),
and the imperfect (in most persons) ends in .../ .. ُ.وu¯ / (contraction
of...u-w-u), e.g.
33.3
If the ﬁnal radical is / يy/ and the middle radical has the vowel
kasrah /i/, then the basic form ends quite regularly in .../ .. ِ. َيiya/, but
the imperfect ends in alif maqs˙u¯rah .../ . َ..ىa¯/ (contraction of ...a-y-u),
e.g.
Perfect (3. masc. sing.)
Imperfect (3. masc. sing.)

33.4
If the ﬁnal radical is / يy/ and the middle radical has the vowel
fath˙ ah /a/, then the basic form ends in alif maqs˙u¯rah .../ .. َ..ىa¯/ (con-
traction of ...a-y-a), and the imperfect ends in .../ . ِ..يı¯/ (contraction
of ...i-y-u):
33.5
A very small number of verbs, of the type discussed above in
paragraph 33.4, have alif maqs˙u¯rah .../ ... َـﻰa¯/ (contraction of ...a-y-u)
also in the imperfect tense, e.g.
33.6
All verb forms I–X of roots with a weak ﬁnal radical / ...ـﻮw/
or / ...يy/ omit this ﬁnal radical in the jussive and imperative, e.g.

Verbs with
a weak ﬁnal
radical,
doubly
weak verbs

33.7
The passive of all verbs with a weak ﬁnal radical / ...وw/ or
/ ...يy/ is conjugated according to the same pattern as the strong verbs,
e.g.
33.8
The conjugation of the derived verb forms II–X of verbs with
a weak ﬁnal radical .../ ...وw/ or .../ ...يy/ is identical to that of the
derived verb forms of strong verbs. There is an exception with some
verbal nouns where the weak ﬁnal radical after the alif is changed to
hamzah, e.g.   ِﻟ َﻘﺎ ٌءliqa¯un ‘meeting’ (for:   ِﻟ َﻘﺎ ٌيliqa¯yun) from the root
 ﻟﻘﻲlqy ‘to meet’.
See the pattern tables of verbs with a weak ﬁnal radical / وw/ or / يy/
and their conjugations in the appendices.
33.9
The declension of the active participle of verbs with a weak
ﬁnal radical / ...وw/ or / ...يy/ is illustrated below with the help of the
active participle ضٍ
  َﻗﺎqa¯d˙ in ‘judge’, from the verb َﻀﻰ
  َﻗqad˙ a¯ ‘to
judge’. It should be noted that the active participle has only two case
endings in the masculine singular: /...in/ for both the nominative and
genitive and /...an/ for the accusative:

Verbs with
a weak ﬁnal
radical,
doubly
weak verbs

(a)
Verbs with/ وw/ or / يy/ as initial and ﬁnal radical: These verbs
obey both the rules for verbs with a weak initial radical as well as
the rules for verbs with a weak ﬁnal radical, e.g.
The active participle is   َوا ٍقwa¯qin ‘protective, preservative’ and
is declined like ضٍ
  َﻗﺎqa¯d˙ in ‘judge’. The verbal noun (mas˙dar)
is   ِو َﻗﺎ ٌءwiqa¯un or   ِو َﻗﺎ َﻳ ٌﺔwiqa¯yatun ‘protection, prevention’.
Note: Verb form VIII is very common for the above-mentioned verb,
being   ِإ َّﺗ َﻘﻰittaqa¯ ‘to fear God’ (Quranic), for   ِإ ْو َﺗ َﻘﻰiwtaqa¯. The verbal
noun (mas˙dar) of form VIII of this verb is   ِإ َّﺗ َﻘﺎ ٌءittiqa¯un.
(b)
Verbs with wa¯w / وw/ and ya¯ / يy/ as second and third radical,
respectively, are conjugated in the same way as verbs with a weak
ﬁnal radical. The weak middle radical / وw/ or / يy/ is fully
pronounced, e.g.

Verbs with a middle hamzah and ﬁnal alif-maqs˙u¯rah ( ىin the
basic form) are rare, but include the common verb   َر َأىraa¯ ‘to see’. In
the perfect it is conjugated like verbs with a ﬁnal alif maqs˙u¯rah ,..ـﻰ
but in the imperfect the middle hamzah .../  َأa.../ is, exceptionally,
omitted:
Note: The middle hamzah is also omitted in form IV:   َأ َرىara¯ ‘he showed’,
which in the imperfect is   ُﻳ ِﺮيyurı¯. (See paradigm A2.16 in Appendix 2.)

Cardinal numbers
34.1
The Arabic cardinal numbers, ْﺻ ِﻠ َّﻴ ُﺔ
 , َأ ْ َﻷ ْﻋ َﺪا ُد  ْ َﻷare rather com-
plicated and even native speakers make errors in using them. It is
important to remember that the numbers 3–10 take the feminine form
with ta¯ marbu¯t˙ah ( )...ةwhen they qualify a masculine noun, but the
masculine form when they qualify a feminine noun.
34.2
With the exception of the feminine form   ِإ ْﺣ َﺪىih˙ da¯, ‘one’, the
cardinal numbers 1–10 are inﬂected for all three cases in the same way
as nouns and adjectives.
The nominative forms of the cardinal numbers 1–10 are:
Used with a masculine noun
Used with a feminine noun

Note a: ِﺻ ْﻔ ٌﺮ
 s˙ifrun ‘zero’ comes from the verb َﺻ َﻔ َﺮ
 ,which means ‘to be
empty’.
Note b: The combined accusative-genitive forms of   ِإ ْﺛ َﻨﺎ ِنit¯na¯ni (m.) and
  ِإ ْﺛ َﻨ َﺘﺎ ِنit¯nata¯ni (f.) ‘two’ are:   ِإ ْﺛ َﻨ ْﻴ ِﻦit¯nayni (m.) and   ِإ ْﺛ َﻨ َﺘ ْﻴ ِﻦit¯natayni (f.),
respectively.
Note c: The number ‘  َﺛ َﻤﺎ ٍنeight’ is declined like the participle ٍض
(  َﻗﺎsee
chapter 33 for verbs with a weak ﬁnal radical).
Note d: The middle consonant / شsˇ/ in ‘  َﻋ ْﺸ ٌﺮ /  َﻋ َﺸ َﺮ ٌةten’ takes fath˙ ah in the
masculine:  , َﻋ َﺸ َﺮ ٌةbut suku¯n in the feminine: . َﻋ ْﺸ ٌﺮ
34.3
The Arabic cardinal numbers differ from English cardinal
numbers in that they are nouns and not adjectives (except 2, which has
both noun and adjective forms). Therefore the noun following the
number is not in the nominative, but takes different case endings
according to the number.
The numbers 3–10 are followed by a noun in the indeﬁnite genitive
plural.
Remember: The gender of the numbers is decided by the gender of the
noun in the singular and not in the plural.
34.4
The ﬁrst two cardinal numbers (1, 2) are used as appositive
adjectives to emphasize the amount:

Note: These numbers never precede the noun adjectivally, because the singular
and dual forms of the nouns are sufﬁcient to indicate the number of referents.
34.5
The nouns   َأ َﺣ ٌﺪah˙ adun ‘one’ (masc.) and   ِإ ْﺣ َﺪىih˙ da¯ ‘one’
(fem.) are used in the id˙ a¯fah construction with a noun or a pronoun,
e.g.
  َأ َﺣ ٌﺪah˙ adun is also used after a negative particle to mean ‘not . . . any-
one, nobody, no one, none’, but the feminine form   ِإ ْﺣ َﺪىih˙ da¯ cannot be
used for the same purpose, e.g.

  ِﺑbid˙
atu, means ‘(a) few,
some, several’. It follows the rules for the numbers 3–10, e.g.

The compound numbers 20–99 are followed by the noun in the
indeﬁnite accusative singular, like the numbers 11–19. These compound
numbers are fully declined. The conjunction   َوis inserted between the
two parts, for example   َﺧ ْﻤ َﺴ ٌﺔ  َو ِﻋ ْﺸ ُﺮو َنh˘amsatun wa-isˇru¯ na ‘twenty-
ﬁve’, literally ‘ﬁve and twenty’, e.g.
34.10
The hundreds, 100–900, are followed by the noun in the
indeﬁnite genitive singular. The noun can be masculine or feminine. The
combinations of the compound numbers are written in two different
ways.

Note: Observe that the middle alif ( )اin   ِﻣﺎ َﺋ ٌﺔmiatun, as an alternative form
of   ِﻣ َﺌ ٌﺔmiatun, is not pronounced.
Examples:
34.11
The plural of   ِﻣ َﺌ ٌﺔmiatun is   ِﻣ َﺌﺎ ٌتmia¯tun, which is an excep-
tion. In compound numbers it is always singular, not plural like the
words for a thousand and a million, e.g.
  ِﺗ ْﺴ ُﻊ  ِﻣ َﺌ ٍﺔtisu miatin, nine hundred (not:   ِﺗ ْﺴ ُﻊ  ِﻣ َﺌﺎ ٍتtisu mia¯tin)
34.12
The number thousand (1,000) in Arabic is   َأ ْﻟ ٌﻒalfun. The
dual of it is   َأ ْﻟ َﻔﺎ ِنalfa¯ni in the nominative, and   َأ ْﻟ َﻔ ْﻴ ِﻦalfayni in
the accusative and genitive. The plural is   ُأ ُﻟﻮ ٌفulu¯ fun or ا َﻻ ٌف
a¯la¯fun.
34.13
The number million (1,000,000) is  , ِﻣ ْﻠ ُﻴﻮ ُنmilyu¯ nu. The dual

The numbers thousand and million are used with both mascu-
line and feminine and followed by the noun in the indeﬁnite genitive
singular, e.g.
34.15
With compound numbers over 100, the following noun is
declined according to the last number or last two numbers. For
example, take the number 125: the last two numbers are 25, so the
following noun will be according to the rule of 25, i.e. it is in the
indeﬁnite accusative singular, e.g.
ِﻣ َﺌ ٌﺔ  َو َﺧ ْﻤ َﺴ ٌﺔ  َو ِﻋ ْﺸ ُﺮو َن  َر ُﺟ ًﻼ
miatun wa-h˘amsatun wa-isˇru¯na rag˘ulan, 125 men

miatun wa-t¯ala¯t¯un wa-t¯ala¯t¯u¯na bintan, 133 girls
If the number is 105, the ﬁnal number is 5 and it will be according to the
rule of 5, i.e. the following noun is in the indeﬁnite genitive plural, e.g.
34.16
If the number is preceded by the deﬁnite article /  َأ ْﻟـal.../, it
can be placed after the deﬁnite noun, which follows the general rules of
agreement for numbers, e.g.

kutubu l-muallimi t¯-t¯ala¯t¯atu
the three books of the teacher
34.17
To express numerical subsets, such as ‘one/two/three etc. of (a
given set)’, one uses the preposition   ِﻣ ْﻦmin ‘from, (out) of’ before the
plural genitive form of the noun, e.g.
ِﻛ َﺘﺎ ٌب  ِﻣ ْﻦ  ُﻛ ُﺘ ِﺐ  ْﻟـ ُﻤ َﻌ َّﻠ ِﻢ

The following are the most common ways of reading a
sequence of compound numbers. Reading the sequence numbers of the
year: The synonyms   َﻋﺎ ٌمa¯mun ‘year’ (masc.) and َﺳ َﻨ ٌﺔ
 sanatun ‘year’
(fem.) have the accusative forms   َﻋﺎ َمa¯ma and َﺳ َﻨ َﺔ
 sanata, respectively,
which are used in adverbial phrases of time. Then they follow the rules
of the id˙ a¯fah construction, where the following noun is in the genitive
case, e.g.
(  َﻋﺎ َم  َأ ْﻟ ٍﻒ  َو ِﺗ ْﺴ ِﻊ  ِﻣ َﺌ ٍﺔ  َو ِﺗ ْﺴ َﻌ ٍﺔ  َو ِﺗ ْﺴ ِﻌﻴ َﻦmasc. acc.)

35.1
The ordinal numbers,   , َأ ْﻟـ َﻌـ َﺪ ُد ﻟـ َّﺘـ ْﺮ ِﺗـﻴـ ِﺒ ُّﻲ2nd–10th are based
on the corresponding cardinal numbers. They are formed on the pattern
for active participles:   َﻓﺎ ِﻋ ٌﻞfa¯ilun. The ordinal number ‘ﬁrst’ is formed
from an independent root -w-l on the pattern   َأ ْﻓ َﻌ ُﻞafalu. The ordinal
numbers agree with the gender and case of the head noun, i.e. the
masculine forms are used with reference to masculine nouns, and the
feminine forms are used with reference to feminine nouns. They take
the deﬁnite article ...  َأﻟـand are inﬂected for all three cases. Like any
other adjective, the ordinal number usually follows the noun it qualiﬁes.
Note: The double /tt/ (ta¯ with sˇaddah) in the cardinal number ِﺳـ َّﺘـ ٌﺔ
 sittatun
‘six’ is resolved as /d/ + /s/ in the ordinal number سٌ
َﺳﺎ ِد
 sa¯disun ‘sixth’.

Note: In this construction the ordinal number is in the masculine even when
the following noun or sufﬁx pronoun is feminine, unless the ordinal number
is preceded by a feminine subject. (Even so, the feminine ordinal number ُأو َﻟﻰ

The Islamic era and the Muslim festivals

(a)
The hig˘rah year,   َأﻟ َّﺴ َﻨ ُﺔ  ْﻟ ِﻬ ْﺠ ِﺮ َّﻳ ُﺔas-sanatu l-hig˘riyyatu, is the year
in which the Prophet Muh˙ ammad emigrated from Mecca to
Medina, i.e. 622 ad (16 July). This year is counted as year 1 of the
Islamic era. The Muslim year is a lunar year, َأﻟ َّﺴ َﻨ ُﺔ  ْﻟ َﻘ َﻤ ِﺮ َّﻳ ُﺔ
as-sanatu l-qamariyyatu, and counts only 354 days. The lunar
year is not so often used but when it is used, the Christian year is
also mentioned.
(b)
The holy month of َﻀﺎ ُن
  َر َﻣRamad˙ a¯n(u) has no regular corre-
sponding date in the Christian year, because the lunar months
rotate backwards. It is the month of fasting from dawn to sunset.
The festivities at the end of Ramadan have two names: ِﻋﻴ ُﺪ
  ْﻟ ِﻔ ْﻄ ِﺮı¯du l-ﬁt˙ri ‘The festival of the breaking of the fast’ and
َّﺼ ِﻐﻴ ُﺮ
  َأ ْﻟ ِﻌﻴ ُﺪ ﻟal-ı¯du s˙-s˙ag˙ı¯ru ‘The small festival’. The common
festival greeting is:   ِﻋﻴ ٌﺪ  ُﻣ َﺒﺎ َر ٌكı¯dun muba¯rakun ‘Blessed feast!’
or َﻀﺎ ُن  ُﻣ َﺒﺎ َر ٌك
  َر َﻣRamad˙ a¯nu muba¯rakun ‘Blessed Ramadan!’
(c)ْﺿ َﺤﻰ
  ِﻋﻴ ُﺪ  ْ َﻷı¯du l-ad˙ h˙ a¯ means ‘The festival of sacriﬁce’, which
consists of different ceremonies on the days of the pilgrimage
(  َأ ْﻟـ َﺤ ُّﺞal-h˙ ag˘g˘u) to Mecca. It takes place on the tenth day of the
month of   ُذو  ْﻟـ ِﺤ َّﺠ ِﺔd¯u¯  l-h˙ ig˘g˘ati (the last month of the Islamic
calendar), when the pilgrims sacriﬁce sheep and give some of
the meat to the poor. It has another name,   َأ ْﻟ ِﻌﻴ ُﺪ  ْﻟ َﻜ ِﺒﻴ ُﺮal-ı¯du
l-kabı¯ru, which means ‘The great festival’.
(d)
The birthday of the Prophet Muhammad is called ِﻋﻴ ُﺪ  ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻮ ِﻟ ِﺪ
 ﻟ َّﻨ َﺒ ِﻮ َّي ı¯du l-mawlidi n-nabawiyyi, but it is not much celebrated

‘the year of the birth (of Christ)’.

Verbs of wonder, َأ ْﻓ َﻌﺎ ُل ﻟ َّﺘ َﻌ ُّﺠ ِﺐ
Exclamatory phrases such as ‘How beautiful!’, ‘How tall!’, ‘How black
he/she/it is!’, ‘What a rich man he is!’, etc., are expressed by using the
interrogative pronoun   َﻣﺎma¯ ‘what?’, followed by a verb form which
looks like the derived verb form IV in the perfect tense third person
singular masculine (pattern:   َأ ْﻓ َﻌ َﻞafala) and a noun in the accusative
case or a sufﬁxed pronoun, e.g.

Verbs of
wonder, the
negative
copula,
special verbs
and uses

Remember from chapter 32 that the two verbs   َﻛﺎ َنka¯na ‘he was’ and
ﺲَ
  َﻟ ْﻴlaysa ‘is not, are not’, have no passive forms.
37.4
The verb   َزا َلza¯la (imperfect:   َﻳ َﺰا ُلyaza¯lu) ‘to cease, to disappear,
to go away’ is another sister of   َﻛﺎ َنka¯na. It can be used as an aspectual
auxiliary in the perfect or imperfect tense, preceded by the negative
particle   َﻣﺎma¯,   َﻻla¯ or   َﻟ ْﻢlam, and followed either by a verb in the
imperfect tense or by a verbal adjective or a noun in the accusative
case. Both these constructions signify that the action has not ceased, the
activity or state is still continuing, e.g.
ُس  ِﻓﻲ  ْﻟـ َﺠﺎ ِﻣ َﻌ ِﺔ
َﻣﺎ  َزا َل/  َﻻ  َﻳ َﺰا ُل/  َﻟ ْﻢ  َﻳ َﺰ ْل  َﻳ ْﺪ ُر
ma¯ za¯la / la¯ yaza¯lu / lam yazal yadrusu fı- l-g˘a¯miati.
He is still (lit. did not cease) studying at the university.
َﻣﺎ  َزا َل/  َﻻ  َﻳ َﺰا ُل/  َﻟ ْﻢ  َﻳ َﺰ ْل  َﺣ ًّﻴﺎ
ma¯ za¯la / la¯ yaza¯lu / lam yazal h˙ayyan.
He is still alive. (lit. He did not cease being alive.)
37.5
The verb   َﻋﺎ َدa¯da (imperf.:   َﻳ ُﻌﻮ ُدyau¯ du) ‘to return, to do again, to
resume’ is somewhat similar to the above verb   َزا َلza¯la.
(a)
When it is preceded by the negative particle   َﻣﺎma¯ or   َﻟ ْﻢlam, the
meaning is: ‘not again, no longer’, e.g.
ُس  ِﻓﻲ  ْﻟـ َﺠﺎ ِﻣ َﻌ ِﺔ
َﻋﺎ َد  َﻳ ْﺪ ُر
a¯da yadrusu fı- l-g˘a¯miati.
He resumed studying at the university.
ُس  ِﻓﻲ  ْﻟـ َﺠﺎ ِﻣ َﻌ ِﺔ
َﻣﺎ  َﻋﺎ َد /  َﻟ ْﻢ  َﻳ ُﻌ ْﺪ  َﻳ ْﺪ ُر
ma¯ a¯da / lam yaud yadrusu fı- l-g˘a¯miati.
He is no longer studying at the university. OR
He no longer studies at the university.
(b)
The IVth form of the above verb   َﻋﺎ َدa¯da is   َأ َﻋﺎ َدaa¯da. When it is
followed by a deﬁned noun in the accusative case, it will have the
meaning ‘to do again, to give back, re-’, e.g.
َأ َﻋﺎ َد  ْﻟ ِﻜ َﺘﺎ َب
aa¯da l-kita¯ba. He returned / gave back the book.

Note: The above   ِإ َﻋﺎ َد ٌةis the verbal noun of form IV.
37.6
The verb   َﻛﺎ َدka¯da (imperfect:  ﻳ َﻜﺎ ُدyaka¯du) ‘to be about to
. . ., almost, (nearly) . . .’ is used as an auxiliary with the following verb
in the imperfect indicative or, alternatively, imperfect subjunctive
(after  ,) َأ ْنe.g.
When   َﻛﺎ َدka¯da is in the perfect or imperfect tense, preceded by the

The verb   َدا َمda¯ma ‘to last, to continue, to go on’ can be used in
temporal clauses meaning ‘as long as . . . (something is happening or
going on)’. It is then preceded by the conjunction   َﻣﺎma¯ ‘as long as’ and
followed by a verb in the imperfect tense or a participle in the accusative
case, e.g.
َﻣﺎ  َدا َم  َﺟﺎ ِﻟ ًﺴﺎ
ma¯ da¯ma g˘a¯lisan, as long as he is sitting

Some special uses of the preﬁxed preposition ..  ِﺑـbi...
The preposition ..  ِﺑـbi..., which normally means ‘by, with’, etc., can
also be used in certain types of complements:
293
Verbs of

special verbs
and uses

(a)
..  ِﺑـbi... preceding a direct object
Certain triliteral transitive verbs, such as َﺳ ِﻤ َﻊ
 samia ‘to hear’
and   َﺑ َﻌ َﺚbaat¯a ‘to send’, may take the preposition ..  ِﺑـbi... before
the direct object, which then appears in the genitive case. This
construction is merely a stylistic alternative to the regular con-
struction with an accusative direct object, e.g.
Compare:
َأ َﻛ َﻞ ﻟ َّﻠ ْﺤ َﻢ  ِﺑﻟ َّﺸ ْﻮ َﻛ ِﺔ
akala l-lah˙ma bi-sˇ-sˇawkati. He ate the meat with the fork.
(b)
..  ِﺑـbi ... before the complement of a negative predicate
After the negative copula ﺲَ
  َﻟ ْﻴlaysa ‘is not’, and after the nega-
tive particle   َﻣﺎma¯ ‘not’, the predicative complement may take
the preposition ...  ِﺑـbi.. (+ genitive). Again, this construction is
merely a stylistic alternative to the regular construction with an
accusative predicative complement, e.g.
َﺳ ِﻤ ْﻌ ُﺖ  ِﺑ ْﻟـ َﺨ َﺒ ِﺮORَﺳ ِﻤ ْﻌ ُﺖ  ْﻟـ َﺨ َﺒ َﺮ
samitu bi-l-h˘abari. I heard the piece of

(c)
..  ِﺑـbi... preceding the conjunctions   َأ ْنan and   َأ َّنanna
The preposition ..  ِﺑـbi... can be preﬁxed to the subordinating
conjunctions   َأ ْنan and   َأ َّنanna ‘that’ without any change of
meaning, e.g.
(d)
Sometimes the particle   ِإ ْذid¯ ‘when’ is used with the meaning ‘and
then suddenly . . . !’, indicating surprise or sudden appearance.
In that case the subject may take the preposition ..  ِﺑـbi.... The
particle   َﻗ ْﺪqad is then normally added after the subject before
the verb.

Chapter 38
Adverbs and adverbials,
absolute or inner object,
h˙ a¯l (circumstantial clause)
and tamyı¯z (accusative
of speciﬁcation)
38.1
Adverbs
Arabic adverbs are mostly derived from nominals. The majority of the
derived adverbs are, in fact, indeﬁnite accusative nouns or adjectives,
although there are also many derived adverbs with d˙ ammah without
nunation or article. Compared to European languages, Arabic has
few underived (original) adverbs. The underived adverbs may
end in suku¯n or fath˙ ah, less often in kasrah or d˙ ammah without
nunation.
38.2
In Arabic grammars, adverbs are classiﬁed by meaning as
follows:
(a)
adverbs of time, (  َﻇ ْﺮ ُف  َز َﻣﺎ ٍنanswer the question:   َﻣ َﺘﻰmata¯
‘when?’)
(b)
adverbs of place, (  َﻇ ْﺮ ُف  َﻣ َﻜﺎ ٍنanswer the question:   َأ ْﻳ َﻦayna
‘where?’ or ‘whence?’).
Note: Of course, there are also adverbs of manner, degree, reason, restriction,
etc., e.g. the underived adverb   َﻓ َﻘ ْﻂfaqat˙ ‘only’.
38.3
All adverbs of time are derived from verbal roots or pronominal
bases. The common adverb   َﻣ َﺘﻰmata¯ ‘when?’ (also used as the temporal
conjunction ‘when’) is apparently etymologically connected with the
interrogative pronouns   َﻣﺎma¯ ‘what?’ and   َﻣ ْﻦman ‘who?’.

  َﻣ َﺘﻰmata¯ can be preceeded by the particle   َأ ْيay, as   َأ ْي  َﻣ َﺘﻰaymata¯,
without any change of meaning, e.g.
38.4
Adverbs of time often have the deﬁnite article ...  َأ ْﻟـand take
the accusative or, rarely, nominative case, e.g.
With article:
Without article:
Note: Adverbs ending in d˙ ammah, like   َﺑ ْﻌ ُﺪand  , َﻗ ْﺒ ُﻞmay take a preposition.
Nevertheless they do not change the ending into kasrah, e.g.   ِﻣ ْﻦ  َﺑ ْﻌ ُﺪmin badu
‘afterwards’.
Examples:
  َﻣﺎ  َﺟﺎ َء  ْﻟ َﻴﻮ َمma¯ g˘a¯a l-yawma. He did not come today.
  َﻣﺎ  َﺟﺎ َء  َﺑ ْﻌ ُﺪma¯ g˘a¯a badu. He has not come yet.
ﺲِ
َﺳﺎ َﻓ َﺮ  َأ ْﻣ
 sa¯fara amsi. He travelled yesterday.
Note: The kasrah in ﺲِ
  َأ ْﻣamsi ‘yesterday’ is not an indication of the genitive
case, but is only used for smoothing the pronunciation. Observe also that ﺲِ
َأ ْﻣ
amsi ‘yesterday’ has deﬁnite reference, although lacking the article. The noun
ﺲُ
  َأ ْ َﻷ ْﻣal-amsu, which is deﬁnite, means ‘the past’ (not: ‘yesterday’). Similarly,
  َﻏ ًﺪاg˙adan ‘tomorrow’ has deﬁnite reference but indeﬁnite form. Compare the
prepositional expression   ِﻓﻲ  ْﻟ َﻐ ِﺪfı¯ l-g˙adi ‘in the future’ (not ‘tomorrow’).
38.5
Certain nouns in the accusative without the article ...  َأﻟـare used
as adverbs when followed by a year, e.g.
  َﻣ َﺘﻰ  ِﺟ ْﺌ َﺖ؟mata¯ g˘ita?
OR  َأ ْي  َﻣ َﺘﻰ  ِﺟ ْﺌ َﺖ؟ay mata¯ g˘ita?

38.6
Underived adverbs of place,  ,  َﻇ ْﺮ ُف  َز َﻣﺎ ٍنare very few, e.g.
Examples:
!ْﺲ  ُﻫ َﻨﺎ
ِإ ْﺟ ِﻠ
ig˘lis huna¯! Sit here! (masc. sing.)
!ِإ ْذ َﻫ ْﺐ  ِﻣ ْﻦ  َﺣ ْﻴ ُﺚ  ِﺟ ْﺌ َﺖ
id¯hab min h˙ayt¯u g˘ita! Go whence you came!
38.7
Derived adverbs of place are common, e.g.,   َﻓ ْﻮ ُقfawqu
‘up(stairs), on top, above’,   َو َرا ُءwara¯u ‘behind, in the rear, at the
back’.
38.8

English adverbs are often rendered by prepositional phrases in
Arabic, e.g.
َﻓ ِﻬ َﻢ  ِﺑ ُﺴ ُﻬﻮ َﻟ ٍﺔ
fahima bi-suhu¯latin. He understood easily (lit. with ease).
َﻗ َﺮ َأ  َﻋ َﻠﻰ  َﻣ ْﻬ ٍﻞ

Absolute or inner object
The so-called absolute or inner object,  , َأ ْﻟـ َﻤ ْﻔ ُﻌﻮ ُل  ْﻟـ ُﻤ ْﻄ َﻠ ُﻖis used to
emphasize the manner of action or the number of instances. It consists
of a verbal noun (derived from the same root as the main verb) in the
indeﬁnite accusative form, followed by an accusative adjective.
ًﻀﺎ  َﺳ ِﺮﻳ ًﻌﺎ
َﺾ  َر ْﻛ
َر َﻛ
rakad˙a rakd˙an sarı-an. He ran swiftly. (lit. He ran a swift running.)
َﻓ ِﺮ َح  َﻓ َﺮ ًﺣﺎ  َﻛ ِﺒﻴ ًﺮا
farih˙a farah˙an kabı-ran. He rejoiced greatly. (lit. He rejoiced a great
joy.)
Note: Sometimes the inner object consists only of a dual verbal noun:
َد َّﻗ ِﺖ ﻟ َّﺴﺎ َﻋ ُﺔ  َد َّﻗ َﺘ ْﻴ ِﻦ
daqqati s-sa¯atu daqqatayni. The clock struck twice (two strikes).

38.11
H˙ a¯l clause (phrase)
H˙ a¯l   َﺣﺎ ٌلmeans ‘circumstance, condition, or state’. It is added to an
already complete sentence as a kind of supplementive adverbial clause
or phrase, answering the question   َﻛ ْﻴ َﻒkayfa ‘how?’ or ‘in which
manner or condition?’. In English it corresponds mostly to a (co)pre-
dicative or adverbial participle (referring to the subject or object), as
in ‘He came laughing. I saw him standing.’
H˙ a¯l   َﺣﺎ ٌلis mostly an adjective or active participle in the indeﬁnite
accusative, agreeing in gender and number with the noun to which it
refers, e.g.
ًﻀﺎ
  َﻋﺎ َد ﻟ َّﺴﺎ ِﺋ ُﺢ  َﻣ ِﺮﻳa¯da s-sa¯ih˙u marı-d˙an. The tourist returned ill.
(In which h˙ a¯l ‘condition’ has the tourist returned? He returned marı¯d˙ an
‘ill’. Thus, marı¯d˙ an is h˙ a¯l, because it describes the circumstance or con-
dition of the tourist.)
!َﻻ  َﺗ ْﺸ َﺮ ِب  ْﻟ َﻘ ْﻬ َﻮ َة  َﺳﺎ ِﺧ َﻨ ًﺔ

d¯ahabati l-bana¯tu ba¯kiya¯tin. The girls left weeping. (The girls wept as
they left.)
Remember that the above   َﺑﺎ ِﻛ َﻴﺎ ٍتis in the accusative indeﬁnite form,
although it has two kasrahs. See chapter 13 on the sound feminine
plural!
38.12
H˙ a¯l   َﺣﺎ ٌلcan be in the deﬁnite form only when followed by
a sufﬁxed possessive pronoun. H˙ a¯l is never deﬁned by the deﬁnite
article  , َأﻟـe.g.

38.13
The wa¯w of h˙ a¯l, َوا ُو  ْﻟـ َﺤﺎ ِل
The conjunction ‘  َوand’ can be used to introduce a h˙ a¯l clause based
on an active participle (which then remains in the nominative case). This
  َوis called the wa¯w of h˙ a¯l,  ,  َوا ُو  ْﻟـ َﺤﺎ ِلand can be translated as ‘while,
as’. The wa¯w of h˙ a¯l can be connected to a personal pronoun or a noun
in the nominative (referring to a separate subject), e.g.
َﺗ َﻜ َّﻠ َﻢ  َو ُﻫ َﻮ  َوا ِﻗ ٌﻒ
takallama wa-huwa wa¯qifun. He spoke while (he was) standing.
ُس  َﻧﺎ ِﺋ ٌﻢ
َﻫ َﺮ َب  َو ْﻟـ َﺤﺎ ِر
haraba wa-l-h˙a¯risu na¯imun. He escaped while the guard was sleeping.
38.14
H˙ a¯l,  , َﺣﺎ ٌلmay replace the participle with a ﬁnite verb in the
imperfect tense, preceded by the wa¯w of h˙ a¯l   َوand a pronoun, e.g.
َذ َﻫ َﺐ  َو ُﻫ َﻮ  َﻳـ ْﺒ ِﻜﻲ
d¯ahaba wa-huwa yabkı-. He left weeping. (He was weeping as he left.)
38.15
Tamyı¯z (accusative of speciﬁcation)
The word tamyı¯z,  , َﺗ ْﻤ ِﻴـﻴ ٌﺰmeans ‘speciﬁcation, discrimination, clariﬁca-
tion’. In grammar it refers to a nominal attribute in the accusative
indeﬁnite form that expresses the substance or content after measure
words, or the item counted after the cardinal numbers 11–99. In
addition, it is used after the elative form in periphrastic comparative
and superlative expressions. Examples:
ِإ ْﺷ ُﺘ ِﺮ َي  ِﻟ ْﺘ ٌﺮ  َز ْﻳ ًﺘﺎ
isˇturiya litrun zaytan.

Chapter 39
Conditional sentences
39.1
A conditional sentence contains two parts. The ﬁrst part of the
conditional sentence expresses a condition or contingency. It is called
protasis and the Arabic term is ‘  , َأﻟ َّﺸ ْﺮ ُطthe condition’. The second
part expresses the consequence or result of the condition and is called
apodosis, ‘ , َﺟ َﻮا ُب ﻟ َّﺸ ْﺮ ِطthe answer to the condition’.
39.2
Conditional sentences are mostly introduced by one of the three
conditional particles, which are   ِإ ْنin,   ِإ َذاid¯a¯ and   َﻟ ْﻮlaw, all meaning
‘if’. The following outlines the differences in their use.
39.3  ِإ ْنin ‘if’, is followed by a verb in the perfect or imperfect jussive
(apocopatus). In the following examples the second part has the perfect
or imperfect jussive, e.g.
(b)
The imperative can be used in the second part and must be pre-
ceded by .. , َﻓـe.g.
(a)
in + perf. +
in + perf. +
in + imperf. jussive +

If he studies, he succeeds (OR he will succeed).

ِإ ْن  َذ َﻫ َﺐ  َﻓ ْذ َﻫ ْﺐ
ِإ ْن  َﻳ ْﺬ َﻫ ْﺐ  َﻓ ْذ َﻫ ْﺐ
in d¯ahaba fa-d¯hab!
in yad¯hab fa-d¯hab!
If he goes, then you go! OR If he goes, then you should go!

Note: In spite of being in the perfect tense, the above verb   َذ َﻫﺐrefers to the future
here (see chapter 17).
39.4  ِإ َذاid¯a¯ ‘if’ is a synonym of   ِإ ْنin, with the nuance of eventual-
ity. It is followed by the perfect tense in the ﬁrst part and the perfect or
imperfect indicative in the second part. If the second part is a nominal
sentence or contains an imperative or one of the words below, then the
second part must be preceded by the particle ...  َﻓـfa ‘then’:
the particle   َﻗ ْﺪqad
the future particles َﺳ ْﻮ َف
 sawfa or ...َﺳـ
 sa...
the interrogative particle   َﻫ ْﻞhal
the negative particle   َﻣﺎma¯,   َﻟ ْﻦlan, or   َﻻla¯
the negative copula ﺲَ
  َﻟ ْﻴlaysa.
Note: The imperfect jussive and the imperative cannot be used after . ِإ َذا
Examples:
(a)
.../  َﻓـfa.../ preceding the second part when it is a nominal sentence:
ِﺻ َّﺤ ٌّﻲ
  ِإ ْن  َﺗ ْﻌ َﻤ ْﻞ  َﻓ ْﻟ َﻌ َﻤ ُﻞ in tamal fa-l-amalu s˙ih˙h˙iyyun.
If you work, (then) work is healthy.
(b)
.../  َﻓـfa.../ preceding the second part when it contains an impera-
tive verb:
  ِإ ْن  َﺳ َﺄ َﻟ َﻚ  َﻓ َﺄ ِﺟ ْﺒ ُﻪin saalaka fa-ag˘ib-hu.
If he asks you, (then) you answer him!
(c)

relative clauses with conditional implication. The verb in both parts of
the sentence is then in the imperfect jussive (apocopatus) mood:
Examples:
