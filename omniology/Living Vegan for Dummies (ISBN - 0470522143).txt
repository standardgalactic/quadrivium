About the Author
Alexandra Jamieson, CHHC, AADP, has been seen on Oprah, The Final Word, 
30 Days, and The National Health Test with Bryant Gumbel. She even was fea­
tured in the award-winning documentary Super Size Me (2004).
Why? Because Alex has proven herself to be a wise and profound voice for 
holistic nutrition and healthy living. In her book, The Great American Detox 
Diet (Rodale, 2005), Alex offers remarkably sane — and tasty — advice on 
how to detox, live healthfully, and feel fantastic.
Her knowledge of nutrition has been artfully developed through years of both 
professional and self-study. As the daughter of natural health advocates, Alex 
crafted a unique personal mission to spread the word about the power of 
healthy food and the astounding ways in which it can positively transform 
everyday life. Alex now commands a matchless repertoire of nutritional 
wisdom and food savvy.
Alex is a professionally trained healthy gourmet chef, having studied at 
New York City’s Natural Gourmet Institute for Health and Culinary Arts. She 
refined her techniques by cooking professionally in Milan, Italy, as well as at 
a variety of popular New York City restaurants.
In addition, Alex is a certified health and nutrition counselor. She studied 
with groundbreaking pioneers in the field of nutrition at the Institute for 
Integrative Nutrition, which is accredited by Columbia University’s Teacher’s 
College and by the American Association of Drugless Practitioners.
Alex also traveled the world, visiting more than 20 countries while premier­
ing Super Size Me, an Oscar-nominated documentary, and acting as a mes­
senger for the power of holistic nutrition and healthy detoxing. Though she 
readily and ably shares her message with all, her passion is helping profes­
sional women enhance their ability to excel and achieve using healthy food 
as a catalyst.
A healthy and energetic vegan herself, Alex lives in New York City with her 
family, including her vegan son, Laken, and a lively male cat named Sue.

Dedication

Introduction
G
rowing up in the wilds of Oregon, my artist/gardener mom and teacher 
dad taught me many lessons that served me well over the years. I was 
lucky enough to be raised in a family that saw the connections between fresh 
food, health, people, the animals and insects, and the earth we lived on. We 
did eat meat, dairy, eggs, and honey from our beekeeping friends, but I had 
a solid education in “the web of life 101.” My older brother and I were pretty 
healthy; we ate lots of fresh food, and we rarely ate out.
My parents canned tomatoes and set aside jars of blackberry jam, and the 
whole family would spend hours in local u-pick farms gathering hazelnuts or 
cherries when the season was right.
As I grew up and moved away from home, my eating habits strayed from 
freshly-made, organic foods to the standard American diet of fast-food, lots 
of soda with high-fructose corn syrup, regular doses of fried foods, and few 
fresh fruits or vegetables. By the time I reached my late 20s, I was getting sick 
and depressed, had frequent migraines, and started gaining weight quickly 
for the first time in my life. I realized that what I was eating was making me 
sick and that I had to make a change if I were to be a fully functioning, happy 
person again.
I went to a holistic doctor who diagnosed me with an underlying Candida 
yeast overgrowth and recommended a sugar- and dairy-free diet to help my 
body recover. As I read everything the library had to offer on natural foods, 
the vegan diet, and the realities of health and the food system, I realized that 
I had caused my own health problems with my diet and discovered that my 
food choices had a large impact on the world around me.
I started eating vegan, whole foods within a week and immediately started 
to feel better. My headaches went away, the excess weight melted off, and I 
was clearheaded and energetic for the first time in years. I took my newfound 
passion for food and enrolled in a professional chef’s training program at the 
Natural Gourmet Institute in New York City.
I later realized I wanted to help people discover how to heal their own health 
problems with good food and dietary choices. Since graduating from the 
Institute for Integrative Nutrition, I have helped countless clients all over the 
world improve their health by including more plant-based options to their 
diets.

Living Vegan For Dummies 
About This Book
As more people are exposed to the realities of how our food is produced and 
processed and how it affects our health, eating a vegan diet becomes more 
popular as a way to follow a healthier, more vibrant path through life. World-
class athletes and popular musicians, actors, and artists achieve incredible 
levels of human fitness and create amazing works of art all while living a 
vegan life.
This book is for new vegans and the people who love them. It’s also for veg­
etarians who want to make the switch and lifelong carnivores who are curi­
ous about what a vegan is and what they eat. This book also can help comfort 
your friends and family by providing the information to quiet the fears of you 
wasting away to nothing by “living on lettuce.”
Even if you aren’t sure a vegan diet is right for you, this book can help you 
understand the amazing benefits of a plant-based diet. Including more veg­
etables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds is something we’re all 
encouraged to do by the FDA, USDA, and the ADA! Even Mom says so! If you 
want to improve your health, reduce your health concerns, lose weight, 
improve your energy and stamina, prolong your life expectancy, protect the 
environment, and save the lives of countless animals, this book is for you.
Living Vegan For Dummies provides an incredible amount of information that 
can be useful whether you read it from start to finish or not. Every chapter is 
written in easy-to-understand language and has distinct parts with helpful ref­
erences and lots of tips and real-world strategies. The recipes can help you 
enjoy vegan food even if you aren’t a trained chef. And most important, every 
chapter helps you get closer to a cruelty-free life.
Conventions Used in This Book
Following are a few conventions I’ve used that you should be aware of:
	
✓	Whenever I introduce you to a new food or term, I put it in italics.
	
✓	Keywords in bulleted lists or the action parts in numbered steps appear 
in boldface.
	
✓	Web sites appear in monofont.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t put in 
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So when using 
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, 
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
For Dummies books are full of useful extras that pop out at you while you’re 
reading. Fun facts and useful sidebars give you inspiration and ammunition 
for the vegan road ahead. You’ll notice this extra information highlighted 
with gray shaded boxes or Technical Stuff icons throughout the chapters. 
You can commit these items to memory to remind yourself and others of why 
this lifestyle is so amazing, or you can skip them and just dive into the infor­
mation that seems most important to you at the time. Just remember that 
this extra information is just that — extra. You don’t have to read it in order 
to understand the topic at hand.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made a few assumptions about you, the reader:
	
✓	You like to eat food, but you want to stop eating animal products.
	
✓	You like to wear clothes, but you want to stop wearing animal products.
	
✓	You like to wash and pamper your body, but you want to stop using 
products that contain animal ingredients or products that were tested 
on animals.
	
✓	When you buy something to use or consume, you often ask yourself or 
someone else “where did this come from?” or “what is this made of?” or 
“what am I contributing to when I buy this?”
	
✓	You have cooked a little or none at all, but you know you would like to 
start making some if not all your own food.
	
✓	You’re curious about how to maintain proper health while eating a 
vegan diet.
	
✓	You aren’t afraid to take a risk or be considered “weird” by the rest of 
society — most cool vegans are a little outside the mainstream, but 
that’s what we like to be!
If these assumptions spoke to you, you found yourself nodding your head 
while reading this list, or you can easily picture your loved one who wants to 
become a vegan, you’re reading the right book.

Living Vegan For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
Living Vegan For Dummies is divided into seven parts. Each part covers a 
different area of vegan living. Read through the description for each part 
and then go to the chapters that excite you the most. Every part works in 
conjunction with the others to help you build a vibrant, conscious, and deli­
ciously healthy life.
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning
Part I lays out what a vegan diet and lifestyle encompasses. It details the rea­
sons people choose to become vegan in the first place and covers the ways 
in which choosing a vegan diet can lead to better health for yourself and can 
protect animals and the planet. This part also discusses the ways to make the 
switch from a vegetarian or omnivorous diet to a healthy, plant-based, vegan 
diet.
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet
This part serves as your nutritional guide to creating a healthy meal plan. I 
show you how to include proper protein, calcium, iron, B12, and other nutri­
ents along with delicious vegan ingredients to ensure a well-rounded diet. An 
important feature of Part II is the lists of healthy, whole vegan foods. These 
lists help you choose foods to ensure that you’re getting the nutrition you 
need while eating a vegan diet.
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: 
Staying Vegan
The nuts and bolts of making a vegan diet work for you and your family are 
found in Part III. Here you can find all sorts of information, including cook­
ing tools you need to buy, tips on how to shop for and store food items, 
and guidelines for planning your meals for ease and success. This part also 
includes handy snack and shopping lists as well as ways to cook your old 
favorite foods in new, vegan ways. Finally it takes you beyond the kitchen to 
your bathroom and closets to help you find hidden animal ingredients and 
products that you want to avoid.

 Introduction
Part IV: Tasting Is Believing: 
Vegan Recipes
This part is where you find delicious, mouthwatering recipes for every part 
of the day. I include breakfasts for school and workdays, brunch ideas for lei­
surely weekend meals, smaller side dishes, one-pot meals for the beginner or 
time-pressed chef, and delicious desserts for everyone. For all these recipes, I 
call for vegan ingredients and provide you with simple-to-follow instructions.
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World
In this part, you take your first tentative steps outside of the happy vegan 
bubble you’ve created for yourself at home. The chapters here can help you 
make travel plans to see the rest of the world and remain a happily social 
vegan bon vivant even if you’re the only salad eater at a table full of steak 
lovers. This part also can help you throw your own vegan parties so you can 
share your newfound love of cruelty-free food with friends and family.
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life
Read this part to help plan and prepare for those special times in life that 
may require unique nutritional needs. This part describes how you can 
manage a healthy pregnancy, raise a fit baby and toddler, feed a growing 
athlete as well as deal with the special challenges of older vegans. It explains 
the benefits of a vegan diet for each phase of life and offers sound nutritional 
advice and strategies for success.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Commit these lists to memory! The information in this part comes in handy 
when you’re getting grilled by some meathead at a party, and it also offers 
handy lists that serve every person on the vegan path. In this part, you dis­
cover ten reasons for living vegan as well as ten exciting and inspiring ways 
to take your commitment out of the kitchen and into the great big world. You 
also receive answers to the most common questions you’ll hear as a vegan.

Where to Go from Here
If you aren’t sure where to begin your exploration of vegan living, start your 
journey at the beginning of this book and read every bit until you reach the 
back cover. On the other hand, if you can’t wait to eat great vegan food, skip 
ahead to the recipes in Chapters 12 through 15 and start cooking!
The great thing about this book is that you can choose the topics that are most 
important or interesting to you right now and jump into those areas — you 
don’t have to read this book from the beginning for it to work for you. This book 
covers every area of vegan living, but you don’t have to follow the information in 
order. Skip around, fast-forward, and rewind; do what works best for you. All the 
information is here for when you need it, in the order that you need it.
Whether you choose to go 100 percent vegan or just integrate several vegan 
meals a day, Chapters 9 through 11 can help you make better purchases. If 
you’re already shopping in health food stores, you can still find out more 
about the different labels given to vegan and cruelty-free products as listed in 
Chapter 7. You can start snacking and eating vegan meals on the fly with the 
snacking and shopping lists provided in Chapter 9.
A vegan life is full of fun, passion, and ethical consciousness made real with 
every meal, purchase, and product. Enjoy the journey of discovery, and take 
heart knowing that you’ve committed to one of the most responsible paths 
available in life! Be well, and here’s to your health!

Part I
“Ve-gan” at the 
Beginning

In this part . . .
I
f your whole life could be drawn on a map, vegan living 
encompasses not only the roads, intersections, and 
detours, it’s also the inspiration for your journey in the 
first place. Knowing what you’re going to encounter on 
this trip ensures that you don’t end up in the wilderness 
friendless and starving!
In this part, you can find the basics on what vegan living 
means. These chapters explain the solid logic of choosing 
this lifestyle and how to transition to it, including what you 
can eat and buy, the health and environmental benefits 
associated with it, and how to make the necessary changes 
from your current lifestyle.

Chapter 1
The Lowdown on Vegan 
Eating and Living
In This Chapter
▶	Making the connection between diet and health
▶	Building a whole vegan lifestyle
▶	Experiencing the spiritual side of veganism
▶	Responding to common questions about vegan living
A
 vegan is the ultimate, hard-core vegetarian. Someone who follows 
a vegan diet avoids eating, drinking, wearing, using, or otherwise 
consuming anything that contains animal ingredients or that was tested on 
animals. This means a vegan eats pretty much everything except dairy from 
cows, sheep, or goats, (or horses, if you’re ever visiting Mongolia), cheese, 
milk, butter, eggs, meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, or honey.
In this chapter, you discover the vast health benefits of a vegan diet, what 
vegan living entails, and how to deal with the common (and often ignorant) 
questions that people will likely ask you about your lifestyle choice.
You Are What You Eat: The Health 
and Food Connection
If you want to be vibrant, healthy, and full of energy, you should eat fresh, 
healthy, vibrant foods. If you feel bloated, tired, sluggish, and full of aches 
and pains, you should look to your diet first to see whether the culprits are 
hiding on your plate. Answer these questions to get a better sense of what’s 
really going on in your body:
	
✓	Do you feel tired and unfocused during the day?
	
✓	Do you use caffeine to help you wake up in the morning?

10
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
	
✓	Do you have sugar, caffeine, or salt cravings?
	
✓	Do you drink regular or diet soda?
	
✓	Do you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol (or both)?
	
✓	Are you overweight or obese?
	
✓	Do you get bloated or have stomach cramps after eating?
	
✓	Do you often have headaches, depression, or moody outbursts?
	
✓	Do you eat most of your food from fast-food joints, packages, or boxes?
	
✓	Do you have problems with constipation or diarrhea?
	
✓	Do you eat fried foods often?
	
✓	Do you have skin problems like acne, eczema, or rashes?
If you answered yes to even a few of these questions, your diet needs a seri­
ous cleanup.
	
Moving to a vegan diet that’s based on whole, unprocessed grains, beans, veg­
etables, and fruits, with some nuts and seeds thrown in, will give your body 
everything it needs to heal and recuperate from years of abuse. The benefits 
are clear, and it isn’t difficult to figure out how to eat this way.
If you want to live a life of high-energy, peak experiences, and accomplish 
your biggest goals and dreams, you need a diet that will fuel your body to 
meet those challenges. Meet the challenges without meat!
Heart-healthy, low-fat, 
cholesterol-free foods
Place your hand over your heart and feel it beating. Say out loud, “Thank you, 
heart, for always beating even though I don’t always treat you so well. From 
now on, I promise not to be so hard on you.”
Vegans, as a group, have healthier blood pressure levels and a lower risk for 
heart disease. Several major studies have shown that vegans and vegetarians 
are 15 to 20 percent less likely to die from heart disease than meat eaters.
If you have high blood pressure, just use a whole-foods, vegan diet for two 
weeks, and then get retested — you’ll most likely show an improvement. 
Plant foods are lower in fat and sodium and higher in potassium (a mineral 
that helps to lower blood pressure) than meat- and dairy-based foods. These 
are key reasons why switching to a vegan diet will improve your heart health.
Because vegan foods are naturally free of cholesterol, your arteries are less 
likely to get clogged up with the stuff. Humans do need cholesterol for many 

11
 Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Vegan Eating and Living
different functions, but the human body produces what it needs. Animal 
products are the biggest sources of cholesterol in modern diets, so eating a 
diet rich in whole, vegan foods cuts out the clogs pretty quickly. Not only will 
eating a low-fat, high-fiber vegan diet help you avoid heart disease, it’s also 
been proven to reverse atherosclerosis, or the hardening of the arteries.
Feeling fine with fiber
Fiber is the part of plant foods that our bodies can’t digest. Not being able 
to digest something sounds bad, but it’s actually excellent! All that fiber gets 
mashed up by your chewing and fills up your stomach, leading to a feeling 
of fullness when you eat more of the healthy complex carbohydrates. Simple 
carbohydrates, like white bread, rice, pasta, and sugar, have little fiber, so 
they get digested quickly and you don’t fill up on them.
Not only does fiber fill you up quickly, but it also cleans you out when it 
moves through your intestines. Moving things out fast is a must for overall 
health! This “fiber brush” effect scrapes out the food particles that can get 
stuck in the nooks and crannies of your gastrointestinal system. All this 
fiber means more elimination, which is a great way to keep the body clean 
and devoid of rotting material. One of the negative effects of a diet heavy in 
simple carbohydrates and meat is the huge amount of leftover rotting flesh 
and pasty glue stuck in people’s colons. The fiber brush effect is one of the 
main reasons why vegans have less colon cancer.
	
As vegans avoid the modern, processed diet and go for the veggie-based one, 
they get abundant vitamins, phytochemicals (chemical compounds found in 
plant foods that have health-promoting properties), and fiber associated with 
lower cancer rates.
If you’re eating a whole-foods based diet, you’re already taking in more fiber 
than the average person. The vegetables with the highest amounts of fiber 
are artichokes, beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbages, carrots, egg­
plant, leafy green vegetables, mushrooms, potatoes with the skin, pumpkin, 
peppers, rhubarb, spinach, and sweet potatoes. High-fiber fruits include 
apples, avocados, bananas, berries, dried fruit, guava, kiwi, oranges, pears, 
and prunes. Whole grains, nuts, and seeds also are good sources of fiber.
The American Heart Association and the Institute of Medicine recommend 
that adults consume 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories eaten. For 
vegans, this level is no problem to achieve: 1 cup of peas has almost 9 grams; 
1 cup of black beans has 19 grams; 1 banana has 3 grams; 1⁄2 cup of blackber­
ries has more than 4 grams; and 1 tablespoon of shredded coconut has more 
than 3 grams. Vegan food is fiber-rific!

12
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
The power of proper protein
Vegan protein offers so much more than the building blocks for muscles. 
Because they have other magical components like fiber, complex carbohy­
drates, minerals, and vitamins, you can actually heal your body with vegan pro­
tein sources. In fact, according to the American Dietetic Association, a vegan 
diet “may be useful in the prevention and treatment of [kidney] disease . . .”
So while you’re getting all the amino acids you need from your well-planned 
and diverse vegan diet, you can feel confident that you’re also adding the 
natural healing components of plant foods. Eating truly healing and nutrition­
ally dense foods — now that’s smart!
The healing power of plant foods
Food was the first medicine, and a vegan’s “kitchen pharmacy” can be well 
planned to help prevent and treat illness. Traditional healers and doctors 
used willow bark to treat fevers and inflammation for centuries before sci­
ence discovered that the bark was teeming with salicylic acid, which is the 
inspiration and foundation of aspirin. This drug has been prescribed to 
people with cardiovascular problems for decades.
Raw foodists and macrobiotics
Just when you thought veganism couldn’t get 
any more specific, here come the raw food­
ists and macrobiotics. Two distinct sects of the 
“vegan religion,” raw foodists and followers of 
the macrobiotic diet choose to eat plant-based 
diets that are prepared a certain way and avoid 
even more ingredients than a straight-up vegan.
A raw foodist eats uncooked or slightly pre­
pared foods that can be warmed in dehydra­
tors to only as much as 118 degrees Fahrenheit. 
While some raw foodists do eat raw fish such 
as sushi, or even raw chicken, eggs, or meat, a 
majority of these folks are vegan.
Macrobiotics eat a diet based on traditional 
Japanese foods, which can be slightly adjusted 
to include local ingredients. As with raw food­
ists, many Macrobiotics include fish in their 
diets, but a good percentage avoid all animal 
foods and are vegans. These vegans tend to 
eat mostly cooked food with a focus on whole 
grains like brown rice, and tend to avoid tropi­
cal and raw fruits.
People tend to choose one of these diets for 
health, spiritual, or environmental reasons, and 
many documented cases from both diets have 
been shown to cure diseases, including cancer, 
diabetes, heart disease, obesity, arthritis, 
digestive problems, and depression. While the 
two diets seem to be in complete opposition to 
each other (one is almost 100 percent raw and 
the other is almost 100 percent cooked) they’re 
both rich in health-promoting plant foods and 
can be useful to people experiencing health 
problems.

 Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Vegan Eating and Living
Here are a few foods that have been studied medicinally over the years:
	
✓	Green leafy vegetables from the cruciferous, or cabbage, family: 
These vegetables are known to help the body fight cancer growth. 
Broccoli, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, and kale are 
all part of this group, so dig in. Not only do these greens offer great can­
cer-fighting properties, they’re also rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. 
Eating these veggies is a win-win-win!
	
✓	Ginger and turmeric: These spices have been the most studied botani­
cals in recent years. They have incredible healing properties and can 
easily be worked into your daily diet. Ginger is used for nausea, diges­
tion disturbances, gas, and reducing the effects of chemotherapy. 
Turmeric, a spice common in Indian cooking, is used for improving liver 
function, arthritis pain, reducing inflammation, and heartburn as well as 
in cancer treatment and prevention.
	
✓	Garlic: This powerful food can be used as a natural antibiotic and anti­
fungal agent. As well as having anticarcinogenic and antibacterial attri­
butes, garlic is used to treat ear infections, sinus problems, high blood 
pressure, and cholesterol.
	
✓	Mushrooms: Edible mushrooms aren’t just a great meat replacement for 
vegans. They’re a powerful class of medicinal foods. Mushrooms and 
their extracts are used to treat cancer, strengthen the immune system, 
and reduce inflammatory conditions.
These foods are only a few of thousands of plants, herbs, and spices used 
for centuries to heal and protect human health. By relying on these powerful 
plant-based foods, your kitchen truly can be a natural pharmacy.
Living Vegan Beyond Your Diet
Veganism doesn’t stop at the dinner table — it leaps out of the kitchen and 
transforms your whole life. From what you wear to the products you buy to 
beautify yourself and your home, vegan living encompasses every aspect of 
your daily life.
Fierce, fabulous, fur-free fashion
A full vegan lifestyle not only includes a diet of solely plant-based foods, it 
also is dedicated to avoiding harming any living creature for any type of fash­
ion product, whether it be handbags, shoes, sweaters, belts, or coats. Most 
vegans don’t buy new leather, wool, or silk. Chapter 11 shows how vegan 
fashion can be fun and fabulous without being cruel.

Keepin’ it real at home
Home is where the heart is, and a vegan home takes every purchase to a 
deeper level. Your home should reflect your beliefs by offering sanctuary, 
entertainment, and space to nourish and nurture yourself and your family 
according to your values.
Learn to express your individual style as a vegan at home using cruelty-free 
materials and decorations. Cleaning your home, making up your face, and wash­
ing your hair take on new significance when you use products that are nontoxic 
and not tested on animals. The labels and brands discussed in Chapter 11 can 
help you choose fantastic products that work for your home, body, and morals.
Staying vegan in a nonvegan world
	
After you know that you want to live a vegan life full of integrity, you may find 
areas of cruelty-free living that you just don’t know anything about. Part III 
illustrates the nuts and bolts of daily life as a plant-food lover. Knowing how 
to shop for food, cook it, and make it delicious are the most important, basic, 
vegan skills a person can have. Even if you can’t boil water or your cupboards 
are as bare as Mother Hubbard’s, Chapter 7 can walk you through the steps of 
creating a basic vegan kitchen.
Living in a vegan bubble with vegan friends who love to make vegan food 
would be ideal, but many of us live in “mixed families” of meat and veggie 
heads. The combining of food ethics at home can be tricky, but Chapter 8 
helps you navigate the choppy waters of sharing a kitchen with a carnivore.
Living a vegan life can be challenging if you don’t map out a plan in advance. 
So, like a five-star general plotting a path through enemy territory, wise 
vegans ensure their success by learning how to strategize. Chapter 9 shares 
menu suggestions, healthy vegan snack lists, and shopping and meal plan­
ning guides. Integrating these blueprints on a regular basis takes the stress 
out of shopping, cooking, and living a busy, modern life.
Energetically Speaking: The Spiritual 
Side of Veganism
Various religions around the world have specific dietary rules to demon­
strate their faith. Some religions avoid pork products or alcohol and others 

15
 Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Vegan Eating and Living
set aside certain days for fasting. The spiritual side of food has a long history 
that vegans can adopt to create a deeper connection with other people and 
animals.
Here are just a few of the many religions that have adopted vegan or vegetar­
ian lifestyles:
	
✓	Buddhism: Buddhists believe that every person should try to mini­
mize the harm that they inflict on all beings. This belief has led several 
Buddhist sects to live vegan lifestyles. Cultivating a “pure heart” by 
making the extra effort to be as compassionate as possible easily trans­
lates into avoiding eating meat and other animal products.
	
✓	Jainism: Jainism is an ancient religion from India that has conscious 
nonviolence at the center of its dinner plates. Even though most of the 
Jain are vegetarians and do eat dairy or eggs, growing numbers are 
becoming vegan. Spiritual followers of this dharma religion believe that 
to be truly nonviolent, they must avoid enslaving or mistreating animals 
in order to take their milk or eggs.
	
✓	Seventh-day Adventism: Seventh-day Adventists are Christian vegetar­
ians who have been well-studied for their dietary choices and health. 
These religious vegetarians and vegans believe that “demonstrating 
reason and restraint in daily life” by avoiding meat, tobacco, alcohol, 
and illicit drugs brings them closer to God. These Bible passages often 
are quoted to justify their food choices:
 
• “I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face 
of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seeds; to you it 
shall be for food.” (Genesis 1:29)
 
• “And you will eat the plants of the field.” (Genesis 3:18)
 
• “But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye 
not eat.” (Genesis 9:4)
	
	Following these Biblical guidelines, most Seventh-day Adventists are 
vegetarian, but many are becoming vegan as they further develop their 
spiritual beliefs.
For the rest of us vegans who don’t belong to a specific religious group, the 
spiritual side of a plant-based diet encompasses many traditions. Every meal 
or bite brings with it an awareness of the pain and suffering that we’re pre­
venting for other creatures. Vegans know they’re making a difference every 
day in the lives of others, and they take much pleasure and happiness in 
that. By constantly cultivating compassion, vegans protect the lives of other 
humans, animals, and the wide world around us.

Tackling Common Questions 
about Veganism
Vegans answer questions on a weekly basis about their choice to avoid 
animal products — so get familiar with the facts and get comfortable explain­
ing your logic and actions. Chapter 26 even lists the most common questions 
you’ll hear along with plenty of information to stop your inquisitors in their 
tracks!
Why on earth would you live like that?
Vegans see the bigger picture when it comes to making a difference with 
small, daily actions. For those who may not readily understand this concept, 
you can just brag about how much healthier you’re eating with a vegan diet.
Besides, most Americans are just sick and tired. According to the National 
Center for Health Statistics, more than 34 percent of Americans are obese, 
and another 32 percent are overweight — that means 66 percent of the adults 
in this country could stand to lose more than a few pounds! The numbers 
of children that are obese and overweight are just as bad. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control, 32 percent of children in the United States are 
overweight, and 16 percent are obese. A whopping 11 percent of children are 
extremely obese.
	
All those extra pounds cause more problems than just making it difficult to 
find jeans that fit right. The top causes of death in America are heart disease, 
cancer, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, and diabetes. If 
you’re overweight but wearing your seat belt and a helmet, you’re still more 
likely to die because you’re eating a high-fat, refined diet.
The good news is that lettuce-loving vegans tend to be on the skinnier side 
without much effort. Some vegans are overweight, but it’s a much smaller 
percentage of the population, consisting of around 11 percent. Membership 
in the vegan club has its privileges!
Not only are vegans less likely to be overweight or obese, they’re also health­
ier overall compared to the general meat-eating population. Modern dairy 
and meat products have been proven to contribute to the growing numbers 
of people with colon, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers. A study from 

17
 Chapter 1: The Lowdown on Vegan Eating and Living
Harvard University showed that regular meat consumption increased a per­
son’s risk of developing colon cancer by about 300 percent. Eating a diet high 
in fat causes the human body to produce more estrogen hormones, which 
have been linked to breast cancer.
	
The good news for vegans is clear: Even if you’re choosing to eat a cruelty-free 
diet for ethical or environmental reasons, you’ll still gain substantial health 
benefits. And improving your own health gives you the stamina needed to 
create a healthier, more positive world for the rest of life’s creatures!
What can a vegan eat?
As you transition to veganism, you’re bound to hear people say, “You don’t 
eat dairy? Or meat? What do you eat?” For strangely deep, emotional reasons, 
people will get passionately weird about your eating choices, but don’t let 
this scare or deter you.
	
The world is ripe with vegan options if you know how to look for them. And 
more than 300 vegan cookbooks are on the market, so you’ll never be at a loss 
for inspiration or delicious recipes. Table 1-1 provides a sample of vegan foods 
that most people eat regularly without realizing it. Included in the table are 
the nutrients that those vegan dishes provide.
To get started with your vegan culinary skills, check out Part IV. These 
chapters offer delicious, healthy vegan recipes to get you through breakfast, 
lunch, and dinner as well as snacks and desserts.
Is it a balanced diet?
At first you and your family may question whether you can get all the nutri­
tion you need from a plant-based diet. The answer is absolutely! Protein, 
calcium, iron, and B12 are the main nutrients that newbie vegans need to pay 
attention to — and it’s so easy to get enough from whole grains, beans, nuts, 
seeds, vegetables, fruit, and a couple of supplemental foods or vitamins.
Not only do vegans get enough protein, calcium, and iron, they get more 
fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, and phytochemicals than nonvegans. That’s 
because they tend to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables! Chapter 4 uncov­
ers the truths about bone health, the mysteries behind common diet-induced 
diseases, and options for nutritional healing.

Understanding the Impact 
of Vegan Living
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the environmental effects of raising animals for food
▶	Looking at what really happens to animals raised for consumption
▶	Avoiding circuses and zoos
F
our main areas of thinking inspire people to become vegan: health and 
environmental reasons, treatment of animals, and spiritual beliefs. These 
four main points have something grand in common — a deep, empathetic 
caring for others.
If you’ve chosen to live a vegan lifestyle, you’ve probably thought a lot about 
the impact your choices have on the world around you. As a conscious con­
sumer and citizen of the world, you’ve begun to understand that everything 
you eat, do, buy, and use has an effect on someone else beside yourself. This 
understanding is what makes vegans the ultimate eco-warriors and agents of 
change.
In this chapter, I discuss the basic truths about the negative impacts that 
factory farming and animal consumption can have on people’s health, on the 
environment, and, of course, on the animals themselves. This chapter also 
sheds light on how a vegan lifestyle helps to counteract these negatives.
Straight Talk about the Ecological 
Impact of Animal Protein
The practice of raising animals for human consumption is nothing new. 
The earliest trace of livestock being kept for slaughter dates back several 
thousand years and continues today around the world. However, only in the 
last 200 years has large-scale animal agribusiness been taking place in huge 

20
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
feedlots and ranches across the globe. These factory farms are called con­
centrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs. This animal agribusiness has 
created systems of raising, slaughtering, and transporting animals so that 
the production of flesh foods can reach ever-higher quantities to satisfy the 
growing appetite for meat, poultry, fish, and dairy.
Tied together with rising animal production comes the rising ecological 
impact of these industries. Massive swaths of land are required to raise 
cattle, chickens, pigs, and other food animals. Countless tons of clean water 
are needed for these animals to drink, bathe in, and wash away their waste. 
Air quality is degraded in ranching and farming communities because of the 
huge amount of waste created by animals housed so closely together. This 
section details the effect that animal farming has on water and air quality.
	
By choosing to live a vegan life, you’re sending a clear message that you 
understand how your choices affect the world around you, and you choose to 
be a force for positive change! Food production can be accomplished with less 
dangerous methods and more humane treatment of animals and people.
	
Before eating your vegan meals, say a heartfelt prayer of hope for every living 
critter on earth. The animals could use the psychic blessings, and even our 
meat-eating friends need a little spiritual support in this day and age.
Water pollution and water scarcity
When large numbers of animals are kept in a contained area, something has 
to be done with their waste. Many factory farms use huge man-made pools or 
lagoons to store the animal-made waste. These cesspools, as big as 7 acres 
and containing 20 to 45 million gallons of wastewater, break or overflow all 
the time, allowing dangerous pollution, fecal microbes, hormones, drug-resis­
tant bacteria, and antibiotics into the local water supply. Often these pools 
are close to natural waterways, so the escaped sludge simply gets washed 
downstream into the nearest river, lake, or ocean. The laws protecting our 
water supplies, especially where it comes to factory farming, are weak, so 
little enforcement is available to protect the land and waterways.
The huge quantities of manure in the waterways contain dangerous amounts 
of salts, heavy metals, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Enormous dead zones are 
created when these lagoons burst into local waterways. After being released 
into open water, these contaminants feed algae blooms, which rob the water 
of oxygen, killing fish, plants, and other wildlife. Farm-animal waste also can 
carry dangerous microorganisms that have been linked to massive fish kills 
in coastal waters around the United States.

21
 Chapter 2: Understanding the Impact of Vegan Living
Factory-farm manure not only causes water pollution, but it also causes 
water scarcity. Industrial animal agriculture requires massive amounts of 
groundwater for cleaning facilities, cooling animals in hot weather, and pro­
viding drinking water for the animals. According to the United Nations’ Food 
and Agricultural Organization (FAO), countries around the world and large 
areas of the United States are seeing reduced water capacity for food produc­
tion as well as industrial and human consumption. The main culprit is indus­
trial agriculture and the animal factory farms, which account globally for 70 
percent of all water usage. In short, we’re running out of clean drinking water 
and irrigation water because we’re using it to raise animals for slaughter. 
Vegan diet, anyone?
Fish farms have been hailed as the answer to overfishing the oceans. Sadly, 
these contained areas are creating pollution and abuse issues of their own. 
Up to a million fish, including salmon and trout, can be farmed in one penned 
area. The fish waste is concentrated and allowed to settle like untreated 
sewage into the surrounding ocean. The pollution is so bad that most other 
fish and marine life are forced from the area, creating an ocean desert. The 
farmed fish carry diseases like sea lice, which then infect other free-swim­
ming fish, destroying wild stocks.
	
The most absurd part of this equation is that fish farms grind up so many wild 
fish to feed to the farmed fish that more fish are destroyed than are created. It 
takes more than 2 pounds of wild fish to produce 1 pound of farmed salmon. 
This math shows that fish farms exacerbate the very problem they were cre­
ated to solve.
The connection between livestock production 
and global warming
In 2006, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) published a report titled 
“Livestock’s Long Shadow — Environmental 
Issues and Options.” In this report, Henning 
Steinfeld, the senior author of the report and 
head of FAO’s Livestock Information and 
Policy Branch said, “Livestock are one of the 
most significant contributors to today’s most 
serious environmental problems. Urgent action 
is required to remedy the situation.” Livestock 
production was deemed to be a bigger threat 
and contributor to global warming than pollu­
tion from cars. So, it’s true: It’s more environ­
mentally friendly to be an SUV-driving vegan 
than it is to be a Prius-driving meat eater!

22
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
Toxic odor and air pollution
Smell something funny? It’s probably the animal farm down the road. CAFOs 
jam together huge numbers of large animals that produce lots of odor. These 
odors from animal gas, waste lagoons, and waste treatment methods com­
bine to form pollution clouds that threaten human health and the surround­
ing environment. Sadly the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and most 
states have done little to regulate these emissions. Being vegan means being 
part of the solution instead of part of the problem — keep choosing that tofu 
scramble over the eggs Benedict!
Odors from all this waste can be stifling. The unbearable smells from large-
scale animal agriculture cause a wide range of respiratory illnesses, fatigue, 
and depression. They also affect land values, leaving some homeowners 
stuck with property they can’t sell.
What if, like CAFOs, you had millions of pounds of waste to dispose of every 
year? One method these farms use is to simply spray the liquid and solid 
waste into the air like a volcanic fountain in hopes that the wind and weather 
will disperse it. Hardly. Instead, surrounding humans are being showered in 
fine particles of waste.
	
People who live near waste disposal fountains experience breathing problems, 
asthma, and bronchitis as a direct result of exposure to the high concen­
tration of particulates in the air. Animal waste contains ammonia, which is 
released into the air from lagoons, spray-field applications, and barns.
As you can see, besides helping spare their four-legged friends from becom­
ing dinner, vegans also score high humanitarian points for protecting their 
fellow two-legged friends from being negatively affected by these nasty prac­
tices, too!
Mountains of manure
Some CAFOs pile animal manure into areas where it can then be used or 
redistributed. The laws governing waste-use on the land are too gray to really 
protect the environment and humans living around these large-scale opera­
tions. These manure piles can cause massive fly outbreaks and attract coy­
otes and rats if dead animals are in the piles. When placed near residential 
homes, the air quality is of course intensely affected.
Disease is spread through animal waste, and all humans are in danger of get­
ting sick, even if they don’t eat meat. Dairy cow operations have discharged 
manure onto piles of hay; that manure can then leach into the soil and sur­
rounding water table and into county drains, contaminating large areas with 
dangerous levels of E. coli bacteria. The massive spinach recalls in 2006 due 

23
 Chapter 2: Understanding the Impact of Vegan Living
to E. coli were ultimately linked to animal waste from a nearby CAFO. Many 
health experts agree that a majority of intestinal reactions that humans have 
are caused by campylobacter, E. coli, listeria, and salmonella.
	
Bacteria in and on our foods are a health concern, but so are the man-made 
chemicals that are used to produce those foods. According to the EPA, more 
than 160 chemicals are found in and around manure from confined animal 
feeding operations. Growth hormones used to increase milk production in 
dairy cows, antibiotics, cleaning solvents to sanitize the barns, blood, oils and 
chemicals used to clean and maintain equipment, and copper sulfate are just a 
few of the possible contaminants found in animal manure.
When you’re vegan, you can rest assured that your veggie burgers and fries 
aren’t adding to this distasteful situation.
Having Reverence for All Life
Living a vegan lifestyle makes real the respect you hold for the well-being of 
all animals, including humans. Eating a vegan diet goes a long way toward 
providing every living creature with enough food to eat, clean water to drink, 
and clean air to breathe.
The deepest eco-consciousness is reached when no creature is killed or 
harmed for your lifestyle. By choosing not to eat animals or their products, 
or pay to watch them perform, vegans choose to live in ways that respect 
all life. It’s soul-satisfying to look at the natural world around you and feel at 
peace with your place in it.
Taking action against food injustice and 
malnutrition around the world
Malnutrition is a major killer of infants and children around the world. The 
saddest part of this tragedy is that many of these deaths are totally prevent­
able. We have plenty of food to go around, but that food is unequally distrib­
uted. While many humans go hungry because of corrupt governments, war, 
and famine, we also feed too much grain and other vegetable food to animals 
being raised for meat. If we all stopped eating meat, we would have enough 
food for all the humans on this planet, and then some.
Not only would more calories be available for human consumption, but more 
land would be available to raise more food. Arable land, or land that’s suit­
able to grow crops, is often used to raise animals instead.

24
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
Pigs, cows, chickens, and fish need to eat in order to become dense enough 
for slaughter and to become our food. These animals naturally eat grains, 
grasses, fruits, and vegetables — the same foods that humans can live on. 
But in order for a cow to get big enough for us to eat or milk it, the cow must 
eat many more calories than it will produce for us to consume.
	
Estimates vary, but it could take anywhere from 3 to 16 pounds of grain to 
produce one pound of beef. According to the United States Department of 
Agriculture’s educational pamphlet for children, cows eat up to 100 pounds 
of mixed feed a day and drink up to 30 to 50 gallons of fresh water a day. This 
equation doesn’t add up in a world where so many humans are starving for 
food and thirsting for clean drinking water.
The beauty of veganism is that you get to enjoy healthy, delicious food while 
knowing that your choices aren’t harming anyone else. Eating lower on the 
food chain means that your vegan diet increases the amount of food available 
for other people.
Standing up for animals
Meat eaters are often animal lovers — they love their dogs, cats, hamsters, 
and other pets. These companion animals are allowed to eat at the table 
(or at least in the house), and are even dressed up and paraded around as 
a source of pride. Most people would never consider eating their pets. Why 
then is this love and affection not extended to animals that humans raise to 
serve as food?
The harsh reality of how agricultural animals are treated is simply too heavy 
for many people to endure, so they just choose not to think about it. Others 
believe that animals don’t feel pain or psychological trauma the way that 
humans do, which excuses any harsh treatment. Vegans know that animals 
are our companions in life and that they deserve respect and care no matter 
what form they take.
	
The laws that protect companion animals, such as dogs and cats, from inhu­
mane treatment and mistreatment don’t apply to most of the millions of farm 
animals that are raised as food for humans.
Saying no to animal-based food and clothing
Vegans are pretty savvy to the marketing magic that advertisers flash on 
screen, and we choose to confront the realities of animal agriculture by 
enjoying plant foods instead. Farm animals are rarely protected from modern 
factory-farming techniques, which inflict pain and discomfort and keep the 
animals from their natural social tendencies. Following are a few examples:
	
✓	Cattle: Cows raised for beef generally have more time outside than their 
female relatives. But these cows don’t escape torture and pain. Beef 

25
 Chapter 2: Understanding the Impact of Vegan Living
calves are usually dehorned, males are castrated, and many of these ani­
mals are burned with searing brands. After cattle reach market weight, 
they’re stunned with a severe knock to the head, bled, and skinned. Many 
wake up from being stunned during the final stages of their slaughtering.
	
✓	Chickens: Most chickens raised for consumption never see the light 
of day — they live their entire lives in a warehouse-style factory farm. 
Packed into tiny cages with several other chickens, they aren’t able to 
raise their wings or follow their natural instincts of pecking and scratch­
ing the ground. So they peck and scratch each other. This can cause too 
much damage to valuable poultry, so the chickens are debeaked at a 
young age, which, as you can imagine, is a painful process.
	
✓	Pigs: Because of their huge size, farmed pigs are kept from hurting each 
other by being forced to live most of their lives in crates. They can’t turn 
around or walk more than a few steps forward or backward. Pregnant 
sows are kept in farrowing crates, which gives them just enough space 
to deliver and suckle their litters. These incredibly inhumane crates 
have horrified enough voters that California, Florida, and Arizona have 
finally made them illegal.
Meat and dairy aren’t the only items to be avoided. Leather is another one of 
the many products culled from the meat industry. This isn’t the only animal 
skin that humans wear either. Fur farms raise many types of animals for their 
skins, including mink, chinchillas, and foxes. Kept in small, confined cages, 
these animals are killed as quickly and cheaply as possible. Anal electrocu­
tion, lethal injection of poisons, violent shaking, and beating are routine 
methods to kill these animals.
Why dairy isn’t okay, and why vegans 
are the only true vegetarians
Dairy cows are separated from their babies 
within a day or two after giving birth. The female 
calves become dairy producers while the male 
calves become veal. By drinking cow’s milk 
(even organic), humans are contributing to the 
death of veal calves. The mother cows bellow 
and cry for their babies, much like any human 
would. They’re continually drugged with hor­
mones to force their bodies to continue produc­
ing milk. And they’re milked by machines long 
after they would have stopped naturally. And 
to top it off, they’re given antibiotics to stave 
off infection from their poor, crowded living 
conditions.
They stand up in cramped stalls, in artificially lit 
warehouses, with little to no access to the out­
doors, for most of their lives. The constant cycle 
of forced pregnancy and milking leads to a 
severely shortened lifespan. Cows naturally live 
to the age of 15 or 20 years old. A factory farmed 
cow usually lives to the age of 4 to 6. After her 
milk production starts to wane, a dairy cow is 
most often turned into hamburger. This cycle 
makes vegetarians (who consume dairy prod­
ucts) complicit in the killing of animals, even if 
they aren’t eating the meat itself. Avoiding dairy 
products means vegans aren’t contributing to 
the pain and suffering of these gentle giants.

26
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
Not only are they raised and killed with terrible methods, but these fur ani­
mals also are adding to the wave of pollution pouring out of factory farms. 
Fur and leather processing is a toxic industry in which the animal skins 
are treated with a chemical soup to keep them from shedding and rotting. 
Ammonia, formaldehyde, bleaching agents, acids, and chromium wastes are 
just a few of the chemicals that make leather tanning and fur processing an 
environmental disaster.

efits of living vegan! See Chapter 11 for tips on vegan fashions.
Staying away from circuses and zoos
Circus and zoo animals live a bizarre and trapped existence. The training 
necessary to create an animal circus performer often requires violence and 
pain. Elephants, tigers, bears, and horses can be trained with whips, muzzles, 
electric prods, tight collars, and sharp hooks.
The deeply held belief that we as humans are far superior to any other crea­
ture allows us to torture and abuse these thinking, feeling creatures. Many 
countries around the world, including Austria, Costa Rica, India, Finland, 
Singapore, and Sweden have either banned or restricted the use of animals 
for entertainment. Because you’re sensitive to the realities of the world, as a 
vegan you’ll most likely want to avoid animal circuses and zoos. Luckily, sev­
eral popular and stunning human circuses like Cirque du Soleil can provide 
vegans with fantastic humane entertainment!
While zoos and wildlife enclosures seem to be a kind method to connect 
humans with the natural world, what goes on behind the scenes can be 
cruel. Charges have been brought against some zoos and zookeepers for the 
trauma, stress, physical harm, and unnecessary discomfort inflicted on zoo 
animals. Some zoos also sell off animals to circuses. At least one instance was 
documented where the Minnesota Zoo sold more than 100 animals from its 
petting zoo to a slaughterhouse.
	
There are more humane ways to enjoy watching the majesty of animals. For 
instance, farm animal sanctuaries can be found all over the country. These 
kind operations rescue farm animals that have escaped factory farms or that 
were given away by their owners. Some wild animal sanctuaries take care of 
retired circus and zoo animals as well, offering them a safe place to live until 
they die. Nature programs, documentaries, and the Internet can be used to 
research and discover the beauty of the animal kingdom. To find a farm animal 
sanctuary, go to www.farmanimalshelters.org and look for a shelter 
near you!

Chapter 3
Transforming to Veganism
In This Chapter
▶	Deciding whether giving up nonvegan foods all at once is for you
▶	Understanding why making the switch slowly may be more effective
▶	Following some basic guidelines when giving up meat and dairy
C
hanging your whole diet and lifestyle from the standard, modern 
method of doing things to a vegan way can be challenging without 
the proper planning. For most new vegans, their metamorphosis means 
more than just saying so long to hot dogs and ham and cheese sandwiches. 
Because this lifestyle encompasses health concerns, a deep environmen­
talism, and a way of caring about animals’ rights that is outside the norm, 
becoming vegan involves every aspect of a person’s life. But this way of living 
and being in the world will bring personal, emotional, physical, and global 
benefits.
No one can tell you how exactly these changes will occur in your life, because 
each individual has a unique set of circumstances to consider. Who you live 
with, where you live, what your job is like, and how much support you have 
all make a difference. If you’re a butcher in Wisconsin, for example, you’ve 
got your work cut out for you. This chapter can help you decide when and 
how to make the switch from a meat and dairy diet to a vegan one. Just 
remember that every step forward toward a vegan lifestyle, whether fast or 
slow, is a positive step for yourself and the greater world around you.
Going Cold Tofurky
If going cold Tofurky is your preferred method of vegan transition, be aware 
that you may have some slip-ups. Don’t beat yourself up over a bacon 
cheeseburger a few weeks in. A full transition will take time. In fact, you may 
find in the end that it’s more difficult to live a completely vegan lifestyle 
with all the clothing, furniture, and products necessary than just focusing on 
eating a vegan diet.

Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
	
Just keep in mind that staying positive and keeping a creative mindset are 
important character traits when trying to endure any setbacks or challenges.
The pros of converting quickly
Immediately getting rid of every morsel of meat or dollop of dairy can be a 
really satisfying experience on many different fronts. Consider these benefits 
of converting quickly:
	
✓	You may notice the health benefits quickly. For someone who has 
health problems that are exacerbated by meat, has excess weight to 
lose, or is sensitive or allergic to dairy, this method can yield near imme­
diate positive feelings. Imagine that you’ve been having asthma, a runny 
nose, or allergies for years, and then all of a sudden your phlegm disap­
pears because you stopped drinking milk and eating cheese just a few 
days ago — it’s a terrific feeling, and you’ll want it to continue. How’s 
that for an incentive?
	
✓	You can be relieved that you’re no longer contributing to animal cru­
elty. If animal rights and the moral issues behind veganism are an impor­
tant part of your decision, you’ll immediately feel so much better about 
eating food that doesn’t contribute to the pain and suffering of others. 
When you realize how inhumanely animals are raised and feel compas­
sion for the creatures that humans eat, it can be really heartbreaking to 
continue eating them yourself. So making the switch quickly will be a 
huge relief to your conscience.
	
✓	You can be energized by the change in lifestyle. Many people find it fun 
and exciting to have a life full of purpose and a new way of doing their 
daily deeds. Buying different foods, exploring new shops and Web sites, 
and discovering the complexities of a vegan life can feel truly energizing.
The cons of going too fast
	
Adopting the vegan way of doing things too quickly can be dizzying with its com­
plexities and new rules. Keep in mind some of the drawbacks to moving too fast:
	
✓	Your health may initially be affected and can cause you to crash 
and burn or get sick during a busy workweek. Detoxing from meat 
and dairy foods is a possible side effect when you choose to go vegan. 
When the body stops storing the constant influx of unhealthy fats and 
proteins, it will finally have a chance to let go and cleanse. This cleans­
ing can be physically uncomfortable and may result in headaches, 
acne, tiredness, or the urge to invade small countries. Your digestive 
system may not be accustomed to such large amounts of fiber, so you 
also could notice some bloating and increased bowel movements at the 
beginning of your transition.

29
 Chapter 3: Transforming to Veganism
	
✓	You may go broke trying to replace every animal product in your 
home. Donating or throwing away everything that was tested on or was 
once part of an animal can leave your cupboards bare and your house 
and closets empty. Replacing the leather sofa costs money as will filling 
up your refrigerator with vegan food. Think about how much you need 
to throw out to be truly vegan — and how much money you’ll need to 
spend to replace it.
	
✓	You may make mistakes if you don’t do the proper research before­
hand. You’re probably going to mess up in the first few weeks of being 
vegan. If you go too quickly and don’t research all the foods, ingredients, 
and products you buy and use, you may continue using things that were 
tested on animals or that use animal ingredients. Still, messing up isn’t a 
good reason to give up — if you trip going down the stairs, do you swear 
off stairs forever? No. You get up, dust yourself off, and start walking 
down again. Keep it up, and you’ll figure it out. And eventually you’ll be 
sliding down the banister!
Taking a Slow, Systematic Approach
Most new vegans find that a less abrupt, slow and steady transition approach 
works best for them. Changing your diet and lifestyle completely can be 
really challenging, and doing everything at once can be stressful. So, by 
taking your time, you’re less likely to make major, costly mistakes.
Advantages of taking your time
Sudden changes to your diet can cause many surprising results, but making a 
slower switch to veganism can help reduce the consequences. Here are some 
reasons why:
	
✓	You won’t stress out trying to substitute foods for every animal prod­
uct you’re used to eating. Consider giving up one nonvegan food cat­
egory a week. Cheese, milk, meat, eggs, and butter can all move out of 
your life slowly as you figure out how to substitute for them with new 
vegan foods. Taking your time allows you to ask questions and discover 
new protein, fat, and nutrient sources as you move forward.
	
✓	You’ll encounter less discomfort from detoxifying side effects. The 
human body has incredible systems in place to help detoxify and release 
harmful foods, liquids, and chemicals. The skin can sweat out impuri­
ties, the liver deals with unhealthy fats, and the bowels release waste. 
It’s truly amazing what the human body is capable of doing to heal and 
cleanse itself, if given half a chance. However, this “spring cleaning” 
effect can manifest itself with some unwanted symptoms like headaches, 

30
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
fatigue, rashes, sleeplessness, fever, temporary loss of menstruation, 
diarrhea or constipation, increased methane emissions (if you know 
what I mean), and acne.
	
	People who move to a vegan diet very quickly are more likely to expe­
rience these symptoms. Taking your time will allow the body to work 
these processes slowly, causing less discomfort. Going cold Tofurky can 
sometimes be pretty painful!
	
✓	You’ll ease the flow of money out of your new pleather wallet. If you 
throw out everything in your house that was tested on animals or that’s 
made of leather, wool, silk, beeswax, dairy, meat, or eggs, your house 
may look the way it did the day before you moved in: Empty! Allowing 
more time to replace items that get used up, worn out, or eaten will 
spread the expenses out and make the cost more manageable.
Problems with pacing yourself
As you probably know, transitioning slowly to veganism isn’t all daisies and 
sunshine. You may run into a few problems, including the following:
	
✓	You may be impatient and find the waiting to be frustrating. If you’re 
the type who likes to make a decision and jump right into new habits, 
taking your time to make your whole life vegan may be too annoying for 
you. You may get bored or frustrated because you know what you want 
to do and how you want to live, but you can’t afford to make all the nec­
essary changes.
	
✓	The prolonging of detoxifying effects may trouble you more than just 
getting it done and over with. While the “shock and awe” method of 
quick detoxification can be too much for some new vegans, others may 
experience such painful physical problems that they’re ready to get 
their bodies cleaned out as quickly as possible. When you’ve hit bottom 
physically, a few days of detoxification symptoms may be preferable to 
waiting weeks for relief.
The Nuts and Bolts of Changing Over
Whether you’re going cold Tofurky or transitioning over time, going vegan is 
a life-changing event that requires you to do and remember a few basic things 
to be successful. I explain these nuts and bolts, including timing, education, 
planning, and experimentation with new foods, in the following sections.

31
 Chapter 3: Transforming to Veganism
Choosing your timing wisely
Whether you decide to be 100 percent vegan tomorrow or make the transi­
tion over the next few months, you’ll want to make a plan to ensure that you 
don’t make big changes during inconvenient times. Going vegan right before 
a rehearsal dinner at a steak house may be tough. Similarly, if you’re about to 
go on a three-week vacation to Brazil, you’ll find it much more difficult to eat a 
vegan diet if you’re not experienced in choosing vegan foods. In other words, 
go vegan slowly over a few weeks where you aren’t required to do something 
important: take finals, present a paper at a business conference, or give birth — 
there’s no point in adding extra stress to an already stressful life.
	
Choose an easy week, and get started over the weekend so you have time 
to plan a week of meals, shop, and research your local resources. You can 
make a commitment to eating one or two vegan meals a day for the first week, 
adding vegan snacks and more meals as you go forward. Perhaps you have 
a three-day weekend coming up, or your job duties are going to be really 
relaxed at the end of a big project. These times would be excellent for starting 
to cook more or to switch from cow’s milk to soy, rice, or hemp milk. You also 
can add another change at this time, such as eliminating white sugar, which is 
often processed with bone char from animals, and honey and replacing them 
with agave syrup. Keep building on these changes. As you master one major 
item, try another.
	
Making time to cook on a regular basis can bring you many benefits. Cooking 
your own food from scratch saves you money over time, because you can 
avoid relying on more expensive convenience items. Getting down and dirty 
in the kitchen also connects you with your food on a new level and helps you 
appreciate new flavors. When you have time to experiment, get creative with 
new produce and products to avoid getting stuck in a food rut. Or check out 
the many vegan cookbooks and recipes online to get inspired.
Educating yourself and enrolling 
your comrades
You’ve already chosen an excellent first step in educating yourself — reading 
this book! Looking at vegan Web sites, talking with other long-time vegans, 
discovering which ingredients to avoid, and buying a few vegan cookbooks 
also can help you prepare. Understanding how to feed yourself, what to eat, 
and where to get the foods and products you need are necessary skills. You 
don’t have to be a doctor to understand the foundations of healthy living; 
it’s easy to become a student of nutrition, food, and healing. Plus knowing 
the facts about veganism helps you explain your decision to become a vegan 
when you’re confronted with questions and doubts.

32
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
You may be the only person you know who’s brave enough to try a vegan 
diet, but it can’t hurt to ask for support from your family and good friends. If 
they understand why this is important to you, what you plan to do, and what 
you may need from them in order to be successful, they’ll likely offer their 
help or resources. Perhaps your father works with a vegan or your friend’s 
sister works at a vegan-friendly restaurant. Cast a wide net and see what 
comes back to you! It’s not often that you get to experience a major shift in 
life and truly rely on the wisdom of those who have gone before you.
Making healthier decisions by planning 
your meals ahead of time
Planning your meals in advance is the best way to make a healthy, less-stress­
ful transition to veganism. Your diet may be changing drastically from bacon 
three meals a day, or you may just be eliminating dairy from your already 
vegetarian diet. Either way, you’ll feel much better if you set your eating 
goals and write down a week’s worth of menus. And think how great you’ll 
feel when you stop buying bacon!
	
By using a meal planning guide (see Chapter 9) and working from a list of 
foods you know you want to eat more of, you can sketch out a good idea of 
what you need to buy. If you want to eat more leafy green vegetables, whole 
grains, or sea vegetables, choosing recipes that will incorporate those healing 
foods makes it more likely that you’ll accomplish your goal.
Reminding yourself why you’ve chosen veganism
Display items that remind you of your dedica­
tion to living a vegan lifestyle. Print a quote or 
picture to hang on your wall or refrigerator that 
will inspire you and confirm your commitment. 
Some inspiring framed photos of farm animals 
enjoying a natural setting, kids frolicking with 
baby lambs, famous vegans, or brilliant philoso­
phers can offer the visual clue you need to keep 
up your daily practice.
Try hand painting a stirring quote around the 
walls of your kitchen to inspire your cooking. 
Albert Schweitzer, French philosopher and 
Nobel prize winner said: “Until he extends the 
circle of his compassion to all living things, 
man will not himself find peace.” This quote 
from Albert Einstein can offer great pride in any 
home: “It is my view that the vegetarian manner 
of living, by its purely physical effect on the 
human temperament, would most beneficially 
influence the lot of mankind.”

33
 Chapter 3: Transforming to Veganism
Knowing what you’re going to make for dinner on Wednesday (or any other 
particular day of the week) helps you plan your daily schedule better so 
you’re sure to have enough time allotted to cook at the end of the day. It also 
saves you and your family from bickering and deciding on takeout or veggie 
burgers yet again. Keep in mind that it’s often easier to plan for bigger cook­
ing projects on the weekend, because you’ll have more free time and fewer 
obligations to worry about. And if you cook enough on the weekend, you can 
have leftovers to make the next week that much easier.
Purging nonvegan products from your life
Some of the nonvegan foods you’ll be avoiding are pretty obvious: cheddar 
cheese made from cow’s milk? Chuck it. Steaks in the freezer? Give ’em to the 
meat eater down the hall, or throw them away. Most vegans start avoiding 
these foods immediately once they set their minds to it.
Other ingredients aren’t as easily avoided. You may find out a few days into 
your new vegan diet that your favorite crackers have honey in them or that 
the skin cream you love is made with goat’s milk. Sitting on your leather sofa 
or car seats may gross you out after you comprehend their origins.
Go easy on yourself when you make your decisions about what to throw 
away and what to use until it’s gone. If you can’t afford to buy all new beauty 
aids this month, use what you have and replace each bottle of shampoo or 
lotion with a cruelty-free brand when the old one is gone. Perhaps you don’t 
have anyone you can give your dozen eggs to and you don’t want to waste 
them — maybe it’s better to eat the rest of the package, say a prayer and 
blessing for the chickens, and buy some tofu next week instead.
	
You can stop using every nonvegan item today, or you can take your time. It’s 
up to you, and no one should judge your decisions. You’re already making 
more conscious actions, and you’ll continue to improve as time goes on.
Getting to know your new community
Reach out and touch the faithful — vegans, that is. By joining a local vegan 
potluck group (or even a vegetarian one if that’s all you can find), you’ll meet 
like-minded people who have similar values to yours. Getting to know others 
who see the world as you do can help you feel connected and as if you’re a 
part of something bigger. The folks who belong to these groups know where 
to buy the food you need, can share strategies with you, may teach you new 
recipes, and can even point out possible pitfalls. They also can help you find 
that fabulous vegan outfit you need for your high school reunion.

34
Part I: “Ve-gan” at the Beginning 
	
Local vegan groups may be involved in political actions or animal rescue 
work, which can bring a new level of meaning to your vegan lifestyle. Get 
involved and educated about the issues in your community so that your new 
theoretical lifestyle will have a real-world impact. Getting involved also shows 
the people around you how the ethics of your diet play out in everyday life. 
Many people are won over by the upstanding moral code of veganism after 
they see the passion and dedication their friend or family member pours into 
a local environmental or animal rights cause.
Focusing on the fun and adventure 
of being a vegan
Eating can become a mundane chore if you aren’t careful. By focusing on the 
celebration of life, as displayed in a well-planned meal, vegan dining offers 
you the chance to return to honoring nature’s bounty. Focusing on the fun 
and joy of real, natural, cruelty-free food can turn every meal, no matter how 
elaborate or simple, into a party.
	
The fun of sharing food together and searching out the new and different 
menus available for vegans is one of the best parts of adopting this lifestyle. 
A new world of tastes, products, and guilt-free meals awaits you. Make it your 
intention to share the glorious natural foods with your friends and family 
(whether they’re vegan or not). Giving them the gift of healthy vegan recipes 
shows your love for them and all the world’s creatures. Not to mention you’ll 
be helping them get their daily dose of roughage.
Get adventurous with your meals. Even if you’re preparing a simple salad for 
yourself, you can incorporate homegrown herbs and tomatoes that connect 
you to the season. When thinking of your family’s upcoming reunion feast, 
ask the local farmers at your farmer’s market what will be in peak season that 
week. By bringing luscious, fresh produce, you can share the story of your 
trip to the market, explain what you chose, and reveal how you prepared it. 
Not only will this show your own dedication to good food, it also may encour­
age those around you to try new, more sustainable fare.

Part II
Building a Healthy 
Vegan Diet

In this part . . .
A
 well-rounded vegan diet provides everything a human 
body needs for healthy growth and development and 
maintenance of proper body functions. Yet living in this 
meat- and dairy-loving culture can confuse even the most 
well-read herbivore. Vegans constantly are questioned 
about their nutritional wellness and the validity of their 
food choices.
That’s why this part is so important! These chapters not 
only lay the foundation for vegan nutritional wellness, 
they also detail how to make the most health-supportive 
choices when it comes to cooking, shopping for food, and 
ordering meals.

Chapter 4
Essential Nutrients 
for Healthy Success
In This Chapter
▶	Getting to know the B vitamins
▶	Discovering the truth about calcium
▶	Uncovering the solid facts about iron
▶	Finding out about vitamin D and zinc
▶	Maintaining good health with vegan supplements
T
he human body requires special nutrients to ensure healthy growth and 
good energy. Vitamins and minerals are like the nuts and bolts that keep 
the human machine held together and running properly.
In this chapter, I discuss where to get the vitamins and minerals that may be 
lacking in plant foods. B12 and B2, as well as vitamin D, are found readily in 
animal foods, so you may be concerned about getting enough in a vegan diet. 
Iron, calcium and zinc are minerals that may, at first glance, be harder to get 
from vegan foods. There are excellent plant sources of these natural miner­
als, and even some ways to help your body utilize them better. The final sec­
tion in this chapter also addresses whether vegans need to use supplements 
and if so, what types to try.
	
The bottom line for proper nutrition is that natural food is your best bet for 
all-around health. Separating nutrients and vitamins into stand-alone sources 
of nutrition can lead to overdose or an inadvertent depletion of another neces­
sary vitamin or mineral.
“B”-ing Healthy with B12 and B2
B vitamins often are referred to as a complex — this doesn’t mean that they’re 
difficult to understand and have a lot of emotional issues; it just means that 
they all need to be present in order for the body to use them properly. While 

38
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
most of the B vitamins can be found easily in plant foods, vegans need to be 
aware that two very important B vitamins — B12 and B2 — are a little harder 
to find in plant foods. So be sure to include in your diet foods that have been 
fortified.
	
B12 is the most important of all the B vitamins when you’re a vegan. 
Necessary for building blood and cell division, B12 isn’t made by any plants 
or animals — it’s actually made by bacteria. Humans used to get their B12 by 
eating foods contaminated with bacteria that had produced the B12. However, 
because our food is so clean and sterilized these days, we don’t get a reliable 
source of B12 from bacteria. The other main source of bacteria-produced B12 
is animal flesh. Food animals still eat bacteria, which accumulates the B12 in 
their flesh and muscles. Research also shows that the bacteria in the human 
body make small amounts of B12. But, because the body may not absorb and 
use it, you’re still better off using fortified foods or B complexes.
	
B12 deficiency isn’t common, but can be serious, leading to nerve damage and 
anemia. The body also uses B12 to protect nerve fibers and metabolize and 
use carbohydrates, fat, and protein. The most common sign of B12 deficiency 
is fatigue, which can be avoided with a well-planned diet that includes B12-rich 
foods or regular supplementation.
B2, also known as riboflavin, is easier to find in plant foods than B12, but 
it’s still important to be aware of the vegan sources you can get it from. 
Important for overall skin and eye health, B2 is also necessary for cellular 
energy production. Deficiencies of B2 can lead to mouth and lip sores, a swol­
len tongue, and dermatitis.
I give you the lowdown on vitamins B2 and B12 in the following sections, 
including where to find them and how much to consume.
Finding B12 and B2 in vegan foods
These days B12 is often added to a variety of vegan foods, so be sure to have 
these items on your weekly shopping list:
	
✓	Fortified cereals
	
✓	Nutritional yeast flakes, like Red Star
	
✓	Fortified soy, rice, and hemp milks
	
✓	Fortified fake meats made from wheat gluten and soy
Note: Some fermented soy foods like miso, natto, and tempeh, as well 
as some sea vegetables, have been reported to contain vitamin B12. The 
amounts found in these foods are too small to make them reliable sources.

39
 Chapter 4: Essential Nutrients for Healthy Success
B2 is a bit easier to find in natural vegetables. The following items are easy 
sources to work into your menu on a regular basis:
	
✓	Almonds	
	
	
✓	
Asparagus
	
✓	Bananas	
	
	
✓	
Broccoli
	
✓	Brussels sprouts	
	
✓	
Mushrooms
	
✓	Nutritional yeast	
	
✓	
Peas
	
✓	Soybeans	
	
	
✓	
Soymilk, fortified
	
✓	Spinach	
	
	
✓	
Whole grains
	
✓	Wheat germ	
	
	
✓	
Wild rice
Getting enough of the right kind
Even though many foods are fortified with B12, vegans can still be deficient. 
This deficiency isn’t due to the amount they consume; instead it’s due to the 
fact that their body isn’t absorbing the B12 from the intestines well. In this 
case, a probiotic, to improve the health and ability of the digestive system 
to absorb nutrients properly, and a B-complex vitamin would be useful. You 
also may try other measures to ensure that the intestines are healthy and 
working properly. A daily probiotic can help ensure that the good bacteria 
are present to help digest and absorb nutrients in the gut. A high-fiber diet, 
which isn’t difficult to achieve as a vegan, helps keep the digestive system 
clean and clear.
	
Luckily, the human body doesn’t need a huge amount of B12; however, it does 
need a little bit on a regular basis. The current RDA for B12 is 2.4 micrograms 
a day. About 2 tablespoons of nutritional yeast fortified with B12 can provide 
your daily dose. Sprinkle nutritional yeast on air-popped popcorn, salads, 
and pasta; stir it into soups; or use one of the many vegan recipes that use 
nutritional yeast to imitate cheese. Try the Hungry Man Tofu Scramble or the 
Tempeh Hash recipes in Part IV with Red Star Nutritional Yeast — it’s fortified 
with B12.
Counting on Calcium for Strong Bones
Have you ever seen a cow or elephant up close? These enormous animals 
carry around their hefty weight on strong bones, much like ours. Where do 
you think these gigantic animals get the calcium to create their bones? Do 
they drink cow’s milk as the USDA recommends? Of course not. They eat 
plants.

40
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
While humans and animals certainly don’t build their bodies in the same way — 
or even digest food in exactly the same way — humans, like animals, can get the 
required calcium needed to build bones from plant foods. Our bones hold the larg­
est store of the calcium in our bodies; when they’re healthy, bones are firm and 
rigid. The body doesn’t just use calcium to build bones, however; it also needs the 
mineral to clot blood and for many muscle and nerve functions.
Plant foods, like leafy green vegetables, have a better bioavailability of cal­
cium than dairy products. This means that our bodies can better absorb and 
use the calcium present in these greens as compared to dairy foods. While 
dairy foods are rich in calcium, they are also rich in protein, which inhibits 
the body’s ability to absorb calcium. A vegan diet rich in greens and calcium-
enriched foods will ensure the recommended intake of 1,000-1,200 milligrams 
a day is met.
In this section, I help you understand your calcium requirements, and I tell 
you how, as a vegan, you can successfully meet those requirements. I round 
out the section by discussing calcium’s role in the important acid-alkaline 
ratio in the body.
Boning up on calcium requirements
Most nutrition guidelines recommend getting between 800 to 1,500 milligrams 
of calcium a day, mostly from dairy products. The United States Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines state that to avoid osteoporosis and grow 
healthy bones, these levels must be reached. However, according to the 
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, healthy bones can be 
maintained with a daily consumption of 600 milligrams a day. And the World 
Health Organization (WHO) recommends between 400 and 500 milligrams 
daily, which is half of the U.S. recommended dietary allowance.
	
When paired with a healthy nonsmoking lifestyle, regular weight-bearing exer­
cise, and healthy levels of vitamins D and K, the body can build and maintain 
healthy bones on a sensible vegan diet.
Never heard of vitamin K? That’s because it’s so easy to get all you need from 
natural foods that people rarely worry about it. Vitamin K helps blood to clot, 
protects bones, and prevents cell damage from oxidation. If you find yourself 
bruising and bleeding easily or having liver, gallbladder, or digestive system 
problems, you may need more vitamin K. Good sources are spinach, Brussels 
sprouts, carrots, green beans, peas, broccoli, kale, and asparagus.

41
 Chapter 4: Essential Nutrients for Healthy Success
Seeking out calcium in vegan foods
Since you won’t be consuming dairy products to reach your daily calcium 
requirements, you may be wondering what foods you should eat. Don’t 
worry. You have tons of wonderful, natural vegan foods available to you that 
will ensure you have enough calcium in your diet. Just be sure to eat a vari­
ety of the foods in Table 4-1 on a regular basis.
	
Spinach, amaranth, rhubarb, chard, and beet greens, which may seem like 
good sources of calcium, all contain oxalic acid, which can bind with cal­
cium and reduce its absorption. These foods are healthy in general, but they 
shouldn’t be considered good sources of calcium because they can cause the 
body to lose as much calcium as it gains. Other greens like kale, broccoli, mus­
tard greens, and bok choy are better calcium choices.
The truth about dairy products
The dairy industry has a lot of money and has 
been influencing the government, the American 
public, and health organizations to believe that 
their products are necessary for good health for 
decades. But the story doesn’t hold up. If we 
eat more dairy products than most countries on 
the planet, why do we have some of the highest 
osteoporosis rates? There’s clearly more to the 
story. To truly build strong, healthy bones and 
avoid other major health problems, green leafy 
veggies, which are often lacking in the average 
American’s diet, are better sources of calcium 
than dairy products.
To prove my point, consider the Harvard Nurses’ 
Health Study that was published in 2003. This 
study followed more than 72,000 women for 18 
years and found no link between increased milk 
consumption and risk of fractures. On a similar 
note, in his groundbreaking research project, 
The China Study, Dr. T. Colin Campbell showed 
that the vast majority of the population of China 
consumes no dairy products. Instead, these 
people get their calcium from mostly plant-
based sources, including green leafy vegeta­
bles.
American women have one of the highest rates 
of hip fracture in the world. The only other 
countries with higher rates — a few Northern 
European countries as well as Australia and 
New Zealand — actually eat more dairy than 
we do. On the other hand, Chinese women 
have much lower osteoporosis and hip frac­
ture rates, and they eat no dairy. Instead, these 
women get their calcium from leafy green veg­
gies, tofu, and other natural foods like nuts and 
seeds.

Avoiding foods that leach calcium
The WHO recommends half the daily calcium intake that the United States 
National Academy of Sciences recommends. So, if the rest of the world is 
consuming less calcium than we are, why do we have more osteoporosis? 
(I discuss this question in the nearby sidebar, “The truth about dairy prod­
ucts.”) The secret part of the calcium story is that calcium isn’t the only 
player in the bone health game. Excess acids, protein, and alcohol cause the 
body to leach calcium out of the bones, setting them up for fractures and 
osteoporosis.
For example, several well-publicized studies have shown that soda drinkers 
of all ages have higher rates of broken bones and fractures than people who 
don’t drink soda. Most sodas, both regular and diet, contain phosphorus or 
citric acid. The phosphorus and citric acid in these drinks create too much 
acidity in the body. And your body is so smart that it can balance the acid-
alkaline ratio by drawing calcium (an alkaline material) out of the bones.

44
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
	
The human body likes to stay in a narrow range on the acid-alkaline scale. 
Calcium is the most plentiful mineral in the human body and it is alkaline, as 
opposed to acidic. A diet high in acidic foods like dairy, meat, and refined 
sugars, can lead to fatigue, stiffness, and canker sores. When the body gets too 
acidic, calcium is drawn out of the bones for an alkalinizing effect, therefore 
evening out the balance, but weakening the bones.
Like acids, excessive amounts of protein also affect bone health. A diet high 
in animal protein is high in sulfur, because amino acids contain sulfur. These 
sulfur-based amino acids negatively affect the body’s pH balance, causing 
the bones to release calcium stores so the body can become more alkaline. 
Protein from plants have less sulfur-based amino acids, so they’re already 
more alkaline and less likely to cause calcium leaching. So, if you want 
healthy bones, you should avoid meat and eat more green leafy veggies!
Pumping Up Your Iron Intake
Big guys in weight rooms may be the ultimate icons of strong bodies and 
human health, but vegans can pump some iron too with natural foods for 
supreme health. It’s true that iron is vitally important for energy, but it’s 
also a needed component of hemoglobin — the part of our blood that carries 
oxygen. Anemia, dangerous iron deficiency, is a major health problem all 
over the world that’s all too common in young women and kids.
	
Our bodies can take in two forms of iron — heme or nonheme — but vegans 
need to think about only one: nonheme iron. Heme iron is found in animal 
flesh foods like meat and fish. Nonheme iron is found in plant foods like veg­
etables, fruits, nuts, seeds, grains, and beans. Vegan diets, of course, rely on 
nonheme iron, which isn’t absorbed by the body as well. So vegans need to be 
aware of their iron intake more than the average person. Good thing we’re not 
average!
To get you on track with your iron intake, the following sections provide info 
on how much to consume and what sources to rely on. I also tell you what 
other foods you need to consume in order for your body to best absorb the 
iron efficiently.
Understanding how much you need
The standard recommendation for iron intake is 8 milligrams a day for men 
between the ages of 9 and 13 and 19+, and 11 milligrams a day for men 

45
 Chapter 4: Essential Nutrients for Healthy Success
between the ages of 14 and 18 years and for postmenopausal women. 
Premenopausal women between the ages of 14 and 18 (who lose more iron 
due to their menstrual cycles) need 15 milligrams per day, while women 19 
to 50 need 18 milligrams a day. Pregnant vegans are encouraged to talk with 
their midwives or doctors about taking a prenatal iron supplement and eating 
iron-rich foods. (You can read more on pregnant vegans in Chapter 20 and 
vegan kids in Chapter 22.)
	
The preceding recommendations are a little confusing for vegans; they’re 
lower and meant for meat eaters. Because the nonheme iron we eat isn’t 
absorbed as well as the heme iron found in a meat eater’s diet, vegans should 
safeguard against iron deficiency by eating more iron-rich foods.
Luckily, it’s not difficult to get sufficient iron from vegan foods. Anemia is no 
more common in vegans than in the rest of the population. If you understand 
how much you need, take a look at the iron-rich foods available to vegans, 
and plan to eat them regularly, you’ll have no trouble with anemia.
Obtaining your iron in vegan foods
A diet full of various whole foods and vegetables will easily meet your iron 
requirements. Take a look at Table 4-2 to start adding up your needs.
Using iron to the best of your 
body’s ability
Iron doesn’t work alone — just like a man, iron is no island in the bloodstream. 
It needs the help of another nutrient to do its work efficiently. Luckily, a well-
rounded vegan diet provides this nutrient in abundant quantities.
Vegans are thought to equal the iron capacity of nonvegans because their 
diets are rich in vitamin C. When vitamin C is present with nonheme iron, the 
body can absorb it up to six times better. And it just so happens that many 
vegan sources of nonheme iron are naturally high in vitamin C as well. Most 
leafy greens like broccoli and bok choy, are great for both iron and vitamin C 
(and calcium), so the iron is easily absorbed by the body. It’s a win-win-win 
situation!

 Chapter 4: Essential Nutrients for Healthy Success
Think of all the iron-rich foods you already eat, and then consider the foods 
you eat with them. You’ll probably find that you’re already eating iron and 
vitamin C together, which is why vegans can do so well nutritionally. Tofu, 
broccoli, and brown rice dishes, beans and salsa, and spinach salad with bell 
peppers and tomatoes are great iron and vitamin C combinations.
As you can see, vegans should have no problem getting the iron they need. 
You should be aware of the signs of iron deficiency, however, just in case 
you let your healthier eating habits slide. Iron anemia is more common in the 
general population than most folks realize, so be aware of your body and any 
symptoms.
	
Feeling fatigued or lethargic can be a sign of iron deficiency. If your blood iron 
levels are low, your capacity to work can be reduced, and you may get tired 
easily from normal physical exertion or exercise. The body needs iron to main­
tain a healthy immune system, so low iron stores can decrease your body’s 
ability to fight infections. Pale skin, breathlessness, feeling tired, lightheaded­
ness, weakness, a sore or inflamed tongue, headaches, nausea, and abdominal 
pain are all associated with anemia.
Staying away from iron blockers
Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron, but other foods and risk factors 
can lead to poor absorption. One of the main foods to avoid is cow’s milk — 
thank goodness you’re vegan now! The American Academy of Pediatrics has 
made a recommendation that children under the age of 1 year not be given 
any cow’s milk or milk products. A dairy-rich diet is more likely to cause iron 
deficiency, as cow’s milk has very little iron itself. Because calcium can inter­
fere with iron absorption, eating a lot of dairy can lead to anemia.
Coax out the iron with cast-iron cooking
According to a 1986 study in the Journal of the 
American Dietetic Association, cooking food in 
a cast-iron skillet is a good way to add iron to 
your diet. Researchers found that foods, espe­
cially acidic ones, increased their iron content 
when cooked in these pots and pans. The acid­
ity in foods like tomatoes reacted with the metal 
and absorbed more of the iron. Spaghetti sauce 
that originally contained less than 1 milligram 
per serving increased its iron content to almost 
6 milligrams. Applesauce cooked in cast iron 
went from less than 1 milligram per serving to 
more than 7 milligrams! Older, more seasoned 
cast-iron pans may have less iron to offer after 
years of use, but they’re still an excellent way to 
easily increase your iron intake.

48
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
The tannins and caffeine found in tea and coffee also can block iron absorp­
tion, so try drinking herbal or decaf teas and coffees instead if your iron 
levels are a concern. Because caffeine also affects calcium levels in the 
bones, it’s best to avoid drinking it regularly.
Phytates are naturally found in most plant foods, including soy and other 
beans, nuts, seeds, and grains. Phytates can bind with minerals like iron, 
making it more difficult for the body to absorb them. Luckily, cooking, 
sprouting, and soaking can help to disable phytates.
Unhealthy behaviors like smoking and excessive alcohol consumption also 
can block your body’s ability to absorb and properly use iron.
Vitamin D: The Sunlight Vitamin
Did you know that you, as a human being, are kind of like a sunflower? Most 
plants create their food and energy from photosynthesis, the process by 
which they turn sunlight into chlorophyll (the green stuff in their leaves). 
Chlorophyll is basically trapped sunlight! The human body also uses the sun 
to create vital nutrients for energy use. One of these vitamins is vitamin D.
Proper vitamin D intake is essential for bone health and can reduce or pre­
vent the onset of the bone disease osteoporosis. Vitamin D promotes bone 
formation by helping the body use calcium and phosphorus. Recent stud­
ies have shown that proper supplementation with vitamin D reduces and 
reverses bone loss, so there’s great hope for osteoporosis sufferers.
	
As an ex–milk drinker, you probably remember seeing cow’s milk cartons 
exclaiming that the product was “Vitamin D fortified!” This supplementation 
was necessary to stave off the rampant spread of rickets, a vitamin D defi­
ciency, across the United States in the early 20th century. Because of this (and 
the “Got milk?” campaigns), most of us strongly link bone health with cow’s 
milk.
Vitamin D also is essential for a healthy immune system and for improved 
cardiovascular, skin, and prostate health. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin 
that’s stored in the liver, and it can be used by the body during the dark 
winter. (Just don’t beat up your liver with alcohol; otherwise it can’t properly 
dispense the D you need.)
Elevating your vitamin D intake naturally
Vitamin D is created in your body after your skin is exposed to sunlight or 
UVB and UVA rays. Without these rays, your body can’t naturally produce this 
essential nutrient. But never fear! The body only needs about 15 to 30 minutes 

49
 Chapter 4: Essential Nutrients for Healthy Success
in the sun to create all the D it needs. Fair-skinned people need 10–20 minutes a 
day, while people with naturally dark skin need between 15 to 30 minutes a day 
in the sun to create adequate D.
	
Avoid using sunblock for those times each day that you’re restoring your 
body’s vitamin D. The rays that are blocked are necessary for vitamin forma­
tion. Keep the sunblock handy for later in the day, or just apply it to your face. 
Try giving your arms and legs totally unrestricted access to Helios, the sun 
god, for just a few minutes. Sun — it does a body good!
Adding food or supplements 
to get your Vitamin D
If we could all live our lives naked near the equator, vitamin D deficiency 
would never be a problem. However, most of us wear clothes on a daily basis 
and live far away from the constant sunny skies of the equatorial countries.
So, if you live in any northern location where you rarely see the sun all 
winter, or if you cover every square inch of your body with clothing when 
outside, you must get vitamin D from food or supplements.
Not all Vitamin D is equal. It comes in two forms: D2 and D3. The D3, cholecal­
ciferol, is not vegan as it is derived from lanolin in sheep. D2, ergocalciferol, 
is derived from a yeast, and is vegan. Many studies suggest that D2 is as 
effective as D3 in raising blood serum levels of vitamin D, when taken in large 
enough amounts. Getting your blood levels tested is needed to determine 
how much vitamin D supplementation, if any, is needed.
	
Fortified soy, rice, and hemp milk, as well as many fortified boxed cereals, 
orange juices, and breads, are some of the products available for getting your 
daily dose of vitamin D. These foods aren’t difficult to find, but, if you prefer, 
you also can get vitamin D from most daily vitamin supplements. If you take 
calcium supplements, you’re likely getting vitamin D from it as well, but check 
the label to make sure.
Don’t Forget Zinc!
Zinc is another important mineral that many people — vegan and nonvegan — 
seem to be lacking. However, vegans can get enough from their diet, and it’s 
pretty easy to ensure that your food supplies the amount of zinc that you need. 
Vegan women, in particular, must remember to focus on eating enough calo­
ries from zinc-rich foods and ensure that their zinc requirements are met.

50
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
Dangerous zinc deficiency isn’t common in vegans, but it’s good to be aware 
of what it looks like: Impaired immunity, loss of appetite, hair loss, and 
growth retardation are all signs of zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency also exac­
erbates acne and diabetes and makes it difficult for the body to produce insu­
lin, eliminate toxins, and keep the entire immune system strong.
	
Men need a bit more zinc than most women to ensure healthy reproduction. 
Sperm is high in zinc, and so a deficiency should be considered strongly if you 
have any fertility concerns. Males and females ages 9 to 13 should get 8 mil­
ligrams daily, while males 14 and older should consume 11 milligrams a day. 
Women ages 14 to 18 need 9 milligrams a day, while women 19 and older need 
8 milligrams daily. (Pregnancy and breastfeeding require more zinc, which I 
cover in Chapter 20).
Picking up zinc from vegan foods
Fortified foods are always going to help you get the nutrition you need, but 
unadulterated, natural foods are a fantastic source of whole nutrition. Not 
only will these natural foods provide you with the zinc that you need, but 
they also will provide you with other healthy benefits as well, such as fiber 
and healthy fats. Table 4-3 lists some great sources of zinc.

 Chapter 4: Essential Nutrients for Healthy Success
Making sure your body absorbs it
Certain aspects of food can hinder your zinc absorption. Too much calcium 
in your diet, for example, can impede your body’s ability to absorb zinc. 
Some calcium supplements now come with added zinc to offset this disparity.
Found in the outer layers of seeds, beans, grains, nuts, peas, and legumes, phytic 
acid can keep your body from absorbing zinc properly. Luckily, simply soaking 
and rinsing these foods in water will remove much of the phytic acid. Similarly, 
soymilk contains large amounts of the old foe (and clearly you can’t rinse it 
away!). So make sure that you’re getting plenty of zinc from other healthy foods 
and don’t drink gallons of soymilk — moderation, of course, is key.
	
Wildwood Organics now makes soy foods like tofu from soaked and sprouted 
soybeans. Sprouting and soaking the beans removes much of the naturally 
occurring phytic acid.
A Little Help from Our Friends: 
Giving Supplements a Try
Take a good look at the food you’re eating on a regular basis. Are you hitting 
those markers for protein, B12, vitamin D, iron, calcium, and zinc? If not, can 
you add any whole and supplemented foods that will improve your intake? If 
so, this is my first recommendation toward reaching your daily requirements. 
(Refer to the earlier sections on each of these nutrients for more information.)
The second best way to ensure that you’re getting all the nutrients you need 
is to take a supplement or multivitamin. If you tend to eat poorly several days 
a week or really aren’t sure about your nutrition, a properly chosen daily 
supplement can help. You have many vegan multivitamins to choose from, 
and several of them derive their ingredients from plants and whole foods. 
Supplements made from whole foods as opposed to isolated chemicals are 
widely believed to be more easily absorbed by your body. You also can pur­
chase liquid supplements that allow your body to more quickly absorb the 
nutrients.
	
The number one supplement that most people benefit from is a good probi­
otic. Probiotics are supplements of living dietary bacteria, such as acidophilus 
and yeasts, that help the human digestive system work properly. Choose a 
refrigerated probiotic that’s dairy free. If your digestion is working well, you 
don’t need a probiotic because you’ll be able to absorb the nutrients you need 
from your food and other supplements.

52
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
Regarding the B vitamins, it’s best to take them as a complex. That’s because 
there are eight B vitamins, and they all need to be in proportional quantities 
to work well. If you have concerns about B12 specifically, ask your doctor to 
check your levels before starting a separate B12 supplement.
Make sure that any supplement containing vitamin D is vegan. Vitamins D2 
and D3 are different, and D3 pills aren’t vegan. Supplementing with D2 has 
been shown to be a valid way of improving your body’s ability to create 
healthy bones.
Many supplement companies make quality vegan products. Deva, VegLife, 
New Chapter, Rainbow Light, and Country Life are a few companies to look 
into. Several Web sites, such as www.veganessentials.com and www.
cosmosveganshoppe.com, sell only vegan products and offer a wide range 
of supplements to choose from.
	
If you feel you have some sort of nutrient deficiency, talk to your doctor 
about getting some simple blood tests that can pinpoint any specific areas to 
address. However, be assured that eating a well-planned vegan diet can give 
you everything you need.
Water, water everywhere
In your quest for optimum nutrition, don’t forget 
about water! Eight 8-ounce glasses daily is the 
general guideline. Need help remembering to 
drink enough water? When you’re spending 
time at home or at work, give yourself a visual 
reminder to drink your daily ration. Fill a pretty, 
eye-grabbing pitcher with the amount of water 
you want to drink in a day. Set it somewhere 
you’ll see it often, such as on a kitchen coun­
ter, at the corner of your desk, or on a little tea 
table next to the TV. Put a nice glass next to the 
pitcher so you have no excuse not to drink up!
Avoiding plastic bottles, which can leach petro­
chemicals, hormone disrupters, and plasticizers 
into your drinking water, is a great step toward 
detoxifying your body and saving a landfill from 
unnecessary waste. Plus, because bottled 
water isn’t regulated like public water supplies, 
you’ll probably have a better quality of water 
straight out of your tap. If you don’t like the 
taste or quality of your tap water, you can get 
great home water filters that will remove heavy 
metals, pesticides, chlorine, and bacteria. If you 
want to take water with you in the car or to your 
workouts, buy a stainless steel, reusable water 
bottle. Plastic ones are risky because, again, 
they can leach nasty chemicals into your water.

I
magine you’re at a party about to meet some new people. As you’re intro­
duced around, it might come up in conversation that you’re a vegan — 
perhaps you politely declined the passed shrimp hors d’oeuvres (or as I like 
to call them, “fingers of flesh”). You can be certain that one of the first ques­
tions will be “Where do you get your protein?”
Don’t be alarmed — take a deep breath and get ready to charm the pants 
off of those well-meaning yet ill-informed meat eaters. The basics of protein 
are simple, and vegans can and do get plenty. The average American has too 
much protein in her diet, mainly because she eats so many animal foods, 
including meat, eggs, and dairy. (According to USDA predictions for annual 
meat consumption, by 2007 each person in the United States consumed 
roughly 221 pounds of animal meat a year.) Yes, those foods are sources of 
protein. But they aren’t the only sources; nor are they necessarily the healthi­
est or cheapest!
In this chapter, you find out how protein works in the body and how much 
different people need on a daily basis. New vegans can get confused about 
the types and quality of plant sources of protein, so I’ve provided detailed 
charts and lists to help you plan your healthy diet successfully.
What You Need to Know about Protein
The difference between a source of protein and the protein itself is a matter of 
molecules. Good vegan sources of protein, for example, are tofu and nuts. But 
when you look at those foods, can you see the protein? Of course not. The 
protein is a part of the structure of the food, but it’s not the food itself.

54
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
Proteins are large, complex molecules that perform important functions in 
your body. They do most of the work in cells and are used by your body to 
regulate water in tissues and organs, perform functions like repairing cells 
and building new ones, and create the structure of the bones, blood, hor­
mones, muscles, and everything else in the body. Every cell in the body con­
tains protein, and protein is a large part of the muscles, organs, and skin.
	
Proteins are composed of many thousands of smaller units called amino acids. 
To form a complete protein, all 22 of the different amino acids must be present. 
Your body does create some of these amino acids by itself, but it must receive 
nine of the amino acids it needs from food, called essential amino acids — mean­
ing it’s essential that you eat foods containing them! These essential amino 
acids can all be found in plant foods, so as long as your diet is varied and pro­
vides you with enough calories, you don’t need to worry about getting enough 
of these building blocks.
Your body creates the specific forms of protein it needs from the dietary 
protein you eat. When you eat a bunch of nuts, beans, or soy, your body mac­
erates, or breaks down that food with saliva and chewing. Then the food gets 
digested by the stomach. The original food source of protein begins to break 
down into the different amino acids, which your body can absorb and form 
into new proteins that it can use to perform whatever function it needs. Isn’t 
the human body amazing?
How Much Protein Do You Need?
The National Institute of Health recommends that the average man eat 
between 30 to 60 grams of protein a day; it says women need between 25 to 
50 grams a day. Most Americans are getting closer to 100 to 120 grams a day, 
which is leading to a host of health problems. While protein is necessary and 
good for the body, too much can be dangerous over time. And remember that 
the source of your protein can matter just as much as the quantity you’re 
consuming. (I talk more about the difference in protein sources in the later 
section “Why Vegan Protein Is Better Than Animal Protein.”)
Protein needs for all ages and stages
	
The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein intake is based on a 
simple calculation used by the National Institute of Health. The basic formula 
is this:
	
1.	Weight in pounds ÷ 2.2 = weight in kilograms.
	
2.	Weight in kilograms × 0.8 = grams of protein a day.

55
 Chapter 5: Protein Protocols
So, for a 125-pound woman who gets moderate to light exercise, the RDA 
would be about 46 grams of protein a day. If you exercise more vigorously, 
are pregnant, lactating, or are a growing kid or teenager, you may need to 
increase your protein. Table 5-1 shows the average recommended dietary 
allowances for protein. If you notice you are getting most of your protein 
from unrefined grains, beans, and produce, and very little from tofu, tempeh 
or soy-based meats, it’s recommended that you increase the calculation to 
0.9 for Step 2.

As you can see, protein needs and requirements can change over the course 
of one’s lifetime; they’re especially important for growth in childhood, the 
teen years, the elderly, and for pregnant and lactating women. Athletes and 
body builders (yes, vegans can be body builders too!) also have different pro­
tein needs than the average, healthy, and moderately active person. (Check 
out Part VI for info on vegan dietary needs for all walks of life.)
	
Plant proteins aren’t as easy for the human body to access during diges­
tion as animal proteins, and all but a few plant foods are lacking some of the 
essential amino acids to create a complete protein. Because of these factors, 
the healthy vegan should consider consuming a slightly higher amount of 
protein to ensure adequate intake. However, remember that ensuring a proper 
intake shouldn’t be a problem! The average American eats considerably more 
protein than is needed, and adequate protein is available in the healthy plant 
foods discussed in this chapter. As long as you eat a variety of whole foods, 
unrefined foods with all the edible parts intact like brown rice and potatoes 
and apples with the skin on, throughout the day — and eat enough of them to 
meet your caloric needs — you’ll easily hit your protein target.

Protein problems: Why too much 
of a good thing is a bad thing
As a hot-button topic among vegans and the people who love them, protein 
comes up often and causes heated discussions. Many omnivores and well-
meaning parents are under the impression that animal-derived foods are the 
only quality sources of protein. True, meat and eggs are complete proteins. 
However, the quality of plant-based protein is excellent and even superior 
when you consider the dangers associated with meat consumption.
	
The high fat content, acidity, and toxins found in animal products cause 
numerous health problems if consumed excessively (and most Americans do 
fall into this category of excessive consumers). The major health problems 
associated with meat consumption are heart disease, certain cancers, strokes, 
obesity, and osteoporosis. A staggering majority of meat produced in this 
country is very high in fat and cholesterol, which is an unsavory side dish to 
the protein that people really need.
The acidic nature of animal foods causes your alkaline-loving body to try to 
balance itself. The quickest way for the human body to get more alkaline is 
to draw calcium out of the bones (calcium is an alkaline substance). So diets 
rich in animal foods lead to constant losses of calcium through the kidneys, 
leaching the bones of that essential mineral. It now makes sense that the 
countries with high meat and dairy consumption also have high osteoporosis 
rates.
Excessive intake of protein leads to other concerns besides brittle bones, 
however. Other damaging effects are high cholesterol, kidney stones and 
renal failure, overstressed liver and kidneys, and a risk of gout, which is 
also known as “the disease of kings.” Gout is described as painful, recurring 
attacks of joint inflammation that are brought on by high levels of uric acid 
in the body. Gout is often a hereditary disease, but this acidic condition also 
can be brought on by a diet that includes excessive amounts of animal foods. 
About 200 years ago, gout was associated with the upper classes because 
they could afford to eat more meat and assume a more leisurely life.
Not enough protein? Symptoms 
to look out for
The scourge of too much protein is a concern in developed, Western cul­
tures, but health concerns also (though rarely) arise from diets lacking ade­
quate protein. Some of these health concerns should be of special interest 
to vegans, because when left unchecked, these problems can lead to serious 
damage over time.

57
 Chapter 5: Protein Protocols
Here are some indications that you may need to focus your diet on more 
high-quality proteins:
	
✓	Feeling constantly lightheaded, unmotivated, and overtired
	
✓	Constant sugar and carbohydrate cravings (when your body is lacking 
sufficient protein and nutrients to power itself, it craves sugar to get the 
quick energy it so desperately needs)
	
✓	Hair loss
	
✓	Growth retardation in babies and toddlers
	
✓	Increased susceptibility to infection
	
✓	Weight loss
	
✓	Muscle wasting
	
✓	Weakness and fatigue
	
While these deficiencies are seen more often in underdeveloped nations, espe­
cially during times of famine, vegans who eat a variety of whole, unprocessed 
foods will easily meet their protein requirements. Just be sure to consume a 
healthy variety of vegan protein ingredients throughout your day.
Thinking about high-protein diets
Once a decade a “new” diet fad gets dusted off 
and presented as the best way to lose weight 
and control blood sugar issues. The high-
protein, low-carbohydrate diet has had many 
names, including the Atkins diet, Scarsdale diet, 
Carbohydrate Addict’s diet, and the Endocrine 
Control Diet. These diets are all variations on 
the theme of eating foods that are high in pro­
tein and low in carbs; and they all have well-
known side effects: the risk of bone loss, kidney 
failure, kidney stones, digestive problems, con­
stipation and sluggish elimination, gas, and bad 
breath.
The proponents who endorse a high-protein 
diet believe that eating carbohydrates leads 
to blood sugar issues and diabetes as well as 
weight gain and obesity. By eliminating most 
carbohydrates from their diet, high-protein 
advocates are successful, usually in the short 
term, in losing weight and ending their out-of-
control carbohydrate cravings.
Ultimately, these diets are unsuccessful for 
many people. Focusing on a diet mostly devoid 
of fruit, sweet vegetables, and whole grains, 
these followers are forced to use fiber supple­
ments to ensure regular bowel movements. 
Even with daily doses of fiber, the huge amount 
of meat and dairy consumed leads to diges­
tive problems and constipation since animal 
proteins take longer to eliminate due to their 
utter lack of natural fiber. Because most animal 
proteins are cooked, except for sushi (which 
is often still thawed from frozen fish), they’re 
lacking enzymes and never contain any of 
the powerfully healing aspects of plant foods. 
Chlorophyll from green plants, phytonutrients, 
vitamins, and fiber are sorely lacking in these 
diet plans, leading to a lack of vitality over time.

58
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
Why Vegan Protein Is Better 
Than Animal Protein
The standard American diet, or SAD (it is pretty sad, isn’t it?), relies heav­
ily on animal foods as the main source of protein. At the same time, health 
experts and doctors have been warning that the current avalanche of dis­
eases and the growing obesity problem are direct results of our diet. These 
same experts plead with us to eat more fiber and fresh fruits and vegetables 
as a way to avoid and heal these illnesses. And it’s true; one of the easiest 
ways to recover from a lifetime of the SAD state of affairs is to rely on plant-
based proteins.
Plant sources of protein are a wise choice, especially because so many 
Americans aren’t getting enough fiber in their diets. Beans, nuts, whole 
grains, and seeds are rich in fiber and plant-based phytochemicals, which are 
plant chemicals that have protective or disease preventive properties that 
help lower the risk of cancers and heart disease. The positive effect of plant 
sources of protein is twofold:
	
✓	While ensuring your body has enough plant-based protein, you’re also 
taking the burden of digesting a diet full of cholesterol-filled meat and 
difficult-to-assimilate fats off your liver and digestive system.
	
✓	You also get the powerful protection of the natural health benefits found 
in these whole foods.
A diet high in plant proteins can extend more benefits than just protecting 
your heart and bones. The Nurses’ Health Study, a long-term study involv­
ing 18,000 women, showed that infertility in women can be greatly affected 
by the type of protein they consume. Women who ate more plant sources of 
protein were much less likely to have infertility issues than women with few 
plant protein sources in their diet. Amazingly, infertility was 39 percent more 
likely in women who ate the most animal protein.
In T. Collin Campbell’s incredible book The China Study, the link between 
cancer growth and protein is drawn out. Several studies cited in this book 
show that a diet including animal proteins can lead to cancer cell prolifera­
tion. The vegetable sources of protein have not shown the same link with 
cancer growth, so a vegan diet can be considered much safer for overall 
cancer avoidance.
	
Animal-based foods provide certain other important nutrients besides pro­
tein, but perfectly wonderful plant sources can provide these minerals and 
vitamins as well. Zinc, iron, vitamin B12, and calcium can be found in the plant 
kingdom (the sources and considerations are covered in Chapter 4).

59
 Chapter 5: Protein Protocols
	
One sign that the human body is designed to absorb protein and other nutri­
ents from plant foods is the length of our digestive tracts. A carnivore’s diges­
tive tract is several times shorter than a purely vegetarian animal’s. So when 
the meat eater eats its dinner, probably a freshly caught wildebeest, it’s fin­
ished digesting the meat within a few hours. A plant-eating animal has a much 
longer set of intestines, so the body can spend more time absorbing the nutri­
ents available in plant foods. The human body has intestines that are ten 
times the length of the body. How’s that for a pretty clear indication that we 
were meant to be plant eaters?
Finding Protein in Vegan Foods
After you’ve done the math and understand how many grams of protein you 
need per day (see the earlier section “Protein needs for all ages and stages”), 
you need to plan to eat foods that will give you that amount every day. In this 
section, you find a helpful list of healthy vegan protein-rich foods to help you 
plan a delicious diet full of variety.
	
The best way to ensure that your body can use the vegetable-based protein 
that’s abundant in a vegan diet is to chew your food properly. Human saliva 
is the first step of the digestive process. Saliva, which contains salivary amy­
lase, and chewing help your body begin to break down carbohydrates and 
starches. Because a majority of vegan protein sources are rich in carbohy­
drates (think grains and beans), you need to break down your food well before 
swallowing it. After the food gets through your stomach and into your intes­
tines, your body can’t do much more to break down the fibers. And if your 
food is still in larger chunks, your body won’t be able to access all that nutri­
tion you have worked so hard to get on your plate.
Protein-rich vegan favorites
Once you look at the following list of vegan foods in Table 5-2 and their pro­
tein contents, you’ll feel much more comfortable creating healthy menus for 
yourself and your family. Get out your slide rule, or an old fashioned pen and 
paper, and figure out how much protein you need according to the formula 
listed earlier in this chapter. Put together a few days worth of menus that 
include the foods included on this list that also reach your daily needs for 
protein.

Including fermented foods 
for easy protein digestion
Some folks have problems digesting vegan sources of protein when they first 
make changes to their diet. If you haven’t eaten a lot of beans or soy foods in 
the past, you may experience some “musical” meals. Your intestines can do 
a better job digesting certain plant proteins if fermented proteins are used 
more often.

61
 Chapter 5: Protein Protocols
Pickled foods will also help your body adjust its digestion of certain proteins. 
In addition, Asian cultures believe that adding pickled vegetables to meals 
with fried foods will help you digest those fats better.
Fine fermented proteins
A realm of vegan proteins that brings up a fascinating topic is fermented 
foods. Fermentation is the process in which a food is exposed to a bacteria 
or culture. These living organisms, such as lactobacillus, which is found in 
yogurt, start living on and consuming the original food. These little critters 
actually break down the difficult-to-digest parts of foods, such as sugars and 
proteins, thereby making the nutrition easier for our bodies to absorb.
Fermented proteins, such as the soy foods tempeh, miso, and shoyu or tamari 
(the naturally brewed soy sauces), generally are easier for your body to digest.  
Fermented protein is digested more easily because it’s predigested by the 
healthy bacteria; your body is then better able to assimilate the nutrients, 
leading to better nutrition.
	
Tempeh is a great choice for people who have difficulty digesting plant-based 
proteins like beans or lightly processed soy foods such as tofu. Found in 
the refrigerator section of the grocery store, this bean product originated in 
Indonesia. Tempeh, which is made from whole soybeans that have been diced 
and exposed to a nontoxic mold called Rhizopus, is more of a whole food than 
tofu because it’s barely processed. Because tempeh is a fermented soy prod­
uct, its enzymes are partially broken down, making it easier to metabolize. It’s 
a complete protein and doesn’t produce the uncomfortable gas, stomach pain, 
and bloating that some other plant-based proteins do. Besides being a terrific 
cholesterol-free, easy-to-digest meat alternative, it’s also ideal for people on 
low-sodium diets. A great substitute for recipes that call for fish, poultry, or 
meat, this meaty bean product also can be crumbled to make pasta sauces 
just like Mom used to make. Try the Mushroom Sloppy Tempeh Joes recipe in 
Chapter 14 or the Tempeh Hash breakfast recipe in Chapter 12 for delicious 
fermented protein meals.
Pickles for better protein digestion
Pickled foods can help you digest other proteins. The bacteria found in the 
unpasteurized versions also increase vitamin levels of the pickled foods and 
help to promote a healthy digestive tract. Rather than using the pasteurized 
pickles found on grocery store shelves, which no longer contain the beneficial 
bacteria, try the fresh pickles from the refrigerated section or Asian markets.
	
You can also make your own at home using the Homemade Pickled Vegetables 
recipe in Chapter 13.

62
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
Traditionally, these pickled or fermented foods are eaten with or after a 
heavy, fatty, or protein-rich meal to help aid digestion. It’s remarkable that 
this incredible knowledge has been used the world over by many cultures 
without anyone ever using the Internet or sharing a recipe. It has been simul­
taneously used around the world in various cultures because people knew 
the natural fermentation helped them digest their food better. Vegetable 
foods like sauerkraut from Eastern and Northern Europe, cucumber pickles, 
kimchee from Korea, yogurt and lemon pickles from India, and umeboshi 
plums from Japan are all examples of pickled foods that are traditionally 
eaten with protein-rich meals to help the digestion process.
Soy, oh boy! The controversy 
and confusion
If you pay any attention to health and nutrition in the news, things can get a 
little confusing, especially when it comes to the topic of soy. One week soy 
foods and tofu are applauded in the media as a way to avoid heart disease 
and cancer, and the next week they’re vilified as the cause of other diseases 
and cancers. What’s the deal here? Consider the following contradictory 
statements:
	
✓	Soy is good and protects against breast cancer and should be eaten by 
healthy women and breast cancer patients.
	
	Soy is dangerous for women with estrogen-positive breast cancer or 
with a family history of breast cancer.
Combination, shmombination!
The seminal book Diet for a Small Planet by 
Frances Moore Lappe detailed the political, 
environmental, and moral impact of a meat-
based diet for a fledgling vegetarian movement 
in the early 1970s. Her book also made popu­
lar the idea that protein foods needed to be 
combined properly so that all the amino acids 
were present at each meal to form complete 
proteins. She created entire lists of combined 
foods, such as different whole grains with cer­
tain beans as well as a type of nut and a certain 
vegetable. Many vegetarians stuck to eating 
from these lists to ensure they were getting the 
proper protein. This rather arduous style of veg­
etarianism has since been proven unnecessary, 
however. By eating a varied vegan diet every 
day, including whole grains, beans, soy foods, 
and fresh fruits and veggies, you get all the 
protein you need. Lappe has recanted her own 
theory of food combination as inaccurate and 
has since written more books that offer valu­
able lessons about the food justice movements 
as well as global food scarcity.

63
 Chapter 5: Protein Protocols
	
✓	A study of Alzheimer’s patients found that rates were slightly higher in 
Hawaiian citizens who had eaten a lot of tofu over the course of their lives.
	
	Studies in Asia, where soy intake is generally high, show lower rates of 
Alzheimer’s.
	
✓	Contradictory studies from Harvard show that regular soy consumption 
raised or lowered sperm count in men.
Unfortunately, scientists don’t have enough evidence on either side to 
declare a winner.
A healthy vegan diet includes a wide variety of beans and legumes, and it 
shouldn’t rely on one food for a majority of its calories. Adding some edam­
ame (whole soybeans), tofu, tempeh, soy sauce, and miso to your diet isn’t 
dangerous. Unprocessed soy foods or lightly processed soy foods like tofu, 
soymilk, and miso can be used regularly without creating health concerns. 
However, relying on highly processed foods like soy hot dogs, soy ice cream, 
soy cheese, and soy burgers for your daily protein is a cause for concern. 
These foods often contain isolated soy protein (a highly refined powder 
made from defatted soy flour), abundant salt, preservatives, and other food 
additives that aren’t part of a healthy diet. (Check out the nearby sidebar 
“Isolated soy proteins: Whole foods or manufactured protein?” for more on 
how these proteins are created.)
	
Keep in mind that 99 percent of soybeans produced in the United States are 
genetically modified. These manufactured organisms don’t appear naturally 
in the world, and little to no testing has been performed to discover the pos­
sible health side effects these foods can cause. The only way to ensure you’re 
eating truly healthy soy products is to only buy organic soy.
	
The key to healthy vegan eating is to keep consuming a diet of mostly unpro­
cessed, whole foods to maintain high nutrient-per-calorie levels.
Isolated soy proteins: 
Whole foods or manufactured protein?
Isolated soy protein isn’t something you can 
make at home. It’s made in industrial factories 
where mashed soybeans are mixed with alter­
nating alkaline and acid washes to remove the 
fiber and separate the usable parts. The resulting 
curds are then spray-dried at high temperatures 
to create a powder that’s high in protein. Then 
the powder can be processed again with more 
high-temperature, high-pressure extrusions to 
make textured vegetable protein, or TVP. You 
wouldn’t call this a whole food.

Transforming Food into 
Health-Supportive Meals
In This Chapter
▶	Paying attention to food quality instead of quantity
▶	Choosing healthy, nutrient-dense foods from the key food groups
W
hether you’re converting to veganism straight from the standard 
American diet heavy with meat, dairy, and refined processed foods, 
or you’ve been a vegetarian for years, you can bolster your health-sustaining 
vegan diet with a little knowledge and planning. You don’t need to keep a 
food log or start making charts of percentages and proportions to ensure 
that your diet is truly whole and nutritious. Transforming your diet to include 
healthy ingredients and simple methods of preparation ensures that you 
won’t feel limited or deprived!
My love of food started in my mother’s garden when I was just a wee lass. 
I was given free range to gobble up ripe raspberries and pick all the sweet 
peas I could eat, so healthy food is ingrained in my brain as joyous and natu­
ral. Nothing tastes better than food from your own garden, freshly picked and 
perfectly ripe. This kind of energy can be re-created through every season in 
any region of the world.
Nourishing your body with vegan food is a great start — but focusing on 
health-supportive recipes and ingredients can affect every aspect of your 
mind, body, and mood. If you want real health, great energy, and long-lasting 
stamina, choose foods wisely. In this chapter, I show you how natural, plant-
based foods do more than just stop the rumbling in your tummy. I explain 
how the quality of your food is even more important than the quantity, and I 
help you begin to get in touch with your body’s cravings and deepest needs.

66
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
Focusing on Quality over Quantity
When clients ask me about serving sizes and portion control, I usually give 
them an answer that makes them look at me like I’m crazy. I don’t recom­
mend servings and portions.
Those numbers, weights, and percentages get in the way of truly balanced 
eating, because every person has a unique body and lifestyle as well as a spe­
cific schedule. Quantity and quality are important subjects to consider while 
moving forward into a vegan lifestyle.
The proportions of your portions
Every vegan’s body and metabolism are different. Some people feel better 
eating three regular meals a day, while others do better with five or six 
smaller, more frequent meals. If you sit in a chair all day, you may digest food 
slower and feel fine with three regular meals. If you have a more physical job, 
you can benefit from more frequent, smaller meals that will replenish your 
blood sugar and help you avoid an overly-full feeling. Give yourself a chance 
to experiment with both eating styles to see which method works best for 
you and your lifestyle. Pay attention to the total quantity of foods you con­
sume with three meals a day versus more frequent, smaller meals.
	
Gauge your energy levels throughout the day and notice if you feel better 
with a small snack before or after lunch. Try a protein-rich snack of nuts or 
hummus with carrots in the morning and fresh fruit in the afternoon. If your 
body doesn’t respond well to those foods at those times of day, switch them 
around.
	
Choosing a variety of plant-based foods provides you with all the nutrition 
you need! Make sure you’re choosing protein, complex carbohydrates, and 
mineral-rich ingredients for each meal. This variety of whole and fresh food 
will protect your long-term health.
Quality is key
Rather than focusing on specific serving sizes, choose your meals from a 
wide variety of truly healthy and whole foods throughout the day. Nutritional 
experts’ understanding of food has led to a better understanding on a scien­
tific level of what real food includes. It’s simply much more difficult to eat 500 
calories of brown rice than 500 calories of cheese. When you eat a huge bowl 
of fresh vegetable salad with some cooked garbanzo beans, slivered almonds, 
shredded carrots, avocado, cherry tomatoes, lemon juice, and olive oil, 
you’re giving your body the recommended daily servings of vegetables, but 

67
 Chapter 6: Transforming Food into Health-Supportive Meals
you’re also getting a whopping dose of fiber, antioxidants, vitamin C, protein, 
healthy fat, and phytochemicals that support your body in countless ways.
A healthy vegan diet is mainly comprised of proteins, complex carbohy­
drates, healthy fats, and unrefined sugars. Choose a variety of proteins from 
the lists and suggestions in Chapter 5, and foods that offer consistent iron, 
calcium, B12, and other nutrients from the lists in Chapter 4. Planning your 
menus on paper using the charts in Chapter 9 for the first few months of your 
vegan life will help you put together delicious meals that are truly supportive 
of your health.
Picking and Choosing: Healthy 
Vegan Food Groups
Your body needs to consume amino acids and protein, carbohydrates, min­
erals, vitamins, and water to survive. Choosing vegan foods that provide all 
these essential dietary players isn’t difficult. Plant foods offer everything you 
need in terms of nutrition; they also offer a variety of colors, complex flavors, 
textures, cooking techniques, and preparation methods.
	
The most important qualities to remember when choosing foods are variety 
and vitality. Choose foods that are fresh and nutrient rich, not overly pro­
cessed and packaged. Get to know the food groups in the following sections 
and begin to experiment with different ways to get several servings of each 
into your diet on a regular basis. You also can use Figure 6-1 as a guide.
Complex carbohydrates
Most healthy eating guides and gurus recommend getting most of your 
calories from complex carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates are the main 
source of fuel for human activity and productivity. The old USDA food pyra­
mid recommended 6 to 11 servings of grain-based foods a day — that seems 
like a lot, especially when there was no talk of quality! Nowadays, nutritional 
experts know better, and they recognize the division between processed, 
refined carbohydrates and whole, complex carbohydrates. White bread and 
bagels, white sugar, and high-fructose corn syrup are common refined car­
bohydrates found in American homes. When you look at the true nature of 
foods that contain complex carbohydrates, such as beans, whole grains, and 
vegetables, getting most of your calories from this group doesn’t seem hard 
or unhealthy at all.
You find complex carbohydrates in brown rice, millet, quinoa, barley, yams, 
potatoes, beans, legumes, and whole-grain flour products like crackers, 
bread, pasta, and seeds. When you look at this wider variety of sources, then 

68
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
yes, getting most of your calories from complex, carb-rich food makes sense. 
You’re not just getting the carbs; you’re also getting minerals, protein, vita­
mins, and good fiber. These complex carbohydrate foods are nutrient-dense, 
meaning you get more nutrition per serving than a refined carbohydrate 
offers.

Seasonal veggies
In the last 100 years, modern technology has created a seasonless super­
market. Global transportation systems and long growing seasons in places 
like California and Florida have created a situation where you can get pretty 
much any kind of food you want at any time. But is this style of eating 
healthy?
	
By choosing to eat local and seasonal fruits and vegetables for most of your 
needs instead of produce that was grown in another hemisphere and shipped 
halfway around the world to your table, you accomplish several goals at once. 
Not only are you supporting local economies and farmers, you’re actually get­
ting better nutrition. As soon as most fruits or vegetables are harvested, they 
start losing nutrients. The fresher the better — and an apple grown in New 
Zealand takes at least a few days to get to the United States!

69
 Chapter 6: Transforming Food into Health-Supportive Meals
Eating seasonally also keeps your body in tune with the natural variations in 
temperature that occur throughout the year. Eating raw fruits and vegetables 
in the summer makes sense as it keeps your body cool and allows you to take 
advantage of local produce. Choose heartier fall and winter produce during 
the colder months. The foods growing near you in these darker days are rec­
ommended in the Ayurvedic and Macrobiotic culinary and medical traditions 
to keep your body healthy through the cold and flu seasons.
Eating some frozen blueberries or canned tomatoes in the winter won’t imme­
diately cause you to catch a cold. Still, focusing on local, seasonal produce 
will fortify you with nutrients and energy needed at certain times of year. Let 
the seasons help guide your choices:
	
✓	In spring, focus on leafy vegetables that really embody the new energy 
of the season, including green chard, spinach, lettuces, and herbs like 
basil and parsley.
	
✓	Summer is abundant with natural cooling foods from Ayurveda and 
Traditional Chinese Medicine, such as berries, summer squash, zuc­
chini, watermelon, corn, pears, cilantro, and peppermint.
	
✓	The harvest of fall and winter vegetables, such as carrots, onions, sweet 
potatoes, pumpkins, squashes, and warming spices (cayenne pepper, 
cinnamon, nutmeg, and curry powder), brings more warming energy to 
the human body.
Sea vegetables
When I think nutrient-dense food, I think sea vegetables. These gems of the 
ocean are incredibly valuable for vegans and anyone who wants to be truly 
healthy and vibrant. While the American palate may not be used to the taste 
of sea vegetables, or seaweed, cultures like Japan, Iceland, Ireland, China, 
and many others have been using native sea vegetables for centuries.
Sea vegetables provide the widest variety of minerals available of any food 
group, including all the minerals that are found in human blood and, not coin­
cidentally, the ocean. A great source of iron, calcium, vitamin K, iodine, and 
B vitamins, several sea veggies also are good sources of magnesium and 
cancer-fighting lignans. Lignans are phytoestrogens that have antioxidant 
activity and have been shown to protect the body from certain cancers, 
osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. Used for inflammatory conditions, 
cancer treatment and prevention, and to boost the immune systems, sea veg­
etables also are a source of plant protein.

70
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
Hundreds of types of sea vegetables are edible, and because of their recent 
uptick in popularity, they’re becoming easier to find in grocery stores, health 
food stores, and ethnic markets. Just a small amount, about 2 to 3 table­
spoons, every day of the following is beneficial:
	
✓	Nori: Popular because of its role in making sushi rolls. You can buy this 
dark, green-black paper in page-sized sheets. It’s easy to carry around 
for snacks and lunch — just snip a sheet with kitchen scissors to add to 
your meal. No other preparation is needed.
	
✓	Arame: These little black wires are mild tasting compared to other sea 
veggies. Wash arame well, soak for 5 minutes, and drain before cooking. 
Good in soups and combined with tofu dishes, arame doubles in volume 
when cooked.
	
✓	Dulse: You can find this reddish-brown sea veggie in flattened, chewy 
ribbons or flakes. The flakes need no preparation, and you can sprinkle 
them directly on food. The ribbons are soft enough that you only need 
to rinse them before adding them to a recipe, unless otherwise directed.
	
✓	Hijiki: Easy to prepare, these little, wiry, spaghetti-like strands have a 
strong flavor. Simply rinse and soak for 5 minutes before adding to a 
recipe, or eat raw tossed into a salad.
	
✓	Kelp: Kelp is sold in flakes, powder, or flat ribbons, and you can add it to 
soups and stews after rinsing it off.
	
✓	Kombu: Kombu’s secret power is that it helps you digest beans and 
prevents gas. Add a 2- or 3-inch piece of rinsed, dark kombu to a pot of 
cooking beans or soup. To add it to a recipe, simply soak in warm water 
for 10 to 15 minutes and chop.
	
✓	Wakame: If you’ve ever ordered miso soup, you’ve eaten wakame. This 
soft, green, silky sea vegetable is mild tasting and easy to cook. Rinse 
the wakame and then soak in warm water for 5 to 7 minutes. Rinse again, 
chop, and add to your recipe.
	
Want to try some easy techniques for cooking sea veggies? Hijiki is a nice 
addition to salads. Just toss one or two tablespoons with chopped lettuce 
and your favorite dressing. Prepare dulse, kombu, or wakame according to 
package directions and add a small handful to soup. You can even buy small 
shaker containers of sea vegetable flakes to keep on your table. Just shake a 
little on top of your meal, sandwich, soup, or salad!
	
Unless you’re going with an expert, don’t try collecting your own sea vegetables 
in the wild. Certain coastal areas are polluted with toxins, and other sea beds 
may harbor bacteria that you don’t want to consume with your miso soup.

Finding good fruits
I’ve heard health experts complain that Americans eat the same five or six 
fruits their entire lives. I’ve seen similar eating habits with my clients, and 
I do think that everyone could benefit from a wider variety of fruity foods 
in their diets. Fruits are defined as the ripened reproductive body of a seed 
plant, which means that any plant you eat that contains seeds is a fruit. 
Officially, this means that tomatoes, eggplants, and cucumbers are fruit. That 
scientific fact doesn’t matter much to me — I just want to encourage people 
to eat more fruits and vegetables, period.
	
Eating fresh fruit regularly has been shown to reduce the risk of developing 
diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and certain cancers. Fruits also fortify 
the body with the nutrients it needs to fight infection and repair cells.
Fruits are generally easier for people to increase in their diet than vegetables 
because they’re sweet, they don’t need a lot of preparation, and you can take 
them to school or work as a quick, healthy snack. So which fruits are most 
beneficial to your health? Well, it’s difficult to pick a few specific superfruits, 
but here’s a list of fruit-related tips to keep in mind:
	
✓	Try to eat two to three pieces of fresh fruit every day. An easy way to 
do this is to make a smoothie for breakfast. You can include a banana 
and two other fruits as the base and kick-start your day quickly.
	
✓	Choose some of these super fruits for your daily menus:
 
• Berries, including blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and 
strawberries, are high in vitamin C, folate, and phytochemicals.
 
• Pomegranate seeds are very high in antioxidants, and the juice is 
used to help inflammatory conditions.
 
• Acai berries also are high in antioxidants and are a good source 
of essential oils. They’re believed to help the body slow the aging 
process as well.
	
✓	Buy seasonal fruit from your farmer’s market. Not only is the fruit 
super fresh and at its optimum taste, but it also has more nutrients.
	
✓	If you drink fruit juice, try to drink fresh-squeezed, unsweetened juice. 
Investing in a juicer gives you the option of drinking many servings of 
fruit in one glass.
	
✓	Fresh fruits are best, but frozen fruit and berries are good, too. 
Canned fruit is a very distant third choice.
	
✓	If you consume tropical fruits and their products, such as acai ber­
ries, mangosteen, noni juice, and goji berries or goji juice, make sure 
they’re naturally sweetened. These products have been in the news 
lately because of their purported anti-cancer and weight-loss action.

Proper proteins: Beans and legumes
Beans and legumes are great sources of nutrition, no matter which one you 
choose. Higher in protein and fat than whole grains, beans and legumes, 
when combined with grains, give you all the amino acids to form a complete 
protein. Completely cholesterol-free, beans are a good source of iron, cal­
cium, phosphorus, vitamin E, and thiamin. Beans are useful in fighting several 
diseases because of their high fiber content. Bean dishes provide a slow drip 
of energy, fortify the body and blood, and are truly satisfying.
When buying beans and legumes, quality is important. Several studies have 
shown that organic foods, including beans, offer your body more nutrition 
because they’re grown in healthier soil.
	
A multiyear study by the European Union declared that organic foods offer 
higher nutrition than conventionally raised foods, and often have higher levels 
of cancer-fighting antioxidants.
Color me healthy: The rainbow color code
Eating a rainbow of colorful fruits and vegeta­
bles on a regular basis will flood your body and 
bloodstream with powerful chemicals.
	✓	Red: Strawberries, tomatoes, red bell pep­
pers, beets, pomegranates, red apples, 
cayenne pepper, dulse, and watermelon 
contain lycopene, which the body uses to 
fight cancer and cardiovascular disease.
	✓	Orange/yellow: Oranges, carrots, winter 
squash, orange bell peppers, peaches, 
mangos, pineapple, papayas, nectarines, 
and hot peppers offer alpha and beta 
carotene, antioxidants used to protect eye 
health and some skin diseases. The citrus 
fruits also provide folate, which help to 
reduce the risk of birth defects.
	✓	Green: Leafy green vegetables, edible 
algae, lettuce, and sprouts all teem with 
chlorophyll. This powerful green aspect of 
plants is believed to protect the body from 
cancers, increases stores of red blood 
cells, binds with and removes heavy metals 
from the blood, is anti-inflammatory, and 
even prevents bad breath.
	✓	Blue/purple: Blueberries are very high in 
vitamin C and offer a good dose of manga­
nese. As antioxidant powerhouses, these 
little blue nuggets of nutrition will increase 
the power of any breakfast. High in cancer-
preventing flavonoids proanthocyanidins, 
purple foods include eggplant, peppers, 
purple cabbage, plums, prunes, and grapes.
	✓	White: Bananas, cauliflower, garlic, ginger, 
jicama, mushrooms, onions, parsnips, pota­
toes, and turnips contain anthoxanthins, 
which help to lower cholesterol and blood 
pressure, helping lower the risk of heart 
disease.

73
 Chapter 6: Transforming Food into Health-Supportive Meals
Canned beans are convenient and relatively inexpensive, so keeping sev­
eral types in your cupboard makes financial sense. Bulk dry beans are even 
cheaper and are very simple to cook. Just look for uniformly sized beans that 
are smooth and free of wrinkles, cracks, and pits. Store each type of dry bean 
in an airtight glass jar, away from light and heat.
Aw, nuts! (And seeds)
Rich in protein, healthy monounsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, 
nuts and seeds are wonderful additions to a vegan diet. Just because they’re 
high in fat doesn’t mean they’ll make you fat! Eaten in moderation, nuts and 
seeds help you feel full faster, which can help you to eat less overall.
	
To make them even more nutritious and easy to digest, you can soak nuts and 
seeds overnight in cool water. This starts the germination process and acti­
vates certain enzymes that pre-digest some of the proteins and fats, increasing 
certain nutrients, and make it easier for the body to break down the fats and 
protein. Store your raw nuts in the refrigerator or freezer to preserve their 
natural oils.
Either raw or soaked, nuts and seeds are easy to carry with you, so grab a 
container or baggie and fill up on some of these little, nutrition-rich nuggets:
	
✓	Almonds: A good source of protein, vitamin E, manganese, magnesium, 
copper, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), and phosphorus, almonds help lower 
bad cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart disease, and provide protection 
against cardiovascular disease. Eating raw almonds with the skin still on 
provides the most heart-healthy benefits.
	
✓	Cashews: Cashews are lower in fats and higher in antioxidants than 
most nuts. A good source of monounsaturated fats, copper, and magne­
sium, cashews promote good cardiovascular health, even for diabetics.
	
✓	Flaxseeds: Flaxseeds, also known as linseeds, are a great source of 
omega-3 fatty acids. Flaxseeds offer anti-inflammatory benefits and pro­
tect against heart disease, breast cancer, high cholesterol, and diabetes. 
Flaxseeds are rich in fiber and manganese and also are a good source of 
folate, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), magnesium, phosphorous, copper, and 
lignan phytonutrients.
	
	To get the most nutrition and benefits from flaxseeds, grind them fresh 
with a blender or spice grinder. You also can buy ground flax meal; just 
be sure to store it in the freezer between uses to protect the delicate 
fats from breaking down in heat and light. Use ground flaxseeds in home­
made smoothies, oatmeal, soup, or on top of salads and grain dishes.

74
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
	
✓	Peanuts: Officially a legume, heart-healthy peanuts are a good source of 
monounsaturated fat, antioxidants, phytosterols, phytic acid (inositol 
hexaphosphate), and folic acid. Peanuts also are a good source of vita­
min B3 (niacin), folate, copper, manganese, and protein, and they’re a 
significant source of resveratrol, which is being studied for its anti-aging 
effects. Peanuts and peanut butter also may help prevent gallstones 
and protect against Alzheimer’s disease. Always store your raw peanuts 
and peanut butter in the freezer or refrigerator, respectively, to prevent 
mold.
	
✓	Pepitas/pumpkin seeds: Pumpkin seeds are a good source of the essen­
tial fatty acids, copper, iron, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium, 
manganese, zinc, protein, and vitamin K. These little green seeds may 
promote prostate and bone health and offer anti-inflammatory benefits.
	
✓	Sesame seeds: Sesame seeds and tahini, or sesame butter, are rich in 
beneficial minerals. Tahini is a good source of manganese, copper, and 
calcium. Good for lowering cholesterol, sesame seeds also are recom­
mended for rheumatoid arthritis.
	
	To really gain access to sesame seeds’ benefits, it’s best to grind or 
smash them before eating. Tahini already is ground into a paste, and 
therefore, it’s an easy way to eat sesame’s goodness.
	
✓	Sunflower seeds: Offering anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular ben­
efits, sunflower seeds lower cholesterol and help to prevent cancer. A 
good source of vitamin E, sunflower seeds also provide linoleic acid (an 
essential fatty acid), fiber, protein, and minerals such as magnesium and 
selenium.
	
✓	Walnuts: Walnuts are an excellent source of omega-3 essential fatty 
acids, manganese, and copper. Good for cardiovascular health and low­
ering cholesterol, walnuts also help brain function.
Healthy fats
Good fats are healthy for you — look at any healthy, glowing raw foodist or 
vegan who scarfs down handfuls of nuts and bowls of avocados regularly to 
see what I mean. Diets that include the monounsaturated fats from nuts and 
seeds, olives, avocados, and unrefined vegetable oils like olive and canola oil 
lower the risk of heart disease, still the leading cause of death in the United 
States.
Fat is a source of energy for the body, supplying 9 calories per gram, which 
is more than carbohydrates and protein supply. Fat is necessary for many 
bodily functions like protecting and cushioning internal organs and helping 
the body absorb vitamins like A, E, D, and K.
Omega-3 fatty acids, found in good amounts in flax and hemp seeds, are 
important for treating conditions such as allergies, arthritis, eczema, 

75
 Chapter 6: Transforming Food into Health-Supportive Meals
inflammatory diseases, learning problems, and depression. Good sources 
of omega-6 fats are most of the vegan cooking oils like olive, safflower, soy­
bean, and sesame. Nuts and seeds also contain omega-6 fatty acids. Many 
health experts believe that the balanced consumption of omega-6 to omega-3 
fatty acids should ideally be three to one. Because vegetable oils are more 
common for cooking, it’s important to include the omega-3 rich foods often to 
ensure the proper balance.
Supportive sweets
I’ve loved to bake since childhood, but my relationship with sugar has 
changed greatly over the years. Long gone are the days of slurping down 
Super Big Gulps and munching candy bars between classes. But I still love a 
good cookie! A healthy vegan diet can include sweets and baked goods, but 
they must be consumed thoughtfully. You can find several sweeteners that 
are healthier than refined white sugar.
Sugar is not the devil — the human brain is just hard-wired to crave it, and 
it has never been easier to get your hands on the stuff. Back when humans 
were foraging and hunting for food, sugar was hard to come by. Naturally 
sweet fruits, vegetables, and honey were hard to find and were limited by 
season and geography. Today, you can have sugar for every meal of the day, 
and many people often do!
So rather than load up on the refined white stuff, use these natural, mellower 
sweeteners. They won’t hit your bloodstream like lightning the way white 
sugar does, but you can still use these sweeteners moderately to create 
lovely treats and desserts:
	
✓	Agave: A natural syrup derived from the same plant that’s used to make 
tequila, agave has a low glycemic level when used a teaspoon at a time. 
The darker the syrup, the more minerals it has, so the richer the taste. 
Because agave is sweeter than sugar, you can use less in your baking 
recipes for cupcakes, cookies, puddings, sweet sauces, quick breads, 
and scones. It’s also a wonderful sweetener for hot and iced teas and 
coffee. Agave can be found at health food stores and gourmet grocery 
stores.
	
✓	Blackstrap molasses: A byproduct of the sugar-refining process, molas­
ses comes from sugar cane. The thick black syrup is full of minerals. A 
good source of iron, blackstrap molasses provides a good amount of cal­
cium, copper, manganese, potassium, and magnesium. Switching from 
refined, nutrient-poor white sugar, corn syrup, or artificial sweeteners 
to blackstrap molasses is a sweet idea. Excellent for baked goods like 
muffins, ginger cookies, and banana bread, blackstrap molasses can be 
found in your local health food store and in many grocery stores.

76
Part II: Building a Healthy Vegan Diet 
	
✓	Brown rice syrup: This gooey syrup is made from cooked rice. Light and 
mild tasting, and about half as sweet as sugar, it’s good for cakes, pas­
tries, and puddings. You also can stir it into tea and coffee. This polysac­
charide is a more complex sugar than agave, so it releases more slowly 
into the bloodstream.
	
✓	Date sugar: This granular sweetener is made from dried, pulverized 
dates. Because these little flecks don’t melt like regular cane sugar, and 
because they’re very sweet, I suggest that you use two-thirds of the rec­
ommended amount of sugar when using date sugar in recipes for cook­
ies, pies, cakes, and scones.
	
✓	Maple syrup: Fifty gallons of maple water are required to boil down to 
one gallon of maple syrup. This syrup concentrate is an excellent source 
of manganese and a good source of zinc. Grade B syrup is darker than 
Grade A, and because it offers a more pronounced taste than sugar, 
Grade B syrup is good for baking sweet breads, scones, cookies, pud­
dings, mousses, and savory marinades. Be sure to keep maple syrup in 
the refrigerator after you open it. Found at health food stores and gour­
met grocery stores, some states like New York don’t allow Grade B to be 
sold to the public in stores.
	
✓	Stevia: Found in either powder or liquid form, this super concentrated 
sweetener is derived from the leaves of a South American plant. Because 
stevia is 100 times sweeter than sugar, you must use it in tiny amounts 
if you buy it in a concentrated form. Stevia has no carbohydrates, so it 
doesn’t affect blood sugar at all, making it a good alternative for diabet­
ics and people with other sugar problems.
	
✓	Xylitol: Made most often from birch trees, this natural sweetener is a 
sugar alcohol and is actually good for preventing cavities and revers­
ing tooth decay. You can find xylitol in crystalline form in health food 
stores, and though it’s expensive, it’s a good, healthy sweetener option 
for baking.
	
	Xylitol has been known to cause diarrhea or loose stools for some, so 
use caution.

A
fter you’re on board with all the reasons that a 
vegan diet is the right choice for you and how it can 
provide you with everything you need nutritionally, mak­
ing this healthy and ethical diet a reality requires plan­
ning, strategy, and know-how.
The chapters in this part detail how to shop in a new world 
of health food stores, farmer’s markets, and unexplored 
aisles at your old supermarket. You determine what you 
need to plan for when creating your new vegan kitchen, 
menus, and home. Even old family recipes can be enjoyed 
with some tweaks and experimentation. Finally, under­
standing how to live with nonvegans is an important part 
of this journey, so commit to memory the tips on cooking 
and living with your fellow meat eaters.

▶	Becoming a savvy vegan shopper
T
wo of the most challenging aspects of adopting a vegan diet are figuring 
out what to eat and how to cook in a new style. Setting up your vegan 
kitchen requires some thought, and you need to analyze your past and future 
ideas about cooking in order to use your culinary skills and create healthy, 
delicious food in this new vegan style. This chapter helps you figure out the 
tools you need and how to get started. You also get the lowdown on stocking 
your pantry with quality vegan basics and supplies while weeding out old, 
animal-derived goods. This chapter also helps you understand which ingredi­
ents on food labels are hidden traps for vegans.
	
Feeling confident in your kitchen and knowing that you have foundational 
vegan ingredients and supplies on hand will empower you to create healthy, 
delicious meals for your fast-moving, vegan-rific lifestyle.
Gearing Up with Basic 
Cooking Equipment
To eat is human, to cook, divine. Living a vegan lifestyle without cooking for 
yourself is possible, but doing so can be expensive and arduous. Besides, 
cooking for yourself is a basic life skill that allows you to practice the power­
ful tool of self-healing with your own conscious energy.

Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
Choosing and using the appropriate kitchen gear enables you to consistently 
cook up healthy, plant-based fare. If you aren’t already comfortable in the 
kitchen, don’t worry about purchasing the fancy one-job gadgets yet. Instead, 
focus on the items in this section that do double duty. Doing so allows you to 
reduce the amount of money you need to spend to get started. If you already 
cook somewhat regularly, you probably own many of these items.
Pots, pans, and bakeware
A few good-quality pots and pans will take you far in your cooking. How can 
you tell if these items are good quality? Look for terms like “good heat con­
ductor” and “heavy gauge.” You’re safest with stainless steel, cast iron, or 
enamel, because these types of pans won’t react with most foods. Teflon and 
most nonstick pans can chip over time, allowing chemicals to leach into your 
food. Plain aluminum pots and pans can react to foods that are acidic, like 
tomato-based recipes, which can make the foods taste metallic. The following 
list can help you build your collection of pots, pans, and bakeware. As you 
build your collection, you can add more as you need. Here are some of the 
essentials you should consider buying:
	
✓	A 10- to 12-inch high-sided stainless-steel sauté pan with a lid for 
frying, braising vegetables, sautéing, and making sauces, rice pilafs, and 
risottos
	
✓	A 3-quart saucepan for steaming vegetables and cooking grains and 
pastas
	
✓	A 5-quart saucepan for cooking soups, stews, and chilies
	
✓	A 10-inch cast-iron skillet, which will become more nonstick as it’s used 
and seasoned (without the harmful and toxic chemicals that Teflon or 
other nonstick pans often contain)
	
	Cooking in cast-iron pans actually increases the amount of iron in your 
food, a fact that’s good for nonmeat eaters to know! After all, adequate 
dietary intake of iron is important for healthy blood production.
	
✓	One or two cookie sheets for baking cookies, biscuits, scones, and 
roasting vegetables
	
✓	A 13-x-9-inch glass baking pan for making casseroles, lasagna, and other 
entrees
	
✓	A 9-x-5-inch metal bread loaf pan for sweet and savory breads
	
✓	A 9-inch-diameter round cake pan to bake layer cakes
	
✓	An 8-inch square cake pan for brownies and other cakes
	
✓	A 9-inch pie pan to wow your family with fresh pies

81
 Chapter 7: Cooking and Shopping Like a Vegan
Cooking utensils
The right tool for the job streamlines your cooking. I prefer tools that serve 
more than one function so my kitchen isn’t stuffed with single-job items. Saving 
space leaves more room for better organization. You can accomplish just 
about any basic vegan cooking task with the following cooking implements:
	
✓	Three nesting mixing bowls: Stainless steel bowls are lightweight and 
easy to clean. However, heavier glass bowls stay put as you stir.
	
✓	One set of dry measuring cups: I recommend getting these cups in 1 
cup, 1⁄2 cup, 1⁄3 cup, and 1⁄4 cup sizes. These cups can be used to measure 
dry ingredients like whole grains, flour, or chopped nuts.
	
✓	One set of measuring spoons: Spoons in 1 tablespoon, 1 teaspoon, 1⁄2 
teaspoon, 1⁄4 teaspoon, and 1⁄8 teaspoon sizes work well. Plastic or metal 
spoons are good options.
	
✓	A 2- or 4-cup liquid measuring cup: I love the new ones where you can 
pour liquid in and look down (instead of leaning over and looking to the 
side) to read the measurement — brilliant!
	
✓	A vegetable peeler: A Y-shaped peeler is best because you can use it for 
potatoes, apples, and harder squashes, too. The ceramic blades won’t 
rust as easily as the metal peelers.
	
✓	A fine mesh, bowl-shaped strainer: This tool can be used for washing 
grains and straining tea or infusions.
	
✓	A colander: Use your colander for rinsing veggies and fruit as well as for 
draining pasta and cooked vegetables.
	
✓	A wooden cutting board: A board of at least 12 x 14 inches works well 
for most of your cooking needs.
	
	To keep your cutting board from slipping and sliding while you chop up 
your veggies, place a couple of slightly damp kitchen or paper towels 
underneath it for traction.
	
	Avoid plastic cutting boards so you don’t ingest microscopic bits of 
plastic that chip off over time.
	
✓	A rolling pin: You have three types to choose from these days: a long, 
smooth wooden cylinder with tapered ends for your hands, a traditional 
pin with handles, and now silpat pins that are nonstick and work great 
for delicate pie crusts. I love the silpat and wooden cylinders because 
they’re both easy to clean.
	
✓	A rubber spatula: A traditional rubber spatula is great, but you may 
prefer a “spoonula,” which has more of a scoop to it.

82
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
✓	Kitchen tongs: These tongs are great for lifting hot tempeh bacon and 
other items out of a pan, tossing a salad with dressing, scooping vegetables 
from boiling water, and placing hot food on composed plates. They’re also 
invaluable for germ-a-phobes who don’t want someone else’s hands touch­
ing their food.
	
✓	A wire or bamboo steaming basket: These baskets are wonderful for 
steaming veggies.
	
✓	A timer: Timing is everything in cooking, so be sure to invest in a 
timer to avoid overcooking your dishes. You also can use it to limit the 
amount of time you spend on Facebook — I’m allowed 20 minutes a day.
	
✓	A wire whisk: Whisking allows for the proper combining of liquids such 
as homemade salad dressings or the adding of wet ingredients into dry.
	
✓	A few wooden spoons: Wooden spoons are indispensible in the kitchen; 
they’re easy to grab and they clean up in a snap.
	
✓	A slotted spoon: Wooden or stainless steel work well for scooping veg­
gies, pasta, beans, or other bits out of water.
	
✓	A microplane: This type of grater, which is sometimes called a “ginger 
grater” or “micro-zester,” is great for zesting citrus fruits and grating 
ginger or nutmeg.
	
✓	A metal spatula: Perfect for the vegan grill-master in charge of flipping 
veggie burgers. A metal spatula also is useful for turning pancakes or 
sautéed tofu in a skillet.
Knives
You can remove that huge butcher block of knives cluttering your counter; 
vegans don’t need all those steak and boning knives! However, a few good 
knives are essential for any chef — vegan or otherwise. I use the following 
knives most often (see Figure 7-1):
	
✓	A serrated bread knife that’s at least 10 inches long (this knife is great 
for bread but also perfect for thinly slicing tomatoes)
	
✓	An 8- to 10-inch chef’s knife for chopping vegetables
	
✓	A paring knife, used for peeling fruit and broccoli stems, coring apples 
and pears, and several other basic kitchen tasks
You also want to get a sharpening steel that you can use to sharpen your 
knives at home. High-carbon steel knives are easier to sharpen at home.

83
 Chapter 7: Cooking and Shopping Like a Vegan
	
Figure 7-1: 
The basic 
knives that 
any cook 
should have.
	
	
Go to a home or kitchen store and hold several brands and styles of knives 
to get a feel for which ones you like best. Consider how heavy the knife feels, 
how easy the grip feels, and whether you like the balance of the weight as you 
rock it back and forth across a cutting surface.
	
Sharp knives are safe knives! Have your knives professionally sharpened one 
or two times per year, and then use your steel at home regularly. The sharper 
the knife, the less pressure you need to cut, which prevents spastic flailing of 
knives in the kitchen.
Is my old cookware considered vegan?
A common concern among new vegans is 
whether their old cooking equipment, which 
once cooked and prepared animal foods, is 
considered vegan. For example, a baking dish 
that was used to broil meat can still be used 
to roast cauliflower, but is it still vegan? The 
answer lies with you and your personal com­
fort level. In my opinion, we already consume 
more than our fair share of material goods, so I 
choose to allow my family and friends to use my 
kitchen tools for their nonvegan cooking. Doing 
so is more earth friendly and takes up less 
space in my cramped cabinets. For me, these 
values are more important.
If you feel terribly uncomfortable with using old 
dishes and utensils that once touched meat and 
can afford to do so, consider donating or selling 
your used kitchen tools and buy new, unused 
items. Vegans are obliged to consider their 
consumption based on several levels: environ­
mental friendliness, personal health, and animal 
safety. If you share a kitchen with nonvegans, 
discuss your wishes with your housemates if 
you prefer to keep cooking tools separate. For 
more in-depth discussion on living in harmony 
with meat eaters, see Chapter 8.
Note: If sharing gadgets doesn’t bother you, be 
sure to make the necessity of extreme cleanli­
ness clear when it comes to preparing animal 
foods. Cross-contamination of food-borne ill­
nesses can easily occur in a mixed diet kitchen.

Special equipment to consider
The preceding sections cover the basics, but in this section I want to introduce 
you to a few more fun and useful kitchen items that can add a lot of power to 
your recipe repertoire. These items allow you the versatility to save time and 
dish washing and increase your success when attempting more complicated 
dishes and party menus. These specialized tools include the following:
	
✓	An immersion or “stick” blender for blending soups in the pot and creat­
ing smooth, creamy sauces without using the extra dishes that a counter 
top blender does
	
✓	An electric rice cooker for cooking all kinds of grains and saving space 
on the stove
	
✓	A toaster oven for quick reheats and toasting without having to use the 
whole oven or the microwave (whose safety and healthfulness is ques­
tionable; see the nearby sidebar, “Rethinking the microwave”)
	
✓	A food processor for chopping, grating, and mixing larger quantities 
quickly
	
✓	Washable kitchen scissors for cutting herbs, opening packaging, and 
trimming veggies
	
✓	A mortar and pestle, sometimes called a suribachi, for grinding herbs, 
spices, mixtures, and pastes
	
✓	A silicon or nylon pastry brush (the new silicon brushes are much easier 
to clean and can be used for both sweet and savory applications)
	
✓	A funnel for pouring homemade sauces, purees, and other liquids into 
smaller receptacles
Rethinking the microwave
A microwave may seem like a kitchen must-
have, but as you turn the corner and start down 
the path of a healthier way of eating and living, 
I encourage you to reconsider the microwave’s 
role in your kitchen. According to many doctors 
and nutrition experts, microwave ovens create 
carcinogenic compounds in food and destroy 
much of the nutrition found in natural foods. 
Apart from these health concerns, microwave 
cooking tends to encourage reliance on frozen 
and processed meals. Cooking or reheating 
natural foods on your stove top or in a toaster 
oven takes a tiny bit more time, but it tends to be 
healthier and tastier!

85
 Chapter 7: Cooking and Shopping Like a Vegan
Filling Your Kitchen with 
Wholesome Whole Foods
It’s simply smart (and easy!) to stock up on a variety of whole foods, those 
foods that have all their original, edible parts intact (see the nearby sidebar 
“The skinny on whole foods” for more info). Fresh, packaged, canned, and 
frozen whole foods allow flexibility for your personal tastes and nutritional 
needs.
Fresh foods are definitely more healthful, but it’s unrealistic to think that 
everyone can rely completely on fresh food. So stock your cupboard with 
the basics listed in this section to provide yourself with a variety of menu 
options. Rely on these packaged, canned, and frozen foods to round out your 
on-hand options. Whole grains and other cereal products, legumes such as 
beans, peas, and lentils, as well as herbs, spices, seasonings, and canned and 
frozen goods are inexpensive and smart pantry essentials.
	
To ensure your success, prepare your pantry in steps with a clear goal of 
where you want to go. Compile lists of foods you want to accrue over time, 
choose a handful of beginning recipes, and cut yourself some slack: This tran­
sition will be bumpy for a while. With a little practice and continued educa­
tion, your new vegan lifestyle will work out nicely!
Great grains
Whole grains and other cereal products provide excellent complex carbohy­
drates, minerals, and energy in the form of protein and healthy fats. These 
nutritional must-haves are so versatile that they’re an excellent choice for 
every meal: breakfast porridge, side dish, or entree for lunch and dinner. You 
can even bake them into breads and desserts! Eating grains in whole, stone-
ground, sprouted, split, or cracked varieties ensures that you’re getting great 
nutrition.
	
When buying cereal and grain products like pasta, bread, crackers, and boxed 
cereal, check the ingredients for natural sweeteners like agave, molasses, and 
brown rice syrup. These sweeteners are more healthful than the more refined 
options like high-fructose corn syrup and white sugar.
Multigrain and sprouted grain products are easier to find these days. Products 
labeled “multigrain” offer more nutrition and amino acids (read: complete 
protein!) from a variety of grains. Sprouted grain breads and cereals are 
made using soaked and sprouted grains that are mashed together and baked 
into a loaf. The sprouting activates the grain’s enzymes, which create more 
protein, vitamins, and minerals and often create a product with higher pro­
tein and fiber. The nutty, rich flavor of these products is wonderful.

Whole grains and whole-grain products bring balanced energy and fantastic 
nutrition to your everyday diet — and using them couldn’t be easier! Consider 
a variety of grains, such as the following, to ensure good options for taste and 
texture:
	
✓	Bulk whole grains like brown rice (short grain, long grain, jasmine, and 
basmati), millet, quinoa, amaranth, barley, spelt, oat groats, kamut, teff, 
and rye
	
✓	Whole-grain pastas in various shapes and flavors
	
✓	Whole-grain baking and pancake mixes
	
✓	Cornmeal polenta that’s premade, dry in a box, or in bulk
The skinny on whole foods
The most common reasons for choosing a 
vegan lifestyle are to improve your health and 
reduce your impact on the environment — and 
whole foods help you on both fronts. Eating 
whole foods ensures your body’s access to 
unadulterated nutrition that it can use while 
creating true vitality. Whole foods also require 
less energy to produce and package than highly 
processed foods. So consuming whole foods 
reduces your carbon footprint, the amount of 
pollution your actions and purchases contribute 
to the environment via plastic, fuel for transpor­
tation, and energy for production.
An apple with the skin on is a whole food. A 
peeled apple is not. Whole foods contain more 
nutrition and health benefits. For instance, an 
unpeeled apple contains more fiber and heart 
disease–preventing flavonoids. Similarly, 
brown rice is a whole grain and a whole food, 
while white rice is a processed or refined grain 
(it isn’t in its original state, and it isn’t a whole 
food). Brown rice still has its outer layers, the 
germ and bran, attached, which gives it more 
energy and nutrition. White rice has been pro­
cessed to remove the germ, bran, and natural 
fats. This removal extends the shelf life of the 
rice, but leaves it devoid of its original nutrition 
and energy.
Whole grains are unpolished, meaning the outer 
layers haven’t been polished away; the intact 
outer layers help maintain the foods’ health-
supportive fats. But these fats are more likely to 
oxidize and turn rancid, so proper storage is an 
important factor. Check out the later “Storing 
Your Goods to Ensure Freshness” section for 
more information on proper food storage.
Including a variety of whole foods is neces­
sary to ensure a healthy vegan diet. The best 
way to start cooking with whole foods is to 
take it easy on yourself: Master a few whole 
food recipes and techniques and repeat them 
until you get really comfortable. Simple menus 
with fresh, quality ingredients taste great and 
improve your health. Slowly transitioning your 
cooking style will ensure your success. After 
these recipes and techniques become second 
nature, you can expand your repertoire and get 
creative. Flip to Part IV for some recipes to get 
you started.

Luscious legumes
Filling, cheap, nutritious, and delicious — legumes have it all! Useful for 
meals of any ethnic bent, these versatile bundles of energy are easy to find, 
store, and prepare. This food group is a large plant family made up of beans, 
lentils, peanuts, and peas.
Beans are tiny powerhouses of protein, complex carbohydrates, fiber, cal­
cium, iron, potassium, and B-vitamins. When you get the inevitable ques­
tion, “Where do you get your protein and iron from?” your answer is simply: 
“Beans!”
Beans are good for you and easy to find. Even if your local supermarket only 
carries a few varieties of dry beans and lentils, you can stock up on countless 
varieties from any ethnic market. Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Hispanic, and 
even specialty European grocers often carry many kinds of beans whether 
they’re dried, canned, or frozen.
Common frozen varieties are soybeans (also referred to as edamame), green 
beans, and peas. Canned beans are convenient because they’re already 
cooked, and you can choose from countless types. The most common canned 
beans are chickpeas (also called garbanzo beans), kidney, black, adzuki, 
navy, and pinto. You also can find cans of soups and chili mixes contain­
ing black beans, kidney beans, pinto beans, lentils, and peas. The available 
choices for dried beans are too numerous to list here, and because they’re 
so cheap, you can feel confident when picking out a few types of beans with 
exotic-sounding names.
	
Beans and peas often lurk in premade products in the supermarket deli or 
freezer section. Lentil and pea soups made with vegetable stock may be found 
on the hot deli counter. Check out the packaged veggie burgers made with 
mashed beans, falafel, and hummus mixes made from chickpeas. You can find 
the hummus mixes freshly made in the deli or dried in packages. Dried bean 
flakes can be a time-saver as well. Simply add water to create a cheap, yummy, 
protein-packed side dish or burrito filling.

88
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
Combined with whole grains, vegetables, or mock meats, beans are a fabu­
lous savior to the harried, healthy home chef. Stock up on some of the follow­
ing products:
	
✓	Dried, bulk, fresh, canned, or frozen beans and peas
	
✓	Brown, green, red, black, white, or yellow lentils
	
✓	Several of these types of beans: lima, pinto, navy, mung, soy, great 
northern, cranberry, chickpeas, white cannellini, black-eyed peas, 
adzuki, anasazi, black, or kidney
	
Babies under 18 months shouldn’t eat beans because they can’t digest them 
properly. However, maturing digestive tracts can usually tolerate lightly pro­
cessed soy-based foods like tofu and soymilk, steamed green beans, and peas. 
Head to Chapter 21 for more on baby vegan diets.
Fruits and veggies
Buying and eating more produce is on everyone’s New Year’s resolution list, 
but it can be tough to decide which items you should buy fresh, frozen, or 
Digesting beans and legumes more easily
Some people have difficulty digesting beans 
and other legumes, and in turn develop gas, 
bloating, and other intestinal problems. If you 
have these issues, here are a few tips for alle­
viating them when cooking and eating legumes:
	✓	Chew beans thoroughly and eat smaller 
amounts.
	✓	Choose smaller beans, such as adzuki, len­
tils, mung beans, and peas, because they’re 
usually easier to digest. Larger beans like 
pinto, kidney, navy, black-eyed peas, soy­
beans, garbanzo, lima, and black beans 
are harder to digest and should be eaten in 
smaller amounts and less often. Luckily, soy 
products such as tofu, soymilk, tempeh, and 
miso are easier for most people to digest.
	✓	Season beans with vinegar, salt, miso, or 
soy sauce near the end of cooking. If these 
seasonings are added at the beginning, the 
salt interferes with the cooking process 
and the bean won’t cook completely. Plus, 
adding vinegar toward the end of cooking 
helps break down the indigestible sugars in 
beans, making them easier to digest.
	✓	Cooking with herbs and spices such as 
fennel, epazote, or cumin helps your body 
digest beans more easily.
	✓	Place 1 to 2 inches of kombu or kelp sea­
weed in your pot of beans to aid in diges­
tion, add nutrients, and soften the beans.
	✓	Soak your beans for eight hours in clean, 
cold water. Drain the soaking water and 
rinse the soaked beans to remove any 
released oligosaccharides, or sugars, 
released by the soaking process. Cook the 
soaked, drained beans in fresh water as 
directed.

89
 Chapter 7: Cooking and Shopping Like a Vegan
canned. All three are valid choices, but certain methods are better for certain 
types of produce. Use the general guidelines in this section when making 
your produce purchases.
Foods to buy fresh
Most fruits and vegetables taste better when purchased fresh rather than 
frozen or canned. I find that salad greens, especially leafy greens like kale, 
collard, and bok choy, should always be purchased fresh.
	
Don’t rely on the implied cleanliness and safety of produce that has been pre­
wrapped or precut. It isn’t as fresh as the real thing and may not have been 
washed properly. Even those convenient organic baby-sized carrots should be 
given a proper rinse before eating, because they may have been dipped in a 
bleaching agent to prevent discoloration.
Frozen for convenience
While fresh is generally considered the healthiest form of fruits and vegeta­
bles, you may not have access to quality items year-round. So you may need 
to purchase frozen veggies from time to time.
Flash-freezing technology has come a long way: Fresh produce is often frozen 
within a few hours of harvest these days. You can now find apples, beans, 
berries, broccoli, collards, corn, okra, peaches, peas, and even precut winter 
squash in the freezer aisle of the grocery store. Keeping several of these 
options on hand, along with the obvious veggie burgers and vegan ice cream, 
helps your freezer help you.
Canned goods . . . good?
You may ask: If fresh is best, why would I ever buy canned foods? The short 
answer is convenience. Canning used to be a home-based enterprise where 
people preserved their extra harvests in cans and jars for consumption 
during the long winter months. But now, because fewer people grow their 
own food, companies have perfected factory canning to bridge the gap.
	
Automated factory canning is now the norm, and the industrialization of can­
ning has brought with it a few important considerations:
	
✓	Canned food can be high in sodium, which is directly associated with 
high blood pressure and heart disease.
	
✓	The high-heat processing needed to ensure a safely canned product also 
destroys many of the nutrients found in fruits and vegetables.
	
✓	Fruit from cans and jars is often packed in sugary syrups, so it shouldn’t 
be counted as part of your daily recommended intake of fresh produce.

90
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
However, if you’re stuck buying canned veggies, don’t worry. It’s still better 
to eat canned veggies than no veggies at all. In fact, canned beans, vegeta­
bles, and soups can be used healthfully in a vegan diet. Just be sure to read 
the label and buy low-sodium cooked beans, vegetables, and vegan soups. 
And only buy canned fruits that are sugar free. To further reduce the sodium 
of canned beans, be sure to rinse before cooking.
My cupboard is always stocked with several kinds of canned beans, toma­
toes, and vegetable bean soups for vegan eating on the fly. The convenience 
of canned foods lies in the fact that you can stock up to ensure you always 
have access to healthy food choices at home.
	
If possible, skip the canned corn and peas; these vegetables are better-tasting 
and better for you when frozen.
Spices, seasonings, and handy condiments
Round out your pantry with the following flavoring basics, and you’ll never 
be at a loss for a fully satisfying, health-supportive meal:
	
✓	Sweeteners: Barley malt, maple syrup, agave syrup, and brown rice 
syrup
	
✓	Herbs and spices: Ground ginger, chili powder, curry powder, ground 
cumin, onion flakes, garlic powder, thyme, oregano, marjoram, rose­
mary, bay leaf, and cinnamon
Preserving the goods you find on sale
When your local farmer’s market is offering 
organic blueberries at $2 per pint, stock up! 
You can easily save those goldmines at home, 
along with many other fresh items. Simply pour 
the berries onto a large plate in batches and 
pick through to remove any leaves, stems, or 
moldy berries. Rinse the berries, pat dry, and 
freeze in plastic freezer bags or other freezer-
safe containers.
You can do the same with fresh tomatoes that 
you’ve cooked down (cool to room temperature 
before pouring into containers, of course), 
cleaned and chopped leafy greens, shucked 
corn kernels (or whole, fresh cobs), peas, and 
green beans. To freeze potatoes, peel them, 
cut them into chunks, and then blanch them for 
about 2 minutes in boiling water. After blanch­
ing, immerse the chunks in a bowl of ice water 
to stop the cooking. Drain and cool them and 
then freeze in freezer bags. Properly stored 
produce can keep for up to six months in the 
freezer.

✓	Baking ingredients: Vanilla extract; baking powder; baking soda; whole-
wheat pastry flour for baking cookies, cakes, muffins, and breads; corn­
meal; flaxseeds; and kuzu, a powdered starch made from the root plant 
that’s used as a thickener and that’s great for strengthening the diges­
tive tract
	
✓	Oils and vinegars: Balsamic, brown rice, red wine, and ume vinegars; 
canola oil; extra-virgin olive oil; and toasted sesame oil
	
✓	Sea vegetables: Nori paper, dulse flakes, hijiki, and kombu (kelp)
	
✓	Condiments: Fruit juice-sweetened ketchup; stone-ground or American-
style yellow mustards; ume paste, a pureed paste made from pickled 
plums; shoyu or tamari, naturally fermented soy sauces; sesame tahini 
paste; miso paste; mirin cooking wine; canned unsweetened coconut 
milk; olives; sea salt; fresh black peppercorns in a grinder; and vegetable 
stock, either in cubes or in aseptic boxes.
Storing Your Goods to Ensure Freshness
Proper storage of whole foods, seasonings, and herbs is important to ensure 
that they stay fresh as long as possible. After all, transforming and bulking up 
your kitchen with vegan products can be expensive — you don’t want to lose 
any ingredients to moisture, pests, damaging light, or heat. Instead of leaving 
open bags of food in your cupboard, which can invite pests and moisture-
causing mold, store packages in sealable bags or airtight containers. This 
section provides you with an overview of how to store your new vegan ingre­
dients appropriately.
How to store your food depends on the type of food it is. Consider the follow­
ing guidelines:
	
✓	Dry grains and legumes should be kept in a cool, dark, and dry place. 
Dried beans can keep for more than 20 years when stored properly! 
Keep beans and grains in well-sealed containers away from light and 
heat. A dark basement is an excellent storage place. Just be sure to keep 
all food containers at least a few inches off the ground to prevent mois­
ture and rodent problems.
	
✓	Shelled nuts and seeds keep for up to a year if stored in well-sealed con­
tainers in the freezer.
	
✓	Whole-grain products such as breads and crackers come without suspi­
cious preservatives and shelf-stabilizing additives (see the later section 
“Decoding food label lingo” for more information). However, that means 
they’re more likely to mold. Storing these products in the refrigerator or 
freezer helps them last longer.

92
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
	I especially like to keep my Ezekiel sprouted, whole-grain, and multigrain 
breads in the freezer. Then when I need a piece of toast or a “cheese” 
sandwich, I simply pop them in the toaster and they’re good to go.
	
✓	Most fresh fruits and vegetables fare best in the crisper drawer of your 
fridge. Exceptions are bananas, stone fruits like peaches, and tomatoes, 
which lose flavor in the fridge. Strawberries keep longer when refriger­
ated, but they taste better when allowed to warm up to room tempera­
ture before you eat them. To ripen avocados, leave them on the counter. 
But after you mash them into guacamole, press plastic wrap or a glass 
bowl onto the surface of the guac to prevent browning and refriger­
ate. Store apples in the fridge to keep them cold and make them taste 
sweeter.
	
✓	Potatoes, onions, ginger, and garlic are fickle, but when stored prop­
erly, they stay fresh for a long time. Store garlic heads in a cool, dark 
place to prevent sprouting. I keep mine in the silverware drawer. 
Potatoes and onions should be kept separate from each other in a cool, 
dark place to reduce contact spoiling, and don’t leave them in the plas­
tic bags they come in. Also, don’t eat potatoes that have “gone green” 
under the skin. Fresh ginger keeps best in the butter section of your 
fridge.
	
✓	Dry seasonings like herbs and spices typically keep for six months after 
opening, so buy them in small quantities. Store them in sealed contain­
ers in a dark cabinet or drawer away from the heat and moisture of the 
stove. You often can buy dry seasonings more cheaply, and in whatever 
quantity you like, in bulk from health food stores.
	
	Keep a permanent marker in your spice cabinet and write the date on 
the jar whenever you open a new spice.
	
✓	Fresh herbs should be stored in plastic storage bags or other sealable 
containers in a 40- to 45-degree crisper. Don’t wash them until you’re 
ready to use them, because moisture promotes spoilage. Several vari­
eties can be kept in separate bags or wrapped in dry, clean cloths or 
paper towels. When it’s time to use them, wash the herbs and dry them 
completely; they’re much easier to chop when dry.
Shopping Savvy
Shopping for your healthy vegan foods will be a little different from your 
old grocery routine. You have many sources to explore, and you’ll be sur­
prised at how many good options you have available to you. Even your old 
supermarket will offer great choices; you just need to find out how to read 
labels with a new set of eyes. So, in this section, I show you the best places 
to search out your vegan food, and I give you the lowdown on reading those 
food labels. (Chapter 11 deals with shopping for vegan nonfood items.)

Vegan-friendly places to shop for food
To find all the amazing, health-supportive vegan foods that you want to start 
including in your menus, you may need to broaden your shopping trips in 
variety and geography. But don’t worry: Even the corner deli can offer sur­
prising proteins and a diverse array of snacks to tide you over between trips 
to the health food store. With planning and practice, your vegan-oriented 
grocery shopping will become second nature and will bring you into contact 
with a more diverse population of food lovers. Check out the following places 
to start stocking your new vegan kitchen:
	
✓	Co-ops: These are cooperative operations that usually are run by mem­
bers or the people who shop there. Most co-ops are akin to health food 
stores, but they offer a substantial discount to members who work a few 
hours a month or pay a yearly membership fee.
	
✓	Delis and convenience stores: These places aren’t known for their vari­
ety of healthy food options, but even truck stops often carry raw nuts, 
seeds, and fruit. Some delis offer a fully stocked, meat-filled case of food 
that you wouldn’t touch in your current vegan life, but they also may 
provide bean and veggie salads, vegan soups, bread, fruits, nuts, and 
bottled water to get you to the next health food store.
	
✓	Ethnic markets: These markets may seem mysterious, with their foreign 
aromas and alphabets and exotic displays, but they hold wonderful 
ingredients and surprises for vegans. Most ethnic cuisines base a large 
proportion of their meals on grains, beans, and vegetables — just like 
vegans!
	
	Indian markets, for example, offer dahl or lentils, herbs and spices (often 
in bulk for less expensive prices), curry mixes, fresh produce, and whole 
grains. Chinese and Japanese markets offer huge varieties of leafy green 
veggies, ginger, spices, soy foods and tofu, teas, grains, and beans. 
Middle Eastern markets offer hummus, beans, stuffed grape leaves, and 
rice dishes.
	
✓	Farmer’s markets: These fresh markets can be found in every state, and 
the numbers are growing every year. Most of the markets offer a variety 
of fruits and vegetables, ethnic prepared dishes, vegan baked goods and 
condiments, and sometimes soy products.
	
	Farmer’s markets can be indoors or outdoors, and they offer a wonder­
ful opportunity to connect to your food on a deeper level. Talking to the 
farmer who grew your fresh, local produce, for example, can be a pro­
found experience that makes every bite taste a little better. Plus 100 per­
cent of your dollar goes directly to the small farmer rather than being 

94
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
divided between grocery brokers and manufacturers. Farmer’s markets 
also give you a better understanding of what’s growing seasonally in 
your area. Eating seasonal, local produce offers better nutrition and 
leads to less pollution because the food had a shorter distance to travel.
	
✓	Grocery stores: The average grocery stores today offer more and more 
vegan-friendly products as well as organic produce sections and bulk 
and ethnic aisles. My trips to see family in West Virginia have become 
easier to pack for over the years because the local grocery chain has 
expanded its health food section to include organic nut butters and 
frozen vegan burgers.
	
	Don’t be afraid to talk to your local grocery store manager to request 
that they start carrying certain items. If you bring a list of products and 
brands that you will buy, they may just start carrying them! You’ll have 
even more success if you encourage your vegan friends to do the same!
	
✓	Health food or natural food stores: These stores offer a safe haven for 
vegans. You’ll get to know staff members there who are familiar with the 
foods that are truly vegan, you’ll find loads of soy-based proteins, and 
you can even purchase organic, vegan versions of your favorite treats. 
Even health food stores that seem to carry 90 percent supplements and 
vitamins and 10 percent whole foods can offer good products when 
you’re in a pinch.
	
	Stores that have a lot of high-quality, fresh produce and high product 
turnover are best, especially when buying bulk. Many of these stores 
offer deli counters with premade vegan options as well as fresh juice and 
smoothie bars. These stores also are good places to connect with other 
vegan-minded locals, find a book on alternative health, buy cruelty-free 
health and beauty products, and even sit down for a cup of organic tea if 
the stores have cafes.
	
✓	Warehouse and membership stores: These stores can offer great deals 
on certain bulk purchases, such as grains, beans, herbs, spices, soy 
foods, and even organic produce.
	
	If you don’t already belong to one of these stores, find out whether any 
of them offer special sneak-previews for nonmembers. These sneak-
previews allow you to explore the aisles to look for items that you would 
buy, which in turn helps you to decide whether the membership is 
worth the price.
Decoding food label lingo
Discovering how to read the ingredients on a food label is as important as 
learning to balance your checkbook or drive a car — it’s a basic skill in this 
modern age. So, if you’re in the dark, here’s what you need to know: The first 

95
 Chapter 7: Cooking and Shopping Like a Vegan
ingredient on the label is the largest ingredient in the package, by volume, 
followed by the next largest, down to the smallest. If a bottle of pasta sauce 
lists tomatoes first, for instance, that bottle contains mostly tomatoes. If the 
second ingredient is high-fructose corn syrup, however, put the bottle back! 
Even though this sweetener is vegan, it’s difficult for your body to process 
and shouldn’t be considered part of a healthy diet.
You can determine the quality of a product by its ingredient list. In general, a 
healthier product has fewer ingredients on the label. Lean toward products 
that contain whole-grain flours or whole grains, recognizable ingredients, and 
natural sweeteners (see Chapter 6 for more on natural sweeteners). Don’t 
buy products that contain artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives, because 
they can be neurotoxic, lead to mood swings, and interfere with good health.
	
Labels can be difficult to read, especially when it comes to trans fats — the 
unhealthy, harmful-to-your-heart fats that can be included in many packaged, 
frozen, and fried foods. If you see hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils 
anywhere on the ingredient list, that means there are trans fats in the food. 
Manufacturers can state “0 grams trans fats” on the labels if the product con­
tains less than .50 grams of trans fats. Only labels that read “trans fat free” 
are truly devoid of this cholesterol-raising fat. Even though you can eat vegan 
sources of trans fats, I recommend staying away from these foods completely.
Don’t be shy about asking health food store employees if they know about a 
certain product. If you’re unsure of the source of a product’s ingredients and 
don’t get the answers you need from store employees, contact the manufac­
turer by calling the 800 number listed on the food. Or go to the brand Web 
site to find out more. Companies are happy to give you this information, 
especially if it leads to more sales because their products are appealing to 
other segments of the population.
	
Foods with the USDA Organic label on the front (see Figure 7-2) are made from 
at least 95 percent organic ingredients, and products with the Vegan label are 
100 percent certified vegan (see Chapter 11 to find out what this label looks 
like and for more about it). These labels are important for you as a vegan to 
recognize because one of the reasons you probably chose to become vegan 
was to live healthier and lighter on the earth. Even though you don’t have to 
eat organic foods to be vegan, eating organic foods is healthier and better for 
the planet and your body.

Eco-vegan shopping tips
Keeping your vegan head on straight may seem like a big enough challenge 
without worrying about the health of the planet — but isn’t that one of the 
reasons veganism sounded like a good idea in the first place? There are 
countless ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle your way to vegan heaven (like 
keeping those broccoli rubber bands for organizing long extension cords!). 
Here are some ideas to get you started:
	
✓	Buy food in bulk. Buying in bulk can mean one of two things: Either 
you buy the large packages and quantities of food at once or you buy 
unpackaged foods from large bulk bins that don’t require individual 
packaging and labeling. Each option is less expensive than buying one 
package at a time. Buying unpackaged bulk foods like loose beans, 
grains, flours, teas, coffees, herbs and spices, nut butters, and oils 
requires less packaging, and, therefore, less plastic and cardboard is 
used to deliver the goods.
	
	This method is ideal because it offers big discounts on those foods, and 
you can even reuse your old plastic bags and containers to refill with 
food again and again. If you choose to use clean glass jars to refill at the 
store, be sure to weigh them first so you can subtract the weight of the 
container from the total cost at check-out.
	
✓	Use cloth bags to carry your groceries home. They’re nicer looking, and 
they make eco-sense! You also can consider reusing the plastic shopping 
bags that you already have stuffed in the closet.
	
✓	Lather up with bar soaps (instead of liquid) when washing your hands 
and dishes and even when cleaning around the house. Bar soaps are 
cheaper, lighter, and require less fuel to transport. Many liquid soaps 
contain animal-derived ingredients, and all are packaged in unsustain­
able plastic bottles. To use bar soap when cleaning the dishes, your 
hands, or your house, simply shave or grate some soap into a spray 
bottle and fill with water, shake, spray, and clean!
	
✓	Buy your food in easier-to-recycle containers like cardboard or paper 
instead of plastic bags or tubs. Some vegan margarines come in card­
board boxes wrapped in paper and others come in plastic tubs. Try the 
paper one first. You also can buy great healthy pastas in boxes instead 
of plastic bags.
	
✓	Grow your own herbs, fruit, and veggies. Growing your own food is 
inexpensive, good for the environment, and better for you because you 
have access to fresh food that isn’t treated with herbicides and pesti­
cides. Setting up a little container garden of herbs in your window is 
easy and inexpensive, and it looks great with any décor.

Coexisting with the Meat Eaters 
in Your Home
In This Chapter
▶	Living happily with nonvegans
▶	Understanding the food and comfort needs of everyone in your household
▶	Teaching children valuable cooking and meal planning skills
A
t some point in your vegan life, you’ll most likely live with a nonvegan. 
You may find one on craigslist as a roommate, marry one, give birth to 
one, or marry into a family populated by meat and dairy lovers. All these car­
nivores will eye your tempeh and nutritional yeast flakes suspiciously at first. 
Considering vegans comprise less than 5 percent of the population, it’s no 
surprise that you need to get comfortable with mixed company.
Living with nonvegans presents interesting and unique challenges. Some 
households are able to find a middle road that works for everyone relatively 
easily and quickly. Others find it difficult to accommodate everyone’s culi­
nary and ethical desires in the same kitchen and dining room.
This chapter helps you figure out a way to work with most mixed living situ­
ations. Every home is comprised of unique individuals, so unless you’re all 
holding hands and happily skipping toward vegan utopia, you’ll encoun­
ter some bumps in the road. But not to worry. Every kitchen has room 
for upgrades that can facilitate a calm and civil co-cooking environment. 
Discovering how to offer a gracious dining experience for nonvegan guests is 
another topic of concern that I cover here.
Any children in the household can learn valuable lifelong habits about healthy 
eating and cooking when the topics of menu planning, shopping, ingredient 
selection, and cooking together are discussed openly and honestly.

Kitchen Etiquette for Mixed Households
Many vegan activists recommend that we be vegangelical with our loved 
ones and friends, taking every opportunity to point out why their flesh food 
is hurting their health, the planet, and the animals who unwillingly give it up. 
However, keep in mind that as you like to have your choices respected, so do 
they.
Some meat eaters are willing to avoid eating and cooking nonvegan foods 
around their vegan partners. Others are happy to eat vegan food at home 
while feeling relaxed enough to order anything outside the home. You just 
have to figure out what works best for you and those who live under the roof 
with you. In the illustrious words of Tim Gunn, you can find a way to “make it 
work.”
	
If you can’t tolerate living with someone who continues to eat meat or dairy, 
it’s best to look for people who share your view.
Who’s in a mixed household?
Mixed households can include all sorts of combinations of vegans and non­
vegans, including the following:
	
✓	Multigenerational splits (mom and dad are nonvegan and the two kids 
are vegan, or vice versa)
	
✓	Several lifetime vegans
	
✓	A 50-50 split of 2 meat eaters and 2 vegans
Cementing a relationship with the 4 C’s
Every relationship, including marriages, room­
mate partnerships, and child-parent relation­
ships, requires a bit of work and attention. 
However, relationships that involve a battle 
of diets require even more effective effort to 
achieve success. Remember the 4 C’s when 
building your household partnerships: clear, 
consistent, compassionate communication. You 
may come to an agreement about how to shop, 
cook, and eat together, but your cohabitants 
may evolve their diets or get frustrated with 
previously agreed-to boundaries. The vegan in 
the house must take it upon herself to generate 
positive, productive conversations about every­
one’s satisfaction with the meals and cooking 
routines. Don’t let bad moods fester; otherwise 
they result in blow-up fights, bigger problems, 
and a tense living environment. Remember that 
everyone needs to feel respected and valued. 
You can always find a way to compromise and 
find options that work for the group as a whole.

101
 Chapter 8: Coexisting with the Meat Eaters in Your Home
	
✓	A whole family that has agreed to venture into the vegan lifestyle together
	
✓	A lone vegan amongst a crowd of omnivores, which is the most common 
instance
	
Luckily, no matter what your situation, you can live by your principles for a 
peaceful, cruelty-free life and still share your kitchen with someone who eats 
meat and dairy products. It isn’t always easy, so you have to be strong. Every 
relationship is about giving and receiving, and sharing food is one of the most 
intimate things we do with the people we love and live with.
Staying sane in a mixed household
Long-time couples who have been happily living and eating together for years 
may suddenly have major problems when one person decides to change his 
diet for health, spiritual, or other reasons. When the other person gets angry 
about the changes or rules required for a vegan diet, it’s important to remind 
her that you still care about and respect her and her choices. Be honest and 
tell that person that your dietary changes don’t mean you’re going to judge 
her or love her any differently.
	
If your current cohabitant doesn’t fully embrace the vegan lifestyle and he only 
changes for you, it may result in unexpressed anger or discomfort in the house. 
If you live with someone who refuses to stop bringing meat or dairy into the 
house after you have asked him nicely and explained why you desire it, you can 
take the following steps to make the kitchen easier for everyone to use:
	
✓	Keep a separate set of cutting boards for nonvegan use. Color-coding is 
easiest, because no one will be able to claim confusion as to which board 
is used for cutting chicken. Use red cutting boards for meat and green 
cutting boards for vegan foods. Alternatively, you can keep wooden cut­
ting boards and write the words “vegan” or “veggie” on some and “meat,” 
“fish,” or “dairy” on others in the corner with permanent ink.
	
✓	Label vegan-only areas of the refrigerator so that meat isn’t placed 
next to the vegetables. This reduces the risk of crossover contamina­
tion from flesh-borne bacteria and illnesses.
	
✓	Reserve a special glass in your cupboard for the cow’s milk drinker if 
you dislike the idea of sipping your hemp milk from the same cup.
	
✓	Label chef’s knives for different purposes. You can use a similar pro­
cess that you do for the cutting boards. Or you can buy one good-quality 
chef’s knife just for the vegan and ask that it not be used to cut meat, 
poultry, fish, or dairy products.
	
✓	Consider buying mixed sets of Fiesta dishes with two colors. One color 
can be used for the vegans and the other color for the meat eaters. 
These colorful sets are nice because you can mix and match to go with 
whatever color scheme you have chosen for your kitchen or dining room.

102
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
✓	Work out rules for the stove and for the pots and pans. If sharing the 
stove top becomes too contentious, or if you don’t have the space to 
keep or the money to buy an extra set of pots and pans just for meat 
preparation, ask the meat eater to prepare his flesh foods outside on a 
meat-only grill. This compromise keeps the meat smell out of the kitchen 
and provides a safe haven for their cooking.
	
Use nonconfrontational humor to deflect minor issues at home. Rather than 
turning every slight refrigerator indiscretion into World War III, tell your 
friend, husband, wife, or child to “Mooooooove your cow’s milk over to the 
dairy side of the fridge, please!” or “EGGs-cuse me! There are eggs on top of 
my tofu salad.” Respect the fact that your humor and grace will lead to widen­
ing acceptance for your dietary choices — after all, no one wants to convert to 
a militant, humorless lifestyle.
Many families and roommates are able to “agree to disagree” and try to keep 
the dinner duels out of the house completely. The meat eater or cheese 
lover agrees to keep those foods out of the house and live vegan with their 
friend or loved one. When they eat outside the home, however, all bets are 
off and they can order whatever they want. This plan works pretty well for 
most people. The whole family can be vegan at home, and the omnivore can 
eat whatever he desires at work, school, or out for dinner. Just remember to 
keep the lines of communication open — the last thing loved ones need is to 
stress each other out about food.
	
To get some support and ask questions of other vegans who have gone down 
this mixed-household path before, join www.veggieboards.com, which is 
a huge online community that allows you to post questions and read experi­
ences from others.
Keeping Everyone Healthy and Happy
In a majority of households in the United States, the woman does the 
cooking . . . and the cleaning and the windows and the childcare, but that’s 
another book (Feminism in the 21st Century For Dummies, anyone?). If the 
goddess in your kitchen has gone vegan, and no one else has bought a ticket 
for that bus ride yet, it may be up to her to organize the menus, choose 
healthy ingredients, plan the cooking schedule, and ensure a wide variety 
of satisfying meals that keep everyone happy.

103
 Chapter 8: Coexisting with the Meat Eaters in Your Home
	
This amount of work can be too much for one person to handle, no matter 
how much of a superwoman (or superman) the vegan at home may be. For a 
family that contains more than one eating style, making sure that nutritious 
ingredients are used and available takes planning — and the whole crew must 
get in on the act. Using a weekly menu planner, like the one in Chapter 9 can 
help you make sure that no one goes hungry. The last thing you need on a 
Wednesday night is for the vegan in your house to be left with brown rice and 
old carrots while the rest of the family chows down on frozen chicken wings.
Variety for vegans and nonvegans alike
If meat is on the menu (and hopefully the omnivore will be cooking it out­
side away from the open kitchen window), provide many vegan side dishes. 
Offering a variety of side dishes ensures that the nonvegan gets enough fiber, 
minerals, and vitamins. If you’re making mixed steamed vegetables, quinoa 
pilaf, and baked tofu, make extra of each to share with the meat eater (and 
anyone else who would like to partake of them).
	
Here are some vegan side dish ideas that everyone can rejoice over (espe­
cially because they take less than 5 minutes to prepare):
	
✓	Artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, caper berries, and pickles
	
✓	Baked tortilla chips, vegan refried beans, salsa, and guacamole
	
✓	Brown rice tossed with a favorite salad dressing
	
✓	Carrot sticks, celery sticks, and red pepper spears with Tofu Sour Cream 
for dipping (see Chapter 13 for the recipe)
	
✓	Chickpeas tossed with olive oil, lemon juice, and sea salt and then sprin­
kled with fresh parsley
The vegan and the carnivore: 
Eating out on date night
For obvious reasons, when a mixed, vegan-
carnivore couple goes out to eat, they may have 
trouble choosing a menu that suits both peo­
ple’s desires. Consider making a pact to visit a 
dedicated vegan restaurant every other outing. 
Certainly the meat eater can find something he 
likes on a vegan menu, just as the vegan can 
find some combination of side dishes at a steak 
house.

104
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
✓	Cucumber and radish slices sprinkled with sea salt
	
✓	Fresh, whole-grain bread dipped in warm vegan spaghetti sauce
	
✓	Hummus, rice crackers, and olives
	
✓	Steamed broccoli and carrots drizzled with olive oil
Vegan meals everyone can love
Shopping for two separate meals for one family or group of people can get 
expensive. It’s usually much healthier for your bottom line to all go in on vegan 
ingredients together. If the nonvegans in your home will agree to it, you can 
all save money by eating vegan at home and focusing your food dollars on 
organic produce instead of the more expensive organically raised animal prod­
ucts. Choose the best quality ingredients no matter what your meals contain. 
Avoiding high-fructose corn syrup, genetically modified organisms, and antibi­
otic-laced dairy and meat products is the healthiest way to eat.
Plus, making several vegan meals for the whole family on a weekly basis can 
cut down on grumpy attitudes and extra cooking for the house chef. The 
vegans in the house will appreciate the effort, and it will introduce new foods 
to the rest of the family. If the normal chef isn’t vegan, perhaps the new her­
bivore can take responsibility for cooking these meals, giving the overworked 
kitchen slave a night off.
	
Use some of these ideas for your “vegan night” family meals that everyone can 
enjoy:
	
✓	Greek garden picnic: steamed whole-wheat pitas, hummus, kalamata 
olives, stuffed grape leaves, carrot sticks, sliced avocado, and tofu cubes 
marinated in olive oil, salt, pepper, and lemon juice (or try marinating 
Tofu Cheese cubes; find the recipe in Chapter 13)
	
✓	Italian night: spinach lasagna with shredded vegan mozzarella, whole-
wheat garlic bread, and green salad with oil and vinegar
	
✓	Mexican burrito bar: steamed whole-wheat tortillas, vegan refried beans, 
black beans, pinto beans, brown rice, tofu sour cream, shredded lettuce, 
diced tomato, sliced black olives, minced green onions, guacamole, and 
fresh salsa (or whip up the Seitan Burrito recipe in Chapter 14)
	
✓	Moroccan night: blended carrot soup, couscous, and cucumber salad 
with marinated tofu cubes
	
✓	Pizza party: premade frozen vegan pizza crusts (or homemade ones) 
topped with tomato sauce, vegan pepperoni or sautéed tempeh, sautéed 
mushrooms, and any other toppings your family likes

105
 Chapter 8: Coexisting with the Meat Eaters in Your Home
	
✓	Soup night: white bean minestrone made with vegetable stock, creamed 
broccoli soup, and hearty lentil stew alongside fresh, crusty bread (a 
great Sunday dinner — makes great leftovers for days!)
	
✓	Sushi night: white and brown rice, slivers of carrots, avocado slices, 
and baked and marinated tofu or tempeh for a make-your-own sushi bar, 
which you can serve alongside dishes of pickled ginger and wasabi paste
Supporting the family vegan 
nutritionally and emotionally
No one is perfect, even an ethical vegan striving for food nirvana. In fact, 
some of us vegans are still called by the siren song of the cheese counter or 
dairy cooler. If you’re having a difficult time quitting eggs, turkey, or cheese, 
you’ll be relying on your willpower a lot, even if your logical brain constantly 
reminds you of all the reasons why you should be vegan. Do your best, do 
what you can, and resolve to feel good about what you are doing. And most 
important, seek out support from the family and friends you’re living with.
	
When one family member is vegan, and the rest aren’t, work together to 
ensure that the “odd man out” gets proper nutrition and emotional support. 
Even though parents or kids may decide to continue eating dairy or meat, they 
can still take care of the vegan’s needs.
Here are some ways to support the vegan nutritionally:
	
✓	Let your newly vegan teenager have some say over what foods he will 
eat. He may even want to prepare his own meals when the rest of the 
family is dining on eggs, meat, or fish.
	
✓	If you feel that the vegan’s food choices aren’t nutritionally sound, speak 
up and offer alternative ingredients to help bolster the quality of the 
meal.
	
✓	Ensure that the kitchen is always stocked with healthy vegan snacks, 
such as a bowl of fresh fruit on the counter, dishes of nuts, seeds, and 
dried fruit in the pantry, and chopped veggies in the refrigerator.
	
✓	Stock up on quality vegan dinner options like vegan burger patties, 
frozen edamame, whole-grain pasta, and vegan canned soups. This way 
the vegan always has a standby option for a wholesome supper.
As you support your vegan loved one nutritionally, be sure to support him 
emotionally as well. Vegans don’t make the choice to change their diets and 
lifestyles lightly. They have often researched a lot of information, and they’re 

106
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
usually inspired by their knowledge to make positive changes in their lives. 
Supporting a new vegan in their efforts is important for nonvegans who love 
them. And to the vegan that support means the difference between success 
and struggle or even failure.
	
Rather than taunting, teasing, or even sabotaging your vegan family member, 
ask what you can do to help him. Perhaps visiting a health food store once a 
week for special ingredients would be useful. You also may be able to help by 
looking up new vegan recipes and offering to help cook with him. If you see 
that your loved one is having a difficult time eliminating meat or dairy, be a 
cheerleader and tell him that you respect his decision to go vegan even if he 
can’t do it 100 percent at first. These words and deeds will give your loved one 
the strength he needs to be healthy and happy.
Getting Your Kids Involved in Making 
Healthy Meals (Vegan or Otherwise)
Just because both parents are committed to providing a vegan diet at 
home doesn’t mean the kids will be on board for changing the family feasts. 
Because there are several stubborn stages of childhood, kids of any age may 
refuse to board the broccoli bandwagon. If your child or teen goes against 
the family grain and doesn’t want to go vegan with everyone else, offering 
him healthy vegan side dishes alongside an agreed upon nonvegan portion 
can help integrate the teen into meal times.
It’s always a good idea to use a transition period (rather than going cold 
Tofurky) when the whole family isn’t 100 percent behind the idea of changing 
the household diet. If every person has a say and an opportunity to take own­
ership of the process, it’s more likely that the plan will be successful.
	
I recommend having a family powwow, where everyone sits down together 
and chats about the changes family members may soon see. The parents pres­
ent the information behind their choices and the reasons for the upcoming 
dietary changes. The kids can ask questions, talk about their concerns, and 
have a chance to present their arguments as well. Each person can talk about 
their concerns and everyone can present ideas on how to eliminate those con­
cerns. Once the meeting is over, agree that family members can stick to their 
diets at the end of this meeting. Children may decide to continue eating meat 
or dairy, but the quantity and quality can be improved and changes agreed to. 
Each family will find their own way; just be respectful of every person’s feel­
ings and health concerns.

107
 Chapter 8: Coexisting with the Meat Eaters in Your Home
In order to create some excitement for the next phase of your family’s dietary 
shift, try some of these methods for getting your kids involved in the process:
	
✓	Give each person a cookbook budget. Every member in the house can 
spend a set amount of money on new vegan-friendly cookbooks to bring 
new ideas into the kitchen. Don’t edit their choices, however. If your 
young one wants to buy Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, so be it! 
The recipes will come in handy when trying to soothe a cranky sweet 
tooth, and they’ll inspire culinary curiosity.
	
✓	Hold a vegan milk taste test. Buy one box each of plain soymilk, vanilla 
soymilk, plain rice milk, vanilla rice milk, plain hemp milk, and vanilla 
hemp milk. You also can get a box each of the chocolate versions of 
soy, rice, and hemp milk. Give everyone a scorecard and use a scoring 
system of 0–10 to grade each milk. This taste test can help the family 
decide which milks they like to drink plain, use over cereal, and add to 
their tea or coffee. Bonus round: Make your own nut milks like almond 
and cashew and hold a separate competition for those.
	
✓	Let each person plan at least one meal a week and bulk it up 
with healthy, vegan ingredients. Say that your oldest son chooses 
Thursday’s dinner and wants a spaghetti dish with garlic bread. Talk to 
him about using whole-grain pasta and adding olives, crumbled tempeh, 
mushrooms, or other favorite vegan ingredients to the sauce. The garlic 
bread can be whole grain as well. Plan ahead to use the best quality 
ingredients as well as healthy side dishes like steamed broccoli, green 
salads, and baked sweet potato fries.
	
✓	Involve your children in the cooking process as often as possible. Kids 
as young as 2 years old can help out in the kitchen with pouring premea­
sured ingredients, mixing, or just playing with cooking spoons. Older 
kids can measure, chop, mix, and pour with a responsible sibling or a 
parent. And because most kids like projects that involve getting ready 
(assembling the ingredients, preheating the oven), making messy fun, 
transforming ingredients, and seeing the finished results of their labors 
on the dinner table, it pays to dedicate a little time every day to their 
culinary education. If you do, they’ll be more likely to eat the healthy 
ingredients you desire. To help instill the important life skills of basic 
human meal preparation, invite (or require) their help a few times a 
week or even nightly. Stock up on kid-friendly cooking tools like smaller 
aprons, animal-themed spatulas and measuring spoons, and brightly col­
ored, shatter-resistant mixing bowls.
	
	To help smaller vegans get involved in the kitchen, consider purchasing 
a Learning Tower. This adjustable step stool with safety railings ensures 
that your little one can help mix, stir, and pour at the counter without 
falling. Visit www.learningtower.info for more information.

108
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
Planning, shopping for, and preparing healthy meals are invaluable life skills. 
All children, whether they’re vegan or not, should be coached on the following 
abilities before they leave home:
	
✓	Planning a menu, writing a shopping list, formulating a food budget, and 
shopping for good-quality ingredients
	
✓	Washing produce, mixing ingredients, using a timer, sifting, baking, sau­
téing, and roasting
	
✓	Using knives and stoves safely
	
✓	Using appliances properly (All children will reach the age when they can 
use blenders, ovens, food processors, and toasters without adult super­
vision, but until that age, make sure they only use them with an adult.)
	
✓	Practicing proper hygiene in the kitchen, including washing hands thor­
oughly and regularly, cleaning up as they go, and properly handling and 
storing food

L
iving vegan means becoming a skilled food detective. Navigating the gro­
cery store can be like picking your way through a field of land mines — 
but only in the first couple of weeks. You’ll quickly pick up on the ingredients 
to avoid and discover new favorite products to fill up your cupboard.
This chapter can help you plan a healthy week of meals to get you started in 
la vida vegan. Shopping from lists of staple supplies, planning well-rounded 
meals, and stocking up on snacks all ensure that your best vegan intentions 
are successful. So grab your magnifying glass, your shopping list, a quick 
swig of hemp milk from your hip flask, and then head out the door to your 
local health food store. And don’t forget to bring your reusable shopping 
bags for extra eco-vegan street-cred.
Building a Plan for Vegan-rific Success
Looking at lists of possible vegan staples can help you understand what’s 
necessary to round out your kitchen supply. After all, creating your own lists 
and planning out meals is your key to success and really owning this process. 
As many coaches have said, “If you fail to plan, you’re planning to fail.”
	
As you begin planning, first think about what types of foods you want to eat on a 
regular basis and begin amassing recipes that you can go to time and again. 
Then use the lists provided later in this section to plan your own shopping trips.

110
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
As you’re making the transition to a vegan lifestyle, you can start with a clean 
slate and dump every nonvegan item in your cupboard (giving the items away 
to someone who will use them, of course). Or, to make the switch a little more 
sane, you can begin by planning to eat one or two vegan meals each day. 
Doing so allows you to keep some of your old food habits while transforming 
your shopping, cooking, and eating habits slowly.
Gathering easy and appealing 
recipes for meal planning
Begin your vegan adventure by looking through recipes and choosing several 
that fit your taste preferences and cooking abilities. Selecting simple foods 
and recipes that don’t require too many sophisticated cooking tools or tech­
niques can help you transition in the beginning. Also, starting your cooking 
projects on the weekend will allow you more time and flexibility. Running to 
the store for a missing ingredient will be less stressful on a Saturday after­
noon compared to a Tuesday night.
	
Include complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fat sources throughout 
your day. And don’t rely too heavily on processed “fake” vegan foods like soy 
hot dogs and deli meats. These foods are fine every once in a while, but you 
can easily fall into the habit of using them every day instead of cooking with 
fresh food. These soy foods aren’t inherently unhealthy, but they aren’t whole, 
vital foods like vegetables and whole grains either.
Make sure you have a healthy breakfast every day so you don’t get stuck 
starving out in the wilds of your office or in the car on the way to school. 
Keep a variety of snack options stocked at home so you can take a couple 
with you to help you through the day.
Here are some smart and simple menu planning tips to help you succeed:
	
✓	Provide variety and choice. Start with foods you know that you and/or 
your family enjoy and offer several healthy options that they can pick 
and choose from.
	
✓	Offer a variety of textures, tastes, and temperatures. A variety of tex­
tures, tastes, and temperatures, including smooth, creamy, crunchy, 
chewy, cold, spicy, hot, sweet, salty, bitter, and sour, can make meal­
times more interesting.
	
✓	Appeal to the senses with colors, smells, and presentation. Food 
should be visually appealing and fragrant as well as tasty. Choose foods 
of different colors and arrange them with some care and attention to 
make the dish look nice and appetizing. Include herbs, spices, garlic, and 
onions to fill the air with delicious smells to stimulate your appetite.

111
 Chapter 9: Planning Your Meals to Stay on Track
Shopping smarter with 
vegan shopping lists
If you become a wiser shopper, you’ll find it much easier to stick to your 
vegan lifestyle. Shop smarter by doing the following:
	
✓	Take a list and hit the right stores at the right times. To avoid long lines 
and crowded aisles, try shopping during off-peak hours like weekend 
evenings or early in the morning.
	
✓	Don’t shop when you’re starving — you’re more likely to fill your cart 
with junk food. Eat a small, healthy snack before you leave the house.
	
✓	Choose a grocery store that offers you most, if not all, of the items on 
your list. Store hopping to find everything you need will only become a 
chore and cause you to resent your new diet.
	
✓	Get to know a few stores to help you find better priced items, and you’ll 
learn the lay of the land, making for a faster shopping experience.
Get ready, get set, shop! The following sections provide you with lists of 
basic vegan foods that you can begin accumulating to ensure healthy, deli­
cious vegan cooking. You certainly don’t need to buy these items all at once 
(you likely already have some of them); start with what you think you’ll use 
most often or with what’s on sale and work from there.
Staples and dry goods
You’ll be able to whip up any number of yummy vegan meals and treats with 
these items:
	
✓	Baking ingredients: baking powder, baking soda, dry active yeast
	
✓	Dried beans: black beans, chickpeas, kidney beans, lentils, pintos, white 
beans
	
✓	Dried mushrooms: morels, porcini, shiitake
	
✓	Egg replacements: Ener-G Egg Replacer, ground flax meal, whole flax­
seeds
	
✓	Flavorings: carob or cocoa powder, kosher salt, sea salt, vanilla extract, 
vegetable broth cubes, wasabi powder
	
✓	Flours: buckwheat flour, cornmeal, oat flour, spelt, unbleached white 
flour, whole-wheat flour
	
✓	Herbs and spices: allspice, basil, bay leaves, chili powder, cinnamon, 
cloves, cumin, curry powder, five spice powder, garlic powder, ground 
ginger, ground mustard, marjoram, onion flakes, oregano, paprika, red 
pepper flakes, rosemary, sage, thyme, turmeric, whole black pepper­
corns, whole nutmeg

112
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
	As a general rule when cooking with herbs, 1 teaspoon of dried herb may 
be substituted for 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh herb. Store your herbs 
and spices away from heat and light sources. Similarly, don’t store them 
over the oven or in the window because heat and light cause them to lose 
their flavor faster. Replace herbs and spices that are older than 1 year.
	
✓	Milks: boxes of almond, carob, hemp, oat, plain chocolate or vanilla, 
rice, or soymilks
	
✓	Natural sweeteners: agave, blackstrap molasses, brown rice syrup, 
maple syrup, rapadura
	
✓	Nuts and seeds: almonds, cashews, pecans, popcorn kernels, pumpkin 
seeds, sesame seeds, shelled sunflower seeds, walnuts
	
✓	Pasta and noodles (whole-grain flour): buckwheat soba noodles, cous­
cous, elbow noodles, spaghetti, lasagna noodles, rice
	
✓	Sea vegetables: arama, dulse, hijiki, kombu, nori paper, wakame
	
✓	Organic soy products: silken tofu in aseptic packages, frozen edamame beans
	
✓	Teas: black, green, herbal
	
✓	Thickeners: agar, arrowroot, cornstarch, kudzu
	
✓	Unsweetened dried fruit: banana chips, dried apples, Medjool dates, raisins
	
✓	Whole grains: barley, brown rice, bulgur, corn grits, millet, oat groats, quinoa

Starting Your Meal Planning with the 
Best Breakfast for You
Your doctor and your mom were both right: Breakfast is the most important 
meal of the day. Many of my clients have seen dramatic decreases in sugar 
and caffeine cravings when they finally commit to daily breakfast plans. If you 
have a cup of coffee and chocolate for breakfast, you’ll most likely fall head­
long into a sugar crash by late morning. This type of eating — loading up on 
caffeine and sugar in the early morning hours — is all too common. Cravings 
for more sugar and caffeine are more likely in the afternoon if you rely on 
them in the morning.

115
 Chapter 9: Planning Your Meals to Stay on Track
	
Breakfast is the most important part of your meal planning because preparing 
a healthy breakfast that includes the most supportive foods for you and your 
body type ensures that your energy is more stable throughout the day. If your 
energy is stable and your nutrition needs are met, you’ll be less likely to go off 
track with junk food or other less-than-desirable choices.
Try this unique, half-week breakfast test to find out which foods set you up 
for a day of solid energy, and which foods lead to energy crashes or sugar 
cravings later in the day. Eat as much of each food as you want, but choose 
only one food each day. Here are your options:
Saturday: steel cut oats, brown rice, or quinoa (no sweetener)
Sunday: orange juice, green tea, black tea or coffee (added sweetener is okay)
Monday: steamed vegetables
Tuesday: nuts and seeds, vegan cheese, or steamed tofu
Wednesday: quick oats, toast, or bagel (no sweetener, soy margarine, or 
nut butter)
Immediately after you eat each of the foods, note how you feel. Do you 
feel full? Bloated? Content? Then note how you feel a few hours later. Were 
you hungry for more food within an hour or so? Did you eat a smaller lunch 
or a bigger one? Were your food cravings throughout the day worse or 
diminished?
After you try this evaluation of different foods, you’ll have a better idea how 
your food choices affect your energy. This knowledge helps you plan your 
menus better. If you have a presentation at work or school, for instance, 
you can choose the breakfast you know works better to create the steady, 
focused energy you need.
Exploring Some Menu Ideas 
to Get You Started
Leafing through cookbooks can be intimidating for some new vegans. You may feel 
that you need to whip up complicated, multicourse menus right out of the gate.
No need to fret — start your first couple of weeks by using the menu ideas I 
list in the following sections. These options offer you simple cooking ideas 
that pair up all the foods your body needs. Protein, complex carbs, and 
healthy fats should appear regularly throughout your day.

Seven days of dinner
Dinnertime is a hectic affair in many households. With evening activities, 
household chores, traffic jams, and homework filling up our nights, fixing a 
healthy meal can seem overwhelming.
Use the following wholesome vegan dinner plans to get a new, positive 
rhythm into your evening agenda. These dishes can all be scaled up or down 
depending on the size of your appetite:
	
✓	Very vegan dinner 1: 1 to 2 cups quinoa cooked in vegetable broth 
served with 1 to 2 cups steamed broccoli drizzled with olive or flaxseed 
oil and sprinkled with slivered almonds or sesame seeds
	
✓	Very vegan dinner 2: A bed of lettuce covered with 1 to 2 cups brown 
rice, 1 to 2 cups cooked pinto beans, a scoop of salsa, tofu sour cream 
and sliced avocado
	
✓	Very vegan dinner 3: Veggie burger on whole-grain bread served with a 
pickle, baked sweet potato fries, and quick sautéed bok choy
	
✓	Very vegan dinner 4: Hummus, baba ghanouj, rye crackers, kalamata 
olives, avocado slices, carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and 1 to 2 cups 
bulgur wheat tabbouleh
	
✓	Very vegan dinner 5: Hot vegetarian baked beans on top of steamed 
broccoli and baked Yukon Gold potatoes
	
✓	Very vegan dinner 6: Bean soup with steamed corn served alongside a 
green salad with olive oil and lemon juice
	
✓	Very vegan dinner 7: Roasted root vegetables (cubed beets, sweet pota­
toes, onions, and carrots) with curried red lentils simmered in coconut 
milk served over jasmine rice
	
Cook a double portion of any of these menu items at dinner and have leftovers 
for an easy, cheap lunch the next day.
Using menu charts
	
Planning a week of menus can really take the guesswork and stress out 
of shopping trips. If you already know what you’re having for dinner on 
Thursday, you don’t need to worry about running by the crowded grocery 
store on the way home from work. And you won’t be tempted to order takeout 
or veggie pizza again either. Use the menu chart in Figure 9-1 to help guide 
your shopping trips.

 Chapter 9: Planning Your Meals to Stay on Track
Making Sure You Have Healthy 
Snacks On Hand
Between tweeting your every move and posting your new vegan recipe 
demonstrations on YouTube, a busy vegan doesn’t always have time for a 
sit-down meal. Don’t worry new vegans — healthy snacking isn’t difficult 
and options abound! You probably won’t find many vending machines with 
healthy vegan choices, but you can find vegan snacks in almost every grocery 
store, deli, or convenience store.
Plan for your day by thinking ahead — will you be near a health food store in 
between meals? Do you have access to a refrigerator at school or work where 
you can store perishable snacks? Many nonperishable snacks are easy to just 
slip into your purse, backpack, messenger bag, or briefcase.
	
Staving off hunger with a well-timed nibble can prevent overeating at meal­
times. In fact, some people do better with several small meals a day rather 
than three squares. Any of the healthy snacks listed in the following sections 
can be expanded to create a substantial picnic plate of variety.
	
If you need to eat your snack on the run or won’t have access to water for 
washing up, choose simple, cleaner foods. Bananas, mixed nuts, or an indi­
vidual box of soymilk are easy to consume quickly without fuss or muss. On 
the other hand, if you can sit down on a “coffee break” in your staff room, you 
may be able to snack on something slightly more elegant like a soy yogurt with 
berries, or some carrot sticks with a small container of hummus.
Use the lists in the following sections to choose a variety of healthy snacks 
that will satisfy any kind of food craving you may have.
Sweet treats
To satisfy your sweet tooth, try the following:
	
✓	Carrot sticks
	
✓	Coconut date rolls
	
✓	Dried fruit like banana chips, mango slices, or apple slices
	
✓	Edy’s Fruit Bars or Edy’s No-Sugar Bars
	
✓	Frozen grapes
	
✓	Fruit salad
	
✓	Homemade apple juice popsicles
	
✓	Homemade oatmeal cookies with a glass of hemp, soy, or rice milk

120
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
✓	Lärabars
	
✓	Leftover cornbread muffin spread with apple butter
	
✓	Mixed melon cubes
	
✓	Raisins and sliced almonds
	
✓	Soy yogurt mixed with 100 percent fruit jam or jelly
	
✓	Soy yogurt with blueberries and crushed pineapple
	
✓	Stretch Island Fruit Company Original Fruit Leather
	
✓	Trail mix made of vegan chocolate chips, raisins, and raw almonds
	
✓	Whole-grain bagel spread with almond butter and jelly
	
✓	Whole-grain tortillas spread with vegan margarine and sprinkled with 
cinnamon and agave or brown rice syrup
	
Heretofore nonvegan treats like marshmallows were a luxury of the past. No 
longer! The good ladies from Sweet and Sara have now concocted several 
lovely flavors of marshmallows that hold up to roasting over a fire and mixing 
into veganized Rice Krispies Treats recipes. Find their mallow goodness online 
at www.sweetandsara.com. For other professional-quality sweet treats like 
truffles, brownies, cookies, and fudge, check out Allison’s Gourmet online at 
www.alisonsgourmet.com. You also can flip to Chapter 15 to experiment 
with some tasty vegan dessert recipes, such as Fruit Kanten and Chocolate 
Peanut Butter Bombs.
Salty and savory snacks
When sweet just won’t do, try these snacks instead:
	
✓	Dried, seasoned peas
	
✓	Grape leaves stuffed with spiced rice (also known as dolmas)
	
✓	Pickles and olives
	
✓	Rice Balls with Sesame Salt (see Chapter 13)
	
✓	Roasted, salted nuts
	
✓	Tamari-baked pumpkin seeds

121
 Chapter 9: Planning Your Meals to Stay on Track
Crunchy morsels
For whatever reason, a bit of something crunchy can really hit the spot. Here 
are some ideas to try:
	
✓	Air-popped popcorn drizzled with olive oil, salt, and nutritional yeast
	
✓	Blue, white, yellow, or red corn tortilla chips dipped in fresh salsa or 
bean dip

✓	Original Triscuit Crackers
	
✓	Original Wheat Thins Crackers
	
✓	Raw sunflower and pumpkin seeds
	
✓	Rye crackers
	
✓	Sesame Melba Toast
	
✓	Soy crisps

Comfort Foods: Veganizing Meat, 
Dairy, and Other Old Favorites
In This Chapter
▶	Creating vegan-friendly meals based on old favorite recipes
▶	Getting the scoop on vegan substitutions for meat, dairy, and eggs
F
ood is often an important part of family history. Certain dishes make an 
appearance at holiday tables year after year, and they often have a story 
or fond memory stirred in with the ingredients. Veganizing, or re-creating a 
recipe with vegan ingredients, can be a nice way to keep an old family recipe 
in the fold of your new vegan lifestyle. Your tweaks will add a layer of family 
lore to Grandma’s apple pie so that the original stories attached to it can con­
tinue to be shared at the table.
In this chapter, you find new ways to use vegan ingredients for creating 
menus that remind you of your old favorites. If you’re a baker looking to 
transform some old recipes, you’ll enjoy the tips for cooking without eggs, 
dairy, or butter. Later tips can help you thicken, gel, and bulk up recipes with 
cruelty-free ingredients for delicious vegan meals.
Taking Comfort in Your Vegan Food: 
Why Veganizing Is Helpful and Fun
Stepping into a new style of eating can feel uncomfortable at first. Your 
normal daily routines get shaken up. Going to the grocery store involves 
more planning than ever before. Favorite meals that you relied on contain 
ingredients that you want to avoid — but they were delicious and you miss 
them. Thankfully, you can veganize recipes so they don’t include dairy, meat, 
fish, or eggs but still taste and look a lot like the dishes Mom or Dad used to 
make.

124
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
Researching recipes and browsing through vegan cookbooks to find veg­
anized recipes can help you get your footing. Vegan with a Vengeance by 
Isa Chandra Moskowitz (Da Capo Press), Cooking the Whole Foods Way by 
Christina Pirello (HP Trade), and The Garden of Vegan by Tanya Barnard and 
Sarah Kramer (Arsenal Pulp Press) are excellent resources for tested vegan 
recipes. If you’re trying to change a chicken potpie recipe, for example, look 
for existing vegan potpie recipes and compare them. Eventually you’ll start 
trusting your instincts when deciding which substitutions work well in your 
recipes. Cooking regularly helps you understand what textures and flavors 
you’re looking for and how to create them.
	
When converting any recipe with new ingredients, it’s important to give your­
self at least a couple test runs to try out your new ideas. In other words, don’t 
plan on taking the very first batch to a potluck or family gathering. The results 
may need more refining.
Here’s a basic checklist you can use to begin veganizing recipes:
	
✓	Look through your recipes and choose a favorite that you know how 
to cook already. Familiarity with a recipe gives you a mental image of 
what to aim for. If you know what the finished product is supposed to 
look and taste like, you’ll find it easier to adjust your recipe as you work 
your way through it.
	
✓	Circle all the ingredients that aren’t vegan: dairy, eggs, gelatin, meat, 
fish, and so on. Start substituting the ingredients with the appropriate 
amount of your chosen vegan substitute, as detailed throughout this 
chapter. Not every vegan ingredient is substituted one for one.
	
✓	Try to use the same techniques, steps, times, and temperatures that 
are used in the original recipe. Doing so gives you a good platform from 
which to make future changes.
	
✓	Take notes as you cook. You’re basically writing your own new recipe, 
so you want to be sure and have a detailed record of how you did it 
for the future. Write down how much of each ingredient you used, and 
whether you did anything different than the description in the original 
recipe.
	
Some traditional egg or dairy recipes have a yellow coloring or certain savory 
flavor to them. To re-create that color use a pinch of turmeric or a little pre­
pared mustard. For the missing flavor, try adding a little nutritional yeast or 
instant vegan broth powder.

125
 Chapter 10: Comfort Foods: Veganizing Meat, Dairy, and Other Old Favorites
Taking Advantage of Mock Meats
Some vegans miss the mouth feel of animal protein. It’s human to enjoy a 
variety of textures, so including chewy, dense foods is a good way to ensure 
that your diet stays interesting. Luckily, protein alternatives offer an incred­
ible array of textures and tastes on which to build new recipes. These fake 
meats can be like a blank canvas; most have naturally mild tastes, so you can 
create almost any flavor profile you want with herbs, spices, and seasoning.
Hundreds of vegan foods that mimic the animal foods you may be missing are 
available. Consider these wonderful alternatives:
	
✓	Vegan jerky made from soy, wheat gluten, and mushroom bases
	
✓	“Sausages” in many different varieties, including Italian, spicy Mexican 
chipotle, and apple sage
	
✓	Deli “meat” slices that come in turkey, bologna, and ham flavors
	
✓	Premade roast loaves for Thanksgiving
	
✓	Meatballs and great pizza toppings like vegan pepperoni and Canadian 
bacon
	
✓	Animal-free hot dogs and burger patties, which may be made with a soy­
bean base or with nuts, vegetables, grains, and beans
Other vegans don’t want anything with a fleshy texture in their mouths — 
hence, part of the reason they became vegan! Still, if you’re in this camp, 
you’ll find it easy to turn vegetables into the hearty portion of your meal. 
Here are some ideas:
	
✓	Try cutting vegetables like carrots, zucchini, and celery into larger 
chunks in your next stew. Doing so gives you those big bites of veggie 
flavor to crunch through.
	
✓	Mushrooms offer a wonderful savory taste and texture that can lend a 
new layer of flavor to stir-fry, sandwiches, pasta sauces, or soups.
	
✓	If you want a brunch recipe for vegan sausages, but the fake-meat ver­
sions taste a little too much like pork for your comfort, you can choose 
from many excellent recipes to make your own sausage “links” or “pat­
ties” out of beans, grains, and vegetables.

126
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
Soybeans as protein
The incredible soybean isn’t much to look at in its natural state. It looks like 
any other bean. Yet this incredible vegetable has become the base for count­
less meatless meals. Two vegan power foods, tofu and tempeh, are derived 
from the soybean and can play a part in your daily menu planning. I give you 
the lowdown on these power players in the following sections.
Tofu
Tofu, sometimes called bean curd on Chinese restaurant menus, is basically 
soy cheese. A coagulant, such as naturally occurring calcium sulfate, gypsum, 
or magnesium chloride, is added to soymilk to curdle the liquid. The curds 
are separated and formed into cakes of tofu and then packaged. Some tofu is 
packaged in aseptic, vacuum-packed containers that are stocked in the Asian 
or health food aisle. Other types are refrigerated in water.
Tofu comes in several textures, which can be used for different types of 
dishes. Silken and soft tofu can be used to make mousse-like creations, des­
serts, and scrambles. Firm and extra-firm tofu are often used for more savory 
dishes, because they can be shredded or cut into chunks, cubes, or strips.
	
Firm and extra-firm tofu also are strong enough to be made into more meaty 
textures through freezing or pressing. Freezing and then thawing an unopened 
package of firm or extra-firm tofu gives it a spongy, meaty texture. You can 
then marinate and grill, broil, fry, or sauté it with ease. Freezing tofu removes 
excess moisture once it thaws and makes the texture spongier than pressed 
tofu. Freezing also keeps tofu fresh longer, so you won’t have to worry about 
the expiration date. Just take it out of the freezer to thaw in the refrigerator at 
least 8 hours before you want to cook with it.
Pressing is a technique for pushing the excess water out of firm or extra-firm 
tofu. Pressed tofu absorbs more marinade flavor and won’t release as much 
moisture into your recipe. To press your tofu, follow these simple steps and 
refer to Figure 10-1:
	
1.	Layer one or two clean kitchen towels on a cutting board near the 
kitchen sink. Set one edge of the cutting board on another folded 
towel to create a slight incline.
	
	 The incline allows excess moisture to drain away from the tofu.
	
2.	Place the block of firm or extra-firm tofu on the towels, and then lay 
another clean towel on top of the tofu.
	
3.	Carefully place a plate or small cutting board on top of the tofu.
	
4.	Balance a small weight, like a can of beans or tomatoes, on top of the 
plate.

127
 Chapter 10: Comfort Foods: Veganizing Meat, Dairy, and Other Old Favorites
	
	 Let the tofu sit for at least 15 minutes. To remove even more water, 
change the towels around the tofu and allow the tofu to sit for another 
10 minutes.
	
Figure 10-1: 
How to 
press tofu.
	
	
Tofu has little taste of its own. This mild taste is what makes it one of the best 
ingredients for veganizing recipes. Tofu absorbs any flavors, sweet or savory, 
so by using marinades, syrups, sweeteners, sauces, oils, vinegar, lemon juice, 
soy sauce, herbs, and spices, you can make tofu taste like practically anything!
Here’s a basic preparation for tofu that has been pressed or frozen and 
thawed:
	
1.	Cut the tofu into four long, equal slabs, or dice it into cubes.
	
2.	Marinate the tofu in a mixture of soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, 
minced ginger, garlic, maple syrup, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.
	
	 Refrigerate the marinating tofu for at least an hour, turning once after 30 
minutes.
	
3.	Fry, sauté, or bake it at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.
The resulting tofu is great in a sandwich with your favorite fillings, or tossed 
on a green salad with your favorite dressing.
Tempeh
Tempeh is a less-refined version of tofu that originated in Indonesia. Whole, 
cooked soybeans are diced up into small bits and then mixed with an edible 
mold to start a fermentation process (much like the process through which 
some cheeses are produced). This fermentation creates enzymes, which 
make the soy protein more digestible and higher in B vitamins. The mold can 
look like veins of black, white, or gray running through the beans. The result 
is a dense, mashed cake of soybeans. These cakes of tempeh can be found in 
the refrigerator section at health food stores.

128
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
Tempeh has a denser texture than tofu, but like tofu, it can be baked, fried, 
sautéed, crumbled into casseroles or sauces, sliced into slabs and used for 
sandwich filling, or cubed and tossed into salads instead of croutons. Sticking 
with the “flavor sponge” theme, tempeh can be marinated in any mixture you 
like because it will soak up the flavors nicely. For a nice meaty recipe, try the 
Mushroom Sloppy Tempeh Joes in Chapter 14.
Wheat meat (a.k.a. seitan)
Seitan (say-tahn), also known as wheat gluten, is a great source of protein and 
is very low in fat. Even though it’s made from wheat flour, seitan takes the 
place of the protein on your veganized menu. Because it’s made by kneading 
and washing the bran and starch out of wheat flour, seitan is totally bland. 
However, to add flavor, you simmer it in a marinating broth. Chinese vegetar­
ian restaurants commonly use seitan to make mock chicken, beef, or pork 
dishes.
	
Premade seitan can be found in tubs or vacuum packages in the refrigerator 
section at your local health or natural foods store. You can find seitan in many 
different forms, such as precut fajita strips, cutlets, or loaves. The texture of 
seitan is close to chicken, so it’s especially good for replacing poultry in reci­
pes. Dense, chewy, and often very tender, seitan can be a real crowd pleaser 
for dinner parties and celebrations that include meat eaters. Seitan is even 
tough enough to stand up to grilling and broiling, and it works nicely in stews 
and rich pasta sauces.
Making traditional seitan at home takes a little time, but it’s pretty simple. 
The kneading process can be a meditation to enjoy and can easily be shared 
with family and friends. To make traditional seitan at home, follow the recipe 
in Chapter 13.
	
If you want a shortcut for making your own seitan at home, try purchasing one 
of the mixes available at your health food store. Harvest Direct’s Seitan Quick 
Mix is a premade dry mix that shortens the cooking time and that is cheaper 
than premade seitan at the store. Make sure you follow the directions on the 
box exactly until you feel confident with the end result. After you’re comfort­
able, you can move on to making your own from scratch.
Mushrooms
Mushrooms make frequent appearances on vegan menus due to their rich 
tastes and dense and chewy textures. Dried and fresh mushrooms add depth 
and earthy flavor to savory meals while adding medicinal benefits to your 
menus. Because mushrooms contain glutamic acid, the natural version of 
monosodium glutamate (MSG), they really liven up the flavors in dishes.

129
 Chapter 10: Comfort Foods: Veganizing Meat, Dairy, and Other Old Favorites
Shiitake, portabella, button, chanterelle, morel, and many other varieties can 
easily be added to soups, stir-fry, pasta, bean and grain dishes, stews, gra­
vies, and sauces. Fresh mushrooms are wonderful to add to different kinds of 
dishes, and keeping a few varieties of dried mushrooms expands the variety 
of last-minute dinner options you have at home. Simply soak dried mush­
rooms in water until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes, before cooking. Some 
top mycologists (mushroom scientists) recommend cooking button mush­
rooms to break down cancer-causing toxins in this variety.
To replace meat in a casserole or chili, chopped portabellas can be sautéed 
with a little olive oil, garlic, and salt and then added in the meat step. Sautéed 
mushrooms also can be pulverized in a food processor to mimic the texture 
of ground beef in tacos or burritos. Grill or broil large, marinated portabellas 
and serve them between burger buns for a meat-like treat. Most Italian-style 
pasta sauces work well with sliced, diced, or whole mushroom caps cooked 
into them.
Textured vegetable protein (TVP)
Textured vegetable protein, or TVP, is a cost-saving, soy-derived product. 
Made from defatted soy flour, TVP is cooked under high pressure and then 
dried into flakes, granules, or chunks. An excellent source of protein and 
fiber, TVP is an inexpensive way for large institutions to feed huge numbers 
of people when meat is too costly. TVP also is a decent source of potassium, 
magnesium, and calcium.
TVP can be bought in bulk or in smaller packages and is a great substitute 
for ground meat in recipes like chili, tacos, and meatloaf. TVP keeps well in a 
cool cupboard in a sealed container for at least a year. This feature makes it a 
good option when stocking your vegan cupboards.
	
TVP absorbs liquid from sauces and marinades really quickly, so it’s a nice 
fast-cooking protein source. Because TVP is such a great sponge, you may 
need to add extra liquid when converting traditional recipes. Add about 1 cup 
of TVP and an extra cup of liquid to your dish, and then combine well and 
cook according to the recipe. Dishes with TVP tend to freeze and defrost well, 
so they’re good for time-saving, cook-ahead menus.
You may already be eating TVP and just haven’t realized it. Did you know 
that you can buy TVP Bacon Bits? These vegan nibbles aren’t wholesome 
enough to consume regularly (partially hydrogenated soybean oil, anyone?), 
but they can be a fun, occasional treat — especially for the aspiring vegan 
who struggles with giving up meat.

Bean and grain mash-ups
Countless cultures around the globe use native varieties of beans and whole 
grains as dietary staples. In the southwest United States and Central America, 
beans and corn have always been a part of the culinary tradition. Eastern 
European and Russian cultures include rye, spelt, and barley along with 
local beans to create hearty meals and complete proteins. Indian, Japanese, 
Chinese, Korean, and other Asian cultures have used many varieties of rice 
along with soybeans, lentils, and adzuki beans as the base for diets that many 
experts believe to be among the healthiest in the world.
	
Mixing different grains and beans together can be a wholesome technique for 
creating hearty meals. As you experiment with different combinations, you’ll 
discover the wide world of bean and grain mash-ups. The possibilities are only 
limited by your imagination. Here are some ideas to get you started:
	
✓	Cooked kidney beans and brown rice can be mashed together with 
onions, celery, sunflower seeds, and herbs to create tasty veggie patties 
for burgers or to serve alongside breakfast.
	
✓	Lentils and quinoa can be mixed with mushrooms and sage for morning 
“sausages” to be baked or lightly fried.
	
✓	Refried beans and corn can be mixed with chilies and other vegetables 
to create delicious chili stews or layered dips.
	
✓	Any combination of grain and bean can be combined to form a loaf with 
whole-grain breadcrumbs, chopped nuts, and sautéed vegetables and 
mushrooms to bake a veggie loaf. Drizzle some naturally sweetened 
ketchup on top and bake for an old-fashioned presentation that will 
remind you of Grandma’s meatloaf!
Egg-cellent Egg-Free Cooking 
and Baking
When nonvegans bite into my egg-free cookies and cakes, their eyes light up with 
delight, but they inevitably ask, “How did you make this without eggs?” Luckily, 
there are many ways to bake delicious creations without cracking eggs.

131
 Chapter 10: Comfort Foods: Veganizing Meat, Dairy, and Other Old Favorites
Traditional recipes for baked goods rely on eggs for specific functions. In 
these recipes, eggs
	
✓	Act as a binder to keep the ingredients and flour all working together in 
harmony
	
✓	Contain specific chemicals that react with other ingredients to create 
the leavening, or lifting, that happens during baking
	
✓	Thicken recipes
	
All three of these results can be obtained without eggs; you just need to 
understand what effect the recipe needs the egg for. If you’re making a muffin 
recipe, the eggs would have been used as a binder. Mashed banana or flax­
seeds will work well in that case. If you need to thicken a custard or quiche 
recipe, tofu will work well. Leavening is often created with baking powder or 
baking soda instead of eggs.
Tofu as ovo
Tofu comes to the rescue again; this time, instead of standing in for meat (as 
described earlier in the chapter), it becomes an egg replacer. Not only does 
tofu work well as a binder in baked recipes, but it also can actually look like 
eggs in other recipes. Full of protein without the cholesterol or bad karma of 
eating a baby chicken, tofu eggs are easy to prepare and delicious.
If you’re looking for some ways to use tofu as a stand-in for eggs, try these 
tasty options:
	
✓	Crumble drained soft or silken tofu to make a scramble. To spice up 
your scramble, mix the tofu with sautéed onions, garlic, a pinch of tur­
meric, and a little nutritional yeast. The flavors and colors all combine 
to create a very real-looking breakfast dish.
	
✓	Slabs of pressed tofu can be cut into rounds with a biscuit cutter and 
sautéed in olive oil, garlic and onion powders, and salt and pepper to 
make fake fried eggs. These “eggs” work nicely on toasted English muf­
fins with Tofu Sour Cream for a nice brunch dish. (See the recipe for 
Tofu Sour Cream in Chapter 13.)
	
✓	Tofu can stand in the place of eggs for any quiche recipe. Buy a premade 
vegan pie crust or make your own, fill with mixed tofu filling, and bake 
for a glorious presentation.

132
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
Binding without eggs
Certain recipes, such as casseroles, sauces, veggie patties, and simple cookie 
and muffin recipes, need a binder to keep all the ingredients together. To 
create the binding effect of one egg, use any of the following options:
	
✓	A flour and water mixture: Use 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy, gar­
banzo, or whole-wheat flour mixed with 2 tablespoons of water to bind a 
muffin recipe or thicken a sauce or gravy.
	
✓	Applesauce: For sweet baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, muffins, 
and scones, 1⁄3 cup applesauce works well. Add 1⁄4 teaspoon extra baking 
powder to the recipe to help with rising or leavening.
	
✓	Ground flaxseeds: Simmer 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseeds in a small 
saucepan with 3 tablespoons of water until thickened. Allow to cool 
before adding to recipes for baked goods in place of the egg.
	
	Flaxseeds are a great source of omega-3 oils, which means they can spoil 
quickly. Grind them fresh for each recipe, and store whole flaxseeds in 
the freezer in an opaque, air-tight container to prevent spoilage from 
light and heat.
	
✓	Mashed fruits and vegetables: For example, 1⁄3 cup mashed very ripe 
banana works well in sweet baked goods. Other substitutes include 1⁄3 
cup of either mashed white or sweet potatoes or mashed or blended 
cooked vegetables.
Opting for vegan gelatin
Gelatin is an ingredient that’s used to turn liquid 
into a solid or semi-solid. (Think Jell-O.) Gelatin 
is often used to thicken desserts, candy, ice 
cream, marshmallows, and low-fat yogurt. It 
also is used to make vitamin capsules, cosmet­
ics, and photographic film, and to filter some 
alcohol, beer, and wines. Believe it or not, gela­
tin is made from the collagen found in animal 
bones, horns, hooves, skins, tendons, and other 
miscellaneous body parts. Commercial gelatin 
is a byproduct of the meat and veal calf produc­
tion industry — so it’s definitely not vegan.
Luckily, we vegans can avoid gelatin and still 
create dishes that need binding or gelling. You 
can now purchase packaged vegan gelatins 
in some natural food and grocery stores and 
online. Another excellent natural gelling agent is 
agar, or Kanten. (See the recipe for Fruit Kanten 
in Chapter 15.) This sea vegetable can be found 
in flakes, bars, and powders. Especially good 
for gelling aspics and terrines and creating 
creamy fillings for cakes and mousse, agar can 
be found in natural food stores and Asian gro­
cery stores.

133
 Chapter 10: Comfort Foods: Veganizing Meat, Dairy, and Other Old Favorites
	
✓	Nut or seed butters: You can use 1⁄4 to 1⁄3 cup almond, cashew, or peanut 
butter. Or try the same amount of tahini or sunflower butter to bind a 
muffin or quick bread recipe. The same amount, or smaller, can be used 
to add richness and thickness to a sauce recipe.
	
✓	Oats: You can use 1⁄4 cup quick oats as a binder, mixed with the liquid 
ingredients, in muffin or quick bread recipes. Oats also can act as a 
thickener in sauces and soups.
	
✓	Powdered egg replacer: You can find this egg substitute in health food 
stores. This product lasts indefinitely if properly stored in a cool, dry 
place. Best used in baking to bind recipes.
	
✓	Tofu: Use 1⁄4 cup mashed or blended silken or soft tofu to help bind 
muffin, scone, and quick bread recipes. Add 1⁄4 teaspoon extra baking 
powder to the recipe to help with rising or leavening.
	
✓	Yogurt: Try 1⁄3 cup soy yogurt to bind a muffin, pancake, or cookie 
recipe. Use unsweetened yogurt for thickening savory dishes like soups 
or sauces.
The New Dairy: Substituting with 
Vegan Milks, Butters, and Cheeses
Bessie the cow can have her retirement party now — the vegan dairy cooler 
is stocked full with cow’s milk replacements that work really well in recipes. 
With all these great nondairy milks, butter substitutes, and cheese stand-ins, 
vegans can indulge in every food craving and texture possible.
Products can be made from grains, nuts, soy, or a combination of these. 
Vegan milks are easy to use in traditional recipes, because they generally 
replace the same amount of cow’s milk. Baking, basting, grilling, and spread­
ing are all still possible with your new favorite foods.
Got other milks?
Baking and cooking without cow’s milk couldn’t be easier these days. It’s rare 
to enter a grocery store that doesn’t carry at least soymilk. (And most stores 
even carry different varieties, such as unsweetened, sweetened, unsweetened 
vanilla, sweetened vanilla, chocolate, carob, and eggnog). You can even pur­
chase soy cream and little individual juice-box sizes for kids. Many varieties 
of rice milk, hemp milk, and almond milk are available for people who want or 
need to avoid soy products. (Because soy is one of the top ten food allergies, 
it may make sense for you to try a non-soy version.)

134
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
Converting cow’s milk in recipes is easy: If the recipe calls for 1 cup of cow’s milk, 
use 1 cup of soy, rice, hemp, or nut milk. It couldn’t get any easier than that!
A delicious way to get a larger variety of milks into your diet or baking is to 
make your own nut milks at home. Simply blend 2 cups of raw nuts with 3 to 
4 cups of water for at least 2 minutes. Strain the resulting liquid through a 
fine mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth and you have delicious, homemade 
nut milk! This recipe works well with almonds or cashews.
Baking recipes sometimes call for buttermilk, which is a fermented product 
made from cow’s milk. Buttermilk is great for leavening and is used in baking 
because it reacts with the baking soda to form more bubbles in the batter. To 
make your own vegan buttermilk, simply stir 11⁄2 teaspoons apple cider vine­
gar into 1 cup of soymilk and allow to curdle at room temperature for at least 
5 minutes before adding to your recipe. This makes 1 cup of buttermilk.
	
When converting a recipe by using vegan buttermilk, cut the amount of baking 
powder in half and use 1⁄4 teaspoon of baking soda for each cup of buttermilk 
used. Use a one-to-one ratio when replacing milk with vegan buttermilk. This 
technique works really well in quick breads, scones, muffins, and biscuits.
Baking with “butter”
Butter or shortening is used in baking to add fat and flavor while also creat­
ing pockets of air within dough to give pastry a light and flaky texture. Butter 
also is used in recipes to create a golden brown crust in baked goods and 
gives a moist and rich mouth feel. Because butter is now off your menu, you 
need to use other products to create delicious baked goods.
	
Traditional shortening is technically vegan and can be used in place of butter 
in recipes, but it’s so unhealthy and full of heart disease–inducing hydroge­
nated fats that I don’t recommend it.
An alternative to shortening or butter in baking recipes is to use 3⁄4 of the 
amount in an oil, such as canola or liquid unrefined coconut oil. You also can 
use vegan margarine for baking without much difference in the final product. 
Earth Balance is an excellent brand of vegan margarine; it cooks up nicely in 
cookies, cakes, and pie crusts.
	
Unrefined coconut oil, a healthy saturated fat, also can be used to replicate 
butter. Freeze the appropriate amount of unrefined coconut oil in a small bowl 
until it’s hardened. Remove the bowl from the freezer and sit it in another 
bowl with warm water to loosen the chunk of coconut oil. Grate the frozen 
oil on a cheese grater and add the pieces to the flour in a pie crust recipe to 
mimic the little “pebbles” of butter fat that make a light, flaky pie crust.

 Chapter 10: Comfort Foods: Veganizing Meat, Dairy, and Other Old Favorites
Cheese options: Nutritional 
yeast, miso, and mochi
I’ve often heard aspiring vegans lament about their fondness for cheese and 
how much they miss it. The flavor and texture of cheese are sometimes diffi­
cult to duplicate, but you have more wonderful options to try every day.
Soy-, nut-, and rice-based “cheeses” can be found in any natural food store, 
and they’re becoming more common in regular grocery stores as well. You 
can buy American-style, individually wrapped squares as well as blocks of 
cheddar-, mozzarella-, and Monterey Jack–flavored varieties. Some of the 
most amazingly rich-tasting nut cheeses come from the raw foods world. 
Using old-world cheese-making techniques, these raw food culinary geniuses 
are making spreadable, savory cheeses that can be found online and in select 
natural food stores that carry raw vegan foods.
Look online or ask your natural food store manager for the following variet­
ies of cheese: Dr. Cow’s Tree Nut Cheese, Follow Your Heart cheese, Galaxy’s 
Vegan Rice slices, and Teese Vegan Cheese.
	
Remember to read the label on “fake” cheeses carefully. If a cheese contains 
casein, a protein found in cow’s milk, it may be lactose free, but it isn’t vegan.
A cheesy flavor and texture can be created without the processed “fake” 
cheeses that you find on store shelves. The ingredients in the following sec­
tions can either add a rich, savory flavor, like with nutritional yeast and miso, 
or a gooey texture to dishes like with mochi. These ingredients appeal to 
people who prefer to use less processed foods, and they each also offer their 
own special nutritional benefits.
Nutritional yeast
Nutritional yeast is a marvelous addition to converted recipes as well as an 
excellent condiment for your kitchen table. Made from inactive dry yeast, 
Red Star vegan nutritional yeast is loaded with protein and B vitamins, 
including B12. These savory, cheesy flakes can be sprinkled liberally on 
pasta, steamed veggies, salads, and soups instead of Parmesan cheese. Great 
for creating a cheesy, rich flavor, nutritional yeast is common in vegan cook­
ing for converting recipes like macaroni and cheese and creamy sauces. (You 
can find a recipe for Mac n’ TeaseCheese in Chapter 14.)
Miso
Another excellent soy food is miso. A fermented soybean paste rich in pro­
tein and digestive enzymes, miso can help add a savory, cheese-like taste 
to soups, salad dressings, and marinades. It also can be used in place of 
Worcestershire sauce, salt, and soy sauce. The Tofu Cheese recipe in Chapter 
13 is made with miso paste.

136
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
Miso paste is considered one of the most powerful soy foods in terms of its 
medicinal properties. Miso has been used to diminish the effects of smoking, 
air pollution, and radiation.
Miso soup is familiar to a lot of people because of the growing popularity of 
sushi restaurants. This rich vegetable and tofu broth is flavored with miso 
paste. Be careful, though: Most sushi restaurants also use bonito, or dried 
fish flakes, in their miso soups. You can easily make your own at home by 
simply adding a slurry of whisked miso paste and water into cooked veg­
etable soup. Because the soybean enzymes are delicate and can taste bitter 
when boiled, miso shouldn’t be boiled. Instead, you should stir it into the 
soup at the end of cooking.
Mochi
Sometimes vegans miss the creamy, gooey, and sticky nature of cheese. 
These textures aren’t always easy to find in the fruit and vegetable world. 
Enter mochi. A traditional Japanese food made from pounded glutinous rice 
that’s formed into cakes, mochi is a favorite New Year’s food in Japan and a 
year-round snack in Hawaii.
While mochi can be made at home, it takes a lot of time and a lot of muscle. 
The pounding process can take a few hours. Luckily, cakes of plain, naturally 
sweetened, and savory flavored mochi can be found in the refrigerator sec­
tion of your natural food store.
Mochi can be used in the following ways:
	
✓	Grated or chopped very finely and sprinkled on steaming vegetables: 
The mochi will melt on the vegetables like cheese.
	
✓	Grated and added to sauces for pizza or pasta: Again, the mochi will 
melt and become creamy.
	
✓	Cubed into 1-inch squares and then baked at 450 degrees for 10 min­
utes or until the squares puff up and brown slightly: Top the mochi 
with nut butter and jam; dip in a mixture of soy sauce, agave, and grated 
ginger; or slather with vegan butter and maple syrup.
	
✓	Made into mochi cheese: Dice 8 ounces of mochi and simmer it in a 
small saucepan with just enough water to cover. Stir regularly until the 
mochi melts. Season with a little soy sauce, umeboshi vinegar, and a 
variety of herbs suited for your recipe. Use a combination of thyme, 
rosemary, and oregano to create mochi cheese suitable for Italian pizza 
or lasagna. For a Thanksgiving cream sauce, try mixing up the seasoning 
by adding sage, thyme, and freshly ground black pepper into the melted 
mochi.

S
ome vegans say they make a difference three times a day — by eating 
vegan at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But being vegan isn’t just about 
food — it’s a whole lifestyle. Living as a vegan requires a deeper examination 
of your entire life, from your shirt and shampoo to your furniture and laun­
dry detergent. Everything you do, use, and buy is another chance to practice 
your vegan ethics in a very real way.
The basic premise of being vegan is that it’s a lifestyle that doesn’t abuse 
or use animals in any way. This means that using animals as food, clothing, 
furniture, or ingredients is a no-no. Vegans aspire to avoid using animal prod­
ucts of any kind — period.
You don’t have to explain yourself to anyone, but vegan living isn’t the norm, 
and it generally requires more thought than nonvegan living when it comes 
to just about every aspect of your life. At first it may seem overwhelming, and 
you may feel like you have to do everything at once and change every bit of 
your daily experience. No worries! This is a big transition, and no one expects 
you to do everything right, or right now.
This chapter leads you through the other areas of vegan living that may be 
less familiar than what you’re going to eat for lunch. You need to develop a 
new vocabulary regarding ingredients and materials. As you discover and 
explore different areas, you’ll become an expert in choosing products that fit 
the spirit of being vegan.

Fashionably Compassionate: Animal-Free 
Clothing and Footwear
Animal products and skins are very common in clothing manufacturing — 
you’d be surprised at how many of these items you probably already own. 
Leather, down, suede, fur, feathers, sheep’s wool, silk, shells, angora rabbit 
fur, and other animal skins are all produced by killing or confining animals, 
and these materials aren’t considered vegan. (Because leather and fur 
require the killing of an animal outright, they shouldn’t even be considered 
vegetarian.)
Clothing made from animal materials comes at a high price to other living 
creatures, whether you buy it at a discount mall or a high-priced designer 
boutique. Vegan fashions have evolved quickly over the last decade, and 
designers now create current looks in cruelty-free fabrics and materials. 
Some are even at the forefront of the fashion trends, and these products are 
getting easier to find every year.
Where to buy the latest looks
Vegan fashionistas can rejoice in this modern age of clothing design and 
accessibility. Buying vegan clothing is much easier these days thanks to the 
Internet, forward-thinking designers, and those old standbys — discount 
stores. Whether you’re looking for daily wear, shoes, bags, belts, formal wear, 
party clothes, wallets, accessories, coats, or faux apparel, you should have 
no trouble finding a variety of animal-friendly, cruelty-free options:
	
✓	Athletic shoes: You can find vegan-friendly athletic shoes by searching 
the stores and Web sites of Zappos and New Balance for running and 
walking shoes, Airwalk and Burton for snowboard boots, and Vans for 
skateboard shoes. You can order vegan ballet shoes from Cynthia King 
Dance Studio in Brooklyn, New York. Your vegan shoes can be a walking 
billboard for cruelty-free ethics!
	
✓	Daily wear/casual clothing: You can put together vegan outfits on the 
cheap and on the fly by shopping at discount clothing stores like Target, 
Wal-Mart, and Payless Shoes, which offer shoes, bags, and belts created 
from man-made materials — usually plastic, hemp, canvas, or “pleather.” 
The online store Alloy has current bag, belt, and shoe designs for teens 
and women.
	
	Because living “green” is often synonymous with living vegan, you may 
want to avoid shopping at Wal-Mart and other large chains. These cor­
porations often have a history of mistreating their employees or involv­
ing themselves in other irresponsible business practices.

139
 Chapter 11: Beyond Food: Embracing the Whole Vegan Lifestyle
	
✓	Designer fashions: Cutting-edge shoe designs are available from Mink 
Shoes, based in Los Angeles. You can purchase trendy handbags online 
from Matt and Nat and in large department stores like Bloomingdales. 
And Stella McCartney’s clothing designs can be seen on the catwalk 
at fashion shows around the world. These are just a few examples of 
how vegan clothing has finally reached the highest levels of the fashion 
world.
	
✓	Outdoor apparel: Synthetic down and fleece jackets offer fantastic pro­
tection from the elements, so true down coats are no longer necessary. 
Several outfitters nationwide — notably REI, Pangea, and Patagonia — 
sell hiking, snow, and camping gear in synthetic and canvas materials. 
And nonleather saddlebags are available for motorcycle and scooter 
riders from such companies as Cycleport and Motoliberty.
	
✓	Sporting equipment: Don’t throw in the towel yet — order a vegan 
baseball glove from Rawlings or Heartland Products, Ltd. Rawlings and 
Spalding offer vegan versions of balls for most sports, including volley­
ball, soccer, and baseball.
	
To find vegan clothing online, try searching for “vegan clothing.” To get more 
specific, search for “leather-free shoes” or “non-leather shoes.” You also can 
sign up for vegan glamazon Chloe Jo Berman’s fabulous weekly e-zine at www.
girliegirlarmy.com for the latest in stylish fashion and other vegan topics.
If you happen to find yourself in Portland, Oregon, you should know that it 
boasts the only 100 percent vegan mini-mall! Including a vegan grocery store, 
tattoo parlor, the offices of vegan publication Herbivore, and a bakery, the 
Vegan Mini-Mall offers a haven of vegan goodness in the Great Northwest. 
You can check out the mall’s location at www.veganminimall.com.
Flying away from feathers and skirting silks
Two popular materials used for clothing and house­
wares are very un-vegan: feathers and silk. You can 
find feathers on countless articles of clothing and 
tchotchkes, including hair accessories, boas, cat 
toys, and earrings. You should avoid purchasing 
products made with feathers. Birds of all kinds use 
their feathers to insulate themselves from water 
and weather, and some birds use certain feath­
ers to control their movements while in flight. Birds 
even use found feathers in constructing their nests, 
so reconsider picking feathers up from the ground. 
Many species of gloriously colored birds have been 
hunted to near extinction because their feathers, 
so bright to attract mating partners, are desired 
by humans for their hats and clothing. Many birds, 
like peacocks, are kept alive in order to be painfully 
plucked periodically for their tail feathers.
Silk is shiny, but also cruel. After about a month of 
life, silkworms work for three to four days to spin 
a glorious cocoon out of over a thousand yards of 
a single silk strand. The cocoons are kept warm 
for just over a week and then steamed to kill the 
developing moth inside. The silk is then woven into 
a delicate thread and made into clothing, sheets, 
and various other products for human consump­
tion. Up to 30,000 worms are killed to produce 12 
pounds of raw silk.

140
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
What about wearing those 
old, nonvegan items?
Choosing to buy new items in vegan-only materials is the logical next step 
for someone eating a plant-based, animal-free diet. But what about all those 
leather shoes still populating your closet floor? Are you really a vegan if you 
still use your leather purse? Is it bad to keep wearing your animal-based 
clothing?
These decisions must be made by the individual. Some vegans believe that 
using, wearing, or consuming any animal products is not living a truly vegan 
lifestyle. For them, wearing old or used nonvegan clothing is unacceptable. 
Leather shoes are made from a dead animal, and because the animal dies in 
the process of producing the shoes, some vegans believe that you shouldn’t 
wear the shoes at all — even if you owned them long before you adopted the 
vegan lifestyle.
Other vegans have no problem continuing to wear the leather, wool, or feath­
ered items they already own. Their attitude is more “waste not, want not.” 
Very few vegans will begrudge you your decades-old leather belt, or a pair of 
vintage shoes passed down from a grandparent.
If you want to stop wearing your animal-based clothing, consider donating 
it. Often, when people adopt a vegan lifestyle, they donate all their leather 
things, including belts, briefcases, cellphone cases, and guitar straps. By 
giving these items to others, the products are used rather than thrown away, 
and so the animal didn’t die in vain. Most people never think about the 
impact their purchases and consumption have on the world around them, so 
even slow or minor changes are an indication of your caring and empathy.
If you’re looking to get rid of old fur coats, stoles, or sheepskin jackets, a com­
passionate option is to donate them to Coats for Cubs. This program is run by 
the Humane Society of the United States, which collects fur items and distrib­
utes them to wildlife rehabilitation centers around the country. These centers 
use the coats as bedding to warm and comfort injured or orphaned wildlife. 
Some younger animals make imaginary friends out of their new fur blanket, 
playing and wrestling with the item as if it were a sibling. Your donation is tax-
deductible and provides an amazing end to the coat of shame hanging in your 
closet. For information, see www.hsus.org/furfree/campaigns/c4c.
	
Don’t be concerned with the attitude that other people may hold about your 
clothing — if you cared what other people thought, you probably wouldn’t 
have become vegan in the first place!

Vegan Beauty Aids and Health Products
Beauty aids have been around almost as long as people. Ancient Egyptians 
used fly dung and animal fat to create dark eye paints for both men and 
women. Nowadays, some people are content to let their natural beauty shine 
through with no adornment, but many modern men and women still like to 
jazz things up a little with makeup and perfume. Modern beauty products are 
hiding an ugly secret, however. Sadly, most of these products come at a high 
price, as countless animals are killed every year to create and test cosmetics 
for humans to use.
Vitamins and supplements are a $20 billion business in the United States 
alone. While these products can be used to protect and heal your body from 
illness, many are nonvegan because they contain animal ingredients. For a 
full list of nonvegan ingredients to look out for, check the PETA Web site for 
their comprehensive animal ingredients list.
Fortunately, finding vegan beauty aids and health products has become easier 
in the last few years, because vegan certification labels have become more 
popular and traditional companies have begun to formulate vegan product 
lines. Many companies use no animal products at all and don’t test their prod­
ucts on animals, so they can be considered entirely vegan companies.
Waking up to your makeup
Educating yourself about the origins of the ingredients in your makeup is 
another step toward an integrated vegan lifestyle. You should consider two 
issues with beauty products:
	
✓	Do they contain animal byproducts or ingredients derived from an 
animal source?
	
✓	Were they tested on animals?
Many products advertise that they weren’t tested on animals, but they may 
still contain animal-based ingredients.
	
The term cruelty-free is used a lot when it comes to vegan products. It means 
that no animals were harmed in the testing or production of the ingredients 
used in a product. Any product with this kind of label is 100 percent free of 
all animal ingredients. In other parts of the world, including England, the term 
animal-free is more commonly used because cruelty-free labels were abused 
by companies that still included ingredients from animals even though they no 
longer tested the products on animals.

142
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
It would be difficult, to say the least, to remember all the animal and insect 
ingredients used in cosmetics. Rather than take a list with you to the store, 
it’s easier to buy makeup from companies that have been through a certifica­
tion process and are labeled vegan. Some of the great vegan companies pro­
ducing top-quality beauty products are Urban Decay, Ecco Bella, Zia, BWC, 
and Gabriel Cosmetics. This takes all the guesswork out of it — now you just 
have to find the right shade of blush!
Checking labels and seals of approval
A few different certification organizations deem a product or company to be 
vegan and cruelty-free. The Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics 
(CCIC) gives a leaping bunny symbol to companies that don’t use any new 
animal testing in developing their products, either by the company, its suppli­
ers, or laboratories (see Figure 11-1). The products covered by this label can 
be cosmetics, personal health and beauty, or household products. The CCIC 
has a list of certified companies on its Web site, www.leapingbunny.org.
	
Because this designation only covers the testing aspect of a product and 
not its ingredients, you need to check the list of ingredients for any animal 
byproducts.
Another seal to look for is the “Certified Vegan” logo used by Vegan Action 
(www.vegan.org). This logo, shown in Figure 11-2, is used on products that 
haven’t been tested on animals and don’t contain any animal or insect ingre­
dients or byproducts.

Certifed Vegan Logo – Trademarked
These logos make identifying vegan products easier and can help you shop 
without carrying around an ingredient list in your bag. Buying these products 
is another way to show companies that the vegan market is growing, and 
such purchases make the ideals of vegan living more visible to mainstream 
consumers. Note that not every vegan product is certified by these organiza­
tions, so if you like a product but don’t see a label, do a little investigating, 
because the company may be in the certification process.
	
Beauty Without Cruelty was the first cosmetics and beauty brand formed spe­
cifically to offer an alternative to products that use animal testing and ingre­
dients. Founded in England in 1963, this brand has grown worldwide and is a 
true vegan success story.
The animal rights activism group PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals, also has devised a labeling campaign to help guide your purchases 
of beauty, healthcare, and cleaning products. The companies that make the 
products certified with the “Caring Consumer” bunny logo (see Figure 11-3 
and www.caringconsumer.com) have either signed a statement of assur­
ance to PETA or verified a statement that they don’t perform animal testing 
and promise not to do any in the future.
	
None of these labels are legally binding, and the companies could theoretically 
perform testing anyway, but it would be a public relations nightmare for them 
if the public found out they were secretly using animal ingredients or testing.
	
Many companies carry both cruelty-free products and products that contain 
animal byproducts or may still be tested on cats, dogs, and rabbits. These 
companies take the liberty of presenting the image of a caring, concerned 
organization on a certain product while continuing to use and abuse animals 
for other gains. If you feel strongly about not supporting a company that 
harms animals in any way for any of its products, don’t buy any of its cruelty-
free products either.

Scrutinizing ingredient lists
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn’t set forth a law or mandate that 
requires companies to test products for safety. That’s right: The government 
doesn’t test cosmetics and personal care products for safety, because the 
industry is supposed to police itself. That can lead to problems for consum­
ers, because many beauty products contain toxic components, including 
known carcinogens, phthalates, and hormone disrupters.
Because no oversight committee exists to make sure that companies are 
truly living up to their supposed code of ethics, it’s wise to get acquainted 
with well-known vegan companies and common ingredients used in products. 
The more you look at labels, the more you become aware of which words are 
code for “cruelly obtained ingredient.”
One example is carmine, a dye found in many lipsticks and blushes, which is 
made from crushed red beetles. Lactose and casein are ingredients used in 
many skin care products that are derived from cow’s milk. You can always 
contact a manufacturer directly if you have any questions about its products.
	
The nonprofit Environmental Working Group has compiled a safety guide, 
titled “Skin Deep,” that provides toxicity information on personal care prod­
ucts and cosmetics. This independent research is the best available informa­
tion with which to make safer purchasing decisions. Check out your favorite 
products at www.cosmeticsdatabase.com. You can also go to www.peta.
org to find a list of ingredients to watch for and avoid.

Being careful with medicines and flu shots
One of the most common reasons that people cite for becoming vegan is 
that they want to be healthy. A sound vegan diet is better for protecting your 
body from the main causes of disease and death in the United States than any 
other way of eating. But what happens when you do get sick?
Medicinal drugs are certainly a miracle of modern science, and going to the 
emergency room for a broken leg is certainly more advisable than wrapping 
tofu around your compound fracture. However, lurking in those medicines, 
flu shots, and vaccines are many ingredients that don’t jive with the vegan 
ethics of cruelty-free living.
Boxes and bottles of over-the-counter medications are rarely vegan. That’s 
usually because of the coating or capsules, which often contain gelatin. 
Because these drugs also are tested on animals, they aren’t vegan even if 
they are void of animal ingredients. Seek out alternatives of the medicine in a 
liquid form that doesn’t contain gelatin.
Similarly, many forms of prescribed medicines and drugs are tested on ani­
mals and may contain actual animal byproducts. For example, Premarin, used 
to treat menopausal women for hormonal issues, is derived from the urine of 
a pregnant mare, hence the name. Flu shots are routinely tested on animals 
and contain animal byproducts and tissues. Vaccines are produced using 
animal tissues to grow the viruses. Chick embryos, gelatin, and cells from calf 
fetuses are common ingredients and growing media. Some vaccines also use 
human tissues like liver albumin.
	
Weigh your beliefs about whether these drugs are effective in keeping you 
healthy and whether they violate your vegan ethics. You may be able to find 
alternatives, so talk with your healthcare provider. Perhaps you can find a ver­
sion of a pill that doesn’t come in a gelatin capsule, or perhaps you can see a 
homeopathic doctor or naturopath that can offer more natural, vegan options 
and medicines. Compounding pharmacies can make some prescriptions to 
order and may have vegan ingredients available to create the right dosage 
and combinations. However, call ahead and ask about the specific medication 
you’re looking for. If you can’t find a vegan medication, don’t be a martyr — 
protect your health and that of your family.
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (www.pcrm.org) is 
steadily gaining ground in encouraging medication that isn’t tested on ani­
mals. Find out as much as you can, and maintain a healthy lifestyle so you 
don’t need as many medications in the long run. If you discover a vegan alter­
native, great. If not, ensure that your health isn’t endangered.

Because babies are given vaccines within the first few hours of life, it’s wise for 
expecting vegan parents to understand the issues and ingredients before 
making their choices on how best to protect their children. Because the vaccine 
ingredients aren’t vegan, parents must weigh the possible consequences of not 
vaccinating their children. It’s understandable to want to go forward with vacci­
nating your kids if you believe that doing so will protect them from serious ill­
nesses later on, regardless of the nonvegan nature of these drugs. I strongly 
encourage you to become familiar with the health issues surrounding vaccina­
tions and flu shots in order to make the most informed choices possible.
The following groups offer resources and information that question the safety 
of vaccines: The National Vaccine Information Center (www.nvic.org), Dr. 
Joseph Mercola (www.mercola.com), and Gary Null (www.garynull.com). 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov) offers infor­
mation on the other side of the issue and encourages parents to vaccinate 
based on their documentation.
Keeping a Truly Vegan Home
Your home should be a safe, comfortable place, filled with good energy and 
products that make you happy. Filling your home environment with vegan 
products is another step toward fully realizing this lifestyle. Every new pur­
chase for your home can add to the solid foundation of your dedication to 
vegan living.
Spotting and replacing hidden nonvegan 
home items
Take a look around your home and begin to notice what materials are used 
to create the items you own. You often can find vegan alternatives for every­
thing from candles to comforters. Activities you may enjoy at home, like 
gardening or playing music, may have relied on animal byproducts in the 
past, but not anymore. Staying vegan goes hand in hand with nontoxic living 
as well, and you can start making stronger connections between cruelty-free 
purchases and eco-friendly living.

Be gentle with yourself. No one is perfect, and you’re already doing more than 
most people by even thinking about these things.
Leaving honey and beeswax for the bees
The vast majority of vegans don’t consider beeswax candles — or any prod­
uct derived from beeswax or honey — to be vegan. A beehive is created with 
countless hours of effort by the bees in each colony (see the nearby sidebar, 
“Busy bees: That’s a lot of work!”). Flying vast distances to gather the neces­
sary ingredients for honey and wax, bees defend their hives and the queen 
with their very lives if they perceive attack.
Any product that’s taken from another species isn’t vegan. Some bees may be 
hurt or killed inadvertently by beekeepers, and bees aren’t programmed to 
gather honey for human uses — they use it to raise their young.
	
Luckily, countless products are available that are natural and nontoxic alter­
natives to beeswax and honey products. You can easily substitute for honey 
in cooking by using agave, maple syrup, or brown rice syrup. Soy candles are 
an excellent alternative to beeswax and are preferable to standard paraffin 
candles, which are a petroleum product. The more natural soy candles also 
refrain from using toxic metals in the wick, and paraffin candles can pollute 
your indoor air with wisps of black smoke.
Busy bees: That’s a lot of work!
The process through which bees create their 
wax is extraordinary. Young worker bees use 
special wax-producing glands in their abdo­
mens. They eat enormous amounts of honey, and 
the glands transform the sugar into wax, which 
the bees then excrete through these glands. The 
bees chew up the bits of wax from their abdo­
mens and plaster the wax to the walls of the hive 
to construct the honeycomb. This amazing struc­
ture is built to maintain the hive’s temperature at 
around 95 degrees Fahrenheit, which is just right 
for bees to be happy and go about their business.
Honeybees fly vast distances every day to 
gather nectar from flowers. They collect nectar 
from 100 to 1,500 flowers before their second 
“honey stomach” is full enough to return to the 
hive. The honeybees then pass on the gathered 
nectar to worker bees in the hive. The worker 
bees chew the nectar with special enzymes 
and distribute it among the little holes in the 
honeycomb. The hive’s internal air circula­
tion evaporates the excess water, turning the 
nectar into honey. A colony of bees requires 
between 120 and 200 pounds of honey a year 
to survive, and this amount of honey production 
requires an incredible amount of work.

Turning down fleece and down in favor of synthetics
Grandma’s feather bed may have been comfortable and warm for the cold 
winter months, but her comfort came at the expense of a lot of geese. Birds 
aren’t protected by the humane slaughter laws, and they’re often kept in 
terrible conditions before they’re killed for food. Because their feathers, or 
down, are then used to make comforters and coats, these products aren’t 
vegan. Even more disturbing is that some ducks and geese are plucked 
repeatedly during their lives to produce down, all without any pain relief.
But you can now find wonderful, animal-free, synthetic down pillows, com­
forters, and coats. Some of these products are even made from recycled 
plastic bottles. Fleece jackets and blankets are excellent at holding warmth 
and wicking away moisture for bedding. The Patagonia outdoor equipment 
company has been using this excellent recycled plastic fleece since 1993 and 
is saving tons of plastic from ending up in landfills.
Getting rid of pesticides in the garden
When you think of gardening, you may envision digging happily in the earth 
or harvesting fresh lettuce from your backyard. These activities can be 
wonderful and in line with vegan living — or not. Using pesticides at home 
to poison and kill pests and rodents in the garden isn’t a vegan way of doing 
business. These chemicals only end up hurting us in the long run as well. 
Using organic gardening methods helps you deter pests in the yard with­
out resorting to the toxic chemicals used to hurt other species. Check out 
Organic Gardening For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Ann Whitman and Suzanne 
DeJohn (Wiley).
Making beautiful vegan music
Drumming, strumming, and fiddling around with instruments at home and 
with friends is a wonderful way to build community and express your creativ­
ity. But many instruments are made using animal products, so be aware when 
buying new ones.
Many stringed instruments like violins, violas, and cellos are made with 
glue made from animals or varnishes made with insects. And while the term 
“catgut” may sound familiar if you ever played viola in elementary school, 
strings for these instruments were never made from felines. They were, and 
still are, made from sheep’s intestines. Most modern musicians prefer to use 
synthetic strings, but some still use the gut strings made from sheep. If you 
have an older stringed instrument, you can take it to your local instrument 
shop and have it restrung with synthetic strings.
You now can purchase drums with synthetic coverings rather than the old 
animal skin hides. And even though guitar straps are often made of leather, 
many vegan brands are now made of synthetics, plastics, hemp, and other 
fabrics.

 Chapter 11: Beyond Food: Embracing the Whole Vegan Lifestyle
A quick Internet search can help you find a good used instrument. You’ll be 
saving money and the environment — and that’s music to this vegan’s ears!
Cleaning up your cleaning products
Cleaning products can be cruelty-free and nontoxic, which is a win-win for 
any vegan household! Choose your nontoxic cleaning products from com­
panies that have taken a cruelty-free pledge. Biopack, Biokleen, Seventh 
Generation, Shaklee, Dr. Bronner’s, Citra Solv, and Green Forest are just a few 
vegan, cruelty-free companies that offer good cleaning products.
	
You also can make your own inexpensive, natural cleaning products at home 
using a few simple ingredients, including lemon juice, salt, and vinegar.
Here are some ways to use fresh lemon juice:
	
✓	Mix a paste of lemon juice and baking soda and rub onto chrome or 
copper. Rinse off with water and then buff with a soft cloth.
	
✓	Mix 1 cup of fresh lemon juice with 1⁄2 cup borax for a powerful toilet 
cleaner that will leave a clean, natural lemon scent.
	
✓	Get rid of lime scale on faucets and taps by rubbing with a cut lemon 
and then rinsing well with water.
	
✓	To naturally bleach linens and whites, add 1⁄2 cup of strained lemon juice 
to the rinse cycle and hang clothes outside in the sun to dry.
	
✓	Reduce bad odors in your fridge by storing half a lemon in it.
	
✓	Freshen up a smelly garbage disposal by running the blades with fresh 
lemon rinds and water.
Here’s how to clean with salt:
	
✓	To clean your cast-iron pan, sprinkle it with salt and wipe clean. Doing so 
helps protect the seasoned surface and ensures a more nonstick surface.
	
✓	Sprinkle salt on fresh wine stains to absorb most of the color. Wipe 
clean with a cloth and dab with white vinegar before washing.
	
✓	Dabbing salt on mosquito bites takes away the itchiness. Just wet the 
place of the bite and rub some salt in.
Here are some home uses for vinegar:
	
✓	To deodorize and unblock partially clogged drains, mix together 1⁄2 cup 
baking soda with 1⁄2 cup salt. Pour this mixture into the drain and then 
pour in 1 cup of white vinegar. A foam will bubble up. After an hour, 
flush the drain with hot water.

150
Part III: Sticking to Your Guns: Staying Vegan 
	
✓	Remove onion or garlic odor from your hands by wiping them with vinegar.
	
✓	To remove the odor of smoke, paint, vomit, or alcohol, place a bowl of 
vinegar in the room.
	
✓	Remove odors from older cars by leaving 2 cups of vinegar in the car 
overnight. Yes, you have to keep the windows rolled up. Remove the 
bowl before driving, and repeat as often as necessary.
	
The Internet has countless “recipes” for making your own cleaning and beauty 
products from natural ingredients. Annie B. Bond’s classic book Better Basics 
for the Home (Three Rivers Press) is an encyclopedia of knowledge in these 
areas and is invaluable for anyone who wants to explore making their own 
products.
Keeping pests away in a gentle way
Now that you’re beginning to clean out your coat closet of animal products, 
it’s time to move on to the hall closet. Embracing the vegan lifestyle means 
holding respect in your heart for all living creatures, even bugs and mice. 
Rather than using toxic cleaning supplies and bug sprays to keep little crit­
ters away, try using these alternatives at home:
	
✓	Trace an ant column back to the ants’ point of entry. Set any of the fol­
lowing items at the entry area in a small line, which ants will not cross: 
cayenne pepper, citrus oil (soaked into a piece of string), lemon juice, 
cinnamon, or coffee grounds.
	
✓	Purchase clove-, orange-, and mint oil-based repellents from health food 
stores. Spray these oils at the bugs’ point of entry into your house.
	
✓	Clean up your kitchen and living areas. Sweep and mop frequently, espe­
cially where you prepare and eat food.
	
✓	Don’t leave any food on the counters.
	
✓	Block or build out rodents and bugs by sealing any holes and cracks in 
baseboards, doors, and windows.
	
✓	Rub topical garlic oil on pets’ ears, paws, and the base of the tail to 
deter fleas. Add raw or cooked garlic or garlic oil to pet food.

reakfast truly is the most important meal 
of the day. Starting your day with sugary, 
caffeine-filled fuel dooms you to a day full of 
roller coaster cravings and energy crashes. Eating 
no breakfast at all sets you up to feeling totally 
starved by lunch, which causes you to eat a huge 
meal and feel tired and bloated in the afternoon. 
Now you know why a coffee at 3 p.m. is necessary 
to get you through your day!
You say you don’t have time for breakfast? Well, 
no sweat. I offer several nourishing ideas in this 
chapter to help you plan for success. Baking some 
dense muffins on the weekend enables you to grab 
a healthy morsel on your way out the door for the 
early, hectic part of the week. Simple, fast smooth­
ies loaded with nutritional extras make the end of the 
week easier to finish.
The beauty of vegan breakfasts is that you can make them in any array of fla­
vors you choose, free of guilt. Enjoy starting your day cruelty- and cholesterol-
free with some of my favorite breakfast recipes.
Quick Fixes for Vegan Breakfasts
Easy breakfasts can be so much more nourishing than a bowl of processed 
cereal or a piece of toast. In one easy meal, you can get complex carbohy­
drates, protein, healthy fats (also important for longer satiety/fullness), and 
a variety of flavors to start your day right. The quick and healthy breakfast 
options I share in this section can be tweaked to your liking too.

Smoothies, for instance, are a cheap, fast meal, and they’re perfect for break­
fast. These blended beverages enable you to consume a variety of healthy 
foods easily in the morning. Proteins like nuts, seeds, and soy yogurt or 
milk can be supplemented with natural, unprocessed hemp seed powder. 
Blending several fruits into one drink gets you halfway to the recommended 
daily intake as set forth by the USDA.
Another fantastic way to make breakfast a quick, healthy meal is to use those 
leftover grains that are sitting in your refrigerator. Any cooked grain can 
be made into “oatmeal” with a few simple steps. Thinking ahead to the next 
morning by ensuring your grains are ready to go is a nice method for eating 
more complex carbohydrates in the morning. Getting creative with leftover 
grains offers you a whole new set of breakfast choices. For even easier break­
fast options, look at the list in Chapter 9 for some more ideas.

                 Breakfast Smoothie
What’s the easiest way to take your supplements? Buy food-based versions and add 
them to your morning ritual! This smoothie is a real blast of energy that keeps you full 
until lunch and provides everything a growing vegan could need. Because this recipe 
makes a lot, you can easily drink one filling glass and leave the rest in an airtight con­
tainer for the next morning, thereby reducing calories. The added vitamin C helps pre­
serve the smoothie overnight.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 large serving or 2 small servings
1 banana, peeled
1 apple, unpeeled, cored
1⁄2 cup frozen blueberries or cherries
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon flaxseeds
1⁄3 cup raw almonds or cashews
1⁄3 cup soy yogurt
1 tablespoon flaxseed oil or Udo’s 3-6-9 Oil
1 teaspoon unflavored vitamin C crystals
1 tablespoon liquid chlorophyll, spirulina, or blue-
green algae powder or liquid
21⁄2 cups plain or vanilla soy, rice, or hemp milk
	
	Add all the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth. Enjoy!
Tip: Using water or a nondairy milk instead of fruit juice reduces the amount of sugars con­
tained in smoothie recipes. Too much sugar in the morning can lead to energy lows or 
cravings for more sugar later in the day.

Savory Starters Vegan Style
Choosing a breakfast that tastes more like dinner is often a good idea if you 
have blood-sugar issues, feel lightheaded in the morning, or just need to be 
more grounded for a busy morning at work. Sugary cereals or overly caffein­
ated beverages don’t support the kind of stable energy you need long term. 
The savory recipes in this section also are useful for those of you who may 
have had one too many drinks last night — heavier, slightly salted breakfasts 
can do wonders for a hangover.
Playing with old favorites, the rich breakfasts here are a nice choice for 
someone who lives in a mixed house where the other eaters may normally 
opt for eggs or bacon. Feel free to use soy sauce, miso, salsa, avocados, or 
other denser ingredients like seitan, tempeh, or beans.
	
Starting your day with a protein-rich breakfast can offer sustained energy and 
can help you feel full longer. People need something different for breakfast 
depending on their health, body type, and plans for the day. Start experiment­
ing with more protein-rich meals in the morning to determine whether that 
type of food changes your energy over the course of the day. Refer to Chapter 
5 for more on sneaking vegan proteins into your diet.

This filling scramble is a necessary recipe for any vegan. It’s delicious, nutritious, and 
will help you convince friends and family members that vegan protein ain’t that hard to 
come by!
Preparation/cooking time: 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound firm (not silken) tofu, drained and 
patted dry
1 teaspoon onion powder
1⁄4 teaspoon turmeric
1⁄2 teaspoon mustard powder
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

	 1	Crumble the tofu into a mixing bowl and sprinkle with onion powder, turmeric, mus­
tard, and salt and pepper. Set aside.
	 2	Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. Add the onion and 
garlic, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Use a metal spatula to 
help scrape up bits of tofu that may stick to the pan.
	 3	Add the sausage rounds and mushrooms to the skillet and sprinkle with the nutritional 
yeast. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often.
	 4	Add the tofu mixture to the skillet and stir well. Drizzle with soy sauce and continue to 
cook for 4 minutes, stirring often, or until the tofu is dry and slightly brown.
Tip: Nonstick pans that are coated with chemicals can emit toxic fumes, so they’re best 
avoided. Instead, cook with a cast-iron pan that can become more nonstick as it seasons 
over time.

Tempeh Hash
Ready for the hearty, veganized version of hash, the traditional breakfast favorite?

	                    Savory Breakfast Polenta Pizza 
	
               with Spinach
Inspired by an article on savory breakfast fare by Mark Bittman in the New York Times, 
this veganized breakfast pizza offers hearty flavors and a nice alternative to sweeter 
morning dishes.
Preparation/cooking time: 1 hour
Chilling time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
1⁄4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
11⁄2 cups unsweetened soymilk
11⁄2 cups water
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 cup cornmeal
1⁄2 cup diced onion
1⁄2 cup diced seitan
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound spinach, washed, stemmed, and dried
1 cup Tofu Cheese (see recipe in Chapter 13)
	 1	Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Lightly oil a springform or 9-inch cake or pie pan with 
1 tablespoon of the olive oil and line with a precut circle of parchment paper, set aside.
	 2	Prepare the polenta by combining the soymilk, water, and 1⁄2 teaspoon of salt in a 
medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat. Pour the 
cornmeal in a steady stream into the pot, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Turn 
the heat to low and simmer, whisking often, for 6 minutes, so the polenta is thick yet 
still pourable.
	 3	Stir 1 tablespoon of the olive oil into the cooked polenta, and then pour the polenta into 
the prepared springform pan. Spread to an even thickness and sprinkle with a pinch of 
salt and freshly ground pepper. Cover with a clean kitchen towel (not touching the 
polenta) and cool in the refrigerator until firm, at least 1 hour.
	 4	Remove the polenta from the refrigerator and bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes.
	 5	While the polenta is baking, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat in a 
large skillet or pot. Add the onion, seitan, garlic, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occa­
sionally until the onion is soft, about 8 minutes.
	 6	Add the spinach to the skillet and stir until the leaves are well wilted. Sprinkle with salt 
and pepper to taste.
	 7	Remove the polenta crust from the oven, sprinkle with the Tofu Cheese, and then 
spread the seitan and spinach mixture evenly on top. Drizzle with another tablespoon 
of the olive oil and return to the oven for 3 minutes.

     Better-Than-British Beans on Toast
Old school beans on toast often comes with ham-flavored beans, a side of sausage, and 
sometimes a slice of cheese melted on top. This new take on the old favorite offers tofu

and Earl Grey tea with agave and soymilk.

Quick Breads for a Fast Breakfast
Baking is therapy. It’s calming and comforting. In fact, baking the vegan quick 
breads (baked goods that don’t need yeast) that I introduce in this section 
is a pleasure. Fragrant and easy, quick breads can be sweet or savory and 
simple or complex in flavor.
Baking bread on your day off is a smart idea for preparing for your week 
ahead. These breads keep well for a few days, which can give you a few 
extra minutes of rest on work or school mornings. Simply bake on Sunday, 
enjoy a few pieces, and then store the remaining goodies in airtight contain­
ers or bags.
	
To save yourself time in the future, consider baking a double batch of these 
quick breads and freezing them. Muffins and scones can be frozen together 
in a freezer bag after they’ve cooled to room temperature. Breads such as 
banana bread can be cooled, sliced, and frozen as well. Simply remove individ­
ual muffins, scones, and slices and warm or toast when you’re ready to snack 
on them again.
Sharing these breads with friends and family is a sneaky and lovely way to 
introduce people to great vegan food. These breads also can be made to offer 
extra doses of nutritional support. Using whole-grain flour, ground flaxseeds, 
fruit puree, dried fruit, and sautéed vegetables is easy to do in loaves, scones, 
and muffins.

 Chapter 12: Breakfasts of Vegan Champions
	 1	Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
	 2	Prepare a muffin tin by lightly oiling each cup or placing an unbleached cupcake wrap­
per in each cup.
	 3	Bring the water to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the 
ground flaxseeds and whisk to dissolve any lumps. Simmer for 2 minutes and set aside.
	 4	Sift the flours, sugar, and baking powder into a large mixing bowl.
	 5	In a small mixing bowl, whisk the milk, oil, and salt until the salt is dissolved.
	 6	Whisk the flax mixture into the milk mixture until well combined. Add this wet mixture 
to the dry, flour mixture. Stir until just smooth, and then add the batter into the pre­
pared cups until 3⁄4 full.
	 7	Bake for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out 
clean. Remove from muffin pan and allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.
Vary It! Mix up the taste and texture of these muffins by adding 1⁄3 cup shredded zucchini, 
1⁄3 cup corn kernels, or 1⁄4 cup shredded apple.

   Cornbread Muffins
These muffins are delicious with vegan, trans fat–free margarine and blackberry jam — 
just ask my 2-year-old! The flaxseeds make the muffins rich in fiber, and the added soy, 
rice, or hemp milk can add extra nutrients and protein as well.
Preparation/cooking time: 30 minutes
Cooling time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 12 muffins
6 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds or flaxseed meal
1⁄2 cup whole-wheat flour

Chocolate Chip Banana Bread
Don’t we all need a little dessert for breakfast sometimes? This tasty bread is a great

	                    SOD Scones (Sun-dried Tomatoes, 
	
                 Onion, and Dill)
These savory scones are mouthwatering and great for a savory breakfast or served 
alongside soup for lunch or dinner.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Cooling time: 10 to 15 minutes
Yield: 8 scones
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup whole-wheat or spelt flour
1 cup unbleached white flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1⁄2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon dried dill
1⁄3 cup unsweetened, plain soy, rice, or hemp milk
1⁄2 cup water
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1⁄4 cup oil-cured sun-dried tomatoes, drained and 
chopped
	 1	Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and prepare a large cookie sheet by covering the 
bottom with parchment paper.
	 2	Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil and sauté the onion until 
mostly brown, about 10 minutes. Set aside.
	 3	In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, pepper, and dill. In a sepa­
rate medium mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, water, salt, canola oil, and apple 
cider vinegar.
	 4	Add the sautéed onions and sun-dried tomatoes to the milk mixture. Then add the milk 
mixture to the flour mixture. Stir until just combined (the dough should barely be hold­
ing together).
	 5	Gently pour the dough onto the prepared cookie sheet. Using your hands, lightly knead 
the dough to form an even, round loaf about 8 inches across.
	 6	Using a large knife, cut the dough into eighths, but don’t fully separate the slices. (Cutting 
the dough in this way makes the scones easier to cut completely once they’re baked.)
	 7	Bake for 15 minutes. Cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

Sides and Lighter Meals
In This Chapter
▶	Experimenting with homemade vegan condiments to liven 
up any meal
▶	Preparing side dish recipes to accompany a variety of main 
courses
▶	Making dining easy with one-dish meals
T
hinking and cooking small can make a big dif­
ference for your vegan kitchen. For instance, 
you can make your meals more exciting by mas­
tering a few homemade condiments. Tofu Sour 
Cream, Homemade Pickled Vegetables, and fresh 
salad dressings, like Carrot Ginger Dressing, can 
take a simple plate of beans and whole grains in a 
totally new direction. Find all three of these reci­
pes in this chapter.
Side dishes can make or break a meal as well; I know I’ve chosen certain 
meals from a menu just for the side dish! While a bunch of steamed veggies 
is nice, wouldn’t that homemade vegan lasagna be a little more exciting if it 
came with some creamy broccoli soup? Discovering a wide variety of healthy, 
tasty side dishes and lighter meals is simple and helps you feel like a budding 
gourmet.
After you discover the joys of creating your own condiments and side dishes, 
you can progress up the culinary ladder and start making simple, one-dish 
meals. Soups and salads, for example, can easily make a meal by themselves, 
and they also offer an opportunity for you to get creative: You can add 
almost anything to a salad, and soup can be made out of various bits and 
pieces from your refrigerator and cupboard. These dishes are healthy and 
delicious, and they’re easy to take to school or work.

Concocting Your Own Condiments
Making your own condiments, such as dips, cheeses, pickles, dressings, and 
spreads, allows you to create flavor combinations specific to your tastes. 
Vegan cheeses are available in many health food stores, but making your own 
gives you the ability to make it spicy, strong, or mellow tasting. All the con­
diments in this section have versatile uses and come in handy if you keep a 
nice selection in your refrigerator.
Dairy alternatives are easy to make at home, and the following recipes for 
Tofu Cheese and Tofu Sour Cream use simple techniques to get you started. 
And for you pickle lovers out there, rejoice! Did you know you can pickle 
almost any veggie or fruit? Use the Homemade Pickled Vegetables recipe to 
get your feet in the brine, and then branch out and start adding new spices or 
vinegars to explore the possibilities. You can impress your friends and family 
with a platter of homemade pickles at your next gathering.
	
Tofu Cheese
Cheese is often missed by new vegans; luckily the void can be filled with this recipe. 
This tofu dish is simple and tasty, and it comes with none of the negative attributes of 
cow’s milk. Spread this cheese on toasted bread or crackers, or crumble it on top of 
salads like you would feta cheese.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Chilling time: At least 8 hours
Yield: 4 servings
1 pound extra-firm tofu, drained
11⁄2 cups any color or flavor miso paste
	 1	Gently wrap the drained tofu in a clean kitchen towel and lightly squeeze out some of 
the remaining moisture.
	 2	Spread a 1⁄4-inch-thick layer of the miso on a dinner plate and place the tofu on top of it; 
be sure to make the layer large enough to accommodate the entire block of tofu. Spread 
the rest of the miso all over the tofu completely. Don’t leave any tofu visible, because it 
will spoil if left uncovered.

169
 Chapter 13: Sides and Lighter Meals
	 3	Cover the tofu with a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth, place in a sealable container, 
and set in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours and up to 3 days. The longer the tofu sits, 
the stronger the miso flavor will become.
	 4	When the tofu is ready, scrape off the miso. The tofu cheese can be crumbled on salads 
or vegan pizza, or sliced and eaten on crackers or toast. You can save the leftover miso 
for another use, such as for soup or dressings.
	 5	Gently rinse the tofu in cold water. Store any unused cheese in an airtight container for 
up to 2 days.

	                    Homemade Pickled Vegetables
Naturally fermented foods, including pickles, can help the body to digest heavy, fatty 
meals — and they’re delicious! Used in most ethnic cuisines, pickles add zest and 
texture variety to your menus.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Chilling time: 12 hours or overnight
Yield: 3 cups
2 cups water
2 tablespoons umeboshi vinegar

Filling Up with Some Sensational Sides
The side dishes in this section are so good that you may just want to make a 
meal of several of them. They’re versatile and pair well with countless main 
dishes. The seitan is an incredible base for numerous recipes, but it also can 
stand alone as a simple protein for making sandwiches or reheating for a 
quick snack. The rice balls can be eaten alone for a midday snack or laid on 
the table alongside homemade soups and casseroles. Kale chips serve as a 
lovely and healthy stand-in for the deep-fried potato version found in stores. 
Keep in mind that because you cook all these side dishes yourself, you can 
control the quality of the ingredients and the cooking techniques.
	
    Carrot Ginger Dressing
This dressing has a spicy kick paired with the natural sweetness of fresh carrots. 
Drizzle it on a simple green salad, or dress up your steamed veggies or cooked grains 
with a nice dollop. The dressing will keep fresh in your refrigerator for up to a week.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
1⁄2 pound carrots (about 3 medium carrots), grated
1⁄4 cup water
1⁄4 cup white rice vinegar
3 tablespoons peeled and minced fresh ginger
1 tablespoon naturally brewed soy sauce (tamari, 
shoyu, or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos)
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 shallot, chopped
1 tablespoon mirin (rice wine)
1⁄2 cup extra-virgin olive oil

     Homemade “Wheat Meat”
Seitan is a protein-rich, easy-to-flavor ingredient used in many vegan dishes. Making 
seitan at home saves you money and reduces plastic packaging waste. This useful ingre­
dient can be bought at the store, but once you start making it at home, you’ll feel 
empowered and prepared for many different dishes like soup, stew, sauces, and stir-fry. 
The kneading process can be fun and satisfying. It hearkens back to the days when our 
great-great-grandparents churned butter and made their bread from scratch. You can 
easily double this recipe — just use a really big bowl and pot!
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Cooking time: 11⁄2 to 21⁄2 hours
Yield: 4 servings
3 cups vital wheat gluten flour
1⁄2 cup nutritional yeast flakes
2 cups cold water
1⁄2 cup naturally brewed soy sauce (tamari, shoyu, 
or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos)
	 1	Place the vital wheat gluten flour and nutritional yeast flakes in a large mixing bowl and 
stir well with a whisk to combine.
	 2	While stirring with a wooden spoon, gradually pour the cold water and soy sauce into 
the flour to form a stiff, but not too sticky, dough that can be kneaded.
	 3	Knead the dough for about 5 minutes to develop the gluten. The dough will become 
elastic. (See Figure 13-1 for instructions on kneading dough.)
	 4	When the dough is finished, set it aside and prepare the simmering stock (as shown in 
the following recipe).
Simmering stock
8 cups water
1 cup naturally brewed soy sauce (tamari, shoyu, 
or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos)
5 quarter-sized slices of ginger
5 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
1 bay leaf
5 inches kombu
	 1	In a large pot, combine the water, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, bay leaf, and kombu.
	 2	Pull pieces of the seitan dough (see preceding recipe) into small billiard-size balls. Drop 
the pieces into the cold liquid, one at a time, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
	 3	Bring the stock to a boil, lower to a simmer, and then cover and cook for 1 to 11⁄2 hours, 
depending on the size of the pieces.
	 4	Allow the seitan to cool to room temperature in the broth and store it in the refrigerator 
in an airtight container, submerged in the broth.
Seitan

173
 Chapter 13: Sides and Lighter Meals
Tip: You can buy your own seitan at most health food stores in the refrigerator section near 
the tofu. Some are teriyaki flavored or cut into strips for immediate stir-fry use.
Vary It! Seitan can be flavored to your liking. Instead of the traditional ginger and garlic 
marinade, try premade, vegan “no-chicken” broth. An Italian blend of herbs can include 
garlic, red wine, onion flakes, rosemary, marjoram, fennel seeds, and red pepper flakes.

Kale Chips
Crunchy, salty, and satisfying, these chips replace the deep-fried potato version in 
many vegan homes. Eating a leafy green vegetable while getting your chip fix is a pretty 
amazing feat. Kids and adults alike love these little crunchy morsels, so you may need 
to buy a few heads of kale each week. Never thought you’d do that, did you?
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 7 to 11 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 bunch of curly kale, washed, dried, destemmed, 
and torn into 2-inch pieces
2 teaspoons nutritional yeast flakes
	 1	Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
	 2	Mix the olive oil, vinegar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Toss the kale in the 
liquid mixture.
	 3	Put the kale on a baking sheet, sprinkle with nutritional yeast. Bake for 5 to 8 minutes, 
or until the kale starts to brown. Keep an eye on the kale, because it can burn quickly.
	 4	After the one side starts to brown, toss the kale with tongs on the baking sheet and 
bake with the other side up for another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the chips from the 
baking sheet and enjoy!
Tip: Nutritional yeast adds a rich, cheesy taste and protein to dishes. Enriched flakes also 
add vitamin B12 and zinc! Find it in shakers in the condiment aisle or in the bulk bins at 
your health food store.

	 2	As the potatoes cook, warm the soymilk over low heat with the bay leaves. Heat until 
the milk just comes to a simmer, and then remove from the heat and set aside.
	 3	After the potatoes are cooked, reserve a cup of the cooking water in case you need to 
moisten the mashed potatoes. Drain the remaining water.
	 4	Place the cooked potatoes in a large mixing bowl. Remove the bay leaves from the soy­
milk and pour over the potatoes. Add the Earth Balance spread or olive oil. Mash the 
mixture with a potato masher or large fork until well mashed. Serve with Mushroom 
Gravy (see the following recipe).
	 1	Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
	 2	Toss the sliced mushrooms with the teaspoon olive oil, salt, and garlic in a small bowl. 
Spread the mushrooms on a baking sheet in a single layer and roast for 15 minutes.
	 3	Heat the vegetable stock in a small saucepan until simmering, and then remove from 
the heat.
	 4	Heat the 1⁄4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil in a medium saucepan over low heat. Whisk in the 
brown rice flour and stir constantly for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the mixture begins to brown.
	 5	Whisk in the hot vegetable stock slowly, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add the soy 
sauce and whisk until smooth. Add the mushrooms and stir well to combine. Cook for 
another 10 minutes over low heat. Serve the hot gravy over mashed potatoes (see pre­
ceding recipe).
Vary It! Mix up the flavor of the gravy with different broths like no-chicken, no-beef, or 
onion stock.

Rice Balls 
	
with Sesame Salt
Easy to make and fun to roll, these little whole-grain gems are great snack food; they 
have protein, complex carbohydrates, and a bit of healthy fat as well. Kids love to help 
make these balls in the kitchen — even a 2-year-old can roll the rice ball around in the 
salted sesame seeds. Sesame salt, which is also called gomasio, is a staple in macrobi­
otic food. Make an extra batch and keep it in a salt shaker at the table. When you sprin­
kle sesame salt on food instead of regular salt, you get the added benefit of a little more 
protein and calcium from the seeds.

177
 Chapter 13: Sides and Lighter Meals
Preparation/cooking time: 2 hours
Yield: 12 to 15 rice balls / 1 cup sesame salt
Rice Balls
3⁄4 cup short-grain brown rice
1⁄4 cup white rice
2 cups water
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
	 1	In a medium saucepan, mix together the water and brown and white rice. Add 1⁄2 tea­
spoon salt and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, and then lower the heat to 
a simmer.
	 2	Cook the rice until all the water evaporates, about 50 minutes. Do not stir the rice until 
the water has evaporated.
	 3	Allow the rice to cool to room temperature before making rice balls.
	 4	Scoop about 1⁄3 cup of the cooked rice into water-moistened hands and pack it into a 
small ball.
	 5	Roll the ball in Sesame Salt (see the following recipe), covering all sides. Keep rolling 
balls until you’re out of rice. Rice balls keep refrigerated in a well-sealed container for 3 
days. Try serving on top of tossed salad greens.
Sesame Salt
1 cup unhulled brown sesame seeds
1 teaspoon salt
	 1	Rinse the sesame seeds and drain through a fine strainer. Place the seeds in a skillet 
over medium heat. Toast the seeds, stirring often, until they begin to give off a toasty 
aroma, about 3 or 4 minutes.
	 2	Place the toasted seeds and salt in a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind until 
well combined and the seeds are starting to break down. This condiment can be refrig­
erated in a sealed container for a week and used in place of salt on salads, soup, and air-
popped popcorn.
Tip: If you’re short on time, try using precooked rice, which cuts the time in half.

Whipping Up Soup and Salad Sensations
Soups and salads offer opportunities to combine all the best flavor profiles 
together. Soups run the gamut: Thick, thin, chunky, or smooth and creamy. 
Soups can help you use up all the leftover grains, beans, and veggies that 
are hanging around your fridge, or they can allow you to combine just a 
few choice ingredients to suit your tastes. Similarly, one salad can contain 
crunchy, raw, roasted, sweet, and peppery veggies and be topped with 
a creamy and savory dressing. In this section, I help get your taste buds 
moving with a creamy soup recipe and a tangy, protein-filled salad recipe.
	
Greek Lentil Salad
This veggie and lentil salad is fresh and protein-rich. The crumbled Tofu Cheese (see 
the recipe earlier in this chapter) adds a nice tangy, creamy bite. Because this salad 
tastes so good the next day, it can be made a day ahead and chilled for a picnic or 
summer dinner party.
Preparation/cooking time: 55 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
1 cup green lentils
1⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
11⁄2 teaspoons salt
1⁄2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
1 medium tomato, seeded and diced (see Figure 
13-4 for instruction)
1⁄2 cup seeded and diced cucumber (see Figure 13-5 
for instruction)
1⁄4 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh oregano
1 recipe Tofu Cheese (recipe included earlier in 
this chapter)
	 1	Pour the lentils on a white plate, pale counter top, or cutting board. Remove any broken 
lentils, pebbles, or twigs. Rinse in two changes of water and drain.
	 2	Place the lentils in a medium saucepan with 21⁄2 cups of water and bring to a boil over 
medium-high heat.
	 3	Lower the heat to a simmer and cover. Cook for 35 to 40 minutes or until the lentils are 
tender. Pour into a large bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.

179
 Chapter 13: Sides and Lighter Meals
	 4	In a medium mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Whisk 
well. Add the remaining ingredients, except the Tofu Cheese, and toss. Add to the 
cooked lentils and toss well.
	 5	Crumble the Tofu Cheese with your hands over the lentil salad and gently toss.
	 6	Allow the flavors to marry in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. The salad can be 
refrigerated for up to 2 days.

    Creamy Broccoli (or Spinach) Soup
People are always asking me how they can give up dairy without missing that creamy, 
satisfying taste and texture. Believe it or not, you can still indulge in creamy textured 
foods — you just have to do it the vegan way. This recipe, for example, is smooth, full of 
veggie goodness, and easy and delicious.
Preparation/cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
8 cups low-sodium vegetable stock
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
3 ribs celery, diced
1 medium yellow onion, diced
3 heads of broccoli or 3 bunches of spinach, cut 
into small pieces
3 cups plain, unsweetened soymilk
1 container soft or silken tofu, drained
1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne powder
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Salt to taste
	 1	Add the vegetable stock to a large saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.
	 2	Meanwhile, add the oil to a skillet heated over medium-high heat. Add the celery and 
onion and sauté with a pinch of salt until they start to turn a bit translucent, about 5 
minutes.
	 3	When the vegetable stock comes to a boil, add the broccoli and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, 
or until it turns bright green.
	 4	Add the celery and onion mixture to the pot of broccoli. Turn off the heat and add the 
soymilk.
	 5	Place the tofu in a medium mixing bowl. Mush the tofu through your fingers to break it 
up. Add the tofu, cayenne pepper, and black pepper to the pot with the broccoli.
	 6	Blend the soup using either an immersion blender or a countertop blender. If using a 
standing blender, blend the soup in small batches, 2 cups at a time. Cover the blender 
lid with a kitchen towel to prevent any hot liquid from flying out. After each batch is 
blended, pour it into a separate mixing bowl until the entire pot is empty. Return the 
soup to the saucepan.
	 7	Taste the soup and add more seasoning, if desired, but be sure to blend again or stir 
really well to combine if you do season further.

bread, fried potatoes, and heavy dairy cream 
sauces alongside hefty doses of high-fructose 
corn syrup and processed chemicals. You aren’t 
the average American, however, and your body 
will thank you for your healthier diet in the 
coming years.
Instead of dining out, you can dine in and eat rich, sustaining meals of whole 
grains, beans, and vegetables in countless combinations that will satisfy any 
craving. Vegan food is delicious and fortifying. Building your meals around 
main dishes that offer a balance of healthy cooking techniques and high-quality 
ingredients is a good first step on the path of a long and vigorous life.
The main course recipes in this chapter offer something for every palate. 
Ethnic spice combinations can take the same basic bean and grain ingre­
dients around the world. You can bake, sauté, blend, boil, or combine veg­
etables and tofu with pasta to fill the gap left when you decided to leave dairy 
and meat behind.

Use your mealtimes wisely to choose the kind of energy you want to create in 
your life. You are what you eat: Your food goes into your stomach and 
becomes the building blocks of your tissues, muscles, bones, and thoughts. 
Rest easy knowing that you can choose delicious, nourishing recipes that help 
you create an amazing life. Did you know that food could do so much for you? 
It’s part of the reason that many of us become vegan: We know that what we 
eat matters!
Oh Boy! Burgers and Burritos
Putting protein between two pieces of bread or wrapping it in a tortilla can 
be wonderfully satisfying. The recipes for the hand-held foods in this section 
offer an easy, one-dish way to create a sensible meal. With protein, complex 
carbohydrates from grains and whole-grain bread, veggies, and spices, burg­
ers and burritos can be a healthy lunch or dinner. You can easily make larger 
batches of these recipes for gatherings, or you can scale down the amounts 
for solo eating. Kids will be thrilled about a fun food that their parents are 
happy to serve.
	
Seitan Burritos
These filling burritos are easy to make, and they’re handy for casual gatherings. 
Providing lots of quality protein and veggie goodness, this dish can fortify a bunch of 
vegans on Super Bowl Sunday or before a big hike. For an even easier preparation, set 
out a variety of toppings on the counter and let your guests make their own burritos.
Preparation/cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 10 servings
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
2 green onions, chopped (use both green 
and white parts)

Baked Black Bean Burgers
Burgers are good — and vegan bean burgers are the best! You can serve them alongside 
traditional burger toppings to your loved ones for a fun Friday night dinner or a summer 
outdoor get-together. You also can make a double batch and freeze the individual patties 
before baking them. Simply thaw the individual patties in the fridge overnight and bake 
them fresh later.
Preparation/cooking time: 25 minutes
Chilling time: 1 hour
Yield: 12 patties
1 tablespoon organic olive oil
1⁄4 cup diced yellow onion
1⁄4 cup diced green pepper
1 celery rib, diced
One 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon paprika
Pinch of cayenne pepper
Salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon hot sauce
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons flour
12 whole-grain hamburger buns
Traditional burger toppings, such as lettuce, onion 
slices, tomato slices, and pickles (optional)
	 1	Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Sauté the onion, green pepper, and celery for 
5 to 7 minutes, or until softened. Remove from heat.
	 2	Place the beans in a food processor along with the onion mixture. Pulse the mixture 8 
times, being sure to chop the beans well. However, don’t process the mixture too smooth.
	 3	Place the bean mixture in a bowl and add spices, hot sauce, and parsley. Mix well and 
add salt and pepper to taste. Add flour and mix well. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 
at least 1 hour.
	 4	While the mixture chills in the refrigerator, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
	 5	Form the chilled mixture into 12 evenly sized patties with slightly wet hands. The pat­
ties are delicate, so move them around with a spatula. Bake on a cookie sheet lined with 
parchment paper for 15 minutes.
	 6	Remove from the oven with a spatula and allow to cool slightly before removing from 
cookie sheet. Serve on whole-grain buns, and, if desired, top with lettuce, onion slices, 
tomato slices, and pickles.

3 tablespoons organic olive oil
1⁄2 cup diced yellow onion
1 cup thinly sliced button mushrooms

Comforting Noodles and Pasta
Noodles and pasta have gotten a bad reputation in recent years. The popular­
ity of high-protein diets have pushed these dishes aside and labeled them as 
unhealthy. In reality, however, countless varieties of healthy noodles offer 
complex carbohydrates, fiber, and protein, while still being a cheap and tasty 
menu item.
You have countless types of pasta and noodles to choose from, including 
rice, gluten-free, whole-wheat, spelt, mung bean, and even Jerusalem arti­
choke flour noodles. Pasta lends itself well to any combination of sautéed 
vegetables, simple olives and olive oil, chopped herbs, or rich sauces.

187
 Chapter 14: Main Course Recipes
Keeping several types of pasta on hand ensures that you can save money and 
time by cooking fresh, quick meals at home instead of ordering in or taking 
out. Store pasta in airtight containers away from light and heat in a cupboard 
or pantry.
	
Check the ingredients when buying pasta. Some types are made with eggs, and 
some frozen varieties like stuffed ravioli often contain cheese. You can find 
good vegan versions in many health food stores.
Pasta and noodles are the ultimate comfort food for many of us. You don’t 
have to give up those yummy, easy-to-prepare dishes after you go vegan, how­
ever. Even gluten-intolerant vegans can enjoy pasta and lasagna with the great 
rice-based noodles now available. The following recipes cover a variety of fla­
vors and work well for large or small groups. They make great leftovers, too.
	
Tofu Pad Thai
Pad Thai is normally served with scrambled eggs and sometimes chicken, shrimp, or 
pork. This recipe uses only tofu, which gives the dish a nice protein profile, and brings 
it close to the original while still being vegan. This spicy noodle dish has lots of veggies 
and the flavors enliven your palette and warm you up quickly. While great fresh out of 
the pot, Tofu Pad Thai is also tasty served cold for picnics or as a party salad.
Preparation/cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Fried Tofu
1 package extra-firm tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes
6 tablespoons unrefined coconut oil
2 tablespoons agave or brown rice syrup
2 tablespoons naturally brewed soy sauce 
(tamari, shoyu, or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos)
1 teaspoon cayenne powder
	 1	Remove the excess moisture from the tofu by laying the tofu cubes between two clean 
kitchen towels and gently pressing down.
	 2	Whisk the oil, syrup, soy sauce, and cayenne powder together in a small mixing bowl. 
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the oil mixture. Allow to heat for 1 minute.
	 3	Fry the tofu slices in the hot oil for about 2 minutes on one side, and then turn over and 
fry for 1 minute more. Be aware that the tofu may splatter in the oil even if it’s patted 
dry. Transfer to a plate lined with clean paper towels to drain and set aside.

Noodles with Seitan 
	
and Shiitake Mushrooms
This lovely noodle dish tastes fancy, but it’s surprisingly easy to prepare. The shiitake 
mushrooms and seitan provide a very meaty texture (for those who crave nonvegan 
meats) while the mirin gives a sophisticated aroma and taste.
Preparation/cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 ounces dry elbow-style pasta
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1⁄4 cup minced shallots (about 3 shallots)
16 shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced
1 teaspoon naturally brewed soy sauce 
(tamari, shoyu, or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos)
8 ounces seitan, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1⁄4 cup mirin cooking wine or other white wine
	 1	Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain and set aside.
	 2	Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté the shallots and mushrooms with 
the soy sauce for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the mushrooms start to give up their moisture.
	 3	Add the seitan and thyme to the mushroom mixture in the skillet and stir well. Cook for 
another 6 to 8 minutes, or until the seitan is warmed through.
	 4	Stir in the wine and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes. Then add the drained, cooked pasta 
to the mushroom mixture and stir well to combine.

has its own special version. After all, there must be thousands of curry 
powders in India alone! Culturally inspired recipes bring in new flavors and 
health benefits with different herbs and spices and introduce new vegetables. 
Curries have been studied for their anti-inflammatory ingredients, and the 
fermented soy in miso has been used to help treat radiation sickness.

2 cups cooked brown rice or other whole grain
2 teaspoons naturally brewed soy sauce 
(tamari, shoyu, or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos)
3 tablespoons any flavor miso paste
1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
2 green onions, sliced, for garnish
	 1	Heat a large saucepan or soup pot over medium heat. Add the oil and onion and sauté 
for 5 minutes, or until the onion begins to turn translucent.
	 2	Add the garlic, carrot, celery, tofu, and hijiki. Pour in the stock and water and bring to a 
simmer. Add the rice and soy sauce. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.
	 3	Meanwhile, add the miso paste to a few tablespoons of water in a small mixing bowl. 
Whisk to combine, and then add just enough water that the miso is smooth and 
pourable.
	 4	Move the soup off the heat and stir in the ginger. After the simmering has stopped, add 
the miso and stir well. Sprinkle with the green onions. (Never boil miso soup after the 
miso is added. Doing so will destroy the healing benefits of the living enzymes.)
Tip: When ordering miso soup or stew in restaurants, be sure to ask whether it’s vegetarian — 
most sushi and Japanese restaurants add bonito dried fish flakes.

Cauliflower Chickpea Curry
This curry has so much flavor, so much protein, and so many veggies — and it’s so 
great for leftovers. What’s not to love? Don’t let the list of ingredients scare you. You’ll 
use the spices over and over again, so they’re a good investment.
Preparation/cooking time: 40 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
3 tablespoons unrefined coconut or canola oil
2 teaspoons whole mustard seeds
1 large yellow onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon plus 1⁄2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon ginger, 
grated or minced
3 teaspoons curry powder
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic powder
3 teaspoons cumin seeds
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1⁄8 teaspoon ground cloves
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon asafetida (sometimes called “hing”)
2 green cardamom pods
One 24-ounce can diced tomatoes, undrained
8 cups rinsed, stemmed, and lightly chopped 
fresh spinach
2 cups cooked and drained chickpeas or a 
15-ounce can, drained
2 cups cauliflower, chopped into small florets
	 1	Preheat a large saucepan or soup pot over medium heat. Pour in the oil, and then add 
the mustard seeds. Stir and heat until the seeds start popping.
	 2	Add the onion and sauté for 8 minutes, or until the onion begins to brown. Add the garlic, 
1 teaspoon of salt, and the ginger. Stir well to combine and cook for another 3 minutes.
	 3	Add the curry powder, garlic powder, cumin seeds, coriander, cloves, cinnamon, asafet­
ida, and cardamom pods. Stir in the whole can of tomatoes and juice, and then bring the 
mixture to a simmer.
	 4	Add the spinach in large handfuls and stir into the mixture until the leaves begin to wilt 
down. Add more as space allows, if desired. When all the spinach is wilted down, add the 
chickpeas and cauliflower to the pot. Add the remaining 1⁄2 teaspoon of salt and stir well.
	 5	Cover and cook for another 20 minutes over low heat. Remove the cardamom pods and

Beans and Rice Are Nice
Living on minimum wage for an episode of FX Network’s series 30 Days 
reminded me of the numerous benefits of bean and grain combinations. First, 
they’re cheap. Even organic rice and beans, when bought dry in bulk, cost 
pennies per serving. Second, they’re versatile. You can take lentils and millet 
and make them into diverse ethnic dishes with a few herb and spice tricks. 
Consider the following combinations:
	
✓	Indian lentils and millet: Add curry powder and a can of coconut milk.
	
✓	Italian lentils and millet: Combine the lentils and millet with canned 
tomatoes, rosemary, and oregano.
	
✓	Mexican lentils and millet: Mix the millet with a scoop of salsa, toss the 
lentils with cilantro and lime juice, and dice up some avocado for the top.
Last, but not least, beans and whole grains offer superior nutrition, with pro­
tein, complex carbohydrates, minerals, and fiber.
The following recipes are instant classics because they’re easy to make, deli­
cious, and come in handy for lunch the next day. Stocked with veggies, these 
hearty bean dishes can be served alone or with a simple side salad. You can 
use these dishes to warm your bones in the winter or give you the energy 
you need for big days in the active summer months.

	 1	Place the beans in a large bowl and add enough water to cover them by 2 inches. Let 
the beans soak overnight or for at least 8 hours.
	 2	Drain and rinse the soaked beans and add to a large heavy pot with the 6 cups of water 
or stock and the bay leaves. Bring to a boil, lower heat to a simmer, and continue to 
cook partially covered.
	 3	While the beans are cooking, heat a cast-iron skillet or other large, heavy skillet over 
medium heat and add the oil. Sauté the onion, celery, carrot, and garlic with the soy 
sauce until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the roasted bell pep­
pers, cayenne, and red pepper flakes to the onion mixture, stir, and cook for another 5 
minutes.
	 4	Add the onion mixture to the cooking beans. Bring the beans back up to a boil, reduce 
to a simmer, and cover. Cook for 1 hour, or until beans are soft. While the beans are 
cooking, soak the rice in water for 1 hour and then drain.
	 5	Add the salt, pepper, hot sauce, and drained brown rice to the beans. Add another 1 to 
2 cups of water or stock to ensure that you have enough cooking liquid.
	 6	Bring the whole pot back to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, covered, for another 
45 minutes. Check the pot a few times to ensure you have enough cooking liquid. Add 
more water or stock as necessary until the rice is cooked through. Serve hot with Tofu 
Sour Cream.

	                     Beanie Broccoli over Polenta
My 2-year-old son was the first to test this dish. He loves it, and so as a mom, I’m 
thrilled! After all, what could be better than to feed your family something that’s filling, 
simple, and versatile? The dish can be modified in a number of ways. Try using a variety 
of beans, greens, and whole grains to mix it up.
Preparation/cooking time: 45 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
5 cups filtered water
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1 cup organic yellow corn grits
1⁄2 cup diced red onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 cups cooked and drained pinto beans, 
or a 15-ounce can, drained and rinsed
4 cups broccoli florets
1 cup low-sodium vegetable stock
	 1	Lightly oil a 13- x-9-inch baking dish with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and set aside.
	 2	Set a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the water and then whisk 1⁄2 teaspoon of 
the salt, 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and the corn grits together. Whisk constantly to 
avoid lumps, cooking until it comes to a rolling boil.
	 3	Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, for 30 minutes.
	 4	Remove the cooked polenta from the heat and pour it into the oiled baking dish. Cover 
with a kitchen towel and set aside while you prepare the vegetables.
	 5	Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to 
the skillet and sauté the onion for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and the remaining 1⁄2 tea­
spoon of the salt and sauté for 1 minute more.
	 6	Add the red pepper flakes and stir well. Then add the beans and broccoli and stir well 
to combine. Pour the vegetable stock into the skillet and cook covered for 5 minutes. 
Remove the lid and cook until the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes more.
	 7	To serve, spoon the polenta into individual bowls and cover with large scoops of beans 
and broccoli. Serve hot.

▶	Trying some fruit-based vegan desserts
▶	Savoring some old favorites with a vegan twist
I
’ve been saving the best for last: Here’s the 
scoop on vegan desserts — they’re amazing! 
Entire cookbooks have been devoted to decadent, 
sweet, yummy vegan treats, so this chapter offers 
just a sampling of what’s possible. You don’t 
have to leave the realm of healthy food to enjoy 
desserts; you can combine great taste and good 
nutrition. Fruits, nuts, seeds, healthier sweeten­
ers, and quality ingredients are important to the 
taste and nutrition of these dishes. Make dessert 
a healthy indulgence by discovering how to create creamy, rich, dense, or 
flaky concoctions without eggs or dairy.
A good dessert offers a variety of flavors and notes to liven up your taste 
buds. A little salt can make the flavors pop in either a fruit or chocolate des­
sert. For moist textures in cakes and pastries, fat must be used. So without 
the conventional aid of eggs, cream, or butter, you need to use vegan marga­
rine or vegetable oils, such as olive, canola, or unrefined coconut, to create 
these vegan desserts.
When choosing flour for your baked desserts, try whole-wheat pastry flour. 
It’s finely ground and bakes into a light, soft texture while still offering more 
nutrition than white flour. You also can use unbleached white flour instead of 
conventional bleached white flour. The bleaching process uses harsh chemi­
cals and removes the nutrition from the flour.
	
I’ve had great success working out new, vegan recipes by removing the eggs, 
butter, and milk from traditional recipes. If you have an old recipe for cake or 
cookies that you love, try your hand at veganizing it by replacing the dairy 
products with vegan ingredients. See Chapter 10 for information about vegan 
substitutions that will keep Mom’s apple pie on the vegan table.

Whipping Up Some Vegan Cookies, 
Brownies, and Bars
Nothing is more satisfying than baking a dense and moist dessert and eating 
it with your hands. That’s why cookies and bars appeal to the kid inside all of 
us; using your fingers instead of forks to eat dessert brings it to another level 
of intimacy and basic enjoyment.
Even though they’re loaded with chocolate, these recipes offer greater nutri­
tion than more conventional recipes. The techniques are likely familiar to 
anyone who has baked cookies before, so take pleasure in a no-fail, sure-to-
please cooking adventure.
	
   Pepper Chip Cookies
This recipe is a nice spin on the old favorite: chocolate chip cookies. These morsels 
offer a savory hint of black pepper and soy sauce — in a good way! If you take these 
cookies to a party, everyone who tries them will have a new perspective on what a 
vegan eats and will want to try more.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Baking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 dozen cookies
2 cups flour (unbleached white, wheat, or spelt)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄4 teaspoon naturally brewed soy sauce (tamari, 
shoyu, or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos)
11⁄4 cup rapadura sugar
3⁄4 cup vegan margarine, softened
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1⁄3 cup soft tofu
3⁄4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup vegan chocolate chips
	 1	Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
	 2	In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour and baking soda, and then set aside.
	 3	Using a food processor, blend together the soy sauce, sugar, margarine, vanilla extract, 
tofu, and black pepper until smooth.
	 4	Add the soy sauce mixture and the chocolate chips to the flour mixture and stir until 
combined.

     Chocolate Chick Blondies
These gluten-free bars are dense and full of nutrition. The chickpeas (also known as gar­
banzo beans) offer substantial protein and replace the flour normally found in dessert

Tasting the Vegan Fruit
Fruit-based desserts can be delicate and light or sophisticated and full of 
complex flavors. Something as simple as a bowl of fresh berries with a scoop 
of vegan ice cream can end a fantastic summer meal. Winter fruits lend their 
heavily spiced sweetness to long baking techniques, which make them fortify­
ing, cozy desserts that are appropriate for the darker months. This seasonal­
ity should be relished when choosing fruit desserts. Try using peaches at the 
height of their ripeness from the farmer’s market for a cobbler, or pick some­
thing fresh from your garden to add to a fruit pudding.
	
    Lime in the Coconut Ice
Beat the heat with this fruit ice! It won’t be green unless you add food coloring (and 
because some food dyes are derived from insects, I say skip ’em!). Despite its lack of 
color, however, it’s amazingly refreshing and deliciously limey — perfect for an ending 
to a summer meal or as a palate cleanser between courses of a fancier, sit-down meal.
Preparation time: 8 minutes
Chilling time: 2 hours
Freezing time: 20 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
11⁄2 cups agave or brown rice syrup
1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
4 cups unsweetened coconut milk
1 teaspoon grated lime peel
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
	 1	Slowly heat the agave and lime juice in a medium saucepan over low heat. Whisk often 
to combine.
	 2	In a large mixing bowl, combine the agave-lime mixture with the remaining ingredients 
and stir well.
	 3	Cover and allow to cool in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
	 4	Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s directions for a sorbet 
recipe, approximately 20 minutes.

Fruit Kanten
What the heck is Kanten, you may ask? Well, it’s actually a pudding made from agar. 
What the heck is agar? Well, agar is a sea vegetable and Mother Nature’s gift to vegans. 
This natural plant food is a vegan’s answer to gelatin. These clear flakes are used as a 
gelling agent in culture media (remember your experiments in biology and chemistry 
class?) and delicious desserts. Find more info about vegan gelatin alternatives in 
Chapter 10.
Try seasonal combinations of juice and fruit to use your farmer’s market or backyard 
bounty. Apple juice and chunks of pear, pear juice with cherries, or peach juice with 
melon balls are winning combinations. This type of dessert will look a little cloudy, not 
clear like old-school Jell-O, but it will be delicious!
Preparation/cooking time: 15 minutes
Chilling time: 11⁄2 hours
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
4 cups fruit juice (apple, grape, cherry, or 
a combination of any 2)
5 tablespoons agar flakes
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 cup diced fruit (apples, grapes, blueberries, 
cherries, or a combination)
	 1	Place all the ingredients in a medium saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil, 
uncovered.
	 2	Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, 
until the agar flakes have dissolved.
	 3	Pour the mixture into individual bowls, wine glasses, or a shallow serving dish and 
refrigerate until gelled, about 11⁄2 hours. Spoon out or slice to serve.
Tip: Agar is also a great natural laxative, so if you’re feeling “stuck,” make some Kanten. 
Cherry or apple Kanten gives you a double whammy!

                  Summer Smoothie-sicles
Kids and adults alike love popsicles. So why not make them a little healthier and more 
substantial than what the ice cream truck guy has to offer? You can take this simple 
recipe and add all kinds of healthy secrets: liquid chlorophyll, dehydrated greens pow­
ders, or even ground nuts and flaxseeds. Go crazy! One caveat: Don’t try to use citrus 
juices in this recipe — they don’t work well.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Freezing time: 6 hours
Yield: 6 to 10 servings, depending on the size of your popsicle molds
2 cups fruit juice (except citrus juices)
1 cup soy yogurt
2 tablespoons agave syrup or brown rice syrup
1⁄4 cup fresh green juice from kale 
or broccoli (optional)
	 1	Blend all the ingredients together, including green juice, if desired, until creamy and 
smooth.
	 2	Pour into popsicle molds.
	 3	Freeze for at least 6 hours and then serve.
Tip: Run the mold under cool water once the popsicles are completely frozen. This will 
help loosen your treats and make them easier to remove.
Vary It! If you have any leftover mashed sweet potatoes, dregs of almond butter in a jar, 
or a handful of cashews waiting to be eaten, throw them in when blending the ingredients 
together too!

Everything Old Is New Again
The recipes in this section are my vegan takes on old favorites. These recipes 
provide a good learning opportunity for anyone who’s worried about con­
verting their old dairy and meat recipes to vegan ones. Candy, cakes, shakes, 
and baked goods can be made vegan and still taste delicious.
	
Baking and candy making require more precision than other types of cooking, 
because they involve more chemistry than average cooking. So, when learning 
how to bake, freeze, and cook vegan desserts, be patient with the process and 
with yourself. Use vegan recipes to get acquainted with the techniques and 
ingredients; and if a recipe doesn’t work out as planned, just let it roll off your 
back. Nine times out of ten it still tastes good, even if it doesn’t look like the 
picture in your mind.
	                   Chocolate Peanut Butter Bombs
A simple take on the old favorite chocolate peanut butter cups from childhood, these 
delicious morsels will win over any crowd. They also can be made using almond or 
cashew butter, if desired.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Chilling time: 4 hours
Yield: 12 to 15 servings
1 cup vegan chocolate chips
1⁄2 cup chunky peanut butter
1⁄3 cup agave or brown rice syrup
1⁄2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
	 1	Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly 
with a heat-safe spatula until completely smooth and melted.
	 2	Set 12 to 15 mini paper and foil muffin cups on a cookie sheet.
	 3	Pour the mixture in small spoonfuls into the muffin cups, filling them to the brim.
	 4	Refrigerate the filled cups for at least 4 hours, or until completely set and firm.
Tip: To help the muffin cups retain their shape, you can set the empty cups in a mini-muffin 
tin and then fill them. Set the entire tin in the refrigerator to set.

Silk Shake
Shakes are hard to beat when you’re looking for a rich, smooth, and easy dessert. The 
frozen banana is a key ingredient — room-temperature fruit just won’t create the same 
creamy texture. When summer arrives, I like to keep several peeled bananas waiting in 
the freezer at all times for when the mood strikes for this tasty treat.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 cup cashews
1 banana, peel removed and frozen
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
3 Medjool dates, pits removed and chopped
3⁄4 cup vanilla rice, soy, or hemp milk
1 tablespoon agave, maple, or brown rice syrup
Pinch of salt
2 cups ice
	 1	Combine all the ingredients except the ice in a sturdy blender. Blend until the whole 
mixture is smooth and well combined.
	 2	Add the ice and continue blending until smooth. Pour into tall glasses and serve.
Vary It!: To vary this shake, you can skip the cocoa powder and add more nutritional 
power by throwing in 1⁄2 cup frozen raspberries or pitted cherries. You also can add 1⁄4 cup 
peanut butter or almond butter to the original recipe for a rich treat.

E
ating vegan meals at home is easy once you get the 
hang of some new recipes. Venturing outside the 
house to eat can be more of a challenge, however. It’s 
important to stick to your convictions, but you also want 
to be a gracious guest and not alienate those who haven’t 
seen the vegan light yet.
The chapters in this part offer practical tips on how to 
have a social life in a nonvegan world. Whether you’re 
going to a wedding, cocktail party, or conference, travel­
ing abroad, or driving across the country, you can make 
any situation work for you and your vegan lifestyle.

In This Chapter
▶	Providing variety to your vegan diet
▶	Living in harmony with your nonvegan friends and loved ones
▶	Connecting your veganism to mind, body, spirit, and earth
S
ome people become vegan because their health problems can be healed 
with a plant-based diet. Others focus on veganism as a path to spiritual 
health and enlightenment. Still other vegans love and respect the lives of 
nonhuman animals and refuse to participate in their enslavement and deaths, 
or they just don’t like the taste and texture of animal foods. People have so 
many reasons for living a vegan life, and the resulting benefits to your health 
and well-being are positive.
You may feel the temptation to start talking about your own vegan experi­
ence with the people around you, especially when you have been profoundly 
affected by specific vegan-related knowledge that has changed your own life. 
Veganism becomes religion. You have seen the light! Sharing yourself authen­
tically with people is important, but you don’t want to alienate loved ones or 
live too single-mindedly.
A big part of this new lifestyle is incorporating different ingredients and cre­
ating a fresh perspective that includes like-minded people and your current 
friends and family. If, like me, you find that your new vegan diet and lifestyle 
are exciting and easy, you’ll always be looking for ways to widen your food 
experiences. Sometimes, however, new and old vegans alike can get stuck 
in a rut of the same old food choices. They may have lost the zest for vegan 
living or feel tired of explaining their choice in diet to nonvegans. But don’t 
worry; this chapter can help focus your intentions for a whole, vegan life 
and offer you support in speaking and living in the world with gentle love for 
everyone — including meat eaters!

Encouraging and Enjoying 
Variety in Your Diet
Some experts estimate that most Americans eat the same ten fruits and veg­
etables for most of their lives (and that’s if they eat fruits and vegetables at 
all). Think of it this way: A narrow diet can lead to limited energy and life 
experiences. If you want a full life, enriched by a wide array of adventures, 
your diet must include a diversity of flavors, colors, and textures. Include a 
variety of seasonal and local plant foods in your menus, and share these new 
discoveries with your loved ones. Doing so ensures that you don’t get bored 
with vegan meals — and you’ll get better nutrition to boot. When family and 
friends taste your locally inspired dishes and see how flavorful they can be, 
your reasons for going vegan will be easier for them to understand.
Imagine eating the same ten foods for the rest of your life. Even if those foods 
were carefully chosen, you would probably still be missing some important 
nutrients — and you would certainly get bored. A healthy diet is a diet full of 
variety. Getting your nutrition from many different sources ensures that your 
body is taking in all the benefits foods can offer, while also ensuring happy 
taste buds.
As a Certified Holistic Health Counselor, I meet with Americans from every 
walk of life and background. Their health concerns usually stem from being 
overfed and undernourished. They get plenty of calories and plenty of carbo­
hydrates, protein, and fats, but their diets are totally lacking in simple, ener­
gizing, living foods also known as “functional foods.” Don’t make that same 
mistake. As you begin planning your vegan menus, be sure to include a vari­
ety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes. These whole 
foods will collectively contribute the nutrients necessary for a healthy body. 
Also be sure to share delicious, healthy foods on a regular basis to ensure 
that your friends and family enjoy the vegan bounty and see how wonderful 
vegan eating can be.
	
The best ways to encourage a varied diet of fruits and vegetables are very 
simple: Maintain your vegan diet and stay away from junk food. Eating a 
vegan diet automatically increases your intake of plant foods, and serving 
simply prepared veggies and raw fruit at home is a delicious alternative to 
labor-intensive menus. Who doesn’t love some simple carrot sticks, steamed 
broccoli, lightly dressed salad greens, or baked sweet potatoes? Well, many 
people. But as you share more fresh fruits and vegetables with the people you 
love, their taste buds will start to love them. The less junk food you eat, the 
more you appreciate natural foods. And avoiding the fast-food and processed 
chemical-filled junk food is easy, because most of it isn’t vegan. Keeping the 
junk out of the house and only offering fresh, whole foods will ensure con­
sumption of a wider variety of healthy foods.

213
 Chapter 16: Walking the Vegan Walk (without Being Preachy!)
Here are some great ways to ensure variety in your diet and spread the 
vegan love:
	
✓	Get away from boring (and boiled) vegetables and fruits: To get out of 
the rut, try the following alternatives: Eat green salads with fruit; leave 
bowls of dried fruit around the house instead of candy; and serve raw 
veggies with Tofu Sour Cream (see Chapter 13) or your favorite vegan 
salad dressing. Offering healthy, delicious snacks to people will help 
them understand why you love this diet.
	
✓	Roast ’em if you got ’em: Roasted veggies taste delicious and keep 
well for a few days. Try tossing 1-inch cubes of carrots, sweet potatoes, 
beets, parsnips, sweet winter squashes, and halved Brussels sprouts 
with just enough organic olive oil to coat and a pinch of salt. Place the 
veggies in a glass baking dish or on a cookie sheet in a 375 degree oven 
and roast for 30–45 minutes, stirring once. These roasted veggies make a 
great side dish for leftovers and lunches.
	
✓	Visit your local farmer’s market: Pick up a new fruit or veggie each 
week to expand your repertoire. Ask the farmer for an easy recipe or for 
his favorite way to cook this new produce. Though keep in mind that 
seasonal produce is picked at the peak of its flavor, so often it doesn’t 
need much preparation to taste good. Take your family or roommates 
with you to the market — they’ll enjoy the experience and can help find 
delicious new produce to try.
	
✓	Join a CSA: A Community Supportive Agriculture program, or CSA, 
is a system where small farmers offer seasonal shares in their crops. 
Individuals and families can pay in advance for a weekly box of fresh, 
seasonal food to be delivered to a local drop-off point. This system 
encourages the shareholder (that would be you) to eat a more diverse 
selection of produce because you already have a box of nice food that 
you may not normally purchase. Many CSAs also provide recipes that 
use their seasonal produce.
When healthy food is the only option
My client D.G. decided to stop offering junk food 
to her teenaged son’s friends when they came 
over to play video games. Instead she put a big 
bowl of apples, bananas, and oranges on the 
table. When the boys said they were hungry, 
she simply said: “Eat an apple.” They did. All of 
them! When she saw how well that was work­
ing, she decided to go one step further. When 
the boys decided to stay over for dinner, she 
made a big pot of pasta, simple tomato sauce, 
whole-grain garlic toast, and a huge plate 
of steamed broccoli. They ate it all. Copy this 
example of sharing simple, vegan foods with 
friends and family in a non-confrontational 
manner, and everyone will benefit.

214
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
	
✓	Shake it up: Smoothie chains, which are everywhere these days, offer 
the opportunity to get several servings of fruit and veggies into your 
menu plan. Bring a bunch of vegan smoothies to your next meeting or 
group gathering to share the goodness with co-workers and friends.
	
	Smoothie shops often have soy yogurt and soymilk or rice milk, so be 
sure to ask if you don’t see what you’re looking for on the menu. If you 
can’t find a yogurt or nondairy milk for your smoothie, ask for fruit, 
juice, nuts, or seeds to be blended together. Be sure to ask for unsweet­
ened fruit. Employees at these establishments are familiar with personal­
ized blends and will be accommodating if asked nicely.
	
✓	Get juicy: Get a juicer or high-quality blender and make a fresh juice 
with several fruits and veggies daily. You can make juices with countless 
combinations; in fact, entire books are dedicated to juice recipes that 
focus on taste themes and specific health concerns.
	
✓	Be like the French and shop often: It’s normal in many European cul­
tures for families to shop every two or three days for fresh produce. 
Shopping this often may be easier in Paris or Milan where every neigh­
borhood has a fresh street market several times a week, but you can 
still make a quick trip into the grocery store for salad greens and fruit to 
ensure healthy snacking.
	
✓	Don’t turn a cold shoulder on the freezer: Keeping frozen fruits and 
veggies on hand enables you to have a quick, healthy side dish for every 
meal. Even vegan chefs need a quick bag of frozen green beans or edam­
ame to round out a meal sometimes.
	
✓	Plan ahead: Use a menu plan and weekly shopping list to make sure 
you’re ready to prepare a healthy meal or snack at a moments notice. 
Scrambling for dinner ideas at 5 p.m. will lead to drive-through cravings 
and old junk-food habits. Head to Chapter 9 for more details on planning 
meals.
Displaying Kindness and Understanding 
with Your Nonvegan Friends and Family
You can (and should!) set kind and loving intentions for yourself that your 
life’s actions will be harmless and bring positive change to the world. These 
thoughts probably aren’t new to you. After all, if you’re on the path toward 
vegan living, you’ve clearly begun to see and understand the consequences 
of your actions. Life is fragile, and eating a plant-based diet makes real your 
understanding that all life-forms deserve respect.
In this section, I show you the best ways to defend your vegan lifestyle with­
out burning bridges, and I also help you understand why you can’t always 
force others to see your point of view or take your life’s path.

215
 Chapter 16: Walking the Vegan Walk (without Being Preachy!)
Defending yourself without 
hurting others’ feelings
Food is an emotional, cultural, and personal issue for most of us. It evokes 
memories, acts as the glue at community and family bonding ceremonies, 
and becomes who we are. You are what you eat, and as a vegan, you have 
thought about what you eat on a much deeper and more profound level than 
most of the people around you.
	
After your decision to become vegan is made, it can bring joy and sorrow to 
you and the people who love you. You may feel challenged by other’s desires 
for you to conform to cultural norms. So be prepared to calmly defend your­
self to the people you love. Know your facts and read about the benefits of 
the lifestyle you have chosen. Project loving kindness toward anyone who 
gently, or crudely, asks “Why are you a vegan?” Chapter 26 provides you with 
responses to the most common questions you’re likely to encounter.
Avoiding the temptation to encourage 
others to follow your path
	
While every choice in your day may seem weighty as a vegan — from what to 
order for brunch to what shoes to buy — you may notice that the people you 
love aren’t so concerned with the impacts of their choices. It can be tempt­
ing to start encouraging people to make different choices and to explain why 
they’re doing something harmful. I remember saying things like “Did you 
know that your ham sandwich once had a mother?” or “That lady’s fur coat 
probably looked a lot better on the fox that first owned it.” These types of 
comments are not appreciated.
Instead, I discovered that most people don’t like being told what to do, and 
they really don’t like being told that their lifestyle is all wrong. Take note 
of how you feel when people discover how you eat and start making fun of 
you — does it make you want to stop being vegan and go back to what you 
were eating before? Certainly not! That’s why we need to be compassionate 
with our nonvegan friends and family. You need to have just as much com­
passion for them as for the animals you’re trying to save. Be passionate and 
steadfast, but also try to be gentle with others and yourself.
	
For example, instead of getting angry because your mother bought a new 
leather purse, take a moment and think about what she’s truly looking for in 
her choices. Be compassionate with her. Is your mother trying to update her 
style or make herself feel better about herself by purchasing new things? Try 
complimenting the style or color of her new purchase instead of insulting her 
because she bought leather. You could go online and print out pictures of 

216
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
other vegan purses and share them with her. Doing so could lead to a conver­
sation where you not only get to share her love of fashion, but you also get 
the chance to delve deeper and ask whether she’s happy with how her life is 
going. Perhaps what she really needed was someone to compliment her on 
how nice she looks, or recognize how hard she has been trying to lose weight. 
Compassion means having love and understanding for another being. Loving 
your mom means offering her support. If you gently show her other ways to 
fulfill her desires to look more attractive, she may be more interested in how 
fashionable vegan clothes are or how a vegan diet could help her lose even 
more weight.
Determining your way of 
being compassionate
There are many ways to be compassionate and kind in this life. Living a vegan 
life is a tremendous step away from a life that’s based on cruelty toward 
animals and the earth. You may decide to simply live a quiet vegan life for 
the rest of your days. You won’t offer information about your lifestyle unless 
you’re asked about it. And even then, you’ll project kindness no matter what. 
You could also feel so strongly about the injustices caused by the meat-and-
dairy-based diet you abandoned that you feel compelled to speak up and 
encourage others to make similar changes.
	
Choose the way that’s right for you. We each have strengths that can lead to 
positive transformations in the world. You may write a best-selling book or 
make a movie that causes thousands of people to change their lives. You may 
cook healthy vegan food for your friends, which in turn may cause a few people 
to eat less meat and dairy. You may raise your children to be lifelong vegans. 
Each path is a good one. Be kind to others who have chosen their own paths.
The Whole Enchilada: Yoking Your Mind, 
Body, and Spirit with the Earth
We live in a highly mechanized, isolating culture of technical communica­
tion and fewer and fewer authentic human interactions. So becoming vegan 
is often a natural response that people have to feeling that they want to 
connect with something good in the world. Becoming vegan also can be the 
first step toward living a fully integrated life where you see the connections 
between your career, lifestyle, diet, and the state of the world.

217
 Chapter 16: Walking the Vegan Walk (without Being Preachy!)
Meeting other vegans and participating in gatherings centered on food or a 
love for animals brings new friends into your life. Offering lovingly prepared 
plant-based meals to your family is a wonderful way to show them how much 
you care about them. Cooking becomes a form of meditation and an act of 
loving kindness. Keeping good thoughts in mind and blessing the food as you 
prepare a meal brings each dish a spirit of respect for the earth, animals, and 
your loved ones.
The growing trend among environmentalists, animal-rights advocates, and 
foodies alike is to eat as locally and seasonally as possible. The Slow Food 
movement was started in Italy in 1986 by a small group of people who wanted 
to be more conscientious about their food choices. The ideals of recogniz­
ing and honoring the connections among the food on their dinner plates, the 
people who produce that food, animal welfare, and the environmental health 
of the planet are the mission of this movement.
	
Freshness is an important part of a healthy diet. Once a plant is picked, it 
retains its energy, nutrients, and, in essence, it’s life force for only a short 
period of time. The fresher your food, the more energy you’ll receive from it. 
The more energy you receive from your food, the healthier you’ll be. Local 
foods are freshest because they were in the ground, growing and storing 
energy from the sun, rain, and earth, until just hours or days before entering 
your home.
Perform a simple experiment at home to really see my point here. Try a local, 
living food test with a friend or family member who isn’t yet vegan. For two 
days eat only fresh, locally prepared and produced foods. Go to your farm­
er’s market and buy fruits and veggies that were grown within 100 miles of 
your home. Eat these simple foods and take notes on how you feel. Then try 
eating only canned, packaged, and processed foods for two days. All these 
foods will have been made in a factory somewhere with ingredients that were 
sourced from distant locations. After the four days, compare the two differ­
ent styles of eating. How did your body respond to each style? How did your 
energy levels fluctuate with each type of food?
Even with your best intentions spurring you to eat more local and organic 
foods, you may find that you just want strawberries for Valentine’s Day. 
Your local farmers may not supply that food in winter, but you can still buy 
these off-season items organically. Buying organic food will still ensure that 
you’re feeding yourself nutritious, nontoxic food. You may be increasing your 
carbon footprint a little, because those strawberries were probably trucked 
from California or Florida, but you’re still voting with your dollars for a more 
sustainable food supply.

218
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
Eating mostly organic, locally produced foods can be expensive. Your priori­
ties to eat this way may require sacrifices of other luxuries. For some, that’s a 
happy decision and feels worthy.
	
No one is perfect, and it’s out of reach for most of us to eat local, organically 
produced food for every meal. Cut yourself a little slack and remember that 
you’re working hard to eat and live in a way that does as little damage as pos­
sible to others, yourself, and the earth.
Coming home to eat
In his fascinating autobiography Coming Home 
to Eat: The Pleasures and Politics of Local 
Food (W. W. Norton & Co.), Gary Paul Nabhan 
decided to explore the realities and challenges 
of eating closer to home. Nabhan performed a 
one-year eating experiment where he only ate 
foods that could be grown or found naturally 
within his watershed. His tale brings to light the 
amazing impact our food choices can have. The 
book helps the reader discover the why’s and 
how’s of eating locally, and how to work with 
and support local farmers and food producers. 
To find inspiration for your own food odyssey, 
read Nabhan’s book as well as these others:

P
icking a date for your vacation is important, but planning your eating 
strategy while you’re away is just as significant for a successful vegan 
adventure. You may be set in your eating and shopping routine at home, but 
going on the road in this meat-minded world is another story. You’ll have less 
control over when you eat, where you can shop, and what choices you have.
The danger lies in the easy temptation to rely on junky, nonnutritious food 
that can lead to health problems during your trip or after you get home. 
Changing your dietary routines also can wreak havoc on your digestive 
system, especially while traveling. Vacation food can be loaded with sugar, 
unhealthy fats, and sodium. The food also may be of questionable origins — 
who knows where that salad was made? And how was it washed? Was it even 
washed at all? Don’t be lured in by the standard away-from-home-mindset of 
“All rules are off! I’m not home!” Eating poorly can lead to a regrettable vaca­
tion experience.
Several fast-food chains are now serving vegan veggie burgers, and you may 
even find a vegan hot dog. You also can get by on a baked potato topped with 
veggies and a little salt, so be sure to get creative with the server behind the 
counter. Whether going overnight to grandma’s, flying away for the weekend, 
shipping out on your reunion cruise, or touring Southeast Asia for a month, 
you need to prepare yourself with options, strategies, and vocabulary to 
travel smart and stay true to your vegan commitment.

The world of vegan-friendly travel options is expanding every year. Are there 
more vegans or just more people who want to walk on the wild side? I can’t 
say, but this bodes well for the adventurous tofu eater. Search online or talk 
with a travel agent about packages geared toward vegans. There are bike 
trips, tour groups, cruises, private yachting trips with private chefs, and yoga 
retreats around the world that can provide all the rest and relaxation you 
need — all while providing you lovely, vegan food.
Mapping Your Meals on the Road
Thinking through your entire road trip before you set foot out the door is the 
first step to successful travel — especially when your eating habits are differ­
ent than most people you’ll come in contact with. Not spontaneous enough 
for you? Don’t worry. You’ll find plenty of opportunities on every journey to 
explore unplanned sites and meet new people. But as a traveling vegan, you 
need to remember that proper sustenance is as important as your traveler’s 
checks. You can still find great surprises and the best soy latte you ever had, 
but you need an outline of where to get something substantial to eat, too.
	
Thanks to the Internet and a little contraption called a cooler, you’ll never be 
at a loss for healthy, delicious food when traveling by car or by train. Mapping 
your route well in advance allows you time to explore and plan your pit stops 
before you leave home. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Get out your map and draw a red line along your planned route.
	
2.	Circle a sizeable town or city every 50 to 100 miles along your 
journey.
	
3.	Search the Internet for health food stores, grocery stores, and vegan 
and ethnic restaurants at each location.
	
	 Try searching the well-organized vegan restaurant finders like www.
happycow.net and www.vegdining.com to look for vegan-friendly 
restaurants and grocery stores.
	
4.	Put together a list with addresses, maps, and basic directions from the 
freeway. Also include business hours and a phone number for each 
stop you’d like to make.
You also want to put together a snack list and perishable meal list. 
Nonperishable snacks, such as crackers and pretzels, can be stored in the car 
or overhead storage on a train in bags or boxes and won’t go bad if unrefrig­
erated. Perishable items can be kept in a cooler with refreezable ice packs or 
ice cubes.

221
 Chapter 17: Vegans on the Move: Travel and Hotel Issues
	
If using ice cubes, plan on replenishing with new ice every two to three days 
on your trip. Gas stations, liquor stores, and grocery stores all usually sell 
bags of ice. If you bring ice packs with you, ask your hotel or train porter if 
you can refreeze them in an onsite freezer overnight. If driving in a car, use the 
hotel ice bucket to bury the packs in free hotel ice in your room overnight.
Consider the following list of healthy, easy, cheap, and yummy meals and 
snacks to keep stashed in your cooler. Many of these items can be replen­
ished along your route if you get your list of health food stores together:
	
✓	Carrot and celery sticks, sliced cucumbers, and red bell pepper spears
	
✓	Individual bottles of water
	
✓	Individual instant soup containers, which can be mixed with hot water 
from gas station tea machines, hotel bars, or diners
	
✓	Individual juice boxes and soy or rice milk boxes with straws
	
✓	Nut butter sandwiches made with whole-grain bread and naturally 
sweetened jam or apple butter
	
✓	Road-worthy fruits like apples, oranges, and bananas
	
✓	Seeds, nuts, dried fruit, and vegan chocolate chips mixed into your own 
trail mix
	
✓	Tea bags or individual coffee pouches, salt and pepper packets from 
fast-food joints, and a squeeze bottle of agave or brown rice syrup
	
✓	Tofu Sour Cream or Tofu Cheese to spread on veggies (check out 
Chapter 13 for these recipes)
	
✓	Vegan snack bars like Lara, Vega, Raw Revolution, Pro Bars, and Oskri 
Coconut Bars
	
✓	Wraps made with tortillas, hummus, beans and rice, or vegan veggie tofu 
cream cheese
Don’t forget to bring a few trash bags, napkins, and some washable spoons, 
forks, knives, and plates. Travel mugs are handy for refilling your tea and 
coffee on the road.
	
Consider stocking up on takeout orders if you find a great vegan-friendly res­
taurant while driving to your destination. These leftovers can be kept in the 
cooler for a couple of days.
	
Think “picnic in a car” when planning out your travel menu. Your road and 
train meals can be as fancy as you want, with slabs of marinated tofu on slices 
of fresh tomato and bread. They also can be as simple as gorp (“good old rai­
sins and peanuts”) and a bottle of water. Try something new!

Flying with Skill: Vegans in 
the Air and at the Airport
You’ve bought your airplane tickets, and your itinerary is set. Eating or 
snacking on your long flight is easy, right? And after you arrive at your des­
tination, you can merrily skip away from the airport into exotic vegan para­
dise — or can you? Planning ahead for air travel requires a new set of skills, 
but isn’t impossible — consider it an exciting part of your journey! I provide 
plenty of pointers in the following sections.
Being a vegan in someone else’s home
You may find it hard to believe, but many people 
really don’t understand what being vegan 
means. Many times they incorrectly assume 
that you’re vegetarian and will load you up with 
mashed potatoes with butter. My sweetheart of 
a mother-in-law made green beans for me on my 
first visit to her home. She happily announced 
that she “took the bacon out” just before serv­
ing it to me. When you’re traveling to someone’s 
home, you get your chance, not to preach, but to 
inform your family and friends about veganism.
So, how can you be a polite houseguest while 
still getting the foods you need? Before you 
arrive, let your hosts know of your special 
dietary needs. Explain what it means to be 
vegan and do the following:
	✓	Give some meal suggestions for when you 
first arrive. Many hosts will want to have 
some foods on hand that you will enjoy, so 
help them create this list.
	✓	Offer to lead a shopping trip. Doing so 
enables you to pick up foods that you want 
and helps you educate your hosts.
	✓	Make meals and snacks. Offer to be in 
charge of preparing some vegan foods, 
including main meals, side dishes, desserts, 
and snacks. Make it a truly vegan experi­
ence for your hosts.
	✓	Research restaurants and grocery stores 
online before your travels. Many nonvegan 
hosts may not know where to take you out 
to eat or where to go shopping. In order 
to take the pressure off your hosts, come 
armed with ideas that you have researched.
Bring some food items with you in your lug­
gage to ensure that you’ll have something on 
hand for the first several hours in case the first 
dietary conversation is misunderstood. A box 
of Mori-Nu tofu and a can of pinto beans don’t 
need to be refrigerated, so you can keep them 
in your checked baggage or backseat of the car.

 Chapter 17: Vegans on the Move: Travel and Hotel Issues
Requesting a vegan meal (and 
making sure you get it)
Airline food isn’t known for its diversity and vegan-friendly bent. Even the 
peanuts you may receive on the plane (if they’re even serving those any­
more) can be roasted with honey, a vegan no-no. Most airlines have cut back 
considerably on their meal service, so you may only get water or $2 cans of 
reconstituted orange juice.
	
If your flight does offer food, make sure your needs are known. As soon as 
you book your flight, whether it’s through a travel agent or online, be sure to 
contact the airline directly using its customer service line to ask specifically 
for a dairy- and egg-free, vegetarian or vegan meal. You may click correspond­
ing boxes on the airline Web site or tell your travel agent, but you still want 
to be sure that the airline gets the message more than once. Often, the vegan 
meal is much better than the regular options, and you’ll often get served first! 
Bonus! International flights often offer an ethnic version of the vegan meal; the 
“Asian vegetarian” option is your best bet. Be sure to explain that you want to 
avoid both dairy and eggs.
Double-check with the agent when you check in that your special meal 
request has been noted on the flight plan. You may not be able to get a vegan 
meal on board if the request didn’t go through, but at least you’ll know to 
pick something up in the airport before getting on the plane. Also try to alert 
the flight attendants of your special request when you’re sitting down before 
takeoff. Doing so helps them keep you in mind and show them where you are 
so your meal doesn’t end up on someone else’s tray table. Remember that 
politeness and a smile go a long way for these hardworking men and women.
	
If, for some reason, your special meal didn’t make it on the plane, ask if any 
suitable first- or business-class meals are left. The attendants usually help 
to remedy the situation with extra fruit, bread, or appropriate snacks if your 
meal was mislaid.
Carrying on your own food
It used to be that you could carry on just about anything when traveling by 
airplane, and that made it easier for us vegans to snack on flight. However, 
security has tightened severely since September 11th, 2001, restricting carry-
on approved foods. Not to worry, though; you can still carry on some foods 
to hold you over. Here are items you can safely bring with you for your air­
port picnic:
	
✓	Plastic spoon, fork, and knife. Smaller regional airports may not have 
these available.

224
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
	
✓	Beverages and soups in 3-ounce or smaller containers. Be careful, how­
ever, because these may spill en route to the airport or on the plane. 
Good soup options that can be eaten cold are lentil and gazpacho.
	
✓	Homemade sandwiches, leftovers (nonliquid, unless in 3-ounce or 
smaller containers), fruit, beans, and whole grains. Because taking small 
coolers on your flight will be problematic, just take a bag of food that 
doesn’t need refrigeration.
	
✓	Food bars and dry snacks, such as crackers, pretzels, and so on.
	
Stashing food in your carry-on will get you through your travel plans — unless 
something unplanned occurs. Weather delays, missed connections, and 
bizarre computer glitches can leave you stranded for longer than your apple 
and nuts will sustain you. So try to carry at least one vegan snack bar (see the 
snack list in the earlier section “Mapping Your Meals on the Road” for some 
suitable varieties) to get you through a missed meal. Also, eating a substantial 
meal before leaving for the airport ensures that you aren’t starving by the time 
you get through security.
Finding vegan food in any airport
Say you didn’t have time to eat before your 6 a.m. flight, and you were out of 
vegan food bars to stash in your backpack or suitcase before getting into the 
taxi. You’ve made it through security, your flight leaves in 45 minutes, and 
you’re starving — now what?
Depending on how large the airport is, your choices will vary greatly. Smaller, 
out-of-the-way airports may only have a newsstand while huge regional hubs 
will have food courts with ethnic joints, fast food, lounges, and restaurants. 
Here are some ideas of where to look for vegan food to tide you over until 
you reach your destination:
	
✓	Newsstands: At these stands you often can find water, trail mix, fruit, 
nuts, pretzels, and crackers.
	
✓	Fast-food joints: If you’re forced to choose something from a fast-food 
restaurant, try a baked potato. Ask for an ingredient list if the restaurant 
offers veggie burgers or bagels to ensure there are no hidden animal 
ingredients.
	
✓	Delis and food stands: If you come across a deli, see if it sells peanut 
butter and jelly sandwiches, veggie wraps (though check for cheese and 
mayo), nuts, fruit, pretzels, crackers, veggie sushi, bagels, or packets of 
peanut butter.
	
✓	Restaurants: Some restaurants provide a vegan-friendly selection. Look 
for ethnic dishes like stir-fried rice and vegetables, vegetarian burritos 
and tacos (hold the cheese), bagels, salads with beans, veggie burgers, 
veggie sandwiches (check for mayo and cheese), or pasta with veggies.

225
 Chapter 17: Vegans on the Move: Travel and Hotel Issues
	
✓	Lounges, airline clubs, and bars: These types of places usually offer 
crackers, pretzels, nuts, fruit, wine, water, and hot beverages. Some may 
even offer a menu of freshly prepared dishes and may be able to spe­
cially prepare a vegan pasta dish for you.
	
No matter where you are, don’t be afraid to ask for what you need and want. 
But, of course, do so with complete politeness. Be sincere and ask your wait­
ress if your special dietary needs can be accommodated. From truck stops 
to fancy French bistros, I have always received help from the server when I 
gently explain my situation. A little smile and a kind voice go a long way. Don’t 
forget to tip a little extra too, to say thank you, and to pave the way for the 
next hapless vegan who comes through town!
Healthy traveling vegans
Even with the best vegan diet, the onslaught 
of travel stress, loss of sleep, or foreign germs 
can be too much for the human immune 
system. Staying healthy on the road starts with 
eating well and ensuring your diet includes 
enough protein, complex carbohydrates, clean 
water, and veggies.
To ensure you don’t get stuck in the hotel with 
the flu for the whole trip, stay hydrated, avoid 
overconsumption of sugar and alcohol, abstain 
from illegal drugs, and know your physical 
limits. Make your own little travel pharmacy 
that includes the following:
	✓	Vitamin C packets that can be added to juice 
or a glass of water as well as a multivitamin 
to tide you over in case you can’t find nutri­
tious food choices on your journey
	✓	A hot water bottle, which can be filled with 
hot water from the tap in the airplane or 
hotel bathroom (A water bottle is perfect for 
a cramped neck, stomach pain or bloating, 
or cold feet.)
	✓	Hand sanitizer wipes and bandages
	✓	Sunscreen
	✓	Pain medication like aspirin, ibuprofen, or 
acetaminophen
	✓	Tweezers, nail clippers, and a nail file 
(stored in checked baggage, if you’re flying)
	✓	An ample supply of your regular medicines 
in their original containers, along with extra 
prescriptions for them just in case
A couple more tips:
	✓	Contact your health insurance company to 
find out the procedure for visiting a doctor 
in another country.
	✓	If you’re going to a country that’s known for 
“traveler’s diarrhea,” be sure to order your 
vegetables cooked and steaming hot. Peel 
all your fruit yourself, and don’t eat precut 
fruit; this will help you avoid anything cut 
with an unclean knife or cross-over con­
tamination from nonvegan foods. Avoid 
raw salads, and drink your water from 
commercially-sealed water bottles.
	✓	Be sure to eat substantial protein and com­
plex carbohydrates throughout your day 
while traveling. Walking all day and seeing 
the sites can lead to exhaustion if you don’t 
eat properly.

Traveling Together: Cruises 
and Group Trips
Seemingly built to serve your every desire, today’s cruise ships are like enor­
mous floating mall-spas. Most ships offer a huge variety of food made avail­
able around the clock. Certain cruise packages may be more vegan friendly, 
so if you have the opportunity, do your research and find a boat that will 
cater more specifically to you and your vacation dreams.
In this day and age any cruise ship will be familiar with and offer many veg­
etarian options. Talk with the travel agent or your cruise contact well in 
advance about your special food needs. This will give them time to come 
up with better and more varied options for you. These professionals may 
be able to provide you with sample menus and standard examples of what’s 
available.
	
When you first arrive on the ship, ask to speak to someone from the kitchen. 
Tell them you’re a vegan, and explain what that means. Ask if there are any 
items in their kitchen that may not be on the regular menu, like veggie burg­
ers, bean burritos, or tofu dishes. Similarly, if you decide to enjoy a special 
meal in one of the boat’s restaurants, notify that establishment ahead of time. 
Just like landlocked eateries, most will put something nice together for you if 
you don’t spring it on them during a rush.
Don’t be ashamed to take leftovers back to your cabin. If your meal was great 
but you couldn’t finish eating it, you can take it with you and have it for lunch 
or a snack the next day. Just remember to bring a washable container in your 
luggage so you have somewhere to store it. When you book your cruise, be 
sure to ask whether your cabin has a small refrigerator. If not, find out about 
renting one for the trip. This will allow you a lot more flexibility.
Even if you were somehow plunked down on a cruise ship with no warning, 
you would certainly be able to find pasta dishes, beans and grains, and lots of 
fruits and veggies. Again, just ask for what you need and make a meal out of 
several side dishes if you have to.
Tagging along with a tour group offers the comfort of friendly company and 
built-in support for many travelers. Vegans will want to talk to the tour leader 
before signing up for a group tour, because most of the meals will either be 
ordered ahead of time or scheduled for a specific restaurant along the way. 
Find out whether the group menu will be preset or whether you’ll be able to 
ask the server for a vegan version. If you’re traveling to a country where you 
don’t speak the language, be sure to talk with the tour operator about the likeli­
hood of finding a vegan option. (Tour operators usually frequent the same des­
tinations over and over, so they’re knowledgeable and the ones to ask.)

227
 Chapter 17: Vegans on the Move: Travel and Hotel Issues
	
Do your research on the predetermined tour route and search out vegan-
friendly restaurants near the group stops. The Internet is full of information 
on international vegan dining spots. To better communicate with waiters 
and clerks in foreign lands, get yourself a copy of the Vegan Passport by 
George Rodger (Vegan Society Ltd.), which is detailed in the sidebar “Lost 
in translation.”
Culture-Clash: Staying Vegan 
in Other Countries
Traveling abroad comes with a special set of considerations. For example, 
do you speak the language of the country you’re going to visit? Do you know 
anything about the local cuisine? Where will you be staying? But, when you’re 
a vegan, you also have to consider what meals and snacks will be available for 
you. Most major international and domestic cities will have at least one vegan 
restaurant, and a few cities are known for being vegan meccas. Portland, 
Oregon, New York City, London, and Vancouver, British Columbia, are great 
places to visit as a vegan.
Here are some simple ways to ensure a bon voyage:
	
✓	Use the Internet or look through vegetarian travel books before leaving 
home. These resources offer you ideas for vegan restaurants and health 
food stores. Don’t forget to search out farmer’s markets, too.
	
✓	Make a list of restaurants and health food stores for each country or 
city you’re traveling to. Compile the address, a small printable map, 
written directions, business hours, and a phone number for each restau­
rant or store.
	
✓	Try to verify that the listings are current before you venture out to eat. 
Call ahead and edit your list if they’re no longer open.
	
✓	Ask at local health food stores for recommendations. The employees 
there may know of a great, new vegan diner or cafe that hasn’t been dis­
covered by the travel guides yet!
	
✓	Check to see if your hotel, hostel, or other accommodation offers 
kitchen access or rooms with kitchenettes. If it does, you’re then free to 
buy food at the store and make your own healthy vegan meals. Research 
the hotels or hostels in your destination city to see what’s offered and 
which place would be the most vegan friendly.
	
✓	Search online for local vegan and vegetarian groups by city or country. 
They may have an office at your destination or be able to provide fur­
ther recommendations.

V
egan vixens and gents should hit the town every once in a while! Staying 
at home makes it easier to ensure that your morals are satisfied, but 
getting out into the world is fun and often necessary.
Eating in restaurants, cafes, diners, and dives can be tough for an 
herbivore — unless, of course, the place specifically caters to those who 
prefer to eat healthfully. However, you can still enjoy going out to eat with 
friends and family. In fact, you can even survive a cross-country road trip 
without starving or yearning for a nice bowl of greens, beans, and grains. 
That’s because vegan and vegetarian restaurants are easier to find in this 
technological age, and several online gems allow you to find what you need.
This chapter leads you through some of the best tips for eating out — any­
where, anytime. Dust off your Emily Post book, because good manners will 
serve you well with your servers and waiters. Planning ahead and discover­
ing how to get around a set menu can become second nature for any vegan 
out on the town.
Ask and Ye Shall Receive: Finding 
Vegan-Friendly Restaurants
Never fear, new vegan, you have hundreds of vegan-friendly restaurants to 
choose from coast to coast. You just have to do a little homework and look in 
the right places. I show you how in the following sections.

230
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
Doing your research
Finding a vegan restaurant isn’t as difficult as you may think, because you 
have many online resources to help you in your search. For instance, if 
you’re looking for fast-food or fast-casual dining establishments that may 
have vegan offerings, check out www.veganeatingout.com. This handy 
resource lists restaurant menus from all over the U.S., including national 
chains, and notes which items are vegan or can easily be made vegan. To 
look up vegan-friendly restaurants as well as health food stores, farmer’s 
markets, and co-ops, try these amazing Web sites: www.vegdining.com, 
www.happycow.net, and www.vegguide.org.
	
If you’re in a city or town that you’re unfamiliar with and you don’t have 
a computer handy, stop by a health food store or vitamin shop to ask the 
employees if they know of any vegan-friendly eateries. These people are usu­
ally knowledgeable about local options.
Discovering vegan-friendly ethnic eateries
If you’ve done your homework (see the preceding section), you’ve probably 
realized that ethnic restaurants often are fail-safe options for vegans. And, 
luckily, the world is full of amazingly unique ethnic cuisines. Many of these 
cuisines have vegan dishes to choose from, offering new flavors, textures, 
and experiences.
	
You should easily be able to find (or request) the following vegan dishes at 
many ethnic eateries:
	
✓	Bean tacos and burritos without lard or cheese
	
✓	Chinese bean curd (tofu) dishes with vegetables
	
✓	Grilled vegetables with olive oil and olives
	
✓	Indian vegetable and bean curries with dahl (lentils) and no ghee, clari­
fied cow’s milk butter
	
✓	Middle Eastern hummus and tabbouleh salad with vegetables and olives
	
✓	Thai vegetable curries made with creamy coconut milk
	
✓	Vegetable pizza with no cheese

231
 Chapter 18: Dining Out
Making the Most of Nonvegan Menus
Dining in a vegan restaurant is ideal, but you may not always be able to find 
one. If you plan ahead and know the restaurant you’ll be going to, you may 
be able to look at its menu online or call ahead to ask whether it offers any 
vegan options. If you find that vegan pickings will be slim, plan to eat a hearty 
snack before going out so you don’t have to rely on the bread basket to get 
filled up.
Even if you aren’t armed with a lot of information beforehand, you can usu­
ally find things to eat in any restaurant. This section points you to places to 
try first and also gives you pointers for making the most of nonvegan menus, 
even if you have picky vegan kids in tow.
Getting what you need wherever you are
	
Vegans often are faced with choosing their meals from menus that are loaded 
with meat and cheese. Fortunately, you can make good choices even in these 
limited situations. Use the following tips to help you make the most of any 
menu you may come across:
	
✓	Be as polite and patient as possible when asking for special meals. The 
employees at the restaurant may be in the middle of a rush, so your spe­
cial request could take extra time.
	
✓	Enroll the help of your server. Servers often are knowledgeable about 
what’s available and can help you figure out which dishes would be free 
of animal products. If the restaurant is very busy and your server doesn’t 
seem willing to help, put together a simple meal from vegan-safe side 
dishes. Most restaurants have a grain, vegetable, potato, or bean side.
	
✓	Be sure to leave a nice tip for any server who goes the extra mile to 
help you. This recognition of a job well done will pave the way for future 
vegans, especially if you’re super nice to boot.
	
✓	Call ahead to the restaurant as far in advance as possible. Talk with the 
manager or chef about your diet and what ingredients you avoid. If given 
enough advance warning, most chefs will happily accommodate you.
	
✓	Make the best of your situation and enjoy the company of friends 
and family. Order a drink, a salad, and some bread if you aren’t able to 
eat much else. Making a big deal out of the situation will make others 
uncomfortable and they may think twice before inviting you out again.
	
✓	Eat before you leave if you know there won’t be much available. Rather 
than starve throughout the night, you can be digesting while everyone 
else is eating! Have a cup of tea and fruit to participate in the meal.

232
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
Helping vegan kids find yummy choices
Eating on the road with kids can present another challenge to a vegan family. 
While adults may be more adventurous with ethnic dishes or even satisfied 
with very simple side dishes, kids can be picky. A vegan-friendly restaurant 
generally offers more choices for your little veg-head to choose from, but 
sometimes you can’t find such an eatery. This section tells you what to do if 
that’s the predicament you’re in.
	
Often a server can help you by asking the chef to make something vegan (and 
therefore more familiar) out of ingredients he has on hand in the kitchen. 
You’ll probably be more successful with this tactic if you visit a restaurant 
during a less-busy time. However, if you do end up at a restaurant during a 
rush, rather than descending on the already-stressed-out waiter with a list of 
special requests, try making a meal out of some of these common dishes:
	
✓	Bean and rice burritos with salsa and avocado
	
✓	Chips, salsa, guacamole, and lard-free beans
	
✓	Edamame with vegetable or avocado sushi
	
✓	Home-fried or baked potatoes topped with steamed broccoli and a little 
olive oil
	
✓	Hummus with pita bread or vegetables for dipping
	
✓	Lentil soup (without chicken or beef stock)
	
✓	Minestrone soup without cheese or chicken or beef stock
	
✓	Noodles with Thai peanut sauce
	
✓	Peanut butter and granola wrap: whole-grain tortilla spread with peanut 
butter and banana slices and then sprinkled with vegan granola or rai­
sins and crushed nuts
	
✓	Pizza toast: whole-grain toast spread with tomato sauce and topped 
with veggies and legumes, such as mushrooms, tomatoes, olives, white 
beans, and so on
	
✓	Pureed vegetable soups (without dairy or beef or chicken stock)
	
✓	Roasted beets, carrots, or sweet potatoes drizzled with olive oil
	
✓	Steamed artichoke leaves dipped in olive oil that’s been mixed with 
minced garlic and a little bit of salt
	
✓	Steamed corn sprinkled with a little olive oil and salt
	
✓	Three bean salad
	
✓	Tomato-based pasta sauce with zucchini and mushrooms mixed in
	
✓	Tomato soup with a side of rice and peas
	
✓	Vegetable pizza without cheese

Cafeteria conundrums: School 
and work lunches
Let’s face it. Unless we’re independently wealthy and home-school our kids, 
we all have to go to school and work. And when we’re away from home for 
that long, we have to eat lunch somewhere. Finding a healthy (and tasty) 
meal in a school or work cafeteria can be less than fun, and vegans face even 
bigger challenges. But don’t worry; in this section I give you some tips on 
how to get by without starving.
Navigating the school cafeteria
Eating at school can present a unique set of obstacles for the busy young 
vegan. Some high schools allow off-campus eating during lunch, but how 
likely is it that a vegan cafe sits within walking distance of your kid’s school? 
And should they spend that much money on eating out anyway? Even more 
difficult to maneuver are the elementary and middle school cafeterias. The 
kids that attend these schools probably aren’t making many of their own 
food choices yet, so they eat whatever is given to them.
Vegan kids can feel pressured by their peers when it comes to eating differ­
ently, too. Adolescence is all about acceptance, so some kids may get some 
teasing for their brown bag option. Help your child feel more comfortable by 
asking them which vegan options they’re most comfortable with for lunch. 
Leftover tofu stir-fry may draw unwanted attention, but a bean burrito with 
brown rice and avocado can pass under the ridicule-radar. Lifelong vegan 
kids feel stronger dedication in their cruelty-free choices, but newer converts 
may need support from home to make the transition. Help your kid come up 
with witty jokes about how their food is cool, and remind them of the long 
list of famous vegans in Chapter 25 to throw out at the lunch table.
	
When all is said and done, many school cafeteria lunch programs offer a 
dismal array of menus. So, sending your children to school with homemade 
lunches is really the best option — unless, of course, your school cafeteria has 
been made over to provide plant-based options.
Sometimes, you run out of time to put together a vegan lunch for your child. 
And sometimes your kid may want to fit in every now and then and join the 
lunch line. Cafeteria settings usually offer a wide variety of a la carte offerings 
and side dishes. Vegan kids can make a meal out of the salad bar and smaller 
side options. If a chef is always available in the cafeteria (as they are on 
Google’s campuses), you may be able to request something vegan- and kid-
friendly from the staff. It never hurts to ask!

234
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
	
You may not find organic, whole-grain, seasonal foods in every school cafete­
ria, but you can still often put together a healthy meal. Here are a few ideas:
	
✓	Pasta primavera with no cheese
	
✓	Tortilla chips, salsa, and guacamole
	
✓	Veggie sandwich without the cheese
	
✓	Green salads
	
✓	Bean salads
	
✓	Rice with vegetables mixed in
	
✓	Couscous with pita bread and hummus
Eating vegan at your workplace
Eating at work is often easier on the wallet (and on the vegan) if you bring 
your own lunch instead of heading to the cafeteria. That’s not always an 
option, however, and it can be nice to have someone else take care of lunch 
once in a while. If your cafeteria currently offers no vegan dishes, talk with 
the chef about ideas and recipes she can incorporate into the menu. Many 
vegan dishes would even be appealing to nonvegan employees, including stir-
fried Chinese vegetables and tofu, vegan soups, and an expanded salad bar.
	
Consider organizing a potluck lunch with your co-workers. Every person can 
bring in a different dish to share, and you can ask that some people try their 
hand at vegan cooking. This easy activity can encourage camaraderie and can 
open others up to eating more veggie-based meals.
Incredible Ideas for Eating Anywhere
Even fast-food joints can offer vegans a snack or small meal. In general, these 
eateries aren’t the best option for vegans who care about how corporations 
treat animals, but sometimes we have to break the rules — especially when 
driving across the country or when stuck in vegetable-hostile territory.
In this section, I provide you tips and ideas on how to find vegan meals and 
snacks in national chains, sandwich shops, and fast-food joints. Be sure to 
ask for exact ingredients from these establishments, because the servers may 
have limited knowledge of what goes into the food.

235
 Chapter 18: Dining Out
Fast-food chains
Veggie burgers at national fast-food chains are often vegan, but make sure 
to ask about the ingredients first. The patties may include cheese, caseinate 
(a protein found in cow’s milk), or eggs. Many outlets serve potato prod­
ucts like fries, baked potatoes, and hash brown patties that, while fried and 
greasy, are usually vegan. Salads with a vinaigrette dressing are increasingly 
available on many menus, but be sure to choose one without grilled meat or 
added cheese. Many chains offer chili in the colder months, but opt for the 
veggie chili without dairy. Ice cream parlors often offer dairy- and gelatin-
free ices and sorbets, but do be sure to specifically ask about the ingredients 
before purchasing.
Sandwich shops
Sandwich shops and fast-casual chains offer every kind of animal product 
imaginable to stuff between two slices of bread. However, you can get by in 
most places by requesting a veggie-only grinder or hoagie. Some locations 
may have protein-rich hummus, creamy avocado slices, or guacamole to 
slather on your sandwich. Just be sure to skip the mayo and cheese. You also 
can snack on pickles, salads, potato chips, and fruit to fill your belly at these 
spots.
You also could run down to the health food store and grab a container of fake 
meat deli slices to bulk up that fast-food sandwich! If a diner has grilled por­
tabellas or other mushrooms on the menu, ask for extra veggies and a couple 
of slices of toast to make your own mushroom burger.
Pizza parlors and Mexican joints
Many pizza parlors can make a veggie pizza without cheese and load it with 
extra mushrooms, olives, and peppers. Bread sticks or garlic knots made 
with olive oil instead of butter can be dipped in vegan marinara sauce for a 
yummy, filling snack. Ask whether the chef can offer you a side of vegetable 
toppings like zucchini, mushrooms, or broccoli.
Mexican joints often have rice, tortillas, salsa, and fresh vegetables to create 
a vegan taco salad. Other options would be to make a taco salad with a fried 
tortilla as the bowl, beans (for added protein), rice, and diced avocado.

Beware of These Hidden 
Animal Ingredients
Unless you cook all your own meals and work or go to school next door to a 
vegan diner, eating according to your values can be difficult in this day and 
age. Some animal products are used for flavoring foods, and others are used 
to filter impurities from some alcoholic beverages. Other insect-derived prod­
ucts, such as honey or carmine, are used to sweeten and color foods.
To ensure that you avoid the myriad of animal-derived ingredients used 
in foods, beverages, and health and beauty products, get familiar with the 
common additives used. But remember to take it easy on yourself if you find 
out later that something you ate contained an animal product. Living vegan 
isn’t always easy, but it’s worth the effort.
	
The good people at PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), have 
put together a comprehensive list of animal ingredients to avoid when shop­
ping. You can peruse the list at www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.

egans venture out just as often as “normal” folks, heading to events, 
gatherings, meals, and celebrations. The danger of ending up hungry 
during social situations is more common for herbivores, however. You can’t 
count on people to know your dietary preference, but you can take precau­
tions to ensure the best possible outcome for your outing.
Thinking ahead is an important skill for every vegan to hone. Get familiar 
with the ins and outs of party planning to understand what your options for 
eating can include. If you’re planning a party with a mixed guest list, think 
about the comfort of everyone you invite. Also accept invitations to events 
and consider the party plan before you go. Asking for what you want is 
something you must do from time to time, and the way you interact with the 
people you’re asking a favor of can mean everything.
This chapter explains the different social situations you may find yourself 
in and how to best navigate them. Considering the lay of the land for large, 
catered celebrations versus smaller, more intimate gatherings helps you 
choose the best options whether attending someone’s party or planning your 
next shindig. Creating new celebrations and traditions also is part of being 
vegan in this culture. In this chapter, I share ideas and resources to help you 
create a truly luscious life and enjoy the company of others, regardless of 
everyone’s diet.

Hosting Parties, Traditional 
Meals, and Celebrations
Just because you’re a vegan now doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the same his­
toric family gatherings you did in years gone by. You’ll still be hearing the 
same old stories about your brother squirting milk out of his nose when Uncle 
Paul told a funny joke, or the time (50 years ago!) that the same Uncle Paul 
purposefully scratched your mom’s Yellow Rose of Texas record. You’ll just be 
laughing along with a glass of soy nog or a plate full of Tofurky instead.
	
As a vegan, hosting parties and traditional meals can be tricky (but by no 
means impossible). After all, you’ll likely be inviting some nonvegan family 
members or friends to your fete. The main decision you need to make is 
whether you’re willing to allow nonvegan food at your party. If not, you need 
to make sure your vegan dishes will be appealing to everyone’s tastes (or at 
least as much as possible). This section provides you with tips and advice on 
choosing occasions to celebrate, setting your menu, and more.
Planning your event
Planning a vegan party really is the same as planning any nonvegan event. 
In both instances, you have certain tasks to tend to depending on how many 
and what types of guests are coming, how formal it is, and how elaborate 
the celebration and scheduling becomes. If your event is casual and you’ll 
be doing most of the cooking, the plan will be as easy as vegan pie: Create 
a menu, invite the guests, buy your supplies, and get to work. More formal 
events require more thought about the scope and size of a menu as well as 
what it takes to host a more diverse crowd.
Here are some things to remember for the different types of parties you 
may have:
	
✓	Kid parties: Planning parties for children and teenagers requires a few 
extra steps. Make sure the kids or teens have a say in how the party 
will look, what music will be played, what the entertainment will be, 
and what the menu will entail. Buffets are generally the easiest method 
of feeding a group of kids, so make sure the food isn’t too messy. Offer 
plenty of ways for the kids to have fun while also making sure they know 
the rules.
	
✓	Mixed-age gatherings: These parties need a few extra safety plans. For 
instance, make sure that any alcohol that’s served is in plain sight at 
all times. Don’t allow curious kids the chance to sneak into a bar area. 
Offering snacks and some kind of games or activities for little people can 
help them feel like treasured guests.

239
 Chapter 19: Navigating Tricky Social Situations
	
✓	Adult soirees: Adult-only parties can range from totally casual game 
nights to sit-down multicourse dinners. Be sure to invite guests well in 
advance so they have time to plan their calendars (and so you have time 
to make sure you’ve thought of all the supplies you’ll need). Decorating 
can be as simple or over-the-top as you like; just be sure you give your­
self plenty of time the day before the party to clean, set up, and cook 
your menu.
	
Here’s a tip that works for any of the preceding types of parties: Rather than 
cook several different courses, prepare large amounts of a few, great dishes. 
Doing so can help make your event easier. In fact, many dishes can be made 
the day before your event, which will ensure that you have enough time to 
prepare everything. Spend more of your party budget on fresh flowers to add 
a dash of sophistication.
Figuring out your menu
If you’ve reached your limit on going to parties where you can’t eat anything 
but raw broccoli and carrot sticks, funnel your frustration to create your own 
fabulous vegan party menu. Depending on your level of cooking experience, 
you can prepare simple or complex dishes. Every host and hostess can use 
the following tips to plan a well-rounded soiree.
Getting started by gathering some recipes
Whether you’re throwing a birthday party for your best friend or having a 
vegan Thanksgiving dinner for your family, you have countless recipes and 
menu plans to choose from. Don’t feel hindered by tradition, because any good 
recipe can be included at any event. Still, you can offer more traditional-style 
meals to help people feel more comfortable if they’re unsure of vegan food.
If you take a look at a few vegan cookbooks, you’re sure to find at least a 
dozen recipes suitable for any occasion. Start planning your event by making 
a list of recipes that you would like to offer. Then look through the vegan 
cookbooks available at your local bookstore or library. Or check out the 
Internet, which has countless vegan recipes to choose from.
	
It’s best to choose an online recipe that has positive reader comments or 
that’s published on a well-known Web site. You don’t want to try a recipe for 
a party that wasn’t well written or tested. At the very least, be sure to try a 
recipe a few times before serving it to guests.
Sticking with traditional and familiar foods
Thanksgiving and traditional larger holiday meals are easier to tackle than 
you may think. Tofurky has been around for years and offers a full vegan 
meal, including the turkey-shaped tofu filled with a delicious vegetable and 

240
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
bread stuffing. Most side dishes for Thanksgiving are already vegetable based 
and shouldn’t be difficult for you to veganize.
	
Making a vegan version of a food that’s familiar to most people will ensure 
that your guests are comfortable and enjoy tasting your dishes. Some ideas to 
offer are a Mediterranean menu of falafels, hummus, tabbouleh, stuffed grape 
leaves, olives, and baba ghanouj. Another idea is to offer a diner-style menu 
with homemade veggie burgers, Mac n’ TeaseCheese (recipe found in Chapter 
14), and baked sweet potato fries. (Flip to Chapter 10 for more on veganizing 
some all-time favorite foods.)
Keeping some general menu tips in mind
When putting together a menu, think of the overall look and feel you want 
to create. The taste, color, and texture of each dish should be considered. 
Create a nice flow from dish to dish by choosing a certain spice profile. You 
can make a plethora of menus using Italian, French, or Asian ingredients, 
herbs, and spices. Use pops of color in each dish with garnishes of freshly 
chopped herbs, grated carrots, or diced bell peppers of several colors.
If you’re serving a buffet or multicourse meal, use the following combinations 
to provide a well-rounded meal: one soft dish, one hard or chewy dish, two 
savory dishes, one spicy dish, two crunchy dishes, and one sweet dish. For 
a smaller meal, you could offer one soft dish, two crunchy dishes, two spicy 
dishes, one savory dish, and one sweet dish.
Dessert is an important part of any party, so choose something fantastic and 
memorable. Not everyone likes chocolate, and some people are allergic to nuts, 
so consider offering a fruit-based dessert instead of or alongside the chocolate 
offering. Chapter 15 provides some recipes for you to experiment with.
Dealing with the age-old question: What can I bring?
If your guests ask to bring dishes to share, it’s okay to ask that they bring 
vegan dishes. They may welcome the challenge, or they may decline — but 
there’s no harm in asking! If someone wants to bring “an old family favorite” 
that includes meat or dairy, perhaps she has another vegan dish she enjoys 
and wouldn’t mind bringing. If bringing a vegan dish is too complicated for a 
guest, tell her she can bring bread or wine to add to the celebration.
	
There’s no need to get into a tense situation over dinner, so offer alternatives 
and be open to your guests’ ideas. After all, the reason for getting together is 
to acknowledge your shared love for each other and to create new memories. 
If you feel that a more conservative friend or family member is hesitant to “go 
vegan,” even for one night, ask if she’ll bring her favorite nonvegan specialty. 
If you’re comfortable having nonvegan food at your event, it could help that 
guest feel like she’s a part of the party rather than an outsider — after all, you 
know how that feels!

Sample party plans and menus
Putting together a plan and menu well in advance can help you work out any 
kinks as you get ready for your feast. If you’re at a loss for ideas, but you’re 
sure you want to gather the gang, look to the themes in the following sections 
to get the party started.
A build-your-own-burrito party
Who doesn’t love Mexican food — chips and salsa, burritos, and vegan-style 
refried beans? A Mexican-themed build-your-own-burrito party is sure to be a 
hit with vegans and nonvegans alike. Offering plenty of burrito toppings will 
distract guests from the fact that there’s no meat or dairy on the table.
Serve steamed tortillas or corn chips with a buffet table laden with some of 
these fillings: shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded vegan cheese, 
tofu sour cream, thinly sliced green onions, diced red onions, guacamole, 
several kinds of salsa, vegan refried beans, crumbled tempeh seasoned with 
soy sauce and sautéed in olive oil, canned jalapeños, and cooked brown rice. 
(Check out Chapters 13 and 14 for recipes for Tofu Sour Cream and Seitan 
Burritos, respectively.)
Here are some ideas to liven up the Mexican theme:
	
✓	Decorate the buffet tables with the colors of the Mexican flag: white, red, 
and green. Candles and novelty chili pepper light strings will add to the 
theme as well.
Celebrating grilling season vegan-style
Warm weather brings out the grills and barbe­
cues across America. Vegans often have a dif­
ficult time finding anything edible or substantial 
at these outdoor events. You can get by eating 
a burger bun with mustard, lettuce, tomato, and 
pickle slices, but by the end of the night you’ll 
be starving. And it can be tough to reconcile 
your hopes for the planet while hungry and sur­
rounded by smoking plates of carnage.
Planning your own vegan celebrations allows 
you to share the barbecue season with friends 
without competing with the big meat-grilling 
days like July 4th or Memorial Day. Summer 
solstice is a nice, alternative holiday that many 
vegans prefer to celebrate. Held around the 
22nd of June, the longest day of the year, this 
warm first day of summer offers the perfect 
opportunity to celebrate Mother Nature’s 
bounty and seasonal produce. (See “A summer 
solstice celebration” for more details on throw­
ing this type of party.)
Parties can be created around any anniversary, 
upcoming event, or life change. Use these times 
to bring family and friends together and share 
with them your love for healthy, delicious vegan 
food.

242
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
	
✓	Put together a playlist of music to match the food: The Gypsy Kings, 
Salsa, Tejano, or Mexican pop can easily lend a festive atmosphere to 
the party.
	
✓	If you’re serving alcohol, choose vegan Mexican beers like Corona and 
homemade margaritas with lime or lemon slices.
A summer solstice celebration
The summer solstice, the longest day of the year, deserves a party that lasts 
well through the afternoon and into the night. This pagan celebration was full 
of ritual and debauchery back in the ancient days, so encourage your guests 
to let their hair down, dance, and have a ball. Here are some great ideas for 
throwing your own summer solstice celebration:
	
✓	Incorporate the ancient tradition of wearing flower or leaf crowns. 
Making crowns or headbands with ribbons, flowers, and floral wire 
doesn’t take too much crafting skill and really gets guests into the mood 
of the party.
	
✓	Choose refreshing drinks. Homemade lemonade, iced tea, and white or 
rosé wines will fit right in with the warm-weather theme.
	
✓	Serve seasonal vegetables and fruits to incorporate the bounty of the 
summer harvest. Visit your local farmer’s market two weeks before the 
party to ask which foods the farmers will offer the week of your party. 
Asking in advance gives you time to come up with a menu incorporating 
those ingredients.
	
✓	Entertain your guests with group games. Plan a few games that involve 
shouting out answers and teamwork. Trivia competitions or singing 
games are popular party games.
	
✓	Include fire, which is an important part of any pagan ritual. If you 
have a large outdoor space, build an outdoor fire pit, a bonfire, or a 
campfire surrounded by stones. Or just light a bunch of candles if you’re 
short on space.
	
✓	Cook foods on the open flame or grill. You can grill all sorts of food, 
including seitan skewers, marinated mushrooms, vegetables, peaches, 
and pineapple slices.
	
✓	Prepare some hearty salads to round out the summer menu. For 
instance, try a basil tomato salad with tofu chunks that have been mari­
nated in olive oil, red wine vinegar, and salt and pepper. Or put together 
a chickpea salad with olive oil, fresh parsley, and garlic. A vegan Caesar 
salad with fried tempeh croutons is sure to be a crowd pleaser.
	
✓	Plan to tell stories after the eating is over. Ask people to share a special 
event that they were in, a scary thing that happened, or a disaster they 
survived. Or ask guests to recount the funniest things that have ever 
happened to them.

243
 Chapter 19: Navigating Tricky Social Situations
	
✓	Dress up and play. Draw inspiration from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer 
Night’s Dream and ask people to come dressed as any character from 
the play.
	
✓	Light up the party. Once the sun goes down, offer sparklers to the 
guests, turn on twinkling outdoor Christmas lights, or light some tiki 
torches.
Being a Guest at an Omnivorous Table
It’s rare to live in a vegan bubble. Most of us still have friends and loved ones 
who choose to eat meat and dairy products. Shunning the entire nonvegan 
human race isn’t an option — they’re still good people and they can be pretty 
fun! So do accept invitations to celebrate and dine with nonvegan friends and 
family.
	
If it seems appropriate, offer to bring one or two vegan options to share with 
the other party members. Consider yourself warned, however: If your dishes 
are extra tasty, eat plenty of food before you head to the party. This vegan 
chef has been left hungry more than once when the other party attendees real­
ized how yummy the vegan food was — and ate it all!
Graciously accepting dinner 
party invitations
You have two possible scenarios to choose from with any invitation: to go or 
not to go. Of course, only you can decide the best option for you.
Perhaps you don’t want to go, but you’re worried about how to nicely 
decline. Rather than admitting that you don’t want to encounter all the 
meat and dairy at the party, politely respond that you aren’t able to attend 
because of a conflict. Let the host know that you would have loved to attend, 
if only your calendar had been free. The super polite vegan will go the extra 
mile and check back to inquire how the party went afterward.
Assuming you’ve decided to accept the invite to a friend’s party, the following 
sections give you some ideas to keep in mind when attending a nonvegan event.
Talk to your host politely before your meal
Contact your host in person as soon as possible after receiving an invitation. 
Warmly accept the invite and mention that you don’t eat certain foods and 
that you were wondering whether you could talk about the menu with him. If 
he offers to include a vegan dish for you, politely gush about how gracious he 
is. If he doesn’t, accept the invitation anyway and plan accordingly.

244
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
	
When a host has been kind enough to include a vegan diet for you at his cele­
bration, be sure to thank him for his consideration at the event. Sending a 
thank-you note in the mail or via e-mail after the party shows truly lovely 
vegan etiquette.
Contributing to the feast
Bringing a vegan dish to a party is a great way to break the ice. Make sure 
you talk with the host or hostess well in advance to ensure that you can 
appropriately work your food into the evening. If the dinner is built around 
a certain theme, bring a vegan dish that works well with that cuisine and its 
aromas. It could be offensive to the other guests’ senses if you brought a 
spicy Chinese dish to a dinner based on milder French herbs and foods.
If the meal is small and casual, putting a couple extra dishes on the buffet won’t 
be a big deal. If the dinner is slightly more formal with servers or courses, plan 
in advance to bring the dish and work it into the flow of the meal. Check with 
the hostess about serving dishes, too. She may not have enough platters or 
serving trays for your extra dishes. In that case, you could bring something 
with similar colors to work your food into the night seamlessly.
Keeping cool in a crowd of nonvegans
	
When dining with omnivores at an event, be sure to keep your judgments to 
yourself. While you may be disgusted with their lobster carcass or bloody 
steak, making comments about their choices only draws negative attention to 
yourself and opens the door for a verbal sparring match. Most people don’t 
like being told what to eat or how their choices are “wrong,” and nagging 
rarely wins converts to the vegan lifestyle.
If you’re offered a nonvegan dish, you can politely pass with a simple “No, 
thank you,” and leave it at that. If a vegan option is offered to you, reinforce 
the party planner’s decision by commenting on how much you liked the dish 
and how nice it was to find something so yummy and vegan that you could 
enjoy. This compliment reminds the host to continue offering vegan dishes at 
future events.
	
If anyone gives you a hard time while you’re out in mixed company, keep your 
cool and remember the following:
	
✓	Count to ten and breathe deeply. Think about whether this is truly the 
time or place to freak out or offer a finely placed verbal comeback.
	
✓	Laugh the comment off amiably and change the subject to someone 
else. People like others who can take a joke.
	
✓	Take the high road and refuse to be rude in return. Setting a good 
example for behavior encourages others to keep a rude person in line.
	
✓	Don’t take it personally. The other person may have had a rotten day, 
or he may just be socially inept.

Little party animals: Helping your vegan kid enjoy the event
When kids are younger and haven’t been exposed to a lot of party food, you 
can easily steer them away from junk food and sugary desserts. As they get 
older, however, they develop lightning-fast radar to zero in on the cakes, 
candy, and snacks being offered. Get prepared before the event to help 
ensure an easier feast.
	
Sometimes you just have to say no to a food that your little vegan wants, but if 
you’re honest with her from the beginning, the conversation should be easier. 
Explain why you don’t eat milk, dairy, and meat. Talk with your child about 
how cow’s milk, eggs, and other meats require that an animal be hurt or killed. 
If your child makes an emotional connection with animals, she won’t want to 
eat food made from them. (Chapter 22 provides more information about rais­
ing vegan kids.)
	
Here are some tips for making parties more fun for your vegan kid:
	
✓	Touch base with the party giver and ask whether any vegan options 
will be served. If not, offer to bring a couple of dishes that go with the 
party theme that your child can enjoy and share. For example, if the 
party will have chocolate cake and pigs-in-blankets, make a vegan choco­
late cake and tofu pups wrapped in vegan pastry dough. You can then all 
enjoy the party and your kid won’t feel left out.
	
✓	Fill up on favorites before the party. Eat some delicious food before 
leaving, and talk about the food that your kid can eat at the party. 
Offering a favorite menu before the party encourages your kid to fill up 
on healthier foods, making her less hungry when you arrive at the event.
	
✓	Sneak in snacks. Take something your family loves to snack on in case 
enough filling options aren’t being offered. Simple rice milk boxes, vegan 
cookies, and a vegan deli meat wrap can save the day.
	
✓	Celebrate! Build up the fun activities and games to participate in, the 
friends to play with, and the meaning of the party to the host. This is a 
chance to really enjoy a fun time together and share a special moment 
with friends.
Fancy functions: Weddings, bar/bat 
mitzvahs, and galas
Attending a big blast gives you a chance to break out your hottest vegan 
duds. And showing off your vegan etiquette ensures that you’ll be asked to 
the next elegant event. As with any event, standard rules apply for every 
guest.

246
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
	
Be sure to act as politely as possible in every interaction with the hosts, staff, 
party planners, and other guests. Sending a handwritten thank-you card to the 
host within a few days of the event is good etiquette. If the person who invited 
you made a special effort to provide you with vegan food, be sure to thank him 
specifically for his consideration. Good behavior gives all vegans a good name!
In the following sections, I provide advice for enjoying all types of fetes, from 
small events to grand affairs.
Small events
Cocktail parties often present a vegan dilemma. Passed hors d’oeuvres are 
often heavy with meat or dairy, and it isn’t easy to bring your own vegan 
recipes to a swanky cocktail party. So be sure to eat something substantial 
before attending.
	
Often held in the evening before dinner, cocktail parties can challenge a 
vegan’s alcohol capacity. Imbibing booze on an empty stomach can lead to 
tummy trouble and drunken party fouls. If you don’t have time to eat a light 
meal before attending, only drink nonalcoholic beverages like juice mixed with 
soda water.
When attending a cocktail party in someone’s home, be kind and polite to 
the staff. They may be hired for this specific event, or they may be regular 
employees of the host. Rather than making special food requests of the staff, 
speak with the person throwing the party well in advance.
Buffet brouhaha
Buffet events, including weddings and award ceremonies, sometimes offer 
vegetarian options. These dishes could be made vegan if you avoid the egg or 
dairy, but sometimes those ingredients are completely mixed in.
When you know you’ll be attending an event with a buffet, contact the party 
planner or host to ask whether a vegan-friendly option will be available. She 
may be able to work something in for you. If not, plan on eating a substantial 
meal before attending, and try to make a snack out of the side dishes, salads, 
and bread offerings.
Seated dinners
Formal events, including weddings and bar and bat mitzvahs, have specific 
three- to five-course seated meals planned far in advance. So planning ahead 
is imperative for vegans who want to enjoy longer evenings such as these.

247
 Chapter 19: Navigating Tricky Social Situations
As soon as you receive the invitation for a seated dinner, contact the host 
about your vegan diet. Rather than insist that a vegan option be made avail­
able, politely ask whether a vegan dish will be offered. If the host hadn’t 
planned on a vegan dish and doesn’t offer to provide one, simply thank him 
for letting you know so you can prepare accordingly. These events can last 
several hours, so you’ll want to eat a substantial meal before attending. 
Keeping a hearty snack in your purse or pocket can help you get through the 
party without an attack of low blood sugar.
	
If you’re feeling hungry and no more cruelty-free food options are available, 
stay away from alcohol; the effects of it will be stronger and faster on an 
empty stomach.
Event facilities, hotels, and conferences
Attending a conference or event held in a hotel, conference center, or other 
event facility offers vegans similar challenges to those at large weddings. The 
event coordinator will be planning meals for hundreds of guests and may not 
have considered vegan dietary needs.
Is that alcohol truly vegan?
Many alcohol companies use animal products 
to create their beverages. Breweries still use 
finings, or filter applications, made from fish 
bladders called isinglass. Gelatin also is used 
in some brews, as are milk and honey. Some 
wines are clarified with the same ingredients 
as well as caseinate, a milk protein, or albumin 
from eggs or dried animal blood. Here’s a partial 
list of vegan beers, wines, and hard alcohols to 
choose from:
	✓	Beer: B.J’s, Bridgeport, Corona, Deschutes 
Brewery, Dogfish Head, Fish Tail, Full 
Sail, Grolsch, Hair of the Dog, Heineken, 
Henry’s, Killian’s Irish Red, Miller, Mt. Hood 
Brewing, Moosehead, Pilsner Urquell, 
Portland Brewing, Redhook Ale, Rolling 
Rock, Sapporo, Sierra Nevada, Terminal 
Gravity, Tuck’s Brewing, most Widmer 
brews, Woodchuck Draft Cider
	✓	Wine: Albet i Noya, Alderbrook Winery,

Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
When confirming your attendance at an event like this, talk with the planner 
or host committee as soon as possible. Tell the planner your dietary restric­
tions and ask whether she could arrange for a vegan option to be provided at 
every meal. This usually can be accommodated. As in all cases, be polite and 
friendly.
	
Even though you ask in advance, it’s wise to confirm the week before an event 
that your vegan meal option has been accounted for. No matter what, how­
ever, you’ll be better off bringing a wrapped sandwich, thermos of soup, and 
other snacks just in case. Some event facilities aren’t as well versed in vegan 
catering, so the offering provided may be simple veggies and pasta, which 
isn’t very filling. You could get hungry later, so having hearty snacks on hand 
can get you through the day.
If you’ll be staying overnight at a hotel, call ahead and ask to speak to the room 
service manager or a chef in the hotel’s restaurant. Talk with these folks about 
your dietary needs, and ask whether the hotel would be willing to provide a 
vegan tofu dish during your stay. You can even offer to bring a new container 
of tofu as long as the chef is willing to cook it for you. This method is especially 
useful for business travelers who stay in the same hotel repeatedly.
Dating a Nonvegan: Does True 
Love Really Conquer All?
Vegans young and old make the choice to live a cruelty-free life based on 
their morals, emotions, and hopes for their health and the health of the 
planet. These high personal standards can become difficult to maintain in 
the face of love with a nonvegan. Whether you’re single and have just met 
the nonvegan love of your life or you’re already in a relationship where your 
partner has chosen not to join you in your dietary endeavors, this section 
can guide you.
Single vegans must make a choice as to whether they will date nonvegans. 
Speaking from experience, I can tell you that holding an ideal partner in your 
mind while on the search for that certain someone may not always become 
your reality. One night, quite unexpectedly, you’ll meet someone totally fabu­
lous who rocks your world — and then you’ll find out they’ve ordered a steak 
for dinner. For some of us, that’s a deal breaker. For others, love will conquer 
all, and we’ll decide to develop an intimate relationship with our carnivorous 
interest. At least we’ll be helping them be healthier in the end — vegan lovers 
can always get their partner to eat more kale!

249
 Chapter 19: Navigating Tricky Social Situations
If you’re already in an intimate relationship with a nonvegan, keep in 
mind that as time goes on you may have to make sacrifices for each other. 
Consider the value of the other person in your life and how much he truly 
means to you. Everyone has faults, and your food choices don’t make you 
better than anyone else. Many nonvegan partners are happy to eat plant-
based meals at home and then order whatever they like when they’re at 
work, at school, or on the road. Other partners may want to cook meat or 
dairy foods at home, but will most likely be willing to use separate cookware. 
(Chapter 8 provides more information about living with omnivores.)
Occasionally, the love of your life will totally rebel and put up a fuss about 
not being able to eat meat at home. Perhaps the person picks fights on a 
regular basis about your choice to avoid animal foods. He may even sabo­
tage your efforts. These actions show that your carnivorous partner is truly 
scared of change underneath it all. Being clear with each other about what 
this change means for each individual is important. Share your concerns 
about your health and that of your partner. Be honest about your commit­
ment to this style of living. If you find that your best efforts are hampered by 
the other person, it may be time to evaluate the core shared values of the 
relationship.
	
If you’ve been dating a nonvegan and decide to take the next big step and get 
married or move in together, have a conversation about what will be accept­
able in your shared home. Do you not want any meat or dairy in the home? 
Will the vegan allow the nonvegan’s favorite leather easy chair to move in 
as well? Will your children be raised vegan? Cover as many areas of living 
together as you can think of before you make the move. Get it all out in the 
open as early as possible to build an honest, stress-free life together.
Carrying Your Vegan Lifestyle 
to the Workplace
Working 9 to 5 can be stressful enough without the added intricacies of vegan 
politics. So be sure to leave them at home unless someone specifically asks 
you for your opinions or for reasons why you eat a certain way. Creating a 
professional atmosphere at work, in most settings, means staying clear of 
conversations that revolve around politics, religion, and the reasons why you 
shouldn’t eat animal products.
What if you’re really adamant about not wearing leather shoes and acces­
sories, but your office has matching leather chairs for everyone? You can 
consider talking with your employer about your beliefs, concerns, and pref­
erences. You may have access to a more earth-friendly option like fabric or 
wood with an appropriate cushion.

250
Part V: Living Vegan in the Real World 
	
If your employer won’t allow other chairs to be used, don’t lose your job over 
it. Take a nice set of fabric cushions to sit on so you aren’t in direct contact 
with the leather. Keep earning that paycheck and use part of your income to 
fight for animal rights to ease your discomfort.
Similarly, if the company you work for has a cafeteria with no vegan options, 
it’s acceptable to ask that a vegan dish be available — as long as you plan to 
eat there regularly. Be polite, considerate, and have your case well thought-
out before going to human resources or your boss. Offer suggestions and 
resources so you can be part of the solution. Try not to get emotional about 
the subject, because you could wind up presenting yourself as unprofes­
sional. Be sure to have healthy, filling food choices for yourself every day in 
case you aren’t able to find an acceptable meal. Bringing your own lunches 
and snacks from home is often the best option for your health and your 
budget anyway.
	
You should be able to eat whatever you like at work without having to worry 
about the repercussions on your employment status. If you find that other 
people you work with are hazing you or making repeated jokes about your 
food and lifestyle choices, you should stick up for yourself. Tell them that 
you don’t think their jokes are funny and that you want them to stop. Keep 
your responses as professional as you would hope your working environment 
would be. If the behavior continues, you can go to your human resources man­
ager to talk about the harassment. If you work for a small company with no 
human resources department and your boss is participating in the joking that 
makes you uncomfortable, start documenting the incidents. Write down times, 
what exactly was said, and who was present. After you’ve gathered some spe­
cific evidence, you can then calmly present the information to your boss and 
mention that you consider this treatment to be harassment and would like it 
to stop — or else further steps will be taken.

E
very stage of life brings different nutritional needs, but 
all these needs can be met healthily and vibrantly with 
a vegan diet. Babies, nursing moms, and pregnant women, 
for example, have different requirements than a teenaged 
track star or dancer. Even Grandma and Grandpa may start 
noticing that they feel a lot better and have a lot less pain 
when they eat more plant-based foods.
If you aren’t sure how to get all the nutrients you need 
from this “bird food,” this is the part for you. It leads you 
through the various nutritional needs for people who 
require special diets whether due to age, level of physical 
activity, or developmental stage.

otherhood is a wonderful, crazy, bizarre, and magical part of a wom­
an’s life. Each woman and her partner should think ahead about their 
personal views on health and living before welcoming a baby into the world. 
Embarking into parenthood shouldn’t be a light decision. You have much to 
consider, and the health of the baby and mother rank at the top of the list.
Countless women have brought healthy babies into the world while eating a 
vegan diet, so you don’t need to feel like you’re venturing into unknown ter­
ritory. A vegan pregnancy can be extremely healthy, but you need to think 
about several areas of nutrition and self care.
This chapter covers the basics that any vegan embarking into the wild world 
of pregnancy and motherhood needs to know. Proper nutrition before and 
during pregnancy is important, as are the menus for any mama who wants to 
breastfeed her baby. I discuss extreme self care, the issues of proper weight 
gain, and morning sickness. I also give you some tips for taking care of your­
self in the postpartum period.

Early Education and Proper Planning
Preparedness is a skill to be encouraged in anyone about to have a baby — 
heaven knows that once the baby arrives, just leaving the house will require 
packed bags, extra clothes, sunscreen, toys, extra wipes, food, beverages, 
and a Sherpa to carry everything. You and every other expecting woman — 
vegan or not — need to plan ahead for your nutritional and health needs. 
You also need to plan on many people chiming in about everything in your 
life — especially your diet.
	
Family and friends will almost certainly express their concern, either with 
questions or outright demands, about whether a vegan diet is healthy for a 
pregnant woman. Begin to familiarize yourself with the standard nutritional 
recommendations for pregnancy, do your research, and take a deep breath. 
Your loved ones have your best interests at heart, but only you can make the 
right decision for your health and that of your growing child.
In this section, I help you educate yourself and your surrounding friends 
and family about your decision to remain vegan throughout your pregnancy. 
I also emphasize the importance of eating well before becoming pregnant and 
of exercising appropriately during your nine months.
Educating your loved ones 
about your dietary choices
I remember my loving mother-in-law recommending that I should eat some 
meat when I told her I was tired during my third trimester. I tried to explain 
that my exhaustion had more to do with the fact that I couldn’t sleep because 
I had leg cramps, a constant need to go to the bathroom, and a baby that 
kicked incessantly throughout the night. But she still was pretty sure that a 
steak would help me feel better.
	
You can choose one of two paths to a healthy and sane relationship with 
your friends and family during your vegan pregnancy: total silence or calm, 
educated responses. Sometimes you can use a combination of the two. Read 
up, as every mother-to-be does, on the various recommendations for proper 
nutrition. Educate yourself about which vegan foods provide the necessary 
requirements for you and your baby. Be prepared to answer questions about 
protein, iron, and nutrition.
	
Leave books on healthy vegan pregnancy lying around so your aunt and cous­
ins can skim through them during your baby shower or family dinner. Not 
only will the books show your loved ones that you’re doing your homework, 
but they also may ease any of their concerns.

255
 Chapter 20: Pea in a Pod: The Healthy Vegan Pregnancy
Studies have proven several times over that vegan women can and do have 
healthy pregnancies and babies. One of the longest-standing studies on vegan 
pregnancy comes from the Farm community based in Tennessee. Members of 
this group eat a vegan diet and give birth attended by trained midwives. As 
reported in the scientific journal Pediatrics, this group of vegan women has 
a remarkable record of delivering babies of normal, healthy weight without 
the need for interventions or cesareans. Printing out a few studies like this 
can help you and your family feel better about your choice to remain vegan 
throughout your pregnancy.
Your own nurse-midwife or obstetrician may have little experience with 
pregnant vegans, and she may question your choices or even pressure you to 
change your diet. This is another good opportunity to share your knowledge 
with others and dispel the myths that vegans aren’t healthy.
	
Begin keeping a detailed record of what you’re eating so you can show every­
one how good your nutrition actually is. This record can come in handy to 
show your healthcare provider that you’re getting everything you need. You 
may even be able to help other pregnant vegans down the road by showing 
them your nutritional information and recounting your successful pregnancy.
Eating well before you’re even pregnant
Ensuring that you’re getting proper nutrition for yourself before you get 
pregnant is the best way to ensure a healthy pregnancy. So if you know that 
you may want to get pregnant in the next few years, or if you’re actively 
trying to conceive, it would be wise to start eating as if you were pregnant 
now. You don’t want to add the extra 300–400 calories a day required by 
pregnant women if you’re not expecting, but you can eat the proper quality 
of foods to ensure that when your test comes back positive, you’re already 
on the right path.
Imagine finding out that you’re going to have a baby and you’ve been eating 
nothing but nonnutritious, highly processed junk food for years. Jumping into 
a healthy diet appropriate for growing a vegan baby would be a tough shift, 
especially if you start experiencing the fatigue, morning sickness, or weird 
food cravings associated with pregnancy.
	
Not only will you avoid common pregnancy pitfalls by eating healthily before­
hand, but you also can really do yourself and your future baby a big favor by 
quitting smoking and drinking in advance. Some women don’t realize they’re 
pregnant until well into their second month. Drinking one or two alcoholic 
beverages a day while pregnant can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome as well 
as other complications. Smoking during pregnancy, even in the beginning 
trimester, can lead to low birth weight, which is associated with more health 
and behavior problems like stunted growth, diabetes, and low IQ for the baby 
later on.

256
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Vegan foods are naturally high in many of the nutrients pregnant women 
need. Most pregnant women don’t have an ice cream deficiency, but they 
usually need help getting enough iron, vitamins, and folic acid! Get familiar 
with the recommended dietary allowances for iron, calcium, and other nutri­
ents (see Chapter 4) for the average woman who isn’t pregnant. Eat a varied 
diet of whole, fresh, and nutrient-dense foods to prepare your body for opti­
mal health. This diet is the best way to get ready for baby making and ensure 
an easier recovery postpartum for mom!
Get moving, vegan mama! 
Exercise and pregnancy
Some days during your pregnancy you’ll just want to put your feet up and 
sleep the hours away. That’s certainly okay, but keep in mind that regular 
exercise is good for you and your baby. Entering into pregnancy in fine shape 
helps ensure a healthier gestation, and staying physically active throughout 
the nine months will help you on many levels. Most important, exercising 
improves your health, and helps you handle mental stress, which in turn 
improves the health of your baby.
Physically, your body goes through a lot of changes during moderate exer­
cise. You probably shouldn’t do extreme sports or rigorous training during 
pregnancy, but moderate exercises like walking, yoga, Pilates, lifting light 
weights, and swimming can all help you stay in shape.
	
The blood flow to your uterus can change depending on the kind of exercise 
you’re doing. Lying flat on your back isn’t recommended, because it can 
decrease the blood flowing to your baby. Also remember that your body 
needs more oxygen during pregnancy, even when you’re resting, so focus on 
regular, slow and steady exercise. Because your ligaments are looser at this 
time, be careful with any form of exercise; you don’t want to pull or put too 
much pressure on certain joints.
	
Prenatal yoga classes can teach you exercises that help to stretch and 
strengthen muscles that you’ll use during labor. These same exercises can 
help tone the muscles after labor, so you can get your body back into shape 
after the baby arrives. These yoga classes also bring together women going 
through the same remarkable phase of life and can help you create a com­
munity of support. Often the yoga teacher will have been through at least 
one pregnancy herself, and so she may be able to offer assistance with health 
questions you may have.
Emotionally, exercise provides a healthy release for tension or worries that 
you may be stewing over. Pregnancy is an incredible life-changing time, and 
it may bring up worries and concerns that you hold in your body. Use your 
exercise time to really focus on your growing love and your desires for a 

257
 Chapter 20: Pea in a Pod: The Healthy Vegan Pregnancy
healthy baby. Use walking as a meditative time to breathe relaxation into 
your body.
As long as you’re properly hydrated and fed, regular healthy exercise poses 
no risk to your baby’s health. Be sure to drink more water during exercise 
and eat plenty of carbohydrate- and protein-rich snacks. Fueling your body 
with extra, nutritious food should be part of your exercise routine. Any kid 
with a mother who values healthy food and regular exercise will grow up 
better for it!
Eating for Two
Just because you’re eating for two doesn’t mean you can completely throw 
caution to the wind — although being a little bit generous won’t hurt. And 
don’t forget that eating for two doesn’t mean eating for two adults — that 
little bump in your tummy is a very small person!
Your growing baby requires that you consume between 100 and 450 extra 
calories a day. In the first trimester, you only need up to 100 extra calories a 
day, if your morning sickness will allow you to eat that much. In the second 
trimester, the National Academy of Sciences recommends that you increase 
your daily intake by 300 to 340 calories. By the time you’re breastfeeding, the 
increase goes up to a total of 450 to 500 extra calories a day.
Your total calories should be increased even more if you’re pregnant and 
breastfeeding at the same time or if you’re pregnant with more than one baby 
at a time. Every woman is unique and has her own special circumstances, so 
adjust your caloric intake accordingly. Perhaps you work on your feet all day, 
or maybe you’re starting off your pregnancy under- or overweight. Talk with 
your obstetrician, midwife, or doula about your weight gain to get her help to 
ensure a healthy pregnancy.
	
The most important thing to remember is that your extra calories need to 
be nutritionally dense and not empty. Sure, some good-quality dark choco­
late or potato chips are okay occasionally, but they shouldn’t become their 
own separate food group during pregnancy. Instead, use those extra calories 
wisely and focus instead on truly supportive foods. Choose the following, for 
example:
	
✓	Dark, leafy greens and beans for iron, calcium, vitamin K, and folic acid
	
✓	Avocados, nuts, and seeds for healthy fat and protein
	
✓	Seasonal fruits for natural sweetness, antioxidants, and healing vitamins

Nutritional know-how: Getting 
enough of what you need
Now that you’re pregnant (or seriously thinking about getting pregnant), 
you can expect even more questions from nonvegans about your nutrition. 
Become familiar with the important recommendations in the following sec­
tions for folate, protein, calcium and vitamin D, iron, B12, and omega-3 fatty 
acids. Commit these vegan nutrition basics to memory and share them freely 
with others. Be assured that a vegan lady with baby can get everything she 
needs for a healthy, vibrant pregnancy.

Folate and folic acid
One of the first — and most mysterious — nutrients that comes up in preg­
nancy discussions is folate, which is also known as folic acid. It’s mysterious 
because no one seems to know what it is or worry about it until they get 
pregnant. Folate is a B vitamin that’s found naturally in many vegan foods. 
Folic acid is the synthetic form that people take in supplements.

259
 Chapter 20: Pea in a Pod: The Healthy Vegan Pregnancy
This nutrient gets a lot of press because it helps the body produce new cells, 
especially during the rapid cell division and growth of pregnancy. A lack of 
folate can lead to birth defects, but luckily it’s easily avoidable with proper 
nutrition and a well-chosen prenatal vitamin. You don’t want to overdo it 
though, so don’t exceed 1,000 micrograms of folate per day during pregnancy 
and breastfeeding.
Table 20-2 lists some of the best natural vegan sources of folate to help 
you reach the recommended minimum of 400 micrograms per day during 
pregnancy.

Take a vegan prenatal vitamin to ensure you’re getting all the necessary vita­
mins and minerals you need, including folate. Deva Nutrition and Freeda both 
make a complete prenatal vitamin for vegan women.
Protein
Few concerns are more often expressed to pregnant vegans than whether 
they’re getting enough protein in their diets. Most recommendations for pro­
tein hover around an extra 25 grams a day for pregnant ladies. For the first 
trimester, you want to get about the same 45–50 grams a day that you aim for 
when you aren’t pregnant. During the second and third trimesters, just add 
25 grams of protein for a total of between 70 and 75 grams. This level of pro­
tein is easily attainable — even for a vegan. You can either eat larger portions 

260

of the protein you’re already eating, or you can add other protein-rich foods 
that may also help amp up your other nutrient needs, like calcium and iron.
Table 20-3 shows you some easy ways to get an extra 25 grams of protein 
along with some other great nutrients in fell swoop.

Calcium
Getting enough calcium for a growing baby and healthy mom shouldn’t pose 
any problems while maintaining a vegan diet. The current U.S. recommended 
daily allowance (RDA) for pregnant and breastfeeding women above the age 
of 24 is 1,200 milligrams per day. For women under the age of 24, the RDA 
is 1,200 to 1,500 milligrams per day. The World Health Organization recom­
mends similar levels to prevent complications during pregnancy and early 
labor and to promote proper fetal development.
Focusing on healthy sources of calcium, such as leafy greens, tofu, enriched 
soy, rice, or hemp milk, and nuts, grains, and beans, can help you reach your 
daily goal. (Flip to Chapter 4 for a list of vegan foods that supply calcium.) 
And keep in mind that pregnancy likely benefits women by improving calcium 
absorption! Most prenatal vitamins contain some calcium, so talk to your 
medical team to find out whether taking a supplement makes sense for you.
	
Calcium doesn’t work alone; it needs vitamin D. Our lovely bodies not only 
create life and deliver kicking, screaming babies, but they also turn sunlight 
into vitamin D through the conversion of UVB rays. So, pregnant mamas 
should get regular, short doses of sun exposure. A good portion of your skin 
needs to be exposed to natural sunlight, without sunscreen, or safer sun 

261
 Chapter 20: Pea in a Pod: The Healthy Vegan Pregnancy
lamps to create vitamin D. Getting 15 to 30 minutes a day of sunlight either 
in the early morning or late afternoon allows you to produce what your body 
needs without the danger of sunburn. Your body then uses the vitamin D to 
properly absorb calcium. So having enough is imperative.
	
Your body absorbs calcium and iron best when they’re taken separately, 
so plan your vitamins accordingly. Calcium citrate is easier to absorb than 
calcium carbonate, so get a supplement with this form. Take no more than 
500–600 milligrams of either calcium or iron at a time for best absorption.
Iron
Getting enough iron is important to ensure a healthy rate of development 
for your baby and to ensure a strong and energized pregnancy for you. Your 
body is making extra blood for the baby now, so you need more iron than 
ever, about 49 milligrams a day. Focusing on iron-rich foods like dark beans 
and leafy green veggies, as well as a prenatal supplement that contains iron, 
helps make blood production go smoothly.
Most vegan prenatal vitamins provide 100 percent of the iron you need, so 
talk with your healthcare provider about which supplement to take. And be 
sure to include lots of vitamin C–rich foods to help your body absorb the 
extra iron you’re consuming. (To read more about iron, including a list of 
great vegan iron food sources, check out Chapter 4.)
B12
Because every vitamin and mineral is needed in higher quantities during 
pregnancy, it’s no surprise that the B12 requirements are higher too. 
Pregnant and nursing mothers are encouraged to get between 2 and 2.8 
micrograms per day. Focusing on enriched soy foods, nutritional yeast, and 
a good vegan prenatal supplement during pregnancy and breastfeeding can 
help you reach the recommended daily intake.
B12 helps the pregnant mother maintain a healthy nervous system and create 
enough blood for herself and her baby. This vitamin crosses the placenta 
into the baby and is needed to help make DNA and other cell material.
	
Breastfed babies get their B12 through breast milk, so it’s important that a 
vegan mom continues to get optimal amounts of B12 during nursing. That 
way both she and the baby are sure to get what they need. Infants can store 
enough B12 to last 6 months to 1 year from what they get in the womb, so 
optimal intake during pregnancy is key. For more on B vitamins, including B12, 
refer to Chapter 4.

262
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Oils and fats
The oils and fats that build and protect our brains, organs, and eyes are neces­
sary in greater amounts for pregnant women. Essential fatty acids like DHA, an 
important omega-3 oil, are needed by every cell in the body and are sometimes 
referred to as essential oils. In other words, it’s essential that you get them 
from your food! DHA is important for proper fetal and infant development.
Vegans can get these oils, which are often found in high concentrations in 
fatty fish, by eating certain vegetable oils instead. Oils from flax, sesame, 
sunflower, and evening primrose seeds are sometimes combined in vegan 
supplements. Products made from microalgae also are good sources of DHA. 
An added benefit of taking vegan DHA supplements or formulated omega-3 
oils is that you avoid the mercury and other toxins that are found in danger­
ous concentrations in fish.
	
An easy way to integrate certain omega-3-rich oils, like flax, or combination 
oils, like Udo’s DHA 3-6-9, is to drizzle your daily serving on salad, popcorn, 
or soup, or whisk it into nondairy yogurt. Heat damages the health benefits of 
these oils, so don’t cook them.
A word on supplements
Adding well-chosen supplements to your well-
rounded diet ensures that you and your grow­
ing fetus are getting everything you both need 
in the way of nutrients. Take a realistic look at 
your diet and talk with your healthcare provider 
about what you may be lacking. Safeguard your 
and your baby’s health with a few easy vitamins 
and minerals or take an all-inclusive prenatal.
For example, if you’re concerned about your 
iron intake, discuss it with your midwife or 
doctor. Many pregnant women, vegan and 
nonvegan alike, experience anemia during 
their 40 weeks of baby-making duty. You can 
choose from three types of iron supplements: 
iron sulfate or ferrous sulfate, chelated iron 
bisglycinate, and ferrous fumarate. Iron sulfate, 
also listed as ferrous sulfate, can cause upset 
stomach, black stools, and constipation. The 
easier types of iron to digest are called che­
lated iron bisglycinate, ferrous succinate, and 
ferrous fumarate. If you take separate calcium 
and iron supplements, take them a few hours 
apart, because calcium and iron can interfere 
with each others’ absorption.
Similarly, if you aren’t getting sufficient sunlight 
on a daily basis, talk with your healthcare pro­
vider about taking a vegan vitamin D2 supple­
ment. While some orange juice and soymilk is 
fortified with vitamin D, it may not be enough to 
reach the levels required during pregnancy to 
ensure proper calcium absorption.
In general, vitamin and supplement tablets and 
oils should be kept away from heat and sunlight 
and be stored in opaque containers to prevent 
oxidation and breakdown. Liquid supplements 
usually are easier for pregnant women to digest 
and absorb, but chewables seem to be second 
best. If you’re having a difficult time digesting 
whole supplements, feel free to cut them into 
smaller pieces or grind them up and separate 
the entire dose throughout the day. Chapter 
4 provides more detail on choosing vegan 
supplements.

263
 Chapter 20: Pea in a Pod: The Healthy Vegan Pregnancy
Awesome snack list for amazing mamas
Snacking is one of the fun parts of pregnancy — you’re encouraged to do it 
often! Nibbling throughout the day while pregnant can help you maintain a 
healthy weight and avoid heartburn. If you snack on smaller meals through­
out the day rather than gorging on three large meals, your digestion may be 
easier. Snacking also can help you maintain a steady blood sugar rate, avoid 
dizziness, and keep nausea at bay.
	
Choosing nutrient-dense snacks can help you meet your daily require­
ments for protein, calcium, iron, and other vitamins (see the earlier section 
“Nutritional know-how: Getting enough of what you need.” Stock your fridge, 
car, and workplace with several items from this list to snack more healthfully:
	
✓	Cans of low-sodium vegan bean soups
	
✓	Carrot sticks and hummus
	
✓	Dolmas (stuffed grape leaves)
	
✓	Fortified cereal with berries
	
✓	Hemp milkshakes with frozen bananas and cashews
	
✓	Individual boxes of soy, rice, or almond milk
	
✓	Miso broth
	
✓	Mixed nuts and seeds, raw or roasted (try to avoid too many salted 
nuts)
	
✓	Olives
	
✓	Organic fruit
	
✓	Rye crackers with sesame seeds, hummus, and olive tapenade
	
✓	Soy yogurt with organic dried fruit and slivered almonds
	
✓	Toasted nori sheets
	
✓	Whole-grain crackers with mashed avocado and grated carrots
	
✓	Whole-wheat bagel with almond butter and apple butter
	
Eat organic fruits and vegetables during your pregnancy. Pesticides and herbi­
cides linger on conventionally raised produce, and they can travel across the 
placental barrier to your developing fetus.

Discussing the Weighty Issue 
of Weight Gain
Gaining a healthy amount of weight is truly important for your health and 
that of your baby. It’s another subject that may cause you grief as a vegan 
lady who’s got a bun in the oven. Friends and family may worry that you 
aren’t gaining as much weight as they think you should. Many vegan women 
are on the skinny side when they conceive so they may not seem as plump 
as other pregnant women. Whatever you do, don’t let these loved ones guide 
you. The guidelines set forth by government and health agencies should be 
your number-one source. Those guidelines, along with healthy vegan foods, 
can help you maintain a steady, healthy weight gain.
Understanding healthy weight gain
The Institute of Medicine offers reasonable guidelines for U.S. women to aim 
for when tracking their pregnancy weight. Your midwife or doctor can help 
you track your gain and offer advice if you feel you’re gaining too much or 
too little. It’s better for you and the growing babe in your belly if you main­
tain a steady weight gain.
	
During your first trimester, a total gain of about 3 to 5 pounds is considered 
healthy and average. After that, through the second and third trimesters, 
a gain of about 1 pound per week is recommended. However, these guide­
lines all depend on your weight when you started your pregnancy. If you 
were underweight — according to your BMI, or body mass index — you may 
need to gain extra weight, from between 28 to 40 pounds total. If you were 
at a normal weight to begin with, you should gain between 25 to 35 pounds. 
Women carrying twins should gain a bit more weight and continue regular 
visits with their healthcare providers to keep an eye on their weight gain.
	
One-third of women in their child-bearing years are considered obese. Babies 
born to these women have a much higher chance of being insulin resistant 
than babies born to women of a healthy weight. Women who gain too much 
weight also are more likely to need a cesarean section to deliver their larger-
than-normal babies, and they generally have a more difficult time losing their 
pregnancy weight.
Fighting media images of “skinny” mamas
Recent baby booms among celebrities, coupled with the pervasive media 
images provided by paparazzi, have created a new image of the perfectly 
skinny pregnant woman. These women seem to gain just a “baby bump” and 

265
 Chapter 20: Pea in a Pod: The Healthy Vegan Pregnancy
not an ounce more. Within a few weeks after giving birth, they’re seen again 
in a bikini or even modeling underwear on the catwalk. This image can make 
your pregnancy miserable if you try to attain some unnatural, supposedly 
perfect body and weight.
	
Gaining too little weight during pregnancy can cause health problems for 
yourself and your baby. The extra weight you’re putting on is a combination 
of the baby’s weight, amniotic fluid, extra blood volume, larger breasts, and 
a larger uterus. An underweight pregnancy can result in a premature, smaller 
baby who may suffer from delayed development and the increased likelihood 
of heart or lung problems.
Just remember that it’s totally natural to gain weight all over your body and 
get a little puffy. And, despite popular belief, it may take several months to 
lose the weight you acquire during pregnancy. Some women are naturally 
skinny and lose their baby weight quickly. Some don’t. No matter what your 
body type is or how your body responds to pregnancy, it’s more important 
that you’re eating healthy food and providing ultimate nutrition for yourself 
and your growing child. Revel in the amazing power that your body is capa­
ble of, and, if at all possible, avoid any media images of celebrity moms.
Easy Meal Prep and Sanity-Saving Ideas
Pregnancy and modern living are sometimes incompatible. You may need to 
work until a few days before your due date, you may be a soon-to-be single 
mom, or you may already have children to care for. Whatever your situation, 
it can be difficult to maintain a healthy diet during this time. Ordering takeout 
is sometimes an option to save time on cooking and shopping, but restaurant 
food is rarely as healthy as home-cooked meals, and the expense is too much 
to regularly indulge.
	
Use these tips to keep healthy food readily available and easily accessible so 
that meals are more manageable to cook for yourself:
	
✓	Cook once and eat twice (or thrice!). When preparing meals like home­
made soup, pasta, casserole, stir-fry, or curry, make a double batch. Eat 
the leftovers for lunch or save individual servings in the freezer for easy 
reheating later.
	
✓	Start a cooking co-op with vegan friends. Ask friends to cook extra 
servings of their favorite meals and trade once or twice a week. This 
gives you a variety of vegan meals to choose from and it takes away 
some of the prep work.
	
✓	Go to your freezer section occasionally. Freshly prepared foods are 
certainly best, but some great, vegan frozen meals are available for 
those times when you’re just too tired to cook. Choose hearty frozen 

266
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
dishes like whole grains with vegetables and tofu, bean burritos, and 
lasagna. These easy meals offer great nutrition and convenience.
	
✓	Ask a friend to be prep chef for you. After a big shopping trip, ask a 
family member or friend to come and do some of the prep work for you, 
such as washing, drying, and chopping vegetables. Bagging prepped veg­
gies, lettuce, and chopped fruit cuts down on cooking time later in the 
week and provides grab-and-go snacks.
	
✓	Treat yourself to an in-home vegan chef once or twice during your 
third trimester. Hire an expert to come over and prepare a freezer and 
fridge full of meals to get you through the last week of pregnancy and 
the first week of parenthood.
Smart Tips for Common 
Pregnancy Problems
Bizarre issues that you didn’t expect can pop up over the course of your 
pregnancy. Your morning sickness can last all day, as mine did for the first 20 
weeks. Or you may be drinking plenty of water and never feel truly quenched. 
Bizarre food cravings also can take you by surprise.
Starting your pregnancy in great shape is the best way to deal with problems 
that may arise. Playing catch-up to get in shape while pregnant can be tough, 
so think ahead and make your own health a priority before getting pregnant. 
In the following sections, I provide you with some areas to consider and tips 
to help you through the bumpy times of baby bumps.
Staving off pregnancy 
woes with fresh foods
Certain problems can arise during pregnancy, including an uncommon condi­
tion called pica and a pregnancy only form of hypertension called preeclamp­
sia. Luckily, eating a healthy diet of fresh foods can stave off problems.
Pregnant women with pica crave strange, usually nonnutritive foods like dirt, 
clay, or ice. Sometimes this craving is a sign of low minerals or iron anemia. 
If you start craving these or other strange foods, talk with your healthcare 
provider. Even though some of the foods craved during a pica episode aren’t 
dangerous, they may take the place of truly nourishing foods that a pregnant 
woman needs.

267
 Chapter 20: Pea in a Pod: The Healthy Vegan Pregnancy
Preeclampsia is a combination of protein in the urine and high blood pres­
sure that occurs only in pregnancy. Developing after the 20th week of preg­
nancy, the symptoms of preeclampsia include headaches, swelling of the face 
and hands, sudden weight gain, abdominal pain, decreased urine, nausea, 
and vomiting. The causes of preeclampsia aren’t well understood, but one 
study that followed the women who gave birth at the Farm in Tennessee, 
under the guidance of midwife Ina May Gaskin, found a much lower rate of 
this serious condition among these vegan women. They chalk this success up 
to a diet of whole, fresh foods.
	
Choosing whole, natural, freshly prepared foods can help you maintain a 
healthy weight gain and avoid common pregnancy problems, such as pica and 
preeclampsia. Fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, and sea vegetables 
protect your overall health and ensure that your growing baby is getting 
everything he needs.
Taking in plenty of water and electrolytes
Staying hydrated by drinking enough water is a good way to ensure a healthy 
pregnancy. Avoiding caffeinated and chemical-laden beverages like diet and 
regular soda is definitely a good idea. Why expose your growing baby to 
these chemicals?
Electrolytes, which are found in sports drinks, are salts like sodium and potas­
sium. These salts are important for true hydration because they’re used by 
your body’s nerves, cells, heart, and muscles to create and carry electrical 
impulses. Without these salts, your body wouldn’t function at all. Just as 
your body needs more iron during pregnancy, you also can feel relief and 
create better energy by consuming extra electrolytes throughout the day.
	
Sports drinks have a few added electrolytes, but they also come with trouble­
some artificial colors and sweeteners. Natural electrolyte drinks, such as 
young coconut water, are naturally sweet and offer better nutritional support. 
Sea vegetables and natural sea salt also are healthy sources of electrolytes 
and minerals. Naturally sweetened electrolyte concentrates like electroBlast 
are becoming more widely available.
Dealing with food cravings
While pickles and ice cream may not be your normal snack of choice, you 
may crave unusual combinations or develop an obsession with a certain 
food during your pregnancy. You may even suddenly hate certain foods you 

268
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
normally love. Not much scientific study is available covering cravings during 
pregnancy, but we do know that they are natural and normal. For the most 
part, cravings can be indulged moderately. Enjoying a certain texture or taste 
won’t be harmful unless taken to excess.
Your body may be using cravings to tell you that it needs certain minerals or 
nutrients, such as calcium or protein. However, emotional cravings may be 
involved as well. Explore your cravings and get emotional support from other 
moms and pregnant friends. Talking about your fears and concerns with 
understanding listeners can help you release tension, which can decrease 
your desires for unhealthy foods that you’ve been using to sooth your emo­
tions. You’re certainly not alone if you feel overwhelmed or anxious and eat 
certain foods because of it.
	
Dairy and meat cravings during a vegan pregnancy can be disturbing to you, 
especially when you’re working hard to stay on the vegan bandwagon. These 
cravings may signal a need for more iron, calcium, or protein. If you want 
to continue with your vegan diet, you should eat foods rich in those attri­
butes normally found in the food you’re craving. Refer to the earlier section 
“Nutritional know-how: Getting enough of what you need” for the scoop on 
eating vegan foods that provide you with the proper nutrients.
If you’re craving a certain texture, such as creamy, rich, crunchy, or buttery, 
keep in mind that many vegan foods are available to satisfy any of those 
desires. If you’re craving any of the following nonvegan foods, don’t worry, 
I’ve provided some vegan suggestions that are sure to satisfy:
	
✓	Cheese: Air-popped popcorn drizzled with melted vegan margarine or 
olive oil and sprinkled with nutritional yeast flakes.
	
✓	Ice cream: Nondairy ice cream made with soy, rice, or hemp milk.
	
✓	Chicken: Frozen vegan soy “chicken” nuggets, which you can find in 
many health food store freezers.
	
✓	Beef: Cook up some vegan “beef” strips, prepare a rich shiitake mush­
room and bean stew, and add more iron-rich foods to your diet in case 
your body is craving the mineral.
Managing “morning” sickness
I had to laugh when I started feeling morning sickness — all day for weeks 
on end! Some women have no nausea and other women have endless queasy 
feelings no matter what time of day it is. This upset stomach may be accom­
panied with slight headaches, a sour taste in your mouth, and vomiting.

269
 Chapter 20: Pea in a Pod: The Healthy Vegan Pregnancy
	
These symptoms are all normal during the first trimester, but if you can’t eat 
at all or have excessive vomiting, talk with your midwife or doctor. Ask her for 
advice if you seem dehydrated, lose weight, or feel lightheaded. These symp­
toms can all lead to complications if not addressed quickly.
As with everything else to do with pregnancy, each woman is different. 
During this time, you may not be able to stomach some foods that you used 
to love and rely on. And certain times of day may be better or worse for you. 
Here are some tips that can help you get through the yucky times:
	
✓	Eat small snacks and meals more often throughout the day to help your 
sensitive stomach.
	
✓	Keep a plate of plain crackers next to your bed and eat a few if you 
wake up in the middle of the night and immediately upon waking in the 
morning.
	
✓	Avoid upsetting smells like gasoline, cooking food, perfumes, and heav­
ily scented products.
	
✓	Drink small amounts of natural electrolyte beverages, such as young 
coconut water, throughout the day to replenish your salts. (The earlier 
section “Taking in plenty of water and electrolytes” explains more on 
electrolytes.)
	
✓	Stay cool during the day and avoid overheating. Soaking your feet in a 
bucket of cold water can help during summer.
	
✓	Relieve your nausea by eating watermelon and drinking naturally sweet­
ened ginger-lemonade. Fresh mint also is known to calm an upset stom­
ach. Ginger tea, either iced or hot, can be made by steeping freshly cut 
pieces of ginger in water.
	
✓	Exercise moderately and regularly.
	
✓	Keep windows open to keep fresh air inside your home.
	
✓	If at all possible, don’t skip meals, even if you only have a few bites at a 
time.
	
✓	Eat mild foods that are free of excessive spices and flavorings, such as 
plain whole grains, tofu, avocado, or toast.
	
✓	Soothe minor heartburn and upset stomach by drinking 1–2 tablespoons 
of aloe juice. You can mix it into apple juice if you need to.
	
✓	Avoid lying down for at least 15 minutes after eating to allow gravity to 
help your food digest downward.
	
✓	Find your acupressure points on your wrist to help stave off nausea. 
Seeing an acupuncturist also can have benefits.
	
✓	Speak with a homeopath to determine which of the several available 
homeopathic remedies will help with your morning sickness.

Caring for Yourself Postpartum
After your bundle of joy has finally made his or her debut into the world, 
most of the attention will shift from you to the baby. However, it’s important 
to remember that you have just been through a major physical, emotional, 
and hormonal shift. Whether you’re able to begin breastfeeding easily or not, 
had a cesarean birth or a natural one, encountered complications, or made 
it through the labor with no major upsets, it’s very common to experience 
major emotional swings, exhaustion, and disorientation due to a whole new 
life being in your care.
	
Plan ahead and think about how to make your entrance into motherhood as 
smooth and supported as possible. Talk with your friends and family before­
hand to line up assistants to help take care of your older children, cook and 
clean, or even hold the new baby while you take a shower. If your family and 
friends will be helping with meal preparation, be sure to go over vegan menus 
and ingredients to help them cook for you and your needs. There are many 
ways to ensure that you feel supported and cared for as you begin to provide 
for your new baby and grow your family. The following sections will fill you in.
Choosing certain vegan foods for strength
Recovering from childbirth and labor can be a slow process, but having the 
best foods planned in advance offers an easier transition. By having prepared 
foods ready for the whole family, you can avoid temptation to resort to less 
healthy options like takeout and snack foods. Plan to make a few meals that 
can be frozen in the two weeks before your due date. Stock your cupboards 
and refrigerator by going on a big shopping trip shortly before the due date 
as well.
If your partner or husband will be taking over the cooking duties in the weeks 
after the birth, be sure he or she knows how to prepare healthy vegan meals 
that will support your energy needs. The meal-planning chart included in 
Chapter 9 can help to plan the days after your labor.
	
High-energy foods like whole grains, avocados, nuts, and bean soups are filling 
and provide you (and your family) with excellent nutrition. If you lost a lot of 
blood during labor, plan to have more iron-rich foods to replenish your blood 
supply. (Chapter 4 includes a list of foods that can boost your iron intake.) 
Stay hydrated with plenty of water, raspberry leaf tea for uterine health, and 
enriched soymilk for your protein and nutrient intake.

271
 Chapter 20: Pea in a Pod: The Healthy Vegan Pregnancy
Supplying yourself with foods that 
encourage good milk production
If you choose to breastfeed your baby, you need to fortify your body regu­
larly with quality water and food. Continue to consume extra calories every 
day to ensure a steady supply of nourishment for your baby. It can really be 
helpful to keep a glass of water next to you when you nurse.
	
Natural foods that have been used in traditional medicine to promote and 
increase breast milk production are fenugreek, which can be found in special 
tea combinations (check out health food stores), lettuce, dill, caraway, basil, 
marjoram, and millet. Drinking several glasses of mixed soy and rice milk 
a day can be helpful as well. Prepare a millet porridge with caraway seeds, 
sprinkled with marjoram for a delicious dish. Basil, dill, and lettuce combine 
for a simple salad. Basil and marjoram can be added to any Italian dish for 
tasty results.
Certain foods can cause your baby to experience gas and stomach discom­
fort. Little scientific research is available to prove this, but centuries of moth­
erhood experience show that removing these foods can help your baby feel 
more comfortable and even avoid colic. Cabbage, chocolate, coffee, garlic, 
chili, curry, and other spicy foods have been known to affect a mother’s 
breast milk. Some babies show signs of improved digestion when their moms 
stop eating dairy while nursing, which is another good reason to maintain a 
vegan diet. Soy, wheat, citrus, and nuts also can cause stomach problems for 
babies, so try eliminating each food for one to two weeks at a time to narrow 
in on the culprit.
Meeting calorie and other 
nutrient requirements
	
Breastfeeding requires 200–500 extra calories a day and can help you burn off 
that extra weight gained during pregnancy, but you will do well if you’re mind­
ful to continue to eat regular meals of nutrient-rich foods (instead of filling 
up on foods that have empty calories). Just like when you were pregnant, it’s 
important to choose foods that offer good protein, calcium, iron, B vitamins, 
zinc, and other nutrients so both you and your baby get everything you need. 
(See the earlier section “Nutritional know-how: Getting enough of what you 
need” and Chapter 4 to find out what foods provide you with these important 
nutrients.)

Many children develop quite well on a diet of only breast milk past their sixth 
month, and breastfeeding for 1 to 2 years is recommended by most experts. 
This vegan’s son enjoyed “mama milk” until his 22nd month and didn’t have 
an ear infection once during that time. As long as you’re breastfeeding, con­
tinue to supplement your own diet with omega-3-rich oils like flax and healthy 
fats from olive oil, unrefined coconut oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds. These 
oils and fats protect your own health and ensure that your baby gets every­
thing needed for healthy brain and eye development.

tarting your kids on a vegan diet from the very beginning offers them a 
lifetime of healthy habits and benefits. What a person eats in her first 
few years can set her eating habits for life. So offering your children a healthy 
diet of various whole, plant-based foods will ensure that they grow up 
healthy and loving their veggies.
This chapter discusses infant and toddler nutritional needs. By covering the 
various ways to feed babies and toddlers, I show you that you have healthy 
vegan options and that cruelty-free menus offer a terrific, nutritious diet. 
Babies and toddlers can receive complete nutrition from a vegan diet, and a 
little planning and creativity can make the job of vegan parenting easier and 
more successful.
Nourishing Your Newborn
Because a new baby’s digestive system is still quite immature and sensitive, 
for the first six or so months, nutrition is pretty straightforward: You should 
provide either breast milk or formula.
A baby is designed by nature to be breastfed. Vegan mamas who are able to 
nurse their kids naturally need to ensure that their milk is rich, ample, and 
providing the necessary nutrients (see Chapter 20 on postpartum nutrition 
and care). Not every woman can breastfeed successfully, however, and some 
babies have a difficult time suckling. Luckily, vegan mothers who aren’t able 
to breastfeed their children can provide healthy nutrition by using various 
plant-based formulas. This section discusses the ins and outs of both breast­
feeding and formula feeding.

274
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
	
Whether you’re breastfeeding or using formula, if you notice that your infant 
is experiencing rash or low or no weight gain, talk with your doctor about pos­
sible food allergies. Cow’s milk products are the most common foods known 
to upset a nursing baby, but other foods also may cause a negative reaction. 
Depending on how sensitive your baby is, and how much of the problematic 
food you ate, the reactions may be mild to severe. Rash, eczema, wheezing or 
asthma, ear infections, fussiness, colic, and constipation or diarrhea are all 
possible signs of sensitivity. It may take a little time and some detective work 
to discover a sensitivity. Food reactions can occur within a few minutes or 
over the course of a 24-hour period. If you notice a pattern of feedings and 
reactions, start writing down what the baby ate or what you ate before nursing 
the baby, and what the reaction is. Talk about the pattern with your midwife, 
doula, lactation consultant, or doctor.
Breastfeeding: So perfectly vegan!
The female breast is designed to provide milk for the human baby. The first 
milk women produce is immunity-building colostrum, which pregnant women 
start producing late in their pregnancies. Easy to digest and high in carbo­
hydrates and protein, colostrum is also low in fat, making it the perfect first 
food for a baby. This rich milk is full of the mother’s antibodies, which help 
a mother share her stronger immune system with a baby (who hasn’t yet 
developed its immunity). Your body will provide the exact nutrients your 
baby needs for proper growth and development — an example of how amaz­
ing the human body truly is!
	
Because breastfed babies receive vitamin B12 through milk, vegan moms 
should remember to supplement appropriately. Vegan babies still need vita­
min D2 (D3 is made from animal ingredients), which can be produced through 
daily sun exposure or supplementation of 5 micrograms a day. Once the baby 
starts eating solid foods, be sure to include legumes and whole grains to pro­
vide the zinc necessary for proper growth and development.
How long should I breastfeed?
The longer you’re able to breastfeed your baby, the better. The American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends nursing your child for at least 
one year, and the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) both recommend at least two years. Why? More 
than 100 components contained in breast milk protect babies from infections 
and disease. Many studies prove that significant health risks arise for both 
the mother and child if breastfeeding doesn’t occur. Breastfed babies have 
fewer incidents of ear infections, allergies, diarrhea, and possibly asthma 
than formula-fed babies.

275
 Chapter 21: Bouncing Baby Vegans
The good news about vegan moms is that most of us tend to breastfeed our 
babies — well into their first year, and even into their second year. Consider 
this: Up to 60 percent of all mothers in the U.S. nurse their babies in the hospi­
tal immediately following the birth, but only 25 to 39 percent of those mothers 
are still breastfeeding at 6 months. Some vegan communities like the Farm in 
Tennessee, on the other hand, report breastfeeding rates of 95 percent. This 
amazing fact shows that vegan mothers are pretty hip to the outstanding ben­
efits of mother’s milk. They realize that it trumps all other options.
	
Prepare for successful breastfeeding by choosing a pediatrician who is pro-
breastfeeding. Ask how they support new mothers who have difficulties 
nursing and whether they recommend formula as a last resort. A lactivist, or 
pro-breastfeeding pediatrician, should also have a certified lactation consul­
tant to recommend to you should you need more expert help.
I’m having trouble with breastfeeding — now what?
New breastfeeding moms often become concerned about their infant’s 
growth because they can’t tell how much their baby is taking in. Also, 
formula-fed babies often put on weight faster from ages 6 to 12 months, lead­
ing some people to believe that breastfed babies aren’t getting enough milk. 
To make things worse, many growth charts provided to pediatricians and 
doctor’s offices haven’t taken into account the differences in weight gain 
between formula-fed and breastfed babies, leading some parents to feel pres­
sured to switch to formula to help their baby gain weight faster. Even though 
“breast is best,” many doctors have unwittingly been complicit in pressure to 
wean too early or to supplement with formula due to the misguided and mis­
informed focus on weight gain.
Luckily the World Health Organization has collected data from around the 
world to help develop a new set of international standards and growth charts 
for infants and children through the age of 5 years. The new charts were cre­
ated using growth information on both exclusively and predominantly breast­
fed children, and can be found at www.who.int/childgrowth/standards.
Breastfeeding benefits for mama
Breastfeeding isn’t just a great choice for baby; 
moms receive plenty of health benefits, too. 
Lactation causes the mother’s uterus to con­
tract to its original size after expanding during 
pregnancy. Breastfeeding also reduces a wom­
an’s risk of developing breast cancer, osteopo­
rosis, and ovarian and uterine cancers later 
in life. Nursing also helps her lose the extra 
weight gained during pregnancy.
Breastfeeding provides the perfect opportunity 
for the new baby and mother to connect on a 
deeper level as well. A newborn infant can only 
see objects 12 to 15 inches from its face — the 
distance to its mother’s face while nursing. 
This constant visual contact allows a baby and 
mother to imprint each other’s faces.

276
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Besides concerns over baby’s weight gain, most women are tempted to stop 
breastfeeding because it’s painful (usually due to improper latch) or because 
they don’t feel comfortable with the functional aspect of handling their 
breasts. Women’s breasts have become overly sexualized in our culture, so 
some moms are uncomfortable nursing in public. Plus infants require milk 
every two to three hours, and that can be exhausting for a new mother. 
	
If you haven’t decided whether to stick with breastfeeding, try it for a few 
weeks before switching to formula (it’s very difficult, if not impossible, to 
change back to breastfeeding from formula-feeding). Get expert help and sup­
port through your local La Leche League or hospital-sponsored breastfeed­
ing support group. The lactation consultants are trained to help guide you 
through the learning stages of nursing — even though breastfeeding is natural, 
it doesn’t always come naturally. They can also help you if you begin to feel 
postpartum depression.
Thinking about formula as a last resort
If you’re a vegan who’s considering formula for your baby, you should know 
that at this time you can’t buy commercially made organic, vegan infant 
formulas. Several soy-based formulas contain no dairy but aren’t vegan due 
to the added vitamin D3, which comes from animal sources. Baby’s Only 
organic soy-based formula is widely available but isn’t 100 percent vegan.
Considering using another mom’s milk
If breastfeeding is not going well for what­
ever reason, another alternative is to search 
out mothers who have extra breast milk that 
they’re willing to share with you. Using another 
woman’s breast milk is preferable to many 
vegan women who would prefer that their chil­
dren not be exposed to highly processed cow’s 
milk formula or refined soy products at such 
an early age. You have two options within this 
“borrowed” milk model:
	✓	You can casually share milk with a mom 
you know and are comfortable with. You 
may even find other vegan moms who are 
willing to pump extra for you, although a 
nonvegan mom is preferable to canned 
formula.
	✓	You can contact the Human Milk Banking 
Association of North America (www.
hmbana.org) to see whether your baby 
qualifies to receive donated milk. This group 
connects parents all over the country who 
need milk for their babies with prescreened 
human milk supplies.
	
	 Donated milk offers your baby the won­
derful immunity and disease prevention 
that your own milk would have provided. 
It’s a useful and safe way to help moth­
ers who have postoperative problems or 
infection diseases that stop them from 
breastfeeding.

277
 Chapter 21: Bouncing Baby Vegans
	
Your baby has to eat, though, and if breastfeeding just isn’t possible for you, 
the soy-based formulas are certainly acceptable alternatives. Your little one 
can be 100 percent vegan a little later on in life.
	
Soy and rice milk aren’t the same as soy and rice formula. These milks that 
you may use on your cereal don’t contain the proper nutrition for babies to 
thrive. And while you can find some recipes online for homemade formula, 
which can be made with vegan ingredients, no studies have been performed 
to discover the long-term effects of these homemade formulas, which may not 
provide the required fats, protein, and calories for infants.
Also, toxins could be lurking in toddler and infant formulas, so it’s wise 
to research the manufacturing and packaging of each product. The major 
organic soy and dairy formulas claim that hexane, a volatile solvent used to 
manufacture some of their ingredients, isn’t present at all in the final product. 
Still, parents worry that any product made with a dangerous chemical isn’t 
healthy for their children. Similarly, canned foods, including formula, may 
contain Bisphenol-A (BPA), a resin used in packaging materials. Overexposure 
to BPA can be harmful to an infant’s reproductive system and can alter hor­
mone levels. Even organic formulas can be packaged in containers with BPA. 
Liquid formula tends to leach higher amounts of this chemical, so it’s safer to 
choose steel cans of powdered formula.
Starting Older Babies on Solid Foods
After your baby reaches the age of 4 to 6 months, you may decide to start 
offering him food in addition to breast milk or formula. Not only must the 
baby’s digestive system evolve slightly to allow for some food, but the baby’s 
mouth muscles also need to develop enough to move food around and swal­
low. Around 4 to 6 months, your little one also will begin to hold up his head, 
developing stronger neck muscles for swallowing as well as sitting up with 
some help. These milestones are all important on the way to solids.
Current recommendations state that the main source of calories should be 
coming from breast milk or formula until a child is at least 6 months old. 
Some parents decide to wait until their child is even older, perhaps not intro­
ducing solid food until he’s 8 to 10 months old. As long as your baby is still 
gaining weight and meeting developmental milestones, you have no reason 
to start feeding your baby solid food too early. Whenever you and your baby 
are ready, this section is here to help.
	
Even though your baby may be ready to begin trying some solid foods, hold 
off on introducing any type of milk. The American Academy of Pediatrics rec­
ommends that cow’s milk not be fed to children under the age of 1, because it 
can cause digestive problems and allergies. As a vegan, you aren’t likely to be 
buying cow’s milk anyway, but you still need to hold off on giving your baby 

278
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
soy or rice milk until after they’re 1 year old. Stick to breast milk, formula, or a 
bit of water to wash down solids for now.
Slow and steady wins the race
If your little vegan has reached those pivotal milestones of development and 
starts grabbing for your dinner, you can start experimenting with different 
foods. Take it slow and introduce foods one at a time. Experts have several 
theories about which foods are best to serve first, so you can simply go with 
what makes the most sense for your little one.
	
Choose only one food at a time, giving each a trial of a few days. For instance, 
feed your baby a few mashed spoonfuls of avocado a couple of times a day 
for up to a week. If the baby has no noticeable reactions, try mashed banana 
the next week, on its own. If she still has no reactions, you can move forward 
in this manner with a different food every few days. If your baby has a reac­
tion to any certain food, you know not to use it again for a while. Keep in 
mind that if you were to make a mash of several foods at once and the baby 
reacted, you wouldn’t know which food was the culprit. So always introduce 
one food at a time.
Deciding what and how to 
feed your growing baby
What should you choose for your baby’s first solid foods? Iron-fortified rice 
cereal is a popular first food for vegan and nonvegan babies alike. Rice is a 
great first grain because it rarely causes digestion problems, is gluten-free, 
and is low in protein. These rice cereals can be mixed with a little breast milk 
or formula to make a thin gruel. You can use your finger or a spoon to tip the 
cereal into your baby’s mouth.
	
Miniature wooden or bamboo spoons are excellent choices for your infant’s 
first feeding tool. Rather than relying on plastic-coated spoons, which can chip 
off microscopic bits into your baby’s mouth over time, try bamboo, which is 
totally natural and nontoxic. These spoons can be found in most health food 
stores, natural baby stores, and online.
Some health experts have expressed concern that starting babies off with a 
refined carbohydrate cereal can lead to food sensitivities and obesity later 
on. Other experts state that introducing grains actually prevents these same 
issues. Clearly the jury is still out, so the choice is yours. Iron fortified grain 
cereals are often recommended as a first food since baby’s iron reserves 
start to decline after 6 months.

279
 Chapter 21: Bouncing Baby Vegans
If you would rather choose a fresh whole food, try mashed organic natural 
foods for the first forays into eating. Ripe, mashed avocado or bananas are 
easy on the digestive system for most kids. Natural, unsweetened apple­
sauce, mashed sweet potatoes, or ground whole grains like millet are other 
options. You may prefer serving mashed vegetables first to encourage your 
babe to develop a taste for healthy veggies before being exposed to sweeter 
fruits.
Buying baby food in jars or frozen containers is an option, but it isn’t neces­
sary. Before the mid-1800s “baby food” didn’t exist — infants just ate what­
ever mom and dad were eating in a mashed up form. Most babies around the 
world are still fed like this today; it’s cheaper and generally easier (and more 
environmentally friendly) than buying hundreds of little jars of premashed 
food. If you do need or choose to buy baby food, choose an organic variety.
	
You can use a fork to mash your own meal into a paste. Just be sure to remove 
anything spicy or otherwise difficult for a baby to digest. Low-cost baby food 
mills that grind your adult food into a consistent paste are available online, at 
health food stores or at larger children’s mega-stores. These mills are easy to 
clean and transport.
Watch Them as They Grow: 
Food for Toddlers
Toddlers develop their personalities quicker than you may expect — they 
express their likes and dislikes for foods with no reservations. After the 
explosive growth that most babies experience, the slowing weight gain of tod­
dlerhood can cause a decrease in appetite. When this decrease in appetite is 
coupled with a child’s innate pickiness, you can easily become frustrated. But 
don’t allow this to upset you — most parents experience a similar situation. By 
simply offering the healthy choices and nutritious snacks that I discuss in this 
section, your vegan kid will eventually develop great eating habits and tastes.
	
Don’t give up on the greens! Most kids need a new food introduced 12 to 20 
times before they accept it. Keep cooking healthy foods, show your kids you 
enjoy them, and don’t force your child to eat something in the beginning.
	
After your baby’s first birthday, you can begin to wean him off of formula and 
switch to fortified soymilk or toddler formula. If you choose fortified soymilk 
for your toddler, be sure that the variety you choose has appropriate levels 
of fat, calcium, protein, and vitamins D, B2, and B12. For babies who are 13 
months and older, Toddler Health brand offers organic rice- and oat-based 
nutritional drink mixes that contain no soy, gluten, or dairy. But they still con­
tain animal sources of vitamin D. Be sure to discuss your child’s growth with 
your healthcare provider to help guide your decision.

280
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Choosing nutrient-dense foods over fiber
The nutritional needs of toddlers are similar to your own, but they’re scaled 
to their smaller body sizes. They need a good variety of healthy fats, protein, 
calcium, iron, B12, vitamin D, and all the other minerals and nutrients that 
adults require.
	
Vegans tend to eat more fiber than the average person, which is great for 
adults. The problem with vegan toddler food is that kids can fill up on fiber 
thereby crowding out other valuable nutrient-rich foods. Because kids have 
smaller stomachs, it’s easy for them to fill up with fruit and whole grains. So 
ensure that your child is getting enough nutrition by focusing on nutrient-
dense foods like avocado, nut and seed butters, enriched whole-grain prod­
ucts, and enriched soy or hemp milk. To safeguard against strong reactions 
to a nut or seed allergy, avoid these foods until after the age of 2 if there are 
similar allergies in your family. If you would like to introduce nut and seed but­
ters before the age of 2, talk with your pediatrician about testing a single seed 
butter first for any reaction. Keep track of your child’s growth and weight gain 
to make sure she’s getting enough calories and nutrition.
Choosing healthy fats also is important to guarantee proper growth and 
development. Aim for 1.1 grams of omega-3 fatty acids a day by adding flax­
seed, hemp, and vegan omega-3 oils into your child’s food.
Quieting the naysayers
Be prepared to hear questions and concerns 
from your family and friends that a vegan diet 
won’t be sufficient for your growing guy or gal. 
To reassure your well-intentioned loved ones, 
offer these morsels of truth:
	✓	Several studies suggest that vegan chil­
dren’s’ growth rates are more gradual than 
nonvegans. These children often grow slowly 
at first, and then they catch up later on. The 
ultimate adult heights reached by vegan chil­
dren are comparable to those of nonvegans.
	✓	Children who grow up without dairy in their 
diets have less diarrhea, less gas, and less 
constipation.
	✓	Dairy-free kids have less of a chance of 
developing type 2 diabetes, several child­
hood cancers, and heart disease.
	✓	Vegan children have fewer problems with 
acne and eczema and encounter fewer 
cases of asthma.
	✓	A Harvard study from 2000 showed that 
diets relying heavily on animal protein were 
shown to produce earlier onset of menstru­
ation in girls by 3 to 8 years of age.

 Chapter 21: Bouncing Baby Vegans
Outsmarting finicky eaters
	
The most frustrating thing about kid’s tastes is that they change — often. 
What they like for lunch one day is “yucky” the next. Here are some tips for 
presenting healthy foods in a way that entices your little one to eat enough 
without driving you too crazy:
	
✓	Let your little vegan help in the kitchen by dumping premeasured items 
into a bowl, stirring a pot, or putting napkins on the table. By “helping” 
to prepare a meal, children get excited to eat the finished dish.
	
✓	Offer several small bowls of different food items. Studies have shown 
that when given lots of healthy choices, kids will most likely make a 
healthy meal for themselves.
	
✓	Make food fun by creating faces out of veggies on his plate, using fruit as 
decoration, or setting steamed broccoli in mashed potatoes as trees. Get 
creative!
	
✓	Stick with it and continue offering your little guy healthy foods. Experts 
have shown that a new food can be introduced 12 to 15 times before a 
kid will accept it.
	
✓	Don’t force the issue. If your child won’t eat one meal, don’t make a fuss 
out of it. As long as he has access to healthy snacks throughout the 
day and takes in a variety of foods over the course of several days, he’s 
likely going to get what he needs.
	
✓	Monkey see, monkey do! Setting a good example and loving your own 
veggies and healthy food makes good habits natural for the whole 
family.
	
✓	Sneak those healthy greens in by pureeing cooked kale, broccoli, or 
spinach and mixing it into pasta sauce, soup, or even smoothies.
	
✓	Don’t become a short order cook! Make a variety of foods that kids can 
choose from and let them decide how much of which foods they will eat.
Satisfying your little snacker
Snacks tend to make up a hefty portion of the toddler diet. A small stom­
ach and constant play makes little ones hungry for small, frequent meals. 
Choosing healthy, safe snacks is important and can be your key to proper 
nutrition, even if mealtimes are frustrating.
	
Ensure your child’s love for healthy foods by offering fresh fruits and vegeta­
bles every day. Even if she doesn’t eat them every time, she’ll become accus­
tomed to seeing them and will choose them more often in the future. Here are 
some excellent nutrient-dense foods that toddlers and preschool-aged kids 
will love:

282
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
	
✓	Whole-grain or enriched pasta with blended kale marinara sauce
	
✓	Oven-baked sweet potato fries
	
✓	Soy yogurt mixed with 1⁄2 teaspoon flaxseed oil
	
✓	Hemp milkshake blended with nut butter and flaxseed oil
	
✓	Sunflower seed butter and jam sandwiches
	
✓	Raisins and chopped dried apricots
	
✓	Pancakes topped with almond or sunflower seed butter and apple butter
	
✓	Udon noodles with tahini sauce
	
✓	Cucumbers or flax crackers with nut cheese or tofu dip
	
✓	Carrot and zucchini muffins
	
✓	Mashed potatoes and vegan gravy
	
✓	Bagels spread with nut or seed butter or mashed avocado and hummus
	
✓	Pudding made from soaked and drained raw sunflower seeds that are 
blended into a paste with raisins or dried apricots and fortified hemp or 
soymilk
	
To avoid choking hazards when providing snacks to your toddler, be sure to 
do the following:
	
✓	Finely grind nuts in a spice grinder or blender instead of offering whole 
or coarsely chopped nuts.
	
✓	Spoon out half-teaspoons of nut butter rather than large globs.
	
✓	Chop vegan hot dogs into pea-sized bits.
	
✓	Quarter or halve cherry tomatoes, olives, grapes, pitted cherries, and 
any other large, round foods.
	
✓	Grate raw carrots into shreds rather than offering small chunks.
	
✓	Avoid popcorn and gum until the child is older.

Vegan Diets for Kids, 
Tweens, and Teens
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding what the experts think of vegan diets for kids
▶	Discovering kid-friendly vegan food choices
▶	Ensuring proper nutrition for all ages and stages
▶	Setting a solid foundation for healthy eating for life
▶	Helping kids deal with commercial and media messages
▶	Ensuring that kids eat well when away from home
R
aising vegan children from infancy is pretty easy with a little education 
and planning. On the other hand, transitioning children, tweens, and 
teens from the standard American diet can be more difficult, especially if 
they’ve grown accustomed to dairy, meat, and processed snacks and meals.
You don’t need to worry when it comes to nutrition for kids; whether they’re 
active athletes or cerebral book worms, vegan kids can and do get everything 
they need for proper development. The research is in, and experts agree 
that vegan kids are healthy and avoid many common health problems. The 
trick to raising a child vegan is doing it in a kid-friendly way and avoiding the 
common pitfalls.
Exploring strategies and shopping and cooking tips for families who decide to 
go vegan is the goal of this chapter. I discuss what to do when your kids will 
be traveling away from home, and I help you deal with shopping and media 
messaging. Arming kids with proper nutrition and the information to back 
up their decision to go vegan prepares them for a successful vegan life in the 
modern world.
	
This chapter covers the topics of nutrition and health benefits of a vegan diet 
for people between the ages of 3 and 19. This group of humans has the most 
to gain from living vegan — a lifetime of health and responsible action.

Is a Vegan Diet Safe? 
The Experts Weigh In
Gathering scientific proof on the safety and health of a vegan diet is easy — 
numerous studies and books detail the benefits of this style of eating. 
Experts — from the old-school professors to the cutting edge 
researchers — have been giving a well-balanced vegan diet for children rave 
reviews for years.
For example, second only to the Bible in terms of worldwide sales, Dr. 
Benjamin Spock’s classic book Baby and Child Care is on most parent’s 
shelves. Most people don’t know it, but Dr. Spock went vegan in his later 
years — and he recommended it for children, too. After seeing his own 
chronic bronchitis disappear at the age of 88, Dr. Spock began to research 
this miracle diet and came to realize that a dairy- and meat-free diet would 
offer optimal nutrition for the children he was famous for writing about.
Similarly, Dr. Neal Barnard, the head of the Physicians Committee for 
Responsible Medicine (PCRM), recommends a vegan diet for children as a 
way to avoid serious health problems now and in the future. PCRM, which 
says that about one-third of American children are lactose intolerant or 
have a dairy allergy, advocates for vegan meals and dairy alternatives in the 
nation’s school lunch programs. Dr. Barnard, a prolific author and speaker, 
presents research proving that kids of all activity levels can get the protein 
and nutrition they need from a plant-based diet.
These doctors and health gurus recognize the benefits of a vegan diet for 
children and teens, and they have done the legwork to prove it. Now it’s up 
to parents and children to do the smart and tasty thing — go vegan!
	
A vegan diet based on a variety of whole foods ensures that a child’s daily 
nutritional requirements are met and protects the health of that child for her 
entire life.
Understanding normal growth rates
Don’t assume that vegan kids will be scrawny and poorly developed. They 
may be skinnier than the other kids in class, but considering the obesity epi­
demic in the United States, this trimness is probably good. Vegan children 
turn out just fine when offered a healthy diet. Just because your kid doesn’t 
eat cheeseburgers doesn’t mean he won’t be able to play basketball — vegan 
kids grow tall too!

285
 Chapter 22: Vegan Diets for Kids, Tweens, and Teens
	
If you need some scientific proof, consider the following:
	
✓	A 1988 study by T.A. Sanders published in the American Journal of 
Clinical Nutrition showed how a group of vegan kids raised in England 
grew up just fine. These kids were actually taller than the other children 
studied and weighed just slightly less. You can search the journal’s 
archived articles for vegan studies at www.ajcn.org.
	
✓	A study in Pediatrics (the official journal of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics) from 1989 revealed wonderful results from vegan children at 
the Farm community in Tennessee. Most of the more than 400 kids who 
were raised vegan from birth were slightly shorter than normal between 
the ages of 1 and 3, but by age 10 their heights had all evened out. Visit 
pediatrics.aappublications.org to search the journal’s archived 
articles for this vegan study and many others.
Most American pediatricians, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, use a standard set of growth charts to determine whether a 
child’s growth is within the standard healthy trajectory. These charts have 
been used for years and have been updated according to shifting popula­
tion information. However, all contain one fatal flaw: Every child is different. 
Tracking your child’s height, weight, and head measurements can help you 
determine the rate at which they’re growing, but you need to take many fac­
tors into account to get a true picture. These current charting standards 
don’t tell you how much a child should grow to ensure a healthy life; they 
only describe how they’re growing in comparison to the average child.
While these standard growth charts are somewhat useful, they also can 
cause unnecessary concern. Some kids hit growth spurts later than others. 
It’s helpful to know the possible medical causes, such as hyperthyroidism, 
food allergies, kidney problems, and growth hormone deficiency, for a child 
being shorter than expected. However, if a child’s parents are short, the kid 
will likely be shorter as well.
	
The bottom line is this: There are healthy kids, vegan and nonvegan alike, who 
fall within the “normal” rate of growth on doctor office charts. There also are 
kids who fall below and above normal. If you have concerns that your child’s 
growth has slowed or stopped, talk with your healthcare provider about the 
possible factors. You’re the parent, and you know more about your children 
than anyone — trust your intuition. If you notice that your child is experienc­
ing any developmental delays or that he’s withdrawing, lacking energy, or has 
lost his appetite, it may be time to talk with a medical professional.

286
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Looking at a new kind of growth chart
In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its Child Growth 
Standards. The first charts of their kind, these standards show that children 
born anywhere in the world, Amazonian Pygmies aside, can grow into the 
same range of weight and height no matter their upbringing.
These new charts were based on a years-long study, which began in 1997. 
This study showed that, given healthy conditions and proper nutrition early 
in life, children from countries as diverse as Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, 
Oman, and the United States show similar growth patterns.
Taking into account that the children followed over the course of this study 
included every kind of religious, ethnic, and nutritional background, it goes 
to show that vegan children develop into healthy teens and adults the world 
over. For the first time, these growth charts show how children should grow 
for optimal health rather than just describing how they’re growing compared 
to the average child. To discuss these WHO charts with your doctor, print 
one at www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/en/index.html.
Discovering a Bounty of Choices 
for Your Little Vegan
Your kid’s vegan menu can and should offer more variety than her omnivo­
rous classmate’s. Creating breakfast, lunch, and dinner to mimic what 
“normal” people eat is simple. Your family may be worried that a vegan 
lunch will draw stares or unwelcome comments in the cafeteria, but that’s 
uncommon — and it can be avoided if it does happen.
	
Plan ahead and do a little research into what the natives are eating at school 
and at birthday parties. For instance, is pizza being served as the hot lunch 
item on Friday? If so, make a vegan pizza for dinner on Thursday and send a 
few slices as leftover lunch. To help your kid feel included at the next birthday 
party, find out what food the host is offering. Purchase or make a vegan ver­
sion of that party food and have your kid take it with her. Colors, shapes, and 
sizes are important here: Ask whether the pizza will be cut into squares or pie 
slices. If nonvegan cupcakes will be the treat of the day, send your child with 
vegan cupcakes (rather than baking a full cake). The idea is to help your little 
vegan blend right in.
In this section, I provide you with some information on choosing kid-friendly 
meals and snacks for your growing vegan.

287
 Chapter 22: Vegan Diets for Kids, Tweens, and Teens
Offering kid-friendly vegan fare
American kids eat little real food these days. A normal day includes many 
highly processed junk foods, some disguised as being healthy. Breakfast may 
be cereal with hidden sugar, frozen pastry strudels, and even soda or other 
caffeinated beverages. Lunch will likely contain chips, more soda, cookies, 
french fries, and perhaps a burger or hot dog. Dinner with the family often 
means a fatty and heavily salted and sweetened fast-food meal purchased 
from a drive-through. When parents offer choices like these for their chil­
dren, kids will take them up on it.
	
If you want your kid to eat healthy foods, you should only offer appropriate 
choices. Provide real foods for every meal and eliminate the processed junk 
food entirely. They may complain at first, but most kids won’t starve them­
selves. Stock up on whole grains, low-sodium canned soups, fresh fruit, and 
healthy snacks. If you only offer healthy foods, your kids will begin to eat (and 
willingly choose) those healthy foods whether you’re around or not. However, 
keep in mind that some kids are picky, and it can take up to a dozen times for 
a new food to be tasted and enjoyed.
Here’s a sample list of kid-friendly vegan meals that most parents can whip 
up whether they went to culinary school or not:
	
✓	Baked potato fries with fruit juice-sweetened ketchup
	
✓	Baked potato with steamed broccoli and either olive oil or vegan cream 
cheese
	
✓	Barley and vegetable soup
	
✓	Burgers, hot dogs, and sandwich slices made of tofu and other meat 
substitutes
	
✓	Grilled soy cheese sandwiches
	
✓	Oatmeal with apples and cinnamon
	
✓	Pancakes spread with almond butter and pure maple syrup
	
✓	Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (try ’em grilled, too!)
	
✓	Rice and beans with a side of salsa and guacamole
	
✓	Romaine lettuce salad with cherry tomatoes
	
✓	Sautéed seitan with mashed potatoes
	
✓	Spaghetti with tomato sauce (mix in some cooked lentils for extra protein)
	
✓	Spinach lasagna
	
✓	Vegetable stew
	
✓	Veggie pizzas with vegan cheese and shredded zucchini
	
✓	Waffles with fresh or frozen berries

288
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
	
If your child has been raised on chemically flavored foods, it may take him a 
little while to appreciate the more subtle tastes of real, whole foods. Have a 
discussion with your kid and explain the serious ramifications that his diet is 
having on his health, mood, and future. Ask for his opinions and concerns. 
Whatever you do, don’t make sweeping changes to the family menu without 
first discussing your reasoning behind it. If you’re straight with your child, 
perhaps he’ll see the value in what you’re attempting and can help make the 
transition easier by participating more fully.
Dealing with kids’ snack attacks
Most kids love to snack, and they can develop really scary food habits by 
relying on sugary, salty, and fatty offerings. Kids will still have access to 
unhealthy snacks when they’re outside the home, but if you provide them 
with some of the following healthy options, they’ll start making better 
choices most of the time:
	
✓	Applesauce sprinkled with ground cinnamon
	
✓	Brown rice pudding made from leftover brown rice mixed with black­
strap molasses, hemp or soymilk, cinnamon, berries, or raisins
	
✓	Calcium-fortified apple or orange juice
Excitotoxins in your meals and snacks
Important foods to avoid are those that contain 
excitotoxins, chemical flavorings and preser­
vatives that are added to processed foods. 
Common excitotoxins include MSG, food col­
oring, aspartame, and flavoring systems used 
by fast-food restaurants and packaged-food 
producers to addict consumers to their brands. 
Avoid any foods that contain these chemicals, 
because they can result in brain damage with 
excessive exposure. Baby food and children’s 
snacks should be screened closely, because 
young brains are much more sensitive to 
damage from these additives. As you’re study­
ing ingredient labels, look for these key words, 
which indicate hidden excitotoxins:
	✓	Autolyzed yeast
	✓	Calcium caseinate
	✓	Corn oil
	✓	Hydrolyzed oat flour
	✓	Hydrolyzed plant protein
	✓	Hydrolyzed protein
	✓	Hydrolyzed vegetable protein
	✓	Malt extract
	✓	Malt flavoring
	✓	Monosodium glutamate
	✓	Plant protein extract
	✓	Sodium caseinate
	✓	Textured protein (including TVP)
	✓	Yeast extract

Making Sure Your Growing Vegans Are 
Getting the Nutrition They Need
Every day seems to bring new growth to a child’s mind and body. One day 
she’s asking to hold your hand and play with you in the sandbox, and the 
next day she’s boldly running off with her friends. Because each developmen­
tal stage brings new challenges, both physical and emotional, it’s wise to plan 
ahead for the nutritional needs of your child.
Consulting traditional food charts isn’t especially helpful for a vegan family. 
The amount of space taken up by meat and dairy on these guides is really 
large. Instead, rely on this section, which provides sound food options to 
ensure that your growing vegan family has access to all the food groups it 
needs.

Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Including the four vegan food 
groups in your kid’s diet
Relying on the USDA food pyramid hasn’t created a healthy nation. We die 
earlier and are sicker and more overweight than previous generations. Our 
children need a healthy food guide that takes full advantage of the best foods 
Mother Nature has to offer.
	
The healthy food groups to include in a vegan diet are
	
✓	Fruits
	
✓	Seeds, nuts, beans, legumes, and soy foods
	
✓	Vegetables
	
✓	Whole grains
These general guidelines include plenty of healthy fats from vegetable oils 
like olive, sesame seed, canola, and unrefined coconut oils. Also important 
are omega-3-rich oils like flaxseed oil. Natural fats also can be derived from 
nuts, seeds, avocados, nondairy milk, and nondairy yogurt.
Be sure also to include a source of vitamin B12, such as a typical children’s 
multivitamin or vitamin-fortified cereals or soymilk.
The nutrition experts at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, 
or PCRM, have put together an outstanding outline for directing food choices 
for kids, tweens, and teens. See Table 22-1 for a rundown of these choices.

Cow’s milk and other dairy products contain calcium that kids need for grow­
ing bones, but plenty of natural vegan foods also are rich in this mineral. Beans, 
grains, greens, vegetables, seeds, and nuts can supply everything your child 
needs for ultimate nutrition and proper growth. If cows can get their calcium 
from greens to grow big and strong, so can humans. Table 22-2 lists the calcium 
requirements for children (amounts are the same for both males and females):

The human body absorbs calcium more efficiently from vegetables than it does 
from cow’s milk products. Eating 100 calories of bok choy gives your body 435 
milligrams of calcium, or 53 percent of the total available calcium. Drinking 100 
calories of skim milk gives your body 107 milligrams of calcium, or 32 percent 
of the total available calcium. You obviously get some calcium with the milk, 
but you get more from the bok choy — and you also get the fiber, chlorophyll, 
iron, and other minerals available from this delicious green.

Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Chapter 4 provides a list of vegan foods that are great sources of calcium. Be 
sure to give your child a variety of these foods so he can reach the proper 
calcium requirements for his age group.
	
Ensure the bone health of your growing child, tween, or teen by eliminating 
all sodas from his diet. Most sodas, diet and regular, contain phosphoric acid. 
This acid has been shown in studies to deplete bones of their calcium. When 
the body is overly acidic, it leaches calcium out of the bones to alkalinize the 
blood. Strong evidence suggests that girls who drink more soda are more 
prone to fractures and broken bones. The soft drink industry vehemently 
denies that soda has anything to do with bone health, but parents should 
draw their own conclusions. You can offer your kids many other healthier bev­
erage options, including calcium-fortified juices and vegan milks, iced herbal 
teas, and plain ol’ water.
Iron’s in it: Fitting iron into kids’ menus
Growing kids need iron-rich food to ensure consistent energy levels and 
healthy blood production. Table 22-3 provides recommendations for how 
much iron kids need at various stages. Include in your child’s diet items from 
the list of iron-rich vegan foods in Chapter 4.
	
Because girls in their tween and teenaged years are likely to be having their 
menstrual cycles, they require more iron starting at menarche, or their first 
period.

Iron-containing foods that also contain a source of vitamin C, which enhances 
the body’s ability to absorb the iron, are the best kind. And kids often like 
these options (without knowing their health benefits). Broccoli is one of these 
perfect foods. You also can pair foods to gain the same effect. For example, 
pair black beans with tomato salsa for a burrito topping or dip for tortilla 
chips. Or blend tomato sauce with steamed kale for a great pasta dish.

293
 Chapter 22: Vegan Diets for Kids, Tweens, and Teens
If necessary, children also can take a daily, chewable vitamin that ensures 
that their iron and mineral intake is sufficient. VegLife and Freeda both make 
good vegan chewable vitamins for kids.
Emphasizing the power of protein
Growing bodies need protein to create muscle, build blood, do work, and 
repair tissues. Luckily, protein deficiency is extremely rare. A varied diet can 
help everyone in your family meet their daily protein requirements, including 
the kids, tweens, and teens. Use Table 22-4 to create family-friendly menus 
based on your family’s changing protein needs.

Focus on offering a variety of protein-containing foods throughout the day, 
and your kid’s body will accumulate all the amino acids it needs to create 
complete proteins. Daily doses of whole-grain products, different kinds of 
beans or legumes, and a variety of nuts, seeds, and soy foods all ensure that 
your child meets her protein needs. Flip to Chapter 5 to see a list of vegan 
sources of protein.
Gaining essential vitamins and minerals 
from food
Vegan kids need the same vitamins and minerals that adults need. They may 
need a bit more or less at certain stages and ages, but a well-balanced, whole-
food vegan diet and proper life habits provide them what they need.

294
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
The following vitamins are needed on a regular basis for proper development:
	
✓	Vitamin A: Colorful vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes, kale, and 
spinach are great sources of vitamin A. The body uses this vitamin 
for eye and bone health, growth, and reproductive functions, just to 
name a few.
	
✓	Vitamin B12: Red Star Vegetarian Support nutritional yeast, fortified soy 
or hemp milk, and vegan multivitamins are all reliable sources of B12.
	
✓	Vitamin C: This is one of the vitamins vegans don’t have to worry much 
about. Fruits and veggies are the best sources of vitamin C, which aids 
the body in absorbing iron, increasing immune function, and repairing 
tissue. Papaya, red bell peppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and count­
less other fresh vegan foods provide this useful vitamin.
	
✓	Vitamin D: You can find this vitamin in fortified vegan foods. Getting 
regular doses of sunlight keeps your vitamin D levels high.
	
✓	Vitamin E: Almonds, avocados, hazelnuts, olive oil, safflower oil, sun­
flower seeds and sunflower seed butter, and wheat germ all supply good 
quantities of this antioxidant-rich vitamin.
	
✓	Vitamin K: This vitamin is found in green leafy vegetables, parsley, avo­
cados, and kiwi fruit. Because it’s a fat-soluble vitamin, sautéing greens 
with olive oil or another fat helps the body use the K better.
Besides vitamins, you also need different amounts of minerals, such as cal­
cium, iron, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulfur, manganese, 
copper, iodine, zinc, cobalt, and selenium. These minerals are necessary for 
countless bodily functions every day. A varied diet of whole grains, beans, 
nuts, seeds, vegetables, and fruits provides what kids’ growing bodies need. 
To ensure a wider and more plentiful source of minerals, start using more sea 
vegetables like nori, kelp, kombu, or dulse in soups, casseroles, salads, and 
grain dishes. These vegetables are excellent sources of trace minerals.
	
Because some kids may not adhere to the best eating habits every day (or 
while they’re out of your sight and control), offering a daily vegan multivita­
min is good health insurance.
Encouraging Kids to Eat Healthily
Children who begin living vegan from day one will probably have less trouble 
sticking to the game plan. If you’re transitioning to vegan living after kids’ 
taste buds and attitudes are well formed, however, it may be more difficult to 
convince them to participate.

295
 Chapter 22: Vegan Diets for Kids, Tweens, and Teens
No matter what situation you’re in, this section provides you with tips on 
easing your growing family into veganism. I include lists to help you stock up 
your pantry, sample menus, and information on how to encourage participa­
tion from everyone.
	
Some kids go through periods of smaller-than-normal appetites. It’s impor­
tant not to force your kid to eat everything on his plate. Creating struggles 
around eating specific portions of vegetables, beans, or whole grains can 
cause children to rebel against the healthy food habits you’re trying to instill. 
If you consistently offer only healthy foods at home, they’ll eat enough of 
what they need.
Easing kids into enjoying a vegan diet
Creating a healthy environment at home is a must if you want your family 
to adopt better eating habits. Removing the junk food, meat, and dairy from 
your house can be done in consistent steps to make the transition easier and 
more subtle. As you run out of cheese, meat, and eggs, replace them with 
nondairy substitutes.
For example, if your family eats scrambled eggs for breakfast, try making a 
tofu scramble every other day until the eggs are gone. I include a recipe for 
Hungry Man (or Woman) Tofu Scramble in Chapter 12.
	
To ensure that your kids sign on to the healthier eating style that you’re sug­
gesting, make sure everyone is held to the same rules and expectations. Kids 
don’t respond well to rules that are only directed at curbing their behavior. 
In other words, if you’re allowed to have chocolate chip cookies after dinner, 
they should be too.
Here are several ways to help your children live vegan with less protest:
	
✓	Allow your kids to splurge (veganly) every once in a while. Many cities 
host pastry shops, ice cream parlors, or coffee shops that offer vegan 
treats. By visiting these special places once or twice a month, your kid 
will be excited about his new diet. Holding your son’s birthday party at a 
vegan restaurant and preplanning a spectacular cake and treats will help 
your child feel “normal.” Plus he’ll have the added benefit of introducing 
delicious vegan foods to his friends.
	
✓	Encourage your family to do some research on famous vegans. Going 
to a concert performed by a famous vegan (or group of vegans) like 
Moby, Fiona Apple, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, or André 3000 can help 
your kid feel proud of his lifestyle. Renting movies with vegans like 
Woody Harrelson, Daryl Hannah, James Cromwell from Babe, or Casey 
Affleck also can help kids feel cool and represented.

296
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
	
✓	Take your family to a farm animal sanctuary or other animal rescue 
shelter. Doing so offers your child an opportunity to talk about animal 
rights, cruelty-free living, and vegan food. You don’t need to graphically 
detail the horrors of what happens to animals, but sharing a loving con­
nection with animals solidifies the reasons for not taking advantage of 
other creatures.
	
✓	Plan ahead to ensure that your home is an easy, fun place for your 
children to get the food that they need and love. Offer delicious vegan 
alternatives to old favorites. Remind them that they can eat something 
fun because it is vegan. Stock your pantry with lots of great, healthy 
foods, and allow everyone in the family some say in what’s available.
	
	Making kid-friendly meals out of healthy ingredients isn’t as challenging 
as it sounds; you can make veganized versions of thousands of favorite 
nonvegan recipes. (Check out Chapter 10 for more information on veg­
anizing old favorites.)
Keeping a well-planned and well-stocked 
pantry and fridge
Offering healthy snacks and meals at home is the first step in creating a life­
time of great eating habits for kids, tweens, and teens. If you don’t have junk 
food in the house, your children will have to work much harder to get it. 
And sooner or later they’ll instead opt for the natural flavors that are readily 
available.
By providing constant access to fresh, healthy treats, you’re offering a valu­
able lesson in how to plan and succeed in being a healthy vegan. Use these 
guidelines to help stock your kitchen:
	
✓	Whole grains, including brown rice, quinoa, millet, and oats, need to be 
stocked regularly. These are filling go-to products when time is scarce.
	
✓	Whole-grain flours like whole-wheat pastry flour, buckwheat flour, 
brown rice flour, and cornmeal help you whip up special healthy treats 
for your little vegans.
	
✓	Nuts and seeds, including almonds, cashews, pecans, walnuts, sunflower 
seeds, sesame seeds, and pumpkin seeds are protein-filled snacks that 
kids can reach for any time. Nut butters help make healthy snacks even 
tastier.
	
✓	Beans and legumes can be dried, frozen, or precooked in cans. Keep 
a selection of different types on hand, including black beans, kidney 
beans, chickpeas, lentils, white beans, peas, edamame, soybeans, and 
green beans.

297
 Chapter 22: Vegan Diets for Kids, Tweens, and Teens
	
✓	Fruit should be plentiful and fresh. Offer a variety of seasonal whole 
fruit. To encourage kids to eat it, always make it available either washed, 
dried, and in a bowl on the counter or cut up in a fruit salad (which is 
always accessible in the refrigerator for snacking). If kids come to you 
hungry for a snack, send them to the fruit bowl!
	
✓	Vegetables can be frozen or fresh. Cutting up a variety of raw veggies for 
snacking — cherry tomatoes, jicama, bell peppers, carrot sticks, celery, 
and cucumbers — offers a healthy treat for hungry children.
	
When searching for whole-grain products to stock your kitchen, use these 
criteria to make the smartest choices:
	
✓	Focus on fiber. Cereals and breads should have 5 grams or more of fiber 
per serving.
	
✓	Bring in the bran. Even though bran cereals and wheat germ aren’t offi­
cially whole grains (because they’re missing the endosperm of the grain), 
they’re still an excellent healthy option for filling up hungry tummies.
	
✓	Grab some granola. Make your own muesli (see Chapter 12 for a home­
made recipe) or granola and keep it on hand. These snacks allow you 
to incorporate more whole grains easily into your child’s diet. If time 
is short, you can find excellent naturally sweetened, organic granola in 
health food stores.
	
✓	Search out the hidden sugars. Minimize the sugar in your kid’s diet by 
choosing whole-grain products that don’t include any sweetener or that 
are sweetened with blackstrap molasses, agave, or brown rice syrup.
Promoting equal participation when 
feeding the family
Every member of the family can help plan menus and shopping lists. Ask 
each person to participate in filling out a weekly menu chart found in Chapter 
9. After you figure out which ingredients you need, your kids can help you go 
through your cupboards and refrigerator to see what should be added to the 
shopping list.
	
Children as young as 2 or 3 years old can help plan meals in this way. If they’re 
asked what they want, help in the planning, and participate in the shopping, 
kids are more likely to be invested in the meals after they’re prepared. This 
method works really well over time to help children understand what’s neces­
sary in feeding a family. Life skills like these are invaluable and sadly lacking in 
many young adults. By training your kids early on how to plan, shop, and pre­
pare healthy meals, you’re ensuring that they experience a lifetime of health.

298
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
If your family is vegan and your teen wants to eat meat or dairy products, 
you can accommodate everyone. Be aware that consuming occasional 
animal foods can cause stomach problems, gas or indigestion. Providing only 
healthy foods at home, as well as one or two high-quality, organic nonvegan 
items may be a good alternative to forcing your kid to leave the house and 
get the less nutritious foods that she desires. (Flip to Chapter 8 for more 
information on coexisting with nonvegans.)
Cooking in the kitchen with the kids
Start cooking with your kids at a young age to ensure that they’re comfort­
able preparing meals. It’s one of the most important life skills any human can 
develop. Kids as young as about 2 years old can start helping with meals by 
picking out fruit at the grocery store, pouring premeasured ingredients into a 
bowl, or stirring and whisking recipes with adult supervision.
Every person in the house can help plan a menu and participate in some way in 
its creation. By looking through recipe books, writing a shopping list, going to 
the grocery store and farmer’s market, and preparing the meal with you, your 
young person will have a vested interest in each healthy, vegan meal he eats.
As kids get older, they can take more responsibility in the kitchen and help 
more with cooking meals. Tween-aged kids can even get involved with food 
on a more intimate level by helping to grow a few herbs or vegetables in the 
garden. Even a potted tomato plant can be a wonderful source of pride for a 
young person.
Media Watch: Teaching Your Kids to 
Decode the Messages
Our kids may as well have big bull’s-eyes on their backs when it comes to 
advertisers. Tweens and teenagers are two of the most desirable target mar­
kets, leading most global brands to have a “tween strategy.” The average 
American kid is exposed to more than 100 media messages and commercials 
a day from television, radio, billboards, magazines, and the Internet. We live 
in a consumer culture, and the effects on children are maddening.
In this section, I help you deal with this advertising. I show you how to develop 
a healthy media strategy for your home by linking the vegan ethics of cruelty-
free living with the commercial messages that children are inundated with. 
Uncovering the hidden costs of all those advertised foods and products can 
help everyone in your family be mentally and physically healthier.

299
 Chapter 22: Vegan Diets for Kids, Tweens, and Teens
Deflating kids’ commercial interests (or at 
least explaining what they see)
Parents’ best efforts to get their kids to eat healthy foods like broccoli and 
beans are frustrated by commercials and advertisers. Commercials for foods 
aimed at kids are mostly for junky, processed snack foods, not natural, 
healthy items. Sodas, chips, and candy are sold in brightly colored, anima­
tion-adorned packages. Lettuce is not. It’s a tough battle when Shrek is shil­
ling Twinkies instead of green beans.
	
By making it clear to your children, even at a young age, that these pack­
aged snack foods aren’t healthy, aren’t vegan, and aren’t an option, you can 
raise a more savvy child. Keep in mind that I said “more savvy,” not perfect. 
They may still ask for these foods when they see friends with them. In these 
instances, talk with your kids about what advertisers are doing — selling 
unhealthy food to make money. My mother’s rule was “if you see something 
on TV and ask for it — you’ll never get it!” She stuck to it, so we never did.
Decoding eating disorders
Dieting to lose weight has become an epidemic 
in our modern culture — and with good reason. 
We’re one of the fattest, most unhealthy coun­
tries on earth. However, pre-teens and teenag­
ers are especially vulnerable to the family and 
media messages about the benefits of being 
thin, and their behavior can have dangerous 
consequences. For example, anorexia, which 
affects mostly young girls and women, is an 
eating disorder where the person stops eating 
and loses an excessive amount of weight. They 
do this because they’re overly concerned about 
their body shape and “getting fat.”
Teenagers may choose to adopt a vegan diet 
for many reasons. Animal rights are one of the 
top concerns of these young people, and health 
may be another issue. The American Dietetic 
Association (ADA) has expressed the opinion 
that vegan and vegetarian diets could be more 
prevalent among anorexic teens because they 
offer a way to hide eating disorders. However, 
the ADA states that being vegan (or vegetarian) 
doesn’t cause people to become anorexic.
While eating a vegan diet doesn’t in itself lead 
to eating disorders, a tween or teen who’s con­
stantly dieting and decides to go vegan may be 
using this new diet as a way to further restrict 
her calories. Keep an eye on the child’s health 
and appearance. If you feel that she’s devel­
oping an eating disorder, seek the advice of a 
trained professional.
For the health of your entire family, it’s wise 
to avoid overt media images from magazines, 
television, and movies that push the idea that 
being thin is the only way to be beautiful and 
loved. Find healthy images of women, including 
athletes, confident public figures, and female 
leaders, to populate your home. Being too far 
overweight can be unhealthy, but loving your 
body no matter your size is the best attitude to 
maintain.

Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Eliminating the pressure of the press
Sadly, peer pressure and marketing messages are powerful in getting kids to 
second-guess themselves. Many studies reveal that children and teens feel 
better about themselves when they buy certain products that they see on 
television. The pull to own items that their friends already have is so strong 
that kids will badger their parents dozens of times for a single item until they 
give in and buy it for them.
	
Vegan kids will be less likely to pressure parents for items if they understand 
the relationship between products and animal welfare. A company that sells 
a game or toy may be the same company that tests makeup on animals for 
its other products. Most junk food items in advertisements aren’t vegan and 
contain dairy, meat, or gelatin products. If a processed snack happens to be 
vegan, it’s most likely made by a company that uses nonvegan ingredients in 
its other foods. Help your kids see the links between their purchases and the 
health of the environment and the animals they love.
Coming up with responsible responses 
to media-induced panic
Make your home a healthy haven away from advertising by teaching your 
kids how to question the messages they see. Talk about them together. When 
you see a beloved character like Shrek, the Simpsons, or Spider Man selling 
junk food, help your child call or write the company to complain that you 
don’t like the way they’re doing business. Take a stand for your child’s health 
by working together to stop these insidious practices.
	
Get involved with your child to create positive changes in his everyday life. 
School lunch programs can be improved and advertising messages can be 
removed from the classroom. The USDA has created a program called Fruits 
& Vegetables Galore: Helping Kids Eat More to help school food-service teams 
create healthier lunches. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine 
has resources available on its Web site about making healthy eating easier 
and more accessible to kids. Visit www.healthyschoollunches.org/
resources/parents.cfm to take a look at these resources.
Creating game nights, dinner party nights, or other themed events for the 
family keeps the TV off and the media at bay. According to a 2003 poll by 
the nonprofit group The New American Dream, 57 percent of kids aged 9–14 
would rather do something fun with their parents than go shopping. The 
point is this: Find creative ways to spend time together that don’t require 
shopping, money, or television.

301
 Chapter 22: Vegan Diets for Kids, Tweens, and Teens
Taking Care of Your Children 
When They’re Away
Parents and kids aren’t together 24/7 — and thank goodness for that! When 
school, trips, and sleepovers are on the calendar, it’s time to think ahead 
and make some strategic decisions. As the old adage goes, “If you fail to plan, 
you’re planning to fail.” Going away from home as a vegan kid requires more 
forethought to ensure that nutritional needs are met.
The strategies in this section can help to make time away from home easier 
and more stress free for your little vegan. Parties, away games, and competi­
tions can all be healthy adventures with a little preplanning.
Planning ahead
When your child is going away from home, whether it’s for a day of school 
or an out-of-town event, it’s important to plan ahead. For daily school plan­
ning, it’s as easy as packing a lunch with a couple extra snacks and a juice 
box. For longer weekend trips or special events, you need to find out more 
information. Ask where your child is going, for how long, what meals will be 
provided, who else is going, and what the group’s expected schedule is.
	
Many events and trips can be successful for vegan children if they have a 
packed cooler of snacks and sandwiches. If your child will be staying over­
night with access to a kitchen, send a vegan frozen entree in the cooler with 
ice packs.
Some kids love to try new things, and others want the comforts of home 
while they’re away. A lot of these feelings depend on age. An older teenager, 
for example, may feel confident enough going to dinner in another state 
with her soccer team. She can look at a restaurant menu and pick out vegan-
friendly options or ask the server to help. However, because they aren’t yet 
making their own decisions, younger kids need prepared meals for the trip. 
Either way, make sure to pack lots of extra snacks and some fun foods that 
your kid loves. Placing a package of vegan cookies, muffins, or homemade 
banana bread in your child’s bag will ensure that she has a nice time.
Touching base with chaperones
If your kid is going away without you, talk with his chaperones well before­
hand. Make sure these chaperones understand what a vegan diet is, and find 
out as much as you can about planned mealtimes and locations.

302
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
	
If your child’s group will be stopping at a specific restaurant while on a trip, 
call ahead and speak with the manager about preparing your child a vegan 
dish. Keeping everyone in the loop will ensure that your growing vegan has an 
excellent experience.

The Vegan Athlete
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the macronutrient requirements for active vegan athletes
▶	Getting enough vegan sources of iron and other important minerals
▶	Maintaining healthy nutritional choices now and in the future
T
he human body can attain incredible levels of fitness on a vegan diet, and 
hundreds of competitive and professional athletes prove it. For instance, 
Carl Lewis, the nine-time Olympic Gold Medal track star, is often quoted saying 
“My best year of track competition was the first year I ate a vegan diet.”
Visiting a gym or professional sporting event doesn’t usually bring to mind 
beans and vegetables. “Meat head” is a term more often given to weight lift­
ers and their thick physiques. People committed to working hard physically 
to attain personal records, running at the top of their game, lifting more, and 
pushing their bodies to the ultimate edge of endurance can and do thrive on 
vegan diets.
Transitioning to a plant-based diet as an athlete can bring many benefits as 
well as a few challenges. Raising a vegan child who wants to participate in 
any type of sport — from tennis, swimming, and soccer to running, football, 
or ballet — should present few problems with proper planning. This chapter 
addresses the various nutritional hurdles that a vegan runner, or any other 
sports star, may encounter.
Macronutrients for Strength and Stamina
Whether running, biking, playing with a ball, or stretching to yogic nirvana 
on a daily basis, athletes need to include healthy meals as part of their train­
ing and avoid foods that can decrease stamina. Proper snacking and quality 
foods will improve your energy levels and physical ability, and still maintain 
your body’s ability to fight off disease.

304
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
	
Every athlete’s training should include vibrant, naturally energizing foods that 
help build the body’s muscle and stamina. To create this kind of energy, the 
body needs macronutrients — protein, fats, and carbohydrates — in proper 
amounts. In the following sections, I give you the lowdown on each of these 
macronutrients that athletes need. Head to Part II for more on the nutrient 
requirements for nonathletic vegans.
Powerful vegan protein for performance
The World Health Organization has stated that a vegan diet can provide all 
the protein humans need during every phase of life. And that’s a good thing, 
because our bodies use protein to do all sorts of things, including making 
muscle, repairing tissues damaged during training, and building healthy hair 
and nails. Protein, of course, also is used as energy.
Vegan athletes need extra protein to keep up with their active lifestyles. 
These increased protein needs can easily be met, however, by adding more 
of the same great protein-containing vegan foods already found in the normal 
vegan diet.
Meeting these daily amounts is easy, and exceeding them for muscle building 
and more strenuous workouts isn’t a problem. Following are some recom­
mendations, depending on your level of workout:
Standard: 1.0–1.2g/kg
Endurance 1.2–1.7 g/kg
Power/speed 1.2–2.0 g/kg
Early training 2–2.3g/kg
By choosing larger portions of protein-rich meals, vegan athletes can meet 
their needs. Eating a protein-rich snack every few hours can help the body 
recover from regular, strenuous workouts.
	
Natural vegan foods that are rich in protein include the following:
	
✓	Bean burgers
	
✓	Black bean chili
	
✓	Hemp seed butter
	
✓	Hummus on whole-rye crackers
	
✓	Mashed potatoes smothered with vegan baked beans
	
✓	Mixed nuts, seeds, and dried fruit

305
 Chapter 23: The Vegan Athlete
	
✓	Peanut butter and jelly on whole-grain bread
	
✓	Seitan kabobs grilled or baked with vegetables
	
✓	Soy or hemp milk
	
✓	Tempeh burgers
	
✓	Tempeh cubes in vegetable stew
	
✓	Vegan baked beans on whole-grain toast
Fueling your muscles with fat
Vegan athletes need to include high-quality plant sources of fat in their diets. 
The body uses fat to cushion organs, lubricate joint movement, and carry out 
the thousands of operations needed to jump a hurdle or throw a ball. Eating 
too little fat while training can lead to muscle fatigue, and fat is needed to uti­
lize certain vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals.
One of the ways the body uses fat during exercise is to save carbohydrates, 
which are used up as energy first, in longer workouts. Endurance sports 
or long training exercises actually increase the ability of muscles to use fat 
for fuel. This doesn’t mean that a vegan athlete needs to pile on the oil to 
increase fat intake; even leaner athletes have enough fat stored in their tis­
sues to meet their needs.
To shake or not to shake: Some thoughts 
on protein powders and bars
Athletes of all ages use protein powders as 
a way to bulk up and meet their daily protein 
needs. You have many vegan options if you 
choose to add a powder to your diet. Drinking 
a smoothie with a scoop or two of soy, hemp, or 
rice protein added can ensure that your body 
has the protein it needs to build muscle and 
recover from hard workouts.
Soy powders contain more grams of protein per 
serving, but many people want to avoid using 
too much processed soy in their diet, because 
a vegan diet can already rely heavily on soy 
foods. Hemp is considered by many to offer the 
best plant source of protein, because it also 
offers a higher amount of complex carbohy­
drates and quality fats. Rice protein powders 
tend to have fewer calories per serving and 
can offer another choice if you want to switch 
things up in your morning smoothie.
Note: Although uncommon with a vegan diet, 
too much protein in your diet can lead to dehy­
dration and can be converted into fat. Watch 
your protein intake by keeping a food diary.

Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Eating a high-fat diet can result in the burning of more fat during exercise. 
However, this diet would ultimately limit the amount of carbohydrates the 
body can store and use. Because carbohydrates are the easiest form of fuel 
for the body to use for energy, a high-fat diet can end up limiting an athlete’s 
endurance.
	
Vegan athletes should stick close to the normal recommended daily allow­
ances for fat for nonathletes. Fat should comprise less than 30 percent of your 
total caloric intake.
	
Selecting high-quality vegan sources of fat ensures that the body gets what 
it needs. In fact, vegan sources of fat also offer two-for-one benefits, such as 
protein from nuts and seeds and anti-inflammatory properties from flaxseed 
oil and olive oil. Avocados offer a powerhouse supply of good-quality fat while 
also offering needed nutrients and minerals like potassium, vitamins C and K, 
folic acid, copper, sodium, and fiber.
Taking in carbohydrates for endurance 
and brain power
Whether you need to run away from a leaping lion or throw the winning pass, 
carbohydrates fuel your forward motion. Playing an important role in giving 
your body and brain the power needed to complete the multiple movements 
and reactions during training and competing, complex carbohydrates are the 
best fuel for athletes.
The body stores carbohydrates as glycogen, an easy-to-use form of glucose or 
sugar, in the liver and muscles. During workouts the body taps the reserves 
of glycogen in the liver to maintain blood sugar levels, which keep the brain 
and nervous system in working order. If you want to stay sharp and keep 
your mental agility in tiptop shape, eat a diet rich in complex carbohydrates.
	
Focus on eating enough complex carbohydrates, as opposed to simple ones 
like refined sugar and white bread, to ensure that you have a steady supply of 
fuel for endurance and repetitive strenuous training exercises. If you don’t eat 
enough carbohydrates to replenish the stores that are used up during each 
workout, you’ll burnout and experience fatigue more quickly.
When getting ready for a big event, focusing on complex carbohydrates 
to build your body’s supply of easily accessible fuel is helpful for another 
reason: Because these foods are digested easily and absorbed into the blood­
stream, you avoid a heavy stomach or indigestion during the main event.

307
 Chapter 23: The Vegan Athlete
Including complex carbohydrates in your diet is so easy as a vegan that you’ll 
have a head start over your competitors. Choose items from this list on a 
daily basis to ensure you can go the distance:
	
✓	Beans
	
✓	Corn
	
✓	Lentils
	
✓	Muesli (see Chapter 12 for a homemade recipe)
	
✓	Peas
	
✓	Potatoes
	
✓	Udon noodles found in the Asian food aisle
	
✓	Whole, fresh fruit rather than fruit juice
	
✓	Whole grains, including brown rice, oats, millet, quinoa, barley, and 
wheat
	
✓	Whole-grain flour products, including multigrain, yeast-free breads; high-
fiber breakfast cereals; whole-wheat pastas; and wheat bran
	
✓	Yams
Many exercise experts recommend that serious athletes aim for a diet com­
prised of 50 to 70 percent of total calories from complex carbohydrates.
	
Avoid simple carbohydrates like refined sugar, white breads, and white pasta. 
While they may supply a quick fix of energy, they don’t last as long as the com­
plex carbohydrates and can lead to faster burnout. Not only will you hit the 
wall faster if you eat more refined carbohydrates, you also won’t be getting 
the other essential nutrients that complex carbohydrates provide, such as 
vitamin C, protein, and fiber.
Pumping Iron . . . and Calcium 
and Other Minerals
Those tiny, trace minerals that the average person needs for daily living 
are even more important to an athlete. You can’t pump iron if you don’t eat 
enough iron to produce healthy blood. And strong bones for contact sports 
need a diet rich in healthy calcium sources. Despite popular belief, you don’t 
need meat and dairy products to get iron and calcium. (Refer to Chapter 4 for 
more on getting iron, calcium, and other minerals into your diet.)

308
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Maintaining healthy blood 
with vegan iron sources
Vegan athletes need to consider their iron needs carefully. According to the 
National Institutes of Health, iron needs may be 30 percent greater in those 
who engage in regular exercise because their blood needs to have proper 
levels of iron to aid in the transport of oxygen to the tissues. To keep training 
regularly and maintain consistent performance, healthy iron levels are key.
If you start feeling lethargic or your times or performance start to decline, 
consider having your iron levels checked out by a doctor. Vegan iron supple­
ments are available to help make up the difference, but natural vegan sources 
of iron-rich foods should be a daily part of your training regimen.
	
Because it takes the body some time to recover from anemia, it may be useful 
to have a simple blood test before you begin training to accurately gauge your 
blood iron levels, red blood cell size, and iron storage. Iron overdose is very 
serious, so always have a blood test before taking a supplement.
Vegan sources of iron that athletes should include in their daily diet are
	
✓	Beans and legumes, including black beans, lima beans, lentils, and 
kidney beans
	
✓	Blackstrap molasses
	
✓	Dried fruits, including prunes, raisins, and apricots
	
✓	Iron-enriched whole-grain cereals
	
✓	Leafy greens like spinach, broccoli, kale, collards, and dandelion greens
	
✓	Seeds such as almonds and Brazil nuts
	
✓	Tofu
Female athletes especially need to be careful of their iron levels and daily 
intake. Amenorrhea, or the temporary loss of menstruation, is a relatively 
common concern for female athletes — vegan and nonvegan alike. In 
September 1999, David Nieman published a study in the American Journal 
of Clinical Nutrition that showed low calorie intake, not the vegan diet itself, 
was the major cause behind female athletes developing amenorrhea. In short, 
eating enough calories from healthy vegan foods can provide what a female 
athlete needs.
	
Vegan sources of iron, the nonheme variety, are better used and absorbed by 
the body when ample vitamin C is available. So boost the power of these iron-
building foods by eating them with papaya, red peppers, oranges or orange 
juice, or other vitamin C–rich foods. Remember, broccoli has both iron and 
vitamin C!

309
 Chapter 23: The Vegan Athlete
Protecting your bones by staying 
on track with your calcium
Calcium supplies the building blocks for the strong, flexible bones that athletes 
need for running, throwing, jumping, and falling on a daily basis. Ensure that 
you’re reaching the daily minimum requirement by including natural, calcium-
rich foods in your meals. Male athletes need 800 milligrams per day and female 
athletes should aim for 1,200–1,500 milligrams per day. If you can’t get enough 
from the foods you eat, vegan supplements also are an option.
	
Female athletes especially need to keep on track with their calcium intake. 
Excessive training, which is defined as more than seven hours a week, can 
lead to a decline in hormone levels. These lower hormone levels can com­
promise bone health and lead to premature osteoporosis, a weakening of the 
bone matrix.
These simple vegan foods should be a part of your daily calcium strategy:
	
✓	Almonds
	
✓	Calcium-fortified cereals
	
✓	Calcium-fortified orange juice
	
✓	Enriched hemp, soy, and rice milk
	
✓	Greens like broccoli, kale, and spinach
	
✓	Soy yogurt
	
✓	Soy-yogurt dip mixed with a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses as a 
topping for fruit
	
✓	Tofu processed with calcium sulfate
	
Avoiding calcium-depleting foods is just as important as including calcium-
rich foods. Coffee and sodas, both caffeinated and caffeine-free, have been 
shown to leech calcium from the bones to balance the acidity of these 
beverages.
Remembering your vitamins and minerals
Because of their training and constant exercise, athletes need to consume 
more minerals and vitamins than their nonathletic counterparts. Keep in 
mind, however, that the human body best absorbs nutrients from fresh foods 
as opposed to supplements. So vegans should mine their mineral needs from 
healthy whole foods on a daily basis.

310
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
Magnesium
	
Magnesium is one mineral that athletes need to focus on when designing their 
diets for performance. Magnesium helps the body regulate muscle tone and is 
necessary for metabolizing carbohydrates and protein. Fortunately, most of 
the foods that contain the highest amounts of magnesium are vegan, includ­
ing black beans, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soybeans, spinach, sunflower 
seeds, and Swiss chard.
Chromium
Chromium is used by the body to regulate insulin, metabolism, and blood 
sugar levels. Athletes need slightly more chromium on a daily basis during 
training. Table 23-1 shows the recommendations for chromium.

Broccoli, grape juice, whole grains, potatoes, and fortified nutritional yeast 
flakes are good vegan sources of chromium.
Copper
Copper is an athlete’s ally, as this mineral creates cellular energy and strong 
connective tissue. Copper also allows the body to metabolize iron better, so 
be sure to get your recommended daily allowance from cashews, almonds, 
hazelnuts, lentils, mushrooms, and even vegan chocolate. Table 23-2 lists the 
various copper recommendations.

Zinc
Zinc levels may be lower in athletes, and it’s needed for healthy skin and 
wound repair. You can easily meet the daily requirements of 8–10 milligrams 
a day with good food choices. Vegan sources of zinc include fortified cereals, 
fortified nutritional yeast flakes, wheat germ, legumes, nuts, tofu, and miso.
Eating for Excellence in 
Your Sport of Choice
Choosing nutritious, whole foods on a regular basis during athletic training 
is the best way to prepare for the main event. Eating well consistently every 
day ensures a better outcome for your future athletic goals. Hundreds of 
professional athletes have used a plant-based diet to increase their intake of 
truly energizing foods.
Preparing your diet before 
an athletic event
Getting ready for a physical competition requires both mental and physical 
focus. Choose your foods for physical focus as wisely as you choose your 
thoughts to get psyched up for your event.
Beware of the naturally high fiber content in vegan foods. Too much soluble 
fiber can lead some athletes to experience stomach cramps or other diges­
tive problems like diarrhea. You don’t want the runs while you’re running!
	
If you know you have a more sensitive stomach (or a nervous stomach before 
competitions), reduce your fiber intake 24 to 48 hours before the big game 
or meet. Instead, try choosing other high-calorie foods, such as potatoes and 
whole-grain pasta, that will fuel your energy needs. A larger meal of about 800 
to 1,000 calories can be eaten about four or five hours before the start of an 
event, and a smaller, high-quality snack of 150 to 200 calories, such as cereal 
and soymilk, can be eaten an hour or two before. You want to give your diges­
tive system time to absorb the nutrients and energy from the meal, while 
giving the stomach time to empty out.
The most important aspect of nutrition that athletes need to consider is their 
water intake. Staying hydrated before and during training and competitions 
can make or break your record. Some athletes rely on artificially flavored and 
sweetened sports energy drinks. These drinks provide electrolytes, or salts, 
that the body sweats out during exercise. The artificially flavored drinks have 
too many chemicals and too much unneeded sugar.

312
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
	
Looking for a natural electrolyte drink to guzzle during your next game or 
meet? Try R.W. Knudsen’s Recharge sports drink, made with natural fruit 
juices, or electroBlast’s Power Concentrates, which come naturally flavored 
with essential oils and stevia. Young coconut water, naturally rich in electro­
lytes, can also be found in delis, health food stores or on the Internet.
Looking at long-term nutrition goals
The success of many vegan athletes in the professional sports arena proves 
that a plant-based diet can lead to goal-setting performances. Brendan 
Brazier, a vegan professional triathlete, and 2003’s Ultra Marathon National 
Champion, has proven that this diet works well for even the hardest-working 
human bodies.
The amazing Dr. Ruth Heidrich also has proven that a vegan diet can be 
a part of healthy, long-term nutrition goals. Dr. Ruth has completed six 
Ironman Triathlons and has won more than 900 gold medals in various dis­
tance races. She also has completed more than 60 marathons and holds 3 
world fitness records. Ruth has been vegan for more than 25 years.
	
What you eat is as important as what you avoid eating. Stay away from empty 
calories that many athletes rely on for quick energy. Slurping down energy 
drinks full of sugar and chemical colorings won’t truly support long-term 
health. Crunching salty, fried meals may make you feel full, but they still can 
clog the arteries of someone who trains every day. Instead of wasting valu­
able energy eating junk, focus on eating natural, vital foods that give you more 
healing energy than a dozen donuts or a bottle of soda.

H
aving watched grandparents, and now parents, retire and settle in to 
the golden years, many people realize that senior nutrition is vitally 
important to creating a high quality of life. While most vegan books and Web 
sites tend to focus on nutrition and lifestyle advice for infants, children, and 
families, mature adults definitely shouldn’t be left out. The health benefits 
available to aging adults through a vegan diet can address most of the ill­
nesses and woes they develop as time marches on. As the baby boomers are 
now entering retirement, the vegan diet and lifestyle becomes even more 
popular with those fabulous folks over 40.
Adults of the baby boomer generation are showing signs of being less healthy 
than their parents as they enter retirement. Even though they smoke less, 
this new crop of seniors has a higher rate of obesity, more chronic illnesses 
like hypertension and diabetes, and a more sedentary lifestyle. The American 
dream of owning a house in the suburbs and driving a big car to the office 
has been realized, but now many older citizens also are living the nightmare 
of health complaints and higher stress levels.
In this chapter, I discuss the nutritional needs of people over 40 as well as 
the best ways to make the vegan transition later in life. I make suggestions for 
simple food plans that can help guide you through a dietary shift, perhaps on 
a smaller budget. This shift will improve the quality of your life as you enjoy 
your middle and later ages.
	
The beauty of taking on the vegan ethos later in life is that the resulting health 
benefits can help you feel years younger. A well-planned vegan diet supports 
decades of good health and even provides insurance against our country’s 
top three killers: heart disease, cancer, and stroke. According to the American 
Dietetic Association, vegans have lower rates of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, 

314
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
and prostate and colon cancers; lower blood cholesterol levels; lower hyper­
tension; and lower blood pressure. The question is, why wouldn’t you go vegan 
after 40?
Boomer Bottom Line: Nutritional 
Needs after 40
Focusing your attention on quality nutrition in your later years protects you 
from disease and gives you the energy to play with the grandkids and do all 
those things you saved up a retirement account for.
A well-planned vegan diet that’s based on whole foods, including whole 
grains, beans, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and fruit, provides a strong foundation 
for those in and beyond middle age.
	
The nutritional needs for vegans over the age of 40 are similar to younger 
adults, but there are a few important differences. To ensure that your body 
has enough of every necessary nutrient, it’s important to be educated about 
the sources and quantities necessary. So in the following sections, I show you 
some of the most important nutrients you need as a senior vegan.
Sun + greens = healthy bones
According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin 
Diseases, 10 million people already have osteoporosis in the United States. 
And apparently another 34 million people have low bone mass, which places 
them at an increased risk for developing the disease. Baby boomers have 
lived an entire life being marketed to about how dairy is the optimal source 
of calcium and that milk is the best way to build bones and avoid osteoporo­
sis. This simply isn’t true.
While Americans consume more dairy than most nations on earth, we also 
have one of the highest osteoporosis rates. The real culprits behind this 
degenerative bone disease are diets that are too high in acidic animal pro­
tein, too high in sugar and salt, and too low in vitamin D.
To ensure healthy bones, eat a vegan diet that’s devoid of traditional dairy 
products and that’s full of green leafy vegetables. Because the human diges­
tive system doesn’t digest dairy well (lactose intolerance, anyone?), it makes 
sense that, according to the Heaney and Weaver article in The American 
Journal of Clinical Nutrition in April 1990, “[leafy] greens such as kale . . . 
[are] at least as good as milk in terms of calcium absorbability.” These same 
greens also contain the other minerals that make up strong bones that taking 
a lot of calcium supplements won’t give you.

315
 Chapter 24: Aging Gracefully and Veganly
Make certain that your body uses calcium properly by getting enough vita­
min D from sunlight on your skin. The top layers of your skin make vitamin 
D (which is actually a hormone) when exposed to sunlight or special light 
boxes. If you live in a Northern climate, and you don’t get daily sun exposure 
for at least 20 minutes, consider taking a vitamin D supplement.
	
Even though many vegan products like soy, rice, and hemp milk are fortified 
with vitamin D, many health experts and doctors think that the recommended 
daily allowance (RDA) isn’t high enough to ensure proper bone health. 
Researchers recently found that even higher recommendations of 2000IU a 
day were too low. Consider having your vitamin D levels checked with a blood 
test to determine what level of supplementation you need.
B healthy — get your B12
Despite occasional food recalls and outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, we live 
in an age of unparalleled food safety when it comes to cleanliness. This sani­
tation is necessary when one factory or processing plant is manufacturing 
thousands of pounds of food from hundreds of sources every day.
The flip-side of this rampant disinfection and sanitation is that our fruits and 
vegetables are virtually free of bacteria. I’m not promoting that we go around 
eating dirty, unclean food, but the truth is that some bacteria is good for 
humans. B12 is produced by bacteria and is then stored in animal tissues. 
Because livestock animals have these bacteria in their diet, people who eat 
animal flesh consume B12 in their food. Of course, vegans don’t naturally 
consume B12.
The impact of impact exercise
Bones aren’t just static stalks holding up our 
bodies like scarecrows. Like muscle, bone is 
an ever-changing, living tissue that responds to 
proper exercise by becoming stronger. Weight-
bearing exercise that encourages bones and 
muscles to increase strength is the best kind 
for preventing osteoporosis. In addition, many 
experts believe that the cushioned athletic 
shoes we often wear may actually decrease 
the stress we put on our bones — and that’s 
not a good thing. The mild impact of walking 
in bare feet may actually improve bone health 
because of the low-impact vibrations that travel 
up the skeleton. Try a combo of weight lifting 
for upper and lower body, biking, and walk­
ing around your house or safe outdoor area in 
bare feet. While you’re at it, try carrying those 
bags of groceries up the stairs one at a time. 
Talk about an excellent — and free — weight-
bearing exercise!

316
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
	
B12 is necessary for every human in sufficient quantities, and for senior citi­
zens or middle-aged folks it can help protect the nerve fibers in the brain as 
well as protect the body against anemia and dementia. Muscle coordination, 
balance, memory, and depression are all helped with adequate B12. Senior 
vegans can ensure they’re getting enough B12 by including fortified soy, rice, 
or hemp milk as well as Red Star nutritional yeast on a daily basis. Taking a 
B12 supplement may also be necessary to protect against deficiency.
The right fats are fabulous
Fat makes food taste good. It’s that simple. It moves tastes around in our 
mouths, enabling us to really enjoy the nuances and layers of flavors. In addi­
tion, fat is necessary for good health. The right kinds of dietary fat ensure 
healthy skin, properly lubricated joints, and proper brain function. Senior 
vegans can rejoice knowing that healthy plant-based fats will help them utilize 
many vitamins and minerals better, which contributes to better overall health.
	
The fatty acids linoleic, or omega-6, and alpha-linolenic, or omega-3, are good 
for you. These fatty acids are converted in the body to form the long-chain 
fatty acids needed by the body. Vegans need to be aware of their fat intake so 
they consume the healthy ratio of 6s and 3s. Increasing daily omega-3 intake 
to equal twice the omega-6 intake will help protect against immune and inflam­
matory disorders, chronic diseases, and psychological disorders that are 
common amongst America’s seniors.
The average American diet is heavy in animal fats, which are high in satu­
rated fats as well as cholesterol. These fats also are often teeming with 
toxins. Most agricultural animals are raised on chemical-, medicine-, and anti­
biotic-laced foods, which are ultimately stored in their fatty tissues. Including 
healthy vegetable fats from nuts, seeds, avocados, and olives helps vegan 
seniors to maintain heart and cardiovascular health.
	
The most dangerous fats are the trans fats, or hydrogenated oils. These fats are 
made by heating oils under pressure and then adding hydrogen to make them 
thick and stable at room temperature. Steer clear of commercially prepared, 
packaged, and refined foods, which are the most common sources of these 
nasty, artery-clogging fats.
Vegan sources of fat are wonderful for overall health, and they help you 
avoid the dangerous toxins common in animal-flesh fats. To ensure that you 
consume the right quantity and ratio of the different varieties of fats, it’s best 
to avoid processed and refined foods that can rely heavily on fried or hydro­
genated omega-6 oils. The vegan sources of omega-3 fatty acids are ground 
flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, hemp seeds, green leafy vegetables, and walnuts. 
Omega-6 fatty acids are found in sunflower, safflower, sesame and grape seed 
oils as well as corn and soy oil.

317
 Chapter 24: Aging Gracefully and Veganly
	
Because omega-3 oils are highly sensitive to heat, it’s important to use them in 
warm- or room-temperature applications only. Don’t sauté or fry anything in 
flax or walnut oil. Instead, drizzle these oils on foods after they’re cooked. Flax 
oil can be consumed in blended smoothies as well.
Other vegan sources of health-promoting fats are avocados, raw nuts and 
seeds, and coconut meat. Eating raw nuts and seeds is more beneficial 
because roasting degrades the quality of the fats.
Keeping your iron in check
Both women and men in their later years still need to be aware of their iron 
intake. The main preventable cause of iron-deficient anemia in middle-aged 
men and postmenopausal women is the long-term use of aspirin or nonsteroi­
dal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS), including ibuprofen.
	
These anti-inflammatory drugs are taken to remedy many aches and pains like 
gout, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and headaches and migraines. 
A whole-foods, vegan diet, especially one that avoids caffeine and refined 
sugars, has been used to greatly reduce these and other inflammatory condi­
tions. And when you reduce these conditions, you reduce the reliance on the 
iron-decreasing drugs.
Many natural vegan foods contain iron, so be sure to include a variety of 
them in your weekly menus. Blackstrap molasses, dried apricots, sea veg­
etables, whole grains, nuts, green leafy vegetables, seeds, and legumes are 
good sources. Using iron cookware also increases your daily intake. For more 
information on iron-rich foods, check out the tables in Chapter 4.
If you aren’t taking aspirin or other NSAIDS, it isn’t usually necessary to take 
an iron supplement after menopause, and most men don’t need to supple­
ment for this mineral. Before supplementing iron it’s wise to consult with 
your doctor and have a simple blood test.
Metabolic Mayhem for the Mature
Keeping off the muffin top in retirement is a high priority for a lot of baby 
boomers. One of the great joys of vegan living is that most of us have a lower 
BMI, or body mass index, than meat eaters, fish eaters, and even vegetar­
ians. Because high protein and low fiber consumption are the factors most 
strongly linked with increased BMI, it makes sense that vegans would natu­
rally weigh less and reap the associated health benefits.

318
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
As we age, our metabolism slows down and so do we. Not only do the mito­
chondria (every human cell’s power source) slow down, but most humans 
also lose muscle over time and exercise less. When people age and stop 
working to build muscle through weight-bearing exercise, their ability to 
metabolize energy and calories is reduced. For these people, it takes longer 
to burn off a piece of vegan cream pie at the age of 70 than it does at 25.
	
To improve metabolic response and overall energy, a vegan diet paired with 
a daily exercise routine that includes consistently increasing weight-bearing 
activities greatly improves the body’s ability to lose weight.
Healing Disease with a Vegan Diet
These top killers in America should be put on big banners right next to the 
post office posters of the most-wanted criminals: heart disease, cancer, and 
stroke. These, and most of the next top five diseases, including diabetes, 
affect the health of most seniors and are often avoidable with proper diet 
and lifestyle considerations. We’ve all heard the doctors and seen the special 
reports: What we eat can kill us — or heal us.
The facts are clear that a whole-foods, vegan diet that avoids processed 
sugars and over-chemicalized ingredients can help seniors to sidestep and 
even cure many diseases. Along with heart disease and cancer, osteoporosis 
and digestive problems plague senior citizens and lead to a greatly dimin­
ished quality of life.
Seniors staying sexier for longer
Switching to a low-fat, whole foods, vegan diet 
is one of the best ways to deal with women’s 
menopausal symptoms of weight gain, insom­
nia, hot flashes, fluid retention, vaginal dryness, 
and wrinkles. Along with greater longevity, 
lower incidence of heart disease, and osteo­
porosis, Asian and African women who eat a 
more traditional diet that’s less reliant on meat 
don’t experience the same rates of menopausal 
symptoms that Canadian and American women 
do, according to T. Colin Campbell’s The China 
Study (Benbella Books). Eating a diet devoid 
of the hormone-producing fatty animal foods 
like meat, poultry, and dairy can greatly relieve 
women’s symptoms and help them stay trim and 
confident.
Mature men also sense a sexier self after going 
vegan. The increase of fiber and elimination 
of cholesterol and high-fat meats and dairy 
products improves overall vein health and cir­
culation. Because Viagra essentially works by 
increasing and improving the flow of blood in 
the body, it helps men with circulatory problems 
achieve erection. Vegans generally have better 
cardiovascular health, so erectile dysfunction 
won’t be as much of a downer.

319
 Chapter 24: Aging Gracefully and Veganly
Due to overfarming, and the explosion of monocrop agriculture, the actual 
quantities of nutrients in our food and soil have greatly declined over the 
past 100 years. Choosing a diet of organic foods that have been raised in 
healthier, more nutrient-dense soils will increase the nutrition you get from 
your food, thus helping your body recover from and avoid disease.
Improving cardiovascular 
health as you age
Sadly, most of the reasons that seniors develop cardiovascular or heart dis­
ease are avoidable. High blood cholesterol, smoking, lack of exercise, stress, 
and being overweight are the main culprits which become more dangerous 
as humans age.
And there’s no denying that a diet rich in meat, refined carbohydrates, and 
processed foods leads to high cholesterol and ultimately heart disease. Some 
meat eaters believe that only eating poultry and avoiding red meat will pro­
tect their health. What they may not realize is that although chicken has less 
saturated fat than beef, both have nearly the same amount of cholesterol.
A whole-foods, vegan diet, on the other hand, has been proven to reverse and 
heal the human body of heart disease. If you need proof that a vegan diet can 
improve your cardiovascular health, consider these studies:
	
✓	According to a study in the journal Public Health Nutrition (October 
2002), vegans “have a lower prevalence of hypertension and lower sys­
tolic and diastolic blood pressures than meat eaters,” due in part to 
the fact that they consume no cholesterol from their food and generally 
weigh less than meat eaters.
	
✓	Dr. Dean Ornish received worldwide acclaim in 1990 when he published 
his classic, best-selling book Reversing Heart Disease. In it, Dr. Ornish 
details how prescribing low-fat, vegetarian, or vegan diets, along with 
exercise and stress-reduction exercises, was used to stop and reverse 
heart disease. Without the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs (or any 
other drugs), Dr. Ornish was able to prove that a plant-based diet can 
cure heart disease, which is one of the most fatal diseases amongst 
senior citizens.
	
✓	Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, uses a 
stricter, exclusively vegan diet where total calories from fat are kept 
under 10 percent of a total daily caloric intake. Because strokes are 
essentially brain “heart attacks,” this diet has been used to help people 
at high risk to avoid strokes, the top cause of disability for older adults.

Animal foods are the only source of cholesterol in a diet. They’re also the 
main source of saturated fat, and vegans avoid most of these risky products. 
The American Heart Association, and most other medical experts, supports 
the idea that a high-fiber diet decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Because a vegan diet is higher in fiber, it will automatically be better for heart 
health. Other therapeutic diets that include animal products are much less 
effective, and usually only slow the process of atherosclerosis (rather than 
stop it altogether).
	
High dietary consumption of vitamin C also is linked to better heart and 
cardiovascular health. Eating fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables naturally 
increases one’s intake of vitamin C. The best sources of this incredible antioxi­
dant are organic red bell peppers, parsley, broccoli, cauliflower, strawberries, 
lemon juice, mustard greens, Brussels sprouts, papaya, kale, grapefruit, kiwi 
fruit, cantaloupe, oranges, cabbages, and tomatoes. What a surprise — they’re 
all vegan! They also add a healthy dose of fiber, which helps seniors combat 
high cholesterol and chronic constipation.
The great thing about switching to a vegan diet to improve your heart health 
is that you can see results quickly. In the peer-reviewed study found in the 
Central European Journal of Public Health (December 2008), a “low-fat, low-
[calorie, vegan] diet, over the course of one week in a stress-free environ­
ment, had positive impact on the risk factors of cardiovascular disease.”
	
Eating a whole-foods, vegan diet is an amazing leap toward heart health, but 
you can’t just sit on the couch eating your beans and rice and expect to feel 
better. It’s time to get serious and get moving! You need to make it a priority 
to work up a sweat, get your heart rate up, and move your limbs with some 
cardiovascular exercise.
Easing digestion and elimination
Older adults are often plagued with chronic constipation. It can be a symp­
tom of various diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, colon 
cancer, multiple sclerosis, colonic disorders, and even Parkinson’s disease.
Many seniors take a cornucopia of drugs and supplements that also can 
lead to constipation. Everything from iron and calcium supplements, sleep­
ing pills, antidepressants, painkillers, and antacids can lead to constipation. 
Combine this pharmacy of medications with a low-fiber diet and low-water 
intake, and you’ll find yourself visiting the old water closet a lot less fre­
quently than you would like.

321
 Chapter 24: Aging Gracefully and Veganly
	
Chronic constipation is not only uncomfortable and unhealthy, but it also can 
be dangerous. It can lead to pressure inside the veins, which often leads to 
painful hernias or varicose veins.
The best ways to naturally avoid and treat chronic constipation involve your 
diet, movement, and hydration. Before I get to diet, let me emphasize that 
chronic constipation is much improved with daily physical exercise. Walking, 
bike riding, swimming, dancing, and weight lifting are all useful for clearing 
out constipation’s effects. And aiming for six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water 
a day will ensure that you’re properly hydrated.
	
Getting fiber into your diet helps ease constipation and reduces cholesterol 
levels. And guess what? Animal foods have no fiber! A vegan diet, on the other 
hand, is naturally fiberfull. The recommended daily fiber amounts for men are 
30 to 38 grams a day, and women should get 21 to 25 grams a day. To get to 
the recommended daily amount, take a look at this sample menu:
Breakfast: Oatmeal with 1 cup raspberries (12 grams)
Lunch: Vegan lentil soup mixed with 1 cup brown rice (19 grams)
Dinner: Steamed Artichoke with Sautéed Tofu (10.4 grams)
You can easily exceed your daily fiber recommendation with little effort. 
Consider having three or more servings each of high-fiber whole grains and 
steamed vegetables each day. Starting your day with a breakfast of fruit and 
oatmeal or a vegan bran muffin is easy and full of fiber.
	
Some folks may develop dental problems as they age. Painful teeth and gum 
disease can make eating some high-fiber foods difficult. Raw vegetables and 
crunchy whole foods may be great for the constipation counterattack, but if 
eating them is too difficult for you, many other high-fiber vegan foods can be 
cooked and still offer the fiber benefits. Table 24-1 shows some of these foods.

For true poop-perfection, aim for one good bowel movement a day. A healthy 
stool isn’t too loose and shouldn’t be difficult to eliminate. Pushing and strain­
ing can lead to other bowel problems like intestinal obstructions, fainting, or 
even cardiac attack, so balancing your diet and water intake will be a big help.
	
The modern sitting position on a toilet often makes going to the bathroom dif­
ficult and incomplete, which can lead people to force and strain. The human 
body releases feces better in a squat position. However, it can be difficult 
for baby boomers to get into that proper position. So, in order to naturally 
improve your elimination and ease constipation, consider buying a squatting 
platform for your toilet. Several companies make these chairs that easily fit 
around a standard toilet.
My sign’s not Cancer: Using a vegan diet 
to reverse cancer
A plant-based diet can help the human body recover from and reverse the 
course of many cancers, including colorectal cancer which affects mainly 
seniors. This fact alone should inspire many thousands of baby-boomers to 
try a whole-foods, vegan diet.
Emmy Award–winning cooking-show hostess and author Christina Pirello 
often tells her personal story of overcoming leukemia with a macrobiotic-
style vegan diet. On the opposite end of the vegan diet continuum, a raw-
foods diet also has cured countless people of their cancers. Both the Living 
Foods Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center 
in Arizona help people who are interested in using the raw foods diet to heal 
and recover from cancer.
Many studies have shown the healing benefits of a vegan diet for cancer 
patients and those who want to protect themselves from developing the 
disease. In The British Journal of Cancer (July 7, 2009), the incidences of 

323
 Chapter 24: Aging Gracefully and Veganly
several forms of cancer were less prevalent in vegans and vegetarians than 
in meat eaters.
	
Be aware of the dangers of grilled meats and pass them on to your meat-eating 
friends and loved ones. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine 
tested Kentucky Fried Chicken’s Kentucky Grilled Chicken products and found 
“substantial amounts of carcinogenic chemical[s] in all samples tested.” Time 
to start making vegan tempeh “chicken” salad, Grandma!
	
One of the main reasons plant-based diets work to heal and rid the body of 
cancer is the high amount of phytochemicals found in edible plant foods. 
Phytochemicals are naturally occurring biochemicals found in plants that are 
used as protection from disease, oxidation, and insects. These same protec­
tive biochemicals are cancer-suppressing in the human body. Thousands of 
phytochemicals are found in fruits, vegetables, sprouts, seeds, nuts, legumes, 
and grains. These nutritional gems must be eaten in fresh, whole foods, not 
just extracted into supplements. Working in concert, the myriad combinations 
of phytochemicals found in natural vegan foods are truly healing and protect 
the human body from diseases that affect so many seniors.
Planning for Success with 
Easy Food Choices
Making major dietary changes may seem overwhelming to older citizens who 
are set in their ways. However eating well as you age can be easy if you keep 
in mind the following parameters:
	
✓	Choose a variety of nutrient-dense foods every day. These foods are 
high in nutrition but low in calories — foods such as whole grains, 
beans, and organic fruits and vegetables.
	
✓	Avoid all processed sugars, including white granulated cane and beet 
sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, and artificial sweeteners. Instead use 
agave syrup, brown rice syrup, or blackstrap molasses.
	
✓	Choose whole-grain products. Whole-grain products, like whole-wheat 
bread, are made with all the edible parts of the seed. The bran, germ, 
and endosperm are present to contribute fiber, complex carbohydrates, 
protein, vitamins, and healthy fats.
	
✓	Include a variety of proteins every day. Various kinds of beans, nuts, 
seeds, whole grains, and soy foods combine over the course of the day 
to give you all the amino acids you need for complete protein.
	
✓	Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Seniors often find that their appetites 
decrease with age. Eating smaller meals more often throughout the day 
can help ensure proper nutrient consumption without causing discomfort.

324
Part VI: Veganism for All Walks of Life 
	
✓	If chewing or swallowing has become difficult or uncomfortable, make 
nutrient-dense smoothies with fresh, organic ingredients. Hemp pro­
tein, rice milk, nuts, avocado, organic berries, and even chopped raw 
greens can all be blended into tasty, easy-to-digest meals.
Eating healthily on a fixed income
Buying healthy food can seem more expensive 
if you walk down the organic produce section 
of a health food store. Don’t be discouraged. 
There are many ways to save money and still 
eat better-quality ingredients.
Buying grains, herbs, spices, nuts, seeds, 
and beans in bulk greatly reduces the cost of 
organic ingredients. Many health food stores 
have bulk bins where you can scoop the desired 
amount of ingredients into plastic or paper 
bags. You also can bring your own reusable 
plastic or glass containers if you want to stop 
wasting plastic or paper bags. Just be sure to 
weigh the empty container with the check-out 
person to find the tare, or weight of the empty 
container, before you fill it with new product.
You also can join a local co-op or food buying 
club. Most co-ops are run by the workers who 
spend a few hours a month performing prede­
termined duties for the store. Other co-ops offer 
yearly membership fees, and may offer a senior 
discount. The prices for groceries are much 
less expensive because the store doesn’t have 
to pay high labor costs.
Local farmers may run CSAs, or community 
supported agriculture associations. Members 
buy a share in a farm and then receive weekly 
deliveries of fresh, locally grown, and usually 
organic produce. The cost for these fruits and 
vegetables is often much cheaper than the 
local health food store, and you get the added 
benefit of helping a small, local farmer stay in 
business while making new friends. To find a 
co-op or CSA near you visit www.localhar­
vest.org. or call 831-475-8150.

often-used information can get you through cocktail party

the most common questions you’ll hear about your new 
lifestyle.

Ten Reasons for Eating 
a Vegan Diet
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the health benefits of a vegan diet
▶	Arming yourself with information to support your decision to live a vegan life
I
f you’re unsure about changing your eating and lifestyle habits, this chap­
ter can offer you the most compelling, fact-rich information to help you 
in your transformation. The justification is different for every vegan, and no 
reason is better than any other.
It’s Heart Healthy and Cancer Protective
The facts are undeniable: Heart disease remains the number one killer of men 
and women in the United States. Luckily, a vegan diet is good for your heart 
health. The American Heart Association supports the fact that a balanced 
vegan diet is lower in fat and is cholesterol-free (because only animal foods 
have cholesterol), which leads to lower risks for coronary heart disease, high 
blood pressure, and obesity.
In fact, studies have shown that a vegan diet — rich in whole grains, fruits, 
and vegetables — can stop and even reverse heart disease. Imagine how 
many lives could be saved if more people adopted a vegan diet.
The second most common cause of death in America is cancer. Like heart 
disease, many cancers can be treated or prevented with a vegan diet. The 
immense amount of cancer-fighting properties in fresh fruits and vegetables 
is leading scientific researchers to study the benefits of this diet. Chapter 1 
discusses these topics in further detail.

328
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
It Keeps You Slim
Maintaining a healthy weight is much easier with a vegan diet. Because most 
plant foods are naturally low in fat, a vegan eats less total fat and very little 
saturated fat. A thoughtful vegan diet is helpful for overweight and obese 
people who want to lose weight. That’s because they’ll naturally consume 
fewer calories, even while eating good-quality ingredients and abundant 
nutrition.
A plant-based, vegan diet is full of veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds, grains, and 
beans, which are all great sources of fiber. A fiber-rich diet is more filling, 
often leading a person to eat less food and fewer calories. Fiber also helps 
the digestive system move better and eliminate properly, helping the body to 
maintain a healthy balance of water.
It Has a Lower Carbon Footprint
The farming and agriculture conditions required to raise animals for food 
production cause some of the largest uses of fresh water and fossil fuels 
in the world. Experts state that food production in the U.S. accounts for 19 
percent of total energy use. By choosing a vegan diet, your food automati­
cally requires less intensive use of petroleum for transporting animals, run­
ning machines, and powering factory farms. Buying local, seasonal produce 
is even more eco-friendly because it requires less refrigeration and fuel for 
transportation. Even if you do continue to eat Maine blueberries in your 
winter muffins, you’re still being better to the environment than if you were 
still eating animal foods.
It’s Kind to All Living Creatures
As you know, a vegan eats no fish, fowl, cows, lambs, sheep, pigs, eggs, 
cheese, milk, butter, or honey. Mahatma Gandhi is credited with saying “To 
my mind, the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being. I 
should be unwilling to take the life of a lamb for the sake of the human body.” 
By refusing to take the life of another creature, a vegan allows all creatures to 
continue on their natural course toward full self-expression, which is the true 
hallmark of an enlightened soul. I like animals, and I consider them to be my 
friends. And, well, I don’t eat my friends.

329
 Chapter 25: Ten Reasons for Eating a Vegan Diet
It Provides Excellent Nutrition
Fresh plant foods are full of phytochemicals, minerals, vitamins, enzymes, 
and fiber. These nutritious aspects of a vegan diet are sorely lacking in the 
standard American diet, and they can help halt, reverse, and cure long-stand­
ing health concerns like heart disease and obesity.
	
A vegan diet that includes a variety of foods will easily provide enough pro­
tein, healthy fats, complex carbohydrates, and calories for the average person. 
A vegan diet also provides a wealth of amazing nutritional support not found 
in the standard American diet; the vegan’s reliance on fresh fruit and vegeta­
bles as well as other whole foods, such as beans and grains, provides plenty of 
vital, nourishing energy.
It Protects Our Natural Resources
Grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep, for food leads to massive soil ero­
sion as well as the loss of precious topsoil. Topsoil is a basic component of 
a healthy landscape and is necessary for natural plants, agriculture, wildlife, 
and healthy ecosystems. Forests are constantly being cut down to make 
room for more grazing area, leading to deforestation and contributing to the 
greenhouse effect and the loss of precious natural habitat for wildlife. The 
loss of these natural resources, forests, and soils is devastating to the health 
of our entire planet and humanity.
	
Choosing a vegan lifestyle is just as meaningful to the health and future of our 
planet as using reusable cloth shopping bags or compact fluorescent light 
bulbs.
It Protects the Food Supply 
for All Humans
Hundreds of gallons of water and many acres of arable land are required to 
produce a pound of meat for human consumption. A cow needs to eat hun­
dreds of pounds of soybeans or wheat to produce a small amount of edible 
animal protein. As the world’s resources become more and more strained, a 
vegan diet takes on more importance than just being kind to our four-footed 
friends. If we stopped feeding all that edible plant food to animals, much 
more food would be available for humans around the globe. More than 900 

330
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
million undernourished people inhabit our planet. Feeding those people the 
grain destined for factory-farmed animals would end a lot of suffering for 
both people and animals. What could be more humane than eating simply so 
that others may simply eat?
It Has Fewer Pesticides, 
Drugs, and Toxins
Animal foods that are produced by modern conventional methods often 
come with an unsavory side dish: the residue of antibiotics and hormones 
used to treat factory-farmed animals. How do these toxins get into the food? 
Allow me to explain.
These animals generally are raised in densely populated conditions, often 
without access to fresh air, sunlight, or exercise, and they’re fed an unnatural 
diet of high-calorie foods that are used to fatten them as quickly as possible. 
These conditions lead to an unhealthy environment in which diseases quickly 
spread. Then farmers and ranchers must use antibiotics to treat the animals. 
Cows, chickens, and other animals also are given hormones to speed their 
growth and produce more meat. These hormones and antibiotics can end up 
in the final products of milk, meat, and eggs, which are then absorbed into 
the human body when eaten. The question remains, what do these dangerous 
drugs do to people when eaten regularly, even in small doses?
Other toxins make their way into meat and dairy by way of what the live­
stock is allowed to eat. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 
StarLink corn, a genetically modified organism, isn’t safe for people to eat. 
However, it has been deemed safe to use as livestock feed. But then those 
same animals get served up to humans as dinner. Sounds a little iffy to me.
Similarly, the Food and Drug Administration has long advised women and 
children to limit their consumption of certain types of fish because of the 
health risks associated with high levels of mercury. By avoiding fish alto­
gether, vegans avoid the dangerous side effects associated with mercury 
toxicity, including damage to the neurological development of fetuses and 
infants as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
	
A vegan diet, especially one that includes mainly organic foods, contains no 
man-made antibiotics or hormones and very few chemical pesticides. Because 
our modern world is already so polluted, it can be a huge relief to the human 
body to eat only nontoxic foods.

331
 Chapter 25: Ten Reasons for Eating a Vegan Diet
It Can Save You Money!
Most vegan foods are cheap, even when purchased in the organic aisle. 
Eating a diet of mainly inexpensive commodities, such as beans, whole 
grains, and veggies, can lead to great savings in the checkout line. These sav­
ings are mostly due to the fact that plant proteins are much more inexpen­
sive than meat, poultry, eggs, and fish. Even ground beef averages $3.50 per 
pound in most U.S. cities, and chicken breasts can cost $3 to $4 per pound.
The same $4 buys more than 2 pounds of organic brown rice and 2 pounds of 
organic lentils. For a few extra pennies, you can buy some organic sunflower 
seeds and broccoli. No matter how you look at it, the same amount of money 
provides more food, more protein, more minerals, more fiber, more nutrition, 
and less disease-promoting material for your body to digest.
A vegan diet also leads to financial savings by helping you avoid illnesses and 
long-term diseases, such as heart disease, certain cancers, and dementia. 
Avoiding unhealthy foods now will save you years of lifespan and countless 
dollars on unnecessary healthcare costs in the future. Dr. T. Colin Campbell, 
author of The China Study (Benbella Books), believes Americans’ overly 
meaty diets result in $60 to $120 billion in healthcare costs every year — try 
that on for a national healthcare plan!

H
ow irritated will you get with the same questions from nonvegans over 
and over again? Probably very irritated. That’s why this chapter is so 
important. Here, amid the ten most common questions you’re likely to hear, 
you can find all the comebacks, educated information, and succinct points of 
fact needed to make it through what I call the “vegan third degree.”
	
If you’re still sitting on the fence about whether to become a full-on vegan, 
this chapter can help you make the final decision. The best part about these 
savory bits of knowledge is that you just may entice the person asking the 
question to go vegan too!
Why Would You Do Something 
Like That?
Going vegan is one of the best ways to protect the environment. After all, 
raising animals for meat is one of the leading contributors to global warming. 
Because raising animals for human consumption requires huge amounts of 
clean water, land, and oil for transportation and refrigeration, it’s better for 
the environment to be an SUV-driving vegan than a Prius-driving meat eater.
Similarly, the best way to show that you care about animals and other people 
is to stop eating animal products. By not eating meat, cow’s milk, or eggs, a 
vegan saves the lives of more than 100 animals a year. Eating meat and dairy 
takes food and clean water away from starving people around the world. It 
takes many pounds of grain and hundreds of gallons of water to produce just 

334
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
a small amount of meat or dairy. The more people who live vegan, the more 
other people can simply eat.
Aside from being an environmentally friendly decision, a vegan diet also will 
keep you alive! The American Dietetic Association states that vegans are less 
likely to become obese or develop diabetes, many cancers, or heart disease.
Where Do You Get Your Calcium?
Vegan sources of calcium are everywhere. Dark green veggies, such as broc­
coli and bok choy, are excellent sources. And soy, rice and hemp milks are 
all enriched with the mineral — as are many orange and apple juices. Tofu 
is often processed with calcium sulfate, making it a good source. Soy yogurt, 
almonds, blackstrap molasses, and tahini also contain substantial amounts.
Several studies have shown strong evidence that people who eat lower-
protein, plant-based diets need less calcium than those eating higher-protein 
diets based on animal foods. Even though vegans may need less calcium 
to ensure strong bones, they can (and should) get the recommended daily 
allowance, with natural, cruelty-free foods.
Where Do You Get Your Protein?
	
A varied vegan diet provides enough protein for both adults and children. As 
long as you eat enough calories from varied sources of food, it’s easy to get 
your recommended amount on a daily basis. Vegan sources of protein include 
whole-wheat bread, nuts like almonds and cashews, seeds like sunflower and 
sesame, peanut and almond butter, soy and hemp milk, whole grains, beans, 
and soy foods like tofu and soy yogurt.
An 18-year-old male needs between 55 and 60 grams of protein a day. So, if 
he eats the following foods in one day, he’s set on his protein: 1 cup oatmeal, 
2 tablespoons flaxseeds, 2 cups hemp milk, 2 slices of whole-wheat bread, 4 
tablespoons of peanut butter, 1 cup of vegan black bean chili, 1 cup cooked 
pasta, 1 cup broccoli, and 1⁄2 cup tofu.
Animal foods offer complete protein — they have each of the 22 amino acids 
present that the body needs to use protein. Luckily, however, tofu and other 
soy foods also contain the necessary amino acids. Other vegan foods like 
beans, grains, vegetables, nuts, and seeds will provide, over the course of a 
day or so, all the essential amino acids that the body needs.

nola, or hash browns with tempeh sausages.
	
✓	Lunch can include peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chocolate chip 
cookies made with applesauce and flaxseeds instead of eggs, veggie 
burgers, french fries, falafel with hummus and pita bread, or a fake meat 
and cheese sandwich on whole-wheat bread.
	
✓	Dinner menus offer vegetable and tofu lasagna; pasta with broccoli, 
tomatoes, and white beans; lentil soup with crusty bread and sautéed 
kale; bean casseroles; chili with chips, salsa, and guacamole; or curried 
vegetables with rice and chickpeas.

vegan diet.
Isn’t That a Difficult Lifestyle 
to Get Used to?
When you’re passionate about your health, treating animals kindly, and pro­
tecting the environment, it isn’t difficult to make a few dietary and lifestyle 
changes. The first few weeks can be an adjustment, but once you start look­
ing, you see vegan options everywhere! Health food stores are popping up 
all over the country, providing many vegan products to Americans coast 
to coast. In fact, there are more than 250 Whole Foods Markets in North 
America alone! If you don’t have a good health food store near you, keep in 
mind that the Internet is an incredible resource.
	
If you think you can’t get by without some of your favorite nonvegan foods 
and household items, think again! You can find alternatives for almost every­
thing you may need to buy. Vegan milks, cheeses, meats, shoes, wallets, belts, 
vitamins, makeup, deodorants, shampoos, candles, pet foods, and baby items 
abound!

336
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Do You Eat Fish or Dairy Products?
Fish are animals, so vegans don’t eat them. Vegans also don’t eat dairy prod­
ucts that come from animals, including cow’s milk, cow’s cheese, goat’s milk 
or cheese, and butter.
Other animal products that vegans avoid eating are honey, eggs, meat, 
chicken, veal, pork, or turkey (even on Thanksgiving).
Where Can You Go Out to Eat?
Going out to eat isn’t difficult — just ask for what you want and kindly 
request that your server omit dairy and meat from your dishes. I’ve never 
had a problem “veganizing” a menu item, especially if you ask sweetly and 
smile.
You really can eat anywhere as a vegan — even a steak house! Try ordering 
hummus with vegetables, falafel and pita bread, vegetable pizza minus the 
cheese, pasta with beans and vegetables without cheese or butter, vegetarian 
refried beans with guacamole and chips, or coconut curry bowls with rice. 
You also can make a meal out of side dishes that don’t include animal prod­
ucts. Most restaurants offer some bean, green, and grain dish on the side that 
you can combine to make a complete meal. Just be sure to specifically ask 
that no dairy, butter, meat, or chicken stock be used in any of the prepara­
tion.
	
Not only are regular restaurants accommodating, but vegan and vegetarian 
restaurants can be found all over the world. Visit www.happycow.net or 
www.vegdining.com to find a vegan-friendly dining spot near you.
Can You Be Healthy on a Vegan Diet?
If you want to know whether you or a loved one can be healthy on a vegan 
diet, the answer is “Heck yeah!” Vegans are often at least 20 pounds lighter 
than meat eaters who are the same height. Even better is the fact that many 
people have actually reversed their serious health conditions — including 
cancers, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity — by adopting a vegan 
diet along with increased exercise.

 Chapter 26: Top Ten Questions (and Answers) about Going Vegan
	
Top government and healthcare organizations, such as the American Dietetic 
Association, have declared that a vegan diet can be perfectly healthy for every 
stage of life including pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and adulthood. The com­
petitive sports world even contains many professional vegan athletes. Pro 
football players, triathletes, ultramarathoners, tennis players, karate champi­
ons, and even body builders create their incredible physiques from plant-
based diets. Part VI discusses veganism in all walks of life.
Vegans tend to eat more fiber, fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains than 
nonvegans. These are the exact foods that health experts are constantly 
harping on the public to eat more of — living vegan almost ensures this.
What Do the Experts Think of Veganism?
Some folks can’t accept a new line of thinking unless they hear positive com­
ments from leading experts in that field. So, when you’re faced with explain­
ing veganism to this type of person, feel free to quote the following expert 
opinions:
	
✓	“A low-fat, plant-based diet would not only lower the heart-attack rate 
about 85 percent, but would lower the cancer rate 60 percent.” — 
William Castelli, M.D., Medical Director, Framingham, Cardiovascular 
Institute
	
✓	“Scientific data suggest positive relationships between a vegetarian [and 
vegan] diet and reduced risk for several chronic degenerative diseases 
and conditions, including obesity, coronary artery disease, hyperten­
sion, diabetes mellitus, and some types of cancer.” — American Dietetic 
Association
	
✓	The rate of breast cancer among premenopausal women who ate the 
most animal (but not vegetable) fat was a third higher than that of 
women who ate the least animal fat. — Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute
	
✓	“With all the information now available about the long-term health ben­
efits of plant-based diets, there is really no question that the vegan diet 
is safe — in fact, it offers the most disease-fighting protection of any 
dietary pattern.” — Amy Lanou, Ph.D.

Where Can I Learn More?
Many magazines, books, Web sites, Internet groups, and organizations can 
provide information on how to live a vegan life. An excellent magazine on 
vegan living is Veg News, which can be ordered online or purchased in health 
food stores. Some of my favorite books include
	
✓	Diet for a New America by John Robbins (HJ Kramer)
	
✓	The Vegan Lunchbox: 130 Amazing, Animal-Free Lunches Kids and Grown-
Ups Will Love! by Jennifer McCann (Da Capo Press)
	
✓	Cooking the Whole Foods Way by Christina Pirello (HP Trade)
	
✓	Breaking the Food Seduction by Dr. Neal Barnard (St. Martin’s Griffin)
	
✓	Veganomicon by Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero (Da 
Capo Press)
Excellent Web site resources for finding out more about vegan living include 
The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (www.pcrm.org) and 
Girlie Girl Army for vegan fashionistas (www.girliegirlarmy.com). For 
everything else under the sun, check out www.veganessentials.com.

Chapter 27
Ten Ways to Make Vegan Living 
Extraordinary
In This Chapter
▶	Broadening your horizons by joining other vegans
▶	Discovering new skills that promote your values
▶	Acting like a global citizen in your local area
I
n this chapter, I show you how to turn your veganism into a powerful, pro­
ductive, and satisfying lifestyle by expanding your horizons and getting off 
the couch. It’s easier to make this diet a lifelong commitment if you begin to 
create a supportive, exciting community. Reaching out to deepen your aware­
ness and going beyond the normal will be truly satisfying.
Join a Local Vegan Group
Starting any new hobby, lifestyle, diet, or spiritual practice requires you 
to have a community of people and teachers around you to offer support. 
Because becoming vegan encompasses all these things, joining a local vegan 
group can help ensure your success. Membership in a local group gets you in 
touch with like-minded people who you can share activities and meals with. 
These folks ideally live close by and can offer you nuts-and-bolts support 
with vegan living.
	
To find local groups of like-minded veggie lovers:
	
✓	Look at your local health food store bulletin board, which may list meet­
ings of local supper clubs.
	
✓	Ask the local college if it has any student-run vegan groups. Even if 
you aren’t eligible to join, the group may be willing to share some local 
resources with you.
	
✓	Ask the servers, owner, and chef at your local vegan-friendly restaurant 
if they know of any groups, meetings, or experts living nearby.

340
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Check the events sections in your local newspapers and nickel ads. They 
may list vegan festivals, speakers, or potlucks.
Join a Few Online Vegan Groups
Meeting up with local vegans is only part of your new community. You can 
find thousands more online! The Internet can connect you to every aspect of 
veganism: shopping, cooking, dating, political activism, and community build­
ing. Here are some of the best resources to get you started:
	
✓	MeetUp.com: vegan.meetup.com
	
✓	Vegans World Network: www.vegansworldnetwork.org
	
✓	The Vegan Forum: www.veganforum.com
Throw a Totally Vegan Birthday Party
Bring your vegan and nonvegan friends together and throw yourself (or 
someone else) a totally vegan birthday! This winning strategy combines what 
we love best about living vegan: great food, fun, cool new things, and cake.
	
By throwing your own party, you can introduce your favorite new recipes to 
friends and family to show off your burgeoning culinary skills. Here are some 
things to do to ensure success:
	
✓	Choose fun party foods to entice nonvegans to the buffet table. These 
are just a few options: tofu chicken fingers, decadent vegan cake or 
cupcakes with piped frosting, stuffed mushrooms, seven-layer dip, 
olives, stuffed grape leaves, spiced nuts, fruit salad served in a scooped-
out watermelon, hummus, crackers, chips, salsa, and guacamole. The 
choices are endless. Part IV is your guide to cooking vegan. Check it out.
	
✓	Set up a bar with beer, wine, juice, seltzer, and cocktail mixers. Offer 
olives, cherries, lemon and lime slices, and lots of ice. Borrow glass tum­
blers from friends or family or pick up a dozen at your local thrift store. 
They’re reusable and can always be donated, which is cooler and more 
“free-gan” than throwing out paper cups. (See the later section “Be More 
Free-Gan with Used Goods.”)
	
✓	Ask the invitees to dress as nice as they can without wearing any 
leather, silk, wool, or fur. Throwing a dress-up party always makes 
the event more festive, and this little twist encourages your nonvegan 
friends to think a little bit about what they wear on a daily basis.

 Chapter 27: Ten Ways to Make Vegan Living Extraordinary
Write About Veganism
Every year the Vegetarian Resource Group holds a contest for the best essay 
written on the topic of vegetarian and vegan living. Entering the contest helps 
you form your ideas and arguments into a logical, well-formulated framework, 
and can win you some notoriety and a $50 savings bond! Visit www.vrg.
org/essay for more details. You must be under 19 to enter.
Adults can set their pens to paper as well, however. Writing an article or 
op-ed piece for your local paper is a great way to focus your passion and 
express a point of view that others in your community may not have consid­
ered. Whether you’re compelled to write about a recent puppy mill scandal in 
your home state or the terrible nutrition standards in your school cafeteria, 
your voice will help to broaden the debate. Make it known within the article 
that you’re vegan, what that means, and why it’s relevant to the issue at 
hand.
Hold a Fundraiser for Your Local 
No-Kill Animal Shelter
Some animal shelters are dedicated to providing homes for little lost Fidos 
and Fluffys. These shelters refuse to kill the animals — even if they can’t find 
a suitable adoptive family for them. These shelters are always in need of 
funding to house, feed, and provide medical services to the animals.
Holding a vegan bake sale, garage sale, or other fundraiser offers you a 
chance to put your passion to work constructively. You can raise money and 
gently offer information to customers and passersby about the shelter. You 
may be able to get copies of a pamphlet from the shelter itself, or you can 
simply make a homemade flyer listing the contact information, mission state­
ment, and name of the shelter.
Meditate and Set Intentions at Mealtime
Every time you sit down to eat, take a few moments to quiet your mind, 
take a few deep breaths, and check in with your body. What does it need? 
Is it thirsty? Is it calm or angry? Are you anxious or unhappy? Bringing that 
awareness to each meal helps you in deciding what to eat, how quickly to eat 
it, and how much to consume. This is the simplest meditation for the body 
and mind.

342
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Eating slowly improves digestion and allows your body to use the nutrients 
from your meal better. By chewing each mouthful thoroughly and slowing 
your eating down, your body has more time to communicate with your brain, 
which leads more quickly to a feeling of fullness. People generally eat less 
this way and experience less indigestion. Try to make each meal last at least 
30 minutes by putting your fork down between bites, chewing until each bite 
is liquefied. And turn off the television during meals.
	
Setting an intention at each meal to be kind to yourself and nourish your body 
in whatever way is best at that moment can bring a new level of awareness to 
your entire life. Other intentions can be to send out prayers for peace, calm in 
the world, compassion for all living creatures, or thoughts for strengthening 
your community.
Vote Your Truth: Compassion in Action
Register to vote, and update your registration every time you move. Get to 
know the candidates and legislation coming up in each election cycle. For 
instance, where do the candidates stand on issues that are important to you? 
What impact would a new piece of legislation have on your life? Do you agree 
with the values it promotes?
National and state animal rights groups have been successful in changing the 
laws to better protect farm animals in the last few years through dedication, 
donors, volunteers, and voters. Be part of the movement and vote! It’s your 
duty as a citizen to take an active role in the democratic process.
Become a Pro in the Kitchen
Cooking basic, healthy meals should be a requirement for every human being 
who graduates from high school. Can’t cook at all, you say? Never fear! You’d 
be surprised at how many people would be willing to help you, either for free 
or very cheaply. Here are a few ways to get some help:
	
✓	Ask an older, trusted adult for his advice. Tell him that you can’t cook 
and that you want to learn. Then ask whether he knows anyone who 
can help you learn. Chances are he’ll let you follow him around in the 
kitchen. Or he may even work with you on vegan recipes you want to 
master — as long as he can share in the finished product, of course.
	
✓	Get your friends together for a cooking party. E-mail the recipe to 
everyone beforehand, have all the ingredients ready, and work together 
to create a lovely meal. Don’t be afraid to ask questions along the way 
and dive in to help with techniques you haven’t tried before.

343
 Chapter 27: Ten Ways to Make Vegan Living Extraordinary
	
✓	Look around your area for vegan cooking classes. Community colleges, 
vegan restaurants, health counselors, and cooking schools may offer 
just what you’re looking for.
	
✓	Look for a knife skills class at your local culinary school or community 
college. Discovering how to care for your knives and properly cut and 
prepare vegetables is amazingly empowering. You’ll want to cook more 
right away just to practice your new skills!
	
✓	Ask a local professional chef (private or from a restaurant you like) 
to teach you a few private classes. You can choose the menu and tech­
niques, and you can either have the chef bring the ingredients to your 
home or hold the class in his kitchen. Get a group of friends together for 
a group class, which would probably cost less for each person than if 
you did it on your own.
	
✓	Try something new. Experiment with a new recipe at least once a week. 
Countless vegan recipes from every ethnic background are available on 
the Internet. Many of these recipes have comments from other home 
cooks, which can help you avoid possible mistakes in the original recipe. 
If you need some ideas to get started, try recipes from www.vegweb.
com, www.veganchef.com, or www.fatfreevegan.com.
Start a Vegan Victory Garden
The idea to contribute to your own health and the environment was given 
a huge boost in March 2009 when President and Mrs. Obama participated 
in planning a large organic garden on the White House lawn. Large plots of 
land like the one at the White House aren’t necessary, however; even the 
smallest apartment can house a mini-farm. Container gardening can produce 
lettuce, herbs, tomatoes, green beans, carrots, and berries (and virtually any 
other type of veggie, as long as you choose the proper variety and have a big 
enough pot).
If you have access to more land and are inclined to get busy in the garden, 
you can grow a considerable amount of food with a little research and a few 
seasons worth of patience. An acre of arable land can produce thousands of 
pounds of strawberries, potatoes, corn, or lettuce. For an amazing selection 
of organic and heirloom seeds, look around www.seedsofchange.com.
	
A great resource for getting to know the local land and what you can expect 
when you start your own Victory Garden are local County Extension offices. 
Every state has offices staffed with experts who supply useful information to 
the public regarding planting season, local native varieties, information on soil 
health, and sources for seeds and tools.

344
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Be More Free-Gan with Used Goods
Vegans can get even more eco street cred by looking for ways to be free-gan, 
or buying, borrowing, and finding used items instead of buying brand-new 
goods. Start looking for used items that are free — in New York City we call 
this dumpster diving or trash picking. Instead of buying new or used items, 
you often can find a free item that someone else doesn’t need anymore. Why 
is dumpster diving a great thing to do? Picking up that old bookshelf from 
the curb keeps it out of the landfill, saves you money, and prevents natural 
resources from being overused to create new items.
Some communities have scheduled “clean out” weekends where people put 
items out on their curbs or sidewalks. The stuff is then fair game for anyone 
who wants to pick it up and take it home. Not only does it save everyone 
money by reducing garbage collection fees, it redistributes goods to people 
who are in need and can’t necessarily afford to buy new things.
You also can go online and join Freecycle.org to post items you want to part 
with. Other users will then respond and schedule a time to pick up that old 
sofa bed that’s clogging your walking path through the living room.
