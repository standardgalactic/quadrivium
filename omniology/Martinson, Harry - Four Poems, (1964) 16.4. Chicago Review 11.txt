 MAIDS
 All the maids of my childhood:
 souls with lonely
 and sensual eyes,
 warm monuments of high breasts
 and sturdy hips
 from the old homespun lands.
 The shouting of prompt voices at the harvest,
 unison psalms of maids in the cowshed,
 kneeling dreams among turnips,
 sour milk in jugs on the road-side
 and sullen murmurs about Olga,
 gone to Idaho.
 Many maids sat there empty
 with hanging souls;
 but some of them were proud, thoughtful and maternal women,
 with sullen musical voices
 murmurs that go after tales.
 There were maids with virginal dark,
 with legends in the shawl
 and large questions in the light eyes of a doe.
 With white breath
 Maria crossed
 the cold autumn scene of the world.
 There was the plantive, celestial maid of the guitar
 and the untidy outdoor-dreamer of dancing
 and the obstinate sailor-maid.

 But strangest of them all: the one nostalgic and yearning
 for the autumn twilight,
 the sad and heavy priestess of the separator,
 who bowed and pulled, bowed and pulled
 the milk-roaring Alfa-Laval
 with the open fire
 mirrored
 in wondering eyes.
 Then the song went up
 from the enchanted soil
 like heavy ore.
 The voices were sullen,
 the child looked surprised in the cradle,
 the hunting-dog rose its eyes.
 Was it not the song of eternal farmers,
 the ore of a generous soil.
 ROPE DANCER'S PLOT
 Mainly the art of not
 getting tired,
 to change feet with grace
 above the cleft
 and try to have a nice gait.
 Friends and unfriends adjusted
 and alloted
 like invisible weights
 on the sunshade's edge.
 And the pain straight in the heart.
 The same main line for joy
 and for thought.
 Smile on top of depths.

 AFTERWARDS
 After the battle of Helgoland
 and after the battle of Utshima
 the sea undid the already shipwrecked,
 prepared them with its secret acids
 and let the albatrosses devour their eyes,
 discharging them with dissolving salts
 slowly towards the sea?
 towards the original Cambrian waters,
 towards another essay.
 CREATION NIGHT
 We met at the stonebridge,
 the birches were on watch
 and the bright stream slunk off to the sea.
 We got together to make God,
 murmurs encouraged the autumn grain
 and the rye launched a wave.
