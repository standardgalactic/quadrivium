Preface
In keeping with our focus on space for covers for our book, we have 
chosen the NASA Voyager spacecraft for the sixth edition. The reason 
for this is that like any spacecraft there are many circuits that play criti -
cal roles in their functionality. The beginning of the Voyager 1 and 2 
odyssey began on August 20, 1977, for Voyager 2 and on September 5, 
1977, for Voyager 1. Both were launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space 
Center in Florida. The Voyager 1 was launched on a faster orbit so it 
eventually became the first man-made object to leave our solar system. 
There is some debate over whether it has actually left the solar system, 
but it certainly will at some point in time. Voyager 2 and two Pioneer 
spacecraft will also leave the solar system at some point in time.
Voyager 1 is still functioning and sending back data, a truly signifi-
cant achievement for NASA engineers. The design processes that make 
the Voyager operate so reliably are based on the fundamentals discussed 
in this textbook. Finally, space is vast so that Voyager 1 will fly past 
other solar systems; the odds of actually coming into contact with some-
thing are so remote that it may virtually fly through the universe forever! 
For more about Voyager 1, go to NASA’s website: www.nasa.gov/. 
Features
New to This Edition
We have added learning objectives to each chapter to reflect what we 
believe are the most important items to learn from each chapter. These
 
should help you focus more carefully on what you should be learning.
There are more than 580 revised end-of-chapter problems, new end-
of-chapter problems, and revised practice problems. We continue to try and 
make our problems as practical as possible.
In addition, we have improved Connect for this edition by increasing 
the number of problems available substantially. Now, professors may select 
from more than a thousand problems as they build thier online homework 
assignments. 
We have also built SmartBook for this edition. With SmartBook, stu -
dents get the same text as the print version, along with personalized tips on 
what to study next, thanks to SmartBook’s adaptive technology.
Retained from Previous Editions
A course in circuit analysis is perhaps the first exposure students have 
to electrical engineering. This is also a place where we can enhance  
some of the skills that they will later need as they learn how to design. 
An important part of this book is our 121 design a problem problems. 
These problems were developed to enhance skills that are an impor -
tant part of the design process. We know it is not possible to fully de-
velop a student’s design skills in a fundamental course like circuits. 
To fully develop design skills a student needs a design experience

Preface
normally reserved for their senior year. This does not mean that some 
of those skills cannot be developed and exercised in a circuits course. 
The text already included open-ended questions that help students
 
use creativity, which is an important part of learning how to design. 
We already have some questions that are open-ended but we desired 
to add much more into our text in this important area and have devel-
oped an approach to do just that. When we develop problems for the 
student to solve our goal is that in solving the problem the student
 
learns more about the theory and the problem solving process. Why 
not have the students design problems like we do? That is exactly 
what we do in each chapter. Within the normal problem set, we have 
a set of problems where we ask the student to design a problem to 
help other students better understand an important concept. This has  
two very important results. The first will be a better understanding of 
the basic theory and the second will be the enhancement of some of  
the student’s basic design skills. We are making effective use of the  
principle of learning by teaching. Essentially we all learn better when 
we teach a subject. Designing effective problems is a key part of
 
the teaching process. Students should also be encouraged to develop 
problems, when appropriate, which have nice numbers and do not
 
necessarily overemphasize complicated mathematical manipulations.
 
A very important advantage to our textbook, we have a total of 2,481 
Examples, Practice Problems, Review Questions, and End-of-Chapter 
Problems! Answers are provided for all practice problems and the odd 
numbered end-of-chapter problems.
 
The main objective of the sixth edition of this book remains the 
same as the previous editions—to present circuit analysis in a manner 
that is clearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than other cir -
cuit textbooks, and to assist the student in beginning to see the “fun” in 
engineering. This objective is achieved in the following ways:
 • Chapter Openers and Summaries
Each chapter opens with a discussion about how to enhance skills
 
which contribute to successful problem solving as well as success -
ful careers or a career-oriented talk on a subdiscipline of electrical  
engineering. This is followed by an introduction that links the chap-
ter with the previous chapters and states the chapter objectives. The  
chapter ends with a summary of key points and formulas.
 • Problem-Solving Methodology
Chapter 1 introduces a six-step method for solving circuit problems 
which is used consistently throughout the book and media supple -
ments to promote best-practice problem-solving procedures.
 • Student-Friendly Writing Style
All principles are presented in a lucid, logical, step-by-step man
-
ner. As much as possible, we avoid wordiness and giving too much 
detail that could hide concepts and impede overall understanding of 
the material.
 • Boxed Formulas and Key Terms
Important formulas are boxed as a means of helping students sort 
out what is essential from what is not. Also, to ensure that students 
clearly understand the key elements of the subject matter, key terms 
are defined and highlighted.

Preface
xiii
 • Margin Notes
Marginal notes are used as a pedagogical aid. They serve multiple 
uses such as hints, cross-references, more exposition, warnings, 
 reminders not to make some particular common mistakes, and prob-
lem-solving insights.
 • Worked Examples
Thoroughly worked examples are liberally given at the end of ev -
ery section. The examples are regarded as a part of the text and are 
clearly explained without asking the reader to fill in missing steps. 
Thoroughly worked examples give students a good understanding 
of the solution process and the confidence to solve problems them-
selves. Some of the problems are solved in two or three different 
ways to facilitate a substantial comprehension of the subject mate -
rial as well as a comparison of different approaches.
 • Practice Problems
To give students practice opportunity, each illustrative example is 
immediately followed by a practice problem with the answer. The 
student can follow the example step-by-step to aid in the solution of 
the practice problem without flipping pages or looking at the end of 
the book for answers. The practice problem is also intended to test a 
student’s understanding of the preceding example. It will reinforce 
their grasp of the material before the student can move on to the 
next section. Complete solutions to the practice problems are avail-
able to students on the website.
 • Application Sections
The last section in each chapter is devoted to practical application 
aspects of the concepts covered in the chapter. The material covered 
in the chapter is applied to at least one or two practical problems 
or devices. This helps students see how the concepts are applied to 
real-life situations.
 • Review Questions
Ten review questions in the form of multiple-choice objective items 
are provided at the end of each chapter with answers. The review 
questions are intended to cover the little “tricks” that the examples 
and end-of-chapter problems may not cover. They serve as a self 
test device and help students determine how well they have mas
-
tered the chapter.
 • Computer Tools
In recognition of the requirements by ABET
® on integrating 
 computer tools, the use of PSpice, Multisim, MATLAB, KCIDE for 
Circuits, and developing design skills are encouraged in a student-  
friendly manner. PSpice is covered early on in the text so that stu -
dents can become familiar and use it throughout the text. Tutorials 
on all of these are available on Connect. MATLAB is also introduced 
early in the book.
 • Design a Problem Problems
Finally, design a problem problems are meant to help the student de-
velop skills that will be needed in the design process.
 • Historical Tidbits
Historical sketches throughout the text provide profiles of important 
pioneers and events relevant to the study of electrical  engineering.

xiv 
Preface
 • Early Op Amp Discussion
  
The operational amplifier (op amp) as a basic element is introduced 
early in the text.
 • Fourier and Laplace Transforms Coverage
  
To ease the transition between the circuit course and signals and 
systems courses, Fourier and Laplace transforms are covered lu
-
cidly and thoroughly. The chapters are developed in a manner that 
the interested instructor can go from solutions of first-order circuits 
to Chapter 15. This then allows a very natural progression from 
 Laplace to Fourier to AC.
 • Four-Color Art Program
  
An interior design and four-color art program bring circuit drawings 
to life and enhance key pedagogical elements throughout the text.
 • Extended Examples
  
Examples worked in detail according to the six-step problem solv -
ing method provide a road map for students to solve problems in a 
consistent fashion. At least one example in each chapter is devel
-
oped in this manner.
 • EC 2000 Chapter Openers
  
Based on ABET’s skill-based CRITERION 3, these chapter openers 
are devoted to discussions as to how students can acquire the skills 
that will lead to a significantly enhanced career as an engineer. Be-
cause these skills are so very important to the student while still in 
college as well after graduation, we use the heading, 
“Enhancing 
your Skills and your Career.”
 • Homework Problems
  
There are 580 new or revised end-of-chapter problems and changed 
practice problems which will provide students with plenty of practice 
as well as reinforce key  concepts.
 • Homework Problem Icons
  
Icons are used to highlight problems that relate to engineering de -
sign as well as problems that can be solved using PSpice, Multisim, 
KCIDE, or MATLAB.
Organization
This book was written for a two-semester or three-quarter course in 
linear circuit analysis. The book may also be used for a one-semester 
course by a proper selection of chapters and sections by the instructor. It 
is broadly divided into three parts.
 • Part 1, consisting of Chapters 1 to 8, is devoted to dc circuits. It 
covers the fundamental laws and theorems, circuits techniques, and 
passive and active elements.
 • Part 2, which contains Chapter 9 to 14, deals with ac circuits. It 
introduces phasors, sinusoidal steady-state analysis, ac power, rms 
values, three-phase systems, and frequency response.
 • Part 3, consisting of Chapters 15 to 19, are devoted to advanced 
techniques for network analysis. It provides students with a solid 
introduction to the Laplace transform, Fourier series, Fourier trans-
form, and two-port network analysis.

Preface
xv
The material in the three parts is more than sufficient for a two-semester 
course, so the instructor must select which chapters or sections to cover. 
Sections marked with the dagger sign (†) may be skipped, explained 
briefly, or assigned as homework. They can be omitted without loss of 
continuity. Each chapter has plenty of problems grouped according to the 
sections of the related material and diverse enough that the instructor can 
choose some as examples and assign some as homework. As stated ear -
lier, we are using three icons with this edition. We are using 
 to de-
note problems that either require PSpice in the  solution process, where 
the circuit complexity is such that PSpice or Multisim would make the 
solution process easier, and where PSpice or Multisim makes a good 
check to see if the problem has been solved correctly. We are using 
to denote problems where MATLAB is required in the solution process, 
where MATLAB makes sense because of the problem makeup and its 
complexity, and where MATLAB makes a good check to see if the prob-
lem has been solved correctly. Finally, we use 
 to identify problems 
that help the student develop skills that are needed for engineering 
 design. More difficult problems are marked with an asterisk (*).
 
Comprehensive problems follow the end-of-chapter problems. They 
are mostly applications problems that require skills learned from that 
 particular chapter.
Prerequisites
As with most introductory circuit courses, the main prerequisites, for a 
course using this textbook, are physics and calculus. Although familiar-
ity with complex numbers is helpful in the later part of the book, it is not 
required. A very important asset of this text is that ALL the mathemati -
cal equations and fundamentals of physics needed by the student, are 
included in the text.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.a), “an ability to apply knowledge 
of mathematics, science, and engineering.”
As students, you are required to study mathematics, science, and engi-
neering with the purpose of being able to apply that kno wledge to the 
solution of engineering problems. The skill here is the ability to apply 
the fundamentals of these areas in the solution of a problem. So how do 
you develop and enhance this skill?
The best approach is to w ork as man y problems as possible in all 
of your courses. However, if you are really going to be successful with 
this, you must spend time analyzing where and when and why you have 
difficulty in easily arriving at successful solutions. You may be surprised 
to learn that most of your problem-solving problems are with mathemat-
ics rather than your understanding of theory . You may also learn that 
you start working the problem too soon. Taking time to think about the 
problem and ho w you should solv e it will al ways save you time and 
frustration in the end.
What I have found that works best for me is to apply our six-
step  problem-solving technique. Then I carefully identify the areas 
where I ha ve dif ficulty solving the problem. Many times, my actual 
deficiencies are in my understanding and ability to use correctly certain 
mathematical principles. I then return to my fundamental math texts and 
carefully review the appropriate sections, and in some cases, work some 
example problems in that text. This brings me to another important thing 
you should always do: Keep nearby all your basic mathematics, science, 
and engineering textbooks.
This process of continually looking up material you thought you 
had acquired in earlier courses may seem v ery tedious at first; however, 
as your skills de velop and your kno wledge increases, this process will 
become easier and easier. On a personal note, it is this very process that 
led me from being a much less than a
verage student to someone who 
could earn a Ph.D. and become a successful researcher.

Chapter 1  Basic Concepts
1.1
 Introduction
Electric circuit theory and electromagnetic theory are the tw
o funda -
mental theories upon which all branches of electrical engineering are 
built. Many branches of electrical engineering, such as po wer, electric 
machines, control, electronics, communications, and instrumentation, 
are based on electric circuit theory . Therefore, the basic electric circuit 
theory course is the most important course for an electrical engineering 
student, and al ways an e xcellent starting point for a be ginning student 
in electrical engineering education. Circuit theory is also v
aluable to 
students specializing in other branches of the ph ysical sciences because 
circuits are a good model for the study of energy systems in general, and 
because of the applied mathematics, physics, and topology involved.
In electrical engineering, we are often interested in communicating 
or transferring energy from one point to another . To do this requires an 
interconnection of electrical devices. Such interconnection is referred to 
as an electric circuit, and each component of the circuit is kno wn as an 
element.
An electric circuit is an interconnection of electrical elements.
A simple electric circuit is sho wn in Fig. 1.1. It consists of three 
basic elements: a battery, a lamp, and connecting wires. Such a simple 
circuit can e xist by itself; it has se veral applications, such as a flash- 
light, a search light, and so forth.
A complicated real circuit is displayed in Fig. 1.2, representing the  
schematic diagram for a radio receiver. Although it seems complicated, 
this circuit can be analyzed using the techniques we co ver in this book. 
Our goal in this text is to learn various analytical techniques and  computer 
software applications for describing the behavior of a circuit like this.
Electric circuits are used in numerous electrical systems to accomplish 
different tasks. Our objecti ve in this book is not the study of  various uses 
and applications of circuits. Rather, our major concern is the analysis of the 
circuits. By the analysis of a circuit, we mean a study of the behavior of the 
Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Understand the different units with which engineers work.
2. Understand the relationship between charge and current and 
how to use both in a variety of applications.
3. Understand voltage and how it can be used in a variety of 
applications.
4. Develop an understanding of power and energy and their 
relationship with current and voltage.
5. Begin to understand the volt-amp characteristics of a variety of 
circuit elements.
6. Begin to understand an organized approach to problem solving 
and how it can be used to assist in your efforts to solve circuit 
problems.

circuit: How does it respond to a gi ven input? How do the interconnected 
elements and devices in the circuit interact?
We commence our study by defining some basic concepts. These 
concepts include char ge, current, v oltage, circuit elements, po wer, and 
energy. Before defining these concepts, we must first establish a system 
of units that we will use throughout the text.
1.2
 Systems of Units
As electrical engineers, we must deal with measurable quantities. Our mea-
surements, however, must be communicated in a standard language that
 
virtually all professionals can understand, irrespecti
ve of the country in 
which the measurement is conducted. Such an international measurement
 
language is the International System of Units (SI), adopted by the General 
Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. In this system, there are seven 
base units from which the units of all other ph ysical quantities can be de -
rived. Table 1.1 shows six base units and one derived unit (the coulomb) that 
are related to this text. SI units are commonly used in electrical engineering.
One great advantage of the SI unit is that it uses prefixes based on the 
power of 10 to relate larger and smaller units to the basic unit. Table 1.2 
shows the SI prefixes and their symbols. For example, the following are 
expressions of the same distance in meters (m):

Chapter 1  Basic Concepts
1.3
 Charge and Current
The concept of electric charge is the underlying principle for explaining 
all electrical phenomena. Also, the most basic quantity in an electric cir-
cuit is the electric charge. We all experience the effect of electric charge 
when we try to remove our wool sweater and have it stick to our body or 
walk across a carpet and receive a shock.
Charge is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter 
consists, measured in coulombs (C).
We know from elementary physics that all matter is made of funda-
mental building blocks known as atoms and that each atom consists of 
electrons, protons, and neutrons. We also know that the char ge e on an 
electron is negative and equal in magnitude to 1.602 × 10−19 C, while a 
proton carries a positi ve charge of the same magnitude as the electron. 
The presence of equal numbers of protons and electrons leaves an atom 
neutrally charged.
The following points should be noted about electric charge:
1. The coulomb is a large unit for charges. In 1 C of charge, there are  
1∕(1.602 × 10−19) = 6.24 × 1018 electrons. Thus realistic or labora-
tory values of charges are on the order of pC, nC, or μC.1
2. According to e xperimental observ ations, the only char
ges that 
occur in nature are inte
gral multiples of the electronic char
ge 
e = −1.602 × 10−19 C.
3. The law of conservation of charge states that charge can neither be 
created nor destroyed, only transferred. Thus, the algebraic sum of 
the electric charges in a system does not change.
We now consider the flow of electric char ges. A unique feature of 
electric charge or electricity is the f act that it is mobile; that is, it can 
be transferred from one place to another , where it can be con verted to 
another form of energy.
When a conducting wire (consisting of several atoms) is connected 
to a battery (a source of electromotive force), the charges are compelled 
to move; positive charges move in one direction while negative charges 
move in the opposite direction. 
This motion of char ges creates elec -
tric current. It is conventional to take the current flow as the movement 
of positive charges. That is, opposite to the flow of ne gative charges, 
as Fig.  1.3 illustrates. This con vention w as introduced by Benjamin 
Franklin (1706–1790), the American scientist and in ventor. Although 
we now know that current in metallic conductors is due to ne
gatively 
charged electrons, we will follo w the uni versally accepted con vention 
that current is the net flow of positive charges. Thus,
Electric current is the time rate of change of charge, measured in 
amperes (A).
Mathematically, the relationship between current i, charge q, and time t is
 
i   =    
Δ    dq 
___  
dt    
(1.1)
A convention is a standard way of 
 describing something so that others in 
the profession can understand what 
we mean. We will be using IEEE 
conventions throughout this book.

where current is measured in amperes (A), and
1 ampere = 1 coulomb/second

both sides of Eq. (1.1). We obtain

Δ    ∫

(1.2)
The way we define current as i in Eq. (1.1) suggests that current need not 
be a constant-valued function. As many of the examples and problems in 
this chapter and subsequent chapters suggest, there can be se veral types 
of current; that is, charge can vary with time in several ways.
There are different ways of looking at direct current and alternating 
current. The best definition is that there are two ways that current can 
flow: It can always flow in the same direction, where it does not reverse 
direction, in which case we have direct current (dc). These currents can 
be constant or time varying. If the current flows in both directions, then 
we have alternating current (ac).
A direct current (dc) flows only in one direction and can be constant 
or time varying.
By convention, we will use the symbol I to represent a constant current. 
If the current v aries with respect to time (either dc or ac) we will use 
the symbol i. A common use of this w ould be the output of a rectifier 
(dc) such as i(t) = ∣5 sin(377t)∣ amps or a sinusoidal current (ac) such as 
i(t) = 160 sin(377t) amps.
An alternating current (ac) is a current that changes direction with 
respect to time.
An example of alternating current (ac) is the current you use in your 
house to run the air conditioner
, refrigerator , w ashing machine, and 
other electric appliances. Figure 1.4 depicts tw o common e xamples of 
Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836), a French mathematician and 
physicist, laid the foundation of electrodynamics. He defined the electric 
current and developed a way to measure it in the 1820s.
Born in Lyons, France, Ampere at age 12 mastered Latin in a few 
weeks, as he was intensely interested in mathematics and many of the 
best mathematical works were in Latin. He was a brilliant scientist and a 
prolific writer. He formulated the laws of electromagnetics. He in vented 
the electromagnet and the ammeter. The unit of electric current, the 
ampere, was named after him.

dc (coming from a battery) and ac (coming from your home outlets). We 
will consider other types later in the book.
Once we define current as the movement of charge, we expect cur-
rent to have an associated direction of flow. As mentioned earlier, the di-
rection of current flow is conventionally taken as the direction of positive 
charge movement. Based on this convention, a current of 5 A may be rep-
resented positively or negatively as shown in Fig. 1.5. In other words, a 
negative current of −5 A flowing in one direction as shown in Fig. 1.5(b) 
is the same as a current of +5 A flowing in the opposite direction.

Example 1.1
How much charge is represented by 4,600 electrons?
Solution:
Each electron has 
−1.602 × 10 −19 C. Hence 4,600 electrons will 
have −1.602 × 10−19 C/electron × 4,600 electrons = −7.369 × 10−16 C

Calculate the current at t = 0.5 s.
Solution:
i =    dq 
___ 
dt    =    d 
__ 
dt    (5t sin 4πt) mC/s = (5 sin 4πt + 20πt cos 4πt) mA
At t = 0.5,
i = 5 sin 2π + 10π cos 2π = 0 + 10π = 31.42 mA

 Voltage
As explained briefly in the previous section, to mo ve the electron in a 
conductor in a particular direction requires some w ork or energy trans-
fer. This work is performed by an e xternal electromotive force (emf), 
typically represented by the battery in Fig. 1.3. This emf is also kno wn 
as voltage or potential difference. The voltage vab between two points a 
and b in an electric circuit is the energy (or work) needed to move a unit 
charge from b to a; mathematically,
 
vab   = 
Δ   dw 
___ 
dq    
(1.3)
where w is energy in joules (J) and q is charge in coulombs (C). The volt-
age vab or simply v is measured in volts (V), named in honor of the Italian 
physicist Alessandro Antonio Volta (1745–1827), who invented the first 
voltaic battery. From Eq. (1.3), it is evident that
1 volt = 1 joule/coulomb = 1 newton-meter/coulomb
Thus,
Voltage (or potential difference) is the energy required to move a 
unit charge from a reference point (−) to another point (+), measured in 
volts (V).
Figure 1.6 sho ws the v oltage across an element (represented by 
a rectangular block) connected to points 
a and b. The plus ( +) and 
minus (−) signs are used to define reference direction or voltage polarity. 
The vab can be interpreted in two ways: (1) Point a is at a potential of vab
volts higher than point b, or (2) the potential at point a with respect to 
point b is vab. It follows logically that in general
 
vab = −vba 
(1.4)
For example, in Fig. 1.7, we have two representations of the same volt-
age. In Fig. 1.7(a), point a is +9 V above point b; in Fig. 1.7(b), point 
b is −9 V above point a. We may say that in Fig. 1.7(a), there is a 9-V 
voltage drop from a to b or equivalently a 9-V voltage rise from b to a. 
In other words, a voltage drop from a to b is equivalent to a voltage rise 
from b to a.
Current and voltage are the tw o basic variables in electric circuits. 
The common term signal is used for an electric quantity such as a current 
or a voltage (or even electromagnetic wave) when it is used for conveying

information. Engineers prefer to call such v ariables signals rather than 
mathematical functions of time because of their importance in commu -
nications and other disciplines. Like  electric current, a constant voltage 
is called a dc voltage and is  represented by V, whereas a sinusoidally 
time-varying voltage is called an ac voltage and is represented by v. A dc 
voltage is commonly produced by a battery; ac v oltage is produced by 
an electric generator.

 Power and Energy
Although current and v oltage are the tw o basic variables in an electric 
circuit, the y are not suf ficient by themselves. F or practical purposes, 
we need to kno w how much power an electric de vice can handle. We 
all know from experience that a 100-w att bulb gives more light than a  
60-watt bulb. We also know that when we pay our bills to the electric 
utility companies, we are paying for the electric energy consumed over 
a certain period of time. Thus, power and energy calculations are impor-
tant in circuit analysis.
To relate power and energy to voltage and current, we recall from 
physics that:
Power is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in 
watts (W).
We write this relationship as
 
p   =    
Δ    dw 
___ 
dt    
(1.5)
Keep in mind that electric current is 
 always through an element and that 
electric voltage is always across the 
 element or between two points.
Historical
Alessandro Antonio Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist, in -
vented the electric battery—which provided the first continuous flow of 
electricity—and the capacitor.
Born into a noble family in Como, Italy, Volta was performing 
electrical experiments at age 18. His invention of the battery in 1796 
revolutionized the use of electricity. The publication of his work in 1800 
marked the beginning of electric circuit theory. Volta received many 
honors during his lifetime. The unit of voltage or potential difference, 
the volt, was named in his honor.

where p is power in watts (W), w is energy in joules (J), and t is time in 
seconds (s). From Eqs. (1.1), (1.3), and (1.5), it follows that
p =    dw 
___ 
dt    =    dw 
___ 
dq    ⋅    dq 
__ 
dt    = vi 
(1.6)
or
 
p = vi
 
(1.7)
The power p in Eq. (1.7) is a time-varying quantity and is called the instan-
taneous power. Thus, the power absorbed or supplied by an element is the  
product of the voltage across the element and the current through it. If the  
power has a + sign, power is being delivered to or absorbed by the element. If, 
on the other hand, the power has a − sign, power is being supplied by the ele-
ment. But how do we know when the power has a negative or a positive sign?
Current direction and voltage polarity play a major role in determin-
ing the sign of po wer. It is therefore important that we pay attention to 
the relationship between current i and voltage v in Fig. 1.8(a). The volt-
age polarity and current direction must conform with those sho
wn in 
Fig. 1.8(a) in order for the power to have a positive sign. This is known 
as the passive sign convention. By the passive sign convention, current 
enters through the positive polarity of the voltage. In this case, p = +vi or  
vi > 0 implies that the element is absorbing power. However, if p = −vi 
or vi < 0, as in Fig. 1.8(b), the element is releasing or supplying power.
Passive sign convention is satisfied when the current enters through the 
positive terminal of an element and p = +vi. If the current enters through 
the negative terminal, p = −vi.
Unless otherwise stated, we will follow the passive sign convention 
throughout this text. For example, the element in both circuits of Fig. 1.9 
has an absorbing power of +12 W because a positive current enters the 
positive terminal in both cases. In Fig. 1.10, ho
wever, the element is 
supplying power of +12 W because a positive current enters the nega-
tive terminal. Of course, an absorbing power of −12 W is equivalent to a 
supplying power of +12 W. In general,
+Power absorbed = −Power supplied
In fact, the law of conservation of energy must be obeyed in any 
electric circuit. For this reason, the algebraic sum of po wer in a circuit, 
at any instant of time, must be zero:
∑ p = 0
 
(1.8)
This again confirms the fact that the total po wer supplied to the circuit 
must balance the total power absorbed.
From Eq. (1.6), the energy absorbed or supplied by an element from 
time t0 to time t is
 
w =  ∫

1884 Exhibition In the United States, nothing promoted the future of 
electricity like the 1884 International Electrical Exhibition. Just imagine 
a world without electricity, a world illuminated by candles and gaslights, 
a world where the most common transportation was by walking and rid-
ing on horseback or by horse-drawn carriage. Into this world an exhibi -
tion was  created that highlighted Thomas Edison and reflected his highly 
developed  ability to promote his inventions and products. His exhibit 
featured spectacular lighting displays powered by an impressive 100-kW 
“Jumbo”  generator.
Edward Weston’s dynamos and lamps were featured in the United 
States Electric Lighting Company’s display. Weston’s well known col -
lection of scientific instruments was also shown.
Other prominent exhibitors included Frank Sprague, Elihu Thompson, 
and the Brush Electric Company of Cleveland. The American Institute of 
Electrical Engineers (AIEE) held its first technical meeting on October 7–8 
at the Franklin Institute during the exhibit. AIEE merged with the Institute 
of Radio Engineers (IRE) in 1964 to form the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

 Circuit Elements
As we discussed in Section 1.1, an element is the basic building block of 
a circuit. An electric circuit is simply an interconnection of the elements. 
Circuit analysis is the process of determining voltages across (or the cur-
rents through) the elements of the circuit.
There are tw o types of elements found in electric circuits: pas-
sive elements and active elements. An active element is capable of  
generating energy while a passive element is not. Examples of passive 
elements are resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Typical active ele-
ments include generators, batteries, and operational amplifiers. Our 
aim in this section is to g ain familiarity with some important acti ve 
elements.
The most important acti ve elements are v oltage or current sources 
that generally deliver power to the circuit connected to them. There are 
two kinds of sources: independent and dependent sources.
An ideal independent source is an active element that provides a 
speci fied voltage or current that is completely independent of other 
circuit elements.
In other words, an ideal independent voltage source delivers to the circuit 
whatever current is necessary to maintain its terminal v oltage. Physical 
sources such as batteries and generators may be regarded as approxima-
tions to ideal voltage sources. Figure 1.11 sho ws the symbols for inde -
pendent voltage sources. Notice that both symbols in Fig. 1.11(a) and 
(b) can be used to represent a dc v
oltage source, b ut only the symbol 
in Fig. 1.11(a) can be used for a time-v arying voltage source. Similar-
ly, an ideal independent current source is an active element that pro-
vides a specified current completely independent of the voltage across 
the source. That is, the current source deli vers to the circuit whate ver

voltage is necessary to maintain the designated current. The symbol for 
an independent current source is displayed in Fig. 1.12, where the arrow 
indicates the direction of current i.
An ideal dependent (or controlled) source is an active element in 
which the source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current.
Dependent sources are usually designated by diamond-shaped sym
-
bols, as shown in Fig. 1.13. Since the control of the dependent source is 
achieved by a voltage or current of some other element in the circuit, and 
the source can be voltage or current, it follows that there are four possible 
types of dependent sources, namely:
1. A voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS).
2. A current-controlled voltage source (CCVS).
3. A voltage-controlled current source (VCCS).
4. A current-controlled current source (CCCS).
Dependent sources are useful in modeling elements such as transistors, 
operational amplifiers, and integrated circuits. An example of a current-
controlled voltage source is sho wn on the right-hand side of Fig. 1.14, 
where the voltage 10i of the v oltage source depends on the current i 
through element C. Students might be surprised that the value of the de-
pendent voltage source is 10 i V (and not 10 i A) because it is a v oltage 
source. The key idea to keep in mind is that a voltage source comes with 
polarities (+ −) in its symbol, while a current source comes with an ar -
row, irrespective of what it depends on.
It should be noted that an ideal v oltage source (dependent or in -
dependent) will produce any current required to ensure that the termi -
nal voltage is as stated, whereas an ideal current source will produce
 
the necessary voltage to ensure the stated current flow. Thus, an ideal 
source could in theory supply an infinite amount of energy. It should 
also be noted that not only do sources supply po wer to a circuit, the y 
can absorb power from a circuit too. For a voltage source, we know the 
voltage but not the current supplied or drawn by it. By the same token, 
we know the current supplied by a current source b ut not the v oltage 
across it.

Calculate the power supplied or absorbed by each element in Fig. 1.15.
Solution:
We apply the sign convention for power shown in Figs. 1.8 and 1.9. For 
p1, the 5-A current is out of the positive terminal (or into the negative 
terminal); hence,
p1 = 20(−5) = −100 W  
Supplied power
For p2 and p3, the current flows into the positive terminal of the element 
in each case.

Chapter 1  Basic Concepts
For p4, we should note that the voltage is 8 V (positive at the top), the 
same as the voltage for p3 since both the passive element and the depen-
dent source are connected to the same terminals. (Remember that v olt-
age is always measured across an element in a circuit.) Since the current 
flows out of the positive terminal,
p4 = 8(−0.2I ) = 8(−0.2 × 5) = −8 W  
Supplied power
We should observ e that the 20-V independent v
oltage source and  
0.2I dependent current source are supplying power to the rest of the net-
work, while the two passive elements are absorbing power. Also,
p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = −100 + 60 + 48 − 8 = 0
In agreement with Eq. (1.8), the total po
wer supplied equals the total 
power absorbed.
Compute the power absorbed or supplied by each component of the cir-
cuit in Fig. 1.16.

 Applications2
In this section, we will consider tw o practical applications of the con -
cepts developed in this chapter. The first one deals with the TV picture 
tube and the other with how electric utilities determine your electric bill.
1.7.1  TV Picture Tube
One important application of the motion of electrons is found in both 
the transmission and reception of TV signals. At the transmission end, a 
TV camera reduces a scene from an optical image to an electrical signal. 
Scanning is accomplished with a thin beam of electrons in an iconoscope 
camera tube.
At the receiving end, the image is reconstructed by using a cathode-
ray tube (CR T) located in the TV recei ver.3 The CRT is depicted in 
Fig. 1.17. Unlike the iconoscope tube, which produces an electron beam 
of constant intensity, the CRT beam varies in intensity according to the 
incoming signal. The electron gun, maintained at a high potential, fires 
the electron beam. The beam passes through two sets of plates for verti-
cal and horizontal deflections so that the spot on the screen where the 
beam strikes can move right and left and up and down. When the electron 
beam strikes the fluorescent screen, it gives off light at that spot. Thus, 
the beam can be made to “paint” a picture on the TV screen.

explained briefly, or assigned as homework.

1.7  Applications

Karl Ferdinand Braun and Vladimir K. Zworykin
Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850–1918), of the University of Strasbourg, 
invented the Braun cathode-ray tube in 1879. This then became the ba-
sis for the picture tube used for so many years for televisions. It is still 
the most economical device today, although the price of flat-screen sys-
tems is rapidly becoming competitive. Before the Braun tube could be  
used in television, it took the inventiveness of Vladimir K. Zworykin 
(1889–1982) to develop the iconoscope so that the modern television 
would become a reality. The iconoscope developed into the orthicon and 
the image orthicon, which allowed images to be captured and converted 
into signals that could be sent to the television receiver. Thus, the televi-
sion camera was born.

1.7.2  Electricity Bills
The second application deals with ho
w an electric utility compan y 
charges their customers. The cost of electricity depends upon the
 
amount of ener gy consumed in kilo watt-hours (kWh). (Other f actors 
that affect the cost include demand and po wer factors; we will ignore  
these for now.) However, even if a consumer uses no energy at all, there 
is a minimum service char ge the customer must pay because it costs  
money to stay connected to the po
wer line. As energy consumption 
increases, the cost per kWh drops. It is interesting to note the a
ver-
age monthly consumption of household appliances for a family of five, 
shown in Table 1.3.

 Problem Solving
Although the problems to be solved during one’s career will vary in com-
plexity and magnitude, the basic principles to be follo
wed remain the 
same. The process outlined here is the one developed by the authors over 
many years of problem solving with students, for the solution of engi
-
neering problems in industry, and for problem solving in research.
We will list the steps simply and then elaborate on them.
1. Carefully define the problem.
2. Present everything you know about the problem.
3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that 
promises the greatest likelihood of success.
4. Attempt a problem solution.
5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy.
6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solu-
tion; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the process 
again.
1. Carefully define the problem . This may be the most important 
part of the process, because it becomes the foundation for all the rest 
of the steps. In general, the presentation of engineering problems is 
Example 1.9
A homeowner consumes 700 kWh in January. Determine the electricity 
bill for the month using the following residential rate schedule:
Base monthly charge of $12.00.
First 100 kWh per month at 16 cents/kWh.
Next 200 kWh per month at 10 cents/kWh.
Over 300 kWh per month at 6 cents/kWh.
Solution:
We calculate the electricity bill as follows.
Base monthly charge = $12.00
First 100 kWh @ $0.16/k Wh = $16.00
Next 200 kWh @ $0.10/k Wh = $20.00
Remaining 400 kWh @ $0.06/k Wh = $24.00
Total charge = $72.00
Average cost =    
$72 
______________  
100 + 200 + 400     = 10.2 cents/kWh
Referring to the residential rate schedule in Example 1.9, calculate the 
average cost per kWh if only 350 kWh are consumed in July when the 
family is on vacation most of the time.
Answer: 14.571 cents/kWh.

somewhat  incomplete. You must do all you can to make sure you 
understand the problem as thoroughly as the presenter of the problem 
understands it. Time spent at this point clearly identifying the problem 
will save you considerable time and frustration later. As a student, you 
can clarify a problem statement in a textbook by asking your professor. 
A problem presented to you in industry may require that you consult 
several individuals. At this step, it is important to develop questions that 
need to be addressed before continuing the solution process. If you have 
such questions, you need to consult with the appropriate individuals or 
resources to obtain the answers to those questions. With those answers, 
you can now refine the problem, and use that refinement as the problem 
statement for the rest of the solution process.
2. Present everything you know about the problem. You are now ready 
to write down everything you know about the problem and its possible 
solutions. This important step will save you time and frustration later.
3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that  
promises the greatest likelihood of success
. Almost every problem  
will have a number of possible paths that can lead to a solution. It is
 
highly desirable to identify as many of those paths as possible. At this  
point, you also need to determine what tools are available to you, such 
as PSpice and MATLAB and other software packages that can greatly 
reduce effort and increase accuracy. Again, we want to stress that time  
spent carefully defining the problem and investigating alternative ap-
proaches to its solution will pay big dividends later. Evaluating the al -
ternatives and determining which promises the greatest likelihood of
 
success may be difficult but will be well worth the effort. Document this 
process well since you will want to come back to it if the first approach 
does not work.
4. Attempt a problem solution. Now is the time to actually begin solv-
ing the problem. The process you follow must be well documented in 
order to present a detailed solution if successful, and to evaluate the 
process if you are not successful. This detailed evaluation may lead to 
corrections that can then lead to a successful solution. It can also lead to 
new alternatives to try. Many times, it is wise to fully set up a solution 
before putting numbers into equations. This will help in checking your  
results.
5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy. You now thoroughly 
evaluate what you have accomplished. Decide if you have an acceptable 
solution, one that you want to present to your team, boss, or professor.
6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solu-
tion; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the process again. 
Now you need to present your solution or try another alternative. At this 
point, presenting your solution may bring closure to the process. Often, 
however, presentation of a solution leads to further refinement of the 
problem definition, and the process continues. Following this process 
will eventually lead to a satisfactory conclusion.
Now let us look at this process for a student taking an electrical and 
computer engineering foundations course. (The basic process also ap
-
plies to almost e very engineering course.) K eep in mind that although 
the steps have been simplified to apply to academic types of problems, 
the process as stated always needs to be followed. We consider a simple 
example.

1.8  Problem Solving
21
Example 1.10
Solve for the current flowing through the 8-Ω resistor in Fig. 1.19.
Solution:
1. Carefully define the problem. This is only a simple example, but we 
can already see that we do not know the polarity on the 3-V source. We 
have the following options. We can ask the professor what the polarity 
should be. If we cannot ask, then we need to make a decision on what 
to do next. If we have time to work the problem both ways, we can 
solve for the current when the 3-V source is plus on top and then plus  
on the bottom. If we do not have the time to work it both ways, assume 
a polarity and then carefully document your decision. Let us assume 
that the professor tells us that the source is plus on the bottom as shown 
in Fig. 1.20.
2. Present everything you know about the problem. Presenting all that 
we know about the problem involves labeling the circuit clearly so that 
we define what we seek.
Given the circuit shown in Fig. 1.20, solve for i8Ω.
We now check with the professor, if reasonable, to see if the prob -
lem is properly defined.
3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that 
promises the greatest likelihood of success . There are essentially three 
techniques that can be used to solve this problem. Later in the text you 
will see that you can use circuit analysis (using Kirchhoff’s laws and 
Ohm’s law), nodal analysis, and mesh analysis.
To solve for i8Ω using circuit analysis will eventually lead to a solu-
tion, but it will likely take more work than either nodal or mesh analysis. 
To solve for i8Ω using mesh analysis will require writing two simultane-
ous equations to find the two loop currents indicated in Fig. 1.21. Using 
nodal analysis requires solving for only one unknown. This is the easiest 
approach.

Therefore, we will solve for i8Ω using nodal analysis.
4. Attempt a problem solution. We first write down all of the equations 
we will need in order to find i8Ω.

Now we can solve for v1.

2   +  v1 − 0

8   +  v1 + 3 
______ 
4   ] = 0
leads to  (4 v  1 − 20) +  ( v  1 ) +  (2 v  1 + 6) = 0
7v1 = +14,   
v  1 = +2 V,   
i  8Ω =    v  1  
__ 
8   =   2 
__ 8  = 0.25 A
5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy
. We can now use 
Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) to check the results.
  i  1 =    v  1 − 5 
____ 
2   =   2 − 5 
___ 
2   = −  3 
__ 2  = −1.5 A
i2 = i8Ω = 0.25 A
  i  3 =    v  1 + 3 
____ 
4   =   2 + 3 
___ 
4  =   5 
__ 4   = 1.25 A
i1 + i2 + i3 = −1.5 + 0.25 + 1.25 = 0  
(Checks.)
Applying KVL to loop 1,
 −5 +  v  2Ω +  v  8Ω = −5 +  (− i  1 × 2) +  ( i  2 × 8) 
= −5 +  [− (−1.5) 2] +  (0.25 × 8) 
= −5 + 3 + 2 = 0   
(Checks.) 
Applying KVL to loop 2,
− v  8Ω +  v  4Ω − 3 = − ( i  2 × 8) +  ( i  3 × 4) − 3
= − (0.25 × 8) +  (1.25 × 4) − 3
= −2 + 5 − 3 = 0   
(Checks.) 
So we now have a very high degree of confidence in the accuracy 
of our answer.
6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solu-
tion; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the process again. 
This problem has been solved satisfactorily.
The current through the 8-Ω resistor is 0.25 A flowing down through the 
8-Ω resistor.
Try applying this process to some of the more difficult problems at the 
end of the chapter.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.b), “an ability to design and con-
duct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data.”
Engineers must be able to design and conduct e xperiments, as well as 
analyze and interpret data. Most students ha ve spent man y hours per -
forming experiments in high school and in college. During this time, you 
have been asked to analyze the data and to interpret the data. Therefore, 
you should already be skilled in these tw o activities. My recommenda-
tion is that, in the process of performing e xperiments in the future, you 
spend more time in analyzing and interpreting the data in the conte xt of 
the experiment. What does this mean?
If you are looking at a plot of voltage versus resistance or current 
versus resistance or power versus resistance, what do you actually see? 
Does the curve make sense? Does it agree with what the theory tells you? 
Does it differ from expectation, and, if so, wh y? Clearly, practice with 
analyzing and interpreting data will enhance this skill.
Since most, if not all, the e xperiments you are required to do as a 
student involve little or no practice in designing the experiment, how can 
you develop and enhance this skill?
Actually, developing this skill under this constraint is not as difficult 
as it seems. What you need to do is to take the experiment and analyze it. 
Just break it down into its simplest parts, reconstruct it trying to under -
stand why each element is there, and finally, determine what the author 
of the experiment is trying to teach you. Even though it may not always 
seem so, every experiment you do w as designed by someone who w as 
sincerely motivated to teach you something.

Chapter 2  Basic Laws
2.1
 Introduction
Chapter 1 introduced basic concepts such as current, voltage, and power 
in an electric circuit. To actually determine the v alues of these v ari-
ables in a gi ven circuit requires that we understand some fundamen
-
tal laws that govern electric circuits. These laws, known as Ohm’s law 
and Kirchhoff’s laws, form the foundation upon which electric circuit  
analysis is built.
In this chapter , in addition to these la
ws, we shall discuss some 
techniques commonly applied in circuit design and analysis. These tech-
niques include combining resistors in series or parallel, voltage division, 
current division, and delta-to-wye and wye-to-delta transformations. The 
application of these laws and techniques will be restricted to resistive 
circuits in this chapter. We will finally apply the laws and techniques to 
real-life problems of electrical lighting and the design of dc meters.

 Ohm’s Law
Materials in general have a characteristic behavior of resisting the flow 
of electric charge. This physical property, or ability to resist current, is 
known as resistance and is represented by the symbol R. The resistance 
of any material with a uniform cross-sectional area A depends on A and 
its length ℓ, as sho wn in Fig. 2.1(a). We can represent resistance (as 
measured in the laboratory), in mathematical form,
R = ρ  ​ ℓ

(2.1)
where ρ is known as the resistivity of the material in ohm-meters. Good 
conductors, such as copper and aluminum, ha ve low resistivities, while 
insulators, such as mica and paper, have high resistivities. Table 2.1 pres-
ents the values of ρ for some common materials and shows which mate-
rials are used for conductors, insulators, and semiconductors.
The circuit element used to model the current-resisting beha vior of a  
material is the resistor. For the purpose of constructing circuits, resistors are

usually made from metallic alloys and carbon compounds. The  circuit sym-
bol for the resistor is shown in Fig. 2.1(b), where R stands for the resistance 
of the resistor. The resistor is the simplest passive element.
Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854), a German ph
ysicist, is credited 
with finding the relationship between current and voltage for a resistor. 
This relationship is known as Ohm’s law.
Ohm’s law states that the voltage v across a resistor is directly propor-
tional to the current i flowing through the resistor.
That is,
v ∝ i 
(2.2)
Ohm defined the constant of proportionality for a resistor to be the resis-
tance, R. (The resistance is a material property which can change if the 
internal or external conditions of the element are altered, e.g., if there are 
changes in the temperature.) Thus, Eq. (2.2) becomes
v = iR

Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854), a German physicist, in 1826 
experimentally determined the most basic law relating voltage and cur -
rent for a resistor. Ohm’s work was initially denied by critics.
Born of humble beginnings in Erlangen, Bavaria, Ohm threw himself 
into electrical research. His efforts resulted in his famous law. He was 
awarded the Copley Medal in 1841 by the Royal Society of London. In 
1849, he was given the Professor of Physics chair by the University of 
Munich. To honor him, the unit of resistance was named the ohm.

Chapter 2  Basic Laws
which is the mathematical form of Ohm’s law. R in Eq. (2.3) is mea sured 
in the unit of ohms, designated Ω. Thus,
The resistance R of an element denotes its ability to resist the flow of 
electric current; it is measured in ohms (Ω).
We may deduce from Eq. (2.3) that
 R =  v 
__ i  
(2.4)
so that
1 Ω = 1 V/A
To apply Ohm’ s law as stated in Eq. (2.3), we must pay careful 
attention to the current direction and v oltage polarity. The direction of 
current i and the polarity of voltage v must conform with the passive sign 
convention, as shown in Fig. 2.1(b). This implies that current flows from 
a higher potential to a lower potential in order for v = i R. If current flows 
from a lower potential to a higher potential, v = −i R.
Since the value of R can range from zero to infinity, it is important  
that we consider the two extreme possible values of R. An element with 
R = 0 is called a short circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.2(a). For a short circuit,
 v = i R = 0 
(2.5)
showing that the v oltage is zero b ut the current could be an ything. In 
practice, a short circuit is usually a connecting wire assumed to be a 
perfect conductor. Thus,
A short circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching zero.
Similarly, an element with R =​∞ is known as an open circuit, as shown 
in Fig. 2.2(b). For an open circuit,
i =     lim 
   
R→∞​​v 
__ 
R   =​0 
(2.6)
indicating that the current is zero though the v oltage could be anything. 
Thus,
An open circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching infinity.
A resistor is either fixed or variable. Most resistors are of the fixed 
type, meaning their resistance remains constant. The two common types 
of fixed resistors (wirewound and composition) are shown in Fig. 2.3. The 
composition resistors are used when large resistance is needed. The circuit 
symbol in Fig. 2.1(b) is for a fixed resistor. Variable resistors have adjust-
able resistance. The symbol for a variable resistor is shown in Fig. 2.4(a). 
A common variable resistor is known as a potentiometer or pot for short, 
with the symbol shown in Fig. 2.4(b). The pot is a three-terminal element 
with a sliding contact or wiper . By sliding the wiper , the resistances be -
tween the wiper terminal and the fixed terminals v ary. Like fixed resis-
tors, variable resistors can be of either wire wound or composition type, 
as shown in Fig. 2.5. Although resistors like those in Figs. 2.3 and 2.5 are 
used in circuit designs, today most circuit components including resistors 
are either surface mounted or integrated, as typically shown in Fig. 2.6.

2.2  Ohm’s Law
33
It should be pointed out that not all resistors obe
y Ohm’s law. A 
resistor that obeys Ohm’s law is known as a linear resistor. It has a con-
stant resistance and thus its current-voltage characteristic is as illustrated 
in Fig. 2.7(a): Its i-v graph is a straight line passing through the ori
-
gin. A nonlinear resistor does not obey Ohm’s law. Its resistance varies 
with current and its i-v characteristic is typically sho wn in Fig. 2.7(b). 
Examples of devices with nonlinear resistance are the light bulb and the 
diode. Although all practical resistors may e xhibit nonlinear beha vior 
under certain conditions, we will assume in this book that all elements 
actually designated as resistors are linear.
A useful quantity in circuit analysis is the reciprocal of resistance R, 
known as conductance and denoted by G:
 G =  1 
__ 
R   =  i 
__ v 
 
(2.7)
The conductance is a measure of how well an element will conduct 
electric current. The unit of conductance is the mho (ohm spelled back-
ward) or reciprocal ohm, with symbol ℧, the inverted omega. Although 
engineers often use the mho, in this book we prefer to use the siemens 
(S), the SI unit of conductance:
 
 1 S = 1 ℧  = 1 A / V 
(2.8)
Thus,
Conductance is the ability of an element to conduct electric current; it is 
measured in mhos (℧) or siemens (S).
The same resistance can be e
xpressed in ohms or siemens. F
or 
example, 10 Ω is the same as 0.1 S. From Eq. (2.7), we may write
i = Gv 
(2.9)
The power dissipated by a resistor can be e xpressed in terms of R.

G as

(2.11)
We should note two things from Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11):
1. The power dissipated in a resistor is a nonlinear function of either 
current or voltage.
2. Since R and G are positive quantities, the power dissipated in a resis-
tor is always positive. Thus, a resistor al ways absorbs power from 
the circuit. This confirms the idea that a resistor is a passive element, 
incapable of generating energy.

Practice Problem 2.2
2.3
 Nodes, Branches, and Loops
Since the elements of an electric circuit can be interconnected in se veral 
ways, we need to understand some basic concepts of network topology. To 
differentiate between a circuit and a network, we may regard a network as 
an interconnection of elements or devices, whereas a circuit is a network 
providing one or more closed paths. The convention, when addressing 
network topology, is to use the w ord network rather than circuit. We do 
this even though the word network and circuit mean the same thing when 
used in this context. In network topology, we study the properties relating 
to the placement of elements in the network and the geometric configura-
tion of the network. Such elements include branches, nodes, and loops.
A branch represents a single element such as a voltage source or a  resistor.
In other words, a branch represents an y two-terminal element. The cir-
cuit in Fig. 2.10 has five branches, namely, the 10-V voltage source, the 
2-A current source, and the three resistors.
A node is the point of connection between two or more branches.
A node is usually indicated by a dot in a circuit. If a short circuit 
 
(a connecting wire) connects two nodes, the two nodes constitute a sin-
gle node. The circuit in Fig. 2.10 has three nodes a, b, and c. Notice that

Chapter 2  Basic Laws
the three points that form node b are connected by perfectly conducting 
wires and therefore constitute a single point. The same is true of the four 
points forming node c. We demonstrate that the circuit in Fig. 2.10 has 
only three nodes by redrawing the circuit in Fig. 2.11. The two circuits in 
Figs. 2.10 and 2.11 are identical. However, for the sake of clarity, nodes 
b and c are spread out with perfect conductors as in Fig. 2.10.
A loop is any closed path in a circuit.
A loop is a closed path formed by starting at a node, passing through a 
set of nodes, and returning to the starting node without passing through 
any node more than once. A loop is said to be  independent if it contains 
at least one branch which is not a part of an
y other independent loop. 
Independent loops or paths result in independent sets of equations.
It is possible to form an independent set of loops where one of the
 
loops does not contain such a branch. In Fig. 2.11, abca with the 2 Ω re-
sistor is independent. A second loop with the 3 Ω resistor and the current  
source is independent. The third loop could be the one with the 2Ω resistor 
in parallel with the 3Ω resistor. This does form an independent set of loops.
A network with b branches, n nodes, and l independent loops will 
satisfy the fundamental theorem of network topology:
 
b = l + n − 1
 
(2.12)
As the next two definitions show, circuit topology is of great value to 
the study of voltages and currents in an electric circuit.
Two or more elements are in series if they exclusively share a single node 
and consequently carry the same current.
Two or more elements are in parallel if they are connected to the same 
two nodes and consequently have the same voltage across them.
Elements are in series when the y are chain-connected or connected se -
quentially, end to end. F or example, two elements are in series if they 
share one common node and no other element is connected to that 
 common node. Elements in parallel are connected to the same pair of 
terminals. Elements may be connected in a w ay that they are neither in 
series nor in parallel. In the circuit shown in Fig. 2.10, the voltage source 
and the 5- Ω resistor are in series because the same current will flow 
through them. The 2-Ω resistor, the 3-Ω resistor, and the current source 
are in parallel because they are connected to the same two nodes b and c 
and consequently have the same voltage across them. The 5-Ω and 2-Ω 
resistors are neither in series nor in parallel with each other.

Solution:
Since there are four elements in the circuit, the circuit has four branches:  
10 V, 5 Ω, 6 Ω, and 2 A. The circuit has three nodes as identified in Fig. 2.13. 
The 5-Ω resistor is in series with the 10-V voltage source because the same 
current would flow in both. The 6-Ω resistor is in parallel with the 2-A cur-
rent source because both are connected to the same nodes 2 and 3.

2.4
 Kirchhoff’s Laws
Ohm’s law by itself is not sufficient to analyze circuits. However, when it 
is coupled with Kirchhoff’s two laws, we have a sufficient, powerful set 
of tools for analyzing a large variety of electric circuits. Kirchhoff’s laws 
were first introduced in 1847 by the German physicist Gustav Robert 
Kirchhoff (1824–1887). These laws are formally known as Kirchhoff’s 
current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL).
Kirchhoff’s first law is based on the la w of conservation of charge, 
which requires that the algebraic sum of charges within a system cannot 
change.
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of currents 
entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero.
Mathematically, KCL implies that
 
 ∑ 
n=1  
N
    i n = 0  
(2.13)
where N is the number of branches connected to the node and in is the nth 
current entering (or lea ving) the node. By this la w, currents entering a 
node may be regarded as positive, while currents leaving the node may 
be taken as negative or vice versa.

Chapter 2  Basic Laws
To prove KCL, assume a set of currents    i k  (t) , k = 1, 2,…, flow into 
a node. The algebraic sum of currents at the node is
 i T  (t) =  i 1 (t) +  i 2 (t) +  i 3 (t) + ⋯  
(2.14)
Integrating both sides of Eq. (2.14) gives
 q T  (t) =  q 1 (t) +  q 2 (t) +  q 3 (t) + ⋯  
(2.15)
where    q k  (t) =  ∫   
    i k  (t) d t and   q T  (t) =  ∫   
    i T  (t) d t . But the law of conserva-
tion of electric charge requires that the algebraic sum of electric charges 
at the node must not change; that is, the node stores no net charge. Thus,  
q T  (t) = 0 →  i T  (t) = 0, confirming the validity of KCL.
Consider the node in Fig. 2.16. Applying KCL gives
 i 1 +  (− i 2 ) +  i 3 +  i 4 +  (− i 5 ) = 0 
(2.16)
since currents i1, i3, and i4 are entering the node, while currents i2 and i5 
are leaving it. By rearranging the terms, we get
 i 1 +  i 3 +  i 4 =  i 2 +  i 5 
(2.17)
Equation (2.17) is an alternative form of KCL:
The sum of the currents entering a node is equal to the sum of the cur-
rents leaving the node.
Note that KCL also applies to a closed boundary . This may be re -
garded as a generalized case, because a node may be regarded as a closed 
surface shrunk to a point. In tw o dimensions, a closed boundary is the 
same as a closed path. As typically illustrated in the circuit of Fig. 2.17, 
the total current entering the closed surface is equal to the total current 
leaving the surface.
A simple application of KCL is combining current sources in paral-
lel. The combined current is the algebraic sum of the current supplied 
by the indi vidual sources. F or example, the current sources sho wn in 
Historical
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824–1887), a German physicist, stated 
two basic laws in 1847 concerning the relationship between the cur
-
rents and voltages in an electrical network. Kirchhoff’s laws, along with 
Ohm’s law, form the basis of circuit theory.
Born the son of a lawyer in Konigsberg, East Prussia, Kirchhoff 
entered the University of Konigsberg at age 18 and later became a lectur-
er in Berlin. His collaborative work in spectroscopy with German chem-
ist Robert Bunsen led to the discovery of cesium in 1860 and rubidium 
in 1861. Kirchhoff was also credited with the Kirchhoff law of radiation. 
Thus, Kirchhoff is famous among engineers, chemists, and physicists.

Two sources (or circuits in general) are

 terminals.

2.4  Kirchhoff’s Laws
39
Fig. 2.18(a) can be combined as in Fig. 2.18(b). The combined or equiva-
lent current source can be found by applying KCL to node a.
 IT  +​I2 =​I1 +​I3 
or
 I T =  I 1 −  I 2 +  I 3 
(2.18)
A circuit cannot contain two different currents, I1 and I2, in series, unless 
I1 = I2; otherwise KCL will be violated.
Kirchhoff’s second law is based on the principle of conservation of 
energy:
Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all voltages 
around a closed path (or loop) is zero.
Expressed mathematically, KVL states that
 ∑ 
m=1  
M
    v m = 0   
(2.19)
where M is the number of voltages in the loop (or the number of branches 
in the loop) and vm is the mth voltage.
To illustrate KVL, consider the circuit in Fig. 2.19. 
The sign on 
each voltage is the polarity of the terminal encountered first as we travel 
around the loop. We can start with an y branch and go around the loop 
either clockwise or counterclockwise. Suppose we start with the v
olt-
age source and go clockwise around the loop as sho
wn; then v oltages 
would be −v1, +v2, +v3, +v4, and −v5, in that order. For example, as we 
reach branch 3, the positive terminal is met first; hence, we have +v3. For 
branch 4, we reach the ne gative terminal first; hence, −v4. Thus, KVL 
yields
 − v 1 +  v 2 +  v 3 −  v 4 +  v 5 = 0  
(2.20)
Rearranging terms gives
 v 2 +  v 3 +  v 5 =  v 1 +  v 4 
(2.21)
which may be interpreted as
Sum of voltage drops = Sum of voltage rises 
(2.22)
This is an alternative form of KVL. Notice that if we had traveled coun-
terclockwise, the result w ould have been +v1, −v5, +v4, −v3, and −v2, 
which is the same as before e xcept that the signs are re versed. Hence, 
Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21) remain the same.
When voltage sources are connected in series, KVL can be applied 
to obtain the total v oltage. The combined v oltage is the algebraic sum 
of the v oltages of the indi vidual sources. F or example, for the v oltage 
sources shown in Fig. 2.20(a), the combined or equivalent voltage source 
in Fig. 2.20(b) is obtained by applying KVL.
 − V ab +  V 1 +  V 2 −  V 3 = 0 
KVL can be applied in two ways: by 
taking either a clockwise or a counter-
clockwise trip around the loop. Either 
way, the algebraic sum of voltages 
around the loop is zero.

Assume that current i flows through the loop as shown in Fig. 2.21(b). 
From Ohm’s law,
 
 v 1 = 2i,  
 v 2 = −3i 
(2.5.1)
Applying KVL around the loop gives
 
 −20 +  v 1 −  v 2 = 0 
(2.5.2)
Substituting Eq. (2.5.1) into Eq. (2.5.2), we obtain
 −20 + 2i + 3i = 0  
or  
5i = 20  
⇒  
i = 4 A 
Substituting i in Eq. (2.5.1) finally gives
 v 1 = 8 V,  
 v 2 = −12 V

Determine vo and i in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.23(a).
Solution:
We apply KVL around the loop as shown in Fig. 2.23(b). The result is
 −12 + 4i + 2 v o − 4 + 6i = 0 
(2.6.1)
Applying Ohm’s law to the 6-Ω resistor gives
 v o = −6i 
(2.6.2)
Substituting Eq. (2.6.2) into Eq. (2.6.1) yields
 −16 + 10i − 12i = 0  
⇒

 v 1 = 8 i 1 ,   v 2 = 3 i 2 ,   v 3 = 6 i 3  
(2.8.1)
Since the voltage and current of each resistor are related by Ohm’s 
law as shown, we are really looking for three things: (v1, v2, v3) or (i1, i2, i3). 
At node a, KCL gives
 
 i 1 −  i 2 −  i 3 = 0

as expected since the two resistors are in parallel. We express v1 and v2 in 
terms of i1 and i2 as in Eq. (2.8.1). Equation (2.8.4) becomes

 Series Resistors and Voltage Division
The need to combine resistors in series or in parallel occurs so frequently 
that it warrants special attention. The process of combining the resistors 
is facilitated by combining two of them at a time. With this in mind, con-
sider the single-loop circuit of Fig. 2.29. The two resistors are in series, 
since the same current i flows in both of them. Applying Ohm’s law to 
each of the resistors, we obtain
v 1 = i R 1 ,  
 v 2 = i R 2 
(2.24)
If we apply KVL to the loop (mo ving in the clockwise direction), we 
have
 −v +  v 1 +  v 2 = 0 
(2.25)
Combining Eqs. (2.24) and (2.25), we get
 v =  v 1 +  v 2 = i ( R 1 +  R 2 ) 
 
(2.26)
or

Chapter 2  Basic Laws
Notice that Eq. (2.26) can be written as
 v = i R eq  
(2.28)
implying that the two resistors can be replaced by an equivalent resistor 
Req; that is,
 R eq =  R 1 +  R 2 
(2.29)
Thus, Fig. 2.29 can be replaced by the equivalent circuit in Fig. 2.30. The 
two circuits in Figs. 2.29 and 2.30 are equivalent because they exhibit the 
same voltage-current relationships at the terminals a-b. An equivalent 
circuit such as the one in Fig. 2.30 is useful in simplifying the analysis 
of a circuit. In general,
The equivalent resistance of any number of resistors connected in series 
is the sum of the individual resistances.
For N resistors in series then,
 R eq =  R 1 +  R 2 + ⋯ +  R N =  ∑ 
n=1  
N
    R n 
 
(2.30)
To determine the voltage across each resistor in Fig. 2.29, we substi-
tute Eq. (2.26) into Eq. (2.24) and obtain
 
 v 1 =  
 R 1  
_____ 
 R 1 +  R 2    v,  
 v 2 =  
 R 2  
_____

(2.31)
Notice that the source voltage v is divided among the resistors in direct 
proportion to their resistances; the larger the resistance, the larger the 
voltage drop. This is called the principle of voltage division, and the cir-
cuit in Fig. 2.29 is called a voltage divider. In general, if a voltage divider 
has N resistors (R1, R2, … , RN) in series with the source voltage v, the nth 
resistor (Rn) will have a voltage drop of
 v n =  
 R n

 Parallel Resistors and Current Division
Consider the circuit in Fig. 2.31, where tw

(2.37)
Thus,
The equivalent resistance of two parallel resistors is equal to the prod-
uct of their resistances divided by their sum.
It must be emphasized that this applies only to tw o resistors in parallel. 
From Eq. (2.37), if R1 = R2 then Req = R1/R2.
We can extend the result in Eq. (2.36) to the general case of a circuit 
with N resistors in parallel. The equivalent resistance is
 1

__ 
 R 1   +  1 
__ 
 R 2   + ⋯ +  1

Note that Req is always smaller than the resistance of the smallest resistor 
in the parallel combination. If R1 = R2 = ⋯​=​RN = R,  then
 R eq =  R 
__ 
N  
 
(2.39)
For e xample, if four 100- Ω resistors are connected in parallel, their 
equivalent resistance is 25 Ω.
It is often more convenient to use conductance rather than resistance 
when dealing with resistors in parallel. From Eq. (2.38), the equi valent 
conductance for N resistors in parallel is
 
 G eq =  G 1 +  G 2 +  G 3 + ⋯ +  G N 
 
(2.40)
where Geq = 1/Req, G1 = 1/R1, G2 = 1/R2, G3 = 1/ R3, … , GN = 1/ RN. 
Equation (2.40) states:
The equivalent conductance of resistors connected in parallel is the 
sum of their individual conductances.
This means that we may replace the circuit in Fig. 2.31 with that in 
Fig. 2.32. Notice the similarity between Eqs. (2.30) and (2.40). 
The 
equivalent conductance of parallel resistors is obtained the same w
ay 
as the equivalent resistance of series resistors. In the same manner , the 
equivalent conductance of resistors in series is obtained just the same 
Conductances in parallel behave as a 
single conductance whose value is 
equal to the sum of the individual 
 conductances.

_____

(2.42)
Combining Eqs. (2.33) and (2.42) results in
 i 1 =   R 2 i 
_____ 
 R 1 +  R 2   ,  
 i 2 =   R 1 i 
_____ 
 R 1 +  R 2  
 
(2.43)
which shows that the total current i is shared by the resistors in in -
verse proportion to their resistances. This is known as the principle 
of current division, and the circuit in Fig. 2.31 is known as a current 
divider. Notice that the lar ger current flows through the smaller re -
sistance.
As an extreme case, suppose one of the resistors in Fig. 2.31 is zero, 
say R2 = 0; that is, R2 is a short circuit, as sho wn in Fig. 2.33(a). From 
Eq. (2.43), R2 = 0 implies that i1 = 0, i2 = i. This means that the entire 
current i bypasses R1 and flows through the short  circuit R2 = 0, the path 
of least resistance. Thus when a circuit is short  circuited, as sho wn in 
Fig. 2.33(a), two things should be kept in mind:
1. The equivalent resistance Req = 0. [See what happens when R2 = 0 
in Eq. (2.37).]
2. The entire current flows through the short circuit.
As another e xtreme case, suppose R2 = ∞, that is, R2 is an open 
circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.33(b). The current still flows through the path 
of least resistance, R1. By taking the limit of Eq. (2.37) as   R 2 → ∞, we 
obtain Req = R1 in this case.
If we divide both the numerator and denominator by R1R2, Eq. (2.43) 
becomes
 i 1 =  
 G 1  
_____ 
 G 1 +  G 2   i 
(2.44a)
 i 2 =  
 G 2  
_____

Thus, in general, if a current divider has N conductors (G1, G2, … , GN) in 
parallel with the source current i, the nth conductor (Gn) will have current

Example 2.9
Find Req for the circuit shown in Fig. 2.34.
Solution:
To get Req, we combine resistors in series and in parallel. The 6- Ω and 
3-Ω resistors are in parallel, so their equivalent resistance is
 
 6 Ω   ∥   3Ω =  6 × 3 
____ 
6 + 3  = 2 Ω 
(The symbol  ∥ is used to indicate a parallel combination.) Also, the 1-Ω
and 5-Ω resistors are in series; hence their equivalent resistance is
 1 Ω + 5 Ω = 6 Ω 
Thus the circuit in Fig. 2.34 is reduced to that in Fig. 2.35(a). In 
Fig. 2.35(a), we notice that the tw o 2-Ω resistors are in series, so the 
equivalent resistance is
 2 Ω + 2 Ω = 4 Ω 
This 4-Ω resistor is now in parallel with the 6-Ω resistor in Fig. 2.35(a); 
their equivalent resistance is
 4 Ω  ∥  6 Ω =  4 × 6 
____ 
4 + 6  = 2.4 Ω 
The circuit in Fig. 2.35(a) is now replaced with that in Fig. 2.35(b). In 
Fig. 2.35(b), the three resistors are in series. Hence, the equivalent resis-
tance for the circuit is
 
 R eq = 4 Ω + 2.4 Ω + 8 Ω = 14.4 Ω

In general, it is often convenient and possible to combine resistors in

Solution:
The 3-Ω and 6-Ω resistors are in parallel because they are connected to 
the same two nodes c and b. Their combined resistance is
 3 Ω  ∥  6 Ω =  3 × 6 
____ 
3 + 6  = 2 Ω 
(2.10.1)
Similarly, the 12-Ω and 4-Ω resistors are in parallel since the y are con-
nected to the same two nodes d and b. Hence
 
 12 Ω  ∥   4 Ω =  12 × 4 
____ 
12 + 4  = 3 Ω 
(2.10.2)
Also the 1-Ω and 5-Ω resistors are in series; hence, their equivalent re -
sistance is
 
 1 Ω + 5 Ω = 6 Ω 
(2.10.3)
With these three combinations, we can replace the circuit in Fig. 2.37 with 
that in Fig. 2.38(a). In Fig. 2.38(a), 3-Ω in parallel with 6-Ω gives 2-Ω, as 
calculated in Eq. (2.10.1). This 2-Ω equivalent resistance is now in series 
with the 1-Ω resistance to give a combined resistance of 1 Ω +​2​Ω​=​3​Ω.​
Thus, we replace the circuit in Fig. 2.38(a) with that in Fig. 2.38(b). In 
Fig. 2.38(b), we combine the 2-Ω and 3-Ω resistors in parallel to get

Find the equivalent conductance Geq for the circuit in Fig. 2.40(a).
Solution:
The 8-S and 12-S resistors are in parallel, so their conductance is

that the combined conductance is

This is in parallel with the 6-S resistor. Hence,
	
​G​ eq​ = 6 + 4 = 10 S​	
We should note that the circuit in Fig. 2.40(a) is the same as that in

Find io and vo in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.42(a). Calculate the power

The 6-Ω and 3-Ω resistors are in parallel, so their combined resistance is

Thus, our circuit reduces to that shown in Fig. 2.42(b). Notice that vo is

Chapter 2  Basic Laws

can obtain vo in two ways. One way is to apply Ohm’s law to get
 
 i =  12 
_____ 
4 + 2  = 2 A 
and hence, vo = 2i = 2 × 2 = 4 V. Another way is to apply voltage divi-
sion, since the 12 V in Fig. 2.42(b) is divided between the 4-Ω and 2-Ω 
resistors. Hence,
 
 v o =  2 
_____ 
2 + 4   (12 V) = 4 V 
Similarly, io can be obtained in two ways. One approach is to apply 
Ohm’s law to the 3-Ω resistor in Fig. 2.42(a) now that we know vo; thus,
 
 v o = 3 i o = 4  
⇒  
 i o =  4

 Wye-Delta Transformations
Situations often arise in circuit analysis when the resistors are neither 
in parallel nor in series. For example, consider the bridge circuit in 
Fig. 2.46. How do we combine resistors R1 through R6 when the resistors 
are neither in series nor in parallel? Man y circuits of the type sho wn in 
Fig. 2.46 can be simplified by using three-terminal equivalent networks. 
These are the wye (Y) or tee (T) netw
ork shown in Fig. 2.47 and the 
delta (Δ) or pi (Π) network shown in Fig. 2.48. These networks occur by 
themselves or as part of a lar ger network. They are used in three-phase 
networks, electrical filters, and matching networks. Our main interest

Chapter 2  Basic Laws
here is in how to identify them when they occur as part of a network and 
how to apply wye-delta transformation in the analysis of that network.
Delta to Wye Conversion
Suppose it is more convenient to work with a wye network in a place 
where the circuit contains a delta configuration. We superimpose a wye 
network on the existing delta network and find the equivalent resistances 
in the wye network. To obtain the equivalent resistances in the wye net-
work, we compare the tw o networks and make sure that the resistance 
between each pair of nodes in the Δ (or Π) network is the same as the 
resistance between the same pair of nodes in the Y (or T) network. For 
terminals 1 and 2 in Figs. 2.47 and 2.48, for example,
 R 12  (Y) =  R 1 +  R 3 
(2.46)
R12(Δ)​=​Rb​∥​(Ra​+​Rc)
Setting R12(Y) = R12(Δ) gives
 R 12 =  R 1 +  R 3 =   R b  ( R a +  R c )  
_________ 
 R a +  R b +  R c    
(2.47a)
Similarly,
 R 13 =  R 1 +  R 2 =   R c  ( R a +  R b )  
_________ 
 R a +  R b +  R c    
(2.47b)
 R 34 =  R 2 +  R 3 =   R a  ( R b +  R c )  
_________ 
 R a +  R b +  R c    
(2.47c)
Subtracting Eq. (2.47c) from Eq. (2.47a), we get
 R 1 −  R 2 =   R c  ( R b −  R a )  
_________ 
 R a +  R b +  R c    
(2.48)
Adding Eqs. (2.47b) and (2.48) gives
 R 1 =  
 R b  R c  
________ 
 R a +  R b +  R c  
 
(2.49)
and subtracting Eq. (2.48) from Eq. (2.47b) yields
 R 2 =  
 R c  R a  
________ 
 R a +  R b +  R c  
 
(2.50)
Subtracting Eq. (2.49) from Eq. (2.47a), we obtain

2.7  Wye-Delta Transformations
53
We do not need to memorize Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51). 
To transform a ∆ 
network to Y, we create an extra node n as shown in Fig. 2.49 and follow 
this conversion rule:
Each resistor in the Y network is the product of the resistors in the two 
adjacent Δ branches, divided by the sum of the three Δ resistors.
One can follow this rule and obtain Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51) from Fig. 2.49.
Wye to Delta Conversion
To obtain the conversion formulas for transforming a wye network to an 
equivalent delta network, we note from Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51) that
 R 1  R 2 +  R 2  R 3 +  R 3  R 1 =   R a  R b  R c  ( R a +  R b +  R c )   
_________________  
 ( R a +  R b +  R c ) 2  
 
(2.52)
 =​ 
 R a  R b  R c  
_______ 
 R a +  R b +  R c   
Dividing Eq. (2.52) by each of Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51) leads to the follo w-
ing equations:
 
 R a =  R1 R2 + R2R3 + R3R1  
_________________ 
R1 
 
 
(2.53)
 
 R b =  R1 R2 + R2R3 + R3R1  
_________________ 
R2 
  
(2.54)
 
 R c =  R1 R2 + R2R3 + R3R1  
_________________ 
R3 
 
 
(2.55)
From Eqs. (2.53) to (2.55) and Fig. 2.49, the con version rule for Y to Δ 
is as follows:
Each resistor in the Δ network is the sum of all possible products of Y 
resistors taken two at a time, divided by the opposite Y resistor.
 
The Y and Δ networks are said to be balanced when
 R 1 =  R 2 =  R 3 =  R Y ,  
 R a =  R b =  R c =  R ∆ 
(2.56)
Under these conditions, conversion formulas become
 
 R Y =   R Δ  
___ 
3   
or  
 R Δ = 3 R Y 
 
(2.57)
One may w onder wh y RY is less than 
RΔ. Well, we notice that the  
Y-connection is like a “series” connection while the Δ-connection is like 
a “parallel” connection.
Note that in making the transformation, we do not take anything out 
of the circuit or put in anything new. We are merely substituting different 
but mathematically equivalent three-terminal network patterns to create 
a circuit in which resistors are either in series or in parallel, allo wing us 
to calculate Req if necessary.

Answer: Ra = 140 Ω, Rb = 70 Ω, Rc = 35 Ω.
Obtain the equivalent resistance Rab for the circuit in Fig. 2.52 and use 
it to find current i.
Solution:
1. Define. The problem is clearly defined. Please note, this part nor-
mally will deservedly take much more time.
2. Present. Clearly, when we remove the voltage source, we end up with 
a purely resistive circuit. Since it is composed of deltas and wyes, we 
have a more comple x process of combining the elements together .

2.7  Wye-Delta Transformations
55
We can use wye-delta transformations as one approach to find a so-
lution. It is useful to locate the wyes (there are tw o of them, one at 
n and the other at c) and the deltas (there are three: can, abn, cnb).
3. Alternative. There are different approaches that can be used to solve 
this problem. Since the focus of Sec. 2.7 is the wye-delta transfor -
mation, this should be the technique to use. Another approach would 
be to solve for the equi valent resistance by injecting one amp into 
the circuit and finding the voltage between a and b; we will learn 
about this approach in Chap. 4.
The approach we can apply here as a check w ould be to use 
a wye-delta transformation as the first solution to the problem. 
Later we can check the solution by starting with a delta-wye
 
transformation.
4. Attempt. In this circuit, there are two Y networks and three Δ networks. 
Transforming just one of these will simplify the circuit. If we convert the 
Y network comprising the 5-Ω, 10-Ω, and 20-Ω resistors, we may select
 
 R 1  = 10 Ω,   R 2  = 20 Ω,  
 R 3  = 5 Ω 
Thus from Eqs. (2.53) to (2.55) we have
 R a =   R 1  R 2 +  R 2  R 3 +  R 3  R 1

With the Y converted to Δ, the equivalent circuit (with the volt-
age source removed for now) is shown in Fig. 2.53(a). Combining 
the three pairs of resistors in parallel, we obtain

so that the equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 2.53(b). Hence, we find
 R ab =  (7.292 +​10.5)  ∥ 21 =  17.792 × 21 
________ 
17.792 + 21  = 9.632 Ω 
Then

___ 
 R ab   =  120 
____ 
9.632  = 12.458 A 
We observe that we have successfully solved the problem. Now 
we must evaluate the solution.
5. Evaluate. Now we must determine if the answer is correct and then 
evaluate the final solution.
It is relatively easy to check the answer; we do this by solving 
the problem starting with a delta-wye transformation. Let us trans -
form the delta, can, into a wye.
Let Rc = 10 Ω, Ra = 5 Ω, and Rn = 12.5 Ω. This will lead to (let 
d represent the middle of the wye):
 R ad =  
 R c  R n  
_______ 
 R a +  R c +  R n   =  10 × 12.5 
________  
5 + 10 +​12.5  = 4.545 Ω 
 R cd =   R a  R n  
____ 
27.5  =  5 × 12.5 
______ 
27.5  = 2.273 Ω 
 R nd =   R a  R c  
____ 
27.5  =  5 × 10 
____ 
27.5  = 1.8182 Ω 
This now leads to the circuit sho wn in Figure 2.53(c). Looking at 
the resistance between d and b, we have two series combination in 
parallel, giving us
 
 R db =   (2.273 + 15) (1.8182 + 20)    
________________   
2.273 + 15 + 1.8182 + 20  =  376.9 
____ 
39.09  = 9.642 Ω 
This is in series with the 4.545-Ω resistor, both of which are in par-
allel with the 30-Ω resistor. This then gives us the equivalent resis-
tance of the circuit.
 
 R ab =   (9.642 + 4.545) 30  
____________  
9.642 + 4.545 + 30  =  425.6 
____ 
44.19  = 9.631 Ω 
This now leads to
 
 i =   v s  
___ 
 R ab   =  120 
____ 
9.631  = 12.46 A 
We note that using tw o variations on the wye-delta transformation 
leads to the same results. This represents a very good check.
6. Satisfactory? Since we have found the desired answer by deter -
mining the equi valent resistance of the circuit first and the an-
swer checks, then we clearly have a satisfactory solution. This 
represents what can be presented to the indi vidual assigning the 
problem.

 Applications
Resistors are often used to model de vices that con vert electrical ener -
gy into heat or other forms of energy. Such devices include conducting 
wire, light bulbs, electric heaters, stoves, ovens, and loudspeakers. In this 
section, we will consider two real-life problems that apply the concepts 
developed in this chapter: electrical lighting systems and design of dc 
meters.
2.8.1  Lighting Systems
Lighting systems, such as in a house or on a Christmas tree, often con-
sist of N lamps connected either in parallel or in series, as sho
wn in 
Fig. 2.55. Each lamp is modeled as a resistor
. Assuming that all the  
lamps are identical and Vo is the power-line voltage, the voltage across 
each lamp is Vo for the parallel connection and Vo /N for the series con-
nection. The series connection is easy to manufa cture but is seldom  
used in practice, for at least two reasons. First, it is less reliable; when 
a lamp fa ils, all the lamps go out. Second, it is harder to maintain; 
when a lamp is bad, one must test all the lamps one by one to detect 
the faulty one.
So far, we have assumed that connect-
ing wires are perfect conductors (i.e., 
conductors of zero resistance). In real 
physical systems, however, the 
resistance of the connecting wire may 
be appreciably large, and the 
modeling of the system must include 
that  resistance.
Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) was perhaps the greatest  American 
inventor. He patented 1093 inventions, including such  history-making 
inventions as the incandescent electric bulb, the phonograph, and the 
first commercial motion pictures.
Born in Milan, Ohio, the youngest of seven children, Edison re-
ceived only three months of formal education because he hated school. 
He was home-schooled by his mother and quickly began to read on 
his own. In 1868, Edison read one of Faraday’s books and found his 
calling. He moved to Menlo Park, New Jersey, in 1876, where he man -
aged a well-staffed research laboratory. Most of his inventions came 
out of this  laboratory. His laboratory served as a model for modern re-
search  organ iza tions. Because of his diverse interests and the over -
whelming number of his inventions and patents, Edison began to estab -
lish manufacturing companies for making the devices he invented. He 
designed the first electric power station to supply electric light. Formal 
electrical engineering education began in the mid-1880s with Edison as 
a role model and leader.

2.8.2  Design of DC Meters
By their nature, resistors are used to control the flow of current. We take 
advantage of this property in se veral applications, such as in a poten -
tiometer (Fig. 2.57). The word potentiometer, derived from the w ords 
potential and meter, implies that potential can be metered out. The po-
tentiometer (or pot for short) is a three-terminal de vice that operates on 
the principle of v oltage division. It is essentially an adjustable v oltage 
divider. As a voltage regulator, it is used as a volume or level control on 
radios, TVs, and other devices. In Fig. 2.57,
V out =  V bc =   R bc  
___ 
 R ac    V in

where Rac = Rab + Rbc. Thus, Vout decreases or increases as the sliding 
contact of the pot moves toward c or a, respectively.
Another application where resistors are used to control current flow 
is in the analog dc meters—the ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter, which 
measure current, voltage, and resistance, respectively. Each of these me-
ters employs the d’Arsonval meter movement, shown in Fig. 2.58. The 
movement consists essentially of a movable iron-core coil mounted on 
a pivot between the poles of a permanent magnet. When current flows 
through the coil, it creates a torque which causes the pointer to deflect. 
The amount of current through the coil determines the deflection of the 
pointer, which is registered on a scale attached to the meter movement. 
For example, if the meter movement is rated 1 mA, 50 Ω, it w ould take  
1 mA to cause a full-scale deflection of the meter movement. By intro-
ducing additional circuitry to the  d’Arsonval meter mo vement, an am -
meter, voltmeter, or ohmmeter can be constructed.
Consider Fig. 2.59, where an analog v oltmeter and ammeter are con -
nected to an element. The voltmeter measures the voltage across a load and

 An instrument capable of measuring 
voltage, current, and resistance is 
called a multimeter or a volt-ohm 
 meter (VOM).
 A load is a component that is receiving 
energy (an energy sink), as opposed 
to a generator supplying energy (an 
 energy source). More about loading 
will be discussed in Section 4.9.1.

is therefore connected in parallel with the element. As shown in Fig. 2.60(a), 
the voltmeter consists of a d’Arson val movement in series with a resistor  
whose resistance Rm is deliberately made very large (theoretically, infinite), 
to minimize the current drawn from the circuit. To extend the range of volt-
age that the meter can measure, series multiplier resistors are often connected 
with the voltmeters, as shown in Fig. 2.60(b). The multiple-range voltmeter 
in Fig. 2.60(b) can measure voltage from 0 to 1 V, 0 to 10 V, or 0 to 100 V, 
depending on whether the switch is connected to R1, R2, or R3, respectively.
Let us calculate the multiplier resistor Rn for the single-range voltmeter 
in Fig. 2.60(a), or Rn =​ R1, R2, or R3 for the multiple-range  voltmeter in 
Fig. 2.60(b). We need to determine the value of Rn to be connected in series 
with the internal resistance Rm of the voltmeter. In any design, we consider 
the worst-case condition. In this case, the worst case occurs when the full-
scale current Ifs = Im flows through the meter. This should also correspond

to the maximum v oltage reading or the full-scale v oltage Vfs. Since the  
multiplier resistance Rn is in series with the internal resistance Rm,
 V fs =  I  fs  ( R n +​ R m )  
(2.59)
From this, we obtain
 R n =   V fs  
___ 
 I fs   −  R m  
(2.60)
Similarly, the ammeter measures the current through the load and is  
connected in series with it. As shown in Fig. 2.61(a), the ammeter consists 
of a d’Arsonval movement in parallel with a resistor whose resistance Rm 
is deliberately made very small (theoretically, zero) to minimize the volt-
age drop across it. To allow multiple ranges, shunt resistors are often con-
nected in parallel with Rm as sho wn in Fig. 2.61(b). The shunt resistors  
allow the meter to measure in the range 0–10 mA, 0–100 mA, or 0–1 A, 
depending on whether the switch is connected to R1, R2, or R3, respectively.
Now our objective is to obtain the multiplier shunt Rn for the single-
range ammeter in Fig. 2.61(a), or Rn =​ R1, R2, or R3 for the multiple-range 
ammeter in Fig. 2.61(b). We notice that Rm and Rn are in parallel and that 
at full-scale reading I = Ifs = Im + In, where In is the current through the 
shunt resistor Rn. Applying the current division principle yields
 I m =  
 R n  
_____ 
 R n +  R m    I fs 
or
 R n =   I m  
_____ 
 I fs −  I m    R m 
(2.61)
The resistance Rx of a linear resistor can be measured in tw o ways. 
An indirect way is to measure the current I that flows through it by con-
necting an ammeter in series with it and the v oltage V across it by con-
necting a voltmeter in parallel with it, as shown in Fig. 2.62(a). Then
Rx =   V 
__ I  
(2.62)
The direct method of measuring resistance is to use an ohmmeter . 
An ohmmeter consists basically of a d’Arson val movement, a variable 
resistor or potentiometer, and a battery, as shown in Fig. 2.62(b). Apply-
ing KVL to the circuit in Fig. 2.62(b) gives
 E =  (R +  R m +  R x ) I m 
or
 R x =  E 
__ 
 I m   −  (R +​ R m ) 
 
(2.63)
The resistor R is selected such that the meter gives a full-scale deflection; 
that is, Im = Ifs  when Rx = 0. This implies that
 E =  (R +  R m )   I fs 
(2.64)
Substituting Eq. (2.64) into Eq. (2.63) leads to
Rx =​(  Ifs 
__ 
Im  −1) (R + Rm) 
(2.65)
As mentioned, the types of meters we ha ve discussed are kno wn as 
analog meters and are based on the d’Arsonval meter movement. Another 
type of meter, called a digital meter, is based on acti ve circuit elements

such as op amps. For example, a digital multimeter displays measurements 
of dc or ac voltage, current, and resistance as discrete numbers, instead of 
using a pointer deflection on a continuous scale as in an analog multimeter. 
Digital meters are what you would most likely use in a modern lab. How-
ever, the design of digital meters is beyond the scope of this book.
Historical
Samuel F. B. Morse (1791–1872), an American painter, invented  
the telegraph, the first practical, commercialized application of 
 electricity.
Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and studied at Yale 
and the Royal Academy of Arts in London to become an artist. In the
 
1830s, he became intrigued with developing a telegraph. He had a working 
model by 1836 and applied for a patent in 1838. The U.S. Senate appro -
priated funds for Morse to construct a telegraph line between Baltimore
 
and Washington, D.C. On May 24, 1844, he sent the famous first mes-
sage: “What hath God wrought!” Morse also developed a code of dots and 
dashes for letters and numbers, for sending messages on the telegraph. The 
development of the telegraph led to the invention of the telephone.

Example 2.17
Following the v oltmeter setup of Fig. 2.60, design a v oltmeter for the 
following multiple ranges:
(a) 0–1 V    
(b) 0–5 V    
(c) 0–50 V    
(d) 0–100 V
Assume that the internal resistance Rm = 2 kΩ and the full-scale current 
Ifs =​100​μA.
Solution:
We apply Eq. (2.60) and assume that R1, R2, R3, and R4 correspond with 
ranges 0–1 V, 0–5 V, 0–50 V, and 0–100 V, respectively.
(a) For range 0–1 V,
 
 R 1 =  
1 
_______ 
100 ×  10 −6   − 2000 = 10,000 − 2000 = 8 kΩ 
(b) For range 0–5 V,
 
 R 2 =  
5 
_______ 
100 ×  10 −6   − 2000 = 50,000 − 2000 = 48 kΩ 
(c) For range 0–50 V,
 R 3 =  
50 
_______ 
100 ×  10 −6   − 2000 = 500,000 − 2000 = 498 kΩ 
(d) For range 0–100 V,
 R 4 =  100 V 
_______ 
100 ×  10 −6   − 2000 = 1,000,000 − 2000 = 998 kΩ 
Note that the ratio of the total resistance (Rn + Rm) to the full-scale volt-
age Vfs is constant and equal to 1/Ifs for the four ranges. This ratio (given 
in ohms per v olt, or Ω​/ V) is known as the sensitivity of the v oltmeter. 
The larger the sensitivity, the better the voltmeter.

 Summary
1. A resistor is a passi ve element in which the v oltage v across it is 
directly proportional to the current i through it. That is, a resistor is 
a device that obeys Ohm’s law,
 v = iR 
where R is the resistance of the resistor.
2. A short circuit is a resistor (a perfectly , conducting wire) with zero 
resistance (R = 0). An open circuit is a resistor with infinite resis- 
tance (R = ∞).
3. The conductance G of a resistor is the reciprocal of its resistance:
G =   1 
__ 
R
  
4. A branch is a single tw o-terminal element in an electric circuit. A 
node is the point of connection between tw o or more branches. A 
loop is a closed path in a circuit. The number of branches b, the 
number of nodes n, and the number of independent loops l in a net-
work are related as
 b = l + n − 1 
5. Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the currents at an y node 
algebraically sum to zero. In other w ords, the sum of the currents 
entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node.
6. Kirchhoff’s v oltage la w (KVL) states that the v
oltages around a 
closed path algebraically sum to zero. In other w ords, the sum of 
voltage rises equals the sum of voltage drops.
7. Two elements are in series when the y are connected sequentially , 
end to end. When elements are in series, the same current flows 
through them (i1 = i2). They are in parallel if the y are connected to 
the same two nodes. Elements in parallel always have the same volt-
age across them (v1 = v2).
8. When two resistors R1 (=​1/G1) and R2 (=​1/G2) are in series, their 
equivalent resistance Req and equivalent conductance Geq are
 R eq =  R 1 +  R 2 ,  
 G eq =   G 1 G 2  
_____ 
 G 1 +  G 2   
9. When two resistors R1 (=​1/G1) and R2 (=​1/G2) are in parallel, their 
equivalent resistance Req and equivalent conductance Geq are

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Electronics
One area of application for electric circuit analysis is electronics. 
The 
term electronics was originally used to distinguish circuits of very low 
current levels. This distinction no longer holds, as power semiconductor 
devices operate at high le vels of current. Today, electronics is regarded 
as the science of the motion of char ges in a g as, vacuum, or semicon -
ductor. Modern electronics in volves transistors and transistor circuits. 
The earlier electronic circuits were assembled from components. Man y 
electronic circuits are now produced as integrated circuits, fabricated in 
a semiconductor substrate or chip.
Electronic circuits find applications in many areas, such as automa-
tion, broadcasting, computers, and instrumentation. The range of devices 
that use electronic circuits is enormous and is limited only by our imagi-
nation. Radio, television, computers, and stereo systems are but a few.
An electrical engineer usually performs di
verse functions and is  
likely to use, design, or construct systems that incorporate some form of  
electronic circuits. Therefore, an understanding of the operation and anal-
ysis of electronics is essential to the electrical engineer . Electronics has 
become a specialty distinct from other disciplines within electrical engi -
neering. Because the field of electronics is ever advancing, an electronics 
engineer must update his/her knowledge from time to time. The best way 
to do this is by being a member of a professional organization such as the 
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). With a member-
ship of over 300,000, the IEEE is the largest professional organization in 
the world. Members benefit immensely from the numerous magazines, 
journals, transactions, and conference/symposium proceedings published 
yearly by IEEE. You should consider becoming an IEEE member.

 Introduction
Having understood the fundamental laws of circuit theory (Ohm’s law and 
Kirchhoff’s laws), we are now prepared to apply these laws to develop two 
powerful techniques for circuit analysis: nodal analysis, which is based 
on a systematic application of Kirchhof f’s current law (KCL), and mesh 
analysis, which is based on a systematic application of Kirchhoff’s voltage 
law (KVL). The two techniques are so important that this chapter should 
be regarded as the most important in the book. Students are therefore
 
encouraged to pay careful attention.
With the two techniques to be developed in this chapter, we can ana-
lyze any linear circuit by obtaining a set of simultaneous equations that are 
then solved to obtain the required values of current or voltage. One method 
of solving simultaneous equations involves Cramer’s rule, which allows us 
to calculate circuit variables as a quotient of determinants. The examples 
in the chapter will illustrate this method; Appendix A also briefly summa-
rizes the essentials the reader needs to kno w for applying Cramer’s rule. 
Another method of solving simultaneous equations is to use MATLAB, a 
computer software discussed in Appendix E.
Also in this chapter, we introduce the use of PSpice for Windows, a 
circuit simulation computer software program that we will use through-
out the text. Finally, we apply the techniques learned in this chapter to 
analyze transistor circuits.
3.2
 Nodal Analysis
Nodal analysis provides a general procedure for analyzing circuits using 
node voltages as the circuit v ariables. Choosing node v oltages instead 
of element voltages as circuit variables is convenient and reduces the 
number of equations one must solve simultaneously.
To simplify matters, we shall assume in this section that circuits do 
not contain voltage sources. Circuits that contain voltage sources will be 
analyzed in the next section.
In nodal analysis, we are interested in finding the node voltages. 
Given a circuit with n nodes without voltage sources, the nodal analysis 
of the circuit involves taking the following three steps.
80 
Chapter 3
Methods of Analysis
Nodal analysis is also known as the 
node-voltage method.
Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Understand Kirchhoff’s current law.
2. Understand Kirchhoff’s voltage law.
3. Develop an understanding of how to use Kirchhoff’s current 
law to write nodal equations and then to solve for unknown 
node voltages.
4. Develop an understanding of how to use Kirchhoff’s voltage 
law to write mesh equations and then to solve for unknown 
loop currents.
5. Explain how to use PSpice to solve for unknown node voltages 
and currents.

3.2
Nodal Analysis
81
Steps to Determine Node Voltages:
1. Select a node as the reference node. Assign voltages v1, v2,. . . , 
vn − 1 to the remaining n − 1 nodes. The voltages are refer-
enced with respect to the reference node.
 2. Apply KCL to each of the 
n − 1 nonreference nodes. Use 
Ohm’s law to express the branch currents in terms 
of node 
voltages.
 3. Solve the resulting simultaneous equations to obtain the un -
known node voltages.
The number of nonreference nodes is 
equal to the number of independent 
equations that we will derive.

We shall now explain and apply these three steps.
The first step in nodal analysis is selecting a node as the reference or 
datum node. The reference node is commonly called the ground since it 
is assumed to have zero potential. A reference node is indicated b y any 
of the three symbols in Fig. 3.1. The type of ground in Fig. 3.1(c) is called 
a chassis ground and is used in de vices where the case, enclosure, or 
chassis acts as a reference point for all circuits. When the potential of the 
earth is used as reference, we use the earth ground in Fig. 3.1(a) or (b). 
We shall always use the symbol in Fig. 3.1(b).
Once we ha ve selected a reference node, we assign v
oltage des -
ignations to nonreference nodes. Consider , for e xample, the circuit in 
Fig. 3.2(a). Node 0 is the reference node ( v = 0), while nodes 1 and 2 
are assigned voltages v1 and v2, respectively. Keep in mind that the node 
voltages are defined with respect to the reference node. As illustrated in 
Fig. 3.2(a), each node voltage is the voltage rise from the reference node 
to the corresponding nonreference node or simply the v
oltage of that 
node with respect to the reference node.
As the second step, we apply KCL to each nonreference node in the 
circuit. To avoid putting too much information on the same circuit, the 
circuit in Fig. 3.2(a) is redra wn in Fig. 3.2(b), where we no w add i1, i2, 
and i3 as the currents through resistors R1, R2, and R3, respectively. At 
node 1, applying KCL gives
 
I1 = I2 + i1 + i2 
(3.1)
At node 2,
 
I2 + i2 = i3 
(3.2)
We now apply Ohm’s law to express the unknown currents i1, i2, and i3 in 
terms of node voltages. The key idea to bear in mind is that, since resis-
tance is a passive element, by the passive sign convention, current must 
always flow from a higher potential to a lower potential.

Note that this principle is in agreement with the w ay we defined resis-

In terms of the conductances, Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) become
 
I1 = I2 + G1v1 + G2(v1 − v2) 
(3.7)
 
I2 + G2(v1 − v2) = G3v2 
(3.8)
The third step in nodal analysis is to solve for the node voltages. If 
we apply KCL to n − 1 nonreference nodes, we obtain n − 1 simulta-
neous equations such as Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) or (3.7) and (3.8). F or the 
circuit of Fig. 3.2, we solve Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) or (3.7) and (3.8) to ob-
tain the node voltages v1 and v2 using any standard method, such as the 
substitution method, the elimination method, Cramer’ s rule, or matrix 
inversion. To use either of the last two methods, one must cast the simul-
taneous equations in matrix form. For example, Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8) can 
be cast in matrix form as
 
 [ 
G1 + G2
−G2
 
−G2
G2 + G3 ] 
 
 [

 = 
 [

(3.9)
which can be solved to get v1 and v2. Equation 3.9 will be generalized in 
Section 3.6. The simultaneous equations may also be solv ed using cal-
culators or with software packages such as MATLAB, Mathcad, Maple, 
and Quattro Pro.

Chapter 3
Methods of Analysis
Appendix A discusses how to use 
Cramer’s rule.
Example 3.1
Calculate the node voltages in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.3(a).
Solution:
Consider Fig. 3.3(b), where the circuit in Fig. 3.3(a) has been prepared for 
nodal analysis. Notice how the currents are selected for the application 
of KCL. Except for the branches with current sources, the labeling of the 
currents is arbitrary but consistent. (By consistent, we mean that if, for
 
example, we assume that i2 enters the 4-Ω resistor from the left-hand side, 
i2 must leave the resistor from the right-hand side.) The reference node is 
selected, and the node voltages v1 and v2 are now to be determined.
At node 1, applying KCL and Ohm’s law gives
 
i1 = i2 + i3  ⇒  
5 =   v1 − v2 
______ 
4 
 +   v1 − 0

Multiplying each term in the last equation by 4, we obtain

or
3v1 −v2 = 20 
(3.1.1)
At node 2, we do the same thing and get
i2 + i4 = i1 + i5  
⇒

______ 
4 
 + 10 = 5 +   v2 − 0 
______ 
6  
Multiplying each term by 12 results in
3v1 − 3v2 + 120 = 60 + 2v2
or
−3v1 + 5v2 = 60 
(3.1.2)
Now we have two simultaneous Eqs. (3.1.1) and (3.1.2). We can solve 
the equations using any method and obtain the values of v1 and v2.
■ METHOD 1  Using the elimination technique, we add Eqs. (3.1.1) 
and (3.1.2).
4v2 = 80  
⇒  
v2 = 20 V
Substituting v2 = 20 in Eq. (3.1.1) gives
3v1 − 20 = 20  
⇒  
v1 =   40 
___ 
3   = 13.333 V
■ METHOD 2  To use Cramer’s rule, we need to put Eqs. (3.1.1) and 
(3.1.2) in matrix form as
 
 [  3   
−3   −1   5 ]  [  v1   
v2 ] =  [  20   
60  ] 
(3.1.3)
The determinant of the matrix is
Δ =  [  3   
−3   −1   5 ] = 15 − 3 = 12
We now obtain v1 and v2 as
v1 =   Δ1

Δ  =

−3   20   
60  ǀ  
________ 
Δ

________

giving us the same result as did the elimination method.
If we need the currents, we can easily calculate them from the values 
of the nodal voltages.
i1 = 5 A,  
 i2 =   v1 − v2 
______ 
4 
 = −1.6668 A,

i4 = 10 A,

__

The fact that i2 is negative shows that the current flows in the direction 
opposite to the one assumed.

(3.2.3)
We have three simultaneous equations to solve to get the node voltages 
v1, v2, and v3. We shall solve the equations in three ways.
■ METHOD 1  Using the elimination technique, we add Eqs. (3.2.1)  
and (3.2.3).
5v1 − 5v2 = 12
or
 
v1 − v2 =   12 
___ 
5   = 2.4 
(3.2.4)
Adding Eqs. (3.2.2) and (3.2.3) gives
 
−2v1 + 4v2 = 0  
 ⇒  
v1 = 2v2 
(3.2.5)

3.2
Nodal Analysis
85
Substituting Eq. (3.2.5) into Eq. (3.2.4) yields
2v2 − v2 = 2.4  
⇒  
v2 = 2.4,  
v1 = 2v2 = 4.8 V
From Eq. (3.2.3), we get
v3 = 3v2 − 2v1 = 3v2 − 4v2 = −v2 = −2.4 V
Thus,
v1 = 4.8 V,  
v2 = 2.4 V,  
v3 = −2.4 V
■ METHOD 2  To use Cramer’s rule, we put Eqs. (3.2.1) to (3.2.3) 
in matrix form.

■ METHOD 3  We now use MATLAB to solve the matrix. Equa-
tion (3.2.6) can be written as
AV = B  
⇒  
V = A−1B
where A is the 3 by 3 square matrix, B is the column vector, and V is a 
column vector comprised of v1, v2, and v3 that we want to determine. We 
use MATLAB to determine V as follows:
>>A = [3  −2  −1;  −4  7  −1;  2  −3  1];
>>B = [12  0  0]ʹ;
>>V = inv(A) * B
V =  
   4.8000

Thus, v1 = 4.8 V, v2 = 2.4 V, and v3 = −2.4 V, as obtained previously.

We now consider ho w voltage sources af fect nodal analysis. W e use the  
circuit in Fig. 3.7 for illustration. Consider the following two possibilities.
■ CASE 1  If a voltage source is connected between the reference 
node and a nonreference node, we simply set the voltage at the non
-
reference node equal to the voltage of the voltage source. In Fig. 3.7, for 
example,
 
v1 = 10 V 
(3.10)
Thus, our analysis is somewhat simplified by this knowledge of the volt-
age at this node.
■ CASE 2  If the voltage source (dependent or independent) is con -
nected between two nonreference nodes, the two nonreference nodes 

A supernode is formed by enclosing a (dependent or independent) 
voltage source connected between two nonreference nodes and any 
elements connected in parallel with it.
form a generalized node or supernode; we apply both KCL and KVL to 
determine the node voltages.

 A supernode may be regarded as a

In Fig. 3.7, nodes 2 and 3 form a supernode. (W e could have more than 
two nodes forming a single supernode. F or example, see the circuit in 
Fig. 3.14.) We analyze a circuit with supernodes using the same three 
steps mentioned in the pre vious section except that the supernodes are 
treated dif ferently. Why? Because an essential component of nodal 
analysis is applying KCL, which requires kno wing the current through 
each element. There is no way of knowing the current through a voltage 
source in advance. However, KCL must be satisfied at a supernode like 
any other node. Hence, at the super node in Fig. 3.7,

From Eqs. (3.10), (3.11b), and (3.12), we obtain the node voltages.
Note the following properties of a supernode:
1. The v oltage source inside the supernode pro
vides a constraint  
equation needed to solve for the node voltages.
2. A supernode has no voltage of its own.
3. A supernode requires the application of both KCL and KVL.

3v1 − v3 − 2v4 = 0 
(3.4.4)
For loop 3,
vx − 3vx + 6i3 − 20 = 0
But 6i3 = v3 − v2 and vx = v1 − v4. Hence,
 
−2v1 − v2 + v3 + 2v4 = 20 
(3.4.5)
We need four node v oltages, v1, v2, v3, and v4, and it requires only 
four out of the five Eqs. (3.4.1) to (3.4.5) to find them. Although the fifth 
equation is redundant, it can be used to check results. We can solve Eqs. 
(3.4.1) to (3.4.4) directly using MATLAB. We can eliminate one node 
voltage so that we solv e three simultaneous equations instead of four . 
From Eq. (3.4.3), v2 = v1 − 20. Substituting this into Eqs. (3.4.1) and 
(3.4.2), respectively, gives
 
6v1 − v3 − 2v4 = 80 
(3.4.6)
and
 
6v1 − 5v3 − 16v4 = 40 
(3.4.7)
Equations (3.4.4), (3.4.6), and (3.4.7) can be cast in matrix form as

 Mesh Analysis
Mesh analysis provides another general procedure for analyzing circuits, 
using mesh currents as the circuit variables. Using mesh currents instead 
of element currents as circuit variables is convenient and reduces the 
number of equations that must be solved simultaneously. Recall that a 
loop is a closed path with no node passed more than once. A mesh is a 
loop that does not contain any other loop within it.
Nodal analysis applies KCL to find unknown voltages in a given 
circuit, while mesh analysis applies KVL to find unknown currents. 
Mesh analysis is not quite as general as nodal analysis because it is
 
only applicable to a circuit that is planar. A planar circuit is one that 
can be drawn in a plane with no branches crossing one another; other-
wise it is nonplanar. A circuit may have crossing branches and still be 
planar if it can be redra wn such that it has no crossing branches. F or 
example, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a) has tw o crossing branches, b ut it 
can be redrawn as in Fig. 3.15(b). Hence, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a) is  
planar. However, the circuit in Fig. 3.16 is nonplanar , because there  
is no w ay to redra w it and a void the branches crossing. Nonplanar 
circuits can be handled using nodal analysis, but they will not be con-
sidered in this text.
 Mesh analysis is also known as loop 
analysis or the mesh-current method.

To illustrate the steps, consider the circuit in Fig. 3.17. 
The first 
step requires that mesh currents i1 and i2 are assigned to meshes 1 and 
2. Although a mesh current may be assigned to each mesh in an arbi
-
trary direction, it is conventional to assume that each mesh current flows 
clockwise.
As the second step, we apply KVL to each mesh. Applying KVL to 
mesh 1, we obtain
 
−V1 + R1i1 + R3 (i1 − i2) = 0
or
 
(R1 + R3) i1 − R3i2 = V1 
(3.13)
For mesh 2, applying KVL gives
 
R2 i2 + V2 + R3 (i2 − i1) = 0
or
 
−R3 i1 + (R2 + R3) i2 = −V2 
(3.14)
Note in Eq. (3.13) that the coefficient of i1 is the sum of the resistances 
in the first mesh, while the coefficient of i2 is the negative of the resis-
tance common to meshes 1 and 2. Now observe that the same is true in 
Eq. (3.14). This can serve as a shortcut way of writing the mesh equa -
tions. We will exploit this idea in Section 3.6.
Steps to Determine Mesh Currents:
1. Assign mesh currents i1, i2, . . . , in to the n meshes.
 2. Apply KVL to each 
of the n meshes. Use Ohm’s law to  
express the voltages in terms of the mesh currents.
 3. Solve the resulting n simultaneous equations to get the mesh 
currents.
The direction of the mesh current is 
 arbitrary—(clockwise or counterclock-
wise)—and does not affect the validity 
of the solution.
Although path abcdefa is a loop and 
not a mesh, KVL still holds. This is the 
reason for loosely using the terms 
loop analysis and mesh analysis to 
mean the same thing.
In Fig. 3.17, for example, paths abefa and bcdeb are meshes, but path 
abcdefa is not a mesh. The current through a mesh is known as 
mesh 
current. In mesh analysis, we are interested in applying KVL to find the 
mesh currents in a given circuit.
In this section, we will apply mesh analysis to planar circuits that do 
not contain current sources. In the next section, we will consider circuits 
with current sources. In the mesh analysis of a circuit with n meshes, we 
take the following three steps.
The shortcut way will not apply if one 
mesh current is assumed clockwise 
and the other assumed counter- 
clockwise, although this is permissible.

The third step is to solve for the mesh currents. Putting Eqs. (3.13) 
and (3.14) in matrix form yields
[ 
R1 + R3
−R3
 
−R3
R2 + R3  ] 
 
 [ 
i1
i2 ] 
 = 
 [ 
V1
−V2 ] 
 
(3.15)
which can be solved to obtain the mesh currents i1 and i2. We are at  
liberty to use any technique for solving the simultaneous equations. 
According to Eq. (2.12), if a circuit has n nodes, b branches, and l in-
dependent loops or meshes, then l = b − n + 1. Hence, l independent 
simultaneous equations are required to solve the circuit using mesh 
analysis.
Notice that the branch currents are different from the mesh currents 
unless the mesh is isolated. To distinguish between the two types of cur-
rents, we use i for a mesh current and I for a branch current. The current 
elements I1, I2, and I3 are algebraic sums of the mesh currents. It is e vi-
dent from Fig. 3.17 that
 
I1 = i1,  
 I2 = i2,  
 I3 = i1 − i2 
(3.16)

For the circuit in Fig. 3.18, find the branch currents I1, I2, and I3 using 
mesh analysis.
Solution:
We first obtain the mesh currents using KVL. For mesh 1,
−15 + 5i1 + 10(i1 − i2) + 10 = 0
or
3i1 − 2i2 = 1 
(3.5.1)
For mesh 2,
6i2 + 4i2 + 10(i2 − i1) − 10 = 0
or
 
i1 = 2i2 − 1 
(3.5.2)
■ METHOD 1  Using the substitution method, we substitute 
Eq. (3.5.2) into Eq. (3.5.1), and write
6i2 − 3 − 2i2 = 1  
 ⇒  
 i2 = 1 A
From Eq. (3.5.2), i1 = 2i2 − 1 = 2 − 1 = 1 A. Thus,
I1 = i1 = 1 A,  
 I2 = i2 = 1 A,  
 I3 = i1 − i2 = 0
■ METHOD 2  To use Cramer’s rule, we cast Eqs. (3.5.1) and (3.5.2) 
in matrix form as

 Mesh Analysis with Current Sources
Applying mesh analysis to circuits containing current sources (dependent  
or independent) may appear complicated. But it is actually much easier  
than what we encountered in the previous section, because the presence  
of the current sources reduces the number of equations. Consider the fol-
lowing two possible cases.
■ CASE 1  When a current source exists only in one mesh: Consider 
the circuit in Fig. 3.22, for example. We set i2 = −5 A and write a mesh 
equation for the other mesh in the usual way; that is,
 
−10 + 4i1 + 6(i1 − i2) = 0  
 ⇒  
 i1 = −2 A 
(3.17)
■ CASE 2  When a current source exists between two meshes: Con-
sider the circuit in Fig. 3.23(a), for example. We create a supermesh by 
excluding the current source and any elements connected in series with 
it, as shown in Fig. 3.23(b). Thus,
As shown in Fig. 3.23(b), we create a supermesh as the periphery of the two 
meshes and treat it differently. (If a circuit has two or more supermeshes  
that intersect, they should be combined to form a larger supermesh.) Why 
treat the supermesh differently? Because mesh analysis applies KVL—
which requires that we know the voltage across each branch—and we  
do not know the voltage across a current source in advance. However, a  
supermesh must satisfy KVL like any other mesh. Therefore, applying 
KVL to the supermesh in Fig. 3.23(b) gives
 
−20 + 6i1 + 10i2 + 4i2 = 0

or
6i1 + 14i2 = 20 
(3.18)
We apply KCL to a node in the branch where the two meshes intersect. 
Applying KCL to node 0 in Fig. 3.23(a) gives
i2 = i1 + 6 
(3.19)
Solving Eqs. (3.18) and (3.19), we get
i1 = −3.2 A,  
 i2 = 2.8 A 
(3.20)
Note the following properties of a supermesh:
1. The current source in the supermesh pro
vides the constraint  
equation necessary to solve for the mesh currents.
2. A supermesh has no current of its own.
3. A supermesh requires the application of both KVL and KCL.

Solution:
Note that meshes 1 and 2 form a supermesh because they have an inde-
pendent current source in common. Also, meshes 2 and 3 form another 
supermesh because they have a dependent current source in common. 
The two supermeshes intersect and form a larger supermesh as shown. 
Applying KVL to the larger supermesh,
2i1 + 4i3 + 8(i3 − i4) + 6i2 = 0
or
 
i1 + 3i2 + 6i3 − 4i4 = 0 
(3.7.1)
For the independent current source, we apply KCL to node P:
i2 = i1 + 5 
(3.7.2)
For the dependent current source, we apply KCL to node Q:
i2 = i3 + 3Io

But Io = −i4, hence,
 
i2 = i3 − 3i4 
(3.7.3)
Applying KVL in mesh 4,
2i4 + 8(i4 − i3) + 10 = 0

 Nodal and Mesh Analyses  
by Inspection
This section presents a generalized procedure for nodal or mesh analysis. 
It is a shortcut approach based on mere inspection of a circuit.
When all sources in a circuit are independent current sources, we  
do not need to apply KCL to each node to obtain the node-v
oltage 
equations as we did in Section 3.2. We can obtain the equations by 
mere inspection of the circuit. As an e xample, let us ree xamine the 
circuit in Fig. 3.2, shown again in Fig. 3.26(a) for convenience. The 
 circuit has two nonreference nodes and the node equations were de-
rived in Section 3.2 as
 
 [ 
G1 + G2
−G2
 
−G2
G2 + G3 ] 
 
 [ 
v1
v2 ] 
 = 
 [ 
I1 − I2
I2
 ] 
 
(3.21)
Observe that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the conductances 
connected directly to node 1 or 2, while the off-diagonal terms are the 
negatives of the conductances connected between the nodes. Also, each 
term on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.21) is the algebraic sum of the cur-
rents entering the node.
In general, if a circuit with independent current sources has N non-
reference nodes, the node-v oltage equations can be written in terms of 
the conductances as

G is called the conductance matrix; v is the output v ector; and i is the 
input vector. Equation (3.22) can be solved to obtain the unknown node 
voltages. Keep in mind that this is v alid for circuits with only indepen -
dent current sources and linear resistors.
Similarly, we can obtain mesh-current equations by inspection when 
a linear resistive circuit has only independent voltage sources. Consider 
the circuit in Fig. 3.17, shown again in Fig. 3.26(b) for convenience. The 
circuit has two nonreference nodes and the node equations were derived

We notice that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the resistances in 
the related mesh, while each of the off-diagonal terms is the negative of

side of Eq. (3.24) is the algebraic sum taken clockwise of all independent 
voltage sources in the related mesh.

Example 3.8
Write the node-voltage matrix equations for the circuit in Fig. 3.27 by 
inspection.
Solution:
The circuit in Fig. 3.27 has four nonreference nodes, so we need four 
node equations. This implies that the size of the conductance matrix G, 
is 4 by 4. The diagonal terms of G, in siemens, are
G11 =  1 
__ 5  +  1 
___

G22 =  1

__ 4  = 0.5,  
G44 =  1 
__ 8  +  1

__ 1  = 1.625
The off-diagonal terms are
G12 = − 1 
__ 5  = −0.2,  
G13 = G14 = 0
G21 = −0.2,  
G23 = − 1

G34 = − 1 
__ 8  = −0.125
G41 = 0,  
G42 = −1,  
G43 = −0.125
The input current vector i has the following terms, in amperes:
i1 = 3,  
i2 = −1 − 2 = −3,  
i3 = 0,  
i4 = 2 + 4 = 6

By inspection, write the mesh-current equations for the circuit in Fig. 3.29.
Solution:
We have five meshes, so the resistance matrix is 5 by 5. The diagonal 
terms, in ohms, are:
R11 = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9,  
R22 = 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10,
R33 = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9,  
R44 = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8,  
R55 = 1 + 3 = 4
The off-diagonal terms are:
R12 = −2,  
R13 = −2,  
R14 = 0 = R15,
R21 = −2,  
R23 = −4,  
R24 = −1,

R43 = 0,  
R45 = −3,
R51 = 0,  
R52 = −1,  
R53 = 0,  
R54 = −3
The input voltage vector v has the following terms in volts:

Nodal Versus Mesh Analysis
Both nodal and mesh analyses provide a systematic way of analyzing a 
complex network. Someone may ask: Gi ven a network to be analyzed, 
how do we know which method is better or more efficient? The choice of 
the better method is dictated by two factors.

	
3.8
Circuit Analysis with PSpice	
103
The first factor is the nature of the particular network. Networks that 
contain many series-connected elements, voltage sources, or supermeshes  
are more suitable for mesh analysis, whereas networks with parallel-
connected elements, current sources, or supernodes are more suitable 
for nodal analysis. Also, a circuit with fewer nodes than meshes is better 
analyzed using nodal analysis, while a circuit with fewer meshes than 
nodes is better analyzed using mesh analysis. The key is to select the 
method that results in the smaller number of ­equations.
The second factor is the information required. If node voltages are 
required, it may be expedient to apply nodal analysis. If branch or mesh 
currents are required, it may be better to use mesh analysis.
It is helpful to be familiar with both methods of analysis, for at least 
two reasons. First, one method can be used to check the results from the 
other method, if possible. Second, since each method has its limitations, 
only one method may be suitable for a particular problem. For example, 
mesh analysis is the only method to use in analyzing transistor circuits, 
as we shall see in Section 3.9. But mesh analysis cannot easily be used to 
solve an op amp circuit, as we shall see in Chapter 5, because there is no 
direct way to obtain the voltage across the op amp itself. For nonplanar 
networks, nodal analysis is the only option, because mesh analysis only 
applies to planar networks. Also, nodal analysis is more amenable to  
solution by computer, as it is easy to program. This allows one to analyze 
complicated circuits that defy hand calculation. A computer software 
package based on nodal analysis is introduced next.
3.8
Circuit Analysis with PSpice
PSpice is a computer software circuit analysis program that we will 
gradually learn to use throughout the course of this text. This section 
illustrates how to use PSpice for Windows to analyze the dc circuits we 
have studied so far.
The reader is expected to review the tutorial before proceeding in 
this section. It should be noted that PSpice is only helpful in determining 
branch voltages and currents when the numerical values of all the circuit 
components are known.

Solution:
The first step is to draw the given circuit using Schematics. If one fol-
lows the instructions given in the PSpice tutorial found in Connect, the 
schematic in Fig. 3.32 is produced. Because this is a dc analysis, we 
use voltage source VDC and current source IDC. The pseudocomponent 
VIEWPOINTS are added to display the required node voltages. Once the 
circuit is drawn and saved as exam310.sch, we run PSpice by selecting 
Analysis/Simulate. The circuit is simulated and the results are displayed

Solution:
The schematic is shown in Fig. 3.35. (The schematic in Fig. 3.35
 
includes the output results, implying that it is the schematic displayed 
on the screen after the simulation.) Notice that the voltage-controlled 
voltage source E1 in Fig. 3.35 is connected so that its input is the volt-
age across the 4- Ω resistor; its gain is set equal to 3. In order to dis

play the required currents, we insert pseudocomponent IPROBES in 
the appropriate branches. The schematic is saved as exam311.sch and

†Applications: DC Transistor Circuits
Most of us deal with electronic products on a routine basis and ha
ve 
some e xperience with personal computers. 
A basic component for 
the integrated circuits found in these electronics and computers is the  
active, three-terminal device known as the transistor. Understanding the 
transistor is essential before an engineer can start an electronic circuit 
design.
Figure 3.37 depicts various kinds of transistors commercially avail-
able. There are tw o basic types of transistors: bipolar junction tr ansis-
tors (BJTs) and field-effect transistors (FETs). Here, we consider only 
the BJTs, which were the first of the two and are still used today . Our 
objective is to present enough detail about the BJT to enable us to apply 
the techniques developed in this chapter to analyze dc transistor circuits.
Use PSpice to determine currents i1, i2, and i3 in the circuit of Fig. 3.36.
Answer: i1 = −428.6 mA, i2 = 2.286 A, i3 = 2 A.

There are two types of BJTs: npn and pnp, with their circuit sym -

emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C). For the npn transistor, the cur-
rents and voltages of the transistor are specified as in Fig. 3.39. Applying 
KCL to Fig. 3.39(a) gives
 
IE = IB + IC 
(3.27)
Historical
William Schockley (1910–1989), John Bardeen (1908–1991), and 
Walter Brattain (1902–1987) co-invented the transistor.
Nothing has had a greater impact on the transition from the “Indus-
trial Age” to the “Age of the Engineer” than the transistor. I am sure that 
Dr. Shockley, Dr. Bardeen, and Dr. Brattain had no idea they would have 
this incredible effect on our history. While working at Bell Laboratories, 
they successfully demonstrated the point-contact transistor, invented by 
Bardeen and Brattain in 1947, and the junction transistor, which Shock-
ley conceived in 1948 and successfully produced in 1951.
It is interesting to note that the idea of the field-effect transistor, the 
most commonly used one today, was first conceived in 1925–1928 by  
J. E. Lilienfeld, a German immigrant to the United States. This is evident 
from his patents of what appears to be a field-effect transistor. Unfortu-
nately, the technology to realize this device had to wait until 1954 when 
Shockley’s field-effect transistor became a reality. Just think what today 
would be like if we had this transistor 30 years earlier!
For their contributions to the creation of the transistor, Dr. Shockley, 
Dr. Bardeen, and Dr. Brattain received, in 1956, the Nobel Prize in phys-
ics. It should be noted that Dr. Bardeen is the only individual to win two 
Nobel prizes in physics; the second came later for work in superconduc-
tivity at the University of Illinois.

where IE, IC, and IB are emitter, collector, and base currents, respectively. 
Similarly, applying KVL to Fig. 3.39(b) gives
 
VCE + VEB + VBC = 0 
(3.28)
where VCE, VEB, and VBC are collector -emitter, emitter-base, and base-
collector voltages. The BJT can operate in one of three modes: acti ve, 
cutoff, and saturation. When transistors operate in the active mode, typi-
cally VBE ≃ 0.7 V,
 
IC = α IE 
(3.29)
where α is called the 
common-base curr ent gain. In Eq. (3.29), 
 
α denotes the fraction of electrons injected by the emitter that are col
-
lected by the collector. Also,
 
IC = βIB 
(3.30)
where β is known as the common-emitter current gain. The α and β are 
characteristic properties of a given transistor and assume constant values 
for that transistor. Typically, α takes values in the range of 0.98 to 0.999, 
while β takes values in the range of 50 to 1000. From Eqs. (3.27) to (3.30), 
it is evident that
 
IE = (1 + β)IB 
(3.31)
and
 
β =  α 
_____ 
1 − α  
(3.32)
These equations show that, in the active mode, the BJT can be modeled 
as a dependent current-controlled current source. Thus, in circuit analy-
sis, the dc equi valent model in Fig. 3.40(b) may be used to replace the 
npn transistor in Fig. 3.40(a). Since β in Eq. (3.32) is large, a small base 
current controls lar ge currents in the output circuit. Consequently , the 
bipolar transistor can serve as an amplifier, producing both current gain 
and voltage gain. Such amplifiers can be used to furnish a  considerable 
amount of power to transducers such as loudspeakers or control motors.

It should be observ ed in the follo wing examples that one cannot 
directly analyze transistor circuits using nodal analysis because of the po-
tential difference between the terminals of the transistor . Only when the 
transistor is replaced by its equivalent model can we apply nodal  analysis.
In fact, transistor circuits provide moti-
vation to study dependent sources.

ed. There appear to be no additional questions that need to be asked.
2. Present. We are to determine the output voltage of the circuit shown 
in Fig. 3.43. The circuit contains an ideal transistor with β = 150 
and VBE = 0.7 V.

We can try both approaches and use them to check each other . As 
a third check, we can use the equi valent circuit and solv e it using 
PSpice.

Now for loop 2.
200k(I2 − I1) + VBE = 0  
or  
−2I1 + 2I2 = −0.7 × 10−5
 
(3.13.2)
Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve for 
I1 
and I2. Adding Eq. (3.13.1) to (3.13.2) we get;
I1 = 1.3 × 10−5A   
and  
I2 = (−0.7 + 2.6)10−5∕2 = 9.5 µA
Since I3 = −150I2 = −1.425 mA, we can now solve for vo using loop 3:
−vo + 1 kI3 + 16 = 0  
or  
vo = −1.425 + 16 = 14.575 V
■ METHOD 2  Replacing the transistor with its equivalent circuit  
produces the circuit shown in Fig. 3.44(b). We can now use nodal 
 
analysis to solve for vo.
At node number 1: V1 = 0.7 V
(0.7 − 2)∕100k + 0.7∕200k + IB = 0  
or  
IB = 9.5 µA
At node number 2 we have:
150IB + (vo − 16)∕1k = 0  
or
vo = 16 − 150 × 103 × 9.5 × 10−6 = 14.575 V

Summary
 1. Nodal analysis is the application of Kirchhoff’s current law at the 
nonreference nodes. (It is applicable to both planar and nonplanar 
circuits.) We express the result in terms of the node voltages. Solv -
ing the simultaneous equations yields the node voltages.
 2. A supernode consists of two nonreference nodes connected by a 
 
(dependent or independent) voltage source.
 3. Mesh analysis is the application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law around 
meshes in a planar circuit. We express the result in terms of mesh 
currents. Solving the simultaneous equations yields the mesh 
 currents.
The transistor circuit in Fig. 3.45 has β = 80 and VBE = 0.7 V. Find vo 
and Io.
Answer: 12 V, 600 µ A.

4. A supermesh consists of two meshes that have a (dependent or inde-
pendent) current source in common.
5. Nodal analysis is normally used when a circuit has fewer node equa-
tions than mesh equations. Mesh analysis is normally used when a 
circuit has fewer mesh equations than node equations.
6. Circuit analysis can be carried out using PSpice.
7. DC transistor circuits can be analyzed using the techniques covered 
in this chapter.

Your success as an engineer will be directly proportional to your ability 
to communicate!

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
Enhancing Your Communication Skills
Taking a course in circuit analysis is one step in preparing yourself for 
a career in electrical engineering. Enhancing your communication skills 
while in school should also be part of that preparation, as a large part of 
your time will be spent communicating.
People in industry have complained again and again that graduating 
engineers are ill-prepared in written and oral communication. An engi-
neer who communicates effectively becomes a valuable asset.
You can probably speak or write easily and quickly. But how effec-
tively do you communicate? The art of effective communication is of the 
utmost importance to your success as an engineer.
For engineers in industry , communication is k ey to promotability. 
Consider the result of a survey of U.S. corporations that asked what fac-
tors influence managerial promotion. The survey includes a listing of 
22 personal qualities and their importance in adv ancement. You may be 
surprised to note that “technical skill based on experience” placed fourth 
from the bottom. Attributes such as self-confidence, ambition, flexibility, 
maturity, ability to make sound decisions, getting things done with and 
through people, and capacity for hard work all ranked higher. At the top 
of the list w as “ability to communicate. ” The higher your professional 
career progresses, the more you will need to communicate. 
Therefore, 
you should regard effective communication as an important tool in your 
engineering tool chest.
Learning to communicate ef fectively is a lifelong task you should 
always work toward. The best time to begin is while still in school. Con-
tinually look for opportunities to de velop and strengthen your reading, 
writing, listening, and speaking skills. You can do this through classroom 
presentations, team projects, acti ve participation in student or ganiza-
tions, and enrollment in communication courses. The risks are less now 
than later in the workplace.
Ability to communicate effectively is re-
garded by many as the most important 
step to an executive promotion.

Circuit Theorems
4.1
 Introduction
A major adv antage of analyzing circuits using Kirchhof f’s laws as we 
did in Chapter 3 is that we can analyze a circuit without tampering with 
its original configuration. A major disadvantage of this approach is that, 
for a large, complex circuit, tedious computation is involved.
The growth in areas of application of electric circuits has led to an 
evolution from simple to complex circuits. To handle the complexity, en-
gineers over the years have developed some theorems to simplify circuit 
analysis. Such theorems include Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems. Since 
these theorems are applicable to linear circuits, we first discuss the concept 
of circuit linearity. In addition to circuit theorems, we discuss the concepts 
of superposition, source transformation, and maximum power transfer in 
this chapter. The concepts we de velop are applied in the last section to 
source modeling and resistance measurement.
4.2
 Linearity Property
Linearity is the property of an element describing a linear relationship 
between cause and effect. Although the property applies to many circuit 
elements, we shall limit its applicability to resistors in this chapter. The 
property is a combination of both the homogeneity (scaling) property 
and the additivity property.
The homogeneity property requires that if the input (also called the 
excitation) is multiplied by a constant, then the output (also called the 
response) is multiplied by the same constant. For a resistor, for example, 
Ohm’s law relates the input i to the output v,
 
v = iR 
(4.1)
If the current is increased by a constant k, then the voltage increases cor-
respondingly by k; that is,
 
kiR = kv

Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Develop and enhance your skills in using nodal analysis and 
mesh analysis to analyze basic circuits.
2. Understand how linearity works with basic circuits.
3. Explain the principle of superposition and how it can be used 
to help analyze circuits.
4. Understand the value of source transformation and how it can 
be used to simplify circuits.
5. Recognize Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems and know how 
they can lead to greatly simplified circuits.
6. Explain the maximum power transfer concept.

Throughout this book we consider only linear circuits. Note that since 
p = i2R = v2∕R (making it a quadratic function rather than a linear one), the 
relationship between power and voltage (or current) is nonlinear . There-
fore, the theorems covered in this chapter are not applicable to power.
To illustrate the linearity principle, consider the linear circuit shown 
in Fig. 4.1. The linear circuit has no independent sources inside it. It is 
excited by a v oltage source vs, which serv es as the input. The circuit 
is terminated by a load R. We may tak e the current i through R as the 
output. Suppose vs = 10  V gives i = 2  A. According to the linearity prin-
ciple, vs = 1  V will give i = 0.2  A. By the same token, i = 1  mA must be 
due to vs = 5  mV.
4.2
Linearity Property
127
A linear circuit is one whose output is linearly related (or directly pro-
portional) to its input.
For example, when current i1 flows 
through resistor R, the power is p1 = Ri1 
2, 
and when current i2 flows through R, the 
power is p2 = Ri2 
2. If current i1 + i2 flows 
through R, the power absorbed is p3 = 
R(i1 + i2)2 = Ri1 
2 + Ri2 
2 + 2Ri1i2 ≠ p1 + p2. 
Thus, the power  relation is nonlinear.

Example 4.1
For the circuit in Fig. 4.2, find Io when vs = 12 V and vs = 24 V.
Solution:
Applying KVL to the two loops, we obtain
 
12i1 − 4i2 + vs = 0 
(4.1.1)
 
−4i1 + 16i2 − 3vx − vs = 0 
(4.1.2)
But vx = 2i1. Equation (4.1.2) becomes
−10i1 + 16i2 − vs = 0 
(4.1.3)
Adding Eqs. (4.1.1) and (4.1.3) yields
2i1 + 12i2 = 0  
⇒  
i1 = −6i2
Substituting this in Eq. (4.1.1), we get
−76i2 + vs = 0   
⇒  
i2 =   vs

For Example 4.1.
The additivity property requires that the response to a sum of inputs 
is the sum of the responses to each input applied separately . Using the 
voltage-current relationship of a resistor, if
v1 = i1R 
(4.3a)
and
 
v2 = i2R 
(4.3b)
then applying (i1 + i2) gives
 
v = (i1 + i2)R = i1R + i2R = v1 + v2
 
(4.4)
We say that a resistor is a linear element because the voltage-current 
relationship satisfies both the homogeneity and the additivity properties.
In general, a circuit is linear if it is both additive and homogeneous. A 
linear circuit consists of only linear elements, linear dependent sources,  
and independent sources.

Solution:
If Io = 1 A, then V1 = (3 + 5)Io = 8 V and I1 = V1∕4 = 2 A. Applying 
KCL at node 1 gives
I2 = I1 + Io = 3 A
V2 = V1 + 2I2 = 8 + 6 = 14  V,   I3 =   V2  
___ 
7   = 2 A
Applying KCL at node 2 gives
I4 = I3 + I2 = 5 A
Therefore, Is = 5 A. This shows that assuming Io = 1 gives Is = 5 A, the 
actual source current of 15 A will give Io = 3 A as the actual value.

The principle of superposition helps us to analyze a linear circuit with 
more than one independent source by calculating the contrib
ution of 
each independent source separately. However, to apply the superposition 
principle, we must keep two things in mind:
1. We consider one independent source at a time while all other inde-
pendent sources are turned off. This implies that we replace e very 
voltage source by 0 V (or a short circuit), and e very current source 
by 0 A (or an open circuit). This way we obtain a simpler and more 
manageable circuit.
2. Dependent sources are left intact because the
y are controlled by 
circuit variables.
With these in mind, we apply the superposition principle in three steps:
4.3
Superposition
129
The superposition principle states that the voltage across (or current 
through) an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the volt-
ages across (or currents through) that element due to each independent 
source acting alone.
 Superposition is not limited to circuit 
analysis but is applicable in many 
fields where cause and effect bear a 
linear relationship to one another.
Other terms such as killed, made 
inactive, deadened, or set equal to 
zero are often used to convey the 
same idea.
Steps to Apply Superposition Principle:
1. Turn off all independent sources e xcept one source. Find the 
output (voltage or current) due to that active source using the 
techniques covered in Chapters 2 and 3.
2. Repeat step 1 for each of the other independent sources.
3. Find the total contribution by adding algebraically all the  
contributions due to the independent sources.
Analyzing a circuit using superposition has one major disadvantage: 
It may very likely involve more work. If the circuit has three independent 
sources, we may ha ve to analyze three simpler circuits each pro viding 
the contribution due to the respective individual source. However, super-
position does help reduce a comple x circuit to simpler circuits through 
replacement of voltage sources by short circuits and of current sources 
by open circuits.
Keep in mind that superposition is based on linearity . For this rea-
son, it is not applicable to the ef fect on power due to each source, be -
cause the po wer absorbed by a resistor depends on the square of the 
voltage or current. If the power value is needed, the current through (or 
voltage across) the element must be calculated first using superposition.
4.3
 Superposition
If a circuit has two or more independent sources, one w ay to determine 
the value of a specific variable (voltage or current) is to use nodal or 
mesh analysis as in Chapter 3. Another way is to determine the contribu-
tion of each independent source to the v ariable and then add them up. 
The latter approach is known as the superposition principle.
The idea of superposition rests on the linearity property.

130 
Chapter 4
Circuit Theorems
Solution:
Since there are two sources, let
v = v1 + v2
where v1 and v2 are the contributions due to the 6-V v oltage source and 
the 3-A current source, respecti vely. To obtain v1, we set the current 
source to zero, as sho wn in Fig. 4.7(a). Applying KVL to the loop in  
Fig. 4.7(a) gives
12i1 − 6 = 0   
⇒  
i1 = 0.5 A
Thus,
v1 = 4i1 = 2 V
We may also use voltage division to get v1 by writing
v1 =   4 
_____ 
4 + 8  (6) = 2 V
To get v2, we set the voltage source to zero, as in Fig. 4.7(b). Using cur-
rent division,
i3 =   8 
_____ 
4 + 8   (3) = 2 A
Hence,
v2 = 4i3 = 8 V 
And we find
v = v1 + v2 = 2 + 8 = 10 V

 Source Transformation
We have noticed that series-parallel combination and wye-delta trans-
formation help simplify circuits. Source transformation is another tool 
for simplifying circuits. Basic to these tools is the concept of 
equiva-
lence. We recall that an equivalent circuit is one whose v-i characteristics 
are identical with the original circuit.
In Section 3.6, we sa w that node-v oltage (or mesh-current) equa -
tions can be obtained by mere inspection of a circuit when the sources 
are all independent current (or all independent v
oltage) sources. It is 
therefore expedient in circuit analysis to be able to substitute a v oltage 
source in series with a resistor for a current source in parallel with a

resistor, or vice versa, as shown in Fig. 4.15. Either substitution is known 
as a source transformation.

Transformation of independent sources.
The two circuits in Fig. 4.15 are equi
valent—provided they have the 
same voltage-current relation at terminals a-b. It is easy to sho w that 
they are indeed equi valent. If the sources are turned off, the equivalent 
resistance at terminals a-b in both circuits is R. Also, when terminals  
a-b are short-circuited, the short-circuit current flowing from a to b is 
isc = vs∕R in the circuit on the left-hand side and isc = is for the circuit 
on the right-hand side. Thus, vs∕R = is in order for the two circuits to be 
equivalent. Hence, source transformation requires that
 
vs = isR  
or   
is =  vs

Source transformation also applies to dependent sources, pro vided 
we carefully handle the dependent v ariable. As shown in Fig. 4.16, a 
dependent voltage source in series with a resistor can be transformed to a 
dependent current source in parallel with the resistor or vice versa where 
we make sure that Eq. (4.5) is satisfied.

Like the wye-delta transformation we studied in Chapter 2, a source 
transformation does not af fect the remaining part of the circuit. When 
applicable, source transformation is a po werful tool that allo ws circuit 
manipulations to ease circuit analysis. However, we should keep the fol-
lowing points in mind when dealing with source transformation.
1. Note from Fig. 4.15 (or Fig. 4.16) that the arrow of the current source 
is directed toward the positive terminal of the voltage source.
2. Note from Eq. (4.5) that source transformation is not possible when 
R = 0, which is the case with an ideal voltage source. However, for a 
practical, nonideal voltage source, R ≠ 0. Similarly, an ideal current 
source with R = ∞ cannot be replaced by a finite voltage source. 
More will be said on ideal and nonideal sources in Section 4.10.1.

Use source transformation to find vo in the circuit of Fig. 4.17.
Solution:
We first transform the current and voltage sources to obtain the cir -

transforming the 12-V v oltage source gi ves us Fig. 4.18(b). We now 
combine the 3-Ω and 6-Ω resistors in parallel to get 2-Ω. We also com-
bine the 2-A and 4-A current sources to get a 2-A source. 
Thus, by 
repeatedly applying source transformations, we obtain the circuit in 
Fig. 4.18(c).

Substituting this into Eq. (4.7.1), we obtain

Alternatively, we may apply KVL to the loop containing vx, the 4-Ω re-

voltage source in Fig. 4.21(b). We obtain

 Thevenin’s Theorem
It often occurs in practice that a particular element in a circuit is variable 
(usually called the load) while other elements are fixed. As a typical 
example, a household outlet terminal may be connected to dif ferent ap-
pliances constituting a v ariable load. Each time the v ariable element is 
changed, the entire circuit has to be analyzed all over again. To avoid this 
problem, Thevenin’s theorem pro vides a technique by which the fixed 
part of the circuit is replaced by an equivalent circuit.
According to Thevenin’s theorem, the linear circuit in Fig. 4.23(a) 
can be replaced by that in Fig. 4.23(b). (The load in Fig. 4.23 may be a 
single resistor or another circuit.) The circuit to the left of the terminals 
a-b in Fig. 4.23(b) is kno wn as the Thevenin equivalent circuit; it w as 
developed in 1883 by M. Leon Thevenin (1857–1926), a French tele-
graph engineer.

Replacing a linear two-terminal circuit  
by its Thevenin equivalent: (a) original 
circuit, (b) the Thevenin equivalent  
circuit.
Thevenin’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be re-
placed by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source VTh in series 
with a resistor RTh, where VTh is the open-circuit voltage at the terminals 
and RTh is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the 
independent sources are turned off.
The proof of the theorem will be gi
ven later, in Section 4.7. Our 
major concern right now is how to find the Thevenin equivalent voltage 
VTh and resistance RTh. To do so, suppose the tw o circuits in  Fig. 4.23 
are equivalent. Two circuits are said to be equivalent if the y have the 
same voltage-current relation at their terminals. Let us find out what will 
make the tw o circuits in Fig. 4.23 equi valent. If the terminals a-b are 
made open-circuited (by remo ving the load), no current flows, so that 
the open-circuit voltage across the terminals a-b in Fig. 4.23(a) must be 
equal to the voltage source VTh in Fig. 4.23(b), since the two circuits are 
equivalent. Thus, VTh is the open-circuit v oltage across the terminals as 
shown in Fig. 4.24(a); that is,
 
VTh = voc

Again, with the load disconnected and terminals 
a-b open-
cir cuited, we turn of f all independent sources. The input resistance 
(or equi valent resistance) of the dead circuit at the terminals a-b in 
Fig. 4.23(a) must be equal to RTh in Fig. 4.23(b) because the two circuits 
are equivalent. Thus, RTh is the input resistance at the terminals when 
the independent sources are turned off, as shown in Fig. 4.24(b); that is,
 
RTh = Rin 
(4.7)

138 
Chapter 4
Circuit Theorems
To apply this idea in finding the Thevenin resistance RTh, we need to 
consider two cases.
■ CASE 1  If the network has no dependent sources, we turn of f all 
independent sources. RTh is the input resistance of the netw ork looking 
between terminals a and b, as shown in Fig. 4.24(b). 
■ CASE 2  If the network has dependent sources, we turn off all in-
dependent sources. As with superposition, dependent sources are not to 
be turned off because they are controlled by circuit variables. We apply a 
voltage source vo at terminals a and b and determine the resulting current 
io. Then RTh = vo∕io, as shown in Fig. 4.25(a). Alternatively, we may in-
sert a current source io at terminals a-b as shown in Fig. 4.25(b) and find 
the terminal voltage vo. Again RTh = vo∕io. Either of the two approaches 
will give the same result. In either approach we may assume an y value 
of vo and io. For example, we may use vo = 1 V or io = 1 A, or even use 
unspecified values of vo or io.
It often occurs that RTh tak es a ne gative v alue. In this case, the  
negative resistance (v = −iR) implies that the circuit is supplying power. 
This is possible in a circuit with dependent sources; Example 4.10 will 
illustrate this.
Thevenin’s theorem is v ery important in circuit analysis. It helps 
simplify a circuit. A large circuit may be replaced by a single indepen -
dent voltage source and a single resistor. This replacement technique is a 
powerful tool in circuit design.
As mentioned earlier, a linear circuit with a variable load can be re-
placed by the Thevenin equivalent, exclusive of the load. The equivalent 
network behaves the same w ay externally as the original circuit. Con -
sider a linear circuit terminated by a load RL, as shown in Fig. 4.26(a). 
The current IL through the load and the voltage VL across the load are eas-
ily determined once the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit at the load’ s 
terminals is obtained, as sho wn in Fig. 4.26(b). From  Fig. 4.26(b), we 
obtain

Find the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.31 at terminals a-b.
Solution:
This circuit contains a dependent source, unlik e the circuit in the pre -
vious example. To find RTh, we set the independent source equal to
 
zero but leave the dependent source alone. Because of the presence
 
of the dependent source, ho wever, we excite the netw ork with a v olt-
age source vo connected to the terminals as indicated in Fig. 4.32(a). 
We may set vo = 1 V to ease calculation, since the circuit is linear
. 
Our goal is to find the current io through the terminals, and then obtain  
RTh = 1∕io. (Alternatively, we may insert a 1-A current source, find the 
corresponding voltage vo, and obtain RTh = vo∕1.)

Solving these equations gives
i3 = − 1 
__ 6   A
But io = −i3 = 1∕6 A. Hence,

io

To get VTh, we find voc in the circuit of Fig. 4.32(b). Applying mesh

−2vx + 2(i3 − i2) = 0  
⇒  vx = i3 − i2

4(i2 − i1) + 2(i2 − i3) + 6i2 = 0
or
 
12i2 − 4i1 − 2i3 = 0 
(4.9.6)
But 4(i1 − i2) = vx. Solving these equations leads to i2 = 10∕3. Hence,
VTh = voc = 6i2 = 20 V

Find the Thevenin equivalent circuit of the circuit in Fig. 4.34 to the left 
of the terminals.
Answer: VTh = 5.333 V, RTh = 444.4 mΩ.
Example 4.10
Determine the Thevenin equi valent of the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) at 
terminals a-b.
Solution:
1. Define. The problem is clearly defined; we are to determine the 
Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35(a).
2. Present. The circuit contains a 2-Ω resistor in parallel with a 
4-Ω resistor. These are, in turn, in parallel with a dependent cur-
rent source. It is important to note that there are no independent 
sources.
3. Alternative. The first thing to consider is that, since we have no 
independent sources in this circuit, we must excite the circuit exter-
nally. In addition, when you have no independent sources the value 
for VTh will be equal to zero so you will only have to find RTh.

Chapter 4
Circuit Theorems
The simplest approach is to excite the circuit with either a 1-V 
voltage source or a 1-A current source. Because we will end up 
with an equivalent resistance (either positive or negative), I prefer 
to use the current source and nodal analysis which will yield a 
voltage at the output terminals equal to the resistance (with 1 A 
flowing in, vo is equal to 1 times the equivalent resistance).
 
As an alternative, the circuit could also be excited by a 1-V 
voltage source and mesh analysis could be used to find the equiva-
lent resistance.
4. Attempt. We start by writing the nodal equation at a in Fig. 4.35(b) 
assuming io = 1 A.
 
2ix + (vo − 0)∕4 + (vo − 0)∕2 + (−1) = 0 
(4.10.1)
Given that we have two unknowns and only one equation, we will 
need a constraint equation.
 
ix = (0 − vo)∕2 = −vo ∕2 
(4.10.2)
Substituting Eq. (4.10.2) into Eq. (4.10.1) yields
2(−vo ∕2) + (vo − 0)∕4 + (vo − 0)∕2 + (−1) = 0
= (−1 +  1 _ 
4  +  1 _ 
2  )vo − 1   
or   
vo = −4 V
Since vo = 1 × RTh, then RTh = vo ∕1 = −4 Ω.
 
The negative value of the resistance tells us that, accord-
ing to the passive sign convention, the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) is 
supplying power. Of course, the resistors in Fig. 4.35(a) cannot 
supply power (they absorb power); it is the dependent source that 
supplies the power. This is an example of how a dependent source 
and resistors could be used to simulate negative resistance.
5. Evaluate. First of all, we note that the answer has a negative value. 
We know this is not possible in a passive circuit, but in this circuit 
we do have an active device (the dependent current source). Thus, 
the equivalent circuit is essentially an active circuit that can supply 
power.
 
Now we must evaluate the solution. The best way to do this 
is to perform a check, using a different approach, and see if we 
obtain the same solution. Let us try connecting a 9-Ω resistor in 
series with a 10-V voltage source across the output terminals of 
the original circuit and then the Thevenin equivalent. To make the 
circuit easier to solve, we can take and change the parallel current 
source and 4-Ω resistor to a series voltage source and 4-Ω resistor 
by using source transformation. This, with the new load, gives us 
the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35(c).
 
We can now write two mesh equations.
8ix + 4i1 + 2(i1 − i2) = 0
2(i2 − i1) + 9i2 + 10 = 0
Note, we only have two equations but have three unknowns, so we 
need a constraint equation. We can use
ix = i2 − i1

This leads to a new equation for loop 1. Simplifying leads to

or

or  
i1 = 3i2
−2i1 + 11i2 = −10
Substituting the first equation into the second gives
−6i2 + 11i2 = −10  
or  
i2 = −10∕5 = −2 A
Using the Thevenin equivalent is quite easy since we have only one 
loop, as shown in Fig. 4.35(d).
−4i + 9i + 10 = 0  
or  
i = −10∕5 = −2 A
5. Satisfactory? Clearly we have found the value of the equivalent 
circuit as required by the problem statement. Checking does vali-
date that solution (we compared the answer we obtained by using 
the equivalent circuit with one obtained by using the load with  
the original circuit). We can present all this as a solution to the 
problem.

 Norton’s Theorem
In 1926, about 43 years after Thevenin published his theorem, E. L. Norton, 
an American engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, proposed a similar 
theorem.
Norton’s theorem states that a linear two-terminal circuit can be re-
placed by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source IN in parallel 
with a resistor RN, where IN is the short-circuit current through the termi-
nals and RN is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the 
independent sources are turned off.
Thus, the circuit in Fig. 4.37(a) can be replaced by the one in Fig. 4.37(b).
The proof of Norton’ s theorem will be gi ven in the ne xt section. 
For now, we are mainly concerned with how to get RN and IN. We find 
RN in the same w ay we find RTh. In f act, from what we kno w about 
source transformation, the Thevenin and Norton resistances are equal; 
that is,
 
 RN = RTh 
(4.9)
To find the Norton current IN, we determine the short-circuit current 
flowing from terminal a to b in both circuits in Fig. 4.37. It is e vident

that the short-circuit current in Fig. 4.37(b) is IN. This must be the same 
short-circuit current from terminal a to b in Fig. 4.37(a), since the tw o 
circuits are equivalent. Thus,
 
IN = isc 
(4.10)
shown in Fig. 4.38. Dependent and independent sources are treated the 
same way as in Thevenin’s theorem.
Observe the close relationship between Norton’
s and Thevenin’s 
theorems: RN = RTh as in Eq. (4.9), and
 
IN =   VTh  
____ 
RTh
   
(4.11)
This is essentially source transformation. F or this reason, source trans -
formation is often called Thevenin-Norton transformation.
Since VTh, IN, and RTh are related according to Eq. (4.11), to deter -
mine the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit requires that we find:
• The open-circuit voltage voc across terminals a and b.
• The short-circuit current isc at terminals a and b.
• The equivalent or input resistance Rin at terminals a and b when all 
independent sources are turned off.
We can calculate an y two of the three using the method that tak es the 
least effort and use them to get the third using Ohm’s law. Example 4.11 
will illustrate this. Also, since
 
VTh = voc

IN = isc

___

the open-circuit and short-circuit tests are sufficient to find any Thevenin 
or Norton equivalent, of a circuit which contains at least one independent 
source.

Solution:
We find RN in the same way we find RTh in the Thevenin equivalent cir-
cuit. Set the independent sources equal to zero. This leads to the circuit 
in Fig. 4.40(a), from which we find RN. Thus,
RN = 5 ∥ (8 + 4 + 8) = 5 ∥ 20 =   20 × 5

To find IN, we short-circuit terminals a and b, as shown in Fig. 4.40(b).

mesh analysis, we obtain
i1 = 2 A,  
20i2 − 4i1 − 12 = 0
From these equations, we obtain

Solution:
To find RN, we set the independent voltage source equal to zero and con-
nect a voltage source of vo = 1 V (or any unspecified voltage vo) to the 
terminals. We obtain the circuit in Fig. 4.44(a). We ignore the 4-Ω resis-
tor because it is short-circuited. Also due to the short circuit, the 5- Ω 
resistor, the voltage source, and the dependent current source are all in 
parallel. Hence, ix = 0. At node a, io =  1 V

10-V voltage source, the 5-Ω resistor, and the dependent current source 
are all in parallel. Hence,

Thus,

 Derivations of Thevenin’s and  
Norton’s Theorems
In this section, we will pro ve Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems using 
the superposition principle.
Consider the linear circuit in Fig. 4.46(a). It is assumed that the cir-
cuit contains resistors and dependent and independent sources. We have 
access to the circuit via terminals a and b, through which current from 
an external source is applied. Our objective is to ensure that the voltage-
current relation at terminals a and b is identical to that of the Thevenin 
equivalent in Fig. 4.46(b). F or the sak e of simplicity , suppose the lin -
ear circuit in Fig. 4.46(a) contains tw o independent voltage sources vs1
and vs2 and two independent current sources is1 and is2. We may obtain 
any circuit variable, such as the terminal v oltage v, by applying super -
position. That is, we consider the contrib ution due to each independent 
source including the e xternal source i. By superposition, the terminal 
voltage v is
 
v = A0i + A1vs1 + A2vs2 + A3is1 + A4is2 
(4.13)
where A0, A1, A2, A3, and A4 are constants. Each term on the right-hand 
side of Eq. (4.13) is the contrib ution of the related independent source; 
that is, A0i is the contrib ution to v due to the e xternal current source i, 
A1vs1 is the contribution due to the voltage source vs1, and so on. We may 
collect terms for the internal independent sources together as B0, so that 
Eq. (4.13) becomes
 
v = A0i + B0 
(4.14)
where B0 = A1vs1 + A2vs2 + A3is1 + A4is2. We now want to evaluate the 
values of constants A0 and B0. When the terminals a and b are open-
circuited, i = 0 and v = B0. Thus, B0 is the open-circuit voltage voc, which 
is the same as VTh, so
 
B0 = VTh 
(4.15)
When all the internal sources are turned off, B0 = 0. The circuit can then 
be replaced by an equivalent resistance Req, which is the same as RTh, and 
Eq. (4.14) becomes
 
v = A0i = RThi  
⇒  A0 = RTh 
(4.16)
Substituting the values of A0 and B0 in Eq. (4.14) gives
 
v = RThi + VTh 
(4.17)
which expresses the voltage-current relation at terminals a and b of the 
circuit in Fig. 4.46(b). Thus, the two circuits in Fig. 4.46(a) and 4.46(b) 
are equivalent.
When the same linear circuit is dri
ven by a v oltage source v as 
shown in Fig. 4.47(a), the current flowing into the circuit can be obtained 
by superposition as
 
i = C0v + D0 
(4.18)
where C0v is the contrib ution to i due to the e xternal voltage source v 
and D0 contains the contrib utions to i due to all internal independent 
sources. When the terminals a-b are short-circuited, v = 0 so that

f, D0 = 0 and

4.47(b) are equivalent.
4.8
 Maximum Power Transfer
In many practical situations, a circuit is designed to provide power to a 
load. There are applications in areas such as communications where it 
is desirable to maximize the power delivered to a load. We now address 
the problem of deli vering the maximum po wer to a load when gi ven a 
system with known internal losses. It should be noted that this will result 
in significant internal losses greater than or equal to the power delivered 
to the load.
The Thevenin equivalent is useful in finding the maximum power a 
linear circuit can deliver to a load. We assume that we can adjust the load 
resistance RL. If the entire circuit is replaced by its Thevenin equivalent 
except for the load, as shown in Fig. 4.48, the power delivered to the 
load is
 
p = i2RL =  ( 
VTh 
________

 RL 
(4.21)
For a given circuit, VTh and RTh are fixed. By varying the load resis-
tance RL, the power delivered to the load varies as sketched in Fig. 4.49. 
We notice from Fig. 4.49 that the power is small for small or large values 
of RL but maximum for some value of RL between 0 and ∞. We now want 
to show that this maximum power occurs when RL is equal to RTh. This is 
known as the maximum power theorem.

This implies that

(4.22)
which yields
 
RL = RTh 
(4.23)
showing that the maximum power transfer takes place when the load 
resistance RL equals the Thevenin resistance RTh. We can readily confirm 
that Eq. (4.23) gives the maximum power by showing that d2p∕dR2

 Verifying Circuit Theorems with PSpice
In this section, we learn how to use PSpice to verify the theorems covered 
in this chapter. Specifically, we will consider using DC Sweep analysis to 
find the Thevenin or Norton equi valent at an y pair of nodes in a circuit  
and the maximum po wer transfer to a load. The reader is advised to read  
Section D.3 of Appendix D in preparation for this section.
To find the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit at a pair of open termi-
nals using PSpice, we use the schematic editor to dra w the circuit and 
insert an independent probing current source, say , Ip, at the terminals. 
The probing current source must have a part name ISRC. We then per-
form a DC Sweep on Ip, as discussed in Section D.3. Typically, we may 
let the current through Ip vary from 0 to 1 A in 0.1-A increments. After 
saving and simulating the circuit, we use Probe to display a plot of the 
voltage across Ip versus the current through Ip. The zero intercept of the 
plot gives us the Thevenin equivalent voltage, while the slope of the plot 
is equal to the Thevenin resistance.
To find the Norton equivalent involves similar steps except that we 
insert a probing independent v oltage source (with a part name VSRC), 
say, Vp, at the terminals. We perform a DC Sweep on Vp and let Vp 
vary from 0 to 1 V in 0.1-V increments. A plot of the current through 
Vp versus the voltage across Vp is obtained using the Probe menu after 
simulation. The zero intercept is equal to the Norton current, while the 
slope of the plot is equal to the Norton conductance.

To get VTh, we consider the circuit in Fig. 4.51(b). Applying mesh analy-
sis gives

Solving for i1, we get i1 = −2∕3. Applying KVL around the outer loop to 
get VTh across terminals a-b, we obtain
−12 + 6i1 + 3i2 + 2(0) + VTh = 0  
⇒  VTh = 22 V

Verifying Circuit Theorems with PSpice

Consider the circuit in Fig. 4.31 (see Example 4.9). Use PSpice to find 
the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits.
Solution:
(a) To find the Thevenin resistance RTh and Thevenin voltage VTh at the 
terminals a-b in the circuit in Fig. 4.31, we first use Schematics to draw 
the circuit as shown in Fig. 4.53(a). Notice that a probing current source 
I2 is inserted at the terminals. Under

Example 4.15
Refer to the circuit in Fig. 4.55. Use PSpice to find the maximum power 
transfer to RL.
Solution:
We need to perform a DC Sweep on RL to determine when the po wer 
across it is maximum. We first draw the circuit using Schematics as 
shown in Fig. 4.56. Once the circuit is dra
wn, we tak e the follo wing 
three steps to further prepare the circuit for a DC Sweep.
The first step involves defining the value of RL as a parameter, since 
we want to vary it. To do this:
1. DCLICKL the value 1k of R2 (representing RL) to open up the Set 
Attribute Value dialog box.
2. Replace 1k with {RL} and click OK to accept the change.
Note that the curly brackets are necessary.
 
The second step is to define parameter. To achieve this:
1. Select Draw∕Get New Part∕Libraries ⋯∕special.slb.
2. Type PARAM in the PartName box and click OK.
3. DRAG the box to any position near the circuit.
4. CLICKL to end placement mode.
5. DCLICKL to open up the PartName: PARAM dialog box.
6. CLICKL on NAME1 = and enter RL (with no curly brackets) in the 
Value box, and CLICKL Save Attr to accept change.
7. CLICKL on VALUE1 = and enter 2k in the Value box, and CLICKL 
Save Attr to accept change.
8. Click OK.

The value 2k in item 7 is necessary for a bias point calculation; it
cannot be left blank.
The third step is to set up the DC Sweep to sweep the parameter.
To do this:
1. Select Analysis∕Setput to bring up the DC Sweep dialog box.
2. For the Sweep Type, select Linear (or Octave for a wide range of RL).
3. For the Sweep Var. Type, select Global Parameter.
4. Under the Name box, enter RL.
5. In the Start Value box, enter 100.
6. In the End Value box, enter 5k.
7. In the Increment box, enter 100.
8. Click OK and Close to accept the parameters.
After taking these steps and sa
ving the circuit, we are ready to 
simulate. Select Analysis/Simulate. If there are no errors, we select 
Add Trace in the PSpice A/D windo w and type −V(R2:2)∗I(R2) in 
the Trace Command box. [The ne gative sign is needed since I(R2) is  
negative.] This gives the plot of the power delivered to RL as RL varies 
from 100 Ω to 5 k Ω. We can also obtain the power absorbed by RL by 
typing V(R2:2)∗ V(R2:2)/RL in the Trace Command box. Either way, we 
obtain the plot in Fig. 4.57. It is evident from the plot that the maximum 
power is 250 μW. Notice that the maximum occurs when RL = 1 kΩ, as 
expected analytically.

 Applications
In this section we will discuss tw o important practical applications of 
the concepts co vered in this chapter: source modeling and resistance 
measurement.
4.10.1  Source Modeling
Source modeling provides an example of the usefulness of the Thevenin 
or the Norton equivalent. An active source such as a battery is often char-
acterized by its Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit. An ideal voltage 
source provides a constant v oltage irrespective of the current dra wn by 
the load, while an ideal current source supplies a constant current regard-
less of the load voltage. As Fig. 4.58 shows, practical voltage and current 
sources are not ideal, due to their internal resistances or source resis-
tances Rs and Rp. They become ideal as Rs → 0 and Rp → ∞. To show 
that this is the case, consider the effect of the load on voltage sources, 
vs

as shown in Fig. 4.59(a). By the voltage division principle, the load volt-
age is
vL =

_______ 
Rs + RL
  vs 
(4.25)
As RL increases, the load v oltage approaches a source v oltage vs, as  
illustrated in Fig. 4.59(b). From Eq. (4.25), we should note that:
1. The load v oltage will be constant if the internal resistance 
Rs 
of the source is zero or , at least, Rs ≪ RL. In other w ords, the 
smaller Rs is compared with RL, the closer the v oltage source is 
to being ideal.

(a) Practical voltage source connected to a load RL, (b) load volt-
age decreases as RL decreases.
2. When the load is disconnected (i.e., the source is open-circuited so 
that RL → ∞), voc = vs. Thus, vs may be re garded as the unloaded 
source voltage. The connection of the load causes the terminal volt-
age to drop in magnitude; this is known as the loading effect.
The same argument can be made for a practical current source when 
connected to a load as sho wn in Fig. 4.60(a). By the current di
vision 
principle,
 
iL =  
Rp 
_______ 
Rp + RL
  is 
(4.26)
Figure 4.60(b) shows the variation in the load current as the load resis -
tance increases. Again, we notice a drop in current due to the load (load-
ing effect), and load current is constant (ideal current source) when the 
internal resistance is very large (i.e., Rp → ∞ or, at least, Rp ≫ RL).
Sometimes, we need to know the unloaded source voltage vs and the 
internal resistance Rs of a v oltage source. To find vs and Rs, we follow 
the procedure illustrated in Fig. 4.61. First, we measure the open-circuit 
voltage voc as in Fig. 4.61(a) and set
 
vs = voc 
(4.27)
Then, we connect a v
ariable load RL across the terminals as in 
 
Fig. 4.61(b). We adjust the resistance RL until we measure a load volt-
age of exactly one-half of the open-circuit voltage, vL = voc∕2, be-
cause now RL = RTh = Rs. At that point, we disconnect RL and measure 
it. We set
 
Rs = RL 
(4.28)
For example, a car battery may have vs = 12 V and Rs = 0.05 Ω.

The terminal v oltage of a v oltage source is 12 V when connected to a

12.4 V. (a) Calculate the source v oltage vs and internal resistance Rs. 
(b) Determine the voltage when an 8-Ω load is connected to the source.
Solution:
(a) We replace the source by its Thevenin equivalent. The terminal volt-
age when the load is disconnected is the open-circuit voltage,
vs = voc = 12.4 V
When the load is connected, as shown in Fig. 4.62(a), vL = 12 V and  
pL = 2 W. Hence,

(b) Now that we have the Thevenin equivalent of the source, we connect 
the 8-Ω load across the Thevenin equivalent as shown in Fig. 4.62(b). 
Using voltage division, we obtain
v =   8

4.10.2  Resistance Measurement
Although the ohmmeter method pro
vides the simplest w ay to mea -
sure resistance, more accurate measurement may be obtained using the 
Wheatstone bridge. While ohmmeters are designed to measure resis-
tance in low, mid, or high range, a Wheatstone bridge is used to mea sure 
resistance in the mid range, say, between 1 Ω and 1 MΩ. Very low values 
of resistances are measured with a milliohmmeter, while very high values 
are measured with a Megger tester.
The Wheatstone bridge (or resistance bridge) circuit is used in a 
number of applications. Here we will use it to measure an unkno
wn 
resistance. The unkno wn resistance Rx is connected to the bridge as 
shown in Fig. 4.63. The variable resistance is adjusted until no current 
flows through the galvanometer, which is essentially a d’Arsonval move-
ment operating as a sensitive current-indicating device like an ammeter 
in the microamp range. Under this condition v1 = v2, and the bridge is 
said to be balanced. Since no current flows through the galvanometer, R1
and R2 behave as though the y were in series; so do R3 and Rx. The fact 
that no current flows through the galvanometer also implies that v1 = v2. 
Applying the voltage division principle,
v1 =   R2 
_______ 
R1 + R2
   v = v2 =  
Rx 
_______ 
R3 + Rx
  v 
(4.29)
Hence, no current flows through the galvanometer when
 
R2 
_______ 
R1 + R2
  =  
Rx 
_______ 
R3 + Rx
   
⇒  R2R3 = R1Rx
or
 
Rx =   R3 
___ 
R1
   R2 
(4.30)
If R1 = R3, and R2 is adjusted until no current flows through the galva-
nometer, then Rx = R2.
How do we find the current through the galvanometer when the 
Wheatstone bridge is unbalanced? We find the Thevenin equivalent (VTh 
and RTh) with respect to the g alvanometer terminals. If Rm is the resis -
tance of the g alvanometer, the current through it under the unbalanced 
condition is
 
I =  
VTh 
________ 
RTh + Rm
  
(4.31)
Example 4.18 will illustrate this.

Example 4.17

Solution:
We first need to replace the circuit by its Thevenin equivalent at ter -
minals a and b. The Thevenin resistance is found using the circuit in 
Fig. 4.65(a). Notice that the 3-kΩ and 1-KΩ resistors are in parallel; so 
are the 400 and 600- Ω resistors. The two parallel combinations form a 
series combination with respect to terminals a and b. Hence,
            RTh = 3000 ∥ 1000 + 400 ∥ 600
      =   3000 × 1000 
___________  
3000 + 1000   +  400 × 600 
_________ 
400 + 600   = 750 + 240 = 990 Ω
To find the Thevenin voltage, we consider the circuit in Fig. 4.65(b).  
Using the voltage division principle gives
v1 =   
1000 
___________  
1000 + 3000   (220) = 55 V,    
 v2 =   
600 
_________ 
600 + 400   (220) = 132 V
Applying KVL around loop ab gives
−v1 + VTh + v2 = 0  
or  
VTh = v1 − v2 = 55 − 132 = −77 V
Having determined the Thevenin equivalent, we find the current through 
the galvanometer using Fig. 4.65(c).
IG =  
VTh 
________ 
RTh + Rm
  =   −77 
________ 
990 + 40   = −74.76 mA
The negative sign indicates that the current flows in the direction oppo-
site to the one assumed, that is, from terminal b to terminal a.

 Summary
1. A linear netw ork consists of linear elements, linear dependent 
sources, and linear independent sources.
2. Network theorems are used to reduce a complex circuit to a simpler 
one, thereby making circuit analysis much simpler.
3. The superposition principle states that for a circuit ha ving multiple 
independent sources, the voltage across (or current through) an ele-
ment is equal to the algebraic sum of all the individual voltages (or 
currents) due to each independent source acting one at a time.
4. Source transformation is a procedure for transforming a v
oltage 
source in series with a resistor to a current source in parallel with a 
resistor, or vice versa.
5. Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems allow us to isolate a portion of a 
network while the remaining portion of the netw ork is replaced by 
an equivalent network. The Thevenin equivalent consists of a v olt-
age source VTh in series with a resistor RTh, while the Norton equiva-
lent consists of a current source IN in parallel with a resistor RN. The 
two theorems are related by source transformation.

of the source is measured to be 9.975 mA when an 
ammeter with an internal resistance of 20 Ω is used.
(a)  If adding a 2-kΩ resistor across the source  
terminals causes the ammeter reading to fall to 
9.876 mA, calculate Is and Rs.
(b)  What will the ammeter reading be if the  
resistance between the source terminals is 
changed to 4 kΩ?
4.88 Consider the circuit in Fig. 4.144. An ammeter with 
internal resistance Ri is inserted between A and B to 
measure Io. Determine the reading of the ammeter if: 
(a) Ri = 500 Ω, (b) Ri = 0 Ω. (Hint: Find the  
Thevenin equivalent circuit at terminals a-b.)
4.90 The Wheatstone bridge circuit shown in Fig. 4.146 is 
used to measure the resistance of a strain gauge. The 
adjustable resistor has a linear taper with a maximum 
value of 100 Ω. If the resistance of the strain gauge 
is found to be 42.6 Ω, what fraction of the full slider 
travel is the slider when the bridge is balanced?

Career in Electronic Instrumentation
Engineering involves applying physical principles to design devices for 
the benefit of humanity. But ph ysical principles cannot be understood 
without measurement. In f act, physicists often say that ph ysics is the 
science that measures reality. Just as measurements are a tool for under-
standing the physical world, instruments are tools for measurement. The 
operational amplifier introduced in this chapter is a building block of 
modern electronic instrumentation. Therefore, mastery of operational 
amplifier fundamentals is paramount to any practical application of 
 electronic circuits.
Electronic instruments are used in all fields of science and engineer-
ing. They have proliferated in science and technology to the e xtent that 
it would be ridiculous to have a scientific or technical education without 
exposure to electronic instruments. For example, physicists, physiolo-
gists, chemists, and biologists must learn to use electronic instruments. 
For electrical engineering students in particular, the skill in operating 
digital and analog electronic instruments is crucial. Such instruments 
include ammeters, v
oltmeters, ohmmeters, oscilloscopes, spectrum 
 analyzers, and signal generators.
Beyond developing the skill for operating the instruments, some 
electrical engineers specialize in designing and constructing electronic 
instruments. These engineers deri ve pleasure in b uilding their o wn in-
struments. Most of them invent and patent their inventions. Specialists 
in electronic instruments find employment in medical schools, hospitals, 
research laboratories, aircraft industries, and thousands of other indus -
tries where electronic instruments are routinely used.

Chapter 5  Operational Amplifiers 
5.1
 Introduction
Having learned the basic laws and theorems for circuit analysis, we are 
now ready to study an acti ve circuit element of paramount importance: 
the operational amplifier, or op amp for short. The op amp is a versatile 
circuit building block.
Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Comprehend how real operational amplifiers (op amps)  function.
2. Understand that ideal op amps function nearly identically to 
real ones and that they can be used to model them effectively 
in a variety of circuit applications.
3. Realize how the basic inverting op amp is the workhorse of the 
op amp family.
4. Use the inverting op amp to create summers.
5. Use the op amp to create a difference amplifier.
6. Explain how to cascade a variety of op amp circuits.
It can also be used in making a v
oltage- or current -controlled current 
source. An op amp can sum signals, amplify a signal, inte grate it, or 
differentiate it. The ability of the op amp to perform these mathematical 
operations is the reason it is called an operational amplifier. It is also the 
reason for the widespread use of op amps in analog design. Op amps are 
popular in practical circuit designs because the y are versatile, inexpen-
sive, easy to use, and fun to work with.
We begin by discussing the ideal op amp and later consider the non-
ideal op amp. Using nodal analysis as a tool, we consider ideal op amp 
circuits such as the in verter, voltage follower, summer, and dif ference 
amplifier. We will also analyze op amp circuits with PSpice. Finally, we 
learn how an op amp is used in digital-to-analog converters and instru-
mentation amplifiers.
5.2
 Operational Amplifiers
An operational amplifier is designed so that it performs some mathemati-
cal operations when external components, such as resistors and capaci -
tors, are connected to its terminals. Thus, 
The term operational amplifier was 
introduced in 1947 by John Ragazzini 
and his colleagues, in their work on 
analog computers for the National 
 Defense Research Council after World 
War II. The first op amps used vacuum 
tubes rather than transistors.
An op amp may also be regarded as a 
voltage amplifier with very high gain.
The op amp is an electronic device consisting of a complex arrange-
ment of resistors, transistors, capacitors, and diodes. A full discussion of 
what is inside the op amp is beyond the scope of this book. It will suffice 
The op amp is an electronic unit that behaves like a voltage-controlled 
voltage source.
An op amp is an active circuit element designed to perform mathemati-
cal operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differen-
tiation, and integration.

to treat the op amp as a circuit b
uilding block and simply study what 
takes place at its terminals.
Op amps are commercially a vailable in integrated circuit packages 
in several forms. Figure 5.1 sho ws a typical op amp package. A typical 
one is the eight-pin dual in-line package (or DIP), shown in Fig. 5.2(a). 
Pin or terminal 8 is unused, and terminals 1 and 5 are of little concern to 
us. The five important terminals are:
1. The inverting input, pin 2.
2. The noninverting input, pin 3.
3. The output, pin 6.
4. The positive power supply V+, pin 7.
5. The negative power supply V −, pin 4.
The circuit symbol for the op amp is the triangle in Fig. 5.2(b); as shown, 
the op amp has tw o inputs and one output. The inputs are marked with 
minus (−) and plus (+) to specify inverting and noninverting inputs, re-
spectively. An input applied to the noninverting terminal will appear with 
the same polarity at the output, while an input applied to the in
verting 
terminal will appear inverted at the output.
As an active element, the op amp must be powered by a voltage sup-
ply as typically shown in Fig. 5.3. Although the power supplies are often 
ignored in op amp circuit diagrams for the sake of simplicity, the power 
supply currents must not be overlooked. By KCL,
io = i1 + i2 + i+ + i− 
(5.1)
 
The equivalent circuit model of an op amp is shown in Fig. 5.4. The 
output section consists of a v oltage-controlled source in series with the

 Chapter 14.
A dB = 20 log10 A
output resistance Ro. It is evident from Fig. 5.4 that the input resis tance 
Ri is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen at the input terminals, while 
the output resistance Ro is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen at the 
output. The differential input voltage vd is given by
 
vd = v2 − v1 
(5.2)
where v1 is the voltage between the inverting terminal and ground and v2
is the voltage between the noninverting terminal and ground. The op amp 
senses the difference between the two inputs, multiplies it by the gain A, 
and causes the resulting voltage to appear at the output. Thus, the output 
vo is given by
 
vo = Avd = A(v2 − v1)
 
(5.3)
A is called the open-loop voltage gain because it is the g ain of the op 
amp without any external feedback from output to input. Table 5.1 shows 
typical values of voltage gain A, input resistance Ri, output resistance Ro, 
and supply voltage VCC.
The concept of feedback is crucial to our understanding of op amp 
circuits. A negative feedback is achieved when the output is fed back to 
the inverting terminal of the op amp. As Example 5.1 shows, when there 
is a feedback path from output to input, the ratio of the output voltage to 
the input voltage is called the closed-loop gain. As a result of the nega-
tive feedback, it can be shown that the closed-loop gain is almost insensi-
tive to the open-loop gain A of the op amp. For this reason, op amps are 
used in circuits with feedback paths.
A practical limitation of the op amp is that the magnitude of its 
output voltage cannot e xceed |VCC|. In other w ords, the output v oltage 
is dependent on and is limited by the po wer supply voltage. Figure 5.5 
illustrates that the op amp can operate in three modes, depending on the 
differential input voltage vd:
1. Positive saturation, vo = VCC.
2. Linear region, −VCC ≤ vo = Avd ≤ VCC.
3. Negative saturation, vo = −VCC.
If we attempt to increase vd beyond the linear range, the op amp becomes 
saturated and yields vo = VCC or vo = −VCC. Throughout this book, we 
will assume that our op amps operate in the linear mode. This means that 
the output voltage is restricted by
 
−VCC ≤ vo ≤ VCC

A 741 op amp has an open-loop voltage gain of 2 × 105, input resis tance

For Example 5.1: (a) original circuit, (b) the equivalent circuit.
Although we shall al ways operate the op amp in the linear re gion, the 
possibility of saturation must be borne in mind when one designs with 
op amps, to a void designing op amp circuits that will not w ork in the 
laboratory.
Throughout this book, we assume that 
an op amp operates in the linear range. 
Keep in mind the voltage constraint on 
the op amp in this mode.
Solution:
Using the op amp model in Fig. 5.4, we obtain the equivalent circuit of 
Fig. 5.6(a) as shown in Fig. 5.6(b). We now solve the circuit in Fig. 5.6(b) 
by using nodal analysis. At node 1, KCL gives

10 × 103  =  
v1 
__________ 
2000 × 103  +  v1 − vo

Multiplying through by 2000 × 103, we obtain
200vs = 301v1 − 100vo
or
 
2vs ≃ 3v1 − vo  ⇒ v1 =  2vs + vo

But vd = −v1 and A = 200,000. Then
 
v1 − vo = 400(vo + 200,000v1) 
(5.1.2)
Substituting v1 from Eq. (5.1.1) into Eq. (5.1.2) gives
0 ≃ 26,667,067vo + 53,333,333vs  ⇒  vo 
__ 
vs  = −1.9999699
This is closed -loop gain, because the 20 -kΩ feedback resistor closes 
the loop between the output and input terminals. When 
vs = 2 V, vo = 
−3.9999398 V. From Eq. (5.1.1), we obtain v1 = 20.066667 μV. Thus,
i =  v1 − vo

20 × 103  = 0.19999 mA

If the same 741 op amp in Example 5.1 is used in the circuit of Fig. 5.7, 
calculate the closed-loop gain vo∕vs. Find io when vs = 1 V.
Answer: 9.00041, 657 μA.
Practice Problem 5.1
5.3
 Ideal Op Amp
To facilitate the understanding of op amp circuits, we will assume ideal 
op amps. An op amp is ideal if it has the following characteristics:
1. Infinite open-loop gain, A ≃ ∞.
2. Infinite input resistance, Ri ≃ ∞.
3. Zero output resistance, Ro ≃ 0.
An ideal op amp is an amplifier with infinite open-loop gain, infinite 
input resistance, and zero output resistance.
Although assuming an ideal op amp provides only an approximate 
analysis, most modern amplifiers have such large gains and input im -
pedances that the approximate analysis is a good one. Unless stated 
otherwise, we will assume from now on that every op amp is ideal.
For circuit analysis, the ideal op amp is illustrated in Fig. 5.8, which 
is derived from the nonideal model in Fig. 5.4. Two important properties 
of the ideal op amp are:
1. The currents into both input terminals are zero:
 
i1 = 0, i2 = 0
 
(5.5)
 
This is due to infinite input resistance. An infinite resistance be-
tween the input terminals implies that an open circuit e
xists there 
and current cannot enter the op amp. But the output current is not 
necessarily zero according to Eq. (5.1).
2. The voltage across the input terminals is equal to zero; i.e.,
 
vd = v2 − v1 = 0 
(5.6)
 
or
 
v1 = v2
 
 
(5.7)
 
Thus, an ideal op amp has zero current into its tw o input terminals 
and the v oltage between the tw o input terminals is equal to zero. 
Equations (5.5) and (5.7) are e xtremely important and should be 
regarded as the key handles to analyzing op amp circuits.

The two characteristics can be 
exploited by noting that for voltage 
calculations the input port behaves as 
a short circuit, while for current calcula-
tions the input port behaves as an 
open circuit.
It is evident that working with a nonideal op amp is tedious, as we are
dealing with very large numbers.

Example 5.2
Rework Practice Prob. 5.1 using the ideal op amp model.
Solution:
We may replace the op amp in Fig. 5.7 by its equivalent model in Fig. 5.9 
as we did in Example 5.1. But we do not really need to do this. We just 
need to keep Eqs. (5.5) and (5.7) in mind as we analyze the circuit in 
Fig. 5.7. Thus, the Fig. 5.7 circuit is presented as in Fig. 5.9. Notice that
v2 = vs 
(5.2.1)
Since i1 = 0, the 40 - and 5-kΩ resistors are in series; the same current 
flows through them. v1 is the voltage across the 5 -kΩ resistor. Hence, 
using the voltage division principle,
 
v1 =

(5.2.2)
According to Eq. (5.7),

-
loop gain,
 
vs =  vo

vs  = 9 
(5.2.4)
which is very close to the value of 9.00041 obtained with the nonideal 
model in Practice Prob. 5.1. This shows that negligibly small error re
-
sults from assuming ideal op amp characteristics.

Eq. (5.2.5) produces
 
io = 0.2 + 0.45 = 0.65 mA 
This, again, is close to the value of 0.657 mA obtained in Practice

 Inverting Amplifier
In this and the following sections, we consider some useful op amp cir -
cuits that often serv e as modules for designing more comple x circuits. 
The first of such op amp circuits is the inverting amplifier shown in 
Fig. 5.10. In this circuit, the nonin verting input is grounded, vi is con -
nected to the inverting input through R1, and the feedback resistor Rf is 
connected between the inverting input and output. Our goal is to obtain

(5.9)
The voltage gain is Av = vo∕vi = −Rf∕R1. The designation of the circuit in 
Fig. 5.10 as an inverter arises from the negative sign. Thus,
An inverting amplifier reverses the polarity of the input signal while am-
plifying it.
Notice that the gain is the feedback resistance di vided by the in-
put resistance which means that the gain depends only on the external 
elements connected to the op amp. In view of Eq. (5.9), an equivalent 
circuit for the inverting amplifier is shown in Fig. 5.11. The inverting 
amplifier is used, for example, in a current-to-voltage  converter.
A key feature of the inverting amplifier 
is that both the input signal and the 
feedback are applied at the inverting 
terminal of the op amp.
Note there are two types of gains: The 
one here is the closed-loop voltage 
gain Av, while the op amp itself has an 
open-loop voltage gain A.

But va = vb = 2 V for an ideal op amp, because of the zero voltage drop 
across the input terminals of the op amp. Hence,

 Noninverting Amplifier
Another important application of the op amp is

(5.11)
The voltage gain is Av = vo∕vi = 1 + Rf∕R1, which does not have a nega-
tive sign. Thus, the output has the same polarity as the input.
A noninverting amplifier is an op amp circuit designed to provide a 
 positive voltage gain.
Again we notice that the gain depends only on the external resistors.
Notice that if feedback resistor Rf = 0 (short circuit) or R1 = ∞ (open 
circuit) or both, the gain becomes 1. Under these conditions (Rf = 0 and 
R1 = ∞), the circuit in Fig. 5.16 becomes that shown in Fig. 5.17, which 
is called a voltage follower (or unity gain  amplifier) because the output 
follows the input. Thus, for a voltage follower
 
vo = vi
 
(5.12)
Such a circuit has a ve ry high input impedance and is therefore use -
ful as an intermediate-stage (or buffer) amplifier to isolate one circuit 
from another, as portrayed in Fig. 5.18. The voltage follower mini- 
mizes interaction between the tw o stages and eliminates interstage  
loading.

For the op amp circuit in Fig. 5.19, calculate the output voltage vo.
Solution:
We may solve this in two ways: using superposition and using nodal 
analysis.
■ METHOD 1  Using superposition, we let
vo = vo1 + vo2

where vo1 is due to the 6-V voltage source, and vo2 is due to the 4-V input. 
To get vo1, we set the 4-V source equal to zero. Under this condition, the 
circuit becomes an inverter. Hence Eq. (5.9) gives
vo1 = − 10 
__ 
4  (6) = −15 V
To get vo2, we set the 6 -V source equal to zero. The circuit becomes a 
noninverting amplifier so that Eq. (5.11) applies.
vo2 =  (1 +  10

4  ) 4 = 14 V
Thus,
vo = vo1 + vo2 = −15 + 14 = −1 V

 Summing Amplifier
Besides amplification, the op amp can perform addition and subtraction. 
The addition is performed by the summing amplifier covered in this sec-
tion; the subtraction is performed by the difference amplifier covered in 
the next section.
A summing amplifier is an op amp circuit that combines several inputs 
and produces an output that is the weighted sum of the inputs.
The summing amplifier, shown in Fig. 5.21, is a v ariation of the 
inverting amplifier. It takes advantage of the fact that the inverting con-
figuration can handle many inputs at the same time. We keep in mind

 Difference Amplifier
Difference (or dif ferential) amplifiers are used in various applications 
where there is a need to amplify the dif ference between two input sig-
nals. They are first cousins of the instrumentation amplifier, the most 
useful and popular amplifier, which we will discuss in Section 5.10.
A difference amplifier is a device that amplifies the difference between 
two inputs but rejects any signals common to the two inputs.
Consider the op amp circuit sho wn in Fig. 5.24. Keep in mind that 
zero currents enter the op amp terminals. Applying KCL to node a,

Design 2  If we desire to use more than one op amp, we may cascade 
an inverting amplifier and a two-input inverting summer, as shown in 
Fig. 5.25. For the summer,
 
vo = −va − 5v1 
(5.7.4)
and for the inverter,
 
va = −3v2 
(5.7.5)
Combining Eqs. (5.7.4) and (5.7.5) gives
vo = 3v2 − 5v1
which is the desired result. In Fig. 5.25, we may select R1 = 10 kΩ and 
R3 = 20 kΩ or R1 = R3 = 10 kΩ.

 Cascaded Op Amp Circuits
As we know, op amp circuits are modules or building blocks for design-
ing complex circuits. It is often necessary in practical applications to 
connect op amp circuits in cascade (i.e., head to tail) to achie ve a large 
overall gain. In general, tw o circuits are cascaded when the y are con -
nected in tandem, one behind another in a single file.
A cascade connection is a head-to-tail arrangement of two or more  op 
amp circuits such that the output of one is the input of the next.
When op amp circuits are cascaded, each circuit in the string is 
called a stage; the original input signal is increased by the g ain of the 
individual stage. Op amp circuits have the advantage that they can be 
cascaded without changing their input -output relationships. This is due to 
the fact that each (ideal) op amp circuit has infinite input resistance and 
zero output resistance. Figure 5.28 displays a block diagram represen -
tation of three op amp circuits in cascade. Since the output of one stage 
is the input to the next stage, the overall gain of the cascade connection is 
the product of the gains of the individual op amp circuits, or
A = A1A2A3 
(5.22)
Although the cascade connection does not affect the op amp input-output 
relationships, care must be e xercised in the design of an actual op amp 
circuit to ensure that the load due to the ne xt stage in the cascade does 
not saturate the op amp.
Find vo and io in the circuit in Fig. 5.29.
Example 5.9
Solution:
This circuit consists of two noninverting amplifiers cascaded. At the out-
put of the first op amp,
va =  (1 +  12

At the output of the second op amp,
vo =  (1 +  10

The required current io is the current through the 10-kΩ resistor.

 2. Present. With an input of v1 of 1 V and of v2 of 2 V, determine 
the output voltage of the circuit shown in Figure 5.31. The op amp 
circuit is actually composed of three circuits. The first  circuit acts 
as an amplifier of gain −3(−6 kΩ∕2 kΩ) for v1 and the second 
functions as an amplifier of gain −2(−8 kΩ∕4 kΩ) for v2. The last 
circuit serves as a summer of two different gains for the output of 
the other two circuits.

approach will work quite easily. A second approach would be to 
use PSpice as a confirmation of the math.
4. Attempt. Let the output of the first op amp circuit be designated 
as v11 and the output of the second op amp circuit be designated as 
v22. Then we get
v11 = −3v1 = −3 × 1 = −3 V,
v22 = −2v2 = −2 × 2 = −4 V
  
In the third circuit we have
 
vo = −(10 kΩ∕5 kΩ)v11 + [−(10 kΩ∕15 kΩ)v22]
 
= −2(−3) − (2∕3)(−4)
 
= 6 + 2.667 = 8.667 V
 5. Evaluate. To properly evaluate our solution, we need to identify 
a reasonable check. Here we can easily use PSpice to provide that 
check.
 
  
Now we can simulate this in PSpice. The results are shown in 
Fig. 5.32.
  
We obtain the same results using two entirely  different techniques 
(the first is to treat the op amp circuits as just gains and a summer 
and the second is to use circuit analysis with PSpice). This is a 
very good method of assuring that we have the correct answer.
 6. Satisfactory? We are satisfied we have obtained the asked for 
results. We can now present our work as a solution to the  
problem.

 Op Amp Circuit Analysis with PSpice
PSpice for Windows does not have a model for an ideal op amp, although 
one may create one as a subcircuit using the 
Create Subcircuit line in 
the Tools menu. Rather than creating an ideal op amp, we will use one 
of the four nonideal, commercially a vailable op amps supplied in the 
PSpice library eval.slb. The op amp models have the part names LF411, 
LM111, LM324, and uA741, as shown in Fig. 5.34. Each of them can be 
obtained from Draw/Get New Part/libraries . . . /eval.lib or by simply 
selecting Draw/Get New Part and typing the part name in the  PartName 
dialog box, as usual. Note that each of them requires dc supplies, without 
which the op amp will not work. The dc supplies should be connected as 
shown in Fig. 5.3.

5.9 Op Amp Circuit Analysis with PSpice
193
Use PSpice to solve the op amp circuit for Example 5.1.
Solution:
Using Schematics, we draw the circuit in Fig. 5.6(a) as shown in 
Fig.Á5.35. Notice that the positive terminal of the voltage source vs is 
connected to the inverting terminal (pin 2) via the 10-kΩ resistor, while 
the noninverting terminal (pin 3) is grounded as required in Fig. 5.6(a). 
Also, notice how the op amp is powered; the positive power supply 
terminal V+ (pin 7) is connected to a 15 -V dc voltage source, while  
the negative power supply terminal V− (pin 4) is connected to −15 V.  
Pins 1 and 5 are left floating because they are used for offset null adjust-
ment, which does not concern us in this chapter. Besides adding the dc 
power supplies to the original circuit in Fig. 5.6(a), we have also added 
pseudocomponents VIEWPOINT and IPROBE to respectively measure 
the output voltage vo at pin 6 and the required current 
i through the   
20-kΩ resistor.

 †Applications
The op amp is a fundamental b
uilding block in modern electronic  
instrumentation. It is used e xtensively in man y devices, along with 
resistors and other passi ve elements. Its numerous practical applica -
tions include instrumentation amplifiers, digital-to-analog converters, 
analog computers, level shifters, filters, calibration circuits, inverters, 
summers, integrators, differentiators, subtractors, log arithmic ampli-
fiers, comparators, gyrators, oscillators, rectifiers, regulators, voltage-
to- current con verters, current -to-voltage converters, and clippers. 
Some of these we have already considered. We will consider two more 
applications here: the digital-to-analog converter and the instrumenta-
tion amplifier.
5.10.1  Digital-to-Analog Converter
The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) transforms digital signals into 
analog form. A typical e xample of a four -bit DAC is illustrated in 
Fig. 5.36(a). The four-bit DAC can be realized in many ways. A sim-
ple realization is the binary weighted ladder, shown in Fig. 5.36(b). 
The bits are weights according to the magnitude of their place v
al-
ue, by descending value of Rf∕Rn so that each lesser bit has half the  
weight of the ne xt higher. This is ob viously an in verting summing 
amplifier. The output is related to the inputs as sho wn in Eq. (5.15). 
Thus,
 
−Vo =  Rf

___ 
R2
   V2 +  Rf 
___ 
R3
   V3 +  Rf 
___ 
R4
   V4 
(5.23)
Input V1 is called the most significant bit (MSB), while input V4 is the 
least significant bit (LSB). Each of the four binary inputs V1, .. . , V4 can 
assume only two voltage levels: 0 or 1 V. By using the proper input and 
feedback resistor values, the DAC provides a single output that is pro -
portional to the inputs.

In the op amp circuit of Fig. 5.36(b), let 
Rf = 10 k Ω, R1 = 10 k Ω,  
R2 = 20 kΩ, R3 = 40 kΩ, and R4 = 80 kΩ. Obtain the analog output for 
binary inputs [0000], [0001], [0010], . . . , [1111].
Solution:
Substituting the given values of the input and feedback resistors in 
Eq. (5.23) gives
−Vo =  Rf

Using this equation, a digital input [
V1V2V3V4] = [0000] produces an 
analog output of −Vo = 0 V; [V1V2V3V4] = [0001] gives −Vo = 0.125 V.
Example 5.12
 In practice, the voltage levels may be 
typically 0 and ± 5 V.

Similarly,
[V1V2V3V4] = [0010] ⇒ −Vo = 0.25 V
[V1V2V3V4] = [0011] ⇒ −Vo = 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375 V
[V1V2V3V4] = [0100] ⇒ −Vo = 0.5 V
   
⋮
[V1V2V3V4] = [1111] ⇒ −Vo = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 
   
= 1.875 V
Table 5.2 summarizes the result of the digital
-to-analog conversion. 
Note that we have assumed that each bit has a value of 0.125 V. Thus, in 
this system, we cannot represent a voltage between 1.000 and 1.125, for 
example. This lack of resolution is a major limitation of digital-to-analog 
conversions. For greater accuracy, a word representation with a greater 
number of bits is required. Even then a digital representation of an ana -
log voltage is never exact. In spite of this inexact representation, digital 
representation has been used to accomplish remarkable things such as 
audio CDs and digital photography.
A three-bit DAC is shown in Fig. 5.37.
(a) Determine |Vo| for [V1V2V3] = [010].
(b) Find |Vo| if [V1V2V3] = [110].
(c) If |Vo| = 1.25 V is desired, what should be [V1V2V3]?
(d) To get |Vo| = 1.75 V, what should be [V1V2V3]?
Answer: 0.5 V, 1.5 V, [101], [111].

5.10.2  Instrumentation Amplifiers
One of the most useful and v ersatile op amp circuits for precision mea -
surement and process control is the instrumentation amplifier (IA), so 
called because of its widespread use in measurement systems. 
Typical 
applications of IAs include isolation amplifiers, thermocouple amplifi-
ers, and data acquisition systems.
The instrumentation amplifier is an extension of the difference am-
plifier in that it amplifies the difference between its input signals. As 
shown in Fig. 5.26 (see Example 5.8), an instrumentation amplifier typi-
cally consists of three op amps and seven resistors. For convenience, the 
amplifier is shown again in Fig. 5.38(a), where the resistors are made equal 
except for the external gain-setting resistor RG, connected between the 
gain set terminals. Figure 5.38(b) shows its schematic symbol. Example 
5.8 showed that
 
vo = Av(v2 − v1) 
(5.24)
where the voltage gain is
 
Av = 1 +  2R 
___ 
RG  
(5.25)

voltages. Since the common-mode voltages are equal, they cancel each 
other.
The IA has three major characteristics:
1. The voltage gain is adjusted by one external resistor RG.
2. The input impedance of both inputs is very high and does not vary 
as the gain is adjusted.
3. The output vo depends on the dif ference between the inputs v1 and 
v2, not on the voltage common to them (common-mode  voltage).
Due to the widespread use of IAs, manuf acturers have developed 
these amplifiers on single-package units. A typical e xample is the 
LH0036, developed by National Semiconductor . The gain can be v ar-
ied from 1 to 1,000 by an e xternal resistor whose value may vary from  
100 to 10 kΩ.
Example 5.13
In Fig. 5.38, let R = 10 kΩ, v1 = 2.011 V, and v2 = 2.017 V. If RG is 
adjusted to 500 Ω, determine: (a) the voltage gain, (b) the output volt -
age vo.
Solution:
(a) The voltage gain is
Av = 1 +  2R 
___ 
RG  = 1 +  2 × 10,000 
________ 
500 
 = 41
(b) The output voltage is
vo = Av(v2 − v1) = 41(2.017 − 2.011) = 41(6) mV = 246 mV
Practice Problem 5.13
Determine the value of the external gain-setting resistor RG required for 
the IA in Fig. 5.38 to produce a gain of 200 when R = 25 kΩ.
Answer: 251.3 Ω.

nals is zero, and the voltage across its input terminals is negligibly  
small.

of the input.
6. In a noninverting amplifier, the output is a positive multiple of the 
input.
7. In a voltage follower, the output follows the input.
8. In a summing amplifier, the output is the weighted sum of the inputs.
9. In a difference amplifier, the output is proportional to the difference 
of the two inputs.

Capacitors and 
Inductors
But in science the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to 
the man to whom the idea first occurs.
—Francis Darwin
Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.c), “an ability to design a system, 
component, or process to meet desired needs.”
The “ability to design a system, component, or process to meet 
desired needs” is why engineers are hired. That is why this is the 
most important technical skill that an engineer has. Interestingly, your 
success as an engineer is directly proportional to your ability to com-
municate but your being able to design is wh y you will be hired in 
the first place.
Design takes place when you have what is termed an open-ended 
problem that eventually is defined by the solution. Within the context 
of this course or te xtbook, we can only e xplore some of the elements  
of design. Pursuing all of the steps of our problem-solving technique  
teaches you se veral of the most important elements of the design 
process.
Probably the most important part of design is clearly defining what 
the system, component, process, or, in our case, problem is. Rarely is  
an engineer given a perfectly clear assignment. Therefore, as a student, 
you can develop and enhance this skill by asking yourself, your col-
leagues, or your professors questions designed to clarify the problem  
statement.
Exploring alternati ve solutions is another important part of the 
design process. Again, as a student, you can practice this part of the de -
sign process on almost every problem you work.
Evaluating your solutions is critical to any engineering assignment. 
Again, this is a skill that you as a student can practice on every problem 
you work.

Chapter 6  Capacitors and Inductors
6.1
 Introduction
So far we have limited our study to resistive circuits. In this chapter, we 
shall introduce two new and important passive linear circuit elements: 
the capacitor and the inductor. Unlike resistors, which dissipate energy, 
capacitors and inductors do not dissipate but store energy, which can be 
retrieved at a later time. F or this reason, capacitors and inductors are 
called storage elements.
The application of resistive circuits is quite limited. With the intro-
duction of capacitors and inductors in this chapter , we will be able to 
analyze more important and practical circuits. Be assured that the circuit 
analysis techniques covered in Chapters 3 and 4 are equally applicable to 
circuits with capacitors and inductors.
We begin by introducing capacitors and describing how to combine 
them in series or in parallel. Later, we do the same for inductors. As typi-
cal applications, we explore how capacitors are combined with op amps 
to form integrators, differentiators, and analog computers.
6.2
 Capacitors
A capacitor is a passi ve element designed to store ener gy in its elec -
tric field. Besides resistors, capacitors are the most common electrical 
components. Capacitors are used extensively in electronics, communica-
tions, computers, and power systems. For example, they are used in the 
tuning circuits of radio recei vers and as dynamic memory elements in 
computer systems.
A capacitor is typically constructed as depicted in Fig. 6.1.
A capacitor consists of two conducting plates separated by an insulator 
(or dielectric).
In many practical applications, the plates may be aluminum foil while 
the dielectric may be air, ceramic, paper, or mica.
In contrast to a resistor, which spends 
or dissipates energy irreversibly, an 
 inductor or capacitor stores or releases 
energy (i.e., has a memory).

Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Fully understand the volt-amp characteristics of capacitors and 
inductors and their use in basic circuits.
2. Explain how capacitors behave when combined in parallel and 
in series.
3. Understand how inductors behave when combined in parallel 
and in series.
4. Know how to create integrators using capacitors and op amps.
5. Learn how to create differentiators and their limitations. 
6. Learn how to create analog computers and to understand how 
they can be used to solve linear differential equations.

6.2  Capacitors
215
When a voltage source v is connected to the capacitor, as in Fig. 6.2, 
the source deposits a positive charge q on one plate and a negative charge 
−q on the other . The capacitor is said to store the electric char ge. The 
amount of charge stored, represented by q, is directly proportional to the 
applied voltage v so that
q = Cv
 
(6.1)
where C, the constant of proportionality , is kno wn as the capacitance 
of the capacitor. The unit of capacitance is the farad (F), in honor of 
the English physicist Michael Faraday (1791–1867). From Eq. (6.1), we 
may derive the following definition.
Capacitance is the ratio of the charge on one plate of a capacitor to the 
voltage difference between the two plates, measured in farads (F).
Note from Eq. (6.1) that 1 farad = 1 coulomb/volt.
Although the capacitance C of a capacitor is the ratio of the charge q 
per plate to the applied voltage v, it does not depend on q or v. It depends 
on the physical dimensions of the capacitor. For example, for the parallel-
plate capacitor shown in Fig. 6.1, the capacitance is given by
 
C =  ​ϵA 
___ 
d  
(6.2)
where A is the surf ace area of each plate, 
d is the distance between 
the plates, and ϵ is the permittivity of the dielectric material between the 
plates. Although Eq. (6.2) applies to only parallel-plate capacitors, we 
may infer from it that, in general, three f actors determine the v alue of 
the capacitance: 
1. The surface area of the plates—the lar ger the area, the greater the 
capacitance.
2. The spacing between the plates—the smaller the spacing, the greater 
the capacitance.

v
Figure 6.2
A capacitor with applied voltage v.
 Alternatively, capacitance is the amount 
of charge stored per plate for a unit 
voltage difference in a capacitor.
 Capacitor voltage rating and capaci-
tance are typically inversely rated due 
to the relationships in Eqs. (6.1) and

Michael Faraday (1791–1867), an  Engl ish c hemist a nd phy sicist, 
was probably the greatest experimentalist who ever lived.
Born near London, Faraday realized his boyhood dream by work-
ing with the great chemist Sir Humphry Davy at the Royal Institu -
tion, where he worked for 54 years. He made several contributions
 
in all areas of physical science and coined such words as electrolysis,   
anode, and cathode. His discovery of electromagnetic induction in 
1831 was a major breakthrough in engineering because it provided a  
way of generating electricity. The electric motor and generator operate 
on this principle. The unit of capacitance, the farad, was named in his  
honor.

3. The permittivity of the material—the higher the permitti
vity, the 
greater the capacitance.
Capacitors are commercially a vailable in different values and types. 
Typically, capacitors have values in the picofarad (pF) to microfarad (μF) 
range. They are described by the dielectric material the y are made of and 
by whether they are of fixed or variable type. Figure 6.3 shows the circuit 
symbols for fixed and variable capacitors. Note that according to the pas -
sive sign convention, if v > 0 and i > 0 or if v < 0 and i < 0, the capacitor 
is being charged, and if v · i < 0, the capacitor is discharging.

According to Eq. (6.4), for a capacitor 
to carry current, its voltage must vary 
with time. Hence, for constant voltage, 
i = 0.

Figure 6.4 shows common types of fixed-value capacitors. Polyester 
capacitors are light in weight, stable, and their change with tempera
-
ture is predictable. Instead of polyester, other dielectric materials such as 
mica and polystyrene may be used. Film capacitors are rolled and housed 
in metal or plastic films. Electrolytic capacitors produce very high 
capacitance. Figure 6.5 shows the most common types of variable capac-
itors. The capacitance of a trimmer (or padder)  capacitor is often placed 
in parallel with another capacitor so that the equi valent capacitance can 
be varied slightly. The capacitance of the variable air capacitor (meshed 
plates) is varied by turning the shaft. Variable capacitors are used in radio 
receivers allowing one to tune to various stations. In addition, capacitors 
are used to block dc, pass ac, shift phase, store energy, start motors, and 
suppress noise.
To obtain the current-voltage relationship of the capacitor , we take 
the derivative of both sides of Eq. (6.1). Since

This is the current-v oltage relationship for a capacitor , assuming the 
passive sign convention. The relationship is illustrated in Fig. 6.6 for a 
capacitor whose capacitance is independent of v oltage. Capacitors that 
satisfy Eq. (6.4) are said to be linear. For a nonlinear capacitor, the plot 
of the current-voltage relationship is not a straight line. Although some 

6.2  Capacitors

capacitors are nonlinear, most are linear. We will assume linear capaci -
tors in this book.
The v oltage-current relation of the capacitor can be obtained by 
integrating both sides of Eq. (6.4). We get

tion (6.6) shows that capacitor voltage depends on the past  history of the 
capacitor current. Hence, the capacitor has memory—a property that is 
often exploited.

(6.10)
Equation (6.9) or (6.10) represents the energy stored in the electric field 
that exists between the plates of the capacitor. This energy can be retrieved,  
since an ideal capacitor cannot dissipate energy. In fact, the word capaci-
tor is derived from this element’s capacity to store energy in an electric 
field.
We should note the following important properties of a capacitor:
1. Note from Eq. (6.4) that when the v oltage across a capacitor is not 
changing with time (i.e., dc voltage), the current through the capaci-
tor is zero. Thus,
A capacitor is an open circuit to dc.
 
However, if a battery (dc voltage) is connected across a capacitor, 
the capacitor charges.

 An alternative way of looking at this is 
using Eq. (6.9), which indicates that 
energy is proportional to voltage 
squared. Since injecting or extracting 
energy can only be done over some 
 finite time, voltage cannot change 
 instantaneously across a capacitor.

2. The voltage on the capacitor must be continuous.
The voltage on a capacitor cannot change abruptly.
The capacitor resists an abrupt change in the v
oltage across it. 
According to Eq. (6.4), a discontinuous change in v oltage requires 
an infinite current, which is physically impossible. For example, the 
voltage across a capacitor may tak e the form shown in Fig. 6.7(a), 
whereas it is not physically possible for the capacitor voltage to take 
the form shown in Fig. 6.7(b) because of the abrupt changes. Con -
versely, the current through a capacitor can change instantaneously.
3. The ideal capacitor does not dissipate ener gy. It takes power from 
the circuit when storing ener gy in its field and returns previously 
stored energy when delivering power to the circuit.
4. A real, nonideal capacitor has a parallel-model leakage resistance, as 
shown in Fig. 6.8. The leakage resistance may be as high as 100 MΩ
and can be neglected for most practical applications. For this reason, 
we will assume ideal capacitors in this book.

We know from resistive circuits that the series-parallel combination is a  
powerful tool for reducing circuits. This technique can be e xtended to 
series-parallel connections of capacitors, which are sometimes encoun -
tered. We desire to replace these capacitors by a single equivalent capaci-
tor Ceq.
In order to obtain the equi valent capacitor Ceq of N capacitors in 
 parallel, consider the circuit in Fig. 6.14(a).

The initial voltage v(t0) across Ceq is required by KVL to be the sum of 
the capacitor voltages at t0. Or according to Eq. (6.15),
v(t0) = v1(t0) + v2(t0) + ⋯ + vN(t0)
Thus, according to Eq. (6.16),
The equivalent capacitance of series-connected capacitors is the 
 reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances.

Chapter 6  Capacitors and Inductors
6.4
 Inductors
An inductor is a passive element designed to store energy in its magnetic 
field. Inductors find numerous applications in electronic and power sys-
tems. They are used in power supplies, transformers, radios, TVs, radars, 
and electric motors.
Any conductor of electric current has inductive properties and may 
be regarded as an inductor. But in order to enhance the inductive effect, 
a practical inductor is usually formed into a c ylindrical coil with man y 
turns of conducting wire, as shown in Fig. 6.21.
An inductor consists of a coil of conducting wire.
If current is allowed to pass through an inductor, it is found that the volt-
age across the inductor is directly proportional to the time rate of change 
of the current. Using the passive sign convention,
v =  L 
di
 
__
 
dt  
 
(6.18)
where L is the constant of proportionality called the inductance of the 
inductor. The unit of inductance is the henry (H), named in honor of the 
American inventor Joseph Henry (1797–1878). It is clear from Eq. (6.18) 
that 1 henry equals 1 volt-second per ampere.
Inductance is the property whereby an inductor exhibits opposition to 
the change of current flowing through it, measured in henrys (H).
The inductance of an inductor depends on its ph
ysical dimension 
and construction. F ormulas for calculating the inductance of inductors 
of different shapes are derived from electromagnetic theory and can be 
found in standard electrical engineering handbooks. For example, for the 
inductor, (solenoid) shown in Fig. 6.21,
L =  ​N2μA 
_____ 
ℓ
 
(6.19)
where N is the number of turns, ℓ is the length, A is the cross-sectional 
area, and μ is the permeability of the core. We can see from Eq. (6.19) 
that inductance can be increased by increasing the number of turns of 
coil, using material with higher permeability as the core, increasing the 
cross-sectional area, or reducing the length of the coil.
Like capacitors, commercially a vailable inductors come in dif fer-
ent values and types. Typical practical inductors have inductance values 
ranging from a few microhenrys (μH), as in communication systems, to 
tens of henrys (H) as in po wer systems. Inductors may be fixed or vari-
able. The core may be made of iron, steel, plastic, or air . The terms coil
and choke are also used for inductors. Common inductors are sho wn in 
Fig. 6.22. The circuit symbols for inductors are shown in Fig. 6.23, fol-
lowing the passive sign convention.
Equation (6.18) is the v oltage-current relationship for an inductor . 
Figure 6.24 sho ws this relationship graphically for an inductor whose

In view of Eq. (6.18), for an inductor 
to have voltage across its terminals, its 
current must vary with time. Hence, 
v = 0 for constant current through

inductance is independent of current. Such an inductor is kno
wn as a 
linear inductor. For a nonlinear inductor, the plot of Eq. (6.18) will not 
be a straight line because its inductance v
aries with current. We will

where i(t0) is the total current for −∞ < t < t0 and i(−∞) = 0. The idea 
of making i(−∞) = 0 is practical and reasonable, because there must be 
a time in the past when there was no current in the inductor.
The inductor is designed to store ener gy in its magnetic field. The 
energy stored can be obtained from Eq. (6.18). The power delivered to

Joseph Henry (1797–1878), an American physicist, discovered induc-
tance and constructed an electric motor.
Born in Albany, New York, Henry graduated from Albany Acad-
emy and taught philosophy at Princeton University from 1832 to 1846. 
He was the first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He conduct-
ed  several experiments on electromagnetism and developed powerful 
electromagnets that could lift objects weighing thousands of pounds. 
Interestingly, Joseph Henry discovered electromagnetic induction before 
Faraday but failed to publish his findings. The unit of inductance, the 
henry, was named after him.

We should note the following important properties of an inductor.
1. Note from Eq. (6.18) that the v
oltage across an inductor is zero 
when the current is constant. Thus,
An inductor acts like a short circuit to dc.
2. An important property of the inductor is its opposition to the change 
in current flowing through it.
The current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously.
According to Eq. (6.18), a discontinuous change in the current 
through an inductor requires an infinite voltage, which is not physi-
cally possible. Thus, an inductor opposes an abrupt change in the 
current through it. For example, the current through an inductor may 
take the form sho wn in Fig. 6.25(a), whereas the inductor current 
cannot take the form shown in Fig. 6.25(b) in real-life situations due 
to the discontinuities. Ho wever, the voltage across an inductor can 
change abruptly.
3. Like the ideal capacitor , the ideal inductor does not dissipate
 
energy. The energy stored in it can be retrie ved at a later time. 
The inductor tak es power from the circuit when storing ener gy 
and delivers po wer to the circuit 
when returning pre viously 
stored energy.
4. A practical, nonideal inductor has a significant resistive compo-
nent, as shown in Fig. 6.26. This is due to the fact that the inductor 
is made of a conducting material such as copper , which has some 
resistance. This resistance is called the winding resistance Rw, and it 
appears in series with the inductance of the inductor . The presence 
of Rw makes it both an ener gy storage device and an energy dissi-
pation device. Since Rw is usually v ery small, it is ignored in most 
cases. The nonideal inductor also has a winding capacitance Cw due 
to the capacitive coupling between the conducting coils. Cw is very 
small and can be ignored in most cases, except at high frequencies. 
We will assume ideal inductors in this book.

 Series and Parallel Inductors
Now that the inductor has been added to our list of passive elements, it is 
necessary to extend the powerful tool of series-parallel combination. We 
need to know how to find the equivalent inductance of a series-connected 
or parallel-connected set of inductors found in practical circuits.
Consider a series connection of N inductors, as shown in Fig. 6.29(a), 
with the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 6.29(b). The inductors have the 
same current through them. Applying KVL to the loop,

Thus,
The equivalent inductance of series-connected inductors is the sum of 
the individual inductances.
Inductors in series are combined in exactly the same way as resistors 
in series.
We now consider a parallel connection of N inductors, as shown in 
Fig. 6.30(a), with the equi valent circuit in Fig. 6.30(b). The inductors

The initial current i(t0) through Leq at t​=​t0 is expected by KCL to be the 
sum of the inductor currents at t0. Thus, according to Eq. (6.29),
i(t0) = i1(t0) + i2(t0) + ⋯ + iN(t0)
According to Eq. (6.30),
The equivalent inductance of parallel inductors is the reciprocal of the 
sum of the reciprocals of the individual inductances.
Note that the inductors in parallel are combined in the same way as resis-
tors in parallel.

Solution:

(a) i1(0); (b) v(t), v1(t), and v2(t); (c) i1(t) and i2(t).
Solution:
(a) From i(t) = 4(2 − e−10t) mA, i(0) = 4(2 − 1) = 4 mA. Since i = i1 + i2,
i1(0) = i(0) − i2(0) = 4 − (−1) = 5 mA
(b) The equivalent inductance is

Chapter 6  Capacitors and Inductors
come in discrete form and tend to be more b
ulky and e xpensive. For 
this reason, inductors are not as versatile as capacitors and resistors, and 
they are more limited in applications. However, there are several applica-
tions in which inductors have no practical substitute. They are routinely 
used in relays, delays, sensing devices, pick-up heads, telephone circuits, 
radio and TV receivers, power supplies, electric motors, microphones, 
and loudspeakers, to mention a few.
Capacitors and inductors possess the following three special proper-
ties that make them very useful in electric circuits:
1. The capacity to store ener gy makes them useful as temporary v olt-
age or current sources. Thus, they can be used for generating a large 
amount of current or voltage for a short period of time.
2. Capacitors oppose an y abrupt change in v oltage, while inductors 
oppose any abrupt change in current. This property makes inductors 
useful for spark or arc suppression and for converting pulsating dc 
voltage into relatively smooth dc voltage.
3. Capacitors and inductors are frequenc
y sensiti ve. This property 
makes them useful for frequency discrimination.
The first two properties are put to use in dc circuits, while the third 
one is taken advantage of in ac circuits. We will see how useful these 
properties are in later chapters. F or now, consider three applications  
involving capacitors and op amps: integrator, differentiator, and analog 
computer.
6.6.1  Integrator
Important op amp circuits that use energy-storage elements include  
integrators and dif ferentiators. These op amp circuits often in
volve 
resistors and capacitors; inductors (coils) tend to be more b
ulky and 
expensive.
The op amp integrator is used in numerous applications, especially 
in analog computers, to be discussed in Section 6.6.3.
An integrator is an op amp circuit whose output is proportional to the 
integral of the input signal.
If the feedback resistor 
Rf in the f amiliar in verting amplifier of 
Fig. 6.35(a) is replaced by a capacitor , we obtain an ideal inte grator, as 
shown in Fig. 6.35(b). It is interesting that we can obtain a mathematical 
representation of integration this way. At node a in Fig. 6.35(b),

which shows that the circuit in Fig. 6.35(b) pro vides an output v oltage

tor requires a feedback resistor to reduce dc gain and prevent saturation. 
Care must be taken that the op amp operates within the linear range so 
that it does not saturate.

6.6.2  Differentiator
A differentiator is an op amp circuit whose output is proportional to the 
rate of change of the input signal.
In Fig. 6.35(a), if the input resistor is replaced by a capacitor
, the 
resulting circuit is a dif ferentiator, shown in Fig. 6.37. Applying KCL 
at node a,
 
iR = iC

Sketch the output voltage for the circuit in Fig. 6.38(a), given the input

Solution:
This is a differentiator with

6.6.3  Analog Computer
Op amps were initially de
veloped for electronic analog computers. 
Analog computers can be programmed to solv e mathematical models of 
mechanical or electrical systems. These models are usually expressed in 
terms of differential equations.
To solve simple dif ferential equations using the analog computer 
requires cascading three types of op amp circuits: inte
grator circuits, 
summing amplifiers, and inverting/noninverting amplifiers for negative/ 
positive scaling. The best way to illustrate how an analog computer solves 
a differential equation is with an example.
Suppose we desire the solution x(t) of the equation
a d2x 
___ 
dt2  + b dx 
___ 
dt  + cx = f(t),  
t > 0 
(6.38)
where a, b, and c are constants, and f(t) is an arbitrary forcing func -
tion. The solution is obtained by first solving the highest-order derivative 
term. Solving for d2x∕dt2 yields
 
 d2x 
___ 
dt2  =  ​f(t) 
___ 
a  −  b 
__ a   dx 
___ 
dt  −  c 
__ a  x 
(6.39)
To obtain dx∕dt, the d2x∕dt2 term is inte grated and inverted. Finally, to 
obtain x, the dx∕dt term is integrated and inverted. The forcing function 
is injected at the proper point. Thus, the analog computer for solving 
Eq. (6.38) is implemented by connecting the necessary summers, invert-
ers, and integrators. A plotter or oscilloscope may be used to vie w the 
output x, or dx∕dt, or d2x∕dt2, depending on where it is connected in the 
system.
Although the above example is on a second-order differential equa-
tion, any differential equation can be simulated by an analog computer 
comprising integrators, inverters, and inverting summers. But care must 
be exercised in selecting the v alues of the resistors and capacitors, to 
ensure that the op amps do not saturate during the solution time interval.
The analog computers with vacuum tubes were built in the 1950s and 
1960s. Recently their use has declined. 
They have been superseded by 
modern digital computers. Ho wever, we still study analog computers for 
two reasons. First, the a vailability of integrated op amps has made it pos -
sible to build analog computers easily and cheaply. Second, understanding 
analog computers helps with the appreciation of the digital computers.
Example 6.15
Design an analog computer circuit to solve the differential equation:
 d2vo 
____ 
dt2  + 2 dvo 
___ 
dt  + vo = 10 sin 4t,  
t > 0
subject to vo(0) = −4,  vo′ (0) = 1, where the prime refers to the time 
 
derivative.
Solution:
1. Define. We have a clearly defined problem and expected solution. 
I might remind the student that many times the problem is not so 
well defined and this portion of the problem-solving process could 

236 
Chapter 6  Capacitors and Inductors
require much more effort. If this is so, then you should always keep 
in mind that time spent here will result in much less effort later and 
most likely save you a lot of frustration in the process.
2. Present. Clearly, using the devices developed in Section 6.6.3 will 
allow us to create the desired analog computer circuit. We will 
need the integrator circuits (possibly combined with a summing 
capability) and one or more inverter circuits.
3. Alternative. The approach for solving this problem is 
straight forward. We will need to pick the correct values of 
resistances and capacitors to allow us to realize the equation we are 
repre senting. The final output of the circuit will give the desired 
result.
4. Attempt. There are an infinite number of possibilities for picking 
the resistors and capacitors, many of which will result in correct 
solutions. Extreme values of resistors and capacitors will result in 
incorrect outputs. For example, low values of resistors will overload 
the electronics. Picking values of resistors that are too large will 
cause the op amps to stop functioning as ideal devices. The limits 
can be determined from the characteristics of the real op amp.
  
We first solve for the second derivative as
 d2vo 
____ 
dt2  = 10 sin 4t − 2 dvo 
___ 
dt  − vo 
(6.15.1)
Solving this requires some mathematical operations, includ-
ing summing, scaling, and integration. Integrating both sides of 
Eq. (6.15.1) gives
 
 dvo 
___ 
dt  = −​∫ 
0 
t
   (−10 sin(4τ) + 2 dvo(τ) 
_____ 
dτ​ ​ + vo(τ)) dτ +  vo′ (0)
 
(6.15.2)
where  vo′ (0) = 1. We implement Eq. (6.15.2) using the summing 
integrator shown in Fig. 6.40(a). The values of the resistors and 
capacitors have been chosen so that RC = 1 for the term
−​ 1 
___ 
RC   ∫ 
0 
t
    vo(τ) dτ
Other terms in the summing integrator of Eq. (6.15.2) are 
implemented accordingly. The initial condition dvo(0)∕dt = 1 is 
imple mented by connecting a 1-V battery with a switch across the 
capacitor as shown in Fig. 6.40(a).
 
The next step is to obtain vo by integrating dvo∕dt and inverting 
the result,
 
vo = − ∫ 
0 
t
    −​dvo(τ) 
_____ 
dτ​ ​dτ + v(0) 
(6.15.3)
This is implemented with the circuit in Fig. 6.40(b) with the  battery 
giving the initial condition of −4 V. We now combine the two 
circuits in Fig. 6.40(a) and (b) to obtain the complete circuit shown 
in Fig. 6.40(c). When the input signal 10 sin 4t is applied, we open 
the switches at t = 0 to obtain the output waveform vo, which may 
be viewed on an oscilloscope.

6.6  Applications
237
5. Evaluate. The answer looks correct, but is it? If an actual  solution 
for vo is desired, then a good check would be to first find the 
 solution by realizing the circuit in PSpice. This result could then be 
compared with a solution using the differential solution capability 
of MATLAB.
 
Since all we need to do is check the circuit and confirm that it 
represents the equation, we have an easier technique to use. We just 
go through the circuit and see if it generates the desired equation.
 
However, we still have choices to make. We could go through 
the circuit from left to right but that would involve differentiating the 
result to obtain the original equation. An easier approach would be 
to go from right to left. This is the approach we will use to check the 
answer.
 
Starting with the output, vo, we see that the right-hand op amp 
is nothing more than an inverter with a gain of one. This means that 
the output of the middle circuit is −vo. The following represents the 
action of the middle circuit.
​

Enhancing Your Career
Careers in Computer Engineering 
Electrical engineering education has gone through drastic changes in re-
cent decades. Most departments have come to be known as Department 
of Electrical and Computer Engineering, emphasizing the rapid changes 
due to computers. Computers occup y a prominent place in modern so -
ciety and education. They have become commonplace and are helping 
to change the f ace of research, de velopment, production, business, and 
entertainment. The scientist, engineer , doctor, attorney, teacher, airline 
pilot, businessperson—almost anyone benefits from a computer’s abili-
ties to store large amounts of information and to process that information 
in very short periods of time. The internet, a computer communication 
network, is essential in b usiness, education, and library science. Com -
puter usage continues to grow by leaps and bounds.
An education in computer engineering should provide breadth in soft-
ware, hardware design, and basic modeling techniques. It should include  
courses in data structures, digital systems, computer architecture, micro -
processors, interfacing, software engineering, and operating systems.
Electrical engineers who specialize in computer engineering find 
jobs in computer industries and in numerous fields where computers 
are being used. Companies that produce software are growing rapidly in 
number and size and providing employment for those who are skilled in 
programming. An excellent way to advance one’s knowledge of comput-
ers is to join the IEEE Computer Society, which sponsors diverse maga-
zines, journals, and conferences.

Chapter 7  First-Order Circuits
7.1
 Introduction
Now that we ha ve considered the three passi ve elements (resistors, ca -
pacitors, and inductors) and one active element (the op amp)  individually, 
we are prepared to consider circuits that contain various combinations of 
two or three of the passi ve elements. In this chapter , we shall e xamine 
two types of simple circuits: a circuit comprising a resistor and  capacitor 
and a circuit comprising a resistor and an inductor. These are called RC 
and RL circuits, respectively. As simple as these circuits are, the y find 
continual applications in electronics, communications, and control sys -
tems, as we shall see.
We carry out the analysis of RC and RL circuits by applying Kirch-
hoff’s laws, as we did for resisti ve circuits. The only difference is that 
applying Kirchhoff’s laws to purely resistive circuits results in algebraic 
equations, while applying the la ws to RC and RL circuits produces dif-
ferential equations, which are more difficult to solve than algebraic equa-
tions. The differential equations resulting from analyzing RC and RL cir-
cuits are of the first order. Hence, the circuits are collectively known as 
first-order circuits.
In addition to there being tw o types of first-order circuits (RC and
RL), there are tw o ways to e xcite the circuits. The first way is by ini -
tial conditions of the storage elements in the circuits. In these so-called 
source-free circuits, we assume that ener gy is initially stored in the ca -
pacitive or inductive element. The energy causes current to flow in the 
circuit and is gradually dissipated in the resistors. Although source-free 
circuits are by definition free of independent sources, they may ha ve 
dependent sources. The second way of exciting first-order circuits is by 
independent sources. In this chapter, the independent sources we will 
consider are dc sources. (In later chapters, we shall consider sinusoidal 
and exponential sources.) The two types of first-order circuits and the 
two ways of exciting them add up to the four possible situations we will 
study in this chapter.
Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Understand solutions to unforced, first-order linear differential 
equations.
2. Comprehend singularity equations and know their importance 
in solving linear differential equations.
3. Understand the effect of unit step sources on first-order linear 
differential equations.
4. Explain how dependent sources and op amps influence simple 
first-order linear differential equations.
5. Use PSpice to solve simple transient circuits with an inductor 
or a capacitor.
A first-order circuit is characterized by a first-order differential  equation.

7.2  The Source-Free RC Circuit 
253
Finally, we consider four typical applications of RC and RL circuits: 
delay and relay circuits, a photoflash unit, and an automobile ignition 
circuit.
7.2
 The Source-Free RC Circuit
A source-free RC circuit occurs when its dc source is suddenly 
 disconnected. 
The energy already stored in the capacitor is released to the resistors.
Consider a series combination of a resistor and an initially char ged 
capacitor, as shown in Fig. 7.1. (The resistor and capacitor may be the 
equivalent resistance and equivalent capacitance of combinations of re -
sistors and capacitors.) Our objective is to determine the circuit response, 
which, for pedagogic reasons, we assume to be the voltage v(t) across the 
capacitor. Since the capacitor is initially charged, we can assume that at 
time t = 0, the initial voltage is
v(0) = V0 
(7.1)
with the corresponding value of the energy stored as
 
w(0) =  1 
__ 2  CV2
0 
(7.2)
Applying KCL at the top node of the circuit in Fig. 7.1 yields
 
iC + iR = 0 
(7.3)
By definition, iC = C dv∕dt and iR = v∕R. Thus,
 
C  dv 
___ 
dt  +  v 
__ 
R  = 0 
(7.4a)
or
 
 dv 
___ 
dt  +  v 
___ 
RC  = 0 
(7.4b)
 This is a first-order differential equation, since only the first derivative of 
v is involved. To solve it, we rearrange the terms as
 
 dv 
___ 
v   = −  1 
___ 
RC  dt 
(7.5)
Integrating both sides, we get
ln v = −  t 
___ 
RC  + ln A
where ln A is the integration constant. Thus,
 
ln  v 
__ 
A  = − t 
___ 
RC  
(7.6)
Taking powers of e produces
v(t) = A e −t∕RC 
But from the initial conditions, v(0) = A = V0. Hence,
 
v(t) = V0  e −t∕RC 
(7.7)
This shows that the voltage response of the RC circuit is an exponential de-
cay of the initial voltage. Since the response is due to the initial energy stored 
and the physical characteristics of the circuit and not due to some e xternal 
voltage or current source, it is called the natural response of the circuit.

The natural response of a circuit refers to the behavior (in terms of  voltages 
and currents) of the circuit itself, with no external sources of excitation.
The natural response is illustrated graphically in Fig. 7.2. Note that at 
t = 0, we have the correct initial condition as in Eq. (7.1). As t increases, 
the voltage decreases toward zero. The rapidity with which the v oltage 
decreases is expressed in terms of the time constant, denoted by τ, the 
lowercase Greek letter tau.
The time constant of a circuit is the time required for the response to 
decay to a factor of 1∕e or 36.8 percent of its initial value.1
This implies that at t = τ, Eq. (7.7) becomes
V0e−τ∕RC = V0e−1 = 0.368V0
or
τ = RC
 
(7.8)
In terms of the time constant, Eq. (7.7) can be written as
 
v(t) = V0e−t∕τ
 
(7.9)
With a calculator it is easy to sho
w that the v alue of v(t)∕V0 is as  
shown in Table 7.1. It is evident from Table 7.1 that the voltage v(t) is less 
than 1 percent of V0 after 5τ (five time constants). Thus, it is customary to 
assume that the capacitor is fully dischar ged (or charged) after five time 
constants. In other words, it takes 5τ for the circuit to reach its final state 
or steady state when no changes take place with time. Notice that for every 
time interval of τ, the voltage is reduced by 36.8 percent of its pre vious 
value, v(t + τ) = v(t)∕e = 0.368v(t), regardless of the value of t.
Observe from Eq. (7.8) that the smaller the time constant, the more 
rapidly the v oltage decreases, that is, the f aster the response. This is 
 illustrated in Fig. 7.4. A circuit with a small time constant gi ves a fast 
response in that it reaches the steady state (or final state) quickly due to 
quick dissipation of ener gy stored, whereas a circuit with a lar ge time 
constant gives a slo w response because it tak es longer to reach steady 
state. At any rate, whether the time constant is small or large, the circuit 
reaches steady state in five time constants.
With the voltage v(t) in Eq. (7.9), we can find the current iR(t),
 
iR(t) =  v(t) 
___ 
R  =  V0 
___ 
R   e  −t∕τ  
(7.10)
1 The time constant may be viewed from another perspective. Evaluating the derivative of 
v(t) in Eq. (7.7) at t = 0, we obtain

Thus, the time constant is the initial rate of decay, or the time taken for v∕V0 to decay from 
unity to zero, assuming a constant rate of decay. This initial slope interpretation of the time 
constant is often used in the laboratory to find τ graphically from the response curve dis-
played on an oscilloscope. To find τ from the response curve, draw the tangent to the curve 
at t = 0, as shown in Fig. 7.3. The tangent intercepts with the time axis at t = τ.

In summary:
The Key to Working with a Source-Free RC Circuit 
Is Finding:
1. The initial voltage v(0) = V0 across the capacitor.
 2. The time constant τ.
With these tw o items, we obtain the response as the capacitor v
oltage 
vC (t) = v(t) = v(0)  e −t∕τ . Once the capacitor voltage is first obtained, other 
variables (capacitor current iC, resistor voltage vR, and resistor current iR) 
can be determined. In finding the time constant τ = RC, R is often the 
Thevenin equivalent resistance at the terminals of the capacitor; that is, 
we take out the capacitor C and find R = RTh at its terminals.
The time constant is the same regard-
less of what the output is defined 
to be.
When a circuit contains a single 
 capacitor and several resistors and 
 dependent sources, the Thevenin 
equivalent can be found at the 
 terminals of the capacitor to form a 
simple RC circuit. Also, one can use 
Thevenin’s theorem when several 
 capacitors can be combined to form 
a single  equivalent capacitor.

tain capacitor voltage vC. From this, we can determine vx and ix.
 
The 8-Ω and 12- Ω resistors in series can be combined to give a 
20-Ω resistor. This 20-Ω resistor in parallel with the 5-Ω resistor can be 
combined so that the equivalent resistance is
Req =  20 × 5 
______ 
20 + 5  = 4 Ω
Hence, the equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 7.6, which is analogous  
to Fig. 7.1. The time constant is
τ = ReqC = 4(0.1) = 0.4 s
Thus,
v = v(0) e −t∕τ  = 15 e −t∕0.4 V,  
vC = v = 15 e −2.5t V
From Fig. 7.5, we can use voltage division to get vx; so

Example 7.2
The switch in the circuit in Fig. 7.8 has been closed for a long time, and 
it is opened at t = 0. Find v(t) for t ≥ 0. Calculate the initial energy stored 
in the capacitor.
Solution:
For t < 0, the switch is closed; the capacitor is an open circuit to dc, as 
represented in Fig. 7.9(a). Using voltage division
vC (t) =  9 
_____ 
9 + 3  (20) = 15 V,  
t < 0
Since the voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, the 
voltage across the capacitor at t = 0− is the same at t = 0, or
vC (0) = V0 = 15 V

For t > 0, the switch is opened, and we have the RC circuit shown 
in Fig. 7.9(b). [Notice that the  RC circuit in Fig. 7.9(b) is source free; 
the independent source in Fig. 7.8 is needed to provide V0 or the initial 
energy in the capacitor.] The 1-Ω and 9-Ω resistors in series give
Req = 1 + 9 = 10 Ω
The time constant is
τ = ReqC = 10  × 20  × 10−3 = 0.2 s
Thus, the voltage across the capacitor for t ≥ 0 is
v(t) = vC (0)e−t∕τ = 15e−t∕0.2 V
or
v(t) = 15e−5t V
The initial energy stored in the capacitor is

 The Source-Free RL Circuit
Consider the series connection of a resistor and an inductor, as shown in 
Fig. 7.11. Our goal is to determine the circuit response, which we will 
assume to be the current i(t) through the inductor. We select the induc -
tor current as the response in order to take advantage of the idea that the 
inductor current cannot change instantaneously. At t = 0, we assume that 
the inductor has an initial current I0, or
 
i(0) = I0 
(7.13)
with the corresponding energy stored in the inductor as

This shows that the natural response of the
 RL circuit is an e xpo-
nential decay of the initial current. The current response is shown in 
Fig. 7.12. It is evident from Eq. (7.18) that the time constant for the  
RL circuit is

The smaller the time constant τ of a 
 circuit, the faster the rate of decay of 
the response. The larger the time 
constant, the slower the rate of decay 
of the response. At any rate, the 
response decays to less than 1 percent 
of its  initial value (i.e., reaches steady 
state) after 5τ.

In summary:
The Key to Working with a Source-Free RL Circuit Is 
to Find:
1. The initial current i(0) = I0 through the inductor.
 2. The time constant τ of the circuit.
With the tw o items, we obtain the response as the inductor current 
 
iL(t) = i(t) = i(0) e −t∕τ . Once we determine the inductor current iL, other 
variables (inductor voltage vL, resistor voltage vR, and resistor current 
iR) can be obtained. Note that in general, R in Eq. (7.19) is the Thevenin 
resistance at the terminals of the inductor.
 When a circuit has a single inductor 
and several resistors and dependent 
sources, the Thevenin equivalent can 
be found at the terminals of the 
inductor to form a simple RL circuit. 
Also, one can use Thevenin’s theorem 
when several inductors can be 
combined to form a single equivalent 
inductor.
Solution:
There are two ways we can solve this problem. One way is to obtain the 
equivalent resistance at the inductor terminals and then use Eq. (7.20). 
The other way is to start from scratch by using Kirchhoff’s voltage law. 
Whichever approach is taken, it is always better to first obtain the induc-
tor current.
■ METHOD 1 The equivalent resistance is the same as the  Thevenin 
resistance at the inductor terminals. Because of the dependent source, we 
insert a voltage source with vo = 1 V at the inductor terminals a-b, as in 
Fig. 7.14(a). (We could also insert a 1-A current source at the terminals.) 
Applying KVL to the two loops results in

Example 7.4
The switch in the circuit of Fig. 7.16 has been closed for a long time. At 
t = 0, the switch is opened. Calculate i(t) for t > 0.
Solution:
When t < 0, the switch is closed, and the inductor acts as a short circuit 
to dc. The 16-Ω resistor is short-circuited; the resulting circuit is shown 
in Fig. 7.17(a). To get i1 in Fig. 7.17(a), we combine the 4- Ω and 12-Ω 
resistors in parallel to get
 4 × 12 
______ 
4 + 12  = 3 Ω
Hence,
i1 =  40 
_____ 
2 + 3  = 8 A
We obtain i(t) from i1 in Fig. 7.17(a) using current division, by writing
i(t) =  12 
______ 
12 + 4  i1 = 6 A,  
t < 0
Since the current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously,
i(0) = i(0−) = 6 A
 
When t > 0, the switch is open and the voltage source is disconnect-
ed. We now have the source-free  RL circuit in Fig. 7.17(b). Combining 
the resistors, we have
Req = (12 + 4) ║ 16 = 8 Ω

Practice Problem 7.4
Example 7.5
In the circuit shown in Fig. 7.19, find io, vo, and i for all time, assuming 
that the switch was open for a long time.
Solution:
It is better to first find the inductor current i and then obtain other quanti-
ties from it.
For t < 0, the switch is open. Since the inductor acts like a short cir-
cuit to dc, the 6-Ω resistor is short-circuited, so that we ha ve the circuit 
shown in Fig. 7.20(a). Hence, io = 0, and
i(t) =  10 
_____ 
2 + 3  = 2 A,  
t < 0
vo(t) = 3i(t) = 6 V,  
t < 0
Thus, i(0) = 2.
 
For t > 0, the switch is closed, so that the v oltage source is short-  
circuited. We now have a source-free RL circuit as shown in Fig. 7.20(b). 
At the inductor terminals,
 R Th = 3 ║ 6 = 2 Ω
so that the time constant is
τ =  L 
___ 
 R Th   = 1 s
Hence,
i(t) = i(0) e −t∕τ  = 2e−tA,  
t > 0

vo(t) = −vL = −L  di

that the time constant is the same regardless of what the output is defined 
to be. Figure 7.21 plots i and io.

that the switch was closed for a long time. It should be noted that opening 
a switch in series with an ideal current source creates an infinite voltage 
at the current source terminals. Clearly this is impossible. For the pur-
poses of problem solving, we can place a shunt resistor in parallel with 
the source (which now makes it a voltage source in series with a resistor). 
In more practical circuits, devices that act like current sources are, for the 
most part, electronic circuits. These circuits will allow the source to act  
like an ideal current source over its operating range but voltage-limit it  
when the load resistor becomes too large (as in an open circuit).

 Singularity Functions
Before going on with the second half of this chapter, we need to digress 
and consider some mathematical concepts that will aid our understand -
ing of transient analysis. A basic understanding of singularity functions 
will help us make sense of the response of first-order circuits to a sudden 
application of an independent dc voltage or current source.
Singularity functions (also called switching functions) are very use-
ful in circuit analysis. They serve as good approximations to the switch-
ing signals that arise in circuits with switching operations. 
They are 
helpful in the neat, compact description of some circuit phenomena, es -
pecially the step response of RC or RL circuits to be discussed in the next 
sections. By definition,

Chapter 7  First-Order Circuits
The unit step function u (t) is 0 for negative values of t and 1 for positive 
values of t.
The three most widely used singularity functions in circuit analysis 
are the unit step, the unit impulse, and the unit ramp functions.
In mathematical terms,
 
u(t) = 
 
 { 0,
1, t < 0
t > 0    
 
 
(7.24)
The unit step function is undefined at t = 0, where it changes abrupt -
ly from 0 to 1. It is dimensionless, lik
e other mathematical functions 
such as sine and cosine. Figure 7.23 depicts the unit step function. If the 
abrupt change occurs at t = t0 (where t0 > 0) instead of t = 0, the unit step 
function becomes
 
u(t − t0) = 
 
 { 0,
1,
  
t < t0
t > t0
   
 
 
(7.25)
which is the same as saying that u(t) is delayed by t0 seconds, as shown in 
Fig. 7.24(a). To get Eq. (7.25) from Eq. (7.24), we simply replace every t 
by t − t0. If the change is at t = −t0, the unit step function becomes
 
u(t + t0) = 
 
 { 0,
1,
  
t < −t0
t > −t0    
 
 
(7.26)
meaning that u(t) is advanced by t0 seconds, as shown in Fig. 7.24(b).
We use the step function to represent an abrupt change in voltage or 
current, like the changes that occur in the circuits of control systems and 
digital computers. For example, the voltage
 
v(t) = 
 
 { 0,
V0,
  
t < t0
t > t0
   
 
 
(7.27)
may be expressed in terms of the unit step function as
 
v(t) = V0u(t − t0) 
(7.28)
If we let t0 = 0, then v(t) is simply the step v oltage V0 u(t). A voltage 
source of V0 u(t) is shown in Fig. 7.25(a); its equivalent circuit is shown 
in Fig. 7.25(b). It is e vident in Fig. 7.25(b) that terminals a-b are short-
circuited (v = 0) for t < 0 and that v = V0 appears at the terminals for 
Alternatively, we may derive 
Eqs. (7.25) and (7.26) from Eq. (7.24) 
by writing u [f (t)] = 1, f (t) > 0, where 
f (t) may be t − t0 or t + t0.

t > 0. Similarly, a current source of I0 u(t) is shown in Fig. 7.26(a), while 
its equivalent circuit is in Fig. 7.26(b). Notice that for t < 0, there is an 
open circuit (i = 0), and that i = I0 flows for t > 0.
The derivative of the unit step function u(t) is the unit impulse func-
tion δ(t), which we write as
 
δ(t) =  d

(7.29)
The unit impulse function—also known as the delta function—is shown 
in Fig. 7.27.
The unit impulse function δ(t) is zero everywhere except at t = 0, where 
it is undefined.
Impulsive currents and v oltages occur in electric circuits as a result 
of switching operations or impulsi ve sources. Although the unit im -
pulse function is not ph ysically realizable (just like ideal sources, ideal 
resistors, etc.), it is a very useful mathematical tool.
The unit impulse may be regarded as an applied or resulting shock. 
It may be visualized as a very short duration pulse of unit area. This may 
be expressed mathematically as
∫ 
0− 
 0+
    δ(t) dt = 1 
(7.30)
where t = 0− denotes the time just before t = 0 and t =   0 + is the time just 
after t = 0. For this reason, it is customary to write 1 (denoting unit area) 
beside the arrow that is used to symbolize the unit impulse function, as 
in Fig. 7.27. The unit area is known as the strength of the impulse func-
tion. When an impulse function has a strength other than unity , the area 
of the impulse is equal to its strength. F
or example, an impulse func -
tion 10δ(t) has an area of 10. Figure 7.28 sho ws the impulse functions  
5δ(t + 2),10δ(t), and −4δ(t − 3).
To illustrate how the impulse function affects other functions, let us 
evaluate the integral

Chapter 7  First-Order Circuits
The unit ramp function is zero for negative values of t and has a unit 
slope for positive values of t.
Figure 7.29 shows the unit ramp function. In general, a ramp is a func -
tion that changes at a constant rate.
The unit ramp function may be delayed or adv
anced as sho wn in 
Fig. 7.30. For the delayed unit ramp function,
 
r(t − t0) = 
 
 { 0,
t − t0,   
t ≤ t0
t ≥ t0    
 
 
(7.36)
and for the advanced unit ramp function,
 
r(t + t0) = 
 
 { 0,
t + t0,   t ≤ −t0
t ≥ −t0    
 
 
(7.37)
We should keep in mind that the three singularity functions ( impulse, 
step, and ramp) are related by differentiation as

where a < t0 < b. Since δ(t − t0) = 0 except at t = t0, the integrand is zero

or
 
 ∫

(7.32)
This shows that when a function is integrated with the impulse function, 
we obtain the value of the function at the point where the impulse occurs. 
This is a highly useful property of the impulse function kno
wn as the 
sampling or sifting property. The special case of Eq. (7.31) is for t0 = 0. 
Then Eq. (7.32) becomes
 
 ∫ 
0− 
0+
    f(t) δ(t) dt =  f(0) 
(7.33)
Integrating the unit step function u(t) results in the unit ramp func-
tion r(t); we write
 
r(t) =  ∫

  u(λ)dλ = tu(t) 
(7.34)
or

Although there are many more singularity functions, we are only inter -
ested in these three (the impulse function, the unit step function, and the 
ramp function) at this point.
Gate functions are used along 
with switches to pass or block 
another  signal.

Express the voltage pulse in Fig. 7.31 in terms of the unit step. Calculate 
its derivative and sketch it.
Solution:
The type of pulse in Fig. 7.31 is called the 
gate function. It may be  
regarded as a step function that switches on at one value of 
t and 
switches off at another value of t. The gate function shown in Fig. 7.31 
switches on at t = 2 s and switches off at t = 5 s. It consists of the sum 
of two unit step functions as shown in Fig. 7.32(a). From the figure, it 
is evident that
v(t) = 10u (t − 2) − 10u (t − 5) = 10[u (t − 2) − u (t − 5)]
Taking the derivative of this gives
 dv 
___ 
dt  = 10[δ (t − 2) − δ (t − 5)]
which is shown in Fig. 7.32(b). We can obtain Fig. 7.32(b) directly from 
Fig. 7.31 by simply observing that there is a sudden increase by 10 V at 
t = 2 s leading to 10 δ (t − 2). At t = 5 s, there is a sudden decrease by 
10 V leading to −10V δ (t − 5).

Practice Problem 7.6
Example 7.7
Express the sawtooth function shown in Fig. 7.35 in terms of singularity 
functions.
Solution:
There are three ways of solving this problem. The first method is by mere 
observation of the given function, while the other methods involve some 
graphical manipulations of the function.
■ METHOD 1 By looking at the sketch of v(t) in Fig. 7.35, it is not 
hard to notice that the given function v(t) is a combination of singularity 
functions. So we let
 
v(t) = v1(t) + v2(t) + ⋯ 
(7.7.1)
The function v1(t) is the ramp function of slope 5, shown in Fig. 7.36(a); 
that is,
 
v1(t) = 5r (t) 
(7.7.2)

7.4  Singularity Functions
269
Since v1(t) goes to infinity, we need another function at t = 2s in order to 
get v(t). We let this function be v2, which is a ramp function of slope −5, 
as shown in Fig. 7.36(b); that is,
 
v2(t) = −5r(t − 2) 
(7.7.3)
Adding v1 and v2 gives us the signal in Fig. 7.36(c). Obviously, this is 
not the same as v(t) in Fig. 7.35. But the difference is simply a constant 
10 units for t > 2 s. By adding a third signal v3, where
 
v3 = −10u(t − 2) 
(7.7.4)
we get v(t), as shown in Fig. 7.37. Substituting Eqs. (7.7.2) through 
(7.7.4) into Eq. (7.7.1) gives
v(t) = 5r(t) − 5r(t − 2) − 10u(t − 2)
■ METHOD 2 A close observation of Fig. 7.35 reveals that v(t) is 
a multiplication of two functions: a ramp function and a gate function. 
Thus,
 
v(t) = 5t[u(t) − u(t − 2)]
 
= 5tu(t) − 5tu(t − 2)
 
= 5r(t) − 5(t − 2 + 2)u(t − 2)
 
= 5r(t) − 5(t − 2)u(t − 2) − 10u(t − 2)
 
= 5r(t) − 5r(t − 2) − 10u(t − 2)
the same as before.
■ METHOD 3 This method is similar to Method 2. We observe from 
Fig. 7.35 that v(t) is a multiplication of a ramp function and a unit step 
function, as shown in Fig. 7.38. Thus,
v(t) = 5r(t)u(−t + 2)
If we replace u(−t) by 1 − u(t), then we can replace u(−t + 2) by 1 − u(t − 2). 
Hence,
v(t) = 5r(t)[1 − u(t − 2)]
which can be simplified as in Method 2 to get the same result.

−2,
  2t − 4,
  
 t < 0 
0 < t < 1
 t > 1
   
 
express g(t) in terms of step and ramp functions.
Solution:
The signal g(t) may be regarded as the sum of three functions specified 
within the three intervals t < 0, 0 < t < 1, and t > 1.
 
For t < 0, g(t) may be regarded as 3 multiplied by 
u(−t), where 
u(−t) = 1 for t < 0 and 0 for t > 0. Within the time interval 0 < t < 1, 
the function may be considered as −2 multiplied by a gated function 
[u(t) − u(t − 1)]. For t > 1, the function may be regarded as 2t − 4 mul-
tiplied by the unit step function u(t − 1). Thus,
 
g(t) = 3u(−t) − 2[u(t) − u(t − 1)] + (2t − 4)u(t − 1)
 
= 3u(−t) − 2u(t) + (2t − 4 + 2)u(t − 1)
 
= 3u(−t) − 2u(t) + 2(t − 1)u(t − 1)
 
= 3u(−t) − 2u(t) + 2r(t −1)
One may avoid the trouble of using u(−t) by replacing it with 1 − u(t). 
Then
g(t) = 3[1 − u(t)] − 2u(t) + 2r(t − 1) = 3 − 5u(t) + 2r(t − 1)
Alternatively, we may plot g(t) and apply Method 1 from Example 7.7.

 Step Response of an RC Circuit
When the dc source of an RC circuit is suddenly applied, the voltage or 
current source can be modeled as a step function, and the response is 
known as a step response.
The step response of a circuit is its behavior when the excitation is the 
step function, which may be a voltage or a current source.

272 
Chapter 7  First-Order Circuits
The step response is the response of the circuit due to a sudden applica -
tion of a dc voltage or current source.
Consider the RC circuit in Fig. 7.40(a) which can be replaced by the 
circuit in Fig. 7.40(b), where Vs is a constant dc v oltage source. Again, 
we select the capacitor voltage as the circuit response to be determined. 
We assume an initial v oltage V0 on the capacitor , although this is not 
necessary for the step response. Since the v oltage of a capacitor cannot 
change instantaneously,
 
v(0−) = v( 0 + ) = V0 
(7.40)
where v(0−) is the voltage across the capacitor just before switching and 
v( 0 + ) is its voltage immediately after switching. Applying KCL, we have

This is known as the complete response (or total response) of the RC cir-

evident a little later . Assuming that Vs > V0, a plot of v(t) is sho wn in

rent i(t).
Rather than going through the derivations above, there is a systemat-
ic approach—or rather, a shortcut method—for finding the step response 
of an RC or RL circuit. Let us reexamine Eq. (7.45), which is more gener-
al than Eq. (7.48). It is evident that v(t) has two components. Classically 
there are two ways of decomposing this into tw o components. The first 
is to break it into a “natural response and a forced response’’ and the sec-
ond is to break it into a “transient response and a steady-state response.’’ 
Starting with the natural response and forced response, we write the total 
or complete response as
Complete response =  natural response +  forced response 
 stored energy 
 independent source 
or
v = vn +  v f 
(7.50)
where
vn = Vo  e −t∕τ 
and
 v f = Vs(1 −  e −t∕τ )
We are familiar with the natural response vn of the circuit, as discussed 
in Section 7.2. vf is known as the forced response because it is produced 
by the circuit when an external “force’’ (a voltage source in this case) is 
applied. It represents what the circuit is forced to do by the input excita-
tion. The natural response e ventually dies out along with the transient 
component of the forced response, leaving only the steady-state compo-
nent of the forced response.

Chapter 7  First-Order Circuits
The first decomposition of the complete response is in terms of the 
source of the responses, while the second decomposition is in terms of 
the permanency of the responses. Under certain conditions, the natural 
response and transient response are the same. The same can be said about 
the forced response and steady-state response.
Whichever way we look at it, the complete response in Eq. (7.45) 
may be written as
 
v(t) = v(∞) + [v(0) − v(∞)]  e −t∕τ
 
 
(7.53)
where v(0) is the initial voltage at t =   0 +  and v(∞) is the final or steady-
state value. Thus, to find the step response of an RC circuit requires three 
things:
Another way of looking at the complete response is to break into 
two components—one temporary and the other permanent, that is
Complete response =  transient response +  steady-state response 
 
 temporary part 
 permanent part 
or
v = vt +  v ss 
(7.51)
where
 
vt = (Vo − Vs) e −t∕τ  
(7.52a)
and
 
vss =  V s 
(7.52b)
The transient response vt is temporary; it is the portion of the complete 
response that decays to zero as time approaches infinity. Thus,
The transient response is the circuit’s temporary response that will die 
out with time.
The steady-state response vss is the portion of the complete response 
that remains after the transient reponse has died out. Thus,
The steady-state response is the behavior of the circuit a long time after 
an external excitation is applied.
1. The initial capacitor voltage v(0).
2. The final capacitor voltage v(∞).
3. The time constant τ.
We obtain item 1 from the given circuit for t < 0 and items 2 and 3 from 
the circuit for t > 0. Once these items are determined, we obtain the 
This is the same as saying that the 
complete response is the sum of the 
transient response and the steady-state 
response.
Once we know x (0), x (∞), and τ, 
 almost all the circuit problems in this 
chapter can be solved using the 
 formula
x(t) = x(∞) + [x(0) − x(∞)]  e −t∕τ 

response using Eq. (7.53). This technique equally applies to RL circuits, 
as we shall see in the next section.
Note that if the switch changes position at time t = t0 instead of at 
t = 0, there is a time delay in the response so that Eq. (7.53) becomes
 
v(t) = v(∞) + [v(t0) − v(∞)] e −(t − t0)∕τ  
(7.54)
where v(t0) is the initial value at t = t0
+ . Keep in mind that Eq. (7.53) or 
(7.54) applies only to step responses, that is, when the input e xcitation 
is constant.
Solution:
For t < 0, the switch is at position A. The capacitor acts like an open 
circuit to dc, but v is the same as the voltage across the 5-k Ω resistor. 
Hence, the voltage across the capacitor just before t = 0 is obtained by 
voltage division as
v(0−) =  5 
_____ 
5 + 3  (24) = 15 V
Using the fact that the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously,
v(0) = v(0−) = v( 0 + ) = 15 V
For t > 0, the switch is in position B. The Thevenin resistance connected 
to the capacitor is  R Th = 4 kΩ, and the time constant is
τ =  R Th C = 4 × 103 × 0.5 × 10−3 = 2 s
Since the capacitor acts like an open circuit to dc at steady state, 
v(∞) = 30 V. Thus,
v(t) = v(∞) + [v(0) − v(∞)] e −t∕τ 
 
= 30 + (15 − 30) e −t∕2 = (30 − 15 e −0.5t ) V
At t = 1,
v(1) = 30 − 15 e −0.5 = 20.9 V
At t = 4,
v(4) = 30 − 15e−2 = 27.97 V

Find v(t) for t > 0 in the circuit of Fig. 7.44. Assume the switch has been 
open for a long time and is closed at t = 0. Calculate v(t) at t = 0.5.
Answer: (9.375 + 5.625 e −2t ) V for all t > 0, 11.444 V.
Practice Problem 7.10
Example 7.11
In Fig. 7.45, the switch has been closed for a long time and is opened at 
t = 0. Find i and v for all time.
Solution:
The resistor current i can be discontinuous at t = 0, while the capacitor 
voltage v cannot. Hence, it is always better to find v and then obtain i 
from v.
By definition of the unit step function,
30u(t) =  { 
0,
30,    
t < 0
t > 0
For t < 0, the switch is closed and 30u(t) = 0, so that the 30u(t) voltage 
source is replaced by a short circuit and should be regarded as contribut-
ing nothing to v. Since the switch has been closed for a long time, the 
capacitor voltage has reached steady state and the capacitor acts like an 
open circuit. Hence, the circuit becomes that shown in Fig. 7.46(a) for 
t < 0. From this circuit we obtain
v = 10 V,  
i = −  v 
___ 
10  = −1 A
Since the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously,
v(0) = v(0−) = 10 V
 
For t > 0, the switch is opened and the 10-V voltage source is dis-
connected from the circuit. The 30 u(t) voltage source is now operative, 
so the circuit becomes that shown in Fig. 7.46(b). After a long time, the 
circuit reaches steady state and the capacitor acts like an open circuit 
again. We obtain v(∞) by using voltage division, writing
v(∞) =  
20 
_______ 
20 + 10  (30) = 20 V

The Thevenin resistance at the capacitor terminals is
 R Th = 10∥20 =  10 × 20

= 20 + (10 − 20) e −(3∕5)t = (20 − 10 e −0.6t ) V
To obtain i, we notice from Fig. 7.46(b) that i is the sum of the currents 
through the 20-Ω resistor and the capacitor; that is,
 
i =  v

 Step Response of an RL Circuit
Consider the RL circuit in Fig. 7.48(a), which may be replaced by the 
circuit in Fig. 7.48(b). Again, our goal is to find the inductor current i as 
the circuit response. Rather than apply Kirchhoff’s laws, we will use the 
simple technique in Eqs. (7.50) through (7.53). Let the response be the 
sum of the transient response and the steady-state response,
i = it +  i ss 
(7.55)
We know that the transient response is al ways a decaying e xponential, 
that is,
 
it = A e −t∕τ ,  
τ =  L 
__ 
R  
(7.56)
where A is a constant to be determined.
The steady-state response is the value of the current a long time 
after the switch in Fig. 7.48(a) is closed. We know that the transient 
response essentially dies out after five time constants. At that time,  
the inductor becomes a short circuit, and the v oltage across it is zero. 
The entire source v oltage Vs appears across R. Thus, the steady-state  
response is
 
iss =   V s  
__ 
R  
(7.57)
Substituting Eqs. (7.56) and (7.57) into Eq. (7.55) gives
 
i = A e −t∕τ  +   V s  
__ 
R  
(7.58)
We now determine the constant A from the initial v alue of i. Let I0 be 
the initial current through the inductor, which may come from a source 
other than Vs. Since the current through the inductor cannot change 
 instantaneously,
 
i( 0 + ) = i(0−) = I0 
(7.59)
Thus, at t = 0, Eq. (7.58) becomes
I0 = A +   V s  
__ 
R  
From this, we obtain A as 
A = I0 −   V s  
__ 
R  
Substituting for A in Eq. (7.58), we get
 
i(t) =   V s  
__ 
R  +  ( I0 −   V s  
__ 
R  ) e −t∕τ  
(7.60)
This is the complete response of the
 RL circuit. It is illustrated in 
Fig. 7.49. The response in Eq. (7.60) may be written as
 
i(t) = i(∞) +   [ i(0) − i(∞) ]   e −t∕τ

7.6  Step Response of an RL Circuit

where i(0) and i(∞) are the initial and final values of i, respectively. 
Thus, to find the step response of an RL circuit requires three things:
1. The initial inductor current i(0) at t = 0.
2. The final inductor current i(∞).
3. The time constant τ.
We obtain item 1 from the given circuit for t < 0 and items 2 and 3 from 
the circuit for t > 0. Once these items are determined, we obtain the 
response using Eq. (7.61). Keep in mind that this technique applies only 
for step responses.
Again, if the switching tak
es place at time 
t = t0 instead of  
t = 0, Eq. (7.61) becomes
 
i(t) = i(∞) + [i(t0) − i(∞)] e −(t−t0)∕τ

Find i(t) in the circuit of Fig. 7.51 for t > 0. Assume that the switch has

t = 0. Find i(t) for t > 0.
Answer: (4 + 2 e −10t ) A for all t > 0.
Practice Problem 7.12

Solution:
We need to consider the three time intervals t ≤ 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ 4, and t ≥ 4 
separately. For t < 0, switches S1 and S2 are open so that i = 0. Since the 
inductor current cannot change instantly,
i(0−) = i(0) = i( 0 + ) = 0
 
For 0 ≤ t ≤ 4, S1 is closed so that the 4- and 6- Ω resistors are in 
 series. (Remember, at this time, S2 is still open.) Hence, assuming for 
now that S1 is closed forever,
i(∞) =  40 
_____ 
4 + 6  = 4 A,  
 R Th = 4 + 6 = 10 Ω

= 4 + (0 − 4) e −2t = 4(1 −  e −2t ) A,  
0 ≤ t ≤ 4
 
For t ≥ 4, S2 is closed; the 10-V voltage source is connected, and the 
circuit changes. This sudden change does not affect the inductor current 
because the current cannot change abruptly. Thus, the initial current is
i(4) = i(4−) = 4(1 − e−8) ≃ 4 A

 † First-Order Op Amp Circuits
An op amp circuit containing a storage element will exhibit first-order 
behavior. Differentiators and integrators treated in Section 6.6 are exam-
ples of first-order op amp circuits. Again, for practical reasons, inductors 
are hardly ever used in op amp circuits; therefore, the op amp circuits we 
consider here are of the RC type.
As usual, we analyze op amp circuits using nodal analysis. Some -
times, the Thevenin equivalent circuit is used to reduce the op amp cir-
cuit to one that we can easily handle. The following three examples 
illustrate the concepts. The first one deals with a source-free op amp 
circuit, while the other two involve step responses. The three examples 
have been carefully selected to co ver all possible RC types of op amp 
circuits, depending on the location of the capacitor with respect to the  
op amp; that is, the capacitor can be located in the input, the output, or  
the feedback loop.

Solution:
This problem can be solved in two ways:

v(t) = V0  e −t∕τ ,  
τ = R1C 
(7.14.3)
where V0 is the initial voltage across the capacitor. But v(0) = 3 = V0 and 
τ = 20 × 103 × 5 × 10−6 = 0.1. Hence,
 
v(t) = 3 e −10t

For the op amp circuit in Fig. 7.55(a), find vo for t > 0, gi ven that

Chapter 7  First-Order Circuits
■ METHOD 2 Let us apply the shortcut method from Eq. (7.53). We 
need to find vo( 0 + ), vo(∞), and τ. Since v(  0 + ) = v(0−) = 3 V, we apply 
KCL at node 2 in the circuit of Fig. 7.55(b) to obtain
 
3 
______ 
20,000  +  0 − vo( 0 + ) 
_________ 
80,000  = 0
or vo( 0 + ) = 12 V. Since the circuit is source free, v(∞) = 0 V. To find τ, 
we need the equivalent resistance Req across the capacitor terminals. If 
we remove the capacitor and replace it by a 1-A current source, we have 
the circuit shown in Fig. 7.55(c). Applying KVL to the input loop yields
20,000(1) − v = 0  
⇒  
v = 20 kV
Then
Req =  v 
__ 1  = 20 kΩ
and τ = ReqC = 0.1. Thus,
vo(t) = vo(∞) + [vo(0) − vo(∞)] e −t∕τ 
 
= 0 + (12 − 0) e −10t = 12 e −10t V,  
t > 0
as before.

For the op amp circuit in Fig. 7.56, find vo for t > 0 if v(0) = 4 V. Assume

Answer: −4 e −2t V, t > 0.
Practice Problem 7.14
Example 7.15
Determine v(t) and vo(t) in the circuit of Fig. 7.57.
Solution:
This problem can be solved in two ways, just like the previous example. 
However, we will apply only the second method. Since what we are 
looking for is the step response, we can apply Eq. (7.53) and write
 
v(t) = v(∞) + [v(0) − v(∞)]  e −t∕τ ,  
t > 0 
(7.15.1)

where we need only find the time constant τ, the initial value v(0), and 
the final value v(∞). Notice that this applies strictly to the capacitor volt-
age due a step input. Since no current enters the input terminals of the 
op amp, the elements on the feedback loop of the op amp constitute an  
RC circuit, with
τ = RC = 50 × 103 × 10−6 = 0.05 
(7.15.2)
For t < 0, the switch is open and there is no voltage across the capacitor. 
Hence, v(0) = 0. For t > 0, we obtain the voltage at node 1 by voltage 
division as
 
v1 =  
20 
_______ 
20 + 10  3 = 2 V 
(7.15.3)
Since there is no storage element in the input loop, v1 remains constant 
for all t. At steady state, the capacitor acts like an open circuit so that the 
op amp circuit is a noninverting amplifier. Thus,
 
vo(∞) =  ( 1 +  50 
___ 
20  ) v1 = 3.5 × 2 = 7 V 
(7.15.4)
But
 
v1 − vo = v 
(7.15.5)
so that
v(∞) = 2 − 7 = −5 V
Substituting τ, v(0), and v(∞) into Eq. (7.15.1) gives
v(t) = −5 + [0 − (−5)] e −20t = 5( e −20t − 1) V,  
t > 0 
(7.15.6)
From Eqs. (7.15.3), (7.15.5), and (7.15.6), we obtain
 
vo(t) = v1(t) − v(t) = 7 − 5 e −20t V,  
t > 0

vo(t) = −2.5(1 −  e −t∕τ )u(t)
where τ =  R Th C = 5 × 103 × 2 × 10−6 = 0.01. Thus, the step response

Notice that the capacitor in Example 7.14 is located in the input loop,

we can solve this problem directly using nodal analysis. However, using

 Transient Analysis with PSpice
As we discussed in Section 7.5, the transient response is the temporary 
response of the circuit that soon disappears. PSpice can be used to obtain 
the transient response of a circuit with storage elements. Section D.4 
in Appendix D provides a review of transient analysis using PSpice for 
Windows. It is recommended that you read Section D.4 before continu-
ing with this section.
If necessary, dc PSpice analysis is first carried out to determine the 
initial conditions. Then the initial conditions are used in the transient 
PSpice analysis to obtain the transient responses. It is rec om mended but 
not necessary that during this dc analysis, all capac  itors should be open-
circuited while all inductors should be short-circuited.
PSpice uses “transient” to mean 
“function of time.” Therefore, the 
transient response in PSpice may not 
actually die out as expected.

Practice Problem 7.16
Example 7.17
Use PSpice to find the response i(t) for t > 0 in the circuit of Fig. 7.63.
Solution:
Solving this problem by hand gives 
i(0) = 0, i(∞) = 2A,  R Th = 6, 
τ = 3∕6 = 0.5 s, so that
i(t) = i(∞) + [i(0) − i(∞)] e −t∕τ  = 2(1 −  e −2t ),  
t > 0
 
To use PSpice, we first draw the schematic as shown in Fig. 7.64. 
We recall from Appendix D that the part name for a closed switch is 
Sw_tclose. We do not need to specify the initial condition of the induc -
tor because PSpice will determine that from the circuit. By selecting 
Analysis/Setup/Transient, we set Print Step to 25 ms and Final Step to 
5τ = 2.5 s. After saving the circuit, we simulate by selecting Analysis/
Simulate. In the PSpice A/D window, we select Trace/Add and display 
–I(L1) as the current through the inductor. Figure 7.65 shows the plot of 
i(t), which agrees with that obtained by hand calculation.

288 
Chapter 7  First-Order Circuits
Note that the negative sign on I(L1) is needed because the current 
enters through the upper terminal of the inductor, which happens to be 
the negative terminal after one counterclock
 wise  rotation. A way to 
avoid the negative sign is to ensure that current enters pin 1 of the induc-
tor. To obtain this desired direction of positive current flow, the initially 
horizontal inductor symbol should be rotated counterclockwise 270° and 
placed in the desired location.

For the circuit in Fig. 7.66, use Pspice to find v(t) for t > 0.
Answer: v(t) = 8(1 − e−t) V, t > 0. The response is similar in shape to 
that in Fig. 7.65.
Practice Problem 7.17
In the circuit of Fig. 7.67(a), determine the response v(t).
Example 7.18

Solution:
1. Define. The problem is clearly stated and the circuit is clearly 
labeled.
2. Present. Given the circuit shown in Fig. 7.67(a), determine the 
response v(t).
3. Alternative. We can solve this circuit using circuit analysis 
techniques, nodal analysis, mesh analysis, or PSpice. Let us solve 
the problem using circuit analysis techniques (this time Thevenin 
equivalent circuits) and then check the answer using two methods 
of PSpice.
4. Attempt. For time < 0, the switch on the left is open and the 
switch on the right is closed. Assume that the switch on the right 
has been closed long enough for the circuit to reach steady state; 
then the capacitor acts like an open circuit and the current from the 
4-A source flows through the parallel combination of the 6-Ω and 
3-Ω resistors (6 ∥ 3 = 18∕9 = 2), producing a voltage equal to  
2 × 4 = 8 V = −v(0).
  
At t = 0, the switch on the left closes and the switch on 
the right opens, producing the circuit shown in Fig. 7.67(b).
  
The easiest way to complete the solution is to find the 
Thevenin equivalent circuit as seen by the capacitor. The open-
circuit voltage (with the capacitor removed) is equal to the volt-
age drop across the 6-Ω resistor on the left, or 10 V (the voltage 
drops uniformly across the 12-Ω resistor, 20 V, and across the 6-Ω 
resistor, 10 V). This is  V Th . The resistance looking in where the 
capacitor was is equal to 12 ∥ 6 + 6 = 72∕18 + 6 = 10 Ω, which 
is Req. This produces the Thevenin equivalent circuit shown in 
Fig. 7.67(c). Matching up the boundary conditions (v(0) = −8 V 
and v(∞) = 10 V) and τ = RC = 1, we get
v(t) = 10 − 18e−t V
5. Evaluate. There are two ways of solving the problem using 
PSpice.
■ METHOD 1 
One way is to first do the dc PSpice analysis to 
determine the initial capacitor voltage. The schematic of the revelant 
circuit is in Fig. 7.68(a). Two pseudocomponent VIEWPOINTs are
 
inserted to measure the voltages at nodes 1 and 2. When the circuit 
is simulated, we obtain the displayed values in Fig. 7.68(a) as 
V1 = 
0 V and V2 = 8 V. Thus, the initial capacitor voltage is v(0) = V1 − V2 
= −8 V. The PSpice transient analysis uses this value along with the  
schematic in Fig. 7.68(b). Once the circuit in Fig. 7.68(b) is drawn, 
we insert the capacitor initial voltage as IC  = −8. We select Analysis/
Setup/Transient and set Print Step to 0.1 s and Final Step to 4τ = 4 s. 
After saving the circuit, we select Analysis/Simulate to simulate the  
circuit. In the PSpice A/D window, we select Trace/Add and display  
V(R2:2) – V(R3:2) or V(C1:1) − V(C1:2) as the capacitor voltage v(t). 
The plot of v(t) is shown in Fig. 7.69. This agrees with the result ob -
tained by hand calculation, v(t) = 10 − 18 e −t V.

290 
Chapter 7  First-Order Circuits
■ METHOD 2 We can simulate the circuit in Fig. 7.67 directly, 
since PSpice can handle the open and closed switches and determine 
the initial conditions automatically. Using this approach, the schemat -
ic is drawn as shown in Fig. 7.70. After drawing the circuit, we select 
 Analysis/Setup/Transient and set Print Step to 0.1 s and Final Step to 
4τ = 4 s. We save the circuit, then select Analysis/Simulate to simulate 
the circuit. In the PSpice A/D window, we select Trace/Add and display 
V(R2:2) − V(R3:2) as the capacitor voltage v(t). The plot of v(t) is the 
same as that shown in Fig. 7.69.

 †Applications
The various devices in which RC and RL circuits find applications include 
filtering in dc power supplies, smoothing circuits in digital communica-
tions, differentiators, integrators, delay circuits, and relay circuits. Some 
of these applications take advantage of the short or long time constants 
of the RC or RL circuits. We will consider four simple applications here. 
The first two are RC circuits, the last two are RL circuits.
7.9.1  Delay Circuits
An RC circuit can be used to pro vide various time delays. Figure 7.73 
shows such a circuit. It basically consists of an  RC circuit with the ca -
pacitor connected in parallel with a neon lamp. The voltage source can 
provide enough voltage to fire the lamp. When the switch is closed, the 
capacitor voltage increases gradually toward 110 V at a rate determined 
by the circuit’s time constant, (R1 + R2)C. The lamp will act as an open

circuit and not emit light until the voltage across it exceeds a particular 
level, say 70 V. When the voltage level is reached, the lamp fires (goes 
on), and the capacitor dischar ges through it. Due to the lo w resistance 
of the lamp when on, the capacitor voltage drops fast and the lamp turns 
off. The lamp acts again as an open circuit and the capacitor recharges. 
By adjusting R2, we can introduce either short or long time delays into 
the circuit and mak e the lamp fire, recharge, and fire repeatedly every 
time constant τ = (R1 + R2)C, because it takes a time period τ to get the 
capacitor voltage high enough to fire or low enough to turn off.
The warning blinkers commonly found on road construction sites 
are one example of the usefulness of such an RC delay circuit.
Example 7.19
Consider the circuit in Fig. 7.73, and assume that R1 = 1.5 MΩ, 0 < 
R2 < 2.5 MΩ. (a) Calculate the extreme limits of the time constant of 
the circuit. (b) How long does it take for the lamp to glow for the first 
time after the switch is closed? Let R2 assume its largest value.
Solution:
(a) The smallest value for R2 is 0 Ω, and the corresponding time constant 
for the circuit is
τ = (R1 + R2)C = (1.5 × 106 + 0) × 0.1 × 10−6 = 0.15 s
The largest value for R2 is 2.5 MΩ, and the corresponding time constant 
for the circuit is
τ = (R1 + R2)C = (1.5 + 2.5) × 106 × 0.1 × 10−6 = 0.4 s
Thus, by proper circuit design, the time constant can be adjusted to intro-
duce a proper time delay in the circuit.
(b) Assuming that the capacitor is initially uncharged,   v C (0) = 0, while  
v C (∞) = 110. But
vC(t) = vC (∞) + [vC(0) − vC (∞)] e −t∕τ  = 110[1 −  e −t∕τ ]
where τ = 0.4 s, as calculated in part (a). The lamp glows when vC = 70 V. 
If vC(t) = 70 V at t = t0, then
70 = 110[1 −  e −t0∕τ ]  
⇒

11  = 1 −  e −t0∕τ 
or
 e −t0∕τ =  4

___ 
4  
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives
t0 = τ ln  11 
___ 
4  = 0.4 ln 2.75 = 0.4046 s
 
A more general formula for finding t0 is
t0 = τ ln  
−v(∞) 
___________ 
v(t0) − v(∞)  
The lamp will fire repeatedly every t0 seconds if and only if v(t0) < v(∞).

7.9.2  Photoflash Unit
An electronic flash unit provides a common e xample of an  RC circuit. 
This application exploits the ability of the capacitor to oppose any abrupt 
change in voltage. Figure 7.75 shows a simplified circuit. It consists es-
sentially of a high-voltage dc supply, a current-limiting large resistor R1, 
and a capacitor C in parallel with the flashlamp of low resistance R2. 
When the switch is in position 1, the capacitor charges slowly due to the 
large time constant ( τ1 = R1C). As shown in Fig. 7.76(a), the capacitor 
voltage rises gradually from zero to Vs, while its current decreases gradu-
ally from I1 = Vs∕R1 to zero. The charging time is approximately five 
times the time constant,
 
tcharge = 5R1C 
(7.65)
With the switch in position 2, the capacitor v oltage is dischar ged. The 
low resistance R2 of the photolamp permits a high discharge  current with 
peak I2 = Vs∕R2 in a short duration, as depicted in Fig. 7.76(b). Discharg-
ing takes place in approximately five times the time constant,

Practice Problem 7.20
Example 7.20
An electronic flashgun has a current-limiting 6-kΩ resistor and 2000-μF 
electrolytic capacitor charged to 240 V. If the lamp resistance is 12 Ω, 
find: (a) the peak charging current, (b) the time required for the capaci -
tor to fully charge, (c) the peak discharging current, (d) the total energy 
stored in the capacitor, and  the average power dissipated by the lamp.
Solution:

circuit is an  RL circuit like that in Fig. 7.77(b), where R and L are the 
resistance and inductance of the coil. When switch S1 in Fig. 7.77(a) is 
closed, the coil circuit is energized. The coil current gradually increases 
and produces a magnetic field. Eventually the magnetic field is suffi-
ciently strong to pull the mo vable contact in the other circuit and close 
switch S2. At this point, the relay is said to be pulled in. The time interval 
td between the closure of switches S1 and S2 is called the relay delay time.
Relays were used in the earliest digital circuits and are still used for 
switching high-power circuits.

The coil of a certain relay is operated by a 12-V battery. If the coil has a 
resistance of 150 Ω and an inductance of 30 mH and the current needed 
to pull in is 50 mA, calculate the relay delay time.
Solution:
The current through the coil is given by
i(t) = i(∞) + [i(0) − i(∞)] e −t∕τ 
where
i(0) = 0,  
i(∞) =  12

R  =  30 ×  10 −3  
_________ 
150

Thus,
i(t) = 80[1 −  e −t∕τ ] mA
If i(td) = 50 mA, then
50 = 80[1 −  e −td∕τ ]

7.9.4  Automobile Ignition Circuit
The ability of inductors to oppose rapid change in current mak es them 
useful for arc or spark generation. An automobile ignition system tak es 
advantage of this feature.
The g asoline engine of an automobile requires that the fuel-air
 
mixture in each c ylinder be ignited at proper times. 
This is achie ved 
by means of a spark plug (Fig. 7.78), which essentially consists of a
 
pair of electrodes separated by an air g ap. By creating a lar ge voltage 
(thousands of v olts) between the electrodes, a spark is formed across
 
the air g ap, thereby igniting the fuel. But ho w can such a lar ge volt-
age be obtained from the car battery, which supplies only 12 V? This is 
achieved by means of an inductor (the spark coil) L. Since the v oltage 
across the inductor is v = L di∕dt, we can make di∕dt large by creating 
a large change in current in a very short time. When the ignition switch 
in Fig. 7.78 is closed, the current through the inductor increases gradu -
ally and reaches the final value of i = Vs∕R, where Vs = 12 V. Again, the 
time taken for the inductor to char ge is five times the time constant of 
the circuit (τ = L∕R),
 
tcharge = 5  L 
__ 
R  
(7.67)
Since at steady state, i is constant, di∕dt = 0, and the inductor v oltage 
v = 0. When the switch suddenly opens, a lar ge voltage is de veloped 
across the inductor (due to the rapidly collapsing field) causing a spark 
or arc in the air g ap. The spark continues until the ener gy stored in the 
inductor is dissipated in the spark dischar ge. In laboratories, when one 
is working with inductive circuits, this same ef fect causes a v ery nasty 
shock, and one must exercise caution.

 Summary
1. The analysis in this chapter is applicable to an y circuit that can be 
reduced to an equi valent circuit comprising a resistor and a single 
energy-storage element (inductor or capacitor). Such a circuit is 
first-order because its behavior is described by a first-order differen-
tial equation. When analyzing RC and RL circuits, one must always 
keep in mind that the capacitor is an open circuit to steady-state dc 
conditions while the inductor is a short circuit to steady-state dc 
conditions.
2. The natural response is obtained when no independent source is 
present. It has the general form
x(t) = x(0) e −t∕τ 
  
where x represents current through (or voltage across) a resistor, 
a capacitor, or an inductor, and x(0) is the initial value of x. Be-
cause most practical resistors, capacitors, and inductors always have 
 losses, the natural response is a transient response, i.e. it dies out 
with time. 
3. The time constant τ is the time required for a response to decay to 
1∕e of its initial value. For RC circuits, τ = RC and for RL circuits, 
τ = L∕R.
Example 7.22
A solenoid with resistance 4 Ω and inductance 6 mH is used in an auto-
mobile ignition circuit similar to that in Fig. 7.78. If the battery supplies 
12 V, determine: the final current through the solenoid when the switch 
is closed, the energy stored in the coil, and the voltage across the air gap, 
assuming that the switch takes 1 μs to open.
Solution:
The final current through the coil is
I =   V s  
__ 
R  =  12 
___ 
4  = 3 A
The energy stored in the coil is
W =  1 
__ 2  L I2 =  1 
__ 
2   × 6 × 10−3 × 32 = 27 mJ
The voltage across the gap is

Practice Problem 7.22
The spark coil of an automobile ignition system has a 20-mH induc
-
tance and a 5-Ω resistance. With a supply voltage of 12 V, calculate: the 
time needed for the coil to fully charge, the energy stored in the coil, and 
the voltage developed at the spark gap if the switch opens in 2 μs.
Answer: 20 ms, 57.6 mJ, and 24 kV.

tion, and the unit impulse functions. The unit step function u(t) is

The unit ramp function is

t ≤ 0
t ≥ 0
5. The steady-state response is the beha vior of the circuit after an in -
dependent source has been applied for a long time. 
The transient 
response is the component of the complete response that dies out 
with time.
6. The total or complete response consists of the steady-state response 
and the transient response.
7. The step response is the response of the circuit to a sudden applica-
tion of a dc current or v oltage. Finding the step response of a first-
order circuit requires the initial v alue x(  0 + ), the final value x(∞), 
and the time constant τ. With these three items, we obtain the step 
response as
x(t) = x(∞) + [x( 0 + ) − x(∞)] e −t∕τ 
  
A more general form of this equation is
x(t) = x(∞) + [x( t + 0) − x(∞)] e −(t−t0)∕τ 
  
Or we may write it as
  
 
Instantaneous value = Final + [Initial − Final] e −(t−t0)∕τ 
8. PSpice is very useful for obtaining the transient response of a circuit.

Section 7.9  Applications
7.82 In designing a signal-switching circuit, it was found 
that a 100-µF capacitor was needed for a time con-
stant of 3 ms. What value resistor is necessary for 
the circuit?
7.83 An RC circuit consists of a series connection of a 
120-V source, a switch, a 34-MΩ resistor, and a 15-µF 
capacitor. The circuit is used in estimating the speed 
of a horse running a 4-km racetrack. The switch closes 
when the horse begins and opens when the horse 
crosses the finish line. Assuming that the capacitor 
charges to 85.6 V, calculate the speed of the horse.
7.84 A capacitor with a value of 10 mF has a leakage 
 resistance of 2 MΩ. How long does it take the voltage 
across the capacitor to decay to 40% of the initial volt-
age to which the capacitor is charged? Assume that 
the capacitor is charged and then set aside by itself.
7.85 A simple relaxation oscillator circuit is shown in 
Fig. 7.145. The neon lamp fires when its voltage 
reaches 75 V and turns off when its voltage drops to 
30 V. Its resistance is 120 Ω when on and infinitely 
high when off.
(a)  For how long is the lamp on each time the capaci-
tor discharges?
(b) What is the time interval between light flashes?
7.86 Figure 7.146 shows a circuit for setting the length of 
time voltage is applied to the electrodes of a welding 
machine. The time is taken as how long it takes the 
capacitor to charge from 0 to 8 V. What is the time 
range covered by the variable resistor?
7.87 A 120-V dc generator energizes a motor whose coil 
has an inductance of 50 H and a resistance of 100 Ω. 
A field discharge resistor of 400 Ω is connected in 
parallel with the motor to avoid damage to the mo-
tor, as shown in Fig. 7.147. The system is at steady 
state. Find the current through the discharge resistor 
100 ms after the breaker is tripped.
7.88 The circuit in Fig. 7.148(a) can be designed as 
an approximate differentiator or an integrator, 
depending on whether the output is taken across 
the resistor or the capacitor, and also on the time 
constant τ = RC of the circuit and the width T of 
the input pulse in Fig. 7.148(b). The circuit is a 
differentiator if τ ≪ T, say τ < 0.1T, or an integra-
tor if τ ≫ T, say τ > 10T.
(a)  What is the minimum pulse width that will al-
low a differentiator output to appear across the 
capacitor?
(b)  If the output is to be an integrated form of the in-
put, what is the maximum value the pulse width 
can assume?

7.89 An RL circuit may be used as a differentiator if the 
output is taken across the inductor and τ ≪ T (say  
τ < 0.1T), where T is the width of the input pulse. If 
R is fixed at 200 kΩ, determine the maximum value 
of L required to differentiate a pulse with T = 10 µs.
7.90 An attenuator probe employed with oscilloscopes 
was designed to reduce the magnitude of the input 
voltage vi by a factor of 10. As shown in Fig. 7.149, 
the oscilloscope has internal resistance Rs and 
capacitance Cs, while the probe has an internal re-
sistance Rp. If Rp is fixed at 6 MΩ, find Rs and Cs for 
the circuit to have a time constant of 15 µs.
7.91 The circuit in Fig. 7.150 is used by a biology student 
to study “frog kick.” She noticed that the frog kicked 
a little when the switch was closed but kicked vio-
lently for 5 s when the switch was opened. Model the 
frog as a resistor and calculate its resistance. Assume 
that it takes 10 mA for the frog to kick violently.

Everyone who can earn a masters degree in engineering must earn a

Enhancing Your Career
To increase your engineering career opportunities after graduation, 
 
develop a strong fundamental understanding in a broad set of engineer -
ing areas. When possible, this might best be accomplished by working 
toward a graduate degree immediately upon receiving your undergradu-
ate degree.
Each de gree in engineering represents certain skills the student 
 
acquires. At the Bachelor de gree level, you learn the language of engi -
neering and the fundamentals of engineering and design. At the Master’s 
level, you acquire the ability to do advanced engineering projects and to 
communicate your work effectively both orally and in writing. The Ph.D. 
represents a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of electrical 
engineering and a mastery of the skills necessary both for w
orking at 
the frontiers of an engineering area and for communicating one’ s effort 
to others.
If you have no idea what career you should pursue after graduation, 
a graduate de gree program will enhance your ability to e xplore career 
options. Since your undergraduate degree will only provide you with the 
fundamentals of engineering, a Master’ s degree in engineering supple -
mented by business courses benefits more engineering students than does 
getting a Master’s of Business Administration (MBA). The best time to 
get your MB A is after you ha ve been a practicing engineer for some 
years and decide your career path would be enhanced by strengthening 
your business skills.
Engineers should constantly educate themselv
es, formally and  
informally, taking advantage of all means of education. Perhaps there is 
no better way to enhance your career than to join a professional society 
such as IEEE and be an active member.
Enhancing your career involves under-
standing your goals, adapting to changes, 
anticipating opportunities, and planning 
your own niche.

Chapter 8  Second-Order Circuits
8.1
 Introduction
In the previous chapter we considered circuits with a single storage ele-
ment (a capacitor or an inductor). Such circuits are first-order because 
the differential equations describing them are first-order. In this chap -
ter we will consider circuits containing two storage elements. These are 
known as second-order circuits because their responses are described by 
differential equations that contain second derivatives.
Typical e xamples of second-order circuits are 
RLC circuits, in 
which the three kinds of passive elements are present. Examples of such 
circuits are shown in Fig. 8.1(a) and (b). Other examples are RL and RC 
circuits, as shown in Fig. 8.1(c) and (d). It is apparent from Fig. 8.1 that 
a second-order circuit may have two storage elements of different type or 
the same type (provided elements of the same type cannot be represented 
by an equi valent single element). An op amp circuit with tw o storage 
elements may also be a second-order circuit. As with first-order circuits, 
a second-order circuit may contain se veral resistors and dependent and 
independent sources.
A second-order circuit is characterized by a second-order differential 
equation. It consists of resistors and the equivalent of two energy storage 
elements.
Our analysis of second-order circuits will be similar to that used for
 
first-order. We will first consider circuits that are excited by the initial 
conditions of the storage elements. Although these circuits may contain 
dependent sources, they are free of independent sources. These source-
free circuits will give natural responses as expected. Later we will con-
sider circuits that are e xcited by independent sources. These circuits 
will give both the transient response and the steady-state response. We 
consider only dc independent sources in this chapter. The case of sinu-
soidal and exponential sources is deferred to later chapters.
We begin by learning ho w to obtain the initial conditions for the 
circuit variables and their deri vatives, as this is crucial to analyzing 
second-order circuits. Then we consider series and parallel RLC cir-
cuits such as shown in Fig. 8.1 for the two cases of excitation: by initial

circuits. We will consider PSpice analysis of second-order circuits.  
Finally, we will consider the automobile ignition system and smooth -

 Finding Initial and Final Values
Perhaps the major problem students f
ace in handling second-order 
circuits is finding the initial and final conditions on circuit variables. 
Students are usually comfortable getting the initial and final values of 
v and i but often have difficulty finding the initial values of their deriva-
tives: dv∕dt and di∕dt. For this reason, this section is e xplicitly devoted 
to the subtleties of getting v(0), i(0), dv(0)∕dt, di(0)∕dt, i(∞), and v(∞). 
Unless otherwise stated in this chapter
, v denotes capacitor v oltage, 
while i is the inductor current.
There are two key points to keep in mind in determining the initial 
conditions.
First—as always in circuit analysis—we must carefully handle the
 
polarity of voltage v(t) across the capacitor and the direction of the current 
i(t) through the inductor. Keep in mind that v and i are defined strictly ac-
cording to the passive sign convention (see Figs. 6.3 and 6.23). One should 
carefully observe how these are defined and apply them accordingly.
Second, keep in mind that the capacitor voltage is always continu-
ous so that
 
v(0+) = v(0−) 
(8.1a)
and the inductor current is always continuous so that
 
i(0+) = i(0−) 
(8.1b)
where t = 0− denotes the time just before a switching event and t = 0+ is 
the time just after the switching event, assuming that the switching event 
takes place at t = 0.
Thus, in finding initial conditions, we first focus on those variables 
that cannot change abruptly, capacitor voltage and inductor current, by 
applying Eq. (8.1). The following examples illustrate these ideas.

The switch in Fig. 8.2 has been closed for a long time. It is open at t = 0. 
Find: (a) i(0+), v(0+), (b) di(0+)∕dt, dv(0+)∕dt, (c) i(∞), v(∞).
Solution:
(a) If the switch is closed a long time before t = 0, it means that the cir-
cuit has reached dc steady state at t = 0. At dc steady state, the inductor 
acts like a short circuit, while the capacitor acts like an open circuit, so 
we have the circuit in Fig. 8.3(a) at t = 0−. Thus,
i(0−) =  12 
_____ 
4 + 2    = 2 A,  
v(0−) = 2i(0−) = 4 V

314 
Chapter 8  Second-Order Circuits
As the inductor current and the capacitor voltage cannot change abruptly,
i(0+) = i(0−) = 2 A,  
v(0+) = v(0−) = 4 V
(b) At t = 0+, the switch is open; the equivalent circuit is as shown in  
Fig. 8.3(b). The same current flows through both the inductor and ca-
pacitor. Hence,
iC(0+) = i(0+) = 2 A
Since C dv∕dt = iC, dv∕dt = iC∕C, and
   dv(0+) 
______ 
dt    =  iC (0+) 
_____ 
C    =  2 
___ 
0.1    = 20 V/s
Similarly, since L di∕dt = vL, di∕dt = vL∕L. We now obtain vL by apply-
ing KVL to the loop in Fig. 8.3(b). The result is
−12 + 4i(0+) + vL(0+) + v(0+) = 0
or
vL(0+) = 12 − 8 − 4 = 0
Thus,
   di(0+) 
_____ 
dt    =  vL(0+) 
______ 
L    =  0 
____ 
0.25    = 0 A/s
(c) For t > 0, the circuit undergoes transience. But as t → ∞, the circuit 
reaches steady state again. The inductor acts like a short circuit and the 
capacitor like an open circuit, so that the circuit in Fig. 8.3(b) becomes 
that shown in Fig. 8.3(c), from which we have
i(∞) = 0 A,  
v(∞) = 12 V

Solution:

state, the inductor can be replaced by a short circuit, while the capacitor 
is replaced by an open circuit as shown in Fig. 8.6(a). From this figure 
we obtain
 
iL(0−) = 0,  
vR(0−) = 0,  
vC(0−) = − 20 V 
(8.2.1)
Although the derivatives of these quantities at t = 0− are not required, it 
is evident that they are all zero, since the circuit has reached steady state 
and nothing changes.

For t > 0, 3u(t) = 3, so that the circuit is no w equivalent to that

iL(0+) = iL(0−) = 0,  
vC (0+) = vC (0−) = −20 V 
(8.2.2)
Although the voltage across the 4-Ω resistor is not required, we will use 
it to apply KVL and KCL; let it be called vo. Applying KCL at node a in

Chapter 8  Second-Order Circuits
Since vC (0+) = −20 V from Eq. (8.2.2), Eq. (8.2.4) implies that
 
vR(0+) = vo(0+) 
(8.2.5)
From Eqs. (8.2.3) and (8.2.5), we obtain
 
vR(0+) = vo(0+) = 4 V

_____

 The Source-Free Series RLC Circuit
An understanding of the natural response of the series RLC circuit is a 
necessary background for future studies in filter design and communica-
tions networks.
Consider the series RLC circuit sho wn in Fig. 8.8. The circuit is 
being excited by the energy initially stored in the capacitor and inductor. 
The energy is represented by the initial capacitor v oltage V0 and initial 
inductor current I0. Thus, at t = 0,

(8.4)
This is a second-order differential equation and is the reason for calling 
the RLC circuits in this chapter second-order circuits. Our goal is to solve 
Eq. (8.4). To solve such a second-order dif ferential equation requires 
that we have two initial conditions, such as the initial v alue of i and its 
first derivative or initial values of some i and v. The initial value of i is 
given in Eq. (8.2b). We get the initial v alue of the deri vative of i from  
Eqs. (8.2a) and (8.3); that is,
Ri(0) + L   di(0)

dt    + V0 = 0
or
 
   di(0) 
_____

__

(8.5)
With the two initial conditions in Eqs. (8.2b) and (8.5), we can no w 
solve Eq. (8.4). Our e xperience in the preceding chapter on first-order 
circuits suggests that the solution is of exponential form. So we let
 
i = Aest 
(8.6)
where A and s are constants to be determined. Substituting Eq. (8.6) into 
Eq. (8.4) and carrying out the necessary differentiations, we obtain
As2est +  AR

___ 
LC   est = 0
or
 
Aest  (s2 +  R

(8.7)
Since i = Aest is the assumed solution we are trying to find, only the  
expression in parentheses can be zero:

LC    = 0 
(8.8)
This quadratic equation is kno wn as the characteristic equation of the 
differential Eq. (8.4), since the roots of the equation dictate the character 
of i. The two roots of Eq. (8.8) are

(8.11)
The roots s1 and s2 are called natural frequencies, measured in nepers 
per second (Np/s), because they are associated with the natural response 
of the circuit; ω0 is kno wn as the resonant frequency or strictly as the 
undamped natural frequency, expressed in radians per second (rad/s); 
and α is the neper frequency expressed in nepers per second. In terms of 
α and ω0, Eq. (8.8) can be written as
 
s2 + 2αs + ω0
2 = 0 
(8.8a)
The variables s and ω0 are important quantities we will be discussing 
throughout the rest of the text.
The two values of s in Eq. (8.10) indicate that there are two possible 
solutions for i, each of which is of the form of the assumed solution in 
Eq. (8.6); that is,
 
i1 = A1es1t,  
i2 = A2es2t 
(8.12)
Since Eq. (8.4) is a linear equation, an y linear combination of the tw o 
distinct solutions i1 and i2 is also a solution of Eq. (8.4). A complete or 
total solution of Eq. (8.4) would therefore require a linear combination of 
i1 and i2. Thus, the natural response of the series RLC circuit is
 
i(t) = A1es1t + A2es2t 
(8.13)
where the constants A1 and A2 are determined from the initial values i(0) 
and di(0)∕dt in Eqs. (8.2b) and (8.5).
From Eq. (8.10), we can infer that there are three types of solutions:
1. If α > ω0, we have the overdamped case.
2. If α = ω0, we have the critically damped case.
3. If α < ω0, we have the underdamped case.
We will consider each of these cases separately.
Overdamped Case (α > ω0)
From Eqs. (8.9) and (8.10), α > ω0 implies C > 4L∕R2. When this hap-
pens, both roots s1 and s2 are negative and real. The response is
 
i(t) = A1es1t + A2es2t
 
(8.14)
which decays and approaches zero as t increases. Figure 8.9(a) illustrates 
a typical overdamped response.
Critically Damped Case (α = ω0)
When α = ω0, C = 4L∕R2 and
 
s1 = s2 = − α = − R 
___ 
2L    
(8.15)
The neper (Np) is a dimensionless unit 
named after John Napier (1550–1617), 
a Scottish mathematician.
The response is overdamped when 
the roots of the circuit’s characteristic 
equation are unequal and real, critically 
damped when the roots are equal and 
real, and underdamped when the 
roots are complex.
The ratio α/ω0 is known as the damping 
ratio ζ.

Chapter 8  Second-Order Circuits
For this case, Eq. (8.13) yields
i(t) = A1e−αt + A2e−αt = A3e−αt
where A3 = A1 + A2 . This cannot be the solution, because the two initial 
conditions cannot be satisfied with the single constant A3. What then 
could be wrong? Our assumption of an e
xponential solution is incor -
rect for the special case of critical damping. Let us go back to Eq. (8.4). 
When α = ω0 = R∕2L, Eq. (8.4) becomes
   d2i 
___ 
dt2    + 2α di 
__ 
dt    + α2i = 0
or
 
   d 
__ 
dt    ( di

__ 
dt  + αi) = 0 
(8.16)
If we let
 
f =  di 
__ 
dt    + αi 
(8.17)
then Eq. (8.16) becomes
   df 
__ 
dt    + αf = 0
which is a first-order differential equation with solution f = A1e−αt, where 
A1 is a constant. Equation (8.17) then becomes
   di 
__ 
dt    + αi = A1e−αt
or
 
eαt   di 
__ 
dt    + eαtαi = A1 
(8.18)
This can be written as
 
   d 
__ 
dt   (eαti) = A1 
(8.19)
Integrating both sides yields
eαti = A1t + A2
or
 
i = (A1t + A2)e−αt 
(8.20)
where A2 is another constant. Hence, the natural response of the critically 
damped circuit is a sum of two terms: a negative exponential and a nega-
tive exponential multiplied by a linear term, or
 
i(t) = (A2 + A1t)e−αt
 
(8.21)
A typical critically damped response is sho
wn in Fig. 8.9(b). In f
act, 
Fig. 8.9(b) is a sk etch of i(t) = te−αt, which reaches a maximum v alue of 
e−1∕α at t = 1∕α, one time constant, and then decays all the way to zero.

2 − α2   , which is called the damped  frequency. 
Both ω0 and ωd are natural frequencies because they help determine the 
natural response; while ω0 is often called the 
undamped natur al fre-
quency, ωd is called the damped natural frequency. The  natural response 
is
 
i(t) = A1e−(α−jωd)t + A2e−(α + jωd)t 
 
= e−αt(A1e−jωd t + A2e−jωdt) 
(8.23)
Using Euler’s identities,
 
e jθ = cos θ + j sin θ,  
e−jθ = cos θ − j sin θ 
(8.24)
we get
 
i(t) = e−αt[A1(cos ωd t + j sin ωd t) + A2(cos ωd t − j sin ωd t)]
 
 = e−αt[(A1 + A2) cos ωdt + j(A1 − A2) sin ωd t] 
(8.25)
Replacing constants ( A1 + A2) and j(A1 − A2) with constants B1 and B2, 
we write
 
i(t) = e−αt(B1 cos ωdt + B2 sin ωdt)
 
(8.26)
With the presence of sine and cosine functions, it is clear that the
 
natural response for this case is e xponentially damped and oscillatory 
in nature. The response has a time constant of 1
∕α and a period of  
T = 2π∕ωd. Figure 8.9(c) depicts a typical underdamped response. Part 
(a) and (b) of Fig. 8.9 assume for each case that i(0) = 0.
Once the inductor current i(t) is found for the RLC series circuit as 
shown above, other circuit quantities such as indi vidual element voltages 
can easily be found. F or example, the resistor voltage is vR = Ri, and the 
inductor voltage is vL = L di∕dt. The inductor current i(t) is selected as the 
key variable to be determined first in order to take advantage of Eq. (8.1b).
We conclude this section by noting the following interesting, pecu-
liar properties of an RLC network:
1. The behavior of such a network is captured by the idea of  damping, 
which is the gradual loss of the initial stored ener gy, as evidenced 
by the continuous decrease in the amplitude of the response. The 
damping effect is due to the presence of resistance 
R. The neper 
frequency α determines the rate at which the response is damped. 
If R = 0, then α = 0, and we have an LC circuit with 1∕  √
___ 
LC    as the 
undamped natural frequency. Since α < ω0 in this case, the response 
is not only undamped b ut also oscillatory. The circuit is said to be 
loss-less, because the dissipating or damping element (R) is absent. 
By adjusting the value of R, the response may be made undamped, 
overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped.
2. Oscillatory response is possible due to the presence of the tw
o 
types of storage elements. Ha ving both L and C allows the flow 
R = 0 produces a perfectly sinusoidal 
response. This response cannot be 
practically accomplished with L and C 
because of the inherent losses in them. 
See Figs 6.8 and 6.26. An electronic 
device called an oscillator can 
produce a perfectly sinusoidal 
response.
The response of a second-order circuit 
with two storage elements of the same 
type, as in Fig. 8.1(c) and (d), cannot 
be oscillatory.
Examples 8.5 and 8.7 demonstrate the 
effect of varying R.

exhibited by the underdamped response is kno
wn as ringing. It 
stems from the ability of the storage elements L and C to transfer 
energy back and forth between them.
3. Observe from Fig. 8.9 that the w aveforms of the responses dif fer. 
In general, it is dif ficult to tell from the waveforms the dif ference 
between the overdamped and critically damped responses. The criti-
cally damped case is the borderline between the underdamped and 
overdamped cases and it decays the fastest. With the same  initial con-
ditions, the overdamped case has the longest settling time,  because 
it  takes the longest time to dissipate the initial stored 
 energy. If 
we desire the response that approaches the final value most rapidly 
without oscillation or ringing, the critically damped circuit is the 
right choice.
Example 8.3
What this means in most practical 
circuits is that we seek an overdamped 
circuit that is as close as possible to 
a critically damped circuit.
In Fig. 8.8, R = 40 Ω, L = 4 H, and C = 1∕4 F. Calculate the charac -
teristic roots of the circuit. Is the natural response o verdamped, under-
damped, or critically damped?

Since α > ω0, we conclude that the response is overdamped. This is also 
evident from the fact that the roots are real and negative.
If R = 10 Ω, L = 5 H, and C = 2 mF in Fig. 8.8, find α, ω0, s1, and s2. What 
type of natural response will the circuit have?

Practice Problem 8.3
Find i(t) in the circuit of Fig. 8.10. Assume that the circuit has reached 
steady state at t = 0−.
Solution:
For t < 0, the switch is closed. The capacitor acts like an open circuit 
while the inductor acts like a shunted circuit. The equivalent circuit is 
shown in Fig. 8.11(a). Thus, at t = 0,
i(0) =  10 
_____

where i(0) is the initial current through the inductor and v(0) is the initial 
voltage across the capacitor.
For t > 0, the switch is opened and the v oltage source is discon -
nected. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 8.11(b), which is a source- 
free series RLC circuit. Notice that the 3-Ω and 6-Ω resistors, which are 
in series in Fig. 8.10 when the switch is opened, have been com bined to 
give R = 9 Ω in Fig. 8.11(b). The roots are calculated as follows:

Hence, the response is underdamped (α < ω); that is,
i(t) = e−9t(A1 cos 4.359t + A2 sin 4.359 t) 
(8.4.1)
We now obtain A1 and A2 using the initial conditions. At t = 0,

Note that v(0) = V0 = −6 V is used, because the polarity of v in Fig. 8.11(b) 
is opposite that in Fig. 8.8. Taking the derivative of i(t) in Eq. (8.4.1),

Imposing the condition in Eq. (8.4.3) at t = 0 gives
 −6 = −9(A1 + 0) + 4.359( −0 + A2)
But A1 = 1 from Eq. (8.4.2). Then
 −6 = −9 + 4.359A2  
⇒  
A2 = 0.6882
Substituting the values of A1 and A2 in Eq. (8.4.1) yields the com -

 The Source-Free Parallel RLC Circuit

The names of these terms remain the same as in the preceding section, 
as they play the same role in the solution. Again, there are three possible 
solutions, depending on whether α > ω0, α = ω0, or α < ω0. Let us con-
sider these cases separately.
Overdamped Case (α > ω0)
From Eq. (8.32), α > ω0 when L > 4R2C. The roots of the characteristic 
equation are real and negative. The response is
 
v(t) = A1es1t + A2es2t
 
(8.33)
Critically Damped Case (α = ω0)
For α = ω0, L = 4R2C. The roots are real and equal so that the response is
 
v(t) = (A1 + A2t)e−αt
 
(8.34)
Underdamped Case (α < ω0)
When α < ω0, L < 4R2C. In this case the roots are complex and may be 
expressed as
 
s1,2 = −α ± jωd 
(8.35)
where
 
ωd =  √
_______ 
 ω 0 
2 − α2    
(8.36)
The response is
 
v(t) = e−αt(A1 cos ωdt + A2 sin ωdt)
 
(8.37)
The constants A1 and A2 in each case can be determined from the 
initial conditions. We need v(0) and dv(0)∕dt. The first term is known 
from Eq. (8.27b). We find the second term by combining Eqs. (8.27) and 
(8.28), as

The voltage waveforms are similar to those sho wn in Fig. 8.9 and will 
depend on whether the circuit is overdamped, underdamped, or critically 
damped.
Having found the capacitor voltage v(t) for the parallel RLC cir-
cuit as shown above, we can readily obtain other circuit quantities such  
as indi vidual element currents. F or e xample, the resistor current is 
 
iR = v∕R and the capacitor current is iC = C dv∕dt. We have selected the 
capacitor voltage v(t) as the key variable to be determined first in order 
to take advantage of Eq. (8.1a). Notice that we first found the inductor 
current i(t) for the RLC series circuit, whereas we first found the capaci-
tor voltage v(t) for the parallel RLC circuit.

In the parallel circuit of Fig. 8.13, find v(t) for t > 0, assuming v(0) = 5 V,

Substituting A1 and A2 in Eq. (8.5.1) yields

(8.40)
which has the same form as Eq. (8.4). More specifically, the coefficients 
are the same (and that is important in determining the frequency param-
eters) but the variable is different. (Likewise, see Eq. (8.47).) Hence, the 
characteristic equation for the series RLC circuit is not af fected by the 
presence of the dc source.
The solution to Eq. (8.40) has two components: the transient re-
sponse vt(t) and the steady-state response vss(t); that is,
 
v(t) = vt(t) + vss(t) 
(8.41)
The transient response vt(t) is the component of the total response that 
dies out with time. The form of the transient response is the same as the 
form of the solution obtained in Section 8.3 for the source-free circuit, 
given by Eqs. (8.14), (8.21), and (8.26). Therefore, the transient response 
vt(t) for the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped cases are:
 
vt(t) = A1es1t + A2es2t  
 (Overdamped) 
(8.42a)
 
vt(t) = (A1 + A2t)e−αt  
 (Critically damped) 
(8.42b)
 
vt(t) = (A1 cos ωdt + A2 sin ωdt)e−αt  
 (Underdamped) 
(8.42c)
The steady-state response is the final value of v(t). In the circuit in 
Fig. 8.18, the final value of the capacitor voltage is the same as the source 
voltage Vs. Hence,
 
vss(t) = v(∞) = Vs 
(8.43)
Thus, the complete solutions for the o
verdamped, underdamped, and 
critically damped cases are:
 
v(t) = Vs + A1es1t + A2es2t  
(Overdamped) 
(8.44a)
 
v(t) = Vs + (A1 + A2t)e−αt  
(Critically damped) 
(8.44b)
 v(t) = Vs + (A1 cos ωdt + A2 sin ωdt)e−αt (Underdamped) 
(8.44c)
The values of the constants A1 and A2 are obtained from the initial condi-
tions: v(0) and dv(0)∕dt. Keep in mind that v and i are, respectively, the 
voltage across the capacitor and the current through the inductor. There-
fore, Eq. (8.44) only applies for finding v. But once the capacitor voltage 
vC = v is known, we can determine i = C dv∕dt, which is the same current 
through the capacitor, inductor, and resistor. Hence, the v oltage across 
the resistor is vR = iR, while the inductor voltage is vL = L di∕dt.
Alternatively, the complete response for any variable x(t) can be 
found directly, because it has the general form
 
x(t) = xss(t) + xt(t) 
(8.45)
where the xss = x(∞) is the final value and xt(t) is the transient response. 
The final value is found as in Section 8.2. The transient response has the 
same form as in Eq. (8.42), and the associated constants are determined 
from Eq. (8.44) based on the values of x(0) and dx(0)∕dt.

For the circuit in Fig. 8.19, find v(t) and i(t) for t > 0. Consider these 
cases: R = 5 Ω, R = 4 Ω, and R = 1 Ω.
Solution:
■ CASE 1  When R = 5 Ω. For t < 0, the switch is closed for a long 
time. The capacitor behaves like an open circuit while the inductor 
acts like a short circuit. The initial current through the inductor is
i(0) =  24 
_____ 
5 + 1    = 4 A
and the initial voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage 
across the 1-Ω resistor; that is,
v(0) = 1i(0) = 4 V
For t > 0, the switch is opened, so that we ha
ve the 1- Ω resistor 
disconnected. What remains is the series RLC circuit with the v oltage 
source. The characteristic roots are determined as follows:

_______

Since α > ω0, we have the overdamped natural response. The total 
 response is therefore
v(t) = vss + (A1e−t + A2e−4t)
where vss is the steady-state response. It is the final value of the capacitor 
voltage. In Fig. 8.19, vf = 24 V. Thus,
 
v(t) = 24 + (A1e−t + A2e−4t) 
(8.7.1)
We now need to find A1 and A2 using the initial conditions.
v(0) = 4 = 24 + A1 + A2
or
 
 −20 = A1 + A2 
(8.7.2)
The current through the inductor cannot change abruptly and is the same 
current through the capacitor at t = 0+ because the inductor and capacitor 
are now in series. Hence,
i(0) = C    dv(0)

Chapter 8  Second-Order Circuits
From Eqs. (8.7.2) and (8.7.4), A1 = −64∕3 and A2 = 4∕3. Substituting A1
and A2 in Eq. (8.7.1), we get
 
v(t) = 24 +  4 
__ 3   (−16e−t + e−4t) V 
(8.7.5)
Since the inductor and capacitor are in series for t > 0, the inductor 
current is the same as the capacitor current. Hence,
i(t) = C    dv 
___ 
dt   
Multiplying Eq. (8.7.3) by C = 0.25 and substituting the values of A1
and A2 gives
 
i(t) =  4 
__ 3   (4e−t − e−4t) A 
(8.7.6)
Note that i(0) = 4 A, as expected.
■ CASE 2  When R = 4 Ω. Again, the initial current through the 
 inductor is
i(0) =  24 
_____ 
4 + 1    = 4.8 A
and the initial capacitor voltage is
v(0) = 1i(0) = 4.8 V
For the characteristic roots,
α =  R 
___ 
2L    =  4 
_____ 
2 × 1    = 2
while ω0 = 2 remains the same. In this case, s1 = s2 = −α = −2, and 
we have the critically damped natural response. The total response is 
therefore
v(t) = vss + (A1 + A2t)e−2t
and, as before vss = 24 V,
 
v(t) = 24 + (A1 + A2t)e−2t 
(8.7.7)
To find A1 and A2, we use the initial conditions. We write
 
v(0) = 4.8 = 24 + A1  
⇒  
A1 = −19.2 
(8.7.8)
Since i(0) = C dv(0)∕dt = 4.8 or
   dv(0) 
_____ 
dt    =  4.8 
___ 
C    = 19.2
From Eq. (8.7.7),
  
  dv

(8.7.9)
At t = 0,
  
  dv(0) 
_____ 
dt    = 19.2 = −2A1 + A2 
(8.7.10)

From Eqs. (8.7.8) and (8.7.10), 
A1 = −19.2 and A2 =  −19.2. Thus, 
Eq. (8.7.7) becomes
 
v(t) = 24 − 19.2(1 + t)e−2t V 
(8.7.11)
 
The inductor current is the same as the capacitor current; that is,
i(t) = C    dv 
___ 
dt   
Multiplying Eq. (8.7.9) by C = 0.25 and substituting the values of A1
and A2 gives
i(t) = (4.8 + 9.6t)e−2t A
(8.7.12)
Note that i(0) = 4.8 A, as expected.
■ CASE 3  When R = 1 Ω. The initial inductor current is
i(0) =  24 
_____ 
1 + 1    = 12 A
and the initial voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage 
across the 1-Ω resistor,
v(0) = 1i(0) = 12 V
α =  R 
___ 
2L    =  1 
_____ 
2 × 1    = 0.5
Since α = 0.5 < ω0 = 2, we have the underdamped response
s1,2 = −α ±   √
_______ 
α2 − ω0
2    = −0.5 ± j1.936
The total response is therefore
 
v(t) = 24 + (A1 cos 1.936t + A2 sin 1.936t)e−0.5t 
(8.7.13)
We now determine A1 and A2. We write
 
v(0) = 12 = 24 + A1  
⇒  
A1 = −12 
(8.7.14)
Since i(0) = C dv(0)∕dt = 12,
  
  dv(0) 
_____ 
dt    =  12

C    = 48 
(8.7.15)

(8.7.16)
At t = 0,
   dv(0) 
_____ 
dt    = 48 = (−0 + 1.936A2) − 0.5(A1 + 0)
Substituting A1 = −12 gives A2 = 21.694, and Eq. (8.7.13) becomes
 
v(t) = 24 + (21.694 sin 1.936t − 12 cos 1.936t)e−0.5t V

Note that i(0) = 12 A, as expected.

which has the same characteristic equation as Eq. (8.29).
The complete solution to Eq. (8.47) consists of the transient  response 
it(t) and the steady-state response iss; that is,
 
i(t) = it(t) + iss(t) 
(8.48)
The transient response is the same as what we had in Section 8.4. 
The 
steady-state response is the final value of i. In the circuit in Fig. 8.22, the 
final value of the current through the inductor is the same as the source 
current Is. Thus,
i(t) = Is + A1es1t + A2es2t (Overdamped)
i(t) = Is + (A1 + A2t)e−αt (Critically damped)
i(t) = Is + (A1 cos ωdt + A2 sin ωdt)e−αt (Underdamped)
 (8.49)
The constants A1 and A2 in each case can be determined from the  initial 
conditions for i and di∕dt. Again, we should keep in mind that Eq. (8.49) 
only applies for finding the inductor current i. But once the inductor cur-
rent iL = i is known, we can find v = L di∕dt, which is the same v oltage 
across inductor, capacitor, and resistor . Hence, the current through the  
resistor is iR = v∕R, while the capacitor current is iC = C dv∕dt. Alterna-
tively, the complete response for any variable x(t) may be found directly, 
using
 
x(t) = xss(t) + xt(t) 
(8.50)
where xss and xt are its final value and transient response, respectively.

Chapter 8  Second-Order Circuits
Since 30u(− t) = 30 when t < 0 and 0 when t > 0, the voltage source is 
operative for t < 0. The capacitor acts like an open circuit and the voltage 
across it is the same as the voltage across the 20-Ω resistor connected in 
parallel with it. By voltage division, the initial capacitor voltage is
v(0) =  
20 
_______ 
20 + 20   (30) = 15 V
For t > 0, the switch is closed, and we ha ve a parallel RLC circuit 
with a current source. The voltage source is zero which means it acts 
like a short-circuit. The two 20-Ω resistors are no w in parallel. They 
are combined to give R = 20 ‖ 20 = 10 Ω. The characteristic roots are

Since α > ω0, we have the overdamped case. Hence,
 
i(t) = Is + A1e−11.978t + A2e−0.5218t
(8.8.1)
where Is = 4 is the final value of i(t). We now use the initial conditions to

 General Second-Order Circuits
Now that we have mastered series and parallel RLC circuits, we are pre-
pared to apply the ideas to any second-order circuit having one or more 
independent sources with constant values. Although the series and paral-
lel RLC circuits are the second-order circuits of greatest interest, other 
second-order circuits including op amps are also useful. Given a second-
order circuit, we determine its step response x(t) (which may be voltage 
or current) by taking the following four steps:
1. We first determine the initial conditions x(0) and dx(0)∕dt and the 
final value x(∞), as discussed in Section 8.2.
2. We turn off the independent sources and find the form of the transient 
response xt(t) by applying KCL and KVL. Once a second-order differ-
ential equation is obtained, we determine its characteristic roots. De-
pending on whether the response is overdamped, critically damped, 
or underdamped, we obtain xt(t) with two unknown constants as we 
did in the previous sections.
3. We obtain the steady-state response as
 
xss(t) = x(∞) 
(8.51)
where x(∞) is the final value of x, obtained in step 1.
4. The total response is now found as the sum of the transient response 
and steady-state response
 
x(t) = xt(t) + xss(t) 
(8.52)
 We finally determine the constants associated with the transient re-
sponse by imposing the initial conditions x(0) and dx(0)∕dt, deter-
mined in step 1.
We can apply this general procedure to find the step response of 
any second-order circuit, including those with op amps. The following 
examples illustrate the four steps.
 A circuit may look complicated at first. 
But once the sources are turned off in 
an attempt to find the form of the 
transient response, it may be reducible 
to a first-order circuit, when the storage 
elements can be combined, or to a 
parallel/series RLC circuit. If it is 
reducible to a first-order circuit, the 
solution becomes simply what we had 
in Chapter 7. If it is reducible to a 
parallel or series RLC  circuit, we apply 
the techniques of previous sections in 
this chapter.
 Problems in this chapter can also be 
solved by using Laplace transforms, 
which are covered in Chapters 15 
and 16.

Practice Problem 8.8
Find the complete response v and then i for t > 0 in the circuit of Fig. 8.25.
Solution:
We first find the initial and final values. At t = 0−, the circuit is at steady 
state. The switch is open; the equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 8.26(a). 
It is evident from the figure that
v(0−) = 12 V,  
i(0−) = 0
At t = 0+, the switch is closed; the equivalent circuit is in Fig. 8.26(b). By 
the continuity of capacitor voltage and inductor current, we know that
 
v(0+) = v(0−) = 12 V,  
i(0+) = i(0−) = 0 
(8.9.1)

Chapter 8  Second-Order Circuits
To get dv(0+)∕dt, we use C dv∕dt = iC or  dv∕dt = iC∕C. Applying KCL

_____ 
4 + 2    = 2 A,

(8.9.3)
Next, we obtain the form of the transient response for t > 0. By turn-
ing off the 12-V voltage source, we have the circuit in Fig. 8.27. Apply-

From this, we obtain the characteristic equation as
s2 + 5s + 6 = 0
with roots s = −2 and s = −3. Thus, the natural response is
 
vn(t) = Ae−2t + Be−3t 
(8.9.6)
where A and B are unknown constants to be determined later. The steady-
state response is
 
vss(t) = v(∞) = 4 
(8.9.7)
The complete response is
 
v(t) = vt + vss = 4 + Ae−2t + Be−3t 
(8.9.8)
We now determine A and B using the initial values. From Eq. (8.9.1), 
v(0) = 12. Substituting this into Eq. (8.9.8) at t = 0 gives
 
12 = 4 + A + B

This is an example of a second-order circuit with two inductors. We 
first obtain the mesh currents i1 and i2, which happen to be the currents 
through the inductors. We need to obtain the initial and final values of 
these currents.
For t < 0, 7u(t) = 0, so that i1(0−) = 0 = i2(0−). For t > 0, 7u(t) = 7, so 
that the equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 8.30(a). Due to the continuity 
of inductor current,
 
i1(0+) = i1(0−) = 0,  
i2(0+) = i2(0−) = 0 
(8.10.1)
 
vL2(0+) = vo(0+) = 1[(i1(0+) − i2(0+)] = 0 
(8.10.2)
Applying KVL to the left loop in Fig. 8.30(a) at t = 0+,
7 = 3i1(0+) + vL1(0+) + vo(0+)

As t → ∞, the circuit reaches steady state, and the inductors can be

Next, we obtain the form of the transient responses by removing the

 Second-Order Op Amp Circuits
An op amp circuit with tw o storage elements that cannot be combined 
into a single equivalent element is second-order. Because inductors are 
bulky and heavy, they are rarely used in practical op amp circuits. F or 
this reason, we will only consider RC second-order op amp circuits here. 
Such circuits find a wide range of applications in devices such as filters 
and oscillators.
The analysis of a second-order op amp circuit follows the same four 
steps given and demonstrated in the previous section.
The use of op amps in second-order 
circuits avoids the use of inductors, 
which are undesirable in some 
 applications.
Example 8.11
In the op amp circuit of Fig. 8.33, find vo(t) for t > 0 when vs = 10u(t) mV. 
Let R1 = R2 = 10 kΩ, C1 = 20 μF, and C2 = 100 μF.

Solution:
Although we could follow the same four steps given in the previous sec-
tion to solve this problem, we will solve it a little differently. Due to 
the voltage follower configuration, the voltage across C1 is vo. Applying

ing Eqs. (8.11.2) and (8.11.3) into Eq. (8.11.1) yields

___ 
dt    + 5vo = 5vs 
(8.11.7)
To obtain the form of the transient response, set vs = 0 in Eq. (8.11.7), which 
is the same as turning off the source. The characteristic equation is
s2 + 2s + 5 = 0
which has complex roots s1,2 =  −1 ±  j2. Hence, the form of the transient 
response is
 
vot = e−t(A cos 2t + B sin 2t) 
(8.11.8)
where A and B are unknown constants to be determined.
As t → ∞, the circuit reaches the steady-state condition, and the  
capacitors can be replaced by open circuits. Since no current flows through 
C1 and C2 under steady-state conditions and no current can enter the  input 
terminals of the ideal op amp, current does not flow through R1 and R2.
Thus,
vo(∞) = v1(∞) = vs
The steady-state response is then
 
voss = vo(∞) = vs = 10 mV,  
t > 0 
(8.11.9)
The complete response is
 
vo(t) = vot + voss = 10 + e−t(A cos 2t + B sin 2t) mV 
(8.11.10)
To determine A and B, we need the initial conditions. For t < 0, vs = 0, 
so that
vo(0−) = v2(0−) = 0
For t > 0, the source is operative. However, due to capacitor voltage 
continuity,
 
vo(0+) = v2(0+) = 0 
(8.11.11)
From Eq. (8.11.3),
v1(0+) = v2(0+) + vo(0+) = 0
and, hence, from Eq. (8.11.2),
 
  dvo(0+)

0 = 10 + A  
⇒  
A = −10

0 = −A + 2B 
(8.11.14)
From Eqs. (8.11.13) and (8.11.14), A = −10 and B = −5. Thus, the step 
response becomes
vo(t) = 10 − e−t(10 cos 2t + 5 sin 2t) mV,

 PSpice Analysis of RLC Circuits
RLC circuits can be analyzed with great ease using PSpice, just like the 
RC or RL circuits of Chapter 7. The following two examples will illus-
trate this. The reader may review Section D.4 in Appendix D on PSpice 
for transient analysis.
The input voltage in Fig. 8.35(a) is applied to the circuit in Fig. 8.35(b). 
Use PSpice to plot v(t) for 0 < t < 4 s.
Solution:
1. Define. As true with most textbook problems, the problem is 
clearly defined.
2. Present. The input is equal to a single square wave of amplitude 
12 V with a period of 2 s. We are asked to plot the output, using 
PSpice.
3. Alternative. Since we are required to use PSpice, that is the only 
alternative for a solution. However, we can check it using the tech-
nique illustrated in Section 8.5 (a step response for a series RLC 
circuit).
4. Attempt. The given circuit is drawn using Schematics as in 
Fig. 8.36. The pulse is specified using VPWL voltage source, 
but VPULSE could be used instead. Using the piecewise  linear 
function, we set the attributes of VPWL as T1 = 0, V1 = 0, 
T2 = 0.001, V2 = 12, and so forth, as shown in Fig. 8.36. Two 
voltage markers are inserted to plot the input and output voltages. 
Once the circuit is drawn and the attributes are set, we select  
Analysis/Setup/Transient to open up the Transient Analysis 
dialog box. As a parallel RLC circuit, the roots of the characteris-
tic equation are  −1 and −9. Thus, we may set Final Time as 4 s 
(four times the magnitude of the lower root). When the schematic

is saved, we select Analysis/Simulate and obtain the plots for the 
input and output voltages under the PSpice A/D window as shown 
in Fig. 8.37.

Now we check using the technique from Section 8.5. We can 
start by realizing the Thevenin equivalent for the resistor-source 
combination is VTh = 12∕2 (the open circuit voltage divides 
equally across both resistors) = 6 V. The equivalent resistance is 
30 Ω (60 ‖ 60). Thus, we can now solve for the response using  
R = 30 Ω, L = 3 H, and C = (1∕27) F.
  
We first need to solve for α and ω0:
α = R∕(2L) = 30∕6 = 5  
and  
ω0 =  1

v(0) = 0 = A1 + A2 + 6
 
i(0) = 0 = C(−A1 − 9A2)
 
which yields A1 = −9A2. Substituting this into the above, we get 
0 = 9A2 − A2 + 6, or A2 = 0.75 and A1 = −6.75.
v(t) = (−6.75e−t + 0.75e−9t + 6)u(t) V for all 0 < t < 2 s.
 
At t = 1 s, v(1) = −6.75e−1 + 0.75e−9 + 6 = −2.483 + 0.0001  
+ 6 = 3.552 V. At t = 2 s, v(2) = −6.75e−2 + 0 + 6 = 5.086 V.
  
Note that from 2 < t < 4 s, VTh = 0, which implies that  
v(∞) = 0. Therefore, v(t) = (A3e−(t − 2) + A4e−9(t − 2))u(t − 2) V. 
 
At t = 2 s, A3 + A4 = 5.086.
i(t) =  (− A3e−(t − 2) − 9A4e−9(t − 2))

Therefore,  −A3 − 9A4 = 0.9135.
  
Combining the two equations, we get −A3 − 9(5.086 − A3) = 
0.9135, which leads to A3 = 5.835 and A4 = −0.749.
v(t) = (5.835e−(t − 2) − 0.749e−9(t − 2)) u(t − 2) V
 
At t = 3 s, v(3) = (2.147 − 0) = 2.147 V. At t = 4 s, v(4) =

5. Evaluate. A check between the values calculated above and the 
plot shown in Figure 8.37 shows good agreement within the  
obvious level of accuracy.
6. Satisfactory? Yes, we have agreement and the results can be 
 presented as a solution to the problem.

Practice Problem 8.12
Find i(t) using PSpice for 0 < t < 4 s if the pulse voltage in Fig. 8.35(a) is 
applied to the circuit in Fig. 8.38.
Answer: See Fig. 8.39.
For the circuit in Fig. 8.40, use PSpice to obtain i(t) for 0 < t < 3 s.
Example 8.13
Solution:
When the switch is in position 
a, the 6- Ω resistor is redundant. The  
schematic for this case is shown in Fig. 8.41(a). To ensure that current  

i(t) enters pin 1, the inductor is rotated three times before it is placed in the 
circuit. The same applies for the capacitor. We insert pseudo  -components 
VIEWPOINT and IPROBE to determine the initial capac itor voltage and 
initial inductor current. We carry out a dc 
PSpice analysis by select -
ing Analysis/Simulate. As shown in Fig. 8.41(a), we obtain the initial 
capacitor voltage as 0 V and the initial inductor current i(0) as 4 A from 
the dc analysis. These initial values will be used in the transient analysis.
When the switch is moved to position b, the circuit becomes a source-
free parallel RLC circuit with the schematic in Fig. 8.41(b). We set the 
initial condition IC = 0 for the capacitor and IC = 4 A for the inductor. 
A current marker is inserted at pin 1 of the inductor. We select Analysis/ 
Setup/Transient to open up the 
Transient Analysis  dialog box and 
set Final Time to 3 s. After saving the schematic, we select Analysis/ 
Transient. Figure 8.42 sho ws the plot of i(t). The plot agrees with 
i(t) = 4.8e−t − 0.8e−6t A, which is the solution by hand calculation.

 Duality
The concept of duality is a time-sa
ving, effort-effective measure of  
solving circuit problems. Consider the similarity between Eqs. (8.4)  
and (8.29). The two equations are the same, except that we must inter-
change the following quantities: (1) voltage and current, (2) resistance 
and conductance, (3) capacitance and inductance. Thus, it sometimes 
occurs in circuit analysis that two different circuits have the same equa-
tions and solutions, except that the roles of certain complementary 
elements are interchanged. This interchangeability is kno wn as the  
principle of duality.
The duality principle asserts a parallelism between pairs of characterizing 
equations and theorems of electric circuits.
Dual pairs are sho wn in Table 8.1. Note that po wer does not appear in 
Table 8.1, because power has no dual. The reason for this is the principle 
of linearity; since power is not linear, duality does not apply. Also notice 
from Table 8.1 that the principle of duality extends to circuit elements, 
configurations, and theorems.
Two circuits that are described by equations of the same form, b
ut 
in which the variables are interchanged, are said to be dual to each other.
Two circuits are said to be duals of one another if they are described 
by the same characterizing equations with dual quantities interchanged.
The usefulness of the duality principle is self-e
vident. Once we 
know the solution to one circuit, we automatically ha
ve the solution 
for the dual circuit. It is ob vious that the circuits in Figs. 8.8 and 8.13 
are dual. Consequently , the result in Eq. (8.32) is the dual of that in 
Eq. (8.11). We must k eep in mind that the method described here for 
finding a dual is limited to planar circuits. Finding a dual for a nonplanar 
circuit is beyond the scope of this te xtbook because nonplanar circuits 
cannot be described by a system of mesh equations.
To find the dual of a given circuit, we do not need to write do wn 
the mesh or node equations. We can use a graphical technique. Gi ven a 
planar circuit, we construct the dual circuit by taking the following three 
steps:
1. Place a node at the center of each mesh of the given circuit. Place 
the reference node (the ground) of the dual circuit outside the given 
circuit.
2. Draw lines between the nodes such that each line crosses an ele-
ment. Replace that element by its dual (see Table 8.1).
3. To determine the polarity of voltage sources and direction of current 
sources, follow this rule: A voltage source that produces a positi ve 
(clockwise) mesh current has as its dual a current source whose refer-
ence direction is from the ground to the nonreference node.
In case of doubt, one may verify the dual circuit by writing the nodal or 
mesh equations. The mesh (or nodal) equations of the original  circuit are 
similar to the nodal (or mesh) equations of the dual circuit. The duality 
principle is illustrated with the following two examples.
Even when the principle of linearity 
 applies, a circuit element or variable 
may not have a dual. For example, 
 mutual inductance (to be covered in 
Chapter 13) has no dual.

Construct the dual of the circuit in Fig. 8.44.
Solution:
As shown in Fig. 8.45(a), we first locate nodes 1 and 2 in the two meshes 
and also the ground node 0 for the dual circuit. We draw a line between 
one node and another crossing an element. We replace the line joining 
the nodes by the duals of the elements which it crosses. For example, a 
line between nodes 1 and 2 crosses a 2-H inductor, and we place a 2-F 
capacitor (an inductor’s dual) on the line. A line between nodes 1 and 
0 crossing the 6-V voltage source will contain a 6-A current source. By 
drawing lines crossing all the elements, we construct the dual circuit 
on the given circuit as in Fig. 8.45(a). The dual circuit is redrawn in 
Fig. 8.45(b) for clarity.

To v erify the polarity of the v

the current source, we may apply mesh currents i1, i2, and i3 (all in the 
clockwise direction) in the original circuit in Fig. 8.48. The 10-V voltage 
source produces positive mesh current i1, so that its dual is a 10-A cur-
rent source directed from 0 to 1. Also, i3 = −3 A in Fig. 8.48 has as its 
dual v3 = −3 V in Fig. 8.49(b).

8.11 Applications

 Applications
Practical applications of RLC circuits are found in control and commu-
nications circuits such as ringing circuits, peaking circuits, resonant cir-
cuits, smoothing circuits, and filters. Most of these circuits cannot be 
covered until we treat ac sources. For now, we will limit ourselves to two 
simple applications: automobile ignition and smoothing circuits.
8.11.1  Automobile Ignition System
In Section 7.9.4, we considered the automobile ignition system as a 
charging system. That was only a part of the system. Here, we consider 
another part—the voltage generating system. The system is modeled by 
the circuit shown in Fig. 8.52. The 12-V source is due to the battery 
and alternator. The 4-Ω resistor represents the resistance of the wiring. 
The ignition coil is modeled by the 8-mH inductor . The 1-μF capacitor 
(known as the condenser to automechanics) is in parallel with the switch 
(known as the breaking points or electronic ignition). In the follo wing 
example, we determine how the RLC circuit in Fig. 8.52 is used in gen -
erating high voltage.

Assuming that the switch in Fig. 8.52 is closed prior to t = 0−, find the 
inductor voltage vL for t > 0.
Solution:
If the switch is closed prior to t = 0− and the circuit is in steady state, then
i(0−) =  12 
___ 
4    = 3 A,  
vC(0−) = 0
At t = 0+, the switch is opened. The continuity conditions require that
 
i(0+) = 3 A,  
vC(0+) = 0 
(8.16.1)
We obtain di(0+)/dt from vL(0+). Applying KVL to the mesh at t = 0+
yields
 −12 + 4i(0+) + vL(0+) + vC(0+) = 0
 −12 + 4 × 3 + vL(0+) + 0 = 0  
⇒  
vL(0+) = 0
Example 8.16

352 
Chapter 8  Second-Order Circuits
Hence,
 
  di(0+) 
_____ 
dt    =  vL(0+) 
______ 
L    = 0 
(8.16.2)
As t → ∞, the system reaches steady state, so that the capacitor acts like 
an open circuit. Then
 
i(∞) = 0 
(8.16.3)
If we apply KVL to the mesh for t > 0, we obtain

(8.16.4)
We obtain the form of the transient response by following the procedure  
in Section 8.3. Substituting R = 4 Ω, L = 8 mH, and C = 1 μF, we get
α =  R 
___ 
2L    = 250,  
ω0 =  1 
____

___ 
LC  
    = 1.118 × 104
Since α < ω0, the response is underdamped. The damped natural fre
-
quency is
ωd =  √
_______ 
ω2
0 − α2    ≃ ω0 = 1.118 × 104
The form of the transient response is
 
it(t) = e−α (A cos ωdt + B sin ωdt) 
(8.16.5)
where A and B are constants. The steady-state response is
 
iss(t) = i(∞) = 0 
(8.16.6)
so that the complete response is
 
i(t) = it(t) + iss(t) = e−250t(A cos 11,180t + B sin 11,180t) 
(8.16.7)
We now determine A and B.
i(0) = 3 = A + 0  
⇒  
A = 3
Taking the derivative of Eq. (8.16.7),
  
  di 
__ 
dt    = −250e−250t(A cos 11,180t + B sin 11,180t)
 
 
+ e−250t(−11,180A sin 11,180t + 11,180B cos 11,180t)
Setting t = 0 and incorporating Eq. (8.16.2),
0 = −250A + 11,180B  
⇒  
B = 0.0671
Thus,
 
i(t) = e−250t(3 cos 11,180t + 0.0671 sin 11,180t) 
(8.16.8)
The voltage across the inductor is then
 
vL(t) = L    di 
__ 
dt    = −268e−250t sin 11,180t 
(8.16.9)

This has a maximum value when sine is unity, that is, at 11,180t0 = π∕2 
or t0 = 140.5 μs. At time  = t0, the inductor voltage reaches its peak, 
which is
 
vL(t0) = −268e−250t0 = −259 V 
(8.16.10)
Although this is far less than the voltage range of 6000 to 10,000 V 
required to fire the spark plug in a typical automobile, a device known 
as a transformer (to be discussed in Chapter 13) is used to step up the 
inductor voltage to the required level.
In Fig. 8.52, find the capacitor voltage vC for t > 0.
Answer: 12 − 12e−250t cos 11,180t + 267.7e−250t sin 11,180t V.
8.11.2  Smoothing Circuits
In a typical digital communication system, the signal to be transmitted 
is first sampled. Sampling refers to the procedure of selecting samples 
of a signal for processing, as opposed to processing the entire signal. 
Each sample is con verted into a binary number represented by a series 
of pulses. The pulses are transmitted by a transmission line such as a 
coaxial cable, twisted pair, or optical fiber. At the receiving end, the sig-
nal is applied to a digital-to-analog (D/A) con verter whose output is a 
“staircase” function, that is, constant at each time interv al. In order to 
recover the transmitted analog signal, the output is smoothed by letting 
it pass through a “smoothing” circuit, as illustrated in Fig. 8.53. An RLC 
circuit may be used as the smoothing circuit.

 Summary
1. The determination of the initial v alues x(0) and dx(0)∕dt and final 
value x(∞) is crucial to analyzing second-order circuits.

 second-order dif ferential equation. Its characteristic equation is

3. If there are no independent sources in the circuit after switching (or 
sudden change), we regard the circuit as source-free. The complete 
solution is the natural response.
4. The natural response of an 
RLC circuit is o verdamped, under -
damped, or critically damped, depending on the roots of the charac-
teristic equation. The response is critically damped when the roots 
are equal (s1 = s2 or α = ω0), overdamped when the roots are real 
and unequal (s1 ≠ s2 or α > ω0), or underdamped when the roots are 
complex conjugate (s1 = s2* or α < ω0).
5. If independent sources are present in the circuit after switching, 
the complete response is the sum of the transient response and the 
steady-state response.
6. PSpice is used to analyze RLC circuits in the same w ay as for RC 
or RL circuits.
7. Two circuits are dual if the mesh equations that describe one circuit 
have the same form as the nodal equations that describe the other. The 
analysis of one circuit gives the analysis of its dual circuit.
8. The automobile ignition circuit and the smoothing circuit are typical 
applications of the material covered in this chapter.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.d), “an ability to function on 
multi‑disciplinary teams.”
The “ability to function on multidisciplinary teams” is inherently critical 
for the working engineer. Engineers rarely, if ever, work by themselves. 
Engineers will always be part of some team. One of the things I lik e to 
remind students is that you do not have to like everyone on a team; you 
just have to be a successful part of that team.
Most frequently, these teams include indi viduals from a v ariety of 
engineering disciplines, as well as individuals from nonengineering dis-
ciplines such as marketing and finance.
Students can easily de velop and enhance this skill by w orking in 
study groups in every course they take. Clearly, working in study groups 
in nonengineering courses, as well as engineering courses outside your 
discipline, will also give you experience with multidisciplinary teams.

Chapter 9  Sinusoids and  Phasors
9.1
Introduction
Thus far our analysis has been limited for the most part to dc circuits: 
those circuits e xcited by constant or time-in variant sources. We have 
restricted the forcing function to dc sources for the sake of simplicity, for 
pedagogic reasons, and also for historic reasons. Historically, dc sources 
were the main means of providing electric power up until the late 1800s. 
At the end of that century, the battle of direct current versus alternating 
current began. Both had their advocates among the electrical engineers 
of the time. Because ac is more efficient and economical to transmit over 
long distances, ac systems ended up the winner . Thus, it is in k eeping 
with the historical sequence of events that we considered dc sources first.
We now begin the analysis of circuits in which the source v oltage or 
current is time-v arying. In this chapter , we are particularly interested in 
sinusoidally time-varying excitation, or simply, excitation by a sinusoid.

Historical
Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) and George Westinghouse (1846–1914) 
helped establish alternating current as the primary mode of electricity 
transmission and distribution.
Today it is obvious that ac generation is well established as the form 
of electric power that makes widespread distribution of electric power effi-
cient and economical. However, at the end of the 19th century, which was 
the better—ac or dc—w as hotly debated and had e xtremely out spoken 
supporters on both sides. The dc side was led by Thomas  Edison, who had 
earned a lot of respect for his many contributions. Power generation using 
ac really be gan to build after the successful contrib utions of Tesla. The 
real commercial success in ac came from Geor ge  Westinghouse and the 
outstanding team, including Tesla, he assembled. In addition, tw o other 
big names were C. F. Scott and B. G. Lamme.
The most significant contribution to the early success of ac was the 
patenting of the polyphase ac motor by 
Tesla in 1888. The induction 
 motor and polyphase generation and distrib ution systems doomed the 
use of dc as the prime energy source.

9.2 Sinusoids
369
A sinusoid is a signal that has the form of the sine or cosine function.
A sinusoidal current is usually referred to as 
alternating current (ac). 
Such a current reverses at regular time intervals and has alternately posi-
tive and negative values. Circuits driven by sinusoidal current or voltage 
sources are called ac circuits.
We are interested in sinusoids for a number of reasons. First, nature 
itself is characteristically sinusoidal. We e xperience sinusoidal v aria-
tion in the motion of a pendulum, the vibration of a string, the ripples 
on the ocean surface, and the natural response of underdamped second-  
order systems, to mention but a few. Second, a sinusoidal signal is easy to 
generate and transmit. It is the form of v oltage generated throughout the 
world and supplied to homes, factories, laboratories, and so on. It is the 
dominant form of signal in the communications and electric power in-
dustries. Third, through Fourier analysis, any practical periodic signal 
can be represented by a sum of sinusoids. Sinusoids, therefore, play 
an important role in the analysis of periodic signals. Lastly
, a sinu -
soid is easy to handle mathematically . The derivative and  integral of 
a sinusoid are themselves sinusoids. For these and other reasons, the  
sinusoid is an extremely important function in  circuit analysis.
 
A sinusoidal forcing function produces both a transient response 
and a steady-state response, much like the step function, which we stud-
ied in Chapters 7 and 8. The transient response dies out with time so that 
only the steady-state response remains. When the transient response has 
become negligibly small compared with the steady-state response, we 
say that the circuit is operating at sinusoidal steady state. It is this sinu-
soidal steady-state response that is of main interest to us in this chapter.
 
We begin with a basic discussion of sinusoids and phasors. We then 
introduce the concepts of impedance and admittance. The basic circuit 
laws, Kirchhoff’s and Ohm’s, introduced for dc circuits, will be applied 
to ac circuits. Finally, we consider applications of ac circuits in phase-
shifters and bridges.

Sinusoids
Consider the sinusoidal voltage
 
v(t) = Vm sin ωt 
(9.1)
where
Vm = the amplitude of the sinusoid
   ω = the angular frequency in radians/s
 ωt = the argument of the sinusoid
The sinusoid is shown in Fig. 9.1(a) as a function of its argument and in 
Fig. 9.1(b) as a function of time. It is e vident that the sinusoid repeats 
itself every T seconds; thus, T is called the period of the sinusoid. From 
the two plots in Fig. 9.1, we observe that ωT = 2π,

periodic. In general,
A periodic function is one that satisfies f (t) = f (t + nT), for all t and for 
all integers n.
As mentioned, the period T of the periodic function is the time of one 
complete cycle or the number of seconds per c ycle. The reciprocal of 
this quantity is the number of c ycles per second, kno wn as the cyclic 
frequency f of the sinusoid. Thus,

Heinrich Rudorf Hertz (1857–1894), a German experimental physi-
cist, demonstrated that electromagnetic waves obey the same fundamen-
tal laws as light. His work confirmed James Clerk Maxwell’s celebrated 
1864 theory and prediction that such waves existed.
Hertz w as born into a prosperous f
amily in Hamb urg, German y. 
He attended the Uni versity of Berlin and did his doctorate under the 
prominent physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. He became a professor at 
 Karlsruhe, where he be gan his quest for electromagnetic w aves. Hertz 
successfully generated and detected electromagnetic w aves; he was the 
first to show that light is electromagnetic ener gy. In 1887, Hertz noted 
for the first time the photoelectric effect of electrons in a molecular struc-
ture. Although Hertz only lived to the age of 37, his discovery of electro-
magnetic waves paved the way for the practical use of such waves in ra-
dio, television, and other communication systems. The unit of frequency, 
the hertz, bears his name.

9.2 Sinusoids
371
From Eqs. (9.2) and (9.5), it is clear that
ω = 2 πf 
(9.6)
While ω is in radians per second (rad/s), f is in hertz (Hz).
 
Let us now consider a more general expression for the sinusoid,
 
v(t) = Vm sin(ωt + ϕ) 
(9.7)
where (ωt + ϕ) is the argument and ϕ is the phase. Both argument and 
phase can be in radians or degrees.
 
Let us examine the two sinusoids
 
v1(t) = Vm sin ωt  
and  
v2(t) = Vm sin (ωt + ϕ) 
(9.8)
shown in Fig. 9.2. The starting point of v2 in Fig. 9.2 occurs first in time. 
Therefore, we say that v2 leads v1 by ϕ or that v1 lags v2 by ϕ. If ϕ ≠ 0, 
we also say that v1 and v2 are out of phase. If ϕ = 0, then v1 and v2 are 
said to be in phase; they reach their minima and maxima at e xactly the 
same time. We can compare v1 and v2 in this manner because they oper-
ate at the same frequency; they do not need to have the same amplitude.
A sinusoid can be e xpressed in either sine or cosine form. 
When 
comparing two sinusoids, it is expedient to express both as either sine or 
cosine with positive amplitudes. This is achieved by using the following 
trigonometric identities:
 sin(A ± B) = sin A cos B ± cos A sin B
cos(A ± B) = cos A cos B ∓ sin A sin B 
(9.9)
With these identities, it is easy to show that
sin(ωt ± 180°) = −sin ωt
cos(ωt ± 180°) = −cos ωt
sin(ωt ± 90°) = ± cos ωt
cos(ωt ± 90°) = ∓ sin ωt  
(9.10)
Using these relationships, we can transform a sinusoid from sine form to 
cosine form or vice versa.

Chapter 9  Sinusoids and  Phasors
A graphical approach may be used to relate or compare sinusoids 
as an alternative to using the trigonometric identities in Eqs. (9.9) and 
(9.10). Consider the set of axes shown in Fig. 9.3(a). The  horizontal 
axis represents the magnitude of cosine, while the vertical axis (pointing 
down) denotes the magnitude of sine. Angles are measured positi
vely 
counterclockwise from the horizontal, as  usual in polar coordinates. 
This graphical technique can be used to relate tw
o sinusoids. F or ex-
ample, we see in Fig. 9.3(a) that  subtracting 90° from the ar gument of 
cos ωt gives sin ωt, or cos(ωt − 90°) = sin ωt. Similarly, adding 1 80° 
to the argu ment of sin ωt gives −sin ωt, or sin(ωt + 180°) = −sin ωt, as 
shown in Fig. 9.3(b).
 
The graphical technique can also be used to add tw
o sinusoids of 
the same frequency when one is in sine form and the other is in cosine 
form. To add A cos ωt and B sin ωt, we note that A is the magnitude of 
cos ωt while B is the magnitude of sin ωt, as shown in Fig. 9.4(a). The 
magnitude and argument of the resultant sinusoid in cosine form is read-
ily obtained from the triangle. Thus,
 
A cos ωt + B sin ωt = C cos(ωt − θ) 
(9.11)
where
 
C =  √

θ = tan−1   B

(9.12)
For example, we may add 3 cos  ωt and −4 sin ωt as shown in Fig. 9.4(b) 
and obtain
 
3 cos ωt − 4 sin ωt = 5 cos(ωt + 53.1°) 
(9.13)
 
Compared with the trigonometric identities in Eqs. (9.9) and 
(9.10), the graphical approach eliminates memorization. Ho wever, we 
must not confuse the sine and cosine ax es with the ax es for comple x 
numbers to be discussed in the next section. Something else to note in 
Figs. 9.3 and 9.4 is that although the natural tendenc
y is to ha ve the 
vertical axis point up, the positive direction of the sine function is down 
in the present case.

Practice Problem 9.1
Example 9.2
Calculate the phase angle between v1 = −10 cos(ωt + 50°) and v2 = 
12 sin(ωt − 10°). State which sinusoid is leading.
Solution:
Let us calculate the phase in three ways. The first two methods use trigo-
nometric identities, while the third method uses the graphical approach.
■ METHOD 1  In order to compare v1 and v2, we must e xpress 
them in the same form. If we e xpress them in cosine form with posi -
tive  amplitudes,
 
v1 = −10 cos(ωt + 50°) = 10 cos(ωt + 50° − 180°)
 
v1 = 10 cos(ωt − 130°)  
or  
v1 = 10 cos(ωt + 230°) 
(9.2.1)
and
v2 = 12 sin(ωt − 10°) = 12 cos(ωt − 10° − 90°)
 
v2 = 12 cos(ωt − 100°) 
(9.2.2)
It can be deduced from Eqs. (9.2.1) and (9.2.2) that the phase difference 
between v1 and v2 is 30°. We can write v2 as
v2 = 12 cos(ωt − 130° + 30°) or v2 = 12 cos(ωt + 260°) 
(9.2.3)
Comparing Eqs. (9.2.1) and (9.2.3) shows clearly that v2 leads v1 by 30°.
■ METHOD 2  Alternatively, we may express v1 in sine form:
 
v1 = −10 cos(ωt + 50°) = 10 sin(ωt + 50° − 90°)
 
= 10 sin(ωt − 40°) = 10 sin(ωt − 10° − 30°)

374 
Chapter 9  Sinusoids and  Phasors
But v2 = 12 sin(ωt − 10°). Comparing the tw o shows that v1 lags v2
by 30°. This is the same as saying that v2 leads v1 by 30°.
■ METHOD 3  We may regard v1 as simply −10 cos ωt with a phase 
shift of +50°. Hence, v1 is as shown in Fig. 9.5. Similarly, v2 is 12 sin ωt 
with a phase shift of −10°, as shown in Fig. 9.5. It is easy to see from 
Fig. 9.5 that v2 leads v1 by 30°, that is, 90° − 50° − 10°.

Phasors
Sinusoids are easily expressed in terms of phasors, which are more con-
venient to work with than sine and cosine functions.
A phasor is a complex number that represents the amplitude and phase 
of a sinusoid.
Phasors provide a simple means of analyzing linear circuits e xcited by 
sinusoidal sources; solutions of such circuits would be intractable other-
wise. The notion of solving ac circuits using phasors was first introduced 
by Charles Steinmetz in 1893. Before we completely define phasors and 
apply them to circuit analysis, we need to be thoroughly f
amiliar with 
complex numbers.
 
A complex number z can be written in rectangular form as
 
z = x + jy 
(9.14a)
where j =  √
___ 
−1  ; x is the real part of z; y is the imaginary part of z. In 
this context, the variables x and y do not represent a location as in tw o-
dimensional vector analysis but rather the real and imaginary parts of z 
in the complex plane. Nevertheless, we note that there are some resem-
blances between manipulating complex numbers and manipulating two-
dimensional vectors.
 
The complex number z can also be written in polar or e xponential 
form as
 
z = r⧸ ϕ = rejϕ

and electrical engineer.

complex numbers.

where r is the magnitude of z, and ϕ is the phase of z. We notice that z 
can be represented in three ways:
z = x + jy 
Rectangular form
z = r⧸ ϕ  
Polar form
 
z = rejϕ 
Exponential form 
(9.15)
The relationship between the rectangular form and the polar form is 
shown in Fig. 9.6, where the x axis represents the real part and the y axis 
represents the imaginary part of a comple x number. Given x and y, we 
can get r and ϕ as
 
r =  √
______ 
x2 + y2  ,  
ϕ = tan−1  y 
__ x  
(9.16a)
On the other hand, if we know r and ϕ, we can obtain x and y as
 
x = r cos ϕ,  
y = r sin ϕ 
(9.16b)
Thus, z may be written as
 
z = x + jy = r⧸ ϕ = r(cos ϕ + j sin ϕ)
 
(9.17)
Addition and subtraction of complex numbers are better performed 
in rectangular form; multiplication and division are better done in polar 
form. Given the complex numbers
z = x + jy = r⧸ ϕ,  
z1 = x1 + jy1 = r1 ⧸ ϕ1
z2 = x2 + jy2 = r2 ⧸ ϕ2
the following operations are important.
Addition:
 
z1 + z2 = (x1 + x2) + j(y1 + y2) 
(9.18a)
Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865–1923), a German-Austrian 
mathematician and engineer, introduced the phasor method (covered in 
this chapter) in ac circuit analysis. He is also noted for his w ork on the 
theory of hysteresis.
 
Steinmetz was born in Breslau, Germany, and lost his mother at the  
age of one. As a youth, he was forced to leave Germany because of his 
political activities just as he w as about to complete his doctoral dis
-
sertation in mathematics at the Uni versity of Breslau. He migrated to 
Switzerland and later to the United States, where he was employed by 
General Electric in 1893. That same year, he published a paper in which 
complex numbers were used to analyze ac circuits for the first time. 
This led to one of his man y textbooks, Theory and Calculation of ac  
Phenomena, published by McGra w-Hill in 1897. In 1901, he became  
the president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, which  
later became the IEEE.

These are the basic properties of complex numbers we need. Other prop-
erties of complex numbers can be found in Appendix B.
The idea of phasor representation is based on Euler’
s identity. In 
general,
 
e±jϕ = cos ϕ ± j sin ϕ
 
(9.19)
which shows that we may re gard cos ϕ and sin ϕ as the real and imagi -
nary parts of e jϕ; we may write
 
cos ϕ = Re(ejϕ) 
(9.20a)
 
sin ϕ = Im(ejϕ) 
(9.20b)
where Re and Im stand for the real part of and the imaginary part of. 
Given a sinusoid v(t) = Vm cos(ωt + ϕ), we use Eq. (9.20a) to e xpress 
v(t) as
v(t) = Vm cos(ωt + ϕ) = Re(Vmej(ωt+ϕ)) 
(9.21)
or
 
v(t) = Re(Vmejϕejωt) 
(9.22)
Thus,
 
v(t) = Re(Vejωt)
 
(9.23)
where
 
V = Vmejϕ = Vm⧸ ϕ 
(9.24)

9.3
Phasors
377
V is thus the phasor representation of the sinusoid v(t), as we said  earlier. 
In other words, a phasor is a complex representation of the magnitude 
and phase of a sinusoid. Either Eq. (9.20a) or Eq. (9.20b) can be used 
to develop the phasor, but the standard convention is to use Eq. (9.20a).
One way of looking at Eqs. (9.23) and (9.24) is to consider the plot of 
the sinor Vejωt = Vmej(ωt+ϕ) on the comple x plane. As time increases, the  
sinor rotates on a circle of radius Vm at an angular velocity ω in the counter-
clockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 9.7(a). We may regard v(t) as the pro-
jection of the sinor Vejωt on the real axis, as shown in Fig. 9.7(b). The value 
of the sinor at time t = 0 is the phasor V of the sinusoid v(t). The sinor may 
be regarded as a rotating phasor. Thus, whenever a sinusoid is expressed as 
a phasor, the term ejωt is implicitly present. It is therefore important, when 
dealing with phasors, to keep in mind the frequency ω of the phasor; other-
wise we can make serious mistakes.
 A phasor may be regarded as a 
mathematical equivalent of a sinusoid 
with the time dependence dropped.
 If we use sine for the phasor instead of 
cosine, then v(t) = V m sin(ωt + ϕ) = 
Im(Vme j(ωt+ϕ)) and the corresponding 
phasor is the same as that in Eq. (9.24).

Equation (9.23) states that to obtain the sinusoid corresponding to 
a given phasor V, multiply the phasor by the time f actor ejωt and tak e 
the real part. As a complex quantity, a phasor may be expressed in rect-
angular form, polar form, or exponential form. Because a phasor has 
magnitude and phase (“direction”), it behaves as a vector and is printed 
in boldface. For example, phasors V = Vm⧸ ϕ and I = Im⧸ −θ are graphi-
cally represented in Fig. 9.8. Such a graphical representation of phasors 
is known as a phasor diagram.
Equations (9.21) through (9.23) re veal that to get the phasor cor -
responding to a sinusoid, we first express the sinusoid in the cosine form 
so that the sinusoid can be written as the real part of a complex number. 
Then we tak e out the time f actor ejωt, and whate ver is left is the pha -
sor corresponding to the sinusoid. By suppressing the time f
actor, we 
transform the sinusoid from the time domain to the phasor domain. This 
transformation is summarized as follows:
 
v(t) = Vm cos(ωt + ϕ)  
⇔  
V = Vm⧸ ϕ

We use lightface italic letters such as

like quantities.

Chapter 9  Sinusoids and  Phasors
Given a sinusoid v(t) = Vm cos(ωt + ϕ), we obtain the corresponding 
phasor as V = Vm ⧸ ϕ. Equation (9.25) is also demonstrated in Table 9.1, 
where the sine function is considered in addition to the cosine function. 
From Eq. (9.25), we see that to get the phasor representation of a sinu -
soid, we e xpress it in cosine form and tak e the  magnitude and phase. 
Given a phasor, we obtain the time domain representation as the cosine 
function with the same magnitude as the phasor and the ar gument as ωt 
plus the phase of the phasor. The idea of expressing information in alter-
nate domains is fundamental to all areas of engineering.
Note that in Eq. (9.25) the frequenc y (or time) f actor ejωt is sup -
pressed, and the frequency is not explicitly shown in the phasor domain 
representation because ω is constant. However, the response depends on 
ω. For this reason, the phasor domain is also known as the frequency 
domain.
From Eqs. (9.23) and (9.24), v(t) = Re(Vejωt) = Vm cos(ωt + ϕ), so that

Equation (9.27) allows the replacement of a derivative with respect 
to time with multiplication of jω in the phasor domain, whereas Eq. (9.28) 
allows the replacement of an inte gral with respect to time with di vision 
by jω in the phasor domain. Equations (9.27) and (9.28) are useful in 
finding the steady-state solution, which does not require knowing the 
initial values of the variable involved. This is one of the important ap-
plications of phasors.
Besides time differentiation and integration, another important use 
of phasors is found in summing sinusoids of the same frequency. This 
is best illustrated with an example, and Example 9.6 provides one.
The differences between v(t) and V should be emphasized:
1. v(t) is the instantaneous or time domain  representation, while V is 
the frequency or phasor domain representation.
2. v(t) is time dependent, while V is not. (This f act is often for gotten 
by students.)
3. v(t) is al ways real with no comple
x term, while V is generally 
complex.
Finally, we should bear in mind that phasor analysis applies only when 
frequency is constant; it applies in manipulating two or more sinusoidal 
signals only if they are of the same frequency.
 Differentiating a sinusoid is equivalent 
to multiplying its corresponding phasor 
by jω.
 Integrating a sinusoid is equivalent to 
dividing its corresponding phasor 
by jω.
 Adding sinusoids of the same 
frequency is equivalent to adding their 
corresponding phasors.

Solution:
(a) Using polar to rectangular transformation,
40⧸ 50°  = 40(cos 50° + j sin 50°) = 25.71 + j30.64
20⧸ −30° = 20[cos(−30°) + j sin(−30°)] = 17.32 − j10
Adding them up gives
40⧸ 50° + 20⧸ −30° = 43.03 + j20.64 = 47.72⧸ 25.63°

Transform these sinusoids to phasors:
(a) i = 6 cos(50t − 40°) A
(b) v = −4 sin(30t + 50°) V
Solution:
(a) i = 6 cos(50t − 40°) has the phasor
I = 6⧸ −40° A
(b) Since −sin A = cos(A + 90°),
 
v = −4 sin(30t + 50°) = 4 cos(30t + 50° + 90°)

Phasors

Example 9.5
Find the sinusoids represented by these phasors:
(a) I = −3 + j4 A
(b) V = j8e−j20° V
Solution:
(a) I = −3 + j4 = 5⧸ 126.87°. Transforming this to the time domain gives
i(t) = 5 cos(ωt + 126.87°) A
(b) Because j = 1⧸ 90°,
 
V = j8⧸ −20° = (1⧸ 90°)(8⧸ −20°)
 
= 8⧸ 90° − 20° = 8⧸ 70° V
Converting this to the time domain gives
v(t) = 8 cos(ωt + 70°)V
Practice Problem 9.5
Find the sinusoids corresponding to these phasors:
(a) V = −25⧸ 40° V
(b) I = j(12 − j5) A
Answer: (a) v(t) = 25 cos(ωt − 140°) V or 25 cos(ωt + 220°) V,  
(b) i(t) = 13 cos(ωt + 67.38°) A.
Example 9.6
Given i1(t) = 4 cos(ωt + 30°) A and i2(t) = 5 sin(ωt − 20°) A, find 
their sum.
Solution:
Here is an important use of phasors—for summing sinusoids of the same 
frequency. Current i1(t) is in the standard form. Its phasor is
I1 = 4⧸ 30°
We need to express i2(t) in cosine form. The rule for converting sine to 
cosine is to subtract 90°. Hence,
i2 = 5 cos(ωt − 20° − 90°) = 5 cos(ωt − 110°)
and its phasor is
I2 = 5⧸ −110°
If we let i = i1 + i2, then
 
I = I1 + I2 = 4⧸ 30° + 5⧸ −110°
 
= 3.464 + j2 − 1.71 − j4.698 = 1.754 − j2.698
 
= 3.218⧸ −56.97° A

382 
Chapter 9  Sinusoids and  Phasors
Transforming this to the time domain, we get
i(t) = 3.218 cos(ωt − 56.97°) A
Of course, we can find i1 + i2 using Eq. (9.9), but that is the hard way.
Practice Problem 9.6
If v1 = −10 sin(ωt − 30°) V and v2 = 20 cos(ωt + 45°) V, find v = 
v1 + v2.
Answer: v(t) = 29.77 cos(ωt + 49.98°) V.

form of the given equation as
4I +  8I 
___ 
jω  − 3jωI = 50⧸ 75°
But ω = 2, so
I(4 − j4 − j6) = 50⧸ 75°

50⧸ 75° 
____________  
10.77⧸ −68.2°
  = 4.642⧸ 143.2° A
Converting this to the time domain,
i(t) = 4.642 cos(2t + 143.2°) A
Keep in mind that this is only the steady-state solution, and it does not 
require knowing the initial values.

 Phasor Relationships  
for Circuit Elements
Now that we know how to represent a voltage or current in the phasor or 
frequency domain, one may le gitimately ask how we apply this to cir -
cuits involving the passive elements R, L, and C. What we need to do is 
to transform the voltage-current relationship from the time domain to the 
frequency domain for each element. Again, we will assume the passi ve 
sign convention.
We begin with the resistor . If the current through a resistor 
R is 
i = Im cos(ωt + ϕ), the voltage across it is given by Ohm’s law as
 
v = iR = RImcos(ωt + ϕ) 
(9.29)
The phasor form of this voltage is
 
V = RIm⧸ ϕ 
(9.30)
But the phasor representation of the current is I = Im⧸ ϕ. Hence,
 
V = RI 
(9.31)
showing that the v oltage-current relation for the resistor in the phasor 
domain continues to be Ohm’s law, as in the time domain. Figure 9.9 
 illustrates the voltage-current relations of a resistor. We should note from 
Eq. (9.31) that voltage and current are in phase, as illustrated in the pha-
sor diagram in Fig. 9.10.
For the inductor 
L, assume the 
current through it 
is i =  
Im cos(ωt + ϕ). The voltage across the inductor is
 
v = L  di 
__ 
dt  = −ωLIm sin(ωt + ϕ) 
(9.32)
Recall from Eq. (9.10) that −sin A = cos(A + 90°). We can write the 
voltage as
 
v = ωLIm cos(ωt + ϕ + 90°) 
(9.33)
which transforms to the phasor
 
V = ωLImej(ϕ+90°) = ωLImejϕej90° = ωLIm⧸ ϕ + 90° 
(9.34)
But Im⧸ ϕ = I, and from Eq. (9.19), ej90° = j. Thus,
 
V = jωLI 
(9.35)
showing that the v oltage has a magnitude of 
ωLIm and a phase of  
ϕ + 90°. The voltage and current are 90° out of phase. Specifically, the 
current lags the v oltage by 90°. Figure 9.11 sho ws the v oltage-current 
relations for the inductor. Figure 9.12 shows the phasor diagram.
For the capacitor 
C, assume the voltage across it is v = 
Vm cos(ωt + ϕ). The current through the capacitor is
 
i = C  dv 
___ 
dt  
(9.36)
By following the same steps as we took for the inductor or by applying

any type of element as
 
Z =

__
 
I    
or  
V = ZI
 
(9.40)
where Z is a frequenc y-dependent quantity known as impedance, mea-
sured in ohms.
The impedance Z of a circuit is the ratio of the phasor voltage V to the 
phasor current I, measured in ohms (Ω).
The impedance represents the opposition that the circuit e
xhibits to 
the flow of sinusoidal current. Although the impedance is the ratio of 
two phasors, it is not a phasor, because it does not correspond to a sinu-
soidally varying quantity.
The impedances of resistors, inductors, and capacitors can be read-
ily obtained from Eq. (9.39). Table 9.3 summarizes their impedances. 
From the table we notice that ZL = jωL and ZC = −j∕ωC. Consider two 
extreme cases of angular frequency. When ω = 0 (i.e., for dc sources), 
ZL = 0 and ZC → ∞, confirming what we already know—that the induc-
tor acts like a short circuit, while the capacitor acts like an open circuit. 
When ω → ∞ (i.e., for high frequencies), ZL → ∞ and ZC = 0, indicat-
ing that the inductor is an open circuit to high frequencies, while the
 
capacitor is a short circuit. Figure 9.15 illustrates this.
As a complex quantity, the impedence may be e xpressed in rectan-
gular form as
 
Z = R ± jX 
(9.41)
where R = Re Z is the resistance and X = Im Z is the reactance. The 
reactance, X, is just a magnitude, a positi ve value, but when used as  
a vector, a j is associated with inductance and a −j is associated with 
capacitance. Thus, impedance Z = R + jX is said to be inductive or 
lagging since current lags v oltage, while impedance Z = R − jX i s 
capacitive or leading  because current leads v oltage. The impedance, 
resistance, and reactance are all measured in ohms. The impedance 
may also be expressed in polar form as
 
Z = ∣Z∣ ⧸ θ

  Kirchhoff’s Laws in the  
Frequency Domain
We cannot do circuit analysis in the frequenc y domain without Kirch -
hoff’s current and v oltage laws. Therefore, we need to e xpress them in 
the frequency domain.
For KVL, let v1,v2, … , vn be the voltages around a closed loop.
Then
 
v1 + v2 + ⋯ + vn = 0 
(9.51)
In the sinusoidal steady state, each v
oltage may be written in cosine 
form, so that Eq. (9.51) becomes
 
Vm1 cos(ωt + θ1) + Vm2 cos(ωt + θ2)
 
+ ⋯ + Vmn cos(ωt + θn) = 0 
(9.52)

Chapter 9  Sinusoids and  Phasors
This can be written as
Re(Vm1ejθ1ejωt) + Re(Vm2ejθ2ejωt) + ⋯ + Re(Vmnejθnejωt) = 0
or
 
Re[(Vm1ejθ1 + Vm2ejθ2 + ⋯ + Vmnejθn)ejωt] = 0 
(9.53)
If we let Vk = Vmkejθk, then
 
Re[(V1 + V2 + ⋯ + Vn)ejωt] = 0 
(9.54)
Because ejωt ≠ 0,
 
V1 + V2 + ⋯ + Vn = 0 
(9.55)
indicating that Kirchhoff’s voltage law holds for phasors.
By following a similar procedure, we can show that Kirchhoff’s cur-
rent law holds for phasors. If we let i1, i2, … , in be the current leaving or 
entering a closed surface in a network at time t, then
 
i1 + i2 + ⋯ + in = 0 
(9.56)
If I1, I2, … , In are the phasor forms of the sinusoids i1,i2, … ,in, then
 
I1 + I2 + ⋯ + In = 0 
(9.57)
which is Kirchhoff’s current law in the frequency domain.
Once we have shown that both KVL and KCL hold in the frequency 
domain, it is easy to do man y things, such as impedance combination, 
nodal and mesh analyses, superposition, and source transformation.

Answer: 12.728 ⧸ 63.8° A.

 Applications
In Chapters 7 and 8, we sa w certain uses of RC, RL, and RLC circuits 
in dc applications. These circuits also have ac applications; among them 
are coupling circuits, phase-shifting circuits, filters, resonant circuits, ac 
bridge circuits, and transformers. This list of applications is ine xhaus-
tive. We will consider some of them later. It will suffice here to observe 
two simple ones: RC phase-shifting circuits, and ac bridge circuits.
9.8.1  Phase-Shifters
A phase-shifting circuit is often emplo
yed to correct an undesirable 
phase shift already present in a circuit or to produce special desired 
effects. An RC circuit is suitable for this purpose because its capacitor 
causes the circuit current to lead the applied v
oltage. Two commonly 
used RC circuits are shown in Fig. 9.31. (RL circuits or any reactive cir-
cuits could also serve the same purpose.)
In Fig. 9.31(a), the circuit current I leads the applied voltage Vi by 
some phase angle θ, where 0 < θ < 90°, depending on the values of R and 
C. If XC = −1∕ωC, then the total impedance is Z = R + jXC, and the phase 
shift is given by
 
θ = tan−1  XC 
___ 
R  
(9.70)
This shows that the amount of phase shift depends on the v alues of R, 
C, and the operating frequenc y. Since the output v oltage Vo across the 
resistor is in phase with the current, Vo leads (positive phase shift) Vi as 
shown in Fig. 9.32(a).
In Fig. 9.31(b), the output is taken across the capacitor. The current 
I leads the input v oltage Vi by θ, but the output voltage vo(t) across the 
capacitor lags (negative phase shift) the input v oltage vi(t) as illustrated 
in Fig. 9.32(b).

9.8  Applications
395
We should keep in mind that the simple RC circuits in Fig. 9.31 
also act as voltage dividers. Therefore, as the phase shift θ approaches 
90°, the output vo ltage Vo approaches zero. F or this reason, these  
simple RC circuits are used only when small amounts of phase shift  
are required. If it is desired to ha
ve phase shifts greater than 60°, 
simple RC networks are cascaded, thereby providing a total phase 
shift equal to the sum of the indi vidual phase shifts. In practice, the  
phase shifts due to the stages are not equal, because the succeeding 
stages load down the earlier stages unless op amps are used to sepa -
rate the stages.

Answer: Figure 9.34 shows a typical design; 20 V rms.
Example 9.13
Design an RC circuit to provide a phase of 90° leading.
Solution:
If we select circuit components of equal ohmic v alue, say R = ∣XC∣ = 
20 Ω, at a particular frequency, according to Eq. (9.70), the phase shift 
is exactly 45°. By cascading two similar RC circuits in Fig. 9.31(a), we 
obtain the circuit in Fig. 9.33, providing a positive or leading phase shift 
of 90°, as we shall soon show. Using the series-parallel combination tech-
nique, Z in Fig. 9.33 is obtained as

showing that the output is about 19 percent of the input in magnitude but 
leading the input by 100°. If the circuit is terminated by a load, the load 
will affect the phase shift.

9.8.2  AC Bridges
An ac bridge circuit is used in measuring the inductance L of an inductor 
or the capacitance C of a capacitor. It is similar in form to the Wheatstone 
bridge for measuring an unknown resistance (discussed in Section 4.10) 
and follows the same principle. To measure L and C, however, an ac

source is needed as well as an ac meter instead of the galvanometer. The 
ac meter may be a sensitive ac ammeter or voltmeter.
Consider the general ac bridge circuit displayed in Fig. 9.37. 
The 
bridge is balanced when no current flows through the meter. This means 
that V1 = V2. Applying the voltage division principle,
 
V1 =

or

___

(9.73)
This is the balanced equation for the ac bridge and is similar to Eq. (4.30) 
for the resistance bridge except that the R’s are replaced by Z’s.
Specific ac bridges for measuring L and C are shown in Fig. 9.38, 
where Lx and Cx are the unknown inductance and capacitance to be mea-
sured while Ls and Cs are a standard inductance and capacitance (the 
values of which are kno wn to great precision). In each case, tw o resis-
tors, R1 and R2, are varied until the ac meter reads zero. Then the bridge 
is balanced. From Eq. (9.73), we obtain
 
Lx =  R2

the fact that they balance the given quantities. Given that a parallel

be used to find the unknown values, a straightforward equality 
works best. Once we have answers, we can check them by using

We have assumed a parallel RC combination which works in 
this case.
5. Evaluate. Let us now use PSpice to see if we indeed have the 
correct equalities. Running PSpice with the equivalent circuits, 
an open circuit between the “bridge” portion of the circuit, and a 
10-volt input voltage yields the following voltages at the ends of 
the “bridge” relative to a reference at the bottom of the circuit:
FREQ 
 VM($N_0002)   VP($N_0002)
2.000E + 03  9.993E + 00  -8.634E - 03
2.000E + 03  9.993E + 00  -8.637E - 03
Because the voltages are essentially the same, then no measurable 
current can flow through the “bridge” portion of the circuit for 
any element that connects the two points together and we have a 
balanced bridge, which is to be expected. This indicates we have 
properly determined the unknowns.
There is a very important problem with what we have done! 
Do you know what that is? We have what can be called an ideal, 
“theoretical” answer, but one that really is not very good in the 
real world. The difference between the magnitudes of the upper 
impedances and the lower impedances is much too large and would 
never be accepted in a real bridge circuit. For greatest accuracy, 
the overall magnitude of the impedances must at least be within 
the same relative order. To increase the accuracy of the solution 
of this problem, I would recommend increasing the magnitude of 
the top impedances to be in the range of 500 kΩ to 1.5 MΩ. One 
 additional real-world comment: The size of these impedances also 
creates serious problems in making actual measurements, so the 
appropriate instruments must be used in order to minimize their 
loading (which would change the actual voltage readings) on the 
circuit.
6. Satisfactory? Because we solved for the unknown terms and then 
tested to see if they worked, we validated the results. They can now 
be presented as a solution to the problem.

 Summary
1. A sinusoid is a signal in the form of the sine or cosine function. It 
has the general form
v(t) = Vm cos(ωt + ϕ)
where Vm is the amplitude, ω = 2πf is the angular frequency, (ωt + ϕ) 
is the argument, and ϕ is the phase.
2. A phasor is a complex quantity that represents both the magnitude 
and the phase of a sinusoid. Given the sinusoid v(t) = Vm cos(ωt + ϕ), 
its phasor V is
V = Vm ⧸ ϕ
3. In ac circuits, v
oltage and current phasors al
ways ha ve a 
fixed  relation to one another at an
y moment of time. If 
v(t) =  
Vm cos(ωt + ϕv) represents the v oltage through an element and  
i(t) = Im cos(ωt + ϕi) represents the current through the element, 
then ϕi = ϕv if the element is a resistor , ϕi leads ϕv by 90° if the 
element is a capacitor , and ϕi lags ϕv by 90° if the element is an 
inductor.
4. The impedance Z of a circuit is the ratio of the phasor voltage across 
it to the phasor current through it:
Z =  V 
__ 
I  = R(ω) + jX(ω)
The admittance Y is the reciprocal of impedance:
Y =  1 
__ 
Z  = G(ω) + jB(ω)
Impedances are combined in series or in parallel the same w ay as 
resistances in series or parallel; that is, impedances 
in series add 
while admittances in parallel add.
5. For a resistor Z = R, for an inductor Z = jX = jωL, and for a capaci-
tor Z = −jX = 1∕jωC.
6. Basic circuit la ws (Ohm’s and Kirchhof f’s) apply to ac circuits in 
the same manner as they do for dc circuits; that is,
 
V = ZI
 
Σ Ik = 0 (KCL)
 
Σ Vk = 0 (KVL)

Problems
401
7. The techniques of voltage/current division, series/parallel combina-
tion of impedance/admittance, circuit reduction, and Y-∆ transfor-
mation all apply to ac circuit analysis.
8. AC circuits are applied in phase-shifters and bridges.

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Software Engineering
Software engineering is that aspect of engineering that deals with the 
practical application of scientific knowledge in the design, construction, 
and v alidation of computer programs and the associated documenta
‑
tion required to de velop, operate, and maintain them. It is a branch of 
electrical engineering that is becoming increasingly important as more 
and more disciplines require one form of software package or another to 
perform routine tasks and as programmable micro electronic systems are 
used in more and more applications.
The role of a softw
are engineer should not be confused with
that of a computer scientist; the softw
are engineer is a practitioner
, 
not  a theoretician. A softw are engineer should ha ve good computer ‑ 
pro gramming skills and be familiar with programming languages, in par‑
ticular C++, which is becoming increasingly popular. Because hardware 
and software are closely interlinked, it is essential that a softw are engi‑
neer have a thorough understanding of hardware design. Most important, 
the software engineer should ha ve some specialized kno wledge of the 
area in which the software development skill is to be applied.
All in all, the field of software engineering offers a great career  
to those who enjo y programming and de veloping softw are packages. 
The higher rewards will go to those having the best preparation, with 
the most interesting and challenging opportunities going to those with 
graduate education.

Chapter 10
Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
10.1
 Introduction 
In Chapter 9, we learned that the forced or steady ‑state response of cir‑
cuits to sinusoidal inputs can be obtained by using phasors. We also know 
that Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws are applicable to ac circuits. In this 
chapter, we want to see ho w nodal analysis, mesh analysis, Thevenin’s 
theorem, Norton’s theorem, superposition, and source transformations 
are applied in analyzing ac circuits. Since these techniques were already 
introduced for dc circuits, our major effort here will be to illustrate with 
examples.
Analyzing ac circuits usually requires three steps.
Steps to Analyze AC Circuits:
1. Transform the circuit to the phasor or frequency domain.
2. Solve the problem using circuit techniques (nodal analysis, 
mesh analysis, superposition, etc.).
3. Transform the resulting phasor to the time domain.
Step 1 is not necessary if the problem is specified in the frequency  
domain. In step 2, the analysis is performed in the same manner as dc 
circuit analysis except that complex numbers are involved. Having read 
Chapter 9, we are adept at handling step 3.
Toward the end of the chapter , we learn ho w to apply PSpice in 
solving ac circuit problems. We finally apply ac circuit analysis to two 
practical ac circuits: oscillators and ac transistor circuits.
10.2
 Nodal Analysis
The basis of nodal analysis is Kirchhof
f’s current la w. Since KCL is 
valid for phasors, as demonstrated in Section 9.6, we can analyze ac cir‑
cuits by nodal analysis. The following examples illustrate this.
Frequency domain analysis of an ac 
 circuit via phasors is much easier 
than analysis of the circuit in the 
time domain.
Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Analyze electrical circuits in the frequency domain using 
nodal analysis.
2. Analyze electrical circuits in the frequency domain using  
mesh analysis.
3. Apply the superposition principle to frequency domain  
electrical circuits.
4. Apply source transformation in frequency domain circuits.
5. Understand how Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits can 
be used in the frequency domain.
6. Analyze electrical circuits with op amps.

mesh analysis is that it is to be applied to planar circuits.

Superposition Theorem
419
10.4
 Superposition Theorem
Since ac circuits are linear, the superposition theorem applies to ac
 
circuits the same way it applies to dc circuits. The theorem becomes  
important if the circuit has sources operating at different frequencies. 
In this case, since the impedances depend on frequency, we must have 
a different frequency domain circuit for each frequency. The total re ‑
sponse must be obtained by adding the individual responses in the time
domain. It is incorrect to try to add the responses in the phasor or fre‑
quency domain. Why? Because the exponential factor ejωt is implicit 
in sinusoidal analysis, and that factor would change for every angular 
frequency ω. It would therefore not make sense to add responses at
 
different frequencies in the phasor domain. Thus, when a circuit has  
sources operating at different frequencies, one must add the responses 
due to the individual frequencies in the time domain.
Use the superposition theorem to find Io in the circuit in Fig. 10.7.
Solution:
Let
 
Io = I′ o + I″ o 
(10.5.1)
where I′ o and I″ o are due to the voltage and current sources, respectively. 
To find I′ o, consider the circuit in Fig. 10.12(a). If we let Z be the parallel 
combination of −j2 and 8 + j10, then
Z =  −j2(8 + j10)  
____________  
−2j + 8 + j10  = 0.25 − j2.25
and current I′ o is
I′ o =

(8 + j8)I1 − j10I3 + j2I2 = 0

From Eqs. (10.5.4) and (10.5.5),
(4 − j4)I2 + j2I1 + j10 = 0
Expressing I1 in terms of I2 gives
 
I1 = (2 + j2)I2 − 5 
(10.5.6)
Substituting Eqs. (10.5.5) and (10.5.6) into Eq. (10.5.3), we get

From Eqs. (10.5.2) and (10.5.7), we write
Io = I′ o + I″ o = −5 + j3.529 = 6.12∕144.78° A
which agrees with what we got in Example 10.3. It should be noted that 
applying the superposition theorem is not the best way to solve this prob‑
lem. It seems that we have made the problem twice as hard as the origi ‑
nal one by using superposition. However, in Example 10.6, superposi ‑
tion is clearly the easiest approach.

Solution:
Because the circuit operates at three different frequencies (ω = 0 for the 
dc voltage source), one way to obtain a solution is to use superposition, 
which breaks the problem into single‑frequency problems. So we let
 
vo = v1 + v2 + v3 
(10.6.1)

Find vo of the circuit of Fig. 10.13 using the superposition theorem.

where v1 is due to the 5‑V dc voltage source, v2 is due to the 10 cos 2t V 
voltage source, and v3 is due to the 2 sin 5t A current source.
 
To find v1, we set to zero all sources except the 5‑V dc source. We 
recall that at steady state, a capacitor is an open circuit to dc while an 
inductor is a short circuit to dc. There is an alternative way of looking 
at this. Because ω = 0, jωL = 0, 1∕jωC = ∞. Either way, the equivalent 
circuit is as shown in Fig. 10.14(a). By voltage division,

involves transforming a voltage source in series with an impedance to 
a current source in parallel with an impedance, or vice versa. As we go

 Thevenin and Norton 
Equivalent Circuits
Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems are applied to ac circuits in the same 
way as they are to dc circuits. The only additional effort arises from the 
need to manipulate complex numbers. The frequency domain version of 
a Thevenin equivalent circuit is depicted in Fig. 10.20, where a linear 
circuit is replaced by a voltage source in series with an impedance. The 
Norton equivalent circuit is illustrated in Fig. 10.21, where a linear cir ‑
cuit is replaced by a current source in parallel with an impedance. Keep 
in mind that the two equivalent circuits are related as
 
VTh = ZNIN,  
ZTh = ZN 
 
(10.2)
just as in source transformation. VTh is the open‑circuit voltage while IN
is the short‑circuit current.
If the circuit has sources operating at dif
ferent frequencies (see 
Example 10.6, for example), the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit 
must be determined at each frequenc y. This leads to entirely dif ferent 
equivalent circuits, one for each frequenc y, not one equi valent circuit 
with equivalent sources and equivalent impedances.

Solution:
Our first objective is to find the Norton equivalent at terminals a-b. ZN

in Fig. 10.29(a). As evident from the figure, the (8 − j2) and (10 + j4) 
impedances are short-circuited, so that
ZN = 5 Ω
 
To get IN, we short-circuit terminals a-b as in Fig. 10.29(b) and  
apply mesh analysis. Notice that meshes 2 and 3 form a supermesh  
because of the current source linking them. For mesh 1,
 
−j40 + (18 + j2)I1 − (8 − j2)I2 − (10 + j4)I3 = 0

 Op Amp AC Circuits
The three steps stated in Section 10.1 also apply to op amp circuits, as 
long as the op amp is operating in the linear region. As usual, we will 
assume ideal op amps. (See Section 5.2.) As discussed in Chapter 5, the 
key to analyzing op amp circuits is to keep two important properties of 
an ideal op amp in mind:
1. No current enters either of its input terminals.
2. The voltage across its input terminals is zero.
The following examples will illustrate these ideas.
Determine vo(t) for the op amp circuit in Fig. 10.31(a) if 
vs =

 AC Analysis Using PSpice
PSpice affords a big relief from the tedious task of manipulating com‑
plex numbers in ac circuit analysis. The procedure for using PSpice
for ac analysis is quite similar to that required for dc analysis. The
 
reader should read Section D.5 in Appendix D for a review of PSpice
concepts for ac analysis. AC circuit analysis is done in the phasor 
or frequency domain, and all sources must have the same frequency. 
Although ac analysis with 
PSpice involves using AC Sweep, our
 
analysis in this chapter requires a single frequency f = ω∕2π. The out‑
put file of PSpice contains voltage and current phasors. If necessary, 
the impedances can be calculated using the voltages and currents in 
the output file.

flows from node 0 to node 3 in conformity with the original circuit in

set the attributes of IPRINT and VPRINT1 each to AC = yes, MAG =

Setup/AC Sweep and enter Total Pts = 1, Start Freq = 159.155, and 
Final Freq = 159.155. After saving the schematic, we simulate it by 
 
selecting Analysis/Simulate. The output file includes the source fre‑

Find V1 and V2 in the circuit of Fig. 10.38.
Solution:
1. Define. In its present form, the problem is clearly stated. Again, 
we must emphasize that time spent here will save lots of time and 
expense later on! One thing that might have created a problem 
for you is that, if the reference was missing for this problem, you 
would then need to ask the individual assigning the problem where 
Example 10.14

10.8
AC Analysis Using PSpice
433
it is to be located. If you could not do that, then you would need to 
assume where it should be and then clearly state what you did and 
why you did it.
2. Present. The given circuit is a frequency domain circuit and the  
unknown node voltages V1 and V2 are also frequency domain  
values. Clearly, we need a process to solve for these unknowns in 
the frequency domain.
3. Alternative. We have two direct alternative solution techniques 
that we can easily use. We can do a straightforward nodal  
analysis approach or use PSpice. Since this example is in a  
section dedicated to using PSpice to solve problems, we will 
use PSpice to find V1 and V2. We can then use nodal analysis 
to check the answer.
4. Attempt. The circuit in Fig. 10.35 is in the time domain, whereas 
the one in Fig. 10.38 is in the frequency domain. Since we are not 
given a particular frequency and PSpice requires one, we select any 
frequency consistent with the given impedances. For example, if 
we select ω = 1 rad/s, the corresponding frequency is f = ω∕2π = 
0.15916 Hz. We obtain the values of the capacitance (C =  
1∕ωXC) and inductances (L = XL∕ω). Making these changes  
results in the schematic in Fig. 10.39. To ease wiring, we have  
exchanged the positions of the voltage‑controlled current source

and  
V2 = 6.911⧸ −80.72° V
5. Evaluate. One of the most important lessons to be learned is that 
when using programs such as PSpice you still need to validate 
the answer. There are many opportunities for making a mistake, 
including coming across an unknown “bug” in PSpice that yields 
incorrect results.
So, how can we validate this solution? Obviously, we can 
rework the entire problem with nodal analysis, and perhaps using 
MATLAB, to see if we obtain the same results. There is another 
way we will use here: Write the nodal equations and substitute the 
answers obtained in the PSpice solution, and see if the nodal  
equations are satisfied.
The nodal equations for this circuit are given below. Note we 
have substituted V1 = Vx into the dependent source.

1.9144⧸ 40.76° V1 − 0.3536⧸ 45° V2 = 3
Now, to check the answer, we substitute the PSpice answers  
into this.
1.9144⧸ 40.76° × 2.708⧸ −56.74° − 0.3536⧸ 45° × 6.911⧸ −80.72°

= 4.984 − j1.4272 − 1.9842 + j1.4269
 
= 3 − j0.0003  
[Answer checks]
6. Satisfactory? Although we used only the equation from node 1 
to check the answer, this is more than satisfactory to validate the 
answer from the PSpice solution. We can now present our work as 
a solution to the problem.

The concepts learned in this chapter will be applied in later chapters 
to calculate electric power and determine frequency response. The con ‑

transistor circuits, filters, oscillators, and other ac circuits. In this section, 
we apply the concepts to develop two practical ac circuits: the capaci

tance multiplier and the sine wave oscillators.
10.9.1  Capacitance Multiplier
The op amp circuit in Fig. 10.41 is known as a capacitance multiplier, 
for reasons that will become obvious. Such a circuit is used in integrated
‑
circuit technology to produce a multiple of a small physical capacitance 
C when a large capacitance is needed. The circuit in Fig. 10.41 can be 
used to multiply capacitance values by a factor up to 1,000. For exam‑
ple, a 10‑pF capacitor can be made to behave like a 100‑nF capacitor.

Sinusoidal Steady-State Analysis
In Fig. 10.41, the first op amp operates as a voltage follower, while 
the second one is an inverting amplifier. The voltage follower iso‑
lates the capacitance formed by the circuit from the loading imposed 
by the inverting amplifier. Since no current enters the input terminals 
of the op amp, the input current Ii flows through the feedback capaci‑
tor. Hence, at node 1,
 
Ii =  Vi − Vo

Thus, by a proper selection of the values of R1 and R2, the op amp circuit 
in Fig. 10.41 can be made to produce an effective capacitance between 
the input terminal and ground, which is a multiple of the physical capaci‑
tance C. The size of the effective capacitance is practically limited by 
the inverted output voltage limitation. Thus, the larger the capacitance 
multiplication, the smaller is the allowable input voltage to prevent the 
op amps from reaching saturation.
A similar op amp circuit can be designed to simulate inductance. 
(See Prob. 10.89.) There is also an op amp circuit configuration to create 
a resistance multiplier.

10.9.2  Oscillators
We know that dc is produced by batteries. But how do we produce ac? 
One way is using oscillators, which are circuits that convert dc to ac.
Determine the equivalent capacitance of the op amp circuit in Fig. 10.41 
if R1 = 10 kΩ, R2 = 10 MΩ, and C = 10 nF.
Answer: 10 μF.
Practice Problem 10.15
An oscillator is a circuit that produces an ac waveform as output when 
powered by a dc input.
The only external source an oscillator needs is the dc power supply. 
Ironically, the dc power supply is usually obtained by converting the ac 
supplied by the electric utility company to dc. Having gone through the 
trouble of conversion, one may wonder why we need to use the oscillator 
to convert the dc to ac again. The problem is that the ac supplied by the 
utility company operates at a preset frequenc y of 60 Hz in the United 
States (50 Hz in some other nations), whereas man y applications such 
as electronic circuits, communication systems, and micro wave devices 
require internally generated frequencies that range from 0 to 10 GHz or 
higher. Oscillators are used for generating these frequencies.
In order for sine w ave oscillators to sustain oscillations, the y must 
meet the Barkhausen criteria:
1. The overall gain of the oscillator must be unity or greater. Therefore, 
losses must be compensated for by an amplifying device.
2. The overall phase shift (from input to output and back to the input) 
must be zero.
Three common types of sine wave oscillators are phase
‑shift, twin T, 
and Wien ‑bridge oscillators. Here we consider only the Wien
‑bridge 
oscillator.
The Wien-bridge oscillator is widely used for generating sinusoids 
in the frequency range below 1 MHz. It is an RC op amp circuit with only 
a few components, easily tunable and easy to design. As shown in Fig. 
10.42, the oscillator essentially consists of a noninverting amplifier with 
two feedback paths: The positive feedback path to the noninverting input 
creates oscillations, while the ne gative feedback path to the in verting 
input controls the gain. If we define the impedances of the RC series and 
parallel combinations as Zs and Zp, then

To satisfy the second Barkhausen criterion, V2 must be in phase with Vo, 
which implies that the ratio in Eq. (10.11) must be purely real. Hence, 
the imaginary part must be zero. Setting the imaginary part equal to zero

C = 159 pF to satisfy 
Eq. (10.16.1). Since the gain must be 3, 
Rf∕Rg = 2. We could select  
Rf = 20 kΩ while Rg = 10 kΩ.

 Summary
1. We apply nodal and mesh analysis to ac circuits by applying KCL 
and KVL to the phasor form of the circuits.
2. In solving for the steady ‑state response of a circuit that has inde ‑
pendent sources with different frequencies, each independent source 
must be considered separately. The most natural approach to analyz‑
ing such circuits is to apply the superposition theorem. A separate 
phasor circuit for each frequency must be solved independently, and 
the corresponding response should be obtained in the time domain. 
The overall response is the sum of the time domain responses of all 
the individual phasor circuits.
3. The concept of source transformation is also applicable in the fre ‑
quency domain.
4. The Thevenin equivalent of an ac circuit consists of a voltage source 
VTh in series with the Thevenin impedance ZTh.
5. The Norton equivalent of an ac circuit consists of a current source IN
in parallel with the Norton impedance ZN (=ZTh).
6. PSpice is a simple and powerful tool for solving ac circuit problems. 
It relieves us of the tedious task of working with the complex num‑
bers involved in steady‑state analysis.
7. The capacitance multiplier and the ac oscillator provide two typical 
applications for the concepts presented in this chapter . A capaci‑
tance multiplier is an op amp circuit used in producing a multiple of 
a physical capacitance. An oscillator is a device that uses a dc input 
to generate an ac output.

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Power Systems
The discovery of the principle of an ac generator by Michael Faraday in 
1831 was a major breakthrough in engineering; it provided a convenient 
way of generating the electric po wer that is needed in e very electronic, 
electrical, or electromechanical device we use now.
Electric power is obtained by converting energy from sources such 
as fossil fuels (gas, oil, and coal), nuclear fuel (uranium), h ydro energy 
(water falling through a head), geothermal energy (hot water, steam), 
wind energy, tidal energy, and biomass ener gy (wastes). These various 
ways of generating electric po wer are studied in detail in the field of 
power engineering, which has become an indispensable subdiscipline 
of electrical engineering. An electrical engineer should be familiar with 
the analysis, generation, transmission, distrib ution, and cost of electric 
power.
The electric po wer industry is a v ery large employer of electrical 
engineers. The industry includes thousands of electric utility systems 
ranging from large, interconnected systems serving large regional areas 
to small power companies serving individual communities or f actories. 
Due to the comple xity of the po wer industry, there are numerous elec -
trical engineering jobs in dif ferent areas of the industry: po wer plant 
(generation), transmission and distribution, maintenance, research, data 
acquisition and flow control, and management. Since electric po wer is 
used e verywhere, electric utility companies are e
verywhere, of fering 
exciting training and steady emplo yment for men and w omen in thou -
sands of communities throughout the world.

Chapter 11
AC Power Analysis
11.1
Introduction
Our effort in ac circuit analysis so f ar has been focused mainly on cal -
culating voltage and current. Our major concern in this chapter is power 
analysis.
Power analysis is of paramount importance. Po
wer is the most 
important quantity in electric utilities, electronic, and communication 
systems, because such systems in
volve transmission of po wer from 
one point to another . Also, e very industrial and household electrical
 
device—every fan, motor, lamp, pressing iron, TV, personal c omputer—
has a po wer rating that indicates ho w much po wer the equipment re -
quires; e xceeding the po wer rating can do permanent damage to an 
appliance. The most common form of electric power is 50- or 60-Hz ac 
power. The choice of ac o ver dc allowed high-voltage power transmis-
sion from the power generating plant to the consumer.
We will be gin by defining and deriving instantaneous power  and 
average power. We will then introduce other power concepts. As practical 
applications of these concepts, we will discuss how power is measured and 
reconsider how electric utility companies charge their customers.
11.2
Instantaneous and Average Power
As mentioned in Chapter 2, the instantaneous power p(t) absorbed by an 
element is the product of the instantaneous v oltage v(t) across the ele -
ment and the instantaneous current i(t) through it. Assuming the passive 
sign convention,
p(t) = v(t)i(t)
 
(11.1)
The instantaneous power (in watts) is the power at any instant of time.
 
It is the rate at which an element absorbs energy.
 
Consider the general case of instantaneous po wer absorbed by an 
arbitrary combination of circuit elements under sinusoidal excitation, as 
We can also think of the instantaneous 
power as the power absorbed by the 
element at a specific instant of time. 
 Instantaneous quantities are denoted 
by lowercase letters.
Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Fully understand instantaneous and average power.
2. Understand the basics of maximum average power.
3. Understand effective or rms values and how to calculate them 
and to understand their importance.
4. Understand apparent power (complex power), power, and reac-
tive power and power factor.
5. Understand power factor correction and the importance of its use.

Instantaneous and Average Power

shown in Fig. 11.1. Let the v oltage and current at the terminals of the 
circuit be
v(t) = Vm cos(ωt + θv) 
(11.2a)
 
i(t) = Im cos(ωt + θi) 
(11.2b)
where Vm and Im are the amplitudes (or peak values), and θv and θi are the 
phase angles of the voltage and current, respectively. The instantaneous 
power absorbed by the circuit is
 
p(t) = v(t)i(t) = VmIm cos(ωt + θv) cos(ωt + θi) 
(11.3)
We apply the trigonometric identity
 
cos A cos B =   1 
__ 2   [cos(A − B) + cos(A + B)] 
(11.4)
and express Eq. (11.3) as
p(t) =  1 
__ 2   VmIm cos(θv − θi) +   1 
__ 2   VmIm cos(2ωt + θv + θi) 
(11.5)
This shows us that the instantaneous power has two parts. The first part 
is constant or time independent. Its value depends on the phase differ-
ence between the voltage and the current. The second part is a sinusoidal 
function whose frequency is 2ω, which is twice the angular frequency of 
the voltage or current.
 
A sketch of p(t) in Eq. (11.5) is shown in Fig. 11.2, where T = 2π∕ω 
is the period of v oltage or current. We observ e that p(t) is periodic,  
p(t) = p(t + T0), and has a period of T0 = T∕2, since its frequency is twice 
that of voltage or current. We also observe that p(t) is positive for some 
part of each c ycle and ne gative for the rest of the c ycle. When p(t) is 
positive, power is absorbed by the circuit. When p(t) is negative, power 
is absorbed by the source; that is, power is transferred from the circuit to 
the source. This is possible because of the storage elements (capacitors 
and inductors) in the  circuit.

The instantaneous power changes with time and is therefore difficult 
to measure. The average power is more convenient to measure. In f act, 
the wattmeter, the instrument for measuring power, responds to average 
power.

Thus, the average power is given by

(11.6)
Although Eq. (11.6) shows the averaging done over T, we would get the 
same result if we performed the integration over the actual period of p(t) 
which is T0 = T∕2.
 
Substituting p(t) in Eq. (11.5) into Eq. (11.6) gives

(11.7)
The first integrand is constant, and the average of a constant is the same 
constant. The second integrand is a sinusoid. We know that the average 
of a sinusoid over its period is zero because the area under the sinusoid 
during a positive half-cycle is canceled by the area under it during the 
following negative half-cycle. Thus, the second term in Eq. (11.7) v an-
ishes and the average power becomes
 
P =  1 
__ 2    VmIm cos(θv − θi) 
(11.8)
Since cos(θv − θi) = cos(θi − θv), what is important is the difference in the 
phases of the voltage and current.
 
Note that p(t) is time-varying while P does not depend on time. To 
find the instantaneous power, we must necessarily have v(t) and i(t) in the 
time domain. But we can find the average power when voltage and cur-
rent are expressed in the time domain, as in Eq. (11.8), or when they are 
expressed in the frequency domain. The phasor forms of v(t) and i(t) in 
Eq. (11.2) are V = Vm⧸ θv and I = Im⧸ θi, respectively. P is calculated using 
Eq. (11.8) or using phasors V and I. To use phasors, we notice that
     
   1 
__ 2    VI* =    1 
__ 2    VmIm⧸ θv − θi 
(11.9)
   =  1 
__ 2   VmIm[cos(θv − θi) + j sin(θv − θi)]
We recognize the real part of this e
xpression as the a verage power P  
according to Eq. (11.8). Thus,
 
P =   1 
__ 2  Re[VI*] =  1 
__ 2  VmIm cos(θv − θi)
 
(11.10)
 
Consider two special cases of Eq. (11.10). When θv = θi, the voltage 
and current are in phase. This implies a purely resistive circuit or resis-
tive load R, and
 
P =  1 
__ 2   VmIm =  1 
__ 2    I2
mR =  1 
__ 2   ∣I∣2R 
(11.11)

11.2
Instantaneous and Average Power

where ∣I∣2 = I × I*. Equation (11.11) shows that a purely resistive circuit 
absorbs power at all times. When θv − θi = ±90°, we have a purely reac-
tive circuit, and
 
P =  1 
__ 2    VmIm cos 90° = 0 
(11.12)
showing that a purely reacti
ve circuit absorbs no a
verage po wer. In 
summary,
A resistive load (R) absorbs power at all times, while a reactive load  
(L or C) absorbs zero average power.
Example 11.1
Given that
v(t) = 120 cos(377t + 45°) V and i(t) = 10 cos(377t − 10°) A
find the instantaneous power and the a verage power absorbed by the 
passive linear network of Fig. 11.1.
Solution:
The instantaneous power is given by
p = vi = 1200 cos(377t + 45°) cos(377t − 10°)
Applying the trigonometric identity
cos A cos B =   1 
__ 2  [cos(A + B) + cos(A − B)]
gives
p = 600[cos(754t + 35°) + cos 55°]
or
p(t) = 344.2 + 600 cos(754t + 35°) W
The average power is
P =  1 
__ 2 VmIm cos(θv − θi) =   1 
__ 2 120(10) cos[45° − (−10°)]
 
= 600 cos 55° = 344.2 W
which is the constant part of p(t) above.
Calculate the instantaneous power and average power absorbed by the 
passive linear network of Fig. 11.1 if
v(t) = 330 cos(10t + 20°) V  
and  
i(t) = 33 sin(10t + 60°) A
Answer: 3.5 + 5.445 cos(20t − 10°) kW, 3.5 kW.

source and the average power absorbed by the resistor.

The average power supplied by the voltage source is

The current through the resistor is

Instantaneous and Average Power

Solution:
We apply mesh analysis as shown in Fig. 11.5(b). For mesh 1,
I1 = 4 A
For mesh 2,
( j10 − j5)I2 − j10I1 + 60⧸ 30° = 0,  
I1 = 4 A
or
j5I2 = −60⧸ 30°  + j40  
⇒  
I2 = −12⧸ −60° + 8
              
 = 10.58⧸ 79.1° A
For the voltage source, the current flowing from it is I2 = 10.58⧸ 79.1° A 
and the voltage across it is 60⧸ 30° V, so that the average power is
P5 =  1 
__ 2    (60)(10.58) cos(30° − 79.1°) = 207.8 W
Following the passive sign convention (see Fig. 1.8), this average power 
is absorbed by the source, in view of the direction of I2 and the polarity 
of the voltage source. That is, the circuit is delivering average power to 
the voltage source.
 
For the current source, the current through it is I1 = 4⧸ 0° and the 
voltage across it is
  
 V1 = 20I1 + j10(I1 − I2) = 80 + j10(4 − 2 − j10.39)
            = 183.9 + j20 = 184.984⧸ 6.21° V
The average power supplied by the current source is
P1 = −  1 
__ 2    (184.984)(4) cos(6.21° − 0) = −367.8 W
It is negative according to the passive sign convention, meaning that the 
current source is supplying power to the circuit.
 
For the resistor, the current through it is I1 = 4⧸ 0° and the voltage 
across it is 20I1 = 80⧸ 0°, so that the power absorbed by the resistor is

age across it is −j5I2 = (5⧸ −90°)(10.58⧸ 79.1°) = 52.9⧸ 79.1°− 90°. The 
average power absorbed by the capacitor is
P4 =  1 
__ 2     (52.9)(10.58) cos(−90°) = 0
For the inductor, the current through it is I1 − I2 = 2 − j10.39 = 
10.58⧸ −79.1°. The voltage across it is j10(I1 − I2) = 105.8⧸ −79.1° + 90°. 
Hence, the average power absorbed by the inductor is
P3 =   1

absorbed by the resistor and the voltage source, or

Maximum Average Power Transfer
In Section 4.8 we solv ed the problem of maximizing the po wer deliv-
ered by a power-supplying resistive network to a load RL. Representing 
the circuit by its Thevenin equivalent, we pro ved that the maximum  
power would be delivered to the load if the load resistance is equal to the 
Thevenin resistance RL = RTh. We now extend that result to ac circuits.
 
Consider the circuit in Fig. 11.7, where an ac circuit is connected to 
a load ZL and is represented by its Thevenin equivalent. The load is usu-
ally represented by an impedance, which may model an electric motor, 
an antenna, a TV, and so forth. In rectangular form, the Thevenin imped-
ance ZTh and the load impedance ZL are
 
ZTh = RTh + jXTh 
(11.13a)
 
ZL = RL + jXL 
(11.13b)
Calculate the average power absorbed by each of the five elements in the 
circuit of Fig. 11.6.

Our objective is to adjust the load parameters

RL = RTh, i.e.,

This result is known as the maximum average power transfer theorem for

Effective or RMS Value
The idea of effective value arises from the need to measure the effectiveness 
of a voltage or current source in delivering power to a resistive load.
The effective value of a periodic current is the dc current that delivers 
the same average power to a resistor as the periodic current.
Example 11.6
In the circuit in Fig. 11.11, find the value of RL that will absorb the  
maximum average power. Calculate that power.

When a sinusoidal voltage or current is specified, it is often in terms 
of its maximum (or peak) v alue or its rms v alue, since its average value 
is zero. The power industries specify phasor magnitudes in terms of their 
rms values rather than peak v alues. For instance, the 110 V available at 
every household is the rms value of the voltage from the power company. 
It is convenient in power analysis to express voltage and current in their 
rms values. Also, analog voltmeters and ammeters are designed to read 
directly the rms value of voltage and current, respectively.

Apparent Power and Power Factor

The average power is a product of two terms. The product VrmsIrms is 
known as the apparent power S . The factor cos(θv − θi) is called the 
power factor (pf).
The apparent power is so called because it seems apparent that the power 
should be the voltage-current product, by analogy with dc resisti ve cir-
cuits. It is measured in volt-amperes or VA to distinguish it from the aver-
age or real power, which is measured in watts. The power factor is dimen-
sionless, since it is the ratio of the average power to the apparent power,
pf =   
P
 
__
 
S   = cos(θv − θi)
 
(11.36)
 
The angle θv − θi is called the power factor angle, because it is the 
angle whose cosine is the power factor. The power factor angle is equal 
to the angle of the load impedance if V is the voltage across the load and 
I is the current through it. This is evident from the fact that

The power factor is the cosine of the phase difference between voltage 
and current. It is also the cosine of the angle of the load impedance.
From Eq. (11.36), the power factor may be seen as that factor by which 
the apparent power must be multiplied to obtain the real or average power. 
The value of pf ranges between zero and unity . For a purely resisti ve 
load, the voltage and current are in phase, so that θv − θi = 0 and pf = 1. 
This implies that the apparent po wer is equal to the a verage power. For 
a purely reactive load, θv − θi = ±90° and pf = 0. In this case the a ver-
age power is zero. In between these tw o extreme cases, pf is said to be 
leading or lagging. Leading power factor means that current leads volt-
age, which implies a capaciti ve load. Lagging po wer factor means that 
current lags voltage, implying an inductive load. Power factor affects the 
From Eq. (11.36), the power factor 
may also be regarded as  the ratio of 
the real power dissipated in the load 
to the apparent power of the load.

Complex Power
Considerable effort has been expended over the years to express power 
relations as simply as possible. Power engineers have coined the term 
complex power, which they use to find the total effect of parallel loads. 
Complex power is important in power analysis because it contains all
the information pertaining to the power absorbed by a given load.

Vm⧸ θv and I = Im⧸ θi of voltage v(t) and current i(t), the complex power

Calculate the power factor of the entire circuit of Fig. 11.19 as seen by 
the source. What is the average power supplied by the source?
Answer: 0.936 lagging, 2.008 kW.
Practice Problem 11.10

472 
Chapter 11
AC Power Analysis
Thus, we may write Eq. (11.41) as
S = VrmsIrms⧸ θv − θi 
= VrmsIrms cos(θv − θi) + jVrmsIrms sin(θv − θi) 
(11.44)
This equation can also be obtained from Eq. (11.9). 
We notice from   
Eq. (11.44) that the magnitude of the complex power is the apparent power;  
hence, the comple x power is measured in v olt-amperes (VA). Also, we   
notice that the angle of the complex power is the power factor angle.
 
The complex power may be expressed in terms of the load imped-
ance Z. From Eq. (11.37), the load impedance Z may be written as
 
Z =  V 
__ 
I  =  Vrms 
____ 
Irms
  =  Vrms 
____ 
Irms
  ⧸ θv − θi 
(11.45)
Thus, Vrms = ZIrms. Substituting this into Eq. (11.41) gives
 
S =  I2
rms Z =   V rms  
2   
____ 
Z*  = Vrms I*rms 
 
(11.46)
Since Z = R + jX, Eq. (11.46) becomes
S =  I rms  
2  (R + jX) = P + jQ 
(11.47)
where P and Q are the real and imaginary parts of the complex power; 
that is,
 
P = Re(S) =  I rms  
2  R 
(11.48)
 
Q = Im(S) =  I rms  
2  X 
(11.49)
P is the a verage or real po wer and it depends on the load’ s resistance 
R. Q depends on the load’ s reactance X and is called the reactive (or 
quadrature) power.
 
Comparing Eq. (11.44) with Eq. (11.47), we notice that
P = VrmsIrms cos(θv − θi),  
Q = VrmsIrms sin(θv − θi) 
(11.50)
The real power P is the average power in watts delivered to a load; it is  
the only useful power. It is the actual po wer dissipated by the load. The 
reactive power Q is a measure of the energy exchange between the source 
and the reactive part of the load. The unit of Q is the volt-ampere reactive 
(VAR) to distinguish it from the real po wer, whose unit is the w att. We 
know from Chapter 6 that ener gy storage elements neither dissipate nor  
supply power, but exchange power back and forth with the rest of the net-
work. In the same w ay, the reactive power is being transferred back and 
forth between the load and the source. It represents a lossless interchange 
between the load and the source. Notice that:
1. Q = 0 for resistive loads (unity pf).
2. Q < 0 for capacitive loads (leading pf).
3. Q > 0 for inductive loads (lagging pf).
Thus,
When working with the rms values of 
currents or voltages, we may drop the 
subscript rms if no confusion will be 
caused by doing so.
Complex power (in VA) is the product of the rms voltage phasor and the 
complex conjugate of the rms current phasor. As a complex quantity, its real 
part is real power P and its imaginary part is reactive power Q.

powers directly from voltage and current phasors.

(11.51)
This sho ws ho w the comple x po wer contains all the rele vant po wer 
information in a given load.
It is a standard practice to represent S, P, and Q in the form of a 
triangle, known as the power triangle, shown in Fig. 11.21(a). This is 
similar to the impedance triangle sho
wing the relationship between 
Z, R, and X, illustrated in Fig. 11.21(b). The power triangle has four 
items—the apparent/complex power, real power, reactive power, and the 
power factor angle. Given two of these items, the other two can easily be  
obtained from the triangle. As shown in Fig. 11.22, when S lies in the 
first quadrant, we have an inductive load and a lagging pf. When S lies in 
the fourth quadrant, the load is capacitive and the pf is leading. It is also 
possible for the comple x power to lie in the second or third quadrant. 
This requires that the load impedance have a negative resistance, which 
is possible with active circuits.
S contains all power information of a 
load. The real part of S is the real 
power P; its imaginary part is the 
reactive power Q; its magnitude is the 
apparent power S; and the cosine of 
its phase angle is the power factor pf.

Conservation of AC Power
The principle of conservation of power applies to ac circuits as well as to 
dc circuits (see Section 1.5).
To see this, consider the circuit in Fig. 11.23(a), where two load 
impedances Z1 and Z2 are connected in parallel across an ac source V. 
KCL gives
I = I1 + I2 
(11.52)
The complex power supplied by the source is (from now on, unless oth-
erwise specified, all values of voltages and currents will be assumed to 
be rms values)
 
S = VI* = V(I1* + I2*) = VI*1 + VI2* = S1 + S2

conserved in ac circuits.

Chapter 11
AC Power Analysis
where S1 and S2 denote the comple x powers delivered to loads Z1 and 
Z2, respectively.
 
If the loads are connected in series with the voltage source, as shown 
in Fig. 11.23(b), KVL yields
 
V = V1 + V2 
(11.54)
The complex power supplied by the source is
 
S = VI* = (V1 + V2)I* = V1I* + V2I* = S1 + S2  (11.55)
where S1 and S2 denote the comple x powers delivered to loads Z1 and 
Z2, respectively.
 
We conclude from Eqs. (11.53) and (11.55) that whether the loads 
are connected in series or in parallel (or in general), the total po
wer 
 supplied by the source equals the total power delivered to the load. Thus, 
in general, for a source connected to N loads,
 
S = S1 + S2 + ⋯ + SN
 
 
(11.56)
This means that the total comple x power in a network is the sum of the 
complex powers of the individual components. (This is also true of real 
power and reactive power, but not true of apparent power.) This expresses  
the principle of conservation of ac power:
In fact, all forms of ac power are 
conserved: instantaneous, real, 
reactive, and complex.
The complex, real, and reactive powers of the sources equal the respec-
tive sums of the complex, real, and reactive powers of the individual 
loads.
From this we imply that the real (or reactive) power flow from sources in 
a network equals the real (or reactive) power flow into the other elements 
in the network.

Power Factor Correction
Most domestic loads (such as w ashing machines, air conditioners, and 
refrigerators) and industrial loads (such as induction motors) are induc -
tive and operate at a lo w lagging po wer factor. Although the inducti ve 
nature of the load cannot be changed, we can increase its power factor.
The process of increasing the power factor without altering the voltage or 
current to the original load is known as power factor correction.
Since most loads are inducti ve, as shown in Fig. 11.27(a), a load’ s 
power factor is improved or corrected by deliberately installing a capaci-
tor in parallel with the load, as shown in Fig. 11.27(b). The effect of add-
ing the capacitor can be illustrated using either the power triangle or the 
phasor diagram of the currents in volved. Figure 11.28 shows the latter, 
where it is assumed that the circuit in Fig. 11.27(a) has a power factor of 
cos θ1, while the one in Fig. 11.27(b) has a power factor of cos θ2. It is 
evident from Fig. 11.28 that adding the capacitor has caused the phase 
angle between the supplied voltage and current to reduce from θ1 to θ2, 
thereby increasing the power factor. We also notice from the magnitudes 
of the vectors in Fig. 11.28 that with the same supplied v oltage, the cir-
cuit in Fig. 11.27(a) draws larger current IL than the current I drawn by 
the circuit in Fig. 11.27(b). Power companies charge more for larger cur-
rents, because they result in increased power losses (by a squared factor, 
since P = IL
2R). Therefore, it is beneficial to both the power company and 
the consumer that every effort is made to minimize current level or keep 
the power factor as close to unity as possible. By choosing a suitable size 
for the capacitor, the current can be made to be completely in phase with 
the voltage, implying unity power factor.
Alternatively, power factor correction 
may be viewed as the addition of a 
reactive element (usually a capacitor) 
in parallel with the load in order to 
make the power factor closer to unity.
 An inductive load is modeled as a 
 series combination of an inductor and 
a resistor.

We can look at the power factor correction from another perspective. 
Consider the power triangle in Fig. 11.29. If the original inducti ve load

If we desire to increase the po wer factor from cos θ1 to cos θ2 without 
altering the real power (i.e., P = S2 cos θ2), then the new reactive power is
 
Q2 = P tan θ2 
(11.58)
The reduction in the reacti ve power is caused by the shunt capacitor; 
that is,

Although the most common situation in practice is that of an induc-
tive load, it is also possible that the load is capaciti ve; that is, the load 
is operating at a leading power factor. In this case, an inductor should 
be connected across the load for po wer factor correction. The required

Applications
In this section, we consider two important application areas: how power 
is measured and how electric utility companies determine the cost of 
electricity consumption.
11.9.1  Power Measurement
The average power absorbed by a load is measured by an instrument 
called the wattmeter.
The wattmeter is the instrument used for measuring the average power.
Figure 11.30 sho ws a w attmeter that consists essentially of tw o 
coils: the current coil and the voltage coil. A current coil with very low 
impedance (ideally zero) is connected in series with the load (Fig. 11.31) 
and responds to the load current. The voltage coil with very high imped-
ance (ideally infinite) is connected in parallel with the load as shown in 
Fig. 11.31 and responds to the load v oltage. The current coil acts like a 
short circuit because of its low impedance; the voltage coil behaves like 
Reactive power is measured by an 
 instrument called the varmeter. The 
varmeter is often connected to the 
load in the same way as the wattmeter.
 Some wattmeters do not have coils; 
the wattmeter considered here is the 
electromagnetic type.
Find the value of parallel capacitance needed to correct a load of 
140 kVAR at 0.85 lagging pf to unity pf. Assume that the load is sup
-

an open circuit because of its high impedance. As a result, the presence 
of the w attmeter does not disturb the circuit or ha
ve an ef fect on the 
power measurement.
When the two coils are energized, the mechanical inertia of the mov-
ing system produces a deflection angle that is proportional to the average 
value of the product v(t)i(t). If the current and voltage of the load are v(t) 
= Vm cos(ωt + θv) and i(t) = Im cos(ωt + θi), their corresponding rms 
 phasors are

and the wattmeter measures the average power given by
 
P = |Vrms| |Irms| cos(θv − θi) = Vrms Irms cos(θv − θi) 
(11.63)
 
As shown in Fig. 11.31, each wattmeter coil has two terminals 
with one marked ±. To ensure upscale deflection, the ± terminal of 
the current coil is toward the source, while the ± terminal of the volt-
age coil is connected to the same line as the current coil. Re versing 
both coil connections still results in upscale deflection. However, re-
versing one coil and not the other results in downscale deflection and 
no wattmeter reading.

2. Present. This problem consists of finding the average power deliv-

3. Alternative. This is a straightforward circuit problem where all we 
need to do is find the magnitude and phase of the current through the 
load and the magnitude and the phase of the voltage across the load. 
These quantities could also be found by using PSpice, which we will 
use as a check.
4. Attempt. In Fig. 11.32, the w attmeter reads the average power ab-
sorbed by the (8  − j6) Ω impedance because the current coil is in 
series with the impedance while the v oltage coil is in parallel with 
it. The current through the circuit is

11.9.2  Electricity Consumption Cost
In Section 1.7, we considered a simplified model of the way the cost of  
electricity consumption is determined. But the concept of po wer factor 
was not included in the calculations. Now we consider the importance of 
power factor in electricity consumption cost.
 
Loads with low power factors are costly to serve because they  require 
large currents, as explained in Section 11.8. The ideal situation would be 
to draw minimum current from a supply so that S = P, Q = 0, and pf = 1. 
A load with nonzero Q means that energy flows back and forth between 
the load and the source, gi ving rise to additional po wer losses. In vie w 
of this, power companies often encourage their customers to have power 
factors as close to unity as possible and penalize some customers who do 
not improve their load power factors.
 
Utility companies divide their customers into categories: as residen-
tial (domestic), commercial, and industrial, or as small po wer, medium 
power, and large power. They have different rate structures for each cat-
egory. The amount of energy consumed in units of kilowatt-hours (kWh) 
is measured using a kilo
watt-hour meter installed at the customer’
s 
premises.
 
Although utility companies use different methods for charging cus-
tomers, the tarif f or char ge to a consumer is often tw o-part. The first  
part is fixed and corresponds to the cost of generation, transmission, 
 
and distribution of electricity to meet the load requirements of the con -
sumers. This part of the tarif f is generally e xpressed as a certain price  
For the circuit in Fig. 11.33, find the wattmeter reading.

per kW of maximum demand. Or it may be based on kVA of maximum 
demand, to account for the power factor (pf) of the consumer. A pf pen-
alty charge may be imposed on the consumer whereby a certain percent-
age of kW or kVA maximum demand is charged for every 0.01 fall in pf 
below a prescribed value, say 0.85 or 0.9. On the other hand, a pf credit 
may be given for every 0.01 that the pf exceeds the prescribed value.
The second part is proportional to the ener gy consumed in kWh; it 
may be in graded form, for example, the first 100 kWh at 16 cents/kWh, the 
next 200 kWh at 10 cents/kWh and so forth. Thus, the bill is determined 
based on the following equation:
Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Cost of Energy 
(11.64)
Example 11.17
A manufacturing industry consumes 200 MWh in one month. If the 
maximum demand is 1,600 kW, calculate the electricity bill based on the 
following two-part rate:
Demand charge: $5.00 per month per kW of billing demand.
Energy charge: 8 cents per kWh for the first 50,000 kWh, 5 cents 
per kWh for the remaining energy.
Solution:
The demand charge is
$5.00 × 1,600 = $8,000 
(11.17.1)
The energy charge for the first 50,000 kWh is
 
$0.08 × 50,000 = $4,000 
(11.17.2)
The remaining energy is 200,000 kWh − 50,000 kWh = 150,000 kWh, and 
the corresponding energy charge is
 
$0.05 × 150,000 = $7,500 
(11.17.3)
Adding the results of Eqs. (11.17.1) to (11.17.3) gives
Total bill for the month = $8,000 + $4,000 + $7,500 = $19,500
It may appear that the cost of electricity is too high. But this is often a small 
fraction of the overall cost of production of the goods manufactured or the  
selling price of the finished product.
The monthly reading of a paper mill’s meter is as follows:
Maximum demand: 48,000 kW
Energy consumed: 750 MWh
Using the two-part rate in Example 11.17, calculate the monthly bill for 
the paper mill.
Answer: $279,000.

Example 11.18
A 300-kW load supplied at 13 kV (rms) operates 520 hours a month at 
80 percent power factor. Calculate the average cost per month based on 
this simplified tariff:
Energy charge: 6 cents per kWh
Power-factor penalty: 0.1 percent of energy charge for every 0.01 
that pf falls below 0.85.
Power-factor credit: 0.1 percent of energy charge for every 0.01 
that pf exceeds 0.85.
Solution:
The energy consumed is
W = 300 kW × 520 h = 156,000 kWh
The operating power factor pf = 80% = 0.8 is 5 × 0.01 below the pre-
scribed power factor of 0.85. Since there is 0.1 percent energy charge for 
every 0.01, there is a power-factor penalty charge of 0.5 percent. This
 
amounts to an energy charge of
∆W = 156,000 ×  5 × 0.1 
______ 
100  = 780 kWh
The total energy is
Wt = W + ∆W = 156,000 + 780 = 156,780 kWh
The cost per month is given by
Cost = 6 cents × Wt = $0.06 × 156,780 = $9,406.80

“An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility” is required 
of every engineer. To some e xtent, this understanding is v ery personal 
for each of us. Let us identify some pointers to help you de
velop this 
understanding. One of my favorite examples is that an engineer has the 
responsibility to answer what I call the “unasked question.” For instance, 
assume that you own a car that has a problem with the transmission. In 
the process of selling that car, the prospective buyer asks you if there is 
a problem in the right-front wheel bearing. You answer no. However, as 
an engineer, you are required to inform the buyer that there is a problem 
with the transmission without being asked.
Your responsibility both professionally and ethically is to perform 
in a manner that does not harm those around you and to whom you are 
responsible. Clearly, developing this capability will tak e time and ma -
turity on your part. I recommend practicing this by looking for profes -

 Introduction
So far in this text, we have dealt with single-phase circuits. A single-
phase ac power system consists of a generator connected through a pair 
of wires (a transmission line) to a load. Figure 12.1(a) depicts a single-
phase two-wire system, where Vp is the rms magnitude of the source 
voltage and ϕ is the phase. What is more common in practice is a single-
phase three-wire system, shown in Fig. 12.1(b). It contains two identical 
sources (equal magnitude and the same phase) that are connected to two 
loads by two outer wires and the neutral. For example, the normal house-
hold system is a single-phase three-wire system because the terminal 
voltages have the same magnitude and the same phase. Such a system 
allows the connection of both 120- and 240-V appliances.

Single-phase systems: (a) two-wire type, (b) three-wire type.
Circuits or systems in which the ac sources operate at the same fre-
quency but different phases are known as polyphase. Figure 12.2 shows 
a two-phase three-wire system, and Fig. 12.3 sho ws a three-phase four-
wire system. As distinct from a single-phase system, a two-phase system 
is produced by a generator consisting of tw o coils placed perpendicular 
to each other so that the voltage generated by one lags the other by 90°. 
By the same token, a three-phase system is produced by a generator con-
sisting of three sources having the same amplitude and frequency but out 
of phase with each other by 120°. Because the three-phase system is by 
far the most pre valent and most economical polyphase system, discus -
sion in this chapter is mainly on three-phase systems.
Three-phase systems are important for at least three reasons. First, 
nearly all electric po wer is generated and distrib uted in three-phase, 
Historical note: Thomas Edison 
invented a three-wire system, using 
three wires instead of four.

Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Understand balanced three-phase voltages.
2. Analyze balanced wye-wye circuits.
3. Understand and analyze balanced wye-delta circuits.
4. Analyze balanced delta-delta circuits.
5. Understand and analyze balanced delta-wye circuits.
6. Explain and analyze power in balanced three-phase circuits.
7. Analyze unbalanced three-phase circuits.

at the operating frequenc y of 60 Hz (or ω = 377 rad/s) in the United 
States or 50 Hz (or ω = 314 rad/s) in some other parts of the w
orld. 
When one-phase or two-phase inputs are required, the y are taken from 
the three-phase system rather than generated independently. Even when 
more than three phases are needed—such as in the aluminum industry , 
where 48 phases are required for melting purposes—the y can be pro -
vided by manipulating the three phases supplied. Second, the instanta -
neous power in a three-phase system can be constant (not pulsating), as 
we will see in Section 12.7. This results in uniform power transmission 
and less vibration of three-phase machines. Third, for the same amount 
of power, the three-phase system is more economical than the single-
phase. The amount of wire required for a three-phase system is less than 
that required for an equivalent single-phase system.
We begin with a discussion of balanced three-phase v oltages. Then 
we analyze each of the four possible configurations of balanced three-
phase systems. We also discuss the analysis of unbalanced three-phase 
systems. We learn how to use PSpice for Windows to analyze a balanced 
or unbalanced three-phase system. Finally, we apply the concepts devel-
oped in this chapter to three-phase po wer measurement and residential 
electrical wiring.
12.2
 Balanced Three-Phase Voltages
Three-phase voltages are often produced with a three-phase ac genera -
tor (or alternator) whose cross-sectional view is shown in Fig. 12.4. The 
generator basically consists of a rotating magnet (called the rotor) sur-
rounded by a stationary winding (called the stator). Three separate wind-
ings or coils with terminals a-a′, b-b′, and c-c′ are physically placed 
120° apart around the stator. Terminals a and a′, for example, stand for 
one of the ends of coils going into and the other end coming out of the

Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was a Croatian-American engineer whose 
inventions—among them the induction motor and the first polyphase 
ac power system—greatly influenced the settlement of the ac versus dc 
debate in favor of ac. He was also responsible for the adoption of 60 Hz 
as the standard for ac power systems in the United States.
Born in Austria-Hungary (now Croatia), to a clergyman, Tesla had 
an incredible memory and a keen affinity for mathematics. He moved 
to the United States in 1884 and first worked for Thomas Edison. At 
that time, the country was in the “battle of the currents” with George 
 Westinghouse (1846–1914) promoting ac and Thomas Edison rigidly 
leading the dc forces. Tesla left Edison and joined Westinghouse be
-
cause of his interest in ac. Through Westinghouse, Tesla gained the 
reputation and acceptance of his polyphase ac generation, transmission, 
and distribution system. He held 700 patents in his lifetime. His other 
inventions include high-voltage apparatus (the tesla coil) and a wireless 
transmission system. The unit of magnetic flux density, the tesla, was 
named in honor of him.

page. As the rotor rotates, its magnetic field “cuts” the flux from the three 
coils and induces voltages in the coils. Because the coils are placed 120° 
apart, the induced voltages in the coils are equal in magnitude but out of 
phase by 120° (Fig. 12.5). Since each coil can be regarded as a single-
phase generator by itself, the three-phase generator can supply power to 
both single-phase and three-phase loads.
A typical three-phase system consists of three voltage sources con-
nected to loads by three or four wires (or transmission lines). (Three-
phase current sources are very scarce.) A three-phase system is equivalent 
to three single-phase circuits. The voltage sources can be either wye-
connected as shown in Fig. 12.6(a) or delta-connected as in Fig. 12.6(b).

Three-phase voltage sources: (a) Y-connected source, (b) ∆-connected 
source.
Let us consider the wye-connected voltages in Fig. 12.6(a) for now. 
The voltages Van, Vbn, and Vcn are respectively between lines a, b, and 
c, and the neutral line n. These voltages are called phase voltages. If the 
voltage sources have the same amplitude and frequency ω and are out of 
phase with each other by 120°, the voltages are said to be balanced. This 
implies that
 
Van + Vbn + Vcn = 0 
(12.1)
 
|Van| = |Vbn| = |Vcn| 
(12.2)
Thus,
Balanced phase voltages are equal in magnitude and are out of phase 
with each other by 120°.
 As a common tradition in power 
 systems, voltage and current in this 
chapter are in rms values unless 
 otherwise stated.

Because the three-phase voltages are 120° out of phase with each 
other, there are tw o possible combinations. One possibility is sho wn in 
Fig. 12.7(a) and expressed mathematically as
Van = Vp⧸ 0°
 
Vbn = Vp⧸ −120°
 
Vcn = Vp⧸ −240° = Vp⧸ +120° 
(12.3)
where Vp is the effective or rms value of the phase voltages. This is 
known as the abc sequence or positive sequence. In this phase sequence, 
Van leads Vbn, which in turn leads Vcn. This sequence is produced when 
the rotor in Fig. 12.4 rotates counterclockwise. The other possibility is 
shown in Fig. 12.7(b) and is given by
 
Van = Vp⧸ 0°
 
Vcn = Vp⧸ −120°
 
Vbn = Vp⧸ −240° = Vp⧸ +120° 
(12.4)
This is called the acb sequence or negative sequence. For this phase se-
quence, Van leads Vcn, which in turn leads Vbn. The acb sequence is pro-
duced when the rotor in Fig. 12.4 rotates in the clockwise direction. It is 
easy to show that the voltages in Eqs. (12.3) or (12.4) satisfy Eqs. (12.1) 
and (12.2). For example, from Eq. (12.3),
 
Van + Vbn + Vcn = Vp⧸ 0° + Vp⧸ −120° + Vp⧸ +120°
 
= Vp(1.0 − 0.5 − j0.866 − 0.5 + j0.866)

Phase sequences: (a) abc or positive

 Reminder: As time increases, each 
 phasor (or sinor) rotates at an angular 
velocity ω.
The phase sequence is the time order in which the voltages pass through 
their respective maximum values.
The phase sequence is determined by the order in which the phasors pass 
through a fixed point in the phase diagram.
In Fig. 12.7(a), as the phasors rotate in the counterclockwise direc-
tion with frequenc y ω, they pass through the horizontal axis in a se
-
quence abcabca . . . . Thus, the sequence is abc or bca or cab. Similarly, 
for the phasors in Fig. 12.7(b), as the y rotate in the counterclockwise 
direction, they pass the horizontal axis in a sequence acbacba .. . . This 
describes the acb sequence. The phase sequence is important in three-
phase power distribution. It determines the direction of the rotation of a 
motor connected to the power source, for example.
Like the generator connections, a three-phase load can be either 
wye-connected or delta-connected, depending on the end application. 
Figure 12.8(a) sho ws a wye-connected load, and Fig. 12.8(b) sho ws a 
delta-connected load. The neutral line in Fig. 12.8(a) may or may not be 
there, depending on whether the system is four - or three-wire. (And, of 
course, a neutral connection is topologically impossible for a delta con -
nection.) A wye- or delta-connected load is said to be unbalanced if the 
phase impedances are not equal in magnitude or phase.
 The phase sequence may also be 
regarded as the order in which the 
phase voltages reach their peak (or 
maximum) values with respect to time.

For a balanced wye-connected load,
Z1 = Z2 = Z3 = ZY 
(12.6)
where ZY is the load impedance per phase. For a balanced delta- connected 
load,
 
Za = Zb = Zc = Z∆ 
(12.7)
where Z∆ is the load impedance per phase in this case. We recall from 
Eq. (9.69) that
 
Z∆ = 3ZY  
or  
ZY =  1 
__ 3  Z∆ 
(12.8)
so we know that a wye-connected load can be transformed into a delta-
connected load, or vice versa, using Eq. (12.8).
Because both the three-phase source and the three-phase load can 
be either wye- or delta-connected, we have four possible connections:
• Y-Y connection (i.e., Y-connected source with a Y-connected load).
• Y-∆ connection.
• ∆-∆ connection.
• ∆-Y connection.
In subsequent sections, we will consider each 
of these possible con -
figurations.
It is appropriate to mention here that a balanced delta-connected load is 
more common than a balanced wye-connected load. This is due to the ease 
with which loads may be added or remo ved from each phase of a delta-
connected load. This is very difficult with a wye-connected load because the 
neutral may not be accessible. On the other hand, delta-connected sources  
are not common in practice because of the circulating current that will result 
in the delta-mesh if the three-phase voltages are slightly unbalanced.
506 
Chapter 12
Three-Phase Circuits
 Reminder: A Y-connected load consists 
of three impedances connected to a 
neutral node, while a ∆-connected 
load consists of three impedances 
 connected around a loop. The load is 
balanced when the three impedances 
are equal in either case.
Example 12.1
Determine the phase sequence of the set of voltages
van = 200 cos(ωt + 10°)
vbn = 200 cos(ωt − 230°),  
vcn = 200 cos(ωt − 110°)
Solution:
The voltages can be expressed in phasor form as
Van = 200⧸ 10° V,  
Vbn = 200⧸ −230° V,  
Vcn = 200⧸ −110° V
We notice that Van leads Vcn by 120° and Vcn in turn leads Vbn by 120°. 
Hence, we have an acb sequence.
Practice Problem 12.1
Given that Vbn = 220⧸ 30° V, find Van and Vcn, assuming a positive (abc) 
sequence.
Answer: 220⧸ 150° V, 220⧸ −90° V.
A balanced load is one in which the phase impedances are equal in 
magnitude and in phase.

12.3
 Balanced Wye-Wye Connection
We begin with the Y-Y system, because any balanced three-phase sys -
tem can be reduced to an equivalent Y-Y system. Therefore, analysis of 
this system should be regarded as the key to solving all balanced three-
phase systems.
12.3
Balanced Wye-Wye Connection
507
A balanced Y-Y system is a three-phase system with a balanced  
Y-connected source and a balanced Y-connected load.
Consider the balanced four-wire Y-Y system of Fig. 12.9, where a 
Y-connected load is connected to a Y-connected source. We assume a 
balanced load so that load impedances are equal. Although the imped-
ance ZY is the total load impedance per phase, it may also be regarded 
as the sum of the source impedance Zs, line impedance Zℓ, and load 
impedance ZL for each phase, since these impedances are in series.
 
As illustrated in Fig. 12.9, Zs denotes the internal impedance of the  
phase winding of the generator; Zℓ is the impedance of the line join -
ing a phase of the source with a phase of the load; ZL is the impedance 
of each phase of the load; and Zn is the impedance of the neutral line. 
Thus, in general
 
ZY = Zs + Zℓ + ZL

Zs and Zℓ are often very small compared with ZL, so one can assume that 
ZY = ZL if no source or line impedance is given. In any event, by lump -
ing the impedances together, the Y-Y system in Fig. 12.9 can be simpli-
fied to that shown in Fig. 12.10.
Assuming the positi ve sequence, the phase v oltages (or line-to-  
neutral voltages) are
Van = Vp⧸ 0°
 
Vbn = Vp⧸ −120°,  
Vcn = Vp⧸ +120° 
(12.10)

The line-to-line voltages or simply line voltages Vab, Vbc, and Vca are 
related to the phase voltages. For example,
 
Vab = Van + Vnb = Van − Vbn = Vp⧸ 0° − Vp⧸ −120° 
(12.11a)
 
= Vp ( 1 +  1 
__ 2  + j   √

3

__
 
3  Vp⧸ 30°
Similarly, we can obtain
 
Vbc = Vbn − Vcn =  √ 
__
 
3  Vp⧸ −90° 
(12.11b)
 
Vca = Vcn − Van =  √ 
__
 
3  Vp⧸ −210° 
(12.11c)
Thus, the magnitude of the line voltages VL is  √ 
__
 
3  times the magnitude of 
the phase voltages Vp, or
 
VL =  √ 
__
 
3  Vp 
(12.12)
where
 
Vp = |Van| = |Vbn| = |Vcn| 
(12.13)
and
 
VL = |Vab| = |Vbc| = |Vca| 
(12.14)
Also the line voltages lead their corresponding phase voltages by 30°. 
Figure 12.11(a) illustrates this. Figure 12.11(a) also shows how to deter-
mine Vab from the phase voltages, while Fig. 12.11(b) shows the same 
for the three line voltages. Notice that Vab leads Vbc by 120°, and Vbc 
leads Vca by 120°, so that the line voltages sum up to zero as do the phase 
voltages.

We can readily infer that the line currents add up to zero,

In = −(Ia + Ib + Ic) = 0

that is, the voltage across the neutral wire is zero. The neutral line can 
thus be removed without affecting the system. In fact, in long distance 
power transmission, conductors in multiples of three are used with the 
earth itself acting as the neutral conductor. Power systems designed in 
this way are well grounded at all critical points to ensure safety.
While the line current is the current in each line, the phase current 
is the current in each phase of the source or load. In the 
Y-Y system, the  
line current is the same as the phase current. We will use single subscripts

currents flow from the source to the load.
An alternative way of analyzing a balanced Y-Y system is to do so 
on a “per phase” basis. We look at one phase, say phase a, and analyze 
the single-phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 12.12. The single-phase analy-
sis yields the line current Ia as

From Ia, we use the phase sequence to obtain other line currents. Thus, 
as long as the system is balanced, we need only analyze one phase. 
We may do this even if the neutral line is absent, as in the three-wire
 
system.
Calculate the line currents in the three-wire Y-Y system of Fig. 12.13.

A balanced Y-∆ system consists of a balanced Y-connected source 
feeding a balanced ∆-connected load.
The balanced Y-delta system is sho wn in Fig. 12.14, where the 
source is Y-connected and the load is ∆-connected. There is, of course, 
no neutral connection from source to load for this case. 
Assuming the 
positive sequence, the phase voltages are again
Van = Vp⧸ 0°
 
Vbn = Vp⧸ −120°,

KCL at nodes A, B, and C. Thus,
 
Ia = IAB − ICA,  
Ib = IBC − IAB,  
Ic = ICA − IBC  (12.23)

(12.27)
Also, the line currents lag the corresponding phase currents by 30°, 
assuming the positive sequence. Figure 12.15 is a phasor diagram illus-
trating the relationship between the phase and line currents.
An alternative way of analyzing the Y-∆ circuit is to transform the

phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 12.16. This allows us to calculate only 
the line currents. The phase currents are obtained using Eq. (12.25) and

 Balanced Delta-Delta Connection
A balanced ∆-∆ system is one in which both the balanced source and 
balanced load are ∆-connected.
The source as well as the load may be delta-connected as sho
wn 
in Fig. 12.17. Our goal is to obtain the phase and line currents as usual. 

Assuming a positive sequence, the phase voltages for a delta-connected 
source are
Vab = Vp⧸ 0°
 
Vbc = Vp⧸ −120°,  
Vca = Vp⧸ +120° 
(12.29)
The line voltages are the same as the phase voltages. From Fig. 12.17, 
assuming there is no line impedances, the phase voltages of the de
lta-
connected source are equal to the voltages across the impedances; that is,
 
Vab = VAB,  
Vbc = VBC,  
Vca = VCA 
(12.30)

Because the load is delta-connected just as in the previous section, some 
of the formulas derived there apply here. The line currents are obtained 
from the phase currents by applying KCL at nodes A, B, and C, as we did 
in the previous section:
 
Ia = IAB − ICA,  
Ib = IBC − IAB,  
Ic = ICA − IBC 
(12.32)
Also, as shown in the last section, each line current lags the corre spond-
ing phase current by 30°; the magnitude IL of the line current is   √

3  times 
the magnitude Ip of the phase current,

the source and the load to their Y equivalents. We already know that 
ZY = Z∆∕3. To convert a ∆-connected source to a Y-connected source, 
see the next section.

12.6
 Balanced Delta-Wye Connection
A balanced ∆-Y system consists of a balanced ∆-connected source 
feeding a balanced Y-connected load.
Consider the ∆-Y circuit in Fig. 12.18. Again, assuming the abc 
sequence, the phase voltages of a delta-connected source are
Vab = Vp⧸ 0°,  
Vbc = Vp⧸ −120°
 
Vca = Vp⧸ +120° 
(12.34)
These are also the line voltages as well as the phase voltages.
We can obtain the line currents in man y ways. One way is to apply 
KVL to loop aANBba in Fig. 12.18, writing
−Vab + ZYIa − ZYIb = 0
or
ZY(Ia − Ib) = Vab = Vp⧸ 0°
Thus,
 
Ia − Ib =  Vp⧸ 0° 
_____ 
ZY
  
(12.35)

But Ib lags Ia by 120°, since we assumed the 
abc sequence; that is,  
Ib = Ia⧸ −120°. Hence,
 
Ia − Ib = Ia(1 − 1⧸ −120°)

Ia =  Vp∕ √

(12.37)
From this, we obtain the other line currents Ib and Ic using the positive 
phase sequence, i.e., Ib = Ia⧸ −120°, Ic = Ia⧸ +120°. The phase currents 
are equal to the line currents.
Another w ay to obtain the line currents is to replace the delta-
 
connected source with its equi valent wye-connected source, as sho wn 
in Fig. 12.19. In Section 12.3, we found that the line-to-line voltages of 
a wye-connected source lead their corresponding phase voltages by 30°. 
Therefore, we obtain each phase voltage of the equivalent wye-connected 
source by dividing the corresponding line voltage of the delta-connected 
source by  √ 
__
 
3  and shifting its phase by −30°. Thus, the equivalent wye-
connected source has the phase voltages

If the delta-connected source has source impedance 
Zs per phase, the 
equivalent wye-connected source will have a source impedance of Zs∕3 
per phase, according to Eq. (9.69).
Once the source is transformed to wye, the circuit becomes a wye-
wye system. Therefore, we can use the equi valent single-phase circuit 
shown in Fig. 12.20, from which the line current for phase a is
 
Ia =  Vp∕ √

As stated earlier , the delta-connected load is more desirable than 
the wye-connected load. It is easier to alter the loads in any one phase of 
the delta-connected loads, as the individual loads are connected directly 
across the lines. Ho wever, the delta-connected source is hardly used in 
practice because any slight imbalance in the phase voltages will result in 
unwanted circulating currents.

 Power in a Balanced System
Let us now consider the power in a balanced three-phase system. We

they are derived. The formulas can always be obtained by directly apply-

where Ip is the rms value of the phase current. The total instantaneous 
power in the load is the sum of the instantaneous powers in the three 
phases; that is,
 
p = pa + pb + pc = vANia + vBNib + vCNic
 
= 2Vp Ip[cos ωt cos(ωt − θ)
 
+ cos(ωt − 120°) cos(ωt − θ − 120°)
 
+ cos(ωt + 120°) cos(ωt − θ + 120°)] 
(12.43)
Applying the trigonometric identity
 
cos A cos B =  1 
__ 2  [cos(A + B) + cos(A − B)] 
(12.44)
gives
 
p = Vp Ip[3 cos θ + cos(2ωt − θ) + cos(2ωt − θ − 240°)
 
+ cos(2ωt − θ + 240°)]
 
= Vp Ip[3 cos θ + cos α + cos α cos 240° + sin α sin 240°
 
+ cos α cos 240° − sin α sin 240°] 
(12.45)
 
where α = 2ωt − θ
 
= Vp Ip [ 3 cos θ + cos α + 2 ( − 1 
__ 2  ) cos α ] = 3Vp Ip cos θ
Thus the total instantaneous power in a balanced three-phase system is 
constant—it does not change with time as the instantaneous power of 
each phase does. This result is true whether the load is Y- or 
∆- connected. 
This is one important reason for using a three-phase system to generate 
and distribute power. We will look into another reason a little later.
Since the total instantaneous po
wer is independent of time, the 
average po wer per phase Pp for either the ∆-connected load or the  
Y-connected load is p∕3, or
 
Pp = Vp Ip cos θ 
(12.46)
and the reactive power per phase is
 
Qp = Vp Ip sin θ 
(12.47)
The apparent power per phase is
 
Sp = Vp Ip 
(12.48)
The complex power per phase is
 
Sp = Pp + jQp = Vp I* 
p 
(12.49)
where Vp and Ip are the phase voltage and phase current with magnitudes 
Vp and Ip, respectively. The total average power is the sum of the average 
powers in the phases:
 
P = Pa + Pb + Pc = 3Pp = 3Vp Ip cos θ =  √

Remember that Vp, Ip, VL, and IL are all rms values and that θ is the angle

A second major adv antage of three-phase systems for po wer dis-
tribution is that the three-phase system uses a lesser amount of wire
 
than the single-phase system for the same line voltage VL and the same 
absorbed power PL. We will compare these cases and assume in both 
that the wires are of the same material (e.g., copper with resisti
vity 
ρ), of the same length ℓ, and that the loads are resisti
ve (i.e., unity 
power factor). For the two-wire single-phase system in Fig. 12.21(a),

Refer to the circuit in Fig. 12.13 (in Example 12.2). Determine the total 
average power, reactive power, and complex power at the source and at 
the load.
Solution:
It is sufficient to consider one phase, as the system is balanced. For 
phase a,
Vp = 110⧸ 0° V  
and  
Ip = 6.81⧸ −21.8° A
Thus, at the source, the complex power absorbed is
Ss = −3VpI*p = −3(110⧸ 0°)(6.81⧸ 21.8°)
= −2247⧸ 21.8° = −(2087 + j834.6) VA
The real or average power absorbed is −2087 W and the reactive power 
is −834.6 VAR.
At the load, the complex power absorbed is
SL = 3|Ip|
2Zp
where Zp = 10 + j8 = 12.81⧸ 38.66° and Ip = Ia = 6.81⧸ −21.8°. Hence,
SL = 3(6.81)212.81⧸ 38.66° = 1782⧸ 38.66
= (1392 + j1113) VA
The real power absorbed is 1391.7 W and the reactive power absorbed 
is 1113.3 VAR. The difference between the two complex powers is ab -
sorbed by the line impedance (5 − j2) Ω. To show that this is the case, 
we find the complex power absorbed by the line as
Sℓ = 3|Ip|
2Zℓ = 3(6.81)2(5 − j2) = 695.6 − j278.3 VA
which is the difference between Ss and SL; that is, Ss + Sℓ + SL = 0, as 
expected.

6935.13  = 0.8075
Example 12.7
Calculate the line current required for a 30-kW three-phase motor having 
a power factor of 0.85 lagging if it is connected to a balanced source with 
a line voltage of 550 V.
Answer: 37.05 A.
Practice Problem 12.7
Two balanced loads are connected to a 240-kV rms 60-Hz line, as 
shown in Fig. 12.22(a). Load 1 dra ws 30 kW at a po wer factor of 0.6 
lagging, while load 2 draws 45 kVAR at a power factor of 0.8 lagging. 
Assuming the abc sequence, determine: (a) the complex, real, and reac-
tive powers absorbed by the combined load, (b) the line currents, and 
(c) the kVAR rating of the three capacitors ∆-connected in parallel with 
the load that will raise the power factor to 0.9 lagging and the capaci-
tance of each capacitor.
Solution:
(a) For load 1, given that P1 = 30 kW and cos θ1 = 0.6, then sin θ1 = 0.8. 
Hence,
S1 =  P1 
_____ 
cos θ1
  =  30 kW 
______ 
0.6  = 50 kVA
and Q1 = S1 sin θ1 = 50(0.8) = 40 kVAR. Thus, the complex power due 
to load 1 is
 
S1 = P1 + jQ1 = 30 + j40 kVA 
(12.8.1)
Example 12.8

For load 2, if Q2 = 45 kVAR and cos θ2 = 0.8, then sin θ2 = 0.6. We find
S2 =  Q2 
_____ 
sin θ2
  =  45 kVA 
_______ 
0.6  = 75 kVA
and P2 = S2 cos θ2 75(0.8) = 60 kW. Therefore the complex power due 
to load 2 is
 
S2 = P2 + jQ2 = 60 + j45 kVA 
(12.8.2)
From Eqs. (12.8.1) and (12.8.2), the total complex power absorbed by 
the load is
 
S = S1 + S2 = 90 + j85 kVA = 123.8⧸ 43.36° kVA (12.8.3)
which has a power factor of cos 43.36° = 0.727 lagging. The real power 
is then 90 kW, while the reactive power is 85 kVAR.
It will help with the calculations to assume that the loads are wye 
connected and then to work with the phase voltages, i.e. the magnitude 
of VAN =  ( 240∕ √

3  ) kV.
(b)  Since S = 3 ( (240 kV∕ √

the magnitude of the line current is

(12.8.4)
We apply this to each load keeping in mind that the magnitude of the

3  ) kV. For load 1,
IL1 =  50,000 
__________ 
 √ 
__
 
3  240,000
  = 120.28 mA
Since the power factor is lagging, the line current lags the line voltage by 
θ1 = cos−1 0.6 = 53.13°. Thus,
Ia1 = 120.28⧸ −53.13°
For load 2,
IL2 =  75,000 
__________ 
 √ 
__
 
3  240,000
  = 180.42 mA
and the line current lags the line voltage by θ2 = cos−1 0.8 = 36.87°. Hence,
Ia2 = 180.42⧸ −36.87°
The total line current is
 
Ia = Ia1 + Ia2 = 120.28⧸ −53.13° + 180.42⧸ −36.87°
 
= (72.168 − j96.224) + (144.336 − j108.252)
 
= 216.5 − j204.472 = 297.8⧸ −43.36° mA
Alternatively, we could obtain the current from the total complex 
power using Eq. (12.8.4) as
IL =  123,800 
__________ 
 √ 
__
 
3  240,000
  = 297.82 mA
and
Ia = 297.82⧸ −43.36° mA
which is the same as before. The other line currents, Ib2 and Ica, can be 
obtained according to the abc sequence (i.e., Ib = 297.82⧸ −163.36° mA 
and Ic = 297.82⧸ 76.64° mA).
(c) We can find the reactive power needed to bring the power factor to 
0.9 lagging using Eq. (11.59),
QC = P(tan θold − tan θnew)

 Unbalanced Three-Phase Systems
This chapter would be incomplete without mentioning unbalanced three-
phase systems. An unbalanced system is caused by two possible situa -
tions: (1) The source voltages are not equal in magnitude and/or differ 
in phase by angles that are unequal, or (2) load impedances are unequal. 
Thus,
An unbalanced system is due to unbalanced voltage sources or an 
unbalanced load.
A special technique for handling 
unbalanced three-phase systems is the 
method of symmetrical components, 
which is beyond the scope of this text.
To simplify analysis, we will assume balanced source voltages, but an 
unbalanced load.
Unbalanced three-phase systems are solved by direct application of 
mesh and nodal analysis. Figure 12.23 sho ws an example of an unbal -
anced three-phase system that consists of balanced source v oltages (not 
shown in the figure) and an unbalanced Y-connected load (shown in the 
figure). Since the load is unbalanced, ZA, ZB, and ZC are not equal. The 
line currents are determined by Ohm’s law as

Unbalanced three-phase Y-connected load.

This set of unbalanced line currents produces current in the neutral line, 
which is not zero as in a balanced system. Applying KCL at node N gives 
the neutral line current as
In = −(Ia + Ib + Ic) 
(12.60)
In a three-wire system where the neutral line is absent, we can still 
find the line currents Ia, Ib, and Ic using mesh analysis. At node N, KCL 
must be satisfied so that Ia + Ib + Ic = 0 in this case. The same could be 
done for an unbalanced ∆-Y, Y-∆, or ∆-∆ three-wire system. As men-
tioned earlier, in long distance po wer transmission, conductors in mul -
tiples of three (multiple three-wire systems) are used, with the earth itself 
acting as the neutral conductor.
To calculate po wer in an unbalanced three-phase system requires 
that we find the power in each phase using Eqs. (12.46) to (12.49). The 
total power is not simply three times the power in one phase but the sum 
of the powers in the three phases.

(c) We check the result above by finding the power absorbed by the 
source. For the voltage source in phase a,

 PSpice for Three-Phase Circuits
PSpice can be used to analyze three-phase balanced or unbalanced cir -
cuits in the same way it is used to analyze single-phase ac circuits. How-
ever, a delta-connected source presents two major problems to PSpice. 
First, a delta-connected source is a loop of voltage sources—which 
PSpice does not like. To avoid this problem, we insert a resistor of neg -
ligible resistance (say, 1 μΩ per phase) into each phase of the delta-
connected source. Second, the delta-connected source does not provide a 
convenient node for the ground node, which is necessary to run PSpice. 
This problem can be eliminated by inserting balanced wye-connected 
large resistors (say, 1 MΩ per phase) in the delta-connected source so 
that the neutral node of the wye-connected resistors serves as the ground 
node 0. Example 12.12 will illustrate this.

the source frequency is 60 Hz.

Solution:
The schematic is shown in Fig. 12.28. The pseudocomponents IPRINT 
are inserted in the appropriate lines to obtain IaA and IAC, while VPRINT2 
is inserted between nodes A and B to print differential voltage 
VAB. 
We set the attributes of IPRINT and VPRINT2 each to 
AC = yes, 
MAG = yes, PHASE = yes, to print only the magnitude and phase of  
the  currents and voltages. As a single-frequency analysis, we select 
Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep and enter Total Pts = 1, Start Freq = 60, 
and Final Freq = 60. Once the circuit is saved, it is simulated by select-
ing Analysis/Simulate. The output file includes the following:

Consider the unbalanced ∆-∆ circuit in Fig. 12.30. Use 
PSpice t o  
find the generator current Iab, the line current 
IbB, and the phase  
 current IBC.
Example 12.12

Solution:
1. Define. The problem and solution process are clearly defined.
2. Present. We are to find the generator current flowing from a to b, 
the line current flowing from b to B, and the phase current flowing 
from B to C.
3. Alternative. Although there are different approaches to solving 
this problem, the use of PSpice is mandated. Therefore, we will not 
use another approach.
4. Attempt. As mentioned above, we avoid the loop of voltage 
sources by inserting a 1-μΩ series resistor in the delta-connected 
source. To provide a ground node 0, we insert balanced wye-
connected resistors (1 MΩ per phase) in the delta-connected 
source, as shown in the schematic in Fig. 12.31. Three IPRINT 
pseudocomponents with their attributes are inserted to be able

IBC = 5.5⧸ 172.5° A
5. Evaluate. We can check our results by using mesh analysis. 
Let the loop aABb be loop 1, the loop bBCc be loop 2, and the 
loop ACB be loop 3, with the three loop currents all flowing in 
the clockwise direction. We then end up with the following loop 
equations:
Loop 1

Loop 2
 
−(2 + j5)I1 + (4 + j40)I2 − (j30)I3 = 208⧸ −110°
 
= −71.14 − j195.46
Loop 3
−(50)I1 − (j30)I2 + (50 − j10)I3 = 0

Now to solve for Iab. If we assume a small internal impedance for

For the unbalanced circuit in Fig. 12.32, use PSpice to find the generator 
current Ica, the line current IcC, and the phase current IAB.

__
 
3
greater than the delta connection; hence, for the same power, the line 
current is  √ 
__
 
3  smaller. In addition, delta connected are also undesirable 
due to the potential of having disastrous circulating currents. Sometimes, 
using transformers, we create the equivalent of delta connect source. 
This conversion from three-phase to single-phase is required in residen-
tial wiring, because household lighting and appliances use single-phase 
power. Three-phase power is used in industrial wiring where a large 
power is required. In some applications, it is immaterial whether the load 
is wye- or delta-connected. For example, both connections are satisfac -
tory with induction motors. In fact, some manufacturers connect a motor 
in delta for 220 V and in wye for 440 V so that one line of motors can be 
readily adapted to two different voltages.
Here we consider two practical applications of those concepts co v-
ered in this chapter: power measurement in three-phase circuits and 
 residential wiring.
12.10.1  Three-Phase Power Measurement
Section 11.9 presented the wattmeter as the instrument for measuring 
the average (or real) power in single-phase circuits. A single wattmeter  
can also measure the average power in a three-phase system that is bal -
anced, so that P1 = P2 = P3; the total power is three times the reading 
of that one wattmeter. However, two or three single-phase wattmeters  
are necessary to measure power if the system is unbalanced. The three-
wattmeter method  of power measurement, shown in Fig. 12.33, will 
work regardless of whether the load is balanced or unbalanced, wye- or 
delta-connected. The three-wattmeter method is well suited for power 
measurement in a three-phase system where the power factor is con
-
stantly changing. The total average power is the algebraic sum of the
 
three wattmeter readings,
 
PT = P1 + P2 + P3 
(12.61)
where P1, P2, and P3 correspond to the readings of wattmeters W1, W2, 
and W3, respectively. Notice that the common or reference point o in  
Fig. 12.33 is selected arbitrarily. If the load is wye-connected, point o 
can be connected to the neutral point 
n. For a delta-connected load, 
point o can be connected to any point. If point o is connected to point 
b, for example, the voltage coil in wattmeter W2 reads zero and P2 = 0, 
indicating that wattmeter W2 is not necessary. Thus, two wattmeters are 
sufficient to measure the total power.
The two-wattmeter method is the most commonly used method for 
three-phase power measurement. The two wattmeters must be properly 
connected to an y two phases, as sho wn typically in Fig. 12.34. Notice 
that the current coil of each w attmeter measures the line current, while 
the respective voltage coil is connected between the line and the third 
line and measures the line v oltage. Also notice that the ± terminal of 
the voltage coil is connected to the line to which the corresponding cur-
rent coil is connected. Although the individual wattmeters no longer 
read the power taken by any particular phase, the algebraic sum of the 
two wattmeter readings equals the total a verage power absorbed by the 
load, regardless of whether it is wye- or delta-connected, balanced or

unbalanced. The total real power is equal to the algebraic sum of the two 
wattmeter readings,
PT = P1 + P2 
(12.62)
We will show here that the method works for a balanced three-phase 
system.
Consider the balanced, wye-connected load in Fig. 12.35. Our ob-
jective is to apply the two-wattmeter method to find the average power 
absorbed by the load. Assume the source is in the abc sequence and 
the load impedance ZY = ZY⧸ θ. Due to the load impedance, each volt-
age coil leads its current coil by θ, so that the po wer factor is cos θ. 
We recall that each line voltage leads the corresponding phase voltage 
by 30°. Thus, the total phase dif ference between the phase current   
Ia and line v oltage Vab is θ + 30°, and the a verage power read by 
wattmeter W1 is
 
P1 = Re[VabI*a] = VabIa cos(θ + 30°) = VLIL cos(θ + 30°)   (12.63)

Similarly, we can show that the average power read by wattmeter 2 is
 
P2 = Re[VcbI*c] = VcbIc cos(θ − 30°) = VLIL cos(θ − 30°)   (12.64)
We now use the trigonometric identities
 
cos(A + B) = cos A cos B − sin A sin B
 
cos(A − B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B 
(12.65)
to find the sum and the difference of the two wattmeter readings in  
Eqs. (12.63) and (12.64):
 
P1 + P2 = VLIL[cos(θ + 30°) + cos(θ − 30°)]
 
= VLIL(cos θ cos 30° − sin θ sin 30°
 
+ cos θ cos 30° + sin θ sin 30°)
 
= VLIL2 cos 30° cos θ =  √ 
__
 
3  VLIL cos θ 
(12.66)
since 2 cos 30° =   √

3  . Comparing Eq. (12.66) with Eq. (12.50) shows that 
the sum of the wattmeter readings gives the total average power,
 
PT = P1 + P2 
(12.67)

Similarly,
P1 − P2 = VLIL[cos(θ + 30°) − cos(θ − 30°)]
 
= VlIL(cos θ cos 30° − sin θ sin 30°
 
−cos θ cos 30° − sinθ sin 30°) 
(12.68)
 
= −VLIL2 sin 30° sin θ
 
P2 − P1 = VLIL sin θ
since 2 sin 30° = 1. Comparing Eq. (12.68) with Eq. (12.51) shows that 
the difference of the wattmeter readings is proportional to the total reac-
tive power, or
 
QT =  √

(12.71)
from which we can obtain the power factor as pf
 = cos θ. Thus, the 
two-wattmeter method not only provides the total real and reactive pow-
ers, it can also be used to compute the power factor. From Eqs. (12.67), 
(12.69), and (12.71), we conclude that:
1. If P2 = P1, the load is resistive.
2. If P2 > P1, the load is inductive.
3. If P2 < P1, the load is capacitive.
Although these results are derived from a balanced wye-connected load, 
they are equally valid for a balanced delta-connected load. However, 
the two-wattmeter method cannot be used for power measurement in a 
three-phase four-wire system unless the current through the neutral line 
is zero. We use the three-wattmeter method to measure the real power in 
a three-phase four-wire system.
Three wattmeters W1, W2, and W3 are connected, respectively, to  phases 
a, b, and c to measure the total power absorbed by the unbalanced 
 wye-connected load in Example 12.9 (see Fig. 12.23). (a) Predict the 
wattmeter readings. (b) Find the total power absorbed.
Solution:
Part of the problem is already solved in Example 12.9. Assume that the 
wattmeters are properly connected as in Fig. 12.36.
Example 12.13

(a) From Example 12.9,
VAN = 100⧸ 0°,  
VBN = 100⧸ 120°,  
VCN = 100⧸ −120° V
while
Ia = 6.67⧸ 0°,  
Ib = 8.94⧸ 93.44°,  
Ic = 10⧸ −66.87° A
We calculate the wattmeter readings as follows:
 
P1 = Re(VANI*a) = VANIa cos(θVAN − θIa)
 
= 100 × 6.67 × cos(0° − 0°) = 667 W
 
P2 = Re(VBNI*b) = VBNIb cos(θVBN − θIb)
 
= 100 × 8.94 × cos(120° − 93.44°) = 800 W
 
P3 = Re(VCNI*c) = VCNIc cos(θVCN − θIc)
 
= 100 × 10 × cos(−120° + 66.87°) = 600 W
(b) The total power absorbed is
PT = P1 + P2 + P3 = 667 + 800 + 600 = 2067 W
We can find the power absorbed by the resistors in Fig. 12.36 and use 
that to check or confirm this result
 
PT = |Ia|
2(15) + |Ib|
2(10) + |Ic|
2(6)
 
= 6.672(15) + 8.942(10) + 102(6)
 
= 667 + 800 + 600 = 2067 W
which is exactly the same thing.

Repeat Example 12.13 for the network in Fig. 12.24 (see Practice 
Prob. 12.9). Hint: Connect the reference point o in Fig. 12.33 to point B.
Answer: (a) 13.175 kW, 0 W, 29.91 kW, (b) 43.08 kW.
The two-wattmeter method produces w attmeter readings P1 = 1560 W 
and P2 = 2100 W when connected to a delta-connected load. If the line 
voltage is 220 V, calculate: (a) the per-phase average power, (b) the per-
phase reactive power, (c) the power factor, and (d) the phase impedance.
Example 12.14

Solution:
We can apply the given results to the delta-connected load.
(a) The total real or average power is
PT = P1 + P2 = 1560 + 2100 = 3660 W
The per-phase average power is then
Pp =  1 
__ 3  PT = 1220 W
(b) The total reactive power is
QT =  √ 
__
 
3  (P2 − P1) =  √

3  (2100 − 1560) = 935.3 VAR
so that the per-phase reactive power is

(c) The power angle is
θ = tan−1  QT

PT
  = tan−1  935.3 
_____ 
3660  = 14.33°
Hence, the power factor is
cos θ = 0.9689(lagging)
It is a lagging pf because QT is positive or P2 > P1.
(d) The phase impedance is Zp = Zp⧸ θ. We know that θ is the same as the 
pf angle; that is, θ = 14.33°.

Three-Phase Circuits
The three-phase balanced load in Fig. 12.35 has impedance per phase of 
ZY = 8 + j6 Ω. If the load is connected to 208-V lines, predict the read -
ings of the wattmeters W1 and W2. Find PT and QT.
Solution:
The impedance per phase is
ZY = 8 + j6 = 10⧸ 36.87° Ω
so that the pf angle is 36.87°. Since the line voltage VL = 208 V, the line 
current is
IL =  Vp

| ZY |
  =  208∕ √

_______ 
10

Then
P1 = VLIL cos(θ + 30°) = 208 × 12 × cos(36.87° + 30°)
= 980.48 W
P2 = VLIL cos(θ − 30°) = 208 × 12 × cos(36.87° − 30°)
= 2478.1 W
Thus, wattmeter 1 reads 980.48 W, while wattmeter 2 reads 2478.1 W. 
Since P2 > P1, the load is inductive. This is evident from the load 
ZY 
itself. Next,

Practice Problem 12.15
12.10.2  Residential Wiring
In the United States, most household lighting and appliances operate on 
120-V, 60-Hz, single-phase alternating current. (The electricity may also 
be supplied at 110, 115, or 117 V, depending on the location.) The local 
power company supplies the house with a three-wire ac system. 
Typi-
cally, as in Fig. 12.37, the line voltage of, say, 12,000 V is stepped down 
to 120/240 V with a transformer (more details on transformers in the next 
chapter). The three wires coming from the transformer are typically col-
ored red (hot), black (hot), and white (neutral). As shown in Fig. 12.38, 
the two 120-V voltages are opposite in phase and hence add up to zero. 
That is, VW = 0⧸ 0° ,VB = 120⧸ 0° ,VR = 120⧸ 180° = −VB.
 
VBR = VB − VR = VB −(−VB) = 2VB = 240⧸ 0°  
(12.72)

Since most appliances are designed to operate with 120 
V, the light -
ing and appliances are connected to the 120-V lines, as illustrated in 
Fig. 12.39 for a room. Notice in Fig. 12.37 that all appliances are con-
nected in parallel. Hea vy appliances that consume lar ge currents, such 
as air conditioners, dishwashers, ovens, and laundry machines, are con-
nected to the 240-V power line.
Because of the dangers of electricity , house wiring is carefully 
reg ulated by a code dra wn by local ordinances and by the National
 
Electrical Code (NEC). To avoid trouble, insulation, grounding, fuses, 
and circuit breakers are used. Modern wiring codes require a third wire 
for a separate ground. The ground wire does not carry po wer like the 
neutral wire but enables appliances to have a separate ground connec-
tion. Figure 12.40 shows the connection of the receptacle to a 120-V 
rms line and to the ground. As shown in the figure, the neutral line 
is connected to the ground (the earth) at man y critical locations. Al-
though the ground line seems redundant, grounding is important for 
many  reasons. First, it is required by NEC. Second, grounding provides

a convenient path to ground for lightning that strik es the power line. 
Third, grounds minimize the risk of electric shock. What causes shock 
is the passage of current from one part of the body to another
. The 
human body is lik e a big resistor R. If V is the potential dif ference 
between the body  and  the ground, the current through the body is
 
 determined by Ohm’s law as
 
I =  V 
__ 
R  
(12.73)
The value of R varies from person to person and depends on whether  
the body is wet or dry. How great or how deadly the shock is depends 
on the amount of current, the pathway of the current through the body, 
and the length of time the body is e
xposed to the current. Currents  
less than 1 mA may not be harmful to the body
, but currents greater  
than 10  mA can cause se vere shock. A modern safety de vice is the  
ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), used in outdoor circuits and in 
bathrooms, where the risk of electric shock is greatest. It is essentially 
a circuit break er that opens when the sum of the currents 
iR, iW, and  
iB through the red, white, and the black lines is not equal to zero, or
 
iR + iW + iB ≠  0.
The best w ay to a void electric shock is to follo w safety guide -
lines concerning electrical systems and appliances. Here are some of 
them:
• Never assume that an electrical circuit is dead. 
Always check to 
be sure.
• Use safety de vices when necessary , and wear suitable clothing 
 (insulated shoes, gloves, etc.).
• Never use tw o hands when testing high-v oltage circuits, since the 
current through one hand to the other hand has a direct path through 
your chest and heart.
• Do not touch an electrical appliance when you are wet. Remember 
that water conducts electricity.
• Be extremely careful when working with electronic appliances such 
as radio and TV because these appliances ha ve lar ge capacitors 
in them. The capacitors tak e time to dischar ge after the po wer is 
 disconnected.
• Always ha ve another person present when w
orking on a wiring 
 system, just in case of an accident.

 Summary
1. The phase sequence is the order in which the phase v
oltages of a 
three-phase generator occur with respect to time. In an abc sequence 
of balanced source v oltages, Van leads Vbn by 120°, which in turn 
leads Vcn by 120°. In an acb sequence of balanced v oltages, Van
leads Vcn by 120°, which in turn leads Vbn by 120°.
2. A balanced wye- or delta-connected load is one in which the three-
phase impedances are equal.
3. The easiest way to analyze a balanced three-phase circuit is to trans-
form both the source and the load to a Y-Y system and then analyze 
the single-phase equivalent circuit. Table 12.1 presents a summary 
of the formulas for phase currents and voltages and line currents and 
voltages for the four possible configurations.
4. The line current IL is the current flowing from the generator to the 
load in each transmission line in a three-phase 
system. The line 
voltage VL is the v oltage between each pair of lines, e xcluding the 
neutral line if it e xists. The phase current Ip is the current flowing 
through each phase in a three-phase load. The phase voltage Vp is the 
voltage of each phase. For a wye-connected load,
VL =  √ 
__
 
3  Vp  
and  
IL = Ip
  
For a delta-connected load,
VL = Vp  
and  
IL =  √ 
__
 
3  Ip
5. The total instantaneous po wer in a balanced three-phase system is 
constant and equal to the average power.
6. The total comple x po wer absorbed by a balanced three-phase 
Y-connected or ∆-connected load is
S = P + jQ =  √ 
__
 
3  VLIL⧸ θ
  
where θ is the angle of the load impedances.
7. An unbalanced three-phase system can be analyzed using nodal or 
mesh analysis.
8. PSpice is used to analyze three-phase circuits in the same w ay as it 
is used for analyzing single-phase circuits.
9. The total real power is measured in three-phase systems using either 
the three-wattmeter method or the two-wattmeter method.
10. Residential wiring uses a 120/240-V, single-phase, three-wire system.

The principles of EM are applied in various allied disciplines, such as 
electric machines, electromechanical ener gy conversion, radar meteorolo-
gy, remote sensing, satellite communications, bioelectromagnetics, electro-
magnetic interference and compatibility, plasmas, and fiber optics. EM de-
vices include electric motors and generators, transformers, electromagnets, 
magnetic levitation, antennas, radars, microwave ovens, microwave dishes, 
superconductors, and electrocardiograms. The design of these de vices re-
quires a thorough knowledge of the laws and principles of EM.
EM is regarded as one of the more dif ficult disciplines in electrical 
engineering. One reason is that EM phenomena are rather abstract. But 
if one enjoys working with mathematics and can visualize the invisible, 
one should consider being a specialist in EM, inasmuch as few electrical 
engineers specialize in this area. Electrical engineers who specialize in 
EM are needed in micro wave industries, radio/TV broadcasting stations, 
electromagnetic research laboratories, and se
veral communications 
industries.

Magnetically Coupled Circuits
13.1
 Introduction
The circuits we have considered so far may be regarded as conductively 
coupled, because one loop affects the neighboring loop through current 
conduction. When tw o loops with or without contacts between them 
affect each other through the magnetic field generated by one of them, 
they are said to be magnetically coupled.
The transformer is an electrical de
vice designed on the basis of 
the concept of magnetic coupling. It uses magnetically coupled coils to 
transfer energy from one circuit to another. Transformers are key circuit 
elements. They are used in power systems for stepping up or stepping 
down ac voltages or currents. They are used in electronic circuits such as 
radio and television receivers for such purposes as impedance matching, 
isolating one part of a circuit from another, and again for stepping up or 
down ac voltages and currents.
We will begin with the concept of mutual inductance and introduce 
the dot convention used for determining the voltage polarities of induc-
tively coupled components. Based on the notion of mutual inductance, 
James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879), a graduate in mathematics from 
Cambridge University, in 1865 wrote a most remarkable paper in which 
he mathematically unified the laws of Faraday and Ampere. This relation-
ship between the electric field and magnetic field served as the basis for 
what was later called electromagnetic fields and waves, a major field of 
study in electrical engineering. The Institute of Electrical and Electron -
ics Engineers (IEEE) uses a graphical representation of this principle in 
its logo, in which a straight arrow represents current and a curved arrow  
represents the electromagnetic field. This relationship is commonly 
known as the right-hand rule . Maxwell was a very active theoretician 
and scientist. He is best known for the “Maxwell equations.” The max -
well, a unit of magnetic flux, was named after him.

how to analyze circuits containing mutually coupled inductors.

former, and the three-phase transformer. Finally, among their important 
applications, we look at transformers as isolating and matching devices 
and their use in power distribution.
13.2
 Mutual Inductance
When two inductors (or coils) are in a close proximity to each other, 
the magnetic flux caused by current in one coil links with the other coil, 
thereby inducing v oltage in the latter . This phenomenon is kno wn as 
mutual inductance.
Let us first consider a single inductor, a coil with N turns. When 
current i flows through the coil, a magnetic flux ϕ is produced around it 
(Fig. 13.1). According to Faraday’s law, the voltage v induced in the coil 
is proportional to the number of turns N and the time rate of change of 
the magnetic flux ϕ; that is,
v = N  dϕ 
___ 
dt  
(13.1)
But the flux ϕ is produced by current i so that any change in ϕ is caused 
by a change in the current. Hence, Eq. (13.1) can be written as
 
v = N   dϕ 
___ 
di   di 
__ 
dt  
(13.2)
or
 
v = L  di 
__ 
dt  
(13.3)
which is the voltage-current relationship for the inductor. From Eqs. (13.2) 
and (13.3), the inductance L of the inductor is thus given by
 
L = N  dϕ 
___ 
di  
(13.4)
This inductance is commonly called self-inductance, because it relates 
the voltage induced in a coil by a time-varying current in the same coil.
Now consider two coils with self-inductances L1 and L2 that are in 
close proximity with each other (Fig. 13.2). Coil 1 has N1 turns, while 
coil 2 has N2 turns. F or the sak e of simplicity, assume that the second 
inductor carries no current. The magnetic flux ϕ1 emanating from coil 1 
has two components: One component ϕ11 links only coil 1, and another 
component ϕ12 links both coils. Hence,
 
ϕ1 = ϕ11 + ϕ12 
(13.5)
Although the tw o coils are ph ysically separated, the y are said to be 
magnetically coupled. Since the entire flux ϕ1 links coil 1, the v oltage  
induced in coil 1 is
 
v1 = N1  dϕ1 
____ 
dt  
(13.6)
Only flux ϕ12 links coil 2, so the voltage induced in coil 2 is
 
v2 = N2  dϕ12

(13.10)
M21 is known as the mutual inductance of coil 2 with respect to coil 1. 
Subscript 21 indicates that the inductance M21 relates the voltage induced 
in coil 2 to the current in coil 1. Thus, the open-circuit mutual voltage (or 
induced voltage) across coil 2 is
 
v2 = M21

___
 
dt  
(13.11)
Suppose we now let current i2 flow in coil 2, while coil 1 carries no 
current (Fig. 13.3). The magnetic flux ϕ2 emanating from coil 2 comprises  
flux ϕ22 that links only coil 2 and flux ϕ21 that links both coils. Hence,
 
ϕ2 = ϕ21 + ϕ22 
(13.12)
The entire flux ϕ2 links coil 2, so the voltage induced in coil 2 is
 
v2 = N2  dϕ2

where L2 = N2 dϕ2∕di2 is the self-inductance of coil 2. Since only flux 
ϕ21 links coil 1, the voltage induced in coil 1 is
 
v1 = N1  dϕ21 
____ 
dt  = N1  dϕ21

where

which is the mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to coil 2. Thus, the 
open-circuit mutual voltage across coil 1 is
 
v1 = M12   
di2
 
___
 
dt   
(13.16)
We will see in the next section that M12 and M21 are equal; that is,
 
M12 = M21 = M 
(13.17)
and we refer to M as the mutual inductance between the two coils. Like 
self-inductance L, mutual inductance M is measured in henrys (H). Keep 
in mind that mutual coupling only exists when the inductors or coils are 
in close proximity, and the circuits are dri ven by time- varying sources. 
We recall that inductors act like short circuits to dc.
From the two cases in Figs. 13.2 and 13.3, we conclude that mutual 
inductance results if a v oltage is induced by a time-v arying current in 
another circuit. It is the property of an inductor to produce a v oltage in 
reaction to a time-varying current in another inductor near it. Thus,

Mutual Inductance

Mutual inductance is the ability of one inductor to induce a voltage 
across a neighboring inductor, measured in henrys (H).
Although mutual inductance M is al ways a positi ve quantity, the 
mutual voltage M di∕dt may be negative or positive, just like the self-in-
duced voltage L di∕dt. However, unlike the self-induced L di∕dt, whose 
polarity is determined by the reference direction of the current and the 
reference polarity of the v oltage (according to the passi ve sign conven-
tion), the polarity of mutual v oltage M di∕dt is not easy to determine, 
because four terminals are involved. The choice of the correct polarity for 
M di∕dt is made by examining the orientation or particular way in which 
both coils are physically wound and applying Lenz’s law in conjunction 
with the right-hand rule. Since it is inconvenient to show the construction 
details of coils on a circuit schematic, we apply the dot convention in cir-
cuit analysis. By this convention, a dot is placed in the circuit at one end 
of each of the two magnetically coupled coils to indicate the direction of 
the magnetic flux if current enters that dotted terminal of the coil. This is 
illustrated in Fig. 13.4. Given a circuit, the dots are already placed beside 
the coils so that we need not bother about how to place them. The dots 
are used along with the dot con vention to determine the polarity of the 
mutual voltage. The dot convention is stated as follows:
If a current enters the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference  polarity 
of the mutual voltage in the second coil is positive at the dotted  terminal 
of the second coil.
Alternatively,
If a current leaves the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference polarity 
of the mutual voltage in the second coil is negative at the dotted terminal 
of the second coil.
Thus, the reference polarity of the mutual v oltage depends on the ref -
erence direction of the inducing current and the dots on the coupled 
coils. Application of the dot con vention is illustrated in the four pairs 
of mutually coupled coils in Fig. 13.5. Fo
r the coupled coils in 
Fig. 13.5(a), the sign of the mutual voltage v2 is determined by the refer-
ence polarity for v2 and the direction of i1. Since i1 enters the dotted termi-
nal of coil 1 and v2 is positive at the dotted terminal of coil 2, the mutual 
voltage is +M di1∕dt. For the coils in Fig. 13.5(b), the current i1 enters

Chapter 13
Magnetically Coupled Circuits
the dotted terminal of coil 1 and v2 is ne gative at the dotted terminal 
of coil 2. Hence, the mutual v oltage is −M di1∕dt. The same reasoning  
applies to the coils in Figs. 13.5(c) and 13.5(d).
Figure 13.6 shows the dot convention for coupled coils in series. For 
the coils in Fig. 13.6(a), the total inductance is
 
L = L1 + L2 + 2M  
(Series-aiding connection)
 
(13.18)
For the coils in Fig. 13.6(b),
 
L = L1 + L2 − 2M  
(Series-opposing connection)
 
(13.19)
Now that we know how to determine the polarity of the mutual voltage, 
we are prepared to analyze circuits involving mutual inductance. As the 
first example, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.7(a). Applying KVL to coil 
1 gives
 
v1 = i1R1 + L1  di1

dt  + M  di2 
___

For coil 2, KVL gives
 
v2 = i2R2 + L2  di2 
___ 
dt  + M  di1 
___ 
dt  
(13.20b)
We can write Eq. (13.20) in the frequency domain as
 
V1 = (R1 + jωL1)I1 + jωMI2 
(13.21a)
 
V2 = jωMI1 + (R2 + jωL2)I2 
(13.21b)
As a second e xample, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.7(b). We analyze 
this in the frequency domain. Applying KVL to coil 1, we get
 
V = (Z1 + jωL1)I1 − jωMI2 
(13.22a)
For coil 2, KVL yields
 
0 = −jωMI1 + (ZL + jωL2)I2 
(13.22b)
Equations (13.21) and (13.22) are solv ed in the usual manner to deter -
mine the currents.
One of the most important things in making sure one solv es prob-
lems accurately is to be able to check each step during the solution pro -
cess and to mak e sure assumptions can be v erified. Too often, solving 
mutually coupled circuits requires the problem solv er to track tw o or 
more steps made at once re garding the sign and v alues of the mutually 
induced voltages.

Experience has sho wn that if we break the problem into steps of 
solving for the value and the sign into separate steps, the decisions made 
are easier to track. We suggest that model  (Figure 13.8 (b)) be used 
when analyzing circuits containing a mutually c oupled circuit shown in  
Figure 13.8(a):
Notice that we have not included the signs in the model. The reason 
for that is that we first determine the value of the induced voltages and then 
we determine the appropriate signs. Clearly, I1 induces a voltage within the 
second coil represented by the value jωI1 and I2 induces a voltage of jωI2 
in the first coil. Once we have the values we next use both circuits to find 
the correct signs for the dependent sources as shown in Figure 13.8(c).
Since I1 enters L1 at the dotted end, it induces a voltage in L2 that 
tries to force a current out of the dotted end of L2 which means that the 
source must have a plus on top and a minus on the bottom as sho wn in 
Figure 13.8(c). I2 leaves the dotted end of L2 which means that it induces 
a voltage in L1 which tries to force a current into the dotted end of 
L1 
requiring a dependent source that has a plus on the bottom and a minus 
on top as shown in Figure 13.8(c). Now all we have to do is to analyze 
a circuit with two dependent sources. This process allows you to check 
each of your assumptions.
At this introductory level we are not concerned with the determination 
of the mutual inductances of the coils and their dot placements. Lik e R, L, 
and C, calculation of M would involve applying the theory of electromag-
netics to the actual ph ysical properties of the coils. In this te xt, we assume 
that the mutual inductance and the placement of the dots are the “gi vens’’ 
of the circuit problem, like the circuit components R, L, and C.

Determine the voltage Vo in the circuit of Fig. 13.10.
Answer: 12⧸ −45° V.
Calculate the mesh currents in the circuit of Fig. 13.11.
Example 13.2
Solution:
The key to analyzing a magnetically coupled circuit is knowing the polar-
ity of the mutual voltage. We need to apply the dot rule. In Fig. 13.11, 
suppose coil 1 is the one whose reactance is 6 Ω, and coil 2 is the one  
whose reactance is 8 Ω. To figure out the polarity of the mutual voltage 
in coil 1 due to current I2, we observe that I2 leaves the dotted terminal of 
coil 2. Since we are applying KVL in the clockwise direction, it implies  
that the mutual voltage is negative, that is, −j2I2.

Alternatively, it might be best to figure out the mutual voltage by 
redrawing the rele vant portion of the circuit, as sho
wn in Fig. 13.12, 
where it becomes clear that the mutual voltage is V1 = −2j I2.
Thus, for mesh 1 in Fig. 13.11, KVL gives
−100 + I1(4 − j3 + j6) − j6I2 − j2I2 = 0
or
 
100 = (4 + j3)I1 − j8I2 
(13.2.1)
Similarly, to figure out the mutual voltage in coil 2 due to current I1, con-
sider the relevant portion of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.12. Applying 
the dot convention gives the mutual voltage as V2 = −2jI1. Also, current 
I2 sees the two coupled coils in series in Fig. 13.11; since it leaves the 
dotted terminals in both coils, Eq. (13.18) applies. Therefore, for mesh 2 
in Fig. 13.11, KVL gives
0 = −2jI1 − j6I1 + ( j6 + j8 + j2 × 2 + 5)I2
or
 
0 = −j8I1 + (5 + j18)I2

We now want to determine the energy stored in magnetically coupled 
coils.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 13.14. We assume that currents i1 and i2
are zero initially, so that the ener gy stored in the coils is zero. If we let i1
increase from zero to I1 while maintaining i2 = 0, the power in coil 1 is

coil 2 is zero, since i1 does not change. The power in the coils is now

If we reverse the order by which the currents reach their final values, that 
is, if we first increase i2 from zero to I2 and later increase i1 from zero to 
I1, the total energy stored in the coils is

__ 2  L2  I 2

Because the total energy stored should be the same regardless of how we 
reach the final conditions, comparing Eqs. (13.28) and (13.29) leads us

The coupling coefficient k is a measure of the magnetic coupling  
between two coils; 0 ≤ k ≤ 1.
We expect k to depend on the closeness of the two coils, their   
core, their orientation, and their windings. Figure 13.15 sho ws loosely 
coupled windings and tightly coupled windings.

formers used in radio frequenc y circuits are loosely coupled, whereas

 Linear Transformers
Here we introduce the transformer as a ne
w circuit element. A trans-
former is a magnetic device that takes advantage of the phenomenon of 
mutual inductance.
Practice Problem 13.3

566 
Chapter 13
Magnetically Coupled Circuits
A transformer is generally a four-terminal device comprising two (or 
more) magnetically coupled coils.
As shown in Fig. 13.19, the coil that is directly connected to the voltage 
source is called the primary winding. The coil connected to the load is 
called the secondary winding. The resistances R1 and R2 are included to 
account for the losses (po wer dissipation) in the coils. The transform-
er is said to be linear if the coils are w ound on a magnetically linear  
material—a material for which the magnetic permeability is constant. 
Such materials include air, plastic, Bakelite, and wood. In fact, most ma-
terials are magnetically linear. Linear transformers are sometimes called 
air-core transformers, although not all of them are necessarily air -core. 
They are used in radio and TV sets. Figure 13.20 portrays different types 
of transformers.

A linear transformer may also be  
regarded as one whose flux is propor-
tional to the currents in its windings.

We would like to obtain the input impedance Zin as seen from the 
source, because Zin governs the behavior of the primary circuit. Apply-
ing KVL to the two meshes in Fig. 13.19 gives
 
V = (R1 + jωL1)I1 − jωMI2 
(13.40a)
 
0 = −jωMI1 + (R2 + jωL2 + ZL)I2 
(13.40b)
In Eq. (13.40b), we e
xpress I2 in terms of I1 and substitute it into 
Eq. (13.40a). We get the input impedance as
 
Zin =   V 
__ 
I1
  = R1 + jωL1 +

_____________  
R2 + jωL2 + ZL
  
(13.41)
Notice that the input impedance comprises tw o terms. The first term, 
(R1 + jωL1), is the primary impedance. The second term is due to the 
coupling between the primary and secondary windings. It is as though 
this impedance is reflected to the primary. Thus, it is kno wn as the  
reflected impedance ZR, and
 
ZR =   
ω2M2 
_____________  
R2 + jωL2 + ZL
 
 
(13.42)
It should be noted that the result in Eq. (13.41) or (13.42) is not affected 
by the location of the dots on the transformer, because the same result is 
produced when M is replaced by −M.
The little bit of experience gained in Sections 13.2 and 13.3 in ana-
lyzing magnetically coupled circuits is enough to con vince anyone that 
analyzing these circuits is not as easy as circuits in previous chapters. For 
this reason, it is sometimes convenient to replace a magnetically coupled 
circuit by an equi valent circuit with no magnetic coupling. We want to 
replace the linear transformer in Fig. 13.21 by an equi valent T or Π cir-
cuit, a circuit that would have no mutual inductance.
The v oltage-current relationships for the primary and secondary 
coils give the matrix equation

Solution:
Notice that the circuit in Fig. 13.27 is the same as that in Fig. 13.10 
except that the reference direction for current I2 has been reversed, just 
to make the reference directions for the currents for the magnetically 
coupled coils conform with those in Fig. 13.21.
We need to replace the magnetically coupled coils with the 
 
T-equivalent circuit. The relevant portion of the circuit in Fig. 13.27 is 
shown in Fig. 13.28(a). Comparing Fig. 13.28(a) with Fig. 13.21 sho ws 
that there are tw o differences. First, due to the current reference direc -
tions and voltage polarities, we need to replace M by −M to make Fig. 
13.28(a) conform with Fig. 13.21. Second, the circuit in Fig. 13.21 is in 
the time-domain, whereas the circuit in Fig. 13.28(a) is in the frequency-
domain. The difference is the factor jω; that is, L in Fig. 13.21 has been 
replaced with jωL and M with jωM. Since ω is not specified, we can as-
sume ω = 1 rad/s or any other value; it really does not matter. With these 
two differences in mind,
La = L1 − (−M) = 8 + 1 = 9 H
Lb = L2 − (−M) = 5 + 1 = 6 H,  
Lc = −M = −1 H
Thus, the T-equivalent circuit for the coupled coils is as shown in 
Fig. 13.28(b).
Inserting the T-equivalent circuit in Fig. 13.28(b) to replace the two 
coils in Fig. 13.27 gives the equivalent circuit in Fig. 13.29, which can be 
solved using nodal or mesh analysis. Applying mesh analysis, we obtain
 
j6 = I1(4 + j9 − j1) + I2( −j1) 
(13.6.1)
and
 
0 = I1(−j1) + I2(10 + j6 − j1)

Example 13.6
Practice Problem 13.5

Substituting Eq. (13.6.3) into Eq. (13.6.1) gives
j6 = (4 + j8)(5 − j10)I2 − jI2 = (100 −j)I2 ≃ 100I2
Since 100 is very large compared with 1, the imaginary part of (100 − j) 
can be ignored so that 100 − j ≃ 100. Hence,
I2 =   j6 
____ 
100  = j0.06 = 0.06⧸ 90° A
From Eq. (13.6.3),
I1 = (5 − j10)j0.06 = 0.6 + j0.3 A
and
Vo = −10I2 = −j0.6 = 0.6⧸ −90° V
This agrees with the answer to Practice Prob. 13.1. Of course, the direc-
tion of I2 in Fig. 13.10 is opposite to that in Fig. 13.27. This will not 
affect Vo, but the value of I2 in this example is the negative of that of I2
in Practice Prob. 13.1. The advantage of using the T-equivalent model 
for the magnetically coupled coils is that in Fig. 13.29 we do not need to 
bother with the dot on the coupled coils.

 Ideal Transformers
An ideal transformer is one with perfect coupling ( k =1). It consists of 
two (or more) coils with a lar ge number of turns w ound on a common 
core of high permeability. Because of this high permeability of the core, 
the flux links all the turns of both coils, thereby resulting in a perfect 
coupling.
To see ho w an ideal transformer is the limiting case of tw
o coupled 
inductors where the inductances approach infinity and the coupling is per-
fect, let us reexamine the circuit in Fig. 13.14. In the frequency domain,
V1 = jωL1I1 + jωMI2 
(13.49a)
 
V2 = jωMI1 + jωL2I2 
(13.49b)
Practice Problem 13.6

From Eq. (13.49a), I1 = (V1 − jωMI2)∕jωL1 (we could have also used this 
equation to develop the current ratios instead of using the conservation of 
power which we will do shortly). Substituting this in Eq. (13.49b) gives

An ideal transformer is a unity-coupled, lossless transformer in which 
the primary and secondary coils have infinite self-inductances.
Iron-core transformers are close approximations to ideal transformers. 
These are used in power systems and electronics.
Figure 13.30(a) shows a typical ideal transformer; the circuit sym -
bol is in Fig. 13.30(b). The vertical lines between the coils indicate an 
iron core as distinct from the air core used in linear transformers. 
The 
primary winding has N1 turns; the secondary winding has N2 turns.
When a sinusoidal v
oltage is applied to the primary winding 
as shown in Fig. 13.31, the same magnetic flux ϕ goes through both 
 windings. According to F araday’s law, the v oltage across the primary 
winding is
 
v1 = N1  dϕ 
___ 
dt  
(13.50a)
while that across the secondary winding is

For the reason of po wer conservation, the ener gy supplied to the pri -

no losses in an ideal transformer. This implies that

When n = 1, we generally call the transformer an isolation transformer. 
The reason will become ob vious in Section 13.9.1. If n > 1, we ha ve a 
step-up transformer, as the voltage is increased from primary to second-
ary (V2 > V1). On the other hand, if n < 1, the transformer is a step-down 
transformer, since the v oltage is decreased from primary to secondary 
(V2 < V1).
13.5
Ideal Transformers
573
A step-down transformer is one whose secondary voltage is less than 
its primary voltage.
A step-up transformer is one whose secondary voltage is greater than 
its primary voltage.
The ratings of transformers are usually specified as V1∕V2. A transformer 
with rating 2400∕120 V should have 2400 V on the primary and 120 in 
the secondary (i.e., a step-down transformer). Keep in mind that the volt-
age ratings are in rms.
Power companies often generate at some convenient voltage and use 
a step-up transformer to increase the v oltage so that the po wer can be 
transmitted at very high voltage and low current over transmission lines, 
resulting in significant cost savings. Near residential consumer premises, 
step-down transformers are used to bring the voltage down to 120 V. Sec-
tion 13.9.3 will elaborate on this.
It is important that we know how to get the proper polarity of the volt-
ages and the direction of the currents for the transformer in Fig. 13.31. 
If the polarity of V1 or V2 or the direction of I1 or I2 is changed, n in 
Eqs. (13.51) to (13.55) may need to be replaced by −n. The two simple 
rules to follow are:
1. If V1 and V2 are both positive or both negative at the dotted termi -
nals, use +n in Eq. (13.52). Otherwise, use −n.
2. If I1 and I2 both enter into or both lea ve the dotted terminals, use  
−n in Eq. (13.55). Otherwise, use +n.
The rules are demonstrated with the four circuits in Fig. 13.32.

Notice that an ideal transformer reflects 
an impedance as the square of the 
turns ratio.
Using Eqs. (13.52) and (13.55), we can always express V1 in terms 
of V2 and I1 in terms of I2, or vice versa:
 
V1 =   V2 
___ 
n

(13.58)
showing that the comple x power supplied to the primary is deli
vered 
to the secondary without loss. The transformer absorbs no po wer. Of 
course, we should e xpect this, since the ideal transformer is lossless. 
The input impedance as seen by the source in Fig. 13.31 is found from  
Eqs. (13.56) and (13.57) as
 
Zin =   V1

___

(13.60)
The input impedance is also called the reflected impedance, inasmuch 
as it appears as if the load impedance is reflected to the primary side. 
This ability of the transformer to transform a gi
ven impedance into  
another impedance provides us a means of impedance matching to en-
sure  maximum power transfer. The idea of impedance matching is v ery 
useful in practice and will be discussed more in Section 13.9.2.
In analyzing a circuit containing an ideal transformer , it is com -
mon practice to eliminate the transformer by reflecting impedances 
and sources from one side of the transformer to the other . In the cir -
cuit of Fig. 13.33, suppose we want to reflect the secondary side of 
the circuit to the primary side. 
We find the Thevenin equivalent of 
the   circuit to the right of the terminals 
a-b. We obtain VTh as the   
open-circuit voltage at terminals a-b, as shown in Fig. 13.34(a).

The general rule for eliminating the transformer and reflecting the second-
ary circuit to the primary side is: Divide the secondary impedance by n2, 
divide the secondary voltage by n, and multiply the secondary current 
by n.
We can also reflect the primary side of the circuit in Fig. 13.33 to the 
secondary side. Figure 13.36 shows the equivalent circuit.
The rule for eliminating the transformer and reflecting the primary 
circuit to the secondary side is: Multiply the primary impedance by  
n2, multiply the primary voltage by n, and divide the primary current 
by n.
According to Eq. (13.58), the po wer remains the same, whether calcu -
lated on the primary or the secondary side. But realize that this reflection 
approach only applies if there are no e xternal connections between the 
primary and secondary windings. When we have external connections be-
tween the primary and secondary windings, we simply use regular mesh 
and nodal analysis. Examples of circuits where there are external con-
nections between the primary and secondary windings are in Figs. 13.39 
and 13.40. Also note that if the locations of the dots in Fig. 13.33 are 
changed, we might have to replace n by −n in order to obey the dot rule, 
illustrated in Fig. 13.32.

 Ideal Autotransformers
Unlike the conventional two-winding transformer we have considered so 
far, an autotransformer has a single continuous winding with a connec-
tion point called a tap between the primary and secondary sides. The tap 
is often adjustable so as to provide the desired turns ratio for stepping up 
or stepping down the voltage. This way, a variable voltage is provided to 
the load connected to the autotransformer.
13.6
Ideal Autotransformers
579
An autotransformer is a transformer in which both the primary and the 
secondary are in a single winding.
Figure 13.41 sho ws a typical autotransformer
. As sho wn in 
Fig. 13.42, the autotransformer can operate in the step-down or step-up 
mode. The autotransformer is a type of po wer transformer. Its major 
advantage o ver the tw o-winding transformer is its ability to transfer 
larger apparent po wer. Example 13.10 will demonstrate this. Another 
advantage is that an autotransformer is smaller and lighter than an 
equivalent two-winding transformer. However, since both the primary 
and secondary windings are one winding, electrical isolation (no direct 
electrical connection) is lost. (We will see how the property of electri -
cal isolation in the conventional transformer is practically employed in 
Section 13.9.1.) The lack of electrical isolation between the primary 
and secondary windings is a major disadvantage of the autotransformer.
Some of the formulas we deri ved for ideal transformers apply to 
ideal autotransformers as well. F or the step-do wn autotransformer cir -
cuit of Fig. 13.42(a), Eq. (13.52) gives

A major dif ference between con ventional transformers and auto -

former are not only coupled magnetically but also coupled conductively. 
The autotransformer can be used in place of a con ventional transformer 
when electrical isolation is not required.

Solution:
Although the primary and secondary windings of the autotransformer
 
are together as a continuous winding, they are separated in Fig. 13.43(b)  
for clarity. We note that the current and voltage of each winding of the  
autotransformer in Fig. 13.43(b) are the same as those for the two-winding 
 
transformer in Fig. 13.43(a). This is the basis of comparing their power 
ratings.
For the two-winding transformer, the power rating is
S1 = 0.2(240) = 48 VA  
or  
S2 = 4(12) = 48 VA
For the autotransformer, the power rating is
S1 = 4.2(240) = 1,008 VA  
or  
S2 = 4(252) = 1,008 VA
which is 21 times the power rating of the two-winding transformer.

 Three-Phase Transformers
To meet the demand for three-phase po
wer transmission, transformer 
connections compatible with three-phase operations are needed. We can 
achieve the transformer connections in tw o ways: by connecting three 
single-phase transformers, thereby forming a so-called transformer 
bank, or by using a special three-phase transformer . For the same kVA 
rating, a three-phase transformer is always smaller and cheaper than 
three single-phase transformers. When single-phase transformers are 
used, one must ensure that the y have the same turns ratio n to achieve 
a balanced three-phase system. There are four standard w ays of con -
necting three single-phase transformers or a three-phase transformer for 
three-phase operations: Y-Y, Δ-Δ, Y-Δ, and Δ-Y.
For any of the four connections, the total apparent po
wer ST, real 
power PT, and reactive power QT are obtained as
 
ST =  √

3  VLIL 
(13.69a)

__
 
3  VLIL cos θ 
(13.69b)
 
QT = ST sin θ =  √
__
 
3  VLIL sin θ 
(13.69c)
where VL and IL are, respectively, equal to the line v oltage VLp and the 
line current ILp for the primary side, or the line v oltage VLs and the line 
current ILs for the secondary side. Notice From Eq. (13.69) that for each 
of the four connections, VLs ILs = VLp ILp, since power must be conserved 
in an ideal transformer.
For the Y-Y connection (Fig. 13.46), the line v oltage VLp at the pri-
mary side, the line v oltage VLs on the secondary side, the line current 
ILp on the primary side, and the line current 
ILs on the secondary side 
are related to the transformer per phase turns ratio n according to Eqs. 
(13.52) and (13.55) as

(c) Because the load is balanced, each transformer equally shares the

the kVA rating of each transformer is S = ST∕3 = 14 kVA. Alternatively, 
the transformer rating can be determined by the product of the phase 
 
current and phase voltage of the primary or secondary side. For the

voltage is the same as the line voltage of 240 V, while the phase current

 PSpice Analysis of Magnetically

PSpice analyzes magnetically coupled circuits just lik

matic, the dot (not sho wn) is al ways next to pin 1, which is the left-
hand terminal of the inductor when the inductor with part name L is
 
placed (horizontally) without rotation on a schematic. Thus, the dot or

attributes are set in henries, we use the coupling symbol K_LINEAR
 
to define the coupling. For each pair of coupled inductors, take the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Select Draw/Get New Part and type K_LINEAR.
2. Hit <enter> or click OK and place the K_LINEAR symbol on the 
schematic, as shown in Fig. 13.51. (Notice that K_LINEAR is not a 
component and therefore has no pins.)
3. DCLICKL on COUPLING and set the value of the coupling coef-
ficient k.
4. DCLICKL on the boxe d K (the coupling symbol) and enter the  
reference designator names for the coupled inductors as v
alues 
of Li, i = 1, 2, …, 6. For example, if inductors L20 and L23 are 
coupled, we set L1 = L20 and L2 = L23. L1 and at least one other 
Li must be assigned values; other Li’s may be left blank.
In step 4, up to six coupled inductors with equal coupling can be
 
 specified.
For the air -core transformer, the partname is XFRM_LINEAR. 
It can be inserted in a circuit by selecting 
Draw/Get P art Name  
and then typing in the part name or by selecting the part name from 
the analog.slb library. As shown typically in Fig. 13.52(a), the main  
attributes of the linear transformer are the coupling coef ficient k and 
the inductance v alues L1 and L2 in henries. If the mutual induc
-
tance M is specified, its value must be used along with L1 and L2 to  
 calculate k. Keep in mind that the v alue of k should lie between 0  
and 1.
For the ideal transformer , the part name is XFRM_NONLINEAR  
and is located in the breako ut.slb library. Select it by clicking Draw/
Get Part Name and then typing in the part name. Its attrib utes are the 
coupling coefficient and the numbers of turns associated with L1 and L2, 
as illustrated typically in Fig. 13.52(b). The value of the coef ficient of 
mutual coupling k = 1.

The schematic of the circuit is portrayed in Fig. 13.54. Notice ho w 
the dot convention is adhered to. For L2, the dot (not shown) is on pin 1  
(the left-hand terminal) and is therefore placed without rotation. For L1, 
in order for the dot to be on the right-hand side of the inductor, the induc-
tor must be rotated through 180 °. For L3, the inductor must be rotated 
through 90° so that the dot will be at the bottom. Note that the 2-H in -
ductor (L4) is not coupled. To handle the three coupled inductors, we use

 Applications
Transformers are the largest, the heaviest, and often the costliest of cir -
cuit components. Nevertheless, they are indispensable passive devices in 
electric circuits. They are among the most efficient machines, 95 percent 
efficiency being common and 99 percent being achie vable. They have 
numerous applications. For example, transformers are used:
• To step up or step down voltage and current, making them useful for 
power transmission and distribution.
• To isolate one portion of a circuit from another (i.e., to transfer 
power without any electrical connection).
• As an impedance-matching device for maximum power transfer.
• In frequenc y-selective circuits whose operation depends on the 
response of inductances.
Practice Problem 13.14

Because of these di verse uses, there are man y special designs for 
transformers (only some of which are discussed in this chapter): v
olt-
age transformers, current transformers, power transformers, distribution 
transformers, impedance-matching transformers, audio transformers, 
single-phase transformers, three-phase transformers, rectifier transform-
ers, inverter transformers, and more. In this section, we consider three 
important applications: transformer as an isolation de vice, transformer 
as a matching device, and power distribution system. 
13.9.1  Transformer as an Isolation Device
Electrical isolation is said to exist between two devices when there is 
no physical connection between them. In a transformer, energy is trans-
ferred by magnetic coupling, without electrical connection between the 
primary circuit and secondary circuit. 
We now consider three simple 
practical examples of how we take advantage of this property. 
First, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.59. A rectifier is an electronic cir-
cuit that converts an ac supply to a dc supply. A transformer is often used to 
couple the ac supply to the rectifier. The transformer serves two purposes. 
First, it steps up or steps do wn the voltage. Second, it provides electrical 
isolation between the ac po wer supply and the rectifier, thereby reducing 
the risk of shock hazard in handling the electronic device. 
As a second e xample, a transformer is often used to couple tw
o 
stages of an amplifier, to prevent any dc voltage in one stage from affect-
ing the dc bias of the next stage. Biasing is the application of a dc voltage 
to a transistor amplifier or any other electronic device in order to produce 
a desired mode of operation. Each amplifier stage is biased separately 
to operate in a particular mode; the desired mode of operation will be 
compromised without a transformer providing dc isolation. As shown in 
Fig. 13.60, only the ac signal is coupled through the transformer from 
one stage to the next. We recall that magnetic coupling does not exist 
with a dc voltage source. Transformers are used in radio and TV receiv-
ers to couple stages of high-frequency amplifiers. When the sole purpose 
of a transformer is to pro vide isolation, its turns ratio n is made unity . 
Thus, an isolation transformer has n = 1. 
As a third example, consider measuring the voltage across 13.2-kV 
lines. It is obviously not safe to connect a voltmeter directly to such high-
voltage lines. A transformer can be used both to electrically isolate the 
line power from the v oltmeter and to step do wn the v oltage to a safe 
level, as shown in Fig. 13.61. Once the voltmeter is used to mea sure the

Determine the voltage across the load in Fig. 13.62.
Solution:
We can apply the superposition principle to find the load voltage. Let 
vL = vL1 + vL2, where vL1 is due to the dc source and vL2 is due to the 
ac source. We consider the dc and ac sources separately, as shown in 
 
Fig. 13.63. The load voltage due to the dc source is zero, because a time-
varying voltage is necessary in the primary circuit to induce a voltage in 
the secondary circuit. Thus, vL1 = 0. For the ac source and a value of Rs 
so small it can be neglected,

____ 
120  =   1 
__ 3   
or  
V2 =   120 
____

Hence, VL2 = 40 V ac or vL2 = 40 cos ωt; that is, only the ac voltage 
is passed to the load by the transformer. This example shows how the 
transformer provides dc isolation.

Answer: 120.
13.9.2  Transformer as a Matching Device
We recall that for maximum po wer transfer, the load resistance RL
must be matched with the source resistance Rs. In most cases, the  
two resistances are not matched; both are fixed and cannot be altered. 
However, an iron-core transformer can be used to match the load 
resistance to the source resistance. This is called impedance match-
ing. For example, to connect a loudspeaker to an audio power ampli-
fier requires a transformer, because the speaker’s resistance is only a   
few ohms while the internal resistance of the amplifier is several thou-
sand ohms.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 13.64. We recall from Eq. (13.60) 
that the ideal transformer reflects its load back to the primary with a

resistance Rs, we set them equal,

___

(13.73)
Equation (13.73) can be satisfied by proper selection of the turns ratio n. 
From Eq. (13.73), we notice that a step-down transformer (n < 1) is needed  
as the matching device when Rs > RL, and a step-up ( n > 1) is required 
when Rs < RL.

The ideal transformer in Fig. 13.65 is used to match the amplifier circuit 
to the loudspeak er to achie ve maximum po wer transfer. The Thevenin 
(or output) impedance of the amplifier is 192 Ω, and the internal imped-
ance of the speaker is 12 Ω. Determine the required turns ratio.
Solution:
We replace the amplifier circuit with the Thevenin equivalent and  
reflect the impedance ZL = 12 Ω of the speaker to the primary side of the 
ideal transformer. Figure 13.66 shows the result. For maximum power 
transfer,

or

Thus, the turns ratio is n = 1∕4 = 0.25.
Using P = I2R, we can sho w that indeed the po wer delivered to the 
speaker is much lar ger than without the ideal transformer. Without 
the ideal transformer, the amplifier is directly connected to the speaker.

13.9.3  Power Distribution
A po wer system basically consists of three components: generation, 
transmission, and distrib ution. The local electric compan y operates a 
plant that generates se
veral hundreds of me
gavolt-amperes (MV A), 
typically at about 18 kV . As Fig. 13.67 illustrates, three-phase step-up 
transformers are used to feed the generated po wer to the transmission 
line. Why do we need the transformer? Suppose we need to transmit 
100,000 VA over a distance of 50 km. Since S = VI, using a line voltage 
of 1,000 V implies that the transmission line must carry 100 A and this 
requires a transmission line of a large diameter. If, on the other hand, we 
use a line voltage of 10,000 V, the current is only 10 A. The smaller cur-
rent reduces the required conductor size, producing considerable savings 
as well as minimizing transmission line I2R losses. To minimize losses 
requires a step-up transformer. Without the transformer, the majority of 
the power generated would be lost on the transmission line. The ability 
of the transformer to step up or step down voltage and distribute power 
economically is one of the major reasons for generating ac rather than 
dc. Thus, for a gi ven power, the lar ger the v oltage, the better . Today,  
1 MV is the lar gest voltage in use; the level may increase as a result of 
research and experiments.

Beyond the generation plant, the power is transmitted for hundreds 
of miles through an electric netw ork called the power grid. The three-
phase power in the po wer grid is con veyed by transmission lines hung 
overhead from steel towers which come in a variety of sizes and shapes. 
The (aluminum-conductor, steel-reinforced) lines typically have overall 
diameters up to about 40 mm and can carry current of up to 1,380 A.
At the substations, distrib ution transformers are used to step do wn 
the voltage. The step-down process is usually carried out in stages. 
Power may be distributed throughout a locality by means of either over-
head or under ground cables. The substations distrib ute the po wer to 
residential, commercial, and industrial customers. At the receiving end, 
a residential customer is e ventually supplied with 120 ∕240 V, while 
industrial or commercial customers are fed with higher voltages such as 
 One may ask, How would increasing 
the voltage not increase the current, 
thereby increasing I2R losses? Keep in 
mind that I = Vℓ∕R, where Vℓ is the 
potential difference between the 
sending and receiving ends of the line. 
The voltage that is stepped up is the 
sending end voltage V, not Vℓ. If the 
receiving end is VR, then Vℓ = V − VR. 
Since V and VR are close to each other, 
Vℓ is small even when V is stepped up.

460∕208 V. Residential customers are usually supplied by distrib ution 
transformers often mounted on the poles of the electric utility company. 
When direct current is needed, the alternating current is converted to dc 
electronically.

former with unity coupling coef ficient (k = 1) and infinite induc-
tances (L1, L2, M → ∞).

have major high-voltage DC transmission segments. 
There are a lot of good reasons for doing this but 
we will not go into them here. To go from the AC 
to DC, power electronics are used. We start with 
three-phase AC and then rectify it (using a full-wave 
rectifier). It was found that using a delta to wye and 
delta combination connected secondary would give 
us a much smaller ripple after the full-wave rectifier. 
How is this accomplished? Remember that these are 
real devices and are wound on common cores.  
Hint: Use Figs. 13.47 and 13.49, and the fact that 
each coil of the wye connected secondary and each 
coil of the delta connected secondary are wound 
around the same core of each coil of the delta con-
nected primary so the voltage of each of the  
corresponding coils are in phase. When the output 
leads of both secondaries are connected through full-
wave rectifiers with the same load, you will see that 
the ripple is now greatly reduced. Please consult the 
instructor for more help if necessary.

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Control Systems
Control systems are another area of electrical engineering where circuit 
analysis is used. A control system is designed to re gulate the behavior 
of one or more variables in some desired manner. Control systems play 
major roles in our everyday life. Household appliances such as heat-
ing and air-conditioning systems, switch-controlled thermostats, w ash-
ers and dryers, cruise controllers in automobiles, elevators, traffic lights, 
manufacturing plants, navigation systems—all utilize control systems. In 
the aerospace field, precision guidance of space probes, the wide range 
of operational modes of the space shuttle, and the ability to maneuv
er 
space vehicles remotely from earth all require knowledge of control sys-
tems. In the manuf acturing sector, repetitive production line operations 
are increasingly performed by robots, which are programmable control 
systems designed to operate for many hours without fatigue.
Control engineering inte grates circuit theory and communication 
theory. It is not limited to an y specific engineering discipline but may 
involve en vironmental, chemical, aeronautical, mechanical, ci vil, and 
electrical engineering. For example, a typical task for a control system 
engineer might be to design a speed regulator for a disk drive head.
A thorough understanding of control systems techniques is essen -
tial to the electrical engineer and is of great v alue for designing control 
systems to perform the desired task.

Frequency Response
14.1
 Introduction
In our sinusoidal circuit analysis, we ha
ve learned ho w to find volt-
ages and currents in a circuit with a constant 
frequency source. If we 
let the amplitude of the sinusoidal source remain constant and v ary the 
 frequency, we obtain the circuit’ s frequency response. The frequency 
response may be re garded as a complete description of the sinusoidal 
steady-state behavior of a circuit as a function of  frequency.
The frequency response of a circuit is the variation in its behavior with 
change in signal frequency.
The sinusoidal steady-state frequenc y responses of circuits are of 
significance in many applications, especially in communications and 
control systems. A specific application is in electric filters that block out 
or eliminate signals with unw anted frequencies and pass signals of the 
desired frequencies. Filters are used in radio, TV, and telephone systems 
to separate one broadcast frequency from another.
We begin this chapter by considering the frequency response of sim-
ple circuits using their transfer functions. We then consider Bode plots, 
which are the industry-standard w ay of presenting frequenc y response. 
We also consider series and parallel resonant circuits and encounter 
 important concepts such as resonance, quality f actor, cutoff frequency, 
and bandwidth. We discuss dif ferent kinds of filters and network scal-
ing. In the last section, we consider one practical application of resonant 
circuits and two applications of filters.
14.2
 Transfer Function
The transfer function H(ω) (also called the network function) is a  useful 
analytical tool for finding the frequency response of a circuit. In fact, the 
frequency response of a circuit is the plot of the circuit’ s transfer func-
tion H(ω) versus ω, with ω varying from ω = 0 to ω = ∞.
A transfer function is the frequenc y-dependent ratio of a forced 
function to a forcing function (or of an output to an input). The idea of a 
transfer function was implicit when we used the concepts of impedance 
The frequency response of a circuit 
may also be considered as the 
 variation of the gain and phase 
with frequency.
Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Understand what transfer functions are and how to determine them.
2. Understand the decibel scale, why we use it, and how to use it.
3. Understand Bode plots, and know why we use them and how 
to determine them.
4. Understand series and parallel resonance, why they are 
 important, and how to find them.
5. Understand passive filters.
6. Understand active filters.
7. Discuss magnitude and frequency scaling and why they are 
important.

and admittance to relate v oltage and current. In general, a linear net -
work can be represented by the block diagram shown in Fig. 14.1.
The transfer function H(ω) of a circuit is the frequency-dependent ratio 
of a phasor output Y(ω) (an element voltage or current) to a  phasor input 
X(ω) (source voltage or current).
Thus,
H(ω) =  
Y(ω) 
_____ 
X(ω)  
(14.1)
assuming zero initial conditions. Since the input and output can be ei
-
ther voltage or current at any place in the circuit, there are four possible 
transfer functions:
H(ω) = Voltage gain =  Vo(ω) 
_____ 
Vi(ω)  
(14.2a)
 
H(ω) = Current gain =  Io(ω) 
_____ 
Ii(ω)  
(14.2b)
 
H(ω) = Transfer impedance =  Vo(ω) 
_____ 
Ii(ω)  
(14.2c)
 
H(ω) = Transfer admittance =  Io(ω) 
_____ 
Vi(ω)  
(14.2d)
where subscripts i and o denote input and output values. Being a  complex 
quantity, H(ω) has a magnitude H(ω) and a phase ϕ; that is, H(ω) = 
H(ω)⧸ ϕ.
To obtain the transfer function using Eq. (14.2), we first obtain 
the frequency-domain equivalent of the circuit by replacing resistors, 
 inductors, and capacitors with their impedances R, jωL, and 1∕jωC. We 
then use an y circuit technique(s) to obtain the appropriate quantity in 
Eq. (14.2). We can obtain the frequency response of the circuit by plot -
ting the magnitude and phase of the transfer function as the frequenc
y 
varies. A computer is a real time-saver for plotting the transfer  function.
The transfer function H(ω) can be expressed in terms of its numera-
tor polynomial N(ω) and denominator polynomial D(ω) as
 
H(ω) =   
N(ω) 
_____ 
D(ω)  
 
(14.3)
where N(ω) and D(ω) are not necessarily the same e xpressions for the 
input and output functions, respecti vely. The representation of H(ω) in 
Eq. (14.3) assumes that common numerator and denominator f actors in 
H(ω) have canceled, reducing the ratio to lo
west terms. The roots of 
N(ω) = 0 are called the zeros of H(ω) and are usually represented as 
jω = z1, z2, …. Similarly, the roots of D(ω) = 0 are the poles of H(ω) and 
are represented as jω = p1, p2,….
A zero, as a root of the numerator polynomial, is a value that results in a 
zero value of the function. A pole, as a root of the denominator polyno-
mial, is a value for which the function is infinite.
To avoid complex algebra, it is expedient to replace jω  temporarily 
with s when working with H(ω) and replace s with jω at the end.

 In this context, X(ω) and Y(ω) denote 
the input and output phasors of a 
network; they should not be confused 
with the same symbolism used for 
reactance and admittance. The multiple 
usage of symbols is conventionally 
permissible due to lack of enough 
letters in the English language to express 
all circuit variables distinctly.
Some authors use H( jω) for transfer 
 instead of H(ω), since ω and j are an 
inseparable pair.
A zero may also be regarded as the 
value of s = jω that makes H(s) zero, 
and a pole as the value of s = jω that 
makes H(s) infinite.

14.3
 The Decibel Scale
It is not always easy to get a quick plot of the magnitude and phase of the 
transfer function as we did above. A more systematic way of obtaining 
the frequency response is to use Bode plots. Before we begin to construct 
Bode plots, we should take care of two important issues: the use of loga-
rithms and decibels in expressing gain.

Since Bode plots are based on log arithms, it is important that we 
keep the following properties of logarithms in mind:
1. log P1P2 = log P1 + log P2
2. log P1∕P2 = log P1 − log P2
3. log Pn = n log P
4. log 1 = 0
In communications systems, gain is measured in bels. Historically, 
the bel is used to measure the ratio of two levels of power or power gain 
G; that is,
G = Number of bels = log10  P2 
___ 
P1
  
(14.4)
The decibel (dB) provides us with a unit of less magnitude. It is 1∕10th of 
a bel and is given by
 
GdB = 10 log10   
P2
 
___
 
P1  
 
(14.5)
When P1 = P2, there is no change in po
wer and the g ain is 0 dB. If  
P2 = 2P1, the gain is
 
GdB = 10 log10 2 ≃ 3 dB 
(14.6)
and when P2 = 0.5P1, the gain is
 
GdB = 10 log10 0.5 ≃ −3 dB 
(14.7)
Equations (14.6) and (14.7) sho w another reason wh y logarithms are 
greatly used: The logarithm of the reciprocal of a quantity is simply 
 negative the logarithm of that quantity.
Alternatively, the g ain G can be e xpressed in terms of v oltage or 
current ratio. To do so, consider the network shown in Fig. 14.8. If P1 is 
the input power, P2 is the output (load) power, R1 is the input resistance,

Frequency Response
Alexander Graham Bell (1847–1922) inventor of the telephone, was 
a Scottish-American scientist.
Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, a son of Alexander Melville 
Bell, a well-known speech teacher. Alexander the younger also became 
a speech teacher after graduating from the University of Edinburgh and 
the University of London. In 1866 he became interested in transmitting 
speech electrically. After his older brother died of tuberculosis, his father 
decided to move to Canada. Alexander was asked to come to Boston 
to work at the School for the Deaf. There he met Thomas A. Watson, 
who became his assistant in his electromagnetic transmitter experiment. 
On March 10, 1876, Alexander sent the famous first telephone message: 
“Watson, come here I want you.” The bel, the logarithmic unit intro
-
duced in this chapter, is named in his honor.

(14.11)
Three things are important to note from Eqs. (14.5), (14.10), and (14.11):
1. That 10 log 10 is used for po wer, while 20 log 10 is used for v olt-
age or current, because of the square relationship between them 
 
(P = V2∕R = I2R).
2. That the dB value is a logarithmic measurement of the ratio of one 
variable to another of the same type. Therefore, it applies in express-
ing the transfer function H in Eqs. (14.2a) and (14.2b), which are 
dimensionless quantities, but not in expressing H in Eqs. (14.2c) and 
(14.2d).
3. It is important to note that we only use voltage and current magni-
tudes in Eqs. (14.10) and (14.11). Negative signs and angles will be 
handled independently as we will see in Section 14.4.
With this in mind, we now apply the concepts of logarithms and decibels 
to construct Bode plots.
14.4
 Bode Plots
Obtaining the frequency response from the transfer function as we did 
in Section 14.2 is an uphill task. The frequency range required in fre -
quency response is often so wide that it is incon venient to use a linear 
scale for the frequenc y axis. Also, there is a more systematic w ay of 
locating the important features of the magnitude and phase plots of the 
transfer function. For these reasons, it has become standard practice to 
plot the transfer function on a pair of semilogarithmic plots: The mag-
nitude in decibels is plotted against the logarithm of the frequency; on a 
separate plot, the phase in degrees is plotted against the logarithm of the 
 frequency. Such semilogarithmic plots of the transfer function—kno wn 
as Bode plots—have become the industry standard.
Bode plots are semilog plots of the magnitude (in decibels) and phase 
(in degrees) of a transfer function versus frequency.
14.4
Bode Plots
617
Historical note: Named after Hendrik 
W. Bode (1905–1982), an engineer 
with the Bell Telephone Laboratories, 
for his pioneering work in the 1930s 
and 1940s.

Bode plots contain the same information as the nonlogarithmic plots dis-
cussed in the previous section, but they are much easier to construct, as 
we shall see shortly.
The transfer function can be written as
H = H⧸ ϕ = He jϕ 
(14.12)
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides,
 
ln H = ln H + ln e jϕ = ln H + jϕ 
(14.13)
Thus, the real part of ln H is a function of the magnitude while the imagi-
nary part is the phase. In a Bode magnitude plot, the gain
 
HdB = 20 log10 H
 
(14.14)
is plotted in decibels (dB) v ersus frequency. Table 14.2 provides a few 
values of H with the corresponding values in decibels. In a Bode phase 
plot, ϕ is plotted in degrees versus frequency. Both magnitude and phase 
plots are made on semilog graph paper.
A transfer function in the form of Eq. (14.3) may be written in terms of 
factors that have real and imaginary parts. One such representation might be
H(ω) =  K(jω)±1(1 + jω∕z1)[1 + j2ζ1ω∕ωk + (jω∕ωk)2]⋯ 
 
 
 
_______________________________________    
(1 + jω∕p1)[1 + j2ζ2ω∕ωn + (jω∕ωn)2]⋯
 
 
(14.15)
which is obtained by di viding out the poles and zeros in 
H(ω). The 
representation of H(ω) as in Eq. (14.15) is called the 
standard form. 
H(ω) may include up to seven types of different factors that can appear 
in various combinations in a transfer function. These are:
1. A gain K
2. A pole (jω)−1 or zero (jω) at the origin
3. A simple pole 1∕(1 + jω∕p1) or zero (1 + jω∕z1)
4. A quadratic pole 1
∕[1 + j2ζ2ω∕ωn + ( jω∕ωn)2] or zero 
 
[1 + j2ζ1ω∕ωk + ( jω∕ωk)2]
In constructing a Bode plot, we plot each factor separately and then add 
them graphically. The factors can be considered one at a time and then 
combined additively because of the logarithms involved. It is this math-
ematical convenience of the logarithm that makes Bode plots a powerful 
engineering tool.
We will now make straight-line plots of the factors listed above. We 
shall find that these straight-line plots known as Bode plots approximate 
the actual plots to a reasonable degree of accuracy.
Constant term:  For the gain K, the magnitude is 20 log 10 K and the 
phase is 0°; both are constant with frequenc y. Thus, the magnitude and 
phase plots of the gain are shown in Fig. 14.9. If K is negative, the mag-
nitude remains 20 log10 ∣K∣ but the phase is ±180°.
Pole/zero at the origin:  For the zero (jω) at the origin, the magnitude 
is 20 log10 ω and the phase is 90°. These are plotted in Fig. 14.10, where 
we notice that the slope of the magnitude plot is 20 dB/decade, while the 
phase is constant with frequency.
The Bode plots for the pole (jω)−1 are similar except that the slope of 
the magnitude plot is −20 dB/decade while the phase is −90°. In general,

showing that we can approximate the magnitude as zero (a straight line 
with zero slope) for small v alues of ω and by a straight line with slope 
20 dB/decade for large values of ω. The frequency ω = z1 where the two 
asymptotic lines meet is called the corner frequency or break frequency. 
Thus, the approximate magnitude plot is sho wn in Fig. 14.11(a), where 
the actual plot is also shown. Notice that the approximate plot is close to 
the actual plot except at the break frequency, where ω = z1 and the devia-

with the actual plot, the straight-line plot has a slope of 45° per decade.
The Bode plots for the pole 1 ∕(1 + jω∕p1) are similar to those in

A decade is an interval between two 
frequencies with a ratio of 10; e.g., 
 between ω0 and 10ω0,  or between 
10 and 100 Hz. Thus, 20 dB/decade 
means that the magnitude changes

changes tenfold or one decade.

Thus, the amplitude plot consists of tw o straight asymptotic lines: one 
with zero slope for ω < ωn and the other with slope 
−40 dB/decade 
for ω  > ωn, with ωn as the corner frequenc y. Figure 14.12(a) sho ws 
the  approximate and actual amplitude plots. Note that the actual plot 
 depends on the damping factor ζ2 as well as the corner frequency ωn. The 
significant peaking in the neighborhood of the corner frequency should 
be added to the straight-line approximation if a high le vel of accurac y 
is desired. However, we will use the straight-line approximation for the 
sake of simplicity.

The phase plot is a straight line with a slope of −90° per decade starting 
at ωn∕10 and ending at 10ωn, as shown in Fig. 14.12(b). We see again that 
the difference between the actual plot and the straight-line plot is due to 
the damping factor. Notice that the straight-line approximations for both 
magnitude and phase plots for the quadratic pole are the same as those
 
for a double pole, that is, (1  + jω∕ωn)−2. We should expect this because  
the double pole (1 + jω∕ωn)−2 equals the quadratic pole 1∕[1 + j2ζ2ω∕ωn + 
(jω∕ωn)2] when ζ2 = 1. Thus, the quadratic pole can be  treated as a double 
pole as far as straight-line approximation is concerned.
For the quadratic zero [1
 + j2ζ1ω∕ωk + (jω∕ωk)2], the plots in 
Fig.  14.12 are in verted because the magnitude plot has a 
slope of  
40 dB/decade while the phase plot has a slope of 90° per decade.
Table 14.3 presents a summary of Bode plots for the se ven factors. 
Of course, not every transfer function has all seven factors. To sketch the 
Bode plots for a function H(ω) in the form of Eq. (14.15), for e xample, 
we first record the corner frequencies on the semilog graph paper, sketch 
the factors one at a time as discussed above, and then combine additively 
There is another procedure for obtaining 
Bode plots that is faster and perhaps 
more efficient than the one we have just 
discussed. It consists in realizing that 
zeros cause an increase in slope, while 
poles cause a decrease. By starting with 
the low-frequency asymptote of the 
Bode plot, moving along the frequency 
axis, and increasing or decreasing the 
slope at each corner frequency, one can 
sketch the Bode plot immediately from 
the transfer function without the effort of 
making individual plots and adding 
them. This procedure can be used once 
you become proficient in the one 
 discussed here.
  
Digital computers have rendered 
the procedure discussed here almost 
obsolete. Several software packages 
such as PSpice, MATLAB, Mathcad, 
and Micro-Cap can be used to gener-
ate frequency response plots. We will 
discuss PSpice later in the chapter.

For the quadratic pole, ωn = 10 rad/s, which serves as the  corner fre-
quency. The magnitude and phase are

Figure 14.17 shows the Bode plots. Notice that the quadratic pole 
is treated as a repeated pole at ωk, that is, (1 + jω∕ωk)2, which is an 
approximation.
5. Evaluate. Although we could use MATLAB to validate the solution, 
we will use a more straightforward approach. First, we must realize 
that the denominator assumes that ζ = 0 for the approximation, so 
we will use the following equation to check our answer:
H(s) ≃  s + 1 
_______ 
s2 + 102  
  
We also note that we need to actually solve for HdB and the corre-
sponding phase angle ϕ. First, let ω = 0.
HdB = 20 log10 (1∕100) = −40  
and  
ϕ = 0°
 
Now try ω = 1.
HdB = 20 log10(1.4142∕99) = −36.9 dB
 
which is the expected 3 dB up from the corner frequency.

Now try ω = 100.
HdB = 20 log10 (100) − 20 log10 (9900) = 39.91 dB
  
ϕ is 90° from the numerator minus 180°, which gives −90°. We now 
have checked three different points and got close agreement, and, 
because this is an approximation, we can feel confident that we have 
worked the problem successfully.
 
  
You can reasonably ask why did we not check at ω = 10? If we 
just use the approximate value we used above, we end up with an 
infinite value, which is to be expected from ζ = 0 (see Fig. 14.12a). If 
we used the actual value of H( j10) we will still end up being far from 
the approximate values, since ζ = 0.6 and Fig. 14.12a shows a sig-
nificant deviation from the approximation. We could have reworked 
the problem with ζ = 0.707, which would have gotten us closer to 
the approximation. However, we really have enough points without 
doing this.
6. Satisfactory? We are satisfied the problem has been worked 
 successfully and we can present the results as a solution to the
 
problem.
Practice Problem 14.5
Construct the Bode plots for
H(s) =

s(s2 + 80s + 400)
  
Answer: See Fig. 14.18.
Example 14.6
Given the Bode plot in Fig. 14.19, obtain the transfer function H(ω).
Solution:
To obtain H(ω) from the Bode plot, we keep in mind that a zero al
-
ways causes an upward turn at a corner frequency, while a pole causes 

14.5
Series Resonance
627
a  downward turn. We notice from Fig. 14.19 that there is a zero 
jω at 
the origin, which should have intersected the frequency axis at ω = 1. 
This is indicated by the straight line with slope +20 dB/decade. The fact 
that this straight line is shifted by 40 dB indicates that there is a 40-dB 
gain; that is,
40 = 20 log10 K  
⇒  
log10 K = 2
or
K = 102 = 100
In addition to the zero jω at the origin, we notice that there are three factors 
with corner frequencies at ω = 1, 5, and 20 rad/s. Thus, we have:
1. A pole at p = 1 with slope −20 dB/decade to cause a downward turn 
and counteract the zero at the origin. The pole at p = 1 is determined 
as 1∕(1 + jω∕1).
2. Another pole at p = 5 with slope −20 dB/decade causing a do wn-
ward turn. The pole is 1∕(1 + jω∕5).
3. A third pole at p = 20 with slope −20 dB/decade causing a further 
downward turn. The pole is 1∕(1 + jω∕20).
 
Putting all these together gives the corresponding transfer function as
H(ω) =  
100 jω

discrimination in communications netw orks. Resonance occurs in an y 
circuit that has at least one inductor and one capacitor.
Resonance is a condition in an RLC circuit in which the capacitive and 
inductive reactances are equal in magnitude, thereby resulting in a purely 
resistive impedance.
Resonant circuits (series or parallel) are useful for constructing filters, as 
their transfer functions can be highly frequency selective. They are used 
in many applications such as selecting the desired stations in radio and 
TV receivers.

(14.34)
showing that the resonant frequenc y is the geometric mean of the half-
power frequencies. Notice that ω1 and ω2 are in general not symmetrical 
around the resonant frequency ω0, because the frequency response is not 
generally symmetrical. However, as will be explained shortly, symmetry 
of the half-power frequencies around the resonant frequenc y is often a 
reasonable approximation.
Although the height of the curv e in Fig. 14.22 is determined by R, 
the width of the curv e depends on other f actors. The width of the re -
sponse curve depends on the bandwidth B, which is defined as the differ-
ence between the two half-power frequencies,
 
B = ω2 − ω1 
(14.35)
This definition of bandwidth is just one of several that are commonly 
used. Strictly speaking, B in Eq. (14.35) is a half-po
wer bandwidth, 
 because it is the width of the frequenc y band between the half-po wer 
frequencies.
The “sharpness” of the resonance in a resonant circuit is measured

Notice that the quality factor is dimensionless. The relationship between

The quality factor of a resonant circuit is the ratio of its resonant  frequency 
to its bandwidth.
Keep in mind that Eqs. (14.33), (14.38), and (14.39) only apply to a 
series RLC circuit.
As illustrated in Fig. 14.23, the higher the v
alue of Q, the more 
 selective the circuit is but the smaller the bandwidth. The selectivity of an 
RLC circuit is the ability of the circuit to respond to a certain frequenc y 
and discriminate against all other frequencies. If the band of frequencies 
to be selected or rejected is narrow, the quality f actor of the resonant 
circuit must be high. If the band of frequencies is wide, the quality factor 
must be low.
A resonant circuit is designed to operate at or near its resonant fre -
quency. It is said to be a high-Q circuit when its quality factor is equal 
to or greater than 10. F or high -Q circuits (Q ≥ 10), the half-  power 
 frequencies are, for all practical purposes, symmetrical around the 
 resonant frequency and can be approximated as

 Passive Filters
The concept of filters has been an integral part of the evolution of electri-
cal engineering from the beginning. Several technological achievements 
would not have been possible without electrical filters. Because of this 
prominent role of filters, much effort has been expended on the theory, 
design, and construction of filters and many articles and books have been 
written on them. Our discussion in this chapter should be considered 
introductory.
A filter is a circuit that is designed to pass signals with desired  frequencies 
and reject or attenuate others.
As a frequency-selective device, a filter can be used to limit the fre-
quency spectrum of a signal to some specified band of frequencies. 
Filters are the circuits used in radio and TV receivers to allow us to
 
select one desired signal out of a multitude of broadcast signals in the  
environment.
A filter is a passive filter if it consists of only passive elements R, 
L, and C. It is said to be an active filter if it consists of acti ve elements 
(such as transistors and op amps) in addition to passi ve elements R, L, 
and C. We consider passive filters in this section and active filters in 
the next section. LC filters have been used in practical applications for 
more than eight decades. LC filter technology feeds related areas such 
as equalizers, impedance-matching networks, transformers, shaping net-
works, power dividers, attenuators, and directional couplers, and is con-
tinuously providing practicing engineers with opportunities to inno vate 
and experiment. Besides the LC filters we study in these sections, there 
are other kinds of filters—such as digital filters, electromechanical filters, 
and microwave filters—which are beyond the level of this text.

Practice Problem 14.9
Calculate the resonant frequency of the circuit in Fig. 14.29.
Answer: 173.21 rad/s.

As shown in Fig. 14.30, there are four types of filters whether pas-
sive or active:
1. A low-pass filter passes low frequencies and stops high frequencies, 
as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(a).
2. A high-pass filter passes high frequencies and rejects low frequencies, 
as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(b).
3. A band-pass filter passes frequencies within a frequenc y band and 
blocks or attenuates frequencies outside the band, as sho wn ideally 
in Fig. 14.30(c).
4. A band-stop filter passes frequencies outside a frequency band and 
blocks or attenuates frequencies within the band, as sho wn ideally 
in Fig. 14.30(d).
Table 14.5 presents a summary of the characteristics of these filters. Be 
aware that the characteristics in Table 14.5 are only valid for first- or 
second-order filters—but one should not have the impression that only 
these kinds of filter exist. We now consider typical circuits for realizing 
the filters shown in Table 14.5.

 The cutoff frequency is the frequency at 
which the transfer function H drops in 
magnitude to 70.71% of its maximum 
value. It is also regarded as the 
fre quency at which the power 
dissipated in a circuit is half of its 
maximum value.

The cutoff frequency is also called the rolloff frequency.
A low-pass filter is designed to pass only frequencies from dc up to the 
cutoff frequency ωc.
A low-pass filter can also be formed when the output of an RL cir-
cuit is taken off the resistor. Of course, there are many other circuits for 
low-pass filters.

output is taken off the resistor as shown in Fig. 14.35. The transfer 
function is

We observe that H(0) = 0, H(∞) = 0. Figure 14.36 shows the plot of 
∣H(ω)∣. The band-pass filter passes a band of frequencies (ω1 < ω < ω2) 
centered on ω0, the center frequency, which is given by

____ 
 √ 
___ 
LC  
  
(14.55)
A band-pass filter is designed to pass all frequencies within a band of 
frequencies, ω1 < ω < ω2.
Because the band-pass filter in Fig. 14.35 is a series resonant circuit, 
the half-power frequencies, the bandwidth, and the quality factor are 
 determined as in Section 14.5. A band-pass filter can also be formed 
by  cascading the low-pass filter (where ω2 = ωc) in Fig. 14.31 with the 

high-pass filter (where ω1 = ωc) in Fig. 14.33. However, the result would 
not be the same as just adding the output of the low-pass filter to the 
input of the high-pass filter, because one circuit loads the other and alters 
the desired transfer function.
14.7.4  Band-Stop Filter
A filter that prevents a band of frequencies between two designated 
values (ω1 and ω2) from passing is variably known as a band-stop, band-
reject, or notch filter. A band-stop filter is formed when the output RLC 
series resonant circuit is taken off the LC series combination as shown in 
Fig. 14.37. The transfer function is
 
H(ω) =  Vo 
___ 
Vi
  =  j(ωL − 1∕ωC)

while the half-power frequencies, the bandwidth, and the quality  factor

nant circuit. Here, ω0 is called the frequency of rejection, while the 
 corresponding bandwidth (B = ω2 − ω1) is known as the bandwidth of 
 rejection. Thus,
A band-stop filter is designed to stop or eliminate all frequencies within 
a band of frequencies, ω1 < ω < ω2.
Notice that adding the transfer functions of the band-pass and the 
band-stop gives unity at any frequency for the same values of R, L, and 
C. Of course, this is not true in general b ut true for the circuits treated 
here. This is due to the fact that the characteristic of one is the inverse 
of the other.
In concluding this section, we should note that:
1. From Eqs. (14.50), (14.52), (14.54), and (14.56), the maximum gain 
of a passive filter is unity. To generate a gain greater than unity, one 
should use an active filter as the next section shows.
2. There are other ways to get the types of filters treated in this section.
3. The filters treated here are the simple types. Many other filters have 
sharper and complex frequency responses.

 Active Filters
There are three major limitations to the passive filters considered in the 
previous section. First, they cannot generate gain greater than 1; passive 
elements cannot add energy to the network. Second, they may require 
bulky and expensive inductors. Third, they perform poorly at frequencies 
below the audio frequency range (300 Hz < f < 3,000Hz). Nevertheless, 
passive filters are useful at high frequencies.
Active filters consist of combinations of resistors, capacitors, and 
op amps. They offer some advantages over passive RLC filters. First, 
they are often smaller and less expensive, because they do not require 
inductors. This makes feasible the integrated circuit realizations of fil-
ters. Second, they can provide amplifier gain in addition to pro viding 
the same frequenc y response as RLC filters. Third, active filters can 
be combined with buffer amplifiers (voltage followers) to isolate each 
stage of the filter from source and load impedance effects. This iso-
lation allows designing the stages independently and then cascading 
them to realize the desired transfer function. (Bode plots, being log a-
rithmic, may be added when transfer functions are cascaded.) Ho
w-
ever, active filters are less reliable and less stable. The practical limit

This way of creating a band-pass filter,

of most active filters is about 100 kHz—most active filters operate well 
below that frequency.
Filters are often classified according to their order (or number of 
poles) or their specific design type.
14.8.1  First-Order Low-Pass Filter
One type of first-order filter is shown in Fig. 14.41. The components se-
lected for Zi and Zf determine whether the filter is low-pass or high-pass, 
but one of the components must be reactive.
Figure 14.42 shows a typical active low-pass filter. For this filter, the 
transfer function is
 
H(ω) =  Vo

We notice that Eq. (14.60) is similar to Eq. (14.50), except that there 
is a low frequency ( ω → 0) gain or dc gain of −Rf∕Ri. Also, the corner 
frequency is
 
ωc =  1

(14.61)
which does not depend on Ri. This means that several inputs with dif -
ferent Ri could be summed if required, and the corner frequency would 
remain the same for each input.

14.8.3   Band-Pass Filter
The circuit in Fig. 14.42 may be combined with that in Fig. 14.43 to 
form a band-pass filter that will have a gain K over the required range 
of frequencies. By cascading a unity-gain low-pass filter, a unity-gain 

high-pass filter, and an inverter with gain −Rf∕Ri, as shown in the block 
diagram of Fig. 14.44(a), we can construct a band-pass filter whose fre-
quency response is that in Fig. 14.44(b). The actual construction of the 
band-pass filter is shown in Fig. 14.45.

A band-reject filter may be constructed by parallel combination of a low-
pass filter and a high-pass filter and a summing amplifier, as shown in 
the block diagram of Fig. 14.46(a). The circuit is designed such that the 
 lower cutoff frequency ω1 is set by the low-pass filter while the upper 
cutoff frequency ω2 is set by the high-pass filter. The gap between ω1 
and ω2 is the bandwidth of the filter. As shown in Fig. 14.46(b), the 
filter passes frequencies below ω1 and above ω2. The block diagram in 
Fig. 14.46(a) is actually constructed as shown in Fig. 14.47. The transfer

 Scaling
In designing and analyzing filters and resonant circuits or in circuit anal-
ysis in general, it is sometimes convenient to work with element values 
of 1 Ω, 1 H, or 1 F, and then transform the values to realistic values by 
Practice Problem 14.13
Design a notch filter based on Fig. 14.47 for ω0 = 20 krad/s, K = 5, and 
Q = 10. Use R = Ri = 10 kΩ.
Answer: C1 = 4.762 nF, C2 = 5.263 nF, and Rf = 50 kΩ.

scaling. We have taken advantage of this idea by not using realistic ele-
ment values in most of our examples and problems; mastering circuit 
analysis is made easy by using convenient component values. We have 
thus eased calculations, knowing that we could use scaling to then make 
the values realistic.
There are two ways of scaling a circuit: magnitude or impedance 
scaling, and frequency scaling. Both are useful in scaling responses  
and circuit elements to values within the practical ranges. While mag-
nitude scaling leaves the frequency response of a circuit unaltered, fre-
quency scaling shifts the frequency response up or down the frequency 
spectrum.
14.9.1  Magnitude Scaling
Magnitude scaling is the process of increasing all impedances in a net-
work by a factor, the frequency response remaining unchanged.
Recall that impedances of indi vidual elements R, L, and C are 
 given by
 
ZR = R,  
ZL = jωL,  
ZC =  1 
____ 
jωC  
(14.78)
In magnitude scaling, we multiply the impedance of each circuit element 
by a factor Km and let the frequency remain constant. This gives the new 
impedances as
Z′R = KmZR = KmR,  
Z′L = KmZL = jωKmL
 
Z′C = KmZC =  
1 
_______ 
jωC∕Km
  
(14.79)
Comparing Eq. (14.79) with Eq. (14.78), we notice the following chang-
es in the element values: R → KmR, L → KmL, and C → C∕Km. Thus, in 
magnitude scaling, the new values of the elements and  frequency are 
 
R′ = KmR,  
L′ = KmL
C′ =   
C
 
___ 
Km  ,  
ω′ = ω
 
(14.80)
The primed variables are the new values and the unprimed variables are 
the old values. Consider the series or parallel RLC circuit. We now have
 
ω′0 =  1

showing that the resonant frequency, as expected, has not changed. 
Similarly, the quality factor and the bandwidth are not affected by 
magnitude scaling. Also, magnitude scaling does not affect transfer 
functions in the forms of Eqs. (14.2a) and (14.2b), which are dimen -
sionless quantities.

14.9.2  Frequency Scaling
Frequency scaling is the process of shifting the frequency response of 
a network up or down the frequency axis while leaving the impedance 
the same.
We achieve frequency scaling by multiplying the frequency by a factor 
Kf while keeping the impedance the same.
From Eq. (14.78), we see that the impedances of 
L and C are 
 frequency-dependent. If we apply frequenc y scaling to ZL(ω) and ZC(ω) 
in Eq. (14.78), we obtain
 
ZL = j(ωKf)L′ = jωL  
⇒  
L′ =  L

j(ωKf)C′  =  1 
____

⇒  
C′ =  C 
__

(14.82b)
since the impedance of the inductor and capacitor must remain the same 
after frequency scaling. We notice the following changes in the element 
values: L → L∕Kf and C → C∕Kf. The value of R is not affected, since 
its impedance does not depend on frequency. Thus, in frequency scaling, 
the new values of the elements and frequency are
 
R′ = R,  
L′ =   
L
 
__
 
Kf  
C′ =   
C

Kf  ,  
ω′ = Kf ω

frequency

LC

(14.84)
and for the bandwidth
 
B′ = Kf B 
(14.85)
but the quality factor remains the same (Q′ = Q).
14.9.3  Magnitude and Frequency Scaling
If a circuit is scaled in magnitude and frequency at the same time, then
 
R′ = KmR,  
L′ =   
Km
 
___
 
Kf   L
C′ =

_____ 
KmKf  C,  
ω′ = Kf ω
   
(14.86)
These are more general formulas than those in Eqs. (14.80) and (14.83). 
We set Km = 1 in Eq. (14.86) when there is no magnitude scaling or 
 
Kf = 1 when there is no frequency scaling.
648 
Chapter 14
Frequency Response
Frequency scaling is equivalent to 
relabeling the frequency axis of a 
frequency response plot. It is needed 
when translating frequencies such as a 
resonant frequency, a corner  frequency, 
a bandwidth, etc., to a realistic level. It 
can be used to bring capacitance and 
inductance values into a range that is 
convenient to work with.

 Frequency Response Using PSpice
PSpice is a useful tool in the hands of the modern circuit designer for 
obtaining the frequency response of circuits. The frequency response is 
obtained using the AC Sweep as discussed in Section D.5 (Appendix D). 
This requires that we specify in the AC Sweep dialog box Total Pts, Start 
Freq, End Freq, and the sweep type. Total Pts is the number of points in 
the frequency sweep, and Start Freq and End Freq are, respectively, the 
starting and final frequencies, in hertz. In order to know what frequen-
cies to select for Start Freq and End Freq, one must have an idea of the 
frequency range of interest by making a rough sketch of the frequency 
response. In a complex circuit where this may not be possible, one may 
use a trial-and-error approach.
There are three types of sweeps:
Linear: The frequency is varied linearly from 
Start Freq  to End 
Freq with Total Pts equally spaced points (or responses).
Octave: The frequency is swept logarithmically by octaves from 
Start Freq to End Freq with Total Pts per octave. An octave is a 
factor of 2 (e.g., 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16).
Decade: The frequency is varied logarithmically by decades 
from Start Freq  to End Freq  with Total Pts  per decade. A 
decade is a factor of 10 (e.g., from 2 to 20 Hz, 20 to 200 Hz, 
200 Hz to 2 kHz).
It is best to use a linear sweep when displaying a narrow frequency range 
of interest, as a linear sweep displays the frequency range well in a nar -
row range. Conversely, it is best to use a logarithmic (octave or decade) 
sweep for displaying a wide frequency range of interest—if a linear 
sweep is used for a wide range, all the data will be crowded at the high- 
or low-frequency end and insufficient data at the other end.
With the abo ve specifications, PSpice performs a steady-state 
sinusoidal analysis of the circuit as the frequency of all the independent 
sources is varied (or swept) from Start Freq to End Freq.
The PSpice A/D program produces a graphical output. The output 
data type may be specified in the Trace Command Box by adding one of 
the following suffixes to V or I:
M  Amplitude of the sinusoid.
P  
Phase of the sinusoid.
dB   Amplitude of the sinusoid in decibels, that is, 20 log
10
 (amplitude).

it by selecting Analysis/Simulate. This will automatically bring up the

 Computation Using MATLAB
MATLAB is a software package that is widely used for engineering com-
putation and simulation. A review of MATLAB is provided in Appen -
dix E for the beginner. This section shows how to use the software to 
numerically perform most of the operations presented in this chapter and 
Chapter 15. The key to describing a system in MATLAB is to specify the 
numerator (num) and denominator (den) of the transfer function of the 
system. Once this is done, we can use several 
MATLAB commands to 
obtain the system’s Bode plots (frequency response) and the system’s 
response to a given input.
The command bode produces the Bode plots (both magnitude
 
and phase) of a given transfer function H(s). The format of the com -
mand is bode (num, den), where num is the numerator of 
H(s) and 
den is its denominator. The frequency range and number of points are  
 automatically selected. For example, consider the transfer function in 
 Example 14.3. It is better to first write the numerator and denominator 
in polynomial forms.
Practice Problem 14.16
Consider the network in Fig. 14.57. Use PSpice to obtain the Bode plots  
for Vo over a frequency from 1 to 100 kHz using 20 points per  decade.

Thus,
H(s) =  
200 jω 
_______________  
( jω + 2)( jω + 10)  =  
200s 
____________  
s2 + 12s + 20
  ,  
s = jω
Using the following commands, the Bode plots are generated as shown 
in Fig. 14.59. If necessary, the command logspace can be included to 
generate a logarithmically spaced frequency and the command semilogx 
can be used to produce a semilog scale.
>> num  = [200 0];  % specify the numerator of H(s)
>> den  = [1 12 20];  % specify the denominator of H(s)
>> bode(num, den);  % determine and draw Bode plots
The step response y(t) of a system is the output when the input x(t) is 
the unit step function. The command step plots the step response of a system 
given the numerator and denominator of the transfer function of that sys -
tem. The time range and number of points are automatically selected. F or 
example, consider a second-order system with the transfer function
H(s) =  
12 
___________ 
s2 + 3s + 12
  
We obtain the step response of the system shown in Fig. 14.60 by using 
the following commands.
>> n  = 12;
>> d  = [1 3 12];
>> step(n,d);
We can verify the plot in Fig. 14.60 by obtaining 
y(t) = x(t) * u(t) or  
Y(s) = X(s)H(s).

 Applications
Resonant circuits and filters are widely used, particularly in electron-
ics, power systems, and communications systems. For example, a Notch 
filter with a cutoff frequency at 60 Hz may be used to eliminate the  
60-Hz power line noise in various communications electronics. Filtering 
of signals in communications systems is necessary in order to select the 
desired signal from a host of others in the same range (as in the case of 
radio receivers discussed next) and also to minimize the effects of noise 
and interference on the desired signal. In this section, we consider one 
practical application of resonant circuits and two applications of filters. 
The focus of each application is not to understand the details of how each 
device works but to see how the circuits considered in this chapter are 
applied in the practical devices.
14.12.1  Radio Receiver
Series and parallel resonant circuits are commonly used in radio and TV  
receivers to tune in stations and to separate the audio signal from the
 
radio-frequency carrier wave. As an example, consider the block  diagram 

of an AM radio receiver shown in Fig. 14.62. Incoming amplitude-
modulated radio waves (thousands of them at different frequencies from 
different broadcasting stations) are received by the antenna. A resonant 
circuit (or a band-pass filter) is needed to select just one of the incom-
ing waves. The selected signal is very weak and is amplified in stages in 
order to generate an audible audio-frequency wave. Thus, we have the 
radiofrequency (RF) amplifier to amplify the selected broadcast signal, 
the intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier to amplify an internally gener-
ated signal based on the RF signal, and the audio amplifier to amplify the 
audio signal just before it reaches the loudspeaker. It is much easier to 
amplify the signal at three stages than to build an amplifier to provide the 
same amplification for the entire band.

Figure 14.62
A simplified block diagram of a superheterodyne AM radio receiver.
The type of AM receiver shown in Fig. 14.62 is known as the super-
heterodyne receiver. In the early de velopment of radio, each amplifica-
tion stage had to be tuned to the frequenc y of the incoming signal. This 
way, each stage must have several tuned circuits to cover the entire AM 
band (540 to 1600 kHz). To avoid the problem of having several resonant 
circuits, modern recei vers use a frequency mixer or heterodyne circuit, 
which always produces the same IF signal (445 kHz) but retains the audio 
frequencies carried on the incoming signal. To produce the constant IF  
frequency, the rotors of two separate variable capacitors are mechanically 
coupled with one another so that they can be rotated simultaneously with 
a single control; this is called ganged tuning. A local oscillator ganged 
with the RF amplifier produces an RF signal that is combined with the 
incoming wave by the frequenc y mixer to produce a n output signal that 
contains the sum and the difference frequencies of the two signals. For ex-
ample, if the resonant circuit is tuned to recei ve an 800-kHz incoming sig-
nal, the local oscillator must produce a 1,255-kHz signal, so that the sum 
(1,255 + 800 = 2,055 kHz) and the difference (1,255 – 800 = 455 kHz) 
of frequencies are a vailable at the output of the mix
er.  However, only 

14.12
Applications
657
the difference, 455 kHz, is used in practice. This is the only fre quency to 
which all the IF amplifier stages are tuned, regardless of the station dialed. 
The original audio signal (containing the “intelligence”) is e xtracted in 
the detector stage. The detector basically removes the IF signal, leaving 
the audio signal. The audio signal is amplified to drive the loudspeaker, 
which acts as a transducer converting the electrical signal to sound.
Our major concern here is the tuning circuit for the 
AM radio re -
ceiver. The operation of the FM radio recei ver is different from that of 
the AM receiver discussed here, and in a much dif ferent range of fre -
quencies, but the tuning is similar.

The resonant or tuner circuit of an AM radio is portrayed in Fig. 14.63. 
Given that L = 1 μH, what must be the range of C to have the resonant 
frequency adjustable from one end of the AM band to another?
Solution:
The frequency range for AM broadcasting is 540 to 1,600 kHz. We 
consider the low and high ends of the band. Since the resonant circuit 
in Fig. 14.63 is a parallel type, we apply the ideas in Section 14.6. From 
Eq. (14.44),

C is

______________________  
4π2 × 1,6002 × 106 × 10−6  = 9.9 nF
For the low end of the AM band,  f0 = 540 kHz, and the corresponding C is
C2 =  
1 
____________________  
4π2 × 5402 × 106 × 10−6  = 86.9 nF
Thus, C must be an adjustable (gang) capacitor varying from 9.9 to 
86.9 nF.
Practice Problem 14.17
For an FM radio receiver, the incoming wave is in the frequency range 
from 88 to 108 MHz. The tuner circuit is a parallel RLC circuit with a 
4-μH coil. Calculate the range of the variable capacitor necessary to 
cover the entire band.
Answer: From 0.543 to 0.818 pF.

14.12.2  Touch-Tone Telephone
A typical application of filtering is the touch-tone telephone set
 
shown in Fig. 14.64. The keypad has 12 buttons arranged in four rows
 
and three columns. The arrangement provides 12 distinct signals by 
using seven tones divided into two groups: the low- frequency group 
(697 to 941 Hz) and the high-frequency group (1,209 to 1,477 Hz). 
Pressing a button generates a sum of two sinusoids corresponding 
to  its unique pair of frequencies. For example, pressing the num-
ber 6 button generates sinusoidal tones with frequencies 770 and 
1,477 Hz.

Frequency assignments for touch-tone dialing.
When a caller dials a telephone number, a set of signals is trans-
mitted to the telephone of fice, where the touch-tone signals are de -
coded by detecting the frequencies they contain. Figure 14.65 shows 
the block diagram for the detection scheme. 
The signals are f irst 
amplified and separated into their respective groups by the low-pass 
(LP) and high-pass (HP) f ilters. The limiters (L) are used to con -
vert the separated tones into square waves. The individual tones are 
identified using seven band-pass (BP) filters, each filter passing one 
tone and rejecting other tones. Each f ilter is follow ed by a detec -
tor (D), which is energized when its input voltage exceeds a certain 
level. The outputs of the detectors pro vide the required dc signals  
needed by the switching system to connect the caller to the party 
being called.

14.12.3  Crossover Network
Another typical application of filters is the crossover network that cou-
ples an audio amplifier to woofer and tweeter speakers, as shown in 
Fig. 14.66(a). The network basically consists of one high-pass RC filter 

and one low-pass RL filter. It routes frequencies higher than a prescribed 
crossover frequency fc to the tweeter (high-frequency l oudspeaker) and 
frequencies below fc into the woofer (low- frequency loudspeaker). These 
loudspeakers have been designed to accommodate certain frequency 
 responses. A woofer is a low-  frequency loudspeaker designed to repro-
duce the lower part of the frequency range, up to about 3 kHz. A tweeter 
can reproduce audio frequencies from about 3 kHz to about 20 kHz. The 
two speaker types can be combined to reproduce the entire audio range 
of interest and provide the optimum in frequency response.
By replacing the amplifier with a voltage source, the approximate 
equivalent circuit of the crosso ver network is sho wn in Fig. 14.66(b), 
where the loudspeakers are modeled by resistors. As a high-pass filter, 
the transfer function V1∕Vs is given by
 
H1(ω) =  V1 
___ 
Vs
  =  jωR1C 
_________ 
1 + jωR1C  
(14.87)
Similarly, the transfer function of the low-pass filter is given by
 
H2(ω) =  V2 
___ 
Vs
  =  
R2 
________ 
R2 + jωL  
(14.88)
The values of R1, R2, L, and C may be selected such that the two  filters 
have the same cutoff frequency, known as the crossover frequency, as 
shown in Fig. 14.67.
The principle behind the crossover network is also used in the reso-
nant circuit for a TV receiver, where it is necessary to separate the video 
and audio bands of RF carrier frequencies. The lower-frequency band 
(picture information in the range from about 30 Hz to about 4 MHz) is 
channeled into the receiver’s video amplifier, while the high-frequency 
band (sound information around 4.5 MHz) is channeled to the receiver’s 
sound amplifier.

Summary

 Summary
1. The transfer function H(ω) is the ratio of the output response Y(ω) 
to the input excitation X(ω); that is, H(ω) = Y(ω)∕X(ω).
2. The frequency response is the variation of the transfer function with 
frequency.
3. Zeros of a transfer function H(s) are the values of s = jω that make 
H(s) = 0, while poles are the values of s that make H(s) → ∞.
4. The decibel is the unit of logarithmic gain. For a voltage or  current 
gain G, its decibel equivalent is GdB = 20 log10 G.
5. Bode plots are semilog plots of the magnitude and phase of the 
transfer function as it v
aries with frequenc y. The straight-line 
 approximations of H (in dB) and ϕ (in degrees) are constructed us-
ing the corner frequencies defined by the poles and zeros of H(ω).
6. The resonant frequency is that frequency at which the imaginary part 
of a transfer function vanishes. For series and parallel RLC circuits.
ω0 =  1 
____ 
 √ 
___ 
LC  
  
7. The half-power frequencies (ω1, ω2) are those frequencies at which 
the power dissipated is one-half of that dissipated at the resonant 
frequency. The geometric mean between the half-power frequencies 
is the resonant frequency, or
ω0 =  √ 
_____ 
ω1ω2  
8. The bandwidth is the frequenc
y band between half-po
wer 
 frequencies:
B = ω2 − ω1
9. The quality f actor is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance 
peak. It is the ratio of the resonant (angular) frequency to the band-
width,
Q =  ω0 
___ 
B  
10. A filter is a circuit designed to pass a band of frequencies and reject 
others. Passive filters are constructed with resistors, capacitors, and 
inductors. Active filters are constructed with resistors, capacitors, 
and an active device, usually an op amp.
11. Four common types of filters are low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and 
band-stop. A low-pass filter passes only signals whose frequencies are 
below the cutoff frequency ωc. A high-pass filter passes only signals 
whose frequencies are abo ve the cutof f frequency ωc. A band-pass 
filter passes only signals whose frequencies are within a prescribed

range (ω1 < ω < ω2). A band-stop filter passes only signals whose 
frequencies are outside a prescribed range (ω1 > ω > ω2).
12. Scaling is the process whereby unrealistic element v
alues are 
 magnitude-scaled by a factor Km and/or frequency-scaled by a fac-
tor Kf  to produce realistic values.
R′ = KmR,  
L′ =  Km

13. PSpice can be used to obtain the frequency response of a circuit if a 
frequency range for the response and the desired number of points 
within the range are specified in the AC Sweep.
14. The radio receiver—one practical application of resonant circuits—
employs a band-pass resonant circuit to tune in one frequenc
y 
among all the broadcast signals picked up by the antenna.
15. The touch-tone telephone and the crosso ver network are two typi-
cal applications of filters. The touch-tone telephone system employs 
filters to separate tones of different frequencies to activate electronic 
switches. The crossover network separates signals in dif ferent fre-
quency ranges so that they can be delivered to different devices such 
as tweeters and woofers in a loudspeaker system.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.h), “the broad education neces-
sary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in

As a student, you must mak
e sure you acquire “the broad education 
necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global 
and societal context.” To some extent, if you are already enrolled in an 
ABET-accredited engineering program, then some of the courses you 
are required to take must meet this criteria. My recommendation is that 
even if you are in such a program, you look at all the elective courses you 
take to make sure that you e xpand your awareness of global issues and 
societal concerns. The engineers of the future must fully understand that 
they and their activities affect all of us in one way or another.
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.i), “need for, and an ability to 
 engage in life-long learning.”
You must be fully aware of and recognize the “need for, and an ability 
to engage in life-long learning. ” It almost seems absurd that this need 
and ability must be stated. Yet, you w ould be surprised at ho w many 
engineers do not really understand this concept. The only way to be really 
able to keep up with the explosion in technology we are facing now and 
will be f acing in the future is through constant learning. This learning 
must include nontechnical issues as well as the latest technology in your 
field.
The best w ay to k eep up with the state of the art in your field is 
through your colleagues and association with indi
viduals you meet

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
15.1
Introduction
Our goal in this and the follo wing chapters is to develop techniques for 
analyzing circuits with a wide variety of inputs and responses. Such cir-
cuits are modeled by differential equations whose solutions describe the 
total response behavior of the circuits. Mathematical methods have been 
devised to systematically determine the solutions of dif
ferential equa-
tions. We now introduce the po werful method of Laplace transforma-
tion, which involves turning differential equations into algebraic equa-
tions, thus greatly facilitating the solution process.
The idea of transformation should be f amiliar by now. When  using 
phasors for the analysis of circuits, we transform the circuit from the time 
domain to the frequency or phasor domain. Once we obtain the phasor 
result, we transform it back to the time domain. The Laplace transform 
method follows the same process: We use the Laplace transformation 
to transform the circuit from the time domain to the frequenc y domain, 
obtain the solution, and apply the inverse Laplace transform to the result 
to transform it back to the time domain.
The Laplace transform is significant for a number of reasons. First, it 
can be applied to a wider variety of inputs than phasor analysis. Second,

Chapter 15
Introduction to the Laplace Transform
Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827), a French astronomer and mathe-
matician, first presented the transform that bears his name and its 
 applications to differential equations in 1779.
Born of humble origins in Beaumont-en-Auge, Normandy, France, 
Laplace became a professor of mathematics at the age of 20. His math -
ematical abilities inspired the f amous mathematician Simeon Poisson, 
who called Laplace the Isaac Newton of France. He made important con-

Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Understand the Laplace transform, its importance in circuit 
analysis, and how to determine the Laplace transform of func-
tions common to circuit analysis.
2. Understand the properties of the Laplace transform.
3. Understand the inverse Laplace transform and how to deter-
mine its given functions in the s-domain.
4. Understand the convolution integral and how to use it in the 
time domain and its equivalence in the s-domain.

it provides an easy way to solve circuit problems involving initial condi-
tions, because it allo ws us to w ork with algebraic equations instead of 
differential equations. Third, the Laplace transform is capable of provid-
ing us, in one single operation, the total response of the circuit compris-
ing both the natural and forced responses.
We begin with the definition of the Laplace transform which gives 
rise to its most essential properties. By e xamining these properties, we 
shall see ho w and wh y the method w orks. This also helps us to better 
appreciate the idea of mathematical transformations. We also consider 
some properties of the Laplace transform that are very helpful in  circuit 
analysis. We then consider the inverse Laplace transform, transfer func-
tions, and convolution. In this chapter, we will focus on the mechanics 
of the Laplace transformation. In Chapter 16 we will e xamine how the 
Laplace transform is applied in circuit analysis, netw ork stability, and 
network synthesis.
15.2
Definition of the Laplace Transform
Given a function f(t), its Laplace transform, denoted by F(s) or [  f(t)], 
is defined by
 
[  f(t)] = F(s) =   ∫ 0−  
∞
    f(t)e−st dt
 
(15.1)
where s is a complex variable given by
 
s = σ + jω 
(15.2)
Because the argument st of the exponent e in Eq. (15.1) must be dimen-
sionless, it follows that s has the dimensions of frequenc y and units of 
inverse seconds (s −1) or “frequenc y.” In Eq. (15.1), the lo wer limit is 
specified as 0− to indicate a time just before t = 0. We use 0− as the lower 
limit to include the origin and capture an y discontinuity of f(t) at t = 0; 
this will accommodate functions—such as singularity functions—that 
may be discontinuous at t = 0.
It should be noted that the integral in Eq. (15.1) is a definite integral 
with respect to time. Hence, the result of inte gration is indepen  dent of 
time and only involves the variable “s.”
Equation (15.1) illustrates the general concept of transformation. 
The function f(t) is transformed into the function 
F(s). Whereas the 
 former function involves t as its argument, the latter involves s. We say 
the transformation is from t-domain to s-domain. Given the interpre -
tation of s as frequenc y, we arri ve at the follo wing description of the 
 Laplace transform:
15.2
Definition of the Laplace Transform 
675
For an ordinary function f(t), the lower 
limit can be replaced by 0.
The Laplace transform is an integral transformation of a function f(t) from 
the time domain into the complex frequency domain, giving F(s).
When the Laplace transform is applied to circuit analysis, the dif-
ferential equations represent the circuit in the time domain. The terms in 
the differential equations take the place of f(t). Their Laplace transform, 
which corresponds to F(s), constitutes algebraic equations representing 
the circuit in the frequency domain.

We assume in Eq. (15.1) that f (t) is ignored for t < 0. To ensure that 
this is the case, a function is often multiplied by the unit step. Thus, f (t) 
is written as f (t)u(t) or f (t), t ≥ 0.
The Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1) is kno wn as the one-sided (or 
unilateral) Laplace transform. The two-sided (or bilateral) Laplace 
transform is given by
 
F(s) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  f(t)e−st dt 
(15.3)
The one-sided Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1), being adequate for our 
purposes, is the only type of Laplace transform that we will treat in 
this book.
A function f (t) may not ha ve a Laplace transform. F or f (t) to have 
a Laplace transform, the integral in Eq. (15.1) must converge to a finite 
value. Because |ejωt| = 1 for any value of t, the integral converges when
 
 ∫ 
0 
∞
  e−σt  ǀ f(t) ǀ dt < ∞ 
(15.4)
for some real v alue σ = σc. Thus, the re gion of con vergence for the 
 Laplace transform is Re(s) = σ > σc, as shown in Fig. 15.1. In this  region, 
|F(s)| < ∞ and F(s) exists. F(s) is undefined outside the region of conver-
gence. Fortunately, all functions of interest in circuit analysis satisfy the 
convergence criterion in Eq. (15.4) and have Laplace transforms. There-
fore, it is not necessary to specify σc in what follows.
A companion to the direct Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1) is the 
inverse Laplace transform given by
 
−1[F(s)] = f(t) =  1 
___ 
2πj   ∫ 
σ1− j∞  
 σ1+ j∞
  F(s)est ds 
(15.5)
where the integration is performed along a straight line (σ1 + jω, −∞ < 
ω < ∞) in the region of convergence, σ1 > σc. See Fig. 15.1. The direct  
application of Eq. (15.5) in
volves some kno wledge about comple x 
analysis beyond the scope of this book. F or this reason, we will not use 
Eq. (15.5) to find the inverse Laplace transform. We will rather use a 
look-up table, to be de veloped in Section 15.3. The functions f(t) and 
F(s) are regarded as a Laplace transform pair where
 
f(t)  
⇔  
F(s) 
(15.6)
meaning that there is one-to-one correspondence between f(t) and F(s). 
The following examples derive the Laplace transforms of some  important 
functions.

Practice Problem 15.2
Find the Laplace transform of f(t) = 15 cos(3t) using the e xponential 
representation for the cosine function.
Answer: 15s∕(s2 + 9).
15.3
Properties of the Laplace Transform
The properties of the Laplace transform help us to obtain transform pairs 
without directly using Eq. (15.1) as we did in Examples 15.1 and 15.2. 
As we derive each of these properties, we should keep in mind the defini-
tion of the Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1).
 
Practice Problem 15.1
Find the Laplace transforms of these functions: r(t) = tu(t), that is, the 
ramp function; Ae−at u(t); and Be−jωtu(t).
Answer: 1∕s2, A∕(s + a), B∕(s + jω).

Linearity
If F1(s) and F2(s) are, respectively, the Laplace transforms of f1(t) and 
f2(t), then
[a1 f1(t) + a2 f2(t)] = a1F1(s) + a2F2(s) 
(15.7)
where a1 and a2 are constants. Equation 15.7 e
xpresses the linearity 
property of the Laplace transform. The proof of Eq. (15.7) follows read-
ily from the definition of the Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1).
For example, by the linearity property in Eq. (15.7), we may write
[cos ωt u(t)] =  [  1 
__ 2  (ejωt + e−jωt) ] =  1 
__ 2  [ejωt] +  1 
__ 2  [e−jωt] 
(15.8)
But from Example 15.1(b), [e−at] = 1∕(s + a). Hence,
 
[cos ωt u(t)] =  1

(15.9)
Scaling
If F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t), then
 
[  f(at)] =  ∫ 
0− 
∞
  f(at)e−st dt 
(15.10)
where a is a constant and a > 0. If we let x = at, dx = a dt, then
[  f(at)] =   ∫ 
0−

  f (x) e−x(s∕a)  dx 
___ 
a  =  1 
__ a   ∫ 
0− 
∞
  f(x)e−x(s∕a)dx 
(15.11)
Comparing this inte gral with the definition of the Laplace transform 
in Eq. (15.1) shows that s in Eq. (15.1) must be replaced by s∕a while 
the dummy v ariable t is replaced by x. Hence, we obtain the scaling 
property as
 
[  f (at)] =

which may also be obtained from Eq. (15.13) by replacing ω with 2ω.
Time Shift
If F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t), then
 
[f (t − a)u(t − a)] =  ∫ 
0− 
∞
  f (t − a)u(t − a)e−st dt 
(15.15)
a ≥ 0

Chapter 15
Introduction to the Laplace Transform

But u(t − a) = 0 for t < a and u(t − a) = 1 for t > a. Hence,
[f(t − a)u(t − a)] =  ∫ 
a 
∞
  f(t − a)e−st dt 
(15.16)
If we let x = t − a, then dx = dt and t = x + a. As t → a, x → 0 and as  
t → ∞, x → ∞. Thus,
[  f(t − a)u(t − a)] =  ∫ 
0– 
∞
  f(x)e−s(x+a) dx
= e−as  ∫ 
0− 
∞
  f(x)e−sx dx = e−as F(s)
or
[  f (t − a)u(t − a)] = e−as F(s)
(15.17)
In other w ords, if a function is delayed in time by 
a, the result in the 
s-domain is found by multiplying the Laplace transform of the function 
(without the delay) by e−as. This is called the time-delay or time-shift 
property of the Laplace transform.
As an example, we know from Eq. (15.9) that
[cos ωt u(t)] =  
s 
_______ 
s2 + ω2  
Using the time-shift property in Eq. (15.17),
 
[cos ω(t − a)u(t − a)] = e−as

If F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t), then
[e−at f(t)u(t)] =  ∫

  e−at f(t)e−st dt
=  ∫ 
0 
∞
  f(t)e−(s+a)t dt = F(s + a)
or
 
[e−at f(t)u(t)] = F(s + a)
 
(15.19)
That is, the Laplace transform of 
e−at f(t) can be obtained from the 
 Laplace transform of f(t) by replacing every s with s + a. This is known 
as frequency shift or frequency translation.
As an example, we know that

(s + a)2 + ω2

or
 
[f ″(t)] = s2F(s) − sf (0−) − f ′(0−)

For example, we know from Example 15.1(b) that [e−at] = 1∕(s + a).

Note that if a = 0, we obtain [t] = 1∕s2 as in Eq. (15.29), and repeated 
applications of Eq. (15.33) will yield Eq. (15.31).
Time Periodicity
If function f(t) is a periodic function such as sho wn in Fig. 15.3, it can 
be represented as the sum of time-shifted functions sho wn in Fig. 15.4. 
Thus,
f(t) = f1(t) + f2(t) + f3(t) + ⋯
= f1(t) + f1(t − T)u(t − T) 
(15.36)
+ f1(t − 2T)u(t − 2T) + ⋯
where f1(t) is the same as the function 
f(t) g ated o ver the interv al  
0 < t < T, that is,
 
f1(t) = f(t)[u(t) − u(t − T)] 
(15.37a)

or
f1(t) =  {  f(t), 
   
0,  
 
   0 < t < T 
     
otherwise 
(15.37b)
We now transform each term in Eq. (15.36) and apply the time-shift 
property in Eq. (15.17). We obtain
F(s) = F1(s) + F1(s)e−Ts + F1(s)e−2Ts + F1(s)e−3Ts + ⋯
= F1(s)[1 + e−Ts + e−2Ts + e−3Ts + ⋯] 
(15.38)
But
 
1 + x + x2 + x3 + ⋯ =  1 
_____ 
1 − x  
(15.39)
if |x| < 1. Hence,
 
F(s) =   
F1(s) 
_______ 
1 − e−Ts  
(15.40)
where F1(s) is the Laplace transform of f1(t); in other words, F1(s) is the 
transform f(t) defined over its first period only. Equation (15.40) shows 
that the Laplace transform of a periodic function is the transform of the 
first period of the function divided by 1 − e−Ts.
Initial and Final Values
The initial-value and final-value properties allo w us to find the initial 
value f(0) and the final value f(∞) of f(t) directly from its Laplace trans-
form F(s). To obtain these properties, we be gin with the differentiation 
property in Eq. (15.23), namely,
 
sF(s) − f (0) =  [  df 
__ 
dt  ] =  ∫ 
0− 
∞
   df 
__ 
dt  e−st dt 
(15.41)
If we let s → ∞, the integrand in Eq. (15.41) vanishes due to the damping 
exponential factor, and Eq. (15.41) becomes
 lim  
s→∞ [sF(s) − f (0)] = 0
Because f (0) is independent of s, we can write
 
f(0) =   lim  
s→∞  sF(s)
 
(15.42)
This is known as the initial-value theorem. For example, we know from 
Eq. (15.21a) that
f (t) = e−2t cos 10t u(t)  
⇔  
F(s) =

(15.44)
This is referred to as the final-value theorem. In order for the final-value 
theorem to hold, all poles of F(s) must be located in the left half of the 
s plane (see Fig. 15.1 or 15.9); that is, the poles must have negative real 
parts. The only exception to this requirement is the case in which F(s) 
has a simple pole at s = 0, because the effect of 1∕s will be nullified by 
sF(s) in Eq. (15.44). For example, from Eq. (15.21b),
f (t) = e−2t sin 5t u(t)  
⇔

_____

  = 0
This is incorrect, because f(t) = sin t oscillates between +1 and −1 
and does not ha ve a limit as t → ∞. Thus, the final-value theorem 
cannot be used to find the final value of f(t) = sin t, because F(s) has 
poles at s = ±j, which are not in the left half of the s plane. In gen-
eral, the final-value theorem does not apply in finding the final values 
of sinusoidal functions—these functions oscillate forever and do not 
have final values.
The initial-value and final-value theorems depict the relationship 
 between the origin and infinity in the time domain and the s-domain. 
They serve as useful checks on Laplace transforms.
Table 15.1 provides a list of the properties of the Laplace trans -
form. The last property (on con
volution) will be pro ved in Sec -
tion 15.5. There are other properties, b ut these are enough for pres -
ent purposes. Table 15.2 summarizes the Laplace transforms of some 
common functions. We have omitted the f actor u(t) except where it  
is necessary.
We should mention that many software packages, such as Mathcad, 
MATLAB, Maple, and Mathematica, offer symbolic math. For example, 
Mathcad has symbolic math for the Laplace, F ourier, and Z transforms 
as well as the inverse function.

all have negative real parts: They are all located on the left half of the

Introduction to the Laplace Transform
15.4
 The Inverse Laplace Transform
Given F(s), how do we transform it back to the time domain and  obtain 
the corresponding f(t)? By matching entries in 
Table 15.2, we a void 
 using Eq. (15.5) to find f(t).
Suppose F(s) has the general form of
 
F(s) =  N(s) 
____ 
D(s)  
(15.47)
where N(s) is the numerator polynomial and 
D(s) is the denominator 
polynomial. The roots of N(s) = 0 are called the zeros of F(s), while the 
roots of D(s) = 0 are the poles of F(s). Although Eq. (15.47) is simi-
lar in form to Eq. (14.3), here F(s) is the Laplace transform of a func-
tion, which is not necessarily a transfer function. We use partial fraction 
 expansion to break F(s) down into simple terms whose inverse transform 
we obtain from Table 15.2. Thus, finding the inverse Laplace transform 
of F(s) involves two steps.
Software packages such as MATLAB, 
Mathcad, and Maple are capable of 
finding partial fraction expansions 
quite easily.
Let us consider the three possible forms F(s) may take and how to apply 
the two steps to each form.
15.4.1  Simple Poles
Recall from Chapter 14 that a simple pole is a first-order pole. If F(s) has 
only simple poles, then D(s) becomes a product of factors, so that
 
F(s) =  
N(s)  
______________________   
(s + p1)(s + p2) ⋯ (s + pn)  
(15.48)
where s = −p1, −p2, … , −pn are the simple poles, and pi ≠ pj for all 
i ≠ j (i.e., the poles are distinct). Assuming that the degree of N(s) is  
Otherwise, we must first apply long 
 division so that F(s) = N(s)∕D(s) =  
Q(s) + R(s)∕D(s), where the degree of 
R(s), the remainder of the long division, 
is less than the degree of D(s).
Practice Problem 15.7
Obtain the initial and the final values of
G(s) =  3s3 + 2s + 6  
_____________  
s(s + 1)2(s + 1.5)
  
Answer: 3, 4.
Steps to Find the Inverse Laplace Transform:
1. Decompose F(s) into simple terms using partial fraction 
expansion.
2. Find the inverse of each term by matching entries in Table 15.2.

less than the degree of D(s), we use partial fraction expansion to decom-
pose F(s) in Eq. (15.48) as
F(s) =  k1 
_____ 
s + p1  +  k2 
_____ 
s + p2  + ⋯ +  kn 
_____ 
s + pn  
(15.49)
The expansion coefficients k1, k2, … , kn are kno wn as the residues of 
F(s). There are man y ways of finding the expansion coefficients. One 
way is using the residue method. If we multiply both sides of Eq. (15.49) 
by (s + p1), we obtain
(s + p1)F(s) = k1 +  (s + p1)k2 
________ 
s + p2  + ⋯ +  (s + p1)kn 
________ 
s + pn  
(15.50)
Because pi ≠ pj, setting s = −p1 in Eq. (15.50) leaves only k1 on the right-
hand side of Eq. (15.50). Hence,
 
(s + p1)F(s)│s=−p1 = k1 
(15.51)
Thus, in general,
 
ki = (s + pi)F(s)│s=−pi
 
(15.52)
This is known as Heaviside’s theorem. Once the values of ki are known, 
we proceed to find the inverse of F(s) using Eq. (15.49). Since the inverse 
transform of each term in Eq. (15.49) is −1[k∕(s + a)] = ke−at u(t), then, 
from Table 15.2,
 
f(t) = (k1e−p1t + k2e−p2t + ⋯ + kne−pnt)u(t)
 
(15.53)
15.4.2  Repeated Poles
Suppose F(s) has n repeated poles at s = −p. Then we may represent 
F(s) as
F(s) = 
 kn 
_______ 
(s + p)n  +  
kn−1 
________ 
(s + p)n−1  + ⋯ +  
k2 
_______ 
(s + p)2  
+  k1 
_____ 
s + p  + F1(s) 
(15.54)
where F1(s) is the remaining part of F(s) that does not ha ve a pole at  
s = −p. We determine the expansion coefficient kn as
 
kn = (s + p)nF(s)│s=−p 
(15.55)
as we did above. To determine kn−1, we multiply each term in Eq. (15.54) 
by (s + p)n and differentiate to get rid of kn, then evaluate the result at  
s = −p to get rid of the other coefficients except kn−1. Thus, we obtain
 
kn−1 =  d 
__ 
ds  [(s + p)nF(s)]│s=−p 
(15.56)
Repeating this gives
 
kn−2 =  1

2!  t2e−pt

_______ 
(n − 1)!  tn−1e−pt)u(t) + f1(t)
 
(15.60)
15.4.3  Complex Poles
A pair of comple x poles is simple if it is not repeated; it is a double 
or multiple pole if repeated. Simple comple x poles may be handled the 
same way as simple real poles, but because complex algebra is involved 
the result is always cumbersome. An easier approach is a method known 
as completing the square. The idea is to express each complex pole pair 
(or quadratic term) in D(s) as a complete square such as (s + α)2 + β2 and 
then use Table 15.2 to find the inverse of the term.
Because N(s) and D(s) always have real coefficients and we know 
that the complex roots of polynomials with real coef ficients must occur 
in conjugate pairs, F(s) may have the general form
 
F(s) =  A1s + A2 
__________ 
s2 + as + b
  + F1(s) 
(15.61)
where F1(s) is the remaining part of F(s) that does not have this pair of 
complex poles. If we complete the square by letting
 
s2 + as + b = s2 + 2αs + α2 + β2 = (s + α)2 + β2 
(15.62)
and we also let
 
A1s + A2 = A1(s + α) + B1β 
(15.63)
then Eq. (15.61) becomes
 
F(s) =  A1(s + α) 
___________ 
(s + α)2 + β2  +  
B1β 
___________ 
(s + α)2 + β2  + F1(s) 
(15.64)
From Table 15.2, the inverse transform is
 
f(t) = (A1e−αt cos βt + B1e−αt sin βt)u(t) + f1(t)
 
(15.65)
The sine and cosine terms can be combined using Eq. (9.11).
Whether the pole is simple, repeated, or comple
x, a general 
 approach that can al ways be used in finding the expansion coefficients

Chapter 15
Introduction to the Laplace Transform

is the method of algebra, illustrated in Examples 15.9 to 15.11. To apply 
the method, we first set F(s) = N(s)∕D(s) equal to an expansion contain-
ing unknown constants. We multiply the result through by a common 
denominator. Then we determine the unkno wn constants by equating 
coefficients (i.e., by algebraically solving a set of simultaneous equations 
for these coefficients at like powers of s).
Another general approach is to substitute specific, convenient val-
ues of s to obtain as man y simultaneous equations as the number of 
unknown coefficients, and then solve for the unkno wn coefficients. We 
must make sure that each selected v alue of s is not one of the poles of 
F(s).  Example 15.11 illustrates this idea.

____________

Unlike in the pre vious example where the partial fractions ha ve been 
provided, we first need to determine the partial fractions. Given that  
there are three poles, we let
 
 
s2 + 12 
____________  
s(s + 2)(s + 3)  =  A 
__ s  +  B 
_____ 
s + 2  +  C 
_____

(15.9.1)
where A, B, and C are the constants to be determined. We can find the 
constants using two approaches.

■ METHOD 1  Residue method:
A = sF(s)│s=0 =  
s2 + 12 
____________  
(s + 2)(s + 3)   | 
s=0  
 
     =  12

_______ 
s(s + 2)  | 
s=−3  
 
     =  9 + 12 
________ 
(−3)(−1)  = 7
■ METHOD 2  Algebraic method:  Multiplying both sides of 
Eq. (15.9.1) by s(s + 2)(s + 3) gives
s2 + 12 = A(s + 2)(s + 3) + Bs(s + 3) + Cs(s + 2)
or
s2 + 12 = A(s2 + 5s + 6) + B(s2 + 3s) + C(s2 + 2s)
Equating the coefficients of like powers of s gives
Constant: 12 = 6A  
⇒  
A = 2
s:     
0 = 5A + 3B + 2C  
⇒  
3B + 2C = −10
s2:    
 1 = A + B + C  
⇒  
B + C = −1
Thus, A = 2, B = −8, C = 7, and Eq. (15.9.1) becomes
F(s) =  2 
__ s  −  8 
_____ 
s + 2  +  7 
_____ 
s + 3  
By finding the inverse transform of each term, we obtain

Although B and C can be obtained using the method of residue, we 
will not do so, to a

two specific values of s [say s = 0, 1, which are not poles of F(s)] into 
Eq. (15.11.1). This will give us two simultaneous equations from which

But A = 2, C = −10, so that Eq. (15.11.3) gives B = −2.
■ METHOD 2  Algebraic method:  Multiplying both sides of 
Eq. (15.11.1) by (s + 3)(s2 + 8s + 25) yields

It is alright to lea ve the result this w ay. However, we can combine the

(15.11.6)

The Convolution Integral

 The Convolution Integral
The term convolution means “folding.” Convolution is an invaluable tool 
to the engineer because it provides a means of viewing and characteriz-
ing physical systems. For example, it is used in finding the response y(t) 
of a system to an e xcitation x(t), knowing the system impulse response 
h(t). This is achieved through the convolution integral, defined as
 
y(t) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  x(λ)h(t − λ) dλ 
(15.66)
or simply
 
y(t) = x(t) * h(t) 
(15.67)
where λ is a dummy v
ariable and the asterisk denotes con
volution. 
Equation (15.66) or (15.67) states that the output is equal to the input 
 convolved with the unit impulse response. The convolution process is 
commutative:
 
y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = h(t) * x(t) 
(15.68a)
or
 
y(t) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  x(λ)h(t − λ) dλ =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  h(λ)x(t − λ) dλ 
(15.68b)
This implies that the order in which the tw o functions are convolved is 
immaterial. We will see shortly how to take advantage of this commuta-
tive property when performing graphical computation of the convolution 
integral.

Chapter 15
Introduction to the Laplace Transform
The convolution of two signals consists of time-reversing one of the sig-
nals, shifting it, and multiplying it point by point with the second  signal, 
and integrating the product.
The convolution integral in Eq. (15.66) is the general one; it applies 
to any linear system. However, the convolution integral can be simpli-
fied if we assume that a system has two properties. First, if x(t) = 0 for  
t < 0, then
 
y(t) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  x(λ)h(t − λ) dλ =  ∫ 
0 
∞
  x(λ)h(t − λ) dλ 
(15.69)
Second, if the system’s impulse response is causal (i.e., h(t) = 0 for t < 
0), then h(t − λ) = 0 for t − λ < 0 or λ > t, so that Eq. (15.69) becomes
 
y(t) = h(t) * x(t) =   ∫ 0  
t
    x(λ)h(t − λ)dλ
 
(15.70)
Here are some properties of the convolution integral.
1. x(t) * h(t) = h(t) * x(t) (Commutative)
2. f (t) * [x(t) + y(t)] = f (t) * x(t) + f (t) * y(t) (Distributive)
3. f (t) * [x(t) * y(t)] = [  f(t) * x(t)] * y(t) (Associative)
4. f (t) * δ(t) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  f (λ)δ(t − λ) dλ = f (t)
5. f (t) * δ(t − to) = f (t − to)
6. f (t) * δ′(t) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  f (λ)δ′(t − λ) dλ = f ′(t)
7. f (t) * u(t) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  f (λ)u(t − λ) dλ =  ∫ 
−∞  
t
  f (λ) dλ
Before learning ho
w to e
valuate the con
volution inte gral in 
Eq. (15.70), let us establish the link between the Laplace transform and 
the convolution integral. Given two functions f1(t) and f2(t) with Laplace 
transforms F1(s) and F2(s), respectively, their convolution is
 
f (t) = f1(t) * f2(t) =  ∫ 
0 
t
  f1(λ)f2(t − λ) dλ 
(15.71)
Taking the Laplace transform gives
 
F(s) = [  f1(t) * f2(t)] = F1(s)F2(s) 
(15.72)
To prove that Eq. (15.72) is true, we begin with the fact that F1(s) 
is defined as
 
F1(s) =  ∫ 
0− 
∞
  f1(λ)e−sλ dλ 
(15.73)
Multiplying this with F2(s) gives
 
F1(s)F2(s) =  ∫ 
0− 
∞
  f1(λ)[F2(s)e−sλ] dλ 
(15.74)

We recall from the time shift property in Eq. (15.17) that the term in 
brackets can be written as
F2(s)e−sλ = [ f2(t − λ)u(t − λ)]
 
=  ∫ 
0 
∞
  f2(t − λ)u(t − λ)e−st dt 
(15.75)
Substituting Eq. (15.75) into Eq. (15.74) gives
 
F1(s)F2(s) =  ∫ 
0 
∞
  f1(λ) [  ∫ 
0 
∞
  f2(t − λ)u(t − λ)e−st dt ] dλ 
(15.76)
Interchanging the order of integration results in
 
F1(s)F2(s) =  ∫ 
0 
∞
  [  ∫ 
0 
t
  f1(λ)f2(t − λ) dλ ] e−st dt
(15.77)
The integral in brackets extends only from 0 to t because the delayed 
unit step u(t − λ) = 1 for λ < t and u(t − λ) = 0 for λ > t. We notice that 
the integral is the convolution of f1(t) and f2(t) as in Eq. (15.71). Hence,
 
F1(s)F2(s) = [  f1(t) * f2(t)]
 
(15.78)
as desired. This indicates that convolution in the time domain is equiva-
lent to multiplication in the s-domain. For example, if x(t) = 4e−t and  
h(t) = 5e−2t, applying the property in Eq. (15.78), we get
h(t) * x(t) = 
−1[H(s)X(s)] = 
−1 [  ( 5 
_____ 
s + 2  ) ( 4 
_____ 
s + 1  ) ] 
= 
−1 [  20 
_____ 
s + 1  +  −20 
_____ 
s + 2  ] 
(15.79)
= 20(e−t − e−2t),  
t ≥ 0
Although we can find the convolution of tw
o signals using 
Eq. (15.78), as we have just done, if the product F1(s)F2(s) is very com-
plicated, finding the inverse may be tough. Also, there are situations in 
which f1(t) and f2(t) are available in the form of e xperimental data and 
there are no explicit Laplace transforms. In these cases, one must do the 
convolution in the time domain.
The process of convolving two signals in the time domain is better 
appreciated from a graphical point of view. The graphical procedure for 
evaluating the convolution integral in Eq. (15.70) usually in volves four 
steps.
15.5
The Convolution Integral
697
Steps to Evaluate the Convolution Integral:
1. Folding: Take the mirror image of h(λ) about the ordinate axis 
to obtain h(−λ).
2. Displacement: Shift or delay h(−λ) by t to obtain h(t − λ).
3. Multiplication: Find the product of h(t − λ) and x(λ).
4. Integration: F or a gi ven time t, calculate the area under the 
product h(t − λ)x(λ) for 0 < λ < t to get y(t) at t.

The folding operation in step 1 is the reason for the term convolution. 
The function h(t − λ) scans or slides over x(λ). In view of this superposi-
tion procedure, the convolution integral is also known as the superposi-
tion integral.
To apply the four steps, it is necessary to be able to sk etch x(λ) and 
h(t − λ). To get x(λ) from the original function x(t) involves merely re-
placing every t with λ. Sketching h(t − λ) is the k ey to the convolution 
process. It involves reflecting h(λ) about the vertical axis and shifting it 
by t. Analytically, we obtain h(t − λ) by replacing every t in h(t) by t − λ. 
Given that con volution is commutati ve, it may be more con venient to 
apply steps 1 and 2 to x(t) instead of h(t). The best way to illustrate the 
procedure is with some examples.

Example 15.12
Find the convolution of the two signals in Fig. 15.10.
Solution:
We follow the four steps to get y(t) = x1(t) * x2(t). First, we fold x1(t) as 
shown in Fig. 15.11(a) and shift it by t as shown in Fig. 15.11(b). F or 
different values of t, we now multiply the two functions and integrate to 
determine the area of the overlapping region.
 
For 0 < t < 1, there is no overlap of the two functions, as shown in 
Fig. 15.12(a). Hence,
 
y(t) = x1(t) * x2(t) = 0,  
0 < t < 1 
(15.12.1)
For 1 < t < 2, the tw o signals o verlap between 1 and t, as sho wn in 
Fig. 15.12(b).

    = 2(t − 1),

(15.12.2)
For 2 < t < 3, the two signals completely overlap between (t − 1) and t, 
as shown in Fig. 15.12(c). It is easy to see that the area under the curve 
is 2. Or
 
y(t) =  ∫

(15.12.3)

in Fig. 15.12(d).
y(t) =  ∫

(15.12.4)
For t > 4, the two signals do not overlap [Fig. 15.12(e)], and
 
y(t) = 0,  
t > 4 
(15.12.5)
Combining Eqs. (15.12.1) to (15.12.5), we obtain
y(t) =  
0,   
  0 ≤ t ≤ 1
2t − 2, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2
2,     2 ≤ t ≤ 3
8 − 2t, 3 ≤ t ≤ 4
0,   
t ≥ 4
  
(15.12.6)

which is sketched in Fig. 15.13. Notice that y(t) in this equation is con-
tinuous. This fact can be used to check the results as we move from one 
range of t to another. The result in Eq. (15.12.6) can be obtained without 
using the graphical procedure—by directly using Eq. (15.70) and the  
properties of step functions. This will be illustrated in Example 15.14.

function u(t), as in Fig. 15.18(a), and then shift it by t, as in Fig. 15.18(b).  
Because u(t) = 1 for t > 0, u(t − λ) = 1 for t − λ > 0 or λ < t, the two 
functions overlap from 0 to t, so that

Example 15.13
Graphically convolve g(t) and u(t) shown in Fig. 15.16.
Solution:
Let y(t) = g(t) * u(t). We can find y(t) in two ways.
■ METHOD 1  Suppose we fold g(t), as in Fig. 15.17(a), and shift it 
by t, as in Fig. 15.17(b). Since g(t) = t, 0 < t < 1 originally, we expect 
that g(t − λ) = t − λ, 0 < t − λ < 1 or t − 1 < λ < t. There is no overlap of 
the two functions when t < 0 so that y(0) = 0 for this case.

For t > 1, the tw o functions o verlap between 0 and 1, as sho
wn in 
Fig. 15.18(c). Hence,
y(t) =  ∫

__ 2  t2, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1

Although the two methods give the same result, as expected, notice 
that it is more convenient to fold the unit step function u(t) than fold g(t) 
in this example. Figure 15.19 shows y(t).

Example 15.14
For the RL circuit in Fig. 15.21(a), use the convolution integral to find the 
response io(t) due to the excitation shown in Fig. 15.21(b).
Solution:
1. Define. The problem is clearly stated and the method of solution is 
also specified.

2. Present. We are to use the con
volution inte gral to solv e for the 
response io(t) due to is(t) shown in Fig. 15.21(b).
3. Alternative. We have learned to do con volution by using the con -
volution integral and how to do it graphically. In addition, we could 
always work in the s-domain to solve for the current. We will solve 
for the current using the convolution integral and then check it using 
the graphical approach.
4. Attempt. As we stated, this problem can be solv
ed in tw o ways: 
directly using the con
volution inte gral or using the graphical 
technique. To use either approach, we first need the unit impulse 
 response h(t) of the circuit. In the s-domain, applying the current 
division principle to the circuit in Fig. 15.22(a) gives
Io =  1 
_____ 
s + 1  Is
Hence,
H(s) =  Io 
__ 
Is
  =  1 
_____ 
s + 1  
(15.14.1)
and the inverse Laplace transform of this gives
 
h(t) = e−t u(t) 
(15.14.2)
Figure 15.22(b) shows the impulse response h(t) of the circuit.
To use the convolution integral directly, recall that the response 
is given in the s-domain as
Io(s) = H(s)Is(s)
With the given is(t) in Fig. 15.21(b),
is(t) = u(t) − u(t − 2)
so that
io(t) = h(t) * is(t) =  ∫ 
0 
t
  is(λ)h(t − λ) dλ
=  ∫ 
0 
t
  [u(λ) − u(λ − 2)]e−(t−λ) dλ 
(15.14.3)
Since u(λ − 2) = 0 for 0 < λ < 2, the inte grand involving u(λ) is 
nonzero for all λ > 0, whereas the inte grand involving u(λ − 2) is 
nonzero only for λ > 2. The best way to handle the integral is to do 
the two parts separately. For 0 < t < 2,
i′o(t) =  ∫

(15.14.6)
5. Evaluate. To use the graphical technique, we may fold 
is(t) in  
Fig. 15.21(b) and shift by t, as shown in Fig. 15.23(a). For 0 < t < 2, 
the overlap between is(t − λ) and h(λ) is from 0 to t, so that
io(t) =  ∫

    = (1 − e−t)A,

(15.14.7)
For t > 2, the tw o functions o verlap between ( t − 2) and t, as in  
Fig. 15.23(b). Hence,
io(t) =  ∫

t−2  
t
    = −e−t + e−(t−2)
= (e2 − 1)e−t A,  
t ≥ 0 
(15.14.8)
From Eqs. (15.14.7) and (15.14.8), the response is
io(t) =   {  1 − e−t A,      0 ≤ t ≤ 2  
         
(e2 − 1)e−t A, t ≥ 2
 
 
 
  
(15.14.9)
which is the same as in Eq. (15.14.6). Thus, the response io(t) along 
the excitation is(t) is as shown in Fig. 15.24.
6. Satisfactory? We have satisfactorily solved the problem and can 
present the results as a solution to the problem.

  Application to Integrodifferential 
Equations
The Laplace transform is useful in solving linear inte
grodifferential 
equations. Using the differentiation and integration properties of Laplace 
transforms, each term in the integrodifferential equation is transformed. 
Practice Problem 15.14
Use convolution to find vo(t) in the circuit of Fig. 15.25(a) when the exci-
tation is the signal shown in Fig. 15.25(b). To show how powerful work-
ing in the s-domain is, verify your answer by performing the equivalent 
operation in the s-domain.
Answer: 20(e−t − e−2t)u(t) V.

Initial conditions are automatically taken into account. We solve the re-
sulting algebraic equation in the s-domain. We then con vert the solution 
back to the time domain by using the in verse transform. The following 
examples illustrate the process.

 Summary
1. The Laplace transform allows a signal represented by a function in 
the time domain to be analyzed in the 
s-domain (or comple x fre-
quency domain). It is defined as
[  f(t)] = F(s) =  ∫ 
0 
∞
  f(t)e−st dt
2. Properties of the Laplace transform are listed in Table 15.1, while 
the Laplace transforms of basic common functions are listed in 
 Table 15.2.
3. The inverse Laplace transform can be found using partial fraction 
expansions and using the Laplace transform pairs in Table 15.2 as a 
look-up table. Real poles lead to exponential functions and complex 
poles to damped sinusoids.
4. The convolution of tw o signals consists of time-re versing one of 
the signals, shifting it, multiplying it point by point with the second 
signal, and integrating the product. The convolution integral relates 
the convolution of two signals in the time domain to the in verse of 
the product of their Laplace transforms:
−1[F1(s)F2(s)] = f1(t) * f2(t) =  ∫ 
0 
t
  f1(λ)f2(t − λ) dλ
5. In the time domain, the output y(t) of the network is the convolution 
of the impulse response with the input x(t),
y(t) = h(t) * x(t)
Convolution may be re garded as the flip-shift-multiply-time-area 
method.
6. The Laplace transform can be used to solve a linear integrodiffer-
ential equation.

Communication skills are the most important skills any engineer can

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
Asking Questions
In more than 30 years of teaching, I ha ve struggled with determining ho w 
best to help students learn. Regardless of how much time students spend in 
studying for a course, the most helpful activity for students is learning how to 
ask questions in class and then asking those questions. The student, by asking 
questions, becomes actively involved in the learning process and no longer 
is merely a passive receptor of information. I think this acti ve involvement 
contributes so much to the learning process that it is probably the single most 
important aspect to the de velopment of a modern engineer . In fact, asking 
questions is the basis of science. As Charles P. Steinmetz rightly said, “No 
man really becomes a fool until he stops asking questions.”
It seems very straightforward and quite easy to ask questions. Have 
we not been doing that all our li ves? The truth is to ask questions in an 
appropriate manner and to maximize the learning process tak
es some 
thought and preparation.
I am sure that there are se
veral models one could ef
fectively use. 
Let me share what has w orked for me. The most important thing to k eep 
in mind is that you do not ha
ve to form a perfect question. Because the
 
question-and-answer format allows the question to be developed in an itera-
tive manner, the original question can easily be refined as you go. I  frequently 
tell students that they are most welcome to read their questions in class.
Here are three things you should keep in mind when asking questions. 
First, prepare your question. If you are lik e many students who are either 
shy or ha ve not learned to ask questions in class, you may wish to start 
with a question you ha ve written down outside of class. Second, w ait for 
an appropriate time to ask the question. Simply use your judgment on that. 
Third, be prepared to clarify your question by paraphrasing it or saying it in 
a different way in case you are asked to repeat the question.

Applications of the Laplace Transform
 
One last comment: Not all professors like students to ask questions 
in class even though they may say the y do. You need to find out which 
professors like classroom questions. Good luck in enhancing one of your 
most important skills as an engineer.
16.1
Introduction
Now that we have introduced the Laplace transform, let us see what we 
can do with it. Keep in mind that with the Laplace transform we actually 
have one of the most powerful mathematical tools for analysis, synthesis, 
and design. Being able to look at circuits and systems in the 
s-domain 
can help us to understand ho w our circuits and systems really function. 
In this chapter we will tak e an in-depth look at ho w easy it is to w ork 
with circuits in the s-domain. In addition, we will briefly look at physi-
cal systems. We are sure you have studied some mechanical systems and 
may have used the same differential equations to describe them as we use 
to describe our electric circuits. Actually that is a wonderful thing about 
the physical universe in which we li ve; the same dif ferential equations 
can be used to describe any linear circuit, system, or process. The key is 
the term linear.
A system is a mathematical model of a physical process relating the input 
to the output.
 
It is entirely appropriate to consider circuits as systems. Historically, 
circuits have been discussed as a separate topic from systems, so we will 
actually talk about circuits and systems in this chapter realizing that cir-
cuits are nothing more than a class of electrical systems.
 
The most important thing to remember is that everything we dis-
cussed in the last chapter and in this chapter applies to any linear system. 
In the last chapter, we saw how we can use Laplace transforms to solv e 
linear differential equations and integral equations. In this chapter, we in-
troduce the concept of modeling circuits in the s-domain. We can use that 
principle to help us solv e just about an y kind of linear circuit. W e will 
take a quick look at how state variables can be used to analyze systems 
with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Finally, we examine how the 
Laplace transform is used in netw ork stability analysis and in netw ork 
synthesis.
Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Understand and use effectively circuit element models in the 
s-domain.
2. Understand how to perform circuit analysis in the s-domain 
and how to transform the results back into the time domain.
3. Understand what a transfer function is and how it is used.
4. Understand state variables and how to apply and use them in 
circuit analysis.

16.2
Circuit Element Models
Having mastered how to obtain the Laplace transform and its inverse, we 
are now prepared to employ the Laplace transform to analyze circuits. 
This usually involves three steps.
Steps in Applying the Laplace Transform:
1. Transform the circuit from the time domain to the s-domain.
2. Solve the circuit using nodal analysis, mesh analysis, source 
transformation, superposition, or any circuit analysis technique 
with which we are familiar.
3. Take the inverse transform of the solution and thus obtain the 
solution in the time domain.
Only the first step is new and will be discussed here. As we did in phasor 
analysis, we transform a circuit in the time domain to the frequenc y or 
s-domain by Laplace transforming each term in the  circuit.
For a resistor, the voltage-current relationship in the time domain is
v(t) = Ri(t) 
(16.1)
Taking the Laplace transform, we get
V(s) = RI(s)
 
(16.2)
 
For an inductor,
 
v(t) = L  di(t) 
____ 
dt  
(16.3)
Taking the Laplace transform of both sides gives
 
V(s) = L[sI(s) − i(0−)] = sLI(s) − Li(0−) 
(16.4)
or
 
I(s) =

tion is modeled as a voltage or current source.
 
For a capacitor,

____ 
dt  
(16.6)
which transforms into the s-domain as
 
I(s) = C[sV(s) − v(0−)] = sCV(s) − Cv(0−)

or
 
V(s) =

Representation of an inductor: (a) time-
domain, (b,c) s-domain equivalents.

The s-domain equi valents are sho wn in Fig. 16.2. With the s-domain 
equivalents, the Laplace transform can be used readily to solv e first- and 
second-order circuits such as those we considered in Chapters 7 and 8. 
We should observe from Eqs. (16.3) to (16.8) that the initial conditions 
are part of the transformation. This is one advantage of using the  Laplace 
transform in circuit analysis. Another advantage is that a complete re -
sponse—transient and steady state—of a netw ork is obtained. We will 
illustrate this with Examples 16.2 and 16.3. Also, observe the duality of 
Eqs. (16.5) and (16.8), confirming what we already know from Chapter 8 
(see Table 8.1), namely, that L and C, I(s) and V(s), and v(0) and i(0) are 
dual pairs.
If we assume zero initial conditions for the inductor and the capaci-
tor, the above equations reduce to:
Resistor: 
V(s) = RI(s) 
Inductor: 
V(s) = sLI(s) 
(16.9)
Capacitor: 
V(s) =  1 
___ 
sC  I(s) 
The s-domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.3.
 
We define the impedance in the s-domain as the ratio of the voltage 
transform to the current transform under zero initial conditions; that is,
 
Z(s) =  V(s) 
____ 
I(s)  
(16.10)
Thus, the impedances of the three circuit elements are
Resistor: 
Z(s) = R 
Inductor: 
Z(s) = sL 
(16.11)
Capacitor: 
Z(s) =  1 
___

Table 16.1 summarizes these. The admittance in the s-domain is the 
 reciprocal of the impedance, or
 
Y(s) =  1 
____ 
Z(s)  =  I(s) 
____ 
V(s)  
(16.12)
The use of the Laplace transform in circuit analysis f
acilitates the use 
of various signal sources such as impulse, step, ramp, e xponential, and 
sinusoidal.
 
The models for dependent sources and op amps are easy to develop 
drawing from the simple fact that if the Laplace transform of f(t) is F(s),

Chapter 16
Applications of the Laplace Transform
The elegance of using the Laplace 
transform in circuit analysis lies in the 
automatic inclusion of the initial 
conditions in the transformation 
process, thus providing a complete 
(transient and steady-state) solution.

then the Laplace transform of af(t) is aF(s)—the linearity property. The 
dependent source model is a little easier in that we deal with a single 
value. The dependent source can have only two controlling values, a con-
stant times either a voltage or a current. Thus,
[av(t)] = aV(s) 
(16.13)
 
[ai(t)] = aI(s) 
(16.14)
 
The ideal op amp can be treated just lik e a resistor. Nothing  within 
an op amp, either real or ideal, does an
ything more than multiply a 
 voltage by a constant. Thus, we only need to write the equations as we 
always do using the constraint that the input voltage to the op amp has to 
be zero and the input current has to be zero.

 Circuit Analysis
Circuit analysis is again relatively easy to do when we are in the s-domain. 
We merely need to transform a complicated set of mathematical relation-
ships in the time domain into the s-domain where we convert operators 
(derivatives and integrals) into simple multipliers of s and 1∕s. This now 
allows us to use algebra to set up and solv e our circuit equations. The 
exciting thing about this is that all of the circuit theorems and relation -
ships we developed for dc circuits are perfectly valid in the s-domain.
Remember, equivalent circuits, with capacitors and inductors, only 
exist in the s-domain; they cannot be transformed back into the time 
domain.
Example 16.4
Consider the circuit in Fig. 16.12(a). Find the value of the voltage across 
the capacitor assuming that the value of vs(t) = 10u(t) V and assume that 
at t = 0, −1 A flows through the inductor and +5  V is across the capacitor.
Solution:
Figure 16.12(b) represents the entire circuit in the 
s-domain with the 
initial conditions incorporated. We now have a straightforward nodal 
analysis problem. Because the value of V1 is also the value of the capaci-
tor voltage in the time domain and is the only unknown node voltage, we 
only need to write one equation.

For the circuit shown in Fig. 16.12 with the same initial conditions, find

Example 16.5
For the circuit sho wn in Fig. 16.12, and the initial conditions used
 
in Example 16.4, use superposition to find the value of the capacitor  
voltage.
Solution:
Inasmuch as the circuit in the s-domain actually has three independent 
sources, we can look at the solution one source at a time. Figure 16.13 
presents the circuits in the s-domain considering one source at a time. 
We now have three nodal analysis problems. First, let us solve for the 
capacitor voltage in the circuit shown in Fig. 16.13(a).

or

Because there is no initial energy stored in the circuit, we assume that

 resistor and then find Voc (VTh) and Isc. To find VTh, we use the Laplace-

Transfer Functions
The transfer function is a key concept in signal processing because it 
indicates how a signal is processed as it passes through a network. It is a 
fitting tool for finding the network response, determining (or designing 
for) network stability, and network synthesis. The transfer function of a 
network describes how the output behaves with respect to the input. It 
specifies the transfer from the input to the output in the s-domain, assum-
ing no initial energy.
The transfer function H(s) is the ratio of the output response Y(s) to the 
input excitation X(s), assuming all initial conditions are zero.
Thus,
H(s) =   
Y(s)
 
____ 
X(s)  
 
(16.15)
The transfer function depends on what we define as input and output. 
Because the input and output can be either current or voltage at any place 
in the circuit, there are four possible transfer functions:
H(s) = Voltage gain =  Vo(s) 
_____ 
Vi(s)  
(16.16a)
 
H(s) = Current gain =  Io(s) 
____ 
Ii(s)  
(16.16b)
 
H(s) = Impedance =  V(s) 
____ 
I(s)  
(16.16c)
 
H(s) = Admittance =  I(s) 
____ 
V(s)  
(16.16d)
Thus, a circuit can ha
ve man y transfer functions. Note that 
H(s) is 
 dimensionless in Eqs. (16.16a) and (16.16b).
 
Each of the transfer functions in Eq. (16.16) can be found in two 
ways. One w ay is to assume any  convenient input X(s), use any  cir-
cuit analysis technique (such as current or v oltage division, nodal or 
mesh analysis) to find the output Y(s), and then obtain the ratio of the 
two. The other approach is to apply the ladder method, which involves 
walking our way through the circuit. By this approach, we assume that 
the output is 1 V or 1 A as appropriate and use the basic laws of Ohm 
and Kirchhoff (KCL only) to obtain the input. The transfer function 
becomes unity divided by the input. This approach may be more con-
venient to use when the circuit has many loops or nodes so that apply-
ing nodal or mesh analysis becomes cumbersome. In the first method, 
we assume an input and find the output; in the second method, we 
 assume the output and find the input. In both methods, we calculate  
H(s) as the ratio of output to input transforms. The two methods rely 
on the linearity property, since we only deal with linear circuits in this 
book. Example 16.8 illustrates these methods.
724 
Chapter 16
Applications of the Laplace Transform
For electrical networks, the transfer 
function is also known as the network 
function.
Some authors would not consider 
Eqs. (16.16c) and (16.16d) transfer 
functions.

Equation (16.15) assumes that both X(s) and Y(s) are known. Some-
times, we know the input X(s) and the transfer function H(s). We find the 
output Y(s) as
Y(s) = H(s)X(s) 
(16.17)
and take the inverse transform to get y(t). A special case is when the input 
is the unit impulse function, x(t) = δ(t), so that X(s) = 1. For this case,
Y(s) = H(s)  
or  
y(t) = h(t) 
(16.18)
where
h(t) = 
−1[H(s)] 
(16.19)
The term h(t) represents the unit impulse response—it is the time-domain 
response of the netw ork to a unit impulse. Thus, Eq. (16.19) pro vides a 
new interpretation for the transfer function: H(s) is the Laplace transform 
of the unit impulse response of the netw ork. Once we kno w the impulse 
response h(t) of a network, we can obtain the response of the netw ork to 
any input signal using Eq. (16.17) in the s-domain or using the convolution 
integral (section 15.5) in the time domain.
16.4
Transfer Functions

 The unit impulse response is the output 
response of a circuit when the input is 
a unit impulse.
Example 16.7
The output of a linear system is y(t) = 10e−t cos 4t u(t) when the input 
is x(t) = e−tu(t). Find the transfer function of the system and its impulse 
response.
Solution:
If x(t) = e−tu(t) and y(t) = 10e−tcos 4t u(t), then
X(s) =  1 
_____

State Variables
Thus far in this book we have considered techniques for analyzing systems 
with only one input and only one output. Man y engineering systems have 
many inputs and many outputs, as shown in Fig. 16.21. The state variable 
method is a v ery important tool in analyzing systems and understanding 
such highly complex systems. Thus, the state variable model is more gen-
eral than the single-input, single-output model, such as a transfer function. 
Although the topic cannot be adequately co vered in one chapter, let alone 
one section of a chapter, we will cover it briefly at this point.

Rework Example 16.9 for the circuit shown in Fig. 16.20.
Answer: (a) 2∕(s + 4), (b) 2e−4tu(t), (c)  1 _ 
2  (1 − e−4t)u(t) V,  
(d) 3.2(−e−4t + cos 2t +  1 _ 
2  sin 2t)u(t) V.

In the state variable model, we specify a collection of variables that 
describe the internal behavior of the system. These variables are known 
as the state variables of the system. They are the variables that determine 
the future behavior of a system when the present state of the system and 
the input signals are kno wn. In other w ords, they are those v ariables 
which, if known, allow all other system parameters to be determined by 
using only algebraic equations.
A state variable is a physical property that characterizes the state of a 
system, regardless of how the system got to that state.
Common examples of state variables are the pressure, volume, and 
temperature. In an electric circuit, the state v
ariables are the inductor 
current and capacitor voltage since they collectively describe the energy 
state of the system.
The standard way to represent the state equations is to arrange them 
as a set of first-order differential equations:
x· = Ax + Bz 
(16.20)
where
x·(t) =  
 [ 
x1(t)
x2(t)
⫶
xn(t)  ] 
 = state vector representing n state vectors
and the dot represents the first derivative with respect to time, i.e.,
x·(t) =  
 [ 
x.
1(t)
x.
2(t)
⫶
x.
n(t)  ] 
 
and
z(t) = 
 
⎡
 
⎢
 ⎣
z1(t)
z2(t)
⫶
zm(t)
⎤
 
⎥
 ⎦ 
 = input vector representing m inputs
A and B are respectively n × n and n × m matrices. In addition to the state 
equation in Eq. (16.20), we need the output equation. The complete state 
model or state space is
 
x. = Ax + Bz 
(16.21a)
 
y = Cx + Dz 
(16.21b)
where
y(t) = 
 
⎡
 
⎢

⫶
yp(t)
⎤
 
⎥
 ⎦ 
 = the output vector representing p outputs
16.5
State Variables
729

and C and D are, respectively, p × n and p × m matrices. For the  special 
case of single-input single-output, n = m = p = 1.
 
Assuming zero initial conditions, the transfer function of the system 
is found by taking the Laplace transform of Eq. (16.21a); we obtain
sX(s) = AX(s) + BZ(s)  
 →   
(sI − A)X(s) = BZ(s)
or
 
X(s) = (sI − A)−1BZ(s) 
(16.22)
where I is the identity matrix. 
Taking the Laplace transform of 
Eq. (16.21b) yields
 
Y(s) = CX(s) + DZ(s) 
(16.23)
Substituting Eq. (16.22) into Eq. (16.23) and di viding by Z(s) gives the 
transfer function as
 
H(s) =  Y(s) 
____ 
Z(s)  = C(sI − A)−1B + D 
(16.24)
where
 
A = system matrix
 
B = input coupling matrix
 
C = output matrix
 
D = feedforward matrix
In most cases, D = 0, so the degree of the numerator of H(s) in Eq. (16.24) 
is less than that of the denominator. Thus,
 
H(s) = C(sI − A)−1B
 
(16.25)
Because of the matrix computation in volved, MATLAB can be used to 
find the transfer function.
 
To apply state variable analysis to a circuit, we follow the following 
three steps.
730 
Chapter 16
Applications of the Laplace Transform
 
Steps 1 and 3 are usually straightforward; the major task is in step 2. 
We will illustrate this with examples.
Steps to Apply the State Variable Method to  
Circuit Analysis:
 1.  Select the inductor current i and capacitor voltage v as the state 
variables, making sure they are consistent with the passive sign 
convention.
 2. Apply KCL and KVL to the circuit and obtain circuit variables 
(voltages and currents) in terms of the state v
ariables. This 
should lead to a set of first-order differential equations neces-
sary and sufficient to determine all state variables.
 3. Obtain the output equation and put the final result in state-space 
representation.

In this case, we have one input vs and one output ix. In the next example, 
we will have two inputs and two outputs.

First, we select the state variables. Let x1 = y(t), therefore

Now let
 
x2 = x.

(16.12.3)
Note that at this time we are looking at a second-order system that would 
normally have two first-order terms in the solution.
 
Now we have x.

Eq. (16.12.1), i.e.,
  
x.

 Applications
So far we have considered three applications of Laplace’s transform: cir-
cuit analysis in general, obtaining transfer functions, and solving linear 
integrodifferential equations. The Laplace transform also finds applica-
tion in other areas in circuit analysis, signal processing, and control sys-
tems. Here we will consider tw o more important applications: netw ork 
stability and network synthesis.
16.6.1  Network Stability
A circuit is stable if its impulse response h(t) is bounded (i.e., h(t) con-
verges to a finite value) as t → ∞; it is unstable if h(t) grows without 
bound as t → ∞. In mathematical terms, a circuit is stable when
 
 lim  
t→∞  ∣h(t)∣ = finite 
(16.26)
Because the transfer function 
H(s) is the Laplace transform of the 
 impulse response h(t), H(s) must meet certain requirements for Eq. (16.26) 
to hold. Recall that H(s) may be written as
 
H(s) =  N(s) 
____ 
D(s)  
(16.27)
where the roots of N(s) = 0 are called the zeros of H(s) because the y 
make H(s) = 0, while the roots of D(s) = 0 are called the poles of H(s) 
since they cause H(s) → ∞. The zeros and poles of H(s) are often located 
in the s plane as sho wn in Fig. 16.26(a). Recall from Eqs. (15.47) 
and 
(15.48) that H(s) may also be written in terms of its poles as
 
H(s) =  N(s) 
____ 
D(s)  =  
N(s)  
_____________________  
(s + p1)(s + p2) ⋯ (s + pn)  
(16.28)
H(s) must meet tw o requirements for the circuit to be stable. First, the 
degree of N(s) must be less than the degree of D(s); otherwise, long divi-
sion would produce
 
H(s) = knsn + kn−1sn−1 + ⋯ + k1s + k0 +  R(s) 
____ 
D(s)  
(16.29)
where the de gree of R(s), the remainder of the long di vision, is less  
than the degree of D(s). The inverse of H(s) in Eq. (16.29) does not 
meet the condition in Eq. (16.26). Second, all the poles of 
H(s) in

Develop a set of state variable equations that represent the following 
differential equation.

C = [1 0 0].

Eq. (16.27) (i.e., all the roots of D(s) = 0) must have negative real parts; 
in other words, all the poles must lie in the left half of the s plane, as 
shown typically in Fig. 16.26(b). The reason for this will be apparent if 
we take the inverse Laplace transform of H(s) in Eq. (16.27). Because 
Eq. (16.27) is similar to Eq. (15.48), its partial fraction expansion is 
similar to the one in Eq. (15.49) so that the inverse of H(s) is similar to 
that in Eq. (15.53). Hence,
h(t) = (k1e−p1t + k2e−p2t + ⋯ + kne−pnt)u(t) 
(16.30)
We see from this equation that each pole pi must be positive (i.e., pole 
s = −pi in the left-half plane) for e−pit to decrease with increasing t. Thus,
A circuit is stable when all the poles of its transfer function H(s) lie in the 
left half of the s plane.
 
An unstable circuit never reaches steady state because the transient 
response does not decay to zero. Consequently , steady-state analysis is 
only applicable to stable circuits.
 
A circuit made up exclusively of passive elements (R, L, and C) and 
independent sources cannot be unstable, because that w ould imply that 
some branch currents or v oltages would grow indefinitely with sources 
set to zero. Passive elements cannot generate such indefinite growth. Pas-
sive circuits either are stable or have poles with zero real parts. To show 
that this is the case, consider the series RLC circuit in Fig. 16.27. The 
transfer function is given by
H(s) =  Vo 
___ 
Vs
  =  
1∕sC 
_____________  
R + sL + 1∕sC  
or
 
H(s) =  
1∕L 
________________  
s2 + sR∕L + 1∕LC
  
(16.31)
Notice that D(s) = s2 + sR∕L + 1∕LC = 0 is the same as the characteristic 
equation obtained for the series RLC circuit in Eq. (8.8). The circuit has 
poles at
 
p1,2 = −α ±  √ 
_______ 
α2 −  ω 0 
2  
(16.32)
where
α =  R 
___ 
2L  ,  
ω0 =  1 
___ 
LC  
For R, L, C > 0, the tw o poles always lie in the left half of the s plane, 
implying that the circuit is al ways stable. However, when R = 0, α = 0 
and the circuit becomes unstable. Although ideally this is possible, it 
does not really happen, because R is never zero.
 
On the other hand, active circuits or passive circuits with controlled 
sources can supply energy, and they can be unstable. In fact, an oscilla-
tor is a typical example of a circuit designed to be unstable. An oscilla-
tor is designed such that its transfer function is of the form
 
H(s) =  N(s)

s2 +  ω 0

Answer: β > −1∕R.

______________

For what values of k is the filter stable?

Solution:
As a second-order circuit, H(s) may be written as
H(s) =  
N(s) 
__________ 
s2 + bs + c
  
where b = 4 − k, c = 1, and N(s) = k. This has poles at p2 + bp + c = 0; 
that is,
p1,2 =  −b ±  √ 
_______ 
b2 − 4c    
____________ 
2 
 
For the circuit to be stable, the poles must be located in the left half of the 
s plane. This implies that b > 0.
 
Applying this to the given H(s) means that for the circuit to be 
 stable, 4 − k > 0 or k < 4.

16.6.2  Network Synthesis
Network synthesis may be regarded as the process of obtaining an appro-
priate network to represent a given transfer function. Network synthesis 
is easier in the s-domain than in the time domain.
 
In network analysis, we find the transfer function of a given net-
work. In netw ork synthesis, we re verse the approach: Gi ven a transfer 
function, we are required to find a suitable network.
Network synthesis is finding a network that represents a given transfer 
function.
 
Keep in mind that in synthesis, there may be man
y dif ferent 
 answers—or possibly no answers—because there are many circuits that 
can be used to represent the same transfer function; in network analysis, 
there is only one answer.
 
Network synthesis is an exciting field of prime engineering 
 importance. Being able to look at a transfer function and come up 
with the type of circuit it represents is a great asset to a circuit de
-
signer. Although network synthesis constitutes a whole course by itself 
and  requires some e xperience, the follo wing examples are meant to 
 stim ulate your appetite.

realize the function using the circuit in Fig. 16.30(a). (a) Select R = 5 Ω, 
and find L and C. (b) Select R = 1 Ω, and find L and C.
Solution:
1. Define. The problem is clearly and completely defined. This 
 problem is what we call a synthesis problem: Given a transfer func-
tion, synthesize a circuit that produces the given transfer  function. 
However, to keep the problem more manageable, we give a circuit 
that produces the desired transfer function.
 
Had one of the variables, R in this case, not been given a value, 
then the problem would have had an infinite number of answers. 
An open-ended problem of this kind would require some additional 
 assumptions that would have narrowed the set of solutions.
2. Present. A transfer function of the voltage out versus the voltage 
in is equal to 10∕(s2 + 3s + 10). A circuit, Fig. 16.30, is also given 
that should be able to produce the required transfer function. Two 
 different values of R, 5 and 1 Ω, are to be used to calculate the values 
of L and C that produce the given transfer function.
3. Alternative. All solution paths involve determining the transfer 
function of Fig. 16.30 and then matching the various terms of the 
transfer function. Two approaches would be to use mesh analysis 
or nodal analysis. Because we are looking for a ratio of voltages, 
nodal analysis makes the most sense.
4. Attempt. Using nodal analysis leads to
 Vo(s) − Vi(s) 
___________ 
sL 
 +  Vo(s) − 0 
________ 
1∕(sC)  +  Vo(s) − 0 
________ 
R 
 = 0
Now multiply through by sLR:
RVo(s) − RVi(s) + s2RLCVo(s) + sLVo(s) = 0
Collecting terms we get
(s2RLC + sL + R)Vo(s) = RVi(s)
or
 Vo(s) 
_____ 
Vi(s)  =  
1∕(LC)  
_____________________  
s2 + [1∕(RC)]s + 1∕(LC)
  Matching the two transfer functions produces two equations with 
three unknowns.

L =  0.1 
___ 
C  
and
RC =  1 
__ 3   
or

We have a constraint equation, R = 5 Ω for (a) and = 1 Ω for (b).
(a) C = 1∕(3 × 5) = 66.67 mF and L = 1.5 H
(b) C = 1∕(3 × 1) = 333.3 mF and L = 300 mH

5. Evaluate. There are different ways of checking the answer. Solv-
ing for the transfer function by using mesh analysis seems the most 
straightforward and the approach we could use here. However, it 
should be pointed out that this is mathematically more complex 
and will take longer than the original nodal analysis approach. 
Other approaches also exist. We can assume an input for vi(t),  
vi(t) = u(t) V and, using either nodal analysis or mesh analysis, see 
if we get the same answer we would get with just using the transfer 
 function. That is the approach we will try using mesh analysis.
 
Let vi(t) = u(t) V or Vi(s) = 1∕s. This will produce
Vo(s) = 10∕(s3 + 3s2 + 10s)
Based on Fig. 16.30, mesh analysis leads to
 
(a) For loop 1,
−(1∕s) + 1.5sI1 + [1∕(0.06667s)] (I1 − I2) = 0
or
(1.5s2 + 15)I1 − 15I2 = 1
For loop 2,
(15∕s)(I2 − I1) + 5I2 = 0
or
−15I1 + (5s + 15)I2 = 0  
or  
I1 = (0.3333s + 1)I2
Substituting into the first equation we get
(0.5s3 + 1.5s2 + 5s + 15)I2 − 15I2 = 1
or
I2 = 2∕(s3 + 3s2 + 10s)
but
Vo(s) = 5I2 = 10∕(s3 + 3s2 + 10s)
and the answer checks.
(b) For loop 1,
−(1∕s) + 0.3sI1 + [1∕(0.3333s)] (I1 − I2) = 0
or
(0.3s2 + 3)I1 − 3I2 = 1
For loop 2,
(3∕s)(I2 − I1) + I2 = 0
or
−3I1 + (s + 3)I2 = 0  
or  
I1 = (0.3333s + 1)I2
Substituting into the first equation we get
(0.09999s3 + 0.3s2 + s + 3)I2 − 3I2 = 1
or
I2 = 10∕(s3 + 3s2 + 10s)

but Vo(s) = 1 × I2 = 10∕(s3 + 3s2 + 10s)

6. Satisfactory? We have clearly identified values of L and C for 
each of the conditions. In addition, we have carefully checked the

3. Using the Laplace transform to analyze a circuit results in a com
-
plete (both transient and steady state) response because the initial 
conditions are incorporated in the transformation process.
4. The transfer function H(s) of a network is the Laplace transform of 
the impulse response h(t).
5. In the s-domain, the transfer function H(s) relates the output response 
Y(s) and an input excitation X(s); that is, H(s) = Y(s)∕X(s).
6. The state v ariable model is a useful tool for analyzing comple
x 
 systems with several inputs and outputs. State variable analysis is 
a powerful technique that is most popularly used in circuit theory 
and control. The state of a system is the smallest set of quanti
-
ties (known as state v ariables) that we must kno w to determine  
its future response to an y given input. The state equation in state  
variable form is 
x. = Ax + Bz
 
while the output equation is
y = Cx + Dz
7. For an electric circuit, we first select capacitor voltages and inductor 
current as state v ariables. We then apply KCL and KVL to obtain 
the state equations.
8. Two other areas of applications of the Laplace transform co
vered 
in this chapter are circuit stability and synthesis. A circuit is stable 
when all the poles of its transfer function lie in the left half of the s 
plane. Network synthesis is the process of obtaining an appropriate 
network to represent a given transfer function for which analysis in 
the s-domain is well suited.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.j), “a knowledge of contemporary 
issues.”
Engineers must have knowledge of contemporary issues. To have a truly 
meaningful career in the twenty-first century, you must have knowledge 
of contemporary issues, especially those that may directly af
fect your 
job and/or work. One of the easiest ways to achieve this is to read a lot—
newspapers, magazines, and contemporary books. As a student enrolled 
in an ABET-accredited program, some of the courses you take will be 
directed toward meeting this criteria.
ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.k), “an ability to use the 
techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary 
for engineering practice.”
The successful engineer must ha ve the “ability to use the techniques, 
skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.” 
Clearly, a major focus of this te xtbook is to do just that. Learning to 
use skillfully the tools that facilitate your working in a modern “knowl-
edge capturing integrated design environment” (KCIDE) is fundamental 
to your performance as an engineer . The ability to w ork in a modern 
KCIDE environment requires a thorough understanding of the tools 
associated with that environment. 
The successful engineer , therefore, must k eep abreast of the ne w 
design, analysis, and simulation tools. 
That engineer must also use
 
those tools until he or she is comfortable with using them. 
The engi-
neer also must make sure software results are consistent with real-world 
actualities. It is probably in this area that most engineers have the great-
est difficulty. Thus, successful use of these tools requires constant learn-
ing and relearning the fundamentals of the area in which the engineer 
is working.

 Introduction
We have spent a considerable amount of time on the analysis of circuits  
with sinusoidal sources. This chapter is concerned with a means of ana -
lyzing circuits with periodic, nonsinusoidal e
xcitations. The notion of  
periodic functions was introduced in Chapter 9; it w as mentioned there  
that the sinusoid is the most simple and useful periodic function. 
This 
chapter introduces the F ourier series, a technique for e xpressing a peri -
odic function in terms of sinusoids. Once the source function is expressed 
in terms of sinusoids, we can apply the phasor method to analyze circuits.
The F ourier series is named after Jean Baptiste Joseph F
ourier 
(1768–1830). In 1822, F ourier’s genius came up with the insight that 
any practical periodic function can be represented as a sum of sinusoids. 
Such a representation, along with the superposition theorem, allo ws us 
to find the response of circuits to arbitrary periodic inputs using phasor 
techniques.
758 
Chapter 17
The Fourier Series
Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830), a French mathemati -
cian, first presented the series and transform that bear his name.  Fourier’s 
results were  not en thusiastically received by the scientific world. He  
could not even get his work published as a paper.
Born in Auxerre, France, Fourier was orphaned at age 8. He attended a 
local military college run by Benedictine monks, where he  demonstrated 
great proficiency in mathematics. Like most of his contemporaries, 
 Fourier was swept into the politics of the French Revolution. He played 
an important role in Napoleon’s expeditions to Egypt in the later 1790s. 
Due to his political involvement, he narrowly escaped death twice.

Learning Objectives
By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be 
able to:
1. Understand the trigonometric Fourier series and know how  
to determine the Fourier series with a variety of periodic  
functions.
2. Effectively use the Fourier series to analyze the response of 
circuits to a variety of periodic sources.
3. Know how the symmetrical characteristics of some wave 
shapes can make determining the Fourier series of classes of 
periodic functions easier to determine.
4. Understand how to determine average power and rms values 
associated with periodic functions.
5. Understand the use of the discrete Fourier transform and the 
fast Fourier transform.

The harmonic angular frequency ωn is 
an  integer multiple of the fundamental 
angular frequency ω0, i.e., ωn = nω0.
We begin with the trigonometric Fourier series. Later we consider 
the exponential Fourier series. We then apply F ourier series in circuit 
analysis. Finally, practical applications of Fourier series in spectrum ana-
lyzers and filters are demonstrated.
17.2
 Trigonometric Fourier Series
While studying heat flow, Fourier discovered that a nonsinusoidal peri-
odic function can be expressed as an infinite sum of sinusoidal functions. 
Recall that a periodic function is one that repeats every 
T seconds. In 
other words, a periodic function f (t) satisfies
f (t) = f(t + nT)
 
(17.1)
where n is an integer and T is the period of the function.
According to the Fourier theorem, any practical periodic function 
of angular frequenc y ω0 can be e xpressed as an infinite sum of sine 
or cosine functions that are inte gral multiples of ω0. Thus, f(t) can be 
expressed as
 
f(t) = a0 + a1 cos ω0t + b1 sin ω0t + a2 cos 2ω0t
  
+ b2 sin 2ω0t + a3cos 3ω0t + b3 sin 3ω0t + ⋯  
(17.2)
or
 
f(t) = a0 +   ∑ 
n=1  
∞
    (an cos nω0t + bn sin nω0t)
 
dc 
   
ac
 
(17.3)
where ω0 = 2π∕T is called the fundamental angular frequency in radians 
per second. The sinusoid sin nω0t or cos nω0t is called the nth harmonic 
of f(t); it is an odd harmonic if n is odd and an even harmonic if n is even. 
Equation 17.3 is called the trigonometric Fourier series of f(t). The con-
stants an and bn are the Fourier coefficients. The coefficient a0 is the dc 
component or the average value of f(t). (Recall that sinusoids have zero 
average values.) The coefficients an and bn (for n ≠ 0) are the amplitudes 
of the sinusoids in the ac component. Thus,
The Fourier series of a periodic function f (t) is a representation that  
resolves f (t) into a dc component and an ac component comprising an 
infinite series of harmonic sinusoids.
A function that can be represented by a Fourier series as in Eq. (17.3) 
must meet certain requirements, because the infinite series in Eq. (17.3) 
may or may not converge. These conditions on f(t) to yield a convergent 
Fourier series are as follows:
1. f(t) is single-valued everywhere.
2. f(t) has a finite number of finite discontinuities in any one period.
3. f(t) has a finite number of maxima and minima in any one period.
4. The integral  ∫ 
t0 
t0+T
  ∣ f(t)∣ dt < ∞ for any t0.
17.2
Trigonometric Fourier Series
759

These conditions are called Dirichlet conditions. Although they are not 
necessary conditions, they are sufficient conditions for a Fourier series 
to exist.
A major task in Fourier series is the determination of the Fourier 
coefficients a0, an, and bn. The process of determining the coefficients 
is called Fourier analysis. The following trigonometric integrals are 
very helpful in Fourier analysis. For any integers m and n,
 
 ∫

  sin nω0t dt = 0 
(17.4a)
 
 ∫

  cos nω0t dt = 0

(17.4g)
Let us use these identities to evaluate the Fourier coefficients.
We begin by finding a0. We integrate both sides of Eq. (17.3) o ver 
one period and obtain
 
 ∫ 
0 
T
  f(t) dt =  ∫ 
0 
T
  [a0 +  ∑

(17.5)
Invoking the identities of Eqs. (17.4a) and (17.4b), the tw
o inte grals 
 involving the ac terms vanish. Hence,
 ∫

Chapter 17
The Fourier Series
A software package like Mathcad or 
Maple can be used to evaluate the 
Fourier coefficients.
Historical note: Although Fourier 
 published his theorem in 1822, it was 
P. G. L. Dirichlet (1805–1859) who later 
supplied an acceptable proof of the 
theorem.

To evaluate an, we multiply both sides of Eq. (17.3) by cos mω0t and 
integrate over one period:
 ∫ 
0 
T
  f(t) cos mω0t dt
=  ∫ 
0 
T
  [a0 +  ∑ 
n=1  
∞
  (an cos nω0t + bn sin nω0t)] cos mω0t dt
=  ∫ 
0 
T
  a0 cos mω0t dt +  ∑ 
n=1  
∞
   [ ∫ 
0 
T
  an cos nω0t cos mω0t dt 
 +  ∫ 
0 
T
  bn sin nω0t cos mω0t dt] dt 
(17.7)
The inte gral containing a0 is zero in vie w of Eq. (17.4b), while the 
integral containing bn vanishes according to Eq. (17.4c). The integral  
containing an will be zero e xcept when m = n, in which case it is T∕2, 
according to Eqs. (17.4e) and (17.4g). Thus,
 ∫ 
0 
T
   f(t) cos mω0t dt = an   T 
__ 
2  ,  
for m = n
or
 
an =   
2
 
__
 
T     ∫ 0  
T
    f(t) cos nω0t dt
 
(17.8)
In a similar vein, we obtain bn by multiplying both sides of Eq. (17.3) 
by sin mω0t and integrating over the period. The result is
 
bn =   
2
 
__
 
T     ∫ 0  
T
    f(t) sin nω0t dt
(17.9)
Be aware that because f(t) is periodic, it may be more convenient to carry 
the integrations above from −T∕2 to T∕2 or generally from t0 to t0 + T 
instead of 0 to T. The result will be the same.
An alternative form of Eq. (17.3) is the amplitude-phase form
 
f (t) = a0 +   ∑ 
n=1  
∞
    An cos(nω0t + 𝜙n)
(17.10)
We can use Eqs. (9.11) and (9.12) to relate Eq. (17.3) to Eq. (17.10), or 
we can apply the trigonometric identity
cos(𝛼 + 𝛽) = cos 𝛼cos𝛽 − sin𝛼sin𝛽 
(17.11)
to the ac terms in Eq. (17.10) so that
a0 +  ∑ 
n=1

The frequency spectrum of a signal consists of the plots of the ampli-
tudes and phases of the harmonics versus frequency.
Determine the Fourier series of the waveform shown in Fig. 17.1. Obtain 
the amplitude and phase spectra.

To avoid any confusion in determining 𝜙n, it may be better to relate the 
terms in complex form as
 
An⧸ 𝜙n = an − jbn 
(17.14)
The convenience of this relationship will become evident in Section 17.6. 
The plot of the amplitude An of the harmonics v ersus nω0 is called the  
amplitude spectrum of f(t); the plot of the phase 
𝜙n v ersus nω0 is 
the phase spectrum of f(t). Both the amplitude and phase spectra form 
the frequency spectrum of f(t).

Chapter 17
The Fourier Series
Thus, the F ourier analysis is also a mathematical tool for finding the 
spectrum of a periodic signal. Section 17.6 will elaborate more on the 
spectrum of a signal.
To evaluate the Fourier coefficients a0, an, and bn, we often need to 
apply the following integrals:
 
 ∫ 
  
 
  cos at dt =  1 
__ a  sin at 
(17.15a)
 
 ∫ 
  
 
  sin at dt = − 1

 ∫ 
  
 
  t sin at dt =  1 
__ 
a2  sin at −  1 
__ a  t cos at 
(17.15d)
It is also useful to kno w the v alues of the cosine, sine, and e xponen-
tial functions for integral multiples of π. These are given in Table 17.1, 
where n is an integer.
The frequency spectrum is also known 
as the line spectrum in view of the 
 discrete frequency components.

Our goal is to obtain the Fourier coefficients a0, an, and bn using 
Eqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). First, we describe the waveform as
 
f(t) =   {

0,   0 < t < 1

By summing the terms one by one as demonstrated in Fig. 17.2, 
we notice how superposition of the terms can evolve into the original 
square. As more and more F ourier components are added, the sum gets 
closer and closer to the square wave. However, it is not possible in prac-
tice to sum the series in Eq. (17.1.6) or (17.1.7) to infinity. Only a partial 
sum (n = 1, 2, 3, … , N, where N is finite) is possible. If we plot the  
partial sum (or truncated series) o ver one period for a lar ge N as in

Fig. 17.3, we notice that the partial sum oscillates abo ve and below the 
actual value of f(t). At the neighborhood of the points of discontinuity 
(x = 0, 1, 2, …), there is o vershoot and damped oscillation. In f act, an 
overshoot of about 9 percent of the peak value is always present, regard-
less of the number of terms used to approximate f(t). This is called the 
Gibbs phenomenon.
Finally, let us obtain the amplitude and phase spectra for the signal

 Symmetry Considerations
We noticed that the Fourier series of Example 17.1 consisted only of the 
sine terms. One may w onder if a method e xists whereby one can kno w 
in advance that some F ourier coefficients would be zero and a void the 
unnecessary work involved in the tedious process of calculating them. 
Such a method does e xist; it is based on recognizing the e
xistence of 
symmetry. Here we discuss three types of symmetry: (1) even symmetry, 
(2) odd symmetry, (3) half-wave symmetry.
17.3.1  Even Symmetry
A function f(t) is even if its plot is symmetrical about the vertical axis; 
that is,
 
f (t) = f (−t)

Examples of e ven functions are t2, t4, and cos t. Figure 17.10 sho ws 
more e xamples of periodic e ven functions. Note that each of these 
 examples satisfies Eq. (17.16). A main property of an e
ven function  
fe(t) is that:
 
 ∫ 
−T∕2  
T∕2
  fe(t) dt = 2 ∫ 
0 
T/2
  fe(t) dt 
(17.17)
because integrating from −T∕2 to 0 is the same as integrating from 0 to 
T∕2. Utilizing this property, the Fourier coefficients for an even function 
become
 
a0 =   
2
 
__
 
T     ∫ 0

__
 
T     ∫ 0

(17.18)
Because bn = 0, Eq. (17.3) becomes a Fourier cosine series. This makes 
sense because the cosine function is itself e ven. It also mak es intuitive 
sense that an e ven function contains no sine terms gi ven that the sine 
function is odd.
To confirm Eq. (17.18) quantitatively, we apply the property of an even 
function in Eq. (17.17) in evaluating the Fourier coefficients in Eqs. (17.6), 
(17.8), and (17.9). It is convenient in each case to integrate over the interval 
−T∕2 < t < T∕2, which is symmetrical about the origin. Thus,

We change variables for the inte gral over the interval −T∕2 < t < 0 by 
letting t = −x, so that dt = −dx, f(t) = f(−t) = f(x), since f(t) is an even 
function, and when t = −T∕2, x = T∕2. Then,

Examples of odd functions are

It is interesting to note that an y periodic function f(t) with neither 
even nor odd symmetry may be decomposed into e
ven and odd parts. 
Using the properties of even and odd functions from Eqs. (17.16) and 
(17.26), we can write
f(t) =  1

the property of an odd function in Eq. (17.26). The fact that fe(t) con-

fo(t) has only the  
sine terms, can be e xploited in grouping the F ourier series expansion 
of f(t) as

Also, note the following properties of odd and even functions:
1. The product of two even functions is also an even function.
2. The product of two odd functions is an even function.
3. The product of an e ven function and an odd function is an odd 
function.
4. The sum (or dif ference) of two even functions is also an even 
function.
5. The sum (or difference) of two odd functions is an odd function.
6. The sum (or difference) of an even function and an odd function is 
neither even nor odd.
Each of these properties can be proved using Eqs. (17.16) and (17.26).

A function is half-wave (odd) symmetric if
f  (t −  T 
__ 
2  ) = −f (t)
 
(17.32)
which means that each half-c ycle is the mirror image of the ne xt half-
cycle. Notice that functions cos nω0t and sin nω0t satisfy Eq. (17.32) for 
odd values of n and therefore possess half-wave symmetry when n is 
odd. Figure 17.12 sho ws other examples of half-wave symmetric func-
tions. The functions in Figs. 17.11(a) and 17.11(b) are also half-w
ave 
symmetric. Notice that for each function, one half-c ycle is the inverted 
version of the adjacent half-cycle. The Fourier coefficients become

when t = 0, x = T∕2. Also, we k eep Eq. (17.32) in mind; that is,

 Circuit Applications
We find that in practice, many circuits are driven by nonsinusoidal peri-
odic functions. To find the steady-state response of a circuit to a nonsinu-
soidal periodic excitation requires the application of a Fourier series, ac 
phasor analysis, and the superposition principle. The procedure usually 
involves four steps.
Steps for Applying Fourier Series:
1. Express the excitation as a Fourier series.
2. Transform the circuit from the time domain to the frequenc
y 
domain.
3. Find the response of the dc and ac components in the Fourier 
series.
4. Add the individual dc and ac responses using the superposition 
principle.
The first step is to determine the Fourier series e xpansion of the 
excitation. For the periodic v oltage source sho wn in Fig. 17.18(a), for 
example, the Fourier series is expressed as
 
v(t) = V0 +  ∑ 
n=1  
∞
  Vn cos(nω0t + θn) 
(17.40)
(The same could be done for a periodic current source.) Equation (17.40) 
shows that v(t) consists of tw o parts: the dc component V0 and the ac 
component Vn = Vn⧸ θn with several harmonics. This Fourier series rep-
resentation may be re garded as a set of series-connected sinusoidal
 
sources, with each source ha ving its own amplitude and frequency, as 
shown in Fig. 17.18(b).
The third step is finding the response to each term in the Fourier 
series. The response to the dc component can be determined in the

in the time domain by replacing all inductors with short circuits and 
all capacitors with open circuits. The response to the ac component is 
obtained by applying the phasor techniques co
vered in Chapter 9, as 
shown in Fig. 17.19(b). The network is represented by its impedance 
Z(nω0) or admittance Y(nω0). Z(nω0) is the input impedance at the 
source when ω is everywhere replaced by nω0, and Y(nω0) is the recip-
rocal of Z(nω0).
Finally, following the principle of superposition, we add all the indi-
vidual responses. For the case shown in Fig. 17.19,

Figure 17.21 shows the amplitude spectrum for output v oltage 
vo(t), while that of the input voltage vs(t) is in Fig. 17.4(a). Notice that the 
two spectra are close. Why? We observe that the circuit in Fig. 17.20  
is a high-pass filter with the corner frequency ωc = R∕L = 2.5 rad/s, 
which is less than the fundamental frequency ω0 = π  rad/s. The dc 
component is not passed and the first harmonic is slightly attenuated,  
but higher harmonics are passed. In fa
ct, from Eqs. (17.6.1) and 
(17.6.2), Vo is identical to Vs for large n, which is characteristic of a  
high-pass filter.

But by Euler’s identity,

This is obtained by applying L’Hopital’s rule to Eq. (17.68). For an inte-
gral multiple of π, the value of the sinc function is zero,
 
sinc(nπ) = 0,  
n = 1, 2, 3, ...

Also, the sinc function shows even symmetry. With all this in mind, we

10, where n = ω∕ω0 is the normalized frequency. Figure 17.29 shows 
the plot of θn versus n. Both the amplitude spectrum and phase spec -
trum are called line spectra, because the v alues of ∣cn∣ and θn occur 
only at discrete v alues of frequencies. The spacing between the lines  
is ω0. The power spectrum, which is the plot of ∣cn∣2 versus nω0, can 
also be plotted. Notice that the sinc function forms the envelope of the 
amplitude spectrum.

 Fourier Analysis with PSpice
Fourier analysis is usually performed with PSpice in conjunction with 
transient analysis. Therefore, we must do a transient analysis to perform 
a Fourier analysis.
To perform the F ourier analysis of a w aveform, we need a circuit 
whose input is the waveform and whose output is the Fourier decompo-
sition. A suitable circuit is a current (or v oltage) source in series with a 
1-Ω resistor as sho wn in Fig. 17.33. The waveform is inputted as vs(t) 
using VPULSE for a pulse or VSIN for a sinusoid, and the attri butes of 
the waveform are set over its period T. The output V(1) from node 1 is the 
dc level (a0) and the first nine harmonics (An) with their corresponding 
phases ψn; that is,
 
vo(t) = a0 +  ∑ 
n=1

Notice in Eq. (17.74) that the PSpice output is in the sine and angle form 
rather than the cosine and angle form in Eq. (17.10). The PSpice output 
also includes the normalized F ourier coefficients. Each coefficient an is 
normalized by di viding it by the magnitude of the fundamental 
a1, so 
that the normalized component is an∕a1. The corresponding phase ψn is 
normalized by subtracting from it the phase ψ1 of the fundamental, so 
that the normalized phase is ψn − ψ1.

program and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) performed by the PSpice 
A/D program. While DFT is an approximation of the exponential Fourier 
series, FTT is an algorithm for rapid ef ficient numerical computation of 
DFT. A full discussion of DFT and FTT is beyond the scope of this book.
17.7.1  Discrete Fourier Transform
A discrete F ourier transform (DFT) is performed by the 
PSpice pro-
gram, which tab ulates the harmonics in an output file. To enable a  
Fourier analysis, we select Analysis/Setup/Transient and bring up the 
Transient dialog box, shown in Fig. 17.34. The Print Step should be a  
small fraction of the period T, while the Final Time could be 6T. The 
Center Frequency is the fundamental frequenc y f0 = 1∕T. The particu-
lar variable whose DFT is desired, V(1) in Fig. 17.34, is entered in the  
Output Vars command box. In addition to filling in the Transient dia-
log box, DCLICK Enable Fourier. With the Fourier analysis enabled 
and the schematic sa ved, run PSpice by selecting Analysis/ Simulate 
as usual. The program executes a harmonic decomposition into  Fourier 
components of the result of the transient analysis. The results are sent  
to an  output file which can be retrieved by selecting Analysis/ Examine 
 Output. The output file includes the dc value and the first nine  harmonics 
by default, although you can specify more in the Number of harmonics 
box (see Fig. 17.34).
17.7.2  Fast Fourier Transform
A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed by the PSpice A/D  program 
and displays as a PSpice A /D plot the complete spectrum of a t
ran-
sient expression. As explained above, we first construct the schematic in 
Fig. 17.33(b) and enter the attrib utes of the waveform. We also need to 
enter the Print Step and the Final Time in the Transient dialog box. Once 
this is done, we can obtain the FFT of the waveform in two ways.
One way is to insert a v oltage marker at node 1 in the schematic 
of the circuit in Fig. 17.33(b). After saving the schematic and select-
ing Analysis/Simulate, the w aveform V(1) will be displayed in the 
PSpice A /D window. Double clicking the FFT icon in the PSpice A /D 
menu will automatically replace the w aveform with its FFT . From the 
FFT- generated graph, we can obtain the harmonics. In case the FFT
-
generated graph is crowded, we can use the User Defined data range (see 
Fig. 17.35) to specify a smaller range.

The Fourier Series
Figure 17.35

Use PSpice to determine the Fourier coefficients of the signal in Fig. 17.1.
Solution:
Figure 17.36 shows the schematic for obtaining the Fourier coefficients. 
With the signal in Fig. 17.1 in mind, we enter the attributes of the volt -
age source VPULSE as shown in Fig. 17.36. We will solve this example 
using both the DFT and FFT approaches.
■ METHOD 1  DFT Approach: (The voltage marker in Fig. 17.36 
is not needed for this method.) From Fig. 17.1, it is evident that T = 2 s,
f0 =  1 
__ 
T  =  1 
__ 2  = 0.5 Hz
So, in the transient dialog box, we select the Final Time as 6T = 12 s, 
the Print Step as 0.01 s, the Step Ceiling as 10 ms, the Center Frequency 
as 0.5 Hz, and the output variable as V(1). (In fact, Fig. 17.34 is for this 
particular example.) When PSpice is run, the output file contains the fol-
lowing result:

TF=1u
TR=1u
PW=1
PER=2

‒
Figure 17.36
Schematic for Example 17.12.
Another way of obtaining the FFT of V(1) is to not insert a volt-
age marker at node 1 in the schematic. After selecting Analysis/ 
Simulate, the PSpice A /D window will come up with no graph on it. 
We select Trace/Add and type V(1) in the Trace Command box and 
DCLICKL OK. We now select Plot/X-Axis Settings to bring up the 
X-Axis Setting dialog box shown in Fig. 17.35 and then select Fourier/
OK. This will cause the FFT of the selected trace (or traces) to be dis -
played. This second approach is useful for obtaining the FFT of any trace 
associated with the circuit.
A major advantage of the FFT method is that it pro vides graphical 
output. But its major disadvantage is that some of the harmonics may be 
too small to see.
In both DFT and FFT, we should let the simulation run for a lar ge 
number of cycles and use a small value of Step Ceiling (in the  Transient 
dialog box) to ensure accurate results. The Final Time in the Transient  
dialog box should be at least five times the period of the signal to allow 
the simulation to reach steady state.

Comparing the result with that in Eq. (17.1.7) (see Example 17.1) or with 
the spectra in Fig. 17.4 shows a close agreement. From Eq. (17.1.7), the 
dc component is 0.5 while PSpice gives 0.498995. Also, the signal has 
only odd harmonics with phase ψn = −90°, whereas PSpice seems to 
indicate that the signal has even harmonics although the magnitudes of 
the even harmonics are small.
■ METHOD 2  FFT Approach: With voltage marker in Fig. 17.36 
in place, we run 
PSpice and obtain the waveform V(1) shown in 
Fig. 17.37(a) on the PSpice A/D window. By double clicking the FFT 
icon in the PSpice A /D menu and changing the X-axis setting to 0 to 
10 Hz, we obtain the FFT of V(1) as shown in Fig. 17.37(b). The FFT-
generated graph contains the dc and harmonic components within the 
selected frequency range. Notice that the magnitudes and frequencies of 
the harmonics agree with the DFT-generated tabulated values.

If vs = 12 sin(200 πt)u(t) V in the circuit of Fig. 17.38, find i(t).
Solution:
 1. Define. Although the problem appears to be clearly stated, it might 
be advisable to check with the individual who assigned the prob-
lem to make sure he or she wants the transient response rather than 
the steady-state response; in the latter case the problem becomes 
trivial.
 2. Present. We are to determine the response i(t) given the input vs(t), 
using PSpice and Fourier analysis.
 3. Alternative. We will use DFT to perform the initial analysis. We 
will then check using the FFT approach.
 4. Attempt. The schematic is shown in Fig. 17.39. We may use the 
DFT approach to obtain the Fourier coefficents of i(t). Because the 
period of the input waveform is T = 1∕100 = 10 ms, in the  
Transient dialog box we select Print Step: 0.1 ms, Final Time:  
100 ms, Center Frequency: 100 Hz, Number of harmonics: 4,  
and Output Vars: I(L1). When the circuit is simulated, the output

in Fig. 17.40(a). By double clicking the FFT icon and setting the 
range of the X-axis from 0 to 200 Hz, we generate the FFT of I(L1) 
shown in Fig. 17.40(b). It is clear from the FFT-generated plot that 
only the dc component and the first harmonic are visible. Higher 
harmonics are negligibly small.
One final observation, does the answer make sense? Let us 
look at the actual transient response, i(t) = (9.549e−0.5t − 9.549) 
cos(200πt)u(t) mA. The period of the cosine wave is 10 ms while 
the time constant of the exponential is 2000 ms (2 seconds). So, the 
answer we obtained by Fourier techniques does agree.
 6. Satisfactory? Clearly, we have solved the problem satisfactorily 
using the specified approach. We can now present our results as a 
solution to the problem.

 Applications
We demonstrated in Section 17.4 that the F ourier series expansion per-
mits the application of the phasor techniques used in ac analysis to cir-
cuits containing nonsinusoidal periodic excitations. The Fourier series 
has many other practical applications, particularly in communications 
and signal processing. Typical applications include spectrum analysis, 
filtering, rectification, and harmonic distortion. We will consider two of 
these: spectrum analyzers and filters.
17.8.1  Spectrum Analyzers
The Fourier series provides the spectrum of a signal. As we have seen, 
the spectrum consists of the amplitudes and phases of the harmonics 
versus frequency. By providing the spectrum of a signal f(t), the Fourier 
series helps us identify the pertinent features of the signal. It demon
-
strates which frequencies are playing an important role in the shape of 
the output and which ones are not. F or example, audible sounds ha ve 
significant components in the frequency range of 20 Hz to 15 kHz, while 
visible light signals range from 105 to 106 GHz. Table 17.4 presents some 
other signals and the frequency ranges of their components. A periodic 
function is said to be band-limited if its amplitude spectrum contains 
only a finite number of coefficients An or cn. In this case, the F ourier 
series becomes
 
f(t) =  ∑ 
n=−N  
N
  cnejnω0t = a0 +  ∑ 
n=1  
N
  An cos(nω0t + 𝜙n)  (17.75)
This shows that we need only 2N + 1 terms (namely, a0, A1, A2, …, AN, 
𝜙1, 𝜙2, …, 𝜙N) to completely specify f(t) if ω0 is kno wn. This leads 
to the sampling theorem: a band-limited periodic function whose Fourier 
series contains N harmonics is uniquely specified by its values at 2N + 1 
instants in one period.
A spectrum analyzer is an instrument that displays the amplitude 
of the components of a signal v
ersus frequency. It sho ws the v arious 
frequency components (spectral lines) that indicate the amount of energy 
at each frequency.
It is unlik e an oscilloscope, which displays the entire signal (all 
components) versus time. An oscilloscope shows the signal in the time 
domain, while the spectrum analyzer sho ws the signal in the frequenc y 
domain. There is perhaps no instrument more useful to a circuit analyst 
than the spectrum analyzer . An analyzer can conduct noise and spuri -
ous signal analysis, phase checks, electromagnetic interference and filter 
examinations, vibration measurements, radar measurements, and more. 
Spectrum analyzers are commercially a
vailable in v arious sizes and 
shapes. Figure 17.42 displays a typical one.
17.8.2  Filters
Filters are an important component of electronics and communications 
systems. Chapter 14 presented a full discussion on passive and active fil-
ters. Here, we investigate how to design filters to select the fundamental 
component (or any desired harmonic) of the input signal and reject other 
harmonics. This filtering process cannot be accomplished without the

Fourier series expansion of the input signal. For the purpose of illustration, 
we will consider tw o cases, a lo w-pass filter and a band-pass filter. In 
Example 17.6, we already looked at a high-pass RL filter.
The output of a lo w-pass filter depends on the input signal, the 
transfer function H(ω) of the filter, and the corner or half-po wer fre-
quency ωc. We recall that ωc = 1∕RC for an RC passive filter. As shown 
in Fig. 17.43(a), the low-pass filter passes the dc and low-frequency com-
ponents, while blocking the high-frequency components. By making ωc 
sufficiently large (ωc ≫ ω0, e.g., making C small), a large number of the 
harmonics can be passed. On the other hand, by making ωc sufficiently 
small (ωc ≪ ω0), we can block out all the ac components and pass only 
dc, as shown typically in Fig. 17.43(b). (See Fig. 17.2(a) for the Fourier 
series expansion of the square wave.)

(a) Input and output spectra of a low-pass filter, (b) the low-pass filter passes

Similarly, the output of a bandpass filter depends on the input  signal, 
the transfer function of the filter H(ω), its bandwidth B, and its cen -
ter frequency ωc. As illustrated in Fig. 17.44(a), the filter passes all the 
harmonics of the input signal within a band of frequencies (
ω1 < ω < 
ω2) centered around ωc. We have assumed that ω0, 2ω0, and 3ω0 are 
within that band. If the filter is made highly selective (B ≪ ω0) and ωc = 
ω0, where ω0 is the fundamental frequency of the input signal, the filter 
 passes only the fundamental component (n = 1) of the input and blocks 
out all higher harmonics. As shown in Fig. 17.44(b), with a square wave 
as input, we obtain a sine wave of the same frequency as the output. 
(Again, refer to Fig. 17.2(a).)

Applications

In this section, we have used ωc for the 
center frequency of the bandpass filter 
instead of ω0 as in Chapter 14, to avoid 
confusing ω0 with the fundamental 
frequency of the input signal.

where the period is T = 1 s and the fundamental frequency is 
ω0 = 
2π rad/s. Inasmuch as the corner frequency of the filter is ωc = 10 rad/s, 
only the dc component and harmonics with nω0 < 10 will be passed. For 
n = 2, nω0 = 4π = 12.566 rad/s, which is higher than 10 rad/s, meaning 
that second and higher harmonics will be rejected. Thus, only the dc and 
fundamental components will be passed. Hence, the output of the filter is

 Summary
1. A periodic function is one that repeats itself every T seconds; that is, 
f(t ± nT) = f(t), n = 1, 2, 3, ….
2. Any nonsinusoidal periodic function 
f(t) that we encounter in 
 electrical engineering can be e xpressed in terms of sinusoids using 
Fourier series:
f(t) = a0 +   ∑ 
n=1  
∞
   (an cos nω0t + bn sin nω0t)
 
dc 
 
ac
  
where ω0 = 2π∕T is the fundamental frequency. The Fourier series 
resolves the function into the dc component a0 and an ac component 
containing infinitely many harmonically related sinusoids. The Fou-
rier coefficients are determined as
a0 =  1

If f(t) is an e ven function, bn = 0, and when f(t) is odd, a0 = 0 
and an = 0. If f(t) is half-wave symmetric, a0 = an = bn = 0 for even 
values of n.
3. An alternative to the trigonometric (or sine-cosine) Fourier series is 
the amplitude-phase form 
f(t) = a0 +  ∑ 
n=1

4. Fourier series representation allows us to apply the phasor method 
in analyzing circuits when the source function is a 
 nonsinusoidal 
 periodic function. We use phasor technique to determine the 
 response of each harmonic in the series, transform the responses to 
the time domain, and add them up.
5. The average-power of periodic voltage and current is 
P = VdcIdc +  1 
__ 2   ∑ 
n=1  
∞
  VnIn cos(θn − 𝜙n)
  
In other w ords, the total average power is the sum of the a verage 
powers in each harmonically related voltage and current.
6. A periodic function can also be represented in terms of an exponen-
tial (or complex) Fourier series as
f(t) =  ∑ 
n=−∞  
∞
  cnejnω0t
  
where
cn =  1 
__ 
T   ∫ 
0 
T
  f(t)e−jnω0t dt
  
and ω0 = 2π∕T. The exponential form describes the spectrum of 
f(t) in terms of the amplitude and phase of ac components at posi -
tive and negative harmonic frequencies. Thus, there are three basic 
forms of Fourier series representation: the trigonometric form, the 
amplitude-phase form, and the exponential form.
7. The frequency (or line) spectrum is the plot of An and 𝜙n or ∣cn∣ and 
θn versus frequency. 
8. The rms value of a periodic function is given by
Frms =  √

  ( a n

This relationship is known as Parseval’s theorem.
9. Using PSpice, a F ourier analysis of a circuit can be performed in 
conjunction with the transient analysis.
10. Fourier series find application in spectrum analyzers and filters. The 
spectrum analyzer is an instrument that displays the discrete Fourier 
spectra of an input signal, so that an analyst can determine the fre -
quencies and relative energies of the signal’s components. Because 
the Fourier spectra are discrete spectra, filters can be designed for 
great effectiveness in blocking frequenc y components of a signal 
that are outside a desired range.

Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career
Career in Communications Systems
Communications systems apply the principles of circuit analysis. A com-
munication system is designed to convey information from a source (the 
transmitter) to a destination (the receiver) via a channel (the propagation 
medium). Communications engineers design systems for transmitting 
and receiving information. The information can be in the form of voice, 
data, or video.
We live in the information age—ne ws, weather, sports, shopping, 
financial, business inventory, and other sources make information avail-
able to us almost instantly via communications systems. Some ob vious 
examples of communications systems are the telephone network, mobile 
cellular telephones, radio, cable TV, satellite TV, fax, and radar. Mobile 
radio, used by police and fire departments, aircraft, and various busi-
nesses is another example.
The field of communications is perhaps the fastest growing area in 
electrical engineering. The merging of the communications field with com-
puter technology in recent years has led to digital data communications
 
networks such as local area netw orks, metropolitan area netw orks, and 
broadband integrated services digital networks. For example, the  Internet 
(the “information superhighway”) allows educators, business people, and 
others to send electronic mail from their computers w orldwide, log onto 
remote databases, and transfer files. The Internet has hit t he world like a 
tidal wave and is drastically changing the w ay people do b usiness, com-
municate, and get information. This trend will continue.
A communications engineer designs systems that provide high-quality 
information services. The systems include hardw are for generating, trans-
mitting, and receiving information signals. Communications engineers are 
employed in numerous communications industries and places where com -
munications systems are routinely used. More and more government agen-
cies, academic departments, and businesses are demanding faster and more 
accurate transmission of information. To meet these needs, communications 
engineers are in high demand. Therefore, the future is in communications  
and every electrical engineer must prepare accordingly.

Introduction
Fourier series enable us to represent a periodic function as a sum of 
sinusoids and to obtain the frequenc
y spectrum from the series. 
The 
Fourier transform allows us to e xtend the concept of a frequenc y spec-
trum to nonperiodic functions. The transform assumes that a nonperiodic 
function is a periodic function with an infinite period. Thus, the Fourier 
transform is an integral representation of a nonperiodic function that is 
analogous to a Fourier series representation of a periodic function.
The F ourier transform is an 
integral tr ansform lik e the Laplace 
transform. It transforms a function in the time domain into the frequency 
domain. The Fourier transform is very useful in communications systems 
and digital signal processing, in situations where the Laplace transform 
does not apply . While the Laplace transform can only handle circuits 
with inputs for t > 0 with initial conditions, the F ourier transform can 
handle circuits with inputs for t < 0 as well as those for t > 0.
We begin by using a Fourier series as a stepping stone in defining 
the Fourier transform. Then we de velop some of the properties of the 
Fourier transform. Next, we apply the Fourier transform in analyzing cir-
cuits. We discuss Parseval’s theorem, compare the Laplace and F ourier 
transforms, and see ho w the F ourier transform is applied in amplitude 
modulation and sampling.
18.2
Definition of the Fourier Transform
We saw in the previous chapter that a nonsinusoidal periodic function can 
be represented by a Fourier series, provided that it satisfies the Dirichlet 
conditions. What happens if a function is not periodic? Unfortunately , 
there are many important nonperiodic functions—such as a unit step or 
an exponential function—that we cannot represent by a Fourier series. 
As we shall see, the Fourier transform allows a transformation from the 
time to the frequency domain, even if the function is not periodic.
Suppose we w ant to find the Fourier transform of a nonperiodic 
function p(t), shown in Fig. 18.1(a). We consider a periodic function f(t) 
whose shape over one period is the same as p(t), as shown in Fig. 18.1(b). 
If we let the period T → ∞, only a single pulse of width τ [the desired 
nonperiodic function in Fig. 18.1(a)] remains, because the adjacent

Eq. (17.66).
pulses have been moved to infinity. Thus, the function f(t) is no longer 
periodic. In other words, f(t) = p(t) as T → ∞. It is interesting to consider 
the spectrum of f(t) for A = 10 and τ = 0.2 (see Section 17.6). Figure 18.2 
shows the effect of increasing T on the spectrum. First, we notice that the 
general shape of the spectrum remains the same, and the frequenc
y at 
which the envelope first becomes zero remains the same. However, the 
amplitude of the spectrum and the spacing between adjacent components 
both decrease, while the number of harmonics increases. Thus, over a 
range of frequencies, the sum of the amplitudes of the harmonics remains 
almost constant. As the total “strength” or ener gy of the components 
within a band must remain unchanged, the amplitudes of the harmonics 
must decrease as T increases. Because f = 1∕T, as T increases, f or ω 
decreases, so that the discrete spectrum ultimately becomes  continuous.
To further understand this connection between a nonperiodic func-
tion and its periodic counterpart, consider the e
xponential form of a 
Fourier series in Eq. (17.58), namely,
f(t) =  ∑

amplitude spectrum, while its phase is called the phase spectrum. Thus, 
F(ω) is the spectrum.

Fourier Transform

The function f(t) and its transform F(ω) form the Fourier transform pairs:
f (t)  
⇔  
F(ω) 
(18.10)
given that one can be derived from the other.
The F ourier transform F(ω) e xists when the F
ourier inte gral in 
Eq. (18.8) converges. A sufficient but not necessary condition that f (t) has a 
Fourier transform is that it be completely integrable in the sense that
 ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  ∣ f(t)∣ dt < ∞ 
(18.11)
For example, the Fourier transform of the unit ramp function tu(t) does 
not exist, because the function does not satisfy the condition above.
To avoid the complex algebra that explicitly appears in the F ourier 
transform, it is sometimes expedient to temporarily replace jω with s and 
then replace s with jω at the end.

Definition of the Fourier Transform

Example 18.1
Find the F ourier transform of the follo wing functions: (a) δ(t − t0), 
(b) e jω0t, (c) cos ω0 t.
Solution:
(a) For the impulse function,
 
F(ω) = 
[δ(t − t0)] =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  δ(t − t0)e−jωt dt = e−jωt0 
(18.1.1)
where the sifting property of the impulse function in Eq. (7.32) has been 
applied. For the special case t0 = 0, we obtain
 
[δ(t)] = 1 
(18.1.2)
This shows that the magnitude of the spectrum of the impulse function 
is constant; that is, all frequencies are equally represented in the impulse 
function.
(b) We can find the Fourier transform of e jω0t in two ways. If we let
F(ω) = δ(ω − ω0)
then we can find f(t) using Eq. (18.9), writing
f (t) =  1 
___ 
2π    ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  δ(ω − ω0)e jωt dω
Using the sifting property of the impulse function gives

___ 
2π   e jω0t
Inasmuch as F(ω) and f (t) constitute a F ourier transform pair , so too 
must 2πδ(ω − ω0) and e jω0t,
 
[e jω0 t] = 2πδ(ω − ω0) 
(18.1.3)
 
Alternatively, from Eq. (18.1.2),
δ(t) = 
−1[1]

Using the inverse Fourier transform formula in Eq. (18.9),
δ(t) = 
 −1[1] =  1

2π    ∫

  1e jωt dω
or
 
 ∫

  e jωt dω = 2 π δ(t) 
(18.1.4)
Interchanging variables t and ω results in
 
 ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  e jωt dt = 2 π δ(ω) 
(18.1.5)
Using this result, the Fourier transform of the given function is
[e jω0t] =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  e jω0t e−jωt dt =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  e j(ω0 − ω) dt = 2 π δ(ω0 − ω)
Because the impulse function is an e
ven function, with δ(ω0 − ω) = 
δ(ω − ω0),
 
[e jω0t] = 2 π δ(ω − ω0) 
(18.1.6)
By simply changing the sign of ω0, we readily obtain
 
[e−jω0t] = 2 π δ(ω + ω0) 
(18.1.7)
Also, by setting ω0 = 0,
 
[1] = 2 π δ(ω) 
(18.1.8)
(c) By using the result in Eqs. (18.1.6) and (18.1.7), we get

 Properties of the Fourier Transform
We now develop some properties of the Fourier transform that are useful 
in finding the transforms of complicated functions from the transforms 
of simple functions. F or each property, we will first state and derive it, 
and then illustrate it with some examples.
Linearity
If F1(ω) and F2(ω) are the F ourier transforms of f1(t) and f2(t), respec-
tively, then
 
[a1 f1(t) + a2 f2(t)] = a1F1(ω) + a2F2(ω)
(18.12)
where a1 and a2 are constants. This property simply states that the  Fourier 
transform of a linear combination of functions is the same as the linear 
combination of the transforms of the indi vidual functions. The proof of 
the linearity property in Eq. (18.12) is straightforward. By definition,
[a1  f1(t) + a2  f2(t)] =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  [a1 f1(t) + a2  f2(t)]e−jωt dt
=  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  a1  f1(t)e−jωt dt +  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  a2  f2(t)e−jωt dt
= a1F1(ω) + a2F2(ω) 
(18.13)
For e xample, sin  ω0t =  1 
__ 
2j  (ejω0t − e−jω0t). Using the linearity 
 property,
 
F[sin ω0t] =  1 
__ 
2j  [

__ j  [δ(ω − ω0) − δ(ω + ω0)]

[p(t)] = Aτ sinc  ωτ

(18.18a)
Using Eq. (18.15),
 
[p(2t)] =  Aτ 
___ 
2  sinc  ωτ 
___ 
4  
(18.18b)
It may be helpful to plot 
p(t) and p(2t) and their F ourier transforms. 
Because
 
p(t) = {
A,
0, 
− τ 
__ 2  < t <  τ 
__ 2  
otherwise
 
(18.19a)
then replacing every t with 2t gives
p(2t) = {

__ 2  < 2t <  τ 
__ 2  
otherwise
 = {
A,
0,
  − τ 
__ 4  < t <  τ 
__ 4  
otherwise
 
(18.19b)
showing that p(2t) is time compressed, as shown in Fig. 18.9(b). To plot 
both Fourier transforms in Eq. (18.18), we recall that the sinc function 
has zeros when its argument is nπ, where n is an integer. Hence, for the 
transform of p(t) in Eq. (18.18a), ωτ∕2 = 2πfτ∕2 = nπ → f = n∕τ, and for 
the transform of p(2t) in Eq. (18.18b), ωτ∕4 = 2π f τ∕4 = nπ → f = 2n∕τ. 
The plots of the Fourier transforms are shown in Fig. 18.9, which shows 
that time compression corresponds with frequency expansion. We should 
expect this intuitively, because when the signal is squashed in time, we 
expect it to change more rapidly, thereby causing higher-frequency com-
ponents to exist.
Time Shifting
If F(ω) = 
[  f(t)], then
 
[ f(t − t0)] = e−jωt0 F(ω)
 
(18.20)
that is, a delay in the time domain corresponds to a phase shift in the 
frequency domain. To derive the time shifting property, we note that
 
[ f(t − t0)] =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  f(t − t0)e−jωt dt 
(18.21)
18.3
Properties of the Fourier Transform

If we let x = t − t0 so that dx = dt and t = x + t0, then
[  f(t − t0)] =  ∫

  f(x)e−jω(x+t0) dx
= e−jωt0  ∫

  f(x)e−jωx dx = e−jωt0 F(ω) 
(18.22)

[  f(t)], then
 
[  f(t)e jω0t] = F(ω − ω0)
 
(18.25)
meaning, a frequency shift in the frequency domain adds a phase shift to 
the time function. By definition,
[  f(t)e jω0t] =  ∫

Time Differentiation
Given that F(ω) =

[  f ′(t)] = jωF(ω)
(18.28)
In other words, the transform of the derivative of f(t) is obtained by mul-
tiplying the transform of f(t) by jω. By definition,
f(t) = 
−1[F(ω)] =  1 
___ 
2π    ∫ 
−∞

(18.29)

___ 
2π    ∫ 
−∞

  F(ω)e jωt dω = jω
−1[F(ω)]
or
 
[  f′(t)] = jωF(ω) 
(18.30)
Repeated applications of Eq. (18.30) give
 
[  f (n)(t)] = ( jω)nF(ω)
 
(18.31)
For e xample, cos  ω0t =  1 _ 
2  (e jω0t + e−jω0t). Using the property in 
Eq. (18.25),
 
[  f(t) cos ω0t] =  1

This is an important result in modulation where frequenc y components 
of a signal are shifted. If, for example, the amplitude spectrum of f(t) is 
as shown in Fig. 18.10(a), then the amplitude spectrum of f(t)cosω0t will 
be as shown in Fig. 18.10(b). We will elaborate on amplitude modulation 
in Section 18.7.1.

For example, if f(t) = e−atu(t), then

(18.32)

(18.33)
which agrees with the result in Example 18.3.

F(ω) 
_____ 
jω    + πF(0)δ(ω)
 
(18.34)
that is, the transform of the inte gral of f(t) is obtained by di viding the 
transform of f(t) by jω and adding the result to the impulse term that 
reflects the dc component F(0). Someone might ask, “How do we know 
that when we take the Fourier transform for time integration, we should 
integrate over the interval [−∞, t] and not [−∞, ∞]?” When we integrate 
over [−∞, ∞], the result does not depend on time an
ymore, and the 
Fourier transform of a constant is what we will eventually get. But when 
we integrate over [−∞, t], we get the inte gral of the function from the 
past to time t, so that the result depends on t and we can take the Fourier 
transform of that.
If ω is replaced by 0 in Eq. (18.8),
 
F(0) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  f(t) dt 
(18.35)
indicating that the dc component is zero when the integral of f(t) over all 
time vanishes. The proof of the time inte gration in Eq. (18.34) will be 
given later when we consider the convolution property.
For example, we know that 
[δ(t)] = 1 and that integrating the im-
pulse function gives the unit step function [see Eq. (7.39a)]. By applying 
the property in Eq. (18.34), we obtain the F ourier transform of the unit 
step function as
 
[u(t)] = 
 [ ∫ 
−∞  
t
  δ(τ) dτ] =  1 
___ 
jω   + πδ(ω) 
(18.36)
Reversal
If F(ω) = 
[  f(t)], then
 
[  f(−t)] = F(−ω) = F*(ω)
 
(18.37)
where the asterisk denotes the comple x conjugate. This property states 
that reversing f(t) about the time axis reverses F(ω) about the frequency 
axis. This may be regarded as a special case of time scaling for which 
a = −1 in Eq. (18.15).

Chapter 18

Because f(t) is the sum of the signals in

Duality
This property states that if F(ω) is the Fourier transform of f(t), then the 
Fourier transform of F(t) is 2πf(−ω); we write
[  f(t)] = F(ω)  
⇒  
[F(t)] = 2πf(−ω) 
(18.38)
This expresses the symmetry property of the Fourier transform. To  derive 
this property, we recall that

−1[F(ω)] =  1

(18.39)
Replacing t by −t gives

If we interchange t and ω, we obtain

as expected.
For example, if f(t) =  e −∣t∣ , then

______

(18.41)
By the duality property, the Fourier transform of F(t) = 2∕(t2 + 1) is
 
2πf(ω) = 2πe−∣ω∣ 
(18.42)
Figure 18.11 sho ws another e xample of the duality property . It illus -
trates the f act that if f(t) = δ(t) so that F(ω) = 1, as in Fig. 18.11(a), 
then the Fourier transform of F(t) = 1 is 2πf(ω) = 2πδ(ω) as shown in 
Fig. 18.11(b).
Convolution
Recall from Chapter 15 that if x(t) is the input excitation to a circuit with 
an impulse function of h(t), then the output response y(t) is given by the 
convolution integral
y(t) = h(t) * x(t) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  h(λ)x(t − λ) dλ 
(18.43)
18.3
Properties of the Fourier Transform 
823

The important relationship in Eq. (18.46) 
is the key reason for using the Fourier 
transform in the analysis of  linear 
 systems.
If X(ω), H(ω), and Y(ω) are the Fourier transforms of x(t), h(t), and y(t), 
respectively, then
 
Y(ω) = 
[h(t) * x(t)] = H(ω)X(ω)
 
(18.44)
which indicates that con volution in the time domain corresponds with 
multiplication in the frequency domain.
To derive the convolution property, we take the Fourier transform of 
both sides of Eq. (18.43) to get
 
Y(ω) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  [ ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  h(λ)x(t − λ) dλ] e−jωt dt 
(18.45)
Exchanging the order of inte gration and factoring h(λ), which does not 
depend on t, we have
Y(ω) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  h(λ) [ ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  x(t − λ)e−jωt dt] dλ
For the integral within the brack ets, let τ = t − λ so that t = τ + λ and 
dt = dτ. Then,
 
Y(ω) =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  h(λ) [ ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  x(τ)e−jω(τ+λ) dτ]  dλ
=  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  h(λ)e−jωλ dλ  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  x(τ)e−jωτ dτ = H(ω)X(ω) 
(18.46)
as expected. This result e xpands the phasor method be yond what w as 
done with the Fourier series in the previous chapter.
To illustrate the con volution property , suppose both 
h(t) and 
x(t)  are identical rectangular pulses, as sho wn in Fig. 18.12(a) and 
18.12(b). We recall from Example 18.2 and Fig. 18.5 that the  Fourier 
transforms of the rectangular pulses are sinc functions, as sho
wn in 
Fig. 18.12(c) and 18.12(d). According to the con volution property, 
the product of the sinc functions should gi ve us the con volution of 
the rectangular pulses in the time domain. 
Thus, the con volution 
of the pulses in Fig. 18.12(e) and the product of the sinc functions in 
Fig. 18.12(f) form a Fourier pair.
In view of the duality property, we expect that if convolution in the 
time domain corresponds with multiplication in the frequenc y domain,

which is convolution in the frequency domain. The proof of Eq. (18.48) 
readily follows from the duality property in Eq. (18.38).
Let us no w deri ve the time inte gration property in Eq. (18.34). 
If we replace x(t) with the unit step function u(t) and h(t) with f(t) in 
Eq. (18.43), then
 ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  f(λ)u(t − λ) dλ = f(t) * u(t) 
(18.49)
But by the definition of the unit step function,
u(t − λ) = {
1,
0,  t − λ > 0
t − λ > 0
We can write this as
u(t − λ) = {
1,
0,  λ < t
λ > t
Substituting this into Eq. (18.49) makes the interval of integration change 
from [−∞, ∞] to [−∞, t], and thus Eq. (18.49) becomes
 ∫ 
−∞  
t
  f(λ) dλ = u(t) * f(t)
Taking the Fourier transform of both sides yields
 
 [ ∫ 
−∞

  f(λ) dλ] = U(ω)F(ω) 
(18.50)
But from Eq. (18.36), the Fourier transform of the unit step function is
U(ω) =  1 
___

Substituting this into Eq. (18.50) gives

which is the time inte
gration property of Eq. (18.34). Note that in 
Eq. (18.51), F(ω)δ(ω) = F(0)δ(ω), since δ(ω) is only nonzero at ω = 0.

 Circuit Applications
The Fourier transform generalizes the phasor technique to nonperiodic 
functions. Therefore, we apply Fourier transforms to circuits with non-
sinusoidal excitations in exactly the same way we apply phasor techniques 
to circuits with sinusoidal excitations. Thus, Ohm’s law is still valid:
V(ω) = Z(ω)I(ω) 
(18.52)
where V(ω) and I(ω) are the Fourier transforms of the v oltage and cur-
rent and Z(ω) is the impedance. We get the same e xpressions for the 
impedances of resistors, inductors, and capacitors as in phasor analysis, 
namely,

(18.53)
Once we transform the functions for the circuit elements into the fre

quency domain and tak e the F ourier transforms of the e xcitations, we 
can use circuit techniques such as v oltage division, source transforma -
tion, mesh analysis, node analysis, or Thevenin’s theorem, to find the 
 unknown response (current or v
oltage). Finally , we tak e the in verse 
 Fourier transform to obtain the response in the time domain.
Although the F ourier transform method produces a response that 
 exists for −∞ < t < ∞, Fourier analysis cannot handle circuits with 
initial conditions.
The transfer function is ag ain defined as the ratio of the output 
 response Y(ω) to the input excitation X(ω); that is,

Eq. (18.54) is the principal reason for using the F
ourier transform in 
circuit analysis. Notice that H(ω) is identical to H(s) with s = jω. Also, if 
the input is an impulse function [i.e., x(t) = δ(t)], then X(ω) = 1, so that 
the response is
Y(ω) = H(ω) =

 Parseval’s Theorem
Parseval’s theorem demonstrates one practical use of the F ourier trans-
form. It relates the ener gy carried by a signal to the F ourier transform 
of the signal. If p(t) is the power associated with the signal, the energy 
carried by the signal is
W =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  p(t) dt 
(18.57)
To be able to compare the energy content of current and voltage signals, 
it is convenient to use a 1-Ω resistor as the base for energy calculation. 
For a 1-Ω resistor, p(t) = v2(t) = i2(t) = f 2(t), where f(t) stands for either 
voltage or current. The energy delivered to the 1-Ω resistor is
 
W1Ω =  ∫ 
−∞  
∞
  f 2(t) dt 
(18.58)

Parseval’s theorem states that the total energy delivered to a 1-Ω 
 resistor equals the total area under the square of f (t) or 1∕2 π times 
the total area under the square of the magnitude of the Fourier trans-
form of f (t).
Parseval’s theorem relates energy associated with a signal to its  Fourier 
transform. It pro vides the ph ysical significance of F(ω), namely, that 
∣F(ω)∣2 is a measure of the ener gy density (in joules per hertz) corre -
sponding to f (t).
To deri ve Eq. (18.59), we be gin with Eq. (18.58) and substitute

 In other words, if all the poles of F(s) 
lie in the left-hand side of the s plane, 
then one can obtain the Fourier

Laplace transform F(s) by merely 
replacing s by jω. Note that this is not 
the case, for example, for u(t) or 
cos atu(t).
18.6
 Comparing the Fourier and  
Laplace Transforms
It is worthwhile to take some moments to compare the Laplace and 
Fourier transforms. The following similarities and differences should be 
noted:
1. The Laplace transform defined in Chapter 15 is one-sided in that the 
integral is over 0 < t < ∞, making it only useful for positi ve-time 
functions, f(t), t > 0. The Fourier transform is applicable to func -
tions defined for all time.
2. For a function f(t) that is nonzero for positive time only (i.e.,
 
f(t) = 0, t < 0) and   ∫ 
0 
∞
  ∣f(t)∣ dt < ∞, the two transforms are  related by
 
F(ω) = F(s)∣s=jω 
(18.66)
 
This equation also shows that the Fourier transform can be regarded 
as a special case of the Laplace transform with s = jω. Recall that 
s = σ + jω. Therefore, Eq. (18.66) sho ws that the Laplace trans -
form is related to the entire s plane, whereas the Fourier transform is 
 restricted to the jω axis. See Fig. 15.1.
3. The Laplace transform is applicable to a wider range of functions 
than the F ourier transform. F or example, the function tu(t) has a 
Laplace transform b ut no F ourier transform. But F ourier trans -
forms exist for signals that are not physically realizable and have no 
 Laplace transforms.
4. The Laplace transform is better suited for the analysis of transient 
problems involving initial conditions, because it permits the inclu -
sion of the initial conditions, whereas the F
ourier transform does 
not. The Fourier transform is especially useful for problems in the 
steady state.
5. The Fourier transform pro vides greater insight into the frequenc y 
characteristics of signals than does the Laplace transform.
Some of the similarities and dif ferences can be observed by comparing 
Tables 15.1 and 15.2 with Tables 18.1 and 18.2.

 Applications
Besides its usefulness for circuit analysis, the F ourier transform is used 
extensively in a variety of fields such as optics, spectroscopy, acoustics, 
computer science, and electrical engineering. In electrical engineering, it 
is applied in communications systems and signal processing, where fre-
quency response and frequency spectra are vital. Here we consider tw o 
simple applications: amplitude modulation (AM) and sampling.
18.7.1  Amplitude Modulation
Electromagnetic radiation or transmission of information through space 
has become an indispensable part of a modern technological society . 
However, transmission through space is only efficient and economical 
at high frequencies (above 20 kHz). To transmit intelligent signals—
such as for speech and music—contained in the lo w-frequency range 
of 50 Hz to 20 kHz is e xpensive; it requires a huge amount of po wer 
and large antennas. A common method of transm itting low-frequency 
audio information is to transmit a high- frequency signal, called a carrier, 
which is controlled in some w ay to correspond to the audio informa -
tion. Three characteristics (amplitude, frequency, or phase) of a carrier 
can be controlled so as to allow it to carry the intelligent signal, called 
the modulating signal. Here we will only consider the control of the  
carrier’s amplitude. This is known as amplitude modulation.
Amplitude modulation (AM) is a process whereby the amplitude of the 
carrier is controlled by the modulating signal.
AM is used in ordinary commercial radio bands and the video portion of 
commercial television.
Suppose the audio information, such as voice or music (or the mod-
ulating signal in general) to be transmitted is m(t) = Vm cos ωmt, while 
the high-frequency carrier is c(t) = Vc cos ωct, where ωc ≫ ωm. Then an 
AM signal f(t) is given by
 
f(t) = Vc [1 + m(t)] cos ωct 
(18.67)
Figure 18.22 illustrates the modulating signal m(t), the carrier c(t), and 
the AM signal f(t). We can use the result in Eq. (18.27) together with the  
Fourier transform of the cosine function (see Example 18.1 or Table 18.1) 
to determine the spectrum of the AM signal:
F(ω) = 
[Vc cos ωct] + 
[Vc m(t) cos ωct]
 
= Vcπ[δ(ω − ωc) + δ(ω + ωc)] 
(18.68)
 
 +  Vc 
__ 
2  [M(ω − ωc) + M(ω + ωc)]
where M(ω) is the F ourier transform of the modulating signal 
m(t). 
Shown in Fig. 18.23 is the frequenc y spectrum of the AM signal. Fig -
ure 18.23 indicates that the AM signal consists of the carrier and tw o 
other sinusoids. The sinusoid with frequenc y ωc − ωm is known as the 
lower sideband, while the one with frequenc y ωc + ωm is known as the 
upper sideband.

soidal to mak e the analysis easy . In real life, m(t) is a nonsinusoidal, 
band-limited signal—its frequency spectrum is within the range between 
0 and ωu = 2π fu (i.e., the signal has an upper frequency limit). Typically, 
fu = 5kHz for AM radio. If the frequenc y spectrum of the modulating 
signal is as sho wn in Fig. 18.24(a), then the frequenc y spectrum of the 
AM signal is sho wn in Fig. 18.24(b). Thus, to avoid any interference, 
carriers for AM radio stations are spaced 10 kHz apart.
At the recei ving end of the transmission, the audio informa

In analog systems, signals are processed in their entirety. However, in

ven in 
Section 17.8.1. The sampling can be done by using a train of pulses or 
impulses. We will use impulse sampling here.
Consider the continuous signal g(t) shown in Fig. 18.25(a). This can 
be multiplied by a train of impulses 
δ(t − nTs) shown in Fig. 18.25(b), 
where Ts is the sampling interval and fs = 1∕Ts is the sampling  frequency 
or the sampling rate. The sampled signal gs(t) is therefore

A music signal has frequency components from 15 Hz to 30 kHz. If this 
signal could be used to amplitude modulate a 1.2-MHz carrier , find the 
range of frequencies for the lower and upper sidebands.
Solution:
The lo wer sideband is the dif
ference of the carrier and modulating 
frequencies. It will include the frequencies from
1,200,000 − 30,000 Hz = 1,170,000 Hz
to
1,200,000 − 15 Hz = 1,199,985 Hz
The upper sideband is the sum of the carrier and modulating frequencies. 
It will include the frequencies from
1,200,000 + 15 Hz = 1,200,015 Hz
to
1,200,000 + 30,000 Hz = 1,230,000 Hz

This shows that the F ourier transform Gs(ω) of the sampled signal is a 
sum of translates of the Fourier transform of the original signal at a rate 
of 1∕Ts.
To ensure optimum recovery of the original signal, what must be the 
sampling interval? This fundamental question in sampling is answered 
by an equivalent part of the sampling theorem:
A band-limited signal, with no frequency component higher than 
W hertz, may be completely recovered from its samples taken at a fre-
quency at least twice as high as 2W samples per second.
In other words, for a signal with bandwidth W hertz, there is no loss of 
information or overlapping if the sampling frequency is at least twice the 
highest frequency in the modulating signal. Thus,

Example 18.12
A telephone signal with a cutoff frequency of 5 kHz is sampled at a rate 
60 percent higher than the minimum allowed rate. Find the sampling 
rate.
Solution:
The minimum sample rate is the Nyquist rate  = 2W = 2 × 5 = 10 kHz.  
Hence,
fs = 1.60 × 2W = 16 kHz

7. Typical applications of the Fourier transform are found in amplitude 
modulation (AM) and sampling. F or AM application, a way of de-
termining the sidebands in an amplitude-modulated wave is derived 
from the modulation property of the F ourier transform. F or sam-
pling application, we found that no information is lost in sampling 
(required for digital transmission) if the sampling frequency is equal 
to at least twice the Nyquist rate.

Enhancing Your Career
Career in Education
While two thirds of all engineers work in private industry, some work in 
academia and prepare students for engineering careers. The course on 
circuit analysis you are studying is an important part of the preparation 
process. If you enjoy teaching others, you may want to consider becom-
ing an engineering educator.
Engineering professors w ork on state-of-the-art research projects, 
teach courses at graduate and undergraduate levels, and provide services to 
their professional societies and the community at lar ge. They are expected 
to make original contrib utions in their areas of specialty. This requires a 
broad-based education in the fundamentals of electrical engineering and a  
mastery of the skills necessary for communicating their efforts to  others.
If you like to do research, to w ork at the frontiers of engineering, to 
make contributions to technological advancement, to invent, consult, and/
or teach, consider a career in engineering education. The best way to start is 
by talking with your professors and benefiting from their experience.
A solid understanding of mathematics and physics at the undergraduate 
level is vital to your success as an engineering professor . If you are having 
difficulty in solving your engineering textbook problems, start correcting 
any weaknesses you have in your mathematics and physics fundamentals.
Most universities these days require that engineering professors have 
a doctor’s de gree. In addition, some uni versities require that the y be 
actively involved in research leading to publications in reputable journals. 
To prepare yourself for a career in engineering education, get as broad an 
education as possible, because electrical engineering is changing rapidly

Introduction
A pair of terminals through which a current may enter or leave a network 
is known as a port. Two-terminal devices or elements (such as resis -
tors, capacitors, and inductors) result in one-port networks. Most of the 
circuits we have dealt with so f ar are two-terminal or one-port circuits, 
represented in Fig. 19.1(a). We have considered the v oltage across or 
current through a single pair of terminals—such as the tw o terminals of 
a resistor, a capacitor, or an inductor. We have also studied four-terminal 
or two-port circuits involving op amps, transistors, and transformers, as 
shown in Fig. 19.1(b). In general, a network may have n ports. A port is 
an access to the network and consists of a pair of terminals; the current 
entering one terminal lea ves through the other terminal so that the net 
current entering the port equals zero.
 
In this chapter, we are mainly concerned with two-port networks (or, 
simply, two-ports).
A two-port network is an electrical network with two separate ports for 
input and output.
Thus, a two-port network has two terminal pairs acting as access points. 
As shown in Fig. 19.1(b), the current entering one terminal of a pair 
leaves the other terminal in the pair. Three-terminal devices such as tran-
sistors can be configured into two-port networks.
 
Our study of tw o-port networks is for at least tw o reasons. First, 
such netw orks are useful in communications, control systems, po
wer 
systems, and electronics. F or example, they are used in electronics to 
model transistors and to facilitate cascaded design. Second, knowing the 
parameters of a two-port network enables us to treat it as a “black box” 
when embedded within a larger network.
and becoming interdisciplinary. Without doubt, engineering education is a 
rewarding career. Professors get a sense of satisf action and fulfillment as 
they see their students graduate, become leaders in their profession, and 
contribute significantly to the betterment of humanity.

 Reminder: Only two of the four 
 variables (V1, V2, I1, and I2) are 
 independent. The other two can 
be found using Eq. (19.1).
To characterize a tw o-port network requires that we relate the ter -
minal quantities V1, V2, I1, and I2 in Fig. 19.1(b), out of which tw o are 
independent. The various terms that relate these v oltages and currents 
are called parameters. Our goal in this chapter is to deri ve six sets of 
these parameters. We will show the relationship between these param -
eters and how two-port networks can be connected in series, parallel, or 
cascade. As with op amps, we are only interested in the terminal behav-
ior of the circuits. And we will assume that the two-port circuits contain 
no independent sources, although the y can contain dependent sources. 
Finally, we will apply some of the concepts developed in this chapter to 
the analysis of transistor circuits and synthesis of ladder  networks.

Impedance Parameters
Impedance and admittance parameters are commonly used in the 
synthesis of filters. They are also useful in the design and analysis of 
impedance-matching networks and power distribution networks. We dis-
cuss impedance parameters in this section and admittance parameters in 
the next section.
A tw o-port netw ork may be v oltage-driven as in Fig. 19.2(a) or 
current-driven as in Fig. 19.2(b). From either Fig. 19.2(a) or (b), the 
terminal voltages can be related to the terminal currents as
V1 = z11I1 + z12I2
V2 = z21I1 + z22I2
 
(19.1)
or in matrix form as
 
 [  V1   
V2
 ] =  [  z11   
z21  z12   
z22 ]  [  I1   
I2
 ] = [z]  [  I1   
I2
 ] 
(19.2)
where the z terms are called the impedance par ameters, or simply z 
parameters, and have units of ohms.
 
The values of the parameters can be e
valuated by setting I1 = 0 
(input port open-circuited) or I2 = 0 (output port open-circuited). Thus,

(a) T-equivalent circuit (for reciprocal case only), (b) general equivalent circuit.
Because the z parameters are obtained by open-circuiting the input or 
output port, they are also called the open-circuit impedance parameters. 
Specifically,
z11 = Open-circuit input impedance
z12 = Open-circuit transfer impedance from port 1 to port 2
z21 = Open-circuit transfer impedance from port 2 to port 1 
(19.4)
z22 = Open-circuit output impedance
 
According to Eq. (19.3), we obtain z11 and z21 by connecting a volt-
age V1 (or a current source I1) to port 1 with port 2 open-circuited as in 
Fig. 19.3(a) and finding I1 and V2; we then get
 
z11 =  V1 
___ 
I1
  ,  
z21 =  V2 
___ 
I1
  
(19.5)
Similarly, we obtain z12 and z22 by connecting a voltage V2 (or a current 
source I2) to port 2 with port 1 open-circuited as in Fig. 19.3(b) and find-
ing I2 and V1; we then get
 
z12 =  V1 
___ 
I2
  ,  
z22 =  V2 
___ 
I2
  
(19.6)
The above procedure pro vides us with a means of calculating or mea -
suring the z parameters.
 
Sometimes z11 and z22 are called driving-point impedances, while z21 
and z12 are called transfer impedances. A driving-point impedance is the 
input impedance of a two-terminal (one-port) device. Thus, z11 is the input 
driving-point impedance with the output port open-circuited, while z22 is 
the output driving-point impedance with the input port open-circuited.
 
When z11 = z22, the two-port network is said to be symmetrical. This 
implies that the network has mirrorlike symmetry about some center line; 
that is, a line can be found that divides the network into two similar halves.
 
When the two-port network is linear and has no dependent sources, 
the transfer impedances are equal (z12 = z21), and the two-port is said to 
be reciprocal. This means that if the points of excitation and response are 
interchanged, the transfer impedances remain the same. As illustrated 
in Fig. 19.4, a tw o-port is reciprocal if interchanging an ideal v oltage 
source at one port with an ideal ammeter at the other port gives the same 
ammeter reading. The reciprocal network yields V = z12I according to 
Eq. (19.1) when connected as in Fig. 19.4(a), but yields V = z21I when 
connected as in Fig. 19.4(b). This is possible only if z12 = z21. Any two-
port that is made entirely of resistors, capacitors, and inductors must 
be reciprocal. A reciprocal network can be replaced by the T-equivalent 
circuit in Fig. 19.5(a). If the netw ork is not reciprocal, a more general 
equivalent network is shown in Fig. 19.5(b); notice that this figure fol-
lows directly from Eq. (19.1).

An ideal transformer has no z parameters.
It should be mentioned that for some tw
o-port netw orks, the z 
parameters do not exist because they cannot be described by Eq. (19.1). 
As an example, consider the ideal transformer of Fig. 19.6. The defining 
equations for the two-port network are:
V1 =  1 
__ n  V2,  
I1 = −nI2 
(19.7)
Observe that it is impossible to express the voltages in terms of the cur-
rents, and vice versa, as Eq. (19.1) requires. Thus, the ideal transformer 
has no z parameters. Ho wever, it does ha ve hybrid parameters, as we 
shall see in Section 19.4.

Example 19.1
Determine the z parameters for the circuit in Fig. 19.7.
Solution:
■ METHOD 1  To determine z11 and z21, we apply a voltage source 
V1 to the input port and lea ve the output port open as in Fig. 19.8(a). 
Then,
z11 =  V1 
___

that is, z11 is the input impedance at port 1.

___ 
I1
  =  40I1 
____ 
I1
  = 40 Ω
To find z12 and z22, we apply a voltage source V2 to the output port and 
leave the input port open as in Fig. 19.8(b). Then,
z12 =  V1 
___ 
I2
  =  40I2

■ METHOD 2  Alternatively, as there is no dependent source in the 
given circuit, z12 = z21 and we can use Fig. 19.5(a). Comparing Fig. 19.7 
with Fig. 19.5(a), we get
z12 = 40 Ω = z21
z11 − z12 = 20  
⇒   
z11 = 20 + z12 = 60 Ω
z22 − z12 = 30

z22 = 30 + z12 = 70 Ω

For Example 19.2.
Solution:
This is not a reciprocal netw ork. We may use the equi valent circuit in 
Fig. 19.5(b) b ut we can also use Eq. (19.1) directly
. Substituting the 
given z parameters into Eq. (19.1),
V1 = 40I1 + j20I2 
(19.2.1)
 
V2 = j30I1 + 50I2 
(19.2.2)
Because we are looking for I1 and I2, we substitute
V1 = 100⧸ 0°,  
V2 = −10I2
into Eqs. (19.2.1) and (19.2.2), which become
 
100 = 40I1 + j20I2 
(19.2.3)
 
−10I2 = j30I1 + 50I2  
⇒  
I1 = j2I2 
(19.2.4)
Substituting Eq. (19.2.4) into Eq. (19.2.3) gives
100 = j80I2 + j20I2  
⇒  
I2 =  100 
____ 
j100  = −j
From Eq. (19.2.4), I1 = j2(−j) = 2. Thus,
I1 = 2⧸ 0° A,  
I2 = 1⧸ −90° A

Admittance Parameters
In the previous section we saw that impedance parameters may not exist 
for a tw o-port network. So there is a need for an alternati ve means of 
describing such a netw ork. This need may be met by the second set of 
parameters, which we obtain by expressing the terminal currents in terms 
of the terminal voltages. In either Fig. 19.12(a) or (b), the terminal cur -
rents can be expressed in terms of the terminal voltages as
I1 = y11V1 + y12V2
I2 = y21V1 + y22V2
 
(19.8)
or in matrix form as
 
 [  I1   
I2
 ] =  [ y11   
y21   y12   
y22 ]  [  V1   
V2
 ] = [y]  [  V1   
V2
 ] 
(19.9)
The y terms are kno wn as the admittance par ameters (or , simply, y 
 parameters) and have units of siemens.
 
The values of the parameters can be determined by setting V1 = 0 
(input port short-circuited) or V2 = 0 (output port short-circuited). Thus,
 
y11 =  I1 
___ 
V1
   | 
V2=0  
 
   , y12 =  I1 
___ 
V2
   | 
V1=0  
 
     
y21 =  I2 
___ 
V1
   | 
V2=0  
 
   , y22 =  I2 
___ 
V2
   | 
V1=0  
 
      
(19.10)
Because the y parameters are obtained by short-circuiting the input or 
output port, they are also called the short-circuit admittance parameters. 
Specifically,
y11 = Short-circuit input admittance
y12 = Short-circuit transfer admittance from port 2 to port 1
y21 = Short-circuit transfer admittance from port 1 to port 2  (19.11)
y22 = Short-circuit output admittance
Following Eq. (19.10), we obtain y11 and y21 by connecting a current 
I1 to port 1 and short-circuiting port 2 as in Fig. 19.12(a), finding V1 and 
I2, and then calculating
 
y11 =  I1 
___ 
V1
  ,  
y21 =  I2

(19.12)
Similarly, we obtain y12 and y22 by connecting a current source 
I2 to 
port 2 and short-circuiting port 1 as in Fig. 19.12(b), finding I1 and V2, 
and then getting
y12 =  I1 
___ 
V2
  ,  
y22 =  I2

(19.13)
This procedure provides us with a means of calculating or measuring the 
y parameters. The impedance and admittance parameters are collectively 
referred to as immittance parameters.

the transfer admittances are equal ( y12 = y21). This can be proved in the 
same way as for the z parameters. A reciprocal network (y12 = y21) can be 
modeled by the Π-equivalent circuit in Fig. 19.13(a). If the network is not 
reciprocal, a more general equivalent network is shown in Fig. 19.13(b).

 Hybrid Parameters
The z and y parameters of a two-port network do not always exist. So 
there is a need for developing another set of parameters. This third set of 
parameters is based on making V1 and I2 the dependent variables. Thus, 
we obtain
 
V1 = h11I1 + h12V2
I2 = h21I1 + h22V2

Obtain the y parameters for the circuit in Fig. 19.19.

The h terms are known as the hybrid parameters (or, simply, h parameters)  
because they are a hybrid combination of ratios. They are very useful for 
describing electronic devices such as transistors (see Section 19.9); it is 
much easier to measure experimentally the h parameters of such devices 
than to measure their z or y parameters. In f act, we ha ve seen that the 
ideal transformer in Fig. 19.6, described by Eq. (19.7), does not ha ve z 
parameters. The ideal transformer can be described by the hybrid param-
eters, because Eq. (19.7) conforms with Eq. (19.14).
 
The values of the parameters are determined as

It is evident from Eq. (19.16) that the parameters h11, h12, h21, and h22
represent an impedance, a voltage gain, a current gain, and an admit-
tance, respectively. This is wh y they are called the h ybrid parameters. 
To be specific,
h11 = Short-circuit input impedance
h12 = Open-circuit reverse voltage gain 
(19.17)
h21 = Short-circuit forward current gain
h22 = Open-circuit output admittance
The procedure for calculating the h parameters is similar to that used 
for the z or y parameters. We apply a v oltage or current source to the 
appropriate port, short-circuit or open-circuit the other port, depending 
on the parameter of interest, and perform re
gular circuit analysis. F or 
reciprocal networks, h12 = −h21. This can be proved in the same way as 
we proved that z12 = z21. Figure 19.20 shows the hybrid model of a two-
port network.
 
A set of parameters closely related to the 
h parameters are the g 
parameters or inverse hybrid parameters. These are used to describe the 
terminal currents and voltages as

Determine the h parameters for the circuit in Fig. 19.24.
Answer: h11 = 2.4 Ω, h12 = 0.4, h21 = −0.4, h22 = 200 mS.
Example 19.6
Determine the Thevenin equivalent at the output port of the circuit in 
Fig. 19.25.
Solution:
To find ZTh and VTh, we apply the normal procedure, keeping in mind the 
formulas relating the input and output ports of the h model. To obtain ZTh, 
remove the 60-V voltage source at the input port and apply a 1-V voltage 
source at the output port, as shown in Fig. 19.26(a). From Eq. (19.14),
V1 = h11I1 + h12V2 
(19.6.1)
 
I2 = h21I1 + h22V2 
(19.6.2)
But V2 = 1, and V1 = −40I1. Substituting these into Eqs. (19.6.1) and 
(19.6.2), we get
−40I1 = h11I1 + h12  
⇒  
I1 = −  
h12 
_______ 
40 + h11
  
(19.6.3)
 
I2 = h21I1 + h22 
(19.6.4)
Substituting Eq. (19.6.3) into Eq. (19.6.4) gives
I2 = h22 −  h21h12 
_______ 
h11 + 40  =  h11h22 − h21h12 + h2240

To get VTh, we find the open-circuit voltage V2 in Fig. 19.26(b). At the 
input port,
 
−60 + 40I1 + V1 = 0  
⇒  
V1 = 60 − 40I1 
(19.6.5)

At the output,
I2 = 0 
(19.6.6)
Substituting Eqs. (19.6.5) and (19.6.6) into Eqs. (19.6.1) and (19.6.2), 
we obtain
60 − 40I1 = h11I1 + h12V2
or
60 = (h11 + 40)I1 + h12V2 
(19.6.7)
and
 
0 = h21I1 + h22V2

 Transmission Parameters
Because there are no restrictions on which terminal voltages and currents 
should be considered independent and which should be dependent v ari-
ables, we expect to be able to generate many sets of parameters. Another 

set of parameters relates the variables at the input port to those at the 
output port. Thus,
V1 = AV2 − BI2
  I1 = CV2 − DI2
 
(19.22)
or
 
 [
V1
I1 ] 
 = 
 [
A B
C D] 
 
 [
V2
−I2] 
 = [T]
 [
V2
−I2] 
 
(19.23)
Equations (19.22) and (19.23) relate the input variables (V1 and I1) to the 
output variables (V2 and −I2). Notice that in computing the transmission 
parameters, −I2 is used rather than I2, because the current is considered 
to be leaving the network, as shown in Fig. 19.31, as opposed to enter -
ing the network as in Fig. 19.1(b). This is done merely for conventional 
reasons; when you cascade two-ports (output to input), it is most logical 
to think of I2 as leaving the two-port. It is also customary in the power 
industry to consider I2 as leaving the two-port.
 
The two-port parameters in Eqs. (19.22) and (19.23) provide a mea-
sure of how a circuit transmits v oltage and current from a source to a 
load. They are useful in the analysis of transmission lines (such as cable 
and fiber) because they e xpress sending-end v ariables ( V1 and I1) in 
terms of the receiving-end variables (V2 and −I2). For this reason, they 
are called transmission parameters. They are also known as ABCD pa-
rameters. They are used in the design of telephone systems, micro wave 
networks, and radars.
 
The transmission parameters are determined as
 
A =  V1 
___ 
V2
  | 
I2=0  
 
    ,  
B = − V1 
___

I2=0  
 
    ,  
D = − I1

Thus, the transmission parameters are called, specifically,
A = Open-circuit voltage ratio
B = Negative short-circuit transfer impedance
C = Open-circuit transfer admittance 
(19.25)
D = Negative short-circuit current ratio
A and D are dimensionless, B is in ohms, and C is in siemens. Because 
the transmission parameters provide a direct relationship between input 
and output variables, they are very useful in cascaded networks.
Our last set of parameters may be defined by expressing the  variables 
at the output port in terms of the variables at the input port. We obtain
V2 = aV1 − bI1
I2 = cV1 − dI1

a = Open-circuit voltage gain
b = Negative short-circuit transfer impedance 
(19.29)
c = Open-circuit transfer admittance
d = Negative short-circuit current gain
While a and d are dimensionless, b and c are in ohms and siemens, 
respectively.
In terms of the transmission or in verse transmission parameters, a 
network is reciprocal if
AD − BC = 1,

The output port is connected to a v

Solution:
What we need is to find the Thevenin equivalent (ZTh and VTh) at the 
load or output port. We find ZTh using the circuit in Fig. 19.35(a). Our 
goal is to get ZTh = V2∕I2. Substituting the given ABCD parameters into

and (19.9.2),
 
50 − 10I1 = 4V2 
(19.9.4)
 
I1 = 0.1V2 
(19.9.5)
Substituting Eq. (19.9.5) into Eq. (19.9.4),
50 − V2 = 4V2  
⇒  
V2 = 10
Thus,
VTh = V2 = 10 V
The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 19.35(c). For maximum power

†Relationships Between Parameters
Because the six sets of parameters relate the same input and output ter-
minal variables of the same two-port network, they should be interre-
lated. If two sets of parameters exist, we can relate one set to the other 
set. Let us demonstrate the process with two examples.
Given the z parameters, let us obtain the 
y parameters. From 
Eq. (19.2),
 [

 = 
 [
z11 z12
z21 z22] 
 
 [
I1

(19.31)
or
 
 [
I1
I2] 
 = [z]−1
 [

(19.32)
Also, from Eq. (19.9),
 
 [
I1
I2 ] 
 = 
 [
y11 y12
y21 y22] 
 
 [
V1
V2] 
 = [y]
 [
V1
V2] 
 
(19.33)
Comparing Eqs. (19.32) and (19.33), we see that
 
[y] = [z]−1 
(19.34)
The adjoint of the [z] matrix is
  [
z22 −z12
−z21 z11] 
and its determinant is
∆z = z11z22 − z12z21
Substituting these into Eq. (19.34), we get
 [
y11 y12
y21 y22] 
 =   [
z22 −z12
−z21 z11]  
__________

As a second example, let us determine the h parameters from the z 
parameters. From Eq. (19.1),
 
V1 = z11I1 + z12I2 
(19.37a)
 
V2 = z21I1 + z22I2

Table 19.1 provides the conversion formulas for the six sets of two-

find other parameters. For example, given the T parameters, we find the 
corresponding h parameters in the fifth column of the third ro w. Also, 

given that z21 = z12 for a reciprocal netw ork, we can use the table to 
express this condition in terms of other parameters. It can also be shown 
that
 
[g] = [h]−1

Interconnection of Networks
A large, complex network may be divided into subnetworks for the pur-
poses of analysis and design. The subnetworks are modeled as two-port 
networks, interconnected to form the original network. The two-port net-
works may therefore be regarded as building blocks that can be intercon-
nected to form a complex network. The interconnection can be in series, 
in parallel, or in cascade. Although the interconnected netw ork can be 
described by an y of the six parameter sets, a certain set of parameters 
may have a definite advantage. For example, when the netw orks are in 
series, their individual z parameters add up to gi ve the z parameters of 
the larger network. When they are in parallel, their individual y param-
eters add up to gi ve the y parameters of the lar ger network. When they 
are cascaded, their individual transmission parameters can be multiplied 
together to get the transmission parameters of the larger network.

Series connection of two two-port  
networks.
Consider the series connection of tw o two-port networks shown in 
Fig. 19.39. The networks are re garded as being in series because their 
input currents are the same and their voltages add. In addition, each net-
work has a common reference, and when the circuits are placed in series, 
the common reference points of each circuit are connected together. For 
network Na,
V1a = z11aI1a + z12aI2a
 
V2a = z21aI1a + z22aI2a 
(19.44)
and for network Nb,
V1b = z11bI1b + z12bI2b
 
V2b = z21bI1b + z22bI2b 
(19.45)
We notice from Fig. 19.39 that
 
I1 = I1a = I1b,  
I2 = I2a = I2b 
(19.46)
and that
V1 = V1a + V1b = (z11a + z11b)I1 + (z12a + z12b)I2
V2 = V2a + V2b = (z21a + z21b)I1 + (z22a + z22b)I2  (19.47)
Thus, the z parameters for the overall network are
 
 [
z11 z12
z21 z22] 
 = 
 [
z11a + z11b z12a + z12b
z21a + z21b z22a + z22b] 
 
(19.48)
or
 
[z] = [za] + [zb]
 
(19.49)
showing that the z parameters for the overall network are the sum of the  
z parameters for the individual networks. This can be extended to n net-
works in series. If two two-port networks in the [h] model, for example, 
are connected in series, we use Table 19.1 to convert the h to z and then 
apply Eq. (19.49). We finally convert the result back to h using Table 19.1.
 
Two two-port networks are in parallel when their port voltages are 
equal and the port currents of the larger network are the sums of the 
individual port currents. In addition, each circuit must ha ve a common 
reference and when the netw orks are connected together , they must all 
have their common references tied together. The parallel connection of 
two two-port networks is shown in Fig. 19.40. For the two networks,
I1a = y11aV1a + y12aV2a
 
I2a = y21aV1a + y22aV2a 
(19.50)
and
I1b = y11bV1b + y12bV2b
 
I2a = y21bV1b + y22bV2b 
(19.51)
But from Fig. 19.40,
 
V1 = V1a = V1b,  
V2 = V2a = V2b 
(19.52a)
 
I1 = I1a + I1b,  
I2 = I2a + I2b 
(19.52b)
874 
Chapter 19
Two-Port Networks

Substituting Eqs. (19.50) and (19.51) into Eq. (19.52b) yields
I1 = (y11a + y11b)V1 + (y12a + y12b)V2
I2 = (y21a + y21b)V1 + (y22a + y22b)V2 
(19.53)
Thus, the y parameters for the overall network are
 
 [
y11 y12
y21 y22] 
 = 
 [
y11a + y11b y12a + y12b
y21a + y21b y22a + y22b] 
 
(19.54)
or
 
[y] = [ya] + [yb]
 
(19.55)
showing that the y parameters of the overall network are the sum of the 
y parameters of the individual networks. The result can be extended to n 
two-port networks in parallel.
 
Two networks are said to be cascaded when the output of one is the 
input of the other. The connection of two two-port networks in cascade 
is shown in Fig. 19.41. For the two networks,

Computing Two-Port Parameters 
Using PSpice
Hand calculation of the two-port parameters may become difficult when 
the two-port is complicated. We resort to PSpice in such situations. If the 
circuit is purely resisti ve, PSpice dc analysis may be used; otherwise, 
PSpice ac analysis is required at a specific frequency. The key to using 
PSpice in computing a particular two-port parameter is to remember how 
that parameter is defined and to constrain the appropriate port variable 
with a 1-A or 1-V source while using an open or short circuit to impose 
the other necessary constraints. The following two examples illustrate 
the idea.

Find the h parameters of the network in Fig. 19.49.
Solution:
From Eq. (19.16),
h11 =  V1 
___ 
I1
   | 
V2=0  
 
    ,  
h21 =  I2 
__ 
I1
   | 
V2=0  
 
  
showing that h11 and h21 can be found by setting V2 = 0. Also by set -
ting I1 = 1 A, h11 becomes V1∕1 while h21 becomes I2∕1. With this in 
mind, we draw the schematic in Fig. 19.50(a). We insert a 1-A dc current 

source IDC to take care of I1 = 1 A, the pseudocomponent VIEWPOINT 
to display V1 and pseudocomponent IPROBE to display I2. After saving 
the schematic, we run PSpice by selecting Analysis/Simulate and note 
the values displayed on the pseudocomponents. We obtain
h11 =  V1 
___ 
1  = 10 Ω,  
h21 =  I2 
__ 
1  = −0.5
 
Similarly, from Eq. (19.16),
h12 =  V1 
___ 
V2
   | 
I1=0  
 
     ,  
h22 =  I2 
___ 
V2
   | 
I1=0  
 
  
indicating that we obtain h12 and h22 by open-circuiting the input port  
(I1 = 0). By making V2 = 1 V, h12 becomes V1∕1 while h22 becomes I2∕1. 
Thus, we use the schematic in Fig. 19.50(b) with a 1-V dc voltage source 
VDC inserted at the output terminal to take care of V2 = 1 V. The pseu-
docomponents VIEWPOINT and IPR OBE are inserted to display the 
values of V1 and I2, respectively. (Notice that in Fig. 19.50(b), the 5- Ω 
resistor is ignored because the input port is open-circuited and 
PSpice 
will not allow such. We may include the 5- Ω resistor if we replace the 
open circuit with a very large resistor, say, 10 MΩ.) After simulating the 
schematic, we obtain the values displayed on the pseudocomponents as 
shown in Fig. 19.50(b). Thus,
h12 =  V1 
___ 
1  = 0.8333,  
h22 =  I2

Applications
We have seen how the six sets of network parameters can be used to charac-
terize a wide range of two-port networks. Depending on the way two-ports 
are interconnected to form a larger network, a particular set of  parameters 
may have advantages over others, as we noticed in S ec tion 19.7. In this  
section, we will consider tw
o important application areas of two-port 
 parameters: transistor circuits and synthesis of ladder networks.
19.9.1  Transistor Circuits
The two-port network is often used to isolate a load from the e xcitation 
of a circuit. For example, the two-port in Fig. 19.55 may represent an 
amplifier, a filter, or some other network. When the two-port represents 
an amplifier, expressions for the voltage gain Av, the current gain Ai, the 
input impedance Zin, and the output impedance Zout can be derived with 
ease. They are defined as follows:
 
Av =  V2(s) 
_____ 
V1(s)  
(19.62)
 
Ai =  I2(s) 
____ 
I1(s)

(19.64)
 
Zout =  V2(s) 
_____

Any of the six sets of tw
o-port parameters can be used to deri
ve the 
 expressions in Eqs. (19.62) to (19.65). Ho wever, the hybrid (h) param-
eters are the most useful for transistors; the y are easily measured and 
are often provided in the manufacturer’s data or spec sheets for transis -
tors. The h parameters pro vide a quick estimate of the performance of 
transistor circuits. They are used for finding the exact voltage gain, input 
impedance, and output impedance of a transistor.

Common emitter amplifier: (a) circuit schematic, (b) hybrid model.
The h parameters for transistors have specific meanings expressed 
by their subscripts. They are listed by the first subscript and related to the 
general h parameters as follows:
hi = h11,  
hr = h12,  
hf = h21,  
ho = h22 
(19.66)
The subscripts i, r, f, and o stand for input, reverse, forward, and output. 
The second subscript specifies the type of connection used: e for com-
mon emitter (CE), c for common collector (CC), and b for common base 
(CB). Here we are mainly concerned with the common-emitter connec -
tion. Thus, the four h parameters for the common-emitter amplifier are:
hie = Base input impedance
hre = Reverse voltage feedback ratio 
(19.67)
hfe = Base-collector current gain
hoe = Output admittance
These are calculated or measured in the same w
ay as the general h 
 parameters. Typical values are hie = 6 kΩ, hre = 1.5 × 10−4, hfe = 200, 
hoe = 8 µS. We must keep in mind that these values represent ac charac-
teristics of the transistor, measured under specific circumstances.
 
Figure 19.56 sho ws the circuit schematic for the common-emitter 
amplifier and the equivalent hybrid model. From the figure, we see that
 
Vb = hieIb + hreVc

Consider the transistor amplifier connected to an ac source and a

ded within a larger network. We can analyze the hybrid equivalent  circuit 
as usual with Eq. (19.68) in mind. (See Example 19.6.) Recognizing 

from Fig. 19.57 that Vc = −RLIc and substituting this into Eq. (19.68b) 
gives
Ic = hfeIb − hoeRLIc

Solution:
1. Define. In an initial look at this problem, it appears to be 
 clearly 
stated. However, when we are asked to determine the input  impedance 
and the voltage gain, do they refer to the transistor or the  circuit? As 
far as the current gain and the output impedance are concerned, the y 
are the same for both cases.
We ask for clarification and are told that we should calculate 
the input impedance, the output impedance, and the voltage gain 

for the circuit and not the transistor. It is interesting to note that the 
problem can be restated so that it becomes a simple design prob-
lem: Given the h parameters, design a simple amplifier that has a 
gain of −60.
2. Present. Given a simple transistor circuit, an input voltage of 3.2 mV, 
and the h parameters of the transistor, calculate the output voltage.
3. Alternative. There are a couple of ways we can approach the prob-
lem, the most straightforw ard being to use the equi valent circuit 
shown in Fig. 19.57. Once you ha ve the equivalent circuit you can 
use circuit analysis to determine the answer. Once you have a solu-
tion, you can check it by plugging in the answer into the circuit 
equations to see if they are correct. Another approach is to simplify 
the right-hand side of the equi valent circuit and w ork backward to 
see if you obtain approximately the same answer . We will use that 
approach here.
4. Attempt. We note that Rs = 0.8 kΩ and RL = 1.2 kΩ. We treat the 
transistor of Fig. 19.59 as a two-port network and apply Eqs. (19.70) 
to (19.79).

Av is the voltage gain of the amplifier = Vo∕Vb. To calculate the 
gain of the circuit we need to find Vo∕Vs. We can do this by using 
the mesh equation for the circuit on the left and Eqs. (19.71) and 
(19.73).

5. Evaluate. In the equi valent circuit, hoe represents a resistor of 
50,000 Ω. This is in parallel with a load resistor equal to 1.2 k
Ω. 
The size of the load resistor is so small relative to the hoe resistor that 
hoe can be neglected. This then leads to
Ic = hfeIb = 50Ib, Vc = −1200Ic,
and the following loop equation from the left-hand side of the 
circuit:
−0.0032 + (800 + 1000)Ib + (0.00025)(−1200)(50)Ib = 0
 
Ib = 0.0032∕(1785) = 1.7927 µA.
Ic = 50 × 1.7927 = 89.64 µA and Vc = −1200 × 89.64 × 10−6
 = −107.57 mV
This is a good approximation to −105.09 mV.
Voltage gain = −107.57∕3.2 = −33.62 
Again, this is a good approximation to 32.82.
Circuit input impedance = 0.032∕1.7927 × 10−6 = 1785 Ω
which clearly compares well with the 1785.4 Ω we obtained before.
 
For these calculations, we assumed that Zout = ∞ Ω. Our 
calculations produced 72.6 kΩ. We can test our assumption by 
calculating the equivalent resistance of this and the load resistance.
72,600 × 1200∕(72,600 + 1200) = 1,180.5 = 1.1805 kΩ
Again, we have a good approximation.
6. Satisfactory? We ha ve satisf actorily solv ed the problem and 
checked the results. We can now present our results as a solution to 
the problem.

Another application of tw o-port parameters is the synthesis (or b uild-

Practice Problem 19.17
For the transistor amplifier of Fig. 19.60, find the voltage gain, current 
gain, input impedance, and output impedance. Assume that 
hie = 6 kΩ,  
hre = 1.5 × 10−4,  
hfe = 200,  
hoe = 8 µS
Answer: −123.61 for the transistor and −4.753 for the circuit, 194.17,

particular use in designing passive low-pass filters. Based on our discus-
sion of second-order circuits in Chapter 8, the order of the filter is the 
order of the characteristic equation describing the filter and is determined 
by the number of reactive elements that cannot be combined into single 
elements (e.g., through series or parallel combination). Figure 19.61(a) 
shows an LC ladder network with an odd number of elements (to realize 
an odd-order filter), while Fig. 19.61(b) shows one with an even number 
of elements (for realizing an e ven-order filter). When either network is 
terminated by the load impedance ZL and the source impedance Zs, we 
obtain the structure in Fig. 19.62. To make the design less complicated, 
we will assume that Zs = 0. Our goal is to synthesize the transfer function 
of the LC ladder network. We begin by characterizing the ladder network 
by its admittance parameters, namely,
 
I1 = y11V1 + y12V2 
(19.80a)
 
I2 = y21V1 + y22V2

(Of course, the impedance parameters could be used instead of the admit-
tance parameters.) At the input port, V1 = Vs since Zs = 0. At the output 
port, V2 = Vo and I2 = −V2∕ZL = −VoYL. Thus, Eq. (19.80b) becomes
−VoYL = y21Vs + y22Vo
or
 
H(s) =  Vo

(19.82)
We may ignore the ne gative sign in Eq. (19.82) because filter require-
ments are often stated in terms of the magnitude of the transfer  function. 
The main objective in filter design is to select capacitors and inductors 
so that the parameters y21 and y22 are synthesized, thereby realizing 
the desired transfer function. To achieve this, we tak e advantage of an 
 important property of the LC ladder network: All z and y parameters are 
ratios of polynomials that contain only e ven powers of s or odd powers  

of s—that is, they are ratios of either Od(s)∕Ev(s) or Ev(s)∕Od(s), where 
Od and Ev are odd and even functions, respectively. Let
H(s) =  N(s) 
____ 
D(s)  =  No + Ne 
_______ 
Do + De
  
(19.83)
where N(s) and D(s) are the numerator and denominator of the transfer 
function H(s); No and Ne are the odd and even parts of N; Do and De are 
the odd and even parts of D. Given that N(s) must be either odd or even, 
we can write Eq. (19.83) as
 
H(s) =    
 
No 
_______ 
Do + De
  , (Ne = 0)

H(s) =

  , (Ne = 0)  
          
 Ne∕Do 
_________ 
1 + De∕Do

(19.85)
Comparing this with Eq. (19.82), we obtain the 
y parameters of the 
 network as

work with the input port short-circuited. We determine the values of L 
and C in Fig. 19.63(a) that will give us y22. Recall that y22 is the short-
circuit output admittance. So we short-circuit the input port as shown in 
Fig. 19.63(b). First we get L3 by letting

y22  =  s3 + 2s

Next, we seek to get C2 as in Fig. 19.63(c) and let

______ 
1.5s  = 1.333s +  1

YC =  1 
____ 
1.5s  =  1

Thus, the LC ladder netw ork in Fig. 19.63(a) with L1 = 1.5 H, C2 = 
1.333 F, and L3 = 0.5 H has been synthesized to provide the given trans-
fer function H(s). This result can be confirmed by finding H(s) = V2∕V1 
in Fig. 19.63(a) or by confirming the required y21.

 Summary
1. A two-port network is one with tw o ports (or tw o pairs of access 
terminals), known as input and output ports.
2. The six parameters used to model a two-port network are the imped-
ance [z], admittance [y], hybrid [h], inverse hybrid [g], transmission 
[T], and inverse transmission [t] parameters.
3. The parameters relate the input and output port variables as

4. The parameters can be calculated or measured by short-circuiting or 
open-circuiting the appropriate input or output port.
5. A two-port network is reciprocal if z12 = z21, y12 = y21, h12 = −h21, 
g12 = −g21, ∆T = 1 or ∆t = 1. Networks that have dependent sources 
are not reciprocal.
6. Table 19.1 provides the relationships between the six sets of param-
eters. Three important relationships are
[y] = [z]−1,  
[g] = [h]−1,  
[t] ≠ [T]−1
7. Two-port networks may be connected in series, in parallel, or in 
cascade. In the series connection the z parameters are added, in the 
parallel connection the y parameters are added, and in the cascade 
connection the transmission parameters are multiplied in the correct 
order.
8. One can use PSpice to compute the tw o-port parameters by con -
straining the appropriate port v ariables with a 1-A or 1-V source 
while using an open or short circuit to impose the other necessary 
constraints.
9. The network parameters are specifically applied in the analysis of 
transistor circuits and the synthesis of ladder LC networks. Network 
parameters are especially useful in the analysis of transistor circuits 
because these circuits are easily modeled as two-port networks. LC 
ladder networks, important in the design of passive low-pass filters, 
resemble cascaded T networks and are therefore best analyzed as 
two-ports.

Simultaneous Equations

In circuit analysis, we often encounter a set of simultaneous equations 
having the form

a21x1 + a22x2 + ⋯ + a2nxn = b2 
(A.1)
 
⋮ 
⋮ 
⋮
an1x1 + an2x2 + ⋯ + annxn = bn
where there are n unknown x1, x2, . . . , xn to be determined. Equation (A.1) 
can be written in matrix form as

A is a square (n × n) matrix while X and B are column matrices.
 
There are several methods for solving Eq. (A.1) or (A.3). These in-
clude substitution, Gaussian elimination, Cramer’s rule, matrix inver
-
sion, and numerical analysis.
A.1
Cramer’s Rule
In many cases, Cramer’s rule can be used to solve the simultaneous equa -
tions we encounter in circuit analysis. Cramer’s rule states that the solution 
to Eq. (A.1) or (A.3) is
 
x1 =

where the ∆’s are the determinants given by

(A.6)
Notice that ∆ is the determinant of matrix A and ∆k is the determinant 
of the matrix formed by replacing the kth column of A by B. It is evi -
dent from Eq. (A.5) that Cramer’s rule applies only when ∆ ≠  0. When  
∆ = 0, the set of equations has no unique solution, because the equations 
are linearly dependent.
 
The value of the determinant ∆, for example, can be obtained by 
expanding along the first row:
     ∆ = ∣

 ∣  
(A.7)
     = a11M11 − a12M12 + a13M13 + ⋯ + (−1)1+na1nM1n
where the minor Mij is an ( n − 1) × (n − 1) determinant of the matrix 
formed by striking out the ith row and jth column. The value of ∆ may 
also be obtained by expanding along the first  column:
 
∆ = a11M11 − a21M21 + a31M31 + ⋯ + (−1)n+1an1Mn1 
(A.8)
 
We now specifically develop the formulas for calculating the deter-
minants of 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 matrices, because of their frequent occurrence 
in this text. For a 2 × 2 matrix,
 
∆ = ∣
a11 a12
a21 a22∣ = a11a22 − a12a21 
(A.9)
For a 3 × 3 matrix,
∆ = ∣

One may use other methods, such 
as matrix inversion and elimination. 
Only Cramer’s method is covered 
here,  because of its simplicity and 
also  because of the availability of 
 powerful calculators.
The solution of linear simultaneous equations by Cramer’s rule boils 
down to finding

where ∆ is the determinant of matrix A and ∆k is the determinant of the

An alternative method of obtaining the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix is 
by repeating the first two rows and multiplying the terms diagonally as 
follows.

You may not find much need to use Cramer’s method described in 
this appendix, in view of the availability of calculators, computers, and 
software packages such as MATLAB, which can be used easily to solve 
a set of linear equations. But in case you need to solve the equations by 
hand, the material covered in this appendix becomes useful. At any rate, 
it is important to know the mathematical basis of those calculators and 
software packages.

Simultaneous Equations and Matrix Inversion

Matrix Inversion
The linear system of equations in Eq. (A.3) can be solved by matrix 
 inversion. In the matrix equation AX = B, we may invert A to get X, i.e.,
 
X = A−1B 
(A.13)
where A−1 is the inverse of 
A. Matrix inversion is needed in other 
 applications apart from using it to solve a set of equations.
 
By definition, the inverse of matrix A satisfies
 
A−1A = AA−1 = I 
(A.14)
Obtain the solution of this set of simultaneous equations:
 
3x1 − x2 − 2x3 = 1

Complex Numbers
The ability to manipulate complex numbers is very handy in circuit 
analysis and in electrical engineering in general. Complex numbers are 
particularly useful in the analysis of ac circuits. Again, although calcula-
tors and computer software packages are now available to manipulate 
complex numbers, it is still advisable for a student to be familiar with 
how to handle them by hand.
B.1  
Representations of Complex 
Numbers
A complex number z may be written in rectangular form as
z = x + jy 
(B.1)
where j =  √
___ 
−1  ; x is the real part of z while y is the imaginary part of 
z; that is,
 
x = Re(z),  
y = Im(z) 
(B.2)
The complex number z is shown plotted in the complex plane in Fig. B.1. 
Because j =  √
___ 
−1  ,
 
 1 
__ j  = −j
 
j 2 = −1
 
j 3 = j · j 2 = −j 
(B.3)
 
j 4 = j 2 · j 2 = 1
 
j 5 = j · j 4 = j
 
 ⋮ 
 
j n+4 = jn
A second way of representing the complex number  z is by specify-
ing its magnitude r and the angle 𝜃 it makes with the real axis, as Fig. B.1 
shows. This is known as the polar form. It is given by
z = ∣z∣ ⧸ θ = r ⧸ θ 
(B.4)
where
 
r =  √
______ 
x2 + y2  ,  
𝜃= tan−1  y 
__ x  
(B.5a)
or
x = r cos 𝜃,  
y = r sin 𝜃 
(B.5b)
that is,
 
z = x + jy = r⧸ θ = r cos 𝜃+ jr sin 𝜃 
(B.6)
A-9

In the exponential form, z = re j𝜃 so that 
dz∕d𝜃 = jre j𝜃 = jz.
In converting from rectangular to polar form using Eq. (B.5), we must 
exercise care in determining the correct value of 𝜃. These are the four 
possibilities:
z = x + jy, 
𝜃= tan−1   y 
__ x  
(1st Quadrant)
 
z = −x + jy, 
𝜃= 180° − tan−1   y 
__ x  
(2nd Quadrant)
 
z = −x − jy, 
𝜃= 180° + tan−1  y 
__ x  
(3rd Quadrant)

assuming that x and y are positive.
 
The third way of representing the complex z is the exponential form:
 
z = re j𝜃 
(B.8)
This is almost the same as the polar form, because we use the same mag-
nitude r and the angle 𝜃.
The three forms of representing a complex number are summarized 
as follows.

Answer: (a) 6.928 + j4, (b) 22.94 − j32.77, (c) 8.66 − j5, (d) j50.
Example B.2
Convert the following complex numbers into rectangular form:
(a) 12⧸ −60°, (b) −50⧸ 285°, (c) 8e j10°, (d) 20e−jπ∕3.
Solution:
(a) Using Eq. (B.6),
12⧸ −60° = 12 cos( −60°) + j12 sin( −60°) = 6 − j10.39
Note that 𝜃= −60° is the same as 𝜃= 360° − 60° = 300°.
(b) We can write
 −50⧸ 285° = −50 cos 285° − j50 sin 285° = −12.94 + j48.3
(c) Similarly,
8e j10° = 8 cos 10° + j8 sin 10° = 7.878 + j1.389
(d) Finally,
20e −jπ∕3 = 20 cos(−π∕3) + j20 sin(−π∕3) = 10 − j17.32

Mathematical Operations
Two complex numbers z1 = x1 + jy1 and z2 = x2 + jy2 are equal if and 
only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal,
 
x1 = x2,  
y1 = y2 
(B.10)
 
The complex conjugate of the complex number z = x + jy is
 
z* = x − jy = r ⧸ − θ = re −j𝜃 
(B.11)
Thus, the complex conjugate of a complex number is found by replacing 
every j by −j.
 
Given two complex numbers z1 = x1 + jy1 = r1⧸ θ1 and z2 = x2 + jy2 = 
r2 ⧸ θ2, their sum is
 
z1 + z2 = (x1 + x2) + j( y1 + y2) 
(B.12)
and their difference is
 
z1 − z2 = (x1 − x2) + j( y1 − y2) 
(B.13)
 
While it is more convenient to perform addition and subtraction of 
complex numbers in rectangular form, the product and quotient of the 
two complex numbers are best done in polar or exponential form. For 
their product,
 
z1z2 = r1r2⧸ 𝜃1 + θ2 
(B.14)
Alternatively, using the rectangular form,
 
z1z2 = (x1 + jy1)(x2 + jy2)
 
= (x1x2 − y1y2) + j(x1y2 + x2y1) 
(B.15)
For their quotient,

We have used lightface notation for

whereas we use boldface notation 
for phasors.
Example B.3
If A = 2 + j5, B = 4 − j6, find: (a) A*(A + B), (b) (A + B)∕(A − B).
Solution:
(a) If A = 2 + j5, then A* = 2 − j5 and
A + B = (2 + 4) + j(5 − 6) = 6 − j
so that
A*(A + B) = (2 − j5)(6 − j) = 12 − j2 − j30 − 5 = 7 − j32

Solution:
(a) Because there are terms in polar and exponential forms, it may be 
best to express all terms in polar form:
2 + j5 =  √
_______ 
22 + 52  ⧸ tan−1 5/2 = 5.385 ⧸ 68.2°
(2 + j5)(8ej10°) = (5.385 ⧸ 68.2°)(8 ⧸ 10°) = 43.08 ⧸ 78.2°
2 + j4 + 2 ⧸ −40° = 2 + j4 + 2 cos(−40°) + j2 sin( −40°)
= 3.532 + j2.714 = 4.454 ⧸ 37.54°
Thus,
 (2 + j5)(8e j10°)  
_______________  
2 + j4 + 2 ⧸ −40° 
  =  43.08 ⧸ 78.2° 
 
____________  
4.454 ⧸ 37.54°
  = 9.672 ⧸ 40.66°
(b) We can evaluate this in rectangular form, because all terms are in 
that form. But
 
j(3 − j4)* = j(3 + j4) = −4 + j3
 
(2 + j)2 = 4 + j4 − 1 = 3 + j4
 
(−1 + j6)(2 + j)2 = ( −1 + j6)(3 + j4) = −3 − 4j + j18 − 24
 
 = −27 + j14
Hence,
 
 
j(3 − j4)*

(−1 + j6)(2 + j)2  =  −4 + j3
