incredibly wide variety of information — aimed at ensuring your home-

About This Book
Home-Based Business For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is full of useful information, 
tips, and checklists for everyone who aspires to start a successful home-
based business. Your current level of business experience (or lack thereof) 
doesn’t matter. Don’t worry about not having years of it under your belt or 
about not knowing the difference between direct selling and franchising. For a 
fraction of the amount you’d pay to get an MBA, this book provides you with 
an easily understandable road map to today’s most innovative and effective 
home-based business techniques and strategies.
The information you find here is firmly grounded in the real world. This book 
isn’t an abstract collection of theoretical mumbo-jumbo that sounds good 
but doesn’t work when you put it to the test. Instead, we’ve included only the

Home-Based Business For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
best information, the best strategies, and the best techniques — the exact 
same ones that top business schools teach today. This book is a toolbox full 
of solutions to your every question and problem.
This book is also fun — it reflects our strong belief and experience that run­
ning a business doesn’t have to be a bore. We even help you maintain a sense 
of humor in the face of the challenges that all home-based businesspeople 
face from time to time — after all, we’ve been there and done that!
And one more thing: The Internet has forever changed the world of business, 
which includes home-based businesses. This book contains the latest infor­
mation on using e-commerce, starting and operating a successful business 
on the Internet, and using blogs and Web sites to your advantage. It’s also 
chock-full of our own personal Internet bookmarks for the best home-
business resources the Web has to offer.
Conventions Used in This Book
When writing this book, we included some general conventions that all For 
Dummies books use. We use the following:
	
✓	Italics to point out any words you may not be familiar with — and 
remind you that definitions are somewhere nearby
	
✓	Boldface to point out all keywords in bulleted lists and the actual steps 
in numbered lists
	
✓	Monofont to point out all Web sites and e-mail addresses
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to 
break across two lines of text. If you come across a two-line Web address, 
rest assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) 
to indicate the break. So when you’re using one of these Web addresses, 
just type in exactly what you see in this book, pretending that the line break 
doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Although we think every word in this book is worth your time, we know you 
probably don’t have time to read them all. With that understanding in mind, 
we make it easy for you to identify material that you can skip by placing it 
into sidebars. So feel free to skip the sidebars, or the gray boxes in each

 Introduction
chapter, which contain information that’s interesting and related to the topic 
at hand, but not absolutely essential for the success of your home-based 
business.
Foolish Assumptions
While we were writing this book, we made a few assumptions about you. 
For example, we assume that you have at least a passing interest in starting 
your own business. Maybe you’ve already started a home-based business, 
or perhaps it’s something you may want to try. We also assume that you can 
produce and deliver products or services that people will be willing to pay 
you for. These products and services can be most anything — you’re limited 
only by your imagination (and your bank account). Finally, we assume that 
you don’t already know everything there is to know about starting your own 
home-based business and that you’re eager to acquire some new perspec­
tives on the topic.
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve organized this book into five parts. The chapters within each part 
cover specific topic areas in detail. As a result, you can easily find the topic 
you’re looking for. Look in the index or table of contents for your general 
area of interest and then find the chapter that concerns your particular 
needs. Whatever the topic, odds are it’s covered somewhere in this book.
Each part addresses a major area of the hows, whats, and whys of starting 
your own home-based business. The following is a summary of what you find 
in each part.
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning
For most people, starting a home-based business is a big undertaking. But 
every great journey begins with some small first steps. In this part, we take 
a look at what you need to know about starting a home-based business and 
take you on a tour of the very best home-based business opportunities for 
both today and tomorrow. We consider the basics of starting your own 
home-based business and the ins and outs of effective marketing. Finally, 
we discuss how to create a sustainable income in challenging times.

Part II: Managing Your Money
Money is the blood that keeps any business running: It allows you to pay for 
your supplies, your computer, and other equipment and makes it possible 
for you to put something aside for a rainy day. In this part, we take a close 
look at keeping track of your money and deciding what prices to charge your 
customers. We examine how to get health insurance and plan for your retire­
ment. We also take a look at how to use the tax laws to your advantage.
Part III: Avoiding Problems
Starting a business takes a lot more work than simply announcing to your 
neighborhood that you’re “in business.” You have to choose and register 
a business name, consider zoning regulations, and set up and equip your 
home office. In this part, we present the most common legal considerations 
for home-based businesspeople and discuss which kinds of business rela­
tionships are most important to establish and how you can establish them. 
Finally, we give you our best advice on avoiding scams and rip-offs.
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead
Creating a successful home-based business requires more than a good idea; 
you need the ability to separate your business from your personal life and to 
know when it’s okay to mix the two. In this part, you find out about how to 
make the Web work for you. And you discover tips for establishing a serious 
business attitude while ensuring that your business coexists peacefully with 
the people you share your home with. You also find out how to successfully 
grow your business, if you so choose.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this concise and lively set of condensed chapters, you can find tips to help 
start and maintain your home-based business. We show you how to succeed 
in your home-based business, which home-business opportunities we project 
will be good well into the future despite fluctuations in the economy, and 
what to do when times are tough.

tarting your own home-based business can be a very 
exciting time for you and for those around you. 
Before you can start on your journey, however, you need 
to take your first step. In this part, we tell you what you 
need to know about home-based businesses and delve 
into the questions of which business is best for you and 
what opportunities offer the greatest rewards. We explore 
the basics of starting your own business and then move

Chapter 1
What You Need to Know about 
Home-Based Businesses
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the basics of home-based businesses
▶	Taking a look at the pros and cons of having a home-based business
C
ongratulations! You’ve decided to start a home-based business. We 
welcome you as you join with millions of others who have already made 
the decision to start a home-based business. According to the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), there are more than 27 million businesses in the United 
States today. Of these businesses, 99.7 percent (or about 26.9 million) are 
small businesses (which the government defines as businesses with fewer 
than 500 employees). Of these, just more than half — 52 percent, or about 
13.5 million — are home-based businesses. Now that’s a lot of home-based 
businesses!
Take it from us: Owning your own home-based business may be the most 
rewarding experience of your entire life — and not just in a financial sense 
(although many home-based businesspeople find the financial rewards to be 
significant). Having your own home-based business is also rewarding in the 
sense of doing the work you love and having control over your own life.
Of course, every great journey begins with the first step. In this chapter, 
we provide you with an overview of this book, taking a look at the basics of 
home-based business — including getting started, managing your money, 
avoiding problems, and moving ahead. Finally, we consider some of the good 
news — and the bad — about starting your own home-based business and 
explain how to know when it’s time to make the move.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Looking at the Basics of 
Home-Based Business
Not surprisingly, a home-based business is a business based in your home. 
Whether you do all the work in your home or you do some of it on custom­
ers’ or third-party premises, whether you run a franchise, a direct-sales oper­
ation, or a business opportunity, if the center of your operations is based in 
your home, it’s a home-based business.
Each part of this book is dedicated to a specific aspect of starting and run­
ning your home-based business. In the following sections, we take a closer 
look at the topics we cover in the rest of this book.
Paul and Sarah’s journey home
Paul and Sarah began working from home 
before it was fashionable for anyone other than 
people in the construction trades, writers, art­
ists, and craftspeople to do so. In fact, the neigh­
bors wondered whether Paul was unemployed.
Sarah actually led the way home to set up a 
psychotherapy practice as a way of reduc­
ing the stress she felt in her prior government 
positions and to actively raise Paul and Sarah’s 
young son. Sarah said, “I didn’t feel I had many 
choices as a working mother. Juggling a suc­
cessful career and motherhood meant being 
exhausted most of the time and not being able 
to do either job with the dedication I wanted. 
I was determined, however, to have both a 
career and a family, so I did my best in a dif­
ficult situation.” Doing her best meant a trip 
to the hospital with a stress-related illness, 
during which the doctor told her she would die 
if she didn’t change her lifestyle — that was 
her wake-up call. She left her secure govern­
ment job and opened a private psychotherapy 
practice in her home. In the 25 years since, 
Sarah hasn’t regretted her decision for even 
one day.
For Paul, the decision wasn’t an easy one, and 
it took some time for him to get used to the idea 
of having a home-based business. “Initially, I 
was hesitant about working from home,” said 
Paul. “I had concerns about the image it might 
create and worried that I wouldn’t get my work 
done. So when I started my own consulting firm, 
I opened a downtown office and hired a sec­
retary.” As time went on, Paul spent less time 
at his downtown office and more time work­
ing at home. Eventually, he decided to close 
the downtown office altogether and invited his 
secretary to join him in his home office.
In 1980, Paul and Sarah decided to write a book 
about working at home. They wished such 
a book had existed for them when they got 
started. That book, Working from Home, is now 
in its fifth edition, and they’ve written 16 others.

 Chapter 1: What You Need to Know about Home-Based Businesses
Determining the kind of business 
you want to have
After you decide you’re going to start your own home-based business, you 
have to answer two questions: Exactly what kind of home-based business 
do you want to start, and what’s the best way to market your products or 
services?
You basically have two types of home-based businesses to choose from: 
businesses you start from scratch and businesses you buy. The latter cat­
egory is further split into three types: franchises, direct-selling opportunities, 
and business opportunities. Whether you prefer to march to your own drum­
mer and start your business from the ground up or get a business-in-a-box 
depends on your personal preferences.
	
The advantage of a business you start from scratch is that you can mold it to 
fit your preferences and the existing and emerging markets, which provides 
you with a boundless variety of possibilities. Businesses started from scratch 
account for the majority of viable, full-time businesses — in other words, they 
tend to be more successful over the long run than businesses you can buy. In 
their book Finding Your Perfect Work (Tarcher), Paul and Sarah provide char­
acteristics of more than 1,500 self-employment careers, along with hundreds 
of examples of unique businesses that people have carved out for themselves. 
If you have a business idea that doesn’t fit an existing category, you can get 
feedback on your business concept at www.conceptfeedback.com.
Each type of home business that you can buy, on the other hand, has its own 
spin. The following sections illustrate how the three types are different from 
one another.
Franchise
A franchise is an agreement in which one business grants another business 
the right to distribute its products or services. Some common home-based 
franchises include the following:
	
✓	Aussie Pet Mobile (mobile pet grooming)
	
✓	Jani-King (commercial cleaning service)
	
✓	Jazzercise (dance/exercise classes)
	
✓	ServiceMaster Clean (cleaning service)
	
✓	Snap-On Tools (professional tools and equipment)

12
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Direct selling
Direct selling involves selling consumer products or services in a person-
to-person manner, away from a fixed retail location. The two main types of 
direct-selling opportunities are
	
✓	Single-level marketing: Making money by buying products from a 
parent company and then selling those products directly to customers
	
✓	Multi-level marketing: Making money through single-level marketing 
and by sponsoring new direct sellers
Some common home-based direct-selling opportunities include the following:
	
✓	Shaklee (household cleaning products)
	
✓	The Pampered Chef (kitchen tools)
	
✓	Green Irene (green products and consulting)
	
✓	Longaberger Company (baskets)
	
✓	Mary Kay, Inc. (cosmetics)
	
✓	Fuller Brush Company (household and personal-care products)
Business opportunity
A business opportunity is an idea, product, system, or service that someone 
develops and offers to sell to others to help them start their own, similar 
businesses. With a business opportunity, your customers and clients pay 
you directly when you deliver a product or service to them. (Another way to 
think of a business opportunity is that it’s any business concept you can buy 
from someone else that isn’t direct selling or franchising.) Here are several 
examples of business opportunities that you can easily run out of your home:
	
✓	Astro Events of America (inflatable party rentals)
	
✓	Debt Zero LLC (debt settlement)
	
✓	ClosetMaid (storage and organizational products)
	
✓	Vendstar (bulk-candy vending machines)
Interested in how to find more companies and how to get in touch with them? 
Entrepreneur Media (www.entrepreneur.com) and www.gosmallbiz.com 
have extensive information on business opportunities you can buy. You can 
also do a search on Google (www.google.com), using the keywords business 
opportunity.

13
 Chapter 1: What You Need to Know about Home-Based Businesses
	
After you decide on a business, you have to find the money to get it started. 
Then you have to market your products or services and persuade people to 
buy them. You can choose conventional methods of promotion, such as adver­
tising and public relations, or you can leverage new selling opportunities, such 
as the Internet, to your advantage. Or you can (and probably should) do both. 
It’s your choice — you’re the boss! Check out the rest of Part I for more infor­
mation on choosing and marketing your business and on creating a sustain­
able income in challenging times.
Managing your money
Money makes the world go ’round, and because we’re talking about your 
financial well-being here, it’s very important that you have a handle on your 
business finances. To get the handle you need, do the following:
	
✓	Find the money you need to start your business. The good news is that 
many home-based businesses require little or no money to start up. If 
you decide to buy a franchise or business opportunity from someone 
else, however, you definitely need some amount of startup funding. To 
find this funding, consider all your options, including friends and family, 
savings, credit cards, bank loans, and more.
	
✓	Keep track of your money. In most cases, keeping track of your money 
means using a simple accounting or bookkeeping software package, 
such as QuickBooks, Quicken, or Microsoft Office Accounting, to orga­
nize and monitor your business finances.
	
✓	Set the right price for your products and services. If you set your 
prices too high, you’ll scare customers away; if you set them too low, 
you’ll be swamped with customers, but you won’t make enough money 
to stay afloat. Be sure to charge enough to cover your costs while gener­
ating a healthy profit.
	
✓	Obtain health insurance, and plan for your retirement. When you 
have your own business, you’re the one who needs to arrange for health 
insurance and set up IRAs, 401(k)s, or other retirement plans for the 
day when you’re ready to hang up your business and fade away into the 
sunset.
	
✓	Pay taxes. As someone famous once said, “The only things you can 
count on in life are death and taxes.” Well, taxes are a definite, so make 
sure you pay all the taxes you owe for your home-based business.
Check out Part II of this book for a lot more information on managing your 
money.

14
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Avoiding problems
Eventually, every business — home based or not — runs into problems. 
Whether the problems are being late on a delivery or hitting a snag with the 
Internal Revenue Service, as the owner of your own business, you need to 
avoid problems whenever possible and deal with them quickly and decisively 
when you can’t avoid them. Some of the problems you may deal with include 
the following:
	
✓	Legal issues: After a good accountant, the next best friend of any busi­
ness owner is a good attorney. Keep one handy to help you deal with 
legal issues when they inevitably arise.
	
✓	Issues with support services: Finding skilled and reliable outside sup­
port services — lawyers, accountants, bankers, business consultants, 
and insurance brokers — isn’t necessarily an easy task, especially if 
your business is in a small town where you’re pretty much stuck with 
what’s down the road.
	
✓	Scams and rip-offs: More and more home-based business scams seem 
to appear every day, so don’t rush into any business opportunity. Take 
your time and fully explore every opportunity before you sign on the 
dotted line. And remember, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is!
Move on to Part III to find out more about how to avoid problems in your 
home-based business.
Moving ahead
One of the best things about owning your own business is watching it 
develop, mature, and grow. After all, a growing business is the gift that keeps 
on giving — all year ’round, year after year. To keep your business moving 
ahead, consider doing the following:
	
✓	Make the Web work for you. Doing business and generating sales and 
interest in your business via the Internet is practically a given for any 
home-based business today. You can make the Web work for you in 
any number of ways, from starting a blog or Web site to networking 
with others through online forums or social networking sites, such as 
Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
	
✓	Maintain a serious business attitude. Just because your business is 
located at home instead of in a big office building downtown doesn’t 
mean you shouldn’t treat it like the business it is. While you can have 

15
 Chapter 1: What You Need to Know about Home-Based Businesses
fun and work all kinds of creative schedules, don’t forget that the busi­
ness part of your business is important, too; you have to treat your busi­
ness like a business if you hope to be successful.
	
✓	Look for ways to grow. For many businesses, growth can turn an opera­
tion that is doing well financially into an operation that is doing great! 
Growth allows you to take advantage of economies of scale that may 
be available only to larger businesses, to serve more customers, and 
to increase profits. For these reasons and more, growing your business 
should always be on your agenda.

Making the journey to independence
When Peter graduated from Stanford University 
with majors in human biology and economics, 
he had no idea what he wanted to do for work, 
aside from some vague notion that he should 
“get into business.” He worked a number of 
jobs, starting in the federal government as a 
contract negotiator and then moving into the 
private sector for many years as an admin­
istrative manager before ending up back in 
local government. As time wore on, working 
for others became less and less palatable to 
him, and becoming his own boss became a 
seductive proposition. In 1990, Peter was for­
tunate to be approached by his good friend 
Bob Nelson to write a book on the topic of 
negotiation. Although Peter had no real desire 
to write a book, a bit of gentle persuasion (and 
the promise of a $2,500 advance) helped bring 
him around. This first book, Negotiating to Win 
(Scott Foresman), started him on a new career 
as a business writer.
In time, Peter was able to seriously consider 
devoting himself fully to starting a home-based 
business as a professional writer. In 1997, he 
got the kick in the pants he needed to make the 
move when he was told that, thanks to funding 
cuts, he would be laid off from his local gov­
ernment job. And although a week later his 
employer found additional funds and asked him 
to stay, he already had one foot out the door, 
and there was no turning back.
Today Peter runs his own home-based writing 
business. He works harder than he ever has 
before but has the satisfaction of knowing that 
every bit of work he does has a direct payoff for 
him and his family — not some distant company 
owners or shareholders. But although he works 
harder than ever, he also gets to spend far more 
time with his wife and kids than he ever did 
before, and the commute to his office has been 
reduced from half an hour each way to about 30 
seconds. Is he happy? Yes. Would he go back to 
working a regular 9-to-5 job? Not on your life!

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Leaving your full-time job for 
your part-time business
An important, basic consideration that many home-based business owners 
face is whether or not to leave a full-time job in favor of a home-based busi­
ness. Before you give up your full-time job, ask yourself these questions:
	
✓	Has there been a steadily growing flow of new customers in your home-
based business?
	
✓	Has your business, even though it’s only been part-time, produced a 
steady flow of income through seasonal or other cycles typical of the 
business?
	
✓	Are you turning away business because of limits on your time? If not, do 
you think business would increase if you had the time to market or take 
on more customers?
Being able to answer at least two of these questions in the affirmative is a 
good sign that it would be safe to leave your full-time job. Of course, you 
should also be aware of any developments that could worsen the outlook 
for your business to grow, such as pending legislation, new technology, the 
movement of the kind of work you do outside the United States (outsourcing 
or cloud computing), or the decline of an industry your business depends on.
If your day job has been providing you the contacts you’ve needed to build 
your part-time business, you need to find ways to replace them before you 
leave your job.
Breaking the umbilical cord of a paycheck is an uncomfortable step for most 
people. So the closer the current income from your business is to the amount 
of money you need to pay your basic business and living expenses, the more 
confident you can be.
Examining the Good News and the Bad
Anyone can start a home-based business. You can be 10 years old or 100, 
male or female, rich or poor or somewhere in between, experienced in 
business — or not. According to a recent study by the Ewing Marion 
Kauffman Foundation, the median age of company founders is 40 years old, 
the majority (69.9 percent) were married when they started their first busi­
ness, and more than half (51.9 percent) were the first in their families to start 
a business.

17
 Chapter 1: What You Need to Know about Home-Based Businesses
So how do you know if starting a home-based business is right for you? Like 
most things in life, starting your own home-based business has both advan­
tages and disadvantages, but the good news is that the advantages probably 
outweigh the disadvantages for most prospective home-business owners. So 
in the spirit of putting your best foot forward, we start with the good news.
Good reasons to start a 
home-based business
When you start a home-based business, you may be leaving behind the rela­
tive comfort and security of a regular career or 9-to-5 job and venturing out 
on your own. Or you may be entering the world of work again after devoting 
many years of your life to raising a family. How far out you venture on your 
own depends on the kind of home-based business you get involved in. For 
example, many franchises provide extensive support and training, and fran­
chisees (the people buying the franchise opportunities — you, for example) 
are able to seek advice from experienced franchisees or from the franchisor 
(the party selling a franchise opportunity) when they need it. This support 
can be invaluable if you’re new to the world of home-based business.
At the other end of the spectrum, some business opportunities offer little or 
no support whatsoever. If you’re a dealer in synthetic motor oil, for example, 
you may have trouble getting the huge, multinational conglomerate that 
manufactures the oil to return your calls, much less send you some product 
brochures. And you won’t find any training or extensive, hands-on support if 
you run into the inevitable snags, either.
This wide variety of home-based opportunities brings us to the good news 
about starting and running your own home-based business:
	
✓	You’re the boss. For many owners of home-based businesses, just being 
their own boss is reason enough to justify making the move out of the 
9-to-5 work world.
	
✓	You get all the benefits of your hard work. When you make a profit, it’s 
all yours. No one else is going to try to take it away from you (except, 
perhaps, the tax man — see Chapter 9).
	
✓	You have the flexibility to work when and where you want. Are you 
a night owl (like Peter, who wrote these words at 4:58 a.m.)? Perhaps 
your most productive times don’t coincide with the standard 9-to-5 work 
schedule that most regular businesses require their employees to adhere 
to. And you may find that — because interruptions from co-workers are 
no longer an issue and the days of endless meetings are left far behind — 
you’re much more productive working in your own workshop than in a 

18
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
regular office. With your own home-based business, you get to decide 
when and where you work.
	
✓	You get to choose your clients and customers. The customers may 
always be right, but that doesn’t mean you have to put up with the ones 
who mistreat you or give you more headaches than they’re worth. When 
you own your own business, you can fire the clients you don’t want to 
work with. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it? (Believe us, it is!)
	
✓	You can put as much or as little time into your business as you want 
to. Do you want to work for only a few hours a day or week? No problem. 
Ready for a full-time schedule or even more? Great! The more effort you 
put into your business, the more money you can make. As a home-based 
business owner, you get to decide how much money you want to make 
and then pick out the kind of schedule that will help you meet your goal.
These reasons to start your own home business are just the tip of the ice­
berg. But when you add up everything, you’re left with one fundamental 
reason for owning your own home-based business: freedom.
	
Admittedly, starting a home-based business isn’t for everyone. In fact, for 
some individuals, it can be a big mistake. If, however, you have an entrepre­
neurial spirit, and you thrive on being independent and in charge of your life, a 
home-based business may be just the thing for you.
You have only one life to live. If you’re tired of working for someone else, 
being second-guessed by your boss, or having your creativity stifled, if 
you’re full of great ideas (ideas you know will lead you to success if you 
have the opportunity to put them into practice), or if you long for something 
better, we have a message for you: There is something better. It’s called a 
home-based business. When you find the business that’s right for you, it can 
change your life and the lives of those around you.
The pitfalls of owning your own 
home-based businesses
Starting a home-based business isn’t the solution to every problem for every 
person. Although many home-based businesses are successful and the 
people who started them are happy with the results, more than a few home-
based businesses end up causing far more headaches than their owners 
anticipated. Some home-based business owners even go bankrupt as a direct 
result of the failure of their businesses. Starting your own business is hard 
work, and there are no guarantees for its success.

19
 Chapter 1: What You Need to Know about Home-Based Businesses
So the next time you’re lying on your sofa, dreaming of starting your own 
home-based business, don’t forget to consider some of the potential pitfalls:
	
✓	The business is in your home. Depending on your domestic situation, 
working in your own home — a home filled with any number of distrac­
tions, including busy children, whining spouses or significant others, 
televisions, loaded refrigerators, and more — can be a difficult proposi­
tion at best.
	
✓	You’re the boss. Yes, being the boss has its drawbacks, too. When 
you’re the boss, you’re the one who has to motivate yourself to work 
hard every day — no one’s standing over your shoulder (except maybe 
your cat) watching your every move. For some people, focusing on work 
is very difficult when they are put in the position of being the boss.
	
✓	Health insurance may be unavailable or unaffordable. If you’ve ever 
been without health insurance for a period of time, or if you’ve been 
underinsured and had to make large medical or dental payments, you 
know just how important affordable health insurance is to your health 
and financial well-being. According to a recent study, 62.1 percent of all 
bankruptcies are medical related, and 92 percent of these debtors had 
medical debts of more than $5,000. Unfortunately, when you work for 
yourself, finding good health insurance isn’t a given. In fact, it can some­
times be downright difficult, depending on where you live and work. 
(Find out about the different health insurance options available to home-
based business owners in Chapter 8.)
	
✓	A home-based business is (usually) a very small business. As a small 
business, you’re likely more exposed to the ups and downs of fickle cus­
tomers than larger businesses are. And a customer’s decision not to pay 
could be devastating to you and your business.
	
✓	You may fail or not like it. No one can guarantee that your business is 
going to be a success or that you’re going to like the business you start. 
Failure may cost you dearly, including financial ruin (no small number of 
business owners have had to declare bankruptcy when their businesses 
failed), destruction of personal relationships, and worse. However, not 
all small businesses close because of financial problems. The Small 
Business Administration has found that at the time of closing, one out of 
three businesses is financially sound.
Regardless of these potential pitfalls, starting a home-based business remains 
the avenue of choice for an increasing number of people. Are you ready to 
join them?

Taking the Home-Based Business Quiz
Many people talk about starting home-based businesses, and many dream 
about becoming their own bosses. Making the transition from a full-time 
career to self-employment, however, is a big change in anyone’s life. Are you 
really ready to make the move, or should you put the idea of having your own 
home-based business on the back burner for a while longer?

and –5 for every D. Now tally up the numbers, and compare your results with 
the ranges of numbers below.
By comparing your total points with the points contained in each of the six 
following categories, you can find out whether you’re ready to jump into your 
own home-based business:
25 to 50 points: Assuming you were honest with yourself as you 
answered the preceding questions (you were, weren’t you?), you’re 
ready! What are you waiting for? There’s no time like the present to take 
the first step on your journey to success with your own home-based busi­
ness. Whether you decide to drop your day job or work into your new 
business gradually, you’re ready to give it your all. Read the rest of this 
book for tips on making your endeavor a raging success.

ture well under way. Read this book to get a better idea of how to make a 
relatively painless and successful transition from your present career to 
your own home-based business.
0 points: You can go either way on this one. Why don’t you try taking this

you begin your own home-based business.

23
 Chapter 1: What You Need to Know about Home-Based Businesses
–1 to –24 points: Unfortunately, you don’t appear to be quite ready to 
make the move from career to home-based business. We strongly rec­
ommend that you read this book and then take this test again in a few 
months. Maybe working for someone else isn’t the worst thing that can 
happen to you.
–25 to –50: Forget it. You were clearly born to work for someone else. 
Take this book and sell it to a co-worker.
Are you ready to make the move to starting a home-based business? If the

in the future. When you’re ready for them, they’ll be ready for you. If you’re 
ready now, congratulations! The rest of this book shows you what you need 
to do to make owning a successful home-based business a reality.
Keeping up with the scuttlebutt
Q: I’ve never regretted starting my own busi­
ness, but the one thing I do miss is being in the 
middle of the corporate buzz. How can I stay 
connected with what’s going on downtown?
A: You may be able to get connected without 
leaving your home by joining and participat­
ing in groups on social networking sites like 
LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. If social net­
working isn’t for you, the first step is to figure 
out just what you’re missing from being in the 
buzz of corporate life. Being part of the daily 
routine of an organization provides people with 
a whole array of experiences. Some, like office 
politics and dreadfully dull meetings, are a joy 
to get away from. But others, like the following, 
leave a void that you must find ways to fill:
	✓	Feeling like you’re part of the downtown 
business community: Even when you’re 
working from home, it’s important to get out 
of the house and participate in the business 
world. Join the chamber of commerce, and 
go to luncheons, after-work mixers, or eve­
ning meetings. Get active in various civic 
and charitable activities in your community. 
After all, they can lead to valuable business 
relationships while keeping you up with 
what’s going on in town.
	✓	Getting in on the inside information and 
latest scuttlebutt in your field: You can 
replace this need by becoming active in a 
local chapter of your professional or trade 
association or by participating in its online 
forum. To find professional and trade asso­
ciations in your field, do a Google search 
using the keyword association and the 
name of your field.
	
	 Though the Web isn’t a substitute for face-
to-face contact, beyond the social net­
working sites, you can use it to locate other 
individuals, networks, and organizations in 
your own community through, for example, 
the message board operated by a trade or 
professional group you belong to.
	✓	Establishing the esprit de corps from being 
part of a group that’s working together 
toward a common goal: If you crave group 
experiences, affiliate with others and work 
on joint projects instead of working strictly 
solo.
(continued)

24
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
(continued)
	✓	Finding moral support and positive peer 
pressure to stay focused — someone with 
whom to bounce ideas around, celebrate 
victories, and commiserate disappoint­
ments: To fulfill this need, form a group 
of colleagues with whom you can meet 
weekly over lunch and call regularly to spur 
one another on toward your goals.
	✓	Seeking out the expertise of superiors 
you can turn to for advice, getting honest 
feedback, or talking over strategies and 
crucial decisions: If you’re missing this 
type of interaction, seek out a mentor, form 
an advisory board for your business, or 
hire a consultant whose experience you 
respect. Some professional associations 
have formal mentor programs that offer this 
kind of contact. If yours doesn’t, suggest 
that it consider adding such a service — or 
even volunteer to help organize it.

S
o what do you do after you decide that starting a home-based business 
is right for you? First, you have to choose which kind of home-based 
business to start. Although on the surface making this decision may seem like 
a fairly easy proposition, for many people it isn’t. With thousands and thou­
sands of businesses to choose from, each with its own set of pros and cons, 
you may feel a little bit like a kid in a candy store. Not to mention, an oppor­
tunity that’s hot today can be as cold as a Minnesota winter tomorrow.
Before picking your business, research your options thoroughly. And above all, 
listen to your heart. Be sure that the opportunity is right for you — that it’s first 
and foremost something you will truly love doing — but at the same time that 
it’s going to provide the potential for long-term success. After all, we’re talking 
about your future here (and, perhaps, the well-being of you and your family), 
and what you do today to prepare for it will pay off in a big way down the road.
In this chapter, we take a closer look at the many different home-based busi­
ness options available to you. Be sure to turn to Chapter 17 for a look at ten 
particularly hot home-business opportunities.
Starting Something from Scratch
You probably find a certain amount of pleasure in making something out of 
nothing with your own two hands. It’s the same pleasure a sculptor gets from 
creating a beautiful piece of art or a violinist gets from mastering a difficult 

26
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
piece of music. You may not get it right the first time — after all, it took 
Thomas Edison thousands of tries before he hit on the right material for a 
successful light bulb filament — but when you do find the right formula for 
success, the feeling of satisfaction you experience is hard to beat.
Perhaps the quickest and least expensive way to start your own home-based 
business is to do so from scratch. No need to fill out a bunch of applications, 
save up money to buy into a franchise, or take weeks or months to learn some 
complex, proprietary way of doing business. If you really want to, there’s no 
reason why you can’t start your own business from scratch — right now. Your 
friends, relatives, neighbors, and co-workers are doing it, and you can, too.
	
A number of years ago, Peter’s wife, Jan, started a successful medical-billing 
business out of their home. She built it from scratch. After deciding to start her 
business, the first thing she did was create a simple flyer on the family computer, 
print 100 copies, and distribute them throughout the neighborhood. Although 
her original idea — and the offer in Jan’s flyer — was to do typing and desktop 
publishing, when her next-door neighbor, a psychologist, suggested that she 
take on the billing for his thriving practice, a new business was born! She soon 
took on the billing for several psychologists, and her little enterprise grew.
If you decide to start a home business from scratch, you’re in good company. 
Did you know that some of today’s largest, most successful companies were 
originally home-based businesses? Here are a few notable examples:
	
✓	Hewlett-Packard: With $538 in working capital, Bill Hewlett and David 
Packard started their fledgling company in Packard’s garage in Palo Alto, 
California. Today Hewlett-Packard is a multinational corporation with 
sales in excess of $118 billion a year.
	
✓	Apple Computer: In 1976, two members of Palo Alto, California’s 
Homebrew Computer Club — Steven Jobs and Stephen Wozniak — 
raised $1,300 by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen van and Wozniak’s Hewlett-
Packard programmable calculator to launch Apple Computer. The 
company — which began life in the garage of Steven Jobs’s parents’ 
home — today has annual revenues of more than $32 billion.
	
✓	Amazon.com: Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com, started his 
business in his rented, two-bedroom house in Bellevue, Washington. 
To make room for his new home-based business, Bezos converted his 
garage into a workspace. And to save money — of which he had pre­
cious little in those early days — he converted three wooden doors into 
desks, using some 2 x 4s, and a handful of metal brackets. The cost? 
Sixty dollars per desk. Today Amazon.com rakes in more than $19 billion 
a year — enough to pay for all the desks that Jeff Bezos would ever want 
to buy.

Of course, these home-based business success stories are exceptional, but 
many home-based business owners find exactly the level of success they’re 
seeking — while paying the bills, doing exactly the work they want to do, 
spending more time with loved ones, and serving the customers they want 
to serve. The real beauty of owning your own home-based business is that 
it’s first and foremost your business. When you start a business from scratch, 
you write the rules, and you decide what’s important. You may grow your 
business into the next Apple Computer, or you may simply enjoy a bit of 
extra income to supplement your earnings from a full-time career or other 
sources.
Here are a few examples of people who found exactly the level of success 
they were looking for by starting their own home-based businesses:
	
✓	Dan Dorotik of Lubbock, Texas, started his own successful business — 
Career Documents, a résumé-writing service — when he left his job to 
move to a different city with his fiancée and found himself out of work. 
“When I saw the money coming in, I realized that if you’re really good at 
something — and if you’re smart at the business and marketing side of 
it while maintaining the quality of the work — you can make a very good 
living for yourself,” said Dan.
	
✓	In 1998, former door-to-door fax machine salesperson Sara Blakely cut 
the feet off a pair of pantyhose to “look smashing” in a pair of slacks. 
A year later, she was awarded a patent for her footless body-shaping 
pantyhose, and, by 2000, she had created her own business — Spanx — 
with $5,000 in personal savings in the back of her apartment in Atlanta, 
Georgia. After earning scads of celebrity endorsements, including Oprah 
Winfrey, Drew Barrymore, Valerie Bertinelli, Marsha Cross, and others, 
Spanx now sells more than $350 million worth of its products a year.
	
✓	In high school and pregnant, Alexis Demko knew that she’d have to find 
some way to support herself and her child. So she started her El Cajon, 
California–based business — Demko Demolition Warehouse — which 
specializes in recycling and selling items such as light fixtures and cabi­
nets salvaged from building demolition projects. She has done so well 
with her business that at just age 20, she was named entrepreneur of the 
month by CosmoGIRL! magazine.
When starting a business from scratch, you can use one of two main 
approaches: Choose to do the same kind of work you’ve been doing in your 
regular job or career, or choose to do something totally different. In the fol­
lowing sections, we take a closer look at each approach and the advantages 
each one offers you.

Doing what you’ve been doing in a job
As you consider the different options available to you in starting your own 
business, one of your first thoughts will undoubtedly be to do what you’ve 
already been doing in your full-time job.
And why not? You know the job, you’re already experienced in the business, 
and you know exactly what to expect. You also know what your customers 
want and how to give it to them. You may even have a network of potential 
customers waiting to sign up for your products and services. Not surpris­
ingly, doing what you’ve been doing has several advantages, including the 
following:
	
✓	You can start up your business more quickly (like right now) and more 
easily than if you choose to do something you’ve never done before.
	
✓	You don’t have to spend your time or money on training courses or 
workshops, and you don’t have to worry much about a learning curve.
	
✓	You’ll be much more efficient and effective because you’ve already dis­
covered the best ways to do your job, along with time-saving tricks of 
the trade.
	
✓	You can capitalize on your good reputation, which may be your most 
important asset.
	
✓	You can tap in to your network of business contacts, clients, and custom­
ers (when ethically appropriate) and generate business more quickly than 
when you start something new and different (see Chapter 3 for more tips 
on turning your current business contacts into customers).

For many people, doing something they’ve been doing is the best choice. So 
because doing what you’ve been doing is often the quickest and least expen­
sive avenue for starting your own home-based business, be sure to take a 
close look at this option before you consider any others. And as you build 
your home-based business, check out SoloGig (www.sologig.com), a good 
source of temporary, contract, and freelance work opportunities in a wide 
variety of categories, to help you get started.
Doing something new and different
Although doing what you’ve been doing in a job offers many advantages, 
doing something new and different has its own set of high points. If you’re 
burned out on your current job and you dream of making radical changes in 
your career or lifestyle — for example, trading your high-pressure career as 
an attorney for a much more relaxing home-based massage business — doing 
something new and different may well be exactly what the doctor ordered.
The following are some key advantages of doing something new and different:
	
✓	Getting a fresh start in your career can be an extremely energizing expe­
rience with positive repercussions for every aspect of your life, opening 
up exciting new possibilities and opportunities for you along the way.
	
✓	Tapping in to new career options allows you to find work that may not 
have even existed when you first started your career — for example, 
designing Web sites or computer-network consulting.
Some facts about women-owned businesses
Here are some interesting facts from the 
National Association of Women Business 
Owners about the impact women-owned busi­
nesses are having in the United States today:
	✓	Just more than 10 million firms are 50 per­
cent or more owned by women, employing 
more than 13 million people and generating 
$1.9 trillion in sales as of 2008.
	✓	Seventy-five percent of all women-owned 
businesses are majority (51 percent or 
more) owned by women for a total of 7.2 
million firms, employing 7.3 million people 
and generating $1.1 trillion in sales.
	✓	Women-owned firms account for 40 per­
cent of all privately held firms.
	✓	One in five firms with revenue of $1 million 
or more is woman owned.
	✓	Three percent of all women-owned firms 
have revenues of $1 million or more com­
pared with 6 percent of men-owned firms.
Many women — and men — find that by start­
ing their own businesses, they become the 
bosses, and they get to decide how to run their 
businesses. Doesn’t everyone dream about one 
day being the boss and calling the shots?

Many successful home-based business owners have created businesses that 
have nothing to do whatsoever with what they’d been doing in their full-time 
jobs. If you’re sufficiently motivated, nothing can stand between you and suc­
cess, no matter which business you choose. If you’re looking to shake up the 
status quo or to make a break from the past, doing something completely new 
may well be the best option for you.
Buying a Business
For many people, buying a ready-made home-based business is the way to go. 
Instead of figuring out how to run a business the hard way — through trial 
and error — when you buy a business, you buy a proven product, system, 
and support organization. Of course, you have to pay for these benefits 
from the get-go, but the investment — if you make it wisely — can easily be 
eclipsed by the financial rewards of your new business.
	
As you consider the different home-based business opportunities available to 
you, keep the following tips in mind:
	
✓	Be sure you fit the business. Some franchises and network market­
ing opportunities require that you adhere to strict company rules and 
procedures, including the clothes you wear and the way you present 
yourself and your business. If you’re not comfortable with these kinds of 
restrictions, avoid such businesses.
	
✓	Be sure a market exists for the product or service you plan to offer. 
Talk to others who have bought the business you’re interested in, and 
ask them for their honest and candid feedback on the attractiveness 
of the opportunity. Don’t just rely on a list of happy people provided 
by the company — do some research, contact or visit owners at their 
places of business, and find people who may be more willing to tell you 
the real story.
	
✓	Be sure the company you select is credible and viable. This consider­
ation may very well be the most important one you make. Upward of 90 
percent of businesses that offer franchises, direct-selling opportunities, 
and business opportunities (all three of which we describe in the follow­
ing sections) go bust within five years, leaving their owners high and dry 
(and sometimes bankrupt and out of work). Be sure that any company 
you’re considering has been in business for five years or more.
The major categories of home-based businesses that you can buy are fran­
chises, direct-selling opportunities, and business opportunities, which we 
cover in the following three sections.

Home-based franchises
If you’ve ever eaten at a McDonald’s restaurant, you know what a franchise 
is. No matter which McDonald’s restaurant you visit, whether it’s in Iowa, 
England, or Hong Kong, you can be fairly certain that your cheeseburger and 
French fries are going to look, feel, and taste the same. In a place attracted 
to corporate icons such as the golden arches, franchising has taken the 
world of business by storm. According to a recent report published by the 
International Franchise Association (www.franchise.org), franchises 
employ more than 11 million people and produce more than $880 billion of 
economic output a year, just within the United States.
Four options for finding a new opportunity
Over the past two decades, Paul and Sarah 
have interviewed thousands of self-employed 
individuals to discover exactly how they found 
the paths that ultimately led them to their 
chosen destinations. As a result of these inter­
views, Paul and Sarah found that the roots for 
new businesses come from the following four 
sources and that successful home-based busi­
ness owners invariably tap in to one or more 
of them:
	✓	Talent: Each person has one or more innate 
talents or skills at which he or she excels. 
When you’re able to tap in to this talent or 
gift and when others value it and are willing 
to pay for it, developing a business around 
it can be rewarding, both financially and 
emotionally. About one in six home-based 
business owners become successful by 
taking advantage of their special talents or 
skills.
	✓	Mission: Those who follow a higher 
purpose — to make a positive difference in 
the lives of the people and the world around 
them — are following a mission. Although 
fewer than one in six people take this route 
in creating their home-based businesses, 
for those who do, the personal rewards of 
seeing the impact of their work on others 
can be profound.
	✓	Passion: For some home-based business 
owners, the passion they feel to be their 
own bosses or to pursue the work they truly 
love is so strong that it creates success in 
and of itself. For the person with a fire in his 
belly, no obstacle stands between him and 
the successful achievement of his goals. 
About one in four home-based business 
owners has chosen this path to success.
	✓	Assets: Everyone brings assets when start­
ing a home-based business. In some cases, 
these assets may take the form of previ­
ous work experiences; in other cases, they 
may take the form of a network of friends or 
business contacts. Although almost half of 
people who start home-based businesses 
tap in to their assets to do so — making it 
the most popular route by far — these busi­
nesses typically don’t fare as well as those 
based on talent, mission, or passion. Why? 
Assets by themselves don’t create excite­
ment, intensity of purpose, or motivation, and 
absent these kinds of emotions, the business 
owners don’t feel much drive to succeed.
As you review potential business opportuni­
ties, be aware of your own talents, mission, or 
passion, and keep them foremost in your mind 
because your success will be directly propor­
tional to the motivation you bring to your work.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Although popular franchises such as Subway, Liberty Tax Service, Ace 
Hardware, and Pizza Hut are easy to recognize, you probably can’t think of 
a popular home-based franchise. Although many home-based franchises are 
out there, you may not be aware that they’re available in an incredible array 
of sizes, shapes, and styles. From cleaning services to babysitting to photog­
raphy studios, home-based franchising opportunities cover a wide variety of 
businesses and can fit most anyone’s needs.
Defining a franchise
A franchise is an agreement in which one business grants another business 
the right to distribute its products or services. Typically, the company that 
grants the franchise has developed a successful and proven business model 
that others can easily replicate. According to franchising expert Gregory 
Matusky, three elements define a franchise company:
	
✓	Use of a trademark or a trade name
	
✓	Payment of fees or royalties
	
✓	Significant assistance provided by the franchisor
As the old saying goes, “It takes two to tango.” Similarly, every franchise 
agreement involves the following two key parties:
	
✓	Franchisor: The company that owns the franchise trademarks, trade 
secrets, and successful business model
	
✓	Franchisee: The individual or other entity who pays the franchisor for 
use of the trademarks, trade secrets, and successful business model
Ten ways to do what you love
Can you honestly say that you love your job? If 
not, have you ever thought about what you’d 
do for a living if you had the opportunity to do 
anything? Guess what? You do have the oppor­
tunity to do what you love! Millions of home-
based business owners are doing just that and 
creating incredible success for themselves 
in the process. Here are ten ways you can do 
what you love:
	✓	Provide a service to others who do what 
you love
	✓	Focus on doing just the things you love
	✓	Teach others to do what you love
	✓	Write about what you love
	✓	Speak about what you love
	✓	Create a product related to what you love
	✓	Sell or broker what you love
	✓	Promote what you love
	✓	Organize what you love
	✓	Set up, repair, restore, fix, or maintain what 
you love

33
 Chapter 2: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, What’s the Best Business of All?
Of course, all the trademarks, successful business models, and assistance 
come at a price. The franchisee pays fees to the franchisor in the form of one 
or more of the following:
	
✓	A one-time payment
	
✓	An ongoing flat-fee payment
	
✓	Ongoing sliding-scale payments
	
✓	Ongoing royalties
	
✓	Advertising fees
The fees that the franchisee pays to the franchisor vary considerably 
from opportunity to opportunity. For example, the initial fee to buy into a 
McDonald’s franchise is around $45,000. However, actual startup costs for 
a location (leases, building, equipment, labor, supplies, and so on) run from 
about $950,000 to $1.8 million. On top of those costs, franchisees are required 
to pay a royalty rate of 12.5 percent or more on every dollar they bring in. 
Despite all these fees, McDonald’s franchises — though certainly unsuitable 
for a home-based business — are considered to be among the most desirable 
of all franchises.
On the other hand, Jani-King, a popular home-based business franchise that 
specializes in commercial cleaning services, has an upfront franchise fee of 
between $8,600 and $16,300, startup costs of $11,000 to $35,000, and an ongo­
ing royalty rate of 10 percent. This investment is substantially more afford­
able than the bricks-and-mortar opportunity presented by a McDonald’s 
franchise, and you can run the business out of your own home. Of course, 
each franchise has its pluses and minuses — you have to decide which is 
best for you.

Tackling legal issues in franchising
As with many areas of business, franchising is chock-full of laws and regula­
tions. In addition to the usual bevy of federal laws, many states have their 
own stringent rules and regulations that supersede federal laws. Keep in 
mind that most franchising laws and regulations actually protect the franchi­
sor, not the franchisee! Here’s a look at the two main franchising documents 
you need to examine closely before you even think about buying a franchise:
	
✓	Franchise disclosure document: In states that don’t have their own 
specific franchising laws, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has 
established a comprehensive code of regulations that are often referred 
to as the franchise rule. As a part of the franchise rule, franchisors are 

34
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
required to provide prospective franchisees with a detailed disclosure 
statement, called the franchise disclosure document (FDD). Prior to 2007, 
this document was known as the uniform franchise offering circular 
(UFOC).
	
	Before you consider buying a franchise, be sure you get a copy of the 
company’s FDD and study it carefully. It contains valuable information 
that can have a dramatic impact on your decision to buy into a particu­
lar franchise opportunity. If you have any questions, ask the franchisor 
for clarification.
	
	An FDD contains the following valuable information, among other things:
 
• The franchisor’s name and address and a listing of any parent com­
panies or affiliates
 
• A complete and accurate description of the business
 
• A listing of executives and directors affiliated with the franchisor
 
• Background information on the franchisor and principals in the 
company, including business experience and track records
 
• Detailed information on the number of franchises, their failure rate, 
and their termination rate (Failure is a matter of closing a compa­
ny’s doors, usually for financial reasons. Some franchise operators 
prevent failure from happening by reacquiring the franchise from 
the franchise holder. The franchise is therefore terminated but 
technically not a failure, which helps keep the statistics about suc­
cess in franchising looking good.)
 
• Bankruptcy and litigation histories of the franchisor and principal 
officers
 
• Initial fees (including the franchise fee)
 
• Other fees (including royalties and other payments to be paid to 
the franchisor after the business is underway)
 
• Estimated initial investment
 
• An itemized list of goods and services that must be purchased, 
rented, or leased directly from the franchisor
 
• Availability and terms of franchisor-provided financing (if 
applicable)
 
• Restrictions on what you can sell and how you have to operate the 
business
 
• Assistance, advertising, computer systems, and training provided 
by the franchisor

35
 Chapter 2: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, What’s the Best Business of All?
 
• Information on the renewal, cancellation, and termination of the 
franchise
 
• The franchisor’s financial performance representations and finan­
cial statements
 
• Copies of contracts the franchisee has to sign
	
	For further information on franchising laws and regulations, consult 
your state attorney general’s office, or visit the FTC’s Web site at 
www.ftc.gov.
	
✓	Franchising agreement: Franchises depend on franchise agreements — 
contracts setting forth the rights and obligations of the franchisor and 
the franchisee — to define the legal relationship among all involved 
parties. A franchise agreement is negotiable. Be sure to read and under­
stand it thoroughly before you sign it. Even better, have a competent 
lawyer who specializes in franchise law take a look at it. Believe us: A 
few hundred bucks invested in a legal review upfront may save you 
many thousands of dollars (and countless headaches) down the road.
	
	Here are the most common elements of a franchising agreement:
 
• Grant of franchise: Defines the nature of the franchising 
agreement
 
• Use of trademarks, patents, and copyrights: Spells out exactly 
how you can use the franchisor’s trademarks, patents, and 
copyrights
 
• Definition of the parties: Lists the parties to the agreement and 
sets forth the independent relationship between the parties
 
• Payments: Spells out the franchise fee and any other required roy­
alties or payments
 
• Term of agreement: Enumerates the length of time that the 
agreement will be in effect (About half of all franchise agreements 
run for ten years, although a large percentage have five-year 
agreements.)
 
• Renewal of franchise agreement: Details the mechanism for 
renewing the agreement
 
• Development and opening: Details the length of time you have 
to open your business after signing the agreement, usually 90 to 
120 days
 
• Territory: Spells out any restrictions on the areas in which you 
may operate (Generally, the larger the territory, the larger the fran­
chise fee payable.)

36
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
 
• Advertising: Sets forth requirements for using the franchisor’s 
logos, advertising designs, trademarks, and so on in advertising
 
• Equipment and supplies: Spells out what supplies and services the 
franchisee must purchase directly from the franchisor
 
• Franchisor-provided training and assistance: Details the train­
ing that the franchisor offers, as well as any ongoing support and 
assistance
 
• Assignment of franchise: Describes any special rules for trans­
ferring ownership to another person or entity if the franchisee 
decides to sell the business
 
• Termination of franchise agreement: Sets forth the legal require­
ments for terminating the agreement
	
	Be absolutely sure that you understand every part of your franchising 
agreement — and agree with its terms and conditions — before you sign 
it. We don’t mean that you should just read it over and be generally famil­
iar with the opportunity; we mean understand exactly what every sen­
tence means and how it will impact the way you do business, as well as 
your rights and obligations now and in the future. You have your greatest 
leverage as you consider a variety of franchising opportunities — not after 
you sign your agreement.
The pros and cons of franchising
Buying a franchise brings potential positives and negatives. When deciding 
whether buying a franchise is the best way to start your own home-based 
business, weigh the pros and cons we discuss here, and discover the best 
path for you. Here are some of the elements that franchises often have in 
their favor:
	
✓	Buying into a franchise that has a proven track record and ongoing train­
ing and support can translate into a quick startup phase and almost 
immediate cash flow. And don’t forget: Happiness is a positive cash flow 
(see Chapter 6 for more about this idea).
	
✓	Established, successful franchises are proven systems that are almost 
guaranteed to meet your financial expectations. As long as you play the 
game by the franchisor’s rules, it’s hard to lose.
	
✓	A good franchisor provides extensive training in how to operate and 
market the business, which is a definite plus for those people who have 
never actually owned or run a business before.
	
✓	You have access to a network of other people who are in a business just 
like yours. Many franchisors sponsor special Web sites, conferences, or 

37
 Chapter 2: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, What’s the Best Business of All?
conventions that get franchisees together to talk shop and share their 
experiences.
	
✓	Many franchisors provide opportunities for regional and national coop­
erative advertising — saving you money while giving your business 
more exposure than you’d probably get on your own.
	
Of course, you also need to think about the downsides to buying a franchise. 
Before you sign on the dotted line of that franchise agreement, be sure you’re 
comfortable with these potential negatives:
	
✓	You have to follow the franchise’s policies and procedures whether you 
agree with them or not (which ultimately means the franchisor is the 
boss). If you don’t, you may be in violation of your franchise agreement — 
potentially resulting in nasty lawsuits, loss of income, and the termination 
of your business. For some prospective home-based business owners, the 
whole point of starting a business is to get away from following someone 
else’s rules.
	
✓	You work without a great deal of supervision and direction. No one’s 
going to get on the phone to wake you up if you’re late to work; no one’s 
going to constantly urge you to work harder or sell more. If you’re not a 
self-starter, or if you lack the confidence to sell yourself and your prod­
ucts or services, you may jeopardize your prospects for success by 
franchising.
	
✓	You may be required to pay an ongoing fee or royalty to the franchisor 
for the life of your business. Of course, if you’re making lots of money, 
these fees likely won’t be a problem. But if your business is marginal, 
franchise fees and royalties can quickly become an anchor that drags 
you and your business down with it.
	
✓	Franchises aren’t guarantees. Your business may or may not be a suc­
cess, despite all your hard work, all the money you invest, and all the 
time you devote to it. Any business is a risk, and a home-based business 
that you own makes that risk a very personal one.
	
✓	The franchise agreement may not protect you against competition from 
other distributors, particularly those using the Internet. Long story 
short, you may make less money than you thought or were led to believe 
you would.
What kind of people do best with franchises? Research indicates that a 
number of personality traits come into play, including a person’s influence 
with others, his willingness to comply with company rules, and his ability to 
think on his own two feet. To take a detailed test to see whether your per­
sonality traits match those of the people who have been most successful in 
franchises, check out Paul and Sarah’s book Home Businesses You Can Buy 
(Tarcher).

38
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
If you decide that franchising is something you’d like to explore further, thor­
oughly research all the possible opportunities to find the best fit for you. After 
you identify an opportunity that you want to pursue, talk to current owners of 
the franchise, and get their candid opinions of the opportunity — both the good 
and the bad. And be sure to see what kinds of information you can find about 
your prospective franchise on the Internet. Disgruntled franchisees often 
aren’t shy about telling others about their bad experiences, and some post 
their stories on the Web. Some even set up their own Web sites specifically to 
warn others. Just be sure that you take such stories with a grain of salt until 
you can verify that they’re indeed true.
	
Buying and operating a franchise will likely require a lot of money and a lot of 
your time and effort over a long period of time. It’s in your best interest to be 
absolutely sure — before you sign the franchise agreement — that it’s the best 
one for you.
Direct-selling opportunities
Direct selling means selling a consumer product or service in a face-to-face 
manner away from a fixed retail location. According to the Direct Selling 
Association (www.dsa.org), this kind of business has taken the world by 
storm. In a recent year, 15 million American men and women sold more than 
$30 billion worth of products through direct-selling opportunities. The kinds 
of products sold included home and family care products, such as cleaning 
supplies, cookware, and cutlery; personal care products, such as cosmetics, 
jewelry, and skin care products; wellness products, such as weight-loss prod­
ucts and vitamins; and leisure and educational products, such as encyclope­
dias, toys, and games.
The companies that offer direct-selling opportunities are household names: 
Nu Skin, Pampered Chef, Amway, The Fuller Brush Company, Tupperware, 
Nikken, Primerica, and many others.
I explain the two main types of direct-selling opportunities — single-level and 
multi-level marketing — along with their pros and cons in the following 
sections.
Single-level marketing
Single-level marketing is simple: A direct seller makes money by buying 
products from a parent organization and selling them directly to his or her 
customers. Home-based businesspeople have been pursuing single-level mar­
keting for years, and you probably recognize the names of some of the most 
successful organizations:

39
 Chapter 2: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, What’s the Best Business of All?
	
✓	Avon
	
✓	Electrolux
	
✓	Tupperware
	
✓	Kirby
Although much of the media spotlight that shines so brightly on the direct-
selling industry tends to focus on multi-level marketing organizations, single-
level marketing produces about 20 percent of direct-selling revenues, or just 
under $6 billion according to recent statistics.
Multi-level marketing
Multi-level marketing (also known as network marketing or person-to-person 
marketing) gives you two ways to make money — by buying products from 
the parent company and selling them to customers and by sponsoring new 
direct sellers and earning a commission from their efforts. From its humble 
beginnings in California in 1945, when Lee Mytinger and William Casselberry 
formed California Vitamins to sell their vitamin supplement (called Nutrilite), 
multi-level marketing has grown to an incredible $24 billion in sales a year in 
the United States alone, employing more than 10 million people.
What makes multi-level marketing special is its unique system of selling, in 
which salespeople take on the following two key roles:
	
✓	Distributor: As a distributor of a product, your job is to buy a product 
from the parent company and sell it directly to the public — usually to 
friends, relatives, and work associates. Every time you sell an item, you 
make a profit.
	
✓	Recruiter: As a recruiter, you sign up other distributors to work for you. 
Every time your distributor buys an item from the parent company, you 
receive a percentage of the profit.
As you sign up new distributors, you create what’s known as a downline: all 
the people you sponsor into the program, as well as the people they sponsor, 
and so on. In multi-level marketing, an upline is a distributor’s sponsor, as 
well as the other sponsors above him or her in the organization.
The most highly successful multi-level marketers make far more money 
through their downlines than they do actually selling products themselves. 
For this reason, many multi-level marketers focus most of their efforts on 
recruiting new distributors to join their downlines and motivating the indi­
viduals in their downlines to recruit new distributors.

Finding a home-based business that’s 
compatible with a military career
Q: I’m currently an active Navy member look­
ing for a business to take me out of the Navy. 
I need something with low startup costs and 
overhead — a business that could start as a 
part-time venture and bloom into something full 
time. I’ve been searching for a while. I appreci­
ate any suggestions.
A: Many full-time businesses can be started 
from home, on the side. In fact, part time is the 
preferable way to start out on your own. You 
can test the viability of your idea and go through 
the learning curve while you still have income 
from your full-time job coming in. The best side­
line businesses don’t require a lot of market­
ing or administrative tasks, leaving you free to 
devote your limited time to income-producing 
work. In other words, you want to choose a 
service or product that’s in high demand and 
easy to sell. Also, your business has to have 
flexible hours so you can run the business after 
or around your current working hours.
Whatever business you choose needs to be 
something you truly enjoy doing, something you 
know enough about to do well (or are willing to 
invest time learning while you still have a job), 
and something for which you can identify a spe­
cific market that you can easily reach.
Often the best solutions are quite unique to the 
business owner. For example:
	✓	A woman who wanted to be at home with 
her children had an inspiration: Because 
her husband collects bow ties, she decided 
to become a Web merchant selling hand­
made bow ties through the Internet.
	✓	An aerospace engineer had been an avid 
amateur photographer for years before 
starting a sideline photography business. 
By the time his full-time job was downsized, 
he already had a growing clientele in his 
side business.
These businesses certainly won’t work for 
everyone, but they were ideal matches for 
their owners. Look closely at your interests, 
skills, and assets, and think of how you can use 
them to meet the needs of specific individuals 
or companies who’d gladly pay for your help. 
You also need to pay attention to some factors 
that are particular to starting a business while 
on active duty. For one, if you live in military 
housing, you need to get permission to use 
your home for your business from your local 
command, although this permission is usually 
granted.
Also be sure you’re clear on the ethical limits of 
doing business with other members of the mili­
tary. Many military personnel go into business 
with their spouses so that their businesses get 
developed without conflicting with their mili­
tary duties. Keep in mind that soliciting to other 
members of the military of a junior ranking — 
including their spouses and dependents — is 
a no-no. Primarily, then, you may be building in 
the nonmilitary population. After you’re consis­
tently earning enough income from a part-time 
business to cover your bare-minimum living 
and business expenses, you’re ready to make 
the jump to full time. Find a detailed listing of 
military-spouse business advice and do’s and 
don’ts at www.military.com/spouse.

41
 Chapter 2: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, What’s the Best Business of All?
	
A multi-level marketing organization cannot only recruit distributors — and 
collect fees from them — without also selling products. Such an arrangement 
is called a pyramid scheme, and it’s against U.S. law. A pyramid scheme is set 
up specifically to make its creators rich while relieving everyone else of their 
hard-earned money. Be particularly careful about so-called opportunities in 
which you sell something that has little or no intrinsic value, such as a “spe­
cial” report on how to make money on the Internet. Such thinly veiled pyramid 
schemes will land you in very hot water if you’re caught.
The pros and cons of direct selling
According to the enthusiastic sales pitches of recruiters for many direct-sell­
ing opportunities, signing up to sell their products will put you squarely on 
the road to riches. Although you may very well turn out to be highly success­
ful (every direct-selling opportunity has its successes, often people who get 
into the business early and establish a large multi-level marketing downline), 
you also may not. Of course, no kind of business can guarantee profits — 
direct selling included — but direct selling does have its advantages.
Direct-selling opportunities are geared to the home-based businessperson, 
and the right opportunity may be just what you’re looking for. Here are some 
of the positive attributes of direct selling:
	
✓	Because startup costs are generally low, you have little financial risk if 
the business fails — certainly lower than most franchises and business 
opportunities. (Beware of direct-selling opportunities with high startup 
costs — they’re often scams! Check out Chapter 12 for tips on how to 
elude these scams.)
	
✓	High earning potential is possible (although relatively few people actu­
ally make six-figure incomes). Mary Kay, Inc., really does give out pink 
Cadillacs to its top salespeople, for example. If you’re the right person in 
the right place at the right time, the sky really is the limit.
	
✓	Most direct-selling programs are designed specifically to be home-based 
businesses and are often geared to women (89 percent of U.S. direct 
sales businesses are one-person distributorships, and 88 percent of all 
direct sellers in the country are women).
	
✓	Your direct-selling parent company generally provides you with sales 
and promotional materials, as well as bookkeeping, sales tracking, and 
commission data.
	
✓	You can work as many or as few hours as you like. All kinds of work 
arrangements — part time and full time — abound in direct selling. In 
fact, the clear majority of people who have chosen direct-selling oppor­
tunities work part time, some while working other, full-time jobs.

42
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
Because of the need to continuously recruit a downline of new distributors in 
multi-level marketing — to replace those who fall by the wayside, as well as to 
grow organizations — competition for recruits can be quite lively. This intense 
competition tends to put a lot of pressure on the people being recruited. Aside 
from these kinds of minor indignities, you may experience a number of other 
negatives with direct selling. Here are just a few:
	
✓	Many direct-selling businesses are here today, gone tomorrow. Although 
a number of companies have been around for years and will likely be 
around for years to come (including such companies as Amway, which 
celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009, and Mary Kay, Inc., which has 
been in business since 1963), far too many direct-selling firms have life 
spans you can measure in months.
	
✓	Direct selling has a poor reputation with many people, often making 
recruiting new distributors (and selling products) a difficult proposition.
	
✓	Motivating your downline to sell more products and sign up new dis­
tributors can require more of your time and attention than you may 
imagine. Plus, the more distributors you sign up, the bigger the job.
Is that direct-selling opportunity real or not?
As with any other business you may be consider­
ing, check out a direct-selling opportunity before 
making a commitment. Unfortunately, direct sell­
ing has a bit of a reputation for being fraught 
with less-than-reputable opportunities and — in 
some cases — outright fraud. The Direct Selling 
Association (DSA) at www.dsa.org offers the 
following advice for checking out any direct-
selling opportunity before buying into it:
	✓	Identify a company and a product that 
appeal to you. Check the DSA list of 
member companies, or look in your local 
phone book.
	✓	Take your time deciding. A legitimate 
opportunity won’t disappear overnight. 
Think long-term.
	✓	Ask questions. Ask about the company and 
its leadership, products or services, startup 
fees, realistic costs of doing business, 
average earnings of distributors, return 
policies, and anything else you’re con­
cerned about. Get a copy of all company 
literature — and read it!
	✓	Consult others who have had experiences 
with the company and its products. Check 
to see whether the products or services are 
actually being sold to consumers.
	✓	Investigate and verify all information. Don’t 
assume that official-looking documents are 
accurate or complete or even produced by 
the company, as opposed to the person 
trying to recruit you. Have an attorney take 
a look at the documents to verify them.
	✓	Get help evaluating the company. Check 
the list of Direct Selling Association mem­
bers at www.dsa.org, or call your local 
better business bureau, state attorney gen­
eral, or consumer-protection offices.

43
 Chapter 2: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, What’s the Best Business of All?
	
✓	Few people in direct selling make enough money to make it a full-time 
profession. According to industry figures, about 90 percent of the 
individuals working in direct sales do so on a part-time basis. Of this 
number, about half make $500 or less a year in direct sales; the other 
half make up to $5,000 a year. Rarely do direct salespeople make enough 
money in their own businesses to support themselves and their families.
	
✓	Friends, relatives, and co-workers may quickly tire of your constant 
attempts to sell them products or recruit them into your downline. If 
they cross the street or duck behind a tree when they see you coming, 
you’re pushing too hard.
Business opportunities
If the ready-made company you’re thinking of buying into isn’t a franchise 
and isn’t direct selling, chances are it’s a business opportunity. While fran­
chises and direct-selling opportunities have well-defined, unique structures, 
business opportunities come in all flavors, shapes, and sizes. In general, 
however, a business opportunity is an idea, product, system, or service that 
someone has developed and offered to sell to others to help them start their 
own, similar businesses.
Business opportunities can take many forms, but they all fall into one or 
more of the following eight categories:
	
✓	Broker: A broker is someone who buys or sells products or services for 
a parent company, often acting as an agent. Common examples include 
real estate and insurance brokers. Although brokers are independent 
contractors, the parent company generally pays them commissions for 
their efforts.
	
✓	Dealer: Dealers represent lines of products, which are purchased from a 
parent company and sold directly to consumers. An example of a dealer 
is someone who sells windows or wooden doors that are produced by 
several different companies to local home builders and who uses his or 
her home as a base of operations.
	
✓	Distributor: Distributors buy products from wholesalers (and some­
times from manufacturers) and resell them to direct-sales organizations, 
brokers, and dealers. Distributors generally don’t sell directly to con­
sumers or end users.
	
✓	Licensee: Licensees buy the right to sell, market, produce, or use estab­
lished product brand names, technologies, or systems. A bit like a fran­
chise, licensees have much greater freedom to run their businesses as 
they see fit.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
✓	Mail-order business: Mail-order businesses take orders for products 
(and, in rare cases, services) over the phone or via e-mail or the Internet 
and send those products to end users. In some cases, mail-order busi­
nesses can have products shipped directly (sometimes called drop 
shipped) from their manufacturers, removing the need to maintain a 
product inventory and dramatically improving cash flow.
	
✓	Vendor: Vendors sell materials and supplies to other companies for 
their own consumption (office supplies, for example), for use in their 
own production processes (titanium ingots, for example), or for resale 
to consumers or other companies.
	
✓	Manufacturer: Manufacturers build and produce products that are even­
tually sold to consumers. Manufacturers can sell directly to consumers 
in a variety of ways (direct sales, mail order, or the Internet) or to bro­
kers, dealers, wholesalers, and others.
	
✓	Wholesaler: Wholesalers buy products directly from manufacturers, 
mark up the price, and sell them to retailers — the people who deal 
directly with the end consumer. In most cases, wholesalers don’t sell 
directly to the public.
Although some of these categories overlap to some degree, each represents a 
unique facet of the total universe of business opportunities available to you. 
As you can imagine, the kind of business opportunity you select has a signifi­
cant influence on how you do business, to whom you sell, and the way you 
market your products and service your customers.
For many people, business opportunities are exactly the right choice for a 
home-based business. But is a business opportunity the right choice for you? 
Take a look at the pros and cons of business opportunities, and decide for 
yourself. The following advantages make business opportunities attractive 
propositions:
	
✓	Business opportunities aren’t as strictly managed by parent companies 
as are franchises or multi-level marketing businesses. This relaxed man­
agement gives you substantial independence and freedom to run the 
business as you see fit.
	
✓	Many business opportunities offer good, steady income. The upside may 
not be as dazzling as some multi-level marketing opportunities, but the 
chances of your succeeding on a full-time basis are much greater.
	
✓	Many business opportunities are suitable as home-based businesses.
	
✓	Startup costs are generally far less than most franchising opportunities.
	
✓	You can work whatever hours you want to — part time or full time. 
Many people pursue a home-based business opportunity while maintain­
ing a full-time job.

45
 Chapter 2: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, What’s the Best Business of All?
	
Of course, business opportunities also have their potential problems. 
Consider the following cons before you sign on the dotted line:
	
✓	The independence of most business opportunities can be a disadvan­
tage if you don’t already have some experience in sales or in running 
your own business. Few business opportunities provide the level of sup­
port that good franchises or direct-selling opportunities do.
	
✓	The federal government offers little regulation of business opportuni­
ties, and state and local regulations vary. Beware of scams — you can 
find plenty! If something sounds too good to be true (getting rich stuffing 
envelopes or clicking Web sites), it probably is.
	
✓	Most owners of legitimate business opportunities work far harder than 
they ever did in their regular 9-to-5 jobs. Chances are, you will, too.
	
✓	Your business opportunity may fail. Be sure to have the financial 
resources available (in other words, sufficient savings in the bank) to 
weather a serious business setback or misfortune.
	
As with any other business, thoroughly explore all your options before you 
invest your hard-earned money in a particular business opportunity. Most 
business opportunities require little in the way of an upfront payment — so 
even if things don’t work out how you planned, you can change course and 
give a different one a try.
Identifying Which Option Is Best for You
Between creating your own business from scratch and buying a business, 
you can find an amazing array of options and opportunities. In fact, all your 
choices may be a little overwhelming. How do you decide which option is the 
best one for you and make sure you don’t make the wrong choice?
Although you can’t be 100-percent sure how a particular path will turn out 
until you embark on it, you can use the following indicators to help you gain 
a better sense of which option is the best one for you to pursue:
	
✓	How strong your desire to sell is: Some people naturally love to sell. 
Do you? Most direct-sales and business opportunities require a lot of 
selling — no sale, no income. Does the opportunity you’re considering 
(and the style of selling you have to adopt to be successful) fit with your 
natural selling ability and desire? If not, this option may not be the best 
one for you.

46
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
✓	What ideas you already have: You may already have some ideas about 
the business you want to start and how you want to run it. You have 
more freedom to pursue your own unique ideas if you start it from 
scratch or if you pursue a business opportunity. Franchises and-direct 
selling opportunities generally require that you closely follow the parent 
company’s established system.
	
✓	How independent you are: Do you relish the idea of being your own 
boss and calling your own shots, or do you want to have the comfort 
that comes from following someone else’s direction? Either approach is 
fine, so long as it matches your personality. When you start a business 
from scratch or buy into a business opportunity, you really are your 
own boss, which means you’re pretty much on your own when it comes 
to running your business. Most franchises require that you follow strict 
policies and procedures and take direction from the parent company. 
Direct-selling organizations are usually somewhere in between. You 
won’t find a right or wrong answer here — you have to assess which 
situation you’re most comfortable with.
	
✓	How much money you want to make: Do you just want a little extra 
money for a rainy day, perhaps on a part-time basis? Or do you want to 
make enough money to pursue your business full time? Your answers 
to these questions point you toward certain businesses and away from 
others (for example, about half of the people in direct-selling opportuni­
ties, such as Avon or Mary Kay, Inc., make $500 or less a year).
	
✓	How unique you want to be: Do you want to stand out from the crowd, 
or would you be happier blending into a well-established corporate 
identity? Starting a business from scratch allows you to be as unique as 
you want to be. Franchises, direct-selling opportunities, and business 
opportunities allow you to closely affiliate with an established corporate 
identity.
	
✓	How much control you want: Different business options have dramati­
cally different levels of control. Starting a business from scratch may put 
you in full control, while buying a franchise may give you little control 
over how the business is marketed and run. Be sure that you’re aware 
of the level of control you want and that the business you choose 
provides it.
	
✓	What your long-term goals are: Is your goal to make lots of money? 
Meet interesting people? Work as little as you possibly can? Retire 
early? Whatever your long-term goals are, make sure the opportunity 
you select is compatible with and helps you achieve them. Check with 

47
 Chapter 2: Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, What’s the Best Business of All?
other people who have invested in your prospective opportunity, and 
see where they are in their lives. Were they able to leave their careers 
behind? Are they now independent and able to have that little cabin on 
the lake that they always dreamed of? Were they able to retire early? 
Make sure you find out the reality behind the sizzling sales pitch for 
your particular opportunity before you jump head first into it.
Finding Your Niche by Specializing
People need to know exactly what business you’re in. If you try to be every­
thing to everybody, you’ll end up pleasing precious few customers. The best 
way to avoid this situation is to find a business niche and specialize in it. An 
expert is worth a lot more to clients than someone without specific experi­
ence. Would you rather have your silk shirt cleaned by someone who has 
years of experience working with silk or by the local laundromat? Chances 
are you’re willing to pay more for someone who specializes in cleaning your 
delicate (and expensive) silk shirt.
	
In business, people want to work with people who know what they’re doing. 
So you need to be one in a million, not one of a million, which often means you 
need to specialize.
Follow these eight steps to find your business niche by specializing:
	
1.	Assess and outline your current expertise.
	
2.	Identify your strengths and weaknesses.
	
3.	Build on your strengths, and fill in the gaps in your experience.
	
4.	Articulate a point of view (in writing) for how you work.
	
5.	Collect evidence to support your point of view.
	
6.	Review and begin documenting your experience.
	
7.	Identify the patterns suggested by your experience.
	
8.	Explain (in writing to yourself) what you’ve discovered.
As your expertise increases, you make yourself easier to market and, thus, 
are able to make more money. The specialist pyramid, which appears in 
Figure 2-1, shows the relationship between expertise and money.

O
ne of the biggest obstacles lying in the way of many prospective 
home-based business owners is a very simple but very important 
question: What are you going to live on while you get your new business off 
the ground? Money doesn’t grow on trees (at least not yet), and, to ensure 
the long-term success of your business, you have to start with sufficient 
income — from whatever source — to pay your bills.
Seven out of every ten Americans at some time in their lives decide they want 
to start and own their own businesses. Yet, most of them don’t. Why not? In 
many cases, they’re afraid they don’t have enough money to do it. The fact is, 
although certain home businesses require a significant investment in equip­
ment and inventory, many home-based businesses require little or no money 
to start. But aside from startup costs, you have to put in a lot of work and 
careful planning to build a business that will pay the bills over the long run, 
which is why understanding the right ways (and the wrong ways) to transi­
tion into your own business is so very important.
In this chapter, we review the steps for transitioning to a home-based 
business — specifically, what you need to do before you leave your day job 
behind (or before you’re laid off or retired). We cover how to secure financ­
ing and where to find the money you need. And, finally, we show you how to 
develop an effective business plan.

50
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Transitioning into Your 
Home-Based Business
Starting your own business is exciting. For those people who have spent all 
their working lives employed by someone else, it’s often the culmination 
of a dream that’s lasted for years or even decades. Imagine the power and 
personal satisfaction you’ll feel when you realize you’re the boss and you 
call the shots — from setting your own work schedule, to deciding how to 
approach your work, to choosing your computer and office furniture. Believe 
us, it’s a feeling you won’t soon forget.
But there’s a right way and a wrong way to make the move. Your goal is to 
make sure you maintain a sufficient supply of cash to pay the startup costs of 
your business while paying for the rest of your life — the mortgage or rent, 
the car loans, the health insurance, the gas and electric, your daughter’s 
piano lessons, and the list goes on and on.
	
The fact is, few businesses — home based or otherwise — within the first 
six months of operation bring in all the money necessary to get them off the 
ground and keep them going for a prolonged period of time. In other words, 
you need a lot of cash — from a job, your spouse or partner’s job, your sav­
ings, or loans from friends, family, or a bank — to keep both your business 
and your personal life going until the business generates enough revenue to 
take over.
Although you have to decide for yourself exactly what schedule to follow 
while transitioning into a home-based business, unless you’re unemployed or 
retired, we generally recommend that you start your business on a part-time 
basis while you continue to hold down your regular full-time job. Why? For a 
number of reasons, including the following:
	
✓	You can develop and test your new business with virtually no risk — you 
still have your regular job to fall back on if your new business doesn’t 
work out (and remember, no matter how great your business idea is, 
there’s a chance it won’t work out).
	
✓	You aren’t under the intense pressure to perform and show the results 
that you’d have to show if your new business were your only source of 
income.
	
✓	You can keep your established health insurance, retirement plan, time 
off, and other benefits. Given the difficulty and expense of securing a 
decent healthcare plan when you’re on your own and not under the 
umbrella of your employer, healthcare alone may be reason enough to 
keep your day job while you start your own business.

51
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Starting Your Own Business
	
✓	You have a steady source of income you can use to pay your bills while 
you establish your new business.
	
✓	You may be able to take advantage of tax benefits, like the ability to 
write off early losses against income (see Chapter 9 for more on taxes 
and deductions).
	
✓	You have a stronger basis for obtaining bank loans and other financing 
for your new business.
Of course, the decision is ultimately up to you. When starting a home-based 
business, follow your heart and make sure the transition fits into your sched­
ule and your life.
In the following sections, we take a close look at six steps you need to take 
before you leave your regular job to devote all your time and energy to being 
your own boss. We also walk through the different steps involved in the pro­
cess of establishing your home-based business.
Knowing what to do before 
leaving your day job
After you’re consistently earning enough income from your part-time, home-
based business to cover your bare-minimum living and business expenses, 
you’re ready to make the jump to a full-time commitment of your time and 
attention. Before you turn in your resignation, however, take the following six 
steps:
	
1.	 Find out when any company benefit plans you have will vest or 
increase in value. If you have a 401(k) or other retirement plan to which 
your employer has been contributing, it may not be fully available to 
you until you’ve served a particular number of years of service. Finding 
out this information may help you determine the best time to resign. It’d 
be a shame, for example, if you quit two weeks before the value of your 
retirement benefits was set to jump from 80 to 100 percent of your cur­
rent salary.
	
2.	 Find out when you can expect to receive any bonus money or profit 
sharing. You may, for example, be slated to receive an annual perfor­
mance bonus or profit sharing a month after the end of the company 
fiscal year. This information can help with the financial planning for your 
home-based business because it lets you know when you’ll have the 
money available to help you get your business off the ground.

52
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
3.	 Get all annual health exams, have all routine procedures done, and 
fill all prescriptions while you and your family are still covered by 
your medical/dental/vision insurance. Check to see whether you can 
convert your group coverage to an individual policy at favorable rates or 
what other health coverage options are open to you. (Some group plans 
can be converted, but be very careful about changes in coverage, co-
pays, and deductibles that may actually end up costing you much more 
money in the long run.) See Chapter 8 for more on healthcare options 
for the self-employed.
	
	 Don’t forget that if you work in the United States, you’re likely covered 
by COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1985), which requires your employer to allow you to continue your iden­
tical group health coverage for a period of 18 months or more. However, 
qualified individuals may be required to pay the entire premium for cov­
erage up to 102 percent of the cost to the plan.
	
	 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provides 
for premium reductions and additional election opportunities for health 
benefits under COBRA. Eligible individuals pay only 35 percent of their 
COBRA premiums and the remaining 65 percent is reimbursed to the 
coverage provider through a tax credit. The premium reduction applies 
to periods of health coverage beginning on or after February 17, 2009, 
and lasts for up to nine months for those eligible for COBRA during the 
period beginning September 1, 2008, and ending December 31, 2009, as a 
result of an involuntary termination of employment that occurred during 
that period.
	
4.	 If you own a house and you need some extra cash to help you through 
the transition, consider taking out a home equity line of credit or 
other loan before leaving your current job. Having a line of credit or 
loan to draw upon can be invaluable during the first two years of your 
new business, and your chances of getting approved for it are much 
greater while you’re employed in a regular job. That’s right — after you 
leave your job, you probably won’t qualify for a line of credit or other 
loans for your business until your business has been successful for two 
or more years.
	
5.	 Pay off or pay down the balance on your credit cards while you still 
have a steady job. Doing so helps your credit rating (always a good 
thing) and provides you with another source of potential funds to help 
you finance various startup costs (and depending on the nature of your 
business, you may have plenty of those!).
	
6.	 Take advantage of training and educational opportunities, confer­
ences, and meetings that can result in preparation or contacts that 
will prepare you for your own business. Doing so enables you to hit the 
ground running when you decide it’s time to start your own business.

53
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Starting Your Own Business
	
Don’t make your announcement or submit your resignation until you’re really 
ready to go. Some companies are (sometimes justifiably) paranoid about soon-
to-be former employees stealing ideas, proprietary data, or clients, which can 
make for a very hasty exit, with a personal escort, when you do resign.
After completing these steps, you’re ready to take what may well be one of the 
most significant steps forward you’ll ever take in your life: starting your own 
home-based business. For those about to embark on this path, we salute you!
Understanding what you have to do to 
start your own home-based business
In the sections that follow, we go through exactly what you need to do to 
start up your own home-based business. We cover these topics in much 
greater detail in Chapters 4, 6, 10, and 11.
Your odds of success are better than you think
A lot of bad information about how long busi­
nesses (including home-based businesses) 
can be expected to survive after founding has 
circulated throughout the business community. 
Almost everyone has heard this particular stat: 
95 percent of the businesses started in any 
given year will be gone within five years.
Guess what? It’s not true. In reality, most home-
based businesses survive for five years or more 
after their founding. According to surveys con­
ducted by IDC/LINK, an average of only 5 per­
cent of home-based businesses drop out each 
year. So after five years have gone by, only 
25 percent of home-based businesses have 
dropped out — far less than the average for 
all businesses, which can be over 50 percent! 
How, then, can you ensure that your home-
based business thrives and doesn’t become an 
unfortunate statistic?
The Small Business Administration (SBA) has 
uncovered four key indicators of business suc­
cess. They are
	✓	Sound management practices: Including an 
ability to manage projects, handle finances, 
and communicate effectively with customers
	✓	Industry experience: Including the number 
of years you’ve worked in the same kind 
of business you intend to start and your 
familiarity with suppliers and potential 
customers
	✓	Technical support: Including your ability to 
seek and find help in the technical aspects 
of your business
	✓	Planning ability: Including an ability to set 
appropriate business goals and targets and 
then create plans and strategies for achiev­
ing them
If you, or the combination of you and a partner, 
possess all four traits, the probability of your 
business succeeding is much higher than if 
you’re missing one or more of these traits. If 
you’re missing any of these traits, find people 
who can help you fill in the gaps.

54

Develop a business plan
Despite what you may read on many small business Web sites or blogs, many 
home-based business owners can get by without drafting a business plan. 
Indeed, just the thought of having to draft a 50-page tabbed and annotated, 
multipart business plan is enough to scare many potential home-based busi­
ness owners away from their dreams. Truth be told, most business owners 
today use their business plans to obtain financing from third parties, such as 
banks or investors, and many successful businesses — home based or not — 
have been started without one. That said, the process of drafting a business 
plan can be very beneficial — both to you as a business owner and to your 
business. Taking the time to draft a plan helps you do the right things at the 
right time to get your business off the ground; plus, it forces you to think 
through what the challenges will be and what you can do about them before 
they overwhelm you.
In essence, a good business plan
	
✓	Clearly establishes your goals for the business
	
✓	Analyzes the feasibility of a new business and its likelihood of being 
profitable over the long haul
	
✓	Explores the expansion of an existing business
	
✓	Defines your customers and competitors (very important people to 
know!) and points out your strengths and weaknesses
	
✓	Details your plans for the future
	
Even if you think your business is too small to have a business plan, it’s really 
worth your time to see what it’s all about — the process of developing the 
plan for your business will produce a clarity of thought that you can’t find 
any other way. See the “Putting Together a Business Plan” section later in this 
chapter for details on developing an effective business plan.
Consult outside professionals
As a new home-based businessperson, you need to consider establishing 
relationships with a number of outside professionals — trained and experi­
enced people who can help you with the aspects of your business in which 
you may have little or no experience. By no means do you have to hire some­
one from each category I describe in this section. But if you run into ques­
tions that you can’t easily answer yourself, don’t hesitate to call on outside 
professionals for help as you go through the business startup process (and 
be sure to check out Chapter 11 for detailed information on this topic).
	
Any professional advice you get at the beginning of your business may well 
save you heartache and potentially expensive extra work down the road.

55
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Starting Your Own Business
Here are just some of the outside professionals you may choose to consult as 
you start your home-based business:
	
✓	Lawyer: An attorney’s services are an asset not only in the planning 
stages of your business, but also throughout its life. An attorney can 
help you choose your legal structure, draw up incorporation or part­
nership paperwork, draft and review agreements and contracts, and 
provide information on your legal rights and obligations. Look for an 
attorney who specializes in working with small businesses and startups.
	
✓	Accountant: Consult an accountant to set up a good bookkeeping 
system for your business. Inadequate recordkeeping is a principal con­
tributor to the failure of small businesses. Regardless of how boring or 
intimidating it may seem, make sure you understand basic accounting 
and the bookkeeping system or software you’re using, and don’t forget 
to closely review all the regularly produced financial reports related to 
your business (and make sure you actually receive them!).
	
✓	Banker: The capital requirements of a small business make establishing 
a good working relationship with a local banker absolutely essential. For 
example, bankers can approve immediate deposit of checks that would 
normally be held for ten days. They’re also good sources of financial 
information — and for obtaining cash to tide you over when times are 
tough or financing expansion of your business when times are good.
	
	We recommend establishing a relationship with your banker before 
applying for a loan, not after you decide to initiate the loan process. This 
relationship may make the difference between getting approved for the 
loan you need and being turned down.
	
✓	Business consultant: Every person has talents in many areas, but no one 
can be a master of everything. Consultants are available to assist in the 
areas where you need expert help. You can use business, management, 
and marketing consultants; promotion experts; financial planners; and 
a host of other specialists to help make your business more successful. 
Don’t hesitate to draw on their expertise when you need it.
	
✓	Insurance agent/broker: Many kinds of insurance options are available 
for business owners, and some are more necessary than others. An 
insurance agent or broker can advise you about the type and amount 
of coverage that’s best for you and your business. The agent may also 
be able to tailor a package that meets your specific needs at reasonable 
rates. Check out Chapter 8 for more information on health insurance.
	
The relationships you establish with outside professionals during the startup 
phase of your business can last for years and can be of tremendous benefit to 
your firm. Be sure to choose your relationships wisely. In the case of outside 
professionals, you often get what you pay for, so be penny-wise but don’t 
suffer a poor-quality outside professional simply to save a dollar or two.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Choose the best legal structure for your business
Most home-based businesses begin as either sole proprietorships or partner­
ships because they’re the easiest business structures to run and the least 
expensive. But as these businesses grow, many explore the transition to 
another kind of legal entity. Before you decide what kind of business you want 
yours to be, consider the pros and cons of the following legal structures:
	
✓	Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship is the simplest and least 
regulated form of organization. It also has minimal legal startup costs, 
making it the most popular choice for new home-based businesses. In 
a sole proprietorship, one person owns and operates the business and 
is responsible for seeking and obtaining financing. The sole proprietor 
(likely you) has total control and receives all profits, which are taxed 
as personal income. The major disadvantages include unlimited per­
sonal liability for the owner (if the business is sued for some reason, the 
owner is personally liable to pay any judgments against the company) 
and potential dissolution of the business upon the owner’s death.
	
✓	Partnership: A partnership is relatively easy to form and can provide 
additional financial resources. Each partner is an agent for the partner­
ship and can borrow money, hire employees, and operate the busi­
ness. Profits are taxed as personal income, and the partners are still 
personally liable for debts and taxes. Personal assets can be attached 
if the partnership can’t satisfy creditors’ claims. A special arrangement 
called a limited partnership allows partners to avoid unlimited personal 
liability. Limited partnerships must be registered and must also pay a 
tax to the appropriate authorities in their jurisdiction. On the plus side, 
partnerships allow people to combine their unique talents and assets 
to create a whole greater than the sum of its parts. On the other hand, 
though, partnerships can become sheer living hell when partners fail to 
see eye to eye or when relationships turn sour.
	
	When entering into any partnership, consult a lawyer, and insist on a 
written agreement that clearly describes a process for dissolving the 
partnership as cleanly and fairly as possible.
	
✓	Limited liability company: A limited liability company (LLC) is often the 
preferred choice for new operations and joint ventures because LLCs 
have the advantage of being treated as partnerships for U.S. income 
tax purposes while also providing the limited liability of corporations. 
However, LLCs have the disadvantage of generally being more expensive 
to set up than sole proprietorships or partnerships. Owners of limited 
liability companies, called members, are comparable to stockholders in 
a corporation or limited partners in a limited partnership. To create a 
limited liability company, articles of organization are filed with the sec­
retary of state. The members must also execute an operating agreement 
that defines the relationship between the company and its members. 
Note that not all states have this option available.

 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Starting Your Own Business
	
✓	Corporation: As the most complex of business organizations, the corpo­
ration (also known as a C corporation) acts as a legal entity that exists 
separately from its owners. Although this separation limits the owners 
from personal liability, it also creates a double taxation on earnings 
(corporate tax and personal tax). A corporate structure may be advan­
tageous because it allows the business to raise capital more easily 
through the sale of stocks or bonds; plus, the business can continue 
to function even without key individuals. The corporation also enables 
future employees to participate in various types of insurance and profit-
sharing plans. Costs to incorporate vary from state to state — contact 
your secretary of state for more information.
	
	A special type of corporation, an S corporation, allows owners to over­
come the double tax and shareholders to offset business losses with 
personal income; however, if you offset losses for an S corporation 
against regular income, you basically guarantee that you’ll be audited.
	
	With C corporations, you need to be careful you aren’t erroneously 
classified by the government as a professional service corporation, 
which is treated much less advantageously than other C corporations. 
Professional service corporations are corporations in which the owners 
(who are licensed professionals) substantially perform certain personal 
services, including accounting, actuarial science, architecture, consult­
ing, engineering, health, veterinary services, law, and performing arts.
As you set up your new home-based business, take time to carefully think 
through the ramifications of your business’s legal structure. Each option has 
many potential advantages and disadvantages for your firm, and each can 
make a big difference in how you run your business. If you have any ques­
tions about which kind of legal structure is right for your business, talk to an 
accountant or seek advice from an attorney who specializes in small busi­
nesses. Chapters 9 and 10 can also help you sort through the options.
Decide on a name
Naming your business may well be one of the most enjoyable steps in the 
process of starting up your own home-based business. Everyone can get in 
on the action: your friends, your family, and especially your clients-to-be.
	
Consider your business name carefully — you have to live with it for a long 
time. Your business name should give people some idea of the nature of your 
business, it should project the image you want to have, and it should be easy 
to visualize. Names can be simple, sophisticated, or even silly. Try to pick one 
that can grow with your business and not limit you in the future.
	
Along with a name, many businesses develop a logo, which provides a graphic 
symbol for the business (see Chapter 14 for more ideas). As with your name, 
your logo needs to project the image you want, so develop it carefully. Spend a 
few extra dollars to have a professional graphic artist design your logo for you.

58
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
After you come up with a name, register it with your local government to 
make sure it isn’t already in use. (See Chapter 10 for more details.) If you 
don’t check first, you may have to throw out your stationery and business 
cards and redesign your logo and Web site when you eventually find out that 
another company has your name — and registered it 15 years before you did!
Take care of the red tape (and it will take care of you)
Taking care of all the local, state, and federal government legal requirements 
of starting up a business is something that too many budding home-based 
entrepreneurs put off or ignore. Unfortunately, ignoring the many legal 
requirements of going into business may put you and your business at risk.
Getting through the maze of government regulations can certainly be one 
of the most confusing aspects of starting up and running a business. But 
even though this process can be intimidating, you have to do it — and do it 
correctly — because noncompliance can result in costly penalties and per­
haps even the loss of your business. Consider this step as one that fortifies 
the professionalism of your business at the same time that it helps you rest 
easy at night, knowing that you’re following the rules. Do you want people 
to take you seriously? Then you need to establish your business in a profes­
sional way.
	
Even very small or part-time businesses have certain requirements. It’s your 
responsibility to adhere to any and all regulations that apply to your business. 
Fortunately, a lot of people and organizations — government small business 
development centers, chambers of commerce, and sometimes lawyers and 
certified public accountants — are willing and eager to answer questions and 
help you with this task. For your sake — and the sake of your business — 
don’t hesitate to ask someone for help when you need it.
Get the insurance you need
In today’s expensive, litigious world of business, insurance isn’t really an 
option — it’s essential. Without it, all your years of hard work can be lost in a 
minute because of a catastrophic loss.
	
So what kinds of insurance do you need for your business? We recommend 
that you talk to an insurance agent and discuss your business and its needs 
with him or her. Some of the most common kinds of business insurance 
include the following:
	
✓	Health insurance: Includes medical, dental, vision, and other coverage 
designed to maintain and promote employee health and wellness and to 
protect employees against catastrophic loss in case of injury or illness
	
✓	Basic fire insurance: Covers property losses due to fire and sometimes 
covers loss of business, as well

59
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Starting Your Own Business
	
✓	Extended coverage: Protects against conditions not covered by fire 
insurance, including storms, explosions, smoke damage, and various 
other disasters
	
✓	Liability insurance: Covers claims against your business for bodily 
injury incurred on the business’s premises
	
✓	Product liability coverage: Covers liability for products manufactured 
or sold
	
✓	Professional liability and/or errors-and-omissions insurance: Protects 
the business against claims for damages incurred by customers as a 
result of your professional advice or recommendations
	
✓	Vandalism and malicious mischief coverage: Covers against property 
losses resulting from vandalism and related activities
	
✓	Theft coverage: Protects your business from burglary and robbery
	
✓	Vehicle insurance: Covers collision, liability, and property damage for 
vehicles used for business
	
✓	Business interruption insurance: Covers payment of business earnings 
if the business is closed for an insurable cause, such as fire, flood, or 
other natural disaster
	
✓	Workers’ compensation: Provides disability and death benefits to 
employees and others who work for you, as defined by your state law, 
who are injured on the job
	
A homeowner’s policy isn’t usually enough insurance for a home-based busi­
ness for a couple of reasons. First, your typical homeowner’s policy provides 
only limited coverage for business equipment and doesn’t insure you against 
risks of liability or lost income. Second, your homeowner’s policy may not 
cover your business activities at all.
	
Insurance is the kind of thing you don’t think about until you need it. And in 
the case of insurance, when you need it, chances are you really need it! Take 
time to set up proper coverage now — before it’s too late.
Decide on an accounting system
Accounting is one of those topics that makes people nervous (with visions of 
IRS audits dancing in their heads), but keeping books doesn’t have to be com­
plicated. In fact, simplicity is the key to a good system for home-based busi­
nesses. Keep in mind that your records need to be complete and up-to-date 
so that you have the information you need for business decisions and taxes.
	
When you establish an accounting system, we recommend that you pick up 
one of the excellent computer software programs dedicated to this purpose. 
Programs such as Quicken, QuickBooks, and Peachtree do everything your 
home-based business will ever need — and more.

60
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
The two basic bookkeeping methods are single entry and double entry. Single 
entry is simpler, with only one entry required per transaction. We prefer this 
method for most home-based businesses, and the vast majority can operate 
very well with the single-entry system. If you go this route, we recommend 
that you use Quicken. Double entry requires two entries per transaction and 
provides cross-checks and decreases errors. Consider going with a double-
entry system if someone else manages your books, if you use your account­
ing system for inventory management, or if you want more sophisticated 
reporting for analyzing your business. If you decide that double entry is for 
you, we recommend QuickBooks, Microsoft Office Accounting Professional, 
or Peachtree Complete Accounting.
You can also choose between two methods to keep track of the money 
coming in and going out of your business: cash or accrual. Most small busi­
nesses use the cash method, in which income is reported in the year it’s 
received and expenses are deducted in the year they’re paid. Under the 
accrual method, income is reported when it’s earned, and expenses are 
deducted when they’re incurred, whether money has changed hands yet 
or not.
The accounting methods you use depend on your business. You may want to 
talk to an accountant for help in setting up your system. Even with the sup­
port of a professional, however, you need to understand your own system 
thoroughly.
	
Many home-based businesses can get by without detailed financial reporting 
or analysis — after all, if you can keep up with your bills and perhaps have a 
little bit of money to sock away in your savings account, you must be making 
money, right? If you really want to understand your business’s financial situa­
tion, however, you need some basic financial reports.
The following financial statements are the minimum necessary to understand 
where your business stands financially. With them in hand, you can review 
your business’s financial strengths and weaknesses and make accurate plans 
for the future.
	
✓	Balance sheets: Balance sheets show the worth of your business — the 
difference between its assets and its liabilities. Your balance sheet can 
tell you whether or not you’d have any cash left over if you shut down 
your business today and paid off all your bills and loans and liquidated 
your assets.
	
✓	Profit-and-loss statements: Profit-and-loss (P&L) statements show you the 
difference between how much money your business is bringing in (reve­
nue) and how much money it’s spending (expenses). If you’re bringing in 

61
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Starting Your Own Business
more money than you spend, you have a profit. If you’re spending more 
money than you bring in, you have a loss.
	
✓	Cash-flow projections: Cash-flow projections tell you where your money 
is going and whether or not you’re likely to have sufficient money each 
month to pay your bills and operate the business. For many startup 
companies — especially those with employees, rent, and other signifi­
cant recurring expenses — a cash-flow projection is the most important 
financial statement of all.
	
Years after starting his home-based business, Peter still keeps a detailed cash-
flow projection that shows expected revenues — by client — on a monthly 
basis for an entire year. By doing so, Peter can see any shortfalls that may be 
dangerous to his personal financial health far in advance, and he can address 
them before they become major problems.
For many more details about these and other financial matters, including the 
use of financial ratios to gauge the financial health of your business and a 
much more in-depth look at accounting software packages, be sure to check 
out Chapter 6.
Develop a marketing plan
If you want to be successful, you can’t just start a business and then patiently 
wait for customers to walk in your door. You have to let potential custom­
ers know about your new business, get them in to have a look, and then 
encourage them to buy your product or service. Marketing is all of this and 
more. Your specific approach to marketing depends on your business, your 
finances, your potential client or customer base, and your goals.
Marketing sells your products and services, which brings in the cash you 
need to run your business. Marketing is so important to the survival (and 
success) of your business that it deserves a plan of its own. A marketing plan 
helps evaluate where your business currently is, where you want it to go, and 
how you can get there. Your marketing plan should also spell out the specific 
strategies and costs involved in reaching your goals. You can integrate it into 
your business plan as one comprehensive section. As with the business plan, 
you should refer to it regularly and update it as necessary.
Successful marketing for a small or home-based business doesn’t happen all 
by itself. It requires a lot of work and careful analysis and is a terrific oppor­
tunity to use your creativity and hone your business sense. For a lot more 
information on marketing your home-based business, be sure to check out 
Chapter 4.

Six Ways to Get the Cash Flowing
Every new business starts at the beginning. No matter how much experience 
you have in your current job or how many other businesses you may have 
started in the past, when you create a new home-based business, you’re 
starting from scratch. In the beginning, every sale counts, and your primary 
goal quickly becomes building financial momentum. The faster you get the 
cash flowing into your new business, the sooner you can leave your 9-to-5 job 
behind and dedicate yourself fully to your home-based business. Consider 
these six approaches to getting the cash flowing as you start your business:
	
✓	Begin part-time with your new business. When you start your own 
business, you usually have a choice to make: Keep your day job or quit. 
As we mention earlier in this chapter, we recommend that you keep 
your regular job for as long as you can while building your own busi­
ness part-time. That way you still have your regular job to fall back on if 
your own business fails for whatever reason in its early stages. At some 
point — after your own business has built up a sufficient clientele — you 
can leave your regular job and devote yourself fully to your home-based 
business.

63
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Starting Your Own Business
	
✓	Work part-time at your old job. If you have enough work in your home-
based business to keep you fairly busy, but not enough to make it 
your full-time vocation, consider working part-time in your regular job. 
Depending on your particular situation, your current employer may be 
willing to be flexible with your schedule. For many employers, keeping a 
good employee part-time is better than losing her or him altogether.
	
✓	Turn your employer into your first client. If you’re really good at what 
you do, what better way to get your business off the ground than to do 
work for your current employer on a contract basis? Not only do you 
give your employer the benefit of your expertise while contracting with 
a known entity, but you also develop your business while working with 
people you already know, using systems and procedures you’re already 
familiar with.
	
	Take care, however, to clearly separate yourself from your former 
employer as an independent contractor rather than continuing to work 
in the role of an employee. If you don’t make this distinction clear, the 
IRS may disallow any tax deductions you take for your home-based busi­
ness. See Chapter 9 for a discussion on how to ensure you’re on the 
right side of this fine line.
	
✓	Take business with you (ethically, of course!). Although stealing clients 
away from a previous employer is unethical (and may very well land you 
in court, forcing you to pay an attorney a lot of money to get you out 
of trouble), you may be able to get your employer’s blessing if you let 
him or her know exactly what you want to do. The advantage of taking 
clients with you to your new business is that you maintain the strong 
working relationship you already have in place — which greatly benefits 
both your new business and your new clients.
	
✓	Finance your business with startup funds. You need money to start a 
business — any business. By lining up sources of startup funds, you can 
ease the financial entry into owning your own home-based business. 
Although the list of potential sources of startup funds is practically end­
less, we let you in on the best ones in the “Figuring Out Where to Get 
Your Startup Funds” section later in this chapter.
	
✓	Piggyback with your spouse or significant other. If you’re married or 
living with a significant other, he or she can continue to work his or her 
regular job, providing a steady paycheck, benefits, and more, while you 
start your own home-based business. Although your overall income will 
be reduced until you’re able to crank up your sales, you have the shelter 
of a secure job and benefits. Such a shelter can save you a lot of sleepless 
nights, allowing you to focus your attention where it’s most needed — on 
building your business.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Bringing a partner into your business
Q: I’m looking for a business partner for my 
company. Do you have any suggestions on how 
to find one?
A: The best business partner is someone with 
whom you have a long track record of working 
well — someone with whom you share common 
goals and philosophies and compatible work 
styles. The more experience you’ve had working 
together, the better. But don’t despair if you can’t 
find anyone from your existing pool of contacts to 
team up with. You can find partners by networking 
through professional and trade organizations or by 
getting referrals from others whose judgment you 
value and respect. Here’s what we suggest:
	✓	Don’t go directly from stranger to business 
partner. That’s like getting married on the 
first date. Instead of telling people you’re 
looking for a business partner, put the word 
out that you’re looking for an associate to 
run a joint venture with. This initial joint ven­
ture should be a short-term or discreet proj­
ect that gives you a chance to get to know 
a prospective partner and see whether you 
have the chemistry to work well together.
	✓	Ask for referrals from those in a position 
to know people who will meet your crite­
ria: the officers of a trade association, the 
president of the chamber of commerce, the 
editor of the trade journal, or a valued sup­
plier or client. You can network with such 
individuals online as well as in person. 
These days, you need not limit yourself to 
teaming only with colleagues in your locale. 
Many people successfully use e-mail, col­
laboration software, land lines, and Skype, 
to team up with associates anywhere in the 
country or even internationally.
As you talk with people about the possibility of 
collaborating on an initial venture, look for com­
patibility in the following areas:
	✓	Strengths that complement yours
	✓	Honesty
	✓	Fairness
	✓	Aesthetics and etiquette
	✓	Personal integrity
	✓	Positive attitudes about family/work 
priorities
	✓	Money and financial smarts
	✓	Timeliness and punctuality
	✓	High quality and educational levels
	✓	Good manners and treatment of others
	✓	Positive attitudes about your profession or 
business
Take note of any red flags. If anything like the 
following comes up in initial conversations, 
watch out!
	✓	A history of financial problems
	✓	A history of combative relationships or 
lawsuits
	✓	Soap opera tales of woe with previous part­
ners or joint ventures
	✓	Bad here-and-now behavior, such as being 
late to meetings or frequently putting down 
others
	✓	Unwillingness to put plans and agreements 
in writing
When you find someone you click with, do 
several short-term projects or joint ventures 
together before committing to a formal, legal 
partnership. Make sure that your initial assess­
ment is accurate and that you can, in fact, trust 
your partner and work well together.

 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Starting Your Own Business
Figuring Out Where to Get 
Your Startup Funds
The number-one concern of most people who plan to start their own home-
based businesses isn’t what kind of business to start, where to start it, or 
how to market their products and services. It’s not who their customers will 
be, who their competition is, or whether or not they should involve a spouse 
in the business. Their number-one concern is money. More specifically, it’s 
where to get the money they need to start up their home-based businesses.
	
It takes money to make money — especially when starting a new home-based 
business. With cash, you can buy the things your business needs to operate 
and stock up on the inventory of products you plan to sell to your customers 
and clients.
But where does this initial money come from, and what are the best ways to 
pull together the cash you need to start up your home-based business? Here 
are 21 of our best suggestions:
	
✓	Bartering: Although not strictly a source of cash, bartering with others — 
trading your products or services for theirs — can be a terrific way of 
getting the things you need to get your business off the ground. Need a 
computer? Well, if you’re starting a massage business in your home, you 
may be able to find someone who’d love to trade some massages for a 
computer he or she’s no longer using. Craigslist (www.craigslist.
org) is a great place to give bartering a try.
	
✓	Business idea competitions: Some organizations sponsor business idea 
competitions with the prizes for best idea (or ideas) being startup fund­
ing. Technology organizations, such as the recent $80,000 Entrepreneur 
Challenge held at University of California, San Diego (challenge.ucsd.
edu), often sponsor these competitions.
	
✓	Credit cards: Home-based business owners often turn to credit cards 
as a source of cash for business startup. A word of caution: Beware of 
extremely high interest rates and extra fees for cash advances. If you do 
decide to use a credit card for your business, try to dedicate one solely 
to your business expenses. Doing so makes figuring out your taxes for 
the year a much easier task.
	
✓	Credit unions: Because credit unions are owned by their members, they 
often offer better interest rates than regular banks or other financial 
institutions do. If you belong to a credit union, be sure to try there for a 
loan first. Keep in mind, however, that credit unions are generally even 
more adverse to risk than regular banks, so your credit has to be very 
strong for you to have a chance of getting the money you need.

66
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
✓	Disability grants: If you’ve been granted a disability payment because of 
an on-the-job injury that prevents you from pursuing your former voca­
tion, the cash you receive may be useful as you begin a new career — 
a career at home.
	
✓	Donations: You can appeal to the world to contribute money to help 
you get your new business off the ground. With the huge growth in 
popularity of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, it’s 
possible to reach a very large crowd of like-minded individuals, some of 
whom may be willing to contribute to your venture.
	
✓	Funds from investors: Many new companies rely on cash from inves­
tors to fund their startup and initial operations. Be aware, however, 
that when you accept money from investors, you probably have to give 
them something in exchange. That something is usually equity in the 
company. And with equity comes the power to have a say in how the 
business is run. If you don’t want anyone telling you how to run your 
business, you may not want to use investor funds to help you start 
your business.
	
✓	Government grants: A variety of federal, state, and local government 
programs provide small business startup funding. Unfortunately, how­
ever, you have to beat the bushes to find it, and the categories of people 
eligible to receive it may be highly restrictive.
	
✓	Home equity line of credit: If you have a home and have built up equity 
in it (the value of the home over and above what you owe for it), you 
may be eligible for an equity line of credit. These lines of credit have 
several great advantages: You don’t pay any interest or payments 
unless you actually borrow against your line of credit (you may have to 
pay some sort of loan origination fee to set up the line of credit); home 
equity loan terms are often much longer than standard loans — up to 
15 years or more; and the interest you pay is tax deductible. On the 
downside, you have to put your home up as collateral — if you default 
on your loan, you may lose your house. All in all, however, home equity 
loans can be a smart way to finance your new business.
	
✓	Inheritances: Although inheritances may be subject to taxation depend­
ing on exactly how much you inherit and in what way (check with a 
tax adviser for all the details), you may still be left with a substantial 
amount of funds that you can use to start your new business.
	
✓	Intrapreneurship programs: Some businesses encourage their employees 
who have a good idea to start their own companies — providing startup 
funding to assist them in the process. In exchange for the startup funding, 
the business may or may not require an ownership stake in the business. 
Check with your current supervisor or employer to see whether this 
option is available to you.

67
 Chapter 3: The ABCs of Starting Your Own Business
	
✓	Life insurance policies: Depending on the kind of life insurance policy 
you have (term, cash value, and so on), you may be able to cash it in or 
take out a loan against it. Read the fine print of your policy or consult 
your insurance agent to see whether you have this option. If you’ve had 
a cash-value policy for a long time, you may be pleasantly surprised at 
how much money is available to you for your new business.
	
✓	Loans from friends and family: When aspiring home-based entrepre­
neurs don’t personally have the resources to finance their new business, 
friends and family are often the first potential sources of funding they 
turn to. As long as your request for a loan doesn’t cause your relation­
ships to sour, loans from friends and family can be a great way to put 
together the financing you need. Be sure to treat relatives and friends as 
you would any business relationship, using signed, written loan docu­
ments with clear terms and conditions.
	
✓	Loans from suppliers or colleagues: You believe in yourself, right? If 
your idea’s a good one, chances are others will believe in you, too. Drop 
the hint to your colleagues or suppliers that you’re looking for money to 
finance your new business, and you may well find yourself with the cash 
you need to get started.
	
✓	Local seed-money funds, such as funds sponsored by the Amarillo 
Economic Development Center: Many local governments offer seed 
money to help finance new businesses in their communities. Check with 
your local small business office to see what’s available in your community.
	
✓	Microloan programs: The government and a number of foundations 
offer a variety of microloan programs, particularly targeted to women 
and minorities. Check with your local Small Business Administration 
office to find out what’s available and whether you qualify.
	
✓	Personal assets, such as a boat, extra vehicle, camper, and so on: You 
may be able to find the startup funds you need by selling some of your 
superfluous personal assets. Think big yard sale, eBay, www.craigs
list.org, or your local classified ads.
	
✓	Personal savings: Savings accounts are probably the first place most 
soon-to-be home-based business owners turn to when looking for cash 
to start up their new businesses. And why not? You get instant loan 
approval — no matter how good or bad your credit report may be — 
and you can’t beat the interest rate of 0 percent!
	
✓	Reduced tax withholdings: If you aren’t taking any exemptions on your 
income tax withholding at work, you can unlock an instant stream of 
cash by increasing your exemptions in line with the deductions you 
expect to have available when you file your annual income taxes. Simply 
follow the instructions on the IRS form or consult your accountant for 
more information.

68
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
✓	Retirement funds: If you’re currently working a full-time job, you prob­
ably have some sort of retirement fund established. This fund is as good 
as gold, and you can apply the cash within it to help you start up your 
new business. However, a couple of problems usually accompany early 
distributions of retirement funds. First, Uncle Sam will probably penalize 
you for doing so (check the rules for your particular kind of retirement 
How to patent your ideas
Q: I’d like to sell patented ideas to companies 
that manufacture similar products. But because 
I don’t have a lot of disposable income or col­
lateral, how do I finance my patent searches 
and applications? Also, when I write to compa­
nies about my ideas, I get rejection letters or no 
response. How do I get my foot in the door to 
sell companies my ideas?
A: Patent attorney and author David Pressman 
recommends waiting to send letters to manu­
facturers until after you’ve completed a thorough 
patent search and submitted your patent appli­
cation. You can hire a professional searcher 
for under $1,000, but if you’re a conscientious 
worker and have the time, you can do your 
own search. Pressman outlines how to do 
so in his book Patent It Yourself (Nolo). You 
can also check out David Hitchcock’s Patent 
Searching Made Easy (Nolo) for more informa­
tion on patent searching. Or you can begin your 
search on the Internet at patft.uspto.
gov or at a Patent and Trademark Depository 
Library in your state. You can find a list of 
Patent and Trademark Depository Library sites 
at the Patent and Trademark Depository Library 
Program (PTDLP) page on the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office Web site at www.uspto.
gov. For patents issued before 1971, you have 
to go to a depository library.
Even if you choose to do the patent search 
yourself, however, you still have some expense 
because, after you’ve completed your search, 
you have to pay a fee for each patent appli­
cation, currently under $200 for a small entity. 
Pressman recommends that you find and write 
to suitable companies after you file an applica­
tion. Most companies, he says, respond with a 
form letter requesting that you sign an enclosed 
waiver form. Some people do offer to sell their 
patented ideas for a lump sum, but he finds that 
most seek to license their ideas instead, usually 
for around 5 percent of sales.
Pressman urges you not to get involved with 
an invention development company. These 
companies offer to review your ideas and then 
charge an inflated price to complete a search 
for you. If you’d rather be just the idea man and 
leave the financing, model building, searching, 
and filing to others, we suggest putting together 
your own development team. Ideally, you have 
contacts to draw upon for such a team from 
your experience in the fields related to what­
ever ideas you’re developing. If not, you can 
begin making such contacts by networking 
through professional organizations either face-
to-face or online.

account) and will then add insult to injury by taxing you on the income 
you pull out of your fund. Second, if you wipe out your retirement 
account, you have nothing to fall back on if your business fails (and no 
retirement funds when you’re really ready to retire).
	
✓	Stock offering: Although the appeal (and value) of stock in a new busi­
ness with no track record of success is perhaps limited, it’s possible to 
sell stock to investors through either a public or private offering. You can 
probably accomplish stock offerings yourself, but the rules and regula­
tions are extremely complex, and the penalties for breaking them — 
whether accidentally or on purpose — are severe. At minimum, bring in 
an attorney or law firm that specializes in securities law to advise you and 
your team. You may also consider working with an investment bank or 
venture capital firm to help steer the process and ensure its success.
	
Before you run out and buy that snazzy new company car, computer, or modu­
lar furniture unit, ask yourself whether the old one can serve you just as well 
for another year or two. Using the same old stuff you’ve always used may not 
be as exciting as shopping for something new, but you put the money you save 
to better use generating income for the business. And in a home-based busi­
ness, generating income for the business means generating income for you.

to check out Peter’s book (with co-author Joseph Bartlett) Raising Capital For 
Dummies (Wiley).
Putting Together a Business Plan
Whether you write it on the back of a napkin or fill hundreds of pages with 
full-color charts and photos of happy customers, your business plan can 
help you prioritize the actions you take to start up and run your business. 
Although businesses use formal business plans less often nowadays than 
they did in the past (today’s businesses usually put together business plans 
for the benefit of loan officers at banks and potential investors), the process 
of putting together a business plan for your home-based business is an edu­
cation in itself — one you can’t get anywhere else.
Even though you have some flexibility in determining the exact format of 
your business plan (especially when it’s an informal one that’s strictly for 
your own use), if your intent is to use the plan for securing financing from a 
bank or investors, they expect to see certain information presented in spe­
cific ways. These expectations allow banks and investors to make informed 
judgments on the viability of your business and its potential for growth and 
profitability.

70
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
A formal business plan should contain, at minimum, the following elements:
	
✓	Mission statement: The company’s mission statement sets the tone for 
the business, relating it to its values and goals. Mission statements are 
inspiring and serve to galvanize the employees to work hard to attain 
the company’s goals. Paul and Sarah’s mission statement fulfills all these 
criteria: “We’re authors, broadcasters, and facilitators. Our mission is to 
explore new and better ways of living and working through the interface 
of nature and technology.” Peter’s mission statement is “The best books, 
on time, and on dollar.”
	
✓	Description of the company’s products and services: This element pro­
vides a complete description of all the products and services the com­
pany presently offers and plans to offer in the future. If your home-based 
business specializes in producing the best wedding cakes in the tri-state 
area, using the latest in confectionery technology, you’d lay it all out 
here. Be complete — leave nothing to the imagination.
	
✓	Market analysis: If you’ve already put together a marketing plan for your 
business, you already have the material you need to fill out this part of 
your business plan. The market analysis takes a close look at the mar­
kets in which you intend to sell your products and services and details 
the number of potential customers, the potential growth rate of the 
market, information about your competition, and the particulars of your 
marketing strategies. See the “Develop a marketing plan” section earlier 
in this chapter for an analysis of a marketing plan.
	
✓	Financial projections: Do you plan to go from $100 a month in revenues 
to $100,000 a month? This part is where you present your financial pro­
jections, including revenues, expenses, and profit or loss. Plan to include 
the three basic financial statements — a balance sheet, a profit-and-loss 
(P&L) statement, and a cash-flow projection — and be ready to back up 
your guesses and prognostications with hard data. (See the “Decide on 
an accounting system” section for more details about these financial 
statements.)
	
✓	Management strategies for achieving company goals: You have your 
products and services, your marketing strategies, and your financial 
projections. Now, exactly how do you intend to achieve your goals? This 
section presents the details of the strategies you select to achieve your 
company’s goals and lays out when and how you plan to achieve them.
Although space doesn’t allow us to present a sample of a formal business 
plan within these pages, you can view several at www.businessplans.org.

Farming out your business plan
Q: I want to start a business, but the bank needs 
a business plan before I can get a loan. I don’t 
know how to write a business plan and am not 
good at writing. Is there a service that can write 
one for me?
A: Absolutely. You can hire a professional busi­
ness plan writer. Your bank loan officer may be 
able to recommend one to you, or you can find 
one online. Many business plan writers now 
have their own Web sites. You can also look 
for business planning consultants at www.
bplans.com/pc — look for someone who 
has general business background in the areas 
of accounting, bookkeeping, and marketing, 
and familiarity with financial statements, busi­
ness jargon, and your local business commu­
nity. Before you choose a writer, definitely ask 
for a few writing samples, and, if possible, have 
your bank loan officer review the samples to be 
sure they’re of the type and quality the bank is 
seeking.
Professionals can generally prepare a busi­
ness plan in two to four weeks. Fees range from 
$2,500 to $5,000, depending on the time required 
to research needed financial data, analyze the 
competition, develop sample marketing plans, 
and so forth.

Y
ou’ve worked hard to start your home-based business and get it going. 
You’ve set aside some space in which to operate, and you’ve picked up 
a business license. You’ve purchased and stocked products to sell, or you’ve 
prepared yourself to deliver first-rate services to what you hope will be an 
eager throng of potential clients and customers. But before you can start 
enjoying the fruits of all your hard work, there’s one thing you have to do: 
Convince someone to buy your products and services. You see, the great­
est business ideas in the world — the greatest products and services — are 
essentially worthless if no one is willing to pay you for them. For your busi­
ness to be successful, you have to get good at marketing your products and 
services so that prospective customers and clients hear about you and are 
encouraged to buy from you.
In this chapter, we help you identify your best customers and assess their 
needs. We take a look at different marketing methods — including referrals, 
one of the most effective marketing tools — and help you create a meaning­
ful marketing plan. We also check in on the latest information about starting 
your own Web site for e-commerce.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Identifying Your Best Customers
Here’s a secret that may make a very big difference in the amount of money 
you stand to earn from your home-based business: Some of your potential cus­
tomers are better than others. That is, some (the ones who are willing to pay 
top dollar for your products or services with little intervention on your part) 
will earn you a lot of money, and some (the ones who nickel-and-dime you to 
death, complaining all the way) will actually lose you money. Because poten­
tial customers come in all sizes, shapes, and spending profiles — and because 
customers don’t come with their profiles stapled on their foreheads — 
your very difficult job is first to figure out which ones are the most likely to 
become your best customers and then to figure out how to attract and reach 
them. Because your time and marketing dollars aren’t unlimited, the best use 
of your money is to target specific people — the people most likely to buy 
your products and services. Instead of running expensive radio or newspaper 
advertisements day after day, hoping to get the attention of the customers 
you seek, you may find that targeted advertising in a specific magazine or 
Web site delivers a much greater payoff.
	
What does your ideal customer look like? Here are a few questions to ask as 
you create a picture. (Don’t worry if you can’t answer all the questions right 
now — just give it your best shot.)
	
✓	Who do you think your best customers are?
	
✓	Are they individuals or businesses?
	
✓	If they’re individuals, what do they like and what don’t they like?
	
✓	What are their needs and problems?
	
✓	How can you best address those needs and problems?
	
✓	What’s most important to your best customers?
	
✓	What’s least important to them?
	
✓	How can you deliver more of the former and less of the latter?
Based on these questions, develop a written description of your best custom­
ers, and have some of your customers look it over to validate it or to make 
corrections. Here’s a sample description of the ideal customer for a pet-
sitting service:
My ideal customer is a single, working adult with one or more pets, 
including dogs, cats, or birds, that require daily care and attention. My 
ideal customer often travels, has sufficient income ($45,000 or more per 
year) to afford to hire a pet sitter, and prefers to keep his or her pet in its 
home environment rather than in a kennel or other offsite care situation. 
My ideal customer loves his or her pets and wants them to have the best 
care possible.

75
 Chapter 4: Marketing 101: Attracting Customers
The idea is to understand your best potential clients and customers inside 
out — to know what makes them tick and what motivates them. By doing 
so, you can easily figure out which marketing approaches (Web site, blog, 
direct mail, radio ads, search engine listings, display advertisement, social 
networking on sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, directory ads, such 
as electronic and print Yellow Pages, and so forth) have the highest probabil­
ity of not only reaching your best customers, but also inducing them to want 
to find out more about what you’ve got to offer. (Check out the “Marketing: 
Taking Different Roads to Meet Your Goals” section later in this chapter for 
ideas on ways to market your products and services.)
Promoting a new business
Q: My sister-in-law and I have a home business 
together that offers complete medical billing for 
physicians. Our primary way of marketing is to 
visit physicians personally and present informa­
tion on what we have to offer. Do you have any 
other suggestions on how to promote a new 
business without spending too much?
A: Our interviews with owners of successful 
medical billing services for The Best Home 
Businesses for the 21st Century and again for 
The Best Home Businesses for People 50+ 
confirm that what you’re doing now continues 
to be the best way to get started in this field. 
Most startups begin by knocking on doors or 
making marketing calls by phone. To make 
getting through to doctors easier, we suggest 
warming up your sales contacts by mailing bro­
chures and letters and then following up with a 
personal contact for an appointment. Here are 
a few ideas that may help you get started:
	✓	Talk with your own doctors and other 
healthcare providers whom you know per­
sonally, and ask for referrals.
	✓	Collaborate with pharmaceutical salespeo­
ple, who regularly see doctors in their pri­
vate offices. (Expect to pay a commission to 
reps who introduce you.)
	✓	Don’t limit your marketing contacts to medi­
cal doctors. You can also provide billing 
services to a wide range of other health­
care practitioners, such as acupunctur­
ists, dentists, chiropractors, commercial 
ambulance services, dentists and ortho­
dontists, home-nursing services, massage 
therapists, nurse practitioners, occupa­
tional therapists, optometrists, physical 
therapists, physician assistants, podiatrists, 
psychologists and other counselors, respi­
ratory therapists, and speech therapists.
	✓	Contact local professional societies about 
offering discounts to their members. After 
making contacts, follow up by phone to find 
out if you can provide additional informa­
tion. Then keep your services top of mind 
(that is, in their minds) by sending periodic 
reminders in the form of timely tips and 
other useful information on postcards, 
flyers, or newsletters that you can send via 
mail, e-mail, or fax.
	✓	Get new ideas and feedback on what you’re 
doing from colleagues, such as on one of 
the groups on LinkedIn for medical billers.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Tapping In to Your Customers’ Needs
Which do you think is the better approach — creating a product or service 
that you’re not sure anyone will want to buy and then trying to sell it, or first 
finding out what people want to buy and then creating a product or service 
that responds to that want? Here’s a hint: If you build a business around a 
product or service that you’re not sure will sell, you’re taking a very big risk.
Creating a product or service in a vacuum, without considering the input of 
your clients or customers, is a recipe for disaster because you’re essentially 
designing a product or service that your prospects may neither need nor like. 
As a result, you have to market much harder — or offer a lot of incentives — 
to get your clients or customers to buy your products. Even then, they still 
may not buy.
	
Finding a need and filling it is one of the most basic marketing strategies. Your 
first step in marketing, therefore, begins before your product or service is 
available to the public, when you’re designing and creating it. By tapping in to 
your customers’ needs early in the process, you not only build a product or 
service that your prospects truly want and need, but you also set yourself up 
for marketing efforts that take far less personal energy, time, and money to 
implement.
Understanding the WPWPF principle
Many home-based business owners are in love with the products and ser­
vices they sell, as well they should be. After all, they are their own best 
cheerleaders, creating infectious excitement whenever they have the oppor­
tunity to talk to someone about their business or their products or services. 
The problem is that some home-based business owners fall so deeply in love 
with their products and services that they fail to notice that their prospective 
clients and customers aren’t equally in love. And when this happens, a great 
idea remains only a great idea — not a great product or service.
Paul and Sarah have developed a test for home-based business owners who 
love their products and services. It’s called the WPWPF (what people will pay 
for) principle. Your products and services are only as good as what people 
are willing to pay for them. No matter how beautiful, clever, or well thought 
out they may be, if your clients and customers don’t want them, they aren’t 
worth even a fraction of the time and money you invested to create them, 
and you really don’t have a business.

77
 Chapter 4: Marketing 101: Attracting Customers
	
So what’s the solution? How can you be sure that the products and services 
you’ve been dreaming about delivering to your clients and customers are the 
ones they truly want? It’s actually quite simple: Ask them. Here are a few 
simple steps for defining your target market and then asking the people in that 
market which products and services they really want and need (and will there­
fore be willing to buy):
	
1.	Decide which market you’re going to target.
	
	 Who, potentially, are your best customers — the people in the market 
you want to target? Do you want to sell your products and services to 
busy businesspeople, to retirees who spend their winters in Florida or 
Arizona, to preschool children, or to people who like to go on extended 
vacations to exotic lands? Whichever product or service you hope to 
create, first decide whom you’re going to try to sell it to. All the steps 
that follow depend on this one, so take your time deciding which market 
you want to target.
	
2.	Ask the members of your target market which products or services 
they want and need.
	
	 You can do this in person, over the telephone, via written surveys sent 
through the mail, by e-mail, or through your Web site or blog. The key is 
to collect as much data about the wants and needs of your target market 
as you can — the more data, the better.
	
3.	Use the results of your survey when designing your products and 
services.
	
	 Using the data you collect from surveying your potential customers and 
clients, determine the design of the products and services you offer. 
Be sure that you address — and at least consider — every feature men­
tioned as important by the people you surveyed. Some may not make 
financial sense, but others may be essential to include, whatever the 
cost. Believe us: Not only do you end up with better products and ser­
vices, but you also sell a lot more of them because they match the wants 
and needs of your customers and clients.
	
4.	Test the market.
	
	 After your products and services are available — but before you roll 
them out to the public at large — test them out on a few selected people, 
businesses, or not-for-profit entities. What’s their reaction? Are they 
satisfied with the results? Do your selected customers have suggestions 
for improvements or changes? What about price? Are your products and 
services priced realistically? Will your potential clients be willing to pay 
what you ask? Incorporate the feedback you get by tweaking your prod­
uct or service or the prices you plan to charge.

78
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
5.	Market, market, market.
	
	 By going through the preceding four steps, you can be reasonably assured 
that you have a product on your hands that you can not only sell, but that 
you also can sell a lot of. Now get ready for the ride of your life!
	
Never bring out a product before you find out for sure that your target market 
really wants it enough to pay for it. Doing so may mean wasting far too much 
time and money — delaying your ability to create a positive cash flow while 
creating negative public opinion about your company. Better to wait a few 
months to fully explore your customer needs and wants than to rush through 
a great idea that ends up going nowhere.
Carving out a niche
In most economies around the world, competition is a good thing. More com­
petition is better for consumers, causing companies to push technology to 
the limits while reducing prices to gain advantage over other competitors. 
But although competition is almost always a certain win for consumers, it can 
mean big problems for the businesses that get caught up in it — especially 
small and home-based businesses.
Why? Because small and home-based businesses are often thinly capitalized; 
in other words, you don’t have a lot of cash to spare, so your marketing dol­
lars, as well as your time, need to be aimed well.
To avoid the problems that come with competition, carve out your own niche 
by providing your clients and customers with unique products and services 
that they can’t obtain anywhere else.
	
Here are a number of tips for carving out a niche of your own:
	
✓	Offer a product or service that no one else offers. Do you remember 
the Pet Rock? If that little item is before your time, the Pet Rock — 
created by salesman Gary Dahl in 1975 — was a regular, everyday rock 
placed in a small cardboard box with a witty instruction manual titled 
the Pet Rock Training Manual. After appearing on The Tonight Show, 
not once but twice, Dahl sold more than 1 million Pet Rocks at a price 
of $3.95 each. Dahl’s creation — definitely a product that no one else 
offered — took the nation by storm and made its inventor rich many 
times over.
	
✓	Specialize in only one business area or industry. You can’t be every­
thing to everybody, and if you want to be successful, you shouldn’t even 
try. Instead of spreading yourself too thin with too many unrelated prod­
ucts and services, focus on the one or two kinds of products or services 

79
 Chapter 4: Marketing 101: Attracting Customers
that you do best. Peter figured this out a number of years ago when he 
decided to specialize in writing business books. Before then, in addition 
to writing business books, he had ghostwritten a book on how to pick 
up men through the personal ads (written from a woman’s perspective!) 
and completely rewritten a book on dieting and nutrition. Today, the 
vast majority of his work is writing business books — often with busy 
businesspeople who come to him by way of referrals from happy clients.
	
✓	Serve an unserved market. Believe it or not, not every market has yet 
been tapped by companies eager to sell their products. If you take the 
time to identify these markets and serve them, you can carve out a niche 
that others will be hard pressed to match. Chances are you’ll find your­
self with little or no competition for months or even years.
When you carve out a niche in the market, you’re doing nothing more 
than getting in touch with your potential clients and providing them with 
exactly the products and services they want and need. And when you offer 
that market something it really wants and needs, marketing your product 
becomes easier than you ever imagined.
Marketing: Taking Different 
Roads to Meet Your Goals
The topic of marketing covers an incredibly broad spectrum of activities, all 
with one final goal in mind: to spur clients and customers to buy your prod­
ucts and services. When you start your home-based business, marketing 
should take up most of your schedule. After all, your business isn’t going to 
get very far down the road until you start selling your products and generat­
ing the money you need to give it life (and to pay yourself for all your hard 
work). As you gain clients and customers — and start doing paid work — you 
can reduce the amount of time and money you devote to marketing, but you 
should never forgot about it. When you own your own business and rely on it 
for your livelihood, it’s important to keep a steady flow of new business in the 
pipeline, ready to pick up the slack as you complete your work for current 
clients. For most home-based business owners, plan on making an ongoing 
commitment of at least 20 percent of your time to marketing activities.
Why bother with marketing in the first place? Won’t your products sell them­
selves? Few — if any — products truly sell themselves (and if someone trying 
to sell you on a business opportunity tells you otherwise, your internal lie 
detector should be on red alert). Selling your products and services requires 
constant marketing — you can’t simply create something and hope it will sell.

80
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Four approaches to marketing
When you’re marketing your products and ser­
vices, you have an almost unlimited number of 
approaches to choose from. Each approach 
can be grouped within the following four 
categories:
	✓	Personal contact: Whether knocking on 
your prospective customer’s door to pitch 
your product’s advantages face to face, 
cold-calling on the phone, or buttonhol­
ing an acquaintance at your local grocery 
store, when you market your products 
directly to your customers one-on-one, 
you’re making personal contact. If you 
have a great personality (always a plus 
when you’re trying to sell something), if 
your product is complex, or if your product 
is best demonstrated live and in person 
(like that incredible kitchen knife that slices 
tomatoes and 3-inch-thick steel bars with 
ease), personal contact is definitely the 
way to go.
	✓	Contact through others: Although you can 
personally sell only a finite number of prod­
ucts or services — after all, you only have 
24 hours in a day — you can leverage your 
efforts and sell far more by selling through 
others. Selling through others involves cre­
ating a buzz around your products and ser­
vices by getting people to talk about them 
(through word of mouth or through your 
promotional efforts), obtaining referrals 
from satisfied customers, and generating 
interest in the media.
	✓	Written communications: Brochures, 
advertisements, newsletters, targeted 
e-mail messages, sales letters, proposals, 
digital greeting cards, and thank-you notes 
are all different ways of using the power of 
the written word to sell your products and 
services. If you’re not comfortable selling 
your company’s products and services per­
sonally, or if you would have difficulty giving 
your potential customers samples of your 
products and services (for example, giving 
a potential customer a sample of your car-
detailing services without actually detailing 
his car), you should try selling your product 
through written communications. Again, 
properly used, written communications can 
leverage your own direct-selling efforts and 
generate far more leads and sales than per­
sonal contact alone could ever do.
	✓	Proof of what you can do: Sometimes a 
demonstration of a product or service 
can spark sales like nothing else. Product 
samples, videotaped demonstrations, Web 
sites, house parties, product displays, audio 
tapes, photos, and trial subscriptions are all 
ways of showing what you and your busi­
ness can do for your clients-to-be. When 
your prospective customers want to try 
your product before they buy it, or if you 
know that after your customers have a 
chance to actually use your products or 
services, they’ll be hooked, showing them 
what you can do with proof of your services 
is the right approach.
Which approach works best for you depends on 
a variety of factors, including the nature of your 
business, the likes and dislikes of your typical 
customer, your customers’ buying habits, and 
the complexity of your product or service. Be 
sure to keep each of these considerations in 
mind as you decide which approach to take in 
marketing your own products and services.

81
 Chapter 4: Marketing 101: Attracting Customers
	
The good news is that you can promote your business in a variety of ways. If 
you decide to tackle even just a few of them, you can easily create a successful 
marketing campaign that can propel your home-based business to the front of 
the pack. In the following sections, we show you some of the most popular 
and effective ways to do just that.
Generating word of mouth
Word of mouth means getting people to talk about you, your company, and 
its products and services in a positive light. Of course, the more people talk, 
the better your company looks as a result, and the better it is for your busi­
ness. That’s exactly why any good promotional campaign starts off with a 
heavy emphasis on generating positive word-of-mouth excitement. There’s 
nothing like a little bit of buzz to get your sales to take off.
Here are some of the best ways to get people talking about your business:
	
✓	Networking: Everyone has a circle of friends and acquaintances — both 
in work lives and in nonwork lives. Or you may belong to a community-
service or fraternal or sororal organization, such as Optimists, Junior 
League, Rotary, BPO Elks, Lions International, or others. Your networks 
of friends and acquaintances are probably the first and best places to 
start a word-of-mouth campaign for promoting your business. They know 
you, they like you (at least, we hope so), and they’re likely willing to tell 
their friends and acquaintances about you (who will then tell others, 
and on and on). If you’re new to a community or to business, you can 
participate in a business referral organization; find a group on meetup.
com. (See the following section on referrals for more information.) And 
whether you’re new or well established, your chamber of commerce is 
a great way to network with other local businesspeople. Most chapters 
sponsor a variety of business mixers, networking lunches, and other 
events specifically geared to support your networking efforts.
	
✓	Volunteering: Why not give something back to your community by vol­
unteering your time? Whether you help at a local school, crisis center, 
animal shelter, or other community-based organization, you can be sure 
to meet a variety of people who may one day become your clients and 
customers. Chances are members of the board of directors and some 
volunteers are influential people who, if they like you and what you do, 
can give you business or refer business to you (see the following section 
for more on referrals).

82
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
✓	Offering sponsorships: Sponsoring a kids’ baseball team, local char­
ity, parade, or other special event can be another good way to gener­
ate word-of-mouth promotional opportunities. Be careful, though, that 
you’re not just one sponsor lost in a flood of others — if you are, your 
message will be ineffective. It’s far better to choose your opportunities 
so that your business is featured and particularly noticeable to your 
target audience.
	
✓	Using business cards and letterheads: These basic pieces of stationery 
are the mainstays of most businesses’ promotional efforts. Your letter­
head and business cards can convey a lot of information to your prospec­
tive clients and customers and get people talking about your business. 
Invest a few dollars in a professional logo design, and you’ll make a great 
first impression on your prospects while conveying the right kind of 
message to your current customers and clients.
Word of mouth costs your business little, but the payoff can be great. Look 
for opportunities to generate a buzz about your business wherever and 
whenever you can. If people aren’t talking about your business, you can be 
sure they won’t be buying from it, either!
Acquiring referrals
Getting referrals — when people you know direct clients and acquaintances 
to your business — is the number-one way that many home-based businesses 
obtain new business. Although current clients are your bread and butter, not 
to mention the best possible sources for vital repeat business, new clients 
provide opportunities to grow your business while covering for financial 
shortfalls if current customers decide to shop elsewhere — or not shop at all.
Referrals are extremely powerful because when referred customers come 
to you, they’ve already been presold on your business and your products 
or services. You’ve already got a piece of their goodwill — which is an 
extremely valuable commodity to have in your business dealings. Here are 
some other advantages:
	
✓	Referrals are less expensive than many other kinds of marketing. No 
costly Yellow Pages ads to run, no billboards to erect, and no extrava­
gant mail-order campaign to launch. Referrals cost little or no money to 
obtain. And maintaining a favorable relationship with the people who 
give you referrals means simply doing good work for them and letting 
them know from time to time that you appreciate their business (per­
haps with a discount on your products or services, a small gift, or some 
other token of your appreciation).

83
 Chapter 4: Marketing 101: Attracting Customers
	
✓	Referred customers trust you. When people turn to their trusted friends 
and business acquaintances for advice on whom to hire for a particular 
job or to provide a particular product, they automatically tend to believe 
the recommendations they hear. As the saying goes, you have only one 
chance to make a first impression. When someone recommends you, 
you’ve already made a positive first impression with your client-to-be.
	
✓	Referred customers are ready to buy from you. When people ask 
their friends and business acquaintances for referrals, they’re ready to 
buy. People wouldn’t ask if they weren’t. And because people trust the 
opinion of those they ask, most people go no further in their search for 
sources than the person or business recommended to them.
Identifying potential referrals
So where do you find referrals? Here are the most common places:
	
✓	Family and friends: If you don’t yet have current clients, family and 
friends are a great place to start for getting referrals. Make sure that 
everyone you personally know is familiar with your new venture — what 
it is and what you do — and knows that you’re looking for customers to 
help get it off the ground. Most will be more than happy to help.
	
✓	Current clients: If you’re doing good work for your current clients (and 
you are, aren’t you?), they will refer friends and business acquaintances 
to you when asked for recommendations. Just make sure you don’t let 
your work with your current clients suffer as you take on new work — 
you need to walk a very fine balance in your business between deliver­
ing on your current work and developing new work.
	
	To help ensure that your clients will want to share you with others 
(don’t laugh; some may want to keep you all to themselves), be sure to 
meaningfully thank them for the referrals they make and consider pro­
viding additional incentives for making them. Examples of incentives 
depend on the kind of business you have but can include half off their 
next order or a free automobile detail.
	
✓	Business associates: Vendors and other nonclient business associates 
can be another rich source of referrals. If you have a good reputation in 
your field, and if they like you, they’ll gladly tell their business associ­
ates about you. Of course, they’ll be equally happy if you send some 
business their way, too.
	
✓	Other home-based businesses: Many home-based businesses are one-
person operations and, as such, can have a hard time dealing with the 
inevitable business peaks and valleys. Sometimes work is plentiful, 
sometimes not. In those times when another home-based business is 
overwhelmed, a good option is to farm the extra work out to a trusted 
and proven company — yours. Why not become the company of choice 
for other home-based businesses in your industry?

84
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
✓	Web-based referral services: Some businesses can benefit from Web-
based referral services. Many of these services are run by professional 
or trade associations. Others are independent, such as Yelp (www.
yelp.com) and TripAdvisor (www.tripadvisor.com).
Getting referrals for your business
Okay, now that you know where to find your referrals, exactly how are you 
supposed to get them? Unless you find a genie in a lamp on the beach, the 
best way is simply to ask. When you do good work for a client, thank her for 
choosing you, and let her know that referrals are welcome and appreciated. 
The following is a list of five other great ways to get referrals:
	
✓	Do great work. By far the best way to get great referrals is to do great 
work. People are proud of themselves when they find businesses that 
provide them with above-average services and products, and they want 
to tell others of their good fortune (and their good business sense). Do 
great work, and your clients and customers will be the best marketing 
tools you could ask for.
	
✓	Build a mailing list. A mailing list of all your referrals can be a power­
ful tool in your promotional efforts. Because they’re already presold on 
you and your business, your referrals will generally welcome hearing 
from you on an ongoing basis. A variety of great Internet e-mail-based 
services allow you to send periodic newsletters to your referrals for 
a nominal fee (or perhaps even for free if you’re a small user). Some 
of the most popular services include iContact (www.icontact.com), 
Campaign Monitor (www.campaignmonitor.com), Constant Contact 
(www.constantcontact.com), and MailChimp (www.mailchimp.
com). With just one click, your message is sent to your entire mailing 
list — whether it consists of one person or a thousand — in a matter of 
seconds. Your clients can opt into and out of your mailing list easily and 
with the barest minimum of muss or fuss. You can also track a variety 
of statistics if you like, such as actual click-throughs, messages sent, for­
warded, bounced, and delivered, and unsubscribed e-mails.
	
✓	Keep your mailing list informed. Many home-based business owners 
have discovered the value of keeping their referrals up-to-date with the 
latest news about their products and services. Not only do past and 
present clients enjoy reading such stories, but they also really enjoy 
reading about themselves. Make a point of playing up customer success 
stories as much as possible.
	
✓	Always send a thank-you note. People appreciate it when you take the 
time to thank them for sending you referrals. Whenever a new customer 
is referred to you, make a point of immediately sending a handwritten 
thank-you note to the referrer. It’s far better to take the time to personal­
ize your thank-you note than to just dash off a quick e-mail. You can also 
use a service like SendOutCards (sendoutcards.com) or Enthusem 

85
 Chapter 4: Marketing 101: Attracting Customers
(www.enthusem.com). Depending on the nature of your business, you 
can also send a small gift or a certificate good for a discount on your 
client’s next purchase.
	
✓	Make referrals yourself. As your business grows, you’ll soon find that 
people come to you seeking referrals. Pick out several high-quality and 
trusted companies to use for referrals, and be sure to let their owners 
know when you have sent a client their way. Not only will your clients 
be thankful for the referral, but the companies to which you make refer­
rals will also be more likely to make referrals to you. And don’t forget to 
post positive reviews on social networking business review sites, such 
as Yelp (www.yelp.com) and TripAdvisor (www.tripadvisor.com). 
Peter posted a review of his CPA last year on Yelp, and the CPA has 
since been contacted by many prospective clients who were impressed 
enough with the review to call.
Making use of public relations
In general, public relations (PR) means the release of information to the gen­
eral public to favorably influence its opinion about you, your business, or 
your products and services. Because of the nature of PR — and the potential 
for information to be broadcast over a wide area through print or electronic 
media — its successful execution can lead to your message being communi­
cated to an amazing number of people. If you handle your own public rela­
tions, the cost is minimal. If you farm it out to a consultant or PR firm, expect 
to pay $50 to $100 per hour or more.
Here are some of the most common — and effective — forms of PR:
	
✓	Publicity (newspapers, magazines, Internet, and other media): Have 
you ever seen a newspaper article about some hot new local business 
or a special-interest TV news story about the latest-and-greatest home-
based business opportunity? It’s no accident that that particular piece 
of news made it to your eyes and ears — the business being highlighted 
likely spent money to make sure it showed up on the media radar screen. 
The media thrive on interesting stories, especially human-interest ones 
with uplifting messages. By creating an interesting and positive story 
around your business — and getting it in front of the media — you can 
generate the kind of publicity you seek, drawing potential clients and 
customers in the process.
	
✓	News releases: News releases are brief summaries of company news 
that are specifically targeted at the media. The hope is that newspapers, 
magazines, radio, television, and other media outlets will find the news 
release newsworthy and give it exposure. Chances are, if the news is 
interesting, they will. The good news is that if the media pick up on your 

86
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
news release and publicize it, you’ll get wide distribution for free. To have 
the best chance of gaining the kind of reaction you seek from the media, 
be sure your news release is tailored to the particular interests of the 
media outlet you seek. A pitch to Oprah, for example, is going to be quite 
different from a pitch to an Internet radio show, which will be different 
again from a pitch written to your small, hometown weekly newspaper.
	
✓	Blog entries: You can submit information about your business to other 
people’s blogs that relate to your market. To build and keep traffic, blog 
sites need to update their content daily; therefore, they welcome con­
tent that others write.
	
✓	Letters to the editor: Anyone can write a letter to the editor about most 
any topic. Doing so is easy and offers a unique way to get your message 
in front of thousands of readers at a price that’s hard to beat: the price 
of a first-class stamp (or less, if you write via e-mail). If, for example, you 
own a home-based business that specializes in home security systems 
(alarms, deadbolt locks, and so on), you can comment on a recent arti­
cle about a rise in crime rates while throwing in a plug for the products 
and services that your company happens to sell.
	
✓	Speeches: Have you ever thought about making a speech to a local 
service club — say, a Rotary or Lions Club — or to local business orga­
nizations? All kinds of business associations, clubs, and other organiza­
tions exist in every city, and they tend to have lots of meetings. Guess 
what every organization needs for every meeting? A speaker. Whether 
you speak to your local chamber of commerce, the Society for Human 
Resources Professionals, or a local software special interest group (SIG), 
you have a great opportunity to promote yourself and your company by 
sharing your expertise with others. And you just may get a free lunch or 
dinner out of it, too (but beware: they don’t call it the rubber-chicken 
circuit for nothing).
	
✓	Seminars: Seminars are a way to generate new customers and clients — 
and make a few bucks in the process. Home-based financial planners, 
for example, often use seminars to generate business. Here’s how they 
work: You send out announcements for a free seminar, usually held at a 
nice local hotel, to prospective customers and possible referral sources. 
Rent out a meeting room at the hotel (much better than trying to jam 65 
people into your living room), and arrange for the seminar to be catered 
with a light meal and refreshments. During the course of the seminar, 
you provide attendees a lot of usable information and pass out bro­
chures, pamphlets, and other promotional material — all emblazoned 
with your company’s name and contact information. After the seminar, 
guess who the attendees’ first choice is whenever they have questions 
about the subject matter of the seminar or need help setting up their 
own personal financial plan?

Collaborating without getting lost
Q: We’re a new small business. We offer 
public relations, marketing, and fundraising. A 
local advertising agency has outsourced sev­
eral small jobs to us. Now the owner wants to 
include our names on his marketing materials 
but doesn’t want to use our company name. Is 
this standard business practice? It seems like 
he’s using our services to market his business.
A: Business-to-business collaboration is one of 
the major trends increasingly common among 
small businesses today. In researching our 
eBook On Your Own But Not Alone, we found 
that 65 percent of the business owners we 
interviewed — all of whom had been in business 
for more than five years — were teaming up in 
some way with other small businesses, and most 
wanted to do even more in the future. One mes­
sage was clear, though: In creating such collab­
orations, there’s no standard business practice 
unless it’s to say, “It’s all negotiable.”
We found ten types of strategic alliances that 
range from networking to virtual organizations. 
Many types of collaborations, such as joint ven­
tures and mutual referral agreements, involve 
each company promoting its own identity. In 
others, like satellite subcontracting and inter­
dependent alliances, the company that gets 
the business usually is the one whose company 
name is used on a particular contract. Here are 
the types of alliances we found:
	✓	Networking
	✓	Mutual referrals
	✓	Cross-promoting
	✓	Interdependent alliances
	✓	Joint ventures
	✓	Satellite subcontracting
	✓	Consortiums
	✓	Family/spouse collaboration
	✓	Partnerships
	✓	Virtual organizations
Kurt Zell, for example, has a production com­
pany through which he subcontracts work to 
independent camera and sound professionals. 
He gets the business and brings in independent 
professionals who work as part of his organi­
zation. They’re paid by Zell’s company, not by 
the client. In relationships like this, it would be 
highly unethical for a subcontractor to market 
his own business to clients brought in through 
the contractor.
In your situation, the ad exec evidently believes 
that including your names and expertise on his 
marketing materials will help him get more busi­
ness. For you, this arrangement could mean an 
inflow of new business with no marketing costs. 
But you must determine whether you see a 
downside to such an arrangement. If so, strive 
to negotiate a more desirable arrangement.
Among your options would be to suggest that 
you contribute to the cost of producing his busi­
ness cards and marketing materials in return 
for including your company name. Then you 
can agree to pay a referral fee for any business 
that comes directly to you from these materials 
or simply agree to bring the agency in on any 
business project arising from these materials. 
Alternatively, you can include his services on 
your promotional materials as a way of help­
ing you attract larger projects that include 
advertising.

88
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
One of the great things about public relations is that if you have a bit of time 
to spend, you can generate your own PR materials and make your own con­
tacts. And the more PR work you do, the better you’ll get at it. Not only will 
you become more confident in your abilities and savvy in how the system 
works, but you’ll also make contacts in the media and in your community that 
you can keep coming back to.
Taking advantage of direct marketing
Direct marketing means making direct contact with potential clients, most 
often by mailing or e-mailing them promotional messages. However you do 
it, the point is to get your message squarely in front of a decision-maker in 
a way that will capture his interest in just a few short seconds. Any longer 
and your prospect will likely throw your message in the trash — at no small 
expense to you and your business. Here are just a few ways to direct market:
	
✓	Direct mail: Although direct mail — or, ahem, junk mail — can be a 
major headache for many who receive it, when it’s targeted precisely to 
potential customers and clients, it can be a cost-effective way of getting 
your message in front of the people most likely to buy your products and 
services. You can target your prospects very precisely by renting mailing 
lists of people within specific demographic groups. Do you want to reach 
human resources managers only? No problem. People who live within 
a particular zip code? Easy. People who recently bought a house? Piece 
of cake. For a fairly reasonable fee, you can buy hundreds or even thou­
sands of up-to-date mailing labels for exactly the kind of people you want 
to reach with your message. Regardless of how much people complain 
about receiving direct-mail solicitations, enough of them usually respond 
to make them worthwhile. For more information on direct-mail marketing, 
check out the Direct Mail Association Web site (www.the-dma.org).
	
✓	Circulars and flyers: With a computer and a printer or photocopier, you 
can create all the circulars and flyers you could ever want, make thou­
sands of copies, and blanket your clients-to-be with them. Drop them in 
your direct-mail envelopes, or pass them around your neighborhood. 
With a little practice, you can create circulars and flyers in minutes, and 
the price is very easy on the budget. You probably won’t get as good a 
response as you would from a direct-mail campaign, but it’s certainly 
worth a try.
	
✓	Giveaways and contests: One of the tried-and-true methods of attracting 
the attention of potential clients is to give something away — the more 
attractive the prize, the more attention you’ll get. And that’s really the 
whole point of promoting your business: to attract your potential cli­
ents’ attention long enough to show them the benefits of your products 
and services.

89
 Chapter 4: Marketing 101: Attracting Customers
	
✓	Incentives: Businesses commonly use incentives to get prospective cli­
ents and customers to buy. Whether you offer two for the price of one 
or give a coupon for 10 percent off the next purchase, incentives are a 
standard tool in the marketing campaigns of many regular businesses, 
and they work just as well for home-based businesses.
	
✓	Newsletters: If you’re ready to get a bit more sophisticated in your 
direct-marketing efforts, consider creating a newsletter. Businesses 
create newsletters to provide customers and clients with value-added 
tools and information while also serving as a platform for promoting the 
company’s products and services. If you run a pet-sitting business out of 
your home, you can create a one- or two-page newsletter with the latest 
trends in pet care, along with plugs for your business. If you’re a lawyer 
who specializes in employment law, you can keep your clients up-to-
date on the latest developments in the field. Sending your newsletter by 
e-mail or fax lowers your costs and time investment.
	
	If you have neither the time nor inclination to create a quality newsletter 
yourself, consider hiring a home-based desktop-publishing professional 
to do it for you.
You can spend as little or as much as you want on direct marketing, but the 
results you get will be directly proportional to the amount of money and 
effort you put into preparing your direct-marketing pieces and precisely 
selecting the individuals who receive your message. Investing some quality 
time and money now will pay off big-time later.
Investing in advertising
When many people think about marketing, they’re thinking about advertis­
ing. Advertising your products and services can be an effective way to get 
the word out, but it can also be expensive (and, frankly, a waste of money 
for many home-based businesses). The key is to be sure that your advertise­
ments are specifically targeted and that you advertise in places where your 
potential clients are most likely to read or hear your message. Consider 
advertising in the following places:
	
✓	Yellow Pages ads: For many businesses, running a Yellow Pages adver­
tisement is essential. It can be expensive — in the thousands of dollars 
for an ad large enough to stand out — but effective. Can you imagine 
a successful plumbing, appliance repair, or tree-trimming business — 
home based or not — that doesn’t rely heavily on the Yellow Pages?
	
✓	Business directories: Business directories are another good way to get 
the word out about your company, as long as your potential clients and 
customers are likely to see your listing. Most directories have tradition­
ally been available in printed form, but an increasing number are now 

90
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
found on the Internet. With just a few mouse clicks, your clients-to-be 
will be able to find out more about your company and discover what it 
has to offer them.
	
✓	Web site or blog: Creating a Web site or blog to market your business 
and its products and services is a must for most businesses today, small 
and large. The good news is that starting up and maintaining a Web site 
or blog is easier and less expensive than ever. (See the “Going tech with 
Web sites, blogs, and e-commerce” section later in this chapter and 
Chapter 13 for more information.)
	
✓	Web site advertisements: Although banner advertisements have long 
been the standard method for advertising businesses on the Web, a 
relatively new innovation is taking hold: targeted advertising on search 
engines such as Google (in Google’s case, called AdWords) that is 
geared to specific keyword searches. If you’re a home-based plumber, 
for example, you can have your business show up at the top of the list 
whenever someone does a keyword search for faucet repair. You don’t 
pay unless the person doing the searching clicks your listing. Relative to 
print, radio, and TV ads (which are quite expensive), Web site advertise­
ments are a bargain. Better yet is getting links to your site from as many 
other high-traffic Web sites as you can.
	
✓	Your own radio or TV show: Would you like to get your message out to 
thousands of people every week? Why not host your own radio or tele­
vision show? If your business is interesting enough to generate public 
interest, you have a real shot at it.
Going tech with Web sites, 
blogs, and e-commerce
More businesses than ever are moving to establish a presence on the 
Internet, and being e-commerce-capable is rapidly becoming the stan­
dard worldwide. Despite challenges facing an organization that decides to 
market itself on the Web (getting your site noticed in a sea of millions is 
just one challenge), having a Web site or blog is still a great idea for many 
home-based businesses. If your company doesn’t yet have its own site, 
chances are it soon will. The simple fact is that building and maintaining 
a Web site or blog is now considered to be essential to any organization’s 
marketing plan — just as important as printing brochures; placing ads in 
targeted publications; networking with potential clients; and performing 
other, more traditional marketing activities.
At its heart, a company Web site or blog is nothing more than a glossy, full-
color brochure — with a twist: The Web site is available to potential clients 
instantly, anywhere in the world, at any time, day or night. It can be inter­
active (as in the case of a blog, where you can post your thoughts anytime 

91
 Chapter 4: Marketing 101: Attracting Customers
and then have visitors post their responses), and it allows you to respond 
to visitor queries, communicate with clients in real time through online 
chats and message forums, and provide customers a place to research your 
products — and buy them.
Today, any business can have a Web site or blog, including home-based busi­
nesses. Our advice is that if you believe your sales will benefit by establishing a 
Web presence for your business, make creating a Web site or blog a priority.
Growing a repair business
Q: Is my business doomed? I do carpentry and 
household repairs, and although I have some 
business, it’s just not enough. I don’t have any 
money left to do the kind of advertising I know I 
should do. I’m not much of a salesman. Is there 
hope for me?
A: Yes, there’s hope. Many people don’t have 
much sales and marketing experience before 
starting their first home business and can feel 
quite overwhelmed by the relentless chore of 
finding enough business. Surveys show that 
getting business remains the number-one con­
cern of small and home-based business owners 
year after year.
Advertising is expensive because, to be effec­
tive, it must appear again and again in publi­
cations where your targeted customers are 
looking when they need your services. In a 
business like yours, if you can afford to, we 
advise getting an enhanced Yellow Pages list­
ing and localized listings on Yahoo! Get Local 
and SuperPages. And (for free) you can list on 
craigslist for your city at www.craigslist.
org. In addition, you can actively market your­
self in several other low-cost ways, including 
the following:
	✓	Build a list of all the people who have 
regular interaction with potential custom­
ers who want and need services like yours 
right now — not “someday.” For example, 
real estate agents who have just sold new 
homes or who have clients trying to sell a 
home but needing to make improvements 
to get their price may fill the bill. Or how 
about home inspectors who have discov­
ered problems in the homes they inspect? 
Contact these people by phone or in person, 
and let them know about you and your ser­
vice. You aren’t selling when you contact 
them; you’re just getting acquainted and 
making sure they know how to reach you.
	✓	Put these people’s names into a data­
base, and send them something monthly. 
Consider, for example, a tips newsletter, a 
postcard about a special offer, or a news 
clipping related to home improvement.
	✓	Offer mini-workshops or seminars at 
hardware stores on do-it-yourself home 
improvements. You may be surprised by 
how many people realize they need help 
after hearing about what they “can” do 
themselves — especially if your mini-
workshops or seminars are free.
	✓	Arrange to leave a specially produced 
booklet or newsletter at hardware stores. 
If you’re not already familiar with the soft­
ware necessary to produce a professional-
looking booklet or newsletter, consider 
hiring a desktop-publishing professional to 
do it for you.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Even if your business is a local, high-touch one, a Web site or blog is impor­
tant because
	
✓	It increasingly serves in lieu of a printed or mailed brochure — one 
that can be updated immediately. A Web site or blog is a much faster 
and generally more convenient way for your potential customers to get 
information about your products and services. Instead of waiting to 
receive a brochure in the mail, they can type in your Web site address 
and obtain the information they’re looking for in seconds.
	
✓	With a clear majority of homes and businesses having Internet access, 
increasingly people are going online to check out businesses they’ve 
heard about or been referred to. To not be there when they click is to 
ensure losing business. For this reason, it’s a good idea to use your busi­
ness name as your Web site address. Only a little more than 10 percent 
of all Web sites are found in search engines, so you want to make finding 
your business on the Web as easy and intuitive as possible.
Is creating a Web site a good idea?
Q: I’m a photographer and sell most of my work 
through art fairs. Recently, more and more 
people are asking me if I have a Web site. I 
don’t, but I’m starting to wonder if I should. What 
would the advantages really be, and would they 
be worth both the time and the money?
A: Having a Web site for any business is fairly 
common today. We interviewed hundreds of 
home-based businesses for The Best Home 
Businesses for People 50+ and found that the 
majority of them have Web sites, which is 
about double the percentage we found when 
we interviewed people for a book that came out 
in 2000. But there are some holdouts.
You won’t be surprised to find out we think 
having a Web site is worth it. On the up side, 
we found many people, from interim executives 
to former brick-and-mortar shop owners, who 
get their business or do their business from the 
Web.
Because photographs are visual, selling your­
self and your work via a Web site is a natural. 
You can sell your images on your own Web 
site. However, we believe you should put up a 
Web site only when you’re able and willing to 
keep it up. A Web address that yields a “Cannot 
find” message or is obviously out-of-date works 
against you, particularly if you’re using your site 
to attract photography clients.
So if you’re not ready for your own site, 
you can sell your images on such sites as 
Photographers’ Portfolios at www.vsii.
com/portfolio/homeport.html and 
Portfolios Online at www.portfolios.com.
We suggest visiting the sites of other pho­
tographers and talking with them about their 
experiences. For example, nature photogra­
pher Ernest Hori has a site at www.horizen
foto.com; portrait photographer Mary Ann 
Halpin has one at www.maryannhalpin.
com; and Joseph Sohm shows his work at 
visionsofamerica.com.

✓	The Web is becoming the new Yellow Pages. Getting listed in search 
engines and exchanging links with sites that people are likely to turn to 
when looking for your kind of business is good business for you.
But what if you know nothing about creating a Web site or blog? How do you 
go about making one happen? Will you have to spend thousands of dollars to 
get your Web site up and running, or do you have more affordable options? 
We address these and other questions in detail in Chapter 13.

Whenever you want to achieve a measurable goal within a specific period of 
time, you greatly enhance your chances of doing so by having a plan. Plans 
make your goals real: They organize and prioritize your actions, and they tell 
you how close you are to achieving your goals.
A marketing plan summarizes all your marketing goals and strategies, along 
with the actual methods you can use to achieve them, and states milestones 
and deadlines for achieving your goals. It’s not the same as a business plan, 
which takes a much broader look at your business goals and plans, including 
marketing. In essence, a marketing plan answers the following questions:
	
✓	Who are your target customers and clients?
	
✓	What are your unique product attributes and advantages in the 
marketplace?
	
✓	Where will you focus your marketing efforts?
	
✓	When will you implement each step in your marketing plan?
	
✓	How much revenue do you expect your marketing plan to generate, and 
how much will it cost you to generate that level of sales?
If you’ve read through some of the earlier sections of this chapter, you’re 
probably already thinking of lots of ways to start marketing your products 
and services. You may be ready to start up a Web site, seek referrals, or 
create an e-mail newsletter for your current customers and clients.
	
Your marketing plan belongs to you, and you can make it as simple or as com­
plex as you want. If you’re just starting, a one-page or even a one-paragraph 
plan may be just right. As your company gets bigger, you may see benefits in 
expanding your plan to meet its growing needs.
The following sections review the five key parts of a good marketing plan.

94
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Part 1: Overview
Also known as an executive summary, the marketing plan overview provides a 
glimpse of your overall plan without bogging the reader down in the details 
that are presented later in the document. Upon reading the overview, a 
reader can get a pretty good idea about your overall marketing strategy, 
market focus, product focus, and the tactics and programs you plan to put 
into effect. Projected revenues — the estimated amount of money you intend 
to bring into the business during the period of the plan, as well as the budget 
required to achieve that level of sales — are also important parts of the mar­
keting plan overview.
Part 2: Marketing objectives
Marketing goals and objectives define the targets that you hope to achieve in 
your marketing efforts. Your goals may be modest (to increase sales 10 per­
cent a year for the next three years, for example) or quite ambitious (to be 
the company of choice whenever anyone in the nation needs a dog groomed).
This section of the marketing plan should, at a minimum, include
	
✓	An overall objective for your marketing efforts (for example, to become 
the preferred source of Internet solutions for doctors and dentists)
	
✓	Several specific marketing objectives, such as units sold, market share 
(the percentage of the overall market that your company commands), 
or distribution channels (planning that 25 percent of your sales will be 
through Target stores, for example)
	
✓	Basic financial objectives, such as total sales and profit for the year
Part 3: Situation analysis
This part of the marketing plan reveals what’s going on in the marketplace: 
who your competition is, which products are similar to yours, what their 
relative success is, what the market trends are, and so on. The idea is to 
develop a good understanding of your customer base, its needs and wants, 
and your strengths and weaknesses relative to the competition. Be sure to 
include the following:
	
✓	A summary of the demographics (the characteristics of a population, 
such as age, gender, income, and so on) and economic, technological, 
and social trends that impact your customers: You can get this informa­
tion through the Internet or the reference section of your public library.

95
 Chapter 4: Marketing 101: Attracting Customers
	
✓	A list of your key competitors, including strengths, weaknesses, 
products and services, market share, and other key information: See 
Chapter 7 for how best to collect this kind of information.
	
✓	A brief discussion of your target customer, as well as his or her wants 
and needs: You should know your customer as well as you know the 
back of your hand — perhaps even better.
	
✓	A summary of your key products and services: This summary needs to 
include a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages versus the 
competition.
	
✓	A discussion of your current distribution channels (if any): This 
discussion needs to address how they help or hinder the product 
marketing process.
Part 4: Marketing strategies
For every key marketing objective listed in your plan (see the “Part 2: 
Marketing objectives” section), you should have one or more marketing strat­
egies for achieving it. Include a minimum of the following:
	
✓	Specific features of your products and services that you can use to 
help you market them, such as convenience, speed, ease of use, and 
so on: Consider why people will buy your products and services instead 
of someone else’s.
	
✓	A pricing strategy for your products and services: To find out more 
about the fine art of product pricing, check out Chapter 7.
	
✓	Specific strategies to promote your products: For ideas on promoting 
your products, see the “Marketing: Taking Different Roads to Meet Your 
Goals” section.
	
✓	Specific strategies for getting your products and services into the 
hands of your customers and clients: These strategies include using 
e-commerce and developing relationships with distributors, for example.
Part 5: Financials
This part of the marketing plan takes all the words in the previous sections 
and turns them into numbers — specifically, dollars and cents. An annual 
marketing plan gives financial information for an entire year and may be 
broken down into months or quarters. Be sure to include the following:

96
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
✓	Detailed projections of anticipated revenues and percentage growth 
(or decline) — by product or service — from the previous period: For 
example, you may anticipate revenues of $55,000 for the year, reflecting 
10-percent growth from the previous year.
	
✓	Detailed projections of expenses required to obtain the projected rev­
enues: For example, you need to account for expenses such as attending 
industry conferences, including roundtrip airfares, hotels, taxis, and the 
cost of meals.
	
When putting your marketing plan into action, consider using Paul and Sarah’s 
5/5/5 approach to marketing. The 5/5/5 approach involves using five different 
avenues for reaching prospects and initiating and following through on five 
different activities every day, week, or month, depending on how much busi­
ness you need (daily, if you have little or no business yet; weekly, if you have 
some but need more; monthly, if you have ample business and want to be sure 
you sustain it). This approach is the best way we’ve found to be sure you’re 
doing the level of marketing activity you need to succeed. You can get further 
details in their book Getting Business to Come to You.
Putting an idea into action
Q: I’ve drawn up a plethora of sketches of blue 
jeans, and now I’m satisfied with one I think the 
public would rush to purchase. How do I pro­
ceed with manufacturing and finding a buyer?
A: Some business experts may view the idea of 
a solo novice designer like yourself going head-
to-head in a highly competitive field of giants 
like Levi’s and Lee to be a pipe dream. But 
we’ve seen too many people defy the odds to 
discourage you from proceeding if you’re suffi­
ciently passionate, committed, and determined. 
The novice designers we’ve seen succeed have 
done so in two ways: by carving out a highly 
specific niche, such as designing specialized 
clothing for yoga devotees, orthodox Jewish 
professional women, or people with physical 
disabilities; or, for a mainstream item like jeans, 
by starting small and building up an avid follow­
ing for a unique design that makes their line 
desirable to sales reps and retail stores.
So before leaping into mass production here or 
abroad, we suggest offering your jeans directly 
to what you hope will be a mad rush of avid 
buyers by making (or hiring someone to make) 
several dozen pairs and selling them yourself. 
You can do this at swap meets or sidewalk 
booths (as Ash Hudson did with his wildly popu­
lar Conart T-shirts) or by placing them in a few 
select boutiques (as Anna and Sarah Levinson 
did with their brightly colored Ripe Cosmetic 
nail polishes). After your jeans begin selling 
rapidly and attracting growing numbers of cus­
tomers, you can arrange for mass production 
and contact reps or buyers — if they haven’t 
sought you out already.
You can contact reps through the Manufact-
urers’ Agents National Association (MANA) at 
One Spectrum Pointe, Suite 150, Lake Forest, 
CA 92630; phone 877-626-2776; Web site 
www.manaonline.org. Another source 
of assistance for creating and distributing 
your product is a site called Launch Your Line 
(www.launchyourline.com).

Creating a Sustainable Income 
in Challenging Times
In This Chapter
▶	Picking out businesses that succeed during challenging times
▶	Developing a business that can make it through the good times and the bad
▶	Taking a look at businesses that work well during improving times
S
tarting a new home-based business doesn’t come with any guarantees 
that it will succeed. No matter how many hours you put into it, or how 
much money you throw at it, if you don’t have the right business idea at the 
right time for the right customers at the right price, it may not become a sus­
tainable source of income for you over the long run — it’s that simple.
	
The trick is to come up with a business idea that matches your passion with 
the realities of the marketplace.
In this chapter, with both past and recent history in mind, we identify home 
businesses you can start and do well with during an economic downturn, as 
well as those that do better in economic good times when people are earn­
ing enough money to buy creative and everyday products and services from 
others instead of doing without or making or doing them for themselves. 
We also take a look at a few businesses that can survive both good and bad 
economies.
The point is no matter what the economic environment may be, you can 
find plenty of home-based business opportunities out there that match your 
passion with an income that can sustain you and your family for as long as 
you like.

98
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Recognizing that People Behave 
Differently in Bad Times
What people will pay for and how much they’ll pay for it varies according to 
both their own personal economic situations and the state of the economy as 
a whole. For example, in bad times, three out of four people buy more basic 
goods and services but less of everything else. Sales of premium-quality items 
and services like HBO and Showtime movie channels go down with the econ­
omy, as do everyday expenditures on haircuts and shots for the family dog. The 
numbers of coupons used and everyday value items bought, however, go up.
Still you may ask, “Is an economic downturn really the time to start a home 
business?” The answer may surprise you because it’s “yes.” First, consider 
past experience. The Great Depression of the 1930s gave birth to Hewlett-
Packard, Polaroid, Revlon, and Texas Instruments, all of which have survived 
more than one economic downturn since. The downturn of the 1980s gave 
rise to Microsoft, Genentech, The Gap, and The Limited. In fact, more than 
half of the Fortune 500 companies started in downturns. What about a down­
turn makes the creation of new and successful companies possible? First, 
such company startups have to consciously make cost-effective decisions 
and be innovative in their products and processes. Second, many of their 
competitors may have disappeared. Third, you can acquire technology at 
commodity prices during economic downturns, which lowers the overall cost 
of getting a business underway.
	
People today are having to relearn a life lesson that their grandparents and 
great-grandparents learned long ago — that they can’t always count on a grow­
ing economy. Sure, everyone hopes the economy will do well, but with compe­
tition from countries like China (already number one in auto sales), India, 
Brazil, and Russia, the future will most definitely be different from the past. 
Whether the economy goes up as fast as it went down or continues to slide, 
you need to start a business that can ride the waves of the economy. For a few 
examples of great businesses that last, make sure to check out Chapter 17.
Identifying Businesses That Work 
Well in a Down Economy
The economy naturally cycles between boom and bust — it always has and 
it always will. Regardless of what kind of economy you find yourself in when 
you read this book, however, you can find plenty of business opportunities 
that work in any kind of market. In this section, we focus on the opportunities 
that are particularly effective during down economic times.

 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
Assuring affordable energy
Everyone needs affordable energy — it’s a basic human necessity to survive 
today. Here are some businesses that serve this basic human need and, thus, 
are successful even in times of economic turmoil:
	
✓	Alternative energy installation and consultation: In the second edition 
of this book, we wrote about “living off the grid” as a trend that would 
feed the demand for businesses installing devices that captured solar, 
wind, hydro, and geothermal energy. Now with continually increasing 
energy costs, improvements in these technologies, and more govern­
ment subsidies that lower their costs, the demand for alternative energy 
is growing among households and businesses in cities and towns across 
the country, as well as among farmers eager for methane digesters. Find 
out more about these alternative energies at Home Power Magazine’s 
Web site, www.homepower.com.
	
✓	Energy and building performance auditing and rating: After the shock 
wears off when a home or building owner gets a jarring fuel bill — 
whether it’s for electricity, propane, or natural gas — he seeks ways to 
cut his costs, which is one reason why the demand for energy auditors 
continues to grow. New construction is another reason. Building codes 
everywhere require — or soon will — energy efficiency. Both develop­
ers and building owners win from using the services of an energy auditor 
because energy efficiency can increase a building’s value by an estimated 
20 dollars for each dollar in annual energy savings. If you’re interested in 
energy auditing, check out Green and Save (www.greenandsave.com), a 
company that offers both training to become an energy auditor and affili­
ation with its force of energy auditors, who are scattered throughout the 
country.
	
✓	Chimney sweeping: In addition to the fact that many people choose to 
use their chimneys to help heat their homes during economic down­
turns, the increasing number of wood pellet stoves adds to the chimney 
sweep market. Fire safety also prompts a continuing need for chimney 
sweeps because creosote builds up in chimneys and stovepipes and 
because birds and raccoons like to make homes in chimneys, resulting 
in 25,000 fires a year. Check out this business at the National Chimney 
Sweep Guild’s Web site at www.ncsg.org.
	
✓	Smart meter installation: Smart meters are electricity meters that help 
reduce energy use; they’re becoming more and more popular with hom­
eowners and business owners alike as both groups of people try to cut 
fuel costs and utilities. Some utilities use independent contractors to 
install smart meters, which is where you come in. Find out more about 
smart meter installation and its increasing prevalence across the globe 
at www.smartmeters.com.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Helping others reduce and reuse
Tough times bring a variety of diverse business opportunities out of the 
woodwork, especially businesses that focus on helping people become more 
resourceful and environmentally friendly in their lifestyles and homes. Some 
of the best and fastest growing of these opportunities include the following:
	
✓	Environmental remediation or cleanup: Even in a down economy, 
problems like mold, lead paint, asbestos, moisture, radon, contaminated 
soil, and buried hazardous waste demand attention. Home and build­
ing owners may discover such problems themselves, or the issues may 
turn up in the environmental assessments that most commercial real 
estate transactions involve. For this reason, the need for environmental 
remediation and cleanup businesses is always present. People in the 
environmental remediation business assess the nature and extent of 
certain environmental risks on homes and other buildings and then get 
their hands dirty cleaning up the less-than-hospitable environments. A 
number of organizations offer training and certification in environmental 
remediation, including the Environmental Information Association (www.
eia-usa.org). Whichever organization you choose for training, make 
sure it’s approved by the Environmental Protection Agency.
	
✓	Green services: Businesses providing green services are already hatch­
ing like rabbits around the world, and the consequences of climate 
change and energy costs will continue to spur their growth even more. 
When we did the first edition of this book, we didn’t conceive of many 
of the newer ones that have emerged since then, including bike-sharing 
programs, businesses that provide bicycle commuters a place to store 
their bikes, bike-repair services, organizations that provide places to 
change from riding clothes into business clothes, and companies that 
offer central order pick-up zones where shoppers can collect packages 
delivered from multiple stores in one place. Other green services we’ve 
featured before have become more commonplace. For example, more 
and more people are choosing green burials and need to have press­
board or cardboard coffins made.
	
✓	Remodeling: The most active market for people in construction in a 
down economy is remodeling because when economics require people 
to stay where they are, instead of moving up, they remodel. A grow­
ing remodeling specialty is serving the ballooning numbers of seniors 
who choose independent living over institutional care but find that 
their homes need various alterations. For example, they may need a 
first-floor master bedroom or newly adapted bathrooms and kitchen. 
Another growing market is green remodeling to make homes and busi­
nesses more energy efficient, environmentally friendly, and sustain­
able. Key remodeling resources include the National Association of the 
Remodeling Industry (www.nari.org) and the National Association of 
Home Builders Remodelers Council (www.nahb.com).

 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
Fulfilling day-to-day business needs
The majority of businesses need support services of all kinds every day — 
regardless of whether the economy is good or bad. Hence, businesses that 
fulfill these day-to-day support needs for other businesses can expect not 
only to work well in bad economic times but also to thrive in good ones. Here 
are some of the most lasting business-support opportunities:
	
✓	Bookkeeping: Bookkeeping has been around since ancient Babylonia. 
When times are tough, businesses frequently outsource this service 
to cut back on staffing costs, which increases the demand for indepen­
dent bookkeepers. In addition to relieving business owners of the daily 
duties of handling the books, bookkeepers can also reach into the realm 
of forensic work by helping identify errors that creep into accounting 
software. Some bookkeepers have other specializations, too, such as 
payroll or accounts receivable. Still others serve only specific types 
of clients like chiropractors, retail shops, or restaurants. Clearly, the 
opportunities in this field are many. Check out the American Institute of 
Professional Bookkeepers for more information about becoming a pro­
fessional bookkeeper (www.aipb.com).
	
✓	Business support services: The business support services field encom­
passes all forms of administrative work needed by small companies 
and professionals — anyone in fact, who’s without the time, desire, or 
resources to do her own administrative work. Support services include 
preparing spreadsheets or databases; word processing; editing, format­
ting, and proofreading documents; transcribing; drafting correspon­
dence, proposals, and reports; and much more. Like with bookkeeping, 
businesses frequently outsource their support services to independent 
assistants during economic downturns. Some people who provide sup­
port services to other businesses call themselves “virtual assistants” 
because they can do much of their work electronically. Sites that bring 
together companies and individuals seeking to get discrete tasks done 
and people looking to do them are Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (www.
mturk.com/mturk/welcome) and Short Task (shorttask.com). The 
International Virtual Assistants Association has a mentor program and 
offers certification (www.ivaa.org).
	
✓	Computer consulting: Almost all businesses depend on technology, 
but most small business owners don’t have the inclination or possess 
the skills to deal with the problems of installation, upgrades, compat­
ibility, repairs, malware, spyware, viruses, worms, or the crisis that 
follows when the company Web site goes down. Thus, computer con­
sultants keep busy even during down economic times. They may even 
get calls from business owners who are eligible for their manufacturer’s 
technical support but need support faster than the manufacturer can 
provide. Resources for computer consultants include the Institute for 
Certification of Computing Professionals (www.iccp.org) and the 
Independent Computer Consultants Association (www.icca.org).

102
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
✓	Tax preparation: Nearly one out of every two adults uses a tax pre­
parer or accountant to prepare his or her taxes, according to a recent 
nationwide survey. The inevitability of taxes and their ever-increasing 
complexity keep tax preparers busy during all types of economies. Most 
states don’t require a license to become a tax preparer, but those people 
wanting to obtain credentials in this field can, with some self-study, 
become an enrolled agent by passing a federal exam. Tax reviewers are 
specialists in the tax preparation field — they help people resolve costly 
mistakes and problems with IRS collections. Check out www.taxsites.
com for a list of tax preparation–related resources.
	
✓	Web services: The Web is an area that provides constant business 
opportunities, and it will continue to do so far into the future. It will 
change from Web 2.0 to 3.0 and inevitably result in tons of work for Web 
designers, specialty programmers, search engine optimizers, content 
writers, Web promotion specialists, and Webmasters. Everything you 
see and do on the Web required someone to design it and others to 
maintain it. The Web holds countless opportunities for people interested 
in starting their own businesses. For example, you can specialize in a 
type of work, such as creating tools to use on social networking sites, 
or you can serve a single industry or profession. O’Reilly Media offers a 
wide range of book titles, training, and conferences that introduce you 
to virtually every Web service topic you need (or want) to know about 
(www.oreilly.com).
	
✓	Paralegal services: These services provide practical services to attor­
neys and clients at lower fees. Independent paralegals draft wills, draft 
divorce papers, review legal documents, such as leases, and depending 
on state law, may do so with or without the supervision of an attorney. 
Some paralegals do contract work for law firms by working from home 
virtually. The demand for paralegals is projected to grow more than 20 
percent over the next six years. Check out the American Association for 
Paralegal Education for more information (www.aafpe.org).
Meeting healthcare needs
The cost of healthcare in the United States is quickly approaching unsus­
tainable levels, and, as a result, healthcare organizations are increasingly 
outsourcing work to less-expensive home-based businesses. At the same 
time, necessity and technology are giving rise to alternative ways to deliver 
standard healthcare — online doctors and telephone triage nurses, for 
example — which means new opportunities for a growing number of work-
at-home professionals.
Despite the recent economic downturn, the prevalence of alternative or sup­
plementary healthcare providers has grown. Examples of this alternative or 
supplementary medicine include acupuncture, biofeedback, Chinese medicine, 

103
 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
chiropractic, homeopathy, hypnosis, naturopathy, and yoga. Although the 
appeal of alternative medicine has been to supplement conventional medicine 
in the past, these days an increasing number of patients appear to be seeking 
it to save money. Lucky for you, you can run most of these alternative prac­
tices out of your home office or deliver them directly to the homes of patients. 
Check out www.healthlinks.net for more information.
The bottom line is that patients in poor economies seek less-expensive 
healthcare alternatives, such as the following:
	
✓	Disease management: If helping patients with chronic conditions while 
largely or wholly working at home appeals to you, consider the growing 
field of disease management. Disease management programs are grow­
ing because, first of all, they save money and, second of all, more people 
are suffering from conditions requiring supervision, such as asthma, 
congestive heart failure, diabetes, coronary artery disease, end-stage 
renal disease, high-risk pregnancies, depression, and chronic obstruc­
tive pulmonary disease.
	
	Disease managers phone patients on a scheduled — or at least regular — 
basis to discuss whether they’re taking their medications, what they’re 
eating, and how they feel overall. Sometimes patients use testing devices 
to convey data to their managers’ computers; face-to-face education may 
also be involved. Disease managers specialize in one disease or condition 
and have experience in general healthcare, too. Disease managers may 
be independent operators who contract with insurance companies as 
patient agents, with assisted living operators, or with patients directly. 
Check out the Disease Management Association of America’s Web site 
(www.dmaa.org) for more information.
	
✓	Patient champion: Although some hospitals have designated staff or 
volunteers who serve as patient advocates, patient champions are part of 
an emerging professional health field that fulfills this advocate role with 
independent practitioners. Patient champions receive compensation for 
their savvy tenaciousness, their ability to communicate with medical 
personnel with respectful firmness, and their lack of discomfort in being 
in hospitals and around sick people.
	
	Patient champions must have permission from their patients or their 
legal representatives to discuss the health or treatment of their patients 
in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996. Patient champions who specialize in children must know 
about guardianship rules and child rights. One way you can gain expe­
rience in this field is to secure work as a mystery shopper for the more 
than 150 companies that measure and improve the levels of service of 
healthcare providers (go to www.mysteryshop.org for more info). 
Check out the Health Advocacy Toolbox at www.cthealthpolicy.
org/toolbox for more information about this growing field.

Here are six more, quick-fire healthcare possibilities you can do from home. 
Covering them in great detail is beyond the scope of this book, so, for more

✓	Telephone triage nurse: Staffs telephones, taking calls from individuals 
experiencing health emergencies and evaluating and deciding whether to 
send the patient to an emergency room or advise a next-day appointment 
(American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing: www.aaacn.org)
Providing alternative-living services
People are increasingly adopting alternative lifestyles — perhaps even more 
so during the recent economic downturn. This increased interest in alterna­
tive living translates to a growing need for businesses to help people adopt 
their new lifestyles. Interestingly enough, you can provide many of these new 
services from home. Here are just a few of the promising alternative-living 
services home-based businesspeople are starting to provide:
	
✓	Custom bicycle making: The making of bicycles has gone beyond the 
high-end custom, super-light, carbon-fiber cycles that can cost more 
than $2,000 to practical cargo bikes, which are suitable for delivering 
freight, and ecobicycles, which provide electric-powered ways to make 
home and local deliveries. For example, Dave Ewoldt from Tucson builds 
bike trailers for transporting cargo in his side yard. He also teaches 
others the skills they need for light bike manufacturing (check out www.
attractionretreat.org/TI/Trailers for more info). You can find 
ideas on designing your own practical bike carts at bikecart.pedal
people.com. You can also take orders for custom-made bikes from a 
Web site like bikes.urbanoutfitters.com.
	
✓	Hauling: Today’s hauling services aren’t just beat-up trucks who come 
and take away the stuff you don’t want. The new face of hauling consists 
of rickshaw vans and trike bikes that deliver small loads (usually less 

105
 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
than 600 pounds) to stores and restaurants. Trike bikes are three-
wheeled vehicles with a platform or storage box over the rear wheels; 
they’re sometimes battery-assisted. In replacing trucks, they conserve 
energy and space on crowded streets. As gasoline prices continue 
to rise, so will the use of this type of hauling. Even hauling away old 
appliances and furniture, garden trimmings, and construction debris 
has a spiffier look with blue and white enclosed trucks or bikes 
and uniformed personnel. You can get a franchise to be a hauler at 
www.1800gotjunk.com. But you don’t need a franchise to do hauling; 
you can start a home-based hauling company from scratch. To add to 
your income as a hauler, you can sort through the junk you haul and sell 
anything valuable before taking the rest to the dump.
	
✓	Home repair services: Who doesn’t need a handyperson close by? In 
today’s economy, while real estate agents are twiddling their thumbs, 
handypeople who are knowledgeable, reliable, and trustworthy are 
booked up weeks ahead. As a handyperson, you can repair, install, or do 
whatever else your clients need done to their homes at affordable rates. 
Keep in mind that California state law limits the handyperson to doing 
only jobs worth up to $500, and other states limit the kind of tasks a 
handyperson can do. Even so, a home-based business in this field can be 
very successful and is ideal for people who can solve problems quickly. 
Check out www.handyman-business.com and www.bejane.com for 
more info.
	
✓	Horseshoeing: Like many people, we assumed that blacksmiths like the 
ones in Western movies went the way of horse and buggies long ago. But 
actually more horses are living in the United States now than in the 19th 
century, and most of them need shoeing. People in this specialized field of 
making horseshoes are known as farriers. Farriers need to understand the 
anatomy and physiology of horses’ legs because they also care for injuries 
and diseases of horses’ hooves. The physicality required of this trade 
can result in wear and tear on the human body, so it isn’t something you 
can expect to do into your senior years. Check out the American Farrier’s

✓	Inventing: Recessions are a golden age for inventing. After all, the 
photocopier, electric shaver, and car radio all came into being during 
the 1930s. In today’s economic recessions, inventors and their inven­
tions have the added benefit of Web access. First, they can turn ideas 
into products by using crowdsourcing sites like The Cambrian House 
(www.cambrianhouse.com), Kluster (www.kluster.com), and The 
Crowdfund Company (www.crowdfundcompany.com). Inventors can 
use crowdsourcing to brainstorm, rank ideas, find funding, and solve 
problems by taking advantage of the ideas of many people. Then, to sell 
their products, they can use social networking sites to make contacts 
with corporations who may end up buying directly from the inventors.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
	As an inventor, however, you need to be cautious about companies that 
ask for an upfront fee to promote and market your invention but do not 
deliver what they promise. Before employing the services of any com­
pany, check out whether other inventors have had complaints with the 
company. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (www.uspto.gov) has 
a public forum for making complaints publicly available.
	
✓	Massage and Yoga: People haven’t spent any less money on massages 
during the recent economic downturn, probably because in addition to 
making people feel better, evidence shows that massages lower tension 
and fatigue (two things most people have been feeling a lot of lately). In 
fact, many companies are now bringing the services of massage thera­
pists and yoga instructors into the company because they provide a 
low-cost employee benefit that results in workers who are more alert 
and accurate. Many individuals also use massage and yoga as lower-
cost alternatives to medical and pharmaceutical treatment for common 
chronic health problems, such as tension, fatigue, neck and shoulder 
pain, and stress. For more information, check out the American Massage 
Therapy Association (www.amtamassage.org), the Associated 
Bodywork and Massage Professionals (www.abmp.com/home), and The 
Yoga Site (www.yogasite.com).
	
✓	Mobile services: Mobile services save customers time and money on 
gasoline; plus, they’re a way to gain an edge on location-based com­
petitors. Examples of services now being taken to where the customer 
is include auto glass repair or replacement, auto body repair, dent 
removal, screen repair, bicycle repair, dog grooming, hair cutting 
and styling, knife sharpening, medical services, and notarizing. For an 
extreme example, someone has even created a mobile wedding chapel 
on the back of a fire truck. This chapel goes anywhere for $2 a mile and 
$200 for the preacher’s services, who happens to also be the driver. And 
at least three German firms offer mobile bike repair. The shops are, of 
course, attached to bikes. Can you think of anything you can turn into 
a mobile service by using a van, a trailer, a car, a retrofitted vehicle, or 
even a bicycle? If you can, you may have just found your next home-
based business!
	
✓	Psychic services: The more people are stressed by a shrinking econ­
omy, the more they turn to psychics, astrologers, palm readers, Tarot 
card shufflers, numerologists, and other paranormal specialists. Psychic 
services can generate fees of $80 to more than $300 an hour. Two types 
of people predominate this field — those who have strong subjective 
impressions of clients and are able to communicate them and people 
who are skilled at reading astrological charts and reporting what the 
charts reveal. Check out the American Federation of Astrologers, Inc., 
for more on this branch of the psychic field (www.astrologers.com).

✓	Selling products on the Web: When we can’t find something we need at 
a local store, like many people, we turn to the Web where we invariably 
find whatever it is we’re looking for. Shopping online easily develops into 
a habit. So whether you have an information product, such as eBooks, 
or items you’ve handcrafted, you can sell them on the Web via your own 
Web site, your eBay account, a storefront on Yahoo!, or an online mall 
or gallery like www.etsy.com. Craigslist (www.craigslist.com), a 
kind of online classifieds, gives you access to the world and, thereby, 
self-selected people who want what you have. As you start selling online, 
follow these three tips: (1) Carefully search the Web to find other sites 
that are selling what you want to sell to find out what they do well and 
what you can do to give yourself an edge. (2) Provide extraordinary and 
prompt customer service, even though doing so may mean having access 
to your store or auction account nearly 24/7. (3) Before investing in an 
e-commerce platform on your Web site, test your products on other 
marketplaces.
	
✓	Sewing: When the economy is down, people want to alter or repair their 
clothing rather than buy new stuff, so sewing is always a way to make 
money when times are tough. Sewing for money can take many forms. 
For instance, many people want to sew their own clothing, so you can 
teach sewing in classes or private sessions. People with special physical 
problems, such as spine curvature, mastectomies, severe arthritis, pree­
mies, and wheelchair-bound people want and need clothing that’s suited 
to their requirements, so you can make special clothing for special 
groups of people. Other markets for custom sewing and design include 
making clothes for special occasions like weddings and proms, party 
costumes, theatre costumes, custom uniforms, and clothing for mem­
bers of religious groups with rules for what they can and cannot wear. 
The Home Sewing Association (www.sewing.org) lists sewing instruc­
tors and offers free lessons on how to sew.
	
✓	Tabletop manufacturing: If you would have bought an Altair or IMSI 
personal computer in the 1970s, you may be ready to embrace tabletop 
manufacturing. Tabletop manufacturing is basically three-dimensional 
printing. Using melted plastic, powder, gel, and — depending on the 
machine — other materials, tabletop machines can make auto parts, 
bone implants, sculptures, and more. Eventually, these machines may 
produce parts for Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, and other orphan vehicles 
when the mandatory period that car companies have to supply parts 
expires. Tabletop machines for under $5,000 are available today, but 
they’re limited to making small objects. Check out fabathome.org and 
www.desktopfactory.com for more information; once equipped, you 
can bid for work at www.100kgarages.com.

Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
Selling affordable luxuries
Although the overall luxury-goods market is one of the first things to feel the 
pain in down economic times, affordable luxury goods and services become 
even more popular. After all, everyone likes to treat himself to something 
nice every once in a while. Consider some of these business opportunities 
tailor-made for home-based businesses:
	
✓	Direct selling: Direct-selling organizations grow during economic down­
turns. Although the Web — particularly social networking — can sup­
port direct sellers, three-quarters of all direct selling is done one-on-one 
in person or at party events (group selling) at people’s homes. Such 
party events are a low-cost way for your customers to socialize and 
have a good time — with a chance to shop, of course. While the range of 
products sold covers the gamut — from air filters to wine — the largest 
categories of merchandise being sold are personal-care items like cos­
metics, jewelry, skincare, clothing, weight-loss products, and vitamins. 
All these items are affordable luxuries. For most people, direct sales is a 
part-time business with low startup costs. In fact, be wary of companies 
charging more than a few hundred dollars to get started. Some sites to 
look at are www.dsa.org and www.mlmsurvivor.com. (Also check out 
Chapter 2 for a lot more information about direct-selling opportunities.)
	
✓	Skin care: Although people sacrifice spending on many items during eco­
nomic downturns, they continue to spend money on anti-aging skin care 
products. Some companies even report increases in sales on skin care 
products, including those with luxury ingredients like crushed gemstones 
and nanoparticles of gold. If you’re a licensed esthetician and wish to 
lower your overhead with a home-based salon, check whether your state 
and local zoning regulations permit you to do so (www.beautytech.
com/st_boards.htm).
	
✓	Travel services: Economic downturns and high gas prices may restrain 
the urge to travel, but they don’t eliminate it. To fill this ever-present 
urge, people replace vacations to faraway places with “staycations” 
or “nearcations.” Destinations near major population centers attract 
vacationers and day-trippers. The types of travel businesses suitable to 
poor economic circumstances are original local tours like the Brooklyn 
Pizza tours (www.asliceofbrooklyn.com) and bed and breakfast inns 
(check out the Professional Association of Innkeepers International at 
www.paii.org for more info).
	
	Medical tourism is a growing specialty as people discover they can 
obtain expensive medical procedures at a fraction of what they cost 
in the United States by traveling to other countries (www.medical
tourismassociation.com). Ecotourism is another bright spot in the 
travel industry. The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) defines 
ecotourism as “responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the 

109
 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
environment and improves the well-being of local people.” TIES offers 
online courses that lead to certification in sustainable tourism manage­
ment on its Web site (www.ecotourism.org). People have a huge 
appetite for travel even in challenging times, so the key is finding out 
how to make travel possible and affordable.
Creating a Business That Can 
Ride the Economic Waves
Throughout the first part of this chapter, we identify the home-based busi­
nesses we believe have the best potential to prosper in economic downturns. 
But one lesson we’ve learned from the past is that no one has a foolproof 
crystal ball. New opportunities from new technologies will continue to arise, 
some technologies that showed promise won’t gain market acceptance, and 
established businesses will fade or require such retooling that they won’t be 
recognized by the same name. That’s the process, the opportunity, and the 
price of an economy in an era in which change is normal and in which some 
dreams disappear as new ones arise.
But even though you can’t know exactly what the future holds, you can build 
a lasting business that will be able to ride the waves of the economy for years 
to come. In the sections that follow, we explore some of the approaches you 
can take to do so.
Choosing to serve nondiscretionary needs
The recession that began in September 2008 provided us with information 
about what people are willing to cut from their expenses and what they con­
tinue to spend their money on. An American Pulse survey by BIGresearch 
revealed that the top ten items people considered to be necessities in late 
2008 were, in rank order:
	
✓	Internet service
	
✓	Basic cellphone service
	
✓	Basic satellite or cable TV service
	
✓	Clothing (if purchased at discount)
	
✓	Hair care
	
✓	Fast-food meals
	
✓	Casual sit-down meals

110
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
	
✓	Charitable contributions
	
✓	Vacations
	
✓	Fast casual dining
	
The more your home business serves something people regard as a necessity, 
the more you raise your chances of success in any economy. Consider that the 
top three items on this list wouldn’t have been there in the last deep recession 
of the early 1980s — a lesson of how vital it is for businesses to adapt.
In line with what the survey found, spending on personal care, such as hair 
salons, barber shops, and skin care providers, actually rose 4.5 percent from 
April 2008 to April 2009. Spending on other personal services not identified as 
necessities — such as trips to spas, entertainment, dining in fine restaurants, 
and purchases for the home — decreased.
Cushioning yourself locally and virtually
Some home businesses are inherently local, meaning that your customers are 
located within your community or within driving distance of your commu­
nity. For instance, no one has discovered a way to install a home theatre, pro­
vide midwife services, or do pest control via the Web, so those businesses 
have to be local. On the other hand, you can provide Web design services or 
business-support services for clients anywhere in the country or even the 
world. In addition to determining the kind of marketing you do, your choice 
of whether to build up your business locally or virtually determines from 
where your income comes. In the economy we believe is emerging, home 
businesses that can derive income from both within one’s community and 
from elsewhere via the Web have more potential to be resilient.
Fortunately, the Web enables more and more businesses to serve both local 
and distant customers. You can expand many primarily locally focused busi­
nesses, such as sewing and tutoring, simply by providing services and selling 
information and products online.
Crowdsourcing locally and virtually
Crowdsourcing enables businesses to capitalize on a Web version of an old 
adage that has proven correct again and again when tested with research: 
There’s wisdom in crowds. Crowdsourcing starts with putting up an announce­
ment or making a call on a Web site, asking a large number of people to get 
involved in or respond to some task. Wikipedia (for information), YouTube (for 
videos), and Flickr (for photos) are all forms of crowdsourcing.

111
 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
The advantage of crowdsourcing is that groups of people are better in pre­
dicting outcomes than most experts. For example, Wikipedia is comparable 
in accuracy to the Encyclopedia Britannica, and businesses both large and 
small use YouTube, one of the most popular sites on the Web, to communi­
cate with the world. Crowdsourcing works when the group is diverse and the 
members don’t influence one another and when, for no or little money, the 
members provide content or solve problems.
	
Participating in crowdsourcing can benefit a home business far more than 
looking things up in a dictionary. For instance, you can get others’ help in 
naming your business at namethis.com/name_this/ (by participating as a 
member, you can also earn money) and get help making decisions at www.
hunch.com and www.quirky.com.
Another form of crowdsourcing can lead to new business by enabling people 
with specific skills to bid on projects that customers put up on the Web. A 
few online marketplaces for creative services include www.crowdspring.
com, kluster.com, and 99designs.com. Travel agents can bid for clients 
at www.zicasso.com and www.orbitz.com.
	
For other recent examples of crowdsourcing, check out en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Crowdsourcing.
Telescoping your niche
Consider this rule of thumb: When times are good, specialize in a niche you 
cultivate; when times aren’t so good and money is tight, telescope that niche. 
Telescoping is our term for extending or adding to the range of services you 
provide to existing customers without undermining your reputation for the 
business specialty you’ve developed. Telescoping your niche means offering 
to do work for your customers that they ordinarily would’ve had to do for 
themselves or would’ve had to turn to another specialist for. Because your 
customers are already working with you, why not have them turn to you for 
additional services you know you can provide? For example:
	
✓	If you’re a tax preparer and notice a client is downsizing his bookkeep­
ing staff, you may offer to do his bookkeeping as an outside service.
	
✓	If you’re a real estate agent and your potential client is concerned about 
whether her home will sell, you can also offer to stage the home so it’s 
presented in the way most attractive to buyers. Staging results in a 
quicker sale and a higher price, which makes your customer (and you) 
very happy.
	
✓	If you’re a travel agent helping a bride and groom with travel arrange­
ments for a destination wedding out of the country, you can offer to 
coordinate with the wedding organizer in the distant locale.

112
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
As you can see, telescoping enables you to expand what you offer in a 
down economy and then to narrow your services again when the economy 
improves.
Trading time and goods 
when currency is short
In addition to everyday bartering, which we discuss in Chapter 11, other 
forms of nonmonetary exchange can keep your business going when times 
are tough. These alternative means of exchange can play a valuable role for 
many businesses in both good times and bad — getting your business started 
when cash is short; obtaining goods and services your cash budget may not 
cover; and developing relationships in your community. The primary types of 
alternative exchange are
	
✓	Time banks: A time bank tracks the time its members spend doing some­
thing for other members. As one member provides a service for another 
member, he accumulates “time credits,” which he can then “spend” on 
time for what he needs from other members.
	
	Unlike with bartering, in which everything exchanged is valued at 
market price, in a time bank, all time is valued equally. Each one hour 
of service provided equals an hour of credit one can use for another 
service. So, for example, a bookkeeper who charges $35 per hour 
can get advice from a lawyer who bills at $250 per hour. Their time is 
valued equally, which makes for a great deal for the bookkeeper and 
an improvement on what an attorney gets for doing pro bono work or 
having empty hours on the calendar. Another benefit is that because the 
values are equal in time bank exchanges, they aren’t taxable.
	
	Time banking is occurring in communities worldwide. One may already 
be set up in your community. If you’re interested in starting one, check 
out the following Web sites to find out more information:
 
• www.timebanks.org: Offers a start-up kit and a lot of other help­
ful information about time banks
 
• www.besttimebank.org: Provides information on how to get an 
IRS ruling to make a time bank nontaxable
	
✓	Community currency: Local currencies, also called complementary cur­
rencies, are another means of alternative exchange. As communities 
adopt them today, community currencies are gaining more and more 
media attention, but they go back many years. For example, the Swiss Wir 
was started during the Great Depression and is still going strong today.

113
 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
	
	Most U.S. community-currency programs were inspired by and based 
on the model of Ithaca HOURs in Ithaca, New York; Paul Glover started 
this currency in 1991. Find out more about it at www.ithacahours.
com. Local currencies are one of the programs of the E.F. Schumacher 
Society, an organization devoted to building local economies (www.
schumachersociety.org/about.html).
	
✓	Local exchange trading system (LETS): LETS is a type of local exchange 
system that eliminates coins, tokens, notes, or any other form of printed 
money usually required for exchange of local goods and services. 
Instead, members of LETS centrally track and record transactions, usu­
ally by using computer software available specifically for this purpose. 
For example, a massage therapist may earn credit by giving a massage 
to another LETS participant and then use that credit to acquire a service 
from a handyperson or any other participant. To find out more about 
LETS, check out www.gmlets.u-net.com.
Paul and Sarah describe more about these exchange systems in their eBook, 
Charging What You’re Worth.
Saving money and keeping 
your overhead down
One of the best ways to build a sustainable business is to keep your costs 
(also known as your overhead) down. When’s the last time you took a close 
look at your expenses with an eye to becoming lean and mean? We suggest 
you take a good look now, and here are some of the best places to start:
	
✓	Phone expenses:
 
• Consider using voice over IP (VOIP) services, such as Skype, 
Net2Phone, Google Voice, and Vonage, rather than a land line, but 
realize that land line services may be more audible at times and 
that you lose VOIP service during power failures. So you may want 
to have one land line on hand.
 
• If you have a land line, check to see whether you can obtain a 
Yellow Pages listing with only a residence line.
 
• Make outgoing calls on a residence line even if you need a more 
expensive business line to have a Yellow Pages listing.
 
• Compare telephone long-distance rates on sites like www.abell
tolls.com to find the best deal for you.

114
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
 
• If you need to decrease your marketing budget, use less costly or 
no-cost ways of marketing yourself (marketing over the phone or 
the Web, for example), but don’t decrease your overall effort. The 
most successful companies maintain or increase their marketing 
during economic downturns.
	
✓	Auto expenses:
 
• Use sites like autos.msn.com/everyday/gasstationsbeta.
aspx and gasbuddy.com that compare gas prices by zip code to 
get the best deal.
 
• Fill up your gas tank when it’s half empty because half-empty tanks 
contain less air. The presence of air in your gas tank causes evapo­
ration, so the more air you have, the more gas you lose to 
evaporation.
 
• Fill up your gas tank in the early morning when the gas is densest. 
Because fuel storage tanks are buried in the ground, as tempera­
tures rise, the gas expands, and the gallon of gas you get in the 
morning costs less than the gallon you get in the afternoon.
 
• When filling your tank, choose the slow mode by squeezing the 
gas nozzle. The slow mode minimizes the vapors you create when 
you pump — the more vapor you have, the less room you have for 
gasoline.
 
• Don’t buy gas when the gasoline truck is at the station filling the 
storage tanks. As the truck pumps the gas in, dirt that usually sits 
on the bottom of the storage tank is stirred up, and you’ll likely 
suck some of it into your gas tank, which can make your vehicle 
run less efficiently and can damage fuel injectors.
	
✓	Utility bills:
 
• Compare the costs of alternative ways to heat your home and 
office. Paul and Sarah find wood pellets a lot cheaper than pro­
pane, for example. You can compare your heating alternatives at 
the Department of Energy’s Web site (www1.eere.energy.gov/
calculators).
 
• Apply e-coating film to your windows. This do-it-yourself project 
keeps the heat in during cold weather and out during hot weather.
 
• Use a programmable thermostat to save energy costs; a program­
mable thermostat allows you to lower or raise temperatures at 
various times of day or night based on need.
 
• Replace conventional light bulbs with compact fluorescents. Better 
yet, as they become affordable, choose LED bulbs, which last ten 
times longer than compact fluorescent bulbs.
 
• Check out — and use — the numerous energy-saving tips on sites 
like www.coned.com/customercentral/energysavings.asp.

 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
Businesses Best Suited for 
an Improving Economy
Although each of the businesses we describe in the following sections can 
also work in times of economic downturns, we consider them more vulner­
able to economic forces than the businesses we list in the previous sections. 
We aren’t suggesting that you rule out the following businesses during a 
down economy, but we are suggesting that you look long and hard at these 
opportunities before committing to them.
At the same time, when the light at the end of the tunnel begins to get 
brighter, keep in mind that these businesses often offer great opportunities 
as the economy gains strength and prosperity returns.
Offering services to other businesses
The first expenses that many businesses cut out of their budgets when 
times get tough are outside services. However, when the good times return 
(which they always eventually do), the need for business-to-business ser­
vices surges. Here are a few examples of great businesses to get into as the 
economy improves:
	
✓	Business coaching: Business coaches help companies improve per­
formance by working with managers, giving them feedback on their 
management styles, and developing skills they need to do well in their 
companies and get ahead in their careers. They help key personnel 
communicate more effectively, make intelligent decisions, and deal with 
burnout. Recent estimates show that about half of all companies now 
use coaches to some extent, and a study by Booz Allen Hamilton showed 
a $7.90 return for every dollar invested in executive coaching because it 
produces better teamwork and higher retention. Most business coaches 
charge between $100 and $500 an hour, so it’s one of the highest paid 
and fastest growing areas of coaching. Visit the Worldwide Association 
of Business Coaches (www.wabccoaches.com) for more information.
	
✓	Consulting: The wide world of consulting appeals to a wide variety of 
people because it offers you a way to turn your expertise, experience, 
and years of accrued wisdom into a livelihood when salaried jobs are 
either no longer available or no longer appealing. Sometimes becom­
ing a consultant is as easy as having your former employer retain you 
on a contract, enabling you to develop other clients while you bring 
in income that may be less or more than you earned as an employee. 
Indicative of the many possible consulting opportunities out there, more 
than 150 associations of consultants offer membership to consultants 
of different fields, including business review and planning, computing, 

116
Part I: Beginning at the Beginning 
creativity, crisis control, organizational development, financial advice, 
introduction of new technology, marketing, strategic planning, training, 
business turnaround, and all forms of technical assistance.
	
	Regardless of which field they’re in, effective consultants are part coun­
selor, parent figure, shrink, stern disciplinarian, and, of course, problem 
solver. Be sure to check out Consulting For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Bob 
Nelson and Peter Economy (Wiley), for more information.
	
✓	Customer support: If you enjoy talking and you think choosing your own 
hours sounds good, you can join hundreds of thousands of Americans 
who work semi-independently as “agents” in the customer support 
industry. Companies recognize that gaining a new customer costs five 
times more than retaining an existing one, so they invest a lot of money 
in customer support and increasingly are contracting with United 
States–based companies to carry out this vital aspect of their business. 
If you have a successful work history of relating to customers, you can 
be up and running in this field within two weeks after completing the 
necessary training.
	
	The largest customer support training companies are LiveOps (www.
liveops.com), Working Solutions (www.workingsol.com), and 
Arise Virtual Solutions (www.arise.com), which also engages people 
who do technical support. Each of these companies has its own way 
of operating — you may need to incorporate yourself or you may have 
to work as an independent contractor — and entry costs vary. If you 
prefer to be employed, take a look at Alpine Access (www.alpine
access.com).
	
✓	Editorial services: Editorial services take many forms — copy-editing, 
line editing, developmental editing, proofreading, indexing, and more. In 
addition to working as an independent contractor for print publishers 
and corporations, the digital age has brought new editorial opportuni­
ties. Each year hundreds of thousands of self-publishers share their 
information, opinions, and stories with the world in both print and 
eBook form. Many of these self-publishers turn to independent editors 
for help; still more need to be enlightened to the value of well-edited 
material. Every journal, business report or proposal, and technical train­
ing manual, whether it’s published in print or electronic format, virtually 
requires editorial work.
	
	An as-you-wait editing service (www.gramlee.com, for example) is 
entirely Web based and can easily be done in a home office. In this 
specialty, your customers submit documents to you electronically and 
you return them within two hours, editing complete. If you don’t have 
publishing experience and editing is a new career for you, copy-editing 
and proofreading are among the easiest fields to break into. The U.S. 
Department of Agriculture Graduate School offers a self-paced course in 
editing and proofreading (www.grad.usda.gov). Find several editorial 
groups at www.linkedin.com.

 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
	
✓	Grant and proposal writing: Most of the many nonprofit organizations 
that accompanied the economic downturn of 2008 either failed or suc­
ceeded based on their abilities to obtain grant funding. Typically, people 
who form nonprofits don’t have the time, desire, or skill set needed to 
write effective grant proposals. However, as one proposal writer told 
us, “Any writer with good skills can do this work, whatever your back­
ground. As with lawyers, it doesn’t matter who your client is — if you 
can write logically and can understand the subject enough to explain 
it, you can write a grant proposal.” In addition to nonprofits seeking 
government or foundation funding, local governments also use grant 
proposal writers to gain funds from state, federal, and foundation funds.
	
	Grant writers usually work on an hourly or project basis; some funders 
pay grant writers a percentage of the proceeds of the grant if it’s 
awarded. However, most grant writers don’t work on a contingency 
basis. The American Grant Writers’ Association offers courses in grant 
writing; check them out at www.agwa.us.
	
✓	Interim or contract executives: One consequence of the retirement of 
the baby boomer generation and the much smaller generation that’s 
replacing it is that corporations are more willing to contract out for top 
executive roles. Thousands of companies are seeking interim, contract, 
or short-term executives for positions like CEO, CFO, and CIO, as well as 
managerial roles in marketing, purchasing, and other departments. Some 
of these interim assignments are part time, and some are full time; either 
way, they’re usually limited to periods from several months to several 
years. You can seek out client companies yourself or enroll with services 
that broker or place interim executives, such as Interim America (www.
interimamerica.com) or Your Encore, Inc. (www.yourencore.com).
	
✓	Technical writing: Constantly changing technology brings with it the 
need for manuals and other materials that introduce it to consumers, 
sell it, explain how to use it, service it, assemble it, install it, and so on. 
The pace of innovation has been accelerating for more than a hundred 
years, and it’ll likely continue to do so as innovation shifts abroad, par­
ticularly to China, which is investing heavily in science and technology. 
Companies often contract out for technical writing projects, some of 
which can extend over several months or more. Technical writers can 
also find work making technologies created abroad understandable 
and usable by English-speaking sales engineers and technicians. Check 
out the Society for Technical Communication (www.stc.org) for more 
information about this field.
	
✓	Translation services: Translation services are essential in a global 
economy — contracts, instruction manuals, software menus and com­
mands, scripts for dubbing, subtitles for films, and much more all 
require translation. Accurate machine-based translation is still years 
away, but the Web allows a translator to respond instantly to a request

for services. MyGengo (mygengo.com), for example, hires home-based 
translators, who begin work almost immediately when a client types or 
pastes content into the MyGengo Web site. Working for a site like this 
is one option for translators, but most U.S. translators operate as inde­
pendent home businesses. Translating technical documents in growing 
technology fields and Web content are two high-demand specialties 
for translators. If you prefer oral interpretation and are willing to work 
from places other than your home, courts and hospitals need accu­
rate interpreters to work onsite. Check out the American Translators 
Association (www.atanet.org) for more information.
	
✓	Web writing: The Web has opened up new markets for writers. Some 
pay quite well, as is the case when you write blog and Web site con­
tent for many companies or organizations; others require a lot of work 
to produce much income. Sites like www.dailyarticle.com, www.
constant-content.com, www.associatedcontent.com, and www.
helium.com broker writers’ works. Some of these sites require writ­
ers to transfer all rights of their material; others let the writer specify a 
license for reusing her content. The site www.scribd.com has a store 
where writers’ can sell their work, and, of course, eBook writing is a 
growing market. Writing projects that offer the best pay are business 
writing, such as annual reports, company newsletters, and speeches 
for executives, ghostwriting, and copywriting for selling and promot­
ing products and services. To get started as a professional Web writer, 
choose a topic or focus that motivates you to become an expert in that 
topic; then develop that expertise. Check out www.publishersmarket
place.com and www.writersdigest.com for more information.
Appealing to clients who 
have money to spare
No matter what the economic climate may be — sunny, stormy, or partly 
cloudy — people love to shop. And when clients have money to spare, you 
can bet that money won’t stay in their wallets for long. The following are two 
big items people are likely to spend money on when they have extra money 
to spend:
	
✓	Functional art: Functional art brings together the aesthetic with the 
practical. It satisfies two appetites — the quest for beauty and the inter­
nal desire to get a value for the money you invest for items in your home 
and business. Artists who create functional art apply their skills to cre­
ating everyday objects imbued with a handcrafted beauty and artistry 
that manufactured products can’t attain. In addition to creating original 
work, functional artists also turn existing items that were once simply 
functional into something artistic, like transforming file drawers or cat 
litter boxes into unique furniture or accessories, for example.

119
 Chapter 5: Creating a Sustainable Income in Challenging Times
	
	The key to functional art is that when people perceive something as 
handmade art, they’re willing to pay a higher price for it than they would 
for any machine-tooled version of the same item. For current examples 
of such handcrafted work, check out www.functionalartgallery.
com and www.etsy.com; for current trends in taste, check out www.
hgtv.com.
	
✓	Home theater installation: Unlike the sales of most consumer electronic 
products, sales of home theater components not only held their own 
during the recent economic downturn — they increased. Many people 
try to install their own theatres but find the task overwhelming or the 
result unsatisfying. For example, even when you sufficiently connected 
the components and attuned them to one another, the TV may not be 
placed in the right light, or the speaker placement may not produce the 
desired surround-sound effect. These people often turn to experts in the 
field for help.
	
	Many installers report getting a significant portion of their work from 
customers whose previous installers’ work was inadequate. So you can 
see that even people who have already had home theaters installed (or 
have installed them themselves) often turn to experts in home theaters 
for assistance when they need it. If you have experience in one of the 
relevant skills for home theatre installation (electricity, networking, 
electronics, and so on), an understanding of how sound works combined 
with a penchant for precision, and decent customer service skills, you 
can build a business largely fed by word-of-mouth referrals. Check out 
www.highdefforum.com for more information.
When people have extra money to spend, they’re also likely to spend money 
on products and services designed to help them with day-to-day living or 
family events. Here are some quick-fire examples for you to consider (along

oney definitely makes the world go ’round — in life 
and in business. Home-based businesses are no 
exception. In this part, we explain the fundamentals of 
financial management, starting with how to keep track of 
your money. We consider how to price your products or 
services to maximize your return and then examine health 
insurance and retirement. We wind up this part with an in-

f there’s one thing that keeps people from starting their own home-
based businesses, it’s probably concern over money. Where will the 
money you need to start up your business and keep it running come from? 
Will there be enough to allow you to quit your current job, support your 
family, or at least pay some bills? How will you know whether you’re making 
money — or losing it?
The key to answering all these questions is financial management. Financial 
management is one of the main points of focus for any home-based business, 
and proper financial management requires a good system of bookkeeping, 
as well as constant attention to the numbers. Your business’s finances aren’t 
something you should leave to chance. In this chapter, we take a look at how 
to manage your finances so that your finances don’t manage you.
Organizing Your Finances
In most large businesses, tracking cash — where it comes from, where it 
goes, and how it’s used — is one of the most important administrative func­
tions. Large corporations like Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart, and ExxonMobil may have 
thousands of people working in their finance and accounting departments. 
Clearly, tracking cash is important to them!

126
Part II: Managing Your Money 
	
Cash serves many functions in a business: It’s a way to keep score, a way to 
measure the profit generated by different products and services, and a way to 
reflect the equity built by the company’s investors and owners. Plus, cash 
serves as more than just a yardstick for performance; it also enables compa­
nies to pay employees and purchase supplies and services.
Indeed, cash is the focal point of most organizations — both large and small. 
When you have a small home-based business, cash — or the lack thereof — 
can quickly make or break you.
Why do you have to worry about keeping your business finances organized? 
Isn’t that shoebox in which you keep all your personal receipts sufficient for 
your home-based business, as long as you have enough money to pay your 
bills and yourself? Not quite. Keeping your finances organized and accurate is 
important because you need adequate financial information about your busi­
ness to do the following:
Should you hire an accountant?
Do you need an accountant to help you keep 
track of your business’s finances? The answer 
to this question depends on how capable you 
personally are in handling your own bookkeep­
ing, accounting, taxes, and financial strate­
gies, and on how complicated your business is. 
Some business owners love to take care of the 
administrative tasks involved in running their 
own businesses; others hate it. Some home-
based businesspeople are naturally skilled at 
doing financial tasks; however, the talents of 
others are better suited to delivering products 
and services to their customers. In addition, 
doing your own bookkeeping and account­
ing takes time and discipline — you have to 
regularly update your records and periodically 
check them for errors.
If, for example, your finances are fairly simple, 
you’re computer savvy, and you have sufficient 
time and interest to keep your records up-to-
date by yourself, you can use a software pack­
age such as Quicken or QuickBooks to do your 
own bookkeeping. Simply input your receipts 
and expenses, and the program performs every 
accounting function and trick you can imagine. 
You can generate all kinds of financial reports 
and graphs (which your lenders will want to see 
when you need to borrow money to grow), write 
checks, and collect the information you need to 
do your taxes.
If, however, your business isn’t simple, or 
if you’ve got a unique business setup (for 
example, if your home-based business is a C 
corporation instead of the more common sole 
proprietorship), getting the help of a profes­
sional bookkeeper or accountant may be worth 
your time and money. When looking for profes­
sional assistance, avoid choosing someone out 
of the Yellow Pages or from a random Internet 
search — you never know what you’re going 
to get. Instead, ask your home-based business 
friends or colleagues in the area for referrals to 
a good accountant or bookkeeping service — 
preferably one that specializes in handling busi­
nesses like yours.

127
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
	
✓	To know where your business stands — whether it’s profiting or losing 
money and whether expenses are out of line with income
	
✓	To apply for loans and receive credit from vendors and suppliers
	
✓	To prepare your federal and state income taxes
	
✓	To provide accurate and up-to-date financial info to interested buyers in 
the event that you decide to sell your business
Can your shoebox do all that? We don’t think so! But it’s not all about what 
your shoebox can or can’t do. It’s also about the value of your time. Consider 
how long it may take you to do something you don’t do well and what your 
hourly rate is. Now compare that amount of time and money to how long it 
would take an expert to do the same thing and what his or her rate would be. 
In many cases, you actually save money by hiring a professional accountant 
or bookkeeper. Time really is money, and you need to dedicate the majority of 
your time to what you do best — and what brings money into your business.
Setting Up a Business Account
When you set up your company’s finances, the first step is to establish a 
separate bank account for your home-based business. Although the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) doesn’t require you to separate your business finances 
from your personal finances, take our word for it: It makes things a lot easier 
when you prepare your taxes. If you don’t establish this separation from the 
get-go, you may spend hours and hours first trying to identify the business 
expenses in your personal checking account or credit card receipts and then 
pulling them out and classifying them.
At minimum, you need a checking account for your business, although a 
savings account and even a retirement account may be good ideas, too. 
Setting up a new checking account is easy, particularly if you’ve already 
established a personal account at the bank or other financial institution 
where you choose to set up your business account. Drop by your friendly 
local bank, fill out a form or two, deposit a bit of money (or transfer it from 
an existing account), and pick out your check design. In minutes, you’ll be all 
set. Remember, though, that most banks require your company’s employer 
identification number (EIN) if you’re setting up an account for anything other 
than a sole proprietorship, so have your EIN handy.
	
If you set up a new account in the name of your business (not in your own 
name) — particularly if the account isn’t with the institution where you do 
your personal banking — you may find that the bank places holds on checks 
you deposit over a certain amount of money, say $500 or $1,000, making your 

128
Part II: Managing Your Money 
funds inaccessible until they clear the originating bank. These holds can 
remain in place for a couple of days to a week or more, and needless to say, 
they can cause you and your business major problems if you need your cash 
right now. The good news is that your bank will likely lift the requirement to 
put holds on deposits to your business account after your business estab­
lishes a record of stability (a process that can take anywhere from a few 
months to a year or more). If your bank doesn’t automatically lift the require­
ment, be sure to ask your bank manager to lift it.
	
One more thing: Consider applying for a credit or debit card that you use only 
for your business. Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express all offer 
cards that are specifically geared to the unique needs of small business users. 
These companies can provide quarterly spending reports by employee — 
breaking down your charges into specific categories, such as retail, restau­
rant, lodging, and telecommunications — and give discounts on business 
services, extended warranties on equipment purchased with the card, and 
many other benefits. Debit cards issued with a Visa or MasterCard insignia are 
particularly flexible because they can be used as either debit (or, often, ATM) 
or credit cards, depending on the situation and your personal preferences. 
The choice is yours.
Accepting Credit Card Sales
If you sell products, you probably want to be able to accept credit card pay­
ments. In fact, as a way to improve your cash flow, you may want to require 
that your clients pay you by credit card before you deliver their product 
orders or services.
Although many home-based businesses don’t need to be able to accept 
credit card payments, others — particularly home-based businesses that 
sell products — do. If you have the kind of business that’s suitable for taking 
credit card sales — perhaps you sell dollhouses, computers, or rare records 
through your Web site — you gain many of the following advantages when 
you accept credit cards:
	
✓	Customers — particularly those customers who would rather not wait 
to send a check or payment through the mail before you ship their 
orders — appreciate the convenience of being able to use their credit 
cards to make an immediate purchase.
	
✓	People who use credit cards to purchase items tend to spend more 
money per transaction than non–credit card customers.

129
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
	
✓	You get your cash from the transaction much more quickly than when 
you invoice your customers and let them pay later, improving the cash 
flow of your business. A credit card payment is immediately directly 
deposited into your bank account.
	
✓	You reduce or even eliminate internal paperwork that results from 
invoicing customers and following up on delinquent payments.
	
✓	Your business appears more established and credible than businesses 
that don’t accept credit cards.
Being able to accept credit cards is definitely a good thing. As with many 
other good things in life, however, accepting credit cards isn’t free. In fact, 
you have to pay a price for the privilege.
Knowing the costs of credit 
card transactions
How much will accepting credit cards cost you and your business? The 
answer depends on what kind of business you operate (retail, mail order, 
or Internet), who processes your transactions, and how much money you 
submit for processing (the overall dollar amount of your transactions).
Here are the typical costs you can expect to pay to the company that pro­
vides your credit card processing:
	
✓	Setup charges: Including application fees, these fees range anywhere from 
free to $300 and more. Plus, you have to pay software licensing fees and 
purchase equipment if you plan to use a point-of-service terminal instead 
of just using your computer’s Internet access. If the setup charge is free, 
expect to pay higher transaction fees to make up for the free setup.
	
✓	Transaction fees: For each transaction, you’re charged a flat fee that 
may range from $0.20 to $0.50 per transaction.
	
✓	Discounts: These fees are percentages taken from each order, and they 
range from less than 2 percent to 5 percent or more.
	
✓	Monthly charges: These charges include a statement fee, a monthly 
minimum if the discount and transaction fees don’t equal a monthly 
minimum, and leasing fees if you lease instead of buy equipment.
	
Accepting credit cards is definitely not a free service, but if the level of your 
sales justifies it, it’s a small price to pay — and can be offset by the price of 
just one or two bad checks. However, before you sign up for a service, care­
fully compare a variety of different providers. Prices and services vary widely, 
and you can definitely find some deals better than others.

130
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Establishing a merchant account
Before you can accept credit cards, you have to find a bank, credit card com­
pany, or other merchant account provider that will grant you merchant status 
or allow you to open a merchant account — that is, authorization to accept 
credit card payments. This process isn’t quite as easy as you may think; in 
fact, for a new business or one that credit card companies consider to be 
risky, gaining merchant status can be downright difficult. Here’s a list of the 
kinds of businesses that credit card companies consider particularly risky 
(and that may make getting approval more difficult):
	
✓	Adult Web sites
	
✓	Dating services
	
✓	Prepaid telephone cards
	
✓	Online casinos
	
✓	Massage services
	
✓	Online pharmacies
	
✓	Mall kiosks (seasonal/independent)
	
✓	Ticket brokers
If you’ve been in business for some time (at least two or more years), you’re 
not involved in a particularly risky business, and you have a good credit his­
tory, you should have no problem getting merchant status. Of course, until 
you apply, you’ll never know for sure.
	
One caution: Different companies charge vastly different prices to create and 
maintain a merchant account for you. Do your research thoroughly, and com­
pare prices. You may also be able to get better terms going through a mem­
bership organization or company, such as Costco, that provides access to 
merchant accounts. Some companies falsely represent themselves as indepen­
dent sales organizations (ISOs), and eager merchants have been scammed. To 
determine whether the ISO you’re talking with is legitimate, ask for the bank 
the ISO is affiliated with and then contact it to verify the status of the ISO. You 
can also check with your local better business bureau to find out whether any 
complaints have been filed against the ISO, and the extent and nature of the 
complaints if any have been filed. Carefully read any contract or agreement 
you’re asked to sign. If you have any questions, it may be worth your time and 
money to have a lawyer review it for you.

131
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
Obtaining credit reports
If a customer asks you to provide a line of credit, it’s always wise to first 
check out the customer’s creditworthiness — that is, the customer’s ability 
to pay back your loan. You can purchase credit reports on businesses from 
firms like Dun & Bradstreet Business (www.dnbcreditreport.com) and 
Credit.Net (www.credit.net). For credit checks on consumers, the major 
credit reporting agencies — Equifax (www.equifax.com), Experian (www.
experian.com), and TransUnion (www.transunion.com) — provide this 
service to businesses. Visit these companies’ Web sites or give them a call for 
more information.
Using the PayPal option
As a direct result of the explosion of the eBay online auction service, PayPal 
(www.paypal.com) and a number of similar financial services companies 
have sprung up to facilitate the resultant transactions. In addition to offering 
the ability to accept cash transfers from customers with their own PayPal 
accounts, PayPal allows your customers to pay you by using their credit 
cards. You can then either keep the funds in your PayPal account or electron­
ically transfer them to your business’s bank account.
Using PayPal to accept your customers’ credit cards offers some compelling 
advantages over the more traditional process of qualifying for and establish­
ing a merchant account, including the following:
	
✓	You don’t have to fill out a lengthy application or jump a bunch of hur­
dles to be able to accept credit cards for your business. Simply establish 
a PayPal account (which takes at most a few minutes), and you’re ready 
to go.
	
✓	Although not free, the fees that you pay to accept credit cards with 
PayPal may be significantly less than what you’d pay a bank for running 
charges through a merchant account (currently from 1.9 to 2.9 percent, 
depending on monthly sales volume, plus $0.30).
	
	You also avoid paying separately for a gateway service. If you’re pro­
cessing a lot of credit card payments, these savings can really add up.
	
✓	Unlike merchant accounts, PayPal charges no monthly fees for leasing 
credit card software or generating transaction records.
	
Our advice? Give the PayPal option consideration when you’re starting out. 
It’s far easier than establishing a merchant account, and the cash is just as 
green when it hits your bank account.

Part II: Managing Your Money 
Choosing the Best Bookkeeping 
System for Your Business
Keeping track of your business’s financial transactions is a must — there are 
simply too many good reasons why you can’t ignore it. Your business’s finances 
aren’t going to get less complicated as your business grows; in fact, the oppo­
site is likely to be true. Start your business off on the right foot, and make 
accounting for your financial transactions a regular part of doing business.
	
Although you may enjoy playing with Microsoft Excel, we suggest that you 
pick up one of the many excellent accounting software programs available on 
the market today instead of creating your own spreadsheets from scratch. 
Programs such as Quicken, QuickBooks, and Peachtree Accounting can take 
care of your business’s every financial need — now and into the future.
For example, QuickBooks, Simple Start Free Edition — a capable and easy-
to-use software program for businesses with up to 20 customers that you 
can download for free — allows you to do the following basic tasks (more 
advanced tasks, such as producing estimates, require an upgrade to a more 
capable paid version of QuickBooks):
	
✓	Print checks, pay bills, and track expenses
	
✓	Invoice customers and track payments and sales taxes
	
✓	Generate reports, including profit-and-loss statements, statements of 
cash flows, balance sheets, sales reports, and more
	
✓	Manage payroll and payroll taxes
	
✓	Track information for taxes and share information with an accountant
	
✓	Follow along with extensive tutorials and help functions
The accounting method you decide to use ultimately depends on the nature of 
your business and on the amount and complexity of the financial transactions 
you incur. If you’re at all in doubt as to how to proceed with your bookkeeping 
or accounting system, talk to an accountant for help in setting up the right way.
You’ll have a great feeling when you get your business off the ground and 
receive your first payments for your products or services. After all your hard 
work and planning, these payments are what you’ve been waiting for. Chances 
are you’ll be busier than you ever imagined and may easily get so caught up in 
taking care of customers that you forget to take care of your business.
	
However, successful businesses don’t just happen — they require constant 
attention. Like a wonderfully productive vegetable garden, businesses need to 
be carefully tended and watched for signs of trouble. In business, one of the 

133
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
best ways to keep an eye on the health of your business is to review the wide 
variety of financial reports available to you. Make a regular habit of generating 
the reports you need and reviewing them. Don’t just assume that everything is 
fine — prove it to yourself regularly.
Balancing check registers 
and bank statements
You can do the most basic form of financial analysis once a month when you 
balance your check registers against your bank statements. Most bank state­
ments summarize the total dollar amount of the deposits you made during 
the month, as well as the total dollar amount of the money you disbursed 
from your account. After you’ve double-checked to make sure the bank 
statements are in agreement with your check register, subtract the amount 
of your checks from your deposits to give yourself a quick-and-dirty idea of 
what direction your business is heading financially — north or south.
Spending far more than you’re taking in? Then you know you have to find 
ways to bring in more money while also controlling expenses. Bringing in far 
more money than you’re spending? Terrific! Figure out how to do more of 
what you’re already doing.
Analyzing the two most important 
financial statements
Financial statements take the data you’ve entered into your accounting 
system and organize it in a way that allows you to quickly gauge the financial 
health of your company. Although financial statements may seem a bit intimi­
dating to many — especially for new home-based businesspeople — account­
ing and bookkeeping software make the process easier than ever before. It’s 
really as simple as one or two clicks of your computer’s mouse.
Two of the most popular and useful financial statements are the income 
statement and the balance sheet. Each has its own unique role to play in your 
financial analysis and, ultimately, in the way you run your business.
The income statement
The income statement (also known as a profit-and-loss statement, or P&L) mea­
sures the profitability of your business — in other words, how much money 
is left over after you add up all your business revenues and subtract all your 
business expenses.

134
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Income statements reveal three key pieces of information:
	
✓	A business’s sales volume during a specified period
	
✓	A business’s expenses during a specified period
	
✓	The difference between a business’s sales and its expenses — its profit 
(or loss) — during a specified period
Table 6-1 shows what a typical income statement looks like.

In the example in Table 6-1, Susan’s Antiques had $49,000 of net sales rev­
enue and a cost of goods sold of $10,000, leaving the company with a gross 
profit of $39,000. However, this gross profit was further reduced by the 
expenses of selling products and running the company (advertising, printing, 
rent, salaries, bonuses, and so forth) and by income taxes. The result is a net 
income of $9,000.
The balance sheet
The entire world of accounting hinges on a simple mathematical truth, known 
as the accounting equation:
Assets = liabilities + owners’ equity
Assets include cash and things that can be converted to cash. Liabilities are 
obligations — debts, loans, mortgages, and the like — owed to other organi­
zations or people. Owners’ equity is the net worth of the organization after all 
liabilities have been subtracted from the organization’s assets.
The balance sheet reveals these three categories. Table 6-2 shows a sample of 
a typical balance sheet.

The value of the assets of Susan’s Antiques is exactly balanced by its liabili­
ties and owners’ equity. Because of the accounting equation, there’s no other 
option. The balance sheet demonstrates the fact that assets are paid for by 
a company’s liabilities and owners’ equity. Conversely, the assets are used 
to generate cash to pay off the company’s liabilities. Any excess cash after 
liabilities are paid off is added to owners’ equity as profit.
Happiness Is a Positive Cash Flow
For a new business — especially a new, home-based business that you 
depend on to generate income in both your work and your personal lives — 
generating a positive cash flow as quickly as possible after startup of the 
business is absolutely critical. Every new business goes through an initial 

137
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
period during which expenses exceed revenues (thus generating a negative 
cash flow), but the sooner you can make your cash flow positive, the better 
for the short- and long-term financial health of the business (and the easier 
you’ll sleep at night).
Happiness in business truly is a positive cash flow. The following sections 
help you put your company into the black and out of the red.
Should you lease or buy?
Q: I’m thinking about acquiring a new van for my 
business and upgrading my computer system. 
Should I lease or buy?
A: The choice to rent, lease, or buy has many 
important business considerations. For exam­
ple, leasing may enable you to get a better van 
or computer than you could otherwise afford. 
Because leasing is normally equivalent to 
100-percent financing, it may allow you to keep 
more working capital on hand. Leasing may 
also allow you to pay for the items out of your 
earnings instead of having to use your savings 
or get a home equity loan.
But, of course, you need to qualify for a lease, 
which means you must have good credit, 
although you probably don’t need as flawless of 
credit for leasing office equipment and furniture 
as you do for leasing a van. As a general rule, if 
you’re leasing under your business name, you 
can expect to be required to have been in busi­
ness for at least a year. But computer compa­
nies like Dell and Gateway all have consumer 
leasing programs based on credit history.
Leasing has a cash advantage over a purchase 
on credit because a lease usually requires 
little or no down payment, whereas a credit 
purchase may require 20 to 30 percent down. 
However, a disadvantage of leasing is that it’s 
more expensive than buying because it includes 
charges to cover overhead and profit. If dealers 
are offering zero-interest financing, leasing is 
decidedly more expensive.
Technological obsolescence is another reason 
often cited for leasing, though some leases 
include annual automatic upgrades. At the end 
of a lease period, you can give back the equip­
ment that may now be considered obsolete and 
have little market value. You may also get addi­
tional tax benefits from leasing, but because tax 
laws are continually changing and have many 
exceptions to exceptions, consult with your tax 
specialist before deciding about leasing.
Taking all this info into account, you can see 
we can’t give you a stock answer as to whether 
renting, leasing, or buying is best. If you do 
decide to lease, consider the following:
	✓	The exact nature of the financing agree­
ment (Does it have liens or restrictions?)
	✓	The amount of each payment (Are there 
any add-on and document-processing fees 
or termination penalties?)
	✓	The person responsible for insurance, 
maintenance, and taxes (usually, the 
lessee)
	✓	What happens to the leased item at the end 
of the lease
	✓	Renewal options
	✓	Cancellation penalties, if any
	✓	Disadvantageous terms and conditions
	✓	Length of the lease period
(continued)

Part II: Managing Your Money 
Treating cash as king
Most home-based businesspeople who have chosen the sole-proprietorship 
form of business (see Chapter 10 for more on the most common forms of busi­
ness) use their money to pay not only business expenses, but also personal 
expenses, when they’re the primary wage earners. In other words, the money 
from your self-proprietorship business enables you to fulfill both your business 
and your personal obligations, such as office rent and car payments.
As a business, you have many different forms of money available to you, 
including cash, checks, money orders, and credit cards — and some are 
better than others. For most businesses, being paid in cash — either before 
delivering a product or service or upon delivery, at the latest — is by far the 
top preference, followed by checks. Here are the different ways you can be 
paid, in order from the most to the least preferred:
	
✓	Cash: Assuming it’s not counterfeit, being paid in cash is ideal. It’s 
100-percent liquid, you can spend it immediately if you like, and you can 
be sure it’s not going to bounce or have a one-week hold placed on it 
when you deposit it to your business bank account. (If your bank puts a 
hold on cash deposits, find a new bank — fast!)
	
✓	Checks: In many cases — particularly for large payments of many thou­
sands of dollars — being paid in cash just isn’t practical, so using checks 
makes the most sense. However, checks aren’t as liquid as cash; you 
have to take them to the originating bank or deposit them in your bank 
account (where they may be held until they clear) to be able to obtain 
(continued)
Generally, it’s cheaper if you arrange your own 
vehicle financing instead of going through a 
dealer, which marks up the loan rate. You can 
determine the cost of a loan in advance by using 
sites like Bankrate.com (www.bankrate.
com), E-Loan (www.eloan.com), CapitolOne 
Auto Finance (www.capitalone.com), or 
LowerMyBills.com (www.lowermybills.
com). To calculate leasing costs, you can get a 
lease quote at www.leasesource.com, as 
well as purchase their pricing services.
Whether you buy or lease, but particularly if you 
lease, consider getting gap insurance included 
in your lease. This insurance protects you if 
you find yourself in a situation in which a week 
or two after you get your vehicle, it’s stolen or 
totaled, and the insurance company plans to 
pay you only $18,000 on a $26,000 vehicle. Gap 
insurance covers the difference.
Something to consider about leasing computers 
is that you may be restrained to add memory 
or make other changes because you have to 
restore each computer to its original condition 
at the end of the lease period.

139
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
cash. Doing so takes time. Not only that, but checks also introduce the 
possibility that the customer’s account may not have sufficient funds 
available to pay the obligation or that the checks are bogus. Insufficient 
funds are a very real concern, and you have to be sure your customer 
has the capacity to pay you before you accept a check.
	
✓	Credit cards: Credit cards are another step down the ladder of prefer­
ence for receiving money. Credit card companies take a piece of every 
transaction you give them to process. But if a card turns out to be stolen 
or bogus, or if your customer decides to dispute the charge because 
he’s unhappy with the product or service you delivered, you may be out 
the amount of the entire transaction.
	
✓	Online payments: These payments include those paid through services 
such as PayPal, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Simple Pay for customers 
who don’t have credit cards or who may be credit-adverse (who account 
for about 10 percent of online sales). Online payments are riskier than 
the preceding payment alternatives because of the risk of inputting your 
information into a Web site that’s bogus or has been specifically set up 
by hackers to gather your sensitive financial information, username, 
and/or password.
	
✓	Credit: When you sell someone a product or service and let him pay 
for it later, you’re extending credit to your customer. Although this 
practice is quite common in business, it’s by far the least preferred 
way to be paid. It may be weeks or even months before you finally 
get your money — perhaps well after you’ve sold and delivered your 
products or services — and you run the risk of never being paid at all. 
If you do decide to bill your clients for your products and services, be 
sure to check out their credit histories first. If in doubt, require your 
clients to pay you in cash, by check, or with a credit card.
	
Creating a positive cash flow starts with bringing cash into your business. The 
longer you take to convert whatever form of payment you decide to accept 
into cash, the longer you have to wait before your cash flow is positive. And 
don’t forget: Happiness is a positive cash flow.
Kick-starting your cash flow
Do you always seem to be a day late and a dollar short? Even though you’re 
bringing in good money, is it already spent as soon as it arrives? If you 
answer yes to these questions, you likely have a problem with cash flow. 
Assuming you’re charging enough for your products and services, either 
you’re not collecting your money quickly enough or you’re spending too 
much money too quickly.

140
Part II: Managing Your Money 
But don’t fret; here are some ways to put your cash flow on the right track:
	
✓	Get your money upfront. If at all possible, ask for payment before you 
deliver your products or services. There’s no better way to get your cash 
flowing in the right direction than being paid sooner rather than later.
	
✓	Don’t pay your bills any sooner than you have to. Your cash flow will 
thank you if you wait to pay your bills until you’re required to do so. If, 
for example, your utility bill requires payment 30 days after you receive 
it and you pay your bills with an online banking account, schedule your 
payment to be delivered the day before it’s due (don’t schedule payment 
on the exact due date — if the payment fails, you won’t have enough 
time to fix the problem before your payment is late). If you’re paying by 
check, wait until day 25 before you write out your check and drop it into 
the mail. Waiting to pay your bills doesn’t mean holding your payments 
longer than the date when payment is due. Late payments may, at best, 
create ill will between you and your vendor or supplier and, at worst, 
damage your credit.
	
✓	Make sure your invoices are timely — and accurate! Send invoices as 
soon as you deliver a product or service — preferably with the delivery 
itself. And make sure they’re accurate. Many payments are delayed or 
rejected because of honest but preventable mistakes in invoicing.
	
✓	Bill more often. The more often you bill your clients or customers, the 
more often you’ll be paid. And the more often you’re paid, the better 
your cash flow is. Instead of billing your clients quarterly, why not bill 
them monthly? If you’re supplying products, try breaking your deliveries 
into smaller chunks that you can bill sooner and more often.
	
✓	Give prompt-payment discounts. Everyone loves price discounts, and 
if you offer discounts to clients who pay their bills quickly, you’re sure 
to have many takers. You may get a little less money as a result, but this 
drawback is offset by the fact that you get your money sooner rather 
than later.
	
✓	Manage your expenses. The flip side of bringing cash into your com­
pany is sending it out. The less cash you spend, the better your cash 
flow is. Spend money on your company only when necessary. Instead of 
buying the latest and greatest computer every year, for example, try to 
make the one you have last as long as you can — replacing it only when 
necessary.
	
✓	Manage your accounts receivable. In other words, make sure to keep 
track of what’s owed you and take action to collect late payments. 
Customers and clients have plenty of reasons why they haven’t paid the 
money that’s due to you, however, you’ll never find out why if you aren’t 
keeping track of your clients’ payments. Accounting software programs 
such as QuickBooks can easily generate a receivables aging report, which 
tells you the status on all your payments. If payments are even a day 
late, take immediate action to get paid.

141
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
Understanding collections
There comes a time in the life of every home-based business owner when a 
client either forgets to pay you for the products or services you sell her or 
outright refuses to do so. It’s one thing if the products and services you sold 
your client were never delivered, were supplied late, or were poor in quality. 
Most customers have a problem paying you in those kinds of situations, and 
they may express their displeasure by holding on to the cash they owe you. 
It’s another thing altogether, however, if you did what you agreed to do when 
your client placed her order.
But why wouldn’t your clients pay you the money they owe you? Or why 
would they drag the process out so long that it becomes almost more trouble 
getting your money than it’s worth? Here are just a few of the possibilities:
	
✓	The check may be in the mail — really.
	
✓	Your client may have forgotten to pay you.
	
✓	A mistake in your invoice may prevent your client from paying you.
	
✓	Your client may not be satisfied with the product or service you provided.
	
✓	Your client may be trying to improve his own cash flow or make a last-
ditch effort to save his business before declaring bankruptcy or going 
out of business.
Each of these issues can be addressed, but you have to find out which reason 
pertains to your situation before you can address it. Collecting money owed 
you isn’t the best part of having your own business, but it is necessary.
Follow this six-step plan and you should get even the balkiest client or cus­
tomer to pay up:
	
1.	Personally call your client.
	
	 Before you do anything else, get on the phone with your client to find 
out what the problem is. If it’s minor, you can take care of it right then 
and there, over the phone. In the vast majority of cases, this initial 
phone call is all it takes to nudge your clients into paying you. If, how­
ever, calling your client doesn’t get payment to you right away, you need 
to take further action.
	
2.	Send a past-due notice immediately.
	
	 Don’t wait after a payment is due to send out a past-due notice. If pay­
ment is due 15 days after you invoice, and you don’t receive it, send 
out a past-due statement on day 16. If payment is due 30 days after you 
invoice, send out a past-due statement on day 31. Don’t be shy — it’s 

142
Part II: Managing Your Money 
your money, so go after it. In addition to sticking the past-due state­
ment in the mail, try faxing and e-mailing copies. You can use soft­
ware to remind you when it’s time to act on a payment. For example, 
QuickBooks has a reminder feature.
	
3.	Stop work.
	
	 If your client or customer drags things out longer than is acceptable to 
you, you may have to stop work to get her attention. If you sell products, 
stopping work means suspending deliveries of any further orders until 
your client pays her bill. If you deliver services, stopping work means 
putting any current projects on hold until payment is made. Stopping 
work shows your client or customer that you’re serious about getting 
paid, and it’s sure to solicit some sort of response. Before you undertake 
this step, however, be sure to give your client fair warning that you plan 
to take this action if you don’t receive payment by a particular date.
	
4.	Enlist the services of a collections agency.
	
	 If you’ve gone through all the previous steps and still haven’t been paid, 
it’s probably time to assign the tardy account to a collections agency. 
A collections agency specializes in motivating customers to pay their 
financial obligations. Subject to federal, state, and local regulation, col­
lections agencies use a variety of tactics to get your clients’ attention — 
including phone calls, letters, and even lawsuits — and to get them to 
pay. You pay a price for this service, however. Expect to pay anywhere 
from 10 to 50 percent of any monies collected by the agency. Although 
an agency takes a healthy cut, the probability of getting some payment 
likely increases with an agency in your corner.
	
5.	Mediate.
	
	 Taking a client or customer to court isn’t our idea of fun. Before you’re 
forced to take that last, most drastic step, you have one more way to get 
out of your impasse: mediation. A mediator is an impartial third party 
whose job is to help you and your customer work through your prob­
lems and reach a reasonable solution — one that is a win for both par­
ties. If your client has simply decided not to pay you, mediation may not 
be fruitful. However, if your client is upset because of some perceived 
shortcoming in your performance, you may have a chance of resolution 
through mediation. You can find mediators by doing a simple Internet 
search or in the Yellow Pages, listed under Mediation Services.
	
6.	Take them to court!
	
	 Taking your clients to court is always the last resort. Not only does 
taking a client to court take up a lot of your precious time (and, if you 
need a lawyer, your money), but suing a client also puts the last nail in 
the coffin that was your business relationship. If, however, despite all 
your efforts, you still haven’t been paid, and you decide that it’s in your 
interest to do everything in your power to get the money that is owed 
you, by all means, take your client to court.

143
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
	
	 In many cases — for relatively small amounts of money owed — taking 
your client to court means going to small-claims court, which, by design, 
offers a simple and inexpensive way for you to have your case heard 
by a judge. The amount of money that qualifies as a small-claims action 
differs from state to state, and from country to country. In Alaska and 
Texas, for example, a small-claims action can’t exceed $10,000, whereas 
$1,500 is the limit in Kentucky. And although you can sue a client for up 
to $25,000 in small-claims court in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, 
British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan, you’ll find a limit of 
$5,000 in Newfoundland and Labrador.
The extent to which you pursue your money is up to you. In some cases, you 
may decide that it’s easier to write off the money (and the business relation­
ship) than to pursue it to its ultimate conclusion. In other cases, you may 
decide to do whatever is necessary to get paid.
Getting a Loan
Studies show that one of the primary reasons so many businesses fail in their 
first year of existence is because they’re undercapitalized — in other words, 
they don’t have sufficient cash to meet their ongoing obligations over the 
long haul. Depending on what kind of business you have, putting enough 
money aside to allow you to make it through your first year can be a daunting 
proposition. But it shouldn’t stop you from starting a successful home-based 
business — because you can always apply for a loan.
For many home-based businesspeople, the first choice in lenders is a time-
honored one: F&F (friends and family). If friends and family aren’t able to 
meet your business needs, though, you need to look elsewhere for the cash 
you need to sustain your business as you get established and build sales.
In the following sections, we explain some of the most commonly used 
sources of loans for home-based businesses.
Discovering different kinds of credit
Banks, credit unions, savings and loans, and other financial institutions are 
always coming up with new-and-improved loan products. Keep in mind, 
though, that you may have trouble obtaining a loan in the name of your busi­
ness until it has established a track record of success over some extended 
period of time. If that’s the case for you, check out the different kinds of 
credit we describe in this section to find one that may work for you.

144
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Some of the most common forms of credit for home-based businesses, along 
with their pluses and minuses, include the following:
	
✓	Credit card: Many home-based businesses are financed — especially 
when they’re first starting up — with credit cards. In fact, a recent 
survey showed that almost three in five of all small business owners 
use credit cards to at least partly finance their business operations. 
Not only are credit cards easy for most people to get, but they’re also 
convenient and easy to manage. All this convenience comes at a price, 
however. Credit card interest rates can be obscenely high — now rou­
tinely 30 percent— and they’re so easy to use that you can quickly find 
yourself bumping up against your credit limit. Although you’ll likely be 
able to write this interest expense off when you do your taxes, you can 
quickly find yourself in over your head if you aren’t careful. A study for 
the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation found that for every $1,000 in 
unpaid credit card debt, the risk a startup business will not make it goes 
up by 2.2 percent. Used judiciously, credit cards can be a terrific busi­
ness tool — and may be all the credit you ever need.
	
✓	Personal loan: Individuals can get personal loans from banks, credit 
unions, finance companies, and similar sources based on their own 
personal income and creditworthiness. Assuming you have sufficient 
income and a good credit rating, you have a good chance of qualifying 
for the loan you need. After you have your loan, you’re free to spend the 
money as you please, making personal loans quite flexible. If you decide 
to apply for a personal loan, be sure to do so while you’re working at 
your regular job — before you leave to start your own business. Your 
income is likely to be higher, at least initially, improving the chances of 
approval as well as increasing the amount of money your bank will be 
willing to loan to you.
	
✓	Business loan: Banks and other financial institutions make business 
loans to finance business startups, cover ongoing operational needs, or 
finance business expansions. New businesses are inherently risky — 
they often have little or no equity (value) built up, usually lack a suf­
ficiently long track record of success, and have a statistically high rate 
of failure within the first few years after founding. So business loans can 
be difficult for home-based businesses to obtain. Although rates can be 
reasonable — usually only a few points over the prime rate established 
by the Federal Reserve — the hoops you have to jump through, as well 
as the ongoing reporting and bank reviews, may be enough to send you 
looking elsewhere for funding. You may even have to pledge your per­
sonal assets as collateral in the event of a loan default. To get a business 
loan, at a minimum, you need a business plan, and you need to establish 
a good working relationship with your banker. If you and your business 
have what it takes, however, business loans can be your best solution. If 

145
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
you’re interested in business loans, check out peer-to-peer lending (P2P) 
facilitated by companies like Lending Club (www.lendingclub.com) 
and Prosper (www.prosper.com). The rates are typically lower than a 
bank loan or credit card.
	
✓	Line of credit: A line of credit is a business loan with a unique twist: 
Instead of a lump sum for the full amount of the loan, you’re given 
approval to borrow funds up to a certain limit in whatever amounts or 
as often as you like. The advantage of a line of credit is that you don’t 
have to use any of the money available to you until you need it, which 
means you don’t have to make loan payments until you actually tap your 
credit line. With a regular loan, you get a check in the full amount of 
the loan, and you start making monthly loan payments soon thereafter. 
On the down side, a line of credit often has a higher interest rate than a 
standard loan, and its use may be more restricted.
	
✓	Home equity loan: A home equity loan is similar to a personal loan, 
with one major difference: You’re required to pledge your home or 
other real property as collateral in the event that you default on your 
loan obligations. Because your equity bears the burden of risk — a fact 
that can weigh heavily on your mind if your business gets into financial 
trouble — home equity loans for substantial amounts of money can be 
obtained relatively easily. Loan terms can run 15 years or more. You 
likely have a choice of a lump sum or setting up a line of credit that 
you can draw on — and pay back — as necessary.
	
✓	Microloan: A growing number of states, counties, and cities are estab­
lishing microloan programs (usually defined as loans of $25,000 or 
less) to assist the startup and expansion of small businesses. The Utah 
Microenterprise Loan Fund (www.umlf.com), for example, has made 
loans from $1,000 to $25,000 to more than 560 small businesses over 
the past 15 years. For an up-to-date listing of organizations that provide 
microloans, check out the Association for Enterprise Opportunity Web 
site at www.microenterpriseworks.org.
	
✓	SBA loan: SBA loans are business loans that are backed by the U.S. Small 
Business Administration. Because the lending bank has less of a risk in 
the event of default, home-based business owners can obtain them more 
easily than a standard business loan. Interested? Talk to your friendly 
local banker or visit the SBA Web site at www.sba.gov.
So what kind of loan should you get? The answer depends on your particu­
lar situation, financial goals, the amount of money you plan to borrow, and 
your own personal credit history. Take some time to discuss your different 
options with your loan officer, financial advisor, or CPA. Remember, how­
ever, that you should always minimize how much you borrow and be diligent 
about paying back your loans as soon as you can.

Part II: Managing Your Money 
Getting the loan you want
The best way to get the loan you want is to first understand what factors go 
into a decision to extend or deny credit to an applicant. The standard rule 
that most banks, credit unions, savings and loans, and other financial institu­
tions use is called the Five Cs:
	
✓	Capacity: Will your business have the financial wherewithal to make 
loan payments — in full and on time — as required by your agreement 
with the lending agency? Will your cash flow support this additional 
burden of debt on your business? If you answer no to these questions, 
you need to figure out how to improve revenues while tightening up on 
expenses. Do so before you apply for your loan, not after.
	
✓	Capital: Capital represents the ratio of your company’s debt to its assets 
or equity. Unfortunately, most business startups — including home-
based businesses — have relatively high debt loads versus equity or 
assets. This is normal. You can, however, improve your chances of get­
ting the loan you want by minimizing the debt you carry and maximizing 
equity and your own investment in the business.
	
✓	Character: Are you personally a good credit risk? Do you have a history of 
meeting your own financial obligations, including repaying loans on time 
and avoiding defaults or bankruptcies? A shaky credit history is an indica­
tion to a lender that your character is less than sterling. If you have shaky 
credit, be sure to do whatever you can to repair your own credit before 
you apply for a loan. Obtain a credit report from one of the major credit 
reporting agencies — Equifax (www.equifax.com), Experian (www.
experian.com), or TransUnion (www.transunion.com) — and take 
action on any problems that may show up.
	
✓	Collateral: What kind of property can you pledge in case you default on 
your loan? Car loans require your car to be pledged as collateral. Home 
mortgages require that your house be pledged as collateral. What are 
your options for collateral? In many cases, lenders may require that you 
pledge your assets or property to secure your loan. Your ability to pro­
vide sufficient collateral will greatly enhance your chances of getting the 
loan you want.
	
✓	Conditions: Conditions include the health and growth potential of the 
markets within which you operate, the demographics of the typical 
buyers of your products and services, and many other economic factors 
external to your business. Although you can do little to influence or con­
trol the behavior of your markets or your customers, you can influence 
exactly which markets and customers you plan to target.

147
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Your Money
As you prepare to apply for a loan, review each of the Five Cs, and make an 
honest assessment of how you measure up. Which areas can you improve in? 
Find them and try to improve them now — before you apply for your loan. 
There’s no reason why — if you do your homework — you can’t get the loan 
you want for your business.
Fixing your bad credit history
Although everyone would love to have a great credit history, not everyone 
does. And, unfortunately, a bad credit history can prevent you from get­
ting the loan you want and the money you need. The good news is that you 
can turn a bad credit history into a good credit history. It takes time and 
patience, but the rewards can be well worth the time and effort.
In her book Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope with Your Debts (Nolo), 
Robin Leonard presents an eight-point plan for repairing your credit and 
improving your chances of getting a loan. Here’s that plan in a nutshell:
	
1.	Secure a stable source of income.
	
2.	Create a budget you can and will live within.
	
3.	Open a passbook savings account (and add money to your account on 
a regular basis).
	
4.	Apply for a savings passbook loan.
	
5.	Pay back this loan over a six- to nine-month period.
	
6.	Obtain a secured credit card.
	
7.	Use this credit card sparingly (and pay off balances quickly to avoid 
potentially high interest charges).
	
8.	Apply selectively for other cards (including gasoline companies, 
department stores, and other nonfinancial institutions).
If your credit is seriously damaged, and this plan isn’t enough to solve the 
problem, consider working with a credit counselor or credit repair agency.

The Price Is Right: Deciding 
How Much to Charge
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding what your prices have to cover
▶	Evaluating your potential customers and figuring out how much they’ll pay
▶	Researching your competition to get a better idea of what you should charge
▶	Applying pricing strategies that lead to sales
P
ricing plays an extremely important role in the ultimate success of 
your business. Do it right, and your business will flourish; do it wrong, 
and your business will likely die a slow, miserable death. Because your busi­
ness will live or die as a result of the pricing decisions you make, this topic 
deserves your undivided attention.
Here’s how pricing works, in a nutshell: If you set your prices too high, your 
clients will seek less expensive sources for the products and services you 
provide, and you’ll soon find yourself going out of business from lack of sales. 
Set them too low, however, and although you’ll be swamped with custom­
ers — everyone loves a bargain, after all — your profit margins will be too 
small to sustain your business as it grows. The key is finding a compromise 
between these two extremes that pays you what you’re worth while generat­
ing sufficient business to keep you working as many hours as you want.
You can set prices for your products and services in a variety of ways. 
In many cases, though, finding the right price comes down to good old-
fashioned trial and error. In other words, do some research, check the 
competition, set a price, and see what happens. If sales aren’t high enough, 
you can decide whether to lower your prices as an incentive for potential 
buyers to part with their cash. If sales are too high and the resulting profits 
are too low, you can choose to raise your prices to improve your margins 
(see the “Changing your prices” section later in this chapter).

150
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Remember that the best pricing strategies are ones that strike a balance 
between generating the sales you need to survive and earning a reasonable 
profit that will allow your business to grow in the future. This chapter helps 
you understand how to develop the pricing strategy that’s best for you, your 
business, and your customers and clients. We help you sort out the costs 
that you have to cover when you set your prices and help you get a feel for 
what your customers will be willing to pay. We also give you ideas for how to 
research your competition and review a number of different approaches to 
pricing that will aid your sales efforts. Finally, we consider the reasons why 
you should (or shouldn’t) consider discounting your prices and how to take a 
stand when doing so is in your business’s best interest.
Figuring Out What Your 
Prices Must Cover
Although the motivation behind your business may be to help others get 
things done or to provide them with the products they need to run their 
own businesses successfully, you can’t have a business — at least not for 
very long — if you don’t charge your customers some amount of money for 
your trouble. But you can’t just charge them any old price; your price has 
to be low enough to attract the attention of prospective customers but high 
enough to allow you to generate a profit.
Since the beginning of business as you know it, the whole idea of pricing 
products and services has been to pay for all the expenses incurred in run­
ning a business while leaving a reasonable profit. Unfortunately, many home-
based businesspeople don’t fully understand the expenses they actually 
incur in running their businesses. Not only that, but they also sometimes 
forget that their home-based businesses should pay a decent salary and gen­
erate a reasonable profit — just like non-home-based businesses.
Imagine that the finances of your home-based business are a house. Just 
like any other sturdily built house anywhere in the world, it needs a roof, a 
foundation, walls, doors, and windows. Your finance house, also called your 
money house, also has a first floor and a second floor. Figure 7-1 shows this 
money house.
The following list describes the major components of this money house and 
how they relate to the finances of your home-based business:
	
✓	The foundation — your salary: Whenever your company sells a product 
or service, a portion of the cash you take in is set aside to pay you and 
any employees who have a regular salary.

151
 Chapter 7: The Price Is Right: Deciding How Much to Charge
	
✓	The first floor — your overhead: The cash you take in also pays for 
your overhead, including all the expenses your business requires to 
operate, regardless of whether or not you’re selling any products. 
Insurance, rent, and telephones are examples of overhead expenses.
	
✓	The second floor — your direct costs: Direct costs are expenses that you 
incur on behalf of specific projects or products. If you drive to another 
town for a meeting or purchase wood to build a cabinet for a customer, 
for example, you’re incurring direct expenses.
	
✓	The roof — your profit: Profit is what you’re in business to try to make; it’s 
what’s left over when you’ve brought in all your cash for selling a product 
or service and subtracted out your salary, overhead, and direct expenses. 
Profit is your reward for taking a risk (yes, starting your own business does 
involve taking a risk, even if you’ve signed up for a “proven” system), and it 
plays an important role in building your business.

Part II: Managing Your Money 
	
Just like a large business like General Motors, IBM, or Pfizer, your home-based 
business can make a profit or incur a loss. Home-based businesses are real 
businesses, and the profit you make in your business is just as real as it is for 
any other business. People view profit in many different ways. Some people 
identify the revenue beyond what they expect to pay themselves as a higher 
salary. For others, it’s having the money to spend on extra things, such as 
investing in one’s business without borrowing (usually a better idea than 
taking out loans to grow your business) or taking a long-deserved trip to a ski 
resort or the beach. But for most people, profit is additional earnings.
In the following sections, we take a closer look at the kinds of financial ele­
ments that make up each part of your money house, and we explain how they 
all work together to determine the prices you charge for your company’s 
products and services.
Paying salaries
When you set up your business as a sole proprietorship, you likely won’t pay 
yourself a salary because, under a sole proprietorship, the money you make 
in your business is automatically counted as income to you for tax purposes. 
When you set up your business as a partnership or corporation, however, 
you may find that paying yourself a salary makes a lot of sense.
But how much should you pay yourself? When deciding how much salary 
to draw from your business, you first have to decide which of the following 
three lifestyles you want your business to support:
	
✓	Survival: In this mode, your business is just getting by, and you have 
little or no extra money to set aside to pay yourself. Ideally, you still 
work your regular day job or have a spouse or significant other to help 
support you while you’re working to build your sales.
	
✓	Comfortable: Comfortable means things are going pretty well — well 
enough to allow you to quit your regular job and work at your home-
based business on a full-time basis. You can choose to continue with 
the status quo — and be quite comfortable where you are — or work to 
increase your sales and see your business really take off.
	
✓	Much better than average: At this salary point, you’re making more 
money than most people in your community or even in the nation. 
Attaining this level of income requires a lot of hard work and perhaps no 
small amount of luck. But for many, the rewards are worth the extra effort.

153
 Chapter 7: The Price Is Right: Deciding How Much to Charge
Establishing your overhead
Overhead consists of all your home-based business’s nondirect costs and 
nonsalary expenses. In essence, your overhead expenses are the costs of 
doing business — the expenses that your business incurs even when you 
aren’t creating products or delivering services to customers. Here are some 
examples of common overhead expenses:
	
✓	Computers, copiers, printers, telephones, and other office equipment
	
✓	Desks, chairs, and other office furniture
	
✓	Internet and e-mail connections
	
✓	Web site hosting fees
	
✓	Other marketing costs
	
✓	Letterhead stationery and business cards
	
✓	Office supplies
	
✓	Travel for business operations, marketing, or other nonproject purposes
	
✓	Phone line(s)
	
✓	Water, electricity, and other utilities
	
✓	Newspaper, journal, and magazine subscriptions
	
✓	Insurance
	
✓	Licenses
	
✓	Rent or mortgage
	
✓	Repairs and maintenance
	
Because overhead doesn’t directly produce revenue (or, ultimately, profit), 
smart business owners work hard to minimize overhead expenses, keeping 
them at the lowest possible level while still providing the highest-quality ser­
vices and products. To minimize your overhead expenses, you need to care­
fully assess every expense before you execute it. Before you spend a dime on 
any overhead item, take a moment to decide whether or not you really need 
it. And don’t forget: Your overhead (and direct) expenses are generally tax 
deductible. Check out Chapter 9 for more details on the tax implications of 
your expenses.
Incurring direct costs
Direct costs are the expenses you incur as you create products or deliver 
services; if you aren’t making products or delivering services, you have no 
direct costs. Generally, the more direct costs, the merrier, because they 
directly become part of the products and services you deliver to your clients, 

154
Part II: Managing Your Money 
increasing the overall amount of money you bring into your business (and 
ideally increasing your clients’ satisfaction at the same time). Here are some 
examples of direct costs:
	
✓	Materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing process
	
✓	Travel at your client’s request
	
✓	Time spent in client meetings
	
✓	Postage and phone calls for specific projects
	
✓	Fees to consultants contracted to assist on specific projects
	
✓	Equipment dedicated to producing a specific product or delivering a 
service to a particular client
	
If you aren’t creating products or working on client projects, you don’t incur 
direct costs. (But you do still have to pay for your overhead — whether or 
not you’re producing and selling your products and services — and this over­
head can quickly add up.)
Striving for profit
Although profit may seem like a mysterious and complex concept if you’re 
new to owning your own business, it really boils down to a fairly simple idea:
The difference between a company’s revenues and its costs
To figure out your company’s profit, add together all the cash your company 
brings in from selling products and services and any income you earn from 
other sources, such as interest-bearing bank accounts and investments, and 
then subtract your salary, overhead, and direct costs from your total income. 
If the profit is negative (because the money you spend for your business is 
more than the money you bring into your business), it’s called a loss.
	
Although we suspect you may already know this little tidbit, remember that 
profits are good and losses are bad.
Profit is the roof on the money house we build earlier in this chapter. It’s the 
motivation that drives many businesses to ever-greater heights. In the case 
of a home-based business, profit is the reward to the owner for risking his or 
her capital in the marketplace. If allowed to accumulate within the business, 
the profit becomes the equity — the money put aside in savings — that gives 
the company real value.

155
 Chapter 7: The Price Is Right: Deciding How Much to Charge
Sizing Up Your Potential Customers 
and How Much They’ll Pay
Pricing your products and services is more than simply sticking price tags 
on them — pricing is an integral part of the overall strategy for your home-
based business. In fact, it may well be one of the most important components 
(one reason we devote an entire chapter to the topic). Not only is pricing 
important because it determines to some extent exactly how much cash your 
business brings in, but it’s also important from a marketing perspective and 
from the perspective of the overall health of your business and its ability to 
survive the long haul.
Set your prices too high, for example, and your sales will be few and far 
between. The result? Little or no cash into the business and an overall 
financial loss as you continue to expend money that isn’t being offset by 
income. Not only that, but you’ll also spend an awful lot of time twiddling 
your thumbs as you wait for your phone to ring. On the other hand, set your 
prices too low, and you’ll set yourself up for a going-out-of-business scenario 
as you expend far too much time and money for too little return on your 
investment.
Starting a training business
Q: I’ve been teaching various aspects of 
computer applications for several years. I’ve 
developed one-day seminars on topics like 
the Internet that I give at local colleges. The 
classes close out immediately, and many of 
my students follow me to different colleges to 
take all the different seminars I give. They also 
bring their friends. In other words, the seminars 
are well received and popular. Can I give these 
seminars at business conferences?
I also do in-house corporate training, and I hope 
to make contacts for future contracts for train­
ing. Generally, I get paid $200 for the day. Would 
I get paid more to do a business seminar? How 
would I go about getting such jobs?
A: Yes, you can speak at business conferences 
and do in-house training. I understand, how­
ever, that one of the major seminar producers 
in the United States now pays only $300 a day, 
and this job involves lots of travel. But the con­
ference and corporate pay rates are typically 
better. To make a go of it, you need to develop 
marketing materials (a Web site with video and 
Web cam messages) and individually solicit 
meeting planners. You can fortify this material 
with great testimonials, perhaps on tape.

156
Part II: Managing Your Money 
	
Before you launch headlong into your new home-based business, take a close 
look at your prospective customers — who they are and how much they’re 
willing to pay for your products and services. What if your targeted customers 
don’t seem willing to pay the price you need to turn a reasonable profit? You 
have little choice but to rethink your entire business strategy, either by creat­
ing more value for your clients-to-be to justify a higher price or by moving to 
an entirely different product or service that you can sell at the right price.
Take a moment or two to picture the kind of person who will buy your prod­
ucts or services. As you imagine your typical client or customer, ask yourself 
the following questions. To help you answer these questions, check out your 
competition to get a feel for what products and services they offer and how 
much their customers are willing to pay (see the next section for more tips).
	
✓	What’s your product or service worth to your prospective customers 
and clients? Will your customers and clients see what you’re selling as 
high value, low value, or something in between? Have you targeted the 
right market for your products and services? If not, what is the right 
market, and are there enough buyers to make it worth your while? Are 
you providing the right products and services to your target market? 
If not, what are the right products and services, and can you produce 
them cost-effectively?
	
✓	What price are your prospective customers and clients willing to pay? 
Is the price low, high, or somewhere in between?
	
✓	Are you charging enough for your products and services to establish 
and grow a healthy business? Will the price your customers and clients 
are willing to pay allow you to cover your business expenses — includ­
ing the value of your time — and leave some money for profit? Will these 
prices enable you to grow your business, or will they cause your busi­
ness to shrink — or, over a period of time, fail?
	
✓	Do you have the right mix of price versus hours worked? Are your 
prices set high enough to make a reasonable return on your investment 
of time and money, or are they so low that you have to work around 
the clock to make enough money just to keep your business afloat? 
Remember, there are still only 24 hours in a day!
	
Pricing can play an important role in your business’s success or its failure and 
deserves your focus and attention — both in initially setting prices for your 
products and services and then in monitoring them over time to ensure that 
they’re creating the return you desire. Find the right pricing, and you ease the 
way to increased sales at a high return — something that every home-based 
business owner is happy to have.

157
 Chapter 7: The Price Is Right: Deciding How Much to Charge
Researching Your Competition
So you’ve probably gathered that pricing is really important to the success of 
your business. But if you’re new to your home-based business and have little 
or no previous experience selling the products and services you now offer, 
what’s the best way to decide what prices to charge?
By far the quickest and easiest way to determine whether your prices make 
sense is to research your competition and see what they’re charging. After you 
understand what other businesses like yours charge, you have a much better 
idea of the prices you should charge. Want to attract more business than the 
competition? Just charge a little less than they do. Want to position your com­
pany as a premium brand? Charge a little more than the competition.
	
Lucky for you, the Internet has made researching your competition much 
easier than it’s ever been. Researching competition used to mean spending a 
lot of time leafing through the Yellow Pages and making phone calls. Today, 
however, with a few clicks of your mouse, you can find all kinds of free infor­
mation about what prices your competitors’ products are selling for and 
about the companies you compete against — information that you can use to 
structure your own competitive strategies and tactics.

Pricing Strategies That Deliver Sales
In an ideal world, the prices you apply to your products and services would 
enhance — not hinder — your ability to sell them. Pricing is a fine art (some 
say a mystical art), and the psychology of marketing, along with how you 
present your products and your prices, determines much of the way your 
clients-to-be react to them.
For example, when your products and services are desirable and in short 
supply, people are willing to pay far more for them than when they’re unde­
sirable and available in overwhelming amounts. This example illustrates the 
The best business media
Q: Before I start work each morning, I like to 
read the newspaper over breakfast. I find this 
routine both relaxing and motivating, as I’m able 
to scan the articles for ideas, leads, general 
inspiration, or information. Unfortunately, I have 
time to read only one paper before work beck­
ons. Which do you think offers more relevant 
information for a home-based business owner: 
a local newspaper or a national newspaper 
such as USA Today or The Wall Street Journal?
A: The answer depends on the nature of your 
business and your clientele. If your customers 
are businesses, your best bet is The Wall Street 
Journal. Even owners of small businesses most 
often read this newspaper. However, if your 
business serves only local customers, your 
local newspaper is, in almost all cases, your 
best bet. Another alternative, if you live in a 
city large enough to have one, is a local busi­
ness journal that blends both local and busi­
ness news. If your business addresses a broad 
consumer market on the Internet, through mail 
order or through wholesalers, a national paper 
like The New York Times or USA Today may 
better help you keep your finger on the pulse of 
popular consumer issues and tastes.
After choosing the one paper to read every 
morning, use the following time-saving 
techniques to help you keep up with your indus­
try’s ever-changing issues:
	✓	Read industry-specific newspapers online.
	
	 Most newspapers provide a significant por­
tion of their content online. You can periodi­
cally peruse relevant topics in newspapers 
you don’t subscribe to, which is a great 
way to keep up with an industry-specific 
town’s newspaper. If you’re in the com­
puter industry, for example, you can peruse 
the San Jose Mercury Times site periodi­
cally (www. mercurynews.com). If you 
deal with government, you can pop over to 
www.washingtonpost.com. If you’re 
in the entertainment business, try www.
latimes.com. Such Web visits can be 
a great way to take a work break!
	✓	Create your own custom newspaper using 
a site like www.crayon.net.
	✓	Subscribe to a weekly business news 
magazine, such as BusinessWeek 
(which you can also read online at www.
businessweek.com), instead of read­
ing a daily paper.

basic law of supply and demand that you probably learned about in school. 
Think for a moment about what happens when a few toys end up on the top 
of every child’s list of wants during the holiday season. As a surge of parents 
hits the stores, the toys inevitably become hard to find, and parents become 
willing to pay top dollar to get them — often, whatever it takes to ensure the 
happiness of their children. And for the toys that don’t make the top of the 
list? They’re plentiful and often on sale.
What does this idea of supply and demand mean for you? It means determin­
ing the best price points for your products and services. In the following sec­
tions, we explore different ways to develop pricing strategies that ease the 
way to sales.
Creating value for your clients
Above all, your clients and customers want to feel like they’re getting the 
best value for their money — regardless of whether the prices you charge are 
high or low. So by increasing the perceived value of your products and ser­
vices (value is a subjective judgment, after all), you can increase the prices 
you charge for them and increase your profit at the same time!
Here are some of the best ways to create and increase the perceived value of 
your organization’s products and services:
	
✓	Go above and beyond. Exceeding your customers’ routine expectations 
dramatically increases the perceived value you deliver to them. Think 
for a moment about how you feel when someone goes out of his way to 
give you the best possible service. Aren’t you willing to pay a little more 
to get more of that particular kind of service in the future? The better 
work you do, the higher your perceived value and the higher the prices 
you can charge.
	
✓	Be different. Many markets are crowded with competitors, each one 
offering products and services that seem to differ little from the competi­
tion. When you differentiate yourself from the rest of the pack — whether 
through novel packaging, a unique sales approach, or the product or ser­
vice itself — you increase your value to your clients and customers.
	
✓	Focus on customer service. The bad news is that every industry has 
more than its share of businesses that don’t provide good customer ser­
vice. The good news is that this shortfall gives you a terrific opportunity 
to provide the service that’s lacking in your industry. Take advantage of 
it, and you greatly enhance the perceived value of your organization’s 
products and services. Believe us — most people vastly prefer buying 
their products and services from companies that provide good service 
than from ones that don’t.

✓	Add value. If you and a competitor offer the same item for the same 
price, why would a customer decide to buy exclusively from you? Well, 
in truth, they wouldn’t — unless, of course, you add value to the trans­
action. Perhaps you provide better after-sales support, or maybe you’re 
willing to take returned items for 30 days after an item is sold rather 
than the 10 days your competitor allows. By adding value to the items 
you sell — value as perceived in the eyes of the buyer — you create 
value for your clients (and they’ll value you for it).
	
✓	Build long-term relationships. All business is about relationships, 
and your customers and clients value the long-term relationships they 
develop with you and other trusted vendors. By building relationships 
with your clients and customers, you become more than a place to buy 
something — you become a trusted friend and adviser, someone to turn 
to when your customers have questions or need help. Help a few times, 
and you’ll have a customer for life!
	
Always keep your customers’ perceived value of your products and services 
in mind when you develop and set your prices. Adding value in your cus­
tomers’ eyes gives you much greater flexibility in the prices you ultimately 
choose.
Setting your prices: Five approaches
Pricing is integral to the marketing process, and it can have a dramatic 
impact on whether potential customers choose to buy from you or from 
someone else. The right price can generate more sales, and the wrong price 
can send potential customers and clients looking elsewhere to fulfill their 
needs.
The following list describes five of the most common approaches that 
home-based businesses use to set their prices. As a part of determining 
your pricing strategy, carefully consider which approach (or combination of 
approaches) makes the most sense for your business.
	
✓	Startup pricing: If you’re just getting started in your business, offer your 
customers an introductory rate that’s set at a point somewhere between 
what other, established businesses charge and the amount you would 
be paid if you were doing the work on salary for an employer. Just don’t 
forget to increase your pricing to bring it in line with the rest of the 
market after you get past the startup phase and establish a track record. 
To avoid unpleasant surprises, don’t forget to let your early customers 
know that prices will rise in the future. Otherwise, they may not be very 
happy when your prices go up.

161
 Chapter 7: The Price Is Right: Deciding How Much to Charge
	
✓	The going rate: In some businesses, almost every company charges a 
going rate for particular products or services. For example, the typical 
carpet-cleaning business in your community may charge $199 to clean 
three rooms and a hallway. You can choose to set your price at the 
going rate and differentiate your business through things other than 
price, such as better customer service or extra service that your com­
petition doesn’t provide. As some business owners have discovered, 
finding something that differentiates you from the competition can be 
as simple as a brightly painted van that advertises your business every­
where you go or an easy-to-remember phone number (for example, 
1-800-CARPETS — of course, that’s already been taken, so use your 
imagination to come up with your own idea).
	
✓	Splitting the difference: When you survey your competition, you may 
find that they offer a range of prices for the same products or services: 
some high, some low, and some in between. By splitting the difference 
between the top and the bottom of the range, you can be sure that your 
price is neither too high nor too low. After seeing how your customers 
react, you can make further adjustments later (see the “Changing your 
prices” section later in this chapter for tips on how to do so).
	
✓	Bargain-basement pricing: If you really want to generate a lot of busi­
ness quickly, you can dramatically undercut your competitors’ prices. 
However, before you try this approach, understand that some potential 
clients may be wary of buying products and services that are priced 
substantially below the competition. To offset this wariness, you need 
to find some way to make them feel like they aren’t taking a risk by 
hiring you (great references from previous clients can do wonders here). 
Understand, too, that you may not be able to keep up this approach for 
long without doing serious financial damage to your company.
	
✓	Premium pricing: At the other end of the spectrum from bargain-
basement pricing is pricing at a premium, above your competition. 
This approach works well when you, first, differentiate the products or 
services you sell from those offered by your competition and, second, 
add value your clients and customers can see and appreciate. Consider 
a fancy dog-washing service that doesn’t just come to your home but 
that arrives in a brand-new, stainless-steel trailer, customized with all 
the latest tools of the trade, hot water, and big fluffy towels for your dog, 
Spot. Because you want only the very best for your pet, paying a few 
extra dollars for first-class service like this is a no-brainer.
	
After you set your prices, keep close tabs on what your competition is doing. 
Are they raising their prices? Lowering them? When your competition moves, 
be prepared to adjust your prices accordingly.

Selling the eBay way
Many home-based businesspeople have found 
success on eBay (www.ebay.com), the popular 
auction Web site. Why eBay? Because it’s the most 
successful auction site with the widest reach to a 
global audience of buyers. In recent years, eBay 
has introduced fixed-price listings for sellers who 
want to sell their products for a set price without 
going through the hassle and uncertainty of an 
auction. Some home-based businesspeople have 
discovered that they can get more than enough 
business just by selling on eBay, while others have 
used eBay as a stepping stone to bigger-and-
better things. Whatever your long-term goals may 
be, selling your products on eBay is an extremely 
easy thing to do, and your listings can reach a 
nationwide, and even worldwide, audience — 
exposing your products to a much larger number 
of potential buyers than if you sold them only in your 
local area. This increased exposure translates to 
higher prices and more profit in your pocket.
Here are a few recent eBay success stories:
	✓	A few years ago, Cristiane Bastos opened an 
eBay store, called Butterfly Twins, where she 
started selling Rosa Chá bikinis from Brazil. 
The bikinis were quickly gaining in popular­
ity at the time because they were prominently 
featured in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edi­
tion. As her eBay business grew, she added 
one-piece swimsuits and Havaianas flip-flop 
sandals to her sales mix, followed by high-
end items, such as Oakley, Revo, and Nike 
sunglasses and athletic watches. By carefully 
researching which of her items were selling 
best, and which eBay listings drew the most 
customers and best prices, Cristiane opti­
mized her approach, and sales quickly shot 
up 600 percent.
	✓	For years, Scott Griggs had a traditional 
bricks-and-mortar store in which he sold his 
model trains. However, the high overhead 
costs involved in running a store put a lot 
of pressure on Scott’s bottom line, squeez­
ing his profits in the process. Finally, when it 
was clear that keeping his store open would 
eventually push him over a huge financial 
cliff, Scott closed the store and moved his 
model train business to eBay. Today Scott 
posts 3,500 to 4,000 auction listings on eBay 
each month, along with another 2,000 or so 
eBay store listings each month.
	✓	After being a buyer on eBay for a number 
of years, Tara Barney decided to pursue an 
idea she had to become a seller of jewelry 
she made that matched the color schemes 
of her favorite children’s clothing lines. The 
result was a new eBay-based business — 
Tara’s Treasures. Using a feature called 
Custom Pages, Tara created her own look 
and feel for her brand — when customers 
encounter one of her pages on the eBay 
Web site, they immediately know they’re 
on the Tara’s Treasures site. Tara’s busi­
ness has done so well that Tara upgraded 
to a Premium Store on eBay to handle 
the increased volume and to analyze her 
buyers’ shopping patterns.
Although eBay can be a great place for home-
based businesses to sell their wares, doing 
so comes at a cost. eBay charges a variety of 
fees that fall under two broad categories: inser­
tion fees and final value fees. You pay insertion 
fees to run your auction or fixed-price listing — 
whether or not you sell the item. You pay final 
value fees only when you sell the item; these 
fees are a percentage of the price for which you 
sell your item. You can find much more informa­
tion about eBay fees at pages.ebay.com/
HELP/SELL/fees.html.
If you don’t feel like dealing with eBay your­
self, a number of companies are out there to 
sell your items on eBay for you. Of course, you 
have to pay such companies a fee for their 
services. But some people use them to save 
time and to attract more buyers (thanks to the 
greater amount of traffic many of the service 
sites attract).

 Chapter 7: The Price Is Right: Deciding How Much to Charge
Changing your prices
After you decide on a specific price for a product or service, your clients 
expect to pay that price for the foreseeable future. No one likes buying things 
from a company that changes its prices every other week (or, in the case of 
gasoline, every other hour). However, at some time, you may need to change 
your prices, either up or down. If the changes translate into price increases, 
you may have to overcome the resistance of your clients and customers. But 
if the changes are price decreases, I doubt anyone objects!
In the following sections, we look at price increases and price decreases — 
and how each impacts your business.
Increasing your prices
Price increases aren’t usually pleasant events for the company making them — 
no company wants to tell its clients they have to pay more money for the same 
product — but they’re often necessary. Some of the most common reasons for 
price increases are
	
✓	You’ve underpriced your products. After you set a price and begin 
to sell your products and services, you may discover that the money 
you’re bringing in isn’t enough to cover the expenses of the business 
and generate a reasonable profit. In this case, when you can’t or don’t 
want to reduce your expenses to bring your costs in line with the money 
you’re bringing into your business, you have no other choice (assuming 
you want to stay in business) than to increase your prices.
	
✓	Your expenses have increased. If your costs of production increase, 
you can either reduce your profit or increase your price. The choice is 
up to you (although if your expenses have dramatically increased, you 
may have to do both).
	
✓	You need to cover a client’s hidden expenses. If you’re performing 
services for a client and discover additional costs from working with 
that client that you didn’t anticipate (for example, your client requires 
you to attend meetings twice a week instead of just once a month as you 
planned), you have to find a way to recoup them without reducing your 
profit. The easiest way is to increase your price.
	
✓	You want to test the marketplace. Sometimes you simply want to test 
the marketplace with a higher price to see whether the quantity of units 
you sell increases, decreases, or stays the same. Airlines, food manufac­
turers, and others test the marketplace all the time. Who knows? You 
may discover that your customers are more willing to pay a higher price 
for your products and services than you thought.

164
Part II: Managing Your Money 
	
✓	You don’t want the work. If you don’t want to do work for certain cli­
ents at the low prices you’ve agreed to, the best way to get out of this 
situation is to raise your prices far beyond your normal rates. If the 
customer decides to pay more, great — you just won the lottery! If not, 
you won’t miss it. Peter has been known to increase his prices when he’s 
booked up with a lot of projects. When someone is willing to pay the 
(much) higher fare for a new project, he makes room in his schedule to 
accommodate it.
	
Don’t be embarrassed by your prices or hesitate to raise or lower them when 
doing so makes sense for your business. If you decide to increase your prices, 
however, be as forthcoming as you can be, and give your customers plenty of 
notice so they can adjust.
Decreasing your prices
In some cases, you may have a good reason to decrease your prices. Though 
you may not have to decrease your prices as often as you increase them, 
you’re bound to have to do so from time to time. The main reasons for 
decreasing your prices are
	
✓	You’ve overpriced your services. If you’ve overpriced your services, 
you can choose to keep the extra money as profit (making for a very 
nice windfall, thank you very much), or you can give it back to your cus­
tomers in the form of lower prices, refunds, or rebates.
	
✓	Your expenses have decreased. If you’ve decreased your expenses, you 
may want to lower your prices. Then again, you can always keep the 
fruit of your decreased expenses as profit and increase the amount of 
money you put into savings. Doing so will motivate you to continue to 
find new ways to cut expenses.
	
✓	You want to reward long-term clients. Long-term clients always like to 
know you appreciate them. You can show your appreciation (and build 
their loyalty) by reducing prices for them, either on a one-time basis or 
permanently — perhaps in the form of a discount card, special gift, or 
other premium.
	
✓	You want to get new work. One way to get new business is to drop your 
prices for new customers as a way to introduce them to your company 
and your products and services. Two-for-one specials for new custom­
ers, percent-off coupons, and the like are all ways to get new customers 
to try out your company — and, ideally, stick around.
	
✓	You want to extend a professional courtesy. Doctors, lawyers, and 
other professionals are noted for extending lower prices to colleagues as 
a professional courtesy. Why not extend lower prices to your colleagues, 
too? How about discounting your products and services for other home-
based business owners?

165
 Chapter 7: The Price Is Right: Deciding How Much to Charge
	
As with any other price changes, make sure you lower your prices as part of 
an overall strategy, not just as a reaction to some momentary event. If in 
doubt, leave your prices where they are until the case for changing them is 
more compelling. Not sure whether it’s time, yet? Then it probably isn’t.
Deciding whether to discount
When you’re starting out in your home-based business, you need to get the ball 
rolling. Your prices can help you do so, or they can stop the ball dead in its tracks. 
In the beginning, getting work — regardless of how much you charge — may be 
more important than charging just the right price. After you build up experience 
and references, you can better call the shots regarding your pricing.
	
In the beginning, you want to get known. You want to develop a buzz about 
your company and its goods and services. You want people to start talking 
about you and your company. As they do, and as more and more clients seek 
you out, you have the leverage to charge them what you’re worth. In other 
words, if you’re going to discount your products and services, the time to do 
so is when you’re getting your home-based business established — not after 
you’ve developed a solid reputation, base of experience, and prices people 
have begun to rely on.
	
By far the biggest mistake home-based businesspeople make is chronic under­
charging. Chronic undercharging creates a downward spiral that slowly eats 
away at the foundations of your business — the longer it goes on, the weaker 
your business becomes. Eventually, the bottom falls out altogether, and you’re 
left with nothing but unpaid bills.
Chronic undercharging creates the following problems in home-based 
businesses:
	
✓	Low-ball clients: You tend to attract customers who are much more 
interested in paying as little as possible than in buying the best product 
or service out there.
	
✓	Low-margin work: You spend far too much of your time on low-margin 
work and far less of your time on high-paid projects that offer the greatest 
return for your time and money. Because there are still only 24 hours in 
a day, you’re working more hours for less pay — a going-out-of-business 
plan if we’ve ever seen one.
	
✓	Burnout: You force yourself into a situation in which you focus far more 
time on your business than you do on maintaining and improving your 
relationships with friends and family or on keeping yourself healthy and 
happy — a classic road to burnout. Burnout isn’t unique to home-based 
businesses, but it can be a very real problem — especially for people 
who are juggling the demands of kids and family or a job that they 
haven’t yet left behind.

166
Part II: Managing Your Money 
	
Discounting is okay as long as you do it consciously and in line with long-term 
strategy. It’s not okay when it becomes a knee-jerk reaction to every potential 
client who hesitates for a moment when you quote a price. If you’re going to 
discount your services, consider some of the following approaches:
	
✓	Offer every tenth pound of coffee for free.
	
✓	Give a 25-percent discount on your client’s first order.
	
✓	Offer volume discounts.
	
✓	Give a discount for paying before a certain date.
	
✓	Offer a variety of products and services at a variety of price points — 
high, low, and in between. When faced with a client or client-to-be who 
wants you to discount your prices, you’re far better off cutting the prod­
ucts or services delivered than cutting your unit price for those services.
	
	So, for example, when a client balks at your quotation of $1,000 to 
develop a turnkey Web site, don’t say: “What if I drop my price to $750? 
Do we have a deal?” Instead, say: “No problem. Here’s a complete list of 
all the different features you get in my $1,000 plan. Which features do 
you want to delete to meet your budget?”
Taking a stand on prices
When you’ve established a price and your prospective client doesn’t want to 
pay it, at some point, you have to take a stand. You can’t just give your prod­
ucts or services away, right? Often, you simply want to maintain your prices 
exactly where they are and deny requests to lower or discount them. Here 
are some strategies to help you hold the line on your prices when you think 
it’s in your best interest to do so:
	
✓	Understand your limits. When you want to take a stand and hold the 
line on your prices, first you need to understand the limitations within 
which you can work and the minimum prices you’re willing to accept.
	
✓	Learn to say no. Far too many people cave in the moment their custom­
ers show even one iota of resistance to their prices, no matter how well 
thought out and reasonable they may be. But, lucky for you, we’ve found 
a very easy cure to this kind of reaction: Just say no! Know your limits, 
and when someone wants you to go beyond them, be ready, willing, and 
able to say no.
	
✓	Be ready to explain why. When you say no to people who think their 
requests are reasonable, you have to be able to explain why. Most 
people like to hear some rationale when someone else denies their “rea­
sonable” requests. Responses like “I’ll lose money on the deal at that 
price” or “That’s a going-out-of-business plan for me” may be sufficient. 

167
 Chapter 7: The Price Is Right: Deciding How Much to Charge
In contrast, responses like “Because I got up on the wrong side of the 
bed this morning” or “I always charge you more than the rest of my cus­
tomers” may not leave the best impressions with your customers.
	
✓	It’s not personal — it’s business. Separate your personal feelings from 
the need to conduct your business in a way that ensures its survival. 
Although you may like the feeling of cutting your prices and giving away 
your products and services to anyone who asks, you’ll quickly go out of 
business with that approach. Remember: You’ve got a business to run — 
it isn’t a charity.
	
✓	Be prepared with a counterproposal. Whenever you tell a prospective 
client or customer no, be prepared with an alternative that you can say 
yes to. For example, if you don’t want to agree to dropping your price 
from $100 to $75 a unit, as requested by your client, you may be able to 
say yes to $95 — a figure that may well seal the deal for you.
	
You’re going to face times when you have to take a stand and hold the line 
against dropping your prices. Although you may lose potential customers in 
the process, your business will be healthier for it. And a healthy business is a 
business that thrives and grows — building long-term income for you and an 
ongoing partner for your clients.

Getting Health Insurance and 
Planning for Your Retirement
In This Chapter
▶	Identifying the best benefits for you
▶	Deciding on a healthcare strategy that meets your needs
▶	Considering other benefits
M
ost full-time employees take their benefits for granted. Sick leave, holi­
days, tuition assistance, healthcare, worker’s compensation, 401(k) 
savings plans, and more are an expected part of any full-time job. However, 
when you start your own home-based business, you quickly discover that 
benefits aren’t something to take for granted. In fact, some benefits aren’t 
even available to home-based businesspeople at all, and those that are have 
real and substantial costs.
For many prospective home-based businesspeople, their biggest concern 
about leaving their full-time jobs behind to start their own businesses is 
losing their benefits, especially benefits related to healthcare.
They have good reason to be concerned, too. A hospital stay for a routine 
surgery to remove an inflamed appendix or to fix a damaged knee joint can 
quickly run into the tens of thousands of dollars. And if you have the misfor­
tune of having to undergo extensive treatment and hospitalization for a more 
serious condition, such as cancer or an automobile accident, you can expect 
to owe hundreds of thousands of dollars. Just a month’s prescription for cer­
tain name-brand drugs can cost hundreds of dollars or more.
In this chapter, we take a look at the benefits available to home-based busi­
nesspeople. Because health insurance is the primary concern for most pro­
spective owners of home-based businesses, we take an especially close look 
at that particular benefit: what to look for in a healthcare plan and how to get 
the coverage you need.

170
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Providing Your Own Benefits
Healthcare in the United States is so expensive that a recent study published 
in the American Journal of Medicine found that 62.1 percent of all bankrupt­
cies in the United States have a medical cause. Even more chilling is the fact 
that 75 percent of these medical debtors had health insurance. After years of 
having benefits provided by your employers — generally without even having 
to ask for them — you’re taking a very big step into the great unknown when 
you start your own home-based business. For example:
	
✓	Do you qualify for medical coverage? And if you do qualify, can you 
afford it?
	
✓	What if you’re injured and can’t work — what then?
	
✓	Will you be able to set up a retirement fund? Are there limits to what 
you can contribute?
These questions — and many, many more — are valid concerns for indi­
viduals planning to make the move into self-employment, and you shouldn’t 
quit your day job before you have this particular aspect of your work life 
figured out. It’s important for you — and for your family and loved ones — to 
address these concerns sooner rather than later. After all, you can lose not 
only your business but everything in your personal life if a medical disaster 
strikes when you’re unprepared.
When you’re the boss, you have to find the best benefits you can get for your 
hard-earned money, recognizing that what’s best for someone else may not 
be best for you. Finding what’s best for you in terms of benefits generally 
requires a lot of research on your part, but the payoff is an enhanced quality 
of life, and it’s well worth the expense.
The best solution for your benefits involves two key factors:
	
✓	Pricing your products and services high enough to make sure you cover 
the cost of health insurance
	
✓	Not letting yourself get taken in by what appears to be inexpensive and 
adequate coverage but what is really inadequate
Working for yourself doesn’t necessarily mean fewer benefits. If you do your 
homework, and if your prices are high enough, working for yourself can actu­
ally mean more — and often better — benefits. Instead of being saddled with 
whatever benefit plans your employer decides are best for you, you get to pick 
and choose which benefit plans you really want. You pay only for the plans you 
need and can tailor your benefit plans to your own unique wants and desires.
For instance, is having income in the event that you’re disabled — and 
unable to work — particularly important to you? (If your work involves physi­
cal labor or you’re the primary wage earner in your household, it should be.) 

171
 Chapter 8: Getting Health Insurance and Planning for Your Retirement
If it is, focus on getting good disability coverage. Do you want to ensure that 
you’ll be able to retire comfortably? (We can’t think of anyone who doesn’t 
want to do so.) If so, you can structure a retirement plan that meets your 
exact needs. Or if you simply want to have the best medical plan you can 
buy, go for it. It’s your choice. Whichever benefits you choose to obtain, you 
need to do some planning and research before you settle on anything.
	
As a home-based businessperson, you — not someone else — get to decide 
what the best solution is for you and your loved ones. Having the ability to 
decide such important issues yourself is one of the things that makes working 
for yourself such an attractive option.
Working benefits into the mix
Q: This is my fourth year as a freelance transla­
tor, and it’s been a good experience so far. My 
problem is not being able to secure individual 
health insurance thanks to past health condi­
tions. Another concern is how to set aside funds 
for retirement. My income is good at times, but 
some months are typically low. Taking a vaca­
tion also seems impossible because I can’t 
afford to have no income while I’m away. Plus, 
I may lose clients when they discover I’m not 
available when they need me. Any advice?
A: You’re definitely not alone in worrying about 
how to provide for benefits like vacations, 
healthcare, and retirement. These three con­
cerns are among the most critical issues facing 
people who are or want to be self-employed. 
The hurdles in lining up such benefits keep too 
many people working in less-than-rewarding 
salaried jobs instead of pursuing their dreams 
to be their own bosses.
Although lining up these benefits is more dif­
ficult than it should be, doing so needs to be 
one of your top priorities if you want to become 
your own employer. Try to develop a new atti­
tude toward these responsibilities: Keep in mind 
that the cost of benefits, such as vacation time, 
retirement funds, and health insurance, are part 
of the cost of doing business, and you must build 
them into your fee structure and set aside the 
funds needed to cover them. If you can’t afford 
to take vacations, for example, you’re either 
not charging enough or you need to develop a 
marketing campaign to bring in more business 
during the slow times you mention.
That said, here are some options for getting 
past the difficulties involved in lining up these 
benefits:
	✓	Health insurance: Obtaining affordable 
health insurance is a national crisis, espe­
cially for the self-employed. One option is 
to go through a professional association, 
which may be able to negotiate coverage 
for its members. In addition, some states — 
such as California, Colorado, Connecticut, 
Maryland, and Texas — have a mandatory 
small business insurance provision. If you 
have two people working in your com­
pany (which can include your spouse!), 
you can get health insurance. To find out 
the situation in your state, check with your 
state insurance commissioner, visit www.
healthinsurecoverage.com, or 
contact an insurance agent.
	✓	Retirement: Open a SEP-IRA account and 
put 10 percent (or as high a percentage as 
you can afford) of everything you earn into 
it or some other retirement account. Make 
this a habit.

172
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Choosing Your Healthcare Coverage
Of all the benefits available to most workers today, one in particular cre­
ates the most concern for people considering a move to starting their own 
home-based businesses, and that’s health insurance. Unfortunately, health 
insurance has a (much-deserved) reputation for being hard to obtain for 
individuals, it’s often expensive, and the consequences of not having suffi­
cient coverage can be financially catastrophic — particularly in the event of a 
major or prolonged illness.
In fact, the fear of having inadequate health insurance — or, even worse, no 
coverage at all — keeps many people from making the move to starting their 
own businesses. Instead, they remain stuck in jobs they don’t like, getting paid 
less than they feel they should, to ensure that their health needs are met.
	
The simple fact is that you, as a home-based business owner today, have 
more options available to you than ever before. You have more options both 
in the kinds of coverage available to you and in the different approaches you 
can take to get the coverage you need. In some cases, the healthcare plan you 
select as a home-based business owner may even provide better coverage for 
you and your family for a lower premium than you ever paid in your regular 
job. Not only that, but as a self-employed individual it’s highly likely that you’ll 
be able to deduct as a business expense 100 percent of your medical and 
dental insurance costs. Be sure to consult with a CPA or qualified tax profes­
sional to see whether your plan qualifies for this deduction, and check out 
Chapter 9 for more on taxes and deductions.
Exploring the spectrum of 
healthcare coverage
When starting your own home-based business, you have a number of health­
care choices, all of which boil down to either obtaining health insurance or 
going at it on your own.
At one end of the spectrum, fee-for-service care is the traditional form of 
medicine that many people grew up with (some people today call it old-
fashioned). Under a fee-for-service healthcare plan, you decide which doctor 
you want to see, schedule your own exam, get diagnosed and treated, and 
make your payment directly to the doctor on the way out the door.
At the other end of the spectrum is a particular kind of health insurance, the 
health maintenance organization — also commonly known as an HMO. In an 
HMO, you agree to have all your healthcare needs taken care of by the HMO 

173
 Chapter 8: Getting Health Insurance and Planning for Your Retirement
and its administrators and physicians. The HMO hires and pays the doctors, 
nurses, and physician’s assistants who diagnose your illnesses; the HMO 
builds or leases the facilities where you go for medical examinations; and 
the HMO decides whether or not to authorize and pay for your treatment. In 
many cases, you never even see a bill or invoice, although most HMOs today 
require at least a nominal payment, known as a co-payment, at the time of ser­
vice. (Today HMOs are also increasing their co-payments.)
Each of these extremes on the healthcare spectrum — and all the variations 
in between — has its good and bad points. By going on your own, you have 
maximum control and flexibility over your healthcare, but, unless you’re well 
off financially, a catastrophic injury or illness has the power not only to put 
you out of business, but also to potentially bankrupt you. At the other end of 
the spectrum, in exchange for the peace of mind that HMOs offer, you give up 
a large amount of control over the management of your healthcare, as well as 
much of the flexibility to use whatever doctor you like, whenever you want. 
You go to the HMO’s facilities, select a doctor from a limited list the HMO 
puts together for you, and generally follow that doctor’s treatment options.
When seeking health insurance for your home-based business, you have a 
number of options available to you. For example:
	
✓	If you start up your home-based business while you’re still working your 
regular job, you can simply keep your current healthcare plan as it is. 
This option is likely to be relatively inexpensive for you and your busi­
ness — particularly if your employer covers some or all of the cost of 
your healthcare plan.
	
✓	If your spouse has health insurance at work, you can decide to use his 
or her plan to meet your healthcare needs as you establish your own 
home-based business. This option, too, can be a relatively inexpensive 
one for you and your business.
	
✓	If you decide to leave your regular job to start your own home-based 
business and you live in the United States, COBRA — the Consolidated 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act — requires your employer to 
extend healthcare benefits to you for a minimum of 18 months (and in 
some cases, even longer) at the same rate offered to all other company 
employees (a piece of which most companies pay as an employee ben­
efit) for comparable coverage. After the 18-month period elapses, you 
can generally convert to an individual plan with little muss or fuss, but 
usually at a significantly higher cost. (When Peter’s COBRA plan expired 
a number of years ago, the cost to cover his family of five jumped from 
$750 a month to more than $1,350 a month. He shopped around for and 
found a new, less expensive plan within minutes after he got that par­
ticular bit of news.)

174

✓	If you want to find your own coverage as you begin your home-based 
business, you can conduct your own search for health coverage. (A 
growing number of Internet sites, such as www.eHealthInsurance.
com, are dedicated to helping small business owners select and apply 
for health insurance.) You can start by doing a keyword search on a 
search engine. Alternatively, a good insurance agent or broker can find 
the best coverage for you while saving you precious time in the process. 
In comparing policies, check deductibles (the amount you pay before 
your insurance pays), co-payments, co-insurance (the percentage of a 
doctor or hospital bill you must pay beyond the co-payment), out-of-
pocket limits (particularly important with co-insurance), lifetime maxi­
mum coverage, and limitations and restrictions on what is covered.
As a home-based businessperson, you have the luxury (and the burden) 
of almost unlimited choices when dealing with your healthcare. From fee-
for-service to HMO, the choice is up to you. The right decision depends on 
what’s best for you, your family, and your business.
Looking at fee-for-service and 
indemnity healthcare plans
Under traditional fee-for-service medical care, what’s good for the patient 
is also generally good for the doctor because their goals are aligned. As we 
mention earlier, fee-for-service care is when doctors are paid directly for 
their medical services — whether by the patient or by an insurance com­
pany or other entity. With this kind of care, you’re free to go to any doctor 
or hospital you choose — assuming you have enough money for the proce­
dure. Although this method of payment is fine for simple, relatively low-cost 
procedures, it leaves the patient at tremendous financial risk if he becomes 
seriously ill or injured and requires extensive testing, hospitalization, or 
treatment.
With the traditional fee-for-service, on-your-own payment method, patients 
have the greatest freedom to choose their doctors and hospitals. They can 
get their healthcare directly — at any point in the system — without exter­
nally imposed limits. However, they often pay a lot of money for this privi­
lege. Fee-for-service is the least regulated form of healthcare, and fees can 
be unpredictable. Its unpredictability and generally high cost are driving fee-
for-service care toward extinction — despite the nostalgia that many people 
have for it. Today this form of healthcare is sometimes called going bare — 
that is, without insurance.
A desire to limit patient financial risk within the traditional fee-for-service 
approach has led to the emergence of indemnity insurance plans. Under 
indemnity plans, insurance companies agree to reimburse — or indemnify — 
policyholders for a fixed percentage of their medical bills after payment of a 

175
 Chapter 8: Getting Health Insurance and Planning for Your Retirement
pre-established deductible. For example, patients with this form of medical 
insurance may pay 20 percent of a medical expense, while their insurance 
company picks up the remaining 80 percent. Although indemnity plans still 
leave patients with some amount of financial risk, many people like these 
plans because they allow patients to select most any doctor or hospital they 
desire.
	
Many home-based business owners find that it makes sense to take advantage 
of a fairly recent wrinkle in the tax laws: health savings accounts (HSAs). HSAs — 
established by Congress in 2003 — allow you to set aside pretax dollars to pay 
for routine (and relatively low-cost) medical procedures, such as annual physi­
cals, eye exams, dental checkups, and the like, while reserving insurance cover­
age for high-cost, catastrophic health events, such as major surgeries or cancer 
treatments. More than 5 million Americans have enrolled in HSAs. You may be 
able to supplement your HSA with a primary care doctor practicing “boutique” 
medicine, who will, for about a hundred dollars a month, provide a level of care 
that includes house calls and access by cellphone.
Checking out managed care plans
Managed care is the overall term applied to a system of healthcare in which 
an individual pays a fixed premium for a guarantee of all-encompassing, pre­
ventive, and therapeutic healthcare with minimal additional out-of-pocket 
expenses. The entire universe of managed care systems covers an incredibly 
diverse range of programs — from managed indemnity insurance to HMOs. 
Although separating one form of managed care from another is sometimes 
difficult, all managed care programs implement formal policies and proce­
dures that control three common characteristics:
	
✓	Access
	
✓	Cost
	
✓	Quality
By placing strict limits and controls on these three areas, managed care pro­
viders are able to provide complete, quality medical care to their members 
at lower costs than other forms of healthcare. For example, one way that 
certain kinds of managed care providers control costs is by hiring their own 
doctors and nurses. Another way to control costs is by making concerted 
efforts to provide preventive care to patients. Preventing a serious illness is 
generally far less expensive than curing it.
In the next sections, we distinguish between two types of managed care: 
health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organiza­
tions (PPOs).

176
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Health maintenance organizations (HMOs)
An HMO is a form of managed care that either operates its own healthcare 
facilities or contracts with hospitals and doctors to provide healthcare ser­
vices at predetermined rates. The membership fees go into a pool of money 
that pays for doctors, nurses, equipment, facilities, and the other costs of 
providing healthcare services to members. Any money left over is profit. 
After the membership fee has been paid, the greatest risk to the HMO is pro­
viding too much care or care that’s too expensive.
All HMOs rely on the primary care physician to control costs by controlling 
access to the services of the HMO. A primary care physician is a doctor whose 
job is to assess a patient’s medical condition and determine which services 
are required to bring her back to a state of good health at the minimum nec­
essary cost. Primary care physicians are often under considerable pressure 
to keep costs down, so their jobs sometimes appear to be to find ways to 
deny care rather than provide it. Because of this perception, primary care 
physicians are often known as gatekeepers.
	
Comparison shopping among different HMOs can be frustratingly difficult. 
Sophisticated, often confusing issues require your consideration, including 
a wide array of different co-payments (both for services and for prescribed 
drugs), coverage limitations and exclusions, waiting periods, and more. At 
times, even the information sources you use may not permit easy comparison 
of one HMO to another. Consider the following as you try to find the right 
HMO for you:
	
✓	Your healthcare needs: You and your family want high quality, low costs, 
and easy access to your healthcare provider and a broad range of covered 
services. But you have to consider the limits in terms of the amount of 
dollars you’re willing and able to put into your quest for quality health­
care and the choice of plans that are available to you. Further, it’s unlikely 
that you’ll find a plan that meets all your needs at a price you can afford. 
Your final selection will, therefore, involve some compromise.
	
	Unless you have unlimited resources to pour into purchasing your 
healthcare, selecting an HMO also forces you to face some limits. 
Finding the best HMO for you and your family involves striking a balance 
between your healthcare needs and wishes and the resources you have 
available to purchase them.
	
✓	Other deciding factors: Although you have your own unique medical 
needs, every healthcare consumer should consider several factors when 
shopping for an HMO. Depending on your personal situation, you may 
have several health plans to choose from, or you may have only one or 
two. Whatever the options available to you, you need to carefully weigh 
the advantages and disadvantages of each before you make your final 
decision.

177
 Chapter 8: Getting Health Insurance and Planning for Your Retirement
	
	After you enroll in a plan, switching plans may not be easy to do if you 
discover you made the wrong choice, so take your time to review each 
plan carefully and consider the following in your decision:
 
• Basic needs versus extras: With medical care, keep in mind the 
difference between what you need and what you want. Does the 
HMO you’ve chosen provide all the basic health services you need 
to maintain your health or return you from illness? Does it also 
provide the extras — such as a pleasant and relaxing environment, 
clean and modern hospitals, or free car seats for newborns — that 
you consider important to your healthcare experience?
 
• Access: Does the HMO you’re considering provide you with access 
to the full range of physicians and medical facilities that are required 
to maintain your good health? Does the HMO offer specialists who 
are trained and competent in orthopedics, pediatrics, surgery, and 
so on? Are appointments readily available, or will you be required 
to wait long periods of time to see a doctor? Will you have access to 
24-hour-a-day emergency-room care at a reasonable price?
 
• Choice: A hot button for many healthcare consumers is the right 
to see the doctor of their choice. Although some HMOs are restric­
tive and offer few care options, others offer a wide variety of 
doctors, clinics, and hospitals to choose from. When considering 
an HMO, be sure to find out how flexible your plan will be. Will 
the HMO assign you to a primary care doctor, or will you be able 
to make your own choice? If you don’t like your doctor, can you 
easily switch to another? Will you have to go to a specific clinic or 
hospital, or will you have the option to select which one you want 
to go to? Ask an insurance agent what would happen under differ­
ent hypothetical situations.
 
• Cost: The price of healthcare is always a major issue for healthcare 
consumers. Is the plan affordable? Will you receive a full range of 
services for an amount you can afford? If you’re comparing plans, 
what do you get in the higher-priced plan that the lower-priced 
plan doesn’t offer? Should you consider add-ons to the plan, such 
as point-of-service options?
 
• Coverage: Every HMO is different — some provide more extensive 
coverage than others. What does the plan cover? Does it include 
office visits and hospital stays? How about eye and dental care? 
Are certain procedures excluded from the plan? Do you under­
stand how your HMO defines experimental or unproven cures? 
What about pre-existing conditions? If you have asthma when you 
join the plan, for example, will your new HMO cover it? If you’re 
outside the plan area, will the plan pay for emergency care at 
another hospital?
 
• Ease of use: Every form of healthcare involves a certain amount 
of red tape and bureaucracy — HMOs are no exception. Are office 
hours convenient, and are facilities, clinics, and hospitals within a 

178
Part II: Managing Your Money 
reasonable distance from your home or work? Does the plan offer 
evening or weekend appointments? Are special phone lines avail­
able to make appointments or ask questions that don’t require 
a physician’s intervention? What kinds of paperwork (and how 
much) will you be required to fill out?
 
• Quality: The old adage that you get what you pay for is often 
true when it comes to healthcare. Are the doctors and nurses in 
the plan top-notch, or are they something less? Are the facilities 
modern, clean, and large enough to handle the needs of the plan’s 
members? What’s the overall quality of care dispensed by the 
HMO — is it excellent, good, or just adequate? How does the plan 
score on member satisfaction? Does the HMO have a history of 
extensive member complaints and grievances? Is the HMO National 
Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) or federally qualified?
As you research your healthcare options, you quickly find significant differ­
ences among plans. It’s your job to determine whether a specific plan meets 
your needs. While the HMO’s glossy brochures and glowing advertisements 
may seem attractive, try to get beyond its sugar-coated exteriors to the real 
story. Ask your insurance broker pointed questions. Which plan did he pick, 
and why? Is he happy with his choice? Why or why not? Is he planning to 
switch to another plan when he gets the opportunity?
Ultimately, you’re faced with a choice that balances your healthcare needs 
with the resources you have available to pay for those needs. The best choice 
for you is the choice that closely balances these two competing demands.
San Diego cares about its businesses
In most cities in the United States, small busi­
nesses are left to fend for themselves when it 
comes to finding affordable healthcare solutions, 
but the city of San Diego, California, has decided 
to change all that. Specifically designed for local 
small businesses with two or more employees, 
the City Care Benefits Plan — sponsored by the 
Business Improvement District Council — offers 
comprehensive group health, dental, and vision 
plans at the kind of rates usually available only 
to very large businesses. A variety of procedures 
and services are fully covered under these plans, 
with small co-payments of $10 to $20 for office 
visits and drug prescriptions. With this progres­
sive benefits plan, San Diego has addressed a 
very important need in the community. Scott 
Kessler, CEO of the Business Improvement 
District Council, said, “Many small business 
owners forgo health insurance due to cost, qual­
ity, and administrative obstacles. The City Care 
Benefits Plan is designed to meet the unique 
needs of small businesses.” Considering that 
85 percent of the uninsured population of San Diego 
work for small businesses, the City Care Benefits 
Plan may have a major impact on many thousands 
of employees and their families. For more informa­
tion, visit the San Diego Business Improvement 
District Council Web site at www.bidcouncil.

 Chapter 8: Getting Health Insurance and Planning for Your Retirement
Preferred provider organizations (PPOs)
Some years ago, in an effort to contain spiraling costs, indemnity insurers 
introduced a new form of healthcare — the preferred provider organization 
(PPO). In a PPO, the insurer strikes deals with selected physicians to provide 
care on a discounted fee-for-service basis. Patients are then given financial 
incentives to use physicians on a list provided to them by their insurance 
company. PPOs can be thought of as a transitional arrangement between fee-
for-service and HMOs because they exhibit some elements of a loosely orga­
nized managed care network while maintaining a degree of physician choice 
and/or service locations for the patient. They’re also like fee-for-service plans 
in the sense that the more doctors do for you, the more they get paid.
Typical PPOs provide some expense predictability for their enrollees by 
having maximum out-of-pocket limits, but they often have exclusions and 
waiting periods for pre-existing conditions, which could include pregnancy. 
Within a PPO, preventive services are minimal, but most have disease screen­
ing and usually provide smoking-cessation programs. If you go out of the net­
work for your care, your out-of-pocket costs increase.
Investigating other healthcare coverage
A number of other health-related benefits, besides your main healthcare plan, 
are available to you. Depending on your situation, they may or may not make 
sense for you and your business, so be sure to study your options carefully 
before committing to a plan. The following are just a few of the additional 
health-related benefits you may want to consider:
	
✓	Dental: You can find a variety of dental insurance plans to choose from. 
Although many dental plans have high deductibles and rigid guidelines 
for what they pay for — and how much — a dental plan can be a god­
send in the event of a catastrophic dental problem, accident, or illness.
	
✓	Vision care: Vision care plans generally pay for eye examinations and 
sometimes for glasses or contact lenses, as well. Elective procedures, 
such as surgery to permanently correct nearsightedness, usually aren’t 
covered.
	
✓	Gyms and health clubs: Many large companies have their own on-site 
gyms and health clubs. Although you may not have the room (or the 
money) to set up your own on-site gym, don’t let this stop you from join­
ing a local gym and working out regularly.
Because many healthcare plans don’t include dental, vision, or access to 
gyms or health clubs, you need to decide whether they’re important enough 
for you to purchase using the proceeds of your business.

Part II: Managing Your Money 
Considering the Need for Other Benefits
If you currently work — or have worked in the past — in a regular busi­
ness, you know that you may want to provide yourself some other benefits 
besides health insurance. While insuring yourself against a catastrophic loss 
Ways to cut your healthcare costs
Although healthcare plans are becoming more 
flexible and easier to obtain for their users, the 
cost of healthcare continues to rise because 
of increased competitive pressures within the 
industry. In his book Human Resources Kit For 
Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley), Harold Messmer 
offers the following advice for cutting your 
healthcare costs:
	✓	Affiliate with the largest group possible. 
Although you can find exceptions, the 
larger the group that’s insured, the more 
competitive the rates tend to be. Instead 
of seeking coverage as a one-person, 
home-based business, check into health­
care plans offered by local chambers of 
commerce, industry associations, alumni 
associations, and professional organiza­
tions. Many of these groups offer health­
care plans with competitive rates. Other 
plans to check are those offered by national 
organizations like the National Federation 
of Independent Businesses (www.nfib.
org) and the Freelancers Union (www.
freelancersunion.org) or regional 
or state organizations like Support Services 
Alliance (www.ssamembers.com), 
which serves New Yorkers.
	✓	Increase the deductible (co-payment). You 
can save anywhere from 10 to 50 percent 
on your premiums simply by increasing your 
deductibles or, in the case of HMOs, your 
co-payments. Increasing your deductible 
can be particularly effective if you aren’t 
a big user of your healthcare plan. Check 
with your health plan provider to see what 
your options are.
	✓	Consider working with a benefits consul­
tant. Unless you’re fully dedicated to study­
ing all the different healthcare coverage 
options available, it’s nearly impossible to 
know whether you’re getting the plan that’s 
best for you and your business. A benefits 
consultant is fully dedicated to that task and 
can be a genuine asset — both in locating 
the right plan for you and in negotiating the 
best rates possible. Ask friends and busi­
ness associates for a referral to a qualified 
consultant, or check the Yellow Pages.
In addition to following this advice, as a self-
employed individual, you likely can deduct 100 
percent of what you pay for medical and dental 
insurance from your earnings. Fortunately for 
you is the fact that you can deduct “above the 
line” from adjusted gross income. In addition, 
you can deduct a qualified, long-term care 
insurance contract for you, your spouse, or 
your dependents.
Just make sure you check IRS Publication 535 
or consult with a tax professional to verify that 
you’re purchasing insurance that qualifies for 
this favorable treatment.

181
 Chapter 8: Getting Health Insurance and Planning for Your Retirement
in the event of a serious or protracted illness is critically important for most 
people, other less critical benefits can help you protect your income, save for 
the future, and provide financial and psychic benefits.
In this section, we discuss the most common benefits besides healthcare.
Income protection
Imagine that you’re a professional writer, as is Peter, one of the authors of 
this book. And imagine that you depend on your physical ability to use your 
computer keyboard to do your writing. Now imagine that you’re diagnosed 
with carpal tunnel syndrome or a repetitive-motion injury that prevents you 
from using your computer for weeks or even months or years. What can you 
do, and how can you and your family survive the loss of income that such an 
injury causes?
Benefits in the income protection category protect workers and owners from 
potentially disastrous financial events like Peter’s carpel tunnel and include 
the following:
	
✓	Disability insurance: This form of insurance pays a percentage of 
income — generally less than 100 percent — in the event that injury 
or illness prevents a worker or owner from performing his or her job. 
Disability insurance is available to home-based businesses in either 
short- or long-term versions, but both can be very expensive.
	
✓	Workers’ compensation: This kind of insurance provides a fixed amount 
of income to workers who are injured on the job and is required of com­
panies with three or more employees or when non-owner employees are 
hired. Each state has different workers’ compensation insurance rules, 
so be sure to research your own situation before taking action.
	
✓	Unemployment insurance: This type of insurance provides a fixed 
amount of income to workers who lose their jobs through no fault of 
their own and is required by federal and state law of employers with one 
or more employees for at least 20 weeks in a calendar year.
For most home-based businesses, long-term disability insurance is the only 
form of income protection benefit you need to seriously consider. If you 
eventually hire employees, workers’ compensation and unemployment insur­
ance may be a requirement for your home-based business.

182
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Life insurance
Of course, no one likes to think about dying and leaving loved ones without 
a source of income. But if you die without having established some sort of 
retirement fund or a life insurance policy, that’s exactly what you’ll do. Life 
insurance pays whomever you designate as your beneficiary a lump sum of 
money if you die, thus providing some peace of mind that that person’s finan­
cial needs will be taken care of in the event of your death. The following are 
two types of life insurance:
	
✓	Life insurance policies: General life insurance policies are widely avail­
able, affordable, and easy to get. Find a good broker and have him 
explain the advantages and disadvantages of the different kinds of life 
insurance available to you, including term, universal, and whole life.
	
✓	Dependent life insurance: This type of life insurance provides coverage 
for the spouse of a home-based business owner and is often available for 
a small additional charge beyond your own policy.
Life insurance is an essential part of the benefits package of many home-
based businesses. Although the money paid out in the event of your death 
doesn’t do you any good personally (remember: you can’t take it with you!), 
the peace of mind it provides knowing that your loved ones will have the 
financial wherewithal to continue without you is often well worth the price.
Retirement and savings plans
Retirement and savings plans are a regular part of most businesses, and 
they can and should be part of your home-based business. As we discuss in 
Chapter 7, the prices you charge for your products and services should be 
high enough to provide you with a decent income and benefits.
You probably already know that Social Security alone simply can’t fill the 
bill for ensuring a comfortable and worry-free retirement. Unless you have a 
retirement plan or pension from your previous employer, the only way you’re 
going to have any sort of retirement plan for your home-based business is if 
you create one yourself. If you want to provide yourself a reliable source of 
income after you leave the world of work behind once and for all, you must 
start and grow a retirement fund.
Here are a few different options available to you:
	
✓	Simplified Employee Pension (SEP-IRA): Any home-based businessper­
son with at least some self-employment income can set up a tax-deferred 
SEP-IRA account to provide steady income in retirement. SEP-IRAs are 

183
 Chapter 8: Getting Health Insurance and Planning for Your Retirement
easy to open and can be maintained with minimal paperwork or red 
tape. The beauty of the SEP-IRA is that you’re allowed to contribute up 
to $49,000 or 25 percent of your business’s adjusted earned income per 
year, whichever is less. (Note that the flat dollar limit increases each 
year.) This amount may be ten times higher than you can contribute to 
plain old IRAs.
	
✓	Keogh plans: Keogh plans offer the highest limits for tax-deferred contri­
butions, but they’re complicated to set up and maintain. They come in 
two types:
 
• Defined contribution plan: This plan fixes the amount and the 
source of the contributions (contributions are limited to $49,000 
or 20 percent of your gross self-employment income for the year, 
whichever is less).
 
• Defined benefit plan: This plan attempts to pay out a particular 
sum of money each month in retirement (contributions are limited 
to the amount needed to eventually produce an annual pension 
payment of the lesser of $160,000 or 100 percent of your average 
compensation for your three highest years).
	
✓	SIMPLE: The Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) 
allows employees to make elective contributions of up to $11,500 per 
year and requires employers to make matching contributions of up to 3 
percent of each employee’s pay. Alternatively, you can decide to make 
a blanket contribution of 2 percent of each participating employee’s pay 
regardless of whether she makes any elective contributions.
	
Each of these options has its pluses and minuses, and one may be better for 
your business than another. Consult an accountant or professional tax expert 
before you decide on a particular plan. After you set up your plan, you’re 
pretty much stuck with it. Changing plan types is generally not encouraged 
by the tax code, and Congress has built in a variety of disincentives to ensure 
that you get the message.
Time off
Most regular businesses provide a wide variety of different forms of time 
off, including holidays and vacations. As the owner of your own home-based 
business, you get to decide which days you take off. In a home-based busi­
ness, however, time off works a bit differently than it does in a regular job. 
In a regular job, you usually get paid for holidays and vacation leave — even 
though you don’t actually work while you’re on leave. In a home-based busi­
ness, if you don’t work, you don’t get paid.

184
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Even though you don’t get paid, however, be sure to set aside some time off 
to get out of the office and recharge your batteries with family and friends. 
The two main forms of time off you need to consider as a home-based busi­
ness owner are
	
✓	Holidays: A number of standardized holidays are available for you to 
choose from, including Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, 
Thanksgiving, and Christmas. You decide whether you’re open for busi­
ness on those days.
	
✓	Vacations: Many small business owners find themselves working far 
harder than they ever did in a regular job, which makes setting aside 
vacation time away from the business even more important.
Make taking time off a regular part of your benefits package and an estab­
lished part of the way you do business — your attitude, as well as your rela­
tionships with friends and family, will benefit.
Child care
Working at home offers you a unique advantage that working outside the 
home doesn’t — you can be at home with your young children every day of 
the week if you want to. For parents who want to work but who don’t want to 
sacrifice their family lives to do so, working at home is truly the best of both 
worlds. However, if you work at home and have young children, you need 
to figure out how to keep them out of your way (and out of the way of your 
clients and customers) during your normal working hours. To do so, you gen­
erally need to obtain some sort of child care or else you’ll face ongoing chal­
lenges of meeting deadlines.
When it comes to child care, you basically have two options:
	
✓	On-site child care: Hire a babysitter or nanny to take care of your chil­
dren in your home on a regular schedule. If you have in-town relatives — 
perhaps your children’s grandparents, aunts, or uncles — even better! 
In-your-home care is often an ideal situation because you’re nearby if 
needed, but you’re still able to close your office door and leave your 
family life behind while you work.
	
✓	Off-site child care: Numerous off-site child care facilities are available to 
the home-based businessperson. From individual day-care providers to 
programs at schools and churches to neighborhood centers, you have 
plenty of options for ensuring quality care for your children.

Getting a Grip on Taxes 
and Deductions
In This Chapter
▶	Knowing what and when you need to pay
▶	Investigating the home-office deduction
▶	Figuring out what else you can deduct
▶	Reducing your tax burden
▶	Collecting sales taxes
A
ccording to the General Accounting Office, small business owners 
(including most home-based businesses) have more than 200 different 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) forms and schedules to choose from in any 
given tax year. These forms and schedules — with more than 8,000 lines, 
boxes, and blanks to fill in with your business’s unique set of numbers — are 
accompanied by more than 700 pages of instructions. And although no one 
business would ever have to use anything approaching all 200 of these forms 
and schedules, the paperwork problem is so overwhelming that it can easily 
threaten to bury the unwary home-based business owner.
	
If you fail to pay all the taxes you owe, pleading that you were confused by all 
the forms and schedules won’t earn you any sympathy with your friendly, 
local IRS agent. In addition to being billed for all the taxes you failed to pay, 
you can expect to pay interest and penalties on top of them. In some cases, 
the interest and penalties alone can amount to thousands of dollars.
Is it any wonder that the first thing many savvy home-based businesspeople 
do when they start their businesses is hire a tax lawyer, certified public 
accountant (CPA), or both to help them plan and file their taxes? For many 
home-based business owners, the investment in a good tax planner can pay 
off many times over as the business grows and evolves.

Part II: Managing Your Money 
This chapter is all about taxes: who pays them, when to pay them, and how 
much to pay. And although our intent isn’t to make you an expert on the sub­
ject of taxes (we don’t want to put any accountants out of business), we do 
want to provide you with a basic understanding of the topic — enough to help 
you get your business started and talk intelligently with any tax professionals.
Knowing Which Taxes to Pay — 
and When to Pay Them
Just like any other business, home-based businesses are required to pay 
income tax to the federal, state, and — in some cases — city government in 
which the business is located. The forms you use to calculate and file your 
taxes and the kinds of expenses you’re able to deduct depend on the form of 
business you select: sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability com­
pany, subchapter S corporation, or regular corporation (see Chapter 10 for 
details about each of these business forms). And although home-based busi­
nesses are granted some special tax breaks by the government — unless you 
have some amazing tax deductions or you’re not making any money — you’re 
still going to have to pay at least some tax.
Who has to pay what?
Within the United States, all businesses are required to file an annual income 
tax return. Whether you make money or lose money, you still need to file a 
return.
Of course, we’re assuming that your business is really a business and not 
just a hobby. Suppose, for example, that you’re an avid collector of Star Wars 
figures, and you buy and sell them on a regular basis. Not only that, but you 
also take a home-office deduction and write off other business expenses — 
but you don’t conduct this activity on a businesslike basis (that is, to make 
a profit). In this case, the IRS doesn’t allow you to deduct all your expenses 
as business expenses — including the all-important home-office deduc­
tion (more about this deduction in the “Taking a Look at the Home-Office 
Deduction” section). If you’ve been taking these deductions for years, get 
audited by the IRS, and find out that these deductions aren’t allowed, the 
financial impact on you and your “business” can be more than simply incon­
venient — it can be devastating.

187
 Chapter 9: Getting a Grip on Taxes and Deductions
Adhering to the hobby loss rule
Aside from the freedom that having one’s own home business can provide, 
one of the main reasons for starting a home-based business is for the finan­
cial benefits — including taxes. If you want to benefit from the tax deductions 
and other advantages that having your own home-based business affords 
you (which can be considerable), it’s in your interest for the IRS to agree that 
indeed you’re operating a business and not a hobby.
And believe us, the IRS is on the lookout for businesses — home based and 
otherwise — that are incorrectly applying the rules. According to a Treasury 
Inspector General for Tax Administration audit report (titled “Significant 
Challenges Exist in Determining Whether Taxpayers with Schedule C Losses 
Are Engaged in Tax Abuse”):
About 1.5 million taxpayers, many with significant income from other 
sources, filed Form 1040 Schedule C showing no profits, only losses, 
over consecutive Tax Years 2002–2005 (4 years); 73 percent of these 
taxpayers were assisted by tax practitioners. By claiming these losses 
to reduce their taxable incomes, about 1.2 million of the 1.5 million tax­
payers potentially avoided paying $2.8 billion in taxes in Tax Year 2005. 
Changes are needed to prevent taxpayers from continually deducting 
losses in potentially not-for-profit activities to reduce their tax liabilities.
Web sites that can make your job less taxing
While Congress continues to mystify the tax 
codes, the Internet does just the opposite. 
In response to popular taxpayer demand, a 
number of Web sites have sprung up to dis­
pense help and assistance. These sites work 
hard to take the mystery out of preparing your 
income taxes. Here are some of the best ones:

Part II: Managing Your Money 
	
According to research studies, if you work for yourself, the odds are four 
times greater that you will be audited than if you work for someone else. And 
if you gross more than $100,000 a year, the chances you will be audited go up 
even more.
So how do you know whether your enterprise is a business or a hobby? The 
place to start is a law established by Congress called the hobby loss rule. In 
essence, the hobby loss rule says that to be considered a business rather 
than a hobby, your activity must have made a profit in at least three of the 
preceding five years. If your business is a new one — without an established 
track record of profit — or if it’s truly an unprofitable business, it may still 
qualify as a business instead of a hobby. It just has to meet a few require­
ments first.
To help you decide which side of the fence your business is on, the IRS has 
established nine factors, which are contained within Internal Revenue Code 
Section 183. According to the IRS, no single factor is more important than any 
of the others, and you don’t necessarily have to satisfy all these criteria to be 
considered a business. But you can bet that the more you satisfy, the better 
position you’ll be in if an IRS agent comes knocking on your door. The nine 
factors are
	
✓	The manner in which the taxpayer carries on the activity: If your busi­
ness is really a business, it should conduct itself like a business, not 
a hobby. For example, a business establishes accounting records and 
develops business plans and strategies. It obtains a business license and 
adheres to any zoning or other legal requirements. It establishes finan­
cial goals, abandons strategies that don’t help it achieve its goals, and 
constantly seeks out and executes new strategies that help it achieve its 
goals. It strives to make a profit and avoids financial losses. The owner 
establishes systems and resources dedicated to the business, such as 
dedicated computers and phone lines, Internet connections, an office, 
office equipment and supplies, a business logo or trademark, stationery, 
and business cards.
	
✓	The expertise of the taxpayer or his or her advisers: The knowledge 
and expertise that a home-based businessperson has in running his 
or her particular line of business can be a significant factor in decid­
ing whether a particular activity is a business or a hobby. In fact, a 
person’s knowledge or effort in managing a successful enterprise has 
been considered by the courts in several cases. Similarly, a home-based 
businessperson who retains an accountant, a lawyer, and other experts 
to provide business advice tends to indicate that the activity is indeed a 
business and not a hobby.
	
✓	The time and effort expended by the taxpayer in carrying on the activ­
ity: Although the IRS doesn’t expect you to spend every waking hour 
working in your home-based business, it does expect you to show some 
sort of serious personal commitment of your own time and effort on 

189
 Chapter 9: Getting a Grip on Taxes and Deductions
behalf of the business. If, for example, you develop, create, and deliver 
all your business’s products or services, and doing so takes an average 
of 20 hours a week to accomplish, you clearly have a major commitment 
of time and effort. On the other hand, devoting two minutes a week to 
these activities likely wouldn’t qualify in the eyes of the IRS. If you quit 
another job or go to part-time status so that you can devote even more 
energy to your new venture, you’re clearly making a serious investment 
of time and effort in your activity.
	
✓	The expectation that the assets used in the activity may appreciate 
in value: Every business has assets, some more valuable than others. 
And although some business assets — such as computers, printers, and 
vehicles — tend to decrease in value over time, other assets — such as 
real estate and intellectual property — tend to increase over time. Most 
businesses start out in a loss position, so even if the activity isn’t making 
a profit at the time, a new home-based business owner can demonstrate 
that he or she expects the company’s key assets to appreciate, indicat­
ing that the activity is a business, not a hobby.
	
✓	The success of the taxpayer in carrying on other similar or dissimilar 
activities: A home-based businessperson may have a personal history of 
establishing a number of businesses that are initially unprofitable, but 
which he or she then shepherds into operations that are both profitable 
and successful. A track record like this can go a long way to convincing 
an outside observer that a particular activity is truly a business even if it 
isn’t profitable yet.
	
✓	The taxpayer’s history of income or loss with respect to the activity: 
If your activity is generating a profit, it’s clearly a profit-making activity. 
The fact that an activity doesn’t generate profits, however, doesn’t nec­
essarily mean it isn’t engaged in for-profit activities. The first years of a 
business can be a time of building and securing assets that the business 
needs to operate effectively. After these expenses are paid and revenues 
begin to climb, the activity should begin to show a profit. In some cases, 
extraordinary situations, such as the loss of a major client or the death 
of a principal in the business, may push the business into unprofitability 
for a period of time. Such explanations may help show that the activity 
is a business. Years and years of activity with no profit to show for it, 
however, may indicate that the activity is indeed a hobby and not a busi­
ness for tax purposes.
	
✓	The amount of occasional profits, if any, that are earned: It’s not 
enough to simply make a dollar or two profit in three years out of five. 
The amount of the profit made has to be reasonably significant. So, for 
example, a home-based business that shows a profit of $10,000 in each 
of three years out of five will likely have no problem whatsoever estab­
lishing itself as a business. A home-based business that shows only $10 
profit in each of three years out of five may have a serious problem 
defending its status as a business rather than a hobby.

190
Part II: Managing Your Money 
	
✓	The financial status of the taxpayer: Are you earning most of your 
money from your home-based business or are you earning most of your 
money from another source, perhaps a regular full-time job? If most of 
your income comes from your home-based activity, you greatly enhance 
your case that the activity is a business. If, however, most of your income 
comes from another source, you’ll have a harder time proving that your 
home-based activity is actually a real, live business and not just a hobby.
	
✓	Elements of personal pleasure or recreation: Do you carry out the 
activity purely for recreation or personal pleasure, or is it intended to 
generate a profit? Peter, for example, loves to write. As much as Peter 
loves to write, however, his overriding concern (aside from doing the 
best job of writing that he possibly can) is to make a good living doing 
it. So in Peter’s case, making a profit overrides Peter’s joy of writing. The 
IRS says that it’s okay to enjoy what you’re doing for a living, as long as 
your primary focus is on making a profit doing it.
So if you’re absolutely sure your home-based business is really a business, 
take a close look at your business — and at your personal motivations in 
creating your business — to see what you need to change to make it more a 
business and less a hobby in the eyes of the IRS.
Different tax forms for different business forms
The forms you need to submit when you file your taxes are different depend­
ing on what form of business your home-based business takes (and how 
many people you employ). It’s easy to get lost in the many different forms 
and schedules available for you to use when calculating and filing your 
taxes (which is another reason why you should seriously consider hiring an 
accountant or CPA to help you with your company’s finances).
Table 9-1 gives you a summary of the kinds of taxes you may have to pay and 
the forms you need to use to pay them.

The one form of business that isn’t listed in Table 9-1 that you need to be 
aware of is the limited liability company (LLC). LLCs are created under state 
law. For tax purposes, LLCs default to general partnerships, and the rules 
and taxes for partnerships apply. However, you can also elect to file as a C 
corporation, S corporation, or a sole proprietor; whichever form you choose 
to file as, file all the tax forms that apply to that particular business form. 
Remember that each state has its own rules for limited liability companies — 
be sure to check out your state’s unique tax rules before filing your state 
income taxes.
When do you have to pay?
As the IRS loves to remind the self-employed, the federal income tax is a 
pay-as-you-go system — in other words, you should be paying your taxes at 
roughly the same time you’re making your income.
When you’re an employee working in a regular job, the process is relatively 
painless. Your employer deducts a fixed amount of money from your pay­
checks — before you even get them. When you start your own home-based 
business, however, you need to plan to pay estimated taxes four times a year, 
on April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15. (Corporate estimated 
taxes are due on the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 12th months during the 

192
Part II: Managing Your Money 
company’s fiscal year.) If you mail your payments, be sure your envelope is 
postmarked no later than these dates. After you start making your estimated 
payments — and writing the big checks to the federal government that go 
along with them — you’ll surely long for the time when your employer took a 
little out of each paycheck.
The rules for paying estimated taxes are different for the different forms of 
business. Here’s a brief summary of the differences:
	
✓	Sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders: If you 
expect to owe taxes of $1,000 or more when you file your income tax 
return, you probably need to make estimated payments to the federal 
government. Use Form 1040-ES — Estimated Tax for Individuals — to 
determine how much to pay and then to submit your payment.
	
✓	Corporations: If you expect to owe taxes of $500 or more when you file 
your tax return, you probably need to make estimated payments to the fed­
eral government. Use Form 1120-W — Estimated Tax for Corporations — 
to determine how much to pay and then to submit your payment.
Of course, the day of reckoning for most home-based businesses comes 
each year on the same day that it does for individual taxpayers: April 15. 
(Corporations have a slightly different arrangement; corporate federal tax 
returns are due on the 15th day of the 3rd month after the close of the com­
pany’s fiscal year, or March 15 for a fiscal year that ends on December 31.) 
This due date is the day that you submit your tax return for the preceding 
year and the day that you write out one more check to pay the IRS for tax 
shortfalls that weren’t already covered in your estimated payments (and 
the day you celebrate if you have money coming back because you overpaid 
your estimated payments).
How much do you have to pay?
How much you have to pay in taxes is the $64 question (or, perhaps, more 
like the $6,400 or the $64,000 question, depending on your situation). Every 
business is different, and every business has its own unique tax situation. 
One thing is for certain, though: The kind of business entity your business is 
has a definite bearing on the amount of taxes you pay.
If your home-based business is a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a 
subchapter S corporation, your taxable business income will be combined 
with any other source of income and taxed at the individual level on your 
Form 1040. At the time of this writing, the current individual tax rates range 
from 10 percent to 35 percent. C corporation tax rates range from 15 per­
cent to 39 percent. The tax on the first $75,000 of taxable income is in the 

193
 Chapter 9: Getting a Grip on Taxes and Deductions
same neighborhood for both individuals and corporations. Generally speak­
ing, however, corporate tax far exceeds individual tax after income is above 
the $75,000 mark.
A corporation is a separate tax-paying entity unless it elects to take advan­
tage of subchapter S of the tax code. C corporations pay taxes at corporate 
rates. Choosing to use subchapter S enables you to not pay separate (federal) 
taxes, which means that you show the corporation’s income on your 1040. 
However, in doing so, some tax deductions available to corporations are lost. 
Corporations can be started as S and changed to a C later or can have their S 
status revoked. A corporation is considered a C corporation unless subchap­
ter S is elected.
C corporations aren’t allowed to take a home-office deduction because a cor­
poration can’t have a home; it can have only a business location. Ten-percent 
shareholders can’t rent their homes to the corporation, either. However, an 
employee and/or shareholder can submit a reimbursement request for use of 
their home. You need to consider many ramifications in choosing the proper 
business entity and how it relates to deductible home offices and reimburse­
ments to the owner. We strongly suggest you seek out the services of a pro­
fessional tax advisor before you make your final decision. (See Chapter 10 for 
more details about the different business forms.)
What if you can’t afford to pay right now?
When your business gets into full swing — and you start bringing in a lot 
more income — you may be surprised just how much extra income tax you’ll 
owe on April 15. You may be especially shocked if you’re not using a CPA to 
keep an eye on your finances and to warn you that you should start putting 
aside some cash for just such an outcome.
So what should you do if you can’t afford to pay the income taxes you owe? 
One option is to submit a request for an automatic six-month extension of the 
date to file your taxes to October 15 by using the government’s e-file system 
(www.irs.gov/efile) or by mailing Form 4868.
	
If you can’t raise the money you need by tapping your savings or other 
resources, you can apply to the IRS for an installment agreement using Form 
9465. According to the rules, the IRS must accept installment payments if you 
owe less than $10,000, you’ve paid your taxes on time for the past five years, 
and you propose to pay off your balance within three years. You will, of 
course, be charged interest on the unpaid balance. However, setting up this 
arrangement may mean the difference between sinking and swimming.

Part II: Managing Your Money 
When is an independent contractor 
not an independent contractor?
Imagine that you’ve started your own home-based business and you’re start­
ing to deliver services — say, interior design — to a client. Chances are you 
consider yourself to be a business separate from your client’s business — in 
other words, an independent contractor. But what if we told you there’s a pos­
sibility that the IRS may not agree with your particular view of your business 
and that the IRS may instead decide that you’re performing your services as 
an employee? “Okay, that’s interesting,” you may say to yourself, “but what’s 
the big deal?”
	
You may be in for an unpleasant surprise if you think you’re a home-based 
business — and take advantage of all the deductions for business expenses 
that you’re entitled to — if the IRS decides that you’re really an employee of 
your client. This unpleasant surprise includes disallowing all the deductions 
you’ve been taking for your home-based business and recalculating your taxes 
without them — possibly resulting in a substantial amount of money (plus 
penalties and interest) now owed to the IRS. Believe us, this is one surprise 
everyone could do without. The good news is that you can take a few steps 
right now to ensure that you’re not surprised come tax day.
Hiring yourself out
Q: I’m a computer contractor working within 
a niche in a specific software package. Few 
people in this locale are qualified to work with 
this application and even fewer have experi­
ence with this package. So my competition is 
essentially the manufacturer of the software. 
The company knows who I am and wants to 
subcontract with me, if not hire me. Because 
of its business practices, however, I’d prefer 
not to represent this company, even though I’d 
actually make more money subbing out to it. My 
problem is finding potential clients and key con­
tacts without this company’s help. Do you have 
any suggestions?
A: You’re wise not to become encumbered with 
a company with poor business practices. Life is 
too short and litigation too costly. Can you work 
out something other than a subcontracting 
relationship with this company — for example, 
a referral relationship through which you pay a 
referral fee? You can make clear to your clients 
that your relationship with the company is lim­
ited to its referring clients to you. Alternatively, 
can you rent the company’s mailing list? From 
this, you can do mailings (snail or e-mail), 
create a newsletter, embellish a Web site, and 
so on. If a publication already exists for these 
users, can you contribute articles, a column, or 
letters to the editor? If the company is a poor 
one to work with, customers will gladly want to 
know about you as an alternative. Just be sure 
not to bad-mouth the company.

195
 Chapter 9: Getting a Grip on Taxes and Deductions
In its ongoing quest to be helpful, the IRS has developed guidelines to help 
you determine whether you’re an independent contractor or an employee. 
These guidelines are categorized by how much behavioral and financial con­
trol a business has over the person doing the work and the exact nature of 
the relationship. Here are the IRS’s independent contractor guidelines, pre­
sented as they currently appear in Publication 15-A: Employer’s Supplemental 
Tax Guide:
	
✓	Behavioral control: Facts that show whether the business has a right to 
direct and control how the worker does the task for which the worker is 
hired include the type and degree of the following:
 
• Instructions that the business gives to the worker: An employee 
is generally subject to the business’s instructions about when, 
where, and how to work. All the following are examples of types of 
instructions about how to do work:
	
	When and where to do the work
	
	What tools or equipment to use
	
	What workers to hire or assist with the work
	
	Where to purchase supplies and services
	
	What work must be performed by a specified individual
	
	What order or sequence to follow
	
	The amount of instruction needed varies among different jobs. 
Even if no instructions are given, sufficient behavioral control may 
exist if the employer has the right to control how the work results 
are achieved. A business may lack the knowledge to instruct some 
highly specialized professionals; in other cases, the task may 
require little or no instruction. The key consideration is whether 
the business has retained the right to control the details of a work­
er’s performance or instead has given up that right.
 
• Training that the business gives to the worker: An employee may 
be trained to perform services in a particular manner. Independent 
contractors ordinarily use their own methods.
	
✓	Financial control: Facts that show whether the business has a right to 
control the business aspects of the worker’s job include:
 
• The extent to which the worker has unreimbursed business 
expenses: Independent contractors are more likely to have unreim­
bursed expenses than are employees. Fixed, ongoing costs that are 
incurred regardless of whether work is currently being performed 
are especially important. However, employees may also incur 
unreimbursed expenses in connection with the services that they 
perform for their business.

196
Part II: Managing Your Money 
 
• The extent of the worker’s investment: An independent contrac­
tor often has a significant investment in the facilities he or she 
uses to perform services for someone else. However, a significant 
investment isn’t necessary for independent contractor status.
 
• The extent to which the worker makes his or her services 
available to the relevant market: An independent contractor is 
generally free to seek out business opportunities. Independent 
contractors often advertise, maintain a visible business location, 
and are available to work in the relevant market.
 
• How the business pays the worker: An employee is generally 
guaranteed a regular wage amount for an hourly, weekly, or other 
period of time. This guaranteed wage usually indicates that a 
worker is an employee, even when the wage or salary is supple­
mented by a commission. An independent contractor is usually 
paid a flat fee for the job. However, it’s common in some profes­
sions, such as law, to pay independent contractors hourly.
 
• The extent to which the worker can realize a profit or incur 
a loss: An independent contractor can make a profit or loss. An 
employee can’t.
	
✓	Type of relationship: Facts that show the parties’ type of relationship 
include:
 
• Written contracts describing the relationship the parties 
intended to create: Independent contractors typically use con­
tracts to create business relationships with clients; employees, on 
the other hand, don’t typically use contracts to create business 
relationships with their employers.
 
• The extent to which benefits are involved: If the business provides 
the worker with employee-type benefits, such as insurance, a 
pension plan, vacation pay, or sick pay, it’s most likely an employer-
employee relationship. If no such benefits are involved, it’s most 
likely an independent contractor-client relationship. While employ­
ees are often provided with benefits by their employer, indepen­
dent contractors generally have to provide their own.
 
• The permanency of the relationship: Engaging a worker with the 
expectation that the relationship will continue indefinitely, instead 
of for a specific project or period, is generally considered evidence 
that you intended to create an employer-employee relationship.
 
• The extent to which services performed by the worker are a 
key aspect of the regular business of the company: If a worker 
provides services that are a key aspect of your regular business 
activity, you’re more likely to have the right to direct and control 

197
 Chapter 9: Getting a Grip on Taxes and Deductions
his or her activities. For example, if a law firm hires an attorney, 
it will likely present the attorney’s work as its own and have the 
right to control or direct that work. This arrangement indicates an 
employer-employee relationship.
The lines that separate independent contractors from employees can be 
blurry. Here are a couple of examples that the IRS itself uses to illustrate 
the problem. Review the following examples, and see who you think is an 
employee and who is an independent contractor:
	
✓	Steve Smith, a computer programmer, is laid off when Megabyte, Inc., 
downsizes. Megabyte agrees to pay Steve a flat amount to complete a 
one-time project to create a certain product. It isn’t clear how long it will 
take to complete the project, and Steve isn’t guaranteed any minimum 
payment for the hours spent on the program. Megabyte provides Steve 
with no instructions beyond the specifications for the product itself. 
Steve and Megabyte have a written contract, which provides that Steve 
is considered to be an independent contractor, is required to pay federal 
and state taxes, and receives no benefits from Megabyte. Megabyte will 
file a Form 1099-MISC. Steve does the work on a new high-end computer 
that cost him $7,000. Steve works at home and isn’t expected or allowed 
to attend meetings of the software development group. Employee or 
independent contractor?
	
✓	Jerry Jones has an agreement with Wilma White to supervise the remod­
eling of her house. She didn’t advance funds to help him carry on the 
work. She makes direct payments to the suppliers for all necessary 
materials. She carries liability and workers’ compensation insurance 
covering Jerry and others that he engaged to assist him. She pays them 
an hourly rate and exercises almost constant supervision over the work. 
Jerry isn’t free to transfer his assistants to other jobs. He may not work 
on other jobs while working for Wilma. He assumes no responsibility to 
complete the work and will incur no contractual liability if he fails to do 
so. He and his assistants perform personal services for hourly wages. 
Employee or independent contractor?
What did you guess? According to the IRS, Steve Smith is an independent 
contractor, and Jerry Jones and his assistants are employees.
	
Be constantly aware of how you do business, and guard against conducting 
business in a way that would cause the IRS to believe that you’re actually an 
employee instead of an independent contractor. The differences are often 
subtle, and the line between them is easy to cross. With a bit of forethought 
and planning, however, you can always make sure that you’re on the right side 
of that line.

Part II: Managing Your Money 
Taking a Look at the Home-Office 
Deduction
For many home-based businesspeople, taking the home-office deduction is a 
major financial incentive to start their businesses in the first place, and it can 
have a significant and positive effect on a home-based business’s financial 
position (as well as the personal financial situation of the owner). In more 
than a few cases, the ability to take the home-office deduction literally means 
the difference between success and failure.
The beauty of the home-office deduction is that it allows you to deduct the 
costs of operating and maintaining the part of your home that you use for 
business. And it doesn’t matter what kind of home you live in. Whether you 
live in a single-family home, a condominium, a commercial building, or even a 
houseboat, if you meet the IRS’s criteria for the home-office deduction, you’re 
eligible to take it.
	
To qualify to deduct expenses for the business use of your home, you must 
use part of your home in one of the following ways:
	
✓	Exclusively and regularly as your principal place of business
	
✓	Exclusively and regularly as a place where you meet or deal with 
patients, clients, or customers in the normal course of your trade or 
business
	
✓	In connection with your trade or business in the case of a separate 
structure that isn’t attached to your home
	
✓	For rental use
	
✓	As a daycare facility
Note: Two exceptions to the exclusive-use test are (1) if you use part of your 
home for the storage of inventory or product samples and (2) if you use part 
of your home as a daycare facility. In other words, the part of your home 
you devote (and deduct) for your rental or daycare home business doesn’t 
have to be exclusively used for those purposes to qualify for the home-office 
deduction.
So assuming you meet these criteria, you can take the home-office deduc­
tion. The benefits of doing so are immediate and extensive. Not only are you 
allowed to deduct your normal business expenses (paper, pencils, phone 
calls, and so on), but you’re also able to deduct a portion of the indirect 
expenses related to your entire home! Here are some of the most common 
indirect expenses that you may be able to at least partially deduct under the 
IRS’s home-office rules:

199
 Chapter 9: Getting a Grip on Taxes and Deductions
	
✓	Rent
	
✓	Mortgage interest
	
✓	Security system
	
✓	Housekeeping
	
✓	Household supplies
	
✓	Condominium association fees
	
✓	Trash collection
	
✓	Utilities (gas, electric, and so on)
To determine the total amount of indirect expenses that you can deduct 
under the home-office deduction, you first have to calculate the percentage 
of your home devoted to your home office. So, for example, suppose you 
have a 240-square-foot spare bedroom (12 x 20 feet) that you’ve set aside as 
a home office and that the total square footage of your home is 1,200 square 
feet. Here’s how to determine the portion of your indirect expenses that you 
can deduct with your home-office deduction:
240 sq. ft. office ÷ 1,200 sq. ft. home = Percent of expenses deductible
240 ÷ 1,200 = 20 percent
You can, therefore, deduct 20 percent of your home’s indirect expenses — an 
amount that, depending on your situation, may be quite substantial. Keep in 
mind, though, that the tax rules don’t allow you to deduct an amount greater 
than the amount of gross income that you earn in your home-based business. 
The government doesn’t mind if you make money from individuals and other 
companies, but it doesn’t want you to make money off the IRS.
	
Be aware that if you take the home-office deduction, you’re required to depre­
ciate the home-office square footage of your home. When you sell your home, 
you have to reduce your cost basis by the amount of depreciation deducted. 
When you sell a home that you lived in for more than two years, you can 
exclude $250,000 (or $500,000 on a joint return) of your gain. The gain is a cap­
ital gain eligible for reduced preferential rates, which are taxed at a maximum 
rate of 15 percent. However, as a home-office deductor, you have to do one 
more calculation: You have to subtract from the capital gain the amount of 
depreciation taken and pay tax at a maximum rate of 25 percent. This calcula­
tion is known as depreciation recapture.
It’s widely believed that taking the home-office deduction waves a red flag that 
can gain you extra scrutiny by the IRS — and perhaps an audit. Although we 
don’t know whether this belief is really true, we do know that you should con­
sult with an accountant, tax planner, or other tax professional before you take 
the home-office deduction. The rules are complicated, and the penalties for 

200
Part II: Managing Your Money 
abusing the deduction can be significant. For more information on the allow­
ability of deductions for your home-based business, check out IRS Publication 
587: Business Use of Your Home at the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov/pub/irs-
pdf/p587.pdf).
Reviewing Other Important 
Tax Deductions
Aside from the important home-office deduction, home-based businesses are 
allowed to deduct a wide variety of other business expenses from their taxes. 
To be deductible, the Internal Revenue Code specifies that expenses must 
be ordinary and necessary for the operation of your business. So although 
the purchase of a vintage 1959 sunburst Gibson Les Paul electric guitar for 
$250,000 may be ordinary and necessary (and thus an allowable deduction) 
for a professional musician, it likely wouldn’t fly for a home-based software 
designer — in fact, it would surely sink like a lead balloon.
As you may imagine, you can legally deduct many different expenses from 
your taxes as a home-based business owner. Here are just a few examples of 
legal deductions:
	
✓	Phones
	
✓	Utilities
	
✓	Postage
	
✓	Health insurance
	
✓	Auto expenses
	
✓	Internet access
	
✓	Business travel
	
✓	Business meals and entertainment
	
✓	Professional services and consultants
	
✓	Business cards and stationery
	
✓	Retirement plans
	
✓	Interest payments on business credit cards
	
✓	Education
	
✓	Office supplies
	
✓	Office furniture

201
 Chapter 9: Getting a Grip on Taxes and Deductions
As you may also imagine, the federal government has determined plenty of 
expenses that aren’t deductible. Too bad! Here are a number of deductions 
that the IRS doesn’t consider legal:
	
✓	Anticipated liabilities
	
✓	Bribes and kickbacks
	
✓	Demolition expenses
	
✓	Personal expenses
	
✓	Social or recreational clubs
	
✓	Lobbying expenses
	
✓	Political contributions
	
✓	Federal income taxes
	
✓	Penalties and fines
	
When in doubt, consult with an accountant or tax advisor to see which 
expenses you’re allowed to deduct and which ones you aren’t. It’s far better to 
be sure about your allowable deductions before you take them instead of 
years later when your business expenses are disallowed by the IRS.
	
Be sure when setting up your business that you apply for and obtain a busi­
ness license. If you’re doing a DBA (“doing business as”), you need to register 
your name with the city — which is part of the business license application. 
Failure to obtain a business license can be a very costly mistake. For more 
information on business licenses, be sure to take a look at Chapter 10.
Discovering Often Overlooked 
Ways to Save On Your Taxes
As you’re probably well aware, the rules that govern income taxes and the 
deductions you’re allowed to take are complex. But despite appearances to 
the contrary, you’re not required to pay any more tax than is necessary. In 
fact, you shouldn’t pay any more tax than you’re legally required to pay.
	
Because of the complexity of the tax rules and the fact that they change — 
sometimes substantially — every year, hiring a professional tax lawyer or 
accountant can really pay off, and it’s deductible, too.

202
Part II: Managing Your Money 
However, we understand if you’d prefer not to spend a lot of money paying 
for a tax lawyer or accountant just yet. You can still employ a variety of strat­
egies to reduce your tax burden. Consider the following ways to save on your 
taxes that sometimes get overlooked:
	
✓	Maximize your vehicle deduction. You can choose between the stan­
dard mileage deduction (55 cents per mile in 2009) or the actual costs 
of operating your vehicle, which includes fuel, maintenance, taxes, 
and license fees. Where you live can determine whether choosing to 
use the standard deduction will save you more money than reporting 
actual costs. Runzheimer International (www.runzheimer.com), which 
analyzes the cost of owning and operating a vehicle in cities across the 
United States, found that it costs almost twice as much to operate a mid-
size vehicle in Detroit than it does in Portland, Oregon. So taking the 
standard deduction may make more sense in Detroit, Los Angeles, and 
other higher cost places than it does in Portland and other lower-cost 
places. Note, however, that if you use the actual cost method in the first 
year you use a vehicle, you must stick with this method ever after. And 
unless you use a vehicle 100 percent for business, you need to keep a 
log of your business use, including dates, mileage, and the purpose of 
your business travels.
	
✓	Make the most of hiring employees. If you need an employee, consider 
hiring a family member. A child in a lower tax bracket enables you to 
keep income in the family. Depending on how much the child earns, no 
tax at all may be owed on his or her earnings. Sometimes tax credits are 
available for hiring designated workers, such as Native Americans, or if 
you live in an economic empowerment zone.
	
✓	Reduce your taxes with a retirement plan. Putting money into a retire­
ment fund reduces your Adjusted Gross Income, which is what you use 
to calculate other deductions, such as a casualty loss, medical, and 
miscellaneous itemized deductions. The self-employed are able to invest 
more money using a Keogh, SEP, or SIMPLE plan than with an IRA. To 
find out more about retirement plans for the self-employed, obtain IRS 
Publication 560 (www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p560.pdf) and be sure 
to check out Chapter 8.
	
✓	Make the most of a bad year. Because it’s possible to carry business 
losses both back as well as forward, consult a tax professional to deter­
mine whether you would be better off getting an immediate tax refund 
or carrying your loss into your next business year. Keep in mind that the 
tax law on handling losses changes frequently.
	
Of course, it’s against the law to evade paying your taxes, but it’s your duty to 
avoid paying more taxes than you’re legally obligated to. The IRS isn’t going to 
give you any gold stars or special privileges for paying more taxes than you 
have to — you’re throwing away your money if you do. And that’s the last 
thing any home-based businessperson should ever do.

 Chapter 9: Getting a Grip on Taxes and Deductions
The Ins and Outs of Sales Tax
According to the people who keep track of such things as sales tax, there 
are more than 10,000 different sales tax rates nationwide, and these rates 
are in a constant state of change as voters approve rate changes to fund 
local improvements or scale down sales taxes to save the consumer a bit of 
money. But although sales taxes are in a constant state of change, one thing’s 
for sure: If you sell products or provide certain kinds of services to people 
within your state (the exact services taxed differ from state to state — check 
with your local tax authorities to find out whether or not the services you 
offer are subject to sales tax), you better be sure to collect sales tax while 
you’re at it.
As of this writing, only five states — Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New 
Hampshire, and Oregon — don’t have sales taxes. All other states do, and 
they expect you to collect each and every dollar and cent owed and then to 
submit them to the appropriate tax authorities regularly.
Here’s how the sales tax setup and collection process generally works:
	
1.	File an application with your state sales tax authority to obtain a 
reseller’s permit, also known as a certificate of authority, sales tax 
permit, resale permit, or sales tax number, depending on the state in 
which you reside.
	
2.	File appropriate sales tax forms with your state or local tax authori­
ties, with estimated collections for quarter or year (or whatever 
period of time is requested).
	
3.	Receive instructions from state or local tax authorities with informa­
tion on how often to submit tax collections and where to send them.
	
4.	Submit taxes at the time and place directed by the state or local tax 
authorities.
Tax software to the rescue
When home-based businesspeople prepare 
their taxes, they have two key options: pay 
someone to do them or do the taxes them­
selves. If you decide to do your own taxes, 
you may find that tax software makes the pro­
cess much easier and far more accurate than 
filling out forms the old-fashioned way. Here 
are a couple of reliable tax software packages 
to consider:
	✓	TaxCut: www.taxcut.com
	✓	TurboTax: www.turbotax.com

204
Part II: Managing Your Money 
Although the collection of sales taxes is a fairly routine and straightforward 
process (perhaps even boring), one thing that has brought a lot of excite­
ment to the topic is the ongoing debate over collecting sales taxes for prod­
ucts sold over the Internet. Congress has temporarily exempted Internet 
sales from the payment of sales taxes, much to the delight of e-commerce 
firms, such as Amazon.com and others, but much to the consternation of the 
states that can’t collect the sales tax revenue that’s increasingly being lost to 
online sales. Although online companies still have to collect sales taxes for 
sales made within their home states, just as mail-order companies do, they 
don’t have to collect sales taxes for sales made to people or companies out­
side their states.

S
tarting a business is far more than just hanging an 
“Open” sign on your door. You have to create a foun­

most common legal do’s and don’ts and explore how to 
leverage outside resources to your advantage. Finally, we 
take an in-depth look at the many different kinds of home-
based business rip-offs and scams — and explain how to

I
f you think you have enough laws, statutes, and regulations to worry 
about now, just wait until you start your own business — you haven’t 
seen anything, yet! Actually, it’s not quite that bad, but depending on what 
kind of home-based business you plan to start, you may be surprised to see 
how many city and local agencies and departments want to play some role in 
your life and how many rules and regulations you have to comply with.
And the government isn’t the only player you have to take into account. Your 
own neighborhood or housing development may have restrictive covenants 
(that you agreed to honor when you bought your house, whether or not you 
noticed them in the fine print of your purchase agreement) that determine 
whether you can run a business out of your home. You’re wise to pay atten­
tion to all these covenants and regulations: The consequences of not doing 
so include fines, penalties, and even closure of your precious home-based 
business.
	
Laws and regulations determine where you can locate your home-based busi­
ness and during what hours you can operate it. They also require you to get 
permits if your business prepares and sells food or if you have an alarm to 
protect your premises. And if you’re a private investigator, hairdresser, mas­
seuse, building contractor, plumber, or any of hundreds more occupations, 
you need a license (and you need to pay a licensing fee) before you can oper­
ate your business.

208
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
To some degree, the government determines which kind of business form or 
legal structure (sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, 
or corporation) you’re eligible to use; plus, it decides the financial and tax 
implications on your business as a result of which form you use.
In this chapter, we discuss a wide variety of legal issues that every home-
based business owner faces, including how to choose the legal structure that’s 
right for your business, how to select and register a company name, and how 
to consider the potential impact of zoning, licensing, and permits on your 
business. We also take a look at trademarks, copyrights, and patents and how 
they may affect your business. Finally, we briefly visit the potential impact of 
tax considerations on your home-based business (see Chapter 9 for the com­
plete lowdown on taxes).
Our aim isn’t to turn you into a lawyer or an accountant (not that we have 
anything against lawyers or accountants) but to arm you with enough knowl­
edge to take care of the basics and to know where to turn when you need 
more information.
Understanding the Major Business Forms
One of the first decisions you have to make after you decide to start your own 
home-based business is what form of business — that is, what legal structure — 
it will take.
You may have noticed a few interesting words or initials after the names 
of some of your favorite companies. Global fast-food giant McDonald’s, for 
example, isn’t simply named McDonald’s — it’s McDonald’s Corporation — 
which means that McDonald’s is organized as a corporation form of business. 
Quiznos Master LLC — the number-two sub sandwich chain in the United 
States after Subway — is organized as a limited liability company.
	
Each of the different forms of business (and its accompanying alphabet soup 
of letters) comes with a wide variety of legal implications for many facets of 
your business, including legal liability in case of lawsuit, taxes, and more. It’s 
important, therefore, that you take time to understand all these implications 
upfront — as you make and implement your business plans.
	
Which form of business is right for you? This section gives you some basic 
guidelines to consider as you weigh the different options available to you. 
Although these guidelines are certainly sufficient to help you get your busi­
ness off the ground and to help you become an informed home-business 
owner, our advice is to first contact an attorney or accountant to discern the 
specific advantages and legal requirements of each form of business and then 
to decide which is best for you. The money you save over the years will prob­
ably pay for this advice many times over.

209
 Chapter 10: Knowing Your Legal Do’s and Don’ts
Consider the following issues when you’re deciding which form of business 
to use for your home-based business:
	
✓	The impact on your business’s image
	
✓	The impact of planned business growth
	
✓	The cost to start up your business
	
✓	The cost to maintain your business
	
✓	Your tax goals
	
✓	The impact of government regulation
	
✓	Your financing needs
	
✓	The amount of personal legal risk you’re willing to take for your business
In the sections that follow, we consider the four major forms of business, 
discussing the pros and cons of each one for home-based businesses. As you 
review each form, think about the kind of business you want to run — not 
just today, but years into the future.
We know it may be difficult to picture what your business will be like a 
couple of weeks into the future, much less a couple of months or a couple 
of years. The good news is that you can change the form of your business 
almost any time you want with a minimum of muss or fuss (corporations are 
the exception here because they require the filing of special forms with your 
state government). But try to picture where your business may go, anyway; 
settling now on a form that will carry your business for many years into the 
future may be easier in the long run.
Surveying sole proprietorships
By far, the vast majority of home-based businesses are sole proprietorships, 
which means they have only one business owner — in your case, that one 
owner is you. You’re the boss, the leader, the one to congratulate when the 
business does well and the one to blame when the business does badly.
In a sole proprietorship, you report the income you derive from your business 
on your Form 1040 along with any other personal income you make during 
the course of the year — in other words, you don’t need to file a separate tax 
return for your business. Similarly, any debts you incur as a sole proprietor are 
the same as your personal debts.
Why are so many home-based businesses organized as sole proprietorships? 
Perhaps one reason is that by default your business is considered a sole 
proprietorship if you do nothing to formally organize your business. In other 
words, by doing nothing, you automatically make the decision to become a 

210
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
sole proprietorship. Another reason may be that creating a partnership or 
corporation is more difficult because doing so requires creating partnership 
agreements or filing incorporation forms with the government.
Fortunately, the sole proprietorship isn’t a bad form for many home-based 
businesses to take. After all, it’s the simplest and least regulated form of busi­
ness organization, startup costs are minimal or nil, and one person owns the 
business and wields full control over it. The sole proprietor is responsible 
for securing financing, and he or she receives all company profits. Business 
income under the sole-proprietorship form of business is taxed as personal 
income, which works out just fine for most home-business owners.
On the other hand, a sole proprietorship offers major disadvantages in the 
areas of legal liability for the owner (who can be personally sued for any and 
all business-related issues) and potential dissolution of the business upon 
the owner’s death. Table 10-1 summarizes the pros and cons of a sole 
proprietorship.
Table 10-1	
Sole Proprietorship
Pros
Cons
The owner has complete 
control over all aspects of the 
business.
The sole proprietorship is considered less 
prestigious than some other forms of business.
Starting a sole proprietorship 
is inexpensive.
Creating and maintaining secure outside 
financing can be particularly difficult.
A sole proprietorship is easy 
to start and easy to close.
The business dies when the owner does.
The owner gets to keep all 
profits.
The owner is personally liable in the event of a 
lawsuit (as a result of malpractice, product 
failure, and so on).
Perusing partnerships
If you have two or more owners of your home-based business — perhaps 
you and a close friend or relative — consider choosing the partnership form 
of business. In a partnership, each partner commits to provide specific skills, 
expertise, and effort — and to share the partnership’s expenses — in return 
for an agreed-on portion of the company’s profits. The agreement spelling 
out these terms is called (not surprisingly) a partnership agreement.
Partnerships take advantage of the different skills, expertise, and resources — 
including cash — that the different partners bring to an organization. And 

211
 Chapter 10: Knowing Your Legal Do’s and Don’ts
they’re fairly easy to put together and administer; all you really need is a 
simple written agreement, which you can make more complicated if the 
stakes are high.
Be sure, however, to have a lawyer take a look at your partnership agreement 
before you sign it. Because partners have a legally recognized ownership 
stake in the business, each is an agent for the partnership and can hire 
employees, borrow money, and operate the business.
On the plus side, a partnership’s profits are taxed as personal income, with 
each partner taxed on his or her portion of the profits. On the minus side of 
the ledger, however, partners are personally liable for debts and taxes. And 
personal assets can be confiscated if the partnership can’t satisfy creditors’ 
claims. If you have a nice home or a car or two, keep this point in mind before
you enter into a partnership. Table 10-2 shows the advantages and disadvan­
tages in detail.
	
In the event that partners want to avoid personal liability, they can form a spe­
cial legal arrangement called a limited partnership. Limited partnerships must be 
registered and must also pay a franchise fee charged by the state to file a certifi­
cate of limited partnership. Don’t forget: Although it’s legally possible to create a 
partnership with only a handshake and sometimes less, in the event of disagree­
ment or when it’s time to dissolve the partnership, you’ll wish you had a written 
agreement. Consider having a lawyer either draft or review your partnership 
agreement. Remember: The money you pay now for a lawyer’s help will save you 
many headaches and, potentially, big stacks of cash down the road.
Table 10-2	
Partnership
Pros
Cons
A partnership incorporates the 
skills, expertise, and efforts of 
two or more people.
Partners don’t always agree on every course 
of action, a situation that may eventually harm 
the business.
Business risks are diffused 
across one or more partners.
Each partner is legally liable for actions of the 
other partners, including hiring employees, 
borrowing money, and operating the 
business.
Partners support one another 
and provide a stimulating social 
environment.
Some partners may think they deserve more 
of the business’s profits than the other partners.
Government exerts little direct 
control over partnerships.
Like divorces, when partnerships break up, 
things can get messy fast.
All partners share the expenses.
All partners share the profits.

212
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
Looking at limited liability companies
The limited liability company (LLC) is a fairly recent innovation, providing 
flexibility in management the way a general partnership does while offering 
the limited liability of a corporation. On one hand, LLCs are treated as part­
nerships for U.S. income tax purposes, but, on the other hand, they receive 
the protection from personal liability that corporations enjoy. LLCs are now 
legally recognized in all 50 states, in the District of Columbia, and in many 
foreign countries.
Owners of LLCs are known as members — comparable to stockholders in 
a corporation or limited partners in a limited partnership. If you decide to 
create an LLC, you have to file articles of organization with your secretary 
of state. Each LLC member must also execute an operating agreement that 
defines the relationship between the company and its members. Check your 
state’s procedures to find out the requirements that apply to you.
The LLC form of business may be the preferred choice for certain new opera­
tions and joint ventures. The pluses and minuses of LLCs are similar to those 
of partnerships, with the exception of the limitation of liability that corpora­
tions enjoy. Table 10-3 gives you some other pros and cons.
Table 10-3	
Limited Liability Company
Pros
Cons
LLCs offer limited liability for the 
company’s principals (owners).
Many states require that the business include 
more than one person.
Federal taxes treat LLCs as 
partnerships, though some 
states, including California, 
treat them as corporations.
LLCs dissolve on the death of an owner.
LLCs cost less to form and 
maintain than do corporations 
and require less paperwork.
LLCs cost more to set up and maintain than do 
sole proprietorships.
Checking out corporations
Without a doubt, the corporation is the most complex form of business. 
Corporations are unique because they’re legal entities that exist separately 
from their owners, which is why corporations limit the personal liability 
of their owners. Although they limit the owners from personal liability, 

213
 Chapter 10: Knowing Your Legal Do’s and Don’ts
however, a double taxation on earnings (corporate tax and personal tax) may 
result, putting corporations at a tax disadvantage in certain circumstances. 
Corporations are identified by having the words Incorporated (Inc.) or 
Corporation (Corp.) in or after their names.
On the positive side of things, the corporation form may help you finance 
your company because it allows you to raise capital easily through the sale of 
corporate stocks or bonds. And because a corporation exists apart from its 
owners, it can function even without key individuals. The corporation form of 
business also enables employees to participate in various types of insurance 
and profit-sharing plans that may not be available to sole proprietorships, 
partnerships, or LLCs.
On the minus side, corporations can be expensive to start and maintain, and 
the required paperwork may be a nightmare for people who dislike red tape. 
Costs and procedures for incorporating vary from state to state, and you 
have to be careful to do it right the first time. Contact your secretary of state 
for more information (find out more info on your state’s Web site). Table 10-4 
shares more of the advantages and disadvantages of corporations.
A special type of corporation — an S corporation — allows owners to overcome 
the double tax problem of regular corporations (called C corporations) 
by allowing shareholders to offset business losses with personal income. 
However, as if the government (in this case, state government) didn’t already 
charge enough to incorporate, S corporations are subject to an additional 
annual surcharge from the federal government. Everyone, it seems, wants a 
piece of the action.

Corporation
Pros
Cons
A corporation has the best overall 
business image.
A corporation is expensive to start and 
operate.
Personal liability of owners and 
stockholders is limited.
Starting and maintaining a corporation 
involves mountains of paperwork.
A corporation can (and generally 
does) survive its owners.
Tax benefits may be little or nil compared 
with the other forms of business.
A corporation is easier to sell, 
although a majority of voting stock­
holders is required to do so.
All the paperwork required to form a cor­
poration require quite a bit of effort to make 
changes to.
A corporation can sell stock and 
bonds, making raising capital 
easier than with other forms of 
business.
A corporation is double taxed in some 
states, and insurance may be more 
expensive than for other forms of business.

Part III: Avoiding Problems 
The Web has taken a lot of the hassle and cost out of incorporating. Sites 
that provide incorporating services include Intuit’s MyCorporation (my
corporation.intuit.com), LegalZoom (www.legalzoom.com), and 
BizFilings (www.bizfilings.com). Their services and costs vary.
Despite all the options available to home-based businesses, most start out as 
either sole proprietorships or partnerships. Forming sole proprietorships or 
partnerships is the easiest way to go, and it costs little or no money.
Eventually, though, many home-based businesses consider the other major 
available forms of business — LLCs and corporations — because each one 
offers unique advantages and disadvantages to home-based businesses, espe­
cially when it comes to liability and taxes.
Figuring Out What to Call Your 
Business: Name Registration
Choosing the name of your company is one of the most critical decisions you 
make as you set up your business. We’re not exaggerating when we say that 
the right name can help pave the way to sales and success, and the wrong 
name can lead to all kinds of problems for you and your business — success 
not being one of them.
According to global corporate image expert Naseem Javed, quoted in the San 
Diego Union Tribune newspaper, “If you don’t have a good name, you’ll be 
throwing away advertising money and profit potential.”
	
Here’s an interesting bit of information: An average of 4,000 to 5,000 commercial 
messages are aimed at every person each day. Think about it for a minute — 
television and radio ads, newspapers, magazines, Internet pop-up and click-
through ads, ads on the sides of buses, company names on sports stadiums, 
junk mail, junk faxes, junk e-mail . . . the list goes on and on. How will your home-
based business cut through all that noise and capture the interest and attention 
of your prospective customers? A good name can make all the difference.
The best business names
	
✓	Describe the service or product that the business offers
	
✓	Are protected by trademark or service mark
	
✓	Are novel

215
 Chapter 10: Knowing Your Legal Do’s and Don’ts
	
Naming your business isn’t something to do with friends over a few beers 
while you’re grilling burgers in the backyard — it requires careful thought and 
planning. Your business name should give people some idea of the exact nature 
of your business (The Pink Poodle would be much better for a pet grooming 
business than for a tree-trimming business, for example), and it should also 
project the image you want your business to have. Names can be simple, 
sophisticated, or even silly (not too silly, though).
Think several years into the future; try to pick a name that will grow with 
your business over time instead of limiting it. The Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays 
travel agency, for example, decided it would be a good idea to change its 
name to Pleasant Holidays when its trip offerings expanded beyond the 
Hawaiian Islands.
	
Here are some tips on selecting a name:
	
✓	Use your own name — if you have a reputation or plan to grow one. 
Peter’s home-based business, for example, is titled Peter Economy 
Incorporated. Although it doesn’t tell potential customers what the com­
pany does, it does tell them who’s going to do it.
	
✓	Use your name with a tag line or motto (Sara’s Place: Where Cookies Are 
Number 1).
	
✓	Use a super-catchy Web site name (freecash4u.com, no-homework.
com).
	
✓	Use a name that communicates a primary benefit (No Mess Chimney 
Sweep).
	
✓	Use a name that describes your specialty (Fantastic Fabric Creations).
	
✓	Use a made-up name that suggests what you do or how you do it 
(Springfield Hand-Built Log Homes).
Of course, just as you can find general guidelines about what kinds of names 
you should use, think about the kinds of names you should avoid. Here are 
five key qualities to avoid when choosing your name, according to corporate 
image expert Naseem Javed:
	
✓	Overused (“There are 53,573 U.S. businesses or products with the name 
King in them and 5,730 with Mr.,” said Javed.)
	
✓	Politically incorrect (Aunt Jemima)
	
✓	Sound-alike (General, International, Dynamic, U.S.)
	
✓	Neutral (Gold Seal, Lucky, Micro, Data)
	
✓	Confusing (Ben Gay)

216
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
	
Along with a name, many businesses develop a logo — the graphic symbol of 
the business. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. As with your 
name, you should carefully design your logo to project the exact image you 
want for your business. See Chapter 14 for more on creating a logo.
After you’ve decided on a name, the next step is to make sure it isn’t already 
in use by another company. If the name you use is trademarked or otherwise 
legally protected by another business, not only can you be sued to stop using 
the name, but you can also lose the thousands of dollars for advertising and 
promotion you spent developing and promoting your brand and products.
	
Here are a few resources you can use to find out whether your proposed 
business name is already in use:
	
✓	Local phone books: Call directory assistance for the most recent listings, 
but understand that many home-based businesses don’t list business 
phone numbers.
	
✓	Local Web sites: Check out your county’s Web site for fictitious name 
registrations, also referred to as DBAs (“doing business as”).
	
✓	Domain name registrars: You can use sites like easywhois.com or 
whois.net; plus, most domain name registrars provide access to the 
WhoIs database.
	
✓	Online directories: Use online directories, such as www.anywho.com 
and www.infospace.com, and search engines, such as www.google.
com, www.alltheweb.com, www.bing.com, and www.yahoo.com.
	
✓	Trademark specialists: Search using a database, such as the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office (www.uspto.gov/main/trademarks.htm) or 
Corporation Service Company (www.cscprotectsbrands.com), or, 
better yet, an attorney specializing in trademarks and patents.
If all that searching sounds like a pain in the neck (and it does to us), hire 
someone to do a search for you.
When you’ve finally settled on a name, it may be worth your time and money 
to obtain a trademark from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect 
your business name and logo. If you don’t, someone else may take them away 
from you — along with all the customer goodwill you worked so hard to build.
If the name you choose isn’t your name, you’ll have to file a fictitious-business-
name statement (also called a doing business as, DBA, or d/b/a). Filing a DBA 
is also necessary if the business name implies greater ownership with such 
words as and Company, and Associates, or & Son/Daughter.

217
 Chapter 10: Knowing Your Legal Do’s and Don’ts
	
Although regulations vary from state to state (check with your local authorities 
to make sure you know exactly what you have to do), fictitious-business-name 
statements are generally filed with the county clerk and may also have to be 
published in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for four successive 
weeks in the county where the principal place of business is located. Because 
the cost of publishing legal notices, such as fictitious-business-name statements, 
varies widely from newspaper to newspaper, it pays to shop around.
After your legal notice has been published for the required period of time, 
you have to file an affidavit of publication with the county clerk or requisite 
local or state agency within 30 days after publication. Again, check the 
requirements in your locale to be sure you have a complete understanding of 
the filing requirements so you don’t miss anything.
Differentiating between Trademarks, 
Copyrights, and Patents
When you think of the word asset, the first thing that comes to your mind 
may be cash, a computer, a company car, or perhaps the equipment you use 
to make the items you sell to customers. However, one of the most important 
assets for many businesses today isn’t any of those things — it’s intellectual 
property, the unique ideas and knowledge that give a business a competitive 
advantage in the marketplace.
Intellectual property can range from a unique product design or the ingredients 
in your award-winning chili recipe to your company’s name, a song or photo­
graph, or the exact words you wrote in a newspaper or magazine article.
The value of your intellectual property depends on the nature of the ideas 
and their demand in the marketplace. But one thing is for sure: The value of 
your intellectual property is in jeopardy if you don’t take steps to protect it 
from theft, which is where trademarks, copyrights, and patents come in.
Trademarks
A trademark (™) is a distinctive word, name, symbol, or device — or any 
combination of the four — used to distinguish a product or service from those 
of competitors. A service mark (SM) is simply a trademark for services.

218
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
The word, name, symbol, or device you select to trademark must be suf­
ficiently unique to separate your products from their generic source. You 
can’t, for example, trademark the generic word cola, but you can trademark a 
trade name for your unique brand of cola known as Coca-Cola (or, that is, you 
could’ve if someone hadn’t beaten you to it 125 years or so ago).
You can apply the trademark or service-mark symbols to your distinctive word, 
name, or symbol at any time; you don’t have to get anyone’s permission to do 
so. If, however, you want to legally protect the trademark to ensure that 
someone else doesn’t steal it away from you (not a bad idea, in our humble 
opinions), consider registering it.
You can register trademarks and service marks through some state governments 
if you want protection only within the state in which your business is located 
or through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) if you want nation­
wide protection. When your trademark is registered on a nationwide basis, you 
can use the familiar ® symbol on your products and product information.
	
If you’re wondering whether someone has already registered a trademark or 
service mark, you can look it up in the USPTO trademark database online at 
www.uspto.gov.
	
A trademark may not prevent someone from stealing (or mistakenly using) 
your unique word, name, or symbol, but it does provide you with legal 
recourse in court in case someone does. In the long run, that provision may be 
worth its weight in gold to you and your business.
Copyrights
Copyright is a form of protection provided to the authors of “original works 
of authorship,” including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain 
other intellectual works, both published and unpublished. This book is 
copyrighted, for example. The script for the latest Harry Potter movie is copy­
righted. That song you were humming in the shower this morning is probably 
copyrighted.
U.S. copyright laws generally give the owner of copyright the exclusive right to 
reproduce the copyrighted work, prepare derivative works (works taken from 
the copyrighted work that owe their existence to the original work), distribute 
copies or phonograph records (those big, round, black things people bought 
before the invention of compact discs) of the copyrighted work, perform the 
copyrighted work publicly, or display the copyrighted work publicly.
	
A copyright is automatically created when the work itself is created — no 
need to file any forms or pay someone a bunch of money to copyright your 
work for you.

219
 Chapter 10: Knowing Your Legal Do’s and Don’ts
As is the case with trademarks and service marks, you can apply a copyright 
symbol (©) to your work at any time without getting anyone’s approval to 
do so. If, however, you want to be able to legally protect your work (again, a 
smart move, in our humble opinions), make sure you register your copyright 
and apply the © to it. Here are just some of the advantages of registering your 
copyright:
	
✓	Registration establishes a public record of the copyright claim — 
extremely valuable evidence that you have a right to your copyright.
	
✓	Registering your copyright gives you, as the creator of the work, protec­
tion for your entire lifetime plus 70 years (ideally, that should be long 
enough to cover you).
	
✓	Registration is necessary for works of U.S. origin before you can file an 
infringement suit in court.
	
✓	If made before or within five years of publication, registration estab­
lishes that the facts stated in the certificate of copyright are presumed 
to be true unless proven otherwise.
	
✓	If registration is made within three months after publication of the work 
or prior to an infringement of the work, damages specified by statute (or 
law) and attorney’s fees will be available to the copyright owner in court 
actions. Otherwise, only an award of actual damages and profits is 
available to the copyright owner.
	
✓	Registration allows the owner of the copyright to record the registra­
tion with the U.S. Customs Service for protection against copies being 
imported that infringe on your copyright.
Registering your copyright is simple. To register basic claims for literary 
works, visual art works, performing arts works — including motion pictures, 
sound recordings, and single serials — the preferred method is online reg­
istration through the electronic Copyright Office (eCO). To register through 
the eCO, visit www.copyright.gov and click on the link to the electronic 
Copyright Office.
A basic copyright claim includes:
	
✓	A single work
	
✓	Multiple unpublished works if they’re all by the same author(s) and 
owned by the same claimant
	
✓	Multiple published works if they’re all first published together in the 
same publication on the same date and owned by the same claimant
Filing a copyright electronically currently costs just $35 for a basic claim. If 
you don’t want to file electronically, you can choose to mail in your copyright 
registration. Certain kinds of filings — copyrighting the design of a ship’s hull 

220
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
or preregistration of certain unpublished works, for example — can’t be filed 
electronically. The fees for nonelectronic filing are higher, however, and the 
process takes longer to complete. For complete details and forms, visit the 
Web site for the Copyright Office at www.copyright.gov.
Patents
A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor, issued 
by the USPTO. The term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the 
application for the patent was filed in the United States and, in special circum­
stances, from a filing outside the United States at an earlier date. U.S. patent 
grants are effective only within the United States and its territories and 
possessions.
The idea of patents is to allow the inventor or patent holder an exclusive 
right to obtain the full financial benefits of his or her invention — allowing 
the inventor to recover his or her investment of time and money — before 
others are allowed to help themselves to a piece of the financial pie.
Imagine that you spent ten years of your life designing a new kind of 
mousetrap — far superior and more cost-effective than any currently on
the market — and began selling it, only to have someone immediately copy
it and undercut your price, putting you out of business in the process. In 
such a case, a patent is essential to protect you and your business.
What can and can’t be patented has been subject to much debate over the 
years — witness the recent furor over the patenting of genetically modified 
seeds for corn and other crops and unique software programs, such as 
Amazon.com’s 1-Click ordering process. According to U.S. patent law, any 
person who “invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, 
manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement 
thereof, may obtain a patent,” subject to the conditions and requirements of 
the law.
	
If you think you have an item that can and should be patented, we suggest that 
you run — don’t walk — to a competent patent attorney. The patent application 
process requires considerable research, and the appropriate forms have to be 
filed the right way and at the right time and place. When you’re talking about 
something that may turn out to be your major source of income for many 
years into the future — and may very well make you rich — don’t try doing 
it yourself — seek professional help fast. Although filing a patent isn’t inex­
pensive, a competent patent attorney can save you lots of time, money, and 
heartache.

 Chapter 10: Knowing Your Legal Do’s and Don’ts
Determining the Need for Zoning, 
Licensing, and Permits
Zoning, licensing, and permits — this is where the red tape really gets 
sticky . . . and thick. No matter which governments — federal, state, or local — 
have jurisdiction in your particular place of business, you can bet they all 
have something to say about how, when, and where you can and can’t run 
your business.
Although you may have an easier time sticking your head in the sand and ignor­
ing all the rules and regulations that the different government organizations 
want you to follow, you do so at your own risk. When sufficiently motivated 
(as they will be if your neighbors complain to elected officials about cars that 
suddenly start parking in front of your house), most government agencies 
and departments aren’t the slightest bit shy about issuing fines, imposing 
penalties, and — if compliance isn’t forthcoming in a reasonable amount of 
time — closing down offending businesses.
Working your way through the maze of government regulations can certainly 
be one of the most confusing aspects of doing business, but it’s also critical 
for your success in the long run. Yes, the process can be intimidating, and, 
yes, you’d much rather be selling your products and services than messing 
with all this red tape and paperwork, but it’s definitely worth your while to 
dig in.

Instead of ignoring government regulations and requirements, consider this 
step as one that will enhance the professionalism of your business. In order 
for people to take you and your business seriously, you need to establish your 
business in a professional way (in other words, according to government rules 
and regulations). And for many home-based businesses, being taken seriously 
is one of the key steps to finding long-term success.
Zoning
For some reason, many homeowners — particularly ones who live in quiet 
residential areas — don’t like the idea of having a busy (loud, junky, or other­
wise obnoxious) business move in next door. Just the thought of a constant 
parade of customer cars coming and going at all hours of the day or night, 
the clatter and noise coming from a makeshift appliance-repair shop out in 
your garage, or the vision of partly assembled cars littering the driveway is 
enough to send many homeowners into a fit of concern or even anger. And 
indeed, when people buy their homes, they (surprise!) generally expect to get 
some measure of peace and quiet along with them.
	
Peter remembers the time a few years ago when one of his next-door neigh­
bors decided to open an automobile-restoration business in his backyard. It 
wouldn’t have been so bad in itself except for the loud air compressor that 
the neighbor found necessary to run 12 hours a day to drive his sandblasting 
equipment — waking Peter’s 1-year-old daughter and making writing his books 
and articles a difficult proposition during daylight hours. It took Peter six 
months — from the day he first complained to his neighbor about the noise 
(and being told to jump in a lake) to the day the city zoning department finally 
shut down the operation — to get relief. But he did eventually get relief.
Zoning laws are, among other things, the government’s favorite way of trying 
to keep residential areas residential and business areas business — making 
everyone (well, almost everyone) happy in the process. An estimated 90 per­
cent of all U.S. cities place restrictions on home-based work.
In general, zoning laws do work. After a citizen makes a complaint, most juris­
dictions follow an established procedure to determine whether a business 
owner is breaking the rules or not — and take action only when necessary. 
Unfortunately, the very zoning laws that attempt to ensure that someone 
doesn’t decide to build a coal-fired power generation plant across the street 
from your house are also the same laws that may restrict (and in some cases 
prevent) you from starting a business in your own home.
Here are some of the categories of rules that zoning laws may impose in your 
particular city or county:
	
✓	Advertising signage
	
✓	Parking and vehicle traffic

223
 Chapter 10: Knowing Your Legal Do’s and Don’ts
	
✓	The percentage of your home devoted to business
	
✓	The number of people you employ and the jobs you employ them to 
perform
	
✓	The use of hazardous materials and chemicals
	
✓	Noise, smoke, and odor
If you’re wondering what zoning laws, rules, and regulations may impact your 
home-based business, visit your city or county planning, zoning, or building 
code compliance department, or spend some time in a local law library. Your 
local chamber of commerce or small business administration office may also 
be a good source of information.
	
One more thing: Although your local zoning laws may permit you to run your 
home-based business as you intend, your particular neighborhood, develop­
ment, condominium project, or rental property may have rules, covenants, 
or other deeded restrictions on those very same activities. Check your real 
estate purchase or leasing documents to see whether such rules, covenants, 
or restrictions apply to you.
So what can you do if zoning regulations make your home-based business ille­
gal or are so restrictive that you can’t operate your business effectively? You 
can certainly ignore the regulations and hope you don’t get caught, but that’s 
not really the best long-term solution, and we don’t recommend it.
You’re apt to discover that at least one of your neighbors isn’t going to be 
happy about some aspect of your business and will file a complaint. Not only 
that, but also, keep in mind the fact that if you operate an illegal business, 
you’re breaking the law. And if you break the law, you’d better be ready to 
pay the consequences (we’ll keep an eye on the Court TV listings just in case 
you make an appearance).
A better idea is to try one of the following approaches:
	
✓	Get permission. If you’re living in a rental property and your lease 
restricts the kinds of business activities you can undertake, ask your 
landlord for permission to do what you need to do. So long as you’re not 
creating a nuisance or causing damage to your property, you may find 
that your landlord will work with you.
	
✓	Request a variance. Government agencies and departments routinely 
grant variances to rules and regulations for property owners who request 
them. Often, you only have to fill out a short form. In other cases, your 
request may have to be publicly heard before your city council, zoning 
board, or other body (in the case of conflicts with neighborhood cov­
enants, you may need to appeal to your neighborhood association). 
Check with your zoning or planning department to find out what options 
are available for you.

224
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
	
✓	Fight city hall. In some cases, you may have no other choice but to take 
action to change the rules or regulations that restrict your ability to 
start and operate a home-based business. A variety of approaches are 
available to you, from buttonholing your district’s council member, to 
circulating a petition, to lobbying for legislative change, to filing a lawsuit. 
The exact action you take depends on your community’s political environ­
ment. If you have any friends, relatives, or business acquaintances who 
have taken on city hall, ask what worked for them.
	
Although zoning regulations can get in the way of your home-business plans, 
they don’t have to be the end of your dream. If the rules aren’t in your favor, 
you have legally viable options for either living with them, bending them, or 
changing them.
Licensing and permits
There really is a business license or permit for most any occasion. Which 
ones does your home-based business need? It really depends on which city, 
county, and state your business is located in.
Ask questions, starting with your city and/or county government. Describe 
the kind of business you have in mind to find out which forms and require­
ments are appropriate for you. Your local government may even have a 
special booklet or package of forms specifically for new or home-based busi­
nesses. After you check with your local government, contact the state and 
federal agencies that apply to your business.
Some of the most common licenses and permits include the following:
	
✓	Business license: The standard permit to operate a business locally, it’s 
required of most every business, no matter how large or small. Check 
with your local business agency for details.
	
✓	Home occupation permit: If your community restricts home-based busi­
nesses, you need one of these permits.
	
✓	Miscellaneous local permits: Contact your local business agency to see 
whether any other business permits are required.
	
✓	Police permit: Some businesses need police clearance or a police 
permit. You may also need a police permit if your business has an alarm 
that generates a police response when it goes off.
	
✓	Food permit: Businesses that make or sell food need this permit.

225
 Chapter 10: Knowing Your Legal Do’s and Don’ts
	
✓	Seller’s permit: Businesses that sell taxable products in states with 
sales tax need one of these permits. (Note that only a few states don’t 
have sales tax.)
	
	The definition of taxable products varies from state to state. Graphic 
design services, for example, may be considered a nontaxable service in 
one state but taxable in another.
	
✓	Building permits, fire certificates, and zoning permits: Check with 
your local planning department for restrictions on the kinds of business 
activities you can conduct in your home. Some localities, for example, 
restrict home-based businesses that operate in residentially zoned com­
munities from having customers come to the place of business.
	
✓	State occupational licenses: Certain occupations (for example, doctors, 
lawyers, general contractors, day-care providers, and so on) require a 
special license. Check with the state agency regulating consumer affairs.
	
✓	Federal export licenses: If you want to export goods to another country, 
your business will be subject to all kinds of federal regulation. Get more 
information from the U.S. Department of Commerce at www.doc.gov. A 
number of optional certifications can help in some situations: You may 
want to look into being certified as a small business, minority-owned, 
woman-owned, or disabled-veteran-owned enterprise.

Don’t get discouraged by all this paperwork and red tape. Owning and operating 
your own business is the light at the end tunnel created by all these blasted 
forms. Remember that people are ready, willing, and able to help if you feel 
overwhelmed. Contact your local small business development center, chamber 
of commerce, or other local economic development organization for guidance 
on these local, state, and federal issues; you’ll be glad you did.
Scrutinizing Your Tax Requirements
You can be sure that your business is going to owe taxes to somebody, 
somewhere, particularly if your business is making a profit. Depending on the 
state where you’re located, the kind of business you conduct, and the form 
of business you select, you may owe taxes to many different people in many 
different places.
Take a look at the following list for a hint of the kinds of taxes you can look 
forward to paying when you own your own home-based business:
	
✓	Income tax
	
✓	Self-employment tax
	
✓	Estimated tax
	
✓	Social Security tax
	
✓	Unemployment tax
	
✓	Sales tax
	
✓	Excise tax
	
✓	Use tax
	
✓	Business tax

▶	Creating trade accounts and increasing your cash flow at the same time
▶	Taking advantage of support services
▶	Looking to outside professionals for help
▶	Bartering safely and effectively
O
kay, so you’re the boss, owner, and chief bottle-washer of your home-
based business. Now what? In theory, you could probably do each 
and every job on your own — from reviewing contracts to picking the best 
insurance coverage to representing your business in court to designing and 
printing your own letterhead stationery — but you really should think twice 
before doing so. Specialists — lawyers, certified public accountants, insur­
ance brokers, and others — are much more knowledgeable and up-to-date 
about certain topics than you can ever be, and using their services allows 
you to focus on doing the things that you do best — namely, running your 
business.
Beyond these outside professionals, you should (and likely will have to) con­
sider using a variety of outside resources when the opportunities present 
themselves. Establishing trade accounts with the outside vendors you rely 
on to sell you the products and services you need to do business is just one 
example.
In this chapter, we look at why, when, and how to take advantage of outside 
resources. Doing so can give you a real edge against your competition and help 
you provide your customers with the best products and services possible.

Part III: Avoiding Problems 
Establishing Trade Accounts
A trade account is an informal agreement between you and a supplier or 
vendor — such as an office supply store, printing company, or warehouse 
superstore — that allows you to purchase goods or services on credit and be 
billed by the supplier on a regular, usually monthly, basis. A trade account is 
a win-win situation for both parties — you can purchase whatever you want 
whenever you want, and your supplier gains a steady customer.
	
The care and maintenance of trade accounts is essential for almost any busi­
ness, because these accounts speed the purchasing process and often provide 
customers with special discounts unavailable to regular customers or with 
premiums such as free overnight delivery. Companies that don’t have trade 
accounts miss out on these and other benefits. Another important benefit of 
trade accounts is that when a company agrees to establish a trade account 
with you, its management is essentially agreeing to extend a short-term, 
interest-free loan to your company — allowing you to pay your bill anywhere 
from a few days to a month or more after you complete your purchase and 
receive your goods or services. This free loan is a good deal for your company 
and one worth actively pursuing and maintaining. The longer you hold on to 
your money, the more positive the impact on your company’s cash flow.
As you continue to grow your business, you may find that some of the follow­
ing trade accounts are beneficial for you to establish:
	
✓	Product vendors: If you sell products on a retail basis, you have to 
buy them from vendors or purchase the raw materials from suppliers. 
Establishing trade accounts with such vendors makes your life much 
easier; you can place orders now and pay for your purchases later — 
usually up to 30 days after you receive your invoice.
	
✓	Office supply stores: If you regularly purchase large quantities of 
office supplies, consider building a relationship (by establishing a 
trade account) with one office supply vendor that can meet your needs 
quickly and accurately. The big office supply chains like Staples and 
Office Depot offer their own business customer credit programs. Simply 
fill out an online application and submit it for approval. If your credit 
record is good, you should have no problem gaining approval.
	
✓	Warehouse superstores: Warehouse superstores, such as Costco and 
Sam’s Club, offer everything most home offices need — from appliances 
to office supplies to groceries and baked goods — at great prices, so set­
ting up a trade account with one of these superstores is a good idea for 
many businesses.
	
✓	Copying/reproduction centers: If you constantly find yourself send­
ing jobs out for printing or copying, you may want to establish a trade 
account with your printer so that you receive a monthly bill instead 
of having to pay every time you run a job. Copy centers such as FedEx 

229
 Chapter 11: Using Outside Resources and Experts
Office offer their own charge cards to business customers, which they 
bill on a monthly basis. The monthly invoices, which present detailed 
information about each order, are also a great way to keep track of your 
copying and reproduction jobs.
	
✓	Office equipment repair companies: Has your computer’s hard drive 
ever crashed? If so, you know just how scary life can be — and how 
dependent you are on office machines and equipment. Having an 
established relationship with a good computer/office equipment repair 
person before — not after — your equipment goes down can really pay 
off. In all honesty, the question isn’t whether your office equipment will 
break, but when. Even if you don’t go through the trouble of establishing 
a relationship with an office equipment repair company before you need 
it, take some time to become familiar with who’s good and who’s not so 
good. That way, when the inevitable emergency does occur, you know 
where to take your sick machine.
	
✓	Support services: Numerous support services are available to you, 
depending on the nature of your business. From typists and architects 
to paralegals and consulting engineers, you can establish relationships 
and trade accounts with just about anyone. (In the next section, we 
address how to decide which support services you need and then how 
to identify and hire them.)
	
✓	Courier/messenger services: Although more and more transactions are 
being handled over the Internet, some items, such as products and signed 
documents, must be physically sent and received. When you establish an 
account with an overnight courier service, such as FedEx or UPS, or with a 
local messenger service, you receive preprinted, multipart shipping docu­
ments or air bills. Even better, most of these companies now allow you to 
set up your shipments online, printing out shipping documents on your 
computer and making it easy to track your package’s progress — from 
your home office to your customer’s front door.
Trade accounts are a good thing, and you should try to establish them with 
all your regular vendors, suppliers, and service providers. Not only do they 
streamline your business dealings, but because you hold on to your money 
for a longer period of time, they also help you improve your cash flow. And 
because a trade account is basically a short-term loan, the fact that you have 
trade accounts in good standing shows that your business is creditworthy, 
making it easier for you to obtain other trade accounts and business credit.
	
Trade accounts also work the other way — other businesses may want to 
establish trade accounts with you. Allowing them to do so may make a lot of 
sense because it encourages repeat business and the development of long-
term business relationships. You must, however, protect yourself from cus­
tomers who don’t pay their bills. Check credit references scrupulously. Don’t 
just take a business’s word for it — especially when you have a lot of money 
on the line. Do a Google search for credit application form, and you’ll find 
plenty of sample forms that you can easily adapt for your own purposes.

230
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
Using Support Services
With just 24 hours in a day, if you’re the sole proprietor and only employee of 
your home-based business, you may find that you have difficulty doing day-
to-day support and administrative tasks while still doing the work that your 
customers pay you to do — which is where using support services comes in.
Support services include everything from short-term employees to temporary 
employment firms to professionals, such as lawyers, accountants, and con­
sultants — in fact, support services potentially include any business service 
you can imagine.
Consider using support services for the following three reasons:
	
✓	You can take advantage of people who have more experience than 
you do in certain areas. Do you know how to file a patent application? 
Or the best way to set up a computerized accounting system? Or which 
healthcare plans offer the best deal for home-based businesses in your 
state? If not, providers of support services — many of whom are owners 
of home-based businesses themselves — do. People who provide sup­
port services are specialists at what they do, just as you’re a specialist 
at what you do. One of the great things about using support services is 
that you can take advantage of as much or as little of their experience as 
you like — usually for a reasonable hourly fee.
	
✓	You can leverage your experience. Using certain support services, 
such as hiring a temporary employee as an assistant, can allow you to 
leverage your own experience — greatly increasing your effectiveness 
in the process. After you teach another person to perform a high-dollar-
return task that you’re an expert at, that other person can do the same 
thing you do, instantly multiplying the effort spent on that task and sub­
stantially increasing the financial return. For example, why not consider 
hiring someone to make cold calls to prospective customers or to create 
and distribute flyers advertising your business? While you’re busy work­
ing, your new employee can be drumming up new customers.
	
✓	You can focus your efforts. Instead of getting caught up in all the details 
of producing 500 copies of a 12-page brochure (finding the right kind of 
paper, using the right machine, dealing with jams and equipment break­
downs, collating, and folding), why not just drop it off at FedEx Office 
or another copy center, and let them worry about it? Doing so lets you 
focus your efforts on the things that bring money into your firm — such 
as selling products and writing proposals.

231
 Chapter 11: Using Outside Resources and Experts
So what kinds of support services should you consider using for your home-
based business? Here’s a partial list (but keep in mind that many more are 
available to home-business owners):
	
✓	Copying, printing, and graphics design
	
✓	Public relations
	
✓	Packaging and shipping
	
✓	Professional services, such as accounting, legal, banking, and so on
	
✓	Temporary help
	
✓	Advertising
	
✓	Cleaning
Leasing employees
Q: I have a home-based medical-billing busi­
ness, and I’m ready to hire employees. Because 
I didn’t want to hassle with payroll, workman’s 
comp, and so on, I called several employee-
leasing companies. To my surprise, none would 
provide me with employees because I’m home 
based. What should I do?
A: We’re surprised and appalled to discover 
that some employee-leasing companies are 
discriminating against home-based busi­
nesses! Like many home-based companies, we 
use employee leasing ourselves. We’ve worked 
with two different companies for more than five 
years, and the results have been more than 
satisfactory. So we recommend that you keep 
looking to find more-enlightened companies.
Be sure that you’re actually contacting 
employee-leasing companies — not temp 
agencies. Professional employer organiza­
tions, as employee-leasing companies are 
called, carry out the administrative functions of 
having employees. You recruit the personnel, 
interview them, and select them. When you’re 
ready to put them to work, you contact the leas­
ing company, which puts them on the payroll 
and handles all aspects of their employment 
for you. Temporary-help agencies, on the other 
hand, recruit, interview, and train employees, 
whom they then send to work with companies 
on a short- or long-term basis.
For many years, we’ve been aware that some 
temporary agencies won’t place their temps 
in home offices. However, some temp agen­
cies do. Consider working with an employee-
leasing company if you have an employee in 
mind or want to find someone yourself. If you 
want an agency to find and place someone to 
work in your business, contact a temporary-
help agency.
To locate such companies, you can contact the 
following:

Part III: Avoiding Problems 
Although you may have plenty of time to do these tasks when your company 
is new and has little business, after it starts to grow, you’ll want to devote 
more time to selling and fulfilling customer needs and less time to doing the 
kinds of tasks that don’t directly generate cash for the business.
Finding Good Lawyers, Accountants, 
and Other Professionals
When you own a home-based business, you’re responsible for just about 
everything. Whether you’re selling your products, paying the bills, or taking 
out the trash, the business begins and ends with you — without you, you 
have no business.
This simple fact doesn’t mean, however, that you have to go at it alone. Any 
number of outside professionals are ready, willing, and able to help you build 
and expand your business and help you make sure you’re on a firm footing — 
legally and financially. By leveraging the services of key professionals, such 
as lawyers, accountants, bankers, insurance agents, and others, a small busi­
ness can be just as effective as a much larger organization — perhaps even 
more so.
	
No matter what kinds of professionals you decide to affiliate with, check them 
out thoroughly before you commit to doing business with them. Don’t forget: 
Your goal is to find someone who is not only talented and affordable, but who 
also can grow with you and your company and become a long-term partner 
and trusted associate. (Peter, for example, has been working with the same 
accountant since 1986 and the same lawyer since 1992.) Take your time when 
you’re selecting the professionals you want to work with; believe us, the time 
you invest in the process now will pay off many times over in the years to 
come. Consider the following during the selection process:
	
✓	Qualifications: Hire professionals who are as qualified and experienced 
as possible; you don’t want your business to be the place where they 
learn the ropes. Don’t hire someone who merely dabbles in an area of 
professional expertise or who does it as a hobby. You need someone 
who’s a pro and who’s fully committed to your success.
	
✓	Accessibility: You may have a difficult time getting some professionals’ 
attention when you really need them. Make sure the professionals you 
hire aren’t already so overcommitted with other clients that they can’t 
meet your needs quickly, when you need them the most.

233
 Chapter 11: Using Outside Resources and Experts
	
✓	Price: Although you should never select a professional based on price 
alone, price certainly does enter into the equation. With some big-city 
lawyers charging more than $400 an hour, every dollar really does 
count. Don’t be afraid to shop around for the best combination of skill, 
experience, and price.
	
✓	Ethics: Hire professionals who have ethical standards that are just as 
high as the standards you uphold. Choosing someone with flexible 
ethics is asking for trouble.
	
✓	Compatibility: The preceding characteristics don’t mean much if you 
aren’t compatible with your chosen professional. Conversely, you may 
be willing to give up some experience or price in exchange for someone 
you really get along with. The ideal situation is to find someone who 
meets all your criteria and is also compatible with you and any business 
partners and associates you may have.
In the following sections, we take a close look at some of the kinds of profes­
sionals that home-based business owners most often turn to for help and 
support.
Hiring the right lawyers
Question: How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb? Answer: 
How many can you afford? Actually, most lawyers really are nice people to 
work with, and they do have other things on their minds besides emptying 
your bank accounts. In fact, an attorney’s services are an important part of 
any business’s — including any home-based business’s — support team.
What exactly can attorneys do for your business? Here are some of the most 
common tasks attorneys take on for small-business clients like you:
	
✓	Choosing a business form (legal structure) for your business
	
✓	Writing, reviewing, and negotiating business contracts
	
✓	Dealing with employee issues
	
✓	Helping with credit problems and bankruptcy
	
✓	Addressing consumer issues and complaints
	
✓	Working with rental or leasing agreements
	
✓	Outlining workers’ compensation and Social Security benefits
	
✓	Advising you on your legal rights and obligations
	
✓	Representing you in court

234
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
	
Be sure to seek out an attorney who specializes in working with small busi­
nesses and startups. Any other attorney may not have the exact skill set you 
need. If you have a family attorney, start there. If he or she isn’t the best 
person for the job, chances are you’ll get a good referral to someone who is. 
One more thing: Make a point of asking your attorney how much a particular 
task costs — before you engage his or her services. There’s nothing worse 
than getting a bill that’s in the thousands of dollars when you expected to pay 
far less. For those of you who are understandably wary about working with a 
lawyer who charges by the hour, there’s a move afoot to get lawyers to change 
to project billing — that is, a flat rate for a specific task, such as incorporating 
your business or filing a trademark application. Ask your lawyer to give you a 
flat price for the work you need done. Doing so helps you avoid nasty financial 
surprises and keeps your relationship on good terms.
Picking good accountants
If you’re not an expert in accounting — and even if you are but would rather 
devote your precious time to taking care of your customers’ needs — getting 
a good accountant is a definite must. As the owner of your business, you need 
to know exactly how much money is going in and out of your business and for 
what purposes it’s being used. This knowledge allows you to assess the finan­
cial health of your company and helps you make plans for the future. Plus, the 
information contained in your accounting system provides the basis for deter­
mining how much you owe the government in taxes and other fees.
	
Inadequate recordkeeping is a principal contributor to the failure of many small 
businesses. A good accountant can be a tremendous help in setting up a useful 
financial recordkeeping system, as well as providing ongoing financial advice.
Here are some of the most common tasks that accountants perform for their 
small-business customers:
	
✓	Small-business startup, business sale, or business purchase
	
✓	Accounting system design and implementation
	
✓	Preparation, review, and audit of financial statements
	
✓	Tax planning
	
✓	Preparation of income tax returns
	
✓	Tax appeals

235
 Chapter 11: Using Outside Resources and Experts
	
Keep in mind that you may not need the services of a full-blown accountant or 
certified public accountant (CPA). You may find that for simple tracking of 
money in and out of your business, a bookkeeper is just what the doctor 
ordered. A bookkeeper is someone (often a home-based businessperson) who 
records the accounts and transactions of a business. He or she probably 
doesn’t have a college degree in accounting nor the license required to be a 
CPA. However, for many basic tasks, such as entering and keeping track of 
income and expense transactions in an accounting system, a bookkeeper is a 
more affordable option. And if you just need someone to represent you with 
the Internal Revenue Service for tax audits, collections, and appeals, consider 
using the services of an enrolled agent. Enrolled agents are federally autho­
rized tax practitioners who are trained experts in the field of taxation. They 
specialize in advising, representing, and preparing tax returns for individuals, 
partnerships, corporations, estates, and trusts, and may have more experi­
ence in taxes than a typical accountant or bookkeeper.
Find and choose an accountant the same way you select any other profes­
sional adviser. Check with friends and business associates for recommenda­
tions. Interview at least three candidates to be sure that your personalities 
are compatible.
	
When you interview your prospective candidates (either in person or over the 
phone), make sure you get answers to the following questions:
	
✓	Does your candidate have specific experience working with home-based 
businesses?
	
✓	Does your candidate show an active interest in the financial aspects of 
your business operations (cash flow, inventory, and so on)?
	
✓	Does your candidate have specific experience with income tax, and does 
he or she keep abreast of the latest changes in the tax law as it pertains 
to your industry?
	
✓	What do the candidate’s references say about his or her performance 
and reliability?
	
✓	What is the candidate’s fee structure?
	
✓	Does your candidate have a network of other potentially beneficial finan­
cial contacts within your community (loan officers at local banks, for 
example)?
	
✓	Are you comfortable with the candidate, and are your financial philoso­
phies compatible?
One thing you’ll notice as you search for the right accountant for your busi­
ness is that some have the initials CPA following their names. A certified public 
accountant (CPA) is an accountant who has met his or her state’s minimum 
educational requirements and passed a rigorous examination covering 

236
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
accounting, business law, auditing, and taxes. CPAs are required to have a col­
lege degree (which, in some cases, can be offset by extensive work experience) 
and must meet an annual continuing-education requirement. So, basically, 
when you choose to affiliate with a CPA, you’re getting someone who’s at the 
top of the profession. A CPA may be more expensive than a regular accountant, 
but depending on your specific needs, the extra cost may be well worth your 
money.
	
Any skilled accountant — whether or not she has CPA after her name — may 
be just right for you and your business. It all depends on the experience and 
expertise she brings to the table, as well as her willingness to be available 
to help you when you really need it. Don’t exclude good candidates merely 
because they lack the letters CPA.
	
Be sure you have at least a basic understanding of accounting and the particu­
lar bookkeeping system you’re using. Even if you decide to hire an accountant 
to take care of the details, as the owner of your own business you have to 
understand how the financial side of your business works. Take advantage of 
the financial reporting functions of your system, and know how to read and 
interpret your company’s financial reports. For more information on doing 
just that, be sure to check out Chapter 6.
Banking on the best bankers
You want to have a relationship with your bank already in place when you 
need it; after all, you never know when you may need financing. It may be 
when you’re in the startup phase of your business or when you get a huge 
order from a customer and need to pay your suppliers before you receive 
payment. Or it may be when your business starts to grow, and you need to 
finance your expansion. Even if you don’t plan to expand any time soon and 
have no need for a loan or financing, having a relationship with your bank 
can still be helpful. For example, depending on the size of the checks you 
deposit, you may not have immediate access to your funds. Whether your 
bank puts a hold on the checks you deposit often depends on your banking 
relationship, how long your account has been open, and your average bal­
ance. These ongoing financial needs make finding and establishing a relation­
ship with a good local banker a must.
Soon after Peter established a business account for his new corporation at 
a large local bank, he was shocked to find out that any checks for more than 
$500 would be put on hold for a week or more while the bank waited for them 
to clear. Such an unexpected outcome can really put the hurt on your fledg­
ling business if you’re not ready to deal with it. In Peter’s case, a combination 
of lots of begging, sweet-talking, and threats to move his account to another 
bank helped keep his cash flowing.

237
 Chapter 11: Using Outside Resources and Experts
Establish a relationship with your banker (which is most often the branch 
manager) before you apply for a loan and before you deposit a $10,000 check 
that may take ten days to clear. The relationship you have with a banker 
at the time you apply for a loan can make the difference between getting 
approved and getting turned down.
The big question is: What kind of financial institution is right for your kind 
of home-based business? Several different kinds of financial institutions are 
available to you, and each one has a unique spin on the world of money and 
banking. Here are the main financial institutions you have to choose from:
	
✓	Banks: The first choice of many home-based businesses, banks include 
savings banks, savings and loans, and commercial banks. Banks tradi­
tionally make a wide variety of loans, both commercial and consumer, 
and they’re the place to go for special small-business loans offered in 
conjunction with the Small Business Administration (SBA). Most banks 
also offer special accounts designed specifically for businesses, along 
with a wide array of business-oriented products and services, which 
makes them the logical first choice for most businesses.
	
✓	Credit unions: Although credit unions are similar to banks in some 
ways, they’re owned by their members rather than public sharehold­
ers. This member ownership results in lower costs of operation, which 
are passed on to members in the form of lower interest rates on loans, 
higher savings interest rates, and free checking accounts. Most credit 
unions specialize in consumer loans rather than commercial loans. 
Credit unions are less likely than regular banks to offer special accounts 
and products and services for businesses, and in some cases (for exam­
ple, if your home-based business is a corporation that issues stock), 
they may not be able to accept your business as a customer.
	
✓	Credit card companies: As you probably already know, credit card 
companies offer interest rates that are often significantly higher than 
the rates you’d get on the same amount of money from a bank or credit 
union, yet thousands of companies regularly use credit cards to finance 
purchases. Why? Because using credit cards is usually far more con­
venient than applying for a loan every time you want to make a major 
purchase or make some other financial move. Keep in mind that even if 
the credit card has your company name on it, you’re likely personally 
responsible for the charges. If your business fails, the credit card com­
pany will look for you when the monthly payment is due.
	
✓	Commercial finance companies: These companies specialize in working 
with businesses, usually in financing equipment leasing or purchases or 
in acquiring inventory. The deals that commercial finance companies 
offer — particularly in leasing — may offer attractive tax advantages and 
are worth checking out.

238
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
	
✓	Consumer finance companies: These businesses specialize in making 
loans to borrowers who have a hard time obtaining loans from their 
banks or credit unions, perhaps because they have defaulted on loans in 
the past or because their credit is already overextended. Because those 
borrowers are considered higher risks for defaulting on loans, consumer 
finance companies generally charge significantly higher interest rates 
than banks and credit unions do. Therefore, most businesses should 
consider consumer finance companies a funding source of last resort.
	
Be sure that you anticipate your financing needs well in advance. Waiting until 
the last minute to develop a relationship with your banker or to apply for a 
critically needed loan is a recipe for financial disaster.
Consulting business consultants
Everyone has talents in many areas, but even you can’t be the master of 
everything. Don’t worry, though: Consultants are available to assist you in the 
areas in which you need expert help. You can hire business, management, 
and marketing consultants; promotion experts; financial planners; and a host 
of other specialists who can help make your business more successful.
Regardless of exactly which kind of consultant you decide to hire, follow 
these nine steps to select the right one:
	
1.	 Clearly define your objectives.
	
	 Describe the job you want done, and specify the things you expect from 
the assignment. Understand precisely how you expect your business to 
benefit from the work. Decide on the time frame, scope, and any con­
straints on the assignment. Clarify your own role and explain how the 
consultant’s time will be made available.
	
2.	Research a variety of consultants, select the three best, and ask for 
written proposals.
	
	 Make sure you ask for proposals only from consultants qualified to carry 
out your objectives. Good consultants will be more than happy to send 
you basic information about them and talk with you about your needs, 
without charge. Invite your best prospects to submit written proposals, 
which should include the following:
 
• Their understanding of the problem
 
• Their approach to solving the problem
 
• Names and résumés of the consultant(s) who will do the work
 
• Experience of the firm

239
 Chapter 11: Using Outside Resources and Experts
 
• References
 
• Other support provided by the firm
 
• Work plan
 
• Reports and/or systems that will be supplied to you
 
• Fees, expenses, and schedules of payment
 
• Any inputs required from you
	
3.	 Clearly explain your desired outcomes.
	
	 Prepare a concise brief that clearly defines the objectives, scope, time 
frame, reporting procedure, and constraints of the project and provide 
this brief to your top three consultant prospects to use as they prepare 
their proposals. Remember that the cheapest price won’t necessarily 
give you the best value for your money and that consultant fees may be 
negotiable.
	
4.	 Interview your top consultant candidates.
	
	 Successful consulting requires goodwill in human communications. 
Meet the consultant who will do the job, and brief him or her well, using 
a written brief and any background information you think is necessary. 
Talk through each proposal with the consultant who submitted it before 
making a final decision to make sure the consultant has addressed all 
your concerns. If you’re not happy with any aspects of the proposal, 
don’t feel pressured to accept it. Continue discussions with the consul­
tants until you reach a full agreement on the proposal. Select the firm or 
individual that you feel has the best qualifications and experience and 
that you feel you can work with comfortably.
	
5.	 Ask for references — and follow up on them.
	
	 After you make your selection, ask the chosen consulting firm or indi­
vidual for names or written references from former clients to verify the 
consultant’s suitability for the assignment.
	
6.	 Sign a written contract and start the assignment.
	
	 This step almost goes without saying, but we’re including it anyway: 
Have your lawyer take a look at the contract before you sign on the 
dotted line.
	
7.	 Keep in touch with your consultant as the project progresses.
	
	 Using consultants effectively demands a commitment of time as well 
as money from clients. Remember that you must keep in touch with 
the progress of the assignment if you want to get the most from it. 
Consultants are likely to be most cost-effective when working on an 
agreed program and time frame. Make sure that you hold regular prog­
ress meetings and that the consultant keeps you fully briefed on prog­
ress against the program.

8.	 Be sure you don’t find any surprises in the final report.
	
	 The consultant’s report is often his or her most tangible deliverable 
(what he or she provides in fulfillment of a contract), but it must be 
in a format that’s beneficial to you. If necessary, ask the consultant to 
produce a draft report so you can review the findings and recommenda­
tions before the final report is produced. The final report should contain 
no surprises.
	
9.	Implement the recommendations, and involve yourself as well as the 
consultant.
	
	 You may need to make arrangements for the consultant to help with 
the implementation. You can do so cost-effectively by involving the 
consultant in regular progress meetings. Get a written fee quotation and 
proposal for any implementation work, even if it follows directly from an 
assignment.
Hiring the right consultant for your business at the right time can mean the 
difference between just getting by and achieving tremendous success.
Working with insurance agents 
and brokers
Not only can you find a dizzying array of different insurance policies and 
programs available to businesses, but you also certainly notice the hundreds 
of insurance companies that offer them. Which company and policy offers 
the best coverage for you? To get an inkling of the answer, you have to exten­
sively research insurance policies and companies — definitely not the best 
use of your time.
A better way to find out what insurance is available (and necessary) for your 
business, and which deals are the best for you, is to use insurance agents and 
brokers. Insurance professionals can save you precious time and money — 
sometimes thousands of dollars — while providing you with the peace of mind 
that comes from knowing your insurance needs are being met.
Not only can a good insurance agent or broker advise you about the type and 
amount of coverage that’s best for your business, but he or she can probably 
also tailor a package that meets your specific needs at reasonable rates. All 
these services are worth their weight in gold to busy home-based business 
owners who have neither an extensive knowledge of insurance and risk man­
agement nor the time to mess with them.

241
 Chapter 11: Using Outside Resources and Experts
	
When choosing an insurance agent for your business, we suggest that you do 
the following:
	
✓	Solicit bids from two or three established agents to see who can deliver 
the lowest price for a specified level of coverage.
	
✓	Evaluate the professional experience and qualifications of prospective 
agents as though you were choosing a new attorney or accountant.
	
✓	Interview prospective agents with an eye toward the same qualities you 
seek in a key employee.
The following steps can help you find the agent or broker who best meets 
your business’s needs:
	
1.	Look for an agent who’s knowledgeable about your industry and who 
regularly works with home-based businesses.
	
	 Different companies have different needs. A wildlife photographer, for 
example, has very different insurance needs than does a home inspec­
tor. And what’s good for a high-tech company may not necessarily be 
right for an online operation or retail outlet. One thing is for sure: No 
one agent can effectively keep up with every different kind of insurance 
for every different type of business.
	
2.	 Ask your friends and business associates for referrals to good agents 
or brokers, check with professional and trade associations, or use an 
online service like 4freequotes.com (www.4freequotes.com), einsur­
ance.com (www.einsurance.com), or Insure.com (www.insure.com).
	
	 Be sure to look for someone who regularly handles accounts of your size 
(many agents and brokers consider one-person businesses too small to 
be worth the “trouble” to service). Expect your agent to add value to 
your enterprise, just as an attorney or accountant does.
	
3.	Choose an agent who’s knowledgeable, dependable, loyal, and effec­
tive at communicating.
	
	 You want the agent to work well for you and know how to expedite 
claims when necessary. Check out the agent’s support structure to make 
sure it’s adequate to handle your account. Visit the agent’s office, and 
meet the people who handle day-to-day operations. Confidence in them 
will increase your confidence in the agent or broker.
Insurance is an important part of every business, and it’ll pay off for you to 
get the best advice possible. Although most home-based businesses never 
have to use their insurance, if you need it — because of an auto accident, fire, 
product-liability lawsuit, or other covered risk — you’ll be glad you have it.

Cashing In on Barter
Bartering means trading goods or services without exchanging money. Even 
though it doesn’t involve a direct money transaction, bartering still has impli­
cations for your cash flow. You may be wondering how home-based busi­
nesses can benefit from bartering. Well, we’re here to tell you!
Taking advantage of bartering
Short on cash but long on time? Then bartering your products and services in 
exchange for the products and services of another business may be just the 
ticket for you and your home-based business. After all, bartering allows you 
to keep more cash in the bank — cash you can use to help grow your own 
business instead of someone else’s. For example, if you need a bookkeeper to 
keep track of your lawn-care business’s financials but don’t want to pay the 
$50-an-hour fee, give bartering a try. Find a bookkeeper who needs lawn care 
on an ongoing basis, and barter your services for the bookkeeper’s.
Here are six tips to keep in mind when you want to take advantage of barter­
ing in your business:
	
✓	Work with a bartering exchange or club as you begin to barter your 
products or services for someone else’s. A bartering exchange or club is 
a company that serves as a clearinghouse for getting barterers together. 
Another way to think of a bartering exchange is as a bank for keeping 
track of barters in terms of barter points, credits, or “dollars,” rather 
than direct barter, in which you swap your service or product for the 
service or product of someone else.
	
✓	Find out as much as you can about your local bartering clubs before 
joining them. Membership in a bartering exchange costs money. 
Besides the initial registration fee, exchanges charge a 12- to 15-percent 
fee per transaction, due in cash. Some exchanges also charge monthly 
fees. You can find local bartering exchanges through one of two barter­
ing organizations: the International Reciprocal Trade Association (IRTA) 
and the National Association of Trade Exchanges. Both have online 
directories that list their member exchanges (www.irta.com and www.
nate.org). IRTA offers a checklist of things to consider before joining a 
bartering exchange. Another way to find out about local bartering clubs 
is through BarterNews magazine (www.barternews.com).
	
✓	Try to find barter partners on craigslist (www.craiglist.org) — for 
which you don’t have to pay any charge — if you don’t want to join 
a bartering exchange. Some Web sites also post a notice that they’ll 
barter.
	
✓	Take into account that barter is considered a form of income and 
has tax consequences. Whether or not you join a bartering exchange, 

243
 Chapter 11: Using Outside Resources and Experts
you must report the fair market value of all the goods and services you 
exchange as income in the year you receive them, but you may deduct 
costs incurred to perform the bartered work. Barter exchanges must 
comply with their own reporting requirements on Form 1099-B for all 
transactions.
	
✓	Beware of scams on the Web, and check out local exchanges as you would 
any other business, using organizations like the Better Business Bureau 
(www.bbb.org). And be sure your barter exchange files the proper tax 
reports. Existing members can tell you whether they’ve been getting 1099s.
	
✓	Be selective about what and how much you barter. Read barter con­
tracts in detail to be sure you have legal recourse if something goes amiss.
Bartering in action
“Barely surviving” is how Gilles Tessier of Moncton, Nova Scotia, described 
himself when he needed to come up with $400 to print flyers for his lawn-care 
and landscaping business. He was beginning the spring with only 14 custom­
ers and a broken-down truck, and he needed more to make a living. During 
this low point, he saw a television news story about a man who had put his 
son through flight school by bartering. Tessier, who had a college degree 
in small-business management, immediately contacted Maritime Barter 
Associates, a local barter exchange, which had grown out of the reorganiza­
tion of a franchised barter operation.
After paying a membership fee of $375, Tessier immediately bartered his 
lawn-care services in exchange for printing and a van to replace his truck. 
Tessier, whose work at North of Eden Landscaping is seasonal, now hires up 
to four employees to help him. During the long Canadian winter, he uses his 
van to pick up and deliver goods for business customers in Canada and down 
the eastern seaboard of the United States. Bartering plays a role in his winter 
work, too: He has gotten his van repaired on the road and hasn’t paid for a 
hotel room in five years.
His barter exchange works as many do. In addition to joining and annual mem­
bership fees, he pays the exchange 10 percent of the value of what he receives 
in barter — in cash. When his services are used, he provides the equivalent 
of 3 percent of his services to the barter exchange. So when Tessier receives 
barter goods or services worth $10,000, he pays the exchange $1,000. If he pro­
vides $1,000 worth of services to an exchange member, the exchange credits 
itself with an additional $30 worth of his lawn care.
About bartering and home-based businesses, Tessier observed, “When you 
first start a business, you have little cash flow. You must depend on your cus­
tomers to pay you on time, and if someone doesn’t, you have to phone to ask 
for payment. In effect, by bartering, I can keep cash in my business by bor­
rowing from other businesses.”

Eluding Scams, Rip-Offs, 
and Other Headaches
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the psychology of scams
▶	Uncovering scams and rip-offs
▶	Researching bogus opportunities
▶	Knowing what to do if you’ve been scammed
W
hen you compare statistics from the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) and the Small Business Administration (SBA), you find that 
the number of people who actually start new businesses nearly equals the 
number of people who are victims of business opportunity scams each year. 
According to the FTC, the average business opportunity scam runs for 12 to 
18 months, cheats from 100 to 150 people, and takes in a total of $3 million.
Unfortunately, very few business opportunity scammers are caught, pros­
ecuted, and punished for their actions — no wonder home-business scams 
are a dime a dozen. And although the media and the government heavily 
publicize those scams that are caught, more than half a million people a year 
continue to fall victim to fraudulent business opportunities year after year. 
Why? This chapter takes a close look at the answer. Here we show you what 
you need to know to separate the real opportunities from the rip-offs.
Investigating the Psychology of Scams
Before we dive into the psychology scammers use to attract their victims, 
you need to understand the external factors that often lead people to buy 
into scams they might otherwise identify as fake. Here are just a few of the 
external reasons why people continue to fall for basic business scams:
	
✓	Although the business world has long been fertile ground for scams, 
cons, and outright fraud, the Internet has made reaching more victims 

246
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
even easier and cheaper for scammers. And seeing how other scammers 
work allows new and old scammers alike to become better at pushing 
the buttons of the desperation and desire so many people have.
	
✓	The recent economic downturn — and the resultant layoffs and job 
losses — has made an increasing number of people desperate to make 
money any way possible. This desperation makes them prime targets for 
scammers.
	
✓	Most scam victims don’t complain about being victimized. Some are 
embarrassed; others regard collecting “business opportunities” like a 
crapshoot (the “maybe this one will work” mentality). And a few, despite 
the experience they have and the warnings they read and hear, believe 
that if an opportunity were really bad, the government would’ve closed 
it down.
	
✓	Despite hotlines and Web sites where potential victims can check out busi­
ness opportunity vendors, many, if not most, scams never get listed — and 
often by the time they do, the scams’ perpetrators have changed their 
names or moved on to new scams.
As a result of these external factors, many people find it hard to tell whether 
a promising opportunity is real or fake. To complicate matters even more, 
scammers often have a very accurate perception of what potential victims 
are thinking, and thus, what they can do to reel them into their scams. 
They’re well aware of the countless people out there who will happily (and 
blindly) trade their hard-earned cash for big promises.
To get their victims to buy into their schemes, scammers use a variety of dif­
ferent methods, which we describe in detail in the “Sniffing Out Scams” sec­
tion. Regardless of the method used, scammers rely on the same traits to get 
people to fall for scams. According to a recent report by researchers at the 
University of Exeter School of Psychology, these traits are:
	
✓	Appeals to trust and authority: People tend to obey authorities, so 
scammers use — and victims fall for — cues that make their offers look 
legitimate because they’re supposedly made by reliable official institu­
tions or established reputable businesses.
	
✓	Visceral triggers: Scams exploit basic human desires and needs (such 
as greed, fear, avoidance of physical pain, or the desire to be liked) to 
provoke intuitive reactions and to reduce the motivation people have 
to process the content of the scam messages deeply. For example, 
scammers use triggers that make potential victims focus on the huge 
prizes or benefits they offer instead of on the potential downsides of the 
“opportunities.”
	
✓	Scarcity cues: Scammers often personalize their scams to create the 
impression that their offers are unique to their recipients. They also 
emphasize the urgency of a response to reduce the potential victim’s 
motivation to process the scam content objectively — the old “this offer 
expires tomorrow” approach.

247
 Chapter 12: Eluding Scams, Rip-Offs, and Other Headaches
	
✓	Induction of behavioral commitment: To draw in their potential 
victims, scammers ask them to make small steps of compliance and, 
thereby, cause victims to feel committed to continue sending money. 
These small steps undoubtedly add up to big steps (and big scams!).
	
✓	Disproportionate relationship between the size of the alleged reward 
and the cost of trying to obtain it: Scammers often lead victims to focus 
on the alleged big prize or reward in comparison to the relatively small 
amount of money they have to send to obtain their windfall. The high-
value rewards (often medically, financially, emotionally, or physically 
life changing) that scam victims think they’ll receive by responding to 
the scammers’ requests make the money they have to pay look rather 
small by comparison. In fact, victims often don’t consider refusal an 
option.
	
✓	Lack of emotional control: Compared to nonvictims, scam victims 
report being less able to regulate and resist emotions associated with 
scam offers. Victims seem to be unduly open to persuasion, or perhaps 
unduly undiscriminating about whom they allow to persuade them. This 
lack of control creates an extra vulnerability in people who are socially 
isolated because social networks often act to induce people to regulate 
their emotions when they otherwise might not.
	
As the old saying goes, “Awareness is the first step to change.” Scammers are 
pros at pushing people’s buttons and getting them to drop their defenses. 
However, by being aware of your own behavior and how you respond when 
presented with a bogus business opportunity, you can figure out how to resist 
it. Knowledge is power, and the more you know about yourself, the more 
power you have.

Well, it’s a scam. If you thought the ad was real, don’t lose all hope, yet. We 
believe you can avoid becoming just another unhappy statistic if you take the 
following actions when you read an ad like the above example:
	
1.	 Temper the enthusiasm with a large helping of restraint in the face of 
a business opportunity that sounds “too good to be true” — it proba­
bly is. As Professor Barry Commoner once famously observed, “There is 
no such thing as a free lunch.” Of course, the meals served by scammers 
aren’t free; they’re out to take your money. Before agreeing to anything, 
ask yourself if the opportunity promises high financial reward for little 
or no effort. If so, the opportunity deserves your very close scrutiny 
because it’s likely a scam.
	
2.	 Be alert to red flags. This ad had plenty of them. In the sections that 
follow, you find out how to identify red flags — the warning signs that 
something isn’t quite right — that should lead you to pay extra-special 
attention to a seemingly reputable opportunity. Then you have to take 
the time to thoroughly check out the red flags before you shell out your 
hard-earned money.
The following sections highlight some of the most common ways people lose 
their money to false opportunities and outright scams.

249
 Chapter 12: Eluding Scams, Rip-Offs, and Other Headaches
Job-at-home red flags
Yes, this book is all about self-employment, but we have to point out some 
warning signs for you to look for if you’re tempted to seek hourly or salaried 
work at home based on an ad.
	
Here are the red flags you need to look out for as you consider any job-at-
home opportunity:
	
✓	The company charges a fee for job listings or a job directory and doesn’t 
promise a refund if you don’t find work.
	
✓	The opportunity includes a previously undisclosed government job. All 
federal jobs must be advertised, and state and local governments typi­
cally have a similar requirement.
	
✓	The opportunity involves envelope stuffing or coupon clipping.
	
✓	Your gut tells you something isn’t right.
For examples of other job-at-home scams, go to the Federal Trade 
Commission’s Web site (www.ftc.gov), and search job at home.
	
If you’re seeking fill-in work while you’re developing your business or during a 
slack time, consider bidding for project work on such sites as www.elance.
com and www.guru.com instead of falling prey to job-at-home scams.
Business opportunity red flags
Any “formula” business you buy is a business opportunity, but certain types — 
multi-level marketing and franchises — have special characteristics. Although 
many, if not most, business opportunities are indeed legitimate, the ones that 
solicit you are suspect. When you find a business opportunity that interests you, 
research it thoroughly to determine whether it’s a legitimate opportunity — and 
whether it’s a fit for you — before you invest your hard-earned time and money 
in it.
	
Here are the red flags you need to look out for as you consider any business 
opportunity:
	
✓	You’re told that you won’t have to sell, that the product sells itself, or 
that it’s “easy work.”
	
✓	You’re pressured to make an immediate decision to buy into the busi­
ness opportunity.
	
✓	The earnings claims sound too good to be true.
	
✓	You’re discouraged from letting an attorney review contracts or other 
materials.

250
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
	
✓	For whatever reason, you can’t talk to prior investors in the business 
opportunity.
	
✓	You never get a live person when you call the company’s phone number, 
you get only an answering machine, and the company’s address is a 
post-office box.
	
✓	The Web site or seller sells many different kinds of “biz ops” and isn’t 
someone who actually does or has done this business himself.
	
✓	You live in one of the 26 states that require registration of business oppor­
tunities (Alaska, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South 
Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin), 
and the business opportunity isn’t registered. However, many states 
have thresholds, like $500, before a business opportunity must be regis­
tered. Some scam operators take advantage of this exception — and you 
guessed it — price the business op at $495 or some other number that 
enables them to avoid registration.
	
✓	Testimonials use only people’s initials, or they use names that aren’t 
listed in directories like www.switchboard.com and www.anywho.
com. Legitimate businesses want to be listed; they aren’t hiding out.
	
✓	Your gut tells you something’s wrong.
Franchise red flags
Most franchises are legitimate because the amount of money and legal com­
pliance involved in offering a franchise is substantial; however, just because 
they’re legitimate doesn’t mean they’re good investments.
Even with “good” franchises, serious disputes sometimes arise between the 
franchisees and the franchisors. As we discuss in Chapter 2, the law requires 
that the franchisor give the franchisee a detailed disclosure statement, called 
the Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC). However, this documentation 
does you no good unless you verify everything asserted in it and have the 
contract reviewed by an attorney who is qualified to do franchise work.
	
Here are the red flags you need to look out for as you consider any franchising 
opportunity:
	
✓	The franchise has been around for fewer than five years. You’re most 
apt to be successful with a franchise that was in business for five years 
before it was franchised — and then has been franchised for five years.

251
 Chapter 12: Eluding Scams, Rip-Offs, and Other Headaches
	
✓	You don’t receive a copy of the disclosure documents required by law 
the first time you meet, or you’re told you don’t need to read them.
	
✓	A list of current franchisees doesn’t exist or is curiously short.
	
✓	You’re pressured into signing a franchise agreement without having it 
thoroughly vetted by your attorney.
	
✓	You feel that the focus of the franchisor is on selling you a franchise. A 
good franchisor doesn’t necessarily assure that you’re qualified. Instead, 
a good franchisor searches for the right person to add to his organization.
	
✓	The franchisor is new to the business but not new to franchising — or 
the franchisor is new to the business and new to franchising.
	
✓	Your gut tells you that something’s wrong, or any of the red flags for 
business opportunities are present, such as claims of making big profits 
from a small amount of work.
Direct-selling and multi-level 
marketing red flags
More than 90 percent of the individuals who work in direct-selling programs 
do so part time, mostly because less than 2 percent of direct sellers in most 
organizations do well enough to produce a full-time income. Regardless, the 
promise of fast (and big!) riches draws a constant stream of people to direct 
selling.
The reality of the situation, however, is that few people make much money. 
As disenchanted individuals drop out of the system, established distributors 
feel intense pressure to find and sign up new recruits — recruits just like you!
But keep in mind that the direct-selling business has stellar performers out 
there, too — people like Bea Sherzer in Fern Park, Florida, who extols the 
benefits of the health products she sells. “They improved my health so much 
that everyone began asking me about them,” Bea told us. “This was the best 
thing that ever happened to me.”
	
Unless you’re thoroughly sold on the products you’re trying to sell and are 
good at recruiting and selling, which most people aren’t, don’t expect significant 
earnings. In 2006, for example, Quixtar (since renamed Amway Global) — the 
Internet marketing arm of Amway’s parent company, Alticor — was one of the 
few companies that reported distributor earnings. (It does so because of a court 

252
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
settlement many years ago.) The company reported that its typical distributors 
earned $115 a month, from which they had to pay their own overhead costs, 
including training, samples, and selling materials. As you can see, even for a big 
player in the direct-selling market such as Amway Global, the vast majority of 
distributors aren’t exactly getting rich quick.
Sometimes we meet home-business owners who, trying to supplement their 
income from a principal business that isn’t producing the earnings they want, 
take on a direct-selling company “on the side.” Rarely does this attempt work 
unless it’s a natural fit, such as a chiropractor selling supplements to his or 
her patients.
If you think you’re being hustled or pressured to sign up for a direct-selling pro­
gram before you have a chance to thoroughly check it out, including time to use 
the products or services, take a step back. The opportunity will be there when 
you feel enthusiastic and comfortable about what you’ll be selling — if the com­
pany is still around (direct-selling companies have a high mortality rate).
	
Here are the red flags you need to look out for as you consider a particular 
direct-selling opportunity:
	
✓	You’re told that you can achieve great success without having to actu­
ally sell anything.
	
✓	You don’t receive the name of the company until after you listen to a 
canned sales pitch.
	
✓	You’re required or pressured to buy inventory. You should be able to 
get started with a kit costing less than $100 and never more than $500.
	
✓	The company doesn’t specifically agree to buy back any of your unsold 
inventory.
	
✓	The direct-selling company isn’t a member of the Direct Selling 
Association (www.dsa.org). To belong to this association, companies 
agree to a code of ethics and have been in business for at least two years.
	
✓	Your gut tells you that something’s wrong.
	
Keep in mind that if a direct-selling opportunity is a legitimate one, it won’t 
go away overnight. (Almost nine out of ten direct-selling companies don’t last 
five years.) And if an opportunity does disappear quickly, you’re better off not 
having invested your time or credibility with the people you contact, so take 
the time to thoroughly check out any company you’re considering. The time 
you spend now is an investment in your future that will pay for itself many 
times down the road.

Finally, Be Wary of . . .
Aside from the tried-and-true scams we describe in the preceding sections, 
plenty of new and innovative ones are popping up every day. Be extra cau­
tious about the following new approaches to separate you from your hard-
earned cash:
	
✓	Online shills: Shills are people who pose as satisfied customers to dupe 
others into buying a product or service. They often post messages in 
Internet forums and discussion groups, describing others as frauds 
while extolling their own companies and making false claims about their 
earnings.
	
✓	Due-diligence sites: These sites promise to differentiate honest business 
opportunities from frauds — either for free or for a fee — but, like shills, 
they actually denigrate the competition while extolling the benefits of 
the companies they’re involved in (often on the sly).
	
✓	Bogus escrow sites: These third-party sites aren’t always easy to iden­
tify because they may use fake logos and graphics from verification ser­
vices like “VeriSign” and confusingly similar names. If you’re purchasing 
something and you can only use a foreign payment service — not a rec­
ognized service like PayPal — or you’re asked to pay in advance, beware 
because you’re likely dealing with a bogus payment site. Use the list of 
places to check that we provide you in the “Places to Check” section of 
this chapter to help you spot the frauds.
Popular home-business scams
At the time this edition was being written, 
BusinessWeek magazine ran an article listing 
the ten most popular home-business scams 
as recently reported by the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC). We mention some of these 
scams elsewhere in this chapter, but here’s the 
complete list:
	✓	ATM machines: Although ATM machine 
opportunities seem to be naturally born 
moneymakers on the surface, the problem 
is that ATM scammers either never deliver 
the machines after they take thousands of 
your hard-earned dollars or promise highly 
profitable locations that ultimately turn out 
to be anything but.
	✓	Envelope stuffing: In a typical envelope-
stuffing scam, the scammer sells the 
envelope-stuffing “opportunity” to an 
unsuspecting buyer for a fee. To make 
money, the buyer has to turn around and 
resell the “opportunity” to as many people 
as possible. In this classic pyramid scheme, 
you can make money only by selling the 
opportunity, not by actually doing any work 
or delivering any products or services.
	✓	Product assembly: Although scammers 
assert that you’ll make good money assem­
bling magnets or jewelry or other items for 
their companies, you rarely do. You first 
have to pay a fee for the materials used — 
which often arrive in poor or unusable

Part III: Avoiding Problems 
Places to Check
Unfortunately, most people don’t lodge complaints about being victimized 
by scams and rip-offs with official agencies, so you won’t find an all-
encompassing list containing every scam you can fall victim to. Even so, 
you should check out the following resources before signing up with any 
company you consider doing business with:
	
✓	Better Business Bureau (BBB), as well as the local BBB office in the com­
munity where the seller is located (www.bbb.org)
condition — and then the scammers inevi­
tably refuse to pay for the items you actu­
ally do assemble, citing their poor quality (if 
they respond at all).
	✓	Internet kiosks: After paying thousands 
of dollars to buy an Internet kiosk, buyers 
either never receive the promised product, 
or, if they do, they find that their kiosk is 
located in a location that generates far less 
revenue than the scammer promised. (As 
you can see, this scam is very similar to the 
ATM scam.)
	✓	Internet storefronts: In this scam, sellers 
promise to set you up with an affiliate mar­
keting Web site that will generate money 
without actually selling any products — for 
a fee, of course. Unfortunately, you pay the 
fee, but your scam Internet storefront does 
nothing.
	✓	Medical billing: Although not all medical-
billing opportunities are scams by any 
means, if someone tries to sell you a list of 
medical-billing leads (in other words, doc­
tors who supposedly are dying to enlist your 
services), think twice before you spend the 
money. Many such lists are actually scams.
	✓	Multi-level marketing: As we mention else­
where in this chapter, not all multi-level 
marketing opportunities are scams. Avon, 
for example, is a completely legitimate 
company. However, when a multi-level 
marketing opportunity sounds too good to 
be true, it probably is.
	✓	Pay phones: Although you may have 
thought pay phones had gone the way of 
the dinosaur, apparently a lot of scam­
mers make money by selling expensive pay 
phones and pay phone locations — and 
then not delivering.
	✓	Rack displays: Scammers who run this 
scam tell you that you can make big money 
selling greeting cards, jewelry, or other trin­
kets on a display rack set up in a business 
in your community — say a car wash, book­
store, or bowling alley. In reality, however, 
you pay for the rack and not only do these 
community businesses not want your rack 
in their stores, but even if you get a busi­
ness to put up your rack, the margins are 
so low that you never make any money.
	✓	Vending machines: According to the FTC, 
vending-machine scams are among the 
most common. After paying thousands of 
dollars for vending machines and an inven­
tory of items to fill them, you may or may not 
actually receive the promised machines and 
inventory. And even if you do, you’ll soon 
discover that the opportunity isn’t nearly as 
lucrative as the scammer promised.

✓	Federal Trade Commission (www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov)
	
✓	National Consumers League’s Fraud Center (www.fraud.org)
	
✓	State consumer protection agencies, often located in attorney generals’ 
offices — sometimes called bureaus of consumer protection when located 
in a state agency other than the attorney general’s office (www.
consumeraction.gov/state.shtml)
	
✓	U.S. Postal Service warnings about phony job opportunities and work-at-
home schemes (postalinspectors.uspis.gov)
	
✓	Web search using the company or product name and words like scam 
and fraud
What to Do If You’ve Been Scammed
If you think you’ve been scammed by someone who has sold you a bogus 
business opportunity, act quickly and assertively. Call the salesperson or the 
business from whom you purchased the business opportunity immediately 
to register your complaint and request a complete refund. Also explain that 
you’ll pass on your experience — good or bad — to the proper government 
authorities. If the salesperson or business doesn’t comply with your request 
for a refund, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that you con­
tact the following organizations:
	
✓	Federal Trade Commission (FTC): The FTC works for the consumer 
to prevent fraud and deception. The FTC keeps track of scams and 
scammers — warning the public against the latest ones — and it 
investigates significant scams, following up with the authorities when 
necessary to put the scammers out of business. Call 1-877-FTC-HELP 
(1-877-382-4357) or log on to www.ftc.gov.
	
✓	The attorney general’s office in your state or the state where the com­
pany is located: The office can tell you whether you’re protected by any 
state law that may regulate work-at-home programs.
	
✓	Local consumer protection office: By providing your information to 
such offices, you help them keep track of the latest scams. They can 
then inform the public and help ensure that others don’t fall victim, too.
	
✓	Local better business bureaus: Better business bureaus are a good 
avenue to file a complaint against a company that has scammed you. 
Although they don’t have the power to prosecute cases in court, they do 
maintain listings of businesses and customer feedback. People tend to 
avoid companies with a history of bad feedback.

256
Part III: Avoiding Problems 
	
✓	Local postmaster: The U.S. Postal Service investigates fraudulent mail 
practices, so contact your local postmaster if any of your correspon­
dence with the scammer passed through the U.S. Mail. Postal inspectors 
will then open a case against the scammer, which could potentially lead 
to the arrest and prosecution of the offender.
	
✓	Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): If the scam was perpetrated via 
the Internet, you need to file a complaint with the federal government’s 
IC3 at www.ic3.gov. Doing so provides additional data for the IC3 and — 
if the problem is significant — may help lead to prosecution of the scam­
mer by a federal court.
	
✓	The advertising manager of the publication that ran the advertise­
ment: The manager may be interested to find out about the problems 
you’ve had with the company. If he or she finds out about a problem, the 
publication may decide to no longer accept such advertising from the 
offending party.
Depending on the situation, you may also consider filing a police report, noti­
fying local media (newspaper, radio, and television reporters), and taking the 
scammers to court. You have to decide for yourself how far to take the issue.
	
Despite the scammers and the clever ways in which they snare unsuspecting 
buyers as well as people with experience, thousands of people find their way 
to successful, legitimate self-employment through formula businesses: fran­
chises, business opportunities, and direct sales. If you find the right match, 
you can save yourself weeks and months of time by putting someone else’s 
business model to work for you. You just have to check out your potential 
opportunities carefully before you hand over your cash.
Network marketing over the Internet
Q: What do you think of direct selling or network 
marketing, especially over the Internet?
A: Network marketing is part of the direct-
selling industry, and the Internet certainly plays 
a role in network marketing, though its role is 
small compared to that of face-to-face sales, 
which account for three out of four network-
marketing sales. The most recent statistics 
from the Direct Selling Association indicate 
that 11.4 percent of direct sales are made over 
the Internet. So you can see that most net­
work marketers still rely on the old-fashioned 
method of meeting face to face to make sales 
and recruit people into a downline.
However, you can use the Internet to help 
improve and increase your network marketing. 
For example, use social networks, particularly 
Facebook, to make yourself known and to rees­
tablish relationships with people who may end up 
becoming customers or coming into your down­
line. Set up a Web site and e-mail to help sup­
port your downline, too — just know that people 
active on social networks seem to respond more 
quickly than people who use only regular e-mail. 
In naming your Web site, make sure your domain 
name doesn’t duplicate or infringe on the name 
of the direct-selling company.

257
 Chapter 12: Eluding Scams, Rip-Offs, and Other Headaches
Another way to attract participants in your 
downline online is to actively participate in 
social networking groups and online forums, 
answering questions and offering advice that 
earns people’s trust and interest.
Through network marketing, you can find out 
about the skills needed to operate a business, 
such as selling, managing time, and keeping 
yourself motivated in the face of rejection. In 
this sense, network marketing can be a good 
training experience based on the help and 
strength of your upline. Although such skills 
are primarily “offline” ones, with every passing 
year, more and more of what you do in life and 
in business involves connecting to the Web.

selling and network marketing at www.dsa.

sents the critics of network marketing, go to

veryone has heard about the tremendous opportunities that the Internet 
has opened up for businesses of all sizes, shapes, and locations. Today 
even the smallest home-based business — located in the most remote loca­
tion in the country (can anyone say Nome, Alaska?) — can sell its products 
and services to a worldwide base of customers via the Internet. Whether 
you use an established site like eBay.com or Amazon.com to reach potential 
customers, you reach out using social networking tools, such as Twitter or 
Facebook, or you create your own Web site or blog, today it’s easier than 
ever to make the Web work for you.
But guess what? A lot of other businesses are trying to get noticed, too, and 
they’re all trying to sell their own products and services — some of which 
may be exactly the same products and services you plan to sell. The good 
news is that you don’t have to become a huge company to take advantage 
of the Internet — the costs of getting set up on the Web are quite affordable 
for most home-based business owners. In fact, many small, home-based busi­
nesses are doing quite well selling their products and services via the Web. 
And you can, too.
In this chapter, we explore how to use the Internet to bid for work and how to 
get listed and noticed in online directories. We explore the best approaches 
and places for networking with others on the Net and explain how to use 
social networking tools to your advantage. Finally, we consider the best ways 
to attract clients and customers with your Web site.

Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
Bidding for Work Online
Something interesting has been happening on the Internet over the past 
several years — a number of freelance bidding sites have sprung up with 
the express purpose of getting independent, home-based businesspeople 
together with companies (including other independent, home-based busi­
nesses) that need work done. Although some of these sites may be scams 
(see Chapter 12 for more about those), more than a few of them offer legiti­
mate opportunities to at-home workers.
In this section, we take a look at what you need to know to use the Internet to 
leverage your own business opportunities.
Taking advantage of sites that bring 
buyers and sellers together
So what exactly is a freelance bidding site? A freelance bidding site is a Web 
site where companies can list jobs they need done (anything from writing 
advertising copy to building Web sites to doing graphic design), and freelanc­
ers can bid on the work. The company needing the work selects a freelancer 
and assigns the work, the selected freelancer does the work and pays the bid­
ding site a commission (usually between 5 and 10 percent), and everyone is 
happy.
	
In general, follow these steps to take advantage of freelance bidding sites:
	
1.	Visit the bidding site of your choice and register.
	
2.	Build your online résumé by adding your particular skills and experi­
ence to the site. Be specific!
	
3.	Conduct a search for projects that are suited to your experience.
	
	 Look beyond the main categories and dig deeply into the subcategories 
and specialties.
	
4.	Bid on a project by providing an estimate of the price for the job and 
your time frame for completion.
	
5.	Negotiate a deal with an interested company.
	
6.	Do the work and get paid.

263
 Chapter 13: Making the Web Work for You
For someone with the right skills, using a freelance bidding site can be a 
relatively easy way to develop an ongoing stream of work that may be quite 
lucrative. You have plenty of freelance bidding sites to choose from, but be 
sure to check out these sites first:
	
✓	www.scriptlance.com
	
✓	www.smarterwork.com
	
✓	www.ework.com
	
✓	www.elance.com
	
✓	www.crowdspring.com
For a very comprehensive (and up-to-date) listing of legitimate freelance bid­
ding sites, go to www.freelancemom.com/gigs.htm.
Figuring out how to win bids
You may be very well qualified in whatever it is you do, and you may have 
tons of experience and skills out the wazoo. But guess what? You’re not alone. 
Countless other people have just as much experience — maybe more — and 
you’ll undoubtedly have to compete with some of them when you bid on a 
project, which means you have to sharpen your pencil and bid to win.
	
Here are ten tips on how to win your dream project:
	
✓	Become intimately familiar with how the freelance bidding site you’re 
using works.
	
✓	Make your profile first-rate. In it, show your background in the field; 
your education, training, and credentials; the services you offer; and the 
range of your rates. If you need help writing your profile, consider post­
ing it as a job on one of the freelance boards and hiring a writer to help 
you. You’ll experience firsthand what it’s like to receive bids and what 
impresses you about the bidders.
	
✓	Create an online portfolio with samples of your work. What a photogra­
pher or graphic designer uses as samples is fairly obvious, but even if 
you’re a consultant, showing potential clients what you’ve done is still 
worthwhile. One way to do so is to post testimonials from customers 
declaring how great it was to work with you. To avoid cluttering up your 
profile, create your portfolio elsewhere — for example on your own Web 
site — and provide a link to it from your profile page.
	
✓	Demonstrate that you have the skills and tools needed to do the job. 
So if you’re seeking virtual-assistant-type work and you’re certified in 
Microsoft Office Certification, say so. Don’t be shy — show the buyer 
everything you have to offer. You probably have only one shot, so make 
it the best possible.

264
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
	
✓	Don’t place your bids automatically or base them on guesswork. Ask 
good questions of the company or person seeking bids. Often, the 
posted work descriptions are too sketchy or leave too many gaps. Just 
as you don’t want to overbid and lose a good job, you don’t want to 
underbid and win a job that you later find out requires more work than 
you originally anticipated.
	
✓	Do some market research; check to see what your competitors are bid­
ding for the kind of work you want to do. Remember that you’re compet­
ing against bidders from all over the world, many of whom can and will 
underbid the prices most North Americans can charge. But keep in mind 
wary buyers are apt to be just as suspicious of extremely low bids as 
they are turned off by high ones.
	
✓	Propose payment schedules that will show you’re motivated to get the 
work done in a timely manner, such as asking for a relatively low initial 
down payment of 20 or 25 percent with progress payments based on 
agreed-on milestones.
	
✓	Go into more depth on your own Web site or blog than you can on your 
profile. Profile portfolios can be too long, taxing buyers with too much 
to look at. Remember: They’re reviewing other bidders’ profiles and 
portfolios, too. If you interest them on your profile, they’ll want to know 
more about you and will dig more deeply.
	
✓	If you’re using Elance, consider becoming a Select Service provider. 
Doing so improves the positioning of your bid and assures your pros­
pects that your credentials have been verified.
	
✓	If at first you don’t succeed . . . learn from your experience and try again!
Keeping clients and building 
your business with them
The best business relationships are long-term business relationships. Believe 
us: A bird in hand is definitely worth two or three in the bush. It’s a general 
rule that your best clients are your current clients. Whenever possible, work 
to build strong relationships with your current clients and customers that 
will keep them coming back to you many years into the future.
	
Here are some tips for keeping your clients happy and building long-term busi­
ness relationships:
	
✓	Be on time and on budget. No client likes to hire someone who delivers 
the products or services late or who wants more money to do the work 
than originally quoted.
	
✓	Do great work. Great work speaks for itself, and it separates you from 
the home-based business wannabes.

265
 Chapter 13: Making the Web Work for You
	
✓	Be flexible. Business today takes place faster than ever, and companies 
must be able to change direction at a moment’s notice to keep up. So be 
flexible and ready to change accordingly.
	
✓	Be dependable and reliable. Be someone your client can rely on 
through thick and thin — if you are, you’ve already got most of your 
competition beat.
	
✓	Don’t surprise your client with bad news. Keep your client informed if 
you anticipate problems or delays — no matter what they are.
Getting Listed in Directories
Back in the good old pre-Internet days, if you were a small business and you 
wanted to attract customers or clients — especially if you ran your business 
out of your home or some other nonstorefront location — one of the first 
things you had to do was run an ad in the Yellow Pages. Having a listing in 
the Yellow Pages was essential for many kinds of businesses, especially ser­
vice businesses, such as plumbers, building contractors, tree trimmers, and 
many others.
Although the Yellow Pages aren’t obsolete yet (Peter’s copy hits the recycle 
bin within minutes after its arrival each year), there’s a new directory on 
the block: the online directory. In this section, we explore some of the most 
common versions of this new business tool.
Online business directories
Online business directories — the electronic successors to the old-fashioned 
paper Yellow Pages — are all over the Internet today. Like anything else in 
life, some are better than others. Here are a few of the best:
	
✓	directory.google.com
	
✓	search.yahoo.com/dir
	
✓	www.dmoz.org
	
✓	www.alibaba.com
	
✓	www.bizweb.com
	
✓	www.abusinessresource.com
	
✓	www.industrialquicksearch.com
	
✓	www.businesspatrol.com/directory/
	
✓	www.b2btoday.com

266
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
You can get your site placed on any number of online directories, but our 
advice is to stick with the top ones — that is, the ones that get the most traf­
fic and the ones specifically targeted to your kind of business (for example, 
a directory of landscape architects isn’t the best place for you to list your 
eldercare business). Seek out the top-notch directories in your field, and 
apply to have your Web site listed. You may have to follow up to make sure 
that your site really gets listed and that the listing information is correct. 
After you have a correct listing in the prominent directories, don’t forget to 
promote your listing. Be persistent if you need to be — it’s your business 
we’re talking about here.
Association memberships
Do you belong to an association? For example, if you’re a graphic artist, you 
may belong to the Graphic Artists Guild (www.graphicartistsguild.org) 
or the Society of American Graphic Artists (saga.monmouth.edu). Or you 
may belong to your local chamber of commerce or a community-based busi­
ness association. Whatever your affiliations are, one of the fringe benefits of 
belonging to many associations is the opportunity to be listed in their online 
member directories.
Go to the Graphic Artists Guild Web site, for example, and you can look at 
not only a listing of association members, but samples of their work as well, 
organized by practice: cartooning, graphic design, package design, and so 
forth. Many associations include such samples to showcase the work of their 
members — all the better for a potential client who’s looking for a certain 
style of artwork.
If you don’t yet belong to an association, consider joining one and getting 
listed in its online directory. If you already belong, make sure to take advan­
tage of all the promotional and networking activities your association has to 
offer, including being listed in its online directory.
	
One more thing: If anything changes in your business, such as your phone 
number, Web site, or e-mail address, remember to submit updates to all your 
online directories to keep your listings current.
Local directories and review sites
The problem with many online search engines and directories is that they 
include the whole world when you just want to attract customers in your 
small town in Saskatchewan. In response to this issue, some search engines, 
directories, and business review sites are creating services that focus on 
local offerings. When you use a local directory to do a search for a specific 

267
 Chapter 13: Making the Web Work for You
kind of business — say, an aquarium or bookkeeping service — you can 
specify a city and state in which to search, thus providing results that are 
much more relevant and useful than what you’d get if the entire world were 
included in the search.
Here are some of the most popular local directories:
	
✓	www.yellowpages.com
	
✓	www.yelp.com
	
✓	www.citysearch.com
	
✓	www.local.yahoo.com
	
✓	www.jumptoyourcity.com
	
✓	www.insiderpages.com
	
✓	referrals.respond.com
	
✓	www.yell.com (Great Britain)
Again, follow up after you apply for your listing to make sure your business 
is indeed listed. As soon as your listing goes live, be sure to check the 
information — business name, address, phone number, e-mail address, 
Web site — for accuracy.
Networking the Internet Way
There’s more to getting noticed online than just putting up a Web site and 
waiting for the crowds to arrive. You can also make a splash — while driv­
ing traffic to your own site — by personally getting noticed on other people’s 
Web sites. If you have a particularly lively personality, or if you’re knowledge­
able and enjoy giving advice to others (in a polite way, of course) you may 
soon find yourself a very popular fixture on many different Web sites — not 
just your own. In this section, we cover the most common networking tools 
currently available online.
	
Truth be told, you can choose from a bazillion and one ways to use online net­
working to promote your home-based business. However, when using the vari­
ous networking tools we describe in this section, you have to be careful not to 
get so caught up in sending Twitter messages or updating your Facebook page 
that you run out of time to take care of your current customers and clients, 
or to do the other kinds of marketing you need to do to keep a steady stream 
of new customers and clients walking through your door. Be sure to test the 
results of your networking efforts regularly. If you find that they aren’t result­
ing in enough new business to be worth their while, quickly move on to some­
thing else.

268
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
The real beauty of making the Web work for you is that you can quickly, 
easily, and inexpensively change your approach — literally in just minutes. 
So, if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again — with a new and different 
approach, of course!
Discovering the benefits of online forums
Today you can find online forums devoted to just about every conceivable 
hobby, business, activity, and avocation imaginable: parenting; steam trains; 
TiVo digital video recorders; vintage Jeeps; genealogy; politics; personal 
finance and investing; math; freedom; children book writing; scrapbooking; 
and much, much more. If you can imagine it, someone probably already has a 
forum on it.
Here’s how one home-based business owner networks with potential custom­
ers through an online forum:
Doug Roccaforte is the founder and owner of Roccaforte Amps (www.
roccaforteamps.com), a Brea, California–based manufacturer of high-
end electric guitar amplifiers used by professional musicians, such as 
Marc Ford, Ben Harper, Cesar Rosas, and many others. Sure, Doug could 
be content attending trade shows, developing his dealer network, and 
placing advertisements in guitar magazines, but he also chooses to spend 
time on the Amps discussion forum at www.harmony-central.com, 
which is likely the most popular guitar-amplifier forum on the Internet. 
Doug is a very well-known and popular regular there. Not only is he a 
colorful personality — with strong opinions and a wry sense of humor — 
but he’s also respected by forum members as one of today’s greatest and 
most knowledgeable guitar-amplifier designers and manufacturers. The 
fact that he spends time on the site and is willing to give his advice and 
opinions about topics of interest to forum members keeps his products 
front and center in their minds and develops a buzz that no amount of 
advertising alone could buy, leading to lots of additional sales — sales 
that wouldn’t occur without Doug’s presence on the forum.
What sites and forums are devoted to topics that relate to your products or 
services? Seek them out, become a member, and begin contributing. For a rel­
atively small investment of your time, you’ll definitely see a positive impact 
on your bottom line.
You can find lists of forums and newsgroups on Google’s Group directory site 
(groups.google.com) and the Yahoo! Groups site (groups.yahoo.com). 
Joining forums is easy, but remember to honor the unique etiquette for each 
group you join (see the “Making winning relationships the right way” section 
for more on the etiquette of networking online).

269
 Chapter 13: Making the Web Work for You
Many trade and professional associations have forums; some associations 
open them up to nonmembers. You can find listings of many of these asso­
ciations at the ASAE (American Society of Association Executives) and the 
Center for Association Leadership Web site (www.asaecenter.org), where 
the group provides its “Gateway to Associations” searchable directory as a 
service to the public.
Souping up your social networking
Social networking sites — Web sites devoted to creating networks and com­
munities of new friends and acquaintances — are a relatively recent phenom­
enon. As members continue to join these sites, they bring along their own 
networks of family and friends, quickly creating large online social networks, 
some linked by common interests (such as business) and some linked by 
who knows what.
In recent years, social networking has become all the rage as businesses of all 
shapes and sizes scramble to establish a meaningful presence on social Web 
sites dedicated to this purpose. Here are the current top ten social network­
ing sites:
	
✓	www.facebook.com
	
✓	www.myspace.com
	
✓	www.twitter.com
	
✓	www.flixster.com
	
✓	www.linkedin.com
	
✓	www.tagged.com
	
✓	www.classmates.com
	
✓	www.myyearbook.com
	
✓	www.livejournal.com
	
✓	www.imeem.com
Although the chances of developing serious business by participating in 
social networking sites are more remote than by participating in forums spe­
cific to your expertise or business, giving them a try may be worth your time 
to make your presence known.

270
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
Bankrate.com (www.bankrate.com) offers the following five best ways for 
small businesses (including home-based businesses) to use social networking 
sites to their advantage:
	
✓	Use free sites. Use free online services, such as Twitter and popular 
networking sites like Facebook and LinkedIn, to post significant news, 
specials, or events.
	
✓	Shift marketing costs to social media. After figuring out how social 
networking operates, use social media to free up traditional marketing 
dollars for your small business by putting it online. You can quickly 
determine which of your Facebook or MySpace “friends” or online 
“group” members received and responded to your message.
	
✓	Do your own social-media optimization project. Find out about the 
competitors in your industry and geographic region that are tapping in 
to social networking. Start by researching the competition in the major 
search engines — Yahoo! and Google.
	
✓	Take social-network marketing to the next level. Create and post richer 
content about what your customers would expect from someone in your 
business. Don’t view social media sites as a place to simply hype your 
wares — make them a place for conversation.
	
✓	Use blogging to drive search results and help new customers find you. 
The more mentions you and your home-based business get on the Web, 
the more often the search engines will find you. By blogging regularly, 
you create lots of content for the search engines to find when people 
search using terms related to your business.
	
If you belong to multiple social networking sites, check out Ping (ping.fm) 
and Snag (www.dapper.net/dapplications/Snag), which enable you 
to make one entry that’s then transmitted to multiple social networks. These 
sites save you the time of having to make multiple logons.
Making winning relationships 
the right way
Just like you have rules of etiquette for behaving in your offline life, you have 
rules and norms for behaving in online forums and networks. Here are some 
basic rules to follow so that you find yourself a welcome participant rather 
than someone to be avoided (or worse, talked negatively about).
	
✓	Stay on topic. Make a point of posting only messages that are relevant 
to the subject of the forum or network in which you’re participating.

271
 Chapter 13: Making the Web Work for You
	
✓	Include the necessary information. If you’re asking a question of forum 
members, be sure to give them a complete description of what your 
problem or issue is. Doing so helps other readers of the forum deter­
mine a resolution to your issue.
	
✓	Indicate whether you’ve asked your question elsewhere. If you pose 
your question through other channels, such as third-party mailing lists 
and so forth, indicate in your message all the places where you’re post­
ing the question so your question gets answered only once. Doing so 
saves effort and enables forum members to answer your question and 
other people’s questions faster.
	
✓	Be nice. If you want the welcome mat to be out for you, refrain from 
inappropriate language and personal attacks. Remember the first rule of 
karma: What goes around comes around.
	
✓	Choose a descriptive title. A descriptive title helps subsequent visitors 
to the forum successfully identify your topic.
	
✓	Don’t cross-post. Posting a message to more than one forum is unneces­
sary and creates extra traffic for you and others to read through.
	
✓	Don’t quote previous messages. Quote only when absolutely necessary. 
Readers can easily view previous messages in their newsreader when 
needed, so you’re just wasting space — and risking the ire of your forum 
mates — by quoting previous messages.
	
✓	Don’t spam the site! Although most forums and online social networks 
tolerate a small amount of plugging your business, blatant and ongoing 
plugs will incur the wrath of your forum mates. Your best bet is to put 
a brief plug about your business (along with a link to your Web site) in 
your signature, the identifying line or lines tacked to the bottom of your 
messages.
	
✓	Don’t include graphics or other files in the forum posts. Don’t post 
attachments. Most users don’t want to download a file when reading 
your post, for time and security reasons. Just explain your point in writ­
ing and include the URL of the file in your post so others can view it if 
they want to.
	
✓	Don’t duplicate threads. Before posting messages, be sure to familiar­
ize yourself with the forum. If possible, check to make sure your topic 
hasn’t already been addressed in a recent thread — after all, you won’t 
get far by duplicating another recent post.
	
✓	Don’t get too personal. Remember, all messages are public and will be 
viewed by others.
	
✓	Don’t perpetuate off-topic threads. If someone makes an inappropriate 
or spam post, don’t add more noise by replying to the forum. Criticize 
via private message (PM) or e-mail if you must.

Building and Maintaining 
a Blog or Web Site
Okay, so you’ve decided to start your own Web site — congratulations! Now 
what? Well, the first step is to build it. You can either hire someone to do it for 
you or do it yourself. (Peter built his Web site at www.petereconomy.com 
years ago using Microsoft FrontPage. He has since switched to Macromedia 
Dreamweaver and maintains his site himself to this day.)
	
Each approach, of course, has its pluses and minuses. Hiring someone to 
create and maintain your Web site will likely get you the most professional-
looking site, but it may cost a lot of money, and you may have to wait for your 
Webmaster to make site updates for you. A busy Webmaster can take weeks 
to get around to executing your requested updates. If you build your own site, 
on the other hand, you have ultimate control over the site and you’ll likely pay 
less than hiring someone to do it for you. However, the results may look ama­
teurish at best, and, while you’re playing with the software and troubleshoot­
ing the inevitable issues that arise during the site-building process, you may 
get distracted from doing the things you normally do to make money — you 
know, fulfilling customer orders and providing services.
Hiring someone to create and maintain 
your blog or Web site
If you have no interest in creating and maintaining your own Web site or blog, 
plenty of Web site design companies (many of them home-based businesses, 
by the way) would love to design it for you. It probably won’t be cheap — 
anywhere from a couple of hundred dollars for a simple site to thousands for 
a much more complex one — but if you have no interest in learning the ins 
and outs of Web sites yourself (and we can’t blame you if you don’t), hiring 
an expert is clearly the best option.
	
Don’t hire just anyone. Remember: Your site will be the first (and perhaps the 
last) thing that many potential customers and clients see regarding your busi­
ness. Make sure their first impression is a good one.

273
 Chapter 13: Making the Web Work for You
	
Here are a few tips for finding a great Web site designer:
	
✓	Interview Web site designers just as you would a new employee. Get ref­
erences, do interviews, check them out — the whole enchilada.
	
✓	Ask your business acquaintances if they know of anyone who’s good at 
designing Web sites.
	
✓	After you locate some candidates, ask each of them for a list of active 
Web sites that they’ve developed and actively maintain — and then visit 
them on your computer. How do they look? Are they attractive and well 
produced, or are they a turnoff? Are they current and up-to-date, or do 
they look like they haven’t been touched for months?
	
✓	Compare the work of several different designers before deciding. Only 
after you have a chance to fully explore your candidates’ work and com­
pare it with the work of others should you select a Web site designer.
	
✓	Ask how soon your site will be up and running and how much it will 
cost — not just to set it up, but also to periodically maintain it and 
troubleshoot problems.
	
✓	If you see a Web site that knocks your socks off, find out who designed 
it. Sometimes the designer’s name is posted on the site, often at the 
bottom of the home page, but sometimes you need to ask the site owner. 
It’s a good idea to talk with prior clients anyway.
The price to hire someone to build a blog or Web site for you has been 
steadily decreasing as more people learn the skills involved. Now it’s rela­
tively easy to find and engage an affordable (and, probably, home-based) 
Web site designer. Although some prefabricated designs look decent, you 
may find that you can hire a talented Web designer to establish a unique and 
professional-looking Web presence for your business at a price that definitely 
doesn’t break the bank.
Creating a blog or Web site yourself
If you have a basic knowledge of the Internet and how it works, you may 
be able to create your own Web site and have a lot of fun in the process. 
Although building your own site can be a lot of fun, make sure you don’t have 
so much fun that you forget to sell your products and services, too.

274
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
Follow these steps to create a working blog or Web site:
	
1.	Select a Web-hosting service.
	
	 A Web-hosting service sets up your Web site address (or URL), something 
like yourname.com, and then hosts your site on its computers where 
anyone with access to the Web can access it. You have countless Web-
hosting services to choose from, and they vary considerably in price 
and level of service. Thus, it pays to shop around. Most home-based 
businesses can get by with a bare-bones level of service, and you can 
figure on paying around $15 to $25 a month. Before you select a Web-
hosting service, ask around for references, and be sure to visit some of 
the hosted sites to see how well they work. Peter’s personal favorite is 
Dotster (www.dotster.com), but another option is the original Internet 
registrar: Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com). If you’re 
planning to set up a blog, consider such sites as Blogger (www.
blogger.com) or TypePad (www.typepad.com).
	
2.	Build your Web site or blog.
	
	 Some hosting services offer simple, built-in software for creating Web 
sites and blogs as part of their hosting packages. This kind of pack­
age may be all you need to create the site you want, and it’s probably 
the best option if you’re new to all this Internet stuff. However, if your 
needs go beyond what your host provides, consider buying software 
specifically designed for creating Web sites. Microsoft Expression 
Web, Macromedia Dreamweaver, and NetObjects Fusion are powerful 
and simple to use. If you’re building a blog, popular programs include 
Wordpress, Movable Type, and Joomla. In essence, if you can use a 
basic word-processing program, such as Microsoft Word, you can create 
your own Web site or blog. And here’s a news flash: Microsoft Word 
even allows you to save regular text pages as HTML (Hypertext Markup 
Language; the language of the Web) documents. Woo hoo!
	
	 Get free templates for Web sites at freesitetemplates.com, and find 
out more about design standards at www.webstyleguide.com.
	
3.	Maintain your Web site or blog.
	
	 The great thing about creating and maintaining your own Web site or 
blog is that you have full control over the content, as well as when and 
how you update or modify it. Need to add a new product to your list­
ings? In five minutes, you’re done. If you had to go through a hired third 
party, it could take days or even weeks for him or her to make the minor 
update. Google offers a terrific tool — the Google Web site Optimizer — 
which can help you test and improve your site. You’ll find the Optimizer 
at www.google.com/websiteoptimizer. As the site’s administrator, 
you also have direct access to your Web site’s or blog’s statistics: how 
many visitors your site has, who they are, and where they’re coming 
from. Using these statistics, you can find out which of your pages are the 
most and least popular and adjust accordingly.

275
 Chapter 13: Making the Web Work for You

marketing needs, be sure to take a look at Web Marketing For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition, by Jan Zimmerman (Wiley).
Skipping the blog or Web site and 
creating an e-commerce site
You can create an effective store on the Internet without having a Web site 
at all. How? An increasing number of established Web sites, including Yahoo! 
and Amazon.com, have gotten into the business of hosting e-commerce sites 
for other businesses.
Of the current e-commerce providers, one of the best is Yahoo! Merchant 
Solutions (smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce). For only $40 a month 
for a basic plan (plus a one-time setup fee of $50 and a nominal fee — 
currently 1.5 percent — for each transaction), you can get your own online 
storefront up and running in minutes. Your customers can view photos of 
your products, put them into a shopping cart, and pay for their purchases by 
credit card. You have access to an amazingly comprehensive statistics pack­
age (telling you what products are selling best, how much revenue you make 
by item, what sites shoppers are coming from, and much more); plus, you’re 
in good company: Ben & Jerry’s, the Oakland Raiders football team, the 
Lance Armstrong Foundation, American Pearl, and many more all use Yahoo! 
e-commerce sites.
Making your site good regardless 
of who creates it
The following tips can help you create a Web site or blog that attracts and 
holds your clients’ interests and encourages them to send their money 
your way:
	
✓	Be easy to find. Don’t make it difficult for your clients to find you. 
Your URL (www.yourname.com) should be intuitively obvious. If, for 
example, your company’s name is Acme Computer, your URL should be 
something like www.acmecomputer.com. That way, clients (and clients-
to-be) who don’t have your address at their fingertips can easily guess 
it. Also, take the time to register your Web site or blog with the four or 
five most-visited Internet search engines and directories. Referrals from 
these sites — including Yahoo!, Bing, and Google — are a critical link in 
helping people find you. Check out a site called The Art of Business Web 
Site Promotion (www.deadlock.com/promote) for free advice on how 
to work the search engines to your advantage.

276
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
	
	Of course, many domains are already taken, so you may have to settle 
for one that’s longer and a little less direct (like AcmeofSacramento.
com). Or, because many domain names are minimally used, you may 
be able to purchase a domain name you want from its current owner. 
If the domain name you want isn’t being actively used and you’re will­
ing to wait for it to expire, you can back-order the name from a domain 
registration service. Another approach is to come up with a name 
that’s catchy (and readily available), but that says nothing at all about 
what products or services your business sells, such as google.com, 
joomla.com, and squidoo.com. Whatever your approach, put on your 
thinking cap and be creative!
	
✓	Advertise your new address like crazy. Get your address out every­
where, all the time. Include it on your business cards, letterhead sta­
tionery, invoices, marketing brochures, and any other place you can 
possibly fit all those letters and dots.
	
	You may be approached by firms that promise to increase the traffic to 
your Web site. Maybe they will, and maybe they won’t. If you do decide 
to hire a firm to increase traffic, be sure to ask exactly what it plans to 
do to reach the people most likely to buy your products and services 
and what sort of guarantee it offers. Chances are you can do the same 
things on your own and save a lot of money in the process.
	
✓	Give your visitors a reason to visit — and to come back again and 
again. The attention span of the average Web surfer can be measured in 
seconds. If your site is boring, or if it takes too long to load, your client 
or prospect will click out of the site just as quickly as he or she clicked 
in. Take a look at your competitors’ sites to get an idea of what works 
and what doesn’t. Use graphics, photographs, and attractive back­
grounds to make your site look more appealing, but be careful that these 
byte-intensive files don’t dramatically slow the speed at which your Web 
pages load. Above all, provide lots of fresh, value-added content in the 
form of news, reports, articles, surveys, industry trends, networking 
forums, and the like that will keep your clients and prospects coming 
back for more. (See the next section for more tips on how to attract cus­
tomers and clients to your site.)
	
✓	Capture contact information. When people visit your site, they’re prob­
ably not there by accident — they’re there because they’re interested in 
what you have to sell. Take advantage of this opportunity by encourag­
ing your visitors to give you contact information you can use in your 
organization’s marketing and promotional efforts. For example, you can 
set up a guestbook where visitors can leave comments about your site, 
along with their name, title, address, and phone number. Or you can 
offer to mail a complementary copy of your client newsletter to pros­
pects who are willing to give you their contact information. Contests, 
special offers, and surveys are all great ways to encourage your visitors 
to give you their contact information.

277
 Chapter 13: Making the Web Work for You
	
✓	Check Web stats. A good hosting service gives you access to vital sta­
tistics related to your Web site: the number of visitors each day; where 
they’re from; how long they stayed; which pages they viewed; which 
search engine (if any) referred them to your site; and much, much 
more. By analyzing these statistics, you can quickly identify which parts 
of your site attract the most (and the least) visitors and test visitor 
response to site changes on a real-time basis. (Hint: Do more of what 
your visitors like and less of what they don’t.)
	
	If your service provider doesn’t offer a decent statistics package, check 
out Google Analytics (www.google.com/analytics). This free Google 
service is extremely powerful and comprehensive. As Google says, “With 
Google Analytics, you’re more prepared to write better-targeted ads, 
strengthen your marketing initiatives, and create higher converting Web 
sites.” Can’t beat that, can you?
	
✓	Regularly visit your Web site or blog. Make sure it’s working the way 
it’s supposed to. Perhaps you won’t be surprised to hear that some 
hosting services are better than others, and it’s in your best interest 
to make sure your site is on more often than it’s off. The easiest way 
to make a habit of visiting your site is to set it as your browser’s home 
page. That way, it pops up every time you log on to the Internet. And ask 
your friends and family to check it frequently and let you know if they 
run into any problems. If you’re not sure how to change your browser’s 
home page settings, click the Help button.
Using a Blog or Web Site to Attract 
Customers and Clients
Well, you’ve created a Web site or blog; now what? Now you have to figure 
out how to attract attention in the vast, open space that is the Internet. As 
of this writing, more than 111 million domain names (Web site names such 
as dummies.com and pathwaystotransition.com) are currently in use, 
many of which have their own functioning business, special-interest, per­
sonal, and other Web sites attached to them. That’s a lot of competition for 
customer eyeballs.
In the sections that follow, we take a look at how to attract potential custom­
ers to your Web site or blog and how to get them to buy once they find their 
way there.

278
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
Knowing what it takes to get traffic
Traffic — that is, visitors to your Web site — is perhaps the key element 
that can make or break your online business. Generally, the more traffic, the 
better, assuming that the traffic consists of people who may be interested in 
buying what you have for sale.
	
Just because you have a Web site or blog doesn’t mean anyone is going to 
show up for your party. You may think if I build it, they will come, but although 
that mantra may work in a Hollywood baseball fantasy, it probably won’t work 
for your new Web site or blog. If you hope to be successful, you need to get 
more — and the right kind of — traffic to your site. Here are a few of the most 
effective ideas for doing so:
	
✓	Register with the most-visited search engines. There are hundreds of 
search engines available, but, in our humble opinion, you shouldn’t waste 
your time with 99.9 percent of them. Our advice is to stick with the follow­
ing top five search engines (based on the number of visits they get):
 
• Google (www.google.com)
 
• Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com)
 
• Bing (www.bing.com)
 
• Ask.com (www.ask.com)
 
• America Online (www.aolsearch.com)
	
✓	Register with pay-per-click search engines. The Google and Yahoo! 
search engines offer an additional service, where you can pay to have 
your company’s site show up in a prominent location when someone 
searches a specific keyword or phrase (Google’s service is called Google 
AdWords: www.adwords.google.com; Yahoo!’s is called Yahoo! 
Sponsored Search: sem.smallbusiness.yahoo.com/searchengine
marketing). Imagine that your home-based business is wedding con­
sulting. Using Google AdWords for a price, you can have a small ad with 
a link show up any time someone searches the keywords wedding con­
sultant. You pay only when someone does a search using your keywords, 
and the amount you pay depends on how popular the keywords are — 
more keyword competition means higher prices.
	
✓	Create unique content. Don’t make your Web site just a place to buy 
things; make it a place people want to visit to find out something new or 
participate in a unique experience. Take time to create unique content 
for your site that will attract busy Web surfers and then make them want 
to stick around awhile. For example, if you’re a dog breeder specializing 
in French bulldogs, why not create a Web site that is the best source of 
information on that breed? By doing so, you’re sure to drive all kinds of 
traffic to your site.

279
 Chapter 13: Making the Web Work for You
	
✓	Start an affiliate program. Offer other Web site owners a commission 
on sales they send your way. The big sites, like Amazon, make affiliate 
programs a central part of their selling model — driving more traffic to 
their sites and increasing their sales. You can, too. Check out a variety of 
affiliate programs using an affiliate directory, such as www.affiliate
scout.com or www.affiliateseeking.com, to see how commissions 
are structured and to get ideas for how to set up your own program.
	
✓	Exchange links. Have you found some sites out there that are somehow 
related to what you do but aren’t in direct competition? If so, ask the 
site’s Webmaster to place a link to your site on that site in exchange for 
putting a link to that site on yours. For example, if you provide fishing-
guide services in the Yellowstone area, why not exchange links with fish­
ing Web sites or Web sites devoted to Yellowstone National Park?
Making it easy for visitors 
to become customers
The two main reasons for having a Web site or blog for your home-based 
business are to (1) attract potential customers to your offer and then (2) 
to make it easy for them to buy. Although many Web sites do a fine job get­
ting people to visit, they drop the ball when it comes to converting visits to 
sales, often simply because they’re too confusing, too slow, or just too much 
trouble to use.
	
So your job is to make it easy for customers to buy what they want directly 
through your Web site, assuming you’ve got a product or service that lends 
itself to buying online. Here are some tips for doing just that:
	
✓	Have a well-organized, professional-looking site. Nothing’s worse than 
trying to buy something from an amateurish, disorganized site.
	
✓	If you’re selling products, put up lots of high-quality photos and 
detailed descriptions. Many people want to see what they’re getting 
before they order it.
	
✓	Make sure your hosting service has ample bandwidth to load your 
pages quickly. Slow servers mean your visitors will quickly get bored 
and leave.
	
✓	Give your customers plenty of payment options. Use a prepackaged 
e-commerce site, such as Yahoo! Small Business Merchant Solutions, 
that allows customers to use charge cards. Or consider signing up for a 
payment service, such as PayPal, that also allows customers to use their 
charge cards to pay.

280
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
	
✓	Provide ample contact information for customers who have questions. 
If you can quickly address questions — via phone, Internet audio or 
video links (for example, Skype at www.skype.com), or e-mail — you 
greatly increase your chances of converting the contact into a sale.
Not sure whether your site is welcoming or not? Give it a try yourself. Is it 
easy to get around? Does it load quickly? Is it easy to place an order? Have 
friends and family try it out, too. Use their feedback to fine-tune your site and 
make it as user-friendly as possible.
The ten best ways to promote your Web site or blog
A Web site or blog won’t do you or your busi­
ness much good if no one knows about it 
or visits it. So what can you do to make sure 
people find your site and visit it? Here are just a 
few ideas to get you started:
	✓	Send announcements for your Web site 
or blog (including a picture of your home 
page) to all your customers and clients, as 
well as to the media and targeted mailing 
lists of potential clients.
	✓	Include your Web site or blog address on 
all external materials, including letterheads, 
business cards, catalogs, invoices, news­
letters, packaging, and so on.
	✓	Incorporate your Web site or blog address 
into your standard fax cover sheet.
	✓	Include your Web site or blog address in 
your voice-mail system and in your on-hold 
message.
	✓	Include your Web site or blog address in all 
advertising.
	✓	Visit Internet newsgroups and message 
boards, leave messages, and participate in 
relevant discussions.
	✓	Seek out busy Web sites where you can 
volunteer to host online chats and confer­
ences. Large sites, such as America Online 
and iVillage, are always looking for knowl­
edgeable hosts who are willing to share 
their expertise with others.
	✓	Register your site with the five most popular 
Internet search engines (Google, Yahoo!, 
Bing, Ask, and America Online), and be sure 
you optimize your site to rank high in the 
search results (by incorporating metatags 
and other tricks of the trade). Check out 
Search Engine Optimization For Dummies, 3rd 
Edition, by Peter Kent (Wiley), for a lot more 
information about these tags and tricks.
	✓	Trade links with your customers and clients 
and with other relevant Web sites or blogs.
	✓	Create an e-mail signature for yourself and 
your employees that includes your Web site 
or blog address. A signature is a short para­
graph that’s automatically included at the 
bottom of every e-mail message you send. 
It usually contains a plug for your business, 
along with your address, phone or fax 
number, and a Web site or blog address.

▶	Keeping your work life and personal life separate
▶	Dodging interruptions and distractions at home
▶	Managing your time
▶	Teaming up with a friend or family member
M
any people dream about starting and running their own businesses, 
but relatively few actually do it — and even fewer start businesses 
that turn out to be successful for the long haul. What makes the difference 
between those who succeed and those who don’t? In many cases, it’s all 
about attitude — and not just any attitude, a serious business attitude.
In this chapter, we examine exactly what having a serious business attitude 
is all about — and why it’s so important. We also discuss how to keep your 
work life and personal life separate, at least enough to get some work done! 
We assess two of the most common problems facing home-based business­
people — interruptions and distractions — and provide you with a variety of 
tips to help you beat them. Finally, we consider the importance of developing 
regular work routines, as well as the whys and hows of getting organized.
Starting with a Serious Business Attitude
Most successful businesses are successful in part because the people who 
own and run them are serious about doing business. But why is being serious 
about your business so incredibly important? Well, we offer you two main 

282
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
reasons, both of which involve perception and both of which have a way of 
becoming self-fulfilling prophecies:
	
✓	If you’re not serious about your business, you probably won’t put 
your all into making it a success. You won’t be able to imagine that 
your modest little enterprise will ever have the potential to provide you 
and your family with a livable wage or that it will ever provide you with 
an alternative to a regular 9-to-5 job.
	
✓	If you’re not serious about your business, no one else will be either. 
Why should your potential clients and customers take your busi­
ness seriously if you don’t? The answer to that question is easy: They 
shouldn’t. And if your potential clients and customers don’t take your 
business seriously, you have no business at all.
The first step to developing your serious business attitude is realizing that 
your home-based business is no different from any other business. You may 
have decided to start your home-based business because doing so gives you 
something that working for someone else simply can’t provide. Maybe it’s free­
dom, autonomy, control, flexibility, money, or any number of other reasons.
	
Regardless of why you started your own business, realize that your home-
based business is a business first and foremost. If you hope to be successful 
(and we’re sure you do), you have to treat it like a serious business, which 
means recognizing that your business is not any of the following:
	
✓	A hobby
	
✓	Something you do every once in a while
	
✓	Merely a tax shelter
	
✓	A get-rich-quick scheme
	
✓	A lark
Having fun in your business is fine — in fact, you should — but don’t forget 
that your home-based business can be your ticket for leaving the rat race 
behind once and for all. Many successful home-based business owners have 
done just that, and you can, too.
Building success from the inside
Starting your own business can cause nervousness and trepidation. If you’ve 
always worked for someone else, the thought of working for yourself can 
truly feel like a step into the great unknown. And in many ways, it is an 

283
 Chapter 14: Balancing Your Business and Your Life
unknown world for you: Will customers buy your products? Will you be able 
to make enough money to support your family? Will you be able to get health 
insurance? What will you do if a much larger competitor tries to steal all your 
ideas?
	
Having a serious business attitude starts on the inside. It starts with being 
knowledgeable about your services and products and having the confidence 
that comes with that knowledge. Above all, it starts with a conscious decision 
to make the dream of starting your own home-based business a reality. Here 
are some of the ways you can start to build a successful home-based business 
from the inside out:
	
✓	Have confidence. Confidence — or the lack thereof — can make all the 
difference in the world when you’re starting and growing your own busi­
ness. When you’re confident, you feel like you can overcome any hurdle 
you come up against. And you know what? You probably can!
	
✓	Keep a positive attitude. Most successful entrepreneurs tend to be opti­
mistic about themselves, their businesses, and the future. They see the 
glass as half full rather than half empty. A positive attitude can take you 
far in this world, both in business and in your personal life.
	
✓	Expect the best from yourself and others. Set your standards high, 
and refuse to settle for less. The quality of your products and services 
begins — and ends — with you.
	
✓	Care about your customers. Would you rather do business with some­
one who really cares about you and who takes the time to show it or 
someone who doesn’t? If you take care of your customers and clients, 
they’ll take care of you.
	
✓	Make the decision. Plant your foot firmly on the other side of the fence, 
and make the decision once and for all to turn your home-based busi­
ness dream into a reality. Quit talking about it; just do it!
Take the time to build your serious business attitude from the inside out. If 
you already have all the self-confidence and positive attitude in the world, 
that’s great — you have a big head start toward business success!
	
If you still have some way to go to build the serious business attitude you 
need, don’t be afraid to work into your business slowly, one step at a time. 
Instead of leaving your regular job to start your own business, consider start­
ing your home-based business while still working your regular job. Not only 
will this approach take much of the pressure off you to create an immediately 
successful enterprise — boosting your self-confidence in the process — but it 
will also give you the time you need to really get to know your products and 
services and to network with potential customers and clients.

Counting on the outside for help, too
Although everyone knows you can’t tell a book by its cover, people still make 
judgments about you and your business based on what they see on the out­
side. Whether their ultimate judgments are right or wrong, these judgments 
can mean the difference between getting new customers or clients and losing 
them.
Creating an identity
One of the first things most home-based busi­
nesspeople do is order business cards and sta­
tionery for their new home-based businesses, 
which raises a question: Should you develop a 
logo design to represent your business while 
you’re at it?
If you’re serious about building your business 
and committing to it for the long haul, you need 
to create an identity that will help your busi­
ness stand out in the crowded marketplace. 
Although you may be able to create a logo 
yourself, hiring a professional graphic artist to 
develop a logo for your business is probably a 
better idea. You’ll use your logo for a variety of 
purposes, including business cards, stationery, 
your Web site, advertising and promotional 
materials, brochures, reports, and more.
Although your graphic artist may present you 
with a wide variety of options and alternatives, 
remember that the logo design you select for 
your home-based business should be:
	✓	Simple: A logo design should never be so 
complex that it becomes confusing. In the 
case of logos, simpler usually means better. 
Think McDonald’s golden arches, AT&T’s 
globe, or Nike’s swoosh.
	✓	Unique and recognizable: Take a look at 
the cover of this book. What do you see? 
The Dummies Man — the mascot of the For 
Dummies brand — is at once unique and 
recognizable. After you see him on one For 
Dummies book, you associate his face with 
this brand, no matter which book it is.
	✓	Compatible with your business’s image: 
Is your business conservative, such as 
a management consulting or investment 
firm? Then you want to have a conservative 
logo that reflects the rock-solid image you 
want your firm to project. But if your firm is 
dynamic, exciting, and takes chances, your 
logo should, too!
Keep in mind that other elements of your busi­
ness besides your logo help create an iden­
tity for your business. For instance, the way 
you answer your phone, the color and type of 
paper you use in customer correspondence, 
the design of your Web site, the friendliness 
with which you handle customer problems, and 
even the message you leave on your answering 
machine or voice mail all build the image that 
people have of your business and, therefore, its 
identity in the marketplace.
Take the time to step outside your business 
from time to time to experience what your cus­
tomers and clients experience. Are you happy 
with what you see? If not, what can you do to 
improve your business’s identity and image?

 Chapter 14: Balancing Your Business and Your Life
	
Here are some ways to make sure what’s outside (and easily seen) reflects 
what’s inside (and not so easily seen):
	
✓	Create a top-notch Web presence. The days of being able to get away 
with an amateurish-looking, clunky Web site are gone. Invest some 
money in building a top-notch Web site that absolutely exudes quality 
and experience. The good news is that many Web-hosting services offer 
inexpensive and easy-to-use templates that instantly give your business 
a professional look. And don’t forget to leverage social media to your 
advantage. Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, and, of course, your own blog 
can be very powerful promotional tools for your home-based business 
(check out Chapter 13 for more on using social media to help promote 
your business).
	
✓	Create a custom logo and design for your stationery, business cards, 
and promotional materials. If your logo’s good enough for a multibillion-
dollar corporation, it’s good enough for you. The money you invest in 
making your business look more professional will pay off many times 
over in the number and quality of clients that you attract. (Check out the 
“Creating an identity” sidebar for more info.)
	
	The quality of the paper and other materials you deliver to your client 
says a lot about the quality of your work and the importance you place 
on delivering a quality product. What does the paper you use say about 
you and your business?
	
✓	Incorporate. Those three little letters — Inc. — say something about 
your business. They say that you’re established, that you’re serious, 
and that you’re in it for the long haul. Not a bad impression to leave 
with your potential customers. (See Chapter 10 for more information on 
incorporating your business.)
	
✓	Dress for success. As a general rule, always dress one level higher than 
the client you’re meeting with. If your client is dressed casually, you 
should have a jacket and tie (for men) or a dress, skirt and blouse, or 
pants suit (for women). If your client goes for jacket and tie, wear a suit. 
Of course, if you’re at home — and there’s no chance a client will be pop­
ping by unannounced — you can wear whatever makes you comfortable.
	
✓	Get a dedicated phone line. Nothing screams “unprofessional!” more 
loudly than a 5-year-old answering a client’s call. You’ll make a much 
better impression by having a dedicated phone line for your business, 
hooked up to a dedicated answering machine or voice mail system.
	
	You can dedicate either a land line or a cellphone for your business. 
Although either option is fine, you may find it more convenient (as Peter 
does) to assign your business phone number to a cellphone. That way, 
when you’re out of town on business — or on vacation far away from 
your office — your customers and clients can still directly contact you. If 
you want to take calls on your land line when you’re back in your home 
office, simply forward your cellphone to your home phone line.

Separating Your Work from 
Your Personal Life
Although being closer to your loved ones (even if it’s just your goldfish) is 
one of the big attractions to working at home, you’ll definitely have times 
when you have to draw a line between your home life and your work life. By 
taking the time to anticipate this requirement upfront, you can make the tran­
sition to your home-based business smoother — not just for you, but for your 
clients, customers, family, and friends, as well.
	
You can use a number of barriers to separate the business and personal sides 
of your life. Here are some of the most important ones to consider:
	
✓	Use a separate room. Having a room apart from the hustle and bustle of 
your regular home life — one that is dedicated exclusively to your busi­
ness — is the first step in making your home office a real office.
	
✓	Set a work schedule. When you own your own business, you can work 
whenever you like. You may find it easier (and more productive), how­
ever, to establish a regular work schedule. That way, your housemates 
know when it’s okay to interrupt you and when it’s clearly not okay.
	
	Just be sure to avoid answering business calls when you’re in a decid­
edly nonbusiness environment, such as in your car driving your child’s 
victorious soccer team to the ice cream shop. Make sure the message 
you project on the outside reflects the high level of quality and commit­
ment to your customers that you hold so dear inside.
Serious doesn’t mean you can’t do it your way
One of the most liberating things about having 
your own business is that you get to decide 
when and where you’re going to work, what 
work you’re going to do, and for whom you’re 
going to do it. According to surveys by Home 
Office Computing magazine, home-based 
businesspeople have different approaches for 
doing things their own way. For example:
	✓	Fewer than 10 percent work a traditional, 
9-to-5 schedule.
	✓	Eighty-one percent dress casually (6.5 per­
cent don’t wear anything at all!).
	✓	Fifty percent don’t wear shoes while they 
work.
	✓	Eleven percent wear formal business attire.
	✓	Sixty percent listen to music while working.

287
 Chapter 14: Balancing Your Business and Your Life
	
✓	Have a separate entrance. A separate entrance (or at least an entrance 
to your office close to the front door) helps keep your work life separate 
from your home life. After all, you don’t want your clients to have to 
pass through a gauntlet of toys, cereal bowls, and cranky children (or 
spouses!) to get to your office. Many home-based businesspeople may 
not currently have the luxury of a separate entrance, but it’s something 
to think about if you have the opportunity to build, buy, or rent a new 
house in the future. If not, you always have the option of meeting your 
clients at a convenient off-site location, such as your local coffee shop or 
favorite lunch spot.
	
✓	Get help. Instead of trying to juggle your obligations at home while 
trying to keep up with your work obligations, consider getting the help 
you need to allow you to focus exclusively on your work when you need 
to do so. For example, you can hire a housekeeper to clean your home 
and relieve you of that burden. Or you can hire a babysitter to watch 
your young children while you work. Or you may be able to get your 
spouse or a relative or friend to help cover for you. The main thing to 
remember is that you do have alternatives available to you if you feel 
overwhelmed.
	
Keep in mind that the degree to which you separate your work and personal 
lives is totally up to you. The good news is that you can be far more flexible 
than you ever could be working for someone else. You can strengthen the 
separation when you’re under the gun at work and loosen up when things are 
a bit more relaxed. In this way, you really can enjoy the best of both worlds, 
where you’re able to do the work you love in the place you most want to be — 
your own home.
Getting off the preschool bus route
Q: Once when my neighbor was in a jam, I 
offered to pick up her son from preschool. She 
has since asked me to repeat this favor several 
times. How can I explain to her, without damag­
ing our friendly relationship, that just because 
I’m working at home doesn’t mean I’m not work­
ing as hard as her corporate acquaintances?
A: You don’t need to explain. The way to let 
her know that you’re working as hard as her 
corporate acquaintances is to tell her that 
even though you’d like to help, you can’t pick 
up her son because you’re working. Be warm. 
Be sincere. But be clear and definite that your 
business is such now that you can no longer 
take time off during working hours. She will 
probably be disappointed, as she has come to 
rely on you. But if you want her to take you off 
her emergency help list, you may need to rein­
force your message several times, repeating 
that you’re sorry and wish you could help, but 
because of your work, you simply can’t. She 
may call you several more times, just to be sure. 
But if you continue to be clear that you’d like to 
help but can’t, she’ll eventually get the idea and 
find new resources.

Avoiding Interruptions and Distractions
Every job has its interruptions and distractions. When you’re in a regular 
office, you may have a co-worker who drops in on you regularly to unload his 
or her latest thoughts about your company’s management team. Or you may 
have a boss who is so busy assigning you new tasks that you never seem to 
be able to get around to the old ones.
Without a doubt, however, working at home offers its own unique set of inter­
ruptions and distractions. From television soap operas to your neighbor’s 
ear-splitting leaf blower to that refrigerator calling your name, almost an 
unlimited number of interruptions and distractions are waiting to take you 
away from your work. Your job is to find ways to ignore them or to avoid 
them altogether, which is where the following sections come in.
Dealing with interruptions
You can’t always prevent interruptions, but you can take some steps to 
remove them after they occur and then get back on track and back to work. 
Here are some ways to deal with interruptions:
	
✓	Focus on your goals and priorities. Although you may not be able to 
keep from being thrown off track when an interruption occurs, you 
should be able to quickly return your focus to the goals and priorities 
at hand. How? By resolving the interruption as quickly as possible and 
then refocusing your full attention on your work.
	
✓	Be kind but firm. The wrong way to deal with interruptions is to get 
mad at the person who’s interrupting you. The right way is to firmly 
explain, in a loving and supportive way, that the interruptions will have 
to stop while you’re working. Kids especially need this kind of caring 
treatment. They probably aren’t aware that they’re interrupting your 
work; they simply want a chance to spend some time with you.
	
✓	Take action. Don’t try to ignore interruptions — chances are they won’t 
go away, no matter how little attention you pay them. In fact, by not 
taking action, you send the person doing the interrupting the message 
that it’s okay to interrupt you — or even that you welcome it — all the 
while building resentment within yourself.
	
✓	Stay loose. No matter what you do, someone somewhere will interrupt 
you. The key is to stay loose and not let the interruption totally destroy 
your ability to jump right back on task. Figure out how to be flexible, and 
find ways to get back on task quickly.
With a bit of practice, you’ll soon be able to deal with your interruptions like 
a pro, and you’ll find that you can take charge of them instead of letting them 
take charge of you.

289
 Chapter 14: Balancing Your Business and Your Life
Dealing with distractions
Interruptions generally occur when people take you away from your work — by 
walking into your office and demanding your immediate attention or by calling 
you on the phone and talking your ear off for half an hour. Distractions are often 
more subtle. For home-based businesspeople, common distractions include the 
Internet, a favorite daily soap opera, or a refrigerator full of goodies.
Is TV the problem or the symptom?
Q: I’m often tempted to watch TV during work 
hours. At first, I set a rule that I would watch 
TV for only one hour during my lunch break; 
however, I sometimes get sucked into a show 
and watch longer than I should. Then I rational­
ize by saying I’ll work longer hours. Sometimes 
I even have the TV on in the background and 
then press the mute button when I get an out­
side call. Do you have any suggestions on how 
I can break this bad habit?
A: Take the TV out of your office. Watching TV is 
one of the top five home-office bad habits. Get 
a VCR (or, even better, a digital video recorder, 
such as TiVo) if you don’t have one, and tape 
your favorite daytime shows. If you don’t like a 
show well enough to watch it after work hours, 
something must be missing from your workday. 
Find out what that something is, and replace 
your bad habit with new, more appealing habits 
that serve you better. For example:
	✓	Are you bored with your work? What has 
made watching daytime TV more interest­
ing to you than the work you do? There will 
always be a few tasks in any business that 
are so mindless, you may as well be watch­
ing TV while you do them, but you’re in the 
wrong business if that’s how you feel about 
most of your workday. Has your business 
lost its magic — or never had it? How can 
you make what you do more exciting and 
challenging? What attracted you to go out 
on your own in the first place? What do you 
like best about your work? What can you 
do more of in your work that will make you 
forget all about watching TV? Find answers 
to these questions and put them to action.
	✓	Do you miss the social interaction of an 
office setting? Arrange to have more con­
tact with people you enjoy. Call up a col­
league. Get active in a local business or 
professional organization. Join an Internet 
newsgroup. Sign up for a class or ongoing 
social activity you enjoy.
	✓	Are you stressed out and working too 
hard? Give yourself something else to look 
forward to, such as planning an exciting 
evening for when you’ve finished working. 
Or replace your bad habit with a better one. 
Many home-business owners, for example, 
enjoy listening to talk radio or music while 
they work. Others walk outside over the 
lunch hour or take an exercise break like 
running, biking, or participating in an aero­
bics class. What do you enjoy doing most?

290
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
	
Here are some ways to deal with distractions:
	
✓	Remove the sources of distraction. Is that television on your file cabinet 
begging you to turn it on? Is there a long list of blogs you have to read 
each morning before you can start to work? Are you spending more time 
looking through your magazines than producing billable work? One of 
the best ways to avoid distractions is to remove their sources. Turn 
them off, throw them out, or move them to another room. If the Internet 
or e-mail is the problem, set definite times — perhaps during lunch or 
maybe no more than five minutes every hour — during which you allow 
yourself to spend time on those activities.
	
✓	Avoid procrastination. Putting work off until later, sometimes much 
later, is a powerful enemy of the home-based businessperson. And it’s 
an enemy that you must defeat in the short run if you hope to be suc­
cessful in the long run.
	
✓	Reward yourself for achieving your goals. Don’t forget to give yourself 
some sort of reward for accomplishing a significant task or achieving 
an important milestone. Take a day off. Meet your significant other for 
a long lunch. Go shopping. Go for a bike ride with your kids. Whatever 
makes you feel good. Not only will these rewards make you feel better, 
but they’ll also motivate you to stay focused on your work and tune out 
distractions.
	
✓	Schedule (and take!) regular breaks. Do you find yourself fidgeting 
or unable to stay focused on your work? Take a short break from your 
work. Forward your calls to voice mail, and get out of your office. You 
can relax and take your mind on a brief vacation by going for a brisk 
walk outside or enjoying a cup of coffee or tea on your back porch. Don’t 
leave taking breaks to chance; schedule regular breaks into your daily 
work plan.
You can control the effect of distractions on you and your business by taking 
action to remove their sources and by providing sufficient structure and 
motivation in your work. Don’t let distractions get in the way of your doing 
the best job you can do — and building the best business you can build.
	
Sometimes, despite all your efforts to deal with interruptions and distrac­
tions, they may get the best of you. Peter, for example, is usually able to keep 
his work separate from his very active kids, but, occasionally, the thin line 
that divides them breaks. More than once, Peter has thought about how nice 
it would be to rent an office in a small building in the village — a guaranteed 
refuge from the demands of three busy kids. But that thought passes quickly 
(when he remembers just how much he’d have to pay each month in rent), 
and Peter again remembers all the advantages of having an office in his home. 
What Peter does when he absolutely needs to focus on his work without 
any distractions is send his family on vacation for a few days. Past vacations 
include Disneyland, Palm Springs, and Pismo Beach, California. Peter gets his 
work done while his family has a good time — it’s a win-win for everyone.

291
 Chapter 14: Balancing Your Business and Your Life
When interruptions and distractions get the best of you, you certainly do 
whatever you can to resolve them. But what happens when you can’t resolve 
your interruptions and distractions and they actually begin to threaten your 
ability to get your work done?
	
It may be time to take drastic action. Here are just a few ways you can really 
shake things up and get back on track:
	
✓	Change your schedule. Work when your chances of being interrupted 
or distracted are minimized. If you can’t seem to avoid being distracted 
by your noisy roommates who party late into the night, do your work in 
the morning and afternoon — well before the partying begins.
	
✓	Learn to live with the distractions. Of course, doing so is easier said 
than done, but perhaps you can learn to live with the distractions — 
accepting them but tuning them out and ultimately ignoring them.
Resisting the call of the fridge
Q: I’m embarrassed to say that I’ve gained some 
weight since I began working at home. I think 
part of the problem is that I eat out of stress, 
and, of course, the refrigerator is now just a 
few steps away from my desk. Do you have any 
suggestions for how I can moderate my eating 
habits?
A: You’re not the only one to gain weight in the 
comforts of working from home. But although 
you have more access to excess at home, you 
also have more control over what you do and 
how you do it.
The best way to beat this problem is to find new 
ways to de-stress: Take a walk, call a friend, 
or lean back and listen quietly to some of your 
favorite music. Thinking of something — any­
thing but food — will help you relax. It may take 
a while to find what satisfies you more than 
food, but, on the way to the kitchen, take a deep 
breath and think of what else you may enjoy at 
that particular moment.
Also, stock your refrigerator and kitchen cabi­
nets with lots of low-calorie, low-fat, healthy-
but-filling foods that don’t make you want to 
eat until the bag is empty, the way that chips 
and cookies do. Apples or rice cakes are good 
examples. We find that eating small, balanced 
snacks can help keep snacking within bounds. 
For example, you may have half an apple with 
an ounce of cheese and a couple of almonds or 
a teaspoon of almond butter. Alternatively, you 
can remove the incentive to visit the kitchen 
between meals by keeping the beverages of 
your choice in your office. Consider picking up 
one of those mini shelf-top refrigerators if you 
like cold drinks.
Be aware, too, that evidence is beginning to 
show that one’s body type makes some foods 
fattening for one person that are not fattening 
for someone else. If you’d like to check this out, 
see the book The GenoType Diet, by Dr. Peter 
J. D’Adamo (Random House), or check out 
D’Adamo’s Web site at www.dadamo.com. 
Following his guidelines, if you do snack, you 
shouldn’t put on pounds.

292
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
	
✓	Move your work. Sometimes a temporary change of scenery can do 
wonders for your concentration, especially when the source of distrac­
tion or interruption is a short-term one. Try out an outside deck or even 
a local café, library, or park. With a cellphone and a laptop computer, 
you can take your work wherever you want whenever you want.
	
✓	Move your office. If you have a long-term, ongoing problem with distrac­
tions and interruptions, and it doesn’t appear that you can solve the 
problem with a temporary change of scenery, consider moving your 
office altogether. At a minimum, choose a different room or other loca­
tion within your home. In a worst-case scenario, you may need to move 
your office out of your home and into a regular, leased office space.
	
Don’t let interruptions and distractions get in the way of your success. If 
you’re serious about your home-based business and about the potential for 
succeeding at it (and we’re sure you are!), take action before things get so bad 
that your business suffers irreparable harm.
Managing Your Time
When you work at home, getting off track is easy to do. What starts out as a 
day full of promise for getting things done can easily turn into a day full of 
wasted time, personal detours, and lost opportunities. Good time manage­
ment doesn’t happen by accident. You have to work on managing your time 
each and every day. In this section, we consider some of the best ways to 
manage your time.
Letting routines rule
Routines are a part of life. They help you stay focused on the things that are 
most important. They provide the structure and continuity that you — and 
your clients and customers — rely on to do business efficiently and effec­
tively. Routines are a good thing.
	
When it comes to running your home-based business, some routines are 
better than others. Here are some tips for establishing the right kinds of 
routines — the kinds that can bring you success rather than failure:
	
✓	Establish a regular work schedule. Maintain regular business hours just 
as you would if you worked for a regular business. It doesn’t matter if 
you decide to work from 9:00 to 5:00 or from 5:00 to 9:00, so long as your 
schedule meets your needs and the needs of your clients and custom­
ers. As the owner of your own business, you get to decide!

293
 Chapter 14: Balancing Your Business and Your Life
	
✓	Take plenty of short breaks. When you work in a regular business, you 
have lots of opportunities to take breaks from your routine. A phone call 
from a friend, a visit from a vendor, a lunch break with your associates, 
or a quick walk to a nearby deli all offer a break from the routine. When 
you work at home, such breaks are much fewer and farther between, but 
you have to make a point of taking them.
	
✓	Schedule appointments for you, your friends, and your family. The 
everyday events that take place in a typical business — home-based or 
not — can quickly fill up your schedule. While you may have planned to 
get out for a relaxing lunch with friends, go to the gym to work out, or 
attend your daughter’s awards ceremony, you may find yourself glued 
to the phone or computer instead. Instead of “trying” to do the things 
you want to do, schedule firm appointments to do these things. Just as 
you would schedule an appointment to meet with a client, schedule an 
appointment to meet with your spouse over lunch or to go for a walk.
	
✓	Start your workday the same way every day. Create a routine around 
starting your workday. For example, you may make a pot of coffee, 
check your e-mail and voice mail, read The Wall Street Journal, and then 
begin making sales calls. You decide what to do in your routine; the 
point is to have a routine and to follow it.
	
✓	End your workday the same way every day. So many businesspeople 
complain about not having enough time to sit down and really think 
ahead and plan, but few do anything about it. Here’s your chance to do 
just that. At the end of your workday, take 15 minutes to go over what 
happened that day and then review your priorities and schedules for the 
next day. File away any papers that need filing, and straighten up your 
desk so that you come back to an organized workspace on your next day 
of work.
If you feel that your work life — and maybe even your personal life — is cha­
otic and out of control, perhaps you should step back for a moment and take 
a close look at how you run your life. Using the preceding list, create routines 
in your life that you can rely on day after day, week after week.
What’s a priority, and what isn’t?
Priorities can — and should — have a significant impact on what work you 
decide to do and when you decide to do it. Most people think they know 
what’s most important in their businesses, but many don’t follow through 
on this knowledge and, instead, let trivial events and distractions rule their 
schedules.

294
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
	
To separate your real priorities from the wannabes, start by asking yourself 
these questions when you’re trying to decide whether a particular action is a 
real priority:
	
✓	What’s the action’s impact on your firm’s bottom line? Everyone has 
reasons for being in a particular business, but one of the main reasons 
for creating a business is to make money, pure and simple. Sure, you 
want to do fulfilling work that taps your creativity, but if it doesn’t 
pay the bills, you won’t be doing it for long. What kind of impact will 
the action have on your bottom line — will it reduce your expenses 
or increase your revenues? The greater the impact an action has on 
improving your bottom line — your profitability — the higher it rates on 
your list of priorities. If an action has little or no impact on your bottom 
line, give higher priority to other actions that do have such an impact.
Missing the hustle and bustle
Q: I know home-based business owners often 
complain about noise distracting them, but my 
problem is the opposite: Sometimes it gets so 
quiet in my home office that it unsettles me. Do 
you have any suggestions for creating a little bit 
of good old-fashioned office noise?
A: You’re not the only one who doesn’t work 
well in silence, which is undoubtedly why 
home-based business owners avidly listen to 
talk radio. Of course, background music helps 
many people stay productive, and, rather than 
being a distraction, it can energize your brain 
and your work. We sometimes like to have 
Steven Halpern’s album Enhancing Creativity 
playing in the background while we work. (Visit 
his Web site at www.innerpeacemusic.
com to order this album or choose from many 
others.) Alternatively, you can listen to radio sta­
tions, music or talk, over the Internet. Pandora 
Internet Radio (www.pandora.com) lets you 
customize your own music program choosing 
only the music you like.
We’ve also met people who spend part of their 
day working over lunch at a restaurant or cof­
feehouse. Others prefer to work on their cor­
porate client’s premises several days a week. 
When graphic designer Nancy Rabbit couldn’t 
stand the sound of silence, she decided to 
expand her business by bringing several co-
workers into her home.
We also like the sound of water, so we keep a 
small fountain gurgling throughout the workday. 
You can find a reasonably priced tabletop foun­
tain in many retail stores.
As for office noise, if that’s what you miss, you 
can ask a client or colleague to let you tape 10 
or 15 minutes of office sounds on an endless-
loop tape that you can then play in the back­
ground while you work.

✓	Is the action in response to a client emergency? Another reason why 
many people start their own businesses is to solve their client’s prob­
lems and to provide them with solutions. Because clients in many ways 
are the heart and soul of any business, solving their problems is clearly 
a priority. So when your clients have emergencies, the actions you need 
to take to solve them should be top priorities for you.
It all comes down to consciously identifying a business’s highest-priority 
actions and then taking a single-minded approach to tackling them. This single-
minded approach may mean ignoring the calls of a salesperson, forwarding 
your phone to voice mail for a day, or even throwing your priority list into a 
drawer and working only on your number-one priority until it’s done. The good 
news is that prioritizing gets easier with experience.
	
Don’t forget, you hold the key. It’s up to you to decide what’s most important 
to your business and then to act on it. You’re the boss now; no one else is 
going to decide for you.
Teaming Up with a Spouse 
or Other Loved One
You can find countless examples of husbands, wives, siblings, parents, and 
kids who have pulled together to build successful enterprises: the Wright 
Brothers of Dayton, Ohio, who owned and operated their own bicycle shop 
(and later became famed pilots); brothers Walt and Roy Disney, who founded 
the Walt Disney Company and built it into a global entertainment powerhouse; 
and Barry Allen and Pauline Field, who created International Fieldworks, Inc., 
a multimillion-dollar company that provides work for hundreds of others 
through project-management contracts. The list goes on and on.
For many people, teaming up with a spouse, boyfriend, girlfriend, sibling, 
parent, son, or daughter may seem like the ultimate dream. And for many 
home-based business owners, this dream is a reality. After all, if working at 
home is right for you, why not see whether it’s right for the people you really 
care about, too? Unfortunately, though, for others, teaming up can turn into 
the very worst kind of nightmare — scary beyond all belief. The secret is 
knowing when to team up and when not to — and what to do when a good 
team goes bad.
In the sections that follow, we take a look at when to team up with people you 
care about, how to team up with them, and how to build a successful, long-
term relationship — both at work and away from the job.

Knowing when to team up
As in the rest of life, some times are better than others to team up with a 
friend or family member. For instance, you definitely want to team up when 
doing so will create a positive experience for you, your partner, and your cus­
tomers. In contrast, you definitely don’t want to team up when doing so will 
create a negative experience for any of you.
Here are some times when teaming up with a friend or family member is a 
good idea:
	
✓	When a friend or family member has relevant skills and interests: If 
you decide to start a plumbing business in your home and your close 
friend or relative has solid bookkeeping skills that will help you better 
keep track of the financial end of your business, teaming up makes per­
fect sense.
	
✓	When a friend or family member purchases a business opportunity 
or franchise: You won’t find a better time to team up than when a close 
friend or relative buys into a business opportunity or franchise — 
assuming, of course, that the business opportunity or franchise is some­
thing you want to do, too.
	
✓	When a friend or family member can make a positive contribution 
to your business: It’s definitely time to team up when a friend or family 
member is at the exact right place in his or her life to make a positive 
and substantial contribution to your business and to your customers 
and clients.
	
✓	When a friend or family member has a resource you need: What if you 
need a large amount of cash to get your business off the ground and 
your close friend or relative wants to help by providing you with a loan? 
Or what if he or she has a network of contacts that would be very benefi­
cial for you to approach? Such resource synergies can make teaming up 
a very smart move.
	
✓	When a friend or family member has more work than he or she can 
handle: Teaming up can be a win-win situation when a friend or family 
member is so successful in his or her business that he or she needs help 
and needs it fast.
	
Not every business team or partnership is going to work. Working closely 
together — day after day — may bring out the worst in your partner (or 
you), and you should always be ready to break up your team if necessary. Do 
not — we repeat, do not — allow a bad situation to become worse because 
you’re afraid to tell a friend or relative that your partnership isn’t working out. 
Always be honest — with yourself and with your partner. And never team up 
out of weakness or pity for a friend or family member who just can’t seem to 
get his or her act together. Finding the right time to team up is a must if you 
want your business relationship to be successful over the long run.

297
 Chapter 14: Balancing Your Business and Your Life
Figuring out how to team up
How you team up with a friend or family member is just as important as — if 
not more important than — when you team up. Doing it the right way can 
help reinforce your relationship and increase the likelihood of your success. 
Doing it the wrong way, on the other hand, can be a recipe for disaster — not 
only for your business, but also for your relationship.
	
As you begin to team up with your friend or family member, consider taking 
the following actions:
	
✓	Define clear goals and assign clear responsibilities. Although you may 
have different approaches to achieving your goals, you and your partner 
should agree on definite and clear goals and on who will be responsible 
for different jobs and tasks within the business. Confusion isn’t a good 
thing in business or in relationships, so define each of your responsibili­
ties from the very beginning.
	
✓	Get important agreements in writing. Of course, you should be able 
to trust your friend or family member without question, but it’s always 
best to get your important agreements in writing. You may choose to 
incorporate these agreements into a legally binding contract. After all, 
people forget; misunderstandings arise; relationships are broken. Why 
not prevent these misfortunes by laying everything out on paper from 
the start?
	
✓	Encourage each other to communicate openly. Communication is 
incredibly important to the success of any business; thus, it’s equally 
important that you and your partner communicate openly and hon­
estly with each other about all aspects of your relationship and your 
business. Always be upfront and open with your business partners, no 
matter who they are or how closely you’re related.
	
✓	Treat each other with respect. You treat your clients and customers 
with respect, and you should treat your partner with respect, too. If 
you don’t respect your partners enough to treat them with the utmost 
respect, don’t team up with them in the first place — you may want to 
reconsider your relationships, too.
	
✓	Take a break from each other whenever necessary. People get on each 
other’s nerves from time to time, no matter how good the relationship is. 
Rather than getting mad or stewing on it, take a break from each other for 
a while. Doing so gives you both time to get over whatever issue is bug­
ging you and to remember why you got together in the first place.
If you do it right, teaming up with a friend or family member can strengthen 
and deepen your personal relationship. Work hard on bringing out the best in 
both of you instead of the worst. For more information on collaborating with 
others, see Paul and Sarah’s eBook (co-authored with Rick Benzel) On Your 
Own But Not Alone (Pine Mountain Institute).

Building a healthy, long-term relationship
If all goes well, working with a friend or family member in your home-based 
business can go a long way in helping you build a deeper and even more 
profound personal relationship. And if you decide to team up with some­
one you love, nurturing your personal relationship is just as important as 
developing a healthy business relationship. If one suffers, the other is sure 
to suffer, as well.
	
The following tips can help you build healthy, long-term relationships — both 
personal and business — with your friends or family members:
	
✓	Do be clear about who’s in charge. In most businesses, one person is 
ultimately in charge and has the right to veto the suggestions or actions 
of others, including partners. Make it clear at the outset who’s in charge, 
but be sure to ask for the input of your partner and to seriously consider 
that input. If your business is a true, legal partnership — with owner­
ship shared in equal amounts — be sure that you establish a system 
for making decisions when you’re in disagreement with your partner. If 
making decisions is problematic for you and your partner, you probably 
shouldn’t be in a business partnership in the first place.
	
✓	Don’t interfere with how your partner achieves his or her goals. Focus 
on agreeing on what your goals are, and then let your partner decide 
how he or she will reach them. Avoid the temptation to micromanage 
your partner’s efforts or to interfere with or second-guess them. You’ll 
only build resentment and erode your long-term relationships.
	
✓	Don’t forget to nurture your private lives. All friends or family mem­
bers who work together need to take time away from the demands of 
their business to focus on themselves and their relationship. You can 
find a number of ways to be fun and spontaneous in your relationship. 
Close the office for a day, and enjoy a long weekend at a resort, at the 
beach, or in the mountains. Take a long lunch together, or treat your­
selves to an afternoon of pampering at a spa or health club. Or simply 
turn off the phone and sleep in late one morning.
	
✓	Do seek the help of a professional counselor if needed. Sometimes 
relationships break, and you need the help of a professional to put them 
back together. Don’t hesitate to seek counseling if your relationship is 
broken — the sooner you do, the easier it’ll be to get things back on 
track.
	
Long-term relationships can be the most meaningful relationships in your life, 
and there’s no reason why you can’t share a meaningful and productive busi­
ness relationship with someone with whom you share a close personal rela­
tionship. It has worked for Paul and Sarah, and it has worked for Peter and his 
wife, Jan. Don’t be afraid to explore the possibilities!

Working at home with a baby
Q: Though I’ve just had a baby, I obviously can’t 
take maternity leave from my home-based 
business. How do I balance the needs of my 
business and my clients with the needs of a 
demanding newborn, each of which take an 
incredible amount of time?
A: Get help. Most female home-based business 
owners do take some type of maternity leave. 
They stagger contracts or clients so they have 
a one- or two-month break, hire temporary or 
part-time personnel, or subcontract work to 
colleagues for a period of time. Get help caring 
for your baby, get help running the business, 
or arrange for some combination of the two. 
Begin by deciding what kind of assistance will 
be most helpful. Ask yourself the following:
	✓	How much time during each day do you 
want to devote entirely to your baby?
	✓	What aspects of your baby’s care can you 
get help with? What do you want to do 
yourself?
	✓	Which business tasks are the most burden­
some right now? Which ones demand your 
full attention without interruption?
	✓	Which tasks must you do? Which ones can 
others do?
By working from home, you have many more 
options for tailoring child-care arrangements to 
your particular needs. For help with your newborn, 
for example, you can hire a nanny to come to your 
home for a few hours each day while you work. 
We hired an elderly woman to help us when our 
son was an infant. Alternatively, you may be able 
to line up help from family or friends, or exchange 
babysitting hours with other new mothers. When 
you feel comfortable taking the baby out, you can 
place him or her in a nearby family day-care home 
for several hours a day.
Sometimes new fathers can take paternity 
leave. Having Dad at home, even part-time, can 
be a big help. Mom and Dad can care for the 
baby in shifts, and Dad can help answer the 
business phone and do other business-related 
tasks. Taking simple steps, such as getting a 
voice mail service or hiring an answering ser­
vice to take your calls, can free you to better 
concentrate on both family and business mat­
ters. Hooking up a baby monitor between your 
baby’s room and your office may also help.
Set up a schedule that suits both your needs as 
a new mother and your work habits. For some 
people, doing so means working only mornings, 
afternoons, or evenings. For others, it involves 
fitting work around the baby’s sleep times. To 
keep your sanity, remember that this is a spe­
cial time. It can be exhausting, but it will pass 
all too soon, so arrange your schedule to enjoy 
it while you can.

Growing Your Business 
in Good Times and Bad
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding success and how to achieve it
▶	Deciding whether or not to grow
▶	Partnering with others smoothly and effectively
▶	Choosing an exit strategy when you need one
A
time comes in the life of every business owner when he or she has to 
decide whether or not to grow the business. Some home-based busi­
nesspeople may find a few clients they like working with and decide they’re 
comfortable with keeping things just the way they are. But if you’re good 
at what you do and your customers love the products and services you 
sell them, don’t be surprised if, after you start your business, they tell their 
friends and colleagues about you — bringing more business your way. If 
enough prospective customers show up at your door, you may be faced with 
more business than you can handle in your present state.
When your business increases to a point where you can’t accommodate it in 
the normal course of your day, you have to make a conscious choice: Reject 
this extra work and maintain the status quo (or perhaps even cut back the 
time and effort you devote to your business to allow yourself to spend more 
time with loved ones, volunteer in your community, or just relax) or take on 
the extra work and grow.
For many home-based business owners, this question never even crosses 
their minds. For them, being in business means growing the business, pure 
and simple. When you grow your business, you have the opportunity to make 
more money, and making more money is a powerful motivator for many 
people. For many others, however, the prospect of growth is something they 
prefer not to embrace. They’re comfortable with things the way they are, 
have made a decision to spend less time working and more time with family 
and friends, or have any of a thousand different reasons why growth doesn’t 
hold any attraction for them.

302
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
	
In the case of growth, the right answer is the one that’s best for you. And what’s 
best for you may or may not be what’s best for your clients and customers, your 
family and friends, and any employees or contractors you may have.
In this chapter, we consider what makes a business a success and examine 
the good and the bad news about owning a growing company. We take a 
close look at expanding your operations and bringing partners into your busi­
ness. Finally, we explore strategies for selling your business and moving on 
to other opportunities.
Becoming a Success
Success is a relative thing. For example, while one home-based business 
owner considers himself a smashing success as he pulls down a $25,000-a-
year, part-time salary, enjoys lots of time with family and friends, and makes 
a nice contribution to the family finances, another may consider that minimal 
level of income to indicate failure.
As the owner of your home-based business, you get to decide how to define 
what success means to you; no one else can or should define it for you. You 
may decide to measure your own success in terms of money or in terms of 
how many clients you can help. Or you may define it by the high quality of 
the products and services you deliver. You may also measure success in 
terms of your ability to achieve an equal balance in your work and personal 
lives. When you’re the one who decides what success means to you, there 
really is no wrong answer.
	
After defining what success means to you, though, you have to have a strategy 
or plan for achieving the goals you’ve set for yourself — like anything else you 
want to achieve in life. Although anyone who puts his or her mind to it will 
find some measure of success, starting up a successful enterprise involves 
more than just working hard.
William Bygrave, former director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies 
at Babson College and one of the nation’s top experts on entrepreneurship, 
described nine keys to success for an entrepreneurial business in his book 
(co-edited with Andrew Zacharakis) The Portable MBA in Entrepreneurship, 
3rd Edition (Wiley). Bygrave called these keys the Nine Fs:
	
✓	Founders: Every startup must have a first-class entrepreneur. (That’s you.)
	
✓	Focused: Entrepreneurial companies focus on niche markets. They spe­
cialize. (Fuzzy companies lead to fuzzy customers; people are willing 
to pay top dollar for products and services that clearly appeal to their 
wants and needs, not ones that may or may not work out.)

303
 Chapter 15: Growing Your Business in Good Times and Bad
	
✓	Fast: Entrepreneurial companies make decisions quickly and implement 
them swiftly (but never so quickly that they don’t take time to understand 
and consider the alternatives before they implement their decisions).
	
✓	Flexible: Entrepreneurial companies keep an open mind. They respond 
to change. (Small, home-based businesses can often respond much more 
quickly to change than larger businesses — a key advantage in today’s 
fast-changing, information-driven marketplace.)
	
✓	Forever innovating: Entrepreneurial companies are tireless innovators 
(at least until 2 or 3 in the morning, when most of them make sure they 
go to bed to get some sleep).
	
✓	Flat: Entrepreneurial organizations have as few layers of management as 
possible. (Quite an easy feat when you’re a sole proprietorship and have 
no employees.)
	
✓	Frugal: By keeping overhead low and productivity high, entrepreneurial 
organizations keep costs down (which makes them more profitable).
	
✓	Friendly: Entrepreneurial companies are friendly to their customers, 
suppliers, and workers. (And because of that quality, their customers, 
suppliers, and workers are friendly right back, demonstrating their 
friendliness with orders for products and services.)
	
✓	Fun: Being associated with a successful entrepreneurial company is fun. 
(Owning your own home-based business doesn’t mean you can’t have 
fun — indeed, if you’re not having fun, why bother?)
Compare the way you do business with the Nine Fs Bygrave describes. Do the 
two have any similarities, or are they miles apart? The more Fs you find in 
your own home-based business, the greater your chances of finding success 
at the end of your rainbow.
Identifying the Upside and 
Downside of Growth
Business growth has ramifications that extend far beyond the simple day-to-
day running of an organization, including the following:
	
✓	Growth means new work, new clients, and new opportunities, but it also 
means more time, more effort, and more energy from you.
	
✓	Growth means more money coming into your business, but it also 
means more money going out.
	
✓	Running a growing business can make your life incredibly busy and 
hectic, but it can also be incredibly rewarding — both financially and 
personally.

304
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
What are your long-term goals for yourself and for your business? Do you 
want to make a certain amount of money every year — enough to allow you 
to support yourself and your family? Do you want to make a certain level of 
profit or service a certain number of customers or clients? Do you want to work 
for a certain number of years or save enough money to travel the world — or 
buy a new car or boat or retire early?
Whatever your long-term goals are, if you decide that growth is indeed in the 
cards for your business, you can’t leave it to chance — you have to have a 
plan to achieve that growth. But don’t forget: Your business will change, as 
will your feelings about it. Be flexible and prepared to change your plans as 
your goals change.
Growth has both good and bad aspects. In the following sections, we explore 
growth in detail so you can decide what growth means to you and whether 
you’d rather grow, maintain the status quo, or perhaps even shrink your 
business operations.
Understanding why you may want to grow
Whenever a business provides quality products or services that people need 
at a fair price, that business tends to grow as new customers seek it out. 
Although the pressure to grow seems inevitable for many businesses — 
especially ones that do a good job for their customers and clients — growth 
is something that’s almost completely within your power to control.
Too many clients? Trim back your client list by removing the marginal ones 
that cost you more to service than they earn you in profit. Too much work? 
Turn down new work until you reach a level you’re comfortable with. Not 
enough time for yourself or your family? Do less work and focus more on the 
things in your life that are most important to you. You’re in charge; you’re 
the boss. The decision is yours.
So given the possible attraction of maintaining the status quo (having less 
work-related stress, spending more time with loved ones, and so on), why 
grow? Here are a number of good reasons:
	
✓	To increase revenue and profits: The immediate impact of growing your 
business is an increase in revenue and — as long as your costs of doing 
business don’t grow out of proportion — an increase in profit. And if 
we’re not mistaken, increasing your profit is probably one of the reasons 
you’re in business for yourself in the first place.
	
✓	To build equity: Equity is the amount of money you have left over after 
you subtract all your company’s liabilities from its assets (see Chapter 6). 
If your business is profitable over a long period of time, or if your business 

305
 Chapter 15: Growing Your Business in Good Times and Bad
catches on with the public and undergoes rapid and substantial growth, 
this number can be quite large. Growing your business is likely to grow 
your equity, as well.
	
✓	To take advantage of economies of scale: The larger your business, the 
more you can take advantage of economies of scale — that is, paying 
lower prices for items you buy in larger quantities. You can, for example, 
purchase a case of laser printer paper at your local Costco warehouse 
store and pay far less per ream than you would if you bought each ream 
individually at FedEx Office.
In the absence of any compelling reasons not to grow, why not grow your 
business? Growth can be exciting and fun, and who knows — it may lead you 
to new and more exciting adventures down the road.
	
Of course, it’s okay not to grow, if that’s the way you decide to run your busi­
ness and your life. As any successful entrepreneur can tell you, growth brings 
with it its own set of headaches and problems. Many people have become 
home-based business owners for just that reason — to leave the rat race and 
get off the never-ending treadmill of business that devours their personal lives. 
Propreneurs — business owners who make a conscious choice not to grow — 
are active and vital players in the U.S. economy, and they tend to be just as 
happy as their entrepreneurial (and more growth-oriented) counterparts.
Recognizing the many 
different ways to grow
When you make the decision to grow your business by increasing your sales 
and enlarging your customer base, realize that you have a number of ways 
to do so. The exact approach you take depends on your growth goals and 
plans and on the nature of your business. The following are some of the most 
common approaches for growing a home-based business:
	
✓	Expand beyond your locale. Do you do work only for people who live 
within a few miles of your home or only for close personal acquaintances? 
If you do, one of the quickest ways to grow your business is to expand 
the area in which you do business. What if you did business citywide 
or countywide? Or perhaps even beyond the boundaries of your state? 
Expanding beyond your immediate locale dramatically increases the 
number of potential clients and customers available to you — potentially 
resulting in increased sales and profits.
	
✓	Get on the Web. With the right Internet presence, the number of people 
who view your product catalog or see your work can mushroom (be 
sure to check out Chapter 13 to find out exactly how to establish the 

306
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
right Internet presence). Many home-based businesses have seen tre­
mendous growth after capturing the imaginations of their customers on 
the Internet.
	
✓	Go international. It’s a great big world out there, and depending on 
the products and services you sell, a huge, underserved international 
market may be waiting for you to tap in to. Web sites such as eBay.com 
and Alibaba.com can turn you into an entrepreneur with nationwide 
and even global reach quite literally overnight. For many growing busi­
nesses, a plan for expanding into international markets is a key success 
strategy.
	
✓	Expand your product line. If you currently carry ten different products and 
you want to double your business, what’s the quickest way to achieve 
your goal? Carry 20 different products. Although the exact impact your 
decision to carry more products will ultimately have on sales depends 
on the products, their pricing, and the extent to which you promote 
them, expanding your product line is a quick and easy way to grow your 
business.
	
✓	Add employees. Adding employees to your business by definition 
means that you’re growing it. Just be sure that you don’t hire new 
employees before you have sufficient business to support them. If your 
revenues are flat or decreasing as you add employees, you have what’s 
commonly known as a going-out-of-business plan, and, as you may have 
guessed, it’s not a plan for home-based business success. Although 
hiring employees can provide your business with the capacity it needs 
to increase sales, it can also dramatically increase your expenses. For 
lots of information on the right way to interview and hire employees, 
check out Managing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Peter Economy and 
Bob Nelson (Wiley).
	
You know your business better than anyone else, so think about what you can 
do to grow your business. One of the benefits of being your own boss is that you 
can do whatever you want with your business, whenever you want. Think 
you have a good idea? Give it a try. Tired of providing a particular product 
or service? Get rid of it. Want to enter a new market or exit an old one? Just do 
it. The more things you try, the higher the probability you’ll find something that 
works.
Begging the question: To grow 
or not to grow?
If you’ve anguished over the decision of whether or not to grow your busi­
ness, you know that the decision isn’t just a business decision — it’s a personal 
one, as well. Because you’re the one who has to live with the consequences of 

307
 Chapter 15: Growing Your Business in Good Times and Bad
your decision to grow or not, it’s in your best interest to thoroughly examine 
yourself, your business, and the marketplace to make sure that whatever 
decision you make is the best one for you and your business.
	
As you consider whether or not to grow your business, we recommend that 
you look in these four places to find the answer:
	
✓	Your heart: The first place to look when you’re thinking about growing 
your business is deep inside your heart. Take some time to get away 
from the hustle and bustle of your business and really listen to what 
your heart tells you. Are you looking forward to the excitement that 
business growth will bring with it, or are you secretly dreading the pos­
sible consequences of such a choice? What does your heart say? If you 
haven’t been in touch with your heart lately, we highly recommend that 
you read the book The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho (HarperCollins).
	
✓	Your lifestyle: Will your preferred lifestyle support or be in conflict with 
the growth of your business? If, for example, the growth of your business 
will take you away from your family — and spending more time with 
your family is one of the key reasons why you started your home-based 
business in the first place — you’ll likely resent the extra time you have 
to devote to your business, as will your family, who will have less of 
your time. You can be sure that growing your company will change your 
life. Be sure that the changes are consistent with the lifestyle you want 
for yourself.
	
✓	The numbers: Of course, your heart and lifestyle may say “go,” while 
your business (more specifically, your business’s financials) says “no.” 
If your company’s sales are too low or costs too high, growing your 
business probably isn’t the best thing to do. Can you somehow increase 
sales or decrease costs enough for growth to make sense? If not, either 
figure out some way to put your financials on the right track or put your 
growth plans on the back burner until the numbers do make sense.
	
✓	The market: You may think it’s time to grow, but the market in which 
your business operates may not be ready for you. Before you invest lots 
of time, money, and effort in growing your business, be sure that enough 
potential customers and clients are interested in buying your products 
and services. If they aren’t, you’re wasting your time and your hard-earned
money — two things that are especially precious for every home-based 
business owner. Remember that your business will thrive only when you 
provide quality products or services that people actually want to buy.
	
All these factors play a role in the growth decision; the weight that you place 
on each depends on your own personal desires and goals. Many businesses 
have succeeded, for example, when the numbers didn’t make sense or when 
the market didn’t seem to offer broad support for a business’s new initiatives. 
But behind businesses that succeeded in these kinds of conditions are incred­
ibly motivated and hard-working business owners.

Bringing In Partners
A partnership is when two or more people team up in the ownership and 
operation of a business. Many well-known businesses started out as successful 
partnerships (and home-based businesses at that), including the following:
	
✓	Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen: They developed and sold 
their first software product out of Bill’s dorm room at Harvard.
	
✓	Apple Computer founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak: They started 
their company in the garage of Jobs’s parents.
Diversifying your client list
Q: I’ve been in business for three years, and 
about 80 percent of my work comes from one 
client. How can I find the time to diversify while 
still keeping my client satisfied?
A: As great as the steady cash flow is, getting 
the bulk of your income from just one client 
puts you at great risk should that client sud­
denly decide to work with someone else. You 
sound as though you not only get 80 percent of 
your income from this one client, but also spend 
most of your time serving him or her. To free 
your time to market and serve new clients, you 
need to get some additional help. Evaluate what 
portions of your work can be done by an assis­
tant, associate, or outside contractor. Arrange 
to free up at least two hours a week for mar­
keting, and begin breaking in someone to work 
with you so that when you generate new busi­
ness, you have dependable help to meet the 
demand.
Although you don’t mention the nature of your 
business, in many fields, self-employed individ­
uals can’t or prefer not to market themselves, 
preferring instead to subcontract their services 
to someone else. Such individuals like to work 
with people like you. Be certain, however, 
that all the billing and all funds come through 
you. Be sure you get clear, written agreements 
preventing associates or subcontractors from 
contracting directly with your clients. Also, you 
need to line up individuals you can depend on to 
do high-quality work within necessary deadlines.
To find associates you can count on, get refer­
rals from sources you trust. Be sure to review 
their work, and talk with them about how they 
approach their work and what their priori­
ties are. Ask for — and check — references. 
Most importantly, start with one small, low-risk 
assignment. Set a clear goal and a specific 
deadline. If the deadline is more than a week 
away, check progress intermittently and, if pos­
sible, ask the associate to turn in portions of the 
work as he or she completes them. Doing so 
can help you identify possible problems before 
they develop.
Keep in mind that working with someone else 
will, in and of itself, take some additional time — 
especially at first. But by building a network of 
others you can subcontract work to, you can 
expand without taking on debt or adding to your 
employee or other operating expenses until you 
have sufficient business to cover them and hire 
one or more employees.

 Chapter 15: Growing Your Business in Good Times and Bad
	
✓	Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin: They started their business 
in a friend’s garage and then promptly raised $1 million from friends, 
family, and other investors to fund their startup.
Although these businesses quickly outgrew their original partnership 
structures — eventually becoming large, multinational (and publicly owned) 
corporations — the combination of the original partners provided the spark 
of creativity and energy that led to great success.
When a partnership works, the business runs like a well-played symphony. 
When it doesn’t, it runs more like a scene from the film Titanic (specifically, 
the part when the ship sinks). Unfortunately, you can’t really know how things 
will turn out until you actually create a partnership and you begin to work 
together with your partner — or not. A partnership is sort of like a marriage; 
you really don’t know how things are going to work — or even if they will 
work — until the honeymoon is over.
	
More than a few friendships, families, and personal relationships have been 
destroyed by partnerships gone bad. Partners can clash in a variety of ways, 
and these clashes may only occur in a business environment under the pres­
sures of deadlines and busy schedules, which is why you should always apply 
the same standards of care when you decide to partner with family or friends 
that you would when hiring a stranger.
	
The following are some tips for ensuring that your partnerships operate 
smoothly. (For more specific information on the partnership form of business — 
including its advantages and disadvantages — take a look at Chapter 10.)
	
✓	Date first. Before getting married, you probably want to date your pro­
spective mate for a while first — a few months or even a few years are 
ideal. Not only does doing so allow you to develop trust and find out 
how to communicate with each other, but it also allows you to see both 
the good and the bad sides of your partner. Business partnerships work 
the same way: Get to know your prospective partner very well before 
you tie the knot. Consider doing shared marketing or a specific project 
together first.
	
✓	Partner only with someone you trust. Trust is the glue that holds a 
partnership together and allows you to achieve great things. Don’t even 
consider — not for a single second! — partnering with someone you 
don’t trust or respect. The road to business success is littered with 
broken partnerships that fell apart as soon as the trust that kept the 
partners together vanished.
	
✓	Don’t partner until you can stand on your own. Partner from a position 
of strength, not weakness. Otherwise, your business will become a code­
pendency and, thus, dysfunctional. And a dysfunctional company will 
have problems serving its customers well and making money.

310
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
	
✓	Enlist partners who add to the business. Ideally, your partner will com­
plement you and bring positive personal value to the company. Short 
on cash? Then find a partner who will provide the cash you need. Need 
help marketing? Then find a partner who’s a strong salesperson. Don’t 
like managing the business? Then find a partner who’s a strong leader 
and administrator. Just as you hire employees who shore up your weak­
nesses, choose partners to cover the skills or connections you lack.
	
✓	Share the equity (and the burden of risk). Sharing equity means sharing 
ownership of the company with your partners. If you don’t share owner­
ship with your partners, they won’t act like they’re owners — they won’t 
value the business the same way you do, and they won’t be willing to 
make the same sacrifices as you to keep the business alive and healthy. 
They may even come to resent you because you hold all the cards. But if 
you agree to share ownership of your company, be sure to require your 
partner to share equally in the risks associated with the business, too.
	
✓	Create a written partnership agreement. Formalize your partnership in 
a written agreement that spells out — clearly and unambiguously — the 
ownership stake of each partner, rights to business proceeds, and his or 
her responsibilities to the business. Our advice is to spend the relatively 
small amount of money necessary to have an attorney draw up a proper 
partnership agreement for you and your prospective partner to sign. 
Many business partnerships eventually fail; when they do, a well-written 
partnership agreement can help protect the huge investment of time and 
money that you’ve made in your business.
Follow these tips, and your partnerships should be happy ones. Of course, 
there are no guarantees. If your partnership turns out not to be one made in 
heaven, you can always split up the partnership and try again, but you’ll have 
a much easier (and more profitable) time if you do your homework and get it 
right the first time. Keep in mind, too, that as Paul and Sarah and Rick Benzel 
describe in their book Teaming Up (Tarcher), partnership is only one of many 
ways to collaborate with others; many of the other methods for collaboration 
carry less risk than partnership.
Cashing Out and Other Exit Strategies
Although most entrepreneurs with young businesses focus on starting and 
growing their businesses, eventually their thoughts turn to other goals — 
specifically, the goal of selling their businesses and cashing out their stake 
and retiring or moving on to something new. For some people, this phenom­
enon occurs at an early age (Peter still dreams of retiring before he hits 55; 
however, the reality of his currently advanced years, along with three kids

Partnering with a spouse or significant other
Turning your life partnership with a spouse or 
significant other into a business partnership 
can be great for your home-based business. 
Or it can be living hell. Because you both live 
under the same roof, this new relationship can 
turn into a never-ending tunnel with no easy 
or apparent exit. Entrepreneur.com (www.
entrepreneur.com) offers the following 
five steps for creating a home-based business 
with your spouse or significant other that’s 
more heaven and less hell:
	 1.	 Divide your roles and responsibilities. 
Each of you has your own unique strengths 
and weaknesses. Take time to assess who 
is best at what. You, for example, may be 
great with numbers and organizing your 
business, while your spouse may be the 
salesperson of the year. Have clear divi­
sions of responsibilities so each of you 
knows who’s supposed to do what.
	 2.	 Develop an effective way to air differences 
and resolve disputes. Don’t let differences 
of opinion or disputes with your significant 
other business partner fester, unaddressed 
and unresolved. Deal with them as they 
occur, and put them behind you as quickly 
as you can. Doing so not only makes for a 
better and more effective business, but it 
also helps ensure that your relationship is 
built to last.
	 3.	 Put a child-care plan in place. If you have 
kids, you need to find a way to do busi­
ness while making sure you also meet their 
needs. Consider bringing in a part- or full-
time sitter — students at local colleges are 
often a great source — or split your duties 
so that one partner takes care of the kids in 
the morning, and the other is in charge of 
the kids in the afternoon. If you have rela­
tives in town who can help (and they want 
to help), use them.
	 4.	 Make sure both of you have enough room 
to work. Although you and your significant 
other may enjoy getting cozy every once in 
a while, working full-time jammed into the 
same small closet of a room can eventually 
drive even the most lovey-dovey couples 
temporarily insane. If you share an office 
or workspace with your business partner, 
make sure it offers plenty of elbow room for 
both of you — and for your computers, files, 
cabinets, desks, tables, chairs, and other 
office equipment.
	 5.	 Agree on an exit strategy before you begin. 
What happens if one or both of you decide 
you want out of the business? Or if you 
and your partner have irreconcilable dif­
ferences and decide that splitting up your 
business partnership is the only way to 
save your life partnership? In the same way 
a prenuptial agreement can make a divorce 
easier for both parties, taking time to decide 
the terms and conditions of the dissolution 
of your business partnership in advance of 
the event is the smart thing to do. Doing so 
may also save your personal relationship.
rapidly approaching college age, may have its own say in the matter). On the 
other hand, some business owners plan to work literally until they take their 
last breaths.

If and when you decide to exit your business, you’ll be faced with even more 
decisions — in particular, when and how to gracefully sever your ties to the 
business so that you don’t damage its value in the process. You can find all 
kinds of strategies for exiting your business, from mild to extreme. Here are 
some of the most common ones:
	
✓	Sell it. Businesses are bought and sold all the time (take a look at sites 
like www.businessesforsale.com or your local newspaper classified 
advertisements for a plethora of examples). If you’ve built a strong 
customer base or have a valuable inventory, or if your operations are 
particularly profitable or otherwise attractive to a potential buyer, you 
may be able to make some significant money in the process of selling 
your business. And that’s not a bad thing!
	
✓	Merge it. Merging your operation with another business can create a 
new business that’s more powerful and profitable than the two busi­
nesses were separately. In a merger, you have the option of stepping 
aside in favor of having the owner of the other company run and operate 
the combined companies while you maintain an ownership stake, or you 
can accept some form of one-time or ongoing payment or royalty while 
acting as a part-time consultant or adviser to the business. Either option 
can make a lot of sense, depending on your personal preferences.
	
✓	Pass it to a family member, friend, or employee. If you have a son, 
daughter, close friend, or employee who’s particularly interested in 
keeping the business going, you always have the option of passing it 
on to him or her. You can choose to pass it on for free, sell it, or set up 
some sort of compensation arrangement, such as an ongoing royalty or 
payment based on a percentage of sales.
	
✓	Close it. Of course, you can simply close the business, unplug your 
answering machine, and move on with your life. For many home-based 
business owners interested in exiting their businesses, this option is by 
far the simplest. If you decide on this option, don’t just leave your cus­
tomers hanging out to dry, wondering where their orders are — make 
sure you take care of them before you call it quits. See the “Shutting 
down your business” sidebar for ideas on how to make sure your loyal 
customers are taken care of.
	
Whatever you decide, be sure to carefully match it with your long-term goals. 
If you merge the business with another or pass it to a family member, friend, 
or employee, you may have the opportunity to keep your finger in the busi­
ness’s operations if you so desire. If you sell or close it, however, chances 
are slim (very, very slim, in the case of a closed business) that you’ll be able 
to have anything further to do with it. Is that what you really want? Are you 
really ready to call it quits? Only you know the answers to these questions, 
and only you can make the ultimate decision.

 Chapter 15: Growing Your Business in Good Times and Bad
Putting a value on your business
If you decide to sell your business, the first question your potential buyer is 
likely to ask is “How much do you want for it?” So, do you have any idea how 
much your business is worth? If you do, are you sure the price is right?
You can establish a price for a business using a number of different methods. 
If you’re thinking about selling your home-based business, consider the 
following:
	
✓	The firm’s earning capacity: How much money does your business rake 
in every month or year? Are your sales high enough to offset expenses 
and leave a reasonable profit behind? The higher the earning capacity of 
a business, the more it’s worth to a potential buyer and the more he or 
she is willing to pay you for it.
Shutting down your business
Unfortunately, not every home-based busi­
ness is destined to last forever, which means 
that, at some point, you may have to close 
yours — whether by choice or because of cir­
cumstances out of your control. According to 
a study released by Discover Small Business 
Watch in 2009, 36 percent of small business 
owners reported that they would close their 
companies if they could find a better paying 
job working for someone else. This figure is up 
from 30 percent in 2008. According to the study, 
the reasons for this increase are because of 
the difficulty of finding new business during the 
recession and the hassle of dealing with gov­
ernment regulations.
If you decide to close your business for what­
ever reason, here are a few tips to ensure that 
your customers aren’t left out in the cold:
	✓	Give your customers plenty of notice. A 
month isn’t too much time.
	✓	Refer your customers to companies like 
yours, including former competitors. (After 
all, you don’t need to worry about them 
anymore, right?) The idea is to give your 
customers as many options and alterna­
tives as possible.
	✓	Offer to train your customers to do what you 
do. You may have a customer or two who’d 
like to start a business like yours or add 
your business to their own. You may even 
decide to become a consultant — training 
others to do what you’ve been doing for so 
long.
	✓	Subcontract the work to another company 
or individual in your field.
	✓	If you have a contract that’s legally assign­
able, sell or transfer it to another company 
capable of satisfying your client’s needs. 
Whether required by your contract or not, 
preparing your client for a change in who’ll 
be providing his or her goods or services is 
always a good policy to follow.
	✓	Sell your client list to another company or 
individual in your field, letting your custom­
ers know you’re doing so and introducing 
them to the person or company who’ll be 
filling their needs in your place.

314
Part IV: Making It Work: Moving Ahead 
	
✓	The value of its assets: If you have a lot of money tied up in physical 
assets, such as inventory (the products you keep on the shelf to sell to 
customers), machinery (medical transcription equipment or mechanic’s 
tools, for example), or intellectual property (trademarks, patents, trade 
secrets, and so forth), the worth of your business will surely be influ­
enced — or perhaps even determined — by the value of your assets. 
The higher the value of your assets — and the ease with which they can 
be converted to immediate use by a buyer or into liquid assets such as 
cash — the more money you can demand for your business.
	
✓	The market value of similar firms: The value of firms similar to yours 
inevitably has a significant influence on the value of your firm. You can 
get a rough idea of your firm’s value by finding out what similar busi­
nesses are selling for. Try listings of businesses for sale in your local 
newspaper classified ads or check out www.businessesforsale.com.
	
✓	The value of the company’s stock: If your business is organized as a 
corporation and you have issued stock, that stock has value. Because 
buying stock in a company is the same as buying the company itself, the 
value of that stock can often determine the value of the business.
Now what?
So you’ve sold your business or handed it over to your daughter, and you’ve 
done your best to keep your nose out of how she’s running it. But for years, 
you’ve spent the better part of your waking hours working and, lately, run­
ning your own business. Now what?
Many people dream about retirement their whole working lives, but, after 
they get there, they find that they miss the action, the demands, and the 
responsibilities of a busy business environment. Of course, others adjust to 
their retirement just fine and spend their days traveling the world, fishing, 
or enjoying a good book. If you’re ready to take the next step, but you’re not 
exactly sure what that step is, be sure to read Paul and Sarah’s eBook The 
Practical Dreamer’s Handbook: Finding the Time, Money, & Energy to Live the 
Life You Want to Live (Elm Street Library).
	
Whatever you decide, don’t forget that you always have one option open to 
you: starting another business. As this book describes, starting your own 
home-based business can be amazingly simple, and the rewards can be many.

lthough no one can guarantee that your home-based business will be a 
success, if you work hard, price your products and services right, and 
keep your customers satisfied, you stand a good chance of building a suc­
cessful company. The results you get out of your business are a direct result 
of the work you put into it. As you probably already know, that relationship 
between work and results is one of the real joys of having a home-based busi­
ness. If you do a good job, you will be rewarded. Plus, you get the satisfaction 
of having happy clients and customers tell you how much they enjoy doing 
business with you — and buying more of your products and services.
The most successful home-based business owners — those who get the 
results they hoped for — share a variety of traits. We discuss ten of these 
traits in this chapter.
Do What You Love
All jobholders dream about the jobs they’d love to do if only they had the 
opportunity. Unfortunately, many people work their current jobs mostly 
because they have to pay the bills, not because they’ve always dreamed of 
doing their particular work. But what if you could do what you really loved 

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
to do? Wouldn’t that be great? Well, it is, and it’s exactly the opportunity you 
get by starting your own business. But to do what you love, you first have to 
know what kind of work you really want to do. This discovery requires deep 
introspection and an understanding of which kinds of work get your creative 
juices flowing and which kinds dry them up.
Doing what you love also sometimes requires that you ignore what other 
people want you to do for a living. You may decide, for example, that you’d 
really like to start a photography studio in your home, but your spouse or best 
friend may think something more practical, such as buying a successful pet 
store in the local mall, makes more sense. Ultimately, you must decide what 
you really want to do for a living — even if it means you can’t work at home.
	
It’s your dream — you’re the one who gets to choose it (and live it!). No one 
else has the right to tell you what kind of work you should love — and do.
Treat Your Business like a Business
If you want your business to be a real business — an organization that gener­
ates the kind of money that will allow you to become financially independent — 
you have to treat it like one, not like a hobby or a momentary fling. Here are 
some ideas to help you treat your business as what it is — a business:
	
✓	Set aside an entire room in your home — not just a closet or a shelf — 
exclusively for your business (see Chapter 14).
	
✓	Make a serious investment in business equipment and supplies: a decent 
computer, a dedicated phone line, and whatever else is required to 
effectively and efficiently run your operation.
	
✓	Create a marketing plan and follow through with it (see Chapter 4).
	
✓	Publicize your company’s products and services to a wide audience of 
potential customers and clients.
	
✓	Build a strong customer base and make plans for future growth (see 
Chapter 15).
	
Being serious about your business doesn’t mean that you can’t have fun, 
though, or that you can’t make up your own rules along the way. Indeed, being 
your own boss means that you get to decide how you’re going to run your 
business. If you want to work only on weekday afternoons, for example — 
setting aside mornings for exercise or spending time with your kids — you 
can do so and still have a serious business.

 Chapter 16: Ten Tips for How to Succeed in Your Home-Based Business
Become an Expert
People naturally respect those who know more than they do. By specializing 
in a particular area of expertise — whether it’s where to dig a new water 
well, how to scrapbook, or what to do in a financial crisis — you assume the 
role of a presumed expert, even if you’ve just started your business. It makes 
good business sense for your clients to hire an expert instead of someone 
less experienced. By avoiding the mistakes and dead ends that someone with 
less experience may make, you can help your clients spend less money by 
hiring you — even if your hourly rates are higher.
	
The interesting thing about becoming an expert is that the passage of time 
makes you increasingly more experienced in your field. As time goes on, 
potential clients and customers will seek you out just to get the benefit of the 
expertise you’ve developed through experience and education.
Don’t Be Shy
Companies don’t spend millions of dollars advertising their products in the 
media for no reason; they do so because media advertising is a particularly 
effective way to get the attention (and, ideally, the business) of potential cus­
tomers. Unfortunately, far too many people believe that a good idea is all a 
successful business needs. In the real world, however, it takes far more than 
that; the world is chock-full of good ideas that have gone nowhere fast. Even 
the best ideas have to be packaged, presented, and sold, and the key is to 
identify and use marketing methods best suited to both your personality and 
your business.
	
Although you may never have had to sell yourself or your products before, 
you can’t avoid doing so when you own your own business. After you gener­
ate momentum and build a strong customer base, you can rely more on refer­
rals from your happy clients to do the marketing for you. (Peter, for example, 
rarely seeks new business — most of his new clients come to him via refer­
rals from satisfied customers.) But when you’re getting your business off the 
ground, consider and attempt every possible method for selling your products 
and services.
For a complete discussion of the hows and whys of marketing your products 
and services, check out Chapter 4.

Charge What You’re Worth
No matter how hard you work, if you charge your customers less than you’re 
worth, you won’t be able to stay in business for long. Why would you charge 
less than you’re worth? Well, some people do so because they don’t realize 
exactly how much they are worth. Others charge less than they’re worth 
because they’re embarrassed or afraid to ask for an amount that reflects 
their true worth. Whatever the reason, if you don’t get paid what you’re 
worth, you may very well drive yourself out of business.
	
If you don’t know what you’re worth, find out what other companies charge 
for similar products or services by researching catalogs, price lists, stores, 
and e-commerce and auction Web sites. If you can’t find written prices or list­
ings on the Web, call or e-mail the companies for information. From there, 
develop a pricing or fee structure that will help you attain your personal goals. 
(Check out Chapter 7 for more info on setting the right prices.)
	
After you figure out what you should charge, use the following tips to get the 
price you want:
	
✓	Become a master at selling the value that your products and services 
offer to your customers and clients. They won’t know why your prod­
ucts and services are better than others if you don’t tell them, so tell 
them often and in a variety of ways.
	
✓	Be creative in how you’re paid. Many successful home-based business 
owners take cash out of the equation by bartering their products or 
services with others. For example, Valerie Whitlock — owner of Fancy 
Pants Jewelry — has received microdermabrasion treatments, a used 
Apple G4 iBook computer, and Marc Jacobs jeans in exchange for her 
hand-crafted jewelry.
	
✓	Get past any hang-ups you have about charging your customers and 
clients what you’re worth. Practice asking your price in front of a 
mirror or with someone you trust to give you constructive criticism just 
as you would practice a request for a raise or a speech. Believe us, after 
you go through the process a few times with prospective clients — and 
discover that they still want to hire you — you’ll find it easier to demand 
a price that reflects what you’re really worth.
Avoid Unnecessary Expenses
Shopping for the latest and greatest business gadgets and equipment is fun — 
a lot of fun. And treating clients to expensive lunches and dinners and driving 
that snazzy new company car are also fun. The bad news about all this fun is 

321
 Chapter 16: Ten Tips for How to Succeed in Your Home-Based Business
that it can be expensive (and some of it may not be tax-deductible) and detri­
mental to your company’s financial health and welfare.
	
Spend your company’s hard-earned money only when you have to. A good 
example of this is your personal computer. Every other week, computer tech­
nology makes another great leap forward, which may constantly tempt you 
to upgrade to the latest and greatest and fastest computer with all the latest 
bells and whistles. Unless your older, slower, and less flashy computer — and 
the software within it — is actually getting in the way of your ability to do 
business efficently, stick with it for as long as you possibly can. Think about 
adding a bigger hard drive, more RAM, or other upgrades that improve per­
formance at a cost far less than buying a new computer. Eventually, you’ll 
need to replace that old slug of a computer, but the longer you can defer the 
expense, the better for your company’s bottom line.
	
Do your best to hold the line on all the other expenses that simply drain your 
financial reserves while bringing in little or no additional revenue. If you’re 
going to eat out, for example, go to less expensive places. Save the expensive 
meals for your highest-paying customers. Or consider inviting your best cus­
tomers over as dinner guests in your home.
Manage Your Cash Flow
Cash, or the lack of it, is one of the key indicators of a company’s success over 
the long run. If you have cash, you can buy and stock new products for your 
customers, develop innovative new services for your clients, pay for your day-
to-day operations, and expand your business. If you don’t have cash, your busi­
ness will certainly suffer, and so will your customers and clients. You may even 
jeopardize your own personal or family financial situation.
	
Simply watching your cash flow — the money going in and out of your 
business — isn’t enough; you also have to actively manage it. Managing your 
cash flow means looking to the future, planning and scheduling your projected 
cash inflows and outflows, billing quickly, staying on top of money owed you, 
and paying attention to the money that goes in and out of your business. 
Peter’s most important business tool after his computer is the rolling cash-flow 
projection he uses to project how much cash he will receive from customers 
each month for a year into the future. See Chapter 6 for more ideas.
Keep Your Day Job
The best way to work into your own successful home-based business is to start 
out while retaining your full-time conventional job. Not only does maintaining 

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
your day job keep your income safe and sound while your home business’s 
revenues ramp up — a process that can take months or even years — but it also 
allows you to keep your healthcare and other benefits in place (not to mention 
it allows your employer to continue making contributions to the cost of these 
benefits, if applicable in your case). A rule of thumb for when to transition to 
your business full time is when your business income will sustain your mini­
mal living expenses and you feel confident that by putting in more time, you’ll 
increase your business’s earnings. (Check out Chapter 3 for more details.)
	
When Peter embarked on his new writing career a number of years ago, he 
did so within the safety of his full-time job. While he established his business 
on his own time — during lunch hours and after work — Peter drew a regular 
salary, health benefits, and a retirement plan from his day job. Finally, when 
the time was right, Peter left his day job and moved into his home-based writ­
ing career full time.
By approaching the transition to self-employment this way, you can discover 
whether you’ve picked the right business — and whether you’re right for the 
business — without risking unemployment if it doesn’t work out.
Build a Solid Customer Base
One of the most important ways to establish a successful business is to build 
a solid base of customers who stick with you through thick and thin. This solid 
customer base becomes the foundation on which you grow your business.
Of course, building a solid customer base is much easier said than done. At 
the heart of the process is creating an organization that values its current 
customers and goes out of its way to ensure their satisfaction and happi­
ness. Customers are smart — they can tell whether they’re high or low on a 
company’s priority list. If they sense that you don’t care much about whether 
or not they do business with you, they’ll likely jump ship as soon as another 
company that really does care about them comes along.
	
Always remember the feeling you get when you land your first customer and 
receive your first payment for your products; then treat all your customers as 
though they were your first. Value them every day, and, in turn, they’ll value you.

 Chapter 16: Ten Tips for How to Succeed in Your Home-Based Business
Ask for Referrals
The word-of-mouth referral is probably the least expensive and the most effec­
tive way of getting new business — for any business — which makes referrals 
the most important way for home-based businesses to market themselves. 
Here are some of the best ways to earn great referrals from customers:
	
✓	Do great work. When you do great work, your clients are happy to give 
you great referrals. When you do less-than-great work, you’ll be lucky to 
get a kick in the pants, much less a referral.
	
✓	Do your work on time and within budget. Do you want to know the 
quickest way to your customer’s heart? Do your work on time and within 
budget. If you consistently deliver on your promises, you’ll soon have 
more business than you ever thought possible. And you’ll earn your cli­
ents’ referrals at the same time.
	
✓	Keep your clients well informed. When clients spend their money on 
you, they want to be kept apprised of your progress, not only to stay 
in touch with the project, but also to keep a watchful eye out for prob­
lems before they get out of hand. Do your clients a favor, and keep them 
informed about your project’s progress. Whether the news is good or 
bad, your clients and customers will appreciate your forthrightness and 
candor.
	
✓	Be dependable. If anything, you should always keep your word — even 
when it hurts. If you promise to do something, do everything in your 
power to keep your promise, no matter what it takes to follow through 
on it. Who would impress you more (and earn your referral) — a busi­
ness owner who consistently delivers a week or even a month later than 
promised, or an owner who delivers on time, every time?
	
✓	Be flexible. Customers and clients appreciate vendors who are flexible 
and willing to meet their needs, no matter what those needs may be. Not 
only do they appreciate that flexibility, but they also pay more for it. 
Think about what you can do in your business to better meet your cus­
tomers’ needs, and then do it.
	
✓	Thank your clients for their referrals. Everyone likes to be appreci­
ated for what they do. Your customers are no different. Be sure to thank 
them for their referrals with a hand-signed card or small gift.
Many small businesses get the vast majority of their new business through 
referrals. They really are worth their weight in gold! Take a look at Chapter 4 
for more on referrals.

Business Opportunities

▶	Looking at modern-day repair work
▶	Helping out with human services
S
ome home-business opportunities are here today, gone tomorrow. In this 
chapter, we present ten home business opportunities that are built to 
last. Get started with one of these, and you’re likely to have a business you 
can grow old with.
Architectural Salvage
Whether you’re motivated by the fact that you can make money from reusing 
what would otherwise be waste, saving something from the past, or keeping 
landfills from filling up, architectural salvage may be just the right business 
for you. Architectural salvage as a business field will continue to grow in 
the future as the economies of China, India, and other nations continue to 
expand rapidly, gobbling up building supplies and materials in the process. 
These economies have to get their materials from some place — why not get 
them from you?
When you tear down a 2,000-square-foot home, for example, you can reuse 
(and thus sell) 125,000 pounds of mined metals and other minerals in the 
form of bathroom fixtures, bricks, ceramic tiles, mantles, piping, and so on. 
The same is true for remodeled homes and buildings, which leaves you with 
ample material for salvage (and thus ample material to sell).
Obtaining these materials requires deconstructing a home or building, 
which is a slower process than just tearing it down, which is where you as 
an entrepreneur come in. You do the deconstruction in exchange for what is 

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
salvaged. Before you can sell what you salvage, you may need to refurbish it. 
Then you can sell the salvage to one of the many architectural salvage stores 
opening in cities across the country, on www.craigslist.com, which has 
the advantage of charging no listing fees, or through architectural galleries 
like www.architecturals.net.
	
You can get accredited in deconstruction, thus making yourself more credible 
and marketable, by taking a one-day course offered by the Building Materials 
Reuse Association (check out www.bmra.org for more info).
Cleaning Services
Although many people deem having a maid or cleaning service a luxury — and 
something that may be cut when budgets are tight — this business won’t go 
away until the supply of dust and mold runs out. In fact, new opportunities arise 
in a down economy as building and store owners decide to contract out cleaning 
services instead of paying salaries and benefits for full-time employees.
Cleaning services take many forms, ranging from home and office cleaning 
services that do routine cleaning to more specialized services that require 
either specific equipment, such as pressure cleaning and rug cleaning, or 
the willingness to do particularly challenging or unpleasant work, such as 
window washing, crime scene and disaster clean-up, and rubbish removal.
A growing number of people who associate allergies and respiratory illnesses 
with air pollutants are seeking green cleaning services for their homes and 
offices. Green cleaning services use special cleaning methods, nontoxic 
products, and equipment and supplies like HEPA-filter vacuum cleaners and 
microfiber cloths that clean surfaces without chemical cleaners.
Another significant market for cleaning services is elderly people living inde­
pendently who no longer have the physical ability to do their own cleaning. 
Sometimes their children pay someone else — who could be you — to keep 
their parents’ homes clean.

and janitorial supply stores for free training classes.
Collections Work
Bill collectors keep busy because companies, service providers, and gov­
ernment agencies have to collect money owed to them. Today the need is 
particularly high among doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers 

327
 Chapter 17: Ten Enduring Home Business Opportunities
because 62 percent of bankruptcies are caused by health expenses. This 
reality and the fact that people fall behind in all kinds of bills translate into 
a home business for anyone who can be part parent, part counselor, part 
teacher, and part coach in helping debtors organize their finances to repay 
what they owe. Most people want to pay their bills but are under economic 
distress and need coaxing and coaching to do so.
Home-based bill collectors with low overhead expenses have an advantage 
over high-pressure, results-driven staffs of large collection companies because 
they can take the time to be more successful in working with debtors. Having 
second-language skills can also give you an edge over your competition. Be 
aware that some states require licenses of collection agencies and some 
require posting a bond.
	
The Debt Collectors Collection Training System (available at www.Michelle
Dunn.com) and sites such as www.startingacollectionagency.com can 
help you get your own collections business underway. These resources can 
provide key information you need to know, such as the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and postal regulations.
Community Management
Community management isn’t a new concept, but it is growing in new ways 
in today’s society, which is where you and your home-based business come 
in. The most established form of community management is managing one of 
300,000 homeowner association–governed communities, many of which are 
large enough to hire their own manager or to contract with a management 
company (which could be you) that provides virtual management, in which 
case you don’t have to live in the community you manage.
The number of management opportunities continues to grow as four out of 
five new homes are built in association-governed communities. Community 
associations that enable seniors to live independently in their own homes 
also have a need for professional community management. The model for 
this type of association is Beacon Hill Village in Boston (www.beaconhill
village.org). Cooperative housing developments that are too large for 
their resident owners to manage on their own are another example of a com­
munity in need of the increasingly popular community management services 
that you can offer from the comfort of your own home.
Community associations are a combination of a de facto government, a business 
organization, and a social entity composed of many (sometimes conflicting) 
human needs. Thus, to be a successful community manager, you need to be 
a leader with a wide range of disparate skills. The largest association of com­
munity managers is the Community Associations Institute (www.caionline.
org), which provides training and certification.

Elder Services and Home Care
While people may need elder services at an earlier age today (thanks to the 
geographic scattering of families and the physical damage caused by stress 
and unhealthy lifestyles), the fastest growing segment of the population 
is people older than 85. From just more than 4 million in 2000, the number of 
people older than 85 will quintuple to 21 million by midcentury. Improvements 
in medical care enable people to live longer — and to live independently longer, 
although independent living is somewhat of a misnomer because the elderly 
who live in their own homes often require support services of one kind or 
another. This need for support means potential customers for many home-
based home-care businesses.
Geriatric care managers who assess the needs of seniors are very much in 
demand; however, you can’t receive certification to be a geriatric care man­
ager unless you have a recognized credential in gerontology, nursing, social 
work, or psychology. Luckily, you can find some home-based opportunities 
for people without a background in the health field.
Nonmedical caregivers help elderly clients manage their daily activities. 
Responsibilities range from cleaning homes and doing laundry to paying bills 
to helping with personal grooming to driving seniors to appointments. Tricia 
Lee, who operates TimeSavers of Pensacola, Inc., a home-based business that 
provides transportation services to seniors and others so they can go to the 
doctor, the grocery store, and other places, said, “This is satisfying work. I 
look forward to seeing my customers. We love each other. We hug when we 
meet and when we part.”
Seniors also may need to move, and, when they do, they need help. 
Companies like Gentle Transitions (www.gentletransitions.com) and 
Smooth Mooove Senior Relocation Services (www.wemoveseniors.com) 
provide moving services tailored to the special needs of seniors, and you 
can, too.
	
When seniors can’t afford to pay you, often their adult children — who may 
live far away or who just can’t provide these services themselves — are willing 
to pick up the tab.
	
The AARP Guide to Internet Resources Related to Aging (www.aarp.org/
internetresources) provides quite a few links related to senior services 
that can help you start researching this business field.

Investigative and Security Services
The challenges of protecting yourself and your assets from thieves, terrorists, 
crooks, and computer crime is spurring a growing security industry. The 
result is a flood of new investigative specializations, such as data recovery 
and electronic theft investigation — each of which requires special training. 
Other businesses are adapting their existing experience and know-how to 
create new niches in the security field. Specialization is particularly impor­
tant in this field because it enables the home-based businessperson to more 
easily identify, reach, and gain the respect of clients.
Surveillance work and background checking are staples of the investigation 
field. Here are some additional specialties:
	
✓	Security consulting: Some security consultants sell products from which 
they earn a commission; others provide expertise and are paid by the 
hour or on a per-project basis. They write security plans and design and 
install systems. Areas of specialization include customer theft, product 
piracy, electronic theft, electronic security systems, employee theft, 
protection of intangibles like client lists and proprietary technology, and 
real estate or other tangible property protection.
	
✓	Site consulting: Security is an issue for virtually every building and 
office, from high-tech industrial complexes to distribution centers, retail 
stores, self-storage facilities, housing developments, hotels, resorts, 
casinos, parking lots, and hospitals. Site consultants help businesses 
and institutions address security concerns about their facilities. They 
evaluate the physical design of buildings and spaces. They determine 
what security risks a site poses and recommend countermeasures, from 
hiring guards to installing electronic security systems with cameras and 
electric lights, or a combination of such methods and policies.
	
✓	Systems design: Security system designers prevent security problems 
by developing specifications and providing architectural or engineer­
ing support during the design phase of a security consulting project. 
Systems designers may also develop new electronic security tools to be 
used at specific locations.
	
✓	Forensic consulting: Forensic security consultants step in after security 
problems have already occurred. They serve as expert witnesses in 
trials where security breaches are at issue, such as those involving fires, 
thefts, break-ins, and so on. Forensic consultants may focus on any of 
the security specialties.
	
You can find dozens of links (sorted by location) related to security specialties 
on the PI Magazine Web site at www.pimagazine.com/links.

Microfarming
Microfarming, or farming on small acreages, feeds a growing public appetite 
for locally grown food, which makes it a great business to get into. Whether 
or not it’s grown to meet organic standards for certification, microfarmed 
food most often comes to harvest with no or few chemical pesticides or fertil­
izers and no or little irradiation. Small growers produce many of the locally 
grown produce, fresh herbs, spa products, and edible flowers you find at 
farmer’s markets, roadside stands, and gourmet restaurants. People who 
microfarm say it provides a deep sense of physical well-being and a spiritual 
connection to the land, whether they do so to feed people in nearby house­
holds or to produce an unusual crop for export.
You can locate a microfarm in a basement, a backyard, or on a few acres. And 
plants aren’t the only crops being produced on small farms; people are micro­
farming fish and livestock, too. New technologies are increasingly available 
to make microfarming in a city easier. For example, the Topsy Turvy Upside 
Down Tomato Planter (www.topsygardening.com) eliminates the problem 
of weeding and ground insects. As you may expect, people living in warmer 
climates have the advantage of being able to grow several crops a year.
	
Among the many available microfarming resources are the ATTRA National 
Sustainable Agriculture Information Service Web site (www.attra.org) and 
New Farm, an online newsletter and Web site from the Rodale Institute (www.
rodaleinstitute.org/new_farm).
Repair and Restoration Services
Repair and restoration businesses do particularly well during economic 
downturns, but survey after survey shows that people plan to remain cost 
conscious even when the economy picks up. This attitude bodes well for 
repair and restoration businesses because fixing or restoring something 
often costs less than tossing out the old and buying something new, particu­
larly when what’s new isn’t affordable.
	
Repair businesses mend things to sound or working condition; restoration 
businesses return damaged or worn things to their original, normal, or unim­
paired conditions.
The kinds of repair businesses you can operate at home or out of your truck 
or van include fixing toys, bikes, lawnmowers, lamps, jewelry, watches, 
clocks, and anything else people would rather fix than replace, along with 
sharpening knives and scissors.

331
 Chapter 17: Ten Enduring Home Business Opportunities
Restoration work can transform one person’s junk into another person’s 
valuable antique — turning a $50 craigslist purchase into a $1,000 collector’s 
item. Restoration can take many forms: stripping, caning, staining, varnish­
ing, repairing porcelain and enameled iron work, and more. You can restore 
smaller items from your garage, or you can restore other people’s homes and 
offices on site.
	
Find out more information about the restoration business at the Association 
of Restorers’ Web site (www.assoc-restorers.com).
Robot Repair
You can find robots in hospitals, homes, schools, factories, and soon even 
on farms. People today are just beginning to see the many ways robots can 
become a part of their home and work lives. In fact, according to Glenn Dantes, 
partner in Industrial Control Repair, Inc. (www.industrialcontrol
repair.com), which has created several niches in the expanding robotics 
field, “Anywhere a person is doing a physical task, a robot can do that task.”
One day soon service robots like “Nursebot” and “Carebot” may “live” in 
the homes of elderly people, helping them to live independently. Prototypes 
for robotics-assisted exoskeletons that will give people who are disabled, 
elderly, or injured the ability to walk, run, and climb stairs, are already being 
created. Such dependency on robotic assistance means that robot repairs 
will have to be immediate whenever a robot breaks down. Robots also 
require ongoing maintenance, and their growing pervasiveness opens oppor­
tunities for home businesses — self-employed technicians and specialists — 
to participate in this field.
To find out more about industrial robots, check out the Robotics Industry 
Association’s Web site at www.roboticsonline.com; for consumer robots, 
check out Robotics Daily at www.roboticsdaily.com.
Tutoring and Adult Education
Since the last edition of this book, tutoring has grown from being exclusively 
a local face-to-face business to also being a popular online business. As a 
tutor, you can both develop a local clientele and offer what you know at sites 
like www.teachstreet.com, www.eprep.com, and half a dozen others.

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Because learning has become a lifelong activity for many people, both by 
choice and by necessity, tutoring possibilities extend far beyond just aca­
demic subjects to life skills, such as finance and accounting, boat building, 
and search engine optimization. Here are a few examples of both academic 
and adult education tutoring:
	
✓	Academic tutoring: Most public education doesn’t prepare students for 
the demands of entering college or beginning a career in the 21st century. 
As a result, all age levels need tutors. Beyond the success parents seek for 
their children, the No Child Left Behind program creates an extensive 
demand for tutoring. To get into college, students need tutoring to pass 
tests like the SAT and ACT, along with the PSAT if they seek National 
Merit scholarships. After enrolling in college, 28 percent of freshmen 
are enrolled in remedial math or English, and many of these students 
turn to tutors for help. To get into graduate schools, college seniors 
need tutoring to prepare for tests such as the GRE and LSAT. Check out 
the National Tutoring Association’s Web site (www.ntatutor.org) for 
more info on academic tutoring.
	
✓	Adult education: With the rapid changes in the economy brought about 
by global competition and advances in technology, many adults continu­
ally need new skills. Others seek to develop skills or hobbies they didn’t 
get a chance to learn when they were younger, whether it’s voice, piano, 
golf, or guitar. Thus, adult education is becoming more and more promi­
nent in today’s society. Check out the American Society for Training and 
Development’s Web site at www.astd.org.

Ten Things to Do When 
Times Are Tough
In This Chapter
▶	Maintaining good relations with customers and getting them to pay their bills
▶	Finding ways to cut expenses
▶	Offering special promotions
M
ake no mistake about it: Starting and operating a home-based 
business — and making a profit — isn’t easy. In fact, it’s a real job. 
Although failure rates for home-based businesses aren’t nearly as high as 
many people have been led to believe (see Chapter 3 for details), more than 
a few give up every year. Why? Because even the best of plans sometimes go 
awry, if only for a short time. Because of your business’s inherent smallness, 
you may not have enough clients to manage the financial roller coaster that 
can result when a customer goes bankrupt, puts you on a slow-pay plan, or 
switches vendors.
Good planning can help you see far enough out on the horizon to anticipate 
the most serious financial shortfalls — and then take steps to avoid them — 
but it’s impossible to anticipate each and every bump in the road and miss 
them when they arrive. Use the ten tips in this chapter to help you weather 
the unpredictable storms and emerge stronger than ever.
Save for a Rainy Day
Even if you find yourself making a lot of money for some period of time — for 
weeks, or even months — every business owner knows that there are no 
guarantees, and tough times can be right around the corner. One of the best 
things you can do is put aside money when times are good. Although it’s 
tempting (and fun!) to run out and purchase the latest computer, the most 
recent software update, or a new furniture setup when the money’s rolling 
in, first be sure that you set aside cash in your business savings account or 
money-market fund to help you through a rough patch of business.

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Here’s a goal that will help you weather a storm when it arrives: Build a cash 
reserve sufficient to run your business for a minimum of three months, pref­
erably six to twelve months. After you have your cash reserve established 
and funded, you can go out and buy all that fun stuff you’ve had your eyes on.
Manage Your Cash Flow
Cash flow — more specifically, maintaining a positive cash flow — is by far 
the number-one financial issue facing every small business owner. And if 
you rely 100 percent on the proceeds of your home-based business to sup­
port you and your family or significant other and to pay for healthcare and 
other essential benefits, without the kind of steady income that a regular job 
brings, a shortfall in cash can quickly bring financial disaster.
	
The solution is to manage your cash flow (see Chapter 6), which means 
making a habit of doing the following:
	
✓	Keep an eye on your net cash flow. List all the cash you expect to 
receive (cash inflows) during a specific period of time, and compare that 
amount with the cash you expect to pay out (cash outflows) during the 
same period of time. Study this information religiously, at least once 
a week. You can put together a simple handwritten or computerized 
spreadsheet, or many popular business accounting programs, such as 
QuickBooks, have built-in functions for monitoring cash flow. Use them!
	
✓	Be proactive in bringing cash into your business as quickly as possible. 
Don’t sit around waiting for customers to pay you when they get around 
to it; get your money as soon as you can. Try to get paid when you 
deliver your products or services instead of invoicing your customers after 
the fact. You can do so by requiring customers to pay by credit card or 
by negotiating advance payments with them. Or simply require payment 
by cash or check upon delivery. If you sell over the Internet or through an 
online-store host (such as Yahoo! Store), most customers already expect to 
pay by credit card or a payment service such as PayPal.
	
✓	Pay your bills only when they’re due, but do so in time to avoid inter­
est and penalties. There’s no advantage for you to pay your bills before 
they’re due. In fact, after you pay a bill, you lose the advantage of having 
the cash in your own bank account. If payment on a vendor invoice isn’t 
due for 30 days from today, don’t pay it tomorrow. Pay it when it’s due. If 
you make your payment online, pay your bill a day or two before it’s due 
to ensure your payment is credited electronically by the due date. If you 
mail in your payment, put the envelope in the mailbox a week before the 
due date. The idea is to be paid by your clients before you have to turn 
around and make payments to your vendors. By paying as late as you pos­
sibly can — while still paying on time — you can optimize your cash flow.

335
 Chapter 18: Ten Things to Do When Times Are Tough
Keep in Touch with Your Customers
Business is all about relationships: More than just a few businesses have found 
incredible success because of the close relationships their owners have estab­
lished with their clients and customers. After all, given the option, wouldn’t 
you rather work with someone you like than someone you don’t like?
When times get tough, your first priority should be to ensure that your cur­
rent customer relationships are solid. Drop in for a visit, schedule a lunch, 
send an e-mail message, send some flowers, do whatever you can to keep 
your relationship on the front burner. And while you’re busy keeping your 
relationship active, let your customers know that you’re actively seeking 
more work. This gentle reminder that you’re out there often leads customers 
to send more work your way — exactly what you need when times are tough!
Push Your Clients to Pay Their Bills
On the long list of things that home-based businesspeople enjoy least about 
their jobs is having to call clients to encourage them to pay their bills. But no 
matter how great your customers are, there are going to be times when you 
have to do just that.
So how do you know when payments due to your business are running 
behind? You can find out by monitoring receivables — the money owed to 
your company by your clients and customers. QuickBooks and other busi­
ness accounting programs have built-in receivables aging reports that make 
the task easy by showing you who owes you money, how much they owe, 
when it’s due to be paid, and how late the payment is if you haven’t yet 
received it. And when you discover that one of your client’s payments is 
overdue, act immediately — especially when the amount owed is substantial.
	
Here are some tried-and-true ways for collecting your money:
	
✓	Call or visit your customer, and ask for payment. The direct approach 
is often the best when it comes to getting customers to pay overdue 
invoices. Don’t simply rubber-stamp a copy of the invoice with a note 
that says “We value your business — we hope you’ll pay soon” or 
“Second notice — we would really like to be paid now.” Chances are 
these halfhearted efforts will be ignored. It’s much harder to ignore you 
if you make a personal appeal for payment.
	
✓	Offer to help. More times than most companies like to admit, a pay­
ment gets held up because the accounting department loses an invoice, 
doesn’t have proof of delivery, or can’t find the purchase order that 

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
authorized the item in the first place. Find out what’s holding up payment, 
and offer to assist in getting what the customer needs.
	
✓	As a last resort — and only if you aren’t concerned about getting any 
future business from your client — turn the matter over to a collections 
agency. If your client is taking no action to pay you and is ignoring 
your phone calls, take action quickly. Sometimes all the client needs is 
a gentle nudge by a good agency to free up your payment right away. 
When Paul and Sarah received a bad check for a speaking engagement 
years ago, they made numerous calls to try to get paid — even contact­
ing a U.S. senator for help — to no avail. Today they still regret not turn­
ing the client over to a collections agency to begin with.
	
Whatever you do, when a payment is late, get on it immediately — don’t 
wait for days or weeks (or months!), hoping it’ll come in. Keeping the money 
coming in on time should be one of your key concerns, and this task needs 
your immediate attention. Check out Chapter 6 for more details.
Minimize Expenses
When times are tough, you essentially have two ways to hunker down: 
increase the amount of money that comes into your business or decrease the 
amount of money that goes out (or both). Minimizing expenses is one of the 
quickest ways to help weather the storm, and you need to act immediately 
when you go into survival mode.
Before you buy anything, ask yourself whether you can survive without it for 
a while. Can the expense be deferred for a few days, a few weeks, or even a 
few months? Can you borrow or rent equipment instead of purchasing it? Can 
you barter your services or products in exchange for the products and ser­
vices of other businesses?
	
Be careful, however, about exactly what expenses you cut. Do not cut expenses 
that will bring significantly more money into your business; instead, you may 
actually need to increase them.
Offer a Special Promotion
By far the best way to turn things around when times are tough financially is 
to bring in more business. Cutting expenses certainly helps, but it isn’t the 
best long-term solution. The best long-term solution is selling more of your 
products and services.

 Chapter 18: Ten Things to Do When Times Are Tough
	
To quickly generate more business, offer your customers a special offer on 
your products or services — perhaps 10 percent off all orders during July or a 
two-for-the-price-of-one offer. The exact form of your promotion varies, 
depending on the nature of your business, but you should be clear to your 
customers that they need to act quickly to take advantage of the special offer.
Alternatively, offer your clients and customers a premium — a value-added 
product or service — for placing an order during a specific period of time. 
For example, every customer who places an order of at least $100 during 
February receives a gift certificate for $10 worth of merchandise or a free 
video. You can also offer a special price to customers who are willing to 
commit to a contract. Be creative!
Subcontract for Others
Many home-based businesses — especially those with only one employee 
(you!) — are subject to extreme swings in business. One month, the business 
may be overwhelmed with orders; the next month, the phone may never ring.
	
To help offset these extreme business swings, you should develop a network 
of business contacts — perhaps other home-based businesses — to subcon­
tract your work to in times of feast and to subcontract work from in times of 
famine. Sure, it may sound a bit strange to turn work over to a competitor, but 
it actually makes good business sense. The key is for you to remain the pri­
mary contact with the client and to ensure that the work from the contractor 
is of the same high quality that you would insist on if you did it yourself.
Volunteer
Every business has times when business is down. Down times are perfect for 
developing new contacts who may eventually turn into customers or who 
may refer you to future customers. If you still have time left after servicing 
your current customers, you may consider doing volunteer work in your 
community as a way to meet new people.
	
Not only can volunteering be a terrific way to put your skills to work for your 
community, but it’s also a good way to increase your network of potential 
clients. And as that network expands, so will your future business. Believe us, 
you never know whom you’ll meet when you volunteer in your community.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
That woman next to you doing volunteer work at a children’s hospital may 
be the president of a local bank or the purchasing manager of a large 
manufacturer.
Moonlight
When starting your business, it’s a good idea to keep your day job — at least 
until your home-based business is generating enough income to allow you to 
pay all your bills. But even after your business is established, you may find that 
moonlighting — in the form of a part-time job — offers a number of benefits, 
including the following:
	
✓	Creating a steady source of income that you can rely on, independent of 
the ups and downs of your home-based business’s income
	
✓	Providing a range of benefits that your own business doesn’t, including 
health and dental insurance, life insurance, 401(k), stock options, and more
	
✓	Being a potential source of work for your home-based business
	
If you do decide to moonlight, make sure you’re not taking too much time 
away from your own business — time that you could devote to building higher 
levels of sales or expanding your business.
Refuse to Give Up!
When times are tough, you may be tempted to throw in the towel and give up. 
But what’s much more challenging — and ultimately much more rewarding — 
is to fight for your business and refuse to give up, no matter what. When inter­
viewed and surveyed, successful entrepreneurs most consistently attribute 
their good fortune to persistence.
You can fail only if you allow yourself to do so. By not considering giving up 
an option, you force yourself to focus on doing the things that help pull you 
through your tough times — things like the other nine items in this chapter.
