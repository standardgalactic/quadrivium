Preface
We are experiencing the dawn of what is called the digital age. The Internet and 
digital technologies are transforming our world. Wireless communication systems 
constitute a basic component of the current and the future information society. The 
fifth generation of communication systems, or 5G, will be, in the years to come, the 
most critical building block of what is referred to as a digital society. It is expected 
that 5G will be a truly converged network environment, because not only mobile 
communications systems but also other wireless systems and wired networks will 
coexist and use the same infrastructure. 
The vision ahead is that 5G will provide virtually ubiquitous, ultra- fastbroadband, 
connectivity not only to millions of individual users but also to  billions of connected 
objects. Therefore, 5G systems should have the capabilities to (a) serve the data-
hungry devices, for example, smartphones and tablets, providing rates of Gbps; 
(b) enable machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, for example, vehicle-to- 
vehicle (V2V) networks; (c) allow for interconnectivity of massive devices, for example, 
sensors and e-health equipment; and (d) support a wide range of applications and 
sectors. All these expectations set a wide variety of technical requirements for the 
design of 5G systems, including higher peak and user data rates, extremely low 
latency and response times, enhanced indoor and outdoor coverage, significantly 
increased number of devices, reaching the astronomical number of 100 billion, 
seamless mobility, security and privacy, increased battery lifetime, and improved 
quality of service (QoS) while maintaining low operational costs.
All the predictions available in the literature lead to the conclusion that beyond 
2020, wireless communication systems will be able to support more than 1000 
times the traffic volume served today by the current telecommunication systems. 
This extremely high traffic load is one of the major issues faced by the 5G design-
ers, manufacturers, and researchers, alike. It appears that this challenge will be 
addressed by a combination of parallel techniques that will use more spectrum 
more flexibly, realize higher spectral efficiency, and densify cells. Therefore, novel 
techniques and paradigms should be developed to support such challenges.
In this context, this book addresses diverse key-point issues of the next- 
generation wireless communication systems and attempts to identify promising 
solutions. The core of the book deals with the techniques and methods belonging 

viii ◾ Preface
to what is generally referred to as radio access network. The increased needs and the 
users’ expectations from the next-generation systems have been based for long on 
enabling technologies provided by the physical layer. These technologies are mainly 
developed to combat signal degradations imposed by the wireless channel and to 
support increased user data rates and improved QoS.
Chapter 1  presents an overview of the wave propagation and modelling of radio 
channels with characteristics that vary in time and space. Then, the influence of 
multipath propagation on the signal-distorting characteristics of wireless channels 
and the resulting effects on digital communications are outlined. Both narrowband 
and wideband channel modeling is discussed with suggestions for assessing whether 
a wide-sense stationary (WSS) model is appropriate and for modeling channel pro-
cesses with nonstationary characteristics and correlated scattering. Spatial channel 
characterization and MIMO channel models are reviewed and the measurement 
equipment and techniques are presented. Moreover, in Chapter 2, various channel 
models are compared, modeling techniques involved (stochastic, ray-tracing, etc.) 
are analyzed, and the applications of the involved theory in optimizing the cell 
planning procedures are demonstrated.
The millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) band has been foreseen for the development 
of 5G networks. A large amount of spectral space, from 28 to 95 GHz, is available 
to establish such systems providing increased data rates. Hence, the design issues 
of such networks necessitate the thorough knowledge of mm-Wave propagation 
characteristics. In Chapter 3, the state-of-the art channel models, derived from 
the latest measurement campaigns in various propagation scenarios (indoor, out-
door, etc.) are presented. In addition, models that describe the spatial–temporal 
variations of the mm-Wave channel are explained. Recent advances of MIMO 
and massive MIMO technology exploitation in mm-Wave propagation are also 
examined.
Chapter 4 presents the fundamental concepts and basic theoretical tools for 
the qualitative analysis of fading channels. This section helps the reader to under-
stand the nature and types of fading, the basic characteristics of a wireless channel, 
and the impact of fading on signal transmission. Fading mitigation techniques are 
presented, and a complete classification of the existing transmit/receive diversity 
techniques that exploit the spatial, frequency, time, and the polarization domains, 
is also provided.
OFDM modulation and OFDM-based transmission schemes (e.g., OFDMA) 
have dominated the current modern wireless standards. However, despite OFDM’s 
implementation simplicity, some key weaknesses such as the need for extended 
guard bands leading to reduced spectral efficiency, the increased peak-to-average 
power ratio, and its inherent sensitivity to frequency offset impairments have moti-
vated in the research of alternative multicarrier or single-carrier modulation tech-
niques based on filter banks. Therefore, Chapter 5 reviews the most important 
modulation and multicarrier schemes, including OFDM that have become strong 
candidates for the future generations of wireless standards.

Preface ◾ ix
The 5G radio access will be built on both new radio access technologies (RATs) 
and the evolved existing wireless technologies (LTE, HSPA, GSM, and WiFi). 
Chapter 6 provides an overview of radio network planning techniques from 2G 
to 4G. Then it describes the energy-efficient green radio network planning concept 
for heterogeneous 4G wireless networks and presents a cellular layout adaptation 
method.
The incorporation of MIMO transmission in the modern wireless standards has 
provided a significant improvement in the achieved spectral efficiency and system 
capacity. As technology moves toward 5G, the concept of MIMO has been evolved 
with the definition of complex centralized schemes, such as massive MIMO, or 
decentralized schemes, that is, network MIMO and coordinated multipoint trans-
mission. Moreover, alternative advanced MIMO schemes reducing the number of 
required RF chains, enabling full duplex communications, and allowing the use 
of compact antennas have been considered. Chapter 7 reviews the most important 
trends and challenges in MIMO transmission with emphasis on their application 
to 5G systems.
Alternative enabling technologies are also presented. As an example, Chapter 8 
introduces the load-controlled parasitic antenna arrays (LC-PAA) that resemble 
the operation of conventional antenna arrays with many elements, thus boosting 
the performance of multiantenna wireless communication systems, whereas at the 
same time providing cost and energy consumption savings and size reduction. 
Therefore, a novel method is presented that enables one to perform arbitrary chan-
nel-dependent precoding with LC-PAAs. The possible application of this technique 
in point-to-point MIMO, multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO), coordinated MIMO, 
and massive MIMO setups is investigated. The design and implementation of 
various types of LC-PAAs for these frequency bands are also shown.
Spatial modulation (SM) has been recently proposed as a promising transmis-
sion concept that reduces the complexity and the cost of multiple-antenna schemes. 
At the same time, it guarantees high data rates, improved system performance, 
and energy efficiency. Working principles of SM are presented in Chapter 9 and 
the advantages and disadvantages of SM-MIMO as compared to the state-of-the-
art MIMO communications are also discussed. Various transmission techniques 
for SM-MIMO, namely space shift keying (SSK), generalized space shift keying 
(GSSK) and generalized spatial modulation (GSM) are also further discussed. An 
analytical framework for the performance evaluation of SM-MIMO over fading 
channels in terms of the average bit error probability (ABEP) is also presented. 
Some MIMO transmission schemes closely related to the SM-MIMO paradigm, 
that is, single RF MIMO schemes, the incremental MIMO, and the antenna subset 
modulation (ASM) schemes, are briefly discussed. Moreover, several applications 
of SM-MIMO for future 5G wireless communications are presented, including 
MIMO implementations that exploit the massive MIMO paradigm as well as the 
combination of both orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and 
single carrier with SM-MIMO.

x ◾ Preface
Device-to-device (D2D) communication is recognized as one of the technol-
ogy components of the evolving 5G architecture. The reuse of cellular resources 
by D2D links that are located randomly inside a macro-cell imposes a cochannel 
interference to the base station (BS), cellular users and to other D2D receivers. 
Several aspects of D2D communications are investigated in Chapter 10, such as 
interference statistics of interferers scattered according to a homogeneous Poisson 
point process, D2D neighbor discovery based on signal-to-interference-and-noise 
ratio association metric, D2D link performance in the presence of interference and 
power control imposed by the BS, and the impact of mobility on the D2D link 
performance. In addition, a V2V use case is considered and the performance of a 
multiuser cooperative V2V communication system is studied.
Next, Chapter 11 addresses the virtualization of wireless access in order to 
provide the required capacity to a set of virtual base stations (VBSs) with diverse 
requirements, instantiated in a given geographical area. A network architecture is 
presented, based on a generic network virtualization environment, in which both 
physical and virtual perspectives are considered and the main stakeholders are 
taken into account. A new tier of radio resource management (RRM) is proposed 
for inter-VNets (virtual networks) RRM aiming at transposing the cooperative set 
of functionalities to the virtualization environment.
Cooperative techniques have significantly contributed toward improv-
ing the capacity of the 4G networks and are considered as a basic element 
of the imminent 5G networks. This topic is addressed in Chapter 12 of this 
book. Among cooperative techniques, cooperative relaying (CR) has received 
 significant attention from researchers due to the gains that it offers to the 
network. The techniques that have received a large amount of contributions 
are the opportunistic relay selection (ORS) and successive relaying (SuR) and 
 several policies, such as successive opportunistic relaying (SOR) with full 
duplex (FD) operation and SOR for networks with buffer-aided (BA) relays that 
offer additional degrees of freedom in inter-relay interference (IRI) mitigation. In 
addition, an overview of interference mitigation techniques designed for relay 
networks is provided.
Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been proposed as a promising solution 
to cope with the spectral scarcity, and this is the main topic of Chapter 13. In 
addition, as the technology of CRN can help to unlock the full potential of 5G 
wireless systems, the 5G key enablers are described and finally the role of CRN 
in 5G networks is also highlighted. Furthermore, several formulations of different 
CRN’s resource allocation problems are presented based on various mathematical 
approaches such as optimization techniques, game theory, matching theory, multi-
criteria decision-making theory, and machine learning. The basic concepts of each 
approach are described and an extensive list of scientific works is also presented. 
Finally, various future research avenues for the application of cognitive systems to 
5G and the investigation of novel flexible algorithms in radio resource management 
are also discussed.

Preface ◾ xi
The last chapter (Chapter 14) focuses on transformational wireless  technologies 
for health care, discussing their potential and the challenges that rose. As it is 
well known, the significant advances in wireless communications, sensing tech-
nologies, and sensor data analytics are opening new opportunities in medicine, 
and are promising to address the unsustainability of current health care provision 
models. Notably, health care challenges, including rising health care costs, aging 
 populations, and emerging disease threats rank among the most serious concerns in 
the world. Wireless technology can empower both patients and medical  providers 
by providing round-the-clock health status information. Examples include  wireless 
on-body (wearable, epidermal) and in-body (implantable, ingestible)  medical 
devices that may be used as sensors, actuators, and/or drug delivery devices. 
Remote  diagnosis, vital parameter control, elderly monitoring, and chronic disease 
management are just some of the examples of applications of wireless technologies. 
Exploitation of wireless technologies and sensor data analytics in health care can 
lead to healthier citizens, reduced hospital stays, and lower costs. 
This book is dedicated to Philip Constantinou, an inspiring professor, a valuable 
colleague, and a loyal friend. He was an exceptional professor who was always there for 
students, who could understand your thoughts and concerns, who was the inspiration, 
and who gave confidence to the team. A testimony to this was the overwhelming response 
we received from many colleagues who wanted to contribute to this book because they 
wanted to join us in celebrating his research and educational achievements in the 
general field of wireless communications for the past 25 years.
Philip was a kind human being, a generous and a welcoming person open to the 
community, showing great concern and affection for people with special needs. Before 
joining the National Technical University of Athens,  Athens, Greece, he and his fam-
ily have lived for many years in Canada, where he was granted the Master of Applied 
Science by University of Ottawa and started his great telecom career in Telesat in 
Ottawa, Canada. Then he worked for several years for the Government of Canada in 
the Department of Communications, while at the same time pursuing his PhD degree 
at the Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada. Being an international man, he believed 
in openness, valued collaboration, and always tried to impart the importance of com-
municating engineering novelty to his students. He was always supportive to the junior 
communications engineers’ ideas and encouraged them to act on their own initiative 
following their dream. Philip was a workaholic lab enthusiast who loved to deliver 
working systems. Although he was a zealous and motivated leader, he had a methodic 
approach regularly reminding to his colleagues two of his favorite phrases: “One step at 
a time” and “I am always a practical man.” His students and his colleagues, alike, owe 
him a great debt of gratitude for making us feel special, strong, and capable of doing 
things.

1.1 Introduction
Any communications link can be modeled as shown in Figure 1.1, the model hav-
ing three major components: (1) the source, usually referred to as the transmitter; 
(2) the transmission channel; and (3) the sink, usually referred to as the receiver, or 
the destination of the transmitted signals.
After final design and implementation of the transmitter, receiver, and anten-
nas (if the communication signals are to be carried via radiowave propagation), any 
distortion of the transmitted waveform, s t( ), on its path from the transmitter to the 
receiver comes from either noise or the physical characteristics of the radio chan-
nel. These characteristics can primarily be categorized as transmission loss, the 
dispersion (or spreading) of the transmitted signal in time as a result of propagation 
delays, its dispersion in frequency as a result of Doppler effects, or its dispersion in 
three-dimensional space. On a static or nonvarying radio channel, which exists any 
time neither the communications link antennas nor anything in the environment 
of operation is moving and the physical characteristics of the environment are not 
changing, such distortion can be corrected using fixed technology, including hard-
ware or software. However, when the transmission characteristics of a radio channel 
are randomly varying because changes in the environment are random, the correc-
tion of distortion becomes challenging. Models, and knowledge of the parameters

thereof, for the random variations are thus needed to assess whether the correction 
of distortion is needed to achieve the desired quality of service on the communica-
tion link, and if so, to determine design criteria for  distortion  correcting hardware 
and software, and for use in simulation models to test its effectiveness. This chapter 
focuses on the modeling of randomly varying radio channels, the  estimation of 
model parameters from radio propagation measurements, and the characteriza-
tion of measured channels based upon model parameters, which is the first step in 
assessing the requirement for distortion correcting technology.
Following this introduction, this chapter has three main sections. Section 1.2 
begins with a discussion of the most fundamental impairment to wireless 
 transmission: transmission loss in an environment where there are no reflectors, 
scatterers, or obstructions. Then, the subject of multipath propagation when there 
are objects in the environment of operation that can reflect, scatter, and obstruct 
radiowaves is introduced and the review of a method for modeling transmission 
loss in a multipath environment based on radio propagation measurements is 
 discussed. Next, in Section 1.3, the influence of multipath propagation on the 
signal-distorting characteristics of wireless channels and resulting effects on digital 
communications are outlined. This is accompanied by a review and discussion of 
a classical model, applicable to the analysis of single-input-single-output systems, 
for modeling randomly varying channels as a Gaussian wide-sense- stationary 
 process. It is followed by the general assessment of channel quality, with particu-
lar emphasis on methods by which measured channels can be classified in accor-
dance with the subject model and by which model parameters can be estimated 
from measured data for use in channel modeling and simulation. Section 1.3.6 
 summarizes an extension from the  literature of the classical model to make it 
applicable for  multiple-input multiple-output systems, which are envisaged as a 
key to the success of 5G systems in meeting anticipated transmission capacity 
requirements.
Section 1.4 focuses on the data qualification preprocessing of measured data 
that is necessary for the reduction of errors in analyzing such data for the estima-
tion of model parameters. First, a very general overview of radio channel sounding 
is given. A method from the literature for the reduction of noise from wideband 
channel measurements is then reviewed. A discussion follows on the assessment of 
measured data to determine if modeling of random variations in the time domain 
using a wide-sense-stationary model is appropriate. Section 1.4.3 is a review of 
modeling cumulative probability distributions based on estimates thereof from 
measured data. Then, the estimation of spaced-frequency correlation functions for 
randomly time varying channels is outlined, with emphasis on how results can be 
used to verify conditions required for modeling variations in the frequency domain 
as a wide-sense-stationary process. Section 1.4.5 is a very short note on consider-
ations regarding the assessment of whether a Gaussian model is appropriate and 
whether assumptions of ergodicity are reasonable.

1.2 Transmission Loss
What is referred to as free-space transmission occurs anytime radiowaves travel 
between a radiating source and a receiving antenna without interacting with any-
thing, such as physical obstructions, particles, or electric charges (e.g., in an ion-
ospheric plasma). If one considers the transmission of radio waves from a point 
source, or isotropic antenna, which is a fictitious construct that cannot be realized 
in the real world, radiation occurs equally in all direction and the radiated waves 
spread out in spheres of ever-increasing radius, r, with the isotropic antenna at their 
center. Since the area of the surface of a sphere is given by 
 
A
r
s = 4
2
π  
(1.1)
the power loss (most frequently referred to as propagation loss), at any frequency, as 
a result of the propagation of radiowaves in free space is inversely proportional to r 2. 
A practical transmit (Tx) antenna focuses energy in specific directions such that the 
ratio of power density it radiates in any direction, θ, to that which would be radiated 
by an isotropic antenna, is given by its directive gain (often referred to as gain), Gt( )
θ . 
Similarly, the ratio of power received by a receive (Rx) antenna from any direction, 
θ, to the power that would be received by an isotropic antenna, is given by its gain, 
Gr( )
θ . Associated with a receive antenna is an effective area, Ae, which can be thought 
of as a capture area, over which power incident upon it can be received. This effective 
area [1] is related to the gain of the antenna in accordance with the equation

Note that because the effective area of the Rx antenna is dependent upon wave-
length, λ, free-space transmission loss has a direct-quadratic dependence upon λ, and 
hence, an inverse-quadratic dependence upon the frequency of operation, f. The 
fact that the frequency dependence of transmission loss is an antenna property 
rather than a property of the propagation environment is often overlooked. If 
Equation 1.5 were used to calculate the ratio of transmission loss at two differ-
ent frequencies f1 and f 2 over a free space radio link having equal gain antennas 
at the two frequencies, it is clear that this ratio would be given by ∆=

Figure 1.2 is a plot of this ratio for the case of f1

= GHz, which is a ratio of interest 
to many in the consideration of the design of 5G systems, which are proposed for 
operation above 6 GHz.
The quadratic relationship, resulting in a decreasing slope of the ratio of trans-
mission loss with respect to that at 2 GHz as frequency increases, is worth noting.
1.2.1 Multipath Propagation
In many instances free-space transmission is impossible. This is a result of the fact 
that as the radiated waves spread out in spheres of ever-increasing radius, they 
impinge upon obstacles, or encounter particles or, as in the ionosphere, regions 
where there are concentrated charge densities. In the troposphere, the interaction 
of radiowaves with obstacles causes reflection, diffraction, and scattering. These 
phenomena, in turn, generate secondary waves that can interfere with waves that 
arrive at a Rx antenna directly from the Tx antenna. Such interference is referred to

a radio communication link, depending upon the overall link design.

and ρi is a complex coefficient resulting from the interaction of the “ith” multipath 
wave with some obstacle or surface before it is reflected, diffracted, or scattered 
toward the Rx antenna. If radio path “i” is the direct path between the Tx and 
Rx antennas, ρi =1. The vector sum of the multipath waves can either enhance or 
diminish received power, depending on the phases of the interfering waves at any 
specific receive location. This, in turn, can modify the dependence of transmission 
loss on distance, r, of what must now be referred to as average transmission loss, 
from the inverse quadratic dependence appropriate for free space, and increases the 
exponent to which r is raised, or decreases it, depending upon the circumstance. 
In a reverberation chamber, for example, where all waves that impinge upon the 
chamber walls are reflected with a reflection coefficient near unity, this exponent is 
reduced, resulting in lower average transmission loss than that which would occur 
in free space. This is because energy is prevented from leaving the chamber by its 
walls. On a radio path between two antennas where there is one reflection point 
and the angle between the direction of travel of the impinging wave and the reflect-
ing surface is small, the reflection coefficient is near unity, and if the electric field 
is perpendicular to the plane containing the direction (or Poynting) vectors of both 
the incident and reflected waves, there is a phase shift of π  radians on reflection. In 
this case, received power can diminish in proportion to r 4 in accordance with the 
well-known two-ray model [2] at Tx–Rx ranges beyond a breakpoint, after which 
the direct and reflected waves begin to have an inverse phase relationship and their 
vector addition is therefore destructive. This distance is a function of the offset of 
the antennas from the reflecting surface (i.e., antenna heights if the surface is the 
earth) and the wavelength at the frequency of operation.
Multipath propagation and its effects can be exemplified by considering the 
simple case, at a frequency of 2.35 GHz, of equal-height antennas in a small empty 
room of dimensions 5 m long × 3.6 m wide × 4 m high, where the direct wave 
from the Tx antenna, as well as reflections from the four walls, the floor, and the 
ceiling are received. A simple simulation using Equation 1.6 and assuming verti-
cal quarter-wavelength monopoles with radiation patterns as in [1] at the Tx and 
Rx yields a received power pattern along the centerline of the room as shown in 
Figure 1.3. For this simulation, the transmit power, Pt, was set equal to −7 dBm, 
transmission line losses were equal to 2.2 dB, the walls were modeled as being 

Propagation Measurement-Based Wireless Channel ◾ 7
constructed of plasterboard on a wooden support structure, and the floor and ceil-
ing were  modeled as being made of dry concrete. Equations for the reflection coeffi-
cients and the material constants were taken from [2]. Results for the case in which 
the walls and floor are perfectly conducting are also shown in Figure 1.3.
The undulations of the multipath sums as the constituent waves add with differ-
ent phase relationships as a function of the distance between the Tx and the Rx can 
clearly be seen. It can also be seen that the average power of the multipath sum for 
the case of perfectly reflective surfaces decreases less rapidly than the curve given 
by Friis equation, leading to a model transmission loss is proportional to r raised to 
an exponent that is less than 2.
1.2.2  Modeling of Transmission Loss 
in a Multipath Environment
The modeling of transmission loss is something that has received much attention by 
many. This is an important part of communication system design, since the capac-
ity of any radio link is directly related to the ratio of received signal power to noise 
power, or the SNR, at the receiver.
The modeling of Pr as a function of Tx–Rx separation, say, from simulations 
such as above, or from propagation measurements, is best done by expressing Pr

in terms of the logarithm of distance. When plotted, this relationship is a straight 
line  and is easy to model. However, transmission loss, the ratio of Pr-to-Pt is 
 modeled more often than Pr. In a multipath environment, by convention, before 
such modeling, averaging is conducted to eliminate transmission loss variations 
that result from the vector addition of multipath waves. This averaging can be 
conducted over small ranges of time, space, or frequency, since the physics associ-
ated with the seemingly random variations that result from the vector addition 
are the same in all three domains. If the averaging is done in time, motion of 
either the antennas, or objects in the operating environment is needed to stir the 
component multipath waves (referred to as multipath components, or MPCs) to 
achieve a variation in time that covers as much as possible as the full dynamic 
range  commensurate with the multipath sum where the measurements are being 
made. If the averaging is over space, one of the link antennas must be moved in 
order to achieve the variations of interest. A wideband channel sounding signal [2] 
facilitates ease in averaging over frequency. The range over which averaging must 
be conducted is best determined by the observation of the absence of variations in 
averaged results.
Modeling of the log–log relationship between average transmission loss 
and Tx–Rx antenna separation (sometimes herein referred to as range) can be 
effected using a standard least-mean-squared (LMS) error approach. This can 
be  done by considering a system of multiple equations, each for the average 
 transmission loss at a different position along the trajectory of the Rx antenna. The 
modeling process begins by representing the logarithm of the Tx–Rx  separation 
(d) as

It should be noted that there are discussions within the research community 
concerning the specification of d ref in the procedure described in the foregoing. 
When the model is to be applied where Tx-to-Rx separations are in the range of 
Tx-to-Rx separations over which the propagation measurements upon which the 
model is based were made, it is acceptable to use the minimum value of Tx-to-Rx 
separation that was used during the measurements, and therefore Lref is the associ-
ated local average transmission loss, as estimated from the measurements. However, 
if in applying the model, extensions need to be made to the range of Tx-to-Rx sepa-
rations used during the measurements in either direction, inaccuracies can increase 
linearly with the amount of the extension. For this reason, it has been proposed 
that the model for average transmission loss should be forced to have a transmis-
sion loss equal to that of the free-space model at a Tx–Rx antenna separation of 
1 m, and equations for such modeling are given in [3]. It is argued that, whereas 
it does not matter if 1 m happens to be in near field of the Tx antenna since no 
actual measurements are involved, in most cases there is a low probability that 
there are obstructions between the Tx and Rx antennas at a separation of 1 m. 
Friis equation at a range of 1 m is therefore thought to provide a good physical 
basis for the model. Models from this approach have been tested against measured 

10 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
data at extended ranges and after frequency scaling, which is sometimes used to 
predict losses in a given environment at frequencies where no measurements in that 
environment have been reported. Robustness of the model with a 1 m free space 
intercept is reported to be good [4]. This anchoring of Lref, clearly, fixes the slope 
of the model, and another anchor that, for the same reasons, has been used by the 
author at a Tx–Rx separation of 1 wavelength most often produces a model with a 
different slope. Although the robustness to extensions of models resulting from the 
latter approach has not been tested, the benefit is that the reference transmission 
loss, Lref, for transmission between unity gain antennas, is 22.5 dB, regardless of 
operating frequency. Figure 1.4 shows the results of measurements at 2.35 GHz 
in a room of the same dimensions as those used in the simulations for Figure 1.3. 
Each of the measurements was derived from the average insertion loss recorded 
by a vector-network-analyzer-based measurement system every 2.5 MHz across a 
500 MHz bandwidth. The room was furnished as a study room, with three library-
type cubicles aligned along each side wall, with a walk space down the center of 
the room. The Tx antenna was a biconical at 1 m high, in a fixed location at one 
end of the room, on its centerline. The Rx antenna was a monopole at the same 
height. In Figure 1.4, unconstrained results from the described LMS error model-
ing procedure are labeled LFI, where the “FI” denotes a floating transmission loss 
intercept. The constrained models are labeled LFSI, where “FSI” denotes a free-space

intercept, and in each of these two cases, d ref is given. The ordinate in this figure is 
labeled LUGA, representing transmission loss between unity gain antennas, which 
the author has found to be a convenient concept for comparing transmission losses 
at different frequencies when measurement system antenna gains are different at 
different frequencies. This is in preference to the term propagation loss, as it does not 
imply the loss is a property of the transmission medium.
The reader should note that Figure 1.4 is merely an example of results from 
application of the methods described in the text. Nothing should be inferred 
regarding which model is best from a comparison of results in the single example 
shown in the figure, as this comparison varies for different propagation scenarios 
and operating environments.
In addition to modeling of the average transmission loss, variations with respect 
to the average, referred to as large area, long-term, or shadowing variations, by radio 
engineers, whether or not there are obstructions on the radio paths between the Tx 
and Rx,* are often modeled as having a log-normal probability distribution with a 
specified standard deviation. Such a model can be verified as appropriate, and its 
standard deviation specified by forming an estimated probability density function 
(EPDF), or an estimated cumulative probability function (ECDF), for variations in 
local average transmission loss with respect to a linear model derived as explained 
in the foregoing. This modeling cannot be done by searching, for example, for 
the LMS difference between the epdf, or the ECDF and a model of interest. The 
reason is explained in Section 1.4.3, along with a description of better procedures 
for the derivation of models for the pdfs and CDFs that characterize variations of 
the underlying random process from which measurements are sampled. Figure 1.5 
shows the results of such modeling, for transmission loss variations with respect to 
the floating intercept model, LFI.
1.3  Characterization of Multipath Radio Channels 
for Digital Communications
1.3.1 Introduction
In addition to modifying propagation loss parameters with respect to those appli-
cable to free space, multipath propagation also causes time dispersion on a radio 
channel, which can spread transmitted digital symbols in time, so that symbols 
arriving consecutively at a receiver overlap and cause intersymbol interference. This 
results in the vector sum of received multipath signals, rather than the desired 
* Both small area and large area variations in received power can result from multipath propaga-
tion, in the absence of obstructions on any of the radio paths between the Tx and the Rx, as 
for example, when there is a direct wave and a ground-reflected wave on a line-of-sight radio 
link [4,5].

12 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
symbol at sample times, and, when severe enough, causes symbol errors at a rate 
that cannot be reduced, regardless of SNR at the receiver. Resulting error rates are 
referred to as irreducible error rates, or error-rate floors.
The time dispersion discussed in the foregoing is caused by the fact that differ-
ent multipath waves generally arrive at a receiver at different times since the paths 
over which they travel at the speed of light generally have different lengths. Thus, if 
it were possible to transmit an impulse from the Tx antenna, a series of short attenu-
ated pulses would arrive at the Rx at different propagation delays, τ. For the real-
world small empty room example from Section 1.2.2, such an impulse response, 
h( )τ , for the propagation channel when the Tx and Rx antennas are separated by 
1 m can be plotted as in Figure 1.6.
Six power-scaled pulses are represented in Figure 1.6, whereas the direct wave 
and six reflections (from walls, floor, and ceiling) were simulated. This is because the 
reflections from the two-side walls have the same powers and propagation delays, 
so they are superimposed on each other and cannot be distinguished in the figure.
The impulse response in Figure 1.6 can be Fourier transformed to yield the 
frequency-domain transfer function, H f( ), for the radio channel. This function 
is plotted in Figure 1.7. Note the variations, from frequency-to-frequency, in the 
transfer function gain that result from variations in the vector sum of MPCs at 
different frequencies.

Given either the impulse response or the transfer function of any radio  channel, 
the output resulting from transmitting any waveform, s t( ), on the channel can be cal-
culated: the impulse response can be applied using convolution with the transmitted 
waveform in the time domain, and the transfer function, through multiplication 
with the transmitted waveform spectrum, S f( ), in the frequency domain. That is

While the overlapping of received digital symbols as a result of the multipath echoes 
in Figure 1.6 can be imagined, its dual in the frequency domain, plotted in Figure 1.7, 
can easily also be envisaged as resulting in distortion of the transmit signal spec-
trum. This distortion can be corrected using a fixed equalizer when there are no time 
variations on the channel. This mitigates multipath effects, resulting in an overall 
radio channel transfer function that has close to the same gain, and linear phase 
shift, as a function of frequency over the bandwidth of interest. When multipath

dispersion changes in time, however, equalization also becomes dynamic and more 
complex and costly. Engineers are therefore in need of measures by which the sever-
ity of changing multipath conditions can be assessed so means can be considered 
for the avoidance of a requirement for other than very simple dynamic equalizers.
1.3.2  Frequency Correlation Measures for Randomly 
Varying Multipath Channels
Assessment of the severity of multipath conditions on randomly varying channels 
can be effected by regarding time variations as a stochastic process, being random 
primarily as a result of the randomness with which reflecting, diffracting, and scat-
tering phenomena within an operating environment, as well as the transmit and 
receive antenna locations, change as time progresses. If one considers random time 
variations of H ( f  ), it is easy to envisage the fact that distortion of transmitted 
symbols is more severe, the narrower the bandwidth over which the correlation of 
such variations diminishes. When this co-called correlation bandwidth (
)
Bc  is large, 
there is greater probability that all frequencies in the transmit signal spectrum vary 
in unison, maintaining symbol shape in the time domain constant, varying only 
received power. A channel with this characteristic is referred to as frequency-flat 
fading channel [6]. When Bc is small, signal spreading occurs in the time domain.

Propagation Measurement-Based Wireless Channel ◾ 15
A time-varying channel with a narrow correlation bandwidth is referred to as 
 frequency-selective fading channel [7]. Care should be taken to note that this con-
cept is not useful on nonvarying, or static, radio channels. A static channel can be 
frequency selective, but frequency correlation is not a useful measure, as the selec-
tivity is fixed over time.
Turning now to a statistical characterization, through consideration of the cen-
tral limit theorem, and the fact that a sum of MPCs is often comprised of a large 
number of MPCs, transfer function variations are often modeled as being random 
and Gaussian [6]. The channel process (CP) can therefore be completely character-
ized by its mean and autocorrelation. The autocorrelation of variations of H( f ) can 
be written in complex baseband notation as

where the operation ( )*⋅ denotes complex conjugate. Now, if the time-varying equiv-
alent of H f( ) is denoted H t f
( ;
), and the CP is ergodic, the ensemble average can 
be replaced by a time average, and Equation 1.16 becomes

where the time domain wide-sense stationary (WSS) condition implied by consid-
ering only time shifts (∆ t) accompanies the ergodicity. Further, for the purpose of 
assessing distortion at the level of each symbol, it is clear that ∆ t must equal zero. 
Then, if the CP is also WSS in the frequency domain, RH is independent of the spe-
cific frequencies, f  and 
′
f , being only dependent upon their separation, Δf , and 
identical for all reference frequencies, allowing one to write

It should be noted in applying Equation 1.19 that the time average of H f( ) should not 
be subtracted to give what is sometimes referred to as a covariance estimate. The prob-
lem with doing this is that radio channels that would normally exhibit narrowband 
envelope variations that are Rician-like are automatically analyzed as if they exhibit 

16 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Rayleigh fading*, which is concomitant with much narrower correlation bandwidths. 
On Rician channels, correlation is maintained high across wider bandwidths by the 
steady component, or specular content, in the received signal, which, after phase syn-
chronization to replicate the operation of a receiver [8], results in a non-zero mean 
for H t f
( ;
). An automatic assumption that the CP is WSS in the frequency domain, 
which gives a symmetrical result for RH as a function of Δf , making it independent 
of f, should also be avoided. A better approach is to process measured data with the 
sampled equivalent of Equation 1.17, as discussed in Section 1.4.4; then, if the result 
is symmetrical, or nearly so, declare that the CP is WSS in the frequency domain, 
which allows the use of Equation 1.19, and implies uncorrelated scattering [6] in the 
time domain. This, in turn, simplifies delay-domain analyses, which is discussed in 
Section 1.3.3. Figure 1.8 shows results from the estimation of RH using Equation 1.77, 
which is the sampled equivalent of Equation 1.17, to analyze data measured on radio 
channels, for which Rayleigh and Rician cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) 
were found, via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) hypothesis test, to be good models for 
narrowband envelope fading. The KS test is discussed in Section 1.4.3.
The frequency offset of the time series plot is a result of not using the spectral 
line at midband as a reference to avoid d.c. offsets in the measurement system.
The curve in Figure 1.8a, labeled Time Series Result was estimated using 
Equation 1.77 to analyze a recorded time series of 800 channel transfer function esti-
mates (TFEs), with the correlation across a 100 MHz bandwidth with respect to the 
time series of complex values of the 800 TFEs at midband. The dashed curve is the result 
of Fourier transforming the channel’s average power-delay profile, which is discussed in 
Section 1.3.3. Two observations can be made. The first is that this frequency correlation 
function (FCF) estimate is almost symmetrical, indicating WSS characteristics in the 
frequency domain. The second is that the two curves in the figure match fairly closely. 
This is because the measured channel was a Rayleigh fading channel, and, as observed, 
its characteristics were WSS in the frequency domain. These two conditions are neces-
sary to make the Fourier Transform (FT) method valid. In Figure 1.8b, it can be seen 
that the time series FCF estimate from using Equation 1.78 is reasonably symmetrical, 
but the fact that the channel on which data for this estimate were measured exhibited 
Rician, rather than Rayleigh fading, makes the FT method invalid, so the two curves in 
the figure do not match. It can be seen that the FT result would grossly under-estimate 
BC according to any definition.† The FT approach, however, is often applied without 
checking to see if the Rayleigh fading condition is satisfied. This can lead to over-design 
of communication systems, since an interpretation would be that symbol rates need to 
be much lower than is actually necessary to minimize equalization requirements.
* See Section 1.3.6 for an explanation of Rayleigh and Rician fading.
† In fact, the time series result diminishes only because of decreased SNR at the band edges of 
the channel sounding system used to measure the data from which the FCFs were estimated. 
It is considered reasonable to assume that its magnitude would remain very high for extremely 
large bandwidths otherwise.

18 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
It was noted that the FCF estimates in Figure 1.8a report correlation with 
respect to temporal variations at the midband frequency. This is sufficient if the CP 
is WSS in the frequency domain. However, if this midband result were to be asym-
metrical, it would be necessary to estimate the frequency correlation with respect 
to references at every spectral position across the bandwidth of interest. This results 
in 3D FCFs, as shown in Figure 1.9, for the examples discussed in the foregoing.
Consider now an ideal frequency-flat fading channel. If such a channel had 
a bandwidth, B, then the volume (
)
VRH  defined by its 3D FCF would be equal to 
B2. It has been suggested in the literature, therefore [9], that when it is found that 
frequency-domain WSS characteristics cannot be assumed, the ratio, to Bm
2, of the 
volume of 3D FCFs estimated from measurements, where Bm is the measurement 
system bandwidth, could be used to assess channel selectivity in much the same 
way that RH is applied when frequency-domain WSS conditions prevail. Whereas 
Bc is often defined to be the bandwidth at which RH diminishes to 50%, or 1/e, 
it might also be considered to be the bandwidth at which V
B
R
m
H /
2 diminishes to 
50%, or 1/e. This would apply if the channel exhibits Rayleigh fading, but is not 
frequency-domain WSS. If, however, Rican fading is found to be a good model, it 
is suggested that if the ratio, K, of specular to random power is anything greater 
than about 0 dB, it is reasonable to assume that the correlation bandwidth is large 
enough that intersymbol interference is not of concern, provided B

sys, where 
Bsys is the bandwidth of the communication system being considered for operation 
on the measured channel.

statistical measure for variations of H t f

Since Equation 1.23 represents the average power on the channel at delay τ, it 
is widely known as the channel’s average power-delay profile, or its delay power 
spectrum [10], whether or not the condition of uncorrelated variations at different 
delays, referred to as uncorrelated scattering, prevails and permits its recognition as 
a true autocorrelation function estimate. If there is uncorrelated scattering, and, in 
addition, H t f

Equation 1.24 is the FT relationship discussed in association with the curve labeled 
FFT result in Figure 1.8. Recall that Figure 1.8b is a demonstration that the Rayleigh 
fading condition is crucial if Equation 1.24 is to hold, as is the uncorrelated scatter-
ing condition. Hence, when analyzing measured data, estimating the distributions 
of narrowband fading envelopes (see Section 1.4.3) and assessing the symmetry of 
a time series estimate of frequency correlation (see Section 1.4.4) before applying 
Equation 1.24 is considered to be prudent. In addition, throughout, the condition 
of conformance to a time-domain WSS model has been evoked. A discussion of 
this can be found in Section 1.4.2.
While plots of ˆ ( )
Rh τ  are interesting and often foretelling that problems with the 
reception of multipath echoes can be anticipated, it is desirable to be able to use 
a single value, like Bc, for characterizing the delay dispersion exhibited by a radio 
channel. For this, the power-weighted standard deviation of delay with respect to  the 
centroid of ˆ ( )
Rh τ  is used.
If the earliest received MPC has delay τ0, then in discrete form, in the  analysis of 
measured impulse response estimates, each with M samples in delay, the  centroid, 
or power-weighted average excess delay is given by

and is frequently referred to as the rms delay spread, or simply delay spread of the chan-
nel. As a result of the Fourier transform relationship in Equation 1.24, the relation-
ship Bc =1/στ, which has been studied in [12], is sometimes used for rule-of-thumb 
calculations. If intersymbol interference is to be avoided, TS must be significantly* 
greater [7,10] than στ, or B

, where TS is the duration and BS is the bandwidth of 
digital symbols transmitted over the channel. It should be noted that, because of the 
zero-mean transfer function and uncorrelated scattering conditions for the validity 
of Equation 1.24, reciprocal relationship between στ and Bc should only be applied 
when it is known that a channel exhibits uncorrelated scattering and Rayleigh fading.
Frequently στ, though formally defined for the characterization of fading chan-
nels, is applied to characterize static, or nonvarying channels, or channels that cannot 
be categorized as zero-mean Gaussian wide-sense-stationary uncorrelated-scattering 
(ZMGWSSUS) channels because one or several of the required conditions do not 
apply. In this case, it is sometimes useful to use a CDF estimated from measured data 
(herein referred to as an ECDF) to model static (sometimes referred to as instanta-
neous) rms delay spread (
)
στs  values estimated by applying Equation 1.23 in the anal-
ysis of measured data, but with N = 1 such that there is no averaging over time. Such 
an ECDF might be used, for example, to characterize changes in στs as a function of 
operating scenario, or Tx-to-Rx separation.
1.3.4  Characterization of Frequency Dispersion 
on Time-Varying Multipath Channels
The Doppler shift in frequency undergone by a signal received from, or by, a 
moving antenna or that is received via reflection from, or by, diffraction around 
a moving obstruction, is a function of the relative position, relative direction of 
motion, and relative speed of the moving antennas or obstructions and the wave-
length of the signal. For cases where multiple MPCs are received from different 
angles of arrival, each MPC could have been modified by a different frequency 
shift. Similarly, each of the spectral components in a wideband signal would also 
be modified by a different frequency shift. The result is that the spectrum occupied 
by the originally transmitted signal is broadened. If a sinusoid were transmitted in 
an environment where antennas and obstructions are moving for example, a signal 
with a bandwidth greater than zero would be received. The bandwidth of such 
* Often taken to be one tenth.

22 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
a frequency-spread signal is referred to as the Doppler spread of the channel over 
which the signal is received, and it can be characterized through the autocorrela-
tion function in Equation 1.17 in a manner similar to that in which delay spread is 
characterized. If a Fourier transform of Equation 1.17 with respect to ∆ t is taken,

. A channel with such characteristics is referred to as 
a doubly-flat [7,10], or just flat, fading* channel. A channel with characteristics 
outside these boundaries in either direction is referred to as an overspread fading 
channel, and this type of channel can be frequency flat and time selective, time flat 
and frequency selective, or doubly selective.
* Recall that these characteristics cannot be defined for non-time-varying channels, since, in the 
real world, where ensemble averages do not exist, correlation functions cannot be defined for 
non-time-varying channels. Note also that the adjective “fading” means there are time variations.

It characterizes the average power in the channel as a function of multipath delay 
and Doppler frequency. Note that because this function is independent of both 
time and frequency, there is a requirement for a channel to conform to WSS models 
in both time and frequency if it is to be estimated from measured data.
1.3.5 Characterization of Received Signal Envelope Variations
In addition to the characterization of time variations by the quantification of 
Doppler spread, there is often interest in determining the extent of time variations 
of the absolute value, or envelope of a received signal. As for the quantification of 
Doppler spread, a single frequency is analyzed. This is a worst case because depths 
of fading decrease in direct proportion to signal bandwidth [14]. Often the target is 
to determine whether an ECDF for envelope fading matches one of several fading 
models, to enable the reproduction of experimentally observed envelope variations 
during wireless system simulations.
The most frequently cited model for envelope variations is the Rayleigh fad-
ing model, which is based on consideration of the variations of the resultant (r) of 
the vector sum of n unit vectors of arbitrary phase and the same frequency, when 
n is large. While a previous author had shown that this resultant tends to a fixed 
value, n, Lord Rayleigh showed that r is random, even for very large n [15], and is 
described by the probability density function (PDF)

(1.33)
Lord Rayleigh also showed that the expectation of power (time-averaged ac power 
for an ergodic process) is n. The cited original work goes on to show that the pdf 

24 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
in Equation 1.32 is not altered even if the vectors in the sum have different ampli-
tudes, as long as there is a large number having each amplitude. It is common in 
modern literature [10] to see a derivation of the Rayleigh pdf based on the assump-
tion that, from central limit theorem considerations, for large n, the resultant of 
the sum of n waves can be decomposed into the sum of two orthogonal Gaussian 
processes, with mean zero, and standard deviation σ. In this case, the expectation 
of power is 2
2
σ  and Equations 1.32 and 1.33 are modified through the replacement 
of n by 2
2
σ . Lin [16] showed, however, that if a received signal envelope follows a 
Rayleigh pdf, it does not necessarily mean that there are a large number of waves, 
or that the Gaussian decomposition is accurate. The Gaussian–Rayleigh relation-
ship is unique, however, under the conditions that the amplitude and phase of 
each component wave are statistically independent, and the phase of each wave is 
randomly and uniformly distributed on [0, 2π].
If a received signal reaches the receiver over direct line of sight or via specu-
lar reflection, the Rayleigh distribution discussed in the foregoing may not be 
appropriate. If there is a steady, or coherent, component and a large number of 
randomly varying MPCs, the situation is analogous to that of a sine wave in 
Gaussian noise. Writing in terms of noise currents, Rice [17,18] represented this 
signal combination as

Often in channel characterization and modeling work, k must be estimated from 
the measurements. There are several ways in which this can be done. When only 
received power, or envelope data are available, the method in [19] gives good 
results. However, this method can sometimes yield complex values as esti-
mates for k when the underlying process is not Rician, or when the estimates of 

Propagation Measurement-Based Wireless Channel ◾ 25
statistical moments are poor. When complex, rather than just power or received 
signal envelope data are available, the method in [20] can be used. Whichever 
method is used, results should be verified using hypothesis tests, as discussed in 
Section 1.4.3.
As the derivation for the Rician envelope pdf is based upon an assumption of 
quadrature Gaussian signal components and, as reported in a previous paragraph, 
the Rayleigh pdf can result from such a signal composition, derivations for both 
pdfs can be found in modern literature [10] that start from the assumption that 
the signal of interest is composed of the sum of quadrature Gaussian components. 
From such derivations, it is easy to identify that the Rician pdf becomes identical 
to the Rayleigh pdf when k →0. It is also easy to realize that if the envelope of 
a received signal were reported to vary in accordance with either a Rayleigh or a 
Rician distribution, such an envelope could be simulated as r

2, where 
in the Rayleigh case, x and y are independent Gaussian random variables with 
standard deviation, σ, and zero mean value, and in the Rician case, x and y are 
independent Gaussian random variables with standard deviation σ, and mean val-
ues, S cosθ and S sinθ, respectively, where θ is any real number.
1.3.6  Characterization of Direction Dispersion 
on Multipath Radio Channels
With the advent of increased interest in smart antenna and multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) systems, methods and measures for the quantification of direction 
dispersion became very important. Direction dispersion is quantified through mea-
sures of the statistical properties of random variations of directions from which MPCs 
arrive at a receive antenna (directions of arrival [DOAs]), and the directions in which 
the same MPCs departed (directions of departure [DODs]) from the Tx antenna. 
Knowledge of these directions and their statistical moments is important since they 
influence the correlation characteristics of the random variations of the complex 
physical link transfer functions between Tx and Rx antenna pairs, which are critical in 
determining the capacity of a MIMO system. To understand this, consider the equa-
tion for the mutual information, or capacity (C) on a MIMO communication link 
[21] with multielement antenna arrays at both the Tx and the Rx, when knowledge 
of the channel transfer function, G, is known only at the Rx, through its estimation, 
for example, by the processing of a training sequence. This capacity is given by

where Hi,j is the normalized frequency-domain transfer function of the physical 
link between the ith Rx antenna element and the jth Tx antenna element. Further 
note that G f( ) , the frequency domain channel transfer function before normaliza-
tion, is assumed to represent a narrowband channel, such that it has equal gain 
across its bandwidth (i.e., G f
G

), and it is slowly time-varying such that it 
is assumed to be nonvarying for the duration of at least one digital transmission 
frame. The normalization to derive H from G is given by P G

, where 
P is the total radiated power regardless of the number of Tx antennas and P is 
the average power at the output of each Rx antenna. It can be shown [21] that, for 
the case of a frequency-selective channel, assumed to be composed of N contiguous 
sub-bands of constant gain, the total capacity is the sum of the capacities for the 
N frequency-flat sub-bands, regardless of the transmission scheme (e.g., OFDM, 
CDMA, TDMA).
If in such a system, the jth antenna element at the Tx transmits a narrowband 
complex baseband signal, u t( ), the complex baseband signal received over the physi-
cal link between the jth Tx antenna element and the ith Rx antenna element can 
be written as

It is thus clear that the complex voltages on the antenna elements of the Tx and Rx 
arrays are dependent upon the DODs and DOAs of the MPCs. It is also clear that 
DODs and DOAs have significant influence on the correlation matrix, RH = HH *, 
which, in turn, can be seen from Equation 1.37 to be critical in the determination 
of C. In fact, it can be shown [24–26] that the magnitude of RH is inversely propor-
tional to angular dispersion, or the spread in DOAs and DODs. Angular dispersion 
is therefore measured and modeled often during radio propagation and channel 
modeling research, since it is a significant factor in the estimation of C.
The modeling of directional characteristics on time-varying ZMGWSSUS 
channels can begin [27] with a straight-forward extension of the expression for 
such a channel’s time-varying impulse response,

Just as for the relationship between h t;τ

(

be derived by Fourier transforms with respect to t, τ, and θrx. While the FT rela-
tionships involving the first two are well known, it is interesting to consider a FT 
with respect to θrx. Following [27], this can be realized by consideration of antenna 
theory [1], where it is known that in the far field, the E field can be related to the 
aperture distribution by the equation:

Thus, for a WSSUS channel, a FT of Equation 1.43 with respect to the angle θrx 
leads to function in a domain that can be reasonably referred to as the aperture 
domain, which is a finite segment from the spatial domain. Then, after consider-
ation of the linearity of the FT, it can be understood that MPCs that arrive with 
different angles of arrival will superimpose by vector addition, leading to fluctua-
tions in the spatial domain identical to multipath fading in the time domain or 
frequency selectivity in the frequency domain. In accordance, the relationships dis-
cussed earlier for nondirectional time-varying WSSUS channels can be reasonably 
extended in the case of directional channels. For a WSS channel, one can then 
recognize the existence of a correlation function given by

Continuing under the assumption of uncorrelated scattering and the independence 
of DODs and DOAs, one could write similar equations for σφrx, σθtx, and σφtx. Also 
note that, considering the FT relationships between the various system functions, 
these spreads can be considered inversely related to various spatial correlations. That 
is, the larger the angular spreads, the shorter the associated spatial correlations. 
Thus, just as delay and Doppler spreads are used in the assessment of the ability 
of channels to support high data rate digital communications, angular spreads are 
used to assess the characteristics of the all-critical MIMO matrix correlation func-
tion RH. If the spreads are small, a qualitative assessment would be that capacity 
gains available on the associated MIMO channel are limited.

 can therefore be assessed by compiling estimates (i.e., 
time-averaged histograms) of corresponding joint power-weighted probability den-
sity functions and comparing them to the products of marginals. If independence 
cannot be verified, joint angular power spectra must be estimated and modeled [28].
In addition to an analysis of angular power spectra, the degree to which wire-
less MIMO channels can support spatial multiplexing can also be assessed more 
directly by an examination of the similarity in the eigenvalues of RH. This similar-
ity, SE [29], can be quantified through the ratio of the geometric mean of the eigen-
values to their arithmetic mean, given by

If the eigenvalues are similar, indicating that the eigenmodes over which data are 
effectively transmitted have similar gains, SE  is close to unity, and the potential for 
multiplexing gains is high. If the eigenvalues are spread over a wide range of values, 
indicating the eigenmodes are unbalanced, SE diminishes, and the potential for 
multiplexing gains is low.

1.4  Data Qualification Processing prior to the 
Estimation of Parameters from Measured Data
In the design of digital wireless systems for operation with high-data rates, there is 
a need to not only know the transmission loss, but also the delay, frequency, and 
direction dispersion characteristics of the radio channels over which transmissions 
are planned. These characteristics are often estimated from measurements using 
test, or channel sounding, transmissions over radio channels typical of the type of 
channel associated with the wireless system of interest.
To sound a radio channel for the estimation of propagation loss, a single tone is 
often transmitted over a calibrated transmit/receive system, and propagation loss 
is taken as the difference between the transmitted and received power after other 
system gains and losses, as, for example, transmission line losses and antenna gains 
have been accounted for. This works well in free space. However, when MPCs can 
be received, the received signal is the vector sum of the multipath waves received 
from all directions, and this vector sum varies over space, time, and frequency, as 
the MPCs add with different phase relationships in accordance with the lengths 
of the paths over which they travel. If the Tx or/and the Rx antennas, or anything 
in the environment, moves, received signal power also varies in time as a result of 
time-varying vector addition of the component waves. It is generally accepted that 
when propagation loss is modeled, the effects of such multipath propagation are 
removed. Then, later in the system design process, account can be made for tempo-
ral, frequency, or spatial variations by adding a received power margin in accordance 
with known statistical distributions of such variations. The effects of the multipath-
induced power variations can be mitigated and often almost eliminated by trans-
mitting a very wideband signal so that different multipath components can be 
resolved in time, thereby avoiding vector addition. The remaining multipath effects 
can be eliminated by averaging over time, space, or frequency. Experimentally, a 
good approach is to average over the minimum range in any of these three domains 
required to effectively eliminate power variations. If the chosen method is to average 
in time, then a mechanism must be devised to stir the mixture of multipath waves so 
that an appropriate range of powers is received at each Rx antenna location such that 
averaging is effective. If spatial averaging is chosen, a mechanism must be devised to 
move at least one of the sounding system antennas over a small area (having dimen-
sions of about a wavelength) repetitively, while the received signal is sampled. To 
enable averaging over frequency, a wideband sounding signal must be used.
A wideband sounding signal must also be used to resolve multipath compo-
nents in delay and allow the estimation of DODs, DOAs, and delay dispersion. 
Ideally, the bandwidth should be infinite, allowing the impulse response of the 
channel of interest to be measured. This yields exact knowledge of dispersion on 
the channel as the time interval between when the direct signal or when this is 
absent, the MPC with the shortest delay, is received over the channel and when the 
last MPC is received. In practice, however, it is difficult to sound radio channels 

Propagation Measurement-Based Wireless Channel ◾ 31
with impulses because of the peak power limitations of hardware, in addition to 
hardware bandwidth limitations and radio regulations. In reality, a rule of thumb 
for channel sounding is that the channel sounding bandwidth should be that 
bandwidth for which the width of the measurement system back-to-back impulse 
response is very much less than that of the channel to be sounded at −20 dB rela-
tive power. There are alternate definitions of this requirement, but they relate to the 
bandwidth intended for transmission in the system under design, the specification 
of which is often one of the objectives of channel sounding.
For the estimation of frequency dispersion, fast (Nyquist) sampling of the 
received signal resulting from single frequency transmission is required while the 
Tx and Rx antennas or objects in the environment move at their fastest rates.
There are a number of methods available [2] for conducting wideband channel 
sounding, including PN sounding, chirp sounding, and swept frequency sounding. 
The latter method can most easily be implemented [30] for operation over multiple 
frequency bands using a commercially available vector network analyser (VNA). When 
a VNA is employed, not only the frequency band to be sounded is selectable, but also 
the sounding bandwidth up to the maximum allowed by the VNA. Based upon the 
consideration of multipath delay resolution, which is the reciprocal of the channel 
sounding bandwidth, antenna bandwidths, and interference avoidance, a transmission 
bandwidth of 500 MHz is often chosen. A drawback with using the VNA approach 
is that time series measurements can only be made at a single frequency, and over only 
short time durations. Thus, frequency dispersion cannot be studied. A second drawback 
is that transmission range (i.e., channel sounder Tx or Rx separation) is historically lim-
ited to the combined lengths of transmission lines that can be run from the VNA to the 
Tx antenna, and from the Rx antenna to the VNA. The authors of [31] report a method 
by which the limitation can be overcome using two VNAs, one at the Tx and one at 
the Rx, but the cited paper reports only narrowband measurements using this system.
The primary objective of using wideband sounding systems is to estimate either 
the sounded channel impulse response, h( )τ , or its frequency-domain transfer func-
tion, H f( ). Once one of these functions is estimated from measurements, an esti-
mate of the other can be obtained by appropriate windowing and direct or inverse 
Fourier transformation. To estimate the time-varying versions, h t( ; )τ  and H t f
( ;
), 
multiple sequential sounding measurements are made. In order to capture Doppler 
effects so as to enable the estimation of correlation times and Doppler spreads, the 
frequency of repetition must be at least twice the maximum expected Doppler 
shift, in accordance with the Nyquist theorem, and is often limited to this value as a 
result of system constraints such as data storage capacity, or data transfer rates. This 
is acceptable in most instances, even without post-measurement filtering for inter-
polation, since often time variations do not have to be reproduced, and it is only the 
statistics of such variations need to be estimated. Likewise, in order to capture spa-
tial variations, multiple channel soundings must be made while the location of one 
or both the channel sounder antennas are moved in space, in increments smaller 
than half the wavelength of the shortest cycles in the anticipated spatial variations.

32 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Regardless of which method is used for channel sounding, and which varia-
tions on the channel it is desired to analyze, measured data and estimates made 
from them are subject to corruption by noise. In addition, if the classical modeling 
and channel classification approach discussed in Section 1.3 is to be applied, the 
stochastic characteristics of the time, frequency, and/or spatial series of measure-
ments must conform at least with those of a WSS model. Often this is true only for 
finite segments in each domain, as either objects in the measurement environment 
move, or the channel sounder antennas move, or both. Throughout the past several 
decades, there have been repeated attempts to specify tests that can be conducted in 
a data qualification stage [32] before final analysis and channel modeling to ensure 
WSS characteristics prevail [33,34]. At the time of writing, however, the author 
would label available techniques as contributions in the gradual development of 
standard methods, with the development of such tests still an area that is open for 
considerable new research. However, later paragraphs in this section describe some 
of the techniques that are known to, and have been applied by, the author in data 
qualification procedures. The following paragraphs begin with the review of a prob-
abilistic method from the literature, for the rejection of noise in impulse response 
estimates. Methods for assessing whether WSS conditions prevail are discussed 
next. This is followed by a description of methods for the estimation of frequency 
correlation functions and envelope fading distributions, the results from which are 
used in data qualification, as well as for channel modeling. Finally, a note is added 
with regard to assessing whether random channel variations can be modeled as 
Gaussian, and whether an assumption of ergodicity is reasonable.
1.4.1  Rejection of Noise from Measured 
Impulse Response Estimates
Of importance is a method for determining when a specific sample within a 
channel impulse response estimate (IRE) represents a valid multipath echo and 
when it is noise. Sometimes researchers simply zero all samples in the enve-
lopes of IREs if their associated powers are below a fixed rejection threshold, 
as for example, −20 dB relative to the peak power per delay resolution interval 
in the IRE. An alternate method [35] is to consider that the last n (i.e., 50 or 
so) samples in IREs are the result of Gaussian noise, rather than multipath 
echoes, as the associated measurement system should have been designed to 
enable measurement of echoes with delays greater than the maximum expected. 
A cumulative distribution function (CDF) for their envelope values therefore 
has a Rayleigh cumulative distribution function (CDF), and its complimentary 
CDF is given by

where σ is the standard deviation of the envelope of the n IRE sample values with 
the greatest delay. This is the probability that the envelope voltage, x, is exceeded if 
it is noise, and in this application, unless noise is rejected, it becomes the probability 
of false detection (PFD), or the probability that a noise sample is taken as being a 
signal sample from an MPC. Taking logarithms, at the median v 50, Equation 1.53 
can be rearranged to give

Thus, if the median of the last n samples in an IRE is estimated, σ can also be esti-
mated. Then, for any desired PFD, the envelope voltage, v th, that must be exceeded 
if an IRE sample is to be considered as energy from an MPC can easily be calculated

If it is known how many samples are in each IRE, one can easily set the PFD as, for 
example, the probability that a single sample within, say 2 IREs, will be incorrectly 
taken to be a sample from an MPC when it is actually noise. Once a value for PFD 
has been decided upon, a noise rejection threshold can be set using Equation 1.55 
to find v th, such that if the samples in any part of the envelope of an IRE have volt-
ages below this threshold, they are set equal to zero. Figure 1.10 shows an example 
of an IRE from measurements made with a VNA, before and after probabilistic 
noise thresholding. In this case, the PFD was set to 1 3
10 3
. ×
−. It can be noted 
that rather than replacing samples where the envelope of the IRE was below the 
probabilistically estimated rejection threshold with zeroes, they were replaced with 
a value equal to 10−10 so a logarithm could be taken for plotting purposes.
Sometimes, even after thresholding, there are sample groups that appear after 
a number of leading samples have been zeroed. It is reported in [36] that if mea-
surement system sampling windows are made long enough so that several impulse 
response functions can be estimated from data sequentially recorded in each sample 
window, a further reduction of noise can be made by rejecting those samples that 
only occur in one of the several IREs estimated during that data window. Based 
upon similar reasoning, single samples that are high enough above the noise rejec-
tion threshold so that two or more samples of the bandlimited IRE envelope should 
have been recorded* if a valid MPC had been received can be rejected. This is 
because even an IRE estimated from a single-propagation path measurement sys-
tem back-to-back connection is usually represented by more than a single sample.
* Recall that even isolated MPCs have a time duration of more than one sample in IREs because 
of the finite bandwidth of any measurement system.

34 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Once noise is rejected from IREs, all other parameters and functions of inter-
est can be derived from such noise-thresholded IREs, or their Fourier transforms, 
with better estimation accuracy than that which would prevail without such 
thresholding.
1.4.2  Assessment of Conformance 
to a Wide-Sense-Stationary Model
As is well-known, the characteristics of a WSS process include a constant mean, and 
an autocorrelation function that is independent of the reference time (or location in 
space or reference frequency, when considering random variations over space or fre-
quency). While it appears initially that verification of these characteristics through 
the examination of sample mean and autocorrelation function estimates should be 
straightforward, there are complications. First, the CPs h t( ; )τ  and H t f
( ;
) that are to 
be analyzed are wideband processes. The question, therefore, arises as to whether the 
widest available bandwidth should be assessed, or whether analyses of narrowband 
samples of the measured CP are adequate. The second problem is that time or spatial 
processes within measured data are in series that have finite lengths. Analyses of such 
series generate sidelobes in autocorrelation estimates. In addition, experience shows 
that the longer a measured series is, the more probable it is that WSS characteristics

degenerate. After long intervals, the averages that are used to characterize WSS pro-
cesses are no longer constant, and conclusions that are drawn from using them as a 
basis for the characterization, modeling, or simulation of wireless channels can be mis-
leading. Thus, the series of samples that must be analyzed is often even much shorter 
than the total length of a measured series, making the sidelobes and any estimation 
errors even more severe. In fact, reported methods for the assessment of whether either 
the mean of a sample from a stochastic process is constant, or its autocorrelation is 
invariant to the index parameter of the process (i.e., time, location, or frequency) 
involve segmenting the sample series into shorter intervals, hereinafter referred to as 
subseries, and comparing results from the analysis of sequential subseries.
One method from the literature [32] is an application of the RUNs test, which 
is really for the assessment of the randomness of a data set. For testing whether the 
mean of a process is constant, it is hypothesized as part of the Runs test that sub-
series means should be random because of estimation errors. Positive or negative 
trends, indicative of nonstationary characteristics, can also be detected. The author 
has used this test to assess the WSS characteristics of a series of frequency domain 
TFEs, H t f
(
)
;
, as follows. Regardless of the system used for the measurements, 
TFEs in such a series are made up of a number of frequency-domain samples, 
herein referred to as spectral line samples. There are a number, M, of such samples 
stretching across the measurement bandwidth, in steps of equal separation, and the 
spectral lines from which they are sampled are comprised of a number, say N, of 
samples that stretch along the index dimension of the CP, in this case, time. Initial 
focus can be on the analysis of one such spectral line, representing a narrowband 
(or CW) signal. If the data are complex, the means of the raw data may be zero due 
to external factors, like receiver motion [8], which would be mitigated by phase-
synchronization in a communication receiver. For the purpose of explanation, 
therefore, it will be assumed that the envelope of the chosen spectral line is under 
analysis. To conduct the Runs test, the mean, median, or some other convenient 
value of the entire series is estimated and used as a reference value. Then, the series 
is broken up into subseries of equal lengths, and the mean of each of the subseries is 
estimated. If the sample mean for a particular subseries is greater than the reference 
value, it is assigned a “+,” and if it is smaller than the reference value it is assigned a 
“−.” A run is then defined as a sequence of such results that either contain all posi-
tive or all negative assignments. The number of runs, N R, is then counted. The null 
hypothesis H0 for the test* is then designated to be the case when the sequence is 
random, with the alternate hypothesis, Ha, being that the sequence is not random. 
The test statistic is then computed [37] as

Z is taken as standard normal if n1 and n2 are large (say > 10)
For smaller values of n1 and n2, the (critical) value that Z must be greater than can be 
found in tables [32,38]. If the test shows that the subseries means are not random, 
the conclusion should be that the measured series should not be modeled as being 
WSS. If the overall hypothesis of conformance to a WSS model is rejected, the 
usual procedure is to shorten the series under analysis and repeat the test until H0 
cannot be rejected. The result from a long series of measurements may be a series of 
shorter consistency intervals of data that can be analyzed under WSS assumptions, 
and the statistics of results can, in turn, be estimated. For wideband data, this test 
could be applied for more than one spectral line, and conclusions drawn from the 
overall results. Rather than applying the runs test to assess randomness, one could 
also apply the Student’s t test [39] to determine the significance of differences in 
the subseries means.
A search of the literature has failed to identify a hypothesis test that can be 
applied to determine if autocorrelation function estimates from consecutive sub-
series in a longer measured data series are really estimates of the same autocor-
relation, which would indicate invariance of the autocorrelation with the index 
parameter of the process. However, on the assumption that sidelobes from autocor-
relation function estimates are random, averaging could be applied for their reduc-
tion. In this case, autocorrelation estimates centered on different references could 
be computed and averaged over short windows, with the results from consecutive 
windows compared in order to draw conclusions. A related procedure would involve 
the estimation of structure functions [40] and their comparison with autocorrela-
tion estimates. In [40], an important extension to processes that are classified as 

Propagation Measurement-Based Wireless Channel ◾ 37
statistically stationary is reported to have been proposed by Kolmogorov, who noted 
that, although velocity fields in turbulence are not homogeneous, the  difference in 
velocities at two different locations is homogeneous over wide spatial ranges. That 
is, if a random function of this type is denoted f ( )

Approaches that have also been used by the author are more physical based. In 
these approaches, it is conjectured that the multipath process that causes variations 
of the channel transfer function needs to be consistent if the CP is to be modeled 
as WSS process. Here, it is meant by consistent, either that variations in some 

38 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
attribute of the CP are from the same underlying random distribution, or that 
so-called clusters in its spatial characteristics remain constant (i.e., the same physi-
cal clusters of scattering or reflecting objects determine the CP over a consistency 
interval). To test consistency in terms of randomness, the Two-Sample KS test can 
be used. This test is conducted in a similar manner to the One-Sample KS test, 
described in Section 1.4.3, except that the test statistic, Dmax, is set equal to the 
maximum difference between two ECDFs, rather than an ECDF and a model. 
This Two-Sample test is conducted the same way in which the One-Sample KS test 
is conducted, and the complimentary cumulative probability distribution for Dmax 
is given approximately by Equation 1.72, except that the number Ne, that should 
be used in this equation is given by

where:
N1 is the number of independent samples in the first ECDF
N 2 is the number of independent samples in the second ECDF
A hypothesis test for independence of a data series is described in Section 1.4.3. 
The Two-Sample KS test is used to determine if two ECDFs represent the same 
underlying random process. Thus, if ECDFs can be estimated for radio channel 
parameters and compared for sequentially recorded data using KS tests, it should 
be possible to determine when changes in a CP take place. However, the require-
ment for multiple data snapshots whenever high-resolution parameter estimates are 
made limits time and distance resolutions by smearing change points. In addition, 
critical values (thresholds for rejection of H0) for the required KS tests are obscure. 
This is because such values depend on the number of independent samples being 
analyzed, but it is not clear how to estimate this number when multiple MPC 
parameters (e.g., DOAs, DODs delays, and powers) are being estimated each time 
the CP is sampled. The first of these problems can be overcome by making sliding, 
or overlapping estimates of the channel parameters. The second can be mitigated 
using preprocessing to estimate critical values by recognizing and accounting for 
extraneous parameters that, in addition to true changes in the CP, can lead to 
distances between compared ECDFs. These factors include finite sample sizes and 
errors in the processes used to estimate channel parameters. To account for such 
factors, the first step involves the estimate of multiple ECDFs for channel param-
eters from multiple data sets recorded under physical conditions wherein it is rea-
sonably certain that there are no true changes in the CP. Critical values are then set 
equal to the maxima of ECDF distances for such sample sets. Consistency intervals 
can then be estimated by estimating DOA, DOD, and excess delay ECDFs from 
consecutive data snapshots. Then, ECDFs associated with reference snapshots are 
compared with ECDFs associated with previous and following snapshots using the 

Propagation Measurement-Based Wireless Channel ◾ 39
Two-Sample KS test until H0 is rejected, thereby defining the limits of a consis-
tency interval. Robustness can be ensured by requiring that consistency is satis-
fied for all estimated parameters simultaneously. An example of the use of this 
method for estimating consistency intervals by detecting changes in envelope fad-
ing ECDFs can be found in [41]. An example of estimating CIs by monitoring 
changes in directional data after estimating cluster properties can be found in [23].
For the assessment of whether WSS-like characteristics prevail on MIMO chan-
nels, a metric referred to as correlation matrix distance has been applied [42]. This 
metric was conceived by considering the n×1 signal vector, x t( ) of complex voltages 
on a MIMO receive antenna array to be a zero-mean stochastic vector process that 
is fully characterized by the time-dependent correlation matrix

be incremented until dcM reaches some predefined value near unity, which would 
define the outer boundary of the consistency interval.

1.4.3  Modeling Estimates for Probability 
Distribution Functions
To determine if the probability distribution of the underlying random population 
from which a series of values is sampled can be modeled using a specific pdf or 
CDF, hypothesis testing is necessary.* In this process, what are referred to as null 
and alternate hypotheses, H0 and Ha, are established. A test statistic, ε, that can 
be computed in some way by comparison of some characteristic (e.g., mean, epdf, 
ECDF) of the collection of sampled values to the same characteristic of a model 
is specified. A distribution for the test statistic, given the null hypothesis is true, 
is then found either analytically or through simulations. The distributions for the 
test statistics that are used in many well-known hypothesis tests can be found in 
the literature. A value ′ε  for the test statistic is then computed, and the probability 
P

]

0  that the test statistic is greater than its value as estimated from the 
data, given H0  is true, is computed from the distribution for ε. If this probability, 
referred to as the “p” value for the test, is lower than a value, α, referred to as the 
significance level of the test, H0 is rejected and the alternate, Ha is concluded to 
be true. The significance level, α, can be considered to be the probability, given 
H0 is true, that H0 is incorrectly rejected. A commonly-used value for α is 5%. 
To test whether an analytical pdf is a good model for the pdf of the underlying 
random population from which a collection of experimental values is sampled, the 
Chi-square test can be used. To test the appropriateness of a model CDF, the One 
Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be used. The accuracy and relative merits of 
the two tests under different circumstances is discussed in [39,43]. Whereas it is 
easy to find a good description of the Chi-square test in the literature [39], descrip-
tions of the one-sample KS test are sometimes incomplete, such that it is considered 
of value to provide a description here.
The One-Sample KS test uses as its test statistic the maximum, Dmax, of the dif-
ference F

 between an ECDF, F

has been found [43,44] to follow a Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution. The test 
can either involve rejecting H0 if Dmax is greater than a critical value, ν, for which

* Simple least mean squared fits to pdfs and CDFs estimated from sampled values can lead 
to significant errors in modeling, as such estimates can vary from sample set-to-sample set. 
Instead, the probabilistic consideration of functions that truly represent characteristics of the 
underlying random population, rather than just a sample from that population, are necessary.

N  is the number of independent values in the sampled data set. Equation 1.72 
is strictly applicable only if the parameters of the model distribution, F x
( ) are com-
pletely known, independent of the experimental data. In many instances, however, 
such parameters are not known and must be estimated from the sampled data*. 
One might imagine then, if the parameters of F x
( ) are chosen specifically to fit the 
sampled data, Dmax has significant probability of being smaller than it might other-
wise be, so that p is larger, [43]. The effect is that a decision based on such values is 
conservative in that the significance level, or the probability of incorrectly rejecting 
H0, is lower than for the case when F x
( ) is completely specified.
The estimation of 
′
N  requires the estimation of the time-series lag, δ, at which 
the sampled data are independent, or so-called serially independent. The value 
′
N  
is then equal to (
/ )
N δ . Alternately, the data can be thinned by repeatedly removing 
every second value until consecutive values can be declared, as for example, through 
hypothesis testing, as being from independent underlying populations, after which 
N ′ is taken to be the number of remaining data samples. In general, the determina-
tion of serial independence seems, from a study of the literature, to be difficult and 
a number of fairly complicated papers on the subject exist. However, for the pur-
poses of the current application, three approaches can be taken. The first of these 
is to plot the sampled data in pairs, separated by n-sample lags, in a scatter plot, 
with the first sample from each pair on the ordinate, say, and the second sample 
on the abscissa. The approximate lag, δ, between pairs of samples that are serially 
independent can then be taken as the lag at which there is a significant scatter in 
the resulting plot. Although an absence of dependence is indicated by an absence 
of correlation only for Gaussian processes strictly, another approximate method for 
estimating N ′ would be to divide N by the sample lag at which an estimate of the 
autocorrelation function for the data set diminishes to some small value, say 1/e. 
Finally, the problem of determining serial independence in the residuals of regres-
sion models and autoregressive integrated moving average models has been studied 
rigorously by several researchers [37,38], and resulting hypothesis tests appear to 
be applicable to the problem under discussion. In particular, a hypothesis test pub-
lished by Ljung and Box [38] can be applied using the following steps: 
* Papers from literature on statistics recommend that parameters for F(x) should be estimated 
using maximum likelihood methods. However, in practice, the method of moments is often 
used, wherein, for example, means are estimated by using sample means, and standard devia-
tions are estimated using sample standard deviations.

First, H0 is specified to be the hypothesis that the sampled data are indepen-
dently distributed, whereas Ha is taken to be the hypothesis that the data are not

1.4.4  Estimation of Frequency Correlation Functions 
and the Confirmation of Uncorrelated Scattering
The most often used method by which FCFs are derived from measured impulse 
response estimates is through the FT relationship in Equation 1.24. However, 
recall that the validity of Equation 1.24 is based upon the modeling of a time-
varying wireless channel as a ZMGWSSUS stochastic process. The conditions 
required for such modeling are not always met. An alternate [8] approach that 
avoids a requirement for most of the ZMGWSSUS conditions is to directly cross 
correlate spectral lines in a series of TFEs. Let a time series of TFEs derived by 
FT from a time series of noise-thresholded IREs be denoted as H t
f
i
j
(
)
;
, where 
“i” orders the time-domain samples from 1 to N, and “j” orders the spectral lines 
across the bandwidth of the measurement system from 1 to M. As a first step, a 
spectral line at a frequency (

f ref  near midband* can be chosen as a reference, and 
the time variations at each spectral line can be cross correlated against this refer-
ence to give

synchronization, would have a nonzero mean along the “t” dimension, at 
any frequency, f, hence violating the zero-mean assumption in the channel 
modeling. This consideration is important, for example, when estimat-
ing Bc as the bandwidth over which correlation drops to some prespecified 
value. If R

1.4.5  Considerations Related to Assumptions 
of Gaussianity and Ergodicity
It should be noted [8] that neither the analysis of measured data, (e.g., single spec-
tral lines in a time, frequency, or spatial series of values for ˆ( )
H f ), to determine 
if complex quadrature components can be modeled as Gaussian nor a determina-
tion of whether narrowband envelope variations can be modeled as Rayleigh or 
Rician, can be used to determine if an assumption of Gaussianity is justified. This 
is because such modeling inherently assumes ergodicity, which may not be a valid 
assumption. A better approach, particularly with the availability of high-resolution 
processing results, is to asses Gaussianity through the central limit theorem. Then, 
if the measured data also conform to a WSS model, ergodicity can be considered to 
be a reasonable assumption over WSS intervals. As verification, an analysis of fad-
ing distributions can then be conducted. The author knows of no other way, except 
by intuitive reasoning, that an assumption of ergodicity can be justified.
* Contoured sounding spectra, such as that produced by pseudo-noise channel sounders, can be

48 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
2.1 Introduction: From LTE to 5G
The technology of 4G, namely LTE and LTE-A [1], has unleashed an unprecedented 
growth of connected devices and mobile data rates reaching up to 100 and 300 Mbps, 
respectively (theoretical values). This paves the way for the standardization, imple-
mentation, and launching of the 5th-generation (5G) technology and services [2], 
as the number of connected Internet of things (IoT) is estimated to reach 50 billion 
by 2020 [3], while the mobile data traffic is expected to grow to 24.3 Exabytes per 
month by 2019 [4].
The number of LTE networks deployed per region was studied in [5]. In 
Europe, after a slow start, the adoption of LTE has significantly accelerated, with 
124 commercial networks up and running. At the end of Q2-2014, there were 
more than 280 million LTE subscribers worldwide (with a large portion being in 
Unites States).
LTE networks are deployed in a broad range of frequency bands. In Europe, 
most of the LTE deployments are happening in new 4G FDD bands such as 
800 MHz (LTE band 20) and 2.6 GHz (LTE band 7). Many deployments are also 
on-going in 1800 MHz, which was previously allocated for GSM. A few countries 
(especially in Scandinavia at present) are also deploying LTE at 450 MHz. Today, 
LTE can be deployed in a large range of spectrum bands starting from 450 MHz up 
to 3.8 GHz [5].
It is suggested that a new generation of 5G standards may be introduced 
approximately in the early 2020s [6]. The 5G will provide not only higher data 
rates, as this is already in the work in progress phase of current backhaul tech-
nologies for the congested LTE/LTE-A networks (particularly in urban areas with 
dense population and various obstacles) [7], but will also introduce a whole new 
concept of design and implementation toward the IoT, by allowing the intercon-
nection of mobile and handheld devices with vehicles, automated equipment, and 
paving the way for machine-to-machine communications [8].
The 5G technology will satisfy key requirements such as: (a) massive number 
of connected devices, (b) very high link reliability, and (c) low latency and real-
time operation [9]. Various services and applications will be made feasible and 
available through 5G: smart houses and smart offices, as well as smart cities on 
a greater urban scalability. In addition, telemetry and e-health applications will 
provide higher reliability and will allow for the development of both telemedicine 
services in remote white areas as well as the further progress in body area networks 
(BANs) with both in-body and on-body sensors.
Figure 2.1 presents some of the key applications supported and enhanced by 5G.

2.2 5G below 6 GHz
2.2.1 The Move toward mm-Wave Communications
The spectrum employed for 5G is one of the key issues of discussion, research, even 
debate amidst industry and academia. Recent works argue in favor of dedicating 
frequencies above 30 GHz (EHF band) for the deployment of both the core and the 
backhaul 5G network [10]. More specifically, potential bands for 5G spectrum are: 
the 28 GHz band (27.5–29.5 GHz), the 38 GHz band (36–40 GHz), the 60 GHz 
band (57–64 GHz), the E-band (71–76 GHz and 81–86 GHz) and finally, the 
W band (92–95 GHz) [11].
The frequency band of 28 GHz is considered as a possible candidate for the 
core 5G network, whereas small cell solutions for 5G (the equivalent of today’s

backhaul for LTE networks) can operate in the mm-Wave band above 70 GHz. 
In addition, indoor 5G can be deployed in the EHF band as well, utilizing the 
directional, O2-attenuated spectrum around 60 GHz [12–14].
Channel modeling for the mm-Wave band has been thoroughly investigated 
in a number of recent published works [15–26]: investigating the increased 
distance-dependent attenuation in the EHF band, the intrinsic channel char-
acteristics due to atmosphere and oxygen absorption, as well as rain attenuation 
(i.e., at the 70 GHz channel), and the directivity that is an outcome of all the 
aforementioned losses.
Obstacle losses, by nature frequency-dependent, will also come into the fore-
front as critical parameters for the calculation of excess path loss and the physical 
limitations of the EHF channel will serve as a basis for the service limitations 
when a massive number of users need to be simultaneously connected within a 
network providing robust and seamless broadband services over wireless links in 
metropolitan urban areas.
In [15], a path loss investigation for the 28 GHz channel for a densely popu-
lated, heavily shadowed urban area (Manhattan, New York City), as a validation 
scheme for the physical limitations of a potential core 5G network, has been con-
ducted. As already mentioned, the indoor 60 GHz channel can be employed for 
upcoming 5G femto infrastructure that will allow the design and implementation 
of smart houses. In [12], a comparative study between the current 2.4 GHz channel 
and the proposed 60 GHz scheme was conducted.
2.2.2 Launching 5G in Microwave
Propagation validation and channel modeling for the mm-Wave band has gath-
ered a lot of scientific interest with recent projects investigating the potential of 
implementing 5G directly in the higher EHF spectrum [27–35]. These publications 
conduct both simulation and experimental measurements and provide solutions for 
hardware equipment as well, that is, channel sounders, in order to study the impact 
of small-scale fading (multipath).
In addition, as stated in [36], the FCC allocated approximately 11 GHz for 
flexible, mobile, and fixed use wireless broadband, comprising 7 GHz of unlicensed 
spectrum from 64 to 71 GHz and 3.85 GHz of licensed spectrum, designated as a 
new upper microwave flexible use service, in three bands: 
 
◾27.5–28.35 GHz
 
◾37–38.6 GHz
 
◾38.6–40 GHz
The move toward the mm-Wave spectrum reveals a lot of potential for bandwidth, 
throughput, and capacity growth for the 5G upcoming technology. It is, however, a 

RF Channel Modeling for 5G Systems ◾ 51
band that still needs to be thoroughly investigated and its specific characteristics are 
yet to be fully addressed. Atmosphere effects and attenuation due to irregularities 
need to be considered. In addition, providers will have to face the cost of imple-
menting their 5G equipment from scratch; therefore, Capital and Operational 
Expenditure (Capex & Opex, respectively) need to be carefully planned before 
moving to the EHF electronics and hardware.
A possible transitional step toward mm-Wave 5G might be to launch the technol-
ogy in the currently utilized microwave spectrum. In 37, a possible scheme of transi-
tion toward 5G via the existing LTE networks is considered, according to which the 
launching of 5G is possible via an upgraded migration from the existing LTE core in 
the following years leading up to 2020.
A significant milestone in the migration from LTE/LTE-A to 5G is the 
microwave backhaul provided for the present congested 4G networks [38]. The 
sub-6 GHz band provides backhaul support in both the licensed and the unlicensed 
spectrum, and various solutions have been proposed in order to mitigate user traffic 
and provide total downlink bit rates up to 500 Mbps. Mobile operators and wireless 
technology providers have already begun the transition toward 5G via the existing 
mobile/cellular broadband infrastructure [39].
Launching 5G in the microwave spectrum requires investigation concerning 
the candidate carrier frequencies, as well as the possibility of employing cogni-
tive radio to utilize additional spectrum in the sub-6 GHz band. Capacity and 
congestion issues will remain critical since many of these frequencies are already 
overcrowded and the service limitations have already put boundaries on the 4G 
technology. However, as a transitional step until mm-Wave band equipment 
and logistics fall into reasonable costs for the operators, it is a viable and feasible 
solution. Therefore, the key aspects of backhaul support for 4G/4G+ need to 
be briefly discussed.
2.2.3 LTE/LTE-A Backhaul
Backhaul for LTE/LTE-A was developed in order to mitigate congestion 
especially in urban shadowed areas where user traffic and severe attenuation 
decreased the performance of wireless broadband services [40–42]. As shown in 
[43,44], the theoretical bounds of 100 and 300 Mbps for 4G and 4G+, respec-
tively, are approximately met when high SNR requirements are met, if macro 
cells are considered (the core LTE network). Small cells can operate as back-
haul structures, intervening either in cell-edge or in selected locations within an 
urban deployment scheme with antennas located as high as lamp posts or street 
signs [45,46].
Current backhaul providers have investigated the demands in both point-to-
point and point-to-Multipoint LTE services. Open issues, confirmed and emerging 
trends have been discussed thoroughly in [46]. More specifically, confirmed trends 

52 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
include small-cell backhaul requirements different from macro-cell backhaul, a 
higher (%) of backhaul TCO in small cells than in macro cells, the emergence 
of solutions specific to small—cell deployments, coexistence of multiple solutions 
(Fiber and Wireless, LOS and NLOS), and a complexity from a multiventor, mul-
titechnology backhaul approach. Emerging trends include increased flexibility in 
available backhaul solutions, partnerships among vendors, more Wi-Fi and 3G 
small cells, new support for indoor small cells, serious consideration of the 3.5 GHz 
channel for small-cell access, a blurring line between LOS and NLOS, and vendor 
focus on shorter installation process.
Even though fiber backhaul is also supported by specific providers, its cost and 
complexity, related both to the actual construction of the fiber infrastructure as 
well as legal and regulatory issues, render it as a less popular solution amidst pro-
viders and clients. Wireless backhaul for outdoor urban congested LTE networks 
has increased in both popularity and demand and newer solutions exploit both the 
sub-6 GHz band and new, higher frequencies of interest in the upper bound of 
the SHF band and the EHF band.
Cost is a critical issue when providing a backhaul solution for congested LTE 
cells, which are considered as macro-cells operating at the microwave frequen-
cies established by each 4G provider. Backhaul solutions can either consider 
line-of-sight (LOS) or non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, even though there is 
a blurring line between the two conditions, with the emergence of obstructed-
line-of-sight (OLOS) as a site-general method for outdoor propagation topolo-
gies [47].
The impact of backhaul on the percentage of total equipment cost for small 
cells and macro-cells differs significantly. Naturally, the cost increases as we move 
to licensed bands and the LOS scenario (PTP) demands more resources. When 
macro-cells are considered, the cost decreases as small cells are essentially imple-
mented for backhaul support of LTE networks. If fiber is not available as an exist-
ing infrastructure or if legal or regulatory issues arise, then wireless backhaul in the 
sub-6 GHz band should be investigated, for licensed frequencies. If such spectrum 
is not available or is insufficient for the needs of the congested macro LTE network, 
then mm-Wave backhaul should be selected as the best solution, if LOS is available 
and reliable. Otherwise, if relay hop cannot cover for the LOS requirements, then 
unlicensed spectrum in the sub-6 GHz should be sought. If none of the wireless 
backhaul solutions work, then the only solution would be to seek fiber-optic back-
haul regardless of the cost.
The methodology described in the small-cell backhaul decision tree was 
investigated and implemented for simulation purposes in [48], as a math-
ematical validation of a web-based, techno-economic tool for PPDR services 
over a dedicated LTE security network, deployed in an urban environment at 
700 MHz. The total cost was calculated over a six-year period for various chan-
nel conditions (NLOS) and for variable urban surface coverage. The results are 
shown in Figure 2.2.

2.3 Path Loss Models in the Sub-6 GHz Band
2.3.1 Path Loss Modeling for Microwave Propagation
Path loss modeling involves the calculation of all attenuation losses in a logarithmic 
formula that incorporates both losses from distance-dependent attenuation due to 
free space propagation as well as losses from all various mechanisms influencing 
the signal trajectory, such as reflection, scattering, and diffraction [49]. In addition, 
path loss modeling accounts for the losses due to various intrinsic irregularities as 
well as losses due to atmospheric phenomena [50].
The fundamental reference path loss model is the Free Space model which 
is a logarithmic expression of the Friis formula, assuming an ideal propagation 
scenario with no obstacles, or terrain geographic characteristics, and no antenna 
heights [51]. According to path loss modeling theory, the average received power 
at a given measurement location is provided by Parsons [52]:

where:
f is the carrier frequency of the transmitted signal (MHz)
d is the T-R separation (in km)
In both equations, the T-R separation distance has been calculated in order to 
incorporate the transmitter and receiver antenna heights.
The idealistic propagation assumptions of the Free Space model render it reliable 
only for LOS cases. In the original Free Space formula, the path loss exponent is set 
to n = 2, which is in accordance with the inverse-square law derived out of the Friis 
equation (ideal propagation of electromagnetic wave into free space).
The large-scale variations of the received power have been attributed to losses by 
obstacles of proportions significantly larger than the signal wavelength, which remain 
constant over a time scale of seconds or minutes (large-scale fading). The shadowing 
deviation, or shadow depth, expresses the excess path loss, defined by Jakes as “the 
difference (in decibels) between the computed value of the received signal strength 
in free space and the actual measured value of the local mean received signal” [53].
These fluctuations have been proven to follow the log-normal distribution [54]. 
From the aforementioned discussion it is more than apparent that the accurate predic-
tion of received power fluctuations around a mean value is of critical importance in 
order to achieve a robust network planning in terms of Outage Probability calculation.
Shadow fading losses can be incorporated in the logarithmic path loss formula 
with a Gaussian variable. This is the mathematical expression of the Log-Distance 
path loss model [55]:

RF Channel Modeling for 5G Systems ◾ 55
The parameter z stands for the percentage of coverage probability [54]. For best 
case scenarios with a coverage probability of 98%, z equals 2. In sub-optimal, real-
istic schemes, as the one considered in this work, z equals 1.645 for a coverage 
probability of 95% [49].
The log-Distance model attempts to incorporate all losses other than distance-
dependent attenuation due to free space propagation in one single variable. This 
demands a very precise calculation of the shadow depth, particularly in complex, 
obstacle-dense outdoor propagation topologies. Such a method has been devel-
oped and will be discussed next. It is, however, imperative to be able to take into 
consideration the antenna heights as well as density of building structure discretely 
and not in a single, all-inclusive variable, in order to investigate the impact of 
these different phenomena independently. This has led to the development and 
validation of certain empirical path loss models, where the mathematical formula 
is derived from extensive on-site measurements, either in urban and suburban or 
in open, rural areas [55].
The Hata model [56] is a mathematical expression of an empirical model first 
developed by Okumura in the 1960s [57]. Whereas the Okumura model was 
based on curves obtained from extensive measurements in urban areas in Japan, 
the Hata model, developed in 1980, allowed for an elaborate mathematical loga-
rithmic formula [56]:

The original Hata model is distance-bound (1–20 km) and frequency-bound 
(150–1500  MHz). Various extensions have been suggested, with an original 
2 GHz bound [54]. The Hata model was validated for frequencies beyond the 
2 GHz in [47].
Another empirical path loss model suitable for validation of RF propagation in 
heavily shadowed urban areas is the Walfish-Ikegami, an elaborate path loss model 
originally developed for cellular bands (800 MHz–2 GHz limitation) with a 5 km 
upper distance-bound [58,59].

These models have been developed especially for urban and suburban shadowed 
areas. A number of RF models has been developed for open, rural areas, such as 
the Longley-Rice and the Egli model, where scarce number of users over extended 
coverage distances is assumed [49,54].
Indoor propagation presents an even more complex environment in terms of 
both attenuation losses and the number of phenomena that need to be considered 
and investigated. The increased number of obstacles of various types and materials 
whose dimensions are comparable to the signal wavelength cause signal scatter-
ing, which adds to the complexity of the wireless channel characterization. Further 
attenuation is caused by signal penetration of walls and floors, as well as from 
human intervention, also known as body shadowing [60].
The ITU indoor path loss model is described by the following formula [49]:

For same floor measurements, Lf n
( ) = 0. ITU specifications [49] provide a number 
of values for the slope factor (path loss exponent) for different carrier frequencies. 

RF Channel Modeling for 5G Systems ◾ 57
These original specifications have, however, been proven to be inaccurate for the 
2.4 GHz frequency band for all indoor propagation topologies. Numerical adjust-
ments have been provided for the slope factor values for each topology, and for the 
multiple floors measurements in the office topology, the floor penetration factor 
has also been corrected [61].
The Multi-Wall-Floor (MWF) model is a path loss model whose formula is 
provided by Lott and Forkel [62]:

Lwik is the attenuation due to kth traversed wall type i

Kwi is the number of walls type i
Kfj is the number of floors type j
The mathematical expression assumes two categories of losses: losses due to free space 
propagation and losses caused by all the various types of walls and floor that may 
come into the path of the propagated signal. Moreover, the MWF model considers 
different losses for different types of materials, at a given frequency of transmission.
The MWF model also takes into account the decreasing penetration loss of 
walls and floors of the same material as their number increases [62].
Attenuation over distance (dB/m) is another key parameter employed for the 
calculation of excess path loss in wireless propagation. Instead of incorporating all 
excess path loss in a single shadow variable, the attenuation over distance considers a 
rate of attenuation as the distance linearly increases and also provides such a metric 
for the characterization of the propagation topology.
Attenuation over distance can be calculated via the Linear Attenuation Model 
(LAM), also known as the Devasirvatham model [63]:

2.3.2 The 3.5 GHz Channel
Another frequency of interest is the 3.5 GHz channel. Originally considered as a 
WiMax frequency, the 3.5 GHz channel has also been featured in scientific works 
[64–66], which investigate the variations of the signal amplitude and phase in both 
indoor and outdoor scenarios.
The 3.5 GHz band has emerged as a promising candidate, in the long term, 
for the dedicated use of small cells [46]. Offering a presently underutilized spectrum, 
the 3.5 GHz channel remains a matter of debate amidst providers, as to whether it can 
be more suitably employed as an access or a backhaul frequency, offering advantages 
and disadvantages for both scenarios.
In [67], the fundamental path loss models were employed for the validation of 
their predictions, in terms of received signal power and compatibility of the local 
mean values of the signal strength with the log-normal distribution, for a selected, 
obstacle-dense, indoor propagation topology. The results, depicted in Tables 2.1 
and 2.2, allowed for the first time the calculation of obstacle losses for this specific 
frequency. Comparison with losses measured for the 2.4 GHz confirmed the fre-
quency-dependent nature of obstacle attenuation and opened the way for immedi-
ate future work in the 3.5 GHz channel including more indoor topologies, as hinted 
in [68], as well as outdoor propagation scenarios.

2.3.3 The 5–6 GHz Band
The 802.11p protocol has been designed for vehicular communications and 
applied mostly in outdoor highway scenarios that can potentially include road-
side units (RSUs) [69–70]. A series of works has investigated the robustness of 
protocols designed and developed in order to support vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or 
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications that can contain warning mes-
sages or periodical signal information about road traffic, weather updates, and 
safety information.
Operating in the 5.89  GHz frequency, these protocols opened the way for 
research that incorporates studies of channel characterization along with routing 
techniques for highway and vehicular scenarios [71–77]. These works assumed a 
propagation topology outside the boundaries of urban and suburban topologies. 
Essentially an open, rural-area scenario, the dominant attenuation loss in the high-
way environment was due to free space propagation, and the excess path loss was 
confined to scattering losses, diffraction, and shadow losses due to the height of 
vehicles such as trucks and buses. As vehicular communications continued to grow, 
the need for further channel modeling and RF validation in the 5–6 GHz band 
provided further results, as shown in [78,79].
In [80], the deployment of a roadside network was investigated for V2I com-
munications. The findings of this work have been extended to include LTE-A and 
a possible migration to 5G for a city scenario instead of a highway topology. The 
process of moving the 5–6 GHz band from the open highway to the urban scenario 
is already beginning to garner scientific and academic interest. A thorough survey 
in [81] showcased the dynamics of channel modeling for this spectrum at urban 
propagation topologies.
In [46], the backhaul solutions for the congestion of 4G/4G+ networks included 
a scenario in the 5–6 GHz for NLOS backhaul by commercially available products. 
Vehicular communications and roadside networking will continue to grow as we 
move toward the 5G deployment. Therefore, further research in this band will cer-
tainly enhance the findings concerning path loss modeling and will contribute to 
the spectrum potential for 5G.

2.3.4 All-Inclusive Frequency Range Models
Recent published works [82–86] have studied, as part of a broader research, chan-
nel models with a very large band spectrum of applicability. From 500 MHz up to 
80 GHz, 3D channel models have been validated and their prediction reliability 
is suggested as an input to 5G deployment. As the 700 MHz band is reserved for 
safety solutions and security networks in Europe [5] and the mm-Wave frequencies 
such as 73 and 80 GHz have been suggested as potential backhaul for 5G [15], 
channel models that have been validated for the whole spectrum of UHF, SHF, and 
EHF bands are of critical importance.
A major modeling work was conducted in [85] across a wide range of selected 
frequencies: 2, 5.6, 10.25, 28.5, 39.3, and 73.5 GHz. Two sets of data processing 
were employed: the first set was the measurement set, which was used to compute 
the parameters of the RF models and the second set was the prediction set where the 
shadow fading standard deviation was computed at different distances, frequencies, 
and environments (dB). The measured data was from 2 to 28 GHz, whereas the ray 
tracing technique provided data sets up to 73 GHz.
2.4 Large-Scale Fading for 5G
Research in both theoretical and experimental works has confirmed that the large-scale 
variations of the received power follow the log-normal distribution [53,54]. Hence, the 
logarithmic values of the local mean power (dBw or dBm) comply with the Gaussian 
distribution. The probability density function (PDF) of the Gaussian distribution for 
the logarithmic values of the received power values is derived by Rappaport [54]:

where:
x is the received power (logarithmic value) in each measurement location (local 
mean strength)
x is the average received power (logarithmic value) for all measurement locations 
(median value of the received power overall the topology in question)
σ is the standard deviation of the shadowing losses (in dB)
Given a pool of experimentally obtained i received power values corresponding to 
respective measurement locations in a propagation topology, the mean value and 
standard deviation of the distribution of these values can be calculated by Seybold 
and Parsons [49,52]:

(2.16)
In order to provide unbiased results, a significantly large number of i samples are 
required [53]; therefore, the measurements need to be extensive and reliable, averag-
ing the small-scale phenomena with sufficient local mean samples [54].
The Log-Distance model is the reference method that incorporates shadow fad-
ing losses in its mathematical formula and provides predictions for the excess path 
loss. It requires, however, a precise value assignment for both the path loss exponent 
and the log-normal shadowing variable in order to provide reliable estimations. 
Expressing all the various attenuation losses in a single variable can compromise the 
reliability of the predictions.
A reliable alternative solution for estimating the excess path loss lies in the MWF 
model [62] that calculates the losses due to obstacles, walls, and floors notably, and the 
decreasing penetration as the number of obstacles of a given type and material increases.
Therefore, the losses (in decibels) caused by walls and floors and expressed by

has provided the basis of a novel empirical method for the calculation of shadowing 
deviation [87].

Thus, the shadowing deviation (in dB) is directly calculated from the losses caused by 
obstacles along the signal propagation path. This method does not require extensive 
RF measurements; it only requires limited measurements near the obstacles in order 
to obtain the respective penetration losses. The robustness of this method has been 
validated in [87] for the 2.4 GHz channel and in 67 for the 3.5 GHz channel.
An alternative method for calculating the excess path loss lies in the LAM 
that incorporates all losses in the attenuation over distance metric (in dB/m). 
Comparing the shadow depth, as provided from the obstacle losses, to the attenua-
tion over distance has provided with some a new formula for calculating the linear 
attenuation metric [88]: 
 
a

(2.18)
The mean error of this method is provided in Table 2.3.
In the channel models covering the whole range from microwave to the mm-
Wave band, the shadow fading deviation has been calculated from prediction sets 
with input values derived from measured sets over distance, frequency, and different 
topologies [85].

62 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
2.5  Comparison of Modeling Approaches: 
Conclusions and Future Work
Both the microwave spectrum (below 6 GHz) and the mm-Wave band have demon-
strated a wide variety of path loss models, empirical and semi-empirical, stochastic 
and deterministic, with varied reliability and scalability performance for different 
propagation topologies and channel characteristics. Measurements have always been 
the criterion with which each model is validated in terms of relative mean error and 
error deviation (usually in dB).
Microwave models will remain relevant since the sub-6 GHz may very well be 
the launching stage of 5G, migrating from the backhaul extension of 4G/4G+. 
Models such as Walfish-Ikegami and even the modified Hata model will still func-
tion as reference models for urban and suburban topologies, and researchers will 
investigate the potential of extending these models beyond their original spectrum 
and distance limitations, as proven in a first step in [47].
Concerning the 5–6 GHz band, the models described in Section 2.3.3 provide 
predictions of the received signal strength employing both geometric stochastic and 
deterministic methods, as well as non-geometric calculations. The shift from the open, 
rural environment of conventional highway scenarios toward the urban and suburban 
road network converges with the migration of V2V, V2I communications and road-
side networks toward the 5G era of low-latency vehicular broadband communications.
The mm-Wave band provides a potential for bit rates up to 10 Gbps (burst peak 
rate) and average rates of 1 Gbps, with opportunities for bandwidth up to 1 GHz. 
The phenomena of very severe directivity and loss of omni-directional transmission 
in the higher frequencies, that is, 60, 73, and 80 GHz is mitigated by the poten-
tial for beam forming and massive MIMO. There are, however, cost issues with 
regard to massive production and deployment of hardware electronics in those 
frequencies as well as the need to launch the access network of 5G in a lower EHF

frequency, that is, 39 GHz, and maintain the higher frequencies for 5G backhaul. 
Moreover, research has to deal with on-going propagation and attenuation issues 
in the mm-Wave band (atmospheric absorption, path loss irregularities, etc). In 
addition, the lack of channel sounders for the EHF band needs to be dealt with, in 
order to provide metrics for the multipath (small-scale) fading.
Large-scale fading both in the microwave and mm-Wave band is still an issue 
of on-going interest and research. Whereas the site-generic rule of the log-normal 
distribution remains (with mathematical closed-form approximations alternatively 
provided by the Gamma distribution), there are challenges regarding the deriva-
tion of the shadow depth from obstacle losses, which are frequency- dependent and 
therefore demand a more focused approach when predictions are calculated in a 
wide range of frequencies. Predictions in distance need to be averaged for eliminat-
ing biased results and predictions over different topologies test the  limits of site-
generic methodology. Attenuation over distance can be employed to describe the 
excess path loss in a mathematical approximation and dB/m, as well as devices per 
square kilometer, will remain a parameter of interest in wireless communications.
As academia and industry moves toward the launching of 5G, immediate 
future work lies in the further optimization and investigation of LTE-A backhaul, 
and addressing issues related with the possible migration toward 5G as an early 
phase through the microwave backhaul solutions currently provided for the 4G+ 
congested networks in urban shadowed areas.
Regulatory and legal issues related to spectrum allocation and licensing in the 
sub-6 GHz band will have to be resolved, and immediate future work arises for path 
loss modeling in the 3.5 GHz as potential 5G microwave frequency. In addition, 
vehicular and roadside applications and scenarios for the urban environments will 
be addressed in the short-term future.
The time scope for launching 5G in 2020 is ambitious, yet feasible. Research 
internationally faces challenges and prospects as 5G strives to surpass all previous 
mobile broadband networks and lead us in the new era of wireless communications.

spectrum availability, and massive densification of small cells (Ghosh et al. 2014). 
These requirements have been envisioned for the research and development of the 
5th-generation (5G) wireless communication networks. These networks will have to 
support high capacity and massive connectivity with an increasingly diverse set of 
services, applications, and users, such as machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet 
of things (IoT), to enable communications anywhere, anytime, and by anything 
(Boccardi et al. 2014). The wireless spectrum below 6 GHz is already congested 
and will not be enough to meet these future requirements. Therefore, there has 
been growing interest in moving up frequency into millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) 
bands, between 30 and 300 GHz, where a tremendous amount of bandwidth is 
available. Furthermore, the advancement of semiconductor technology has made 
mm-Wave cellular systems feasible (Rappaport et al. 2011). Candidate frequency 
bands for the deployment of 5G networks are: the 28 GHz band (27.5–29.5 GHz), 
the 38 GHz band (36–40 GHz), the 60 GHz band (57–64 GHz), the E-band 
(71–76 GHz and 81–86 GHz), and finally, the W-band (92–95 GHz) (Ghosh et al. 
2014). The communication scenarios of the 5G networks include outdoor as well as 
indoor users, which will be realized on the basis of the aforementioned mm-Wave 
frequency bands, as shown in Figure 3.1. Therefore, various communication links

are foreseen that include: (1) links from macro-to-macro cell base stations, that is, 
backhaul links; (2) fronthaul links between a macro-cell base station and the sta-
tion of a small cell; and (3) radio access links for the end users (outdoor-to-outdoor 
and indoor-to-indoor), as also indicated in Figure 3.1.
More specifically, for an outdoor scenario and for access or fronthaul links, 
the frequencies of 28 or 38 GHz will be employed for the system operation, while 
for the indoor users (implementing the so called femto-cellular hotspots) the 60 or 
70 GHz band will be considered. The 60 GHz band can be also utilized for short-
range outdoor hotspots (up to 50 m). Finally, for the backhauling network archi-
tecture, the most probable frequency bands to be used are between 70 and 90 GHz.
The development of cellular networks in the mm-Wave band imposes significant 
challenges, which necessitate a rigorous assessment. Therefore, it is vital to under-
stand the propagation channel characteristics across all the proposed mm-Wave fre-
quencies in order to perform a precise and consistent system design. The propagation 
scenarios and models would incorporate fixed and mobile access users, indoor and 
outdoor environments, as well as line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) 
links. Due to the higher free-space loss at mm-Wave signals in respect to the conven-
tional systems currently operating up to 3 GHz, proportional increase in antenna 
gains with appropriate beam forming will be required. Another important issue is 
that mm-Wave signals can be severely susceptible to shadowing resulting in outages, 
rapidly varying channel conditions and discontinuous connectivity (Akdeniz et al. 
2014). This is more concerning especially in urban environments where NLOS links 
will be also deployed.
The first research studies and measurement results for mm-Wave frequencies are 
reported in Xu et al. (2000), Rappaport et al. (2013a), and Rappaport et al. (2013b), 
and have shown that outdoor access links up to 200 m are viable and will be able 
to provide the appropriate bandwidth for the realization of the next- generation cel-
lular systems. The fact that the cell size decreases, assists in the improvement of 
system’s throughput and capacity, as the spatial frequency reuse will be lower. The 
propagation characteristics in the mm-Wave band include the fading due to local 
environment and the atmospheric effects. The latter imposes significant challenges 
to the signal transmission, which due to the very small wavelength introduces severe 
attenuation and link outages, especially in the upper part of the mm-Wave region. 
Aside from the rain attenuation, the atmospheric effects incorporate the oxygen and 
water vapor absorption, fog, and amplitude signal scintillation due to turbulence. 
The local fading effects include multipath propagation, as well as the shadowing 
effects and free-space loss. Furthermore, the vegetation attenuation and the building 
penetration are very important in the design of such links because the introduced 
attenuation is much higher compared to the frequencies up to 3 GHz. Therefore, all 
of the aforementioned mm-Wave propagation characteristics and effects are vital to 
be assessed and modeled, leading toward a reliable network design.
In this chapter, the current propagation trends of the mm-Wave frequencies 
toward 5G mobile communication systems are thoroughly studied and presented. 

72 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
State-of-the art channel models, derived from the latest measurement cam-
paigns, concerning various propagation scenarios and architectures are assessed. 
This chapter will mainly emphasize on channel models that describe the fading 
effects due to local environment, and less on the fading phenomena due to the 
atmosphere. Therefore, attention will be given especially in models that charac-
terize the large and small scale fading effects of the mm-Wave channel, taking 
into account alternative propagation characteristics, and conditions. In addition, 
models that describe the spatial and temporal variations of the mm-Wave channel 
will be provided. The recent advances of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) 
and massive MIMO technology exploitation in mm-Wave propagation will be 
also investigated. Finally, future directions regarding the propagation and channel 
model prediction for 5G millimeter wave mobile communication systems will be 
proposed.
3.2 Advances in Millimeter-Wave Propagation
3.2.1  Overview of Research Activities 
in mm-Wave Propagation
There are several studies and measurement campaigns in the mm-Wave frequen-
cies for wireless communications systems, dating back to 2000 that give valuable 
information for the future design challenges. In Xu et al. (2000), a wide-band 
measurement campaign has been performed on three outdoor point-to-point 
(P2P) links at 38 GHz. The purpose was to examine the effects of various weather 
events such as rain and hail on the behavior of the mm-Wave link. Multipath 
statistics showed that while very few multipath components were detected in 
clear, dry weather, multipath components were increased during rain events. It is 
also found that Rician K-factor (direct-to-scattered power ratio) depends on the 
point rainfall rate according to the linear relationship K = 16.88−0.04R, where 
K is the Rician factor (in decibels) and R is the rain rate (in mm/h). It can be 
observed that when the rain rate increases, either the power of the LOS com-
ponent decreases, either the scattered power increases, or both. However, two 
possible explanations have been proposed, one is the increase of multipath due to 
the scattering on hydrometeors or due to the changes in the electrical properties 
of surfaces due to rain drops. Apparently, the proposed relationship combines the 
local multipath with the atmospheric effects and is usable for determining system 
outage probabilities.
Propagation measurements using steerable antennas were performed in 
Rappaport et al. (2012, 2013a), also at 38 GHz, considering an outdoor urban cel-
lular, and pedestrian walkway scenario. The specific experiment uses a variety of 
elevated transmitters that represent typical 5G base-station locations at heights of 
two or more stories above ground level, and various ground-level receiver locations. 

Advances in Millimeter Wave Propagation for 5G Mobile ◾ 73
It is found that the elevated transmitters at heights of two to eight stories above 
ground require 60° of scanning (up to ±30° off-boresight) in the azimuth direction 
to cover nearly all possible NLOS links. The Rx antenna, however, would benefit 
from larger scanning freedom. A NLOS link is rarely preferred over a LOS or par-
tially obstructed LOS link, as NLOS links tend to have 10–50 dB more path loss 
and higher expected root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread. Nevertheless, when the 
LOS component is completely blocked by a building or other shadowing objects, 
the results showed that a reflection, scattered, or diffraction path may still have suf-
ficient power to be received, although at a lower level. Hence, for mm-Wave systems 
using beam-steering antenna arrays, in case of a blocked LOS path, the beam will be 
steered until the strongest NLOS link is identified. Almost all of the LOS links have 
near free-space path loss and no RMS delay spread (mean values on the order of 1 ns), 
whereas NLOS present higher RMS delays (mean values between 13.7 and 14.8 ns). 
Another interesting result is that many distinct paths can be formed in NLOS and 
LOS channels using narrow-beam antennas. By picking the best combination of Tx 
and Rx antenna pointing angles at any location, path loss and RMS delay spread can 
be substantially reduced. However, while NLOS paths may be formed in mm-Wave 
channels, they will require equalization and will have greater propagation latency, 
higher power consumption, and lower data rates than LOS channels (Rappaport 
et al. 2012). It is also important to note that for both the high and low base-station Tx 
locations, no outages were observed for all random measurement locations within a 
200 m cell radius, suggesting that mm-Wave systems could work best in dense urban 
environments with small cell deployments within that range.
Extensive mm-Wave measurement results, for cellular 5G systems, are pre-
sented in Azar et al. (2013), Samimi et al. (2013), and Rappaport et al. (2013b), 
where outdoor point-to-multipoint measurements were carried out in a dense urban 
environment using steerable antennas at 28 GHz. In a dense urban environment 
such as New York, the path loss exponent was found 2.55 for LOS locations, but 
increases up to 5.76 in NLOS cases. Multipath delay spread is found to be much 
larger in dense cities, due to the highly reflective nature of the dense urban envi-
ronment. The measured data show that a large number of resolvable multipath 
components exist in both LOS and NLOS environments, with observed multipath 
excess delay spreads as great as 1388.4 ns and 753.5 ns, respectively (Azar et al. 
2013). From the angular resolved measurements it is found that dense cities are a 
multipath-rich environment, and that an average of 2.5 signal lobes exists at any 
Rx location. Each lobe has an average angle spread of 40.3°, and an RMS angle 
spread of 7.8°. The small scale fading is negligible and about ±2 dB about the mean 
power level over a 10 λ distance (Samimi et al. 2013). The widely diverse spatial 
channels observed at any particular location suggest that mm-Wave mobile com-
munication systems with electrically steerable antennas could exploit resolvable 
multipath components to create reliable links for cell sizes on the order of 200 m. 
In addition, outdoor materials exhibit higher penetration losses in urban build-
ings and signals cannot propagate through, thus indoor networks will be totally

isolated from outdoors, which advocates the installation of data showers, repeaters, 
and access points for handoffs at entrances of commercial and residential buildings 
(Rappaport et al. 2013b). Additional measurements at 28 GHz were performed in 
an urban environment in Daejeon, Korea, for NLOS conditions, where steerable 
antennas were used (Hur et al. 2015). After post-processing the angular received 
power, the omnidirectional measurements were synthesized for mm-Wave chan-
nel modeling. The NLOS path loss exponent was found 3.53, whereas from the 
spatio-temporal analysis the channel can be modeled with an average number of 
3.62 clusters, with an RMS and subpath delay spread values of 22.29 and 5.45 ns, 
respectively. Finally, similar types of measurements at 28 GHz were carried out 
in Ko et al. (2016). Two different environments were examined. An open space 
stadium (having LOS conditions) and an urban ski-resort town (preserving NLOS 
characteristics). The measurement system utilizes steerable antennas at both Tx and 
Rx, but the omnidirectional results were synthesized for further processing. The 
spatio-temporal analysis showed that the mm-Wave LOS channel is modeled with 
2.69 clusters and an RMS delay spread of 2.75 ns, whereas the NLOS links can be 
characterized by 5.33 clusters, and an RMS delay spread of 60.41 ns.
The license-free band at 60 GHz (providing a spectrum width of up to 7 GHz) 
has been considered promising, foreseen either for short range indoor communica-
tions, or for short-range outdoor cellular mobile multi-Gbps systems (Rappaport 
et al. 2012). Comparative measurements between 38 and 60 GHz, regarding an 
urban peer-to-peer scenario, revealed that the 60 GHz channel experiences notably 
more path loss, smaller delay spreads, and fewer unique antenna angles for creating a 
link (Rappaport et al. 2012). The mean RMS delay spread was found 23.6 and 7.4 ns 
at 38 and 60 GHz, respectively, considering NLOS links. However, very low mean 
values (much lower than 10 ns) were observed in LOS cases at both frequencies. 
Apparently, the very small wavelength of the signals at 60 GHz band constitutes the 
propagation quasi-optical in nature with most of the signal power received through 
the LOS, and first- and second-order reflections (Maltsev et al. 2010). There is an 
extensive research especially for indoor 60 GHz radio channels where a femto-cellular 
architecture will be adopted, providing high data rate services for densely populated 
buildings, carrying many times more traffic than current systems (Anderson and 
Rappaport 2004). Indoor cell sizes are on the order of 50 m, therefore, the oxygen 
attenuation has no impact and can be neglected (Moraitis and Constantinou 2004). 
Likewise, reliable outdoor access links will be created for similar cell radii.
Polarization measurements in an indoor conference room at 60 GHz channel have 
shown that a mismatch of polarization characteristics of Tx and Rx antennas can result 
in a large degradation of the received signal power between 10 and 20 dB (Maltsev 
et al. 2010). Furthermore, measurements in the exact same environment (Maltsev 
et al. 2009), using steerable antennas, have shown that the 60 GHz channel is formed 
by five distinct clusters. One path (LOS or a reflected path) constitutes a single cluster, 
and the scattered rays inside one path comprise an intra-cluster structure, which sta-
tistical characteristics include the average number of rays, ray arrival rate, and a power 

Advances in Millimeter Wave Propagation for 5G Mobile ◾ 75
decay rate. Actually, the intra-cluster parameters of a single cluster define the delay 
spread or the frequency selective characteristics of the propagation channel.
Comparative indoor channel measurements at 60 and 70 GHz in four differ-
ent environments, using a steerable antenna only at the Tx, were carried out in 
Haneda et al. (2015) where the spatio-temporal characteristics of the channels were 
derived. The results showed that the dominance of the LOS and specular propaga-
tion mechanisms is more apparent in open indoor environments such as large shop-
ping mall and railway station, than in office environments. In addition, 70 GHz 
radio channels suffer from higher losses of both specular and diffuse components 
than at 60 GHz and show faster power decay as the propagation delay increases.
Indoor wideband measurements at 60  GHz, using directional antennas, 
showed that the RMS delay spread varies from 12.34 to 15.04 ns in corridors and 
from 12.56 to 21.09 ns inside laboratory environments (Moraitis and Constantinou 
2006). Another convenient way is to describe the mm-Wave channel as a tapped 
delay line. Tapped delay line models for 60-GHz channels are proposed in Sawaya 
and Clavier (2003) and Moraitis and Constantinou (2006), where the channel can 
be represented with six or four taps, respectively. In both cases the proposed tap 
delay line models are derived on the basis that the channel preserves wide-sense 
stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) characteristics. Furthermore, from 
wideband measurements in Xu et al. (2002), conducted in different indoor office 
environments at 60 GHz, it was found that when the receiver antenna is point-
ing into different directions, the delay spread is in the range of 7.5–76.46 ns for 
hallways and 10.89–41.01 ns for rooms. When the receiver antenna is fixed, the 
delay spread is significantly smaller. Typical ranges are from 4.6 to 47.3 ns in the 
hallways and from 4.7 to 33.9 ns in rooms. The angular distribution of multipath 
power is briefly characterized by angular spread. Angular spread results in Xu et al. 
(2002) showed dependency on the examined environment. Measurement results 
show that the angular spread ranges from 0.36 to 0.78 for hallway measurements, 
0.62–0.84 for room measurements, from 0.63 to 0.81 for indoor NLOS propaga-
tion, and 0.12–0.49 for outdoor measurements with few nearby obstructions. These 
measurement results show a clear increase of the angular spread from the least clut-
tered outdoor environments to obstructed NLOS indoor environments. Additional 
angular spread measurements were conducted in Moraitis et al. (2011), where for 
room LOS conditions (either laboratory or residence) the angular spread takes large 
values indicating that multipath comes from different directions. This is attributed 
to the heavy cluttered environment where lot furniture is present in the propaga-
tion channel. In residential environments the angular spread was found between 
0.81 and 0.89 in LOS locations, and between 0.41 and 0.45 in NLOS locations, 
respectively (Moraitis et al. 2011). Nevertheless, sophisticated measurement and 
modeling of angle-of-arrival (AOA) is required to allow optimization of beam steer-
ing requirements and algorithms.
Indoor and outdoor measurements at 73-GHz band were performed in 
MacCartney et al. (2015a, 2015b) and Rappaport et al. (2015). Increased values of 

76 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
path loss exponent were observed in indoor environments at 73 GHz, having values 
of 3.1 and 5.7, for LOS and NLOS conditions, respectively. On the other hand, very 
low values of RMS delay spread were obtained, where the mean values do not exceed 
12.1 ns in both LOS and NLOS cases. The low delay spread values can be attributed 
to the increased path loss in the specific frequency band. Outdoor 73 GHz experi-
ments in Manhattan, New York, showed a path loss exponent of 2.3 and 4.7, for 
LOS and NLOS links, respectively. The results corroborate the fact that when direc-
tional antennas are used, the LOS channel provides virtually no delay spread values. 
Maximum RMS delay spread values in LOS cases were found between 1.2 and 
1.5 ns, whereas in NLOS urban links the maximum observed delays are between 
30.3 and 48.5 ns. The aforementioned delay values are smaller than these observed 
in 28 GHz band, due to the more reflective environment of Manhattan and greater 
energy being scattered at lower mm-Wave frequencies. Wavelengths at 73 GHz are 
smaller than 28 GHz, giving rise to more diffuse scattering during propagation, 
which results in weaker path not detectable at the Rx (Rappaport et al. 2015).
Special care, in designing indoor mm-Wave systems, should be taken in case 
of a human presence and motion in the wireless channel. Both transmission and 
diffraction effects are very small especially in the 60 and 70 GHz bands due to its 
quasi-optical nature, a human body constitutes a practically insurmountable obsta-
cle and produces attenuation values around 22 dB when the human is inside the 
direct LOS path (Moraitis and Constantinou 2004). Measurements in Colloge et al. 
(2004) showed that when the direct path is shadowed by a person, the attenuation 
generally increases by more than 20 dB, for a median duration of about 100 ms for 
an activity of 1–5 persons and 300 ms for 11–15 persons. Globally, the channel is 
unavailable for about 1% or 2% of the time in the presence of one to five persons. In 
addition, from experiments in Cassioli and Rendevski (2014), for the 54–59 GHz 
and 61–66 GHz bands, respectively, was observed that the induced shadowing by 
human bodies varied between 12 and 25 dB, whereas was statistically modeled by 
the truncated second order Gaussian mixture model (GMM) (Jacob et al. 2011). 
The GMM was developed on the basis of a ray tracing procedure for the human 
blockage, where the human body is represented by a multiple knife-edge diffraction 
model (Jacob et al. 2011). The experimental results from the latter work manifest 
that the influence of a person induced shadowing phenomena that may exceed 
35 dB. The RMS delay spread increases from 2.6 ns in LOS situations to 6.5 ns 
when human blockage occurs.
Finally, the presence of many persons moving at various speeds up to 1 m/s, results 
in a Doppler spread of about 800 Hz and, equivalently, a coherence time of about 
1.25 ms (Smulders 2009). This is the absolute lower limit that might be approached 
when omnidirectional antennas are used. Measurements in Moraitis and Constantinou 
(2004), where people walked along the LOS path while not obstructing it, with a 
maximum walking speed of 1.7 m/s, revealed a minimum coherence time of 32 ms 
which is, indeed, much higher than the aforementioned limit. The channel dynamics 
preserved slow fading behavior characterized as quasi-wide sense stationary.

Advances in Millimeter Wave Propagation for 5G Mobile ◾ 77
To conclude, taking human mobility into consideration, mm-Wave links are 
intermittent. Therefore, maintaining a reliable link for delay-sensitive applications 
would be a challenging task for mm-Wave communications. Applying appropriate 
beamforming techniques in indoor environments alternative paths could be used to 
preserve a consistent connection when the LOS path is blocked by human presence.
3.2.2 Material Characteristics in mm-Wave Frequencies
A consistent planning and design of future mm-Wave wireless networks requires 
a thorough knowledge of the common building material characteristics such as 
reflection and penetration loss (induced attenuation). Initial reflection and pen-
etration measurements were conducted at the frequency of 38  GHz (Xu et  al. 
2000). The results revealed a 25.5 dB penetration loss through a double-pane, tem-
pered, and tinted window glass. Furthermore, controlled reflection measurements 
on glass and brick surfaces showed that the specular reflection can increase as 
much as 6.8 dB when the surface is wet, which constitutes wet exterior surfaces 
highly reflective. Significant penetration losses of up to 17 dB were also observed 
through a dense canopy of an oak tree, corroborating vegetation attenuation as a 
crucial parameter for a proper link budget analysis, averting outdoor access link 
outages. Attenuation measurements for various material types were carried out in 
Moraitis and Constantinou (2004) for an indoor office environment at 60 GHz. 
The  results  showed that the   induced attenuation depends significantly on the 
thickness of the material. Indoor soft partitions such as plywood panels or simple 
glass, introduce a 6 and 3.5 dB attenuation, respectively, which renders NLOS 
propagation feasible for very short distances (up to 10–15 m, and up to four inter-
vening partitions). For greater distances and higher number of intervening partitions 
the introduced isolation makes intra-room communication impossible, giving rise to 
the single-cell-per-room network configuration (Anderson and Rappaport 2004). 
On the other hand, exterior materials such as brick walls showed a high attenua-
tion of up to 48 dB, constituting indoor-to-outdoor links beyond reality, isolating 
indoor mm-Wave hotspots. In addition, reflection and penetration loss measure-
ments at 28 GHz, for common building materials, were conducted in Rappaport 
et al. (2013b). Comparing the results for indoor and outdoor materials, the latter 
presents a higher reflection coefficient of 0.986 for tinted glass, and 0.815 for con-
crete, as compared to clear nontinted glass and drywall, which have lower reflection 
coefficients of 0.740 and 0.704, respectively. The highly reflective external building 
materials can enhance outdoor signal coverage, and allow a wide range of possible 
angles-of-arrival to create Tx–Rx links in outdoor environments. The results showed 
that the typical exterior surface of urban buildings such as tinted glass or brick pil-
lars exhibits high penetration loss that could reach 28.3 and 40.1 dB, respectively. 
This indicates that building penetration of mm-Waves will be extremely difficult 
for outdoor transmitters, thus providing sufficient isolation between outdoor and 
indoor networks. On the contrary, typical indoor materials at 28 GHz such as clear 

78 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
nontinted glass and drywall only have 3.6 and 6.8 dB of losses, respectively, which 
are relatively low. Therefore, the high penetration loss through outdoor building 
materials and low attenuation through indoor materials suggest that RF energy can 
be contained in intended areas within buildings, which reduces cochannel inter-
cell interference, yet making outdoor-to-indoor penetration difficult (Rappaport 
et al. 2013b). Table 3.1 summarizes the penetration losses for various material types 
derived by measurement campaigns in the mm-Wave frequencies.
The aforementioned measurement results revealed that is infeasible to achieve 
indoor coverage from outdoor base stations, as buildings are almost impenetrable 
from outdoor access links. In that case, relays and repeaters will likely be used to 
achieve indoor-to-outdoor coverage, or else outdoor mobile users will need to hand-
off into the indoor network (perhaps unlicensed spectrum or reused mm-Wave 
spectrum) as a user enters a building. Furthermore, indoor-to-outdoor penetration 
is also impractical in mm-Wave frequencies, isolating effectively indoor hotspots. 
In general, the lower penetration loss of indoor materials in conjunction with 
the reflective and high loss outdoor materials (brick walls and glass) helps reduce 
interference between indoor and outdoor mm-Wave networks, suggesting a high 
 frequency reuse.

3.2.3 Large Scale Channel Models in mm-Wave Frequencies
For link budget and interference calculations, path loss as a function of propagation 
distance is fundamental for system coverage and interference analysis and design 
(Rappaport et al. 2015). In order to predict the path loss, various empirical models 
have been proposed and will be described in the following. The first model is the single 
slope or close-in (CI) free-space reference distance path loss model that incorporates a 
path loss exponent which has physical relevance, as path loss is tied to the free-space 
loss at a specific reference distance (usually 1 m is convenient and practical at mm-
Wave frequencies) (Ghosh et al. 2014). The modeled path loss (in decibels) is given by

where:

Xσ is the shadow fading term, which is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with 
a given standard deviation, σ (i.e., the shadow factor in decibels) that represents the 
large-scale fluctuations originating from shadowing by large obstructions in the 
wireless channel (Rappaport 2002). In Equation 3.1 the free-space path loss at a 
reference distance d0 is given by

The CI model is a fundamental large scale path loss model, whereas n is derived 
from a best fit in a minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense over all the mea-
sured data. Table 3.2 summarizes the path loss exponent and shadowing factor 
results for the CI model, derived from a wide range of measurement campaigns, 
considering all the candidate frequency bands for the next-generation mm-Wave 
networks. As it is evident the path loss exponent is highly dependable on the mea-
surement environment and propagation condition, where in the majority of the 
LOS links the exponent is found close to 2.0. On the other hand, in NLOS situ-
ations the path loss exponent can reach up to 5.76 in dense urban environments.

Rx antennas, can also be utilized through the use of 3D ray-tracing algorithms and 
network capacity simulators.
An alternative path loss model is the floating intercept (FI), or alpha-beta 
model, used in the WINNER II and 3GPP standards. The FI model has no physi-
cal reference, but simply fits the best line to the measured data. This model has the 
following form (Sun et al. 2016a):

where:
α is the intercept in decibels
β is the slope, both determined via a MMSE fit to the measured data
Xσ is the shadow fading term
In Equation 3.3, β cannot be assumed to be the same as the path loss exponent n 
because it is floating, has no physical meaning or frequency dependence, and sim-
ply serves as a value of slope that provides the best fit to the data. The advantage 
of this model is that minimizes the standard deviation (in other words the mean 
square error fit to the data) but its drawback is that different researchers cannot 
directly derive intuitive information from the two model parameters. Both CI and 
FI models are usable to characterize mm-Wave channels either in LOS or NLOS 
propagation conditions. Nevertheless, for path loss channel modeling, it is prefer-
able to use the CI model as it has a simpler form and a physical meaning, as well 
as the benefit of having an agreed-upon standard that is usable with reasonable 
accuracy across many environments, scenarios, and frequency bands.
Table 3.3 lists the parameters of the FI model (α, β, and σ) obtained after a 
MMSE fit to the measured data, considering alternative measurement campaigns, 
mm-Wave frequencies and propagation environments. As previously mentioned, 
parameter β has no physical meaning, and according to the results introduced in 
Table 3.3, cannot be correlated with path loss exponent.
A multifrequency three-parameter model that aims to predict large-scale path loss 
as a function of both frequency and distance is the alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) model. 
The predicted path loss in decibels is expressed as follows (MacCartney et al. 2015a):

The ABG model is an extension of the FI model for multiple frequencies, 
and reverts to the FI model if only a single frequency is used (when γ = 0 or 2). The 
ABG model is solved in a MMSE sense by simultaneously solving for α, β, and γ.
Table 3.4 summarizes the basic parameters of the multifrequency ABG model, 
considering alternative environments and propagation conditions for a wide frequency 
range. According to Sun et al. (2016b), the ABG model presents a difference in shad-
owing factor between −0.1 and 1.2 dB, compared to the CI model, which indicates 
the good approximation that succeeds.
A recent path loss model also suitable for multifrequency modeling is the close-
in free-space reference distance with frequency-dependent path loss exponent (CIF) 
path loss model. The CIF model is considered as a general form of CI, and is given, 
in decibels, by (Sun et al. 2016a):

f0 is a fixed reference frequency that serves as the balancing point of the linear 
frequency dependency of n, and is based on the weighted average of all

If data from only one frequency are used, then b = 0, and the CIF model simplifies

CIF model, considering alternative environments and propagation conditions for 
a wide frequency range. In the majority of the cases, parameter β in CIF model 
was found almost zero. In cases where β is slightly positive, indicates that path 
loss increases with frequency beyond the first meter of free-space propagation 
(Sun et al. 2016b).
The CI and CIF models incorporate a close-in, free-space anchor point (d0) 
that guarantees that the path loss model (regardless of transmit power) always 
has a physical connection to the transmitted power over distance. On the other 
hand, FI and ABG models use a floating constant based on a fit to the measured 
data, without consideration for the close-in, free-space propagation that always 
occurs in practice near an antenna out in the open. This implies that particular 
measured path loss values could greatly affect FI and ABG model parameters, 
as there is not a physical anchor to assure that close-in free-space transmission 
occurs in the first meter of propagation from the transmit antenna (Sun et al. 
2016b).
Coverage distances in 5G networks will be much shorter when utilizing mm-
Wave frequencies. Furthermore, in future small cells, base stations are likely to be 
mounted closer to obstructions (Rappaport et al. 2013b; 2015). Consequently, the 
d0 = 1 m reference distance, used in CI and CIF models, is a proposed standard 
that ties the true transmitted power or path loss to a convenient close-in distance. 
Standardizing to a reference distance of 1 m makes comparisons of measurements 
and models simple and provides a standard definition for the path loss exponent, 
while enabling perception and quick evaluation of large-scale path loss. According 
to Rappaport et al. (2015), emerging mm-Wave mobile systems will have very few, 
or no users at all, within a few meters of the transmit antenna, as the base stations 
will be mounted on rooftops, lampposts, or indoor ceilings. Users in the near field 
will have strong signals or will be power controlled compared to typical users much 
farther from the Tx such that any path loss error in the near field will be negligible, 
and so much smaller than the dynamic range of signals experienced by users in a 
commercial system.
Another path loss model that is applicable for NLOS street canyon environ-
ments is provided by ITU-R, Recommendation P.1411-8 (ITU 2015). The specific 
model considers that the dominant NLOS obstruction in street grid is the corner 
transition and the path loss is calculated according to:

and w1 is the street width at the transmitter’s side. From Equations 3.8 and 3.9, 
the NLOS path loss is parameterized by Lcorner, dcorner, and β, which values, for 
the frequency band below 16 GHz, are suggested as 20 dB, 30 m, and 6, respec-
tively, in an urban environment (ITU 2015). This model was developed, based 
on measurements at frequency range between 2 and 16 GHz, and has been used 
in many applications as a standard. An extension of ITU-R P.1411-8 model up 
to 28 GHz is presented in Lee et al. (2016). Measurements were conducted at 
28 GHz, in an urban district of Seoul, which is an area composed of rectangular 
flat street grids with skyscrapers and 54 m wide streets. Fitting the path loss 
model parameters, Lcorner, dcorner, and β to the measured data, minimizing the 
mean square error (MSE), the predictions were found to be in a good agreement 
with measured data for Lcorner = 24.59 dB, dcorner = 30 m, and β = 3.65. The 
MSE was found 4.83 dB, verifying the good applicability of the ITU-R NLOS 
model at 28 GHz.
Finally, a combined path loss model that is applicable in both LOS and NLOS 
situations is presented in Moraitis and Panagopoulos (2015), where measurements 
were performed in different indoor environments at 60 GHz (including offices, 
hallways, and residences). The specific model takes into account the additional 
loss induced by the intervening partitions between the Tx and Rx. The path loss 
expressed in decibels is given by

90 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
where:
n is the path loss exponent
PLFS(d0) is the free-space path loss given by Equation 3.2
Xσ is the shadow fading term
The NLOS part of the expression considers the number, ki, of the intervening parti-
tions, as well as the attenuation factor, Fi, of the specific partition (penetration loss 
of the material). Specific values of material penetration losses can be selected from 
Table 3.1. In LOS situations it is plausible that ki = 0 in Equation 3.10. On the 
other hand, in NLOS conditions the model is applied considering the excess loss 
introduced by the intervening partitions and fitting the model in a MMSE sense to 
find the path loss exponent. For example in NLOS cases, in the residential environ-
ment, the excess losses were between 24 and 44 dB (Moraitis and Panagopoulos 
2015). In addition, it is interesting to note the differences in the shadowing factor 
between furnish and unfurnished residences where in the latter case increased val-
ues were observed. In general, the NLOS version of Equation 3.10 fits very well to 
the measured data obtaining standard deviations on the order of 4 dB.
3.2.4 Small Scale Channel Models in mm-Wave Frequencies
Small-scale fading represents the fluctuations in the received signal over short, sub-
wavelength receiver distances and is physically explained by the coherent phasor 
sum of many random multipath components (MPCs) arriving within the measure-
ment system resolution (Rappaport 2002). Actually, the sum of the MPCs consti-
tutes the channel impulse response (CIR). It is a common assumption that CIRs 
obtained from appropriate wideband measurement systems are typically ray-like 
and can be expressed as a temporal discrete multipath model as follows:

(3.11)
where:
M is the total number of rays
am and θm are the amplitude and phase of the mth ray
τm is the delay of the mth ray
δ(∙) denotes the Dirac delta function
In Equation 3.11, am is a statistical complex expression of the path gain. The phase 
θm follows a uniform distributed random variable over [0, 2π), whereas the ampli-
tude follows a log-normal distributed random variable with standard deviation σ. 
Note that τ represents the excess delay, whereas the t-dependence represents the 
changes with time of the very structure of the impulse response. Whenever, τ = 0, 

Advances in Millimeter Wave Propagation for 5G Mobile ◾ 91
then Equation 3.11 simplifies to a narrowband channel representation. The envi-
ronment where the majority of mm-Wave measurement campaigns were conducted 
(Table 3.1) is changing much slower than the transmission rate, so that the Doppler 
effects can be neglected, that is, the time dependence in Equation 3.11 can be 
disregarded and the parameters can be treated as virtually time-invariant random 
variables. Therefore, the channel can be considered as physically stationary, exhibit-
ing wide-sense stationary (WSS) characteristics. The channel representation given 
by Equation 3.11 can be regarded as single-cluster time-of-arrival model. In order 
to determine the average power for a ray at excess time τ the average power delay 
profile (APDP) is modeled as a function of excess delay that consists of a direct 
ray, and an exponentially decaying part (linear in dB). The APDP or average path 
power gain can be expressed as (Smulders 2009):

The empirical frequency distributions of the ray inter-arrival time approximate 
very well the exponential distribution, which implies that the ray arrival process 
approximates a Poisson process (the probability density function [PDF] of ray inter-
arrivals is exponential).
A well-known discrete impulse response model that takes ray-clusters into 
account is the Saleh-Valenzuela (SV) model and can be regarded as multicluster 
time-of-arrival model. The CIR based on the SV-model is expressed as follows 
(Saleh and Valenzuela 1987):

al,m and θl,m are the amplitude and phase of the mth ray in the lth cluster
Tl is the arrival time of the first ray of the lth cluster
τl,m is the delay of the mth ray within the lth cluster relative to Tl
The SV model has been considered as a static channel model so the aforementioned 
parameters can be taken as time-invariant. According to the model the cluster decays 
exponentially and also the rays within each cluster have an exponential decay. An example

In case of L = 1 (one cluster) then Tl = 0, and Equation 3.13 simplifies to the single-
cluster form given by Equation 3.11. The cluster arrival rate as well as the ray arrival 
rate can be modeled as a Poisson process, so it is assumed that all clusters have the 
same ray arrival rate. In Equation 3.14, Tl and τl,m are characterized by using prob-
ability function of the event x under a condition y, that is, p(x|y), according to Shoji 
et al. (2009):

where σφ is the angular-spread of rays in the lth cluster. Alternatively, the angular 
distribution of the paths can also be approximated by the uniform distribution 
(Haneda et al. 2015).
Novel communication systems in the mm-Wave bands will require high gain 
directional and steerable antennas on both Tx and Rx so as to compensate increased 
path loss and create viable links with appropriate beamforming. Therefore, due 
to directionality and steerability double-directional channel models have to be 
considered that include both ray departing and arriving angular characteristics. 
A cluster-based form of the double-directional omnidirectional CIR is commonly 
used to represent the radio propagation channel between a Tx and Rx, and can be 
expressed as (Samimi et al. 2015):

 are the arbitrary 3D (azimuth and elevation) Tx and Rx 
complex amplitude antenna patterns of multielement antenna arrays, 
respectively
Consequently, the small scale fading of the mm-Wave channel can be described by 
its spatial and temporal characteristics based on Equations 3.20 and 3.21. The spa-
tial lobes model the phenomenon of spatial directionality and have been used suc-
cessfully to model the 2D and 3D spatial channels. Both 3GPP and WINNER II 
channel models do not distinguish a spatial cluster from a time cluster. They repre-
sent spatial clusters of MPCs by assigning one group of traveling MPCs to one ran-
dom AOA. From field measurements with high directional antennas it is observed 

94 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
that multiple groups of multipath clusters can arrive at the same unique pointing 
angle in azimuth and elevation but at different time delays, and hence, the spatial 
clusters are generalized into spatial lobes, where a spatial lobe can receive more than 
one traveling cluster (Rappaport et al. 2015). The multipath cluster is defined as a 
group of MPCs within a PDP for a specific Tx and Rx antenna spatial angle such 
that a cluster represents signal energy travelling closely together in time and angu-
lar space (Samimi et al. 2013). Intra-cluster statistics revealed that time clusters 
are subdivided into smaller sub-path components, whose power levels exhibit (on 
average) an exponential fall-off behavior as shown in Figure 3.2. The temporal sta-
tistics include: (1) the number of clusters in a PDP, (2) the number of MPCs within 
a  cluster, (3) the inter-arrival distributions within the cluster (extraction of 1/λ), 
(4) the cluster multipath amplitude distribution (extraction of γ), (5) the cluster 
internal (sub-path) delay, (6) the cluster inter-arrival distribution in a PDP (extrac-
tion of 1/Λ), (7) the PDP multipath amplitude distribution (extraction of Γ), and 
(8) the RMS delay spread (RDS) and mean excess delay of the PDP. Directional 
spatial statistics can be used to model the spatial directionality at both Tx and Rx 
and include: (1) the mean direction of arrival/departure of a lobe (AOA and AOD), 
(2) the angle spread (AS) denoting the angle span of a lobe above a specific thresh-
old, (3) the RMS AS (standard deviation of AS) indicating the angle span of a lobe 
in which most power is received, and (4) the number of lobes (spatial directions) for 
a particular Rx location. Additional information about the  definition and formula-
tion of the temporal and spatial parameters can be found in Xu et al. (2002) and 
Samimi et al. (2013).
All the aforementioned small-scale parameters are usually obtained using 
high-resolution joint delay-angle multipath parameter extraction procedures, 
such as SAGE (Fleury et al. 1999) and KPowerMeans algorithms (Czink et al. 
2006a). The latter provides an optimum assignment of MPCs into joint delay-angle

clusters given a desired number of clusters from multidimensional CIR data, that 
is, Equations 3.20 and 3.21, using the mathematically based, power-weighted mul-
tipath component distance (MCD) metric (Czink et al. 2006b). The optimum 
number of clusters is then determined from two optimal criteria, the Calinksi-
Harabasz and the Davies-Bouldin indices (Czink et al. 2006b).
The most significant parameter that characterizes the frequency selectivity 
(time dispersion) of the channel is RDS. Additional useful parameters are the 
total number of clusters, L, as well as the AS. Table 3.6 summarizes typical 
values of the RDS, AS and L, derived by different measurement campaigns, 
representative of various environment types. It is observed that all the listed 
parameters depend highly on the environment type, the frequency and propaga-
tion condition.
According to Table 3.6, measurements across all bands consistently show that 
when directional antennas are used, the LOS channel exhibits virtually no delay 
spread (the RDS is the width of the channel sounder’s impulse response). For exam-
ple, RDS values in LOS cases are very low (<15 ns) indicating that the mm-Wave 
link is realized mainly by the direct component that contains the majority of the 
transmitted signal energy. On the other hand, in NLOS cases additional paths are 
captured with greater delays increasing the RDS. According to Rappaport et al. 
(2013a), mean RDS also increases as the antenna angle is pointed away from LOS 
angle (i.e., boresight misalignment) between Tx and Rx. Similar findings were also 
observed in Rappaport et al. (2015) where RDS values greater than 50 ns can occur. 
From the 28 and 38 GHz measurements was found that in both cases 90% of the 
RDS values are below 50 and 40 ns, respectively.
It was also found that mean RDS decreases with increasing Tx and Rx separa-
tion distance (Rappaport et al. 2013a). This can be attributed to the fact that a 
stronger received signal is caused by one or few strong MPCs arriving at different 
specific angles. These strong MPCs dominate the RDS and motivate the use of 
mm-Wave cellular where directional low path loss links can carry very high data 
rates with small RDS. However, when the Tx and Rx antennas are steered away 
from each other at relatively close distance (e.g., <200 m), strong LOS and other 
strong multipath components are less likely, and RDS becomes much greater as 
MPCs arrive from many different scattering and reflection mechanisms. At dis-
tances beyond several hundred meters, the number of receivable MPCs reduces 
because of the propagations loss, thus creating fewer detectable MPCs and smaller 
RDS. Because RDS increases and becomes more variable as Tx and Rx antennas 
are pointed away from boresight, future mobile devices at a particular location 
should prefer a link using relatively small off-boresight antenna pointing angles 
(lower than ±30°). Finally, reaching the cell limits where the Tx, Rx separation may 
reach nearly a kilometer, the measured RDS values are very low, which requires less 
equalization. The reduced power and latency for equalization of these cell-edge 
links can be put to use in other processing areas, such as additional error coding for 
this lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) case (Rappaport et al. 2013a).

It is interesting to note the very low RDS values at NLOS situations obtained 
from 73 GHz measurements. Similar to the 28 and 38 GHz bands, at 73 GHz the 
RDS values decrease as the Tx, Rx separation distance increases, but the dense 
urban measurements do not decrease as rapidly, because of the scattering and 
reflections from large buildings (Rappaport et al. 2015). The mean NLOS RDS 
values at 38 and 73 GHz are smaller than at 28 GHz, due to the more reflective 
environment of New York and greater energy being scattered at lower mm-Wave 
frequencies (where the first meter of free-space path loss is lower). Wavelengths at 
73 GHz are extremely small, giving rise to more diffuse scattering during propa-
gation which results in weaker paths not detectable at the Rx. Time dispersion 
characteristics for indoor measurements at 73 GHz, using directional antennas, 
showed that 90% of RDS values are less than 30 ns (MacCartney et al. 2015a). In 
both 28 and 73 GHz measurements, for NLOS situations, the number of MPCs 
detected at any unique pointing angle combination between Tx and Rx, follow a 
uniform distribution over all Tx, Rx separation distances, and decreases with dis-
tance. Overall, there are more resolvable MPCs as a function of Tx, Rx separation 
distance in NLOS environments at 28 GHz compared to 73 GHz, attributed to 
stronger signals and the larger wavelengths at 28 GHz, which allow the signal to 
reflect more and scatter less. The 73 GHz signals have a smaller wavelength and 
a higher possibility of getting caught in tiny building cracks and rough surfaces, 
leading to diffusion.
Considering the cluster number, it is found that more clusters are formed in 
lower mm-Wave bands in the same examined environment (e.g., measurements at 
28 GHz yield on average 5 clusters compared to the 3 clusters derived from mea-
surements at 73 GHz in New York). Omnidirectional results from measurements at 
28 GHz in Ko et al. (2016) and Hur et al. (2015) yield 5 and 4 clusters, respectively, 
in a typical urban environment.
From the AS results it is observed that the spatial multipath distribution was 
found to be highly correlated with the site-specific environment, the operational 
frequency, and the Tx, Rx antenna beamwidths. It is interesting to note that high 
AS values (comparable to outdoor urban results) are obtained in indoor environ-
ments (Moraitis et al. 2011), where the highly reflective indoor surfaces with fully 
furnished offices accounts for this observation. In addition, very low AS values 
are presented in 73 GHz measurements, due to the narrower Tx antenna and the 
increased environmental scattering that dampens energy over a wider field of view 
(Rappaport et al. 2015). The LOS AS are on average slightly larger than the NLOS 
AS, suggesting that energy arrives in narrow lobes at the Rx, while being more dis-
tributed over space and stronger in LOS environments. Comparing 28 and 73 GHz 
measured AS results, the former exhibits larger values, designating that 28 GHz 
propagation is spatially prominent (i.e., strong MPCs come from a large number of 
angles at lower mm-Wave).
There are significant differences in the spatial properties of LOS and NLOS 
mm-Wave channels, where in NLOS environments more sharply defined power 

100 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
angle spectrum was observed, in contrast with the great azimuthal sparsity of 
power encountered in LOS situations (Rappaport et al. 2015).
Measurements in Kim et al. (2015) revealed that the directional RDS exhibited 
strong dependency on the antenna beamwidths, where wider beamwidths presented 
larger RDS values. The AS values showed similar correlation. The wider beamwidth 
the antenna has, the higher AS values are yielded. Based on the previous obser-
vations, empirical prediction models were produced that estimate for directional 
RDS and AS from a given beamwidth of antenna. The analytical models as func-
tion of antenna beamwidth, θ, can be written as

where the beamwidth range is 0° ≤ θ ≤ 120°. Specific values for the parameters a, 
and β can be found in Kim et al. (2015).
The results listed in Table 3.6 provide an insight into systems that systematically 
search for the strongest Tx and Rx antenna pointing angles that lead to low RDS 
values (so that simple equalization methods can be used). The temporal statistics for 
these strong directional beams may help define the channel matrix used to describe 
LOS and NLOS mm-Wave channels. Numerous antenna elements at both link ends 
will be used to increase the received SNR or reduce interference via beam combining 
or beamforming techniques, by combining multipath from many arriving angles and 
excess delays. It is expected that up to hundreds of miniature on-chip electrically steer-
able antennas will be used in mm-Wave devices to find the strongest multipath AOA 
at the Rx so as to improve SNR and to extend coverage distances (Rappaport et al. 
2015). A simple algorithm to find the best beam directions that can simultaneously 
minimize both RDS and path loss (finding the best paths that simultaneously have 
both strong SNR and very small multipath time dispersion) is suggested in Sun et al. 
(2014). By selecting a beam with both low RDS and low path loss, relatively high SNR 
can be achieved at the Rx using directional antennas without complicated equaliza-
tion, meaning that low latency single carrier (wideband) modulations may be a viable 
candidate for future mm-Wave wireless communications systems (Ghosh et al. 2014).
Algorithmic procedures that describe the cluster and subpath generation, based 
on the presented CIR models and spatio-temporal parameters that will help to simu-
late the measured channel, fall out of the scope of this chapter. Extensive algorithmic 
approaches can be found in Akdeniz et al. (2014), Haneda et al. (2015), Samimi 
et al. (2015), and Hur et al. (2016), where the simulated results presented great 
consistency with the measured values. In the aforementioned work, extensive and 
detailed values of the spatial and temporal channel parameters are listed, which are 
useful for developing accurate channel simulators. Representative spatio- temporal 
channel parameters that are suitable for convenient CIR generation are summarized 
in Table 3.7, derived by two different measurement campaigns at 28 GHz.

Up to now all the presented measurements consider a fixed Tx and Rx termi-
nal. It is also interesting to introduce Doppler effects in the measurements, which 
induces time-selective fading in the channel, especially for a fast moving terminal in 
mm-Wave frequencies. For example pedestrians or people inside buildings walking 
at a speed of 1 m/s induce a maximum Doppler spread of 933 Hz, at 70 GHz. This 
value may reach up to 6.5 kHz for a slow moving vehicle at 50 km/h. A generalized 
model that incorporates large- and small-scale fading is proposed in Moraitis and 
Panagopoulos (2015), where measurements between a fixed Tx and a moving Rx 
were carried out at 60 GHz in various indoor environments. The Rx was moving at 
a constant speed of 0.5 m/s with no people being present during the measurements. 
The proposed model is an extension of Equation 3.10, where the small-scale effects 
are introduced as well:

characterization of the Doppler spectra is important for the determination of 
the time-variance of the channel. Toward the modeling process of the Doppler

which is also valid for −2 fm ≤ f ≤ 2 fm. Therefore, in Y, the induced time variations 
are modeled from Equations 3.25 and 3.26, for LOS and NLOS situations, respec-
tively. According to Moraitis and Panagopoulos (2015), the small-scale variations 
in LOS trajectories follow the Rician distribution with a K-factor ranging between 
6.9 and 8.5 dB, whereas in NLOS cases the fading statistics correspond very well 
with the Rayleigh curves. For all the measured runs, the spectrum width was found 
between 390 and 420 Hz. Hence, the fading at any measured run and environment 
type is extremely slow, having a very narrow bandwidth, much narrower than that of 
practical transmitted signals, verifying the stationary of the channel. It is concluded 
that the main cause of the temporal variations is the movement of the receiver, as 
there are no moving scatterers in the channel. Finally, the average coherence time of 
the channel is found 2.6 ms, which is 0.26 times the ratio between the wavelength 
and the speed of the mobile terminal. For the envisioned high data rate applications 
at 60 GHz the calculated coherence time of 2.6 ms is very high compared to the 
symbol duration. Hence, the channel exhibits slow fading characteristics and can be 
regarded as static. Nevertheless, the induced slow fading can be mitigated by packet 
sizing and appropriate coding over the coherence time of the channel.

3.2.5 Atmospheric Effects
A very challenging task in designing mm-Wave systems is the atmospheric effects that 
due to the small wavelength of the signals exhibit severe attenuation. Apart from the 
free-space loss that is significantly increased, oxygen and water absorption may cause 
excess loss especially in the region of 60 GHz. Furthermore, mm-Wave links that 
will operate outdoors are also limited by the rain, where the droplets both scatter and 
absorb the incident waves, leading consequently to signal attenuation and link outages.
First, taking into account the effects due to atmospheric gases, oxygen mole-
cules and water vapor mainly contribute to excess attenuation in the mm-Wave fre-
quencies. Figure 3.3 presents the specific attenuation in dB/km due to atmospheric 
gases, for frequencies between 10 and 300 GHz. The curves have been derived 
from the attenuation models provided in ITU (2012a). There is peak of oxygen 
attenuation at 60 GHz that reaches 11.6 dB/km, which renders long-range out-
door links very difficult to deploy. For frequencies below and above 60 GHz (i.e.,

104 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
28–38 GHz and 70–90 GHz), there are regions which can be exploited for out-
door signal transmission. For example, at 28 or 38 GHz, the additive oxygen and 
water vapor attenuation is lower than 0.1 dB/km, whereas in the frequency region 
between 70 and 90 GHz the attenuation will not exceed 0.6 dB/km, as shown in 
Figure 3.3. Therefore, according to Figure 3.3, atmospheric attenuation for outdoor 
small cells is virtually negligible. As urban small cells will be designed for inter-site 
distances within 200 m (for backhaul, fronthaul, and access links), air attenuation 
will be of little concern (Ghosh et al. 2014). In case of outdoor and indoor access 
links at 60 GHz, which will be deployed within a range of up to 50 m, the impact 
of air attenuation is also insignificant (Moraitis and Constantinou 2004).
Second, apart from the oxygen and water absorption, rain attenuation has a det-
rimental effect on the link quality in the mm-Wave frequencies. For example, the 
averaged attenuation in a hailstorm was measured to be 25.7 dB over a 605 m path at 
the frequency of 38 GHz (Xu et al. 2000). According to DeLange et al. (1975), a rain-
fading margin of 40–42 dB would be required to meet a reliability objective of less 
than 5 min. outage per year (a probability of 10−5) on a 1-km path at the frequency of 
60 GHz. Other experiments at 60 GHz have shown worst case attenuations (depend-
ing on the time availability) between 5.5 and 12.5 dB, and between 6 and 28.5 dB, 
on a 250 m and 850 m path, respectively (Timms et al. 2005). Therefore, mm-Wave 
signals, especially in regions above 60 GHz, will be severely affected by rainfall, lim-
iting the range of access or backhaul links. A power-law expression between point 
rainfall rate and specific rain attenuation has been proposed in Olsen et al. (1978), 
and in conjunction with parameters defined in ITU (2005), the specific rain attenu-
ation can be calculated, taking into account various frequencies and rainfall rates (in 
mm/h). Based on these expressions, Figure 3.4 presents the induced rain attenuation 
for a 1 km path as a function of operating frequency and different rainfall rates. The 
latter parameter depends directly on the local climatological conditions. For high 
availability systems, in which the outage probability must be less than 0.01% of time, 
the rainfall rate may exceed very high values (Kourogiorgas et al. 2016).
According to Figure 3.4, at a heavy rain rate of 10 mm/h, a 1 km link, experi-
ences a rain attenuation of 2 dB at 28 and 2.5 dB at 38 GHz. Even with a very 
heavy rainfall of 20 mm/h, rain attenuation will not exceed 5 dB. Therefore, access 
or fronthaul links at 28 or 38 GHz will be totally feasible to be deployed within a 
radius of 200 m, as also proposed in Rappaport et al. (2013b). On the other hand, 
outdoor hotspot access links at 60 GHz will have to be limited within a range of 
50 m in order to minimize outages and provide consistent services. In general, 
proper link design (e.g., with varying gain antennas) could account for rain margin 
in future mobile mm-Wave cellular systems (Azar et al. 2013).
Finally, other atmospheric effects include hydrometeors that constitute fog, as 
well as amplitude signal scintillation due to turbulence; factors that could also dete-
riorate outdoor link’s performance. The attenuation due to fog depends on the liquid 
water density of the fog and the operating frequency of the link. According to ITU 
(2012b), the specific attenuation for a light fog is less than 5 dB/km for frequencies 

Advances in Millimeter Wave Propagation for 5G Mobile ◾ 105
between 20 and 90 GHz and can be neglected for small mm-Wave cells. The impact 
of atmospheric turbulence is significant, and if not considered properly, amplitude 
scintillation may affect the performance of a low-power margin communication 
system. Nevertheless, measurements in Cheffena (2010), for long-range links (up 
to 5.6 km) at 42 GHz, have shown a small signal variation, which constitutes the 
impact of turbulence insignificant for short-range outdoor mm-Wave links, and can 
be neglected as well.
To conclude, the most vital parameter among all the atmospheric effects, for 
the proper design of next-generation mm-Wave networks, is rain attenuation. 
Consequently, local rainfall patterns must be considered to ensure a reliable link 
operation; most telecommunications carriers require links to display 99.999% 
availability (i.e., downtime of less than 5 min/year). Therefore, it is important to 
model the first-order statistics of the various losses, as well as the development of 
channel models, in order to proceed to end-to-end simulations. On the one hand, 
first-order statistics in the case of atmospheric effects are crucial for the design of 
system margins and the ability to consider such margins taking into account the 
costs and the consumed power (Kourogiorgas et al. 2016).

3.3 Future Trends in Millimeter-Wave Propagation
Millimeter-wave propagation has been acknowledged as an ultimate research 
direction for the deployment of next-generation cellular systems inaugurating 5G 
networks. The main challenging task to develop such networks is the unique propa-
gation conditions encountered in mm-Wave frequencies between 28 and 90 GHz. 
The specific frequency span gives the capability to allocate ultra- wideband chan-
nels (much greater than 500 MHz) providing Gb/s rates to the users. As described 
in Section 3.2, mm-Wave channel experiences very high path loss that in prac-
tice necessitates the existence of LOS links to achieve the aforementioned rates. 
Measurement campaigns have shown very low time-dispersion phenomena in 
LOS situations (RDS lower than 10 ns). On the other hand, enough detectable 
MPCs occur in NLOS conditions (increasing RDS), even at greater Tx, Rx sepa-
rations, regardless of the fact that these components have relatively low powers. 
Nevertheless, frequency selectivity has to be considered due to the wider Rx band-
width and several strongly localized rays can be found in the angular domain. In 
case of mobile users, high Doppler spread is expected even in slow mobility due 
to the small wavelength. Apparently, the implemented physical layer transmission 
techniques must be able to operate under these extreme propagation conditions.
Millimeter-wave cellular can be realized with high-gain steerable antennas, 
which are necessary to compensate for the high propagation loss and to direct 
energy toward optimal directions that can exploit multipath and successfully com-
plete a link. Measurements have shown that NLOS links are also feasible with 
appropriate beam steering, orienting Tx and Rx antennas at the best pointing angle 
and taking advantage of the spatially separated multipath. Phased antenna arrays 
or switched-beam antenna arrays can exploit beam steering to increase link gain. 
Future smart antenna arrays, possibly on-chip, will algorithmically determine the 
optimal AOA and AOD. One possible beam steering method is to use narrowband 
pilot tones that enable the prediction of the spatial location of multipath based on 
narrowband envelope cross-correlations (Samimi et al. 2013). However, in order to 
achieve highly directional patterns, large antenna arrays are necessary.
In mm-Wave communications due to the small wavelength, the antenna size 
can be extremely small and a large number of array elements can be packed into a 
small area at both link ends, giving rise to mm-Wave MIMO concept. The applica-
tion of MIMO configuration in the mm-Wave band has been theoretically studied 
in Moraitis and Constantinou (2007) and Arvanitis et al. (2007) for an indoor 
radio channel at 60 GHz, where a MIMO channel model was proposed apply-
ing uniform linear (ULAs) and uniform rectangular arrays (URAs). The results 
showed that there is a significant fading reduction in the channel, as well as a 
capacity enhancement at the downlink that could reach up to 6–7 b/s/Hz (having 
a 64 × 64 MIMO configuration with URA antennas and 10 dB SNR). Similar 
theoretical simulations in Akdeniz et al. (2014) have shown spectral efficiencies 
between 2.6 and 3.34 b/s/Hz, and between 2.6 and 3.0 b/s/Hz, at 28 and 73 GHz, 

Advances in Millimeter Wave Propagation for 5G Mobile ◾ 107
respectively, depending on the antenna elements. In addition, MISO antenna 
configurations were adopted in Muirhead et al. (2015), where a densely deployed 
wireless network based on 25 apartment block was used as the basis of the simu-
lation model. Each base station was equipped with a beamformed ULA with 8 
elements, and a single omnidirectional antenna at the user terminal (UE). The 
median achieved capacity at 72 GHz was 9 b/s/Hz for the MISO configuration 
instead of 4.5 b/s/Hz when two omnidirectional antennas were used at both Tx and 
Rx (SISO). A comparative study in channel capacities between 2.1 and 2.6 GHz 
with 20 MHz RF bandwidth, and the 28 and 38 GHz bands with 1 GHz RF 
bandwidth was carried out in Sulyman et al. (2014). The results revealed that the 
capacity for 5G systems is over 20 times that of today’s 4th-generation (4G) systems 
(3.8 Gb/s in 5G systems against lower than 0.5 Gb/s for 4G, for a 10 dB carrier-to-
interference ratio).
Massive MIMO is also acknowledged as an emerging technology for 5G net-
works. The Massive MIMO and mm-Wave technologies provide vital means to 
resolve many technical challenges of the future wireless networks, and they can 
be seamlessly integrated with the current networks and access technologies. The 
concept of Massive MIMO is based on the use of a very large number of antenna 
elements to multiplex messages for several users. The main principle of operation 
is that the Massive MIMO antennas can focus the radiated energy toward desired 
directions while minimizing intra- and inter-cell interference, and enhancing sig-
nificantly the spectral and energy efficiency. In a rich scattering environment, these 
performance gains can be achieved with simple beamforming strategies, such as 
maximum ratio transmission (MRT) or zero forcing (ZF) (Bogale and Le 2016). 
Another critical issue in mm-Wave MIMO is to cope with the existing hardware 
constraints due to the high bandwidth and operational frequencies. Therefore, 
there is the need for hybrid precoding, which is a combination of analog and digi-
tal processing. Analog beamforming solutions are mainly based on controlling the 
phase of the signal transmitted by each antenna, but their performance is relatively 
low. In order to achieve larger gains, hybrid analog/digital processing strategies 
are proposed. The use of precoding techniques on an antenna array can be used 
to form a beam toward the receiver or even multiple beams in a multiuser sce-
nario. The aim of precoding is to suppress the cochannel interference between the 
users, which communicates at the same frequency. More specifically, in precoding 
techniques, the symbols that are to be transmitted are processed in order to mini-
mize the interference, for example, maximizing the signal-to-noise-interference ratio 
(SNIR) (Kourogiorgas et al. 2016). A common problem that arises is the channel 
state information (CSI) at the base stations, especially in case of Massive MIMO 
where the number of elements of the channel matrix is very large. The tasks of 
channel estimation and precoder extraction for the large channel matrix become 
cumbersome. Efficient ways to exploit correlations and sparsity in order to decom-
pose the complicated task must be developed and evaluated. Moreover, it is unre-
alistic to assume perfect CSI to the transmitter, therefore the effects of partial 

108 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
CSI in the Massive  MIMO transmitter must be considered. Assuming that all the 
cells were served by a single base station, as the CSI would be known at this base 
station, the intra-cell interference could be resolved. However, as there are many 
base stations there would be inter-cell interference with the fundamental problem 
that the one base station does not have the appropriate knowledge of CSI of the 
adjacent cells. The problem may be solved through the coordination of the differ-
ent base stations. It must be noted that the interference between the different cells 
strongly depends on the frequency reuse factor.
A variation of a large-scale MIMO system is the distributed MIMO archi-
tecture, unlike Massive MIMO and its centralized architecture. In distributed 
MIMO it is assumed that MIMO technology is implemented by different trans-
mitters (each one equipped with a MIMO antenna). The distributed MIMO nodes 
transmit synchronized signals to maximize spectral efficiency and system capacity 
through interference alignment. The role of mm-Wave networks in a distributed 
MIMO system can be twofold. It can be used to implement directive multipoint 
backhaul connections that are used to coordinate the distributed MIMO nodes, 
or as the radio access network technology from the base stations to the UE. In 
distributed MIMO systems, interference is turned from foe to friend, as long as 
the transmitters are all coordinated and synchronized. The development of proper 
coordination, synchronization, and precoding transmission scheme for distributed 
MIMO in mm-Wave frequencies is of great scientific value, as interference coordi-
nation may benefit from the directional beams and the propagation conditions of 
such system.
An additional problem that has to be taken into account is a proper adaptive 
modulation and coding scheme selection in order to enhance system efficiency. 
The mm-Wave channel is highly variable between LOS and NLOS situation, 
which necessitates the ability to extend modulation in each case (either to higher 
or lower order schemes). High order modulation schemes shall be used in case of 
high SNIR. On the contrary, low modulation schemes may be used (codes with 
low coding rates or symbol repetition) in order to support lower values of SNIR. 
In addition, due to the time-variant nature of the mm-Wave channel, special care 
should be given to properly select single carrier or multicarrier modulations. For 
example, OFDM is an appealing solution for spectral efficiency and equalization 
complexity, but its implementation in mm-Wave frequencies is complicated due 
to the sensitivity in high peak to average power ratio, frequency and phase shifts. 
Single carrier modulations do not present such difficulties, however the estimation 
and equalization complexity increase significantly and the spectral efficiency is also 
reduced. Therefore, the investigation of other single carrier or multicarrier schemes 
is demanding for the development of mm-Wave networks in order to define the 
best approach in terms of throughput, power efficiency, and hardware complexity.
As mentioned in Section 3.2, user mobility can affect significantly mm-Wave 
transmission because of the induced Doppler effects and its increased influence due 
to the small wavelength. Communications in the mm-Wave band may be used in 

Advances in Millimeter Wave Propagation for 5G Mobile ◾ 109
vehicular applications (vehicle-to-vehicle, small range radars, etc.). Therefore, it is 
critical to develop and assess Doppler spread and frequency offset estimation and 
compensation techniques in order to cope with the time-variant nature of the radio 
channel. The developed algorithms should be robust and able to track the frequency 
shifts through changes in direction and speed of movement, especially when using 
OFDM modulations, due to its sensitivity in phase noise and frequency offsets.
However, many additional measurements are necessary to cover all the envi-
ronments and scenarios of interest, and to develop full channel models for stan-
dards development. Therefore, based on the state of the art research, thoroughly 
described in Section 3.2, new challenges in measurement campaigns are emerg-
ing for the development of future mm-Wave wireless networks. In terms of chan-
nel characterization and modeling, novel research activity should be focused on 
outdoor and indoor channel measurements including additional environment 
types, scenarios and operational frequencies. Outdoor channel measurements 
should be performed for fixed and mobile scenarios. Additional measurements 
are required to cover the gap in some frequency bands, especially at 38 and 
60 GHz for outdoor access links. In case of fixed wireless links the 60 GHz 
band will be mostly investigated for short paths in order to avoid the high oxy-
gen absorption and rain attenuation. For mobility scenarios the investigation of 
28 and 38 GHz bands will be more sensible, due to lower atmospheric and rain 
attenuation, and lower Doppler effects. The majority of the current research is 
oriented in measurements in urban environments; therefore, alternative types 
should be examined such as light urban, suburban, and pedestrian. Access links 
through vegetation is also necessary to be taken into account and investigated. 
In addition, long-periodic measurements is vital to be performed for various 
weather conditions, as the effects due to local environment change, for example, 
in case of rain or hail. Therefore, concurrent measurements of path attenua-
tion, rain intensity, and atmospheric attenuation should be carried out, for fixed/
mobile access at the bands considered, in order to investigate the large-scale 
attenuation. Finally, additional channel measurements should be performed at 
the 70 GHz band and above, which are candidate operational frequencies for 
network backhauling.
Indoor measurements should be considered for both fixed and mobile access 
at 60 and 70 GHz, realizing the femto-cellular architecture of high-speed access 
hotspots. Extensive measurements are required, especially at the 70 GHz band, 
where additional space for the development of spatio-temporal channel models still 
exists. Furthermore, alternative environments have to be examined such as offices, 
conference rooms, and finally residences, where the current measurement attempts 
are scarce. Special attention should be given in residences where the deployment of 
mm-Wave access links is a very challenging attempt, as the specific environment 
is unique with highly reflective surfaces. It is also vital to investigate the effect of 
human motion within the wireless channel. Multipath and shadowing phenom-
ena should be carefully assessed and taken into account for designing a proper 

110 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
channel model. Finally, attenuation measurements for indoor partitions are also 
necessary including various types of materials, in order to determine the expanse of 
the indoor cells between adjacent rooms.
A remarkable trend in future outdoor and indoor measurement attempts will 
be the utilization of sophisticated MIMO channel sounders, incorporating sev-
eral antenna elements at both Tx and Rx (or even large-scale arrays), with view 
of recording all the valuable time- and angular-resolved factors, characterizing 
statistically the mm-Wave channel. Polarized MIMO measurements are also valu-
able so as to examine the polarization multiplexing capabilities of the channel. 
A requirement for the development and evaluation of mm-Wave physical layer 
algorithms is the development of a suitable channel modeling tool. Exploitation of 
radio channel measurements in the mm-Wave bands can be performed with the 
definition of a channel model based on stochastic and/or geometric characteriza-
tion of the measurement results. The general purpose is to model statistically the 
channel, especially in multiantenna scenarios (MIMO). It is crucial to develop 
models that will be able to characterize the small- and large-scale effects, to calcu-
late the first- and second-order statistics of the wireless channel, and to evaluate its 
spatial and temporal dispersion. In respect, the channel models must incorporate 
those attenuation factors that fade and scatter the signal due to atmospheric phe-
nomena, and vegetation. Consequently, the development of theoretical space-time 
scattering models due to local environment is required, including the modeling 
of the mobile or fixed MIMO channel according to LOS or NLOS availability. 
The discrimination of the propagation conditions is important due to the different 
natures of the propagation types and their impact on the performance of a MIMO 
system. The narrowband and wideband models must determine the positions of 
the random scatterers utilizing statistical distributions for different environments. 
In addition, the developed models will be able to evaluate the space-time cor-
relation between the MIMO subchannels, to estimate the spatial multiplexing 
efficiency, and to calculate the channel capacity.
Aside from the local propagation environment, the attenuation due to 
atmospheric effects must be modeled through statistical methods in which 
the physical properties of the phenomena must be incorporated. For the lat-
ter, meteorological measurements are obligatory. Novel analytical expressions 
of the first-order statistics of atmospheric attenuation will be derived through 
the measurements for its accurate prediction in the various environments and 
conditions. Moreover, the spatial and temporal variations of rain attenuation 
will be investigated, for the adaptive techniques and spatial MIMO channel, as 
well as the cross-correlation in the temporal and spatial domain so as to imple-
ment adaptive techniques and spatial diversity, simultaneously, for alternative 
operational mm-Wave frequencies.
The final objective for the future deployment of 5G networks is a unified 
mm-Wave MIMO channel model that could distinguish different propagation envi-
ronments (e.g., indoor, outdoor), conditions (LOS, NLOS, or both), and scenarios 

Advances in Millimeter Wave Propagation for 5G Mobile ◾ 111
(fixed or mobile). This model will be able to separate the space and frequency 
domains of the channel and include the space-time correlation of the slow and fast 
fading, the dual-polarized MIMO radio channel, and finally the spatial MIMO 
channel. The ultimate target is to develop an empirical model for the mm-Wave 
MIMO channel that will combine both local environment and atmospheric effects.
3.4 Conclusion
In this chapter, the current advances of the mm-Wave propagation toward the 
 realization of the future 5G mobile wireless networks were thoroughly studied 
and presented. State-of-the art channel models, derived from the latest available mea-
surement  campaigns, concerning various propagation environments and conditions 
were assessed. The envisaged 5G systems will utilize mm-Wave bands for outdoor and 
indoor communication, alternative cell types (e.g., macro-cells, small-cells and femto-
cells), and different links (e.g., backhaul, fronthaul and access radio links). The large-
scale path loss models and multipath time dispersion characteristics presented here 
will be important for mm-Wave channel modeling and may assist in the deployment 
of future mm-Wave systems. The presented large-scale path loss models were assessed 
from extensive measurement campaigns, and new multifrequency path loss models 
were introduced for use across the entire mm-Wave spectrum. In addition, models and 
statistics that describe the spatial characteristics of the mm-Wave were also provided.
It is very important to develop models that will incorporate local environment 
effects (e.g., multipath and path loss) and atmospheric effects. These models will 
be based on measurements across the entire candidate mm-Wave spectrum inves-
tigating additional operational frequencies, propagation scenarios, and environ-
ment types. It is also necessary to perform MIMO channel measurements with 
view of recording all the valuable time- and angular-resolved factors, characterizing 
statistically the mm-Wave channel. To conclude, the ultimate goal is to develop 
an accurate empirical model for the mm-Wave MIMO channel that will incorpo-
rate various propagation conditions and combine local multipath and atmospheric 
effects. The development of accurate mm-Wave channel models is a demanding but 
challenging task for the scientific community, which will support the implementa-
tion and pave the way for the 5G mobile wireless networks.

In modern communication systems, the sufficient knowledge of the channel behavior 
and its induced impairments on the transmitted signal are vital for the sophisticated 
design of advanced mitigation techniques. Fading is a complicated phenomenon 
that can severely affect the signal propagation in fixed and mobile wireless com-
munication systems. However, its stochastic and highly varying nature makes it very 
difficult to model the associated channels precisely. Research efforts over the years 
have led to various statistical models for fading channels, which depend on the radio 
propagation environment and the communication scenario under study.
The negative impact of fading on signal transmission can be summarized in two 
major effects: the distortion of the signal due to intersymbol interference (ISI) and 
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty in the error performance compared to the 
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. These problems need to be effi-
ciently tackled in order to guarantee robust communication with high availability. 
Diversity schemes can improve the transmission reliability by proper utilization 
of multiple communication channels with different characteristics. Interestingly, 
diversity has been proved to be one of the most common and efficient techniques 
for combating the detrimental effects of fading, interference, and error bursts for 
over a century now in the history of wireless systems.
The main purpose of this chapter is to introduce the fundamental concepts 
of fading and diversity, mainly in a qualitative way. A more detailed presentation of 
these subjects can be found in many textbooks, articles and dissertations in the

literature, such as [1–10] and references therein. This chapter also provides a detailed 
historical investigation on the roots of the fading phenomenon and the evolution 
of the various diversity techniques since the beginning of the wireless communica-
tions era. To this end, profound evidence of critical works, either not known to the 
research community or even uncited in the context of wireless communications, are 
given. Finally, more than 15 different pure concepts of the diversity are recorded 
here for the reader’s ease, serving as a high-level taxonomy of the versatile diversity 
techniques that can be employed, either alone or in combination, by wireless com-
munication systems to improve their error performance.
The organization of the chapter is as follows. The first half provides the basic 
theoretical tools for the analysis of fading, including its nature and types as well as 
the most commonly used statistical models. The impact of fading on signal trans-
mission is also analyzed, focusing on time and frequency selectivity. In the second 
half, the chapter elaborates on fading mitigation and continues with a complete 
high-level classification of the diversity techniques proposed in the entire period 
of the twentieth century, which exploit various dimensions or degrees of freedom 
(DoF)s, such as space, frequency, time, and polarization, among others.

4.1 Nature and Types of Fading
Consider a communication channel between a source S and a destination D, where 
the former intends to deliver an information message to the latter through the 
available wireless medium. Typically, not a single radio propagation path will exist 
between S and D due to the presence of various objects and structures surround-
ing either or both. These obstacles provide alternative paths for the electromagnetic 
wave propagation through different mechanisms that can generally be attributed 
to reflection, diffraction and scattering. As a consequence, radio waves travel along 
diverse paths and arrive at D from several directions with various delays and after 
experiencing different attenuations. Thus, the multipath nature of the medium 
introduces time spread in the information-bearing signal transmitted through the 
radio channel. In addition, time variations in the structure of the medium or exis-
tence of relative motion between S and D induce extra phase shift on the multipath 
components due to the Doppler effect.

Basics on the Theory of Fading Channels and Diversity ◾ 121
Taking into account the characteristics of the time-variant multipath channel, 
the received signal r t
( ) at D can be considered as a superposition of a large number 
of phasors,* let us say Lp, with time-varying amplitudes a t

For the sake of clarity, noiseless transmission of an unmodulated carrier is initially 
considered, while the complete version of the received signal, r t
( ), will be treated in 
Section 4.3.2. In addition, the model in Equation 4.1 describes a discrete multipath 
channel, whereas in the case of a continuum of multipath components (i.e., diffused 
multipath), the sum has to be replaced by an integral.
4.1.1 Small and Large Scale Fading
The multipath channel model described earlier implies that the received signal r t
( ) 
may be viewed as a complex-valued stochastic process with random amplitude and 
phase in both time and space domain, the latter defined by the set of all possible 
locations of D. In a more intuitive approach, the associated multipath components 
may add constructively or destructively at different time realizations, so that the 
composite signal received by D may experience distortion, strength fluctuation or 
both. This is the result of signal fading caused by the channel impulse response 
(CIR), that can be classified into major categories based on the nature of the physi-
cal medium, the distance between S and D, and the transmitted symbol rate.†
From the definition of fading, it is clear that when a received signal experiences 
fading during transmission, both its envelope (i.e., amplitude) and phase fluctuate 
over time. However, in most communication system scenarios, the receiver (Rx) 
is able to perform coherent detection, that is to reconstruct the carrier with perfect 
knowledge of the phase and frequency, and proceed further with complex conju-
gate demodulation. Therefore, it can generally be assumed that the phase variation 
† We generally assume, excluding the spread spectrum systems, that the transmitted symbol rate 
ρs is approximately equal to the inverse of the signal bandwidth W , namely ρs
W
≈1/
.
* The subscript  in r t
( ) indicates the equivalent lowpass signal of the real bandpass signal r t
b( ), 
also called the complex envelope of r t
b( ). For more details, see Section 4.3.

122 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
due to fading does not affect the error performance of the system, since the channel 
phase can be perfectly tracked at the Rx. It follows that performance analysis of 
digital communication systems mainly requires the knowledge of the fading enve-
lope statistics, such as those given in Section 4.1.2, that widely define the type or 
distribution of the fading process.
Simply put, the rapid fluctuations of the instantaneous received signal strength 
over small travel distances or short time intervals, caused by the time-variant mul-
tipath channel,* result in the so-called envelope fading or more officially termed small-
scale fading effects. This type of fading is relatively fast and is therefore responsible for 
the short-term signal variations. It is assumed to be a wide-sense stationary random 
process in time.† Depending on the nature of the radio propagation environment, 
there are different models describing the statistical behavior of the multipath fad-
ing envelope, the most common being the Rayleigh (1880), Nakagami-q or Hoyt 
(1947), Nakagami-n or Rice (1948), and Nakagami-m (1960). In the context of 
mobile communications, small-scale fading can result in signal power variations of 
up to 30–40 dB for a mobile movement of just a fraction of wavelength, while higher 
speeds can cause the mobile to pass through several fades in a small period of time.
However, as the Rx moves away from the transmitter (Tx) over much longer 
distances, the average signal power will gradually decrease as a result of the large-
scale fading effects. Definitely, the most typical representative of channel impair-
ments that fall within this category is the free-space path loss, a factor involved in 
the well-known Friis equation, for the case where there is a clear and unobstructed 
line-of-sight (LOS) path between the Tx and Rx. Nevertheless, this is a rather 
simplistic model since, in a real mobile radio channel, propagation is generally 
neither free space nor LOS. To this end, generalized measurement-based path loss 
models exist in the literature, where the path loss exponent can take values up to 4, 
as opposed to 2 for the free-space model. In addition, several empirical models have 
been obtained by curve fitting experimental data, two of the most popular being 
the Okumura-Hata (1968, 1980) and Lee (1985). Finally, in typical mobile radio 
channels, the mean signal level (or local mean) experiences slow variations over 
distances of several tens of wavelengths due to the presence of large buildings, hilly 
terrain and foliage. This phenomenon is known as shadow fading or shadowing and 
is usually modeled as a multiplicative and, generally, slowly time-varying random 
process. Experimental observations have confirmed that the shadow fades follow 
a Lognormal distribution for various outdoor and indoor environments (see, for 
instance, [11] and references therein).
* Even the spatial variations in the received signal due to the mobility of D can be observed by 
the latter as temporal variations while moving through the multipath field.
† It is recalled that a wide-sense stationary random process has the property that its mean value 
is constant and its autocorrelation function is invariant to any time shift.

4.1.2 Statistics and Modeling of Fading
It has already been discussed that, in a multipath fading channel, delayed ver-
sions of the transmitted signal can be received by reflection, diffraction and/or 
scattering, where each component corresponds to an appropriate channel fading 
coefficient. As will be seen in Section 4.3, fading has a multiplicative effect 
on the transmitted signal (see for instance Equation 4.53), while, for narrow-
band systems, the faded signal can be simply modeled by the product of a 
single fading coefficient and the complex envelope of the transmitted signal 
(see Equation 4.62). Under these assumptions, the envelope and phase of the 
noiseless received signal are actually the envelope and phase of the linearly 
modulated transmitted symbol by the fading coefficient. However, it has been 
proved that knowing the statistics of just the fading envelope is sufficient for 
the performance analysis of wireless communication systems [3, Sec. 2.1.1].* 
Therefore, in the sequel of this section, the envelope statistics of the most popu-
lar fading channels will be outlined. Note that, over the years, several models 
have been adopted to describe the statistical behavior of the fading envelope, 
each with different flexibility and complexity determined by the nature of the 
radio propagation environment.
4.1.2.1 Rayleigh Fading
Rayleigh fading is the most commonly used statistical model in wireless commu-
nications. Interestingly, Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt) derived and applied 
this distribution to the theory of sound [12] long before the understanding of 
multipath signal reception. In a Rayleigh channel there exists no LOS compo-
nent and the fading coefficient, h, is modeled as a zero-mean circularly-symmetric 
complex Gaussian random variable (RV) with variance var

† The symbol C in CN( )
⋅,⋅ denotes that random samples (here snapshots of the fading channel) 
are both circularly-symmetric and complex. Additionally, it is known that circularly- symmetric 
complex jointly-Gaussian random vectors are completely determined by their covariance 
matrix [13], which for the (complex) scalar case reduces to the variance.

In order to measure the severity of the experienced fading, Charash [14] introduced 
a metric called amount of fading (AF), which, according to [3, Sec. 1.1.4], can be 
used as an alternative performance criterion in the more general context of systems 
with arbitrary combining techniques and channel statistics. The AF metric is quan-

4.1.2.2 Rician (or Nakagami-n) Fading
If there exists a strong LOS component along with many random weaker ones, the 
channel fading coefficient has a non-zero mean value. In this case, the fading enve-
lope follows the Rice distribution that was first derived by Rice [15]. Its basic param-
eter K, called Rician factor, denotes the average power ratio of the LOS component 
to all the other multipath components, where increasing K implies decreasing fad-
ing severity conditions. In the telecommunications literature, the Rice distribution 
is also known as Nakagami-n distribution with PDF given by [16, eq. (50)]

The Hoyt model was originally proposed by Hoyt [18] and was further investigated 
by Nakagami (1960) in his effort to approximate Nakagami-m for certain values 
of m. Apart from cellular mobile radio systems, this type of fading channel is com-
mon in satellite links affected by strong ionospheric scintillation. The PDF of the

4.1.2.5 Generalized Gamma (or α
µ
−) Fading
The generalized Gamma distribution was originally proposed by Stacy [20] as a 
purely mathematical model in which some statistical properties of a generalized 
version of the Gamma distribution were investigated. In this sense, it was con-
nected neither with any specific application nor with any physical modeling of any 
given phenomenon. Generalized Gamma was recently revisited by Yacoub (2007), 
under the name α
µ
− distribution, with its parameters being directly associated 
with the physical properties of the propagation medium of a fading channel. The 
generalized Gamma or α
µ
− distribution includes several other distributions as 
special cases, such as the Gamma, Nakagami-m, Exponential, Weibull, one-sided 
Gaussian, and Rayleigh [21], while fading conditions for values of m < 0.5 can also 
be modeled. The PDF of the fading envelope is [22, eq. (1)]

As mentioned earlier, generalized Gamma can describe a great variety of small-scale 
fading and shadowing conditions by adopting different values for the two param-
eters β and m. Indicatively, for β = 2  and m =1 the Rayleigh fading channel model 
is obtained, while the Nakagami-m can be derived for β = 2  and m > 0.5.

4.1.2.6 Lognormal Shadowing
In the case of large-scale fading and assuming that the multipath effects are some-
how eliminated, shadowing is the only phenomenon affecting the performance of the 
communication system. As mentioned in Section 4.1.1, empirical measurements have 
confirmed that the shadow fades can be modeled by a Lognormal distribution. In this 
case, the PDF of the instantaneous SNR per symbol, γ, is given by [3, eq. (2.53)]

In practical situations, the AF in Lognormal shadowing is bounded by a number

ous sections by several orders of magnitude [3, Sec. 2.2.2].
4.1.2.7 Generalized-K Composite Fading/Shadowing
Shadowing results in random rather than deterministic average received power lev-
els, while in many communication systems it has to be encountered along with 
small-scale fading. The combined effect of small and large-scale fading can be mod-
eled by various distributions, which are derived by the combination of one distribu-
tion for the fading envelope and another one for the local mean.
The Generalized-K  distribution was introduced by Shankar [24] as a general-
ized fading/shadowing channel model, combining the Nakagami-m fading and 
Gamma shadowing models. It is general enough to include as special cases (or 
approximate well) other distributions. For this composite channel, the PDF of the 
fading envelope is given by [25, eq. (1)]

approaching the Rayleigh-Lognormal composite fading/shadowing channel model. 
In addition, as k →∞ it approximates Nakagami-m, while, for m k

Generalized-K  fading channel approaches AWGN (i.e., no-fading case).

4.1.3 Historical Roots of Fading
The fluctuations in the received signal strength over time and distance were noticed 
very soon after the first transatlantic transmission, accomplished by Marconi in 
1901. Long ago in 1902, Marconi drew attention to the remarkable difference in 
the strength of signals received by day and by night, and his observations have been 
repeated and recorded by many other observers [26]. It is very interesting to reproduce 
below some selected excerpts from the weekly published issues of the “Electrical World 
and Engineer” periodical of that period, which reveal that the signal intensity variation 
in long distance transmissions was very early reported by experts and not, though any 
kind of explanation for this paradox was unable to be provided by that time:
Atmospheric conditions assuredly play an important part here, and it 
is a common experience of transatlantic travel to find the wireless not

working satisfactorily, while at times remarkable results are achieved. 
At moderate range most of the difficulties seem to disappear.
—Elec. World Eng., vol. XL, no. 20, Nov. 15, 1902; 
under the column “Long distance wireless telegraphy”
These long-distance feats are tantalizing in their uncertainty. Messages 
might be received on one day and the next day, for no apparent rea-
son, might fail to have any accurate effect on the receiving apparatus.... 
It is thought that long distance experiments are useless for practical 
purposes.
—Elec. World Eng., vol. XL, no. 20, Nov. 15, 1902; 
under the column “Telegraphy, telephony and signals”
In the wireless service on the transatlantic steamers there has been 
beautiful success in picking up passing neighbors at long range, but 
there have also been lugubrious failures in reaching the land stations at 
very moderate distances.
—Elec. World Eng., vol. XL, no. 23, Dec. 6, 1902; 
under the column “Round the world by wireless”
However, it seems that it was not before 1910s that first in-depth discussions on this 
phenomenon and possible explanations appear in the literature. In one of these very 
early works published in 1911, Taylor uses the term freak  communications (or freak 
signals) to refer to variations in the range of communication (or  signal strength) 
occasionally occurred by day, which are much more pronounced  during the night 
hours [27]. His broader explanation attributes this phenomenon to “ variations 
in the transmitting efficiency of the atmosphere” adding that “ perturbances in 
this respect exhibit almost the same characteristics of irregularity as atmospheric 
impulses.” In  order to highlight the importance of this  phenomenon, Taylor 
remarks that “the sudden veiling or obscuring of distant signals together with the 
equally sudden ‘opening out’ of signals observed whilst listening on the receiver at 
a wireless station during the prevalence of this phenomenon is very impressive.” 
Nevertheless, Commander Loring had some doubts about the explanation given 
previously [28]:
The prevalence, or otherwise, of atmospherics does not appear to bear 
any relation to the appearance of freak signals. At any rate, atmospher-
ics have been reported by reliable observers to be least noticeable at 
periods of freak ranges.

permission of the Institution of Engineering & Technology.

Basics on the Theory of Fading Channels and Diversity ◾ 131
In the following years, systematic observations and recordings took place with regard 
to variations of the radio range or signal strength in several wireless links. Indicatively, 
Marriott [29] presented a record of the most interesting range variations observed at 
the Manhattan Beach station of the United Wireless Telegraph Company, located at 
Coney Island in New York City. His measurements indicated that there were more 
freaks in the month of August than in the winter months, namely the ranges showed 
a greater percentage variation in the summer than in the winter. Marchant (1915) 
summarized measurements made mainly between stations in Liverpool and Paris 
regarding fluctuations in the strength of wireless signals during sunset and night 
hours, taking into account the weather conditions over the period of one year. Among 
others, Marchant concluded that (1) the sunset effect, (i.e., the strengthening of the 
signal just after sunset) occurs about 3/4 hr after the actual time of sunset and varies 
with the weather conditions, whereas under rainy conditions it is much less marked 
and (2) the freak signals are relatively great during night and occur within the space 
of a few minutes, while greater increases in signal strength can be observed after 
the cessation of rain either at the transmitting or receiving station [26]. In the same 
context, Austin (1915) studied the seasonal variation in strength of signals sent from 
radio stations in the Philadelphia and Norfolk navy yards via observations made for 
over two years. His findings, among others, experimentally verified that winter sig-
nals in general are stronger than those of summer, especially when the transmission 
takes place overland, while, “contrary to the ideas previously held, there seems to be 
no very marked connection between rainfall and the transmission of the signals” [30].
From the aforementioned published works, it can be easily observed that during 
the first two decades of the wireless telegraphy era,* there was considerable confusion 
in understanding the actual effects of fading on signal transmission and even more dif-
ficulties in providing accurate explanations for its genesis. With this in mind, the terms 
freak communications/signals/ranges were actually related to the long ranges that could 
be covered by low-power shortwave radio transmitters at certain times and places, a 
phenomenon which is well-known today as skywave or skip propagation. However, in 
these early works, the so-called freaks were sometimes unintentionally confused with 
the large-scale fading effects.† Very interestingly, it was in 1913 that the radio pioneer 
(and engineer of the Federal Telegraph Co.) De Forest officially coined the term fading 
for the first time to describe the fact that during a station-to-station transmission from 
Los Angeles to San Francisco, being 350 miles apart, two waves differing only 5% in 
length (3260 and 3100 m, respectively) were received with great variations in their 
intensity over certain time intervals, sometimes observing even total extinction of the 
one or the other but very rarely of both simultaneously [34].‡ In order to give some 
* Inventor and entrepreneur Marconi had actually established radio communication links span-
ning as far as the English Channel (la Manche) since the early 1890s [31].
‡ This first occurrence of the term “fading” in the literature was also reported by Burrows [35].
† Note that, the first consolidated results on “shadowing” appear in the literature several years 
later, in [32,33].

132 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
explanation for this paradox, De Forest adopted an existing speculative theory about 
the possible interference of the direct wave with the reflected ones from the upper con-
ducting layer of the atmosphere, thus giving the birth to multipath fading reasoning. 
The next parts from this seminal work are very illuminative.
The duration of this fading effect is often several hours after nightfall; 
then it suddenly vanishes and thereafter both waves have their normal 
intensity. This alteration of intensity is sometimes for one wave, and 
sometimes for the other, and rarely for both. Under such conditions 
there are acting at the receiving stations two trains of waves, which have 
travelled over paths of unequal lengths or which have travelled with 
unequal velocities. Consequently, there will be a phase displacement 
between them and interference at certain localities… it would account 
for the fact that the Marconi transatlantic stations can operate some-
times with a few kilowatts and sometimes require 125 to 600 kilowatts.
—De Forest.  1913 IEEE. Reprinted, with permission, from [34].
In 1916, Taylor and Blatterman published a very interesting paper related to noc-
turnal transmission experiments carried out by radio stations in University of 
North Dakota and Washington University in St. Louis as an attempt to test the 
interference theory of fading effects. In this work, the term swinging appears for the 
first time to denote slow variations in signal strength. Particularly, they stated that 
there seem to be two kinds of fluctuations in nocturnal overland transmission; a 
rapid fading and a slow swinging in signal strength [36]. In the discussion section 
of the same paper, some plausible explanations for these two channel oddities are 
also provided.
The first (refers to fading) may be due to changes, in the nature of inter-
ference effects. These could be local at the sender or at the receiver, or 
they might be caused by rather sharp surfaces of discontinuity almost 
anywhere between the stations... The second (refers to swinging) or 
slower effect may be due to refracting masses of moving ionized air in 
the path of transmission, producing at times a lens-like concentration 
and at other times a dispersive effect.
—Taylor and Blatterman.  1916 IEEE. Reprinted, with 
permission, from [36].
In the coming years, the understanding of the cause and effects of fading or 
swinging on radio signal transmission proved itself to be one of the most elu-
sive problems faced by both radio engineers and amateurs. As the radio art was 

Basics on the Theory of Fading Channels and Diversity ◾ 133
progressively moving from spark telegraphy into continuous wave telegraphy and 
radio telephone broadcasting, any empirical or scientific contribution on the pecu-
liarities of the wireless transmission medium and the possible ways to improve the 
message quality at the receiving end became matters of common interest. As a 
consequence, these issues occupied much space in the academic and public press, 
an example for the latter given in Figure 4.1 that depicts the headline and part of 
the body of a 1922 article on signal swinging, published in a major daily after-
noon newspaper. During that period, another term, that is, soaring, appears in the 
literature to describe the radio signal variations in the same context. Particularly, 
Pickard [37] mentions that the terms fading, swinging, and soaring were com-
monly used interchangeably to refer to the large amplitude short period variations 
of radio signals. 
In the meantime, radio amateurs were among the first to perform large-scale 
experiments on fading and long-distance shortwave communication even from the 
early 1910s [31], thus having already obtained valuable experience. However, due to 
the plethora of variables involved in radio transmission, any conclusions regarding 
fading could be considered safe only after being corroborated by a large number of 
observers. To this end, Whittemore and Kruse from the U.S. National Bureau of 
Standards suggested a giant initiative involving extensive experiments by radio ama-
teurs. The so-called Fading Tests took place during 1920–1921 with 243 receiving 
stations from North America producing thousands of records [31]. The results, after 
being analyzed by the Bureau of Standards, were finally published in [38], mainly 
validating the long-standing belief that fading at short wavelengths is more serious 
than at long ones. However, historical investigations, carried out by Yeang (2004) 
revealed that “the claims associated with atmospheric conditions did not lead to a 
theory of fading. Nor was the conclusion very credible to the experiments at the 
bureau” [31].

4.2 Impact of Fading on Signal Transmission
4.2.1 Multipath Spread and Frequency Selectivity
It has been mentioned that multipath causes small-scale fading due to interference 
of two or more versions of the transmitted signal that arrive at the Rx at slightly 
different times. The detrimental effects of multipath can be better realized through 
the delay power spectrum or multipath intensity profile of the channel, which gives the 
average power output of the channel as a function of the time delay τ. Particularly, 
the range of τ values over which the delay power spectrum is essentially nonzero 
is defined as the multipath spread Tm of the channel. Therefore, if the signaling 
interval T  is smaller than Tm, then the channel introduces ISI since the replicas 
of the neighboring transmitted signals interfere with the one received over the 
current interval. Equivalently, the Fourier transform of the multipath intensity 
profile defines the spaced-frequency correlation function, which provides a measure 
of the correlation between two samples of the channel response taken at different 
frequencies. A critical parameter of this function is the coherence bandwidth Bc of 
the channel that indicates the frequency range over which the fading process is 
highly correlated.*
Therefore, if the signal bandwidth W  is greater than Bc, then the spectral com-
ponents of the transmitted signal are affected by different amplitude gains and 
phase shifts across the band. Under these conditions, that is, W
Bc
>
 or equivalently 
T
Tm
<
, the channel is said to be frequency-selective and the signal is severely dis-
torted. However, if the signaling interval is selected to be greater than Tm, then the 
channel introduces a negligible amount of ISI. Likewise, if the bandwidth is smaller 
than Bc, all the frequency components of the signal undergo the same attenuation 
and phase shift in transmission through the channel. In this case, that is, W
Bc
<
 
or equivalently T
Tm
>
, the fading is said to be frequency-nonselective or flat and 
the multipath components of the channel are not resolvable, thus having a time-
varying multiplicative effect on the transmitted signal.
4.2.2 Doppler Spread and Time Selectivity
The rapidity with which the CIR is changing with time is related to the Doppler 
power spectrum that gives the power profile as a function of the Doppler frequency λ. 
Particularly, the range of λ values over which the Doppler power spectrum is essen-
tially nonzero is defined as the Doppler spread Bd of the channel.† Since the time 
variations in the CIR are evidenced as a Doppler broadening, it follows that a 
large value of Bd characterizes a rapidly changing channel. Equivalently, the inverse 
Fourier transform of the Doppler power spectrum defines the spaced-time correlation 
* The coherence bandwidth of the channel is related to the multipath spread by B

† The Doppler spread of the channel is sometimes called fading rate.

function, which quantifies the correlation between two samples of the channel 
response taken at different time instants. A critical parameter of this function is the 
coherence time Tc of the channel that indicates the period of time over which the fad-
ing process is highly correlated. Since the reciprocal of Bd is a measure of the chan-
nel coherence time, the Tc parameter gives strong evidence of the rate at which the 
channel attenuation and phase shift change over time due to the nonstatic nature of 
the environment.
Therefore, a channel with a large Doppler spread compared to the signal band-
width is also characterized by a small coherence time with respect to the signaling 
interval. In this case, that is, W
Bd
<
 or equivalently T
Tc
>
, the transmitted signal 
undergoes time-selective or fast fading. In the dual case, if T  is selected to be smaller 
than the coherence time, that is, W

 or equivalently T
Tc
<
, the channel attenu-
ation and phase shift can be considered fixed during at least one signaling interval, 
thus giving rise to time-nonselective or slow fading.
4.2.3 Characterization of Wireless Channels
The adverse effects of signal fading, if not mitigated, can significantly degrade the sys-
tem’s performance, resulting in nonreliable or even no communication during deep 
fades, a phenomenon called outage. Before referring to the versatile ways to tackle the 
problem of fading, it would be very useful to first classify the fading channels that arise in 
practice and highlight the different impact they have on signal transmission. Following 
a top–down approach, small-scale and large-scale fading are the main phenomena 
involved in the wireless channel propagation. Although they are both experienced by 
the user(s) of the channel as temporal and spatial fluctuations in the received power, the 
degradation mechanisms behind them are different, as explained in Section 4.1. From 
now on, we will focus on small-scale fading and refer to it simply as fading.
In Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, it has been mentioned that fading channels can be 
characterized by their level of selectivity in frequency and time through the nor-
malized parameters T T
m/  and B W
d /
, respectively. While the former indicates the 
dispersion degree of the signal in time due to multipath delays, the latter provides 
a measure of the signal dispersion in frequency due to Doppler shifts. Interestingly, 
a simple yet meaningful factor, which encompasses both spread parameters Tm, Bd 
to characterize a single fading channel, is the spread factor given by T B
BT
m
d
c
c
≈
−
(
) 1, 
where intuitively the BT
c
c quantity reveals the overall coherence of the channel. 
The value of this factor is critical for the design of a digital communication system 
as it reflects the ease at which channel estimation and coherent demodulation can 
be performed, thus affecting the detection performance especially under adaptive 
transmission. By definition, a channel is said to be underspread if T B
m
d <1 and 
overspread if T B
m
d >1. This implies that, in the first case, the CIR can be easily 
measured, while in the second one, the same process becomes extremely difficult 
and unreliable, if not impossible.

 overspread channel
The necessary and sufficient conditions per channel case illustrated earlier give 
 evidence that, from a system-level point of view, the transmission charac teristics 
can  be chosen in such a way so that the dispersive nature of the channel can 
be moderated. To this end, in a frequency-selective fading channel, if the symbol rate 
ρs is decreased, the channel becomes more flat.* Correspondingly, in a  time- selective 
 fading channel, if ρs is increased, the channel varies more slowly.  However, 
the design of more realistic fading mitigation techniques comes up as a require-
ment  in  radio  applications and their consideration should definitely take into 
account the different degradation mechanisms involved in each  channel type.
For instance, in the presence of slow flat fading with no LOS path, the error 
probability is asymptotically inversely proportional to the SNR. For a given 
 quality of service (QoS) threshold, this implies a significant loss in terms of 
SNR compared to the AWGN channel, where the error probability decreases 
exponentially with the SNR. For visualization purposes, the error performance 
degradation of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase-shift 
keying (QPSK) systems due to the presence of nondispersive fading is shown 
in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. All systems are single-input single-output (SISO) and 
employ maximum likelihood detection (MLD) at the Rx. In many cases, the 
comparison with respect to the ideal AWGN (i.e., no-fading) channel reveals 
huge SNR penalties, which for typical target error rates span several tens of dB. 
The standard methodology and related techniques used to increase the received 
SNR in  wireless communication systems suffering from severe fading are pro-
vided in Sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.4.
* In this direction, narrowband signal transmission, that is, W
fc
<<
, is almost synonymous with 
flat fading conditions.

Even worse, in the case of transmission through a frequency-selective and/or fast 
fading channel, the system performance can exhibit an irreducible error-rate level, 
called error floor, due to the significant degradation induced by the ISI and/or Doppler 
spread.* In such a scenario, no amount of SNR can help achieve the desired level of 
performance, unless some forms of mitigation are first employed to reduce or even 
eliminate the signal distortion. In Section 4.4.1, a list of robust transmission tech-
niques is given for the elimination of ISI and the associated performance error floor.
4.3  Formulation of Signal Transmission over Fading 
Channels
As our analysis does not depend on the carrier frequency fc, it is mathematically 
convenient to make use of the complex baseband representation of bandpass signals 
and channels. To begin with, if s t
b( ) is the continuous-time linearly modulated 
narrowband bandpass signal to be transmitted over the wireless medium, then its 
general form can be written as [39, Sec. 2.5.2]

4.3.1 Time-Variant Multipath Channel Model

In this case, the faded signal y t

The LTV nature of the filter implies that its impulse response generally changes as

In Equation 4.49, the associative property of convolution has been invoked. It 
would be useful to mention here that the associative and distributive properties 
still hold for LTV systems, in contrast to the commutativity that is generally valid 
only for LTI systems [44]. Also, LTV systems satisfy the property of homogeneity 
of degree one [41, Sec. 6.3.1].
4.3.2 Received Signal in the Presence of Noise
In addition to the fading channel impairments, the Rx front end introduces another 
source of signal degradation. This is the noise generated by electronic components 
and devices due to the thermal agitation of electrons, which can be closely modeled 
by a stationary additive white Gaussian stochastic process with zero mean and flat 
power spectral density (PSD), a.k.a. power density spectrum, equal to N0/4 W/Hz 
for all frequencies f .† We need to mention here that, other types of additive noise 
include atmospheric noise, cosmic noise, man-made noise, and interference com-
ing from other communication systems [1, Ch. 1]. Nevertheless, in this chapter, 
only the thermal noise is taken into account, which according to the central limit 
* Note that the bandwidth of the bandpass signal is twice the bandwidth of the equivalent 
baseband.
† The PSD of thermal noise is denoted here as N0/4, instead of N0/2, for power normalization 
purposes.

Basics on the Theory of Fading Channels and Diversity ◾ 143
theorem is Gaussian distributed. In addition, thermal noise is simply character-
ized as stationary, as a wide-sense stationary (WSS) Gaussian stochastic process is 
strictly stationary as well.
As a white stochastic process cannot be expressed in terms of IQ components 
due to its wideband character, it is convenient to consider the noise process at the 
output of an ideal bandpass filter with a completely flat passband that includes 
the frequencies satisfying the inequalities |

It turns out that analysis can proceed with the establishment of the complex base-
band system model instead of the original bandpass one by employing the equiva-
lent lowpass signals and channels. In the sequel, the subscript  will be dropped 
from all complex envelopes for notational simplicity.
4.3.3 Waveform and Discrete Channel Models
We can elaborate more on Equation 4.53 by adopting the quasi-static flat fad-
ing (QSFF) channel that was firstly adopted by Foschini and Gans (1998) in 
their revolutionary work [47] and is very popular in the context of multiple-input 
 multiple-output (MIMO) and especially space-time block coding systems. This 
channel model corresponds to a special case of a slow fading environment, where 
the fading coefficients h t
l( ), l
Lp
=1,2,
,

 are assumed to be constant over a frame 
of N ∈ successive time intervals changing independently from frame to frame, 
implying that the channel coherence time Tc spans N  signaling intervals, that is, 
T
NT
c =
. In this case, inequality T
T
c ≥
 is fulfilled, thus rendering the fading chan-
nel time-nonselective.
Under these channel conditions, it is convenient to consider the associated with 
the mth transmitted block impulse response of the multipath radio channel, which 
enables Equation 4.47 to be written in terms of τ only as

This last formulation of the signal at the output of the receive filter is very useful for 
the analysis of MIMO systems, since it incorporates the analog portion of the system 
in a single chain, comprising the filter/modulator at the Tx, the noisy fading channel, 
and the demodulator/filter at the Rx. Since it represents the signal waveform relation 
from the output of the baseband IQ modulator to the input of the Rx decoder, it 
is also called waveform channel model. As described in [40, Sec. 11.2], an equalizer 
could also be part of the waveform channel. Nevertheless, the equalization proce-
dure has been intentionally omitted from Equation 4.56, since mitigation of ISI 
caused by the time-dispersive nature of the channel is not our target in this section.
Consequently, analysis will proceed with the replacement of the waveform-
based channel model by a discrete-time one, assuming either perfect equalization 
or flat fading channel conditions. We highlight that, flat fading is a valid consid-
eration under the narrowband signal transmission scenario that has been adopted 
here (see Section 4.2), whereas for the case of a frequency-selective channel, orthog-
onal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can be used to convert a broadband 
channel into a set of parallel narrowband (i.e., flat) subchannels (see Section 4.4).

θ both depend on the nature of the radio propagation environment (for 
details on the statistics of various flat fading channels, see Section 4.1.2).
4.4 Fading Mitigation Techniques and Diversity
In the system model described by Equation 4.62, N  has been interpreted as the 
number of successive time slots for the single-antenna transmission of N  consecu-
tive digital symbols, all experiencing the same fading channel conditions due to the 
QSFF model assumed. However, this transmission strategy is very vulnerable to 
fading, as each information symbol realizes just a single instance of the channel. To 
make it more clear, during a block transmission under unfavorable channel condi-
tions (e.g., deep fading), a whole set of N  information symbols is very likely to be 
erroneously detected. Severe fading also causes failure with large probability in the 
symbol detection of SISO systems defined by Equation 4.62, although in this case 
only a single symbol is corrupted by the associated fading coefficient. However, 
these open-loop configurations can bring benefits in terms of reliability if extra 
dimensions are introduced and ingeniously utilized along with the spatial one.
In order to give evidence of such a capability, suppose that every individual 
information symbol utilizes L independent channel snapshots for its transmission 
through the wireless channel. In this case, there are apparently L new degrees of 
freedom available in the system. However, a critical question that arises is how 
these can be efficiently exploited toward more reliable communication. Frankly 
speaking, there is not a unique methodology for accomplishing this goal. Instead, 
the happy medium is rather a compromise among the available resources (e.g., 
bandwidth, power, space) and the practical limitations imposed by the intended 
application.
In Section 4.2, we have already discussed the two major effects of fading on 
signal transmission, namely (a) signal distortion mainly due to ISI and (b) SNR 
penalty in the error performance with respect to the ideal AWGN case. In the 
sequel of this chapter, efficient ways to tackle these problems will be discussed, 
starting from the latter.
4.4.1 Compensation of Intersymbol Interference
The ISI caused by a time-dispersive channel can be efficiently compensated by 
equalization, OFDM, and spread spectrum techniques. In more detail, the process 
of equalization provides a means to gather the dispersed symbol energy back into 
its original time interval. To do so, the equalizer adjusts the balance between fre-
quency components, thus approximating an inverse filter of the channel. The target 
for the combination of the channel and equalizer filter is to provide a flat composite 
received frequency response and linear phase.

148 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
One of the most effective nonlinear equalization techniques is the maximum like-
lihood sequence estimation (MLSE), first proposed by Forney [48], that is typically 
implemented using the Viterbi (1967) decoding algorithm. However, in practical sce-
narios (e.g., mobile radio channels), optimal equalization techniques cannot always be 
used due to constraints on processing power. In these cases, OFDM is an attractive 
alternative that achieves the same goal by demultiplexing a data sequence into several 
streams, transmitted in parallel on different subcarriers and with sufficiently small 
symbol rates with respect to Bc, so as to consider the subchannels as flat. In addition, 
the residual ISI can be completely eliminated by the insertion of a cyclic prefix or 
guard interval, which is always larger than Tm, between successive OFDM symbols. 
It is interesting to note here that Cimini (1985) proposed and described the use of 
OFDM in mobile communications. However, the fundamental principle of OFDM is 
credited to Chang [49] who studied the simultaneous transmission of several messages 
through a linear bandlimited medium at a maximum data rate without interference.
Spread spectrum techniques can also compensate for the ISI by a different mecha-
nism which is based on bandwidth expansion, namely the transmitted signal is spread 
over a much larger bandwidth than the minimum required (i.e., the bit data rate). This 
can be achieved by the introduction of a pseudo-random pattern in the transmitted sig-
nal that is later removed at the demodulator to recover the original data sequence without 
ISI. There are two basic implementations of this technology; the direct-sequence spread 
spectrum (DS-SS) and the frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FH-SS). According to 
Scholtz (1982), frequency hopping was a recognized anti-jamming concept during the 
early 1940s, while the direct sequence followed several years later.
In more detail, in DS-SS systems, a pseudo-random sequence (PRS) of pulses (or 
chips) is impressed on the original data sequence expanding the allocated bandwidth 
by a factor equal to the number of chips per information bit, called  processing gain.* 
As the spread signal bandwidth is approximately equal to the chip rate, multipath 
components delayed by more than the chip interval can be suppressed by correlating 
the signal with the same synchronized PRS at the Rx. DS-SS is the key technology 
behind code division multiple access (CDMA), introduced by Qualcomm, Inc. in 
1989, that allows several users to share the same band simultaneously by using dis-
tinct PRS codes among different pairs.
In a different way, in a FH-SS system, the total spread bandwidth is divided into 
a large number of contiguous frequency slots. In any signaling interval, one or more 
frequency slots are pseudo-randomly selected, according to the PRS, to be occupied 
by the transmitted signal. Obviously, during this interval, the Rx must be set to the 
same PRS in order to be tuned to the proper frequency band(s) and hop to the next 
scheduled slot(s) before the arrival of multipath components.†
* Equivalently, a spread spectrum system is characterized by a chip rate that is much larger than 
the bit data rate.
† The hopping rate of a FH-SS system must be at least equal to the symbol rate.

Basics on the Theory of Fading Channels and Diversity ◾ 149
Nevertheless, in the presence of doubly-selective fading, multipath mitigation 
strategies alone cannot compensate for the error floor if not assisted by adaptive 
channel estimation and robust modulation schemes, such as noncoherent, partially 
coherent, and pilot symbol assisted modulation,* among other techniques.
4.4.2 The Concept of Diversity Gain
The next step toward reliable communication involves examining ways to reduce 
the fading-induced penalty on the SNR. This can be efficiently achieved through 
diversity, a classic and well-known concept that has been used for several decades. 
However, the term diversity is rather general and comprises the vast majority of 
fading mitigation techniques. Diversity is based on the notion that the detector 
is more prone to errors when the channel is in a deep fade. Therefore, if the Rx is 
supplied with multiple versions of the same information-bearing signal transmitted 
over independent fading channels, then the probability that all signals have experi-
enced deep fading will be considerably reduced. In other words, if L is the number 
of independent fading channels utilized for the transmission of the same signal and 
p is the probability that any signal will fade below some critical value, then pL is 
the probability that all replicas will fade below that critical value.
From another standpoint, diversity has the effect of steepening the rate of 
descent of the error probability Pe( )
γ  versus the average SNR, γ. Particularly, in 
the high SNR regime, the term diversity order is used to define the negative slope of 
Pe( )
γ  curve on a log–log scale, namely 
 
d
Pe

( ) 
(4.63)
By definition, a system is said to achieve full diversity if the diversity order d is equal 
to the number of independent channel realizations (i.e., d
L
=
). In this context, 
a full-diversity scheme is able to exploit all the available DoFs in the direction of 
decreasing the error probability for a given average SNR and spectral efficiency, 
while a system with no diversity is characterized by d =1. In order to reveal the 
intuition behind Equation 4.63, let assume an 1× N  single-input multiple-output 
(SIMO) maximum ratio combining (MRC) system employing a 16th order quadra-
ture amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation and MLD at the Rx. The fading 
channel is considered to be slow flat Rayleigh with unity average fading power, that 
is, Ω=1 (see Section 4.1.2.1). The average symbol error rate (SER) performance of 
the system with respect to the average SNR per symbol is shown in Figure 4.4 for 
various values of N , namely for N =1,2,
,10

. We first select a relatively high SNR 
value, for example 50 dB, and measure the corresponding θN  angles for all N . Then, 
the slope of each SER curve at SNR equal to 50 dB is given by definition from −θN . 
* Analysis of pilot symbol assisted modulation was initially provided by Cavers (1991) for flat 
Rayleigh fading.

150 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
The graphically-based values for the diversity order can be derived by making use of 
Equation 4.63 or equivalently by dgr
slope

tan(
). The calculated values are shown 
in Table 4.1 and obviously they are very close to the expected ones, that is, d

The benefit of diversity on the system error performance can also be quanti-
fied through the related term diversity gain, which determines the improvement 
in the average received SNR obtained at a given error probability using some form 
of diversity. Very often, the terms diversity order and diversity gain are used inter-
changeably in the literature to define the increase in the slope of the error rate. 
However, the distinct definitions coined previously for the two terms are more 
common [50]. Interestingly, in the high SNR limit, the error probability can be 
approximated by P

determines the average SNR shift (in dB) of the Pe( )
γ  curve relative to a benchmark 
transmission scheme [51].
In Figures 4.5 and 4.6, the performance of SIMO MRC communication sys-
tems in terms of average SER is illustrated for several values of the diversity order d. 
In all cases, QAM is employed at the Tx and MLD at the Rx, while the fading 
channel is assumed to be slow flat Rayleigh. Given that SIMO MRC are full-
diversity schemes, the diversity order is always equal to the number of deployed 
antennas at the Rx. It can be easily observed that, for a giver error probability, 
increasing the diversity order implies substantial diversity or equivalently SNR 
gains, which are translated to essential savings in the required transmitted power. 
This great advantage has been exploited for several decades now in the uplink of 
wireless networks where the design of the Tx is often subject to fabrication and/or 
power limitations.

4.4.3 Tracing the Roots of Diversity
It is very common in the literature to trace the roots of diversity back to 1940s 
or even early 1950s, probably due to the plethora of diversity receivers proposed 
during that period, whereas just a few works point out related techniques emerged 
in 1930s in the context of wireless telegraphy; just to mention the seminal work 
of Beverage and Peterson (1931) that gives implementation details of some com-
mercial transceiver systems employing three different principles of diversity [52]. 
An early rack installation of diversity equipment is shown in Figure 4.7a, which 
illustrates a double rack holding diversity apparatus for two circuits. In 1931, the 
Riverhead receiving station of R.C.A. Communications, Inc., contained twenty 
such racks, providing facilities for forty circuits in total. These racks were arranged 
back to back facing aisles with four circuits per aisle. Ordinarily one man was tak-
ing care of the circuits in an aisle. Figure 4.7b presents the end view of an aisle.  
However, the diversity concept was known several years before. Particularly, 
Eckersley [53] gives a detailed diagram, reproduced in Figure 4.8, of an Rx appa-
ratus employing one horizontal and six vertical polarized aerials placed in a line at 
right angles to the station ray about 12 ft above the surface of the earth. These were 
connected by phasing coils consisting of vertical lecher wires approximately ( / )
1 4 λ  in 
length, λ being the wavelength. The Rx was coupled through a cable to the central 
lecher wire. This special arrangement was used in a series of tests carried out during

the winter of 1927–1928 to compare the relative fading on the two types of aerials, 
aiming to design a polarization diversity system (see Section 4.4.4.4) through partic-
ular combination of the rectified currents coming from the two differently polarized 
aerials. It is of great interest that, in the same paper, the term diversity appears for 
the first time in the literature to describe one of the very first receive diversity (RxD)

techniques, based on spaced aerials. The following excerpt reveals that diversity sys-
tems had already been quite common among radio experts by that time: 
The fading on two aerials spaced many wave-lengths apart should be 
very different, and it is actually found to be so. “Diversity” systems of 
this type, as they are called in America, are in use both here and in that 
country, and show considerable gain in leveling the fading.
—Eckersley (1929) [53].
Furthermore, in 1928, another form of diversity, that is time diversity 
(see Section 4.4.4.3), was conceived by Verdan and Loiseau, inventors of the antipar-
asitic device, which was capable of improving the link performance of the Baudot 
telegraph system subject to atmospheric disturbances [54]. This apparatus, of the 
later called Baudot-Verdan system, and the associated Verdan principle that calls for 
retransmission of the same letter with certain delays, are described in a related paper 
by Harrison [55]. Also, it is almost unknown in the context of wireless communica-
tions that, a directional receiving aerial system, patented by Adcock [56] for the pur-
pose of eliminating the errors on closed-coil direction-finders due to down-coming 
waves, has probably served as a basis for the design of primitive transmit diversity 
(TxD) systems, such as the rotating-beacon Tx scheme of Smith-Rose. As shown in 
the schematic diagram in Figure 4.9, the Adcock system may be regarded simply 
as a pair of spaced vertical aerials with the currents flowing in opposite phase [57].

Finally, a very interesting spatial TxD system was presented by Hansell (1955), 
affiliated with R.C.A. Laboratories. In more detail, a wireless system employing 
two Txs, connected to spaced antennas, and a single Rx antenna was found to be 
equivalent to a conventional RxD system in terms of overcoming the effects of 
fading, given that the two Txs are separated in frequency by a very small amount 
of offset [58]. According to Hansell, the proposed system could be especially suit-
able for shore to ship transmission because of the impracticability of providing 
spaced receiving antennas on ships. The paper concludes that it is more cost- 
effective to improve the signal reception by the addition of a second low-power 
Tx rather than to increase the power of the single Tx in order to obtain the same 
performance. Particularly, to do so, the single Tx would require 16–1000 times 
more power than each of the two Txs. The closing paragraph of [58] is worth being 
highlighted:
There is another important advantage that is obtained by transmitter 
diversity compared to receiver diversity. The receiving equipment is... 
smaller in size and also easier to operate. This may be quite important, 
especially for mobile application where quite often space and operating 
personnel are at a premium.
—Hansell (1955) [58].
Surprisingly, the adopted approach and the discussion made in this early work are 
very consistent with the revolution that took place some decades later in the context 
of spatial TxD systems, especially through the use of space-time coding and other 
MIMO techniques.
Before closing this section, it would be a great omission not to mention the 
Canadian-born inventor Fessenden, whose technological achievements definitely 
assisted the understanding of fading effects on signal transmission and their miti-
gation via the development of proper diversity techniques. In this context, if 
Marconi is considered to be the pioneer of wireless transmission over long dis-
tances, then Fessenden is credited as the first to demonstrate the transmission 
of voice and music by radio [59]. The works in [60,61] refer to Fessenden as a 
genius and mathematician, being the father of amplitude modulation (AM) radio 
and a primary pioneer of radio as we know it today. In November 1899, at the 
meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Fessenden presented 
a paper on the “possibilities of wireless telegraphy” [62], and soon afterwards, in 
December 1900, he transmitted, for the first time in the wireless history, intelli-
gible words by electromagnetic waves [60]. The transmission took place on Cobb 
Island, Maryland, over a distance of 1600 m using a mechanical spark interrupter 
[59]. However, the fact that his voice was badly distorted and accompanied by a 
loud noise, convinced him that he needed a “continuously acting, proportional 
indicating receiver” (Fessenden’s words) [60]. For this reason, he advocated for 

156 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
continuous-wave against the spark systems utilized by Marconi [62,63]. In January 
1906, the first two-way transatlantic radio telegraphy transmission took place 
between Fessenden’s stations at Brant Rock, Massachusetts and Machrihanish 
Scotland [61]. Interestingly, Fessenden’s concept of continuous-wave radio signals 
and his development of the heterodyne principle are considered as his greatest 
contributions to radio technology [61].
4.4.4 Classification of Diversity Techniques
As already discussed, a critical issue in the design of digital communication sys-
tems is the provision for high immunity levels to fading by efficient deployment 
of diversity techniques. As will be shortly described, there is not a single technique 
that can guarantee this goal. Primarily, diversity systems can be classified accord-
ing to the nature of fading they are intended to mitigate. Following the discussion 
in Section 4.2, we focus on microdiversity techniques that are used to combat the 
short-term (i.e., small-scale) fading effects.* Before proceeding with a brief sum-
mary of them, it would be important to note that practical diversity systems usually 
combine more than one diversity techniques for better exploitation of the available 
DoFs of the system.
4.4.4.1 Spatial Diversity
Spatial diversity, also known as antenna diversity,† is the most commonly used 
form to obtain several copies of the same information-bearing signal by deploying 
multiple antennas at the Rx or/and Tx side. The redundant signals are then skill-
fully combined in order to increase the total average SNR. The term site diversity 
is sometimes used as an alternative to spatial diversity. However, site diversity 
is a macrodiversity technique that fits better in the context of satellite commu-
nications systems operating in Ka band and above, where two or more ground 
stations are linked together to provide more robust downlink signal reception 
against rain fading.
Traditionally, the most popular schemes achieving diversity over space have 
been the SIMO systems, which are usually equipped with linear combiners that 
require partial or full channel state information (CSI) only at the Rx side. Though 
the first variants of RxD techniques date back to 1920s, they still offer one of the 
greatest potentials for radio link performance improvement to many of the current 
and future wireless technologies. The dual case of SIMO are the multiple-input 
* In analogy, macrodiversity can be employed to mitigate the effects of long-term (i.e., large-
scale) fading.
† More generally, antenna diversity can refer to either of the three techniques, spatial, polariza-
tion, or pattern diversity.

Basics on the Theory of Fading Channels and Diversity ◾ 157
single-output (MISO) systems that can obtain TxD under some more sophis-
ticated architecture, usually requiring signal processing and some level of CSI 
awareness at the Tx through a dedicated feedback link between the two sides of 
the communication link.
In the more general case, a MIMO system can offer diversity and coding gains, 
with the challenge being to satisfy the complexity constraints and transmitted 
power limitations put on the design. However, all configurations require sufficient 
separation between antenna elements on the same side to ensure independent fad-
ing conditions over all channels and realize the diversity advantage. Not very often, 
the minimum distance between antennas that yield uncorrelated fading is called 
coherence space.
4.4.4.2 Frequency Diversity
In frequency diversity, the same information-bearing signal is transmitted on L car-
riers, where the separation between successive carriers must equal or exceed Bc. 
Obviously, this approach is very well suited to multicarrier systems working in 
frequency division multiplexing (FDM) mode. One of the very first applications 
of this technique in wireless telegraphy is described by Beverage and Peterson [52]. 
However, the major disadvantages of similar systems are generally the non-efficient 
bandwidth usage and the requirement for receivers with multiple radio frequency 
(RF) chains. A more refined version of multicarrier operation to achieve the same 
target is the combination of OFDM with channel coding and frequency interleav-
ing in the presence of time-dispersive channels.* 
In a broader sense, frequency diversity is an intrinsic characteristic of wide-
band channels, that is, channels with a bandwidth greater than Bc. Particularly, 
wideband transmission can provide the receiver with several independently fad-
ing signal replicas, thus achieving frequency diversity of order d
W Bc
=
/ , given 
that the induced ISI is efficiently mitigated. A possible approach to deal with 
this issue is single-carrier transmission with channel equalization. Alternatively, 
FH-SS technology utilizes bandwidth expansion to exploit the inherent frequency 
diversity of the channel. Olofsson et al. [64] showed that FH-SS also introduces 
interference diversity, since different signals interfering with the desired one at 
different times can result in an averaging effect, which improves performance in 
system level.
Finally, a DS-SS system employing a RAKE receiver is capable of resolving mul-
tipath components at different time delays, a phenomenon also called multipath 
diversity. The RAKE receiver, proposed by Price and Green [65], uses several cor-
relators or fingers, each assigned to a different multipath component, to separate and 
coherently combine all the delayed replicas of the wideband signal.
* Frequency interleaving is the mapping of the coded bits to the subcarriers.

158 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
4.4.4.3 Time Diversity
Time diversity exploits the frequency-dispersive nature of time-varying wireless 
channels to provide more reliable communication. This can be easily accom-
plished by using multiple time slots separated by at least the coherence time, Tc, 
of the channel to transmit the same data symbols. Particularly, every symbol is 
repeated L times and then interleaved before being transmitted over the wireless 
channel, so that consecutive symbols experience independent fading conditions.* 
Obviously, this technique can be viewed as repetition coding of the information 
sequence, with the length L of the code defining the diversity order obtained. 
However, the achieved gain comes at the expense of spectral efficiency, since 
a single symbol requires transmission over several time intervals. Furthermore, 
a repetition code does not effectively exploit all the DoFs available in a fading 
channel.
Instead, more sophisticated coding schemes, such as linear block codes or con-
volutional codes, along with interleaving can be employed to realize additional 
coding gain.† In this way, the encoded symbols can be efficiently dispersed over 
different coherence periods, thus taking full advantage of the inherent time diver-
sity in time-selective channels. Nevertheless, as the fading rate (i.e., the Bd) of a 
fading channel decreases, for example, due to mobile terminals that slow down, 
it may not be possible to obtain time diversity without introducing unacceptable 
delays, since in this case the inevitable large Tc limits the performance of a given 
interleaver.
4.4.4.4 Polarization Diversity
Early measurements on long-distance transmission revealed that propagation 
characteristics of a wireless medium are not the same for differently polarized 
waves. In addition, multiple reflections between the Tx and Rx cause depolariza-
tion of the radio waves, thus dispersing some energy of the transmitted signal into 
other polarization directions.‡ Due to that attribute, linearly polarized transmit-
ted waves can come out at the Rx end with an additional nontrivial orthogonal 
component. These observations motivated many researchers to investigate the fad-
ing statistics associated with radio signals received by antennas of various polariza-
tion modes.
Among the first, Glaser and Faber [66] demonstrated that the vertical and 
horizontal polarized components of the same received signal undergo almost 
statistically independent fading while propagating through certain wireless

Basics on the Theory of Fading Channels and Diversity ◾ 159
environments. This fact has been utilized to improve radio system performance 
through the use of polarization diversity, where two or more spatially separated uni-
polarized antennas are replaced by a single antenna structure of almost  co-located 
elements by employing multiple polarizations. The simplest polarization diversity 
systems utilize dual-polarized antennas with two orthogonal components, that 
is, copolarized and cross-polarized, rendering them very handy for use in cellular 
radio networks owing to the minimized antenna installation space and the fact 
that mobile terminals can experience reliable communication whatever the hand-
set angle of tilt.
4.4.4.5 Pattern Diversity
Antenna pattern diversity comprises another form of exploiting the inherent DoFs 
of multipath propagation environment. The concept behind this approach lies in 
the relationship that holds between the received signal fluctuation and the direc-
tion of the main lobe of the Rx antenna pattern. The first experimental results 
validating this statement were reported by Bruce [67] and Bruce and Beck [68], 
who found remarkable reduction in fading by using a horizontal rhombic antenna 
with an extremely sharp directional pattern. The success of their attempt was 
based on the existence of stable angular separation among signal components fol-
lowing different paths, thus enabling a steerable antenna with sufficiently sharp 
directivity to accept only one of them, maybe the best after some calibration, at 
any time.
Friis et al. [69] clearly demonstrated the qualitative relation between angles of 
arrival and propagation delays of the received signal components; the greater the 
delay the greater the angle above the horizontal (or azimuth) plane. In [70], Friis and 
Feldman (1937) exploited this phenomenon with the aid of a special arrangement 
whereby individual wave groups arriving at different vertical angles were received sep-
arately and, after delay equalization, combined coherently to offer directional diver-
sity or directivity diversity. They accomplished that with the multiple unit steerable 
antenna (MUSA) system. According to Gregory and Newsome (2010), the MUSA 
array was the last major technological development in the short-wave communica-
tion era, representing the ultimate receiving system [71]. It was probably the most 
complex radio Rx ever built and gave valuable service between the 1940s and 1960s. 
Later, Vogelman et al. (1959) extended the concept of a single beam steerable to 
a multibeam antenna, where signal components associated with individual beams 
were particularly combined to offer angle diversity or angle-of-arrival diversity [72]. 
However, the effectiveness of this system depends upon the antenna characteristics, 
which have to be properly chosen so that the angle between adjacent beams is always 
smaller than the angular spread of the channel and that low correlation among differ-
ent beams is ensured.
Obviously, pattern diversity can also be provided via several antennas with 
diverse patterns spaced apart from each other. An interesting case arises when 

160 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
antennas with similar patterns are placed close to each other with respect to 
the coherence space defined in Section 4.4.4.1. Particularly, mutual coupling 
effects alter their antenna pattern, thus yielding again a quite effective pat-
tern diversity scheme. In addition, field component diversity, first proposed by 
Gilbert [73], utilizes sophisticated energy density antenna arrangements to 
receive uncorrelated electric and magnetic field components of the transmit-
ted signal so as to reduce fading in mobile radio. The conception of the energy 
density antenna as a means to mitigate signal fading in mobile radio channels 
is credited to Pierce, who communicated this idea to other researchers, such as 
Gilbert (1965) and Lee (1967).
4.4.4.6 Other Forms of Diversity
It has been mentioned earlier that the inherent diversity of frequency-selective 
fading channels can be exploited by spread spectrum techniques (e.g., DS-SS) 
with RAKE reception. However, the RAKE receiver is optimal for time-dispersive 
channels only, whereas for rapid temporal variations of the channel (i.e., fast fad-
ing), the resulting Doppler spread induces performance degradation due to inac-
curate channel estimation. This fact motivated Sayeed and Aazhang [74] to suggest 
the dual version of the conventional RAKE receiver, called Doppler RAKE receiver, 
that is capable of resolving Doppler components at different frequency shifts. By 
adopting a joint time-frequency representation for the received signal, they first 
revealed the inherent diversity mechanism of a doubly-dispersive channel and fur-
ther proved that it can be exploited by appropriate signal processing. This new 
receiver structure, which actually realizes Bd as another DoF, performs optimally in 
frequency-dispersive channels and offers Doppler diversity of order proportional to 
TBd. In the more general case of a doubly-dispersive channel, Sayeed and Aazhang 
proposed again the time-frequency RAKE receiver that can offer in an optimal fash-
ion joint multipath-Doppler diversity of order proportional to the product of the 
channel spread factor and the processing gain of the spread spectrum signaling 
technique [74].
Knopp and Humblet [75] studied the optimal power control scheme that 
maximizes information capacity in the uplink of single-cell multiuser communi-
cations corrupted by flat fading. They proved that the best strategy, that is sched-
uling at any time only the user with the largest SNR, provides multiuser diversity 
of order proportional to the number of users. Since then, the presence of mul-
tiple users on the same system has been conceived as a new DoF that was very 
effectively exploited by Sendonaris et al. [76] and a little later by Laneman et al. 
[77] through the introduction of the user cooperation diversity and cooperative 

Basics on the Theory of Fading Channels and Diversity ◾ 161
diversity concepts, respectively. These diversity gains can be achieved via the 
cooperation of intra-cell users that share their antennas and other resources so 
as to create a virtual array in a distributed manner. For this reason, Laneman and 
Wornell (2000) adopted also the term distributed spatial diversity [78].
A related concept, suggested by Boyer et al. [79], is the multihop  diversity, 
where the benefits of spatial diversity are achieved from the concurrent recep-
tion of signals that have been transmitted by multiple previous terminals along 
a single primary route. Particularly, two models of multihop diversity chan-
nels were defined in [79]; the decoded relaying and the amplified relaying. In 
the former, each intermediate terminal combines, decodes, and reencodes the 
received signals from all preceding terminals, whereas in the latter, the inter-
mediate terminals simply combine and amplify them, before retransmission. 
In addition, Boutros and Viterbo [80] introduced the signal space diversity or 
modulation diversity, whereby significant coding gains can be realized over 
fading channels with the aid of specially designed multidimensional QAM 
constellations. The key point behind this technique lies in the employment 
of particular lattice rotation, IQ interleaving/deinterleaving and decoding 
procedures.
Finally, in a different context, Callaghan and Longstaff [81] proposed the wave-
form diversity; a technique employing multiple transmit waveforms for suppress-
ing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) range ambiguities (i.e., ambiguous range target 
returns). The waveform diversity scheme embeds, let say, Nb bits of information per 
pulse by selecting the waveform on a pulse-to-pulse basis from a set of 2Nb wave-
forms, where each waveform represents a distinct Nb-bit symbol. The Rx obtains 
the embedded information in each pulse by determining the radar waveform that 
has been transmitted [82]. It is interesting to note that, according to the IEEE 
Standard Radar Definitions (IEEE Std 686-2008), this term is defined as the adap-
tivity of the waveform to dynamically optimize radar performance, while exploit-
ing other domains such as time, frequency, coding, antenna radiation pattern, and 
polarization.
4.4.4.7 High-Level List of Pure Diversity Techniques
In Table 4.2, a quite extensive list of pure diversity techniques proposed so far in 
the literature is given. With the term pure it is implied here that only the diver-
sity techniques which utilize a single basic principle or concept are included. 
Therefore, in Table 4.2, other very popular diversity strategies, such as space-
time coding, space-time-frequency coding, and so on, are not included.

168 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
5.1 Introduction
Wireless communications have been continuously evolving with the provision of 
new sets of applications and services to the mobile user. In order to achieve the 
demanding objectives and requirements imposed by the increasing use of mobile 
services and applications, wireless communication evolution is triggered by the need 
for (Andrews et al. 2014; NGMN Alliance 2015; Bockelmann et al. 2016):
 
◾higher data rates that will allow users to download huge volumes of data 
through the radio channel
 
◾efficient utilization and sharing of the finite radio resources among the rapidly 
increasing number of users of mobile services and applications
 
◾reliable communication links that ensure adequate quality of service (QoS) 
to all users
 
◾seamless connectivity regardless of location, mobility conditions, and density 
of connected users
Challenges in wireless communications are amplified due to the fact that they rely 
on a finite and scarce resource, the radio spectrum. Standardization of waveforms 
and access protocols, as well as licensed use of spectrum were necessary actions in 
order to facilitate the development of efficient and reliable mobile radio systems.
The road to 5th-generation (5G) communication systems has marked a change 
in the objectives and orientation of wireless evolution. 5G systems will incorporate a 
large variety of emerging services and applications that deviate from the conventional 
development steps of cellular networking.
5G marks a transition to machine-type communications (Militano et  al. 
2015). Device-to-device (D2D) communications and vehicular communications 
(Hobert et al. 2015; Uhlemann 2015) will enable connectivity of billions of intel-
ligent machines, allowing remote control and monitoring, as well as unmanned 
operation and coordination. Internet of things (IoT) (Mavromoustakis et al. 2016) 
applications will provide a new range of capabilities and emerging technologies like 
the smart cities, the connected vehicle, the smart grid, and many more. Recently, 
Tactile Internet has also emerged as a 5G-enabled technology. Tactile Internet refers 
to extremely low-latency communications with high availability and reliability

(Simsek et al. 2016). Tactile Internet delivers a variety of public services ensuring 
remote sensing and real-time control of cyber-physical systems, for example, unmanned 
aerial/surface/ground vehicles, robots, automated machinery, and many more.
5G aims to higher data rates in order to satisfy the increasing demand for 
throughput from all users and applications using a finite set of radio resources. 
In order to maximize the utilization of spectrum resources, composite network 
structures are considered that differentiate from the conventional cellular network 
layout. Cooperative schemes, Massive MIMO (Larsson et al. 2014), cloud radio 
access network (C-RAN) (Wu et al. 2015), coordinated multipoint (Jungnickel 
et al. 2014), and full-duplex (Sabharwal et al. 2014) are some of the concepts 
adopted in the design of 5G networks. In addition, wireless regional area networks 
(WRAN) that bring high-speed broadband Internet access in remote, isolated 
areas are also a 5G objective.
The transition to unconventional network structures and machine-type com-
munications also marks a transition from the conventional cell-centric model 
to distributed modes. Moreover, 5G has to deal with spectrum scarcity in order 
to maximize radio resource utilization and it should be able to operate over non-
contiguous, fragmented spectrum. Expansion to millimeter-Wave (mm-Wave) 
frequencies is also considered, as means for high-rate connectivity used for back-
hauling, fronthauling (De La Oliva et al. 2015), WRAN solutions, as well as in 
some cases for low-range radio access.
Therefore, 5G aims to the design of a radio network that: (1) maximizes spectral 
efficiency, (2) is highly tolerant and robust to interference, (3) is able to achieve 
accurate synchronization over a diverse set of radio and network conditions, and 
(4) is able to harmonically coexist with a large number of users (people or devices) 
with different requirements and objectives.
The research community is currently very active on designing, proposing, and 
evaluating waveform candidates for 5G systems (Banelli et al. 2014). The objective 
of this chapter is to investigate waveforms that will help achieve the 5G goals, that 
is, to propose modulation schemes with exceptional spectral efficiency, low out-of-
band emissions (OOB), robustness against interference and synchronization errors 
and suitable for use in a fragmented radio spectrum.
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and OFDM-based 
transmission schemes have dominated current wireless communication standards 
including WLANs, LTE, and DVB. OFDM has become popular due to specific 
advantages: 
 
◾Robustness against frequency selective fading with the division of informa-
tion symbols in parallel narrowband channels
 ◾Efficient use of spectrum due to overlapping transmission of orthogonal parallel 
narrowband channels
 
◾Low-complexity implementation with the use of Fast Fourier Transforms

170 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
 
◾Low-complexity channel equalization compare with single-carrier solutions
 ◾Robustness against intersymbol interference (ISI) with the use of the cyclic prefix
 
◾Robustness against impulsive noise
 
◾Simple integration of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in the 
OFDM transmitter/receiver chain
 
◾Ability to easily integrate adaptive modulation and coding techniques to 
efficiently exploit the radio channel
 
◾Provision of direct extension to a multiplexing scheme with orthogonal fre-
quency division multiple access (OFDMA) for resource sharing
For all these reasons, OFDM has given a great boost to the evolution of wireless 
communications. However, as requirements become more demanding, OFDM 
disadvantages become a limiting factor in the route toward 5G. More specifically: 
 
◾Due to the use of rectangular pulses in the time domain, OFDM presents 
powerful sidelobes, that is, high OOB emissions. This fact imposes the use 
of null guard subcarriers at the edges of the transmitted signal spectrum. As 
a result, spectrum efficiency is reduced and the use of OFDM in fragmented 
spectrum is not recommended.
 
◾The use of cyclic prefix is beneficial in many aspects; however, it reduces spectral 
efficiency significantly.
 
◾OFDM requires synchronization accuracy in time and frequency. Despite the 
fact, that the cyclic prefix can provide protection against timing synchroniza-
tion errors, high accuracy in frequency alignment is difficult to achieve in 
a multiuser environment with distributed coordination. Errors in frequency 
synchronization can be extremely harmful in OFDM, since they lead to 
InterCarrier Interference (ICI).
 
◾OFDM exhibits large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and thus is not 
recommended for use in low-cost user equipment (UE) hardware, where poor 
amplifier performance and low Digital-to-Analog converter resolution may 
lead to unrecoverable signal distortion.
In this chapter, after a presentation of the OFDM modulation, a review of the most 
popular OFDM-alternative waveforms is given. For each modulation, there is a short 
description of the transmitter/receiver chains and their main advantages and disadvan-
tages are denoted. More specifically, FBMC-OQAM, UFMC, and GFDM are analyzed.
5.2 Multicarrier Modulation for ISI Avoidance
The problem of ISI in wideband communications can be summarized in the follow-
ing sentence: When the time dispersion caused by the radio channel is comparable 
with the period of the transmitted symbol T, then during reception each symbol 
suffers from interference by delayed versions of previous symbols.

Multicarrier Modulation Schemes—Candidate Waveforms for 5G ◾ 171
Generally, in wideband transmissions T
T
m >>
, where Tm is the maximum 
excess delay induced by the channel. Multicarrier modulations resolve this issue 
using a simple rationale. Instead of transmitting symbols with short pulses, they 
are divided in N  parallel streams and transmitted using long narrowband pulses, 
so that NT >>Tm. This method limits the effect of ISI. In addition, guard inter-
vals (in time and/or frequency) or cyclic signal extensions can completely cancel 
the effect of the dispersive and selective radio channel. Moreover, the multicar-
rier modulation scheme should minimize possible interference among the N  
 narrowband streams that are transmitted in parallel. The interference among the 
N  subchannels in OFDM is called ICI.
If we omit details and particularities of each multicarrier scheme, multicar-
rier modulation can be roughly described as a pair of filter banks (transmitter and 
receiver) applied to the N parallel signal streams. A simplified, generic block diagram 
to describe the concept of multicarrier modulations in the analog time domain is 
presented in Figure 5.1.
Based on Figure 5.1, a multicarrier scheme is able to completely eliminate 
ISI, when the set of filter functions φn t( ) (

 is orthogonal with their 
mT  (m∈) time-shifted versions. This filter configuration in the transmitter and 
receiver forms a pair of matched filters. In addition, the filters should be ideally 
orthogonal with the rest of the bank filters in order to avoid ICI. Ideally, the filter 
bank forms an orthogonal basis where:

where Nn k,  is the noise component filtered by the receiver. Based on the aforemen-

the signal space.
The results in Equations 5.2 and 5.3 present a system without ISI and ICI, but 
assume flat radio channel. In case of a frequency selective channel, the transmitted

system, it is not realistic to assume that the eigenfunctions, that is, the filters, 
will be computed for each given channel h t( ), especially since the radio channel 
is time variant.
Therefore, in realistic transmission schemes, the frequency-selective channel 
imposes limitations and requirements that cannot be exceeded without a cost.
Generally, the baseband discrete-time representation of a multicarrier scheme 
provides more insight in the operation of each modulations scheme.
5.3 Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
OFDM (Li and Stuber 2006) follows the general principles of multicarrier modula-
tions. The available bandwidth B is divided in N  subchannels, called subcarriers. 
No guard band is kept between subchannels. The available data are divided in 
blocks of N  parallel streams. After applying the OFDM modulation, each stream 
constitutes the OFDM symbol with duration T .
The selected base for OFDM is the uniformly-modulated rectangular pulse over 
the available bandwidth. Assuming a baseband equivalent representation, the base 
functions are given by

For AWGN transmission in ideal conditions, OFDM achieves maximum efficiency

5.3.1 Cyclic Extension and Frequency Selective Channels
Maximum spectral efficiency is achieved for nonselective radio channel. However, 
when a signal passes through the radio channel, it is extended in time. If ν +1 is 
the length of the radio channel impulse response in samples, then the only way to 
cancel ISI is to use a guard time interval with ν samples. As a matrix relationship, 
the convolution result for N  output samples is expressed as

From Equation 5.11 it is seen that, besides its operation as a guard band, the cyclic 
prefix transforms the linear convolution of the signal with the channel response, 
to circular convolution. The channel matrix P is now a N
N
×
 circulant matrix. 
Circulant matrices are special cases of Toeplitz matrix. Each row follows from 
the previous row with right-hand rotation by one element. The overflown matrix 
elements are not discarded but circularly reinserted at the beginning of the row.

The eigenvalues of the circulant channel matrix P that appear in the diagonal of 
ΛΛ form the channel transfer function. The great benefit of the circulant channel is 
that eigenvector matrices are channel-independent. OFDM transmission/reception 
is described by a sequence of matrix relationships: 
 
◾In the transmitter, the signal vector S is multiplied with F*, that is, s = F S
*  to 
produce the OFDM symbol.
 
◾The signal propagates through the channel and the received signal y is 
demodulated by multiplying it with the DFT matrix, that is, Y

Matrix multiplication with the conjugate matrix F is equivalent with the inverse 
DFT. Respectively, multiplication with F performs the DFT.
The great provided advantage is that the equalization procedure is greatly 
simplified. Based on Equation 5.14, it can be seen that equalization can be 
achieved with a single multiplication per subcarrier. For example, the zero-forc-
ing equalizer is implemented using ΛΛ−1, which is also diagonal with inverted 
elements of ΛΛ.

5.3.2 Out-of-Band Emissions in OFDM
OFDM modulation achieves maximum spectral efficiency for ideal AWGN trans-
mission, where a cyclic prefix is not needed. At this point, we should mention the 
Balian–Low theorem from Gabor theory, that states that there is no function basis 
to simultaneously satisfy the following criteria: 
 
1. All functions are mutually orthogonal in time and frequency.
 
2. They are well localized in time and frequency domain.
 
3. Maximal spectral efficiency is achieved.
Well-localized functions are the functions that provide compact support in a 
given time-frequency grid. OFDM in ideal AWGN transmission provides orthogo-
nal functions and maximum efficiency; however, it is not well-localized in the time-
frequency grid defined by T  and B. On the contrary, OFDM spectrum is infinite 
since the Fourier transform of the rectangular pulse is a sinc function. This leads to 
the first significant disadvantage, the OFDM sidelobes, and high OOB radiation. 
In Figure 5.2, the spectrum shape for two adjacent subcarriers is presented.
The strong sidelobes cause important implications in OFDM operation: 
 ◾Strong OOB emissions cause adjacent channel interference. Respectively, the 
OFDM receiver gathers significant power from OOB interfering signals. In 
real-world conditions OFDM requires large spectral guard bands from adjacent 
emissions resulting in significant reduction of spectral efficiency.
 
◾As OFDM subcarriers are not well-localized in frequency, OFDM is sensitive 
in frequency shifts and phase noise. Frequency shifts are caused from local 
oscillator deviations (in the transmitter or/and the receiver), or due to Doppler 
effects. These shifts will cause misalignment of the subcarriers resulting in loss 

Multicarrier Modulation Schemes—Candidate Waveforms for 5G ◾ 177
of orthogonality. As a result, ICI appears. From Figure 5.2, it can be seen that 
a shift equal to 0.25 of the subcarrier distance will reduce the signal power by 
approximately 3 dB and will induce more than −10 dB ICI (using the signal 
power under ideal reception as reference).
5.3.3 Cyclic Prefix and Spectral Efficiency
In frequency selective channels, the cyclic prefix reduces spectral efficiency even more. 
The signal is extended beyond the period T  defined by the Nyquist rate. If β is the 
cyclic prefix percentage in terms of OFDM symbol duration, then the time-bandwidth 
product is given by (
)
B N T(1
)
1
+
>
β
 and the spectral efficiency is reduced. For 
highly frequency selective channels, the cyclic prefix size should increase accordingly. 
In existing standards, for example, LTE with extended prefix (Long-Term Evolution 
(LTE) standard 2008) or IEEE 802.11 (2007), the cyclic prefix is one-quarter of the 
OFDM symbol duration.
Moreover, the use of the cyclic prefix implies that β
β
(1
)
+
 of the transmitted 
power carries redundant information. Therefore, OFDM energy efficiency is also 
reduced. It should be noted that OFDM versions with the use of zero-prefix can 
also be considered in order to avoid energy expenditure with a small cost in the 
receiver design complexity (Muquet et al. 2000).
5.3.4 Synchronization in OFDM
Time synchronization is also crucial in OFDM (Maliatsos et al. 2008). Timing errors 
may cause severe degradation of SNR. However, OFDM is not considered sensitive 
in time synchronization errors due to the protection provided by the cyclic prefix. 
If ν is the cyclic prefix length and µ  is the channel impulse response length with

µ < ν, then it can easily be proved that for timing errors ε
µ
= ν
−+
−
,..., 1, the per-
formance of the OFDM receiver does not degrade. As no ISI appears, the only effect 
is a phase shift that can be compensated by the equalizer without any modification.
For positive errors, or ε

µ
< −+ , ISI appears in the reception procedure that 
will cause distortion. However, it should be noted that for ε
ν
µ
< −+ , or even in 
cases where µ
ν
≥ (for relatively small values), performance degradation is performed 
smoothly, in contrast with the performance collapse that takes place in single carrier 
systems when the equalizer tolerance is exceeded. This is also an advantage for OFDM.
5.3.5 Peak to Average Power Ratio
Another OFDM disadvantage is the high values of peak-to-average power ratio 
(PAPR). OFDM time samples are produced as a sum of the frequency-domain 
symbols multiplied with the inverse DFT basis. Assuming that all available subcar-
riers are used, if we consider the data symbols as independent random variables and 
given the fact that the number of subcarriers is adequately high (
)
≥32 , the Central 
Limit theorem can be invoked. Therefore, the OFDM time-domain samples are 
independent Gaussian variables, that is, the OFDM waveform has the same statis-
tical behavior with AWGN. Thus, the signal has a highly irregular behavior in the 
time domain and since the time samples are uncorrelated, peaks may appear sud-
denly at any time. As an example, for mean signal power 1, one out of every 1000 
samples is expected to have power higher than 4.5. This means that the PAPR is 
expected to exceed 4.5 for and OFDM system with N =1024.
High PAPR may introduce serious degradation in the system performance when 
the signal passes through nonlinear high power amplifiers (HPA) during transmis-
sion. This may cause spectral growth of the signal in the form of intermodulation 
and spurious emissions. In order to avoid these effects, the HPA should operate in 
its linear region with inefficient power conversion. Moreover, if there are specific 
applications, regulatory restrictions, or constraints imposed by the digital-to-analog 
converter (DAC) regarding the peak transmit power, then the mean signal power 
should also be reduced. In turn, this reduces the range of multicarrier transmission.
In order to avoid PAPR effects, sophisticated and expensive hardware components 
at the transceiver are required, or algorithms that can reduce PAPR should be applied. 
There are plenty of PAPR reduction techniques for OFDM, from simple clipping to 
transmit signal precoding (Han and Lee 2005). However, the application of PAPR 
reduction techniques may either degrade system performance under circumstances, 
or entail the need for more complicated transceiver designs.
5.3.6 Summary—Advantages and Disadvantages
OFDM advantages can be separated in multicarrier modulation-specific, that is, 
advantages that can be found in many multicarrier modulations and OFDM-
specific (Li and Stuber 2006):

Multicarrier Modulation Schemes—Candidate Waveforms for 5G ◾ 179
 
◾Multicarrier modulation advantages
– As a modulation scheme, it is able to integrate adaptive modulation and 
coding procedures in order to optimize data throughput.
– It inherently supports MIMO transmission and it can use narrowband 
MIMO-related algorithms per narrowband subcarrier.
– OFDM can also be used as a multiple access technique, that is, the 
OFDMA.
– Frequency domain interleaving and scrambling can protect signals from 
burst errors, in case some subcarriers suffer from deep fading. In this sense, 
OFDM is robust in narrowband interference, as only a small number of 
subcarriers is affected.
 
◾OFDM-specific advantages
– OFDM achieves maximal spectral efficiency for ideal transmission over 
AWGN channel. Despite the fact that spectral efficiency is significantly 
reduced under real-world conditions, OFDM has been proved highly effi-
cient in wideband channels compared to single carrier modulations.
– OFDM is implemented with minimization of the computational work-
load in the transmitter and the receiver. This is caused by the fact that 
modulation/demodulation is performed with IFFT/FFT, the computa-
tionally efficient implementations of the inverse and direct DFT.
– Equalization is performed with a simple multiplication per subcarrier by 
taking advantage the circular extension of the signal.
– ISI is canceled with the use of the cyclic prefix. Even if the cyclic pre-
fix does not fully protect the OFDM symbol due to extended channel 
impulse response, the receiver will not collapse, but its performance will 
degrade smoothly.
– Time synchronization is crucial for OFDM; however, the cyclic prefix 
provides additional protection and thus the OFDM receiver can tolerate 
and manage a range of possible synchronization errors.
On the other hand, the OFDM disadvantages are summarized in the following: 
 
◾OFDM OOB emissions are quite high causing adjacent channel interference.
 
◾On the other hand, unfiltered OFDM is vulnerable to interference from 
adjacent channels (Maliatsos et al. 2013). The high OFDM sidelobes reduce 
spectral efficiency, since spectral guard bands should be kept to avoid interfer-
ing effects.
 
◾OFDM is sensitive in frequency shifts and there is need for elaborate com-
pensation algorithms in the receiver (Pollet et al. 1995; Maliatsos et al. 2008).
 
◾The use of the cyclic prefix is beneficial for OFDM in plenty of ways. However, 
the cyclic prefix reduces spectral efficiency as well as energy efficiency.
 
◾OFDM has high PAPR and this may cause significant degradation in system 
performance.

180 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
The provided analysis shows that OFDM has some significant disadvantages that 
have to be mitigated in order to achieve the 5G objectives. However, even at this 
point, OFDM performs exceptionally well balancing the trade-off between perfor-
mance and implementation complexity.
Given the increasing potential of the current transceivers, the research com-
munity searches for candidate waveforms that balance better among the tradeoffs 
defined by the Balian–Low theorem and the computational workload needed for 
the implementation of the systems.
5.4  FilterBank MultiCarrier Modulation 
with Offset QAM
OFDM without cyclic prefix achieves maximum spectral efficiency for AWGN 
channel under ideal conditions. According to Gabor theory and Balian–Low 
theorem (Mallat 1999; Feichtinger and Strohmer 2012), there is no pulse other 
than the rectangular (used in OFDM) that can achieve orthogonal transmission 
with maximum efficiency for symbol duration T  with critical Nyquist sampling.
However, a simple trick can be used to bypass the Balian–Low constraints and 
to achieve maximal spectral efficiency with critical sampling using pulses that are 
well-localized in both time and frequency. This can be achieved using a time off-
set in the QAM constellation of the frequency-domain data symbols. FilterBank 
MultiCarrier modulation with Offset QAM (FBMC-OQAM) is based on the 
aforementioned technique (Saltzberg 1967; Hirosaki 1981).
Two keystones are defined in order to achieve orthogonality in pulse-shaped 
FBMC-OQAM. First, a time offset is inserted between the real and imaginary part 
of the QAM symbol. Second, the design is performed so that for two adjacent sub-
channels, when the imaginary part is delayed by the offset on the one subchannel, 
then the real part is delayed on the other. Let’s assume that there are M  subchannels 
(M  even) and that cm n,  is the n-th QAM symbol of the m-th subchannel. The M  
subchannels are defined by the set of carrier frequencies f

From Equation 5.19, it can be seen that the filter operates at twice the rate, but 
nevertheless, it requires the same number of multiplications as the complex convolu-
tion at the Nyquist rate. The oversampling bypasses the Balian–Low constraints with 
no cost in complexity workload. Conversion to real-valued symbols is done with the 
offset insertion in either the real or imaginary part of the original symbol, following 
the rule that a real pulse is immediately adjacent only with purely imaginary pulses 
in time and frequency.

From Equation 5.20, it can be seen that only the projection of the real part of the 
signal onto the basis is taken into account. For ideal transmission, the symbols can 
be acquired with perfect reconstruction (orthogonality in time and frequency), if 
the pulse has the following property:

This relationship is the necessary condition to ensure orthogonality (in the pre-
sented analysis we assume that filter energy is normalized in unity to maintain the 
same average signal power).
5.4.1 FBMC-OQAM in the Discrete Time Domain
Critical time sampling is assumed, that is, T
T M
s =
. The discrete baseband filter 
is h k( ), where k is the time variable/sample index. The filter is considered a causal, 
symmetrical, real-valued finite impulse response (FIR) filter in order to ensure linear 
phase response and exploit symmetry to reduce computational workload. The equiva-
lent baseband discrete signal is given by

Delay β is used to align phases between transmitter and receiver. The total 
filtering latency is α.
5.4.2 Polyphase Filters
The synthesis/analysis filters constitute a uniform DFT filterbank. The filterbank

The term WM indicates the existence of inverse and direct DFT in the synthesis and 
analysis banks, respectively. If we use the polyphase filters to assemble the uniform 
DFT bank, the FBMC-OQAM modulator and demodulator are implemented as 
depicted in Figure 5.4.
5.4.3 Filter Specifications
In order to ensure that orthogonality in time and frequency is achieved, the synthe-
sis and analysis filterbanks should retain the perfect reconstruction (PR) property. 
According to (Vaidyanathan 1993), PR cannot be achieved for critically-sampled 
uniform DFT banks. Nevertheless, since the used filterbanks are not operating in 
the Nyquist rate, they have the same properties with cosine-modulated filterbanks 
(Nguyen and Koilpillai 1996) and, especially, the modified DFT (MDFT) filter 
banks (Karp and Fliege 1999). The necessary condition in order to obtain the PR 
feature for cosine-modulated and MDFT filterbanks is given by

There is a plethora of algorithms that can be used to implement MDFT banks with 
the PR property (Koilpillai and Vaidyanathan 1992; Karp and Fliege 1996, 1999; 
Nguyen and Koilpillai 1996; Bolcskei and Hlawatsch 1998, Lu et al. 2004).
In Karp and Fliege (1999), an MDFT implementation is presented, where the 
oversampled uniform DFT bank of Figure 5.4 is divided in two critically sam-
pled filterbanks. In Figures 5.5 and 5.6, we present a novel representation of the

5.4.4 FBMC-OQAM in Real-World Conditions
The presented analysis proves that an FBMC-OQAM system can be orthogonal 
with the use of filters with PR property. Moreover, FBMC-OQAM also achieves 
maximum spectral efficiency. However, in a time-variant and frequency selective 
channel, the orthogonality is lost.
In real-world operation, filters without precise PR properties may perform bet-
ter due to the radio channel effects, if they are well-localized in time and frequency. 
This means that an FBMC-OQAM filter should concentrate the maximum energy 
possible to the time-frequency point ( , )
m n . Empirically, an FBMC-OQAM system 
is expected to operate properly, if:

(E is the total filter energy and H f( ) is the filter Fourier transform.) Parameters ˆf  
and ˆt  express the well-localization property of the filter.
In case one of the aforementioned conditions is not satisfied, then the issue of 
proper signal equalization becomes difficult. This is an important disadvantage 
of FBMC-OQAM compared to OFDM. With the use of the cyclic prefix and 
with low computational load, OFDM performs frequency-domain equalization 
(FEQ). FBMC-OQAM does not use cyclic prefix but it is quite tolerant in ISI 
and ICI due to the use of well-localized pulses. If the conditions of Equation 5.34 
are satisfied, then FEQ can also be used in FBMC-OQAM with negligible dis-
tortion. Empirical tests have shown that well-localized filters provide FEQ sup-
port for τmax ≤0.1T  and B
f
D
c
≤0.15∆. If the conditions of Equation 5.34 are not 
satisfied, then time domain equalization (TEQ) procedures should be applied 
for each individual subchannel (Nedic and Popovic 2002; Farhang-Boroujeny 
and Lin 2003; Lin et al. 2009). TEQ procedures require heavy computational 
workload. Therefore, FBMC-OQAM imposes specific constraints that depend 
on the radio channel coherence and dispersion measures, as well as the quality 
of the used filters.
5.4.5 Advantages and Disadvantages
FBMC-OQAM has the following advantages:
 
◾FBMC-OQAM has significantly lower sidelobes due to the use of well-
localized filters. This means that the FBMC-OQAM waveform does not cause 
high adjacent channel interference. In addition, the FBMC-OQAM receiv-
ers have higher tolerance in adjacent channel interference. As an example, 
Figure 5.7 depicts the spectrum of the OFDM rectangular pulse versus an 
FBMC-OQAM pulse proposed in the context of the EU project PHYDYAS 
(Bellanger et al. 2010). The pulse impulse response is given by

◾FBMC-OQAM is not using cyclic prefix. Hence, spectral and energy effi-
ciency is not reduced. FBMC-OQAM is functional, if the used well-localized 
pulses satisfy the conditions of Equation 5.34.

Multicarrier Modulation Schemes—Candidate Waveforms for 5G ◾ 191
 
◾FBMC-OQAM is not sensitive in frequency offsets due to the  excellent 
frequency localization properties of the subchannel filters. In  addition, 
FBMC-OQAM is significantly less sensitive than OFDM in higher Doppler 
spreads. Thus, FBMC-OQAM is robust and functional for high-user mobil-
ity and non-negligible frequency alignment errors.
The FBMC-OQAM disadvantages in comparison with OFDM are: 
 
◾The implementation of the FBMC-OQAM transmitter and receiver requires 
much more computational workload. FBMC-OQAM contains DFT trans-
forms in conjunction with a filtering operation. However, due to the fact 
that plenty of work has been done for improved FBMC-OQAM complexity 
(e.g., Dandach and Siohan 2011; Nadal et al. 2016, 2014) combined with 
the evolution in digital processor hardware, FBMC-OQAM is feasible and 
implementable in modern radio systems.
 
◾The FBMC-OQAM robustness in radio channel frequency-selectivity 
depends on the filter selection and the delay spread/coherence bandwidth of 
the channel. As no cyclic prefix exists, FBMC-OQAM allows ISI; however, 
due to the well-localization properties of the filters, ISI effects can be negligi-
ble. If ISI exceeds system tolerance, then computationally hard TEQ should 
be performed per subchannel.
 
◾The absence of cyclic prefix makes FBMC-OQAM sensitive in time syn-
chronization errors. However, with the use of well-localized filters, FBMC-
OQAM is able to remain functional for low values of timing offsets.
FBMC-OQAM has been in the center of activities for several EU research projects 
(FP7 Project EMPhAtiC 2015; FP7 Project METIS 2015; FP7 Project PHYDYAS 
2010). This fact, along with its significant advantages, proves that FBMC-OQAM 
is a strong candidate for the role of the 5G waveform.

5.5 Universal Filtered Multicarrier
Universal Filtered Multicarrier (UFMC) (Vakilian et al. 2013) or Universal Filtered 
OFDM (UF-OFDM) (Wild et al. 2014) focuses on the drastic reduction of OFDM 
sidelobes. The main concept behind UFMC is to divide an OFDM waveform into 
components and filter each component individually.
Let us assume that the available bandwidth B contains N subcarriers. The 
overall bandwidth B is divided into M  subbands. Each subband contains Nm 
subcarriers with m

allowed to carry a different number of subcarriers; however, in the most common 
UFMC implementation, each group carries the same number of subcarriers, that is, 
N

 for all . This simplification allows the use of a critically sam-
pled uniform DFT filterbanks that will drastically reduce the filtering computational 
workload with the use of polyphase decomposition. On the other hand, a critically 
sampled uniform DFT bank excludes the use of filters with the PR property. In the 
following analysis, we will assume that the subcarrier groups are of equal size.
If x is the vector containing the data symbols, then the subvectors xm that 
contain the data symbols per subband are defined as

From Equation 5.38, it is clear, that despite the fact that M  DFT operations are 
performed, the computational workload is not increased, as the signals are zero-
padded. In fact, summation of the result of Equation 5.38 for all subbands will 
provide the OFDM equivalent signal.
At this point, data from all subbands have been transformed in the time domain

The filter is introduced in order to restrict the OOB emissions of the rectangular

the OFDM power spectral density is compared with the UFMC power spectral 
density (N =1024, M =16, L = 50).
In its original form, UFMC does not use cyclic prefix, although versions that 
consider the use of a cyclic extension have emerged (Zhang et al. 2016). UFMC

The window is introduced to relax timing synchronization requirements. Therefore, 
if we assume that a synchronization error exists, then the window will reduce ISI 
coming from the adjacent UFMC symbols. Nevertheless, the application of the 
window will also cause signal distortion. Windowing in the time domain is equiva-
lent to circular convolution in the frequency domain. The effect of convolution will 
be to increase ICI, especially among subcarriers of the same subband. Hence, when 
strict timing synchronization requirements are considered, windowing should be 
avoided. The receiving operations are presented in Figure 5.10.
After windowing, the receiver has to process N
L
+
−1 samples. From 
Equation 5.40, it is seen that due to the radio channel each UFMC symbol extends 
to N
L
U
+
+
−2 samples. This extension in the absence of the cyclic prefix will 
cause ISI. Therefore, in UFMC ISI cannot be completely mitigated as in OFDM. 
The receiver either isolates N

to extract them. Similarly to FBMC-OQAM, if the conditions of Equation 5.34 
apply, then ISI will be negligible and FEQ can be used.

the frequency domain samples for the mth subband. Subcarriers from other sub-
bands are omitted. It is reminded that odd samples from Equation 5.43 have been 
dropped. FEQ can now be applied to acquire estimates of the transmitted symbols.
Problems in UFMC operation may arise if: 
 
◾The filters fail to isolate each subchannel. Filtering breaks the orthogonality 
among subcarriers of different subbands. Poor filter design will cause ICI, 
especially for the edge subcarriers of each subband.
 ◾ISI and ICI will arise for highly selective and dispersive channels. Filter ramp-up 
and ramp-down will provide soft protection against highly frequency selective 
channels, because ISI will be attenuated. UFMC is expected to operate well, if 
the channel delay spread is less than a percentage of the filter length L.

5.5.1 Advantages and Disadvantages
UFMC has the following advantages: 
 
◾Due to low OOB emissions, UFMC provides higher spectral efficiency than 
OFDM. In addition, UFMC seems more appropriate for use in white spaces 
and cognitive radios.
 
◾Since no cyclic prefix is used, UFMC is more energy efficient than OFDM.
 
◾Filtering in UFMC is performed in groups of subcarriers, unlike FBMC-
OQAM where filtering is performed per subcarrier. This means that the 
filter length in UFMC is much shorter compared with FBMC-OQAM 
filters. As a result, UFMC is computationally more attractive and it is 
proved more suitable for low-latency, short-burst communications than 
FBMC-OQAM.
 
◾UFMC can be seen as a linear combination of filtered OFDM signals. Thus, 
the majority of algorithms (e.g., channel estimation, synchronization) used in 
the well-documented OFDM can be directly applied in UFMC.
 
◾UFMC is more robust than OFDM in frequency offsets and Doppler spreads 
due to filtering.
On the other hand, UFMC has the following disadvantages. 
 
◾It is inherently nonorthogonal. This means that under any circumstances 
interference between subcarriers will exist. Therefore, a noise floor appears 
that (depending on the quality of used filters) may impose constraints in the 
system performance.
 
◾UFMC may not use cyclic prefix; however, the signal is extended by L −1 
samples. This leads to spectral efficiency reduction compared with the perfor-
mance of FBMC-OQAM.
 
◾Similarly to FBMC-OQAM, UFMC provides soft protection from ISI. For 
highly selective channels, ISI levels will increase and FEQ may not be suitable 
for data symbol acquisition.
 ◾UFMC is more sensitive in frequency offsets than FBMC-OQAM. The UFMC 
filter is not able to protect subcarriers from the same group when frequency 
alignment is lost.
 
◾Since no cyclic prefix is used, UFMC is more sensitive in timing errors than 
OFDM. Windowing may be used to suppress their effects; however, ICI will 
be increased.

198 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
 
◾UFMC depends highly on internal tradeoffs. For example, high L will provide 
good subband isolation but it will decrease spectral efficiency. Windowing 
will relax timing requirements but will cause ICI, and so on.
UFMC was extensively studied from the EU project 5Gnow (5th-generation non- 
orthogonal waveforms for asynchronous signaling) and it was found more suitable 
for short-burst communications than other multicarrier modulation candidates.
5.6 Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing
Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) was introduced in Fettweis 
et al. (2009). GFDM is a generalization of OFDM with use of nonrectangular 
pulses. Its implementation relies on a conventional digital filter-bank. It was ini-
tially proposed as a modulation scheme targeting on the design of cognitive radio 
waveforms able to occupy white spaces of fragmented licensed spectrum. A com-
plete analysis of GFDM is presented in Michailow et al. (2014).
A basic differentiation of GFDM from OFDM and UFMC is the fact that it is 
a block modulation scheme. GFDM considers a time-frequency grid where multiple 
symbols are sequentially transmitted per subcarrier in time slots. If we assume that the 
block contains N  data symbols, then these symbols are organized in a grid of K  subcar-
riers and M  time slots each, that is, N
KM
=
. OFDM can be seen as a special case of 
GFDM where M =1 (one time symbol per subcarrier) and the rectangular pulse is used.
5.6.1 The GFDM Transmitter
The data symbols form a K
M
×
 matrix D, which is the GFDM block. The element 
dk m
,  of the matrix is the transmitted symbol at the mth time slot from the kth sub-
carrier. A prototype baseband filter g n
( ) is defined. Each data symbol is transmitted 
using a time and frequency shifted version of g n

(5.47)
It is noted that in the time domain circular shift is performed. The application of 
a circular pulse allows GFDM to embed the cyclic prefix in its operation and use 
FEQ due to the duality of circular convolution (in the time domain) with multipli-
cation (in the frequency domain). The inverse DFT exponents modulate the filter in 
a given subcarrier. As GFDM considers a critically sampled system, the time index 
for the GFDM block is n

5.6.2 Cyclic Prefix and OOB Radiation Control
As mentioned before, GFDM uses cyclic prefix to avoid ISI. Once again, the cost of 
cyclic prefix is spectrum and energy efficiency. On the other hand, the cyclic prefix 
transforms the linear convolution with the radio channel to circular enabling FEQ.

200 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
The use of the cyclic prefix and circular filtering introduces discontinuities, as 
the pulses at the edges of the block do not ramp-up/ramp-down. This leads to 
increased sidelobes and OOB emissions, despite the use of smoother pulses. Even 
so, GFDM outperforms OFDM in terms of OOB radiation. However, the use of 
windowed cyclic prefix is considered in order to reduce its sidelobes furthermore. 
The technique is known as pinching the block boundary (Bala et al. 2013).
When pinching the block boundary, we exploit the redundancy introduced 
by the cyclic prefix to apply a time domain window to the transmitted data. Each 
GFDM block in the time domain is multiplied by a window function w n
( ), that 
provides a smooth fade-in and fade-out for the block.
In order to understand the technique, an example is presented (Gaspar 2016). 
Let us assume the following window function w n

The initial block is multiplied with the window:

(5.52)
In the receiver side, after the signal acquisition, the NW  front samples are extracted 
and added at the tail part of the received block. The procedure reestablishes circular 
periodicity, in a similar manner with zero-prefix OFDM (Van Waterschoot et al. 
2010). The pinching the block boundary procedure is presented in Figure 5.12.
Another method to reduce OOB radiation is the insertion of guard sym-
bols (Deliverable D3.2 5G Waveform Candidate Selection 2015), (Matthé et al. 
2014). Assuming cyclic prefix length of rK r, ∈, the signal will remain constant 
at the block boundaries, if symbols carried at time slots 0 and M
r
− remain at 
a fixed value. Therefore, by setting the guard symbols to zero, the GFDM OOB 
emissions are strongly attenuated. The guard symbols introduce reduction in 
spectral efficiency by (
)
M
M
−2
. Nevertheless, for M  adequately high, the spec-
tral efficiency loss is negligible.

5.6.3 The GFDM Receiver
The receiver obtains time and frequency synchronization. Then, following the 
OFDM demodulation steps, the cyclic prefix is removed. In addition, the cyclic 
prefix has transformed the linear convolution of the signal with the channel to 
circular. Assuming that matrix H is a circular convolution matrix that contains the 
impulse response of the radio channel, the received block is given by

after equalization the signal is given by (zero-forcing equalization is assumed):

ever, if the selected filters are nonorthogonal, then ICI between subcarriers 
will be introduced.
 
◾Zero-forcing, where B

enhances noise and it may cause severe SNR degradation. It is noted that in 
some cases, A is not invertible.

5.6.4 Advantages and Disadvantages
The GFDM waveform has the following advantages: 
 
◾With the use of proper techniques, GFDM provides significant gain in the 
reduction of OOB emissions compared with OFDM.
 
◾GFDM is more robust than UFMC and OFDM in frequency offsets and 
Doppler spread.
 
◾GFDM uses cyclic prefix and it is fully protected from ISI inflicted by the 
radio channel, if the channel impulse response length is less than the cyclic 
prefix.
 
◾As the cyclic prefix exists, GFDM can take advantage of OFDM techniques 
and algorithms that utilize the cyclic prefix.
 
◾OFDM is a special case of GFDM. Therefore, a simple way to design efficient 
algorithms is to attempt to generalize their results for GFDM.
 
◾For non-orthogonal pulses, there are receiver designs that can help balance 
between ICI-ISI and noise enhancement.
On the other hand GFDM has the following disadvantages: 
 
◾GFDM without the use of guard symbols or pinching is clearly outperformed 
by UFMC and FBMC-OQAM in OOB radiation. The use of the aforemen-
tioned techniques will reduce OOB emissions; however, there is significant 
cost in spectral efficiency.
 
◾GFDM uses cyclic prefix and therefore it has the corresponding cost in 
spectral and energy efficiency.
 
◾Given the fact that each subcarrier is individually filtered, the filter length 
is generally larger than the corresponding length in UFMC, which leads 
to increased computational workload. Moreover, as GFDM benefits from 
large M  values, it does not perform well for low-latency and short-burst 
communications.
 
◾Orthogonality (in time and frequency) is not given for GFDM. It is noted 
that orthogonality in the critical rate cannot be achieved through compu-
tational efficient structures (e.g., uniform DFT polyphase banks). Thus, 
GFDM has to balance in the trade-off between increased complexity and 
ICI-ISI tolerance.

Multicarrier Modulation Schemes—Candidate Waveforms for 5G ◾ 203
5.7 Conclusion
In this chapter, an extensive presentation of the most popular multicarrier modu-
lation techniques (OFDM, FBMC-OQAM, UFMC, and GFDM) was provided. 
Each modulation has various advantages and disadvantages that depend on the way 
they manage the tradeoffs defined by the Balian–Low theorem. Besides the pre-
sented conventional approaches, a large number of modifications is found in the 
literature, that attempt to balance efficiently among the defined tradeoffs. From 
windowed OFDM (Achaichia et al. 2011), unique word OFDM (UW-OFDM 
[Hofbauer et al. 2010]) and WCP-COQAM (Lin and Siohan 2014) to TS-OQAM-
GFDM (Gasper et al. 2015) and single-carrier extensions (SC-FDMA [Long-Term 
Evolution (LTE) standard 2008]), research activity toward the definition of the 5G 
waveform is blossoming. Will the road to the 5G waveform be evolutionary with 
continuation of OFDM dominance due to its implementation advantages, or revo-
lutionary with the definition of an OFDM successor that balances efficiently among 
the challenges?

208 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Moreover, radio network planning optimization is the task that leads to a network 
configuration that achieves the best possible performance. Its development through 
time is mapped to the development of the radio access technologies and their cor-
responding limitations and capabilities. The first analogue radio networks had low 
capacity requirements and hence, radio network planning was entirely based on 
wide area coverage. As a consequence, omnidirectional antennas were used at base 
stations (BSs) positioned as high as possible (macrocells) so that the site density is 
kept low. For this reason, simple empirical pathloss propagation models such as 
Okumura–Hata and COST231 [1,2] were used for macrocellular coverage radio 
network planning. These were the early days of the over-simplified planning.
Together with the evolution of 2G digital systems, the site density increased 
due to higher capacity requirements, which also forced the transition of the cellular 
networks to cell splitting or sectorization. Strict requirements for increased spectral 
efficiency led to the adoption of several interference control mechanisms such as 
antenna tilting [3] and smart antennas [4].
Initially, the planning task involved only two issues: the number of BSs and 
their locations, also known as the radio BS location problem. In terms of the opti-
mization process, which usually includes cost optimization, it is one of the clas-
sical problems in the field of mathematical constrained optimization, along with 
constraints imposed by the radio access technology. Note that even the single BS 
location problem may be NP-hard in continuous space [5].
The radio BS location problem [6–8], the frequency assignment problem (mini-
mum cost-frequency assignment subject to assignment and interference constraints 
[9,10]), and the topological network design (minimum cost network topology able 
to connect the candidate BSs to a fixed telephone network [11]), are the three most 
widely studied problems in the context of radio network planning and optimization.
Although for 2G cellular systems, the network planning process could be divided 
into two generally unrelated processes, namely the coverage and capacity planning 
stages, this is not the case for 3G, 4G, and 5G systems, where capacity and coverage 
planning are highly interrelated and typically should be simultaneously treated. In 
2012, ~10% of the population was covered by 4G LTE systems, while projections 
show that this percentage will reach ~60% by 2018 [12] and by 2020, 50% of all 
broadband mobile subscriptions (~3.8 billions) will be LTE subscribers [13]. The 
plethora of data services (web browsing, social networking, audio, video, software 
downloading, etc.) offered even by current 4G LTE deployments, when combined 
with capacity “hungry” future applications (either in terms of required data rate, or in 
terms of numbers of supported users-devices, or both), lead to the need of an accurate 
forecast and geographical mapping of user throughput requirements, which is rather 
difficult to achieve. In addition, these requirements lead to mixed cell-structure 
deployments that comprise both high (macro) and low (relay, micro, femto) network 
nodes [14,15], as well as heterogeneous wireless system deployments.
However, small cell operation and deployment density is a challenging task 
that directly affects the overall interference in the network, and hence, they have 

RF Planning for Next-Generation Systems ◾ 209
a major impact on the allocation and configuration of macrocells, especially when 
 considered in the context of mixed or hierarchical cell structures. Furthermore, 
mixed cell structures entail major changes for the cell planning paradigm,  especially 
when seen in conjunction with energy efficiency and total cost.
The overall cost and complexity of a network directly relates to the number of 
BSs required to achieve the objectives of the provided services. Positioning BSs is 
not an easy task, while the optimal network deployment requires solving a complex 
optimization problem of combinatorial nature.
Although BS positioning dates back to the deployment of the first cellular 
wireless systems, the requirement for geographically inhomogeneous capacity pro-
vision, nowadays, has led to the adoption of hierarchical cell structures together 
with relays, where the cost significantly varies for the different deployments. One 
of the key characteristics of these systems with regards to the BS location issue is 
that the optimum solution can range from a small group of macrocells to a large 
set of microcells.
Overall network planning and optimization is an important research area with 
a considerable amount of published work ranging from BS location and cover-
age planning to antenna parameter conﬁguration and cell load balancing [16–18]. 
Moreover, green radio network planning via optimization of BS antenna pat-
terns and transmitted powers in heterogeneous 4G networks with geographically 
 inhomogeneous throughput requirements is not an easy problem to tackle, and 
hence, frequently omitted. Moreover, the initial phase of network dimensioning 
and planning often fails to meet growing throughput demands, and hence, net-
work operation becomes problematic, especially around hotspots (HSs).
In LTE systems where interference strongly interrelates capacity and cover-
age, network planning becomes even more complicated given this new constraint. 
In order to deal with such a complicated planning task, these criteria are most 
frequently targeted within an optimization framework. Related research targets, 
among other things, the optimal configuration of BS locations, antenna param-
eters, relaying, energy consumption, and cell load balancing [19–22]. Optimization 
of antenna-related parameters (e.g., TX power, antenna tilting, and azimuth orien-
tations of sectors) in LTE systems appeared recently in [23–25]. Nature-inspired 
optimization methods, in general, and evolutionary algorithms, more specifically, 
have recently gained interest in this field [20,23].
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows:
First, Section 6.2 describes the BS positioning problem in the context of mixed 
cell structures, Section 6.3 presents the simulation methodology, which includes 
the propagation, system and cost modules and Section 6.4 the BS location optimi-
zation algorithm.
In the context of this chapter, a rigorous generic LTE system model is employed 
that works for a general network topology and explicitly accounts for mixed cell 
structures and relay nodes (RNs) as well as nonuniform trafﬁc demand (HSs) [26,27]. 
Due to the modular approach that the simulation tool is developed, it provides the 

210 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
flexibility to consider more complex scenarios, for example, in the context of 5G sys-
tems with another underlying system model. In addition, a partially combinatorial 
optimization algorithm is used that exploits specific characteristics of the LTE sys-
tem in order to automatically identify an optimum solution that meets the operator’s 
requirements in terms of coverage and capacity in a given area, with the minimum 
number of BSs and hence, cost.
Following the BS location optimization analysis, Section 6.5 formulates the 
planning optimization problem with a multiobjective approach, and then describes 
in detail the green planning optimization algorithm.
Given the optimal BS locations, a well-established, multiobjective evolutionary 
algorithm (nonsorting dominated genetic algorithm-II, NSGA-II) is then used in 
order to identify in a stochastic manner the optimum solution for macro and micro 
BSs planning in terms of transmitted power settings, panning, and fanning, that is, 
altering the sector azimuth orientation and beamwidth, respectively. The algorithm 
can be used to provide an optimal LTE network configuration, that minimizes the 
total transmitted power in the test area given the coverage and capacity criteria. 
In order to test the presented methodology, scenarios of varying capacity require-
ments are employed, featuring a number of control nodes (CNs) and HSs. Given 
the emerging capacity problems caused most frequently by HSs, the optimization 
algorithm is applied to reconfigure the BS radiation patterns (it optimizes the BS 
antenna patterns with respect to their pointing direction, 3 dB beamwidth and 
transmitted power) and thus satisfy the set criteria using the most energy-efficient 
network setup with varying area capacity requirements.
Section 6.6 presents results both for location optimization and green planning. 
Results shown in Section 6.6.1 demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed BS loca-
tion optimization algorithm to achieve optimization for the planning triplet (cover-
age, capacity, cost), as well as a trend for solutions with very small cells if increased 
capacity is required.
Results in Section 6.6.2 show that the reconfigured network setup featured 
neatly adjusted radiation patterns, increased capacity capability, reduced network 
cost and energy consumption, and, most importantly, improved public safety with 
regards to reduced power emissions. Hence, the overall presented analysis achieves 
optimization for the quadruplet (coverage, capacity, cost, TX power).
6.2 The Cellular Layout
Naturally, the initial set of candidate BS locations is user supplied since they are 
usually locations where the operator has obtained planning permissions. It must 
be clarified here that the initial set of sites determines to a great extent the final 
solution as no additional locations are identified or added during the optimization 
process and the user selected positions are not modified. Nevertheless, this is the 

RF Planning for Next-Generation Systems ◾ 211
most meaningful choice because real-world radio network planning and site posi-
tioning are limited mainly from practical issues. A number of user supplied points 
or “ control nodes” (CNs) are used to represent the capacity and coverage require-
ments in the operational area [26–28].
Figure 6.1 shows a typical scenario employed to test the optimization algo-
rithm. The BS and the CN positions are almost uniformly distributed in a circular 
area of ~2.5 km2 radius, that is, the total urban area under study is ~20 Km2. Both 
uniform and nonuniform service requirements can be accommodated by choosing 
the percentage of CNs with specific data rate requirements.
Figure 6.2 shows that each macro BS employs three sectors pointing toward 
30°, 150°, and 270° in azimuth, while the radiation pattern from [30] is used for 
each sector. Between the different sectors, as well as in the directions of maximum 
power, each macrocell can also have omnidirectional RNs. If a CN cannot be con-
nected directly to a BS, then an RN is activated and the CN connects to a BS via 
the RN (mainly due to higher SINR and hence, lower bandwidth requirements, as 
it will be explained later). On the other hand, micro BSs are omnidirectional and 
they are not combined with RNs. The RNs are placed 800 m away from the BS, 
there are 96 CNs, and the candidate nodes are 74 microcells and 61 macrocells with 
366 RNs in the test area.

6.3 The Simulation Methodology
The simulation tool that was developed in order to solve the BS location optimiza-
tion problem consists of four main modules.
6.3.1 The Propagation Module
It employs the WINNER model for macro, micro, and RNs scenarios with 
the LOS distance set to 500 m [31]. The propagation parameters employed in

6.3.2 The System Module
We consider the downlink of an LTE heterogeneous network, that is, a mixed 
architecture with macrocells and microcells. Each microcell site comprises one BS, 
while each macrocell three sectors with one BS each. Assume that Bm is the set of 
all micro BSs, BM the set of all macro BSs and B is their union representing all the 
BSs available in the network area. The micro BSs employ omnidirectional anten-
nas, that is, the normalized antenna gain is A

Each CN is associated with a target throughput requirement. But the through-
put requirements of the kth CN (or HS), rk, corresponds to a specific number of 
resource blocks (RBs), nk, that the serving BS, bk, has to allocate to this link. Given 
that each BS has in total 100 RBs to allocate (20 MHz LTE system), the optimiza-
tion process proposed in this chapter takes into account that there is a limitation for 
the number of CNs that each BS can serve. This limitation is considered for both 
optimization problems formulated in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.
The number of required RBs per CN (or HS), nk, depends on the channel 
quality indicator (CQI) and rank index (RI) feedback [33] of the CN (or HS) 
along with its specific rate requirement (rk). In the context of this work, [34] is 
used in order to map the calculated SINR of Equation 6.1 to a CQI value, and 
Table 7.2.3-1 of [33] in order to map the CQI value to a specific modulation order 
(Qm) and CR.
More specifically: 
 
1. The SINR calculated at the CN is mapped to a single CQI value using [34].
 
2. The CQI is mapped to a proper modulation level (Qm) and CR. This mapping 
is derived according to Table 7.2.3-1 of [33].
 
3. Equation 6.2 estimates the number of RBs, nk, required by the kth CN.

per RB set to 126 (one antenna port and the control format indicator set to 3). Clearly, 
the better the SINR at the CN side, the higher the modulation level and CR that the 
system can support, leading to fewer RBs.
When the CN (or HS) is connected to an RN, Equation 6.1 is again employed 
but now bk is the macro BS serving the RN at backhaul. The RNs are considered 
to be out-band, that is, the backhaul link uses different bandwidth resources from 
the access link. The RBs needed by the users connected to an RN are subtracted 
from the pool of RBs of the corresponding BS to prevent intracell downlink inter-
ference. It should be noted that for the purposes of this work a capacity calculation 
module was developed that uses the SINR, as calculated in Equation 6.1, along 
with the rate requirements of each CN/HS, and returns either the number of neces-
sary RBs as in Equation 6.2, or a NaN value if the SINR is too low to support any 
 throughput [26].
6.3.3 The Cost Module
A set of BSs and RNs is considered as a possible solution when it can provide the 
bandwidth resources according to the SINR and data rate request, as well as cover-
age to all the control nodes. For each solution, the deployment cost is calculated. 
Given that macrocells are much more expensive to deploy than microcells and 
RNs, appropriate corresponding weights (×20, ×2, and ×1) are applied, respec-
tively. These weights measure the relative total cost (capital and operational expen-
ditures) for each antenna type (see Chapter 8 in [36]).

(6.3)
Note that the cost of a macrocell is considered to be the same irrespective of the 
number of active sectors. Also, the user can change the relative cost of each BS, 
based on additional criteria (e.g., if a possible site is an existing 3G site it costs less 
than a BS in a completely new site). Among the produced solutions, the one with 
the minimum weighted cost is preferred.
6.4 The BS Location Optimization Algorithm
The proposed BS location optimization algorithm follows a partially combina-
torial approach. Similar approaches have been used for automatically locating 
BSs for 2G systems with coverage and traffic criteria [28,36]. The combination 
approach fits perfectly with the idea of preselected antenna positions. The idea 
is that if all possible combinations of BS positions are examined, the optimum 

216 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
combination for this set of BSs will be found. However, the number of combina-
tions dramatically increases as the number of possible locations is increased. To 
avoid this problem the algorithm segments the total number of possible locations 
into smaller groups, which are randomly selected, and for each smaller group a 
search for solution is performed. This procedure of searching for solutions into 
smaller random groups of candidate BSs is performed for a large number of itera-
tions (user defined).
A rather peculiar thing with heterogeneous systems is that the optimum 
solution can be anything between a small group of macrocells and a large num-
ber of microcells. As a consequence, the algorithm cannot be based on continu-
ously examining exhaustively smaller groups of BSs in order to find a better 
solution since, for example, in some cases a cheaper solution can be produced if 
an expensive macrocell is replaced by a (small) number of microcells. As a result, 
the algorithm must continuously examine relatively large groups of candidate 
BSs. This, however, means prohibited large number of possible combinations (up 
to the order of several millions). In order to keep the number of examined com-
binations manageable, every time the number of combinations reaches a pre-
defined threshold, a BS is removed from the group of candidates, as illustrated 
in the Pseudocode of Figure 6.3. This is possibly the main advancement with 
respect to the initial approach presented in [26] where the algorithm searches 
for the solution with the minimum number of BSs, and from them, the set with 
the smaller cost is chosen.
As also shown in Figure 6.3 (in Check_for_a_Solution), the algorithm exam-
ines a combination of possible BSs, only if its cost is equal or smaller than the 
cost of the existing solutions. Then it checks if all CNs are covered, that is, if the 
received power is above the threshold of −95 dBm, as calculated by the LTE link 
budget. Although this is a relatively high threshold that corresponds to a link 
with a large bandwidth allocation, as coverage at the control nodes is essential, 
it is reasonable to keep the power threshold at this high level. If any CNs are not 
covered, then the proposed solution is invalid, and the algorithm proceeds to the 
next combination of possible BSs.
If the solution passes the coverage test, the SINR and the required RBs for all 
possible links are calculated. The CNs covered by only one BS are the first to be 
allocated to a BS (microcell or macrocell sector). Then, starting from the CNs, 
which require the highest number of RBs, each CN is allocated to the BS with 
the best link (i.e., the highest SINR). If this BS has not enough RBs available, the 
next BS is considered, until there are no BSs left. If a CN cannot be served by any 
of the BSs, the solution is invalid. If all CNs are allocated to BSs, the combination 
is stored as one possible solution and the algorithm continues the search (for other 
solutions with equal or smaller total cost) until a predefined number of trials that 
guarantees convergence is reached (e.g., 2000).

6.5 Transmit Power Minimization for Green Planning
The goal here is to exploit the reconfigurability of the BS antenna radiation pat-
terns in order to minimize the transmitted power in the entire network area, with 
the coverage and capacity constraints set by CNs and HSs. For this reason, a net-
work planning algorithm is proposed that performs adaptive panning and fanning 
(see Figure 6.4), while adjusting the transmitted power of each sector, as well as 
microcell, in order to minimize the total transmitted power of the network. The final 
solution of the algorithm comprises the “greener” power allocation to the network 
BSs that can also meet capacity and coverage criteria. Equations 6.4 through 6.7 
formulate the problem.

Finally, in Equation 6.6 Kb is the set of CNs that are served by the bth BS. The 
minimum received power constraint in Equation 6.5 is the coverage requirement 
for the kth network CN/HS, calculated via a typical LTE link budget. The con-
straints in Equations 6.6 and 6.7 set the LTE limit for the maximum number of 
RBs per BS and the CN throughput requirements, respectively.
The proposed solution is based on genetic algorithms (GAs), which are popular 
stochastic optimization methods, as they can deal with problems with a vast and 
complex search space. The standard GA or its advanced versions (steady state GA, 
distributed GA, and NSGA-II) have been used for the optimum BS location [20] or 
cell planning [37] problems. The stochastic methodology used here for LTE plan-
ning applies the NSGA-II, a standard for evolutionary multiobjective optimization 
that has been shown to outperform other alternatives [38]. NSGA-II belongs to 
the group of multiobjective approaches that aim to converge to a pareto front, that 
is, a certain percentage of GA population that is optimal given the different opti-
mization objectives. LTE planning is a multiobjective problem since coverage and 
capacity must be satisfied, while the total transmitted power in the whole network 
is minimized.

Note that the minimum allowed value for the transmitted power is –Inf. This way 
we can consider the scenario where one BS (macro or micro) can be switched off.
6.5.1 The Algorithm: minPower
GA applies biologically inspired operators on a randomly chosen initial population 
of candidate solutions, in order to minimize a cost function. After GA initializa-
tion, the operators of selection, cost function evaluation, and crossover or mutation 
are iteratively applied in order to produce new offsprings. This continues until GA 
convergences, and in the case of NSGA-II this corresponds to an optimal pareto 
front. All operators applied as well as the multiobjective function used here are 
described next.
Initialization: An initial population of N pop random chromosomes is created. 
Each chromosome represents a candidate solution for the tasks of panning, 
fanning, and transmitted power setting for the macro BSs, and transmit-
ted power setting for the micro BSs. Given that |BM| macro BSs (sectors) 
and |Bm| micro BSs exist in the area setup, each chromosome is a mask of 
N = 3 × |BM| + |Bm| integers: 3 settings to optimize (orientation, beam-
width, and power) for each of the |BM| sectors and 1 setting (power) for each 
micro. Each integer corresponds to a possible value either for orientation, 
beamwidth, or power (e.g., for a macro sector with a default orientation 30°, 
[−3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3] maps to [0° 10° 20° 30° 40° 50° 60°], see Equation 6.9).
Evaluation: The constraints of Equations 6.5 through 6.7 are translated to cer-
tain objectives in the GA method, and considered within the multiobjective 
function F to be minimized Equation 6.11. Each of the chromosomes in the 
current (initial or next) population is evaluated as follows:
 
1. The selected settings for macro BS panning/fanning and transmitted 
power, as implied by the chromosome are identified.
 
2. Each CN/HS is assigned serially to all active BSs (Ptx >  ̶Inf) that can 
cover it (Prx  ≥  ̶95 dBm) and all possible SINR values are calculated. Each 
CN/HS is then assigned to the BS antenna providing the best SINR.
 
3. Given the allocation of CNs/HSs to BS antennas, the number of RBs 
used per CN/HS are calculated in the capacity module, as described ear-
lier. The total RBs used by each BS are also calculated.
 
4. The F function evaluates the solution encoded in the chromosome: it 
measures the total transmitted power in the network (Equation 6.11, 
F(1)). Two other mechanisms embedded in the calculation of the F func-
tion (Equation 6.11, F(2), F(3)) evaluate if the finally proposed subset 
of antennas can serve all CNs/HSs in terms of coverage and required 
throughput. Thus, F(2) considers the number of CNs/HSs that have been 
assigned a NaN value as number of RBs allocated to them. This can be 

RF Planning for Next-Generation Systems ◾ 221
considered both as coverage and throughput. Finally, no more than the 
maximum 100 RBs can be used per BS (capacity criterion). The extra 
number of RBs (>100) needed per BS is summarized for all BSs and is 
the F(3) value.

Selection: The selection operator selects, through a tournament selection 
scheme [38], the chromosomes to participate next in the operators of cross-
over and mutation. This is done after a nondominating sorting of chromo-
somes in the current population based on the F values (a chromosome is 
said to dominate another if its objective functions are no worse than the 
others and at least one of its objective functions is better than the others). 
The nondominated sorting produces the pareto front (a predefined frac-
tion of population is applied), while the rest of the population is sorted in 
a dominated manner [38].
Crossover/Mutation: Given the selection of chromosomes to participate in cross-
over and mutation operators, these two chromosome variation operators are 
applied. The application of these variation parameters will produce the next 
offspring, a new population of candidate solutions that has the same size 
as the initial population. The crossover operator mates random pairs of the 
selected chromosomes (binary crossover), while integers within a chromo-
some can be mutated (change to alternative value).
The whole procedure (population evaluation and selection, crossovers/mutations) is 
repeated until the stopping criterion of nonimproving the pareto front is reached 
(average pareto spread and distance criteria are used [38]). The algorithm outputs 
a series of solutions corresponding to the pareto front that minimize the F func-
tion. If the coverage and capacity criteria are met, the best solution will feature 
F(2) = F(3) = 0 and a total transmitted power calculated as F(1) value. In some cases, 
solutions satisfying the criteria but corresponding to different designs of the same 
cost values could be outputted. The user could then consider any of those solutions. 
In case that coverage and capacity criteria cannot be met (F(2) > 0 and/or F(3) > 0), 
the pareto front will include the best possible solutions, each one outperforming the 
other for at least one of the three objectives.

0.5 Mbps/CN (2.4 Mbps/Km2) one macrocell (3 sectors/BSs) is capable of cover-
ing the whole area. Hence, when capacity is not an issue, coverage can be provided 
by just a single (or a few for larger areas) macrocell. Due to the symmetry of the 
problem, the algorithm picked the macrocell in the center of the set-up and each 
CN connects to the sector that illuminates its position. This may very well be the 
scenario for an umbrella cell in a hierarchical cell structure, where the large cell sup-
ports all the problematic situations, for example, fast handovers, sudden power loss 
due to the street corner effect, coverage or capacity “holes,” and so on.
However, in order to support higher data rates more BSs are needed as shown 
in Figure 6.5b, where in order to provide 1 Mbps/CN (4.8 Mbps/Km2), the solu-
tion consists of three macrocells. As the data rate increase further, the microcells 
prevail as shown with Figure 6.5c. As the cost of each microcell is just 10% of the 
cost of a macrocell, the whole area is covered with 31 microcells, and at the same 
time there are enough resources (RBs) to satisfy the need for higher data rates. 
Moreover, the lower transmitted power of microcells does not cause high levels of 
interference between the BSs, as well as contributes toward a more “green” network 
planning approach.
Hence, for 28.8 Mbps/Km2 or 6 Mbps/CN, the solution consists of 34 micro-
cells (Figure 6.5c). If we force the algorithm not to choose microcells, as many 
as 8 macrocells (24 BSs) with 30 RNs are needed, as shown in Figure 6.6a. This 
solution is far more expensive as Figure 6.6b illustrates, where the cost of the dif-
ferent solutions is shown (relatively to the more expensive solution) as the capacity 
requirement varies from 0.5 to 6 Mbps per CN (i.e., from 48 to 576 Mbps in the

whole area). It can be clearly seen that in the optimization process the cost signifi-
cantly increases when macrocells and RNs are exclusively considered.
For the same aforementioned scenarios, when microcells are also included, the 
algorithm soon turns to solutions with microcells only, due to the considerably 
smaller cost. In this case, as the capacity requirement increases from 0.5 to 6 Mbps 
per CN, the number of microcells remains practically unchanged (31–34 micro-
cells are used) as the coverage requirement for the whole area must be fulfilled from 
the beginning, irrespective of the capacity requirements. As expected, microcells 
are not as good for coverage limited problems (i.e., up to 96 Mbps in the 20 Km2 
area), but they seem to be a clear winner for higher values of data rates. Indeed, 
microcells can provide ~600 Mbps to the whole area with just 32% of the cost of 
macrocells.
Figure 6.7 illustrates the solution for a case with inhomogeneous capacity 
requirements where 10% of the CNs need tenfold data rate (HSs), that is, 88.5 Mbps 
in total for the whole area. In the proposed solution, apart from three macrocells, a 
microcell is placed close to HSs, while a couple of RNs are also used to serve nearby 
HSs or other CNs with better SINR (less resources) so that their sector can allocate 
the necessary RBs to distant HSs. Nevertheless, if the total capacity requirement 
further increases, the algorithm produces solutions using only microcells, as in the 
case of the homogeneous scenarios. This is not only due to the significantly lower 
cost of small cells, but also due to smaller interference between BSs, and consider-
ably more planning flexibility.

Finally, Figure 6.8 shows results for the high-capacity scenario (6 Mbps/CN) 
when the macro BSs employ 4 × 4 MIMO. The algorithm has produced a solution 
with half of the BSs and no RNs, compared to Figure 6.6a. Although the cost of 
the 4 × 4 MIMO BS is obviously higher than the conventional BS, it is clear that 
MIMO deployment will reduce the overall cost of the network due to the reduction 
of the required BSs.
6.6.2 Green Planning Results
Based on the BS location optimization algorithm in the 2.5  km × 2.5  km 
(6.25 km2) test area that is considered in this section, four candidate macro cell sites 
(12 BSs) and two candidate micro cell sites (2 BSs) are available in order to satisfy 
the throughput requirements of 64 CNs and 9 HSs, representing users or clusters 
of users (Figure 6.9). Various settings of data throughput were tested for the same 
setup, corresponding to (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2) Mbps/CN, ×10 for HSs, respectively, 
and summing up a capacity requirement equal to approximately (9.5, 14, 18.5, 23, 
46.5) Mbps/km2. The minPower planning algorithm (Npop = 5000) was applied in 
order to identify the network configuration with the minimum total transmitted 
power that also satisfies the coverage and capacity constraints.
For the various capacity requirements, the multiobjective GA converged to the 
optimal solution within 150 generations (up to 7 hours execution on a 12-CPU 
machine [2.3 GHz/CPU, 24 GB memory]). Figure 6.10 presents the BSs selected

to serve CNs/HSs and their transmitted power for the various capacity require-
ments. Results show that when capacity increases, the number of BSs and/or BS 
transmitted powers also increase (only for the two low capacity requirements, that 
is, 9.5 and 14 Mbps/km2, the algorithm resulted to the same network configura-
tion). It is shown that 9 macro BSs (out of 12) and both the micro BSs (with maxi-
mum power) are necessary to cover the capacity requirement of 46.5 Mbps/km2. 
This is the maximum throughput that the setup of available macro/micro sites and 
CNs/HSs in Figure 6.9 permits. Results of the minPower algorithm not presented 
here show that more RBs (F(2)>0) would have to be allocated for capacity demands 
higher than 2 Mbps/CN (×10 for HSs) due to interference, even for the optimal 
configurations (this is possible if more bandwidth is allocated, e.g., in the context 
of a 5G system). For instance, the setting of 2.3 Mbps/CN (53.5 Mbps/km2) would 
need 10 more RBs (F(2) = 10) for the best solution that exploits all the available 
BSs (macro and micro).
We choose here to present in detail the solution provided by the minPower 
algorithm for the throughput setting 0.8 Mbps/CN (×10 for HSs), corresponding 
to 18.5 Mbps/km2, as it provides some useful insights. For comparison reasons, we 
have applied an additional stochastic algorithm, previously proposed in [27], which 
selects the setup of minimum cost on the basis of relative cost for sites (×20 for 
macrocell, ×2 for microcell, [27], Chapter 8 in [36]). This algorithm, named here 
minCost, is applied on a macro/microcell site basis, that is, it cannot select single

The solution provided by the minPower algorithm employs only three single 
macro BSs (belonging to two separate macro sites) and the two available micros, a 
solution with a total relative cost equal to 44 (see Figure 6.12 for the solution, and 
Table 6.3 for details on the optimum antenna pattern and RBs used). The solution 
provided by the minPower algorithm transmits far less total power in the whole 
area than the one provided by the minCost algorithm (22%), and has less total rela-
tive cost as well (69%).
Furthermore, the regions colored white in Figures 6.11 and 6.12 are the areas 
where the received power exceeds the “strict” safety threshold Prx,max
bio  = –52.7 dBm* 
as proposed in [39]. It can be observed that the minPower algorithm provides a 
solution that features a smaller area exceeding the safety threshold compared to the 
one provided by the minCost algorithm.
With regards to the solution of the minPower algorithm in Figure 6.12, it 
is observed that the HSs in the center of the area led to the use of both micros, 
 however, with a reduced power. All CNs in the upper left corner are served by 
Sector 1.1, which had to simultaneously broaden its beamwidth (

to be served by the distant Sector 3.1. Even though this sector is transmitting

CNs. Although m2 serves fewer HSs than m1, it transmits 11 dB more power. 
This is due to  interference from Sector 3.1, which ends up serving CNs that are 
located closer to m2. Finally, Sector 3.2 increased its directivity, but at the same 
time steered its beam 30° to the left, reducing the interference levels toward m2 
and Sector 1.1.
It has to be noted here that the initial setup with the default antenna pattern 
values tops up to 18.5 Mbps/km2, utilizing 3 out of 4 macro sites (Figure 6.11), 
while the remaining macro resources cannot contribute anything more due to 
interference. However, the minPower algorithm exploits more degrees of freedom 
and finds solutions to the interference problem by neatly adjusting the antenna

patterns of the separate BSs. As a result it can provide setups with capacity up to 
46.5 Mbps/km2 (Figure 6.10).
Figure 6.13 compares the total transmitted power (W) and the total relative 
cost for the five capacity scenarios (Mbps/km2) tested herein. As expected, the 
total transmitted power in the network increases with the throughput require-
ments, but this is not the case for the relative total cost. As we can see from 
Figure 6.13, the total cost of the network configuration for 18.5 Mbps/km2 is less 
than that of 14 or even 9.5 Mbps/km2. This is due to the nature of the minPower 
algorithm. Specifically, the transition from the 2nd to the 3rd scenario requires 
to switch off 1 macro site and to switch on 1 micro site. But since a micro site 
costs 10 times less than a macro site, the total relative cost of the network drops. 
On the other hand, two of the BSs in this scenario need to transmit in full power 
(46 dBm, see Table 6.3), raising the total transmit power to ~80 W. Hence, joint 
optimization of both power and cost, emerges as another option that will be 
addressed in future work.
Figure 6.14 shows the energy consumption rate (ECR) (power/throughput, 
Watt/Mbps) for the different capacity requirements. The results show that the ECR 
improves for increasing capacity, which proves that there is room for considerable 
improvement that the minPower algorithm can offer to the network, if considered 
in the planning and optimization process.

7.1 Introduction
One of the core integral parts of 5G systems will be based on multiantenna systems 
and the corresponding multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architectures. 
MIMO technology offers an unprecedented performance enhancement to wire-
less systems. The prospective characteristics of the next-generation systems include 
cooperation among base stations (BSs), called coordinated multipoint (CoMP), 3D 
beamforming capabilities offered by 2D antenna arrays, also called full-dimension 
MIMO (FD-MIMO), large-scale antenna systems, also called massive-MIMO sys-
tems, and millimeter wave communications combined with MIMO features, called 
mm-Wave-MIMO systems.
The inclusion of MIMO capabilities in wireless systems was evidenced around 
2006 in WiFi and then in 3G cellular networks (Andrews et  al. 2014). IEEE 
802.11n, IEEE 802.11ac, LTE, and WiMAX are the systems where the MIMO 
techniques were consolidated. Especially in LTE, several MIMO variations have 
been proposed from the early releases of 3GPP standardization activities up to the 
current release 13, encompassing all the latest advancements in wireless communi-
cations theory.
The use of multiple antennas at one end of the link was known for many years 
to offer the advantages of diversity, as well as beamforming capabilities. By exploit-
ing the spatial domain and putting many antenna elements at either the transmitter 
(multiple-input single-output, MISO) or the receiver (single-input multiple- output, 
SIMO) one can get spatial diversity gain, that is, improved error performance in

fading channels compared to single-input single-output (SISO) systems. With 
the beamforming operation, the power of the desired signal is enhanced whereas, 
unwanted interference signals are suppressed, thus providing increased signal-to-
interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The introduction of multiple antennas at 
both link ends, either concentrated or distributed, leads to the MIMO systems 
and may offer extra gains, the most important of which is the spatial multiplexing 
gain. Therefore, MIMO techniques increase system performance since they offer 
improved reliability, by applying space-time coding techniques to combat fading 
and/or increased throughput by applying spatial multiplexing techniques to exploit 
multipath components in rich scattering environments. Depending on the knowl-
edge of channel state information (CSI) available at the receiver (CSIR) and/or the 
transmitter (CSIT), various communication techniques have been proposed and 
different performance gains are achieved.
Although the benefits of MIMO techniques were well-known for decades 
(Sibille et al. 2010), the first attempts to describe the gains in practical systems 
were recorded twenty years ago in the works of Paulraj and Kailath (1994), and 
Foschini and Gans (Foschini 1996; Foschini and Gans 1998). On the same period, 
Alamouti (1998), Tarokh et al. (1998) published landmark papers on space-time 
coding techniques. In 1999, Telatar for the first time set the framework for the 
investigation of the capacity offered in MIMO channels as well as its connection 
to the eigenvalues’ distribution of random Wishart matrices (Telatar 1999). All the 
promised gains were conditioned on the so called favorable propagation conditions, 
that is, under the assumption of perfectly uncorrelated Rayleigh independent and 
identically distributed (i.i.d.) channels.
The use of multiple antennas at the BS or access point (AP) and the user 
equipment (UE) was also called point-to-point MIMO or single-user MIMO 
(SU-MIMO). Full CSIT is not feasible for practical SU-MIMO systems and, there-
fore, the communication techniques assume CSIR only, as shown in Figure 7.1a. 
Although for a single user this scenario offers a gain equal to the number of the 
equivalent parallel data streams that are multiplexed, the gain is constrained to 
favorable propagation conditions, which unfortunately is not true in realistic envi-
ronments, especially at cell edges. Moreover, the multiplexing gain is  limited by the 
number of antennas the UE is equipped with. A different approach to exploit the 
spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) is the MU-MIMO systems, (Caire and Shamai 
2003; Vishwanath et  al. 2003; Viswanath and Tse 2003). In MU-MIMO, the 
channel is spatially shared by the users, that is, MU-MIMO is a spatial multiple 
access technique where the BS is equipped with M  antennas and the K  users may 
have one or more antennas. The former is depicted in Figure 7.1b. The multiple 
antennas at the BS offer not only diversity gain but also the required DoF to spa-
tially separate the users. The multiplexing gain equals the sum of the number of 
parallel data streams and it is limited by the number of BS antennas. The great 
advantage of MU-MIMO systems comes with the strong requirement for full CSI 
knowledge at the transmitter, since the precoding technique should cope with the 

238 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
multiuser interference. This implies the necessity for a feedback mechanism from 
the UE to the BS. In practical systems a major issue is the trade-off between feed-
back accuracy and uplink resources consumption. Moreover, the optimum trans-
mit strategy in the downlink involves a theoretical interference pre-cancellation 
technique known as dirty paper coding (DPC) combined with user scheduling and 
power loading algorithm. Therefore, the complexity is increased and sub-optimum 
techniques have been proposed. In Section 7.3 several techniques for the broad-
cast channel (BC), that is, the downlink channel, and the multiple access channel 
(MAC), that is, the uplink channel, are discussed.
The term coordinated multipoint (CoMP) has been used widely for schemes 
where several transmission points cooperate to jointly design the Tx/Rx structure 
or to optimize the resource allocation from a global rather than a local perspective 
(Lee et al. 2012; Cui et al. 2014). A CoMP system can be considered as a large-scale 
MIMO system with several distributed antenna groups. Coordinated transmis-
sion from multiple BSs to their UE is very effective in mitigating the interference

in multicell systems. There are several variations proposed in the literature for the 
implementation of CoMP techniques, which attempt to overcome the limitations 
imposed by synchronization issues, the large information exchange among BSs and 
the uncoordinated interference in dense cellular networks. Section 7.4 deals with 
these techniques.
Massive-MIMO is one of the key technologies that will manifest the arrival 
of 5G era. It is a direct extension of MU-MIMO systems where hundreds of 
antennas are placed at the BS, simultaneously serving many tens of terminals in 
the same time-frequency resource (Marzetta 2010). This increase in BS antennas 
offers a tremendous advantage in the propagation conditions of the links, called 
favorable propagation; the vector channels from the BS antenna array to the vari-
ous UE are asymptotically orthogonal as the number of antennas at the BS, M, 
grows to infinity. The direct implication of this feature is that linear precoding/
decoding techniques can be used, offering reduced complexity in hardware and 
signal processing techniques. Since massive-MIMO is a large scale MU-MIMO 
system, it relies on spatial multiplexing, that is, on the BS having adequate chan-
nel knowledge, on both the UL and the DL. This, as explained in detail in Section 
7.5, implies that a time-division-duplex (TDD) technique is favorable. The large 
number of antennas allows for focusing energy into very small regions of space to 
bring huge improvements in throughput and radiated energy efficiency. There is 
an increasing interest in the wireless community for massive-MIMO systems and 
there are already pilot systems that bespoke the advantages (Rusek et al. 2013; 
Vieira et al. 2014). Nevertheless, there are still few issues to be addressed before 
the BSs are swamped with antennas (Larsson et al. 2014). The most known is 
the pilot contamination problem in realistic multicell networks and the chan-
nel reciprocity assumed in TDD operation, which are discussed in Section 7.5 
(Figure 7.2).
Full-dimension MIMO (FD-MIMO) utilizes a large number of antennas in a 
2D array configuration to implement spatially separated links to a large number 
of users (Kim et al. 2014; Razavizadeh et al. 2014). It constitutes an intermediate 
phase toward the massive-MIMO systems and a special study item has been setup 
and concluded by 3GPP recently for inclusion into Release 13 (3GPP ). So far 3GPP 
activities have mostly considered antenna arrays that exploit the azimuth dimen-
sion. 3GPP with this study investigates how two-dimensional antenna arrays can 
further improve the LTE spectral efficiency by also exploiting the vertical dimen-
sion for beamforming and MIMO operations. The key features of FD-MIMO, 
the architectures, CSI feedback, and 3D channel modeling issues are discussed in 
Section 7.6.
In the absence of free available spectrum in the sub-6 GHz bands, the research-
ers have focused in the millimeter wave frequencies (30–300 GHz) where there is 
a plenty of underutilized bandwidth for cellular access technologies (Rappaport 
et al. 2013b; Roh et al. 2014; Hur et al. 2016). The significantly expanded channel 
bandwidth will allow for increased data rates and reduced latency, whereas, large 

240 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
antenna arrays of very high gain can be placed in really small dimensions and can 
be used to keep the antenna aperture constant, thus eliminating the frequency 
dependent pathloss and/or the increased noise bandwidth. Moreover, the  mm-Wave 
technology is expected to help realize massive-MIMO systems. The introduction 
of mm-Wave technology in 5G systems affects not only the hardware and the cor-
responding components but also the channel modeling approach and the signal 
processing techniques (Heath et al. 2016). All the challenges related to mm-Wave 
MIMO systems are discussed in Section 7.7.

. The element hji of the channel matrix 
denotes the complex channel gain for the symbol transmission from the ith trans-
mit antenna to the jth receive antenna. The typical assumption for the channel 
matrix elements is that they are i.i.d. complex Gaussian random variables with zero 
mean and unit variance. The precoder maps the input data streams to the transmit 
antennas, whereas the postcoder processes the signals from the receive antennas 
and estimates the input data streams. The signal given in Equation 7.1 is a compos-
ite signal and the detection of a stream suffers from interstream interference. This 
model presents a vector Gaussian channel and the main question in spatial multi-
plexing MIMO systems is how to transmit and receive with multiple antennas and 
achieve an equivalent system of multiple parallel independent subchannels. If the 
columns of matrix H were orthogonal, then one could multiply the received signal 
with the complex conjugate of the column of H that corresponds to the stream 
to be detected and all the remainder streams would be zeroed. Nevertheless, the 
channel is random and the columns will not in general be orthogonal. Therefore, 
we need an equivalent technique to decompose the vector channel to independent

parallel scalar subchannels. This is achieved with the singular value decomposition 
(SVD) of the channel matrix. The basic assumption is that the channel is perfectly 
known at both the transmitter and the receiver. The SVD is used to decompose 
the channel matrix and write it in terms of a product of three matrices, that is,

Matrix ΣΣ is diagonal and therefore each output signal contains only one input 
 signal. There are RH SISO channels each of which consists of a scaled version of the 
transmitted signal plus noise. RH is the rank of matrix H. As shown in Figure 7.4, 
one can transmit RH independent data streams toward the directions of the eigen-
vectors of matrix H H
H
. This is why we call it eigenbeamforming.
The requirement of channel knowledge at the transmitter (CSIT) in eigenbeam-
forming is a quite strict one. When CSIR only is assumed, then more practical 
architectures may be utilized. A well known family of spatial multiplexing tech-
niques is the layered space time (Foschini 1996). In horizontal encoding Bell Labs 
Layered Space Time (H-BLAST) architecture (Foschini et al. 2003), the informa-
tion bit stream is demultiplexed to Nt substreams and each substream is coded, 
modulated and interleaved, and then transmitted by an antenna. The relationship 
of substreams and antennas remains fixed in time. The maximum achievable diver-
sity gain is Nr. In vertical encoding BLAST architecture (V-BLAST) (Wolniansky 
et al. 1998), the bit stream is initially coded, modulated and interleaved, then is 
demultiplexed to Nt substreams and each substream is transmitted by an antenna. 
As each info bit is transmitted by Nt antennas and received by Nr antennas, the 
diversity gain is at maximum N N
t
r. This implies greater complexity. In diagonal 
BLAST (D-BLAST) the architecture is a combination of the two techniques. The 
bit stream is horizontally encoded and the substreams enter a block that performs 
stream rotation in a round-robin fashion before entering the antennas. Thus, the 
substreams from the conventional encoders are distributed over space and the big 
advantage is the improved spatial diversity. Indeed, D-BLAST can achieve diversity 
gain greater than Nr and up to N N
t
r. The complexity of D-BLAST is the main 
problem compared to H-BLAST and V-BLAST.

7.2.1 Linear Receivers for Spatial Multiplexing
In spatial multiplexing MIMO systems the optimum receiver would be the maxi-
mum likelihood (ML) receiver. The main issue is that we cannot decompose the 
problem in scalar problems, since the columns of H are not orthogonal and we have 
to perform joint detection. The complexity of ML decoding exponentially increases 
with the number of receive antennas. Therefore, suboptimum in terms of diversity 
order, techniques with decreased complexity have been developed.
7.2.1.1 Zero-Forcing Receiver
The zero forcing (ZF) receiver, called also decorrelator or interference nulling receiver, 
attempts to cancel out the interstream interference using the Moore-Penrose pseudo-
inverse of the channel matrix H. This matrix is either the left inverse of matrix H, 
that is, H H

(7.3)
The interference is forced to zero and we can detect each stream separately 
with an ML detector. The difference of ZF and Maximal Ratio (Combining or 
Transmission) is that in maximal ratio techniques we premultiply H with HH and 
not H+. Therefore, if the columns of H are orthogonal, the result is the same. But 
in general this is not true. The maximal ratio is also called matched filtering (MF).

It is proved that compared to ZF, the MMSE receiver avoids noise amplification but 
suffers from remaining interference. Overall, the performance of MMSE is better 
than that of ZF.

244 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
7.2.1.3 Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation
A method to improve the performance of linear detection techniques is the 
ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC). It is a series of linear 
receivers, for example, ZF or MMSE, each of which detects one of the parallel 
streams, where the detected streams are successively subtracted by the received 
signal. Hence, at each step of the method we subtract from the received signal 
the detected stream and we send for subsequent detection the signal with the 
reduced interference.
7.2.2 Capacity
MIMO systems are classified according to channel knowledge at the transmitter 
into either closed loop, when the channel is known at both the Rx and the Tx, that 
is, full CSI is available, or open loop, when the channel is known only at the Rx, that 
is, no CSIT is available.
7.2.2.1 Closed-Loop Systems
Using the decomposition of the MIMO channel into parallel SISO subchannels one 
may express the capacity as the sum of the corresponding subchannels

Increasing the rank RH of matrix H, increases the capacity. This gain in capac-
ity is called spatial multiplexing gain. It is proved that among the channels with 
equal power gain the one with equal eigenvalues preserves higher capacity. For

channel, and C

7.2.3 Space-Time Coding for MIMO Systems
In 1998, two important publications set the principles for the space-time cod-
ing techniques. The first was the article by Alamouti (1998), where a simple but 
efficient transmit diversity technique for two transmit antennas was proposed. 
The second one was the article by Tarokh et al. (1998), where the introduction of 
redundancy in space and time imposed correlation among the signals transmitted 

246 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
by different antennas in different time periods, providing improved reliability in 
a faded link. The space-time codes may be categorized in space-time block codes 
(STBCs) and space-time trellis codes (STTCs). The STBCs are further divided 
in orthogonal STBCs and non-orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal STBCs. There

7.3 Multiuser MIMO
Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) schemes have been proposed as an efficient way 
to deal with the shortcomings of practical SU-MIMO systems. In realistic net-
works, SU-MIMO systems are vulnerable in propagation conditions where either 

MIMO Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 247
the SNIR is low, or due to the limited multipath richness and/or the presence of a 
strong line-of-sight (LOS) component the spatial correlation among antenna ele-
ments is high, or the number of antennas used at the mobile terminal (UE) is 
really small. All these factors affect the achievable diversity and spatial multiplexing 
gains. MU-MIMO antenna combining techniques in conjunction with resource 
allocation protocols among users provide unique benefits. The first is the robustness 
with respect to multipath richness, providing the capability to achieve full multi-
plexing gain regardless of the rank of each individual user. Furthermore, a compact 
antenna spacing at the BS is possible. The second benefit is the great opportunity to 
use single antenna terminals and still maintain the same diversity and multiplex-
ing gains. To achieve these gains, however, the CSI of the users should be fed back 
to the BS. In a practical system this implies the design of a trade-off mechanism 
between feedback accuracy and uplink resources consumption, otherwise the prac-
tical settings are restricted to TDD or settings with low mobility, in order to extend 
in time the channel stationarity conditions.
7.3.1  Signal Models, Capacity Regions, 
and Sum-Rate Capacity
Assume an array of M antennas at the BS that serves simultaneously K   autonomous 
users, with Nk antennas each. The maximum transmit power per user is Pk whereas, 
the total average transmit power is P. The users are typically separated by many wave-
lengths. The users do not collaborate to transmit or receive data. The MU-MIMO 
techniques imply the use of spatial sharing of the channel by the users, that is, it is 
a spatial multiple access scheme. The MU-MIMO multiple access channel (MAC), a 
terminology used in information theory for the cellular uplink channel, is a direct 
generalization of SU-MIMO techniques to multiuser case, whereas the downlink or 
broadcast channel (BC) is definitely more challenging.

The MAC capacity region is defined to be the convex closure of the set of achiev-
able rate pairs for which messages may be conveyed with vanishingly small probability 
of error. For a K -user MU-MIMO channel, the performance limit is the K -dimen-
sional capacity region consisting of all the vectors of rates R : (

K  that can be 
achieved simultaneously by the K  users. The MAC capacity region is a function of the 
users’ channels Hk and the covariance matrices Q k. It is convenient to now consider 
the two-user case and depict a capacity region, as shown in Figure 7.5. This region is 
the union of all pentagons, each one of which corresponds to a different set of transmit 
covariance matrices (Goldsmith et al. 2003). The capacity of MAC is given then by

The sum-rate is maximized by the rate vector corresponding to the point on the 
capacity region boundary at which the tangent line has slope −1. An efficient 
numerical technique to find the sum-rate maximizing covariance matrices is called 
iterative waterfilling (Yu et al. 2001).
In MAC each user’s signal is received by the BS in the presence of interference 
from the other users. To cope with inter-user interference in an optimal way, the BS 
receiver uses multiuser detection to jointly detect the spatially multiplexed signals.

The receiver is based on an MMSE decoder followed by a successive interference 
cancellation (SIC). The complexity of this receiver is increased due to the absence 
of cooperation among the transmitting antennas.

 . It has been proved, initially by 
Caire and Shamai (2003) for single-antenna users and then by Yu and Cioffi (2001) 
for multiantenna users, that the optimum transmit strategy for the MU-MIMO BC 
involves a theoretical interference precancellation technique known as dirty paper  coding 
(DPC) combined with an implicit user scheduling and power loading algorithm. 
DPC is a joint encoding and modulation technique that allows known interference to 
be presubtracted at the transmitter without increasing the transmit power. The DPC 
encoder output provides data symbols for each of the K  users which are precoded 
and transmitted simultaneously. DPC uses knowledge of the user’s channels and data 
streams to perform coding in an ordered fashion among the users, and thereby to 
remove interference at the transmitter. Indeed, the transmitter first picks a codeword 
for receiver 1 (i.e., x1), then chooses a codeword for receiver 2 (i.e., x2), with full 
knowledge of the codeword intended for receiver 1 and therefore, the codeword of 
user 1 can be presubtracted such that receiver 2 is not interfered by the codeword for 
receiver 1. Similarly, the codeword for receiver 3 is chosen such that receiver 3 does not 
see the signals intended for receivers 1 and 2 as interference. This process continues for 
all users and provides a quite complicated capacity region. Receiver 1 sees the signals 
for all other users as  interference, receiver 2 sees the signals for users 3 through K  as 
interference and so on. Therefore, the ordering of the users is very important and each 
permutation π , in encoding operation, provides a different rate region given by

Moreover, the authors in the same paper provide an explicit set of transformations 
to find covariance matrices in the BC/MAC that achieve the same rates. Therefore, 
one may numerically solve the convex problem of MAC, find the optimal MAC 
covariance matrices and then transform them to the corresponding optimal BC 
covariance matrices.

At very high SNRs, the sum-capacity of the BC is the same as the MAC’s, given in

The multiplexing gain, min
,
(
,
)
KN M  achieved over the BC requires CSIT but does 
not require coordination between the users. This is an interesting result since, with full 
CSI at the transmitter and under the reasonable assumption that K
M
>
, the sum rate 
capacity increases linearly in the number of transmit antennas at the BS. The number 
of simultaneously served users is arbitrary and the selection of the users to be served is 
done by the scheduler. Moreover, when K
M
>
, the number of receive antennas per 
user N  does not affect the scaling law. Thus, small and cheap single antenna terminals 
can be used and unlike in the SU-MIMO, the spatial multiplexing is maintained. 
The use of multiple antennas at the UE provides either diversity gain or an option 
for extra streams or interference cancellation. In addition, in MU-MIMO systems 
where the users are many wavelengths apart, the multiplexing gains are retained even 
in propagation conditions where the corresponding SU-MIMO systems would fail, 
that is, in cases with spatial correlation among antenna elements or in the existence 
of strong LOS component. If no CSIT is available at the BS, the capacity obtained is 
the same with that in point-to-point SU-MIMO systems

This result implies that the multiplexing gain is M  and it is obtained by the BS send-
ing data to M  carefully selected users out of K . The selection is performed by the 
scheduler based for example, on the criterion of sum rate maximization. Another 
interesting fact is that the number of receive antennas N  plays very little role in the 
BC sum rate capacity. The scaling with respect to the number of users is doubly-
logarithmic due to the tail of the Rayleigh distribution assumed in the model. If no 
channel knowledge is assumed at the BS, then the scaling with the number of users is

This results indicates that with no CSIT, the BS cannot exploit the users fading 
channels and their corresponding directions and may not be able to multiplex sig-
nals for multiple users, that is, to form spatial beams. Then the optimal scheme is 
to transmit to one user at a time.
7.3.2 Practical Issues and 3GPP Releases
Although DPC is the optimal encoding for MU-MIMO BC, it is a nonlinear tech-
nique with increased complexity. The precoding strategies that have been proposed 
for implementation in realistic systems include linear MMSE or ZF techniques and 
nonlinear approaches for example, vector perturbation (Hochwald et al. 2005) and 
Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) (Zamir et al. 2002). The latter preserve 
additional transmit signal processing complexity in exchange for improved error 
rate performance.
As previously explained, to properly serve the spatially multiplexed users the 
MU-MIMO systems require CSI at the transmitter. CSIT, while not essential in 
SU-MIMO, it is of critical importance to MU-MIMO downlink precoding tech-
niques. The strong need for CSIT feedback places a significant burden on uplink 
capacity, which is amplified when wideband waveforms are used, for example, 
OFDM, or when the user terminals preserve high mobility. An accurate CSI feed-
back would require an infinite number of bits and the reduced accuracy makes 
the system interference-limited and leads to decreased multiplexing gain. Realistic 
feedback strategies in the literature include vector quantization, dimension reduc-
tion, adaptive feedback, statistical feedback, and opportunistic SDMA.
Another challenge in MU-MIMO systems is the complexity of the scheduling 
procedure associated with the selection of a group of users that will be served simul-
taneously. Optimal scheduling involves exhaustive search. Therefore, other sched-
uling schemes include max-rate techniques, greedy user selection, and random user 
selection (Gesbert et al. 2007).
MU-MIMO techniques have been adopted in the LTE from the early releases 
(Lim et al. 2013). In LTE downlink the precoding is termed as codebook-based 
or non-codebook-based depending on whether it is based on cell-specific reference 

MIMO Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 253
signals or UE-specific reference signals. Rel. 8  supported a primitive form of 
MU-MIMO based on codebook-based precoding. Each UE measures its spatial 
channel using the common reference signal (CRS) broadcasted from the BS, also 
known as eNB in LTE, selects the rank-1 precoder that best represents the channel 
from a predefined codebook set, and then feeds back the index of the codebook, 
called precoding matrix indicator (PMI), and the channel quality information (CQI) 
to the eNB via an uplink channel. The eNB based on the knowledge of CQI and 
PMI from different UE, selects those UE that experience a minimum level of inter-
stream interference. In Rel. 8 MU-MIMO there is no UE-specific reference signal 
and the UE relies on CRS for both operations of channel estimation and demodu-
lation of data. In Rel. 9 rank-2 transmissions, called dual layer beamforming, are 
supported using one more reference signal, the demodulation RS (DM-RS). Unlike 
the CRS, which is common to all users in a cell and hence not precoded, the 
DM-RS is UE-specific and precoded along with accompanying data. Moreover, 
in Rel. 9 the eNB may schedule two UE simultaneously with two layers for each 
UE, that is, four-stream supports multiplexing. In Rel. 10 there are three different 
reference signals in the downlink; CRS, DM-RS and channel state information 
(CSI)-RS. CRS is defined for only up to four transmit antennas to limit pilot over-
head. DM-RS is used for demodulation of up to rank-8 and CSI-RS is defined for 
up to eight transmit antennas but with lower overhead compared to CRS. CSI-RS 
is transmitted in a fraction of subframes, whereas CRS is transmitted in every sub-
frame. Therefore, a great flexibility and a trade-off between accuracy and signaling 
overhead is supported. In Rel. 10 no more than four UE are coscheduled, no more 
than two layers are allocated per UE, and no more than four layers are transmitted 
in total. The enhancements in MIMO technologies supported in later releases of 
3GPP will be discussed in Sections 7.5 and 7.6.
7.4 Coordinated Multipoint
Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission and reception belong to the cat-
egory of advanced interference mitigation techniques proposed to improve not only 
the cell edge user throughput but also the average system throughput. Release 11 of 
3GPP has included coordinated transmission in the downlink and coordinated 
reception in the uplink to manage inter-cell interference (ICI) and improve cell-
edge coverage. In the former, the signals from multiple transmission points (TPs) 
are coordinated in a way to improve the received signal strength of the desired 
signal at a UE and/or to reduce the cochannel interference. In the latter, the uplink 
signal from a UE is received by a number of coordinated receiving points in order 
to improve the reliability and reduce the interference. These techniques may be 
applied to different deployment scenarios and by diverse cells, that is, macro, micro, 
pico, or even remote radio heads (RRH). The achieved performance of CoMP 
techniques depends mainly on the downlink CSI available at the BSs and this is 

254 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
obtained using uplink feedback from the UE to the BSs. Therefore, the feedback 
quality directly affects the performance.
The downlink coordinated transmission techniques may be categorized into 
coordinated scheduling and coordinated beamforming (CS/CB), joint transmission 
(JT), and dynamic point selection (DPS), or transmit point selection (TPS). In CS/
CB, multiple coordinated transmission points (TPs) share the same CSI to coor-
dinate scheduling/beamforming decisions, while data for a UE is available at and 
transmitted by a single TP. The coordinated scheduling and beamforming operations 
across multiple TPs are aligned to reduce the interference. In contrast, in JT scheme, 
data is simultaneously transmitted from multiple TPs to a single UE. Therefore, 
data is available simultaneously to all TPs. There are two JT schemes, the coherent 
and the noncoherent transmission. In the former, the signals from multiple TPs are 
jointly precoded to achieve coherent combining at the UE. Thus, the network has 
information related to the joint channel from all coordinated TPs to perform joint 
MIMO precoding. This requires very accurate synchronization between TPs. In the 
noncoherent JT, the network does not have information on the relationship of chan-
nels from the multiple TPs and the UE receives multiple transmissions individually 
precoded by each TP. The gain achieved is due to the increased power received by 
the UE. In a network with increased load, multiuser JT may be necessary in order 
to simultaneously transmit to multiple UE from the same set of TPs, leading to a 
combination of CoMP and MU-MIMO (Lee et al. 2012). In the TPS technique, 
the TP serving a UE may be changed at the subframe level according to the resources 
availability and the CSI. Again, data is available to all coordinated TPs.
The uplink coordinated reception techniques fall into two categories. The first 
is the dynamic selection of the best reception point according to the short-term 
channel quality and the second is the joint reception by many coordinated recep-
tion points. A major issue to be performed is the decoupling of the points that 
transmit downlink control signals from those that receive uplink data.
It is clear, that the coherent JT, more than any other technique, is sensitive to 
the accuracy of the feedback. Imperfect and/or outdated CSI directly affect the per-
formance of JT. Moreover, it is necessary to keep tight synchronization and to share 
the CSI and the data for multiple UE among the coordinated TPs. These require-
ments make it hard to achieve the theoretical gains of JT in practical networks. It 
seems that the coordinated beamforming technique that comes with less stringent 
synchronization and coordination requirements, can achieve a satisfactory perfor-
mance (Alexandropoulos et al. 2016).
7.5 Massive MIMO
The term massive MIMO is so appositely selected to depict not only the exception-
ally large number of antennas at the BS but also the very serious implications to the 
cellular systems. Thomas L. Marzetta was the first to indicate the challenges and 

MIMO Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 255
opportunities of scaling up MIMO to achieve huge improvements in throughput 
and energy efficiency (Marzetta 2010). The idea of massive MIMO builds upon 
the advantages offered by the MU-MIMO systems with the extra capability of 
being scalable technology. The very large number of service antennas relative to 
the number of active users in a cell, offer many benefits that include the great spa-
tial focusing of energy into very small regions of space allowing for selectivity in 
transmitting and receiving data streams to/from the users, which in turn leads to 
greater throughput, increased energy efficiency, and effective power control. The 
main weapon in achieving all these improvements is the asymptotic orthogonal-
ity of channel vectors associated with distinct users, which in addition allows for 
greater simplicity in signal processing using linear precoding/decoding techniques. 
Other benefits are the use of inexpensive hardware, the reduced latency due to the 
avoidance of deep fades, the simplification of MAC layer protocol, and the robust-
ness against intentional interference (Rusek et al. 2013). Nevertheless, there are also 
some issues to be addressed before massive MIMO becomes the 5G technology 
leader; these include the pilot contamination issue, the challenge of making many 
low-cost and low-precision components that work effectively together, the access 
of newly joined users, the development of novel cellular deployment scenarios, the 
power consumption of the BS RF front-end, and the overhead required for CSI 
acquisition.
The antenna arrays of massive MIMO systems contain hundreds of small and 
independently-controlled active antenna elements, fed via optical or electric cir-
cuits. Each antenna unit uses extremely low power, in the order of milliwatts. The 
deployment of the antenna array includes colocated and distributed scenarios. It is 
common in the respective literature to denote as M  the number of BS antennas and 
as K  the number of served users. Both are unconventionally large, but differ by a 
factor of two, four, or even an order of magnitude (Björnson et al. 2015). This is the 
reason massive MIMO systems offer huge spatial degrees-of-freedom and achieve 
strong signal gains, resilience to imperfect channel knowledge and low inter-user 
interference.
Massive MIMO is a large scale MU-MIMO and therefore, relies on spatial 
multiplexing, that is, on the BS having good enough channel knowledge, on both 
the UL and the DL. What is needed is a reliable transfer function information for 
the channels among all elements of the BS array and the users. For an FDD system, 
on the UL the K  terminals send K  orthogonal pilots, that is, known orthogonal 
training signals, based on which the BS estimates the CIR to each of the terminals. 
On the DL the BS sends M  orthogonal pilot waveforms, based on which the ter-
minals estimate the CIR, quantize the estimates, and feed them back to BS. This 
is a quite demanding operation and seems not feasible with hundreds of antennas. 
Moreover, the M  estimates of the pilots are sent over UL slot, extending the por-
tion of the slot dedicated to pilot information and decreasing the data portion. The 
case is even more difficult in high mobility scenarios where the fast time-varying 
channel calls for a frequent enough CSI update. The optimal DL pilots should be 

256 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
mutually orthogonal between the antennas, which means that the amount of time-
frequency resources needed for DL pilots scales with M. The number of CIRs each 
terminal must estimate is proportional to the number of antennas and thus, the UL 
resources needed for the feedback also scale with M. The obvious solution is the 
TDD mode of operation (Marzetta 2015), based on the assumption that the UL 
and DL channels are reciprocal. Nevertheless, there are few proposals for the appli-
cation of massive MIMO techniques in FDD systems (Chen and Lau 2014; Choi 
et al. 2014). It should be pointed out that the channel reciprocity in TDD systems 
breaks due to RF hardware asymmetry between UL and DL (Luo and Wang 2015; 
Luo 2016; Jiang et al. 2016) and calibration of the BS array is required (Vieira et al. 
2014; Liu et al. 2015).

sequences that can exist, is upper-bounded by the duration of the coherence interval

sequences. A direct implication is that the channel vector to a user becomes correlated 
with the channel vectors of those users with nonorthogonal sequences. The effect of 
reusing pilots from one cell to another and the associated negative consequences of cor-
related channel vectors is termed pilot contamination. When the BS antenna array cor-
relates its received pilot sequence with the sequence associated with a particular user, 
it derives a channel estimate that is contaminated by a linear combination of channels 
with other users that use the same sequence. During DL transmission, the beamform-
ing signal that is based on the contaminated channel estimate results in interference 
directed at those users that share the same sequence. This directional interference will 
not disappear with the increase of M . A similar phenomenon occurs during the UL 
transmission.

There have been proposed many techniques to mitigate pilot contamination that 
fall in three main categories: optimization of pilot sequences allocation in multi-
cell systems, where pilot reuse policies are followed to put mutually contaminated 
cells farther apart (Su and Yang 2015; Zhu et al. 2015), smart channel estimation 
techniques or even blind channel estimation (Ngo and Larsson 2012; Müller 
et al. 2014; Teeti et al. 2015), and pilot contamination precoding techniques that 
utilize cooperative transmission in multicell systems to nullify the directed inter-
ference that results from pilot contamination. Such precoding techniques are 
commented in the following paragraph. Recently, a novel pilot decontamination 
technique was proposed in Chen and Yang (2016), which combines a channel 
estimation and pilot assignment technique by exploiting the sparsity of correlated 
channels.
7.5.2 Orthogonality and Signal Processing Techniques
As already mentioned, the important result of increasing the number of antenna 
elements at the BS is the asymptotic orthogonality of channel vectors to different 
user terminals. These terminals are separated by many wavelengths and the random 
matrix theory implies that the effects of uncorrelated noise and small-scale fading 
are eliminated. Assuming single-antenna terminals, linear processing techniques 
are optimal and can be used, that is, maximum ratio combining on the UL (also 
called matched filtering—MF) and maximum ratio transmission on the DL. The 
signal model used to illustrate these results follows. It is based on a TDD with pilot 
reuse multicell system where the BSs are equipped with M  antennas and there are 
K  single-antenna user terminals in each cell.

contains inner products between M -component random vectors. As M grows 
without bound the L2-norms of the vectors grow proportional to M , while the 
inner products of uncorrelated vectors grow at a lesser rate (Marzetta 2010). 
For practical large values of M  only the products of identical quantities remain 
significant.

Therefore, for a very large number of BS antennas the effects of uncorrelated noise 
and fast fading are eliminated completely, and the intracell interference is zeroed. 
However, inter-cell interference is present. The effective signal-to-interference ratio 
(SIR) is identical for all subcarriers but depends on the cell and the terminal, that is,

The important observation is that the SIR is constant along the frequency domain 
because the shadow-fading coefficients are independent of frequency. Moreover, the 
SIR is independent of the cell-size because the range dependence is the same in the 
numerator and the denominator.
7.5.2.2 Downlink Transmission
In the DL the BS uses the channel estimation obtained from UL and performs 
conjugate beamforming, that is, transmits a symbol vector through a precoding 
matrix which is proportional to the conjugate transpose of the channel estimate. 
The DL transmission from a BS to the kth user in the cell suffers from interference 
due to transmissions from BSs in neighboring cells to the respective kth users. The 
received symbol vector by the K  users in the l th cell is given by

The aforementioned analysis has utilized the MF decoding in the UL and the 
conjugate beamforming in the DL. Other linear types of precoding and decod-
ing like ZF or MMSE can be used with better results in high SNR regime, but 
with increased complexity (Jose et al. 2011). There are also several proposals in 
the literature for the case of multicell precoding where many BSs cooperate to 
jointly serve users in different cells. Three main techniques have been proposed 
depending on the overhead and the information exchange among BSs (Lu et al. 
2014): single-cell processing, coordinated beamforming and  network MIMO 
multicell processing. In single-cell processing a BS has channel knowledge 
only for the users in this cell and not for users in other cells. This technique 
reduces the overhead but cannot deal with the inter-cell interference (Hoydis 
et al. 2013). The network MIMO multicell processing provides the best results 
but  with increased overhead (Huh et  al. 2012). Coordinated beamforming 
achieves a trade-off between performance and required overhead (Zhang and 
Cui 2010).

The authors in Ngo et al. (2013) derived the power scaling law for massive-MIMO 
systems. The basic result is that one user can scale down the transmit power propor-
tional to 1/M if perfect CSI is assumed and to 1/ M  if imperfect CSI is assumed, to 
get the same performance as in the SISO case. This results applies even in multicell 
systems with pilot contamination. In the same publication the authors also studied 
the trade-off between energy and spectral efficiency for the uplink. They defined 
the energy efficiency as the ratio of the spectral efficiency and the transmit power. 
If perfect CSI is assumed, the energy efficiency decreases as the spectral efficiency 
increases. The same applies to the case of imperfect CSI and high transmit power 
region. On the contrary, in the low transmit power region and for imperfect CSI 
the energy efficiency increases with the spectral efficiency. The authors also studied 
different precoding techniques. At high spectral efficiency, ZF outperforms MRC. 
This is due to the fact that MRC is limited by the intracell interference, which is 
significant at high spectral efficiency. Thus, when transmitted power is increased, 
the spectral efficiency of MRC approaches a constant value, while the energy effi-
ciency goes to zero. These observations are obtained from Figure 7.6 where all simu-
lation parameters are the same with those given in Ngo et al. (2013). Indeed, the 
reference point for the relative efficiency is the case with K

power of 10 dB. For the multicell scenario seven (7) cells are assumed with an inter-
cell interference factor equal to β = 0.04.

7.5.4 Hardware Impairments
The deployment of the antenna array includes colocated and distributed scenarios. 
The antenna elements in colocated configurations may form 2D or 3D array struc-
tures in order to exploit three dimensional channel characteristics, that is, being 
able to resolve paths in azimuth and elevation. The compactness of these arrays 
implies the effect of mutual coupling, which calls for efficient matching networks. 
Another important issue related to the channel and the antenna arrays is the 
correlation of the signals received by the closely spaced elements. What really mat-
ters in massive MIMO systems is the effects of coupling and correlation on the 
asymptotic orthogonality of the channel vectors. It has been shown by simulation 
in Rusek et al. (2013) that there is a power loss and a capacity penalty due to these 
effects. In Björnson et al. (2015), the authors studied the effect of hardware imper-
fections at the BSs taking into account the multiplicative phase-drifts, additive dis-
tortion noise, noise amplifications, and intercarrier interference. It was concluded 
that only the phase drifts limit the achievable rates as the number of antennas grows 
to infinity. This implies that massive MIMO systems are quite robust to hardware 
imperfections due to the fact that distortions are uncorrelated with the useful signals.

7.5.5 Testbeds and Measurement Results
The feasibility of massive MIMO systems has been questioned many times in the 
literature, especially with respect to its application to 5G cellular systems. There 
are few testbeds and measurement campaigns that attempt to answer the question 
on the feasibility and prove the advantages promised by massive MIMO concept 
(Hoydis et al. 2012; Martnez et al. 2014; Vieira et al. 2014; Gao et al. 2015). 
The first crucial assumption is the favorable propagation conditions and the cor-
responding asymptotic orthogonality of the channel vectors. This assumption has 
been validated in a great extent by outdoor measurements in Hoydis et al. (2012) 
where a scalable virtual antenna array of up to 112 elements was used. The orthogo-
nality was examined using the correlation coefficient and the condition number 
as meaningful metrics. The same issue was addressed in Gao et al. (2015) where 
outdoor-to-outdoor measurements were performed at 2.6 GHz using two different 
arrays: a virtual uniform linear array (ULA) with a large aperture and a uniform 
cylindrical array (UCA) with 128  antenna ports. Three propagation environ-
ments were measured and the favorable propagation conditions were confirmed. 
Moreover, singular value spreads and sum-rate capacities are calculated for LOS 
and NLOS conditions as well as for closely located users. Again, the conclusions 
of this research are very promising for the application of massive MIMO systems. 
In Vieira et al. (2014) the authors presented the Lund University Massive MIMO 
testbed (LuMaMi) and performed indoor measurements with four single-antenna 
users. The testbed operated with 20 MHz bandwidth OFDM signals and with 
100 antennas at the BS. The importance of this research activity lies on the imple-
mentation of massive MIMO system with off-the-shelf hardware components. In 
Martnez et  al. (2014) the authors used three different arrays to investigate the 
impact of the array aperture on the performance of the massive MIMO systems. 
The arrays were equipped with 64 antennas and eight user terminals were used 
with two antennas each. The measurements were conducted in indoor environ-
ment under LOS and NLOS conditions, for various user terminals distribution 
and terminals proximity. The main result is that the performance is increased with 
the aperture, which directly affects the number of spatial degrees of freedom avail-
able in real scenarios.
7.6 Full-Dimension MIMO
FD-MIMO is an interim technology term used in 3GPP to denote the  massive- 
MIMO capabilities of LTE-Advanced Pro standard (Release  13). Because the 
direct implementation of massive-MIMO systems is still not mature for the 

MIMO Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 265
reasons mentioned in Section 7.5, 3GPP initiated a study (3GPP 2015) to pro-
pose a feasible way of integration of this technology to 4G systems. FD-MIMO 
was initially proposed in Nam et al. (2013) and utilizes a large number of anten-
nas placed in a 2D rectangular antenna array at the BSs. The 2D grid allows 
for spatial separation not only in the azimuth domain but also in the elevation 
domain. A direct implication of the utilization of 2D arrays is that the radia-
tion beam patterns produced by these arrays may be adapted in both elevation 
and azimuth planes providing 3D beamforming capabilities and consequently, 
offering many more degrees of freedom in the spatial separation of users in the 
cells (Razavizadeh et al. 2014). This is achieved by dynamic and adaptive pre-
coding across all antenna elements (Kim et al. 2014). The 3D in beamforming, 
sometimes called vertical beamforming, allows for different power allocation to 
the beams that serve cell-edge and cell-centre regions, maintaining low intercell 
interference.
In the following the main issues related to the application of FD-MIMO to 
next-generation mobile communication systems are discussed.
7.6.1 CSI, Feedback, and Beamforming
One of the main challenges in implementing massive MIMO systems is the 
acquisition of instantaneous CSI at the BS, that is, on the UL. In TDD systems, 
one may exploit channel reciprocity to obtain the instantaneous CSI at BS via 
uplink training. If nonorthogonal pilots are employed in neighboring cells, channel 
estimation in a given cell will be impaired by the pilots in other cells, a phe-
nomenon referred to as pilot contamination. Therefore, even in TDD mode, the 
measurement at the BS does not capture the DL interference from neighboring 
cells or coscheduled user terminals. In FDD systems, time variation and frequency 
response is measured via downlink pilot signals, called downlink reference sig-
nals (RS) in LTE, and the BS acquires the CSI through a feedback channel. If 
a large number of antennas is used at the BS, the feedback link is overwhelmed 
and it is quite demanding for the BS to get accurate CSI, especially for users with 
high mobility. An alternative approach is to exploit the second-order statistics of 
the channel and utilize slowly varying statistical CSI. This allows for a long-term 
feedback (Adhikary et al. 2013). Recently, the authors in Li et al. (2016) proposed 
a new downlink low complexity 3D beamforming space-division multiple access 
(SDMA) transmission algorithm for FDD FD-MIMO systems, where each user 
has access to its own perfect effective CSI, while the BS has only the statistical CSI 
of each user. They derived the optimal beamforming vector for each user, as well as 
the main guidelines for user scheduling, by maximizing a lower bound of the aver-
age signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR). The term leakage in SLNR refers to 
the total power leaked from one user’s beamforming direction to other user’s chan-
nel direction. Numerical results presented in that paper showed that, even with 
statistical CSI at the BS, the achievable sum rate performance of the proposed 

266 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
algorithm is comparable to traditional ZF and MF algorithm with imperfect 
instantaneous CSI, while requires much less feedback overhead for FDD systems 
and is of low complexity. The algorithm is based on the observation that the BS 
should schedule the users that have orthogonal strongest horizontal or vertical 
statistical eigenmodes, and the optimal transmission strategy is to transmit sig-
nals along the strongest horizontal and vertical statistical eigenmode of each user, 
based on the maximization of a lower bound of average SLNR. Moreover, the 
scheduler should select users whose strongest horizontal and vertical statistical 
eigenmodes capture most of their channels’ power.
7.6.1.1 Reference Signals in 3GPP
In LTE, Rel. 8 and 9 of 3GPP standards, channel training and data demodulation 
are based on the same RS called common RS (CRS). In LTE-Advanced, Rel. 10, 
two new RSs have been introduced: the CSI-RS to assist to CSI acquisition, and 
the demodulation RS (DM-RS) to perform demodulation of data channel (Lim 
et al. 2013). The first is common to all users in the cell and thus unprecoded, the 
latter is UE-specific and is precoded with the same vector as the data. In order to 
minimize overhead, CSI-RS is transmitted in a fraction of subframes, whereas the 
CRS, which is used for both demodulation and CSI measurements, needs to be 
transmitted every subframe. In FD-MIMO a new RS is proposed, the precoded 
or beamformed CSI-RS that provides lower UL feedback overhead, lower DL pilot 
overhead, and higher quality in RS (Ji et al. 2016). In order to support the beam-
formed CSI-RS scheme, a new transmitter architecture called the transceiver unit 
(TXRU) architecture has been introduced, that is, a hardware connection between 
the baseband signal path and antenna array elements.
7.6.2 Antenna Issues and Architectures
One of the practical limiting factors in massive MIMO systems is the space needed 
in BSs for large antenna arrays at low operating frequencies. For a ULA with 
copolarized antenna elements, a horizontal space of about 4.7 m is required to fit 
64 antenna elements with 0.5λ interelement distance for an LTE carrier frequency 
of 2.0 GHz. The requirement is relaxed if one uses cross-polarized elements. In the 
case of vertical sectorization with two or three sectors, the number of elements in 
the vertical plane may be small. This is not the case when dynamic adaptation of 
beams per UE is required. Therefore, in FD-MIMO 2D grids are used to place 
co- or cross-polar antenna elements leading to significantly reduced dimensions, 
for example, for an a 8 8

is needed. The model used for antenna radiation pattern is that introduced in (ITU-R

We assume that the BS is deployed with an M

 uniform planar array (UPA) 
with N  antennas in each row, each row forming a ULA, and a total number of M  
rows in the vertical dimension. Another useful parameter is the number of polariza-
tion dimensions P, which is equal to 1 for single-polarized antennas and equal to 
2 for dual-polarized antennas. A typical configuration indicated in (3GPP 2015) is 
that of dual polarized antenna array (

P =
 with M = 8 with 0.8λ spacing in verti-
cal dimension and N = 4 with 0.5λ spacing in horizontal dimension.
As already mentioned in previous paragraph, the TXRU architecture is respon-
sible for the connection of baseband and antenna array. The active antenna elements 
incorporate phase shifters and variable gain amplifiers so that the BS can control the 
phase and the gain of all antenna elements. The TXRU architecture is the feeding 
network that brings the baseband signals from the TXRUs to the array elements. In 
(3GPP 2015) it is called TXRU virtualization model. A TXRU is only associated with 
antenna elements with the same polarization. According to Ji et al. (2016), depend-
ing on the CSI-RS transmission and feedback strategy, two representative options, 
array partitioning and array connected architecture, are suggested and shown in 
Figure 7.8. The former is for the conventional codebook scheme and the latter is for 
the beamforming scheme. In the array partitioning architecture, antenna elements 
are divided into multiple groups (subarrays) and each TXRU is connected to one of 

268 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
them, whereas in the array connected structure, the RF signals of multiple TXRUs 
are delivered to a single antenna element. In the array partitioning an orthogonal 
CSI-RS is assigned to each group, that is, to each TXRU. In order to achieve the 
same coverage for all CSI-RSs an identical weight is applied to all groups (subarrays). 
In the array connected architecture, each antenna element is connected to more than

one TXRUs and an orthogonal CSI-RS is assigned for each TXRU. A different 3D 
beamforming weight for each beam is applied to all antenna elements.
The CSI feedback mechanisms that proposed in (3GPP 2015) are the compos-
ite codebook and the beam index feedback. In the first scheme the overall code-
book is divided into two codebooks one for vertical and one for horizontal plane, 
and these are fed back separately to the BS. This way the two codebooks may be 
different in size. The combination of the two codebooks is based on Kronecker 
product. In the beam index feedback the user terminal send back the index of the 
beam that maximizes the received power and the corresponding CQI. If dual-
polarized antennas are used then extra information regarding the relative phase is 
required.
7.6.3 3D Channel Model
The performance evaluation of any novel technique that incorporates azimuth 
and elevation angles, requires a 3D channel model to characterize the propagation 
paths in both the horizontal and vertical directions along with time and frequency 
characteristics. The majority of channel models used in the literature of mobile 
communication systems are two dimensional models that neglect the elevation 
angle. Typical examples are the spatial channel model (SCM) proposed by 3GPP in 
(3GPP 2014), and the WINNER channel model proposed in (WINNER II WP1 
2007). The latter has been recommended by ITU-R as a baseline for performance 
evaluation of various radio interface technologies in (ITU-R 2009). Nevertheless, 
especially in urban environments, a great percentage of energy is incident with ele-
vation angles larger than 10°  (Kuchar et al. 2000). Therefore, 3D channel models 
are required and in this direction WINNER+ as an extension to WINNER model 
was proposed in Hentila et al. (2010). Moreover, 3GPP initiated a study on 3D 
models in order to support the performance evaluation of FD-MIMO techniques 
(3GPP 2013). A critical issue is the implementation of these models with no limita-
tions to antenna array structure and propagation environment. Some implementa-
tions of the 3GPP model are given in Kammoun et al. (2014) and Ademaj et al. 
(2015, 2016). This model is a 3D geometric stochastic model where the scatterers 
are represented by statistical parameters. Three environmental scenarios are defined, 
urban macrocell (UMa), urban micro cell (UMi), and UMa-high rise (UMa-H). 
In UMa and UMa-H scenarios a sector antenna height of 25 m is considered, that 
is, above the rooftop level, whereas in UMi scenario the height of the antenna is 
10 m, that is, below the rooftop level. The propagation conditions specified are the 
LOS, the non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and the outdoor-to-indoor (O-to-I). For each 
of these conditions different parameters have been defined for the mean path loss, 
the large-scale, and the small-scale fading. The main features to be highlighted is 
that the LOS conditions, the path loss and the spread of departure angles are height 
and distance-dependent.

270 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
7.7 mm-Wave MIMO
The channel bandwidth availability and the significantly reduced size requirements to 
accommodate tens or even hundreds of antennas at the transceivers are the two main 
advantages offered by the use of mm-Wave frequencies. Although spatial multiplex-
ing and beamforming techniques are efficiently exploited in many available wireless 
standards in sub-6 GHz bands, the design and implementation of these techniques in 
mm-Wave bands is not straightforward and is quite different from the lower frequen-
cies. The main reasons for this deviation are the hardware constraints imposed by the 
high frequencies, the different channel propagation conditions and the large number 
of antennas at both ends of the links (Alkhateeb et al. 2014; Bai et al. 2014; Heath 
et al. 2016). The hardware constraints are related to the difficult practical implemen-
tation of mm-Wave arrays with one RF chain for each available antenna and to the 
high cost and power consumption of components like the power amplifier (PA) and 
the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Moreover, the increased bandwidth implies 
many gigasamples per second for each antenna-related digital conversion stage, which 
in turn implies increased power consumption for the signal processing stage. All these 
constraints make the conventional sub-6 GHz MIMO architecture with digital pro-
cessing taking place entirely at baseband, infeasible. The channel in mm-Wave bands 
is quite different from that in lower frequencies (Rappaport et al. 2013a, 2013b). The 
first difference is related to LOS and NLOS conditions. The LOS signals propagate as 
in free space, whereas NLOS signals are much weaker. The mm-Wave frequencies are 
quite sensitive to blockage effects caused by walls, bodies, and foliage. The diffraction 
mechanism does not contribute much to the coverage, as in sub-6 GHz bands, and 
the scattering clusters are fewer. Furthermore, the angle spread of the multipaths in 
a cluster is small. These effects lead to sparse MIMO channel matrices affecting the 
rank of the channel and the corresponding capacity achieved. The large number of 
antennas will allow for large directivity gains and a more efficient interference mitiga-
tion. On the other hand, the increased number of antennas increases the complexity 
for channel estimation, precoding, combining and equalization. All these issues have 
led the research community to the proposal of different MIMO architectures. The 
available options to serve the beamforming and/or the spatial multiplexing operations 
are discussed in Sections 7.7.1 through 7.7.3.
7.7.1 Analog Beamforming
This architecture is based on a network of digitally controlled phase shifters con-
nected to the antenna elements. The signals from the phase shifters are added and 
driven to a single RF chain. The weights of the phase shifters are adaptively adjusted 
and are designed to shape and steer the transmit and receive beams according to 
some criterion, for example, the SNR. The analog beamforming is proposed in 
IEEE 802.11ad and in IEEE 802.15.3c. The phase shifters may be active or pas-
sive (Heath et al. 2016) and the main issues are the insertion losses and the power 

MIMO Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 271
consumption, which is related also to the resolution of the quantized phases. The 
drawbacks of analog beamforming are, (1) the support of single-user and single-
stream transmission for a simple implementation with one RF chain behind the 
phase shifters network and (2) the beam steering is quite complicated requiring 
beam training and channel estimation.
7.7.2 Hybrid Analog/Digital Precoding/Combining
This technique is a compromise between purely analog or digital implementations. 
The initial idea of joint RF and baseband signal processing design may be found 
in Zhang et al. (2005), later on in Theofilakos and Kanatas (2007), where the 
concept of adaptive receive antenna subarray formation for MIMO systems was 
proposed, and in Venkateswaran and van der Veen (2010), where a multichannel 
beamformer was proposed in the RF domain, followed by a digital beamformer in 
baseband. The architecture proposed for mm-Wave frequencies (Heath et al. 2016) 
is shown in Figure 7.9. The DACs and ADCs are given in pairs since the sampling 
is performed in the in-phase and the quadrature components. The relationship 
among the number of streams, RF chains, and antenna elements is the following:

There are different strategies for the design of the precoding and combining 
matrices which are briefly presented in Heath et  al. (2016). Furthermore, the 
authors in Sohrabi and Yu (2016) show that hybrid beamforming can achieve the 
same performance of any fully digital beamforming scheme with much fewer RF 
chains. The required number of RF chains and the relationship to the number of 
data streams is also considered in that paper, as well as in Bogale et al. (2016), where 
an extensive study is presented for the number of RF chains and phase shifters for a 
downlink multiuser massive MIMO system in frequency selective channels.

272 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
7.7.3 Low Resolution ADCs
This alternative architecture is based on the replacement of the high-resolution ADCs, 
for example, 6-bit or higher resolution, with low resolution ADCs of 3, 2 or even 
1-bit resolution. This replacement is proposed since the ADCs with high resolution 
and large sampling rates are considered to be costly and consume power of several 
Watts. Moreover, the interfacing cards connecting digital components to ADCs are 
also power-hungry and the consumption increases with the resolution. There are few 
drawbacks related to this new model with low-precision ADCs. The first is that the 
basic communication techniques with low-resolution ADCs are quite different. In 
Mezghani et al. (2012) the authors provide a modified minimum mean square error 
(MMSE) detector, extended to an iterative decision feedback equalizer, whereas in 
Choi et al. (2016), the authors present detectors and channel estimation methods 
for massive-MIMO systems with 1-bit ADCs. Nevertheless, the literature is not yet 
mature for multiuser applications. Next, the theoretical capacity achieved is limited 
even at high SNR regime (Mo and Heath 2015). There are expected many more 
contributions in the literature for 1-bit ADC architectures in the following years.

In memory of our most humane professor, Dr. Philip Constantinou.
—Constantinos B. Papadias
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has been recently incorpo-
rated in cellular mobile radio communications systems as a means to increase the 
spectral efficiency (SE), in response to the exponential traffic growth noticed over 
the past few years [1] and the shortage in available spectrum [2]. In view of the 
enormous capacity requirements of future cellular networks [3], new variants of 
this communication paradigm that promise to further boost the achievable SE have 
been proposed [4,5].
The performance of the various MIMO transmission schemes studied in the 
literature depends on the degrees of freedom (DoF) provided by the antenna sys-
tems that are installed on the base stations (BSs) and the user terminals (UT) [6,7]. 
When conventional digital antenna arrays (DAA) are utilized, which make use of 
voltage-driven (i.e., active) antenna elements, this quantity equals the number of 
deployed antennas. However, cost, complexity, and energy consumption grow with 
the number of antennas, as each antenna element should be fed by a radio frequency 
(RF) chain [7]. Moreover, the interelement spacing should be above a predefined 
threshold, so that the electromagnetic coupling among the antennas is minimized [7]. 
These constraints place a limit on the number of antenna elements in such arrays 
and, therefore, on the performance gains of MIMO communication techniques [7]. 
Hence, there is a growing interest lately on antenna systems that address these issues.
Load-controlled parasitic antenna arrays (LC-PAA) constitute a representative 
example. These compact hybrid antenna systems employ a limited number of active 
antenna elements, surrounded by passive antenna elements that are terminated to 
tunable loads. Due to the strong mutual coupling, which is caused by the delib-
erately chosen small antenna spacing, the feeding voltages induce currents on the 
so-called parasitic antennas, thus enabling them to participate in the formation of 
the far-field radiation pattern. Hence, by exploiting the mutual coupling, LC-PAAs 
manage to provide the same DoF as DAAs with more RF units or, alternatively, more

DoF than DAAs with the same number of RF modules, thus leading to cost, com-
plexity, and energy consumption savings or to performance improvement, respectively. 
Furthermore, by adjusting the impedance of the parasitic loads with the help of a 
low-cost digital control circuit, we can set the amplitude and phase of the currents 
that run on the passive antennas in a controllable manner, that is we can perform 
transmit beamforming (BF), even in the extreme case of single-fed LC-PAAs [8]. 
This is similar with the weighting of the currents that is performed in the baseband 
of DAAs in order to shape and steer beams.
A collection of recent studies demonstrates that the capability of single-RF 
LC-PAAs to reconfigure their radiation pattern allows them to perform also open-
loop (i.e., channel-agnostic) MIMO [7], while [9] presents a method that enables the 
application of channel-aware precoding on such antenna systems—and, in exten-
sion, to multi-RF LC-PAAs as well. Nevertheless, the technique described in [9] 
cannot attain any given signal constellation or precoding scheme, since often the 
required load combinations result in system instability. In [10], an alternative is pre-
sented. However, this method is not robust. In addition, it presents high computa-
tional complexity.
The goal of this chapter is to introduce a pragmatic approach that will facilitate 
the application of the LC-PAA technology in actual 5G networks. More specifically, 
a low-complexity method for performing arbitrary channel-dependent precoding 
with such arrays in a variety of MIMO configurations is described. We have to 
note that the considered precoding methods include not only the conventional 
user-level precoding techniques but also symbol-level precoding schemes. The latter 
techniques improve the performance of multiuser MIMO systems that operate at 
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels [11]. Moreover, we should mention that this 
work focuses on both the cellular access and the centimeter-wave (cm-wave) por-
tion of the radio spectrum (i.e., frequency bands in the 0.3–3 GHz and 3–30 GHz 
range, respectively), in accordance to the current trend of exploiting the available 
bandwidth (BW) in the spectral regions above 6 GHz in order to enhance the peak 
user rates and the system capacity [12]. The performance of the utilized transmission 
techniques is evaluated, in terms of the (average) per-user or system-wide downlink 
(DL) throughput, through analytic expressions, numerical simulations, and over-
the-air (OTA) testbed-based experimentations. The design and implementation of 
the corresponding antenna arrays is presented as well.
8.1 Introduction
8.1.1 The 5G Era
Nowadays, we live in the dawn of the 5th-generation (
)
5G  era. The 5G vision 
encompasses the provision of data-hungry services and the support of challeng-
ing use cases, such as the delivery of ultra-high-definition (UHD) video streams 

282 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
at locations with high user density (e.g., airports, train stations, shopping malls, 
stadiums). The characteristics of the envisioned applications and scenarios indi-
cate that 5G cellular mobile radio communications systems should accommodate 
about 1000 times higher traffic volume per unit area than current 4G Long-Term 
Evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) networks [3]. This statement refers to 
the cellular DL, where the BSs act as transmitters (TX), whereas the UTs play the 
role of the receivers (RX).
In principle, this objective could be met by allocating additional spectral 
resources to these bandwidth-demanding services. However, the sub-6  GHz 
frequency bands, which are typically utilized for wireless access purposes, are 
severely congested. This phenomenon is attributed to the increasing demand for 
wireless communications over the past decades, which led to the emergence of a 
plethora of services (e.g., TV and radio broadcasting), in conjunction with the 
adoption of the rather rigid and inefficient licensed-access spectrum management 
model, where license holders are granted the right to exploit exclusively specific 
parts of the spectrum at certain locations [2]. The scarcity and the subsequent 
high-acquisition cost of the radio spectrum prohibit the use of the aforemen-
tioned brute-force approach in practice. As a consequence, the industry and the 
academia agreed that the synergy between a number of alternatives is required, 
in order to address the spectrum crunch issue and achieve the capacity goal of 
5G systems.
The area capacity (AC) of a cellular network (i.e., the sum-throughput per unit 
area) is given by 
 
AC [bits/s/km ]
BW [Hz]

(8.1)
where:
BW is the system bandwidth
SE is the spectral efficiency (i.e., the aggregated data rate per unit of BW)
CD is the cell density (i.e., the number of cells per unit area)
Therefore, the typical strategies for meeting the 5G capacity target include [13]: 
 
◾The exploitation of additional spectrum in higher frequency bands, where 
there is an abundance of available BW, through the use of cm-wave and mil-
limeter-wave (mm-wave) access technologies
 
◾The utilization of techniques that increase the SE, for example, spectrum 
sharing methods, such as the Licensed Shared Access (LSA) paradigm
 
◾The densification of the radio access network (RAN), that is, the deployment 
of a large number of small cells over the service area of interest, so that the 
available spectrum is reused more aggressively across different cells

Channel-Dependent Precoding for Multiuser Access ◾ 283
8.1.2 MIMO Wireless Communication Paradigms
MIMO technology constitutes an integral component of the 5G ecosystem. MIMO 
communication techniques leverage the spatial dimension provided by the use of mul-
tiple antennas at the UTs or/and the BSs, in order to accomplish a substantial increase 
of the DL throughput at link or cell level [6]. This performance boosting is realized at 
no extra cost in terms of transmission power neither requires bandwidth expansion; it 
is instead an outcome of the increase in the dimensionality of the signal space. That is, 
it corresponds to the additional spatial DoF brought by the use of multiantenna nodes.
More specifically, MIMO transmission schemes involve the spatial multiplex-
ing (SM) of a number of data signals (i.e., the concurrent transmission of multiple 
radio signals over the same frequency band) destined either to a single user or to 
a set of individual users [6]. The former paradigm is known as single-user MIMO 
(SU-MIMO) or point-to-point MIMO (PTP-MIMO), while the latter one is 
referred to as multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) or single-cell MIMO (SC-MIMO). 
Both technologies have been used extensively in LTE/LTE-A networks.
In SU-MIMO, the cell users are orthogonalized in the time domain through 
the utilization of the time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, that is, a single 
user is scheduled at each timeslot (TS). In MU-MIMO, on the other hand, which 
is sometimes called space-division multiple access (SDMA), a group of cell users is 
selected at each scheduling interval. These so-called active users share spatially the 
DL channel. Hence, in SU-MIMO both the serving BS and the UTs should be 
equipped with multiple antennas, for multistream communication to take place, 
whereas in MU-MIMO there is no such requirement for the user devices.
These multiantenna communication methods entail the employment of complex 
signal processing operations, in order to mitigate the resulting inter-stream or/and 
multiuser cochannel interference (CCI). The (pre)processing of the data signals that 
takes place at the BS in this regard prior to transmission is called precoding and is 
performed in the baseband (i.e., in the digital domain). Precoding exploits the avail-
ability of channel state information (CSI) at the TX (CSIT) (i.e., the knowledge of 
the composite DL channel at the BS), in order to spatially orthogonalize the trans-
mitted cochannel signals. The DL channel is characterized by a matrix, whose entries 
are the gains of the scalar DL channels formed between each TX–RX antenna pair.
SU-MIMO exploits the multipath propagation, in order to enable the transmis-
sion of multiple data signals on a single time-frequency resource. To this end, linear 
precoding aligns these cochannel signals with spatially orthogonal scalar sub-channels 
created between the transmit and receive antennas, so that the inter-stream inter-
ference is eliminated [14]. In MU-MIMO, on the other hand, linear precoding 
constitutes a multistream variant of transmit BF which aims at steering the data 
signals toward the intended users, so that the received signal power is increased 
while the multiuser interference (MUI) caused by the energy leakage of each trans-
mission at other users is limited [15]. Due to its inner-mechanics, MU-MIMO can 

284 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
be applied in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS communication scenarios, in 
contrast to SU-MIMO.
In view of the advent of 5G systems, the focus of the community has been 
shifted in recent years toward multicell MIMO (MC-MIMO). This technology is 
an extension of MU-MIMO that enables the adoption of universal frequency re-
use, so that the system-wide capacity is further increased. This is accomplished by 
utilizing techniques that handle not only the intra-cell CCI but also the resulting 
inter-cell interference (ICI), which may degrade the performance of the cell-edge 
users if no countermeasure is taken.
Two MC-MIMO variants have been considered in the literature. Coordinated 
MIMO (cMIMO), which has been introduced in the LTE-A standard under the 
name of coordinated multipoint (CoMP), refers to a family of multiantenna trans-
mission techniques that rely on the cooperation between neighboring nodes, so 
that their transmissions are coordinated and ICI is reduced or even eliminated [4]. 
Cooperation takes the form of the exchange of control information (e.g., user sched-
uling), CSI, user data, or combinations thereof between the corresponding BSs over 
the transport network. Massive MIMO (mMIMO), on the other hand, is based on 
the use of an excessive number of antennas at the BSs, in comparison with the num-
ber of active users. The excess of transmit antennas allows for serving a high number 
of users and controlling at the same time more effectively the resulting intra-cell and 
inter-cell CCI [5]. It is expected that both MC-MIMO technologies will be essential 
components of 5G systems. In this chapter, we focus on cMIMO.
8.1.3 Symbol-Level Precoding
The conventional user-level linear precoding methods that are utilized in 
MU-MIMO aim to reduce or even eliminate the CCI. In [11], though, it is dem-
onstrated that at symbol level, CCI may be in some cases constructive instead of 
destructive, that is, it may increase the received SNR without the need to waste 
transmit power for this purpose. Moreover, in this work a symbol-level variant of 
the popular zero forcing (ZF) precoding scheme is studied. Numerical simulations 
show that this method outperforms its user-level counterpart.
8.1.4 Antenna Arrays
An antenna array is a device that consists of a group of collocated antenna elements 
that are connected to each other and arranged according to some topology in order 
to form a composite antenna. The cooperation of the antenna elements allows for 
advanced operations to take place, such as the shaping of complex radiation pat-
terns and the concurrent transmission/reception of multiple data signals.
As we have already mentioned, the DoF provided by the antenna arrays installed 
on the BSs and the UTs determine the SM and interference management capabilities 

Channel-Dependent Precoding for Multiuser Access ◾ 285
of MIMO communication techniques, that is, the number of cochannel signals 
that can be transmitted in parallel as well as, in the case of multiuser multiantenna 
 communication setups, the achievable spatial directivity.
Conventional DAAs are comprised by active antenna elements that are placed suf-
ficiently apart, so that the occurrence of mutual coupling among them is avoided [7]. 
Therefore, there is an one-to-one mapping between each driving voltage and the corre-
sponding antenna current. This linear relationship facilitates the processing of the data 
signals in the digital domain and allows for full control of the antenna currents [7].
The array DoF of such antenna systems equal the number of antenna elements. This 
fact motivated the research on mMIMO. Similarly, the variant of cMIMO known as 
joint transmission (JT) or network MIMO takes advantage of the relationship between 
the number of antennas in each BS and the provided DoF to artificially increase the 
effective DoF. To this end, it enables the sharing of the user data among the cooperating 
BSs, so that the scheduled cell-edge users are served jointly by multiple nodes.
On the other hand, since in DAAs each antenna element is fed by a RF unit 
which consists of low-noise amplifiers (LNA), power amplifiers (PAs), filters, digital-
to-analog/analog-to-digital converters (DAC/ADC), and so on, the cost, complex-
ity, and energy consumption of the system grows proportionally to the number of 
antennas [7]. Moreover, the packing of a large number of antennas is prohibited by 
the requirement to eliminate the mutual coupling, which would degrade the radia-
tion efficiency. These constraints limit the achievable SE of MIMO techniques.
LC-PAAs represent an alternative paradigm that solves these problems. These 
antenna systems exploit the mutual coupling among the antenna elements in order 
to increase the DoF that correspond to a given number of RF units or decrease the 
number of active antennas required to provide a target number of DoF. We dis-
tinguish between two types of LC-PAAs, namely, single-active multiple-passive 
(SAMP) arrays or single-fed arrays and multiple-active multiple-passive (MAMP) 
arrays. As we have described, these antenna systems calculate dynamically the  values 
of the tunable parasitic loads, in order to generate the desired antenna  currents for 
the application of interest (e.g., transmit BF, channel-dependent precoding). We 
should mention that single-RF LC-PAAs are of special interest, since they mimic 
the functionality of conventional antenna arrays while having a single voltage feed. 
Single-fed LC-PAAs with tunable loads are often referred to as single-RF electroni-
cally steerable passive array radiators (ESPAR).
8.2 Overview of MIMO Wireless Communication
8.2.1 Single-User MIMO
Consider a scenario where a BS communicates with a UT in the cellular DL over 
a PTP link established between them. We assume that CSI is available at both the 
TX and the RX. The communication is subject to a transmit power constraint P

and is contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with variance σn
2. In 
addition, we consider a quasi-static frequency-flat fading channel. For convenience, 
we assume independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading. We focus 
on a single realization of this fading channel, which corresponds to a time-invariant 
(TI) narrowband (NB) channel.
First, we assume that each node of this communication setup is equipped with a 
single antenna. The SE of this 5th single-input single-output (SISO) system (i.e., the 
maximum data rate per unit of BW for which reliable communication is possible 
over this scalar channel) for the given channel realization is [6]

We note from Equation 8.2 that the (BW-normalized) channel capacity C grows 
logarithmically with the transmit power P or, equivalently, with the receive SNR. 
This argument holds in the DoF-limited high-SNR regime as well, that is, every 
increase of 3 dB in transmit power leads to an additional bit/s/Hz of SE [6]. In the 
power-limited low-SNR regime, on the other hand, C increases linearly with P [6].
Next, we consider an equivalent (1,

 is the receive SNR.
We notice that the use of multiple receive (transmit) antennas results in an 
increase of the receive SNR, that is, the quantity h
2 represents a power gain. 
When the channel gain is normalized to unity, the power gain equals the number 
of receive (transmit) antennas. We also note that the performance benefit from 
the use of multiple receive (transmit) antennas is more apparent in the low-SNR 
regime, since then the power gain is translated into a linear capacity gain.
In the aforementioned setups, only single-stream transmission is possible. In a 
(

M N  multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, on the other hand, mul-
tistream communication is also possible. The capacity of P2P-MIMO systems was 
studied extensively in the mid-1990s [16,17]. It has been shown that the MIMO 
channel, which is characterized by a (

. In the medium-SNR 
regime, the WF algorithm allocates more power to the eigenmodes with larger 
gain. In the low-SNR regime, on the other hand, all power is allocated to the 
dominant eigenmode (i.e., the one with the higher gain)—that is, single-stream 
transmission takes place. Here, a power gain is noticed, as in the SIMO/MISO 
cases. Finally, at high SNR, the WF algorithm allocates approximately equal 
power to all eigenmodes. In this case, the channel capacity scales linearly with 
r, that is, an increase of 3 dB in the transmit power adds approximately r extra 
bits/s/Hz of SE. This is in contrast with the SISO, SIMO, and MISO cases, 
where we can only achieve a logarithmic increase of the capacity with the trans-
mit power. The prelog factor r which determines the capacity increase of a 
MIMO system in comparison to an equivalent SISO system (i.e., the number of 
interference-free spatial  sub-channels created between the transmit and transmit 

288 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
antennas or, equivalently, the number of data streams that can be spatially mul-
tiplexed) is referred to as the SM gain or the spatial DoF.
If the number of scatterers is limited or/and the inter-element distance at each 
side of the link is small, H may become ill-conditioned or/and rank-deficient (i.e., 
r
M N
<
,
min[
]), which results in a decrease of the channel capacity. On the other 
hand, under the assumption of i.i.d. Rayleigh fading, which implies a rich scatter-
ing environment as well as sufficient antenna separation at both the TX and the 
RX, H is full-rank and well-conditioned. Since in this case r
M N
= min(
,
), the 
capacity grows linearly with the minimum of the number of antennas installed at 
both sides of the link (or, in case of M
N
=
, with the number of antennas at either 
side of the link). Hence, in order to double the capacity in a symmetric setup, we 
simply have to double the number of antennas at each node.
So far, we have focused on the capacity of a PTP system for a single channel 
realization. In order to fully characterize the performance of such a system, we 
typically use the average capacity, which is obtained by taking the expectation of 
the capacity per channel realization with respect to the distribution of the channel.
8.2.2 Multiuser MIMO
While SU-MIMO provides significant gains in terms of the per-user capacity, it 
presents also a number of drawbacks: (a) In SU-MIMO, a single user is scheduled at 
each TS, since there is no mechanism to handle the intra-cell interference. (b) The 
UTs should be equipped with multiple antennas. As we have already mentioned, 
this is seldom the case, due to size, cost, and energy consumption constraints. 
(c) SU-MIMO can be applied only in scattering environments. Even in virtual 
LOS environments, such as keyhole channels where the channel matrix has rank 
one, SM is not possible. And (d) fading correlation due to insufficient scattering 
or/and small antenna spacing results in throughput drop.
MU-MIMO addresses these issues. This paradigm enables a BS to serve 
concurrently multiple users over a single frequency band, so that the SE of the 
corresponding cell is increased. The resulting point-to-multipoint (PTMP) chan-
nel is referred to as the MIMO broadcast channel (MIMO-BC). In contrast to 
SU-MIMO, MU-MIMO does not require the use of multiantenna UTs or the exis-
tence of scattering. Moreover, it is more robust against propagation non-idealities 
than SU-MIMO. On the other hand, though, MU-MIMO requires the availability 
of CSIT, for the mitigation of the MUI that arises due to the parallel cochannel 
transmissions to be possible with the application of appropriate precoding tech-
niques, while SU-MIMO systems may operate without CSIT as well.
Multiuser communication systems are described by their capacity region, which 
consists of all vectors of data rates R = (

 that can be achieved simul-
taneously by the K  active users, where Rk is the data rate of the kth user. A suitable 
performance measure is the sum-rate (SR) capacity, which is the maximum of the 
sum of the user rates over all possible data rate vectors [6]:

(8.7)
The notation  refers to the capacity region of the MIMO-BC.
The average SR capacity of the MIMO-BC scales linearly with the minimum of 
the number of antennas installed at the BS and the total number of antennas at the 
UTs [6,7]. Hence, when there are at least as many users as transmit antennas, the 
average SR capacity grows with the number of service antennas, irrespective of 
the number of antennas installed at each UT [6,7]. These statements hold also in the 
high-SNR regime. In the low-SNR regime, on the other hand, the optimal strategy 
is to schedule a single user (the one with the best channel) and apply transmit BF [6].
Since both CSI and user data are available at the BS, the resulting MUI can be 
predicted in advance. The capacity-achieving transmission strategy is dirty paper 
coding (DPC), a multiuser encoding scheme that takes advantage of the noncausal 
knowledge of the MUI to subtract it prior to transmission [6]. However, the succes-
sive encodings and decodings involved in DPC turn this nonlinear preprocessing 
method practically infeasible, especially when the number of users is large [6].
Linear precoding constitutes a suboptimal alternative that offers a good trade-
off between performance and complexity. This technique leverages the physical 
separation of the users to enable the spatial sharing of the channel through the 
application of multistream transmit BF. More specifically, each data stream is 
premultiplied by a different BF vector and then it is transmitted by all antennas. 
The BF weights determine the relative amplitude and phase of the signal at each 
antenna, so that the signal components are added constructively at the intended 
user and destructively at other users [15]. In other words, a beam is assigned to each 
user, so that the signal power is focused toward that user. The more the DoF pro-
vided by the antenna array installed on the BS are, the higher the spatial resolution 
and, therefore, the interference handling capability of the system will be.

Several variants of linear precoding exist. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is 
a common example. This method utilizes BF vectors that match to the intended

MRT is optimal in the power-limited low-SNR regime, where typically a single 
user is selected at each TS, since in this case the power gain attributed to the appli-
cation of transmit BF is translated into a linear capacity gain. However, its capacity 
floors in the DoF-limited high-SNR regime, where commonly SDMA is applied, 
since it cannot handle the MUI.
ZF precoding, on the other hand, makes use of BF vectors that are orthogonal 
to the subspace of other users’ channel vectors in order to eliminate the MUI. That 
is, the inner product of a user’s BF vector with other users’ channel vectors is zero:

This precoding scheme attains a significant portion of the DPC capacity in the 
high SNR regime, especially when single-antenna terminals are utilized [6]. Also, 
it approaches the capacity as the number of users grows toward infinity, since in 
this case user selection benefits from the abundance of spatial directions and the 
multiuser diversity effect (i.e., users that have both sufficient spatial separation and 
high-gain channels are scheduled). The main drawback of ZF precoding is that it 
is power-inefficient, since the BF vectors do not match to the users’ channels as in 
MRT. Thus, ZF performs poorly at low SNR values.
Regularized ZF (RZF) precoding is an extension of ZF that introduces a con-
trollable amount of MUI at the cell. The value of the coefficient that controls the 
level of the residual MUI is typically set such that the SINR at the users is maxi-
mized. More specifically, in RZF precoding we have [19]

RZF precoding is asymptotically optimal at both low and high SNR and performs 
reasonably well at intermediate SNR values [19]. Moreover, due to the regulariza-
tion of the channel, it is more robust against pathological scenarios such as ill-
conditioned channel matrices. However, the existence of residual MUI complicates 
the power allocation procedure.
We have to note that once a linear precoding scheme has been chosen, the 
optimization of the system’s performance, in terms of the achieved average 
SR throughput, depends on the employed user selection and power allocation 
algorithms.
8.2.3 Coordinated MIMO
Contemporary cellular systems enable the reuse of frequencies at adjacent cells, so 
that the overall capacity is increased. Then, the transmissions are subject to ICI, 
which limits the system-wide SE. The effect of ICI is more prominent at the cell 

292 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
boundaries, where the data signals are attenuated whereas the interfering cochannel 
signals are strong, thus degrading the quality of service (QoS) of the cell-edge users.
MU-MIMO ignores the ICI (i.e., it treats it as noise). This fact motivated the 
study on cMIMO, which represents an extension of MU-MIMO whose goal is 
to mitigate the ICI. More specifically, cMIMO refers to a collection of MIMO 
transmission methods that are based on the cooperation between neighboring cells 
in order to control the ICI. BS cooperation may involve the exchange of control 
information, CSI, or user data over transport links. The various levels of coopera-
tion differ on their transport capacity and latency requirements as well as on their 
performance gains over noncooperative MIMO.
In partial-cooperation variants, such as coordinated BF (CBF), the cooperating 
BSs exchange the channel gains associated with the direct and interfering links, 
possibly in conjunction with control information such as user scheduling or/and 
power allocation data, in order to design their precoders (or their beamformers, 
in the case of single-stream transmission) in such a way, so that the ICI is coordi-
nated [20]. In full-cooperation schemes, on the other hand, these nodes share also 
the user data in order to further improve the performance of the system [20]. In 
the most promising flavor of the latter subset, which is known as JT or network 
MIMO, the cooperating BSs serve jointly the cell-edge users, thus forming essen-
tially a composite antenna array. In this case, the ICI is actually exploited instead of 
mitigated, that is, the interfering signals are turned into data signals [20].
The precoding schemes employed in cMIMO are typically generalizations/ 
extensions of the ones utilized in MU-MIMO.
8.3 Constructive-Interference Zero Forcing Precoding
Constructive-interference ZF (CI-ZF) precoding is a symbol-level variant of the 
conventional, user-level ZF precoding scheme. Similar to DPC, CIZF takes advan-
tage of the availability of all data symbols at the BS prior to DL transmission to 
predict the interference and zero-force only the destructive interference, while leav-
ing the CI unaffected [11,21].

Hence, in order to apply channel-aware precoding to a single-fed LC-PAA, we have 
to map the precoded symbols to the antenna currents as follows [22]: 
 
i

(8.31)
After calculating the required currents for the desired precoding scheme and the 
given input signal format according to Equation 8.31, we should compute the corre-
sponding loading values according to Equation 8.28 under the constraint of a positive 
input resistance, that is, Re Zin
{
} > 0, in order to ensure that the antenna system will 
not reflect power back [23]. The value of the input resistance depends on the imped-
ances of the loads, which are determined by the antenna currents. The latter, in turn, 
depend on the precoded signals. Hence, it becomes apparent that this design condi-
tion cannot be met for any given input signal constellation or precoding scheme.
On the other hand, single-fed LC-PAAs can admit any input signal in transmit 
BF applications, since the array manifold required to shape the radiation pattern as 
desired does not depend on the format of the input signal. The role of the parasitic 
loads in this case is to generate currents with appropriate magnitude and phase 
shift, so that the desired beam is produced. This is similar with the functionality of 
BF weights in conventional antenna arrays. The only condition that has to be met is 
that the loadings should be tuned within a range of reasonable values.
Based on this remark, we suggest an alternative approach for performing robust, 
low-complexity, arbitrary channel-aware precoding with single-fed LC-PAAs: 
 
1. First, we apply transmit BF using any valid method.
 
2. Then, we perform channel-aware precoding over the employed beam.
By taking advantage of the radiation pattern reconfiguration capabilities of single-
fed LC-PAAs through the decoupling of the problem to a BF and a precoding 
part, we overcome the circuit stability and implementation complexity issues. This 
approach can be generalized to MAMP arrays as well.

of different beam patterns in response to input data vector symbols, we are able 
to spatially multiplex M  data streams using an M -element single-RF LC-PAA. 
Therefore, we can argue that the aerial DoF (ADoF) of a single-RF LC-PAA equal 
the number of its elements [7,24]. However, this result represents only an upper bound 
for the effective DoFs (EDoFs) of the array, since, depending on the geometry and the 
dimensions of the LC-PAA, the radiation efficiency of some basis patterns may be 
negligible [7,24].
In [25], the authors argue that the EDoF of an M -element single-RF LC-PAA 
equal M  only if the impedances of the (

M −
 loads are complex (e.g., the parasitic 
loads are active circuits); otherwise (e.g., when varactor diodes are used), the ADoF 
equal (

 real values (e.g., the reactance 
of the varactor diodes) and one complex value (i.e., the input voltage). This find-
ing seems to comply with the examples in [7], where a 3-element and a 5-element 
single-RF LC-PAA using varactor diodes as parasitic loads provides 2 and 3 EDoF, 
respectively.
8.6  A Communication Protocol for  Low-Mobility 
Scenarios
As the number of antennas in the BSs grows, the CSI feedback overhead grows as well 
and becomes a limiting factor in the system’s design and performance. LC-PAAs solves 
this problem, since they provide the same DoF with equivalent DAAs while using a 
limited number of active antennas. However, the computational complexity related 
with the dynamic calculation of the parasitic loads’ impedances discourages the 
application of the LC-PAA technology in practice. Moreover, regardless of the type 
of arrays used in MIMO systems, the beam tracking procedure is fairly complex, 
especially as we move to higher frequencies, where typically the beams are narrower.
In this Section, we describe a communication protocol for MU-MIMO/cMIMO 
LC-PAA-equipped systems, which can be utilized in low-mobility scenarios and 
addresses the aforementioned issues. More specifically, we assume that instead of tun-
able loads, the LC-PAAs employ a number of fixed loading sets. Each one of them cor-
responds to a predetermined radiation pattern (i.e., a beam). A simple RF switch allows 
us to connect the passive antenna elements to the desired loading set (Figure 8.2).
The system operation is divided in three phases [19]: 
 
1. Learning phase: For each beam combination, the BS(s) sends a pilot signal. 
Then, the UTs measure their SINR or estimate the gain of the direct and 
cross channels and report back this channel quality metric.
 
2. Beam-selection phase: After switching through all possible beam combinations, 
the BS(s) selects the optimum one, in terms of the achieved SR throughput, 
based on the information reported by the UT.
 
3. Transmission phase: The BS(s) transmits over the selected beams.

298 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
The use of fixed beams reduces the complexity of load calculation and beam track-
ing. Moreover, the use of SINR feedback further reduces complexity, since it is commonly 
much easier to measure the SINR than to estimate the gain of a number of channels. 
After SINR-feedback-based beam selection, a CSI-feedback procedure for the 
selected composite beam-channel takes place, in order to enable the use of precoding.
8.7 Design of LC-PAAs
Designing LC-PAAs is an integral part of the wireless communication protocol out-
lined in the previous Section. In all the following cases, a commercially available elec-
tromagnetic analysis software was used. This software uses the finite element method 
(FEM) in order to simulate the desired antenna design and it provides a wide variety 
of results. Other similar software use the method of moments (MoM) or the finite-
difference time-domain (FDTD) method, yielding very similar results. In our case, 
we are mainly interested in the scattering parameters (S-parameters) and the 3D far 
field radiation pattern of the antenna. The first is presented to verify that the antenna 
resonates at the desired frequency, while the latter is used to show where the electro-
magnetic radiation is directed and it is presented via the three main planes of the 3D 
far field radiation pattern, namely the X-Z, the X-Y and the Y-Z planes.
In our designs we used as dielectric board either the FR-4 or the Rogers 
RO4350 material. The FR-4 board has relative permittivity (

8.7.1 Cross-Like Parasitic Antenna Array at 2.5 GHz
The first design that was studied was a simple patch parasitic antenna array. It is 
known that by varying the length of the two sides of the patch, one can change its 
resonant frequency. Also, by varying the feeding point position of the patch, one 
can alter the input impedance of the patch in order to match the resistance of the 
feeding line (which in our case was a 50 Ohm coaxial cable with SMA connec-
tors). In close vicinity to the active patch, about 2 mm far, four identical parasitic 
(nonfeeding) patches were placed. This design for the cross parasitic antenna array, 
is presented in Figure 8.3. In this cross-like configuration of the patch parasitic 
antenna array, the center element is the only one that is active, that is, connected to 
an RF chain, while the surrounding patch elements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are terminated to 
precalculated loads (capacitors in this case with impedance [
]
−jX ). Thus, the array 
is considered an ESPAR antenna.

8.7.2 Yagi-Uda Parasitic Antenna Array at 2.6 GHz
The initial design of the prototype planar Yagi-Uda model is presented in the 
Figure 8.5. This parasitic antenna resonates at 2.6 GHz. The antenna consists of 
the active dipole (along with its microstrip feeding lines that stretch till the edge of 
the FR-4 dielectric board so that an SMA connector for feeding the antenna can be 
mounted), the six directors that are placed in front of the active dipole (on the same 
side of the FR-4 board as the active dipole, noted as D1–D6) and the two reflectors 
that are placed behind the active dipole (on the back side of the FR-4 board, noted 
as R1–R2). The overall FR4 board’s dimensions are 16 cm by 10 cm.
The role of the directors is to concentrate the electromagnetic field and shape 
the radiation pattern in a desired way. Similarly, the role of the reflectors is to reflect 
the back-scattered radiation. Both the directors and the reflectors are implemented 
by small printed dipoles. Note that in the middle of each dipole there is a small 
gap, where the loads are soldered. The directors are loaded with capacitors, while 
the reflectors are loaded with inductors.
The actual values of the loads that were used, along with their equivalent 
Ohmic resistance at 2.6 GHz are presented in Table 8.2. In Figure 8.6 we present 
the scattering parameters versus frequency and the three main planes of the far field 
radiation pattern.

The first attempt to migrate to higher frequencies (i.e., paving the way to the 18 GHz 
and the 28 GHz regimes) is presented in this section. Initially, in Figure 8.7, we 
present a simple bow-tie patch antenna resonating at 10.23 GHz.
The actual values of the loads that were used, along with their equivalent Ohmic 
resistance at 10.23 GHz are presented in Table 8.3.
In Figure 8.8 we present the scattering parameters versus frequency and the 
three main planes of the far field radiation pattern. It should be noted that the main 
lobe has a half power beam width (HPBW) of around 56 and a gain of 7.4 dBi.

Considering that the active element is similar to a dipole, thus having a donut-
like far-field radiation pattern with a gain of 0 dBi, it is quite impressive that by 
carefully placing the loaded parasitic elements, we confined the far-field radia-
tion pattern to less than 60, while at the same time boosting its gain to 7.4 dBi.
8.7.4 19.25 GHz Bowtie Parasitic Antenna
Migrating to even higher frequencies with the use of parasitic antennas is a fairly 
difficult task. Even a slight change in the dimensions has a large impact on the 
resonant frequency and/or the radiation pattern. This section presents our initial 
simulated results of a K-band (20 GHz) parasitic antenna. In Figure 8.9 we present 
the initial design of the bowtie parasitic antenna array, resonating at 19.25 GHz. It 
consists of one active and ten parasitic elements. The active element is located at the 
center of the dielectric board and it is surrounded by the parasitic elements. Note 
that in the middle of each parasitic element there is a small gap, where the loads 
(capacitors or inductors) are placed.

In this Section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed arbitrary precod-
ing framework for various MIMO setups through a number of numerical simula-
tions. We compare the case where the nodes are equipped with LC-PAAs against 
the scenario where equivalent DAAs are installed on them. The target SNR range 
is (0, 30 dB). The results refer to the average SR throughput obtained after 100 
simulation runs. The simulation is based on a realistic scattering environment. The 
radiation patterns have been generated from appropriate antenna design software.

Some interesting remarks can be made based on Figure 8.13.
 
◾The average SR throughput of nonprecoding-based transmission and MRT 
floors at high SNR due to the residual ICI.
 
◾ZF precoding with LC-PAAs outperforms its omniantenna counterpart over 
the entire SNR range, even when the beam pair selection is based on SINR 
feedback, due to the power gain attributed to transmit BF.
 
◾Beam pair selection based on CSI feedback improves significantly the per-
formance of ZF precoding, since in this case the beam pair selection and 
precoding tasks are performed jointly.
 
◾Nonprecoding-based transmission outperforms ZF precoding with omnian-
tennas over the entire range of relevant SNRs (i.e., until the SR through-
put flooring at the high SNR regime occurs)! In fact, nonprecoding-based 
transmission almost resembles MRT. Hence, we note that we can significantly 
reduce complexity and still pay only a negligible penalty on performance.
 
◾Finally, we note that MRT is optimal at low SNR, ZF with beam pair  selection 
based on CSI feedback is optimal at high SNR, and RZF approaches these 
two extremes at the corresponding SNR regimes while it performs better at 
intermediate SNRs, as expected.
Finally, in Figure 8.14 the performance of CIZF against ZFBF for the setup of 
Figure 8.12 is presented, considering this time systems that operate at 2.6 GHz. The

8.9 Over-the-Air Demonstration
In this Section, we present the results of an OTA demonstration of the aforemen-
tioned robust channel-aware precoding method. For the purposes of the demo, 
three identical parasitic patch arrays as the ones illustrated in Figure 8.3 are placed 
on a single base board and in an angle of 45° with respect to each other, as seen 
in Figure 8.15. Each board is connected to a fixed set of loads. This gave us three 
narrow beams forming at these angles, which could be switched/selected simply 
by controlling an RF switch that has a low insertion low and fast switching time.
For setting up the testbed to demonstrate precoding using parasitic patch anten-
nas, we used the WARP v.3 platform. WARP stands for Wireless Open-Access 
Research Platform and is a scalable and extensible programmable wireless platform, 
built from the ground up to prototype advance wireless networks. These modules 
integrate a high-performance field-programmable gate array (FPGA), two flexible 
RF interfaces and multiple peripherals to facilitate rapid prototyping of custom wire-
less designs. The central controller consists of a single host PC, which uses MATLAB 
to send data and control commands to the radio modules. WARP conveniently pro-
vides an open-source MATLAB-based framework called WARPLab, which allows 
users to control and configure the WARP boards and process transmit and receive 
data samples. This baseline framework is used for rapid physical layer prototyping 
that allows the coordination of arbitrary combinations of single and multiantenna 
transmit and receive nodes. The extensible framework gives users the flexibility to 
develop and deploy large arrays of nodes to meet the application or research need.
The testbed setup is configured for two BSs transmitting concurrently to a 
single user each, while having their antenna arrays placed within a distance of 
Figure 8.15 Antenna prototype and RF-switch control circuit for beam-switching.

few meters. For testing purposes, we have implemented an orthogonal frequency 
division multiplexing (OFDM) transceiver system that utilizes ZFBF, with special 
emphasis on the CSI feedback mechanism which is deemed crucial for a successful 
and adequate interference cancellation.
With the use of pilot signals at the transmitted signal, we can accurately track 
channel state information at the RX and provide feedback via the host PC to the TX 
node for precoding. We have assumed that the channel conditions in a short time 
period remain unchanged in respect to the surrounding environment, so we could 
tolerate a small delay in CSI feedback. To accomplish this, we used channel training 
at the preamble of the transmission. A short training sequence (STS) was sent in order 
to properly select gains, while a long training sequence (LTS) was sent and used by 
the RX to estimate and correct for carrier frequency offset (CFO) as well as timing 
alignment via a cross-correlator. Finally, the preamble was concluded with channel 
training symbols from each of the two transmit antennas. These symbols were used 
to generate the 2
2
×  channel matrix which was used to build the precoder matrix. 
The TX nodes select each time the best beam to transmit, based on the CSI feedback.
We connected two directional parasitic patch antenna arrays at each TX port 
and sent two independent spatial streams of data at the same time and in the same 
frequency band. We also used two omnidirectional monopole antennas at the RX 
ports to disentangle the received data symbols.
As is shown in Figure 8.16, the performance of the system approaches closely 
the theoretical performance. Also, as it was expected, ZFBF outperforms signifi-
cantly raw transmission (i.e., nonprecoded communication).

8.10 Summary and Conclusions
In this chapter, we presented a novel yet realistic technology framework that allows 
us to activate an increased number of spatial degrees-of-freedom in future wireless 
networks with manageable additional hardware complexity. The approach is based 
on the use of load-controlled parasitic antenna arrays, which we advocate as a tech-
nology contender for wireless nodes of either small (e.g., compact) or large (e.g., 
massive) size, operating in either single link or multiuser setups and over frequen-
cies that may range from radio to cm- and even mm-wave.
After reviewing the key attributes of conventional multiantenna systems and 
load-controlled antenna arrays, we focused on the important case of multiuser 
downlink access. For this, we described a robust, low complexity, arbitrary channel-
aware precoding framework for single-fed and multi-RF LC-PAAs.
Capitalizing on this framework, we outlined a communication protocol that 
further reduces the operation complexity of such systems, by avoiding the need 
for dynamic load computation, as well as by reducing drastically the number of 
required channel estimation coefficients. The approach is based on a combination 
of: (1) The use of fixed (precalculated) loads that shape certain possible radiation 
patterns (beams) destined for each user; (2) the choice of preferred combinations 
of the preshaped beams based on channel-dependent switching, thus reducing 
the effective channel dimensionality once the beam combination is chosen; and 
(3) the precoding of the user streams over the chosen beam combination. Due 
to the reduced dimensionality, this approach also reduces channel estimation 
complexity and CSI feedback overhead. The proposed protocol is not limited 
to LC-PAAs, being universally applicable to any kind of antenna arrays whose 
radiation patterns can be computed in an offline fashion and controlled/switched 
dynamically (e.g., it can be used with mechanically steered arrays, conventional 
DAAs, reflect arrays).
The performance of the proposed approach and protocol was evaluated under 
various MIMO setups (MU-MIMO, cMIMO) and frequency bands (2.6, 19 GHz), 
both via numerical simulations and OTA testbed-based experimentations. The 
results showcase the important performance gains of LC-PAAs over conventional 
antenna systems of similar complexity. Our studies included symbol-level ZF pre-
coding, which has the potential to improve the performance of the system in sce-
narios where the SNR is low. Finally, we demonstrated various implementations of 
LC-PAAs operating either in cellular or in cm-wave frequencies.

316 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
9.1 Introduction
Research and development for the 5th-generation (5G) wireless systems has been 
initiated several years ago [1–3]. Such systems, which are set for commercial use 
sometime around 2020, are expected to provide new types of enhanced user con-
nectivity services, in terms of providing very high data rates, increased capacity, 
improved security, higher reliability, reduced latency, increased quality of service 
and availability, and energy efficiency (EE). According to the 5G standard such 
systems should provide higher data rates, for example, tens of Mb/s and accommo-
dating tens of thousands of users providing data rates of 100 Mb/s for metropolitan 
areas. Furthermore, their spectral efficiency (SE) will increase significantly, as com-
pared to the SE achieved by the 4th-generation (4G) wireless systems, their cover-
age will also improve and their latency will be reduced significantly as compared to 
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [2].
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, incorporating multiple 
antennas at the transmitter and/or receiver, constitute a key technology for the 
design of current (4G) and future (5G) wireless communications systems. MIMO 
systems are capable of providing higher data rates and superior error performance 
as compared to their single antenna counterparts without increasing spectrum uti-
lization and transmit power [4,5]. As such, MIMO has become an essential element 
of current wireless communication standards including the IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi), 
WiMAX (4G), and LTE (4G) [5].
The MIMO paradigm can be exploited in different ways to improve the over-
all performance by means of: (1) diversity, (2) antenna array (beamforming), and 
(3) spatial multiplexing. For the diversity case, system performance enhancements 
result from diversity gain, which reduces the bit error rate (BER) for the same SE, as 
the number of transmitting and/or receiving antennas increases. These systems can 
be designed to achieve full diversity gain with relatively low complexity receivers. 
Moreover, they can efficiently deal with channel imperfections that exist in real-
time implementations of MIMO systems [6–9] (Table 9.1). 
In the beamforming case, by exploiting knowledge of the channel at the trans-
mitter and employing singular value decomposition, the channel matrix can be 
decomposed to a number of parallel single-input single-output (SISO) channels. 
The resulting unitary matrices can then be used as pre- and post-filters at the trans-
mitter and receiver, respectively, to increase channel capacity by employing the 
so-called water-filling technique [10,11].
In the spatial multiplexing case, a layered space-time approach is employed to 
transmit multiple independent data streams over the antennas to increase capac-
ity. A representative example of this approach is the so-called vertical Bell Labs 
layered space-time (VBLAST) architecture [4,12] in which a user data stream 
is demultiplexed into a number of substreams which are equal to the number of 
transmitting antennas. If the transmit-to-receive links are sufficiently independent, 
system throughput may be increased linearly with the number of antennas [4,12].

318 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Despite the aforementioned advantages of MIMO systems, their main draw-
back is the increased implementation complexity and cost. More specifically, as 
compared to their SISO counterparts, they are more costly to implement and 
require increased power consumption [13,14]. Their receiver implementation com-
plexity is mainly because of their ability to mitigate inter-channel interference (ICI), 
which is introduced by coupling multiple symbols in both time and space, thus 
increasing the signal processing complexity. In addition, detection algorithms 
require that all symbols are transmitted at the same time and thus sophisticated 
inter-antenna synchronization (IAS) techniques should be employed to exploit the 
benefits of space time-coded and multiuser MIMO transmissions. Finally, multiple 
RF chains are required at the transmitter to simultaneously transmit several data 
streams. Unfortunately, current radio frequency (RF) electronics are expensive, 
difficult to implement, do not follow Moore’s law and as such make the MIMO 
transmitter rather bulky [15].
As far as power consumption requirements are concerned, on the one hand, the 
electronic circuits utilized by MIMO systems, such as RF power amplifiers (PAs), 
mixers, synthesizers and filters, substantially increase the circuit power dissipation of 
the base stations. Recent studies, carried out at the European project EARTH [16],

have suggested that EE decreases linearly with the number of active antennas and 
it depends mostly on the PAs. On the other hand, conventional MIMO com-
munication systems aim at maximizing the capacity under peak or average power 
constraints. Such communication systems may transmit data with the maximum 
allowed power for long periods, and in that sense their design is not energy efficient. 
EE is commonly defined as the transmitted information bits per unit of transmit 
energy and has been studied from an information theoretical perspective [17,18]. It 
is well known that, for an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, the channel 
capacity, C, is given by the well-known Shannon’s formula, that is,

From Equation 9.2, it becomes evident that EE decreases monotonically with ηSE, 
that is, with SE.
Because of the abovementioned disadvantages of conventional MIMO systems, 
recent research efforts have focused on the design of less complex MIMO schemes 
with a limited number of active RF chains and relaxed IAS and ICI requirements. 
At the same time, these systems are still able to exploit all transmit-antenna elements 
for multiplexing and transmit-diversity gains. In this context, the so-called single-
RF MIMO design has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional 
MIMO systems [15].
Figure 9.1 illustrates the block diagrams of a single-RF MIMO system and that 
of a conventional MIMO system. By comparing these two systems, it is noted that 
the single-RF MIMO can achieve the gains of MIMO communications by employ-
ing all available antenna elements. However only one antenna is typically activated 
(single-RF front-end) at the transmitter at any modulation instant [19]. The moti-
vation behind single-RF paradigm originates from the fact that large numbers of 
transmitting antennas may be available at the base stations (BSs) [15,19], especially 
in the emerging millimeter-wave bands [20–23]. This happens since the complexity 
and power consumption/dissipation of MIMO communications are mainly deter-
mined by the number of the number of active RF chains [19]. 

320 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Given the aforementioned considerations, an ideal transmission scheme for 
MIMO systems should have the following operational characteristics. First, it 
should employ one (or just a few) active RF chains but still being able to exploit all 
transmit-antenna elements for multiplexing and transmit-diversity gains. Second, 
it should offer maximum likelihood (ML) optimum decoding performance with 
single-stream decoding complexity. And third, it should work without the need of 
power inefficient linear modulation schemes, such as quadrature amplitude modula-
tion (QAM), or it should allow the use of more power efficient modulation schemes, 
such as phase shift keying (PSK) or continuous phase modulations (CPM).
Recently, the so-called spatial modulation (SM) has been proposed as a 
promising transmission scheme, which reduces the complexity and cost of 
 multiple-antenna schemes [14]. SM can achieve high data rates, improved system 
performance and EE, thus having the inherent potential to meet the aforemen-
tioned desired operational characteristics. It is also noted that SM-MIMO can out-
perform many state-of-the-art MIMO schemes, provided that a sufficiently large 
number of antenna elements is available at the transmitter [24]. These properties 
can be achieved by employing the following simple operational mechanism. At 
any signaling time instance only one transmit-antenna is activated for data trans-
mission and therefore SM can avoid ICI. In this way, no IAS is required and only 
one RF chain is necessary for data transmission. Furthermore, SM employs a low-
complexity  single-stream receiver design for ML decoding. The spatial position 
of each transmit-antenna in the antenna-array is used as a source of information. 
This is realized by employing the so-called SM constellation diagram [25], where a 
one-to-one mapping between each antenna index and a block of information bits 
to be transmitted is performed. The resulting coding mechanism, also known as 
transmit-antenna index coded modulation, allows SM to achieve a spatial multi-
plexing gain with respect to SISO systems.

9.2 Working Principles
In this section, the basic working principles for SM MIMO will be presented. Let 
us consider a MIMO system having Nt and Nr transmitting and receiving anten-
nas, respectively. The system employs either M-PSK or M-QAM where M  is the 
cardinality of the signal constellation diagram. At the receiver, ML detection is 
employed. In Figure 9.2, the SM-MIMO concept is illustrated and compared with 
the orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) scheme proposed by Alamouti 
[6] and the VBLAST scheme [4]. In the first case, two M-PSK/M-QAM symbols, 
S1 and S2 are encoded and simultaneously transmitted from a pair of transmitting 
antennas in two time slots. The spectral rate of the Alamouti scheme equals to

 bits per channel use (bpcu). In VBLAST, S1 and S2 are simulta-
neously transmitted from a pair of transmitting antennas in a single time slot and 
in this case the spectral rate of VBLAST equals to R

The basic idea of SM is to map a block of information bits into two information 
carrying units, namely a symbol that is chosen from a complex signal- constellation 
diagram and a unique transmit-antenna index that is chosen from the set of transmit-
antenna in the antenna array [14]. Essentially, SM is a hybrid modulation and 
MIMO technique in which the modulated signals belong to a 3D constellation 
diagram, which jointly combines signal and spatial information and generalizes the 
well-known 2D (complex) signal-constellation diagram of M-PSK/QAM schemes. 
It is noted that an additional 3rd dimension is provided by the antenna array, where

special case of M =1, the SM-MIMO reduces to the special case of the so-called 
space shift keying (SSK) modulation [26]. According to the operation of SSK, the 
incoming bit stream is encoded into the index of one unique antenna each time

Figure 9.3 presents an example for the encoding mechanism of SM-MIMO for

system with Nt = 4 and M = 2, as shown in Figure 9.4. At the transmitter, the infor-
mation source is divided into blocks containing

block is then processed by a SM mapper, which splits each of them into two sub-
blocks each having

is switched on for data transmission is determined by the bits in the first sub-block. All 
other transmit antennas are kept silent during the current signaling time interval. The 
symbol in the signal constellation diagram is selected based on the bits in the second 
subblock. In the special case, where SSK modulation (instead of SM) is considered, 
each transmit-antenna, when switched on, will transmit exactly the same signal. Thus, 
the information is encoded only in the position within the antenna array.  

Spatial Modulation for 5G Systems ◾ 323
The transmitted by the active antenna signal propagates through a generic wireless 
channel as shown in Figure 9.5. Because of the different spatial positions occupied by 
the transmit-antenna in the antenna array, the signal transmitted by each antenna will 
experience different propagation conditions due to different propagation paths. This 
represents the fundamental working principle of SM since the wireless channel plays

the role of a modulation unit. It is implemented by introducing a distinct fingerprint 
that renders the signal transmitted by distinct transmit-antenna distinguishable at 
the receiver. Note that, if the transmit-to-receive wireless links are not sufficiently dif-
ferent, the signals emitted by the transmit-antenna will look approximately the same 
and hence the receiver will not be able to correctly detect the transmitted signals. The 
receiver exploits the randomness introduced by the wireless channel for signal detec-
tion. As illustrated in Figure 9.6, in order to detect the transmitted signal from the

noisy received signal, the receiver must have a priori knowledge of the channel state 
information (CSI) of all the transmit-to-receive wireless links. Such knowledge can 
be obtained by employing channel estimation techniques [27]. According to the ML 
principle, the receiver computes the Euclidean distance between the received signal 
and the set of all possible signals modulated by the wireless channel and chooses the 
smallest one. In this way, all the bits in the transmitted block can be decoded and the 
original bitstream is recovered [28].  
9.3 Advantages and Disadvantages
In this section the advantages and disadvantages of SM-MIMO, as compared to 
state-of-the-art MIMO communications, will be discussed.
9.3.1 Advantages
The main operational advantages of the SM-MIMO, as compared to conventional 
MIMO schemes, such as VBLAST and the Alamouti space-time schemes, are the 
following: 
 
1. SM entirely avoids ICI and IAS, and requires only a single RF chain at the 
transmitter. This is due to the simple working mechanism of SM where a single 
transmit-antenna is activated, at each time, for data transmission while all the 
other antennas are kept silent. In addition, as compared to the conventional 
SISO system, its 3D constellation diagram introduces a multiplexing gain in 
the spatial domain. This gain logarithmically increases with the number of 
transmit-antennas. When viewed as a coding technique, SM provides a high 
spectrally-efficient code with an equivalent code rate greater than one [25].
 
2. The receiver design is inherently simpler than the one employed by the 
V-BLAST scheme. This is due to the fact that complicated interference cancel-
lation algorithms are not required since SM completely avoids ICI. Another 
advantage of SM is that, unlike conventional spatial-multiplexing methods 
for MIMO systems, SM can attain ML decoding via a simple single-stream 
receiver. Furthermore, SM can work effectively, even when the number of 
receiving antennas is less than the number of transmitting antennas, because 
the receive-antennas are used to achieve only a diversity gain rather than a 
multiplexing gain. In principle, since a single receive-antenna is needed to 
exploit the SM paradigm, it makes it suitable for downlink settings with low-
complexity mobile units.
 
3. Because of its unique operation, SM has the ability to work well in various 
multiple-access scenarios. Due to the fact that different pairs of transmit-
ters and receivers usually occupy different spatial positions, the channel 
impulse response of each pair of users is likely to be statistically different 
from other user pairs. If each intended receiver uses, for data detection, 

326 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
the set of channel impulse responses of all the transmitters (i.e., multiuser 
 detection), several users might share the same wireless resources for com-
munication. In other words, with SM the wireless channel acts as a natural 
source of purely random signatures (i.e., in this case the channel impulse 
responses) for multiple-access.
 
4. SM provides larger capacities than conventional low-complexity coding meth-
ods for MIMO systems, such as OSTBCs because of the multiplexing gain 
achieved by exploiting the spatial domain to convey part of the information bits.
 
5. It is noted that SSK modulation can further reduce the receiver complexity, 
since only the spatial dimension of the 3D constellation diagram is utilized 
for encoding information bits to symbols. Thus, conventional modulation 
schemes such as M-PSK and/or M-QAM are not required for data transmis-
sion. The price to be paid for this complexity reduction is a loss in the achiev-
able data rate [29].
9.3.2 Disadvantages
There are also some disadvantages associated with SM-MIMO, again with respect 
to conventional MIMO schemes, as follows. 
 
1. The main disadvantage of SM-MIMO is that at least two transmit-antenna 
are required to exploit the SM concept. Moreover, if the transmit-to-receive 
wireless links are not sufficiently different, the SM paradigm might not be effi-
ciently used and/or not yield in an adequate performance. This limitation is 
somehow similar to the conventional spatial multiplexing techniques, which 
require a rich-scattering environment to guarantee a significant boost in the 
achievable data rate [4].
 
2. Another disadvantage is that the receiver requires perfect CSI for data detec-
tion. This might pose complexity constraints on the channel estimation unit, 
as well as some overhead which are necessary for channel estimation.
 
3. When compared to more conventional MIMO systems, for example, 
V-BLAST, SM can offer only a logarithmic (instead of linear) increase of the 
data rate with the number of transmit-antenna. This might limit SM to achieve 
very high spectral rates for small numbers of antennas at the transmitter.
9.4 Transmission Techniques
In this section, various transmission techniques for SM-MIMO will be dis-
cussed. The simplest transmission technique for SM-MIMO is the SSK 
modulation. Let us assume that the source produces a random sequence of inde-
pendent bits, b =[ ,

for the encoding of SSK when Nt = 4 transmitting antennas are used, resulting in a 
spectral rate of 2 bpcu. As previously mentioned, SM and SSK are appealing because 
of their single RF configuration which greatly simplifies the transmitter structure 
as compared to the more complex MIMO schemes, such as the VBLAST. However, 
their corresponding spectral rates are

respectively, as opposed to the VBLAST scheme which achieves a spectral rate of

 bpcu. Nevertheless, rate and complexity can be traded off by allowing 
more than one active antennas in each time slot. The resulting schemes are known 
as generalized SSK (GSSK) [30] and generalized SM (GSM) [31].
GSSK uses nt out of Nt available antenna indices to convey information. 
Therefore, there are

. For example, with nt = 2 and Nt = 7, 
the number of possible combinations is 
′ =

21. Since the constellation sizes 
are multiples of 2, only 16 out of the possible 21 combinations can be used. 
Although the set of antenna combinations, χ, may be chosen at random, there 
also exist optimal selection rules [30]. Table 9.3 presents an example of 8-ary 
GSSK with Nt = 5, nt = 2, with randomly chosen χ.

the factors affecting system performance, for example, the impact of wireless propaga-
tion on the end-to-end error probability and achievable rate, identifying propagation 
scenarios in which the adoption of SM-MIMO is useful and the achievable diversity 
order. On the other hand, such analytical results are useful to the system engineer for 
performance evaluation purposes as they can provide guidelines for system design 
and optimization. In this section, the performance analysis of SM-MIMO over fad-
ing channels will be discussed. It is noted that the analysis presented herein is valid 
for arbitrarily distributed fading envelopes and channel phases. In order to simplify 
the underlying mathematical analysis, a tight union bound for the evaluation of the 
average bit error probability (ABEP) will be presented.

9.6 SM-MIMO for 5G Wireless Communications
In this section, we focus on the application of SM-MIMO for future 5G wire-
less communications. Firstly, the relationship between SM-MIMO and massive 
MIMO is discussed [42]. Then, GSM is introduced as an efficient way to utilize 
large-scale transmit antennas available in massive MIMO systems. The combi-
nation of both orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single 
carrier (SC) with SM-MIMO is also considered as a means of improving the 
performance of 5G systems in frequency selective fading channels. We close this 
discussion by mentioning some MIMO transmission schemes closely related to 
the SM-MIMO paradigm, such as single RF MIMO schemes based on compact 
parasitic architectures, the incremental MIMO and the antenna subset modula-
tion (ASM) schemes.

Spatial Modulation for 5G Systems ◾ 333
9.6.1 SM and Massive MIMO
The motivation behind the use SM-MIMO for the design of spectral- and energy-
efficient future generation wireless communication systems is two-fold, as follows: 
 
◾Firstly, to minimize, under performance constraints, the number of active 
antenna elements in order to increase the EE by reducing the circuit power 
consumption.
 
◾Secondly, to maximize, under implementation and size constraints, the 
 number of passive antenna elements in order to increase both SE and EE by 
reducing the transmit power consumption [14].
The design of massive MIMO schemes that retain the benefits of multiple-antenna 
transmission while having a single active RF element is another recently intro-
duced but important trend for current and future MIMO R&D activities. Massive 
MIMO are systems that use antenna arrays with an order of magnitude more ele-
ments than in currently available MIMO systems. They are designed to employ a 
large number of antennas, typically not less than 100, at the base station. Clearly 
such systems entail an unprecedented number of antennas simultaneously serv-
ing a much smaller number of terminals, with each antenna unit using extremely 
low power (typically of the order of mW). One of their advantages is that several 
expensive and bulky items, such as long coaxial cables, can be eliminated alto-
gether. Massive MIMO designs can be made extremely robust, since when one 
or even a few of the antenna units fail, their performance will not be significantly 
altered. The main effect of increasing the number of antennas is that uncorrelated 
thermal noise and fast fading can be averaged out and vanish so that the system 
performance is predominantly limited by interference from other transmitters. As 
the number of antennas tends to infinity, uncorrelated interference, noise, and CSI 
errors vanish [42–44]. In addition to the earlier, the achieved spectral efficiency is 
independent of bandwidth [42,43].
For all the previous reasons, SM seems to be an appealing transmission tech-
nology for high-rate and low-complexity MIMO implementations that exploit the 
massive MIMO paradigm. In this respect, SM can be regarded as a low-complexity 
modulation scheme exploiting the massive MIMO idea with the use of a single 
active RF chain.
9.6.2 GSM for Massive MIMO
Recent research efforts have focused on increasing the efficiency of conventional 
SM for future wireless communication systems by combing spatial modula-
tion and spatial multiplexing. The previously discussed GSM is quite attractive 
because of its ability to work well with smaller numbers of transmit RF chains 

334 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
as compared to other more traditional spatial multiplexing, for example the 
VBLAST system [31].
As previously mentioned, in GSM the transmitted information is conveyed in 
the activated combination of transmit antennas whereas the transmitted symbol is 
chosen from a signal constellation. Transmitting the same data symbol from more 
than one antenna at a time, retains the key advantage of SM, which is the complete 
avoidance of ICI at the receiver. Moreover, GSM offers spatial diversity gains and 
increases the reliability of the wireless channel, by providing replicas of the transmit-
ted signal to the receiver. Because of these reasons, GSM is regarded as a promising 
technique for massive MIMO in 5G wireless systems [45].
A main drawback of GSM is that the increase of possible antenna combinations 
results in an increase of the detection complexity at the receiver. Thus research 
efforts have focused on the development of low-complexity near-ML detec-
tors which can be used to incorporate GSM-MIMO into more practical system 
implementations [46].
9.6.3  Spatial Modulation-Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplexing
Although most of current research efforts assume flat fading for spatial modulation-
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SM-MIMO), the influence of frequency 
selective fading cannot be neglected in 5G broadband wireless channels. OFDM is 
an efficient way to combat frequency selective fading and has been adopted by most 
current wireless communication standards. Note that the combination of SM-MIMO 
with OFDM is regarded as an attractive technique for future wireless systems [47–49].
As compared to current MIMO-OFDM techniques, some of the advantages of 
the SM-OFDM are the following. 
 
◾Lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR): High PAPR of the transmitted 
signals is one of the main limitations of OFDM systems. Due to the special 
structure of SM, SM-OFDM transmit signals are sparse in the frequency 
domain, thus facilitating the construction of lower PAPR transmit signals to 
improve the efficiency of high power amplifiers (HPA) [50].
 
◾Low-complexity parameter estimation: In SM-OFDM systems, the estimation 
of timing offset, carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel coefficient are 
very important for signal detection. The structure of SM-MIMO reduces the 
interference among antennas and thus such parameter estimations can be 
significantly simplified estimation [45,47].
Note also that SM-OFDM systems have also limitations which should be fully con-
sidered in future system design. For example, after the inverse fast Fourier transform 
(IFFT) transform process takes place, all transmitting antennas of SM-OFDM will 

Spatial Modulation for 5G Systems ◾ 335
be occupied by time-domain signals. In this way, the single-antenna activation 
feature is lost in SM-OFDM and thus its complexity is greater than that of the 
conventional SM.
9.6.4 Spatial Modulation—Single Carrier
SM-SC is a technique for dealing with frequency selective fading in a similar fash-
ion as OFDM and as such is an attractive transmission scheme for 5G communica-
tions [51–54]. As compared to SM-OFDM, SM-SC has several advantages with the 
most important one being that it can maintain the single-antenna-activation fea-
ture as the conventional SM while combating frequency selective fading. Therefore, 
it can be used to efficiently implement large-scale SM-MIMO systems by reducing 
the number of RFs chains. Furthermore, it can achieve lower PAPR compared to 
conventional SM-OFDM [51,54].
Despite these advantages, there exist several challenges in SM-SC system 
design, for example, reducing the high complexity of their detector. On the one 
hand, ML detection is essential for improving the performance, while on the other 
hand, hardware complexity inherent to the design of a ML detector for such sys-
tems is prohibitively high. Therefore, several practical problems related to complex-
ity, performance, and practical implementation, should be addressed before SM-SC 
can be utilized in 5G communications.
Research efforts in this field has focused on several directions, including the 
efficient design and implementation of the following: 
 
◾Frequency-domain signal detection techniques [52]. Research efforts have 
focused on the design of near-ML detectors for performing a near ML detec-
tion for SM-SC signals [52]. However, the computational complexity still 
remains large in practical implementations.
 
◾Time-domain signal detection techniques [54]. Such techniques seem to have a 
better trade-off between complexity and performance.
 
◾Turbo detection schemes, for which combination of soft-in soft-out (SISO) 
equalizer and decoder can efficiently improve the system performance of 
SM-SC with relatively low computational complexity [52,54].
Moreover, comparison studies between SM-ODFM and SM-SC should be carried 
out as was done for SC-FDMA and OFDMA satellite up-links [55].
9.6.5  Miscellaneous Transmission Schemes 
Related to SM-MIMO
9.6.5.1 MIMO Designs Based on Compact Parasitic Architectures
Multiple antenna designs based on compact parasitic architectures that enable mul-
tiplexing gains with a single active RF element and many passive antenna elements 

336 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
have been proposed in [19]. As shown in Figure 9.7, the key idea is to change the 
radiation pattern of the antenna array at each symbol time instance, and to encode 
independent information streams onto angular variations of the far-field in the 
wave-vector domain. 
In Figure 9.7 a switched parasitic array is depicted, consisting of one central 
active element driven by the PA of the device, and two colinear parasitic elements 
that may be either open or short circuited using high speed p-i-n diodes and digital 
control signals. When both peripheral elements are open-circuited, the radiation 
pattern is omnidirectional in the azimuth plane. When one peripheral element is 
open circuited and the other short circuited, then a cardioid pattern is produced 
with a maximum toward the direction of the short-circuited element. SM-MIMO 
employs a single-RF chain in a similar fashion as the parasitic MIMO scheme but 
the information is encoded onto the transmit antenna switching mechanism, rather 
than onto the radiation pattern of the antenna array.
9.6.5.2 Incremental MIMO
This is another MIMO related scheme which jointly combines multiple-antenna 
transmission and automatic repeat request (ARQ) feedback to avoid keeping all 
available antennas active, thus enabling MIMO gains with a single RF chain and 
a single PA [56]. As shown in Figure 9.8, the main idea of this so-called incre-
mental MIMO scheme, is to reduce complexity and to improve EE by activating 
one antenna at a given time slot. It also exploits ARQ feedback to randomly cycle 
through the available antennas at the transmitter in case of incorrect data recep-
tion. SM-MIMO has the characteristic of being an open-loop scheme, while the 
incremental single-RF MIMO is a closed-loop scheme using ARQ feedback.

Spatial Modulation for 5G Systems ◾ 337
9.6.5.3 Antenna Subset Modulation
New directional modulation schemes for mm-Wave frequencies have been also pro-
posed to enable secure and low-complexity wireless communications. Such a system 
employs the so-called ASM [57]. As shown in Figure 9.9, the main idea in ASM 
is to modulate the radiation pattern at the symbol rate by driving only a subset of 
antennas in the array. While the random switching antenna subsets do not affect 
the symbol modulation for a desired receiver along the main direction, it effectively 
randomizes the amplitude and phase of the received symbol for an eavesdropper 
along a side lobe.
This feature gives to the ASM scheme an advantage in supporting secure com-
munications while the SM-MIMO provides higher bit rates. Moreover, ASM 
uses directional beamforming to mitigate the impact of path loss, atmospheric 
absorption, and high noise levels present at millimeter-wave frequencies, whereas 
SM-MIMO schemes are not designed to provide beamforming gains.

10.1 Introduction
Device-to-device (D2D) communication is recognized as one of the technology 
components of the evolving 5G architecture by the European Union project 
METIS [1]. METIS stands for mobile and wireless communications enablers 
for  the twenty-twenty information society. The METIS project is currently 
evaluating the role that D2D technology can play in various scenarios such 
as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, national security, and public safety, 
cellular network offloading, or service advertisement. In D2D communication, 
device user equipment (DUE) transmit data signals to each other over a direct link 
using the cellular resources instead of through the evolved node B (eNB), which 
differs from femtocell where users communicate with the help of small low-power 
cellular base stations (BSs).
A survey of the many proposals for D2D communication can be found in [2,3]. 
A main distinction among existing proposals is between underlay and overlay sys-
tems [4]. Most attention draws D2D communications as an underlay to the cel-
lular. In this scenario, DUE communicates directly using the same resources as the 
cellular system. Therefore, the potential of improving spectral utilization has pro-
moted much work in recent years, which shows that D2D can improve system per-
formance by reusing cellular resources [5]. The reason to reuse the licensed instead 
of the unlicensed spectrum is that the former can operate in a controlled (by the 
BS) environment whereas the latter may not provide quality of service (QoS) guar-
antees because of uncontrollable interference in the unlicensed spectrum.
In D2D underlay systems, the level of control exercised by the eNB may vary 
depending on the QoS constraints imposed to the cellular and the D2D users. 
Most works consider that the eNB controls the resources used for cellular commu-
nications and by the D2D link. The eNB can set constraints on the transmit power 
of D2D transmitters (Txs) to limit the interference experienced by the cellular 
receivers. Therefore, interference coordination mechanisms enable underlay D2D 
communications [6].
In D2D overlay systems, a part of the cellular spectrum is assigned to D2D 
transmissions. Therefore, no interference occurs between cellular users equipment 
(CUE) and DUE. However, reusing the same subchannels (SCs) by different D2D 
pairs will result in cochannel interference for the D2D links. It must be noted that 
most of the results on D2D link performance are based on simulation [7], in order 
to capture (1) the random locations of devices and cellular users, (2) the available

resources of the eNB based on traffic load, and (3) fading and path loss models 
for the cellular users and D2D links. Nevertheless, analytical results can also be 
obtained on D2D performance metrics to capture the impact of various system 
parameters [8,9].
One fundamental design consideration for D2D neighbor discovery and com-
munications is the choice of resources to use for transmission. In principle, it should 
be possible to use either the uplink (UL) or downlink (DL) resources for D2D 
transmissions. In the case where UL resources are used for D2D transmissions in 
underlay systems, as shown in Figure 10.1a, the D2D transmissions cause intercell 
interference to neighbor BSs; pretty much in the same way as in current systems. 
The D2D receivers (Rxs) are on the other hand interfered by inter-cell nearby cel-
lular devices transmitting to the eNB. On the other hand, in the case where DL 
resources are used for D2D transmission, as shown in Figure 10.1b, the D2D trans-
mitting devices interfere to other CUEs receiving normal communications on the 
DL resources. Conversely, the eNBs in that case interfere with the D2D transmis-
sions. The impact of interference from CUEs and DUEs using the same subchan-
nels on the establishment of a new D2D link is a major issue. Moreover, the system 
designer needs to determine the main design parameters, taking also into consider-
ation spectrum sharing criteria and D2D network connectivity. Finally, the impact 
of D2D links to the cellular performance needs to be investigated.
DUE may operate in both cellular and D2D modes. Mode selection is usu-
ally based on measurements to check (1) if the D2D devices are in communica-
tion range and (2) if D2D communication actually offers higher throughput 
than cellular communication. However, in order to limit the interference of 
D2D connections to the cellular network, the eNB should be able to control the 
maximum transmit power of D2D transmitters [5]. Interference coordination 
resembles the one found in underlay cognitive radio systems, where the transmit 
power of a secondary user in constrained by the interference imposed to the 
primary receiver.

10.2 Spectrum Sharing and Interference
In conventional cellular networks, interference emanates from fixed BS locations in the 
DL and worst case interference scenarios with the CUE located close to the cell edge is 
usually considered. In heterogeneous multitier wireless networks, stochastic geometry 
is employed to model the randomly located interference sources within a macrocell. 
Using homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) to model the random locations of 
interfering sources, the aggregate interference at a receiver located at the origin of a 
two-dimensional (2D) circular plane is known to follow the alpha-stable distribution. 
Using the HPPP model, various performance results for heterogeneous K -tier wire-
less networks can be obtained, such as signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) 
statistics, association probability to a k-tier, k
K
=
⋅⋅⋅

,
 BS, coverage probability, bit 
error rate performance and throughput, as a function of the node density for the k-tier 
network. It follows that stochastic geometry modeling is also applicable to model the 
aggregate interference generated by CUEs and D2D links.
In underlay-inband systems, the D2D links can employ either UL or DL fre-
quency resources of a frequency division duplexing (FDD) system. The introduc-
tion of D2D links inside a macro-cell creates additional interference to the CUEs 
when using DL resources and to the macro BS when using UL resources. It has 
recently been decided in 3GPP to use UL resources for the study item work [10]. 
The use of UL frequencies for D2D links will impact the SINR at the macro BS, 
which will be better when D2D pairs are farther away from the BS. On the other 
hand, using UL resource sharing, the strength of interference experienced by D2D 
links depends not only on the position of D2D users, but also on the position of 
the CUE.
In overlay-inband systems, there is dedicated bandwidth for D2D transmis-
sions which can be further partitioned into SCs with each D2D transmitting in 
only one of them. However, the possibility of one SC used by many D2D links can 
be allowed. For this scenario, an uncoordinated (probabilistic) scheduling scheme 
is the simplest option where each D2D Tx randomly and independently selects 
one of the available SCs for transmission. However, coordinated network-assisted 
scheduling can also be employed in order to reduce the interference induced to 
D2D links. In [8], a random time-frequency hopping channel access scheme for 
D2D transmissions is proposed and its performance is analyzed. Moreover, power 
control schemes can limit the transmit power of D2D Txs which will lead to D2D 
SINR degradation but will decrease the interference induced to CUEs or the BS.
For both underlay and overlay systems, the appearance of uncoordinated D2D 
transmissions inside a macro-cell with potential D2D Txs located randomly inside 
the cell has forced researchers to use stochastic geometry in order to accurately 
model the induced cochannel interference. A commonly adopted interference 
model in many ad-hoc and cognitive radio networks is based on the assump-
tion that the interferers are scattered according to a spatial HPPP and operate 
asynchronously in a wireless environment that is subject to path-loss, fading, and

shadowing. It can be shown that the aggregate interference in these networks fol-
lows an α-stable distribution with well-specified characteristic function [11–13].
10.2.1 Distribution of the Aggregate Interference
Let us consider a wireless system where the desired signal of a given user is corrupted by 
both a number of interfering signals and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with 
single-sided power spectral density N0. The number of interfering signals is a Poisson 
distributed discrete random variable (RV) and belongs to a HPPP . This implies that 
if the average number of transmitting terminals per unit area around a given node is λ, 
then the number of transmitting nodes in an area A is a Poisson RV with parameter Aλ.
The instantaneous output SINR can be expressed as

where:
Ps is the transmitting power of the desired signal
ds is the distance between the desired transmitter and the receiver
as is the Rayleigh-faded amplitude of the desired signal
ξi is the fading amplitude of the ith interfering signal
It is assumed that all interfering signals are transmitted with the same power PI [14], 
but experience mutually independent path loss and Rayleigh fading. Moreover, it 
is assumed that the interferers are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). 
Also, ri is the distance from the interfering terminal i to the receiver, while ν ( > 2)
ν
 
is the path loss exponent in the environment surrounding the receiver.

When the interfering signals sum incoherently, the aggregate interference can 
be modeled as an α-stable RV. Thus, with an appropriate choice of the system 
parameters and assuming that ri is uniformly distributed in an unbounded region 
around the receiver, it can be shown that the moments generating function of the 
aggregate interference in a wireless network can be expressed in terms of the system 
parameters as [14,15]

10.2.3 Numerical and Computer Simulation Results
In this section, we illustrate the derived expressions and study the impact of the spa-
tial density of interferers on the ABEP of BPSK. Figure 10.2 depicts the ABEP as a 
function of P N
I/
0 for various values of λ, assuming ds =1, ν = 3, and P N
s/
15
0 =
dB. 
As it is expected, the ABEP increases as P N
I/
0 increases. Moreover, the impact of 
P N
I/
0 on the ABEP depends also on λ and as it can be observed, it is more severe 
for high values of the interferer’s density. Finally, the numerically evaluated results 
match perfectly with equivalent ones obtained using Monte Carlo simulations.
10.3 D2D Neighbor Discovery
The work in [4] investigates a distance-based D2D mode selection: cellular mode 
is used if the distance to a D2D Rx is greater than a mode selection threshold; 
otherwise, D2D mode is selected. If we assume that the received signal power 
(averaged over fast fading) is only a function of distance and pathloss exponent, 
distance-based D2D mode selection is equivalent to the average received-signal-
power or average SNR based mode selection. Once users realize high D2D speeds 
are possible, more local sharing is likely to occur. So far, no commonly agreed upon 
D2D distance distribution has appeared in the literature. In the absence of such an 
accepted model, similar to [4], we assume that each potential D2D Rx is randomly 
and independently placed around its associated potential D2D Tx according to a

It follows that by replacing the SNR association metric with the SIR or SINR asso-
ciation metrics, the previous results in Equations 10.20 through 10.22 hold by just 
replacing FSNR( )
β  with FSIR( )
β  and FSINR( )

10.3.3 Numerical and Computer Simulation Results
Some representative examples illustrate the formulations derived here. A large 
circular area with radius R = 600 m is used to approximate the infinite area of the 
PPP in the simulation model. All plots consider Nakagami-m fading with ms = 2 
for the desired signal and Rayleigh fading (i.e., mI =1) with ΩI =10 dB for the 
interference signal at the device receiver. Figure 10.3 portrays the probability of 
finding at least one DUE Rx to connect to as a function of Pt under SINR/SNR/
SIR association metrics, assuming R = 600 m, ν = 3.5, λ =
−
10 4  (corresponds to 
average number of devices equal to 113 for the area considered), and β = 5 dB. 
The value of Pt was obtained using the relationship P

, assuming 
N = −105 dBm and K = −35 dB. The figure shows the impact of the associa-
tion metric employed on the probability of finding at least one neighbor device 
receiver to connect to. We observe that analytical results match our computer 
simulation ones.
Figure 10.4 depicts the association probability to at least one DUE Rx as a 
function of DUE density λ, assuming Pt =10 dBm, ν = 4, and β = 5 dB. As it is 
expected, association probability increases as the number of DUE Rxs randomly 
located inside the circular area increases. Finally, comparisons of numerically eval-
uated results with equivalent ones obtained using Monte Carlo simulations, clearly 
show that there is practically no distinction between the simulated and theoretical 
curves.

10.4 D2D Link Performance with Power Control
In this section we consider the scenario where D2D users communicate underlay to 
CUEs using uplink resources with the goal of protecting the BS. One way of such 
protection is to limit the transmission power of D2D users. Therefore, all D2D 
transmissions are allowed as long as the generated interference on the BS remains 
below an interference threshold I [20]. Thus, the transmit power of a D2D Tx 
should be constrained as follows [21]

. Under 
these assumptions and based on Equation 10.33, the OP is plotted as a function 
of the maximum allowed transmission power, Pmax, and for different values of the 
maximum tolerable interference level I. It is shown that the performance improves 
with the increase of Pmax, reaching in all cases a floor for higher values of Pmax. The 
performance also improves for higher values of I.
For obtaining Figure 10.6, we have assumed the same values for the shaping and 
scaling parameters, M

ted as a function of γth for different values of the maximum allowable transmission

10.5 Effect of Mobility
In static wireless networks, a uniform distribution is usually adopted to model the 
node distribution in order to study network capacity and connectivity properties 
[23,24]. However, the presence of mobility which is an inherent feature of many 
wireless networks, requires a more realistic and nonuniform model for the spatial 
distribution of the mobile nodes. With mobile receiving nodes in which the trans-
mit power remains constant but the propagation distance is a RV because of node 
mobility, the conditional PDF of the received SNR, given the transmitter-receiver 
distance r, is given by Equation 10.7. The unconditional distribution of the received 
SNR can be obtained by averaging Equation 10.7 over the PDF of distance of a 
particular node from the access point over the unit space [0,1], that is,

Several mobility models are available to characterize the distribution of the transmitter-
receiver distances in a mobile environment. In the random waypoint (RWP) mobility 
model, it is usually assumed that the receiving nodes are located at randomly selected 
coordinate points in the service area, which depends on the network topology. For 
a one-dimensional (1D) topology, we consider a line with the transmitter or access 
point being located at the origin. The two-dimensional (2D) topology is assumed 
to be a circle of unit radius, while a three-dimensional (3D) topology is a spherical 
network with unit radius. In both the 2D and 3D network topologies, it is assumed 
that the transmitter is located at the origin. The receiving node is located at a ran-
domly selected location within the communication range of the transmitter. The 
steady state spatial node distributions for the RWP mobility models are polynomials 
in the transmitter-receiver distance r. Therefore, for each of these models, the PDF of 
the distance for a realistic mobility scenario with 0 ≤

10.5.4 Numerical and Computer Simulation Results
In this section, we assume a 2D topology with a D2D Rx moving around the D2D 
Tx according to the RWP mobility model over a maximum distance of D = 50 m. 
In Figure 10.7, we examine the effect of the path-loss exponent for the desired signal 
and cochannel interference with average INR ΩI =10 dB on the D2D link perfor-
mance of a mobile DUE Rx. We plot the outage probability versus transmit power 
Pt of the DUE Tx for path loss exponents ν = {3,4} for the desired signal assum-
ing Nakagami-m fading channels with ms = 2 and mI =1, and threshold θ = 5 dB.

364 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
For the noise-only case considered, the outage probability is found to be consider-
ably lower for smaller values of ν, due to higher values of average received SNR. 
However, in the presence of interference, we observe much higher outage probabili-
ties than for the noise-only case for both values of ν, with the performance gap to 
increase considerably as ν decreases.
10.6  User Selection in Mobile Device-to-Device 
Communications
The vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications are considered to be an integral 
part of the 5G networks. Based on these systems, important improvements are 
expected in road safety, traffic efficiency, and comfort to both the drivers and the 
passengers. These systems’ performance depends, mainly, on the channel model, 
which is sufficiently different from the classical cellular one. Reasons for this 
include, the equal heights of the transmitter and the receiver, their movement, 
the surrounding scatterers, the highly dynamic propagation conditions and so on. 
Well established distributions that have been widely employed to model V2V 
channel conditions are the ones that are based on the multiple scattering radio 
propagation channels [28]. Using this generic model, and under the assumption 
that only double scattering effects are present, new families of distributions are 
proposed, namely double-Rayleigh, double-Nakagami, and double-Rice [29–31]. 
A common assumption in all these models is that both the transmitter and the 
receiver are in motion.
Toward enabling V2X communication in 5G systems, several requirements 
should be satisfied, including (1) low latency, (2) high reliability, and (3) high 
throughput. In this context, cooperative relaying is expected to play an impor-
tant role for improving spatial diversity in V2X communication networks, 
by extending wireless network coverage with low energy budget. Moreover, by 
applying cooperative relaying to multiuser communication scenarios, a new 
network architecture has been introduced known as multiuser relay network 
(MRN) architecture. Investigating new distributed and centralized user selection 
techniques is therefore an important topic for research in V2X communications 
[32,33].
10.6.1 System Model
We consider a two-phase multiuser cooperative V2V communication network, 
where M  mobile users-sources U j communicate with the destination (D) with the 
help of a relay node (R) as it is shown in Figure 10.8. The relay and destination 
nodes are equipped with single antennas, while no direct link between the mobile 
users and the destination exists, due to severe shadowing. The relay node is assumed 

D2D Communication Aspects for 5G Cellular Networks ◾ 365
to operate in an amplify and forward (AF) half-duplex mode, based on the variable 
gain approach. Moreover, the relay node and the destination are subject to AWGN 
and interfering effects. Finally, all links, including the interfering ones, are subject 
to double-Nakagami (DN) fading.
In the first phase, a user j transmits a signal to the relay. In the second 
phase, the relay transmits a modified version of the received signal to the desti-
nation. In the AF scheme, the relay nodes cannot differentiate between source 
and  interference signals. The instantaneous end-to-end SIR at the destination is 
given by [34]

10.6.2 CSI Model
In a V2V communication scenario, the fading behavior changes rapidly. Hence, 
the CSI of the U
R
j −
 links is assumed to be outdated, due to the delay between 
the user selection and data transmission phases as well as the fast time varying 
nature of the wireless medium. For this reason we consider the model for the 
outdated CSI that is used by many authors in the past, for example, [35]. More 
specifically, the imperfection between the actual SNR of the jth user at the data 
reception instance, γurj, and γurj, which is available during the selection phase, 
can be measured based on a correlation coefficient. In that case, the PDF of the 
actual received SNR (based on the selected user) at the data reception instance can 
be expressed as [35]

374 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
11.1 Introduction
11.1.1 Initial Considerations
Network virtualization is an abstraction process aiming at separating the logi-
cal network functionalities from the underlying physical network resources. It 
enables the aggregation and provision of the network by combining different 
physical networks into a single virtual one, or splitting a physical network into 
multiple virtual ones, which are isolated from each other. Network virtualization 
has been introduced as a tool for large scale experimental networks, for example, 
PlanetLab [1] or GENI [2], but it is also proposed as an approach for the future 
Internet architecture and for the 5th-generation (5G) of mobile communications, 
[3–5]. By enabling a plurality of diverse network architectures to coexist on a 
shared physical substrate, virtualization mitigates the ossifying forces in the cur-
rent architectures and allows the continuous development of innovative network 
technologies [6].
Network virtualization covers aspects like resource virtualization and slicing. 
The virtualization of the physical resources consists of implementing multiple 
instances of a required logical resource on a single machine/node within the same or 
different set of physical resources allocated to the Virtual Network (VNet), the 
slice. When compared to wired ones, wireless resources introduce some new chal-
lenges to virtualization, due to the specific characteristics of the wireless environ-
ment. On one hand, the isolation of traffic cannot be guaranteed due to the scarcity 
of the radio spectrum, which cannot be overprovisioned, while on the other hand, 
the radio signal propagation is a very node-specific property, being difficult to con-
trol, which has a significant impact on most VNets. Slicing consists of allocating 
a coherent subset of physical resources to a specific VNet. The slicing process in 
wireless networks has also some specific issues derived from the characteristics of 
the medium; the provisioning of slices to multiple VNets with different radio links 
requires the capability to share radio resources, while at the same time avoiding 
interference among the different VNets [7].
Sharing radio resources on multiple access schemes has been intensively inves-
tigated for wireless systems concerning the separation of the radio links for differ-
ent end-users of the same system. Still, with the introduction of Mobile Virtual 
Network Operators (MVNOs), radio resource sharing investigation has been con-
fined to the same system. In the context of network virtualization, the target is to 
manage radio resources sharing for the VNet’s aggregated link, abstracting the 
involved wireless systems. Therefore, this approach must be extended to the separa-
tion of different VNets.
To overcome the scarcity of the radio spectrum, several cognitive radio tech-
niques have also been proposed recently in literature, for example, the smart cogni-
tive radio in [8], which can be explored as additional measures to be integrated in 
wireless access virtualization context.

Management of Resources in Virtual Radio Networks ◾ 375
The presented approach for wireless access virtualization considers a broader 
perspective of virtual resources as an aggregated connectivity resource abstracted 
from a group of radio resources of different technologies, overcoming the limited 
bandwidth availability of wireless technologies by managing the radio resources 
across the diverse technologies. Instead of looking at the wireless virtualization 
from the perspective of the instantiation of virtual machines in the wireless nodes, 
our view is the virtualization of the wireless access to provide a required capacity 
to the virtual resource in order to serve its end-users. This approach is then agnos-
tic to the point where the virtual node instantiation takes place, being possible to 
have the virtual nodes in each physical wireless node, or somewhere in the cloud, 
requesting virtual access over a given geographic area covered by a set of wire-
less nodes. It is worthwhile noting that this capacity can be modified on demand 
without manually changing the configuration of the network. The main target is 
the management of the radio resources sharing to provide the contracted amount 
of capacity to a VNet of a given type. Aspects like quality of service (QoS) and 
fairness are taken into account only at the VNet level, being delegated to physical 
(PHY)/medium access control (MAC) schedulers who are related to end-users.
The generalization of the problem as a cooperative radio resources management 
(CoRRM) problem with an additional level of abstraction, the virtual RRM level, 
allows following an approach of integration of the several levels of RRM, which 
needs to be adapted, but that actively participates in the process to achieve the 
main target of provision of the contracted level of service for all MVNOs operating 
over the common infrastructure. Naturally, the added virtual RRM level needs 
to assume the coordination role of all the underlying RRM levels, as it is aware of 
VNets requirements and has the responsibility to satisfy them. Still, the specific 
algorithms to implement the needed functionality at underlying RRM levels can 
evolve without overthrowing the outlined approach.
The next sections are organized as follows. In the Sections 11.1.2 and 11.1.3, 
a brief overview of the relevant aspects of RRM and CoRRM is provided, and 
radio resource sharing and wireless-virtualization-related work is presented and 
discussed. In Section 11.2, the network architecture, the model description, the 
strategies and algorithms for VNet radio resource allocation are presented, and the 
metrics for evaluation are defined. The analysis of the most relevant results is pro-
vided in Section 11.3; finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 11.4.
11.1.2 RRM and Cooperative RRM
One of the objectives of a network operator is to deploy a network that is able to 
support its customers with the required QoS. Focusing on the radio component, 
the output of radio network planning should be the provision of radio resource 
units (RUs) along the service area, by means of a certain radio network topology 
and a given configuration of the cell sites [9]. However, the amount of RUs to 

376 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
be provisioned varies with service penetration and usage profile, which change 
in time and space. The most basic way to overcome these issues is by means of 
network over dimensioning, and RUs overprovision, in order to guarantee QoS to 
end-users, but, radio resources are limited, and this is not a cost-efficient alterna-
tive. The challenge is to be able to provide the desired QoS level with minimum 
resources, therefore, minimizing operator’s investment while meeting network 
design requirements.
Wireless communications are dynamic in nature due to several varying condi-
tions, including propagation, traffic generation, and interference, among others. 
Hence, the management of the provisioned RUs should be also dynamic, in order 
to maintain end-users’ QoS. RRM allocates and manages the RUs provided by the 
radio network.
RRM functions are responsible for taking decisions regarding the setting of 
different parameters influencing air-interface behavior. The overall behavior of the 
air interface at any given time results from the decisions taken by different RRM 
functions. However, consistency needs to be ensured among the different actions 
that will be undertaken by the different functions and mechanisms to solve con-
flicts deriving from contradictory actions/reactions. The correct design of RRM 
functions considers that some functionalities rely on actions/reactions of other 
functionalities to achieve a global performance.
RRM functions gather information and measurements related to the general 
radio environment and QoS. This can include signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), through-
put, delay of radio bearers, handover, and admission statistics, and technology- 
dependent values, such as, channel allocation, orthogonal coding, and intra- and 
inter-cell interference values. Different RRM functions target different radio 
interface elements and effects, hence, they can be classified according to the time 
scales they use to be activated and executed. A set of RRM functions with the 
corresponding typical time scales between consecutive activations of the different 
 algorithms are: 
 
◾Inner-loop power control, for example, 1 slot (less than 1 ms) in CDMA
 
◾Packet scheduling and MAC algorithms, in around 1 frame
 
◾Admission control, handover, congestion control, outer-loop power control in 
CDMA transmission, and from tens to thousands of frames
The most relevant RRM functions in the context of wireless access virtualization 
are handover, admission control, and scheduling algorithms.
Nowadays, mobile communications networks are composed of various 
types of radio access technologies (RATs) that constitute a global heteroge-
neous wireless network. New RATs may appear in future generation mobile 
communications, namely 5G, enforcing the need for cooperation among them, 
in order to provide users the best connectivity anytime and anywhere. The 
heterogeneous wireless networks concept is intended to propose a flexible and 

Management of Resources in Virtual Radio Networks ◾ 377
open architecture for a large variety of different wireless access technologies, for 
applications and services with different QoS demands, and different protocols. 
The main goal is to make the heterogeneous network transparent to users, a 
secondary one being to design an architecture that is independent of the wire-
less access technology.
In order to accomplish these objectives, and to optimize the global radio 
resources utilization, cooperation among the specific RRMs of each air-interface 
technology is needed. The complementary characteristics of the different RATs 
allow achieving a more efficient use of the overall resources with CoRRM, rather 
than with the usage of the various RRMs independently, the so-called trunking 
gain. CoRRM must take into consideration the overall resources in all available 
RATs, and dynamically select the best RAT, to guarantee, at each moment, the most 
efficient use of the available radio resources. A vertical handover procedure must 
be considered to enable a number of necessary features: avoiding disconnections due 
to lack of coverage in the current RAT, avoiding blocking due to overload in the 
current RAT, improvement of QoS by changing RAT, and supporting user’s and 
operator’s preferences in terms of usage or load balance among RATs. Inter-RRM 
signaling among RATs should also be required, in order to transfer information 
among RRM entities upon which resource allocation and admission control deci-
sions can be taken.
A number of architectures and algorithms to implement CoRRM have been 
studied and proposed in the past few years: A Common RRM (CRRM) approach 
was proposed by 3GPP to enable the cooperation in between UMTS and GSM 
[9]; joint RRM (JRRM) was introduced by the European IST-SCOUT project for 
inter-working between high performance local area network (HIPERLAN/2) and 
UMTS [10]; a multilayered RRM scheme was introduced by the European IST-
MIND project [11] for the cooperation among various RATs [12]; the European 
IST ambient networks (AN) project [13] defined the multiradio access (MRA) 
architecture; although not being a strict CoRRM architecture, the 3GPP system 
architecture evolution (SAE) integrates different access technologies into a com-
mon packet core network, allowing for inter-system handover [14]; more recently, 
the European IST mobile cloud networking (MCN) project exploited cloud com-
puting as infrastructure for future mobile network deployment and operation. The 
proposed architecture allows the integrated operation of several radio access tech-
nologies, mobile core networks, as well as data centers [15].
11.1.3 Radio Resource Sharing and Wireless Virtualization
In the current mobile communications marketplace, functionalities that enable 
various forms of network sharing are becoming more and more important. Wireless 
network sharing is a way for operators to share the heavy deployment costs for 
mobile networks, not only during the launching phase, but also during the opera-
tion phase, through the optimization of resources utilization.

378 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Sharing is an important topic for Long-Term Evolution (LTE), standards on 
network sharing being already in place [16]. Two architectures have been identi-
fied to be supported: gateway core network and multioperator core network. In 
the former, besides sharing the radio access network nodes, core network operators 
also share the core network nodes, while in the latter, multiple core network nodes 
operated by different operators are connected to the same radio access network 
nodes. In both architectures, the radio access network is shared; still the standard 
does not specify how capacity is shared among the several core network opera-
tors competing for radio access. Besides national roaming, in which a standard 
roaming agreement is established among operators, or the passive sharing, where 
only sites are shared, an active sharing is needed to support those network sharing 
architectures. In active sharing, the radio access network is common to several 
MVNOs, and these networks are shared among them. One proposal for radio 
access network sharing is made in [17], taking spectrum usage, QoS, and capacity 
sharing into account, among other aspects. Although it is a wide-range and very 
interesting approach for radio access network sharing, the main drawbacks are the 
direct mapping of the amount of radio resources reservation for capacity provision 
and the static way of configuration, at the eNodeB level, of the several strategies 
proposed for capacity sharing.
In the previous presented cases, operators are forced to use similar network 
functions, as defined by 3G specifications, hence, the possibility of having dif-
ferent multiple VNets with their own functions and communication protocols, 
isolated from each other, cannot be achieved. Still, without having an integrated 
perspective relative to multiple RATs, the abstraction of the wireless access is only 
partially made, avoiding one to take advantage of all available wireless infrastruc-
tures. Furthermore, the several models proposed for radio resources sharing are not 
based on capacity demand, the allocation of radio resources being more or less fixed 
and not dynamically adapted to the network state, in order to satisfy the requested 
capacity. This may lead to situations in which the VNets (or rather the logical net-
works, as the notion of VNet is not present) are running out of contract, denying 
service to their end-users even when some radio resources are available.
Wireless virtualization can introduce some additional promising aspects rela-
tive to wireless network sharing; in fact, besides the sharing of physical resources, 
network virtualization main targets are the possibility of running simultaneously 
different network protocols over multiple VNets, which are isolated from each 
other and with independent management functions. In this way, by setting the 
VNet type of service with adequate requirements, for example, minimum data 
rate and/or maximum delay, the VNets may satisfy their end-users’ QoS. It should 
be noted that the amount of radio resources is fixed and capacity is not directly 
increased through network virtualization. However, by sharing the radio resources 
network, providers can optimize their utilization, and by managing their allocation 
to different virtual, operators can provide the requested capacity and QoS at each 
moment.

Management of Resources in Virtual Radio Networks ◾ 379
Wireless virtualization for specific wireless and mobile networks has been more 
recently addressed in literature, being an important topic nowadays for 5G as it is 
demonstrated by the presented virtualization strategies of radio access network [18], 
in addition to advanced computational platforms, such as cloud computing.
A framework for the efficient radio resources sharing without interference 
among different virtual radio networks is presented in [7]. In this work, a multiple 
access scheme to allocate radio resources to each VNet is proposed, establishing a 
virtual radio resource for each particular VNet. Within each VNet, a further mul-
tiple access scheme is then applied to distribute the resources of the VNet to the 
different end-users of that VNet.
In [19], the authors chose LTE as a case study to extend network virtualiza-
tion into the wireless component. Their proposal is to add a hypervisor to the LTE 
eNodeB, in order to map the scheduling of physical resources onto virtual ones. 
Each operator expresses its contract in terms of the number of radio resources, in 
this case the physical resource blocks (PRBs), and is responsible for the estimation 
of the amount of these blocks needed for a time interval.
WiMAX [20] addresses the challenges of resources virtualization by propos-
ing an architecture that enables shared use by multiple independent slice users, for 
example, MVNOs, each with possibly distinct flow types and network layer proto-
cols. The design and implementation of a network virtualization substrate (NVS) 
for effective virtualization of wireless resources in cellular networks are presented 
in [21]. NVS introduces a slice scheduler that allows the existence of slices with 
bandwidth-based and resource-based reservations, simultaneously; it also includes 
a generic framework for efficiently enabling customized flow scheduling within the 
base station (BS) on a per-slice basis.
Concerning wireless local area networks (WLANs), the SplitAP architecture 
is proposed in [22]. The problem of sharing uplink airtime across groups of users 
is addressed by extending the idea of network virtualization, allowing the deploy-
ment of different algorithms for enforcing uplink airtime fairness across different 
client groups. A different approach to support full WLAN functionalities inside 
virtual machines is described in [23], named virtual WiFi. Each virtual machine 
establishes its own connection with self-supplied credentials, and multiple sepa-
rate WLAN connections are supported through one physical WLAN network 
interface.
The majority of these approaches mainly address wireless resources virtualiza-
tion, which is not the focus here, and only some of them tackle the management 
of radio resources to be shared among the several virtual resources. However, in 
these approaches, the assignment of radio resources to VNet end-users is handled 
within one physical resource in which the virtual resources are instantiated. Still, 
besides NVS, they do not address the allocation of radio resources based on the 
capacity required to the virtual resources, but based on a required amount of radio 
resources, which may perform differently according to the wireless medium condi-
tions, possibly not providing the requested capacity.

380 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Rather, the approach presented in what follows is based on an algorithm that 
manages the allocation of capacity to the virtual resources, adapting the allocation 
of radio resources to the wireless medium conditions, that is, the amount of radio 
resources allocated to the virtual resource is not an issue, as the amount of con-
tracted capacity is provided to the virtual resource. Furthermore, instead of consid-
ering the sharing of radio resources within one physical resource, a set of physical 
resources from several RATs should be considered, independently abstracted by 
their RUs, for example, resource blocks in LTE, codes in UMTS, or time-slots 
in GSM, to the point where the virtual resources are instantiated [24]. In fact, as 
mentioned earlier, besides resource virtualization, a main issue in wireless virtu-
alization is slicing, that is, how to share the available wireless resources to extend 
VNets to the wireless access, maintaining isolation and allowing the use of differ-
ent communication protocols per VNet. This leads to the question: Where should 
the boundary for the instantiation of virtual nodes in the wireless access be? One 
can think about several alternatives for the instantiation of a virtual node: in each 
wireless node, in one node within a set of wireless nodes serving the same area, 
or even in a core node the wireless component being totally abstracted. However, 
independently of the place where the virtual node is instantiated, the key problem 
is how to manage the allocation of radio resources to the virtual resources in order 
to satisfy the amount of contracted capacity.
11.2  Models and Algorithms for Wireless 
Access Virtualization
11.2.1 Network Architecture
In a traditional business model, the end-user has a business relationship with a net-
work operator and can only connect to the network via its infrastructure, if roam-
ing is not considered. The network operator can be the owner of the infrastructure 
or also the physical network operator, providing added-value services to end-users.
MVNOs have appeared in the mobile telecommunications market many years 
ago, using a given infrastructure to provide specific services to their clients. In this 
case, end-users have a contract with the MVNO, which in turn has a contractual 
relationship with a network operator. Hence, MVNO clients can connect only via 
the infrastructure of the network operator with whom they have a contract.
With the introduction of network virtualization, new business roles are fore-
seen. In particular, the roles of the traditional network operator have been split 
into the virtual network operator, the MVNO within this context, which will most 
probably use several infrastructures, and the infrastructure providers (InP), which 
in turn will be shared by various MVNOs. In this case, MVNO clients may con-
nect via the infrastructure of any InP providing network resources for the VNet in 
the area where they are located.

Management of Resources in Virtual Radio Networks ◾ 381
The network architecture, Figure 11.1, refers to the virtualization of the wireless 
access as an integral part of VNets, being based on a generic network virtualiza-
tion environment, for example, [3]. Hence, the considered network environment 
envisages the existence of multiple VNets created by a VNet enabler. Service pro-
viders, which can also accumulate the MVNO role, will use these VNets, formed 
on demand to satisfy their service requirements, in order to deliver services to their 
customers. In this way, the physical infrastructure owned by InPs is shared among 
several VNets, providing services with different requirements, and to multiple ser-
vice providers. 
The physical network architecture is depicted in Figure 11.1a. The following 
elements are represented:
 
◾Service provider: Entity that provides/delivers services/applications over the 
(virtual) network for a set of clients.
 
◾VNet enabler: Entity enabling network virtualization. Several functions are 
under the responsibility of this entity, for example, receiving and processing 
the requirements for virtualization, negotiation with InPs to use their physi-
cal resources for the provision of capacity, and VNets’ creation. Although the 
operation and maintenance of VNets can be performed by an external entity, 
it is considered within this block for simplicity. Virtual resource allocation, 
besides other type of resource allocation (e.g., computational resources), 
includes the algorithm that manages the allocation of radio resources from 
the physical networks to the virtual resources created by the virtualization 
process. As one is considering different wireless access technologies, with dif-
ferent physical meanings for the RUs, a level of abstraction is added, enabling 
a common approach to manage all radio resources. It is considered that each 
wireless link is generically composed of RUs, which varies in number and 
capacity according to the wireless technology involved.

382 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
 
◾Physical network (PhyNet): Set of physical resources from each RAT, for 
example, the BSs or other nodes of the wireless system architecture, owned by 
InPs. The physical resources should allow instantiation of virtual resources, 
that is, should be capable of sharing their physical components. RRM is the 
set of specific mechanisms of each physical network performing the well-
known radio-management functionalities, for example, admission control, 
scheduling, radio resource allocation, and handover, among others.
For simplicity, service providers’ requests are illustrated as being only a capacity 
demand, although their requirements are not limited to it, for example, it can be also 
delay or reliability. Based on the request for capacity and infrastructure availability, 
the VNet enabler defines a VNet adequate for that service delivery, performing the 
virtual resource allocation. Virtual resources composing the VNet are then created on 
top of the network infrastructure, by sharing the available physical network capacity.
Within this scope, only the virtual resources deployed over wireless infrastructures 
are considered, from now on designated as virtual base stations (VBSs). It is worth-
while to note that though the instantiation of a VBS involves the virtualization of 
processing and memory resources, in order to run the inherent functions of a physical 
BS, within the scope of this work one considers only the radio part of the VBS, that is, 
the set of radio resources allocated to the VBSs. In this sense, VBSs are assumed to be 
implemented on top of a group of BSs from heterogeneous wireless networks, serving a 
given geographic area over which the capacity demand is requested. This group of BSs 
serving a delimited geographical area is designated as a cluster. The requested capacity 
may be split over one or several VBSs by the virtual resource allocation function. In 
case several VBSs coexist, a partial capacity requirement is established for each one.
VBSs’ capacity is provided by the allocation of RUs over the several BSs deployed 
in the cluster, being coordinated across the cluster to satisfy the VBSs’ contracted 
capacity. Although the number of RUs per BS can be different for BSs of the same 
RAT, in the scenario under evaluation it was assumed that all the BSs of the same RAT 
have the same number of RUs, for the sake of simplicity. The RU is the minimum 
radio resource unit that can be assigned to an end-user in a physical BS, hence, 
depending on the RAT, for example, a time-slot in TDMA (time division multiple 
access), a code in CDMA (code division multiple access), or a resource block (group 
of sub-carriers) in OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access). The 
RU is then abstracted by its capabilities, namely, the achievable data rates according 
to the modulation and coding schemes allowed in each RAT.
Figure 11.1b depicts the VNet operators’ view of the network, the logical view. 
The following elements are considered: 
 ◾Virtual base station (VBS ): Virtual resources created to provide the capacity 
required by a service provider over a given geographical area. VBSs capacity is 
collected from the available radio resources of all BSs in that area. The VBS can 
implement the functionality of a physical BS being part of one virtual network.

Management of Resources in Virtual Radio Networks ◾ 383
 ◾Virtual resource management: Process that manages the utilization of VBS’s 
capacity, enabling to perform resource management functions, for example, to 
adapt the capacity required to the VBSs utilization or to an increase of clients in 
the area. Scheduling end-users within the VBS is also one of its responsibilities.
 
◾Virtual networks (VNets): Entity characterized by the type of contract, the 
amount of required capacity and other kind of requirements, like location 
and topology, among others. They are composed of several virtual resources, 
which are the VBSs in the scope of this work, that is, virtual resources shar-
ing wireless physical infrastructures.
MVNOs are the players that manage and operate VNets, including their VBSs, 
to satisfy service providers’ requests. They know only the virtual resources that are 
part of the VNet with their associated capacity, the set of physical resources being 
hidden from them.
In order to make use of a service, the end-user connects physically to the BSs, 
Figure 11.1a, but the connection to the VNet providing the service is logically made 
via a VBS, through a virtual link, as illustrated in Figure 11.1b. The physical link is 
the group of RUs allocated to the end-user, whereas the virtual link is the capacity, 
in bit/s, allocated by the VBS. The mapping between the physical and virtual links is 
essential to compute the VBS-aggregated capacity, allowing monitoring of the con-
tract satisfaction, and, consequently, the trustiness between the MVNO and InPs.
Several types of VNets may be considered to represent different service level 
agreements for the VNets. However, for the sake of proof of concept only two types 
of VNets are considered: GRT (guaranteed) and BE (best effort) VNets. The for-
mer ensures that the requested constraints, capacity in this case, will not be violated 
at any time. The latter provides a best-effort service, that is, no guarantees at all are 
given when data will be delivered.
11.2.2 Model Description
An analytical model is presented next, to obtain VNet’s capacity for the network 
architecture. From the physical viewpoint, a cluster with a set of BSs from various 
RATs is considered as the small management unit in terms of virtual radio resource 
allocation (VRRA):

The BS characterization is made from the viewpoint of the RAT it belongs to 
and  the relation to the end-users connected through it. Concerning the RAT, 
besides the number of RUs specific of that RAT, the BS is characterized by its 
maximum capacity or Maximum BS Data Rate, that is, the total capacity (bit/s) 
provided by the RUs of any given BS, from now on designated as data rate, when 
the most favorable modulation and coding scheme is applied. Hence, the Maximum

It is assumed that the distribution of end-users among BSs is uniform. The 
cluster, being a group of BSs, can inherit the BS characterization, that is, it 
can be described by its maximum capacity and serving data rate. Hence, two 
other parameters have been defined: Maximum Cluster Data Rate and Cluster 
Serving Data Rate. The Maximum Cluster Data Rate is the maximum capacity 
of the cluster, that is, the sum of the Maximum BS Data Rate of all the BSs of 
that cluster:

The main target of VRRA is to provide the required capacity to VBSs, opti-
mizing radio resources utilization. The OnDemandVRRA algorithm presented 
here is a heuristic one, which manages the allocation of RUs among VBSs 
only when they are requested by VNet end-users. The management of radio 
resources allocation from VBSs is coordinated, to provide different levels of 
service to the various MVNOs or service providers. This is achieved by taking 
the variability of the wireless medium and the diversity of the existing RATs 
into account.
It is important to ensure consistency among the decisions taken at the dif-
ferent levels of RRM, namely, intra-RAT (RRM), inter-RAT (CoRRM), and 
among VNets, to achieve an overall coherent behavior. Given that at the VNet 
level one should have the perspective of the several RATs, the OnDemandVRRA 
algorithm takes decisions at a time scale that is defined for CoRRM. This time 
scale is taken as the major common denominator of all RATs, for the sake of 
simplicity.
The OnDemandVRRA is responsible for dynamically (re)allocating RUs, 
satisfying the Minimum Contracted Data Rate for GRT VNets Equation 11.17, 
and aiming at the Reference Contracted Data Rate for BE VNets Equation 11.18:

One should note that if a GRT VBS is not using all the contracted capacity, its 
end-users must be served with the capacity they are requesting, that is, if a given 
GRT VBS serving data rate is below the contracted capacity, the RUs allocated to its 
end-users must correspond to the data rate requested by them.
The optimization of radio resources utilization is indirectly achieved by allow-
ing the allocation of RUs to any VBS, after all other VBSs in the cluster have their 
contracted capacity satisfied. This means that all available RUs in the cluster are 
allocated to any VBS as long as they have been requested, avoiding the waste of 
radio resources, for example, due to a previous allocation to VBSs that did not use 
them. In fact, one is not directly dealing with the scheduling of the radio resources 
to the end-users, but rather indirectly, by enforcing the decisions taken from the 
cluster viewpoint to be considered by RRM and CoRRM algorithms.
To cope with these objectives, the OnDemandVRRA algorithm is supported 
by a VNet priority scheme and a data-rate reduction strategy, besides the access 
selection mechanism.
Concerning access selection, end-users are connected to the different VBSs accord-
ing to the requested service and their contract with the MVNO(s). The physical con-
nection is established through one of the BSs of existing RATs in the coverage area, 
based on a list of preferences related to the requested service, the available capacity, and 
the strategy defined for resource evaluation. This strategy, for example, minimum load, 
minimum cost, and/or minimum energy state, is based on the BS cost, where several 
key performance indicators are weighted.
The VNet priority scheme running at cluster level assumes a coordination role 
and enables to set differentiated end-users according to the type of VBS and the 
VBS Serving Data Rate. VBSs are initialized to be handled with priority, all BSs 
in the cluster being informed of this, to activate the data-rate reduction process. 
When the Minimum Contracted Data Rate is reached, that is, the VBS Serving Data 
Rate≥VBS Contracted Data Rate, the priority to be given to end-users who wish to 
connect to this VBS is deactivated. This priority scheme based on the VBS Serving 
Data Rate, allows one to implement a data-rate reduction strategy whenever the 
GRT VBSs have priority, preventing starvation on BE VBSs when the contracted 
data rate in GRT VBSs is reached.
The data-rate reduction strategy is essential to compensate possible end-user 
data-rate decrease due to degradation of wireless medium conditions. It is applied 

Management of Resources in Virtual Radio Networks ◾ 389
to services with a minimum required data rate, for example, video streaming, while 
the VBS operates within the contracted capacity, that is, when the VBS priority 
is activated. Although another data-rate reduction strategy could be applied, the 
adopted data-rate reduction strategy is as follows. Whenever the VBS priority is 
activated for a GRT VBS, and the end-user tries to connect to a BS in which 
there are not enough RUs for his/her service, BE end-users connected to the BS are 
reduced according to: 
 
◾The out-of-contract rate of the VBS they are connected to, in order to mini-
mize penalties, introducing some degree of fairness among BE VBSs
 
◾The QoS priority class of the performed service [25]; end-users performing 
services with lower priority being the first to be reduced
 
◾Their SINR, end-users with lower SINR being reduced first to allow optimiz-
ing radio resource utilization
Still, if there are not enough RUs to reach the requested data rate, the evaluation 
of colocated BSs is performed, in order to select the one with enough RUs available 
and with the minimum cost to handover end-users.
A brief description of the end-users handling process is presented next. After the 
access is selected, the assignment of RUs to end-users is constrained by the level of 
contract fulfillment of all the VBSs in the cluster, which determine the RUs avail-
ability. The state of operation of the VBS in relation to the contracted, that is, the 
priority of the VBS, is then checked to allow serving end-users of VBSs operating 
within contract. If it is the case, that is, the VBS has priority, the data-rate reduc-
tion process is evoked in order to find enough RUs to assign to the end-user without 
violating the established contracts with other VBSs.
It is worthwhile to note the difference between OnDemandVRRA and the 
radio resource allocation and adaptation mechanisms at the PHY/MAC level, 
which deal with end-user performance instead of the VBS one. OnDemandVRRA 
acts mainly as a coordinator that enforces its VRRA decisions onto RRM func-
tions, namely, scheduling and admission control, for the wireless systems within 
the cluster. However, these RRM functions should be adapted to receive these set-
tings and extended to deal with it, for example, through the set of functions pro-
posed for OnDemand end-users’ handling.
11.2.4 Metrics for Evaluation
The metrics used for assessment are defined as follows.
The Average Serving Data Rate allows evaluating the algorithm ability to allocate 
the adequate quantity of RUs to the VBS, in order to satisfy the VBS-contracted 
data rate. It is the average of VBS Serving Data Rate over the total number of time 
frames in the observation time interval:

The Average Cluster Data Rate is a metric to evaluate the performance of the 
overall cluster, allowing one to observe the impact of using VRRA algorithms for 
different use cases. It is defined as the average of the Cluster Serving Data Rate over 
the total number of time frames in the observation time interval:

The Average Cluster Utilization is a measure of the RUs utilization within the 
cluster. This metric should be analyzed together with the Average Cluster Data Rate, 
as the efficiency of the use of the RUs is as important as maximizing their use. It 
is defined as the average of the Cluster Utilization over the total number of time

It should be highlighted that the metrics defined for evaluation are not directly 
related to fairness, as it is considered that this is under the responsibility of the 
MVNOs, while the network operators of each VNet provide fairness among end-
users within the same VNet. On the other hand, giving the same priority to VNets 
of the same type, and operating in a similar state relative to the contracted capacity, 
implies MAC schedulers to evenly handle end-users of different VNets, given that 
they are in the same priority level, allowing to provide fairness among VNets.
11.3 Analysis of Results
In order to analyze the proposed VRRA algorithm from different perspectives, 
the assessment was done by starting from a reference scenario over which several 
changes were applied, by varying a set of relevant parameters. The reference physi-
cal cluster is composed of 2 TDMA, 1 CDMA, 4 OFDMA, and 8 OFDM BSs, 
Figure 11.2. Two MVNOs are considered, each one providing a different set of 
services, one is GRT with a minimum guaranteed data rate and another BE with 
a reference data rate. The total data rate contracted for both VNets is on the aver-
age cluster capacity. It is considered that 8,000 end-users are uniformly distrib-
uted within the cluster, allowing to depict a situation in which the total data rate 
requested by end-users is above the maximum cluster data rate. Concerning the ser-
vice profile, it is assumed that 4% of end-users use VoIP, 35% video, 3% file sharing, 
and 58% Web derived from the service penetration of mobile data traffic forecast 
for 2016 made by Cisco [26]. VoIP corresponds to traffic from retail VoIP services 
and PC-based VoIP, while for video streaming is considered, Web depicts Web 
traffic (excluding file sharing), and file sharing corresponds to peer-to-peer traffic.

392 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
The signal quality of the end-users is changing over time; the modulation and 
coding scheme (MCS) is being adapted to this variation.
The strategy used for resource evaluation to select the best BS to connect the 
end-user is the maximum absolute capacity available. Although the number of RUs 
per BS can be different for BSs of the same RAT, being an input of our model, in 
the scenario under evaluation, it was assumed that all the BSs of the same RAT 
have the same amount of RUs for the sake of simplicity. The time frame common 
to all RATs is taken as 1 s.
In the following, the most relevant results from a set of use cases defined to 
analyze different perspectives are presented and discussed. Although the results 
for each use case are not exhaustively presented, further results and analysis can be 
found in [27].
11.3.1 Non-Virtual versus Virtual Network Operators Model
Two scenarios have been defined to study the benefits that can be achieved with 
the introduction of virtualization in wireless heterogeneous networks: Standard 
(without virtualization) and Virtual (with virtualization). These two scenarios 
allow comparing current operators versus virtual network operators model.
In the Standard scenario, two network providers are considered, one hav-
ing a contract with 80% of the end-users and the other with 20%. Concerning 
the Virtual scenario, two different use cases were defined, VNet-Limited and 
VNet-UnLimited, both having one BE VBS and one GRT VBS. For the VNet-
UnLimited use case, the BE VBS has a low-reference data rate, meaning that it 
does not impose any additional constraint to the GRT VBS, because the refer-
ence data rate is always served. For the VNet-Limited one, the reference data rate 
is defined according to the expected BE VBS request data rate, being a GRT 
VBS restriction, as most of the time it cannot be reached due to the maximum 
data rate of the cluster. For the rest of the parameters, the related reference sce-
nario is used.
Observing the results for the Average Cluster Data Rate, Rserv
Cl , obtained from 
Equation 11.23, and depicted in Figure 11.3a, one can see that for the VNet-
Limited use case the cluster achieves the highest value, Rserv
Cl
Gbit/s
≈2 6.
 . On the 
other hand, the highest Average Cluster Utilization, ηCl, computed from Equation 
11.24, is achieved for VNet-UnLimited, which denotes a less efficient use of the 
overall resources than in VNet-Limited, as the Rserv
Cl  for the former is less than 
the one for the latter, Figure 11.3b. In fact, there are more end-users from GRT 
VBS entering the network and the RUs may be assigned to end-users in poor 
wireless performance conditions, because for GRT services, a minimum service 
data rate should be satisfied. For the Standard scenario, the lowest value of ηCl is 
observed, as there is an additional limitation arising from the NetProv’s physical 
infrastructure partition, avoiding to share the overall RUs within the cluster.

Management of Resources in Virtual Radio Networks ◾ 393
By comparing the wireless access virtualization supported by the proposed 
OnDemandVRRA with the standard approach, in which there are multiple 
network operators (each owning part of the physical infrastructure), it can be 
said that the former allows achieving a better performance of a cluster of BSs 
from different RATs, enabling the provision of contracted capacity for GRT 
VNets. It is demonstrated by simulation that, in Virtual use cases, the Average 
Cluster Serving Data Rate may increase by approximately 46% and the utiliza-
tion by 13%. On the other hand, for Virtual use cases, the Average VBS Serving 
Data Rate of GRT VBSs is always greater than the contracted minimum, being 
constrained by the BE VBSs reference data rate, which tends to be followed. 
For the Standard scenario, the values achieved for Average VBS Serving Data 
Rate are the lowest for BE services, but can be greater than in Virtual use cases 
for GRT services. On one hand, this denotes the limitation due to the split 
of the total cluster capacity by the two operators, and on the other hand, it 
denotes the uncoordinated allocation of radio resources as end-users are inde-
pendently handled.
11.3.2  Physical versus Virtual Capacities
Situations in which the total amount of capacity contracted by VNOs, under- and 
overbooked, are discussed herein. It is considered that an underbooking situation, 
Under use case, occurs when the amount of contracted data rate by all the VBSs 
instantiated in the cluster is less than the average cluster capacity, that is, the data 
rate the cluster can provide when the modulation and coding schemes applied to all 
the RUs within the cluster is between the second and third higher data rates. Two 
overbooking situations were considered, GRTOver and BEOver use cases, in which 
the total contracted data rate is greater than the average cluster capacity. Finally, an 
Average use case is considered to depict the situation when the contracted capacity is 
near the average cluster capacity.

394 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
For all use cases, the reference scenario is considered, the quantity of end-users 
increasing from 1,000 to 15,000 to allow simulating situations in which the total 
data rate requested is below and above the maximum cluster data rate.
When the total capacity is on the average capacity of the cluster, the Average use 
case, both VBSs can achieve the contracted data rate since the GRT VBS is limited, 
Figure 11.4. However, when the GRT VBS requested data rate is near the con-
tracted one, the data rate of BE end-users is reduced to allow the GRT VBS to reach 
the contracted data rate and the BE VBS becomes out of contract. It is worth to 
note that the average data rate per GRT end-user is almost constant, independently 
of number of end-users in the cluster, because the number of end-users admitted to 
the GRT VBS is limited by the contracted data rate of both VBSs. 
For overbooking situations, GRTOver and BEOver, the results obtained for the 
average capacity of the cluster are extremely different depending on the type of 
VBS that is contracting more capacity.
For the GRT VBS, GRTOver use case, the behavior is to some extent similar to 
Under, as the number of GRT end-users is also high, though for diverse reasons. In 
this case, the priority given to GRT end-users, while the VBS Serving Data Rate is 
lower than the contracted capacity, is high, forcing the data rate reduction of BE end-
users, to satisfy the contracted data rate. Concerning the Average Cluster Data Rate, 
and Average Cluster Utilization, it can be observed that, like in Under, there is an inef-
ficiency in the use of RUs in this case, related to the value for contracted capacity of 
the GRT VBS, which is about 85% of the average cluster capacity, leading most of the 
connected end-users to be in GRT VBS. Also because of that, the contracted data rate 
of a BE VBS has only influence for situations in which both VBSs are heavy loaded 
and the GRT VBS is already operating on extra capacity requested, removing the 
priority of GRT end-users. In the analyzed case, due to overbooking, the cluster can 
never provide the BE VBS contracted capacity and the VBS operates out of contract 
as soon as the requested data rate is greater than the contracted.

While the BE VBS, BEOver, requested data rate is less than the contracted data 
rate, the GRT VBS achieves Serving VBS Data Rate above the minimum contracted 
capacity, which is forced to be the contracted data rate as soon as the BE VBS 
requested data rate becomes above its contracted data rate. The BE VBS though 
does not reach the contracted data rate due to cluster capacity limit is increasingly 
tending to it. The best RU efficiency for high values of cluster requested data rate is 
achieved in this use case, that is, the ratio of Average Cluster Data Rate, and Average 
Cluster Utilization, is greater than for the other use cases. Although the average data 
rate per GRT end-user is almost constant, a decrease of about 17% is observed when 
the GRT VBS Serving Data Rate is above the VBS contracted data rate and the BE 
VBS requested data rate is less than the contracted VBS, because the data rate reduc-
tion process is deactivated.
11.3.3  Diverse Combinations of VBSs from Different Types
The main target here is to analyze several combinations of different VNet types 
created in the physical cluster. The total number of VBSs in the cluster was set to 
four, the three use cases considered being characterized by the number of VNets of 
each type: 1GRT_3BE, 2GRT_2BE, and 3GRT_1BE.
The total data rate contracted by each type of VBSs is maintained for all use 
cases, that is, the total data rate contracted for GRT VBSs has always the same 
percentage relative to the total data rate contracted within the physical cluster. 
The Average use case was selected, representing one of the most favorable use cases 
for the total data rate contracted within the average cluster serving one. All the 
VBSs of the GRT type provide both VoIP and video services, FS, and Web services 
being provided by BE VBSs.
For all use cases, the reference scenario is considered. This allows depicting the 
situation in which the total data rate requested, approximately 5.5 Gbit/s on aver-
age, is above the average cluster data rate.
From the results obtained by changing the VBSs’ type mixing, one can conclude 
the following. The total Average VBS Serving Data Rate of GRT VBSs is basically 
the same for all use cases and the individual VBS achieved value is always above the 
Minimum Contracted Data Rate, independent of the use case, Figure 11.5. It is 
verified that the total Average VBS Serving Data Rate of GRT VBSs has a maximum 
deviation among use cases around 0.2%, increasing slightly with the number of 
GRT VBSs. To achieve this, the OnDemandVRRA algorithm manages the alloca-
tion of RUs, causing the reduction of BE end-users and preventing the BE VBSs to 
get their Reference Contracted Data Rate. The total Average VBS Serving Data Rate 
of BE VBSs is under the Reference Contracted Data Rate for all use cases, decreas-
ing approximately 1.8% from 1GRT-3BE to 3GRT-1BE. Each GRT Average VBS 
Serving Data Rate is always above the Minimum Contracted Data Rate independent 
of the use case.

396 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Regarding the Average Cluster Serving Data Rate, it is observed that it decreases 
slightly with the number of GRT VBSs, reflecting the analysis done so far for the 
Average VBS Serving Data Rate. In fact, for 1GRT-3BE use case the Average Cluster 
Serving Data Rate achieve the maximum value, Rserv
Cl ≈0 7. %  above to the 3GRT-
1BE. In accordance with this behavior, the Average Cluster Utilization decrease 
with the number of GRT VBSs is not significant.
11.3.4  Variation of the Quantity of VBSs 
Deployed on the Physical Cluster
The main target of the following analysis is to test the algorithm when the number 
of VBS in the cluster increases. The reference scenario is used for all use cases. The 
VBS-contracted data rate is typified according to the typical data rate of the service 
and the selected service profile: Rmin
VBS
Mbit/s
=10
 for VoIP, Rmin
VBS
Mbit/s
= 500
 for 
video, Rref
VBS
Mbit/S
= 500
 for Web, and Rref
VBS
Mbit/s
=100
 for file sharing. Three 
situations were explored: (1) the number of VBSs increases for all services in the 
same way, one VBS per service; (2) the number of GRT VBSs increases by one for 
each GRT service, while the number of BE VBSs maintains with two VBSs for 
each service; (3) the number of GRT VBSs maintains with two VBSs for each ser-
vice, and the number of BE VBSs increases by one for each BE service. Concerning 
the relation between contracted and cluster capacity, use cases have been classified 
as in Table 11.1, allowing the assessment of the conclusions made earlier.
The results for Average Cluster Data Rate and Average Cluster Utilization are 
presented in Figure 11.6, as an example. Observing both metrics simultaneously, 
the best RU efficiency is achieved for 10-BE and 12-BE, which is when the strategy 
for the overall capacity provision is to limit the capacity contracted by GRT VNets, 
overbooking the capacity contracted by BE VNets. The worst RUs efficiency is 
observed for 12-GRT, in which ηCl =1, meaning that all RUs are assigned, and

As a summary, one can say that changing the quantity of created VBSs as well 
as the contracted data rate in the cluster, GRT VBSs continue to achieve their 
minimum contracted data rate, though the Average Cluster Serving Data Rate can 
decrease if the number of GRT VBSs is higher than the number of BE VBSs. It is 
observed that the best RU efficiency is achieved when the strategy for the overall 
capacity provision is to limit the capacity contracted by GRT VNets, overbooking

the capacity contracted by BE VNets. The worst RUs efficiency is observed when 
the number of GRT VBSs is the highest, the GRT overbooking situation being 
considered as the worst case or the limit situation for virtual wireless access imple-
mentation. Furthermore, contracting more data rate for BE VBSs over the same 
physical capacity does not cause the increase of their Average VBS Serving Data 
Rate, as the main target is to guarantee the minimum contracted data rate of GRT 
VBSs, BE VBSs only using the remaining capacity of the cluster.
11.4 Conclusions
The concept of network virtualization has been considered as the basis to address 
the problem of sharing the wireless infrastructure for provision of capacity to 
VNets. Following this approach, it is intended that the basic principles of network 
virtualization, such as the isolation between virtual resources and the possibility 
to deploy different protocols to take the diverse service requirements into account, 
can be applied.
The allocation of transmission resources is a challenging problem in virtualized 
environments, where they are shared among the different virtual resources, and 
there is the need to fulfill contracted capacity requirements. In wireless networks, 
the problem is even more challenging due to the inherently limited resources. In 
fact, the available radio resources are scarce with variable performance, and there is 
a lack of spare spectrum.
A reference network architecture for the virtualization of the wireless access 
based on the generic network virtualization environment is proposed. Both physical 
and virtual perspectives are considered, and the main stakeholders are considered. 
In terms of physical infrastructure, one considers a set of different RATs, which are 
abstracted by the specific RUs of each one. This allows the management of radio 
resources by the coordination of a pool of RUs, each having particular capabilities. 
Concerning the virtual resources, they can be differently defined by setting their 
type, GRT or BE, allowing to differentiate end-users handling, according to the 
VNet they belong to.
A new tier of RRM is proposed for inter–VNet RRM, designated by coopera-
tive VNet RRM, managing how radio resources are allocated to the several VNets 
in order to satisfy the contracted VNets’ capacity. This new level of management 
is proposed to interact with CoRRM and RRM, which is considered to be an 
intra–VNet RRM, thus, under the responsibility of VNOs. Moreover, the general-
ization of the inter–VNet RRM as a CoRRM problem with an additional level of 
abstraction, the virtual RRM level, allows following an approach of integration of 
the several levels of RRM, which needs to be adapted, but that actively participates 
in the process to achieve the main target of provision of the contracted level of 
service for all the VNOs operating on the common infrastructure. Naturally, the 
added virtual RRM level assumes the coordination role of all the underlying ones,

as it is aware of VNets requirements and has the responsibility to satisfy them. Still 
the specific algorithms to implement the needed functionality at underlying RRM 
levels can evolve without overthrowing the outlined approach. The functionalities 
proposed for the initial VNet selection and VNet handover support are essential to 
provide CVRRM with the set of functionalities assigned to CoRRM, thus, allow-
ing it to be considered as a transposition of CoRRM to the virtualization envi-
ronment, though they are not further implemented. The VRRA function, being 
considered indispensable for the virtualization of the wireless access, is described in 
more detail, two different algorithms being proposed.
The two novel proposed VRRA algorithms, according to the type of guaran-
tees of VBSs and the amount of contracted capacity and VBSs’ utilization, take 
the variability of the wireless medium into account. RRM mechanisms, namely 
admission control and MAC scheduling, are continuously updated, to be aware 
of the VBSs’ state relative to their service level agreement. Instead of looking 
at the wireless virtualization from the perspective of the instantiation of virtual 
machines into wireless nodes, our view is the virtualization of the wireless access 
to provide a contracted capacity to the VNet, in order to serve its end-users. Our 
approach is then agnostic to the point where the virtual node instantiation takes 
place, being possible to have the virtual nodes in each physical wireless node, or 
somewhere in the cloud requesting virtual access over a given geographic area 
covered by a set of wireless nodes. It is worthwhile noting that this capacity can 
be modified on demand, without manually changing the configuration of the 
network.
Comparing the wireless access virtualization, supported by the proposed 
OnDemandVRRA, with the standard approach, in which there are more than 
one network operator, each owning part of the physical infrastructure, it can be 
concluded that the former allows achieving a better performance from a cluster of 
BSs of several radio access technologies, enabling the provision of contracted capac-
ity for GRT VNets. It is demonstrated by simulation that in virtual scenarios the 
Cluster Serving Data Rate may increase by approximately 46% and the utilization by 
13%. On the other hand, for Virtual scenarios, the serving data rate of GRT VBSs 
is always greater than the minimum contracted being constrained by the defined 
BE VBSs reference data rate, which tends to be followed. The values achieved for 
the serving data rate are the lowest for BE services for the standard approach, but 
they can be larger for GRT services in the virtual approach, denoting, on one hand, 
the limitation arising from the split of the total cluster capacity by two operators, 
and on the other hand, the consequences of an uncoordinated allocation of radio 
resources when end-users are independently handled.
The proposed algorithm has been analyzed for different strategies for capac-
ity provision, several usage profiles, diverse combinations of VBSs from different 
types, and several quantities of VBSs deployed on the physical cluster.
It is concluded that a limit for the percentage of GRT VBSs’ contracted data 
rate should be defined as a function of the average capacity of the cluster and 

400 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
of the BE VBSs’ contracted capacity. From the comparison between the virtual 
access approach and the standard one, it can be said that the setting of minimum 
and reference values for VNet’s contracted data rate allows end-users to have a 
better network experience, considering the data rate as the main parameter to 
evaluate it.
Concerning the different strategies for capacity provision, that is, when the 
amount of contracted capacity by VBSs is over, on average, or under the physical 
capacity, it is concluded that a limit for the contracted data rate by GRT VBSs 
should be established in order to allow an efficient use of RUs among all the VBSs 
deployed within the cluster. It is verified that the Cluster Serving Data Rate may 
increase by approximately 20% if the amount of contracted capacity by BE VBS 
is 85% of the average capacity of the cluster, compared to the use case where the 
contracted capacity by the GRT VBS is the one with 85% of the cluster average 
data rate.
When the service profile is changing, OnDemandVRRA allows achieving iso-
lation among the virtual resources, since the requested data rate of a VBS does not 
prevent the other to achieve the contracted data rate, if they are GRT. It is verified 
that even when 80% of end-users are requesting service in the BE VBS, the GRT 
VBS reaches the contracted data rate as soon as the requested data rate is greater 
or equal to it.
When changing the percentage of VBSs of each type instantiated in a cluster 
of BSs, only minor differences are perceived in the values obtained for the defined 
metrics, namely, VBS and Cluster Average Serving Data Rate, when the total num-
ber of VBSs is fixed and the relation between GRT and BE data rate contracted is 
maintained. The total Average VBS Serving Data Rate has a maximum deviation 
among the defined use cases around 0.2% for GRT VBS and approximately 1.8% 
for BE VBSs. According to this, also small variations are verified for the Average 
Cluster Serving Data Rate, increasing around 0.7% when the number of GRT VBSs 
increases.
By varying the quantity of created VBSs, as well as the contracted data rate 
in the cluster (although GRT VBSs are maintained within contract), the average 
cluster data rate can decrease if the number of GRT VBSs (hence, the contracted 
capacity) is higher than the number of BE VBSs. It is observed that the best 
RU efficiency is achieved when the strategy for the overall capacity provision is 
to limit the capacity contracted by GRT VNets, overbooking the capacity con-
tracted by BE VNets. The worst RUs efficiency is observed when the number of 
GRT VBSs is the highest, which depicts the GRT overbooking situation as the 
worst case or the bound for virtual wireless access implementation. Furthermore, 
contracting more data rate for BE VBSs over the same physical capacity does not 
increase BE VBSs’ serving data rate, as the implemented strategy is to guarantee 
the minimum data rate of GRT VBSs, BE VBSs only using the remaining capacity 
of the cluster.

12.1 Introduction
The 5th-generation (5G) of wireless networks aims, among others, at achieving 
the goals that have been set by regulatory authorities regarding the seamless con-
nectivity of all types of devices. In various studies it is stated that next-generation 
networks should allow smart objects ranging from sensors and actuators to user 
equipment (UE) and vehicles, to connect and communicate in the Internet of 
things (IoT) [1]. Through the IoT, novel applications, such as smart cities, smart 
energy-grids, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and health-oriented body area 
networks, are expected to become a reality [2,3].
In addition, the attention that cooperative relaying (CR) received in the past 
decade resulted in numerous contributions from both academia and industry, which 
outlined the gains that can be harvested. Through CR, network performance can 
be improved due to path-loss reduction, multipath diversity, and shadowing mitiga-
tion. At the same time, wireless networks have evolved as well, migrating toward 
denser heterogeneous deployments demanding: 
 
1. Seamless integration of novel networking technologies, such as CR in wire-
less topologies.
 
2. Improved spectral efficiency in order to satisfy the needs of billions of users 
and devices that are connected in the IoT.
 
3. Consideration of the increased level of interference arising from the huge 
demand for wireless data and development of intelligent interference mitiga-
tion techniques.
 
4. Exploitation of the potential provided by heterogeneous networking in order 
to achieve the targets of the 5G wireless networks.
 
5. Support of the Green Communications paradigm aiming to enhance the sus-
tainability of future wireless networks through improved power efficiency.

Relays and Cooperative Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 405
In the currently deployed 4th-generation (4G) networks, new techniques were 
introduced to wireless networking, such as coordinated multipoint transmission/
reception, hierarchical and heterogeneous networks, and cooperative relaying. 
In the 802.16j and LTE-Advanced protocols, relay standards were detailed, includ-
ing in-band and out-band relaying, as well as transparent and nontransparent relay 
connectivity with the users [4,5]. However, it became obvious that the role of relays 
in these networks was limited due to a number of reasons. First, hardware con-
straints held back the deployment of full-duplex (FD) relaying as the loop interfer-
ence (LI) among the relay antennas cannot be easily mitigated. Also, mobile relays 
that provide the potential of ubiquitous connectivity were not adequately studied. 
In addition, cognitive relaying and device-to-device (D2D) relaying were partly 
investigated but their implementation was left for the next generation of wireless 
networks.
Moving forward, novel relay concepts must be developed and employed. As vari-
ous types of UE and smart objects are to be connected to the IoT, it is of great impor-
tance that the network provides improved access to support the increased traffic 
demand. As node density increases, various devices can act as relays to forward traffic 
from the end-nodes to the core network and vice versa. These include, on one hand, 
small cells installed through uncontrolled network deployment by users to provide 
improved indoor coverage. These small cells are connected to the network backbone 
through wired technologies and serve either a closed group of users or all the users 
that are located in their coverage area as long as wireless channels are available.
On the other hand, by adopting the D2D paradigm, using UE as relays for all 
kinds of traffic enhances traditional cellular deployments with ad-hoc elements. In 
D2D topologies, users can communicate with each other either through the assis-
tance of the wireless infrastructure or autonomously with direct communication of 
signalling and data [6,7]. In a similar way, vehicles, either private or public, may 
act as moving relays in order to avoid coverage holes in urban settings. Last but not 
the least, fixed relays with increased processing capabilities are destined to provide 
improved connectivity to groups of nodes that cannot directly communicate with 
the base station by employing advanced interference mitigation techniques [8–10].
At the heart of this chapter, there are unique challenges that have to be investi-
gated in order to provide solutions applicable to various network topologies, while 
being easily adapted for specific wireless protocols. More specifically, CR is a tech-
nology that can be considered in an abstract way to provide additional coverage or 
improve the end-to-end quality of service (QoS) in a multitude of networks rang-
ing from wireless personal area networks (WPANs) and wireless sensor networks 
(WSNs) to cellular topologies. Conducting research and providing algorithms with 
increased diversity allows CR to maximize its potential and provide robustness 
to communications facing challenges in environments with increased propagation 
losses and excessive fading.
This chapter serves as a useful manual by providing important definitions 
for relay networks and addressing practical challenges that must be tackled. 

406 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Various  relaying strategies are studied, such as opportunistic relay selection 
(ORS), where after a selection phase one relay or relay-pair performs end-to-
end communication. Also, successive relaying (SuR) is presented where a source 
and one relay concurrently transmit to mimic FD operation. In SuR, inter-relay 
interference (IRI) arises between the receiving and the transmitting relaying 
and mitigation techniques, such as interference cancellation (IC) and interfer-
ence avoidance (IA), can be employed. Another interesting relay strategy is FD 
relaying in network where multiantenna relays are available. However, loop-
interference has to be reduced as the output antenna of the relay interferes with 
the reception of the input antenna. To facilitate interference mitigation and 
improve the overall network performance, buffer-aided (BA) relays are used in 
the scenarios due to the increased freedom that they provide to transmission 
scheduling. Furthermore, a discussion about possible relay types for 5G net-
works is included and the ability of each type to serve applications with different 
requirements is studied.
It is considered that 5G relaying must exploit and support a multitude of devices 
and applications, respectively. So, it is important to adjust relay functionality on an 
application basis and toward this end, relay selection policies are presented aiming 
at high performance and low coordination overhead. More specifically, this chapter 
includes three different relay selection policies, which are tailored to different types 
of applications: 
 
1. A reduced channel estimation overhead policy for high mobility scenarios.
 
2. A delay minimization policy for delay critical applications.
 
3. A low-power policy for power-efficient communications.
In addition, since multirelay networks must be efficiently coordinated, both cen-
tralized and distributed network coordination approaches are analyzed. For these 
schemes sketch diagrams are presented for message exchange and derive the imple-
mentation complexity order for relay selection.
The structure of this chapter is as follows. In Section 12.2, an in-depth discus-
sion on CR is given with useful definitions of various relay strategies. Then, in 
Section 12.3, different interference cases are described, as well as respective miti-
gation techniques. In Section 12.4, a detailed description of possible relay classes 
is provided for 5G wireless networks and the capability of each class to support 
a specific application. Next, in Section 12.5, the system model is presented and 
the preliminaries necessary for understanding the contributions of this chapter. 
Subsequently, the three relay selection policies are presented in Section 12.6, based 
on the application’s targets and centralized and distributed network coordination is 
analyzed in Section 12.7. In Section 12.8, performance evaluation and comparisons 
between relay classes are performed for each selection policy. Finally, Section 12.9 
outlines some important future research directions and Section 12.10 provides the 
conclusions drawn from this chapter.

Relays and Cooperative Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 407
12.2 Cooperative Relaying
The notion of cooperation has a significant and positive impact on the physical 
world. Two or more entities tend to cooperate and overcome difficulties and bur-
dens in order to achieve goals that otherwise would require much more effort or 
would even be impossible. It is natural that human-like behavior, such as coopera-
tion, are inherited by wireless communication networks aiming to improve their 
performance. A technique that has received numerous contributions during the 
past years is CR where sources of information communicate with their correspond-
ing destinations through relays.
Relays play the role of intermediate nodes offering three distinct gains to the 
network. First, they improve the characteristics of a wireless link through increased 
diversity [11] as additional and independent paths are available for the signal to 
propagate, thus reducing errors at the receiver. Second, as the transmission is bro-
ken into hops, the transmitter is closer to the receiver, resulting in reduced pathloss. 
Third, in cluttered environments, intelligent relay positioning and mobile relays 
provide resiliency against shadowing. In this relaying paradigm, two or more hops 
are required for the signal to reach the destination, thus resulting in a trade-off 
between harvesting network gains and increasing resources expenditure due to the 
use of more channels or more time-slots.
Various types of relays are used in wireless networks and the two main classes 
are amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) based on the process-
ing of relays on the signal. In AF relaying, the relay receives the source’s signal and 
performs amplification in the analog domain, as well as phase steering before for-
warding the signal to the destination. In DF relaying, the relay receives the source’s 
signal, decodes it, and reencodes it prior to transmission toward the destination. In 
general, AF relays are more simple to implement as they are repeaters that do not 
perform advanced processing to the signal, as is the case in DF relaying where error 
correction and different modulation schemes can be used [11]. Moreover, AF relays 
not only amplify the desired signal but also the noise, in contrast to DF relays that 
decode the signal and try to remove the noise before reencoding takes place. So, 
due to the more complex signal processing performed by DF relays, increased delay 
compared to AF relays is introduced.
In a different spirit, depending on the ability of a relay to perform or not concur-
rent reception and transmission, the relays are characterized as FD or half-duplex 
(HD). When a relay operates in FD mode, only one channel is used for the end-
to-end transmission, as the relay is forwarding the signal that is currently receiving 
from the source. However, this results in increased hardware complexity and LI 
from the relay’s output antenna to its input antenna. If an HD relay is employed, 
orthogonal frequency channels have to be used, thus leading in reduced spectral 
efficiency; a loss imposed by the half-duplex constraint (HDC) of HD relays. 
Interesting relaying strategies, such as SuR [12], involve two or more HD relays 
and select one relay to receive the source’s signal while another relay is forwarding 

408 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
a previously received signal to the destination. SuR mimics FD relaying using HD 
relays and offers increased spectral efficiency, as long as the IRI introduced by the 
simultaneous transmission is taken into consideration.
Depending on the physical characteristics of the relay node, there are many 
examples involving different relay types. The classic relay is a low-cost, power-
supplied node that is set by the mobile operator in order to provide relay gains 
without requiring additional infrastructure, such as wired backhaul, which limits 
the practicality of small base, that is, micro and pico-cells [13]. However, predic-
tions for the future wireless networks [6] bring in that the density of the users is 
rapidly increasing, thus leading to the increase of the number of the relays as well. 
In scenarios where numerous relays are available, battery-dependent relays either 
fixed or mobile, for example, on top of public vehicles [14], offer additional degrees 
of freedom compared to power supplied relays. Furthermore, similarly to the cases 
of WSNs and peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, users will play the role of relays 
for other users, thus giving rise to the D2D paradigm. Consequently, the exten-
sive use of battery-dependent relays require the use of power-efficient techniques in 
order to avoid power outages, which threaten the diversity gains of CR.
Focusing on the number of relays that are employed to forward the signal to 
the destination in each hop, the primary categorization is between multiple relay 
transmission (MRT) and opportunistic relay transmission (ORT). For simplicity, 
let us consider a two-hop network where the signal reaches the destination after 
two phases and there is no direct link between the source and the destination. In 
MRT, the source broadcasts the signal to the relays that try to either amplify the 
signal in the analog domain or decode and reencode the signal prior to forwarding. 
As more than one relays participate in the second hop, more resources are needed 
either in time or in frequency in order to avoid interference when the destination is 
receiving each relay’s signal. On the contrary, in ORS or best relay selection (BRS), 
the source either broadcasts or activates one relay to receive the signal through a 
selection process that involves channel state information (CSI) [15] and the charac-
teristics of the relay, such as available energy [16,17] or buffer status [18,19]. Then, 
only one relay transmits to the destination using one channel, thus saving precious 
spectral and temporal resources. The most notable characteristic of ORT is that it 
exhibits the same diversity performance as MRT as proven in [15].
12.3 Interference Mitigation
Wireless networking is the major component of the ubiquitous access that is 
enjoyed by users and an enabling technology for the IoT that connects all kinds of 
smart objects into a network that is envisioned to offer new and exciting applica-
tions ranging from Smart Cities to Health Monitoring. As fast deployment and 
increased coverage is offered through wireless technologies, wireless networking 
is preferred for the access part of the network over wired networks. However, due 

Relays and Cooperative Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 409
to the broadcast nature of wireless propagation, when two or more signals use the 
same frequency channel, interference occurs leading in performance degradation 
as the receiver cannot distinguish the desired signal from the interference signal.
As denser deployments of wireless networks are performed by the mobile 
operators and users, interference mitigation techniques or exploitation have to be 
considered, otherwise network performance will be compromised. Moreover, as 
spectral-efficient relaying techniques operate in FD or mimic FD using HD relays, 
LI and IRI arise, respectively, at the relay’s reception. Unless intelligent algorithms 
are employed, interference becomes a bottleneck that reduces the end-to-end per-
formance of CR.
In FD relay networks, LI is the main limitation in achieving the optimal spectral 
efficiency as the relay’s transmission causes interference while it receives the source’s 
signal. Various techniques were presented including antenna isolation, power adap-
tation, IA, IC, and precoding. More specifically, IA is based on the multiple relay 
nodes available and the selection of one or more nodes, which provide links with 
the best end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). In addition, IC 
is a strategy that aims at decoding the interference signal at the receiver prior to the 
decoding of the desired signal. Thus, interference-free reception can be achieved if 
the interference-to-signal-plus-noise ratio (ISNR) is above a decoding threshold, 
which is linked to the transmission rate employed by the source.
Antenna isolation was studied in [8] where natural isolation of the transmit 
and receive antennas provides an efficient way of reducing the LI level. The use of 
objects, such as building and shielding plates, is mentioned and isolation is fur-
ther elaborated to include techniques, such as directional antennas and orthogonal 
polarization. However, in most cases LI residuals remain and additional techniques 
are employed to reduce LI to noise levels. A useful technique is a power adaptation 
that exploits CSI knowledge and calculates the required power level for successful 
transmission by matching it to the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to support 
a target rate. In [20,21] the LI is significantly reduced as the power level in the 
relay-destination (
)
RD  link is adapted to the fading conditions, thus improving 
the SINR in the first hop of two-hop relay networks. In [9,21], the availability of 
multiple FD relays is exploited by using ORS to choose the FD relay with the least 
amount of LI in each time slot. An interesting characteristic of FD relaying is that 
the relays know a priori the LI signal and interference cancellation can be applied 
with increased chances of success. In [8], time-domain cancellation (TDC) is pro-
posed offering advantages, such as resiliency of the desired signal and keeping the 
same number of input and output antennas on the relay. On the downside, TDC 
is prone to channel estimation errors while it does not exploit the spatial domain 
and may offer worse isolation. The authors in [22], examine hardware constraints 
of FD relay receivers and the effect of imperfect CSI, which result in an amount of 
residual LI that cannot be canceled. Precoding techniques develop filters aiming 
to reduce LI level making use of CSI of the LI channel. In [8] various filters are 
designed for the following cases: (1) antenna selection at the receiver, (2) beam selection, 

410 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
(3) null-space projection filters that enable the relay to receive and transmit in differ-
ent subspaces, and (4) minimum mean square error (MMSE), which minimizes the 
distortion of the desired signal caused by the other three filter designs.
Contrary to FD relaying, in SuR with HD relays, it is possible that relays do 
not know a priori the interference signal and for this reason interference cancella-
tion is more difficult to perform. Trying to mitigate the IRI interference, various 
techniques were proposed similar in spirit to those for LI mitigation but taking 
into consideration the different topology of SuR. In [23], a two-hop relay network 
is considered where IRI is decoded and subtracted when an interference cancel-
lation threshold is satisfied. Using repetition coding, the source signal is trans-
mitted after being decoded either IRI-free if IC was performed or if its SINR 
was above the decoding threshold. Extending this work to the case of multiple 
available relays [24,25] proposed the combination of ORS and SuR by selecting 
a relay-pair that achieves the maximum end-to-end SNR either by applying IC 
or by choosing the pair with the minimum IRI. Other works [26], propose the 
use of the IRI signal through superposition coding in order to achieve increased 
diversity gain when the receiver decodes the superposition of the IRI and the 
desired signal, while already having knowledge of the IRI signal from a previous 
reception.
A further extension for SuR was given in [10,18,27] where BA HD relays were 
employed in order to provide increased freedom when selecting the relay-pair, as 
relays with packets residing in their buffers were considered in the selection pro-
cess. In this way, IRI avoidance is further improved and the end-to-end QoS 
target can be achieved. Many studies present power adaptation algorithms, which 
exploit CSI knowledge optimally setting the power level at the source and the 
transmitting relay to minimize the IRI and maintain the QoS of the source-relay-
destination (SRD) communication. In [10], the optimal relay-pair is selected by 
first calculating the power level of relays that can transmit to the destination, 
that is, relays having non-empty buffers and then examining all possible pairs 
by evaluating the fading conditions in the inter-relay (IR) and source-relay (SR) 
channels.
12.4 Relay Classes and Applications
This section discusses in detail different relay classes and the potential of each class 
to support various applications.
12.4.1 Relay Classification
The classification of 5G relays depends foremost on the type of devices, which are 
to be deployed. Table 12.1 includes the capabilities of each relay class, ranging from 
low to high for various characteristics. 

Relays and Cooperative Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 411
First, processing capabilities vary significantly, as relay classes range from UE, 
such as smartphones and tablets, to battery-dependent mobile and fixed relays, as 
well as power-supplied fixed relays. Although UE’s processing power has dramati-
cally increased in recent years, their battery-dependence and small size puts them 
at a disadvantage against the other relay classes.
In addition, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) capability is expected to 
be a basic element in 5G setups. Again, as relay size increases, it becomes easier to 
fit multiple antennas on each relay. A subject related to MIMO is the potential for 
FD relaying, where the same channel is used to relay the signal in both hops at 
the expense of LI from the relay’s output to its input. On one hand, the small size 
of UE prohibits them from employing isolated antennas, while directional anten-
nas cannot be used due to the need for isotropic radiation. In the same spirit, the 
antenna installation on mobile relays may face difficulties compared to fixed relays 
that are easier to configure, as fading conditions change faster and this reflects on 
the performance of LI mitigation as well [8].
Lately, the storage capability and buffer management has been discussed in 
various works [10,18,21,27,28], as buffer-aided relays are able to increase the diver-
sity of the network, as long as a specific amount of delay can be tolerated. It is to be 
expected that mobile relays, should employ medium-sized buffers, as packet expira-
tion increases due to frequent handovers and disconnections. On the other hand, 
fixed relays can employ larger queues as their relative positions to UE and other 
devices remain constant for extended periods.
Another critical characteristic for 5G networks is the accurate and fast channel 
estimation, which provides the means for efficient resource utilization as the relay’s 
behavior is adapted to its environment. As spectrum and channel condition sensing

depend on the quality of the antenna sensors and hardware, small-sized UE pro-
vide decreased performance while more advanced mobile and fixed devices exhibit 
improved behavior.
The last characteristic that motivated the use of all kinds of devices as potential 
relays is node density. Here, UE have the advantage compared to operator-deployed 
relays and their efficient usage is the main target in D2D communications. 
Regarding the other classes, battery-dependent mobile and fixed relays can be 
installed easier compared to their power supplied counterparts, and their density is 
expected to be larger.
12.4.2 Application Performance Classification
Table 12.2 contains applications and the level of performance that each relay class 
can achieve. It is obvious that each application can aim at multiple performance 
goals that require separate investigation. 
Taking into consideration that ubiquitous communication is to be provided 
to mobile UE and objects, high mobility should be efficiently supported in 5G 
networks. As the relative position among the relay and the end-nodes changes 
fast, channel estimation is performed harder and relays with accurate and fast 
sensing offer superior performance. Moreover, the increased coverage offered 
by power-supplied fixed relays results in less handovers and possible outages. 
However, the increased density of UEs and mobile relays results in outage avoid-
ance if efficient relay selection schemes are employed. On the downside, the 
small transmit power and coverage offered by UE, lower their potential in high 
mobility applications.
In many cases, delay is the most critical concern, for example, emer-
gency applications, high-precision industrial applications and various types of

smart-grid applications. The delay is denoted as the time required for a packet 
to reach the destination after it is transmitted by the source. For a fixed packet 
size, the average delay scales with the achieved throughput [29]. To this end, the 
relay device must be capable of handling delays by increasing the throughput. So, 
relays that offer low-latency processing, full-duplexity, and efficient buffer man-
agement, have an advantage in these types of applications. On the other hand, 
as stated in various works [10,18,27,28], when the number of relays increases, so 
does the average delay. As a result, the increased density of UE might lead in the 
distribution of various packets in many nodes, thus leading to packet expiration. 
Similarly, mobile relays that offer frequent handovers with the served devices, 
coupled with their reduced FD potential, might not offer the same performance 
as fixed infrastructure relays.
Regarding economic and environmental sustainability, Green Communications 
is a major research topic. In this field, relay selection aiming at efficient power 
usage, leads to two distinct gains. On one hand, carbon footprint reduction of 
telecommunication networks leads to environmentally friendly communications 
and decreased power expenses by mobile operators and users. On the other hand, 
reduced public exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) is achieved. Low EMF 
exposure has been a top priority for researchers, regulatory authorities, and opera-
tors in forthcoming international research initiatives (e.g., Horizon 2020 [30]). As 
a result, techniques that rely on smart-power adaptation based on channel condi-
tions are of utmost importance. In this area, exploiting the increased density of UE 
might leverage their lower processing potential and offer extra channels, which can 
route the signals with more efficient power consumption as the offered diversity is 
greater. Still, more advanced nodes with increased MIMO and estimation capabili-
ties might support this type of application, at the expense of reduced diversity and 
costlier deployments.
12.5 System Model and Preliminaries
12.5.1 System Model
Consider a two-hop system where a source S communicates with a destination D 
via a cluster of relays . As various classes of relays with diverse characteristics are 
available, their specifications for processing, MIMO (or FD capability), channel 
estimation, and transmit power differ to a significant degree.
The UE relay class consists of single-antenna terminals and no FD capa-
bility. Moreover, they use the lowest transmit power equal to 0.2P, where P 
is the maximum transmit power that can be used by a network node. Then, 
the battery-dependent mobile relays are considered to be MIMO equipped 
and FD capable. However, due to the varying fading environment and dif-
ficulties in antenna isolation compared to fixed relays, increased amount of 

414 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
LI affects the FD operation, while their power output is equal to 0.8P  due to 
battery limitations. For the class of battery-dependent fixed relays, MIMO and 
FD operation is assumed, as well as LI is reduced due to optimized antenna 
isolation. Their transmit power is equal to that of mobile battery-dependent 
relays. Finally, the power-supplied relay class supports multiple antennas and 
has FD characteristics, instantaneous channel estimation, and the highest level 
of transmit power P. For the  transmit power ratios, the output power values of 
LTE-Advanced [4] are used while  lowering the power of battery-dependent 
nodes in order to justify power-supply limitations.
Multiple antenna relays are equipped with N = 2 antennas, one for reception 
and one for transmission. Each relay Rk can operate in HD and in FD mode except 
for the UE, which operate only in HD. In FD mode, information can be trans-
mitted to and from a point in two directions simultaneously on the same physical 
channel [8]. In this topology, ideal FD operation is not considered, but instead, 
LI at the relay is present. As an alternative to FD operation, successive relaying 
is adopted, where in each time slot two relays are used simultaneously. In this 
strategy, one relay receives the source’s signal while another forward a previously 
received signal to the destination. In this way, FD operation can be mimicked but 
at the cost of IRI.
Each relay Rk holds a buffer (data queue) Qk of length Lk (number of data ele-
ments) where it can store source data that has been decoded at the relay and can be 
forwarded to the destination. The parameter lk ∈
+
, l
L
k
k
∈[0,
] denotes the num-
ber of data elements that are stored in buffer Qk; at the beginning, each relay buffer 
is empty (i.e., lk = 0 for all k). In line with Table 12.1, it is assumed that for UE 
L

k = 0.25 , for battery-dependent mobile relays L
L

fixed relays L

k = .
Figure 12.1 depicts the network topology where a pool of relays support the 
communication between a source and a destination each time. Also, the differ-
ent types of interference are denoted, IRI for SuR transmission and LI for FD 
transmission. These relaying strategies are employed to satisfy the requirements of 
three specific applications targeting different performance metrics. More specifi-
cally, the delay critical application targets delay minimization and the transmitters 
use fixed power levels, while the number of transmitted codewords is matched to 
the capacity that is achieved in each time slot. The high mobility application adopts 
fixed power levels, due to CSI acquisition difficulties where CSI at the receivers is 
assumed. Also, a SNR threshold Z is set in order to avoid constant relay selection 
when SNR higher than the outage threshold γ0 is desired. Finally, the green com-
munication application uses power adaptation targeting a specific SNR threshold 
γ0 in order to achieve power reduction. In this power minimization scenario, the 
threshold Z can be expressed by a target power value that must not be surpassed. 
As a result, when the power value Z is satisfied, there is no need to perform relay 
or relay-pair selection and the previously selected relay(s) continue to serve the end-
to-end communication.

12.5.2 SNR Expressions
In our model, a reception is successful when the SNR at the receiver is above a SNR 
threshold γ0. Hence, the instantaneous SNR from S to Ri and the instantaneous 
SINR from R j to D when relay Ri is selected for reception and relay R j is selected 
for transmission (in full-duplex i

respectively. Note that Equation 12.2 does not consider interference from the source,

12.5.3.1 Max–Min Relay Selection in Successive Relaying
The max min
−
 relay selection policy implemented in a successive relaying network takes 
a different form if the IRI can be canceled at the relays. In [24,25,31] a reactive relay 
selection policy is proposed. More specifically, instead of considering only {

 channel gains, the feasibility of IC is also examined. In this way, with a very 
simple IC condition the following two cases for relay selection are given. 
 
1. If candidate relay Rk can perform IC, then it may be selected to receive from 
the source based on the following value:

(12.6)
It is obvious that having two simultaneous transmissions by the source and the 
transmitting relay reduces the diversity of the network, as R* cannot participate 
in the selection process due to the half-duplex constraint. The lack of buffering at 
the relays results in the coupling of relay selection with the previous transmission 
phase where the currently transmitting relay was chosen among K −1 candidates 

Relays and Cooperative Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 417
as one relay was forwarding to the destination and did not receive the source’s 
frame. Additional diversity loss is introduced when IRI is not effectively mitigated 
but when IC cancellation or avoidance is feasible, a full-duplex behavior can be 
achieved and the half-duplex loss is leveraged.
12.5.3.2 Max–Max Relay Selection 
The max max
−
 relay selection (MMRS) [19] is the first relay selection policy that 
studied the diversity behavior of buffer-aided relay nodes. Given that the relay 
nodes are equipped with buffers and thus can store the data received from the 
source, the max max
−
 policy splits the relay selection decision in two parts and 
selects the relay with the best source-relay link for reception and the relay with the 
best relay-destination link for transmission. The max max
−
 selection policy follows 
the conventional two-slot cooperative transmission where the first slot is dedicated 
for the source transmission and the second slot for the relaying transmission, but 
the relay node may not be the same for both phases of the protocol. The max max

relay selection policy can be written as

where Rr

of the cooperative protocol, respectively. It has been proven that the max max
−
 
relay selection policy also ensures full diversity equal to the number of the relays 
and provides a significant coding gain in comparison to the conventional max min
−
 
selection scheme. However, it is worth noting that the previous selection strategy 
assumes that no relay’s buffer can be empty or full at any time and thus all relays 
have always the option of receiving or transmitting [19, Sec. III. C].
12.5.3.3 Max-Link Relay Selection
The previous relay selection schemes are associated with a two-slot cooperative pro-
tocol where the schedule for the source and relay transmission is fixed a priori. 
In [28], this limitation is relaxed and each slot is allowed to be dynamically allo-
cated to the source or a relay transmission, according to the instantaneous quality 
of the links and the status of the relays’ buffers. More specifically, the proposed 
max-link relay selection scheme fully exploits the flexibility offered by the buf-
fers at the relay nodes and at each time selects the strongest link for transmission 
(source or relay transmission) among the available links. A source-relay link is con-
sidered to be available when the corresponding relay node is not full and therefore 
can receive data from the source, while a relay-destination link is considered to be 

418 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
available when the relay node is not empty and thus can transmit the source’s 
data toward the destination. The proposed scheme compares the quality of the 
available links and adjusts the relay selection decision and the time-slot alloca-
tion to the strongest link. If a source-relay link is the strongest link, the source 
transmits and the corresponding relay is selected for reception; on the other 
hand, if a relay-destination link is the strongest link, the corresponding relay is 
selected for transmission. The max-link relay selection policy can be analytically 
expressed as follows:

12.5.3.4 Space Full-Duplex MMRS
The Space Full-Duplex MMRS (SFD-MMRS) [27] is based on the idea of choosing 
different relays for reception and transmission, according to the quality of the chan-
nels, so that the relay selected for reception and the relay selected for transmission 
can receive and transmit at the same time (i.e., in one time slot). The case where suc-
cessive transmissions are performed is illustrated in Figure 12.1. In contrast to [19] 
in which reception and transmission have to be performed in successive time slots 
(as the same relay may be selected for reception and transmission), here two relays 
are simultaneously activated for reception and transmission. The relay pair (

SFD-MMRS provides the best performance in terms of both capacity and outage 
probability, compared with the existing schemes in the literature. However, as 
in [19], the strategy assumes that no relay’s buffer can be empty or full at any time 
and in addition the IRI is assumed to be negligible.
12.5.3.5 Min-Power Relay Selection
The selection scheme of [10] called min-power merges the relay-pair selection algo-
rithm of 18 with max-link selection of [28]. In this selection scheme, the target is 
to minimize the overall power expenditure; thus power adaptation is adopted. The 
min-power scheme is associated with a one-slot cooperative protocol (similar to the 
min-power and SFD-MMRS in [27] where, however, IRI and power minimization 
are not considered), contrary to protocols where the selection algorithm’s opera-
tion spans two consecutive time slots (as in [19]). At each time slot, the source S 
attempts to transmit data to a selected relay with a nonfull buffer (i.e., Rr ∈), 
and at the same time another relay with a nonempty buffer (i.e., Rt ∈, R

12.5.3.6 Suboptimal Joint Relay-Pair Selection
The work in [32] presented a suboptimal scheme adopting DSSC [33,34] to select 
the best relay-pair using only partial CSI. To this end, a rate threshold Z is set at 
the start of the network’s operation and is made globally known to its nodes. The 
relay-pair bRtRr
v( )  in time slot v is selected as

where rbRtRr
v( )  is the achievable rate in time slot v of the optimal pair of time slot v −1. 
Thus, in each time slot the previously selected relay-pair is examined first to check 
whether or not it can support a transmission rate above or equal to Z. If this is 
the case, CSI acquisition and exchange are avoided and switching between relay 
branches is reduced. On the contrary, when bRtRr
v(

− cannot achieve Z, a new round of 
relay-pair selection is triggered.
12.6 5G Relay Selection
Here, the three relay selection policies are given which are tailored to a specific per-
formance metric, set by the application taking place. The proposed policies com-
bine the following three strategies: 
 
◾Max-link selection [28], where only one link is selected among the available 
SR and RD links, resulting in improved diversity. In [10], max-link with 
power adaptation was proposed to lower the power consumption.
 
◾Successive opportunistic relaying (SOR), where two selected relays mimic 
FD operation, as one receives the source’s signal while the other forward a 
previously received signal to the destination, providing spectral efficiency. 
Fixed-power SOR has been studied in [18], for throughput maximization. 
Moreover, SOR with power adaptation was the subject of [10], for power 
minimization.
 
◾FD opportunistic relaying, where one selected relay transmits and receives on 
the same channel using its two antennas, offering throughput enhancement. 
FD with power adaptation was studied in [21], to reduce the power expendi-
ture of the network.
As FD and SOR lead to FD operation, these schemes are denoted by FD, while 
max-link by ML. In the following, relay selection policies are introduced that can 
be employed in (1) high mobility, (2) delay critical, and (3) green communications 
scenarios.

Relays and Cooperative Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 421
12.6.1 High Mobility
In high mobility scenarios, constant CSI acquisition and processing is difficult, 
and fast relay selection must be performed in order to avoid disconnections and 
outages. For this reason, CSI is assumed to be available at the receiver-side only and 
thus, the transmitters use fixed power levels. SOR is omitted due to the incurred 
complexity of maintaining connection with two relays. As a result, only FD and 
max-link schemes are adopted, which offer increased throughput and robustness, 
respectively. Here, one best relay, denoted by Rb is selected and in subsequent trans-
missions it is examined first on whether or not it satisfies a SNR threshold denoted 
by Z, for FD transmission. So, in the uth time slot

12.6.2 Delay Critical
In many applications, low delay is the main target and relay selection policy must be 
adjusted toward delay minimization. As the average delay scales with the achieved 
throughput [29] for constant packet size, relay selection searches for a FD relay or a 
relay-pair, which operates in successive mode, in order to maximize the end-to-end 
throughput. This selection policy in a time slot v is formulated as

12.6.3 Green Communications
As wireless networks migrate toward power-efficient deployments, power minimi-
zation is targeted. In these cases, power adaptation leads to the adjustment of the 
power level at the transmitters’ side and defines relay selection. As proposed in [10], 
relay selection should take into account the minimum sum of powers required in a 
time slot v if full-duplex or successive relaying takes place. The power levels are cal-
culated in such a way so as to fulfill a SNR threshold γ0 set by the application. In this 
scenario, the source and the transmitting relay are able to perform power adaptation 
and the relay which transmits to the destination defines its power level as 
 
P
n
g
Rj
RjD
= γ0
 
(12.19)
Then, in the case of interference at the relay, the source power level is found for a 
specific SNR threshold γ0 as in Equation 12.1. Thus, solving for PSi

not affect the source’s output power

It must be remarked here that power adaptation improves the performance of FD 
and SOR compared to fixed-power schemes as LI and IRI levels decrease due to the 
optimal power levels in the RD links.
12.7 Selection Coordination
It is worth mentioning that the majority of relevant works in the area of relay 
 selection do not provide detailed descriptions of their implementations. There 
are several works that are related to the classic relay selection whose distrib-
uted implementation is presented in [15], and selection with outdated CSI, whose 
 implementation is presented in [35]. In order to address practicality concerns on 
BA relay selection, in this part, both centralized and distributed implementations 
are discussed. For both approaches, it is assumed that the duration of pilot symbols 
is very small compared to the channel’s coherence time of one time slot (see also 
discussion in [15]).
12.7.1 Centralized Coordination
First, in the centralized approach, the source is employed to select the relay-pair 
or FD relay in each time slot, while keeping track of the buffer sizes for all relays. 
At the start of each time slot, in phase 1, the destination transmits a pilot sequence 
to the K  relays and the {
}
D
Ri
→
 CSI is estimated by each relay Ri. By assuming 
that the reciprocity property of antennas holds, relays can estimate the {
}
R
D
i →
 
CSI; similar arguments hold for the rest of the estimates, whenever necessary. Next, 
in the second phase, the relays take turns according to their indices, and broadcast 
pilots sequences to the source and the other K −1 relays. Thus, the source acquires 
the {
}
S
Ri
→
 CSI for all Ri ∈ and each relay R j acquires the {
}
R
R
i
j
→
 CSI for 
all Ri ∈; also, in this step, the LI channels are estimated, that is, each relay R j 
acquires the {
}
R
R
j
j
→
 CSI. The third phase starts by employing each relay R j to 
sequentially inform the source on its buffer state and the CSIs of their respective 
{
}
R
R
i
j
→
 for all Ri ∈, as well as the {
}
R
D
j →
 CSI. When all the relays have fini-
shed transmitting, the required information for centralized relay-pair selection has 
been gathered at the source.
For schemes that are based on power adaptation, selecting the relay-pair or 
relay that requires the least power expenditure involves the use of all the CSI that 
was acquired in the three phases. Compared to the cases where relays are assumed 
isolated and IRI is negligible as in [27], an additional overhead comes from the 
acquisition of the {
}
R
R
→
 and LI CSI, which are required in order to perform 
power adaptation and minimize the IRI and LI. The three phases of the centralized 
selection are shown in Figure 12.2. 

424 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
12.7.2 Distributed Coordination
The distributed approach for the relay-pair selection process is based on the use of 
synchronized timers, as proposed in [15] for single relay selection. This approach 
was adopted in the distributed joint relay-pair selection of [32], where the idea of 
DSSC [33,34] was extended for the BA SOR scenario. In the first phase, the source 
broadcasts a pilot sequence and the K  relays estimate the {
}
S
R
→
 CSI. Then, in 
the second phase, the destination sends pilot signals to the relays, which extract the 
{
}
R
D
→
 CSI. During the third phase, each relay takes turns in transmitting pilots 
to the other K −1 relays that calculate the {
}
R
R
→
 CSI, while simultaneously, the 
LI CSI is estimated. The final, fourth phase requires that each relay notifies the rest 
K −1 of its buffers status. Then, each relay sets its timer to be inversely proportional 
to the level of power minimization that can be achieved according to the total 
transmission power that is required. The four phases of the distributed selection are 
depicted in Figure 12.3. 
Both centralized and distributed selection can be extended with DSSC in order 
to avoid constant rounds of CSI acquisition. In this case, the relay or relay-pair that 
was selected to perform an FD transmission, is examined first on whether or not 
it can satisfy the predetermined SNR threshold Z corresponding to the desired 
transmission rate. For the scenario of green communications, the threshold Z cor-
responds to a power value that must not be surpassed while achieving the desired 
transmission rate. If Z is not surpassed then the estimation of the CSI of the other

As a final remark, when comparing the two approaches, although at first, the 
extra phase of distributed selection might be considered as an additional overhead, 
it is the third phase of the centralized approach that notifies the source of the vari-
ous CSIs and buffer status that will introduce the largest amount of performance 
degradation, as pilot symbols are only a tiny fraction of a time slot’s coherence time.
12.8 Numerical Results
In this part, the performance evaluation of the proposed relay selection policies is 
presented. More specifically, results are given for the average throughput for the 
high mobility application, the average delay for the delay critical application and 
the power reduction for the green communications application.
To examine the impact of the heterogeneous relay classes, three different pools of 
relays are compared. The first consists of eight UE, the second is a mixture of three 
UE, two battery-dependent mobile relays, two battery-dependent fixed relays, and 
one power-supplied fixed relay, denoted as MIX in the figures, while the last pool 
provides four fixed power-supplied (FPS) relays. The buffer size for a UE relay is set 
at L = 4, for a battery-dependent mobile relay L = 8 and for the fixed relays L =16.

=  bpcu when 
the equivalent SNR threshold Z is satisfied. The results are depicted in Figure 12.4.
It is clear that the worst behavior is exhibited by the case when K = 8 UE are 
available as relays and only D2D communications are performed. This relay class 
is able to adopt only the max-link strategy, as FD capability falls victim to the 
devices’ small size antenna isolation and low processing functionality, while, SOR 
is omitted in this scenario. The mixed pool of relays sports the best performance, 
mainly due to the battery-dependent relays, which transmit with lower power com-
pared to the power-supplied fixed relay. As fixed power levels are considered in this 
scenario, LI is lower compared to the case of K = 4 FPS relays.
12.8.2 Average Delay
Next, Figure 12.5 shows results regarding the relay selection policy, which targets 
delay minimization. One may observe that the worst performance is achieved 
by the UE only the pool of relays. Although at the lowest transmit SNR value 
it has slightly better performance than the case of mixed relays, this can be 
attributed to the smaller buffer size of the UE. When transmit SNR increases,

the set of mixed relay achieves better performance as it has an extra transmission 
mode, that is, FD relaying to compliment max-link and SOR, thus allowing for 
more packets to be transmitted from the relays’ buffers. The best performance is 
observed by the four fixed relays. Although all the relays have larger buffers than 
UE and mobile relays, their number is smaller and they use all three different 
relaying modes. 
12.8.3 Power Reduction
In the last comparisons, the power reduction performance of the Green 
Communications’ relay selection policy is depicted in Figure 12.6. It must be out-
lined that when FD or SOR is employed, the overall power reduction achieved by 
the source and the transmitting relay is calculated. On the contrary, when max-link 
is used, only the power reduction of the source or the transmitting relay is calcu-
lated. Again, the UE pool of relays performs worse than the other two cases, as 
max-link is used in more instances. The other two cases perform similarly, with the 
case of K = 4 FPS relays offering slightly improved results. In this case, a trade-off 
can be seen between employing less relays offering better performance compared 
to more relays in the other two cases, at the cost of increased relay complexity and 
capital expenditure.

12.9 Open Challenges
The proposed algorithms address several challenges of wireless relay networks 
under specific assumptions regarding the symmetry of the network and the CSI. 
However, the area of CR is quite demanding and the continuous transformation 
and introduction of novel networking paradigms results in a dynamic and fertile 
research field. Thus, there are several future directions toward spectral-efficient het-
erogeneous networks.
Starting from implementation complexity, novel relaying algorithms pro-
viding near optimal performance with low CSI overhead are important. Such 
schemes should be developed under CSI at the receiver-only availability to com-
pensate for fast changes in network topologies and relays with low processing and 
channel-estimation capabilities. Toward this end, more accurate CSI estimation 
and prediction techniques could decrease the cost of constant CSI acquisition 
and processing. Also, distributed synchronization should be examined as relay 
networks consist of multiple nodes which coordinate to achieve specific perfor-
mance goals.
It is quite common in the literature that i.i.d. channels are considered aiming to 
simplify the performance analysis of the relay network. However, in reality i.n.i.d.

Relays and Cooperative Techniques for 5G Systems ◾ 429
topologies are dominant and relay selection should be adjusted to this fact. So, 
networks with asymmetric channels should be further examined, especially for BA 
relaying where efficient scheduling algorithms should prioritize relays whose buffers 
tend to become empty or full in order to avoid diversity losses.
Next, interference mitigation is a field where contributions are expected to 
enable FD operation either using a single relay or relay-pairs as in the SuR para-
digm. Network-coded interference cancellation can significantly reduce the impact 
of interference by exploiting a priori known interference signals at the receivers. 
Also, novel LI cancellation algorithms are needed to alleviate the HD constraint 
even for relays with lower processing capabilities, such as UE. Also, the feasibil-
ity of fast power adaptation should be examined as it is unrealistic at this point, 
to assume power adaptive transmissions per time slot especially for small channel 
coherence time.
Since UE are expected to be a major cooperative relaying type in future net-
works, D2D communications are a very important research field. Various scenar-
ios are envisioned ranging from simple relaying of data to/from the core network, 
to direct D2D communications without any signalling from the overlay cellular 
network. Mobile providers are increasingly interested in D2D due to improved 
frequency reuse and better off-loading. However, to enable D2D, reliable CSI esti-
mation from the UE is required in order to avoid interference toward other UE 
that communicate with nearby BSs. Furthermore, the incurred power expenditure 
from CSI acquisition and distributed coordination from the UE’s side should be 
addressed by developing low-complexity, low-power techniques.
Another interesting technique relates to energy harvesting of renewable energy 
resources and radio-frequency signals. Depending on the type and capabilities of 
the relays, various levels of energy harvesting efficiency can be achieved. Toward 
this end, relaying algorithms should consider the energy harvesting profile of each 
relay, thus exploiting the potential of each relay type. From the operator’s side BSs 
and infrastructure-based relay with energy harvesting capabilities could reduce the 
OPEX of the network, while lifetime maximization could be achieved for the UE, 
which adopt energy harvesting.
Finally, spectrum bands that were not exploited in previous generation of wire-
less networks are expected to play a significant role in overcoming the spectrum 
crunch of the currently used bands. Recently mm-Wave, free-space optical, and 
visible light bands were considered as possible solutions to increase the capacity of 
the fronthaul and backhaul of wireless networks. However, each band has unique 
characteristics that should be taken into account. Mm-Wave is prone to rain, while 
free-space optical exhibits reduced performance in heavy fog conditions. Thus, 
hybrid backhauling-fronthauling solutions should be developed to overcome such 
difficulties. Last, visible light communications can compliment the other spectrum 
bands and network engineers should harvest its potential by examining scenarios 
where such bands could be employed, for example, in indoor office environments 
where lighting and data transmission are merged.

12.10 Conclusions
In this chapter, the potential of Cooperative Relaying in 5G networks where different 
types of devices may act as relays was investigated. In such networks, the degrading 
role of interference was discussed and possible countermeasures, such as Interference 
Cancellation and Interference Avoidance, to improve network performance were given. 
Moreover, different relaying strategies were presented, such as opportunistic relay 
selection, successive relaying, full-duplex relaying, and buffer-aided relaying and their 
combination, led to the formulation of useful relay selection policies. Furthermore, a 
classification of relays based on their distinct characteristics was provided. In a similar 
manner, the level that each relay device can support different kinds of applications, 
which are of interest in 5G networks, that is, high mobility, delay critical, and Green 
Communications were discussed. Toward this end, three relay selection policies were 
presented targeting to improve the performance of each application. To alleviate pos-
sible practicality concerns, detailed descriptions for centralized and distributed net-
work coordination were provided. To show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, 
numerical results on the throughput, delay and power reduction performance com-
paring different relay types were included. Finally, interesting future directions were 
given as it is believed that the area of CR is open for contributions.

434 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
13.1 Introduction
The rapid evolution of mobile communication networks from simple voice sys-
tems to mobile broadband multimedia systems has significantly increased the spec-
trum demands. The spectral resources are allocated by each government through 
National Regulatory Authorities (NRA), such as the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) in the United States, the Office of Communications (Ofcom) 
in the UK, the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of Europe, and the 
Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) in Europe, 
to the authorized holders such as the network operators. It is widely known, that 
the allocation process is performed under a spectrum auction procedure in most 
cases, based on the command and control model, where the leased radio frequency 
bands are provided for specific usage to the telecommunication companies whose 
monetary offer is larger. Consequently, these companies and more specifically their 
customers are called the officially licensed users of the radio spectrum. However, 
the specific spectrum management method results in the underutilization of the 
frequency bands (Kolodzy et al., 2002) due to the fact that the licensed spectrum 
remains unoccupied for large periods of time or large geographical regions as only 
the authorized users can exploit it. While the aforementioned problem is existent, 
the advent of new communication standards, emerging from the 5th-generation 
(5G) cellular networks, should provide much greater amounts of handheld devices, 
such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, and so on. In addition, 5G is expected to be 
a vertical-driven technology, which will have to satisfy strict requirements for a vast 
range of different use cases. In order to make this possible, much more bandwidth 
is going to be required.
To overcome the contradiction between the low utilization of the spectral 
resources, which is the result of the fixed radio spectrum allocation and the increas-
ing demand for spectral bandwidth, the wireless paradigm of cognitive radio 
 network (CRN) has been proposed as a promising solution (Mitola et al., 1999). 
The CRN concept is an efficient way to take advantage of the underutilized fre-
quency bands and aims at increasing the spectrum utilization compared to the 
static spectrum-management policies. It consists of the licensed owners of the spec-
trum, which are called as primary users (PUs) or incumbent users, and the unli-
censed or cognitive owners, which are called as secondary users (SUs), and coexist 
with the former ones under flexible spectrum allocation approaches. It is noticeable 
that, in general, the applied spectrum sharing techniques are focused on avoiding 
the harmful interference of SUs to the PUs’ transmission, and toward this direction 
some level of cooperation between the PUs and the SUs may be often required.
Combining the aforementioned remarks, the role of cognitive radio technol-
ogy to the emerging 5G wireless communication systems becomes critical. This 
can be explained considering that the main 5G requirements are to support ubiq-
uitous mobility under unprecedented users’ traffic demands and also to provide 
better quality of users’ experience under broadband connectivity at any time, in

any place, and on any device. The 5G technology is investigated as an evolution of 
the existing 2G, 3G, and 4G cellular communication systems to meet the pleth-
ora of the communication challenges, and its employment will start after 2020. 
Simultaneously, the mandatory need for sustainable future wireless networks con-
tains the notions of spectral, energy, and cost efficiency from the operators’ side 
and the scope of 5G systems compared to the current networks is a reduction to 
the aforementioned factors of about 3–5 times, and 100+ times, respectively (Liu 
and Jiang, 2016).
Furthermore, the demanding targets toward the evolution of next-generation 
communication systems are combined with the resource constraints of wireless 
 networks. One major constraint is the spectrum unavailability based on the inef-
ficient spectrum utilization rather than the scarcity of usable natural frequencies 
(FCC Report, 2002). Consequently, the investigation and implementation of 
improved and efficient resource allocation mechanisms to cope with the aforemen-
tioned technical communication challenges become crucial. Toward this direction, 
the main objective of this chapter is a thorough analysis on the important scientific 
aspects related to the radio resource management (RRM) optimization in CRNs 
based on recent literature and also presenting significant RRM optimization results 
for specific architectures and communication systems.
In addition, this chapter presents the main characteristics of cognitive radio tech-
nology and the basic key enablers for the 5G communications indicating that the for-
mer is a promising technology for the challenging 5G era. In addition, the description 
of the RRM’s importance in synchronous wireless networks, such as the CRNs, to 
achieve the strict technical requirements is provided. Moreover, specific research stud-
ies for providing a comprehensive classification of the RRM issue in the CRNs and a 
critical discussion are presented in detail. For completeness of this chapter, other open 
or ongoing research issues of RRM optimization in CRNs are briefly reviewed in the 
Section 13.4. Finally, the chapter concludes with general comments and directions.
13.2 Cognitive Radio Networks
The spectrum access of the unlicensed users is feasible through the exploitation of 
spectrum holes or as called spectrum white spaces, which are licensed frequency 
bands that are allocated but occasionally utilized by the primary users. Moreover, a 
first step toward the practical functionality of CRN would be a possible existence of a 
CR platform to assist the coexistence between the PUs and the SUs. Due to the con-
tinuously time varying environment of the wireless networks, this CR platform must 
be able to sense its environment, by estimating the channel state information (CSI) 
and reconfigure, rapidly, its operating parameters, such as transmission power, fre-
quency band, and modulation scheme, through a cognition process (Haykin, 2005). 
In particular, the cognitive radio is based on the software defined radio (SDR) con-
cept (Jondral, 2005), which is a system that has the ability to operate under different 

436 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
frequency bands, different standards, and various radio access networks and also pro-
vide diversified services with the same RF equipment. To supplement the previously 
mentioned analysis, a fundamental configuration of a cognitive radio system, where 
primary and secondary networks coexist, is presented in Figure 13.1.
Particularly, the SUs are cognitive devices that opportunistically access the 
spectral resources, depending on the access technique that is employed. To support 
efficient dynamic spectrum access (DSA), the cognitive terminals must be able to 
inspect (spectrum sensing) and analyze the spectrum status (spectrum manage-
ment) with a view to finding and accessing the spectrum holes. At the same time, 
they have to take into consideration not only the coexistence with other cognitive 
devices (spectrum sharing), but also the necessity to change their operating fre-
quency band in case of PU’s transmission (spectrum mobility).
More specifically, in the phase of spectrum sensing the CR systems detect the 
spectrum usage and the transmission of the PUs and obtain crucial information for 
various parameters such as location, frequency band, transmission time, and power. 
Furthermore, the SUs can sense the spectrum on their selves (without any coop-
eration with the other SUs), using three main detectors that are the matched filter 
detector, the energy detector, and the cyclostationary feature detector. These detec-
tors are based on the PU’s signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that is detected by a SU or 
under cooperation with other SUs. In particular, the matched filter detector, which 
is complicated, requires knowledge of primary’s signal characteristics to compare 
the SU’s received signal with the corresponding PU’s known signal. On the other 
hand, the energy detector, whose detection is based on the energy of primary signal, 
is more simple and useful when the knowledge of PU’s signal is absent. Finally, the 
cyclostationary feature detector detects PU by exploiting the statistics and mainly 
the periodicity in the pattern of the PU’s transmission signals.
The case that SU receives the PU’s signal with a SNR under an acceptable 
threshold, based on deep fading phenomena, makes the detection of the primary 
transmission by the SU infeasible. Hence, the SUs’ cooperation is proposed as an 
PU network

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 437
ideal solution. The cooperative sensing is applied either in a centralized manner 
where a central controller, like a secondary base station, collects and exchanges 
the information with the SUs, or in a distributed manner where the SUs coexist 
in a  without-infrastructure network and share their information with other SUs. 
Finally, even though the SUs acquire spectrum to transmit, it is crucial not to cause 
harmful interference to the PUs, which is guaranteed by the interference tempera-
ture limit that is established by the FCC (FCC Report, 2003). This metric reflects 
the total power that is received by the PU and generated by the noise sources and 
other emitters of the surrounding radio environment. In most cases, SU is obliged 
to change its transmission characteristics in order not to exceed this interference 
temperature limit.
During the spectrum-management phase, the obtained information by the 
spectrum sensing phase is analyzed and the SUs choose the appropriate spectrum 
for their transmission. Then, in the spectrum sharing phase, in contrast to the static 
spectrum allocation mechanism, the SUs exploit the provided frequency bands 
under a dynamic spectrum access. Following this dynamic process the SUs must 
continuously reconfigure their operation parameters in response to the changing 
environment and this mechanism ameliorates the system spectral efficiency. The 
DSA approach, as presented in Figure 13.2, is classified to the dynamic exclusive 
use model, open sharing model or spectrum commons model, and the hierarchical

access model (Zhao et al., 2007). The dynamic exclusive use model is separated in 
the dynamic spectrum allocation and the property rights approaches. The former 
ameliorates the spectrum efficiency through the exploitation of the spatial and tem-
poral traffic statistics of different services (Xu et al., 2000), while in the latter, the 
PUs are considered to own the spectral resources and to cooperate with the SUs 
to ameliorate their performance by leasing a part of their licensed spectrum to the 
cognitive users.
While in the open sharing model, which is applied in the unlicensed industrial, 
scientific and medical (ISM) band, all the users have equal rights in the exploita-
tion of the spectrum, in the hierarchical access model, the licensed spectrum is 
shared with the unlicensed users while guaranteeing that the latter do not harm the 
primary transmission. Moreover, the aforementioned spectrum sharing is classified 
in three techniques, called as interweave, underlay, or overlay (Goldsmith et al., 
2009). More specifically, in the interweave technique the SU can transmit its data 
only with the absence of PU’s transmission whereas in the underlay technique, the 
SU can simultaneously transmit with the PU as long as the caused interference to 
the primary receiver is below an acceptable threshold. Finally, according to the 
overlay technique, the SU acts as a relay for the PU and assists the latter’s transmis-
sion in order to acquire time for its own (secondary) transmission. In this case the 
cooperative protocols that are mostly employed are the amplify-and-forward (AF) 
protocol, the decode-and-forward (DF) protocol, and the compress-and-forward 
(CF) protocol (Laneman et al., 2004).
Furthermore, except from the DSA approach, there are two other methods 
that supplement the analysis of the spectrum sharing phase and are based on the 
 network’s architecture and the SUs’ access behavior (Akyildiz et al., 2006). On one 
hand, according to the network’s architecture, the SUs access the spectrum under 
a centralized or a distributed manner. In the first approach the centralized entity 
controls and manages the spectrum allocation and the cognitive users’ access, while 
in the distributed manner, which is deployed in a network without infrastructure 
(ad-hoc), each SU decides alone for the access technique depending on local infor-
mation. On the other hand, the SUs’ access behavior includes either the coopera-
tion with the other SUs or the selfishness. The cooperative spectrum sharing deals 
with the joint communication of the unlicensed users, which possibly belong to the 
same service provider and maximize their system’s performance under a common 
target. On the other side, in the noncooperative spectrum sharing each SU wants 
to satisfy its own benefits which are possibly in contradiction with the other users’ 
benefits. In Figure 13.2, a brief block diagram about the basic concepts of CR 
spectral functionalities is presented, summarizing all that was previously discussed 
about the operation of cognitive networks.
The CR’s standardization process is based on the actions of the IEEE 802.22 
and IEEE Standard Coordinating Committee 41 (SCC41), which are the major 
counterparts of the CR standard (Hossain et al., 2015). The IEEE 802.22 working 

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 439
group on wireless regional area networks (WRANs) was formed in October 2004 
and investigated the operation in the unused spectrum allocated to the TV broad-
cast service using the CR technology. Exploiting the CR’s characteristics, the IEEE 
802.22 WRANs standard targeted to guaranteeing nonharmful interference to the 
incumbent operation, such as digital TV and analog TV broadcasting and low 
power licensed devices like wireless microphones (Stevenson et al., 2009). In paral-
lel, the IEEE SCC 41, whose ancestor was the IEEE P1900 established in March 
2005, was renamed to IEEE DYSPAN-SC in 2010 and occupied with developing 
standards related to dynamic spectrum access networks for CR standardization 
(Murroni et al., 2011).
The CR protocol stack configuration is inevitable for the implementation of 
cognitive radio theory in the wireless networks. This protocol stack consists of the 
physical layer (PHY) component, the medium access control (MAC), network, 
transport, and application layers (Hossain et al., 2015). The first one includes the 
SDR module for the transmission and the reception of the signals while the other 
layers are implemented by adaptive protocols that take into consideration the 
changes in the environment. These layers are interconnected under a CR control 
named CR orchestration level that exploits appropriate algorithms to manage, effi-
ciently, the information among these layers.
The security issue in the CRNs’ functionality is crucial. The characteristics of 
the surrounding environment are subjective to various security attacks in multiple 
ways. Some of them are the denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, selfish (without con-
sidering the others SUs’ demands and the utilized MAC protocol) and malicious 
users, which are either eavesdroppers (overhearing in the private transmitted data 
by other SUs or PUs), or jammers (causing intentional interference to other users 
and degrading their signals), preventing the normal operation among the PUs 
and SUs. Methods for diminishing these attacks consist of punishment mecha-
nisms, such as bad reputation and authentication techniques by identifying the 
users. Moreover, due to the nature of CR spectrum access, they are also vulnerable 
to CNR-specific attacks like PU emulation attacks and spectrum sensing data 
falsification.
The advantages, if the CR concept starts to function, are obvious based on the 
scientific literature, which presents their wide application to many fields such as 
public safety, broadband cellular, and medical applications (Wang et al., 2011). On 
the one hand the police, fire, emergency medical, and public safety services must 
have reliable communications for every emergency scenario and on the other hand 
the quick access of the citizens to aforementioned services is essential. Due to the 
congested radio frequencies attached to public safety, the CRNs’ usage becomes a 
promising tool for ensuring the communication reliability to a broader range of the 
radio spectrum. Furthermore, the CR technology expands the cellular networks 
not only by exploiting the television white spaces (TVWS) which provides more 
available spectrum to cellular operators for broadband applications, but also with 

440 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
offloading the traffic data generated in overloaded hotspots to the additional spec-
trum. Moreover, the unlicensed use of white spaces decreases the cellular operators’ 
backhaul connection cost and increases the ability for nationwide coverage by ame-
liorating the rural areas’ coverage. Finally, the CR’s spectral flexibility is significant 
to the wireless medical networks due to their requirement for high quality of service 
(QoS), clean and less crowded spectrum band.

The recent literature, such as in Boccardi et al. (2014), studies the transition from 
the cell-centric architectures to device-centric architectures as a possible technology 
direction toward the 5G implementation. Especially, in the cell-centric architec-

the network, while in the device-centric architectures the smart devices communi-
cate, exchange the information of their surrounding environment, and adjust their 
communication parameters properly based on their interconnection. Thus, the 
functionalities of the network come closer to the end-users. To have a much more 
realistic vision for the technical challenges of 5G networks, Table 13.1 summarizes 
the performance indicators and the corresponding international mobile telecom-
munications (IMT) requirements for the IMT-Advanced (4G) and IMT-2020 as 
modified by scientific research in (ITU-R M.2083, 2015). While these values may 
further be developed in new versions of ITU-R recommendations based on future 
investigation, they reveal the real targets of the performance indicators in future 
wireless networks.
13.3.2 Key Technologies for 5G Networks
The 5G cellular networks become realistic and promising through some key tech-
nologies, which are briefly described in the analysis here. These can be applied to 
the physical, MAC, network, and application layers, and they are also connected 
to the CR concept. More specifically, in the physical layer domain the major tech-
nology enablers are the employment of small cells and their densification, the 
flexible spectrum management including the millimeter wave (mm-Wave) wire-
less  channels, the large scale antenna systems or Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-
Output (Massive MIMO) and the full duplex radio technology, which is capable 
to double the spectrum efficiency of existing communication systems due to the 
nodes’ ability to simultaneously transmit and receive in the same frequency band. 
Moreover, in MAC layer, new radio multiplexing techniques are proposed such as 
Filtered Bank Multicarrier (FBMC), generalized frequency division multiplexing 
(GFDM), Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA), and Interleave Division Multiple 
Access (IDMA) (Agiwal et al., 2016). Furthermore, in the core network the cloud 
radio access network (C-RAN), software defined network (SDN), and network 
function virtualization (NFV) are significant enablers for the upcoming 5G cellular 
systems and proposed as capital and operating expenditures reduction techniques 
for the operators. Finally, many applications that have been investigated under the 
4G framework will be supported by the 5G wireless standard and the most impor-
tant of them are the device-to-device (D2D) systems, vehicular communications, 
including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), machine-
to-machine (M2M) systems, wearable devices, and Internet of things (IoT).
Due to the general consensus that a large increase in area traffic capacity is inev-
itable for the future communication systems, many recent works, such as Andrews 
et al. (2014), demonstrate that the extreme densification of the networks, called as 
ultra-dense networks (UDNs), consists an efficient way to achieve this technical 
challenge (Gotsis et al., 2017). In UDNs, the cell density is increased and becomes 
similar to the corresponding users’ density. Moreover, the UDNs, including scenar-
ios such as dense urban areas, stadium, campus, and apartments, are based on the 

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 443
heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The HetNets contain small cells of different 
size, like micro-, pico- and femto-cells, with different low transmission power levels 
coexisting under the macro-cell deployment. There are many benefits under the 
UDN configuration such as the coverage extension to the coverage holes, improve-
ment of the spectral reuse, traffic offloading in the hotspot areas, and amelioration 
of the energy efficiency by bringing the network closer to the users. Besides the 
aforementioned advantages many challenges like the interference, the users’ mobil-
ity, and the signaling overhead of CSI information exchanged among the nodes 
require further investigation.
Another promising technique toward the implementation of 5G mobile net-
works is the usage of the mm-Wave frequencies. The operation of the 5G systems 
is investigated under a unified air-interface framework employing frequency bands 
at lower and higher frequencies (Liu and Jiang, 2016). Especially, the necessity 
for more bandwidth that exists in the band of 20–300 GHz in combination with 
the congestion of the below 3 GHz or beachfront spectrum (Andrews et al., 2014) 
pushes the research to the mm-Wave frequency regime. In the mm-Wave bands the 
propagation environment is really challenging in terms of strong path and foliage 
loss attenuation, blockage vulnerability by moving obstacles, atmospheric attenua-
tion (especially rain attenuation), and high penetration loss through the buildings 
(Rappaport et al., 2013; Kourogiorgas et al., 2015). The joint consideration of spec-
tral and propagation characteristics of the high frequency bands makes mm-Waves 
reliable for high-data rates and line-of-sight (LOS) propagation in small cells, while 
the low frequency bands provide seamless coverage. Thus, it is easily concluded that 
the flexible usage of low and high frequency bands based on the communication 
environment is of utmost importance in future networks. Finally, another benefit 
of the mm-Wave frequencies is the consideration that these frequencies are reliable 
for self-backhauling through the highly directed beams transmitted by the corre-
sponding array antennas.
The exploitation of the mm-Wave frequency bands paves the way to the 
Massive MIMO systems through the decrease of antennas’ size, the decrease in 
their separation and the increase in the mm-Wave beams’ directivity. The afore-
mentioned characteristics enable each BS, or even the users, to be equipped with 
array antennas including tens or even hundreds of antenna elements, while the 
today’s state-of-the-art systems, like LTE-A and 802.11ac, support up to 8 anten-
nas per access node. The array antennas provide significant coverage, capacity, 
and resources reuse benefits due to the usage of the available spatial degrees of 
freedom.
As it has been already mentioned, many applications are considered as can-
didate technologies for the implementation of 5G communications. More spe-
cifically, the D2D systems contain mobile devices that communicate directly in 
short range without the assistance of the BSs and are deployed either on cellular 
spectrum, called as in-band D2D communication, or on unlicensed spectrum, 
called as out-band D2D communication (Asadi et al., 2014). The D2D concept 

444 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
targets to ameliorate the area traffic capacity, the spectrum efficiency, the cover-
age and offloading the backhaul. In a larger scale, M2M systems include huge 
amount of connected devices like smart grid components, metering, and sen-
sors, whose communication requires high-data rate, very high link reliability, 
low latency, and real-time operation along with wide-coverage areas (Boccardi 
et al., 2014). The aforementioned characteristics are crucial in vehicular commu-
nications where the data for the traffic safety must be transmitted within a given 
time interval. Another important application within the future 5G infrastruc-
ture is the systems of wearable devices where the patients’ health is monitored 
based on a body area network (BAN) and the recorded signals are transmitted 
in real time by sensors via gateways to a central server making available a more 
personal health care. However, collecting data in real time is bandwidth limited 
and the 5G wireless concept is a promising solution to this constraint (Oleshchuk 
et al., 2011). Finally, across the evolution to the 5G systems, the IoT concept 
gains large scientific and industrial interest intending to massive, ubiquitous, 
simultaneous wired and wireless internet connections of heterogeneous things 
with different intelligence, complexity, transmission power, energy and latency 
requirements (ITU-R M.2083, 2015), either in small scale like  smartphones, 
sensors, cameras, and vehicles, or in large scale as smart grids, homes, industries, 
and agriculture.
13.3.3 Cognitive Radio’s Role in 5G Systems
The importance of CR in the emerging 5G technology is apparent through the 
recent literature like Zhang et al. (2015b), Agiwal et al. (2016), Yang et al. (2016), 
and Panwar et al. (2016). More specifically, based on the major CRN’s remarks 
of the aforementioned literature, the intelligent features of the CR devices such 
as the interaction with the environment, the cognition property, and the self-
reconfiguration make them possible appropriate candidate equipment for the 5G 
terminals. Moreover, the tight relation between the 5G and CR technologies is 
strengthened by a plethora of similarities such as the ability to support differ-
ent systems and networks, to contain new and flexible protocols, very advanced 
physical and MAC technologies, and an end-to-end integrated resource man-
agement that should include all the networks involved in the data-transmission 
process (Badoi et al., 2011).
Furthermore, according to Hong et al. (2014) the application of CR technology 
in a cellular system aids the latter to cope with the exploding and diverse mobile 
data traffic by expanding its operation from the licensed band with fixed, limited 
bandwidth to underutilized frequency bands without causing harmful interference 
to the incumbents, the licensed owners of these frequency bands. The low cost of 
leasing this opportunistic and unreliable spectrum, in comparison with purchasing 
a licensed band, renders the cognitive cellular networks a promising communica-
tion framework for the 5G mobile communication systems.

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 445
The importance of CR concept, primarily based on flexible spectrum man-
agement, has been widely investigated for many key technologies that are cru-
cial for the 5G networks as the following indicative recent works prove. In Yang 
et al. (2016), the advanced spectrum sharing technique under technical and eco-
nomical perspectives is investigated in 5G cognitive HetNets and a spectrum flow 
scheme, which implements both cooperative capacity offload and spectrum leas-
ing, is proposed resulting in spectral and energy efficiency. The basic drawbacks 
of the current CR spectrum sensing mechanism through its application to 5G 
networks are given to Zhang et al. (2015b). Particularly, in the 5G framework the 
spectrum sensing equipment results in SUs’ high cost and design complexity as 
well as in its additional energy consumption and waste of resources. Consequently, 
a new spectrum sharing scheme for the application of CR in 5G concept is pro-
posed, whose main idea is based on removing the cognitive capability from SUs 
and let a new communication entity (a spectrum agent) perform spectrum sens-
ing. This spectrum sharing mechanism targets to reduce the energy consumption 
and wasting of resources at the user terminal and ultimately improves the overall 
spectrum efficiency.
The CR technology has also been investigated under the UDN framework in 
Tseng et al. (2015) and Obregon et al. (2014). While in Tseng et al. (2015), graph- 
and genetic-based approaches are proposed in order to maximize users’ through-
put by minimizing the crucial for UDNs communication interference, in Obregon 
et al. (2014), the spectrum sharing between UDNs and radar systems, which have 
the role of SU and PU, respectively, is examined. More specifically, the scope is to 
analyze regulatory policies to ameliorate sharing conditions for indoor and outdoor 
UDNs operating at the S- and Ku-radar bands. Furthermore, CR applications to 
D2D systems are examined in Liu et al. (2016) and Cheng et al. (2012). In former, 
the secure D2D communication in energy harvesting large-scale cognitive cellular 
networks is investigated, where the energy-constrained D2D transmitter harvests 
energy from multiantenna equipped power beacons and communicates with the 
corresponding receiver using the spectrum of the primary base stations. Moreover, 
in Cheng et al. (2012), the CR and D2D communications are combined in cellular 
networks. Specifically, PUs can normally transmit via BS, while SUs can transmit 
either via BS or via D2D communication and the SUs’ behaviors are analyzed using 
evolutionary game theory.
Another significant role of CR toward the implementation of 5G vision is its 
employment to vehicular communications that are an important part of the intel-
ligent transportation systems (ITS). Especially, in Atallah et al. (2015) the usage 
of CR is investigated for further spectrum allocation to cope with the plethora 
of vehicular networking applications, such as traffic monitoring and collision-
avoidance and in Mumtaz et al. (2015), a CR-based resource allocation policy is 
proposed to exploit white spaces as a mean of further offloading vehicular users. 
Finally, applications of CR have been also investigated in M2M communications. 
Specifically, in Aijaz et al. (2015), a cognitive M2M protocol stack is described for 

446 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
employment to IoT, while in Tragos and Angelakis (2013) the energy efficiency aspect 
is introduced to the CR’s function and the CR-inspired smart objects (CRSOs) are 
proposed as high-energy efficiency solutions to the M2M systems due to their abil-
ity to adapt to environmental conditions.
As previously discussed, Massive MIMO technique is one of the key enablers 
for 5G technology. However, there are very recent works, such as Wang et al. (2015) 
and Barnes et al. (2015), that treat with the combination of Massive MIMO and 
CR systems. Particularly, in Wang et al. (2015) an underlay CR system, which 
includes a multiuser Massive MIMO primary network and a multiple-input 
 single-output (MISO) secondary network, is studied and a tight lower bound of 
the average achievable rate, which can be used to measure the performance for 
any finite numbers of antennas, is derived. Moreover, in Barnes et al. (2015) the 
authors investigate a CRN whose secondary base station (SBS) is equipped with 
Massive MIMO systems and there is cooperation between this SBS located in a 
microcell with a corresponding relay station in a femtocell, under the deployment 
of a primary base station. The scope of this work is the maximization of the energy 
efficiency of the overall CRN while satisfying the QoS requirement of each SU 
given specific interference constraint for each PU.
Across the evolution to 5G, the tremendous increase of traffic load, arising 
from the greater number of both active users and access nodes, makes inevitable 
the appropriate redesign of the current backhaul links due to the fact that their 
static design is useless based on the mutable operation dynamics. Except from the 
technologies like copper, optical fiber, satellite links, micro, and mm-Waves, the 
CR consists an equivalent powerful technology proposed for backhaul connec-
tion providing low energy consumption. More specifically, in Lun et al. (2014) a 
cognitive energy efficient backhaul deployment scheme, implementing the rein-
forcement learning theory, is investigated based on the backhaul link diversity 
where the system’s base stations are able to connect to different available backhaul 
links that are selected according to different selection schemes and QoS con-
straints. Finally, toward the direction to the software-driven networks in Ziegler 
et  al. (2015), the Cognitive and Cloud-Optimized Network Evolution (CONE) 
end-to-end architecture is deployed including both 5G access domain and 5G era 
horizontal layers under cloud, software-defined, and cognitive networks frame-
work. The CR characteristics, such as real-time collection of networks and usage 
data, associated analysis and automated proactive action, enable the automated, 
optimized network operation and the automated management of the resources in 
5G systems.
The previous brief survey in the recent literature reveals the critical role of CR 
to the future wireless communication ecosystems, like the 5G. It is obvious that 
CR significantly benefits the 5G configuration. The high degree of interconnec-
tion among 5G and CR is demonstrated in the following Figure 13.3, which sum-
marizes the relationship of these innovative concepts toward the direction of the 
promising IoT.

13.4  Radio Resources Management in Cognitive 
Radio Networks
Due to the crucial impact on the performance of the wireless systems, the appro-
priate exploitation of the radio resources has been investigated in CRNs under 
the framework of various mathematical theories. In this section, a promising 
research field known as RRM optimization is discussed. First, to understand the 
general optimization framework, details of the optimization objective functions 
are given presenting basic characteristics of the utility theory. The utility func-
tions are the core of the problems’ optimization structure on which the RRM 
techniques are deployed. Subsequently, some of the most basic concepts of RRM 
in the CRNs, widely met in scientific literature, are described. The issues con-
nected to the RRM field include problems referring to the power control, the 
channel allocation (i.e., a bandwidth portion around a central frequency), the 
time allocation to each user of the CRN called as scheduling or partitioning, 
and the efficient users’ pairing whose careful examination is inevitable to ensure 
the amelioration of PUs’ and SUs’ performance under multiple requirements and 
different incentives.

13.4.1 Basic Utility Theory
The cognitive RRM (CRRM) field targets to the appropriate allocation of CRN’s 
radio resources based on the users’ preferences modeled by functions that come 
from the utility theory, which has been greatly applied in economics. In particu-
lar, the utility quantifies the users’ objectives, acquiring greater value as the latter 
approach their goals and including either one or more performance metrics. Under 
the CR framework, the utility function can capture some of the most important 
network performance metrics (figures of merits) such as the capacity (e.g., ergodic, 
outage, effective, and secrecy capacity), the energy efficiency, and the spectral effi-
ciency. In the following analysis, some significant scientific works are described to 
highlight the methodologies that are applied to the CRRM framework.
Especially, ergodic capacity is determined as the average Shannon capacity over 
all the fading wireless channels (block fading channels), which are mostly charac-
terized by fast fading phenomena. On the contrary, in case the channels face slow 
fading phenomena, the outage capacity is employed (Ozarow et al., 1994), denoting 
the maximum achievable constant rate that can be maintained over fading blocks 
under a specific outage probability. Both ergodic and outage capacity concepts are 
investigated, from the perspective of the SUs, under the spectrum sharing pro-
cess in Kang et al. (2009). Furthermore, optimal power allocation schemes are 
proposed to maximize the corresponding capacity, for different fading channels 
statistics subject to peak/average transmit and/or peak/average interference power 
constraints. In this case, a capacity gain for the SU is noted considering the average 
interference power constraints compared to the corresponding peak constraints.
The theory of effective capacity has been developed to deal with the challenge 
of modern communication systems to provide higher QoS level for the wireless 
applications. This performance metric is defined as the maximum constant arrival 
rate that can be supported by the channel to guarantee a QoS requirement and 
is particularly convenient for analyzing the statistical QoS performance of wire-
less transmissions where the service process is driven by the time varying wireless 
channel (Wu et al., 2003). Two paradigms of the effective capacity application 
in the CRN framework are presented in Vassaki et al. (2014) and Roumeliotis 
et al. (2016). In particular, the former work investigates the optimization of effec-
tive capacity, using the convex optimization theory, from the SU’s perspective in 
an underlay cognitive network where the power allocation mechanism allows the 
SU’s transmission with maximum power when the PU experiences an outage event 
due to the randomness in its channel state. Moreover, except from the traditional 
interference power constraint, an interference constraint, which is based on the 
inverse signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR) of the primary receiver, is 
investigated and the simulation results reveal that this specific constraint benefits 
the SU and leads to lower values of PU’s outage capacity. Regarding the work in 
Roumeliotis et al. (2016), the authors study the maximization of PU’s effective 
capacity under the overlay approach in a Gaussian orthogonal relay model and a 

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 449
time allocation mechanism is proposed, using the convex optimization theory, con-
sidering, jointly, the satisfaction of the minimum SU’s effective capacity and the 
maximum SU’s instantaneous power. The simulation results show the amelioration 
of PU’s effective capacity as the SU’s effective capacity or SU’s QoS requirement 
take lower values.
Furthermore, due to the nature of CRNs, the physical layer security plays a crit-
ical role for the protection of PUs and SUs, which are vulnerable to various attack-
ers such as eavesdroppers (E) and jammers. The secrecy capacity concept (Wyner, 
1975) is defined as the maximum rate at which the information can be securely 
transmitted from the source (S) to the corresponding destination (D). Formally, for 
a Gaussian channel, secrecy capacity is expressed as the difference of the Shannon 
capacity of the SD link, called as the main link, and the Shannon capacity of the 
SE link, called as the wiretap link. In Figure 13.4, the basic configuration of a 
primary network (PT–PR pair) with a helper relay (R), which enhances the PT’s 
secure transmission and an eavesdropper, is depicted according to the aforemen-
tioned notions.
During the past years, secrecy capacity has been applied extensively in wireless 
networks (Poulakis et al., 2016) and particularly in CRNs (Zou et al., 2014). In 
the latter work, a multiuser multieavesdropper CR system with multiple cognitive 
users (CUs) transmitting to a common cognitive base station (CBS) is considered, 
while multiple eavesdroppers act cooperatively or independently in intercepting the 
CUs–CBS transmissions, called as coordinated and uncoordinated eavesdroppers, 
respectively. Furthermore, the secrecy outage and diversity performance of this sys-
tem are studied and closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability, for 
both coordinated and uncoordinated cases, are derived according to various sched-
uling schemes, such as the round robin scheme, the optimal user scheme (i.e., the 
CSI of all links is available), and the suboptimal user scheme (i.e., only the CSI of 
Wiretap links

450 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
CUs–CBS links is known). Another noticeable remark is the secrecy diversity order 
of M, where M is the number of CUs, for both optimal and suboptimal schedul-
ing, while the round robin scheduling achieves order of only one. To conclude, all 
the scheduling schemes are improved as the maximum allowable interference level 
increases and the round robin scheduling has the worst performance with respect 
to the secrecy outage probability.
Finally, the technical challenges of wireless communications render substantial 
optimization of efficiency metrics, such as the EE and the spectral efficiency (SE), 
which are defined as the ratio of the rate over the power. More specifically, the 
maximization of EE constitutes a problem with significant impact on CR systems, 
which is apparent through Haider et al. (2015) and Naeem et al. (2013). Especially, 
in Haider et al. (2015), an interference-tolerant CRN is investigated across the 
spectral and energy efficiency trade-off, given specific power and interference con-
straints. While in the low SNR regime, the EE is better when the signal is transmit-
ted with average power constraint, in the high SNR regime peak or average power 
constraints lead to similar EE. Moreover, in Naeem et al. (2013), an optimal power 
allocation policy under a fractional programming approach is derived to maximize 
the EE of the SUs’ transmissions in a multiuser green CR, while guaranteeing the 
interference constraints due to the PUs’ existence. The authors note that the EE 
increases with the number of SUs and decreases with the increase in number of PUs 
as the optimization problem becomes stricter.
13.4.2 Optimization Approaches
There are multiple criteria for the classification of the optimization problems associ-
ated with the type of objective and constraint functions. The widest category is the 
one of nonlinear problems whose subcategory is the convex problems. Moreover, 
the optimization problems are separated into continuous and discrete based on 
the kind of described problem, while a critical mathematic tool for discrete prob-
lems’ solution is the integer programming. All the aforementioned categories are 
related with the construction of the optimization problem. This problem includes 
the maximization or minimization of an objective function, which may be a utility 
function, by determining the appropriate values of the optimization variables under 
specific constraint functions. According to the problem’s complexity, the optimal 
solution can be derived in a closed-form expression or approximately through a 
heuristic approach. Especially, the linear optimization problems require  polynomial 
time (P) to find the solution, while the integer optimization problems have larger 
complexity and belong to the nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) problems 
requiring various relaxation techniques to be approximately solved.
More specifically, convex optimization theory is a greatly applied theory guaran-
teeing that if a local minimum exists, this is also the global minimum. Considering 
that bold indexing in all equations provided next refers to vertices or matrices, the 
problems’ structure is defined as (Boyd et al., 2004):

The characterization of an optimization problem as convex includes not only the 
satisfaction of convexity properties for the objective function (i.e., fo

the functions of inequality constraint (i.e., fi

work of convex optimization theory in CRNs is described in Wang and Liu 
(2015) where the time allocation problem to optimize the SU’s effective capac-
ity is studied under a specific PU’s effective capacity constraint and constant 
SU’s power level. Furthermore, the comparison between an optimal time-slot 
allocation scheme, considering both the channel conditions and PU’s delay 
QoS requirement, and a fixed time-slot allocation scheme, which only varies 
with PU’s delay QoS requirement, reveals the superiority of the first scheme 
through the simulation results.
Another class of convex optimization problems is the second order cone pro-
grams (SOCP) that involves conic expressions under continuous optimization vari-
ables and its formal structure is (Boyd et al., 2004):

 is called as second-order cone 
constraint due to the inequality between a norm and an affine expression. An 
example for the implementation of SOCP in CR framework is described in Liu 
et al. (2011). A robust downlink beam forming method with power control under a 
multiuser MISO CRN is investigated for minimizing the SUs’ transmit power while 
targeting to a lower bound on the SUs’ received SINR and imposing an upper limit 
on the interference power at the PUs. The simulation results show that the proposed 
method has better performance than a nonrobust method with respect to channel 
changes.

452 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
To extend the applications of optimization theory, some fundamentals of non-
convex optimization theory based on the difference of two convex functions (DC) 
are presented. This objective function formulation aims at coping with the RRM 
problems in nonconvex wireless networks generally, for example, in Poulakis et al. 
(2016) and more specifically in CRNs such as in Alvarado et al. (2014). The latter 
work involves an indicative usage of DC programming to find the SUs’ transmis-
sion power levels for their sum-rate maximization over an underlay CR MIMO 
network subject to interference constraints for PUs’ protection. The proposed dis-
tributed algorithm is comparable with a centralized scheme according to their per-
formance. Furthermore, another optimization method with many applications in 
CRRM, such as in Naeem et al. (2013) that has been descripted in Section 13.4.1, 
is the fractional programming where the objective function is formulated as the 
ratio of two functions that contain the optimization variable.
In the CRRM field, there are many optimization problems whose optimiza-
tion variables take integer values. If all the optimization variables require integer 
values then the optimization model is called as integer programming (IP) model. 
On the other hand, the optimization model is known as mixed integer program-
ming (MIP) model when certain optimization variables take integer values while 
other take real values. Subsequently, if the objective and constraint functions are 
both linear then the optimization problem is known as ILP or MILP, depending 
on which category (IP or MIP, respectively) it belongs. Furthermore, the integer 
programming is strongly related with combinatorial optimization problems, which 
study all the possible combinations of network’s radio resources to select the best 
combination in order to ameliorate the network performance. A paradigm of MILP 
in CRRM framework is examined by Hoang et al. (2006) where a CRN with mul-
tiple cells that include a base station supporting cognitive users is considered. The 
authors investigate channel-allocation/power-control schemes that maximize the 
spectrum utilization of the CRN, under opportunistic spectrum access, while min-
imizing the interference to PUs. Due to the NP-hard complexity of MILP problem, 
a heuristic solution is proposed based on the dynamic interference graph theory and 
the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of the overall number of network’s 
served users is obvious through the comparison with other literature’s algorithms.
The optimization techniques in CRRM also include the dynamic programming 
(DP), which treats with the solution of a complex problem through the solution of a 
collection of simpler subproblems appropriately combining these series of solutions 
to give the best one for the given problem. This optimization method has a great 
usage in the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which provides a mathematical 
framework for modeling decision making in situations where the decision maker 
can partly control the outcome due to stochastic conditions. The MDP is char-
acterized by the Markov property, which means that the conditional probability 
distribution of future states of the process depends only on the current state, not on 
the sequence of events that preexisted. A CRN’s dynamic programming scenario is 
investigated in Yu et al. (2016) under a QoS differential transmission scheduling 

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 453
problem in the CR-based smart grid communications networks. The different QoS 
requirements of smart grid users (SGUs) are associated with the different priori-
ties of SGUs in the smart grid. The scheduler allocates the channels, based on the 
proposed priority policy, considering the minimum transmission delay of SGUs 
under a semi-MDP approach with infinite stages and solved by the methodology 
of adaptive DP. In conclusion, the proposed priority mechanism guarantees low 
transmission delay for high-priority SGSUs and in the case of emergency data the 
transmission delay decreases to a satisfying low level for all users ensuring the dif-
ferential QoS provision in the smart grid.
Finally, the stochastic programming consists of another optimization theory 
involving the uncertainty, which is characterized by a probability distribution on 
the parameters into the objective and the constraint functions. This uncertainty 
leads to the randomness of the solutions and the optimal objective value of the 
optimization problem. A widely known approach to cope with the stochastic pro-
gramming is called as two-stage recourse model. In the first stage, the decision 
entity makes a decision which is influenced by some uncertainty and in the second 
stage this entity makes another decision, called as recourse decision, in response to 
the random event preceded. The recourse decisions target to the best correction of 
first stage decisions through the minimization of the expected costs of all decisions 
taken with respect to each random outcome. In work of Almalfouh et al. (2012) a 
problem of joint spectrum-sensing-duration design and power control in a point-
to-point CR link under the stochastic programming is investigated. This problem 
is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program with recourse in order to maximize 
the CR achievable throughput subject to specific PU’s interference constraint. The 
simulation results reveal that, under perfectly known CSI, the throughput achieves 
the highest values and shorter value of sensing duration is required for a given PU’s 
interference constraint, while longer sensing duration is required as the PU’s allow-
able interference becomes stricter.
13.4.3 Game Theory
It is widely known that users’ decisions on their function parameters and spectrum 
usage are influenced not only by the environment, but also by the other users’ 
actions, due to the coexistence between the PUs and SUs under the CRN frame-
work. These users act cooperatively or selfishly according to their incentives, and 
their multiple interactions can be analyzed in a game structure, through the math-
ematical tool of game theory. The formal game’s definition includes the set of play-
ers, that is, PUs and SUs, the action space, that is, the set of strategies and users’ 
utility/payoff, which describes the result of the game for each user. Applications of 
game theory in various OSI layers in wireless networks can be found in Charilas 
and Panagopoulos (2010a). The multifold application of game theory in CRNs 
(Wang et al., 2010) contains games based on multiple categories such as the users’ 
noncooperation, for example, potential games; users’ cooperation, for example, 

454 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
bargain and coalitional games; economic games, for example, Cournot, Bertrand, 
and Stackelberg games discussed in Wang et al. (2010) and Yu (2013); auction 
games and games based on mechanism design.
In noncooperative games, where each user acts selfishly in order to achieve its 
goals, the Nash equilibrium (NE) is the solution concept. The notion of NE con-
tains the actions’ and utilities’ sets of each user at a specific point where no user 
can benefit by changing them, while the other users keep their corresponding sets 
unchanged. Due to the difficulty in proving game’s convergence to NE, differ-
ent special structures of noncooperative games, for example, potential games, have 
been investigated that guarantee the existence of NE. Potential games are met in 
CRRM field such as in Zhong et al. (2014). The authors study the joint relay selec-
tion and discrete power control problem in a relay CRN for maximizing the rate 
of the secondary system given the interference power constraint at the primary 
receivers and the total available power constraint for the secondary relays. The lat-
ter are regarded as the game players and the power levels are the pure strategies for 
each SU. In addition, the utilities, based on SUs’ rate, power, and penalty func-
tions, ensure the feasibility of the network without advance knowledge of feasible 
power strategy profiles. Furthermore, it is proven that the proposed game not only 
has at least one feasible pure strategy NE, but also an optimal solution to the rate 
maximization problem constitutes a feasible pure strategy NE. Finally, a central-
ized iterative algorithm, based on best response dynamic, and decentralized algo-
rithm, based on learning automata, are proposed, and the simulation results reveal 
that both algorithms have less complexity than an exhaustive search algorithm and 
can achieve optimal or near-optimal performance.
Besides the users’ selfishness in noncooperative games, in cooperative games, 
largely applied in CRRM such as in Zhang et al. (2015a) and Li et al. (2010), the 
users’ cooperation is investigated. In the first work the cooperative Nash bargaining 
game theory is analyzed in cognitive small cells through a joint uplink sub-channel 
and power allocation problem considering the cross-tier interference mitigation, min-
imum outage probability requirement, imperfect CSI and minimum rate require-
ment. The existence, uniqueness, and fairness of the solution to the aforementioned 
game are proved and the proposed Nash bargaining resource allocation mechanism 
converges to a Pareto-optimal equilibrium. Moreover, the evaluation of the proposed 
algorithm through simulations presents its superiority based on a better trade-off 
between capacity and fairness compared with a centralized maximal rate and round 
robin approaches. In Li et al. (2010), SUs act as relays and assist the transmissions of 
operators’ PUs to gain access for their own transmission in the spare operators’ spec-
trum. The fact that multiple SUs compete with each other to acquire spectral access 
from multiple operators, while the latter compete with each other to get assisted from 
multiple SUs, results in modeling this scenario as coalitional game with a nonempty 
core. To conclude, the authors investigate the behavior of SUs’ access rates and opera-
tors’ data rates as solution to an optimization problem with a concave objective func-
tion and linear constraints leading to a transferable coalitional game.

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 455
Moreover, other game theory approaches met in CRN framework are the auc-
tion theory and mechanism design. More specifically, in Khaledi et al. (2013) the 
spectrum allocation problem is studied under a scenario of auction theory where 
a primary spectrum owner (PO), which acts as the auctioneer, sells idle spectrum 
bands to make a profit and the SUs bid to buy spectrum bands from the PO. The 
CRN’s channels are nonidentical, that is, have different qualities, the SUs express 
their preferences for each channel separately and each SU submits one vector of bids 
for each channel. Furthermore, numerical results show improvement in social wel-
fare, SUs’ channel capacities and PO’s revenue performances in comparison with 
the case of identical channels. In terms of mechanism design, two algorithms are 
proposed in Wang et al. (2008) to suppress cheating and collusion behavior of self-
ish users for the improvement of spectrum efficiency. In the first algorithm, under 
the Bayesian mechanism design, the selfish users’ incentive to cheat is eliminated 
and the cooperative unlicensed spectrum sharing is achievable under the threat of 
punishment. In the second one, under a collusion-resistant dynamic spectrum pric-
ing auction game, licensed spectral resources are shared among PUs and SUs and 
users’ collusion is decreased by setting up the optimal reserve price in the auction.
13.4.4 Matching Theory
The large heterogeneous deployment of synchronous wireless communication sys-
tems leads to extreme signaling overhead and high complexity. These characteristics 
make the turn inevitable in the RRM field from the investigation of centralized 
approaches to the distributed and self-optimizing mechanisms. The necessity for 
distributed radio resource allocation paves the way to the application of matching 
theory (Gale et al., 1962; Roth et al., 1992), which describes the creation of mutu-
ally beneficial relations between different sets of agents, as an efficient mathematical 
tool for the design and analysis of wireless networks. The great impact of match-
ing theory is apparent by its adoption from the plethora of works in the scientific 
literature and especially the great application in CRNs that will be described next, 
as well as from its adoption in many real-world systems such as the U.S. National 
Resident Matching Program.
More specifically, under the framework of matching theory, the CRNs can be 
modeled as matching markets, which are separated as one-sided, that is, competi-
tive markets and two-sided markets. In two-sided markets, most of the applied 
algorithms are based on a stable matching algorithm called as deferred acceptance 
(DA) algorithm (Gale et al., 1962). For the matching process, according to the DA 
mechanism, each user (PU/SU) makes a ranking list from the most to the least 
preferable users of the other set (SU/PU) according to its preference relation, which 
is based on its utility function. After the lists’ construction, each user of one set 
(PUs/SUs) makes proposal for matching to the users of the other set (SUs/PUs) 
that belong to its preference list and the latter accept or reject the proposal. This 
procedure is repeated until each of the rejected users (PUs/SUs) makes proposal to 

456 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
all preferable users (SUs/PUs) and results either in stable matching between PUs 
and SUs or in unmatched users. A matching can be regarded as stable only if it 
leaves no pair of users on opposite sets, which were not matched to each other but 
would both prefer to be.
There are various classifications of matching models depending either on 
the users’ quotas or the construction of the users’ preferences (Gu et al., 2015). 
According to the users’ quotas, the one-to-one matching (O2O) model (e.g., stable 
marriage problem) is related with the pairing of each PU with at most one SU, 
while the one-to-many (O2M) (e.g., college admissions problem) and many-to-
many (M2M) matching models are associated with the matching between many 
SUs and one or many PUs, respectively. Based on the users’ preferences, that is, 
utility functions, there are two mostly used subcategories, the canonical matching, 
where the preferences depend solely on the information available at each specific 
user, and the matching with externalities. In the latter subcategory, there are inter-
dependencies between the users’ preferences, that is, individual users’ preferences 
are affected by the other users’ preferences and also by the current matching.
Matching theory has an extensive deployment in CRRM field, mostly in the 
management of spectrum sharing and users’ cooperation, as demonstrated by the 
following brief discussion on different works of recent literature. In Leshem et al. 
(2012), a multiuser CRN’s spectrum allocation problem is studied under an O2O 
matching model, where the wireless channels play the role of PUs and the utility 
functions are the ergodic capacities of each cognitive user on each channel. The 
authors prove not only the existence of a unique stable matching of their proposed 
matching algorithm, which is based on DA scheme, but also the algorithm’s time 
efficiency to lead to the stable allocation. Moreover, the authors (Bayat et al., 2013) 
consider an overlay CRN including multiple PUs and SUs and propose a distributed 
O2O users’ pairing mechanism, based on auction and matching theory, whose util-
ity functions consist of the rate and monetary factors that are applied in complete 
and partial received SNR scenarios. This mechanism ensures that both the PUs’ 
and the SUs’ minimum rate requirements are satisfied and contains the negotiation 
between PUs and SUs on the amount of monetary compensation and the time slot 
allocation that PUs propose to SUs for spectrum access or to relay the PUs’ signal. 
To conclude, it is proven that the algorithm results in the best possible stable match-
ing, which is weak Pareto-optimal and its performance is comparable to an optimal 
centralized solution. The O2O matching model is also considered in Feng et al. 
(2014) where the cooperative spectrum sharing is studied in a CR relay network 
between multiple PUs and SUs. The SUs act as relays for the PUs and gain time for 
their own transmission under complete, partially incomplete, and incomplete infor-
mation scenarios. These information scenarios are related with the PUs’ knowledge 
about the SUs’ private information, which includes the SU’s power transmission 
and channel gain of the link among secondary transmitter and primary receiver. 
In terms of PUs, the utility function incorporates the average data rate during the 
entire time period by employing SUs, while the SU’s utility function is the difference 

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 457
between the benefit of its own transmission and the cost of its total energy consump-
tion. In addition, the distributed proposed algorithm, which is based on the general-
ized Gale-Shapley algorithm and the English auction, leads the PUs to the unique 
Pareto-optimal equilibrium in the partially incomplete information scenario, while 
it converges to a stable equilibrium, in the incomplete information scenario. Finally, 
the authors notice that the PUs’ total utilities increase with the number of SUs, and 
when the SUs’ number is far larger than the PUs’ number, the utility losses caused 
by partially incomplete and incomplete information are negligible.
Besides the O2O matching models, there are many CRRM works occupied 
with the application of O2M matching models such as Vassaki et al. (2015) and 
Roumeliotis et al. (2015). Both works consider the leasing process under a multiuser 
cooperative overlay CRN, where SUs devote a part of their transmission power 
to relay the PUs’ message in exchange of their spectrum access. In the first work, 
the PU’s utility function is related with the rate, while the SU’s utility function is 
defined as a function of its rate minus a power cost due to the relay of the PU’s sig-
nal. In addition, the authors compare the O2O and O2M matching algorithms and 
result in the conclusion that O2M matching scheme leads to better performance 
for the PUs, whereas the SUs are more benefited by the O2O matching scheme. In 
Roumeliotis et al. (2015), the appropriate pairing of PUs and SUs is examined in a 
matching market under an O2M matching scheme with externalities which refer to 
the timeslot duration that is assigned to each SU and also the virtual payment that 
is employed as a cooperation incentive among the users. Furthermore, the utility 
functions of both the PUs and SUs incorporate the users’ rates and monetary fac-
tors and the SUs’ utilities also include the SUs’ energy consumption. The simula-
tion results reveal that in terms of PUs the performance of the proposed distributed 
algorithm is close to the performance of a centralized scheme with less complexity.
13.4.5 Multicriteria Decision Making Theory
The diversification, not only in the characteristics of radio environment, but also in 
the wireless technologies, renders the decision making for RRM a complex prob-
lem based on various criteria with conflicting requirements. This problem includes 
many objectives with multiple parameters, while two mathematical approaches 
that have been investigated for its solution are the fuzzy logic and the  multiattribute 
decision making (MADM). Besides the deployment of both theories in the widely 
known network selection problem (Charilas and Panagopoulos, 2010b), there are 
many applications of fuzzy logic and MADM in CRNs some of which will be 
described next. In literature, due to the tight connection of CR technology with the 
spectrum management, many paradigms of the aforementioned methods target to 
the amelioration of spectrum sensing process under appropriate SUs’ channel allo-
cation including the spectrum handoff (SH). The SH process depicts the change of 
SU’s current operating frequency channel when a PU arrives at the channel occu-
pied by the SU due to the PU’s protection from harmful interference.

458 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
The fuzzy decision-making process includes the fuzzification module, the fuzzy 
reasoning, and the defuzzification module. The input parameters to the fuzzy logic 
system are fuzzified between 0 and 1, based on predefined membership functions 
(MBF). Then, in the fuzzy reasoning phase a list of IF-THEN rules, which may be 
based on prior knowledge or questionnaires, determine the relations of input and 
output variables and in the last phase the fuzzy system’s output is reconfigured to a 
nonfuzzy number acquiring its actual value. In the terms of the MADM approach, 
there are various algorithms applied in CR systems such as analytic hierarchy pro-
cess (AHP), simple additive weighting (SAW), multiplicative exponent weighting 
(MEW), technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), 
and the compromise ranking method VIKOR, whose analytical overview can be 
found in Zavadskas et al. (2011).
The implementation of fuzzy logic in CRRM field is presented in Matinmikko 
et al. (2009), where the authors strengthen the connection between the CR and 
fuzzy logic due to the learning property of both mechanisms, and toward this 
direction, the proposed fuzzy-logic-based cooperative spectrum sensing mecha-
nism provides not only amelioration to the detection probability versus the false 
alarm probability, but also additional flexibility compared with AND and OR com-
bining methods. Furthermore, in Kaur et al. (2010), the authors investigate the 
SUs’ opportunistic spectrum access based on a fuzzy logic decision-making model 
including three descriptive factors, the SU’s velocity, the spectrum to be utilized by 
the SU, and the distance between PU and SU. The scope is to find each SU’s prob-
ability to access the spectrum depending on the aforementioned descriptive factors. 
The simulation results reveal that as SU comes closer to PU or SU moves with 
higher velocity, the SU’s probability to have access to the spectrum increases, result-
ing in the improvement of spectrum utilization. The spectrum handoff problem 
and how the available information from the spectrum sensing leads the SU to make 
this decision are studied in Giupponi et al. (2008). The proposed algorithm, which 
is implemented at the SU’s side, is based on two fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). The 
first FLC is used for the estimation of the PU and SU distance and the SU’s power 
transmission without causing harmful interference, while in the second FLC, SU’s 
handoff decisions or adjustments to SU’s transmission power are made based on 
the determined transmission power and SU’s bit rate. Finally, the authors compare 
the proposed fuzzy solution with a solution based on fixed thresholds with respect 
to spectrum handoff rate and interference temperature measured at the PU receiver 
and the former’s superiority is proven through simulation results.
The wide application of MADM theory in CRNs is indicatively presented next. 
In Rodríguez-Colina (2011), the SH problem is investigated and the selection of the 
available frequency bands from a finite set is derived by an algorithm based on the 
AHP method. The proposed algorithm incorporates two different SUs’ classes of 
service, that is, real time (RT) and best effort (BE) and the dynamic radio environ-
ment for extracting the optimal decision. The latter includes the change of instan-
taneous bandwidth, SUs’ SINR, QoS, and bands’ occupancy. Consequently, the 

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 459
spectrum bands are classified from the best to the worst based on the RT, whose 
most significant demands are low band occupancy and high QoS and the BE, 
whose priority is the bandwidth and SINR. Moreover, the simulation results show 
that the proposed algorithm accurately selects the combination of the aforemen-
tioned parameters focusing on the satisfaction of class of service requirement and 
the choice of the most appropriate band is done with low latency. Finally, the SH 
problem is also examined in Hernández et al. (2015), where the VIKOR, SAW, and 
MEW algorithms are compared in the selection of best channel under the crite-
ria of the probability of channel availability, estimated channel, time availability, 
SINR, and bandwidth. The performance metrics, whose evaluation is based on real 
spectrum occupancy taken from the GSM mobile band, are focused on handover, 
failed handover, bandwidth, and delay. To conclude, the simulation results depict 
that the VIKOR algorithm provides an efficient and effective process for channels’ 
selection because it has low average number of handover, high rate of bandwidth 
utilization, and low average transmission delay.
13.4.6 Machine Learning
As the bedrock of CR framework is the dynamic adaptation of cognitive users to 
the fast changing conditions of the radio environment, the incorporation of learn-
ing characteristics to the cognitive engine is crucial and the interest for the applica-
tion of machine learning algorithms in CRNs increases continuously, (Bkassiny 
et al., 2013; Alshawaqfeh et al., 2015). In particular, the machine learning field 
investigates algorithms that learn from sample data or past knowledge of a system 
and target to the optimization of system’s performance by building appropriate 
effective models. The classification of machine learning includes three categories: 
the supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In first category, the 
algorithms analyze the training data, that is, known inputs with known outputs, 
extract knowledge from them, and predict the outcome of new samples, while in 
second category, the algorithms examine and attempt to identify the hidden struc-
ture of the training data focusing mainly on appropriate data’s clustering. The third 
category focuses on the behavior of users to take actions in an environment so as to 
maximize/minimize a specific cumulative reward/cost function. In reinforcement 
learning, the agent determines a sequence of actions composing a policy that maps 
the state of an unknown environment with an optimal action. Due to this environ-
ment’s uncertainty, the agent results in the optimal action after the exploration of 
all current feasible actions and their consequences. Consequently, the combination 
among the exploitation of the existing system’s past knowledge and the exploration 
of the current system’s state leads to the most beneficial action for the agent.
In the CRRM field, machine learning techniques have been deployed in spec-
trum sensing process to find the appropriate channels, which will be occupied by 
SUs in order to eliminate collisions among PUs and SUs, and keep the interference 
to PUs under an acceptable threshold. In Thilina et al. (2013), the cooperative 

460 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
spectrum sensing is investigated under various pattern classification mechanisms 
for both unsupervised and supervised learning. Especially, each SU collects data for 
the energy levels of surrounding environment in a feature vector, called as energy 
vector, and feeds a classifier to decide the availability of the channel, categoriz-
ing the feature vector into channel available, where no PU is active, and channel 
unavailable classes, where at least one active PU exists. According to the training 
phase, which precedes the online classification, the classifier learns from the train-
ing feature vectors under different algorithms, that is, the K-means clustering and 
Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the unsupervised learning and the support 
vector machine (SVM) and weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN) for the supervised 
learning. More specifically, in K-means clustering algorithm the training feature 
vectors are separated in K clusters corresponding to a combined state of PUs and 
the classifier decides the mapping of each cluster with one of the two classes, while 
in GMM, the feature vectors are described by a mixture of Gaussian density func-
tions each of which correspond to a cluster. Moreover, in SVM approach, the maxi-
mization of the margin among separating hyperplanes and feature vectors results 
in the support vectors, which are subsets of training vectors that fully specify the 
decision function. In addition, in terms of the weighted KNN technique each fea-
ture’s weight is obtained by evaluating the area under the receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curve of that training feature vector. After the examination of the 
aforementioned classifiers under the training duration, the classification delay and 
the ROC curves, the simulation results reveal that the SVM classifier achieves the 
highest detection performance, the weighted KNN’s train duration is very small, 
and the performance of K-means clustering is close to the SVM-linear classifier in 
terms of the ROC performance.
Besides the supervised and unsupervised learning, the concept of reinforcement 
learning is also presented in CRRM such as in van den Biggelaar et al. (2012). 
A system with a large circular primary cell and many secondary cells, each one 
with a central SBS and many SUs, which operate on the same frequency band 
with the PU, is deployed. Moreover, a decentralized Q-learning power allocation 
algorithm is investigated to maximize the SINR at the secondary receivers sub-
ject to a constraint for the PU’s allowed aggregate interference. According to the 
Q-learning technique each SBS is an agent that aims to learn an optimal power 
allocation policy for its cell by interacting with the environment, which is mod-
eled as a finite-state discrete-time stochastic system. Consequently, SBSs sense the 
environment state, select an action according to a policy, perform this action, sense 
the resulting new environment state, compute the induced cost, and update the 
state-action Q-value according to a rule. To conclude, the numerical results show 
that the use of a cost function with the property of penalizing the SUs’ actions that 
lead to a higher than required secondary SINR is related with better results than 
a cost function without such penalty and the Q-learning convergence is faster as 
the frequency of execution increases until a value after which the convergence time 
remains invariable.

Cognitive Radio Networks Optimization ◾ 461
The wide range of different mathematical perspectives that approaches the CR 
resource management, as presented in this chapter, assures the importance of the 
RRM field in CRNs and their flexible extension using various new techniques 
in next-generation wireless communication systems. To summarize and obtain a 
comprehensive overview of the CRRM field, the aforementioned mathematical for-
mulations and the utility functions are presented in Figure 13.5.
13.5 Open Research Issues and Concluding Remarks
Summing up, this chapter provides a thorough analysis about the concept of 
CRNs, which, according to recent literature, consists of a promising candidate 
technology toward the implementation of 5G networks. The importance of 
RRM in the wireless systems is depicted and a plethora of applied mathematical 
approaches in the CRRM framework are rigorously discussed through an exten-
sive and comprehensive survey in significant research works. One of the most 
important technical challenges is the design of optimized cognitive nodes exploit-
ing the advances in the field of software radio technologies and software-driven 
5G networks. These nodes will be optimized based on a cross-layer optimization

strategy in order to be able to get inputs from and provide outputs to other nodes 
operating at each layer in the device.
Moreover, on one hand, new RRM algorithms in CRN tailored for specific 
networks should be developed that will consider the information that is exchanged 
at a local level. On the other hand, network-wide RRM mechanisms should be 
optimized in order to have all the benefits of a cognitive approach.
Many challenges also exist in the coexistence of high frequency microwave 
fixed point-to-point terrestrial links and fixed satellite services operating at Ka band 
(27.5–29.5 GHz). There are many issues as these both links can be employed as 
backhaul solutions, but there are also many issues rising with the next-generation 
satellite networks operating at Ka band and above that, consisting of non-GEO sat-
ellite constellations and Earth Stations on Mobile Platforms (ESOMPs). Therefore, 
new optimized RRM schemes should be proposed to address these issues in order 
to dynamically control the intersystem interference that is generated between the 
fixed service (terrestrial) and fixed satellite service (satellite) networks.
Many technical challenges of the cognitive radio networks such as, routing, 
mobility, and dynamic spectrum management should be handled along with the 
employment of 5G networks, taking into considerations the complex radio envi-
ronments and the user preferences.

470 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
14.1 Introduction
Over the past decade, one of the most relevant costs in the budget of developed 
countries is Public Health expenditure. In 2011, the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) defined the total health expenditure per 
capita (PPP) as percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) ranging from 10.2% 
to 11.9% for the top 10 countries (Andria et al. 2015). Regarding the United States, 
economists at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimate 
that health care spending will grow by 5.8% per year for the period 2010–2020, 
1.1% more than the expected growth of the GDP. By 2020, national health expen-
ditures are projected to reach $4.64 trillion, representing then almost 20% of the 
GDP (Keehan et al. 2011). Since rising health care costs are unsustainable, there is 
a growing need for finding new ways to deliver health care. At the same time life 
expectancy is continuously increasing and it pushes the demand for health care 
services upward as elderly people demand for autonomous lifestyle and high qual-
ity of life. In addition, people have higher expectations and demand more options 
in their health care. However, we do not take good care of ourselves to prevent 
 diseases: obesity, heart disease, and cancer are global health issues that are worsened 
by the way we live, for example, poor diet, physical inactivity, and smoking. So, 
policy makers are crushed between two opposite forces: the need to reduce public 
expenses for welfare on one hand and the continuous demand for high quality 
health care services on the other hand. Taking into account all the above, the only 
solution that seems viable is a radical change in the traditional models of health 
care assistance toward new services in which the patient is actively involved and 
instructed to manage his own health (Andria et al. 2015).
Rapid advancements in wireless sensing and smart devices are creating a per-
vasive wireless environment that can address a wide range of major health-related 
challenges, such as the aging population, prevalence of chronic diseases, outbreaks 
of infectious diseases, support for well-being, and entertainment (Nikita et  al. 
2012). Innovations in human-computer interaction research have revealed effective

methods for people with various disabilities to use computers or to receive computer 
aided medical treatment. Furthermore, the prevalence of sensor-rich smartphones, 
PDAs, and tablets has broadened the perspective in the roles and capacities of these 
mobile devices in monitoring and intervention of human health-related activities. 
Moreover, the demand for accurate monitoring of human behaviors and lifestyles 
has never been so imminent because it plays a key role in the prevention of diseases 
such as cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and obesity.
Exploitation of recent technological advances assists in a fundamental redesign 
of health care processes based on the use and integration of communication tech-
nologies at all levels. Computer technologies, modern equipment and information 
and communication technologies (ICT) for health care solutions have given rise to 
the electronic health (e-health) field, while the integration of mobile computing, 
medical sensors, and portable devices in the health environment has enabled the 
subfield of mobile health (m-Health) (de Mattos and Gondim 2016). The concept 
of m-Health was first introduced in Istepanaian et al. (2004) and defined as mobile 
computing, medical sensor, and communications technologies for health care. Nowadays, 
the m-Health is bringing together major academic research and industry disciplines 
worldwide to achieve innovative solutions in the areas of health care delivery and 
technology sectors (Istepanaian and Zhang 2012). In a broad sense, m-Health is the 
delivery of health care services through mobile devices, which are used to capture, 
analyze, store, and transmit health information from multiple sources, including 
sensors and other biomedical acquisition systems. Mobile applications for health 
can address different audiences, such as doctors, nurses, patients, and even healthy 
people. Solutions can be used to encourage, for example, a reduction in cigarette con-
sumption, adherence to weight loss diets and physical activity plans, or adherence to 
treatment plans aimed to control and prevent heart disease. As a result, m-Health 
solutions can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health services, enabling 
cost-effective and efficient health care delivery at home and/or hospital, assisted-
living and nursing home settings to reduce operating costs and promote disease 
management and wellness (de Mattos and Gondim 2016, Figure 14.1).
A diverse range of applications and maturing technologies are ready for trans-
lational research and practical deployment, addressing global health challenges 
associated with demographic, environmental, social and economic changes (Nikita 
2014). The necessary steps toward large scale m-Health deployment in today’s 
health care include setting the related devices (implantable, digestible, and wear-
able) standards, ensuring functionality and patient safety and defining high data 
rate secure protocols for biosignals. Also, to practically exploit current technology 
in the field of modern medical devices, the issue of energy-autonomous systems 
through energy scavenging applications as well as energy management and optimi-
zation issues in biomedical devices and networks must be addressed (Kim and Chu 
2016). As far as sensing technologies are concerned, in-body and on-body sensors 
using bioelectronics, smart textiles, printable-flexible-stretchable electronics and 
microelectromechanical system (MEMS) are the technologies that will be used to 

472 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
create implantable, digestible and wearable medical devices (Nikita 2014). Finally, 
electronic health records through advanced big data analytics will help clinical 
decision support to become more efficient, better supporting evidence based medi-
cine and health care.
Looking at m-Health applications from a different perspective, one of the biggest 
Internet of things (IoT) growth areas is measuring individual health metrics through 
self-tracking gadgets, clinical remote monitoring, wearable sensor patches, Wi-Fi 
scales, and a myriad of other biosensing applications (Swan 2012). As reported in 
Manyika et al. (2015), in 2025 remote monitoring could create as much as $1.1 
trillion a year in value by improving the health of chronic-disease patients. Toward 
this direction, there are three ways in which the IoT is revolutionizing health care: 
(a) reducing device downtime through remote monitoring and support, (b) proac-
tive fulfillment by replenishing supplies before they are needed, and (c) efficient 
scheduling by leveraging utilization to serve more patients. IoT devices can be used 
to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems. These 
health monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to 
advanced devices capable of monitoring specialized implants, such as pacemakers or 
advanced hearing aids. Toward this direction, future 5G capabilities (5G-PPP 2015) 
could generate significant improvements in many health scenarios, including the 
management and tracking of hospital assets, robotics-assisted tele-surgery, assisted 
living and remote monitoring of health or wellness data, and remote application of 
medication (smart medication).
Within this framework, this chapter aims to provide a brief overview of the 
main technologies and research areas enabling m-Health realization. First, the basic 
sensing principles in conjunction with the types of sensors used for mobile health 
applications are presented. Next, propagation and communications issues for wire-
less biomedical applications are discussed. Wearable, implantable and ingestible

medical devices are considered and aspects like spectrum regulations, patient safety 
and biocompatibility are analyzed along with a brief overview of commercially 
available products. Finally, state-of-the-art mobile health systems are presented 
before concluding with challenges and future opportunities in the field.
14.2 Sensing Methods and Technologies
14.2.1 Sensing Principles
During the past decades, advances in technology have had significant impact on 
monitoring applications in the fields of e-health, clinical diagnosis, and biomedical 
telemetry. The successful employment of these applications relies on the develop-
ment of sensing devices called biosensors. Biosensors are the devices that provide 
physical, chemical, and biological data for monitoring several human functions 
and diseases. Over the past years, novel sophisticated tools and new materials have 
made it possible to construct sensing devices with increased reliability and accuracy 
with respect to the sensed information.
As depicted in Figure 14.2, the fundamental elements of a biosensor are the bio-
receptor, an immobilized element able to recognize the target analyte (compound 
whose concentration is to be determined), and the transducer, which is used to con-
vert the biochemical signal into a measurable electric signal (Monošík et al. 2012; 
Tamura 2014; Lioumpas et al. 2014). Based on the detection principle, biosensors 
can be mainly categorized into electrical, electrochemical, optical, calorimetric and 
piezoelectric. The basic characteristics of each category are presented next.
Electrochemical biosensors operate based on the presence of an appropri-
ate enzyme in the bio-recognition layer (baroreceptor), which is able to provide 
those electroactive substances to the physicochemical transducer in order to detect 
a measurable signal. Native enzyme can be used as the biorecognition element 
or enzymes can be additionally used as labels bound to antibodies, antigens, and

oligonucleotides with a specific sequence, thus providing affinity-based sensors 
(Bakker 2004). Depending on the analyte, different enzymes are employed for its 
detection (Grieshaber et al. 2008). Electrochemical sensors are classified to different 
categories according to the transducer’s operation principle, with the most com-
mon ones being the potentiometric, amperometric and impedimetric (Pohanka and 
Skláda 2008).
Optical methods for the detection of biomolecular interactions and their bio-
medical applications have attracted great research interest, since for most applications 
it is desirable to have a compact biosensor with high sensitivity and fast response. 
Furthermore, cost reduction of high quality fibers and optoelectronic components 
has played a major role in the development of optical biosensors (Velasco-Garcia 
2009). Specific advantages are the immunity to external electromagnetic interfer-
ence, increased speed of biodetection and increased bandwidth. The optical methods 
for detection are based on fluorescence spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, 
interferometry, and spectroscopy of guided modes in optical waveguide structures 
(Gauglit 2005; Velasco-Garcia 2009).
Thermal/calorimetric biosensors operation principle is based on the absorp-
tion or evolution of heat that all biological reactions taking place inside living 
organisms cause. Among their advantages are small size, long-term and high sta-
bility, and nonchemical contact measurement (Syam et al. 2012). Calorimetry 
involves measuring the heat following a biochemical reaction. Therefore, the basic 
part of a thermal biosensor is a sensor that measures the temperature and conse-
quently the number of immobilized enzyme molecules, as the amount of product 
molecules created can be calibrated against temperature changes (Lammers and 
Scheper 2001). The sensor most commonly used for measuring the tempera-
ture in the reaction medium is an enzyme thermistor (Danielsson and Mosbach 
1988). Thermal biosensors were recently applied as devices for detecting pesti-
cides and pathogenic bacteria (Syam et al. 2012), and of course they are still used 
as detectors for the presence of particular substances or for measuring biological 
parameters.
The fundamental principle on which piezoelectric biosensors operation is based 
the piezoelectric effect in conjunction with a piezoelectric crystal. Specifically, when 
the substance on the surface of the piezoelectric crystal reacts with a substrate, the 
crystal’s mass changes, causing oscillation of its resonant frequency. Choosing a 
crystal with proper resonant frequency is critical for the detection of the desired 
biomolecule. Piezoelectric biosensors have many advantages: they are small, inex-
pensive, and offer long-term stability and excellent temperature behavior. Also, 
they are capable of providing a rapid response signal. On the other hand, they 
cannot be used for static measurements since they only detect changes of a variable. 
Piezoelectric biosensors can be used as part of a flow injection analysis; they can 
detect substances in aqueous solutions and continuously monitor their concen-
trations. They have also been used for point mutation detection in human DNA 
(Dell’Atti et al. 2006).

Other types of biosensors are magnetic, pyroelectric and ion channel biosensors. 
Recently, magnetic biosensors technology overcame the problems related with size 
and power consumption by using giant mangetoresistance materials; detection of 
biomolecules in small samples with low concentration is now possible with great 
sensitivity and speed (Wang and Li 2008). Pyroelectric biosensors use pyroelec-
tric materials which have the ability to generate voltage or create current whenever 
their temperature changes. Finally, ion channel biosensors are suitable for detecting 
molecules of interest such as drugs with low molecular weight, large proteins or 
microorganisms (Krishnamurthy et al. 2010).
Based on the aforementioned sensing principles, sensors applied to humans 
are divided into two major groups: noninvasive and invasive/implantable sensors. 
Next, the most commonly used sensor types from both categories are presented.
14.2.2 Noninvasive (On-Body) Sensors and Interfaces
A broad category of noninvasive sensors are the ones that monitor electrophysi-
ological signals. To begin with, electrocardiography (ECG) is widely used in the 
diagnosis and management of many cardiac related diseases. The main compo-
nents of a typical ECG monitoring system are the electrodes, amplifier, and trans-
mitter. Recently, wireless, mobile and remote technologies have been applied to 
enhance the functionalities and usability of ECG, including the transition from 
traditional 12-lead to 3-lead ECG (Bsoul et al. 2011) and a carbon nanotube (CNT)/
polydimethylsilxane (PDMS) composite-based dry ECD electrode (Jung et al. 2012). 
Also, a belt-type electrode has been developed to enable long-term monitoring 
since head movement or sweating can cause traditional electrodes to shift or fall 
off (Polar 2009). Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been used to record and 
study the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex. The international 10–20 system 
is a method describing the location of scalp electrodes monitoring brain signals 
from the underlying area of cerebral cortex. The development of wireless ambula-
tory EEG is crucial for achieving long-term monitoring of a patient in their every-
day environment. Toward this direction, an EEG-based brain-machine interface 
(BMI) was proposed for assisting or repairing human cognitive functions (Xu et al. 
2011). Also, wireless EEG devices, headsets and headbands have been developed for 
BMI, enabling vision restoration patients, control of prosthetic limbs and robot-
ics (Sechang et al. 2012), speech generation (Guenther et al. 2012) and cognitive 
imaging. Another electrodiagnostic medicine technique based on electrophysiologi-
cal signal monitoring is electromyography (EMG). EMG signals generated during 
muscle contraction are often used in rehabilitation devices because of their distinct 
output characteristics compared to other biosignals (Wang et al. 2015). Typical 
EMG systems consist of surface and reference electrodes, an amplifier, a transmitter 
and batteries and can be used to control smartphones, notebooks and other gadgets. 
To solve issues related with wires and battery maintenance problems, EMG using 
conductive fabric for power supply and electrical shield for noise reduction has been 

476 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
developed, enabling precise EMG measurement with a wearable system. Toward 
this direction, an EMG system has been proposed to control an electric powered-
wheelchair using combinations of left, right and shoulder elevation gestures (Moon 
et al. 2005).
Another commonly used noninvasive sensing technique is the photoplethysmo-
gram (PPG). In essence, PPG is an optically obtained plethysmogram, a volumetric 
measurement of an organ. It includes a light emitting diode (LED) and a photode-
tector (Allen 2007). PPG can be used to monitor breathing, hypovolemia and other 
respiratory conditions (Reisner et al. 2008). Heart rate monitor in conjunction with 
respiratory rate has also been developed for wheelchair users (Postolache et al. 2009).
Pulse oximetry is a widespread noninvasive method for monitoring a person’s 
oxygen saturation using a sensor placed on a fingertip, earlobe or foot. Its oper-
ation principle is quite simple: light of two different wavelengths is transmitted 
through the body to a photodetector and the varying absorption at each wavelength 
is measured. This way, it is possible to measure both oxygenated and deoxygenated 
hemoglobin on a peripheral scale. Recently, a wearable device platform utilizing 
motion tracking and measuring oxygen saturation was reported (Dong et al. 2016). 
Wireless pulse oximeters are also, commercially available using either a fingertip 
sensor (iHealth 2010) or even a watch-like enclosure (Oxitone 2012). Most current 
wireless pulse oximeters use the Bluetooth protocol to communicate sensor read-
ings. However, Bluetooth usage poses an issue as far as battery life is concerned, 
thus alternative technologies like ZigBee are also considered (Watthanawisuth 
et al. 2010, Figure 14.3).
Wearable pressure monitors are another type of on-body medical sensors that 
can be used for measuring blood pressure, intraocular pressure, and so on. Modern 
systems allow home blood pressure monitoring and can serve as a substitute for 
regular visits to the physician. Moreover, home monitoring can be used to deter-
mine whether treatments for people with high blood pressure are actually working.

oximeter commercial devices. (From Oxitone., Accessed June 29, 2016. http://

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 477
In wireless blood pressure monitoring, the system operates wirelessly to inflate the 
cuff and display the values. Recently, a cuffless approach to estimate blood pres-
sure using pulse transit time (PPT) has become popular, potentially permitting 
continuous, noninvasive, BP monitoring after initial calibration (Mukkamala et al. 
2015). Furthermore, a body worn digital MEMS barometer that determines the 
altitude to conserve oxygen and energy in ventilator systems has been developed 
(Roger 2011). It can be used as smart bandage for negative pressure wound ther-
apy, employing differential pressure measurements. A system using a contact lens 
with an embedded MEMS strain gauge that measures eye curvature over a timer 
period has been developed. It can be used to monitor and control intraocular pres-
sure levels for patients suffering from glaucoma as well as detect early pathological 
cases (Sensimed 2004).
A further category of noninvasive sensors are motion sensors. Motion analysis 
uses several types of motion sensors and systems for various gait analyses, physi-
cal and daily activities with different diseases. There are different types of motion 
sensors and some of them are briefly discussed in the following. Accelerometers 
and gyrosensors can be used for a variety of applications. With the development 
of MEMS, accelerometer sizes and cost decreased and several rehabilitation stud-
ies were performed using them. In recent studies, acceleration signals at the low 
back, which is close to the center of gravity, were monitored, and different signals 
were found in patients with different diseases (Bonato 2005; Tao et al. 2012). 
Similar sensors have been designed to support high-resolution motion studies 
of patients being treated for neuromotor conditions such as Parkinson’s disease 
(Patel et al. 2009) and stroke (Hester et al. 2006). Another type of system is 
e-AR, a low-power, miniaturized ear-worn activity recognition sensor. The e-AR 
sensor is equipped with a MEMS three-axis accelerometer. This device allows 
detecting the gait cycle, seat locomotion, and acceleration (Atallah et al. 2012). 
Wireless gyrosensors have been used for evaluating the motion and posture of 
human segments while walking, by measuring the angular velocity and angle 
(Gouwanda and Senanayake 2010). Moreover, goniometers are sensors that mea-
sure the changes in the angle. An electronic optical fiber and flexible goniom-
eter can be used to measure relative rotation between two body segments (Echo 
Wireless Goniometry 2017).
As individual health care is a growing global interest, development of textile-
based electrodes and motion sensors is one of the main issues of recent smart textile 
research. Smart clothing offers functions such as sensing, displaying, transmission 
of information and energy collection. The current demand for implementing these 
functionalities is huge; therefore research on smart clothing is actively pursuing the 
development of electronic, photonic and photovoltaic textiles (Cho et al. 2011). 
Textile-based electrodes and motion sensors are being exploited focusing on increas-
ing the friendliness and quality of smart clothing. In addition, over the last few 
years, nanotechnology has seen an increased acceptance as well as widespread use of 
its applications in medicine (Alzaidi et al. 2012). Wearing-unconscious devices are 

478 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
required for biomedical and health care applications because bulky devices closely 
contacted with the human skin irritate users. Organic electronics enable large-area 
and distributed sensor and/or actuator array and are suitable for wearing-unconscious 
devices. A variety of flexible, large-area applications using organic transistors has been 
developed, including an insole pedometer with piezoelectric energy harvester and a 
surface electromyogram measurement sheet for prosthetic hand control (Takamiya 
et al. 2014). In a recently reported work (Kulkarni et al. 2014), a graphene based 
wearable sensor capable of detecting airborne chemicals that serve as indicators of 
medical conditions for rapid and sensitive vapor detection was presented.
Although wireless temperature monitoring is common in environmental 
applications, not many human related applications have been developed. One 
example is a small electronic device, attached to the human body via a disposable 
patch (Feversmart 2014). The device monitors body temperature and uses a nano-
bluetooth chip to transmit data in real-time to a relay unit, which then sends the 
temperature data to a server. Using a smartphone one can constantly monitor 
the body temperature in real time. Also, a temperature monitoring system using 
an array of wireless thermometers has been recently reported (Javadpour et al. 
2015). The main modules of each thermometer are an accurate semiconductor 
temperature sensor, a transceiver operating at 2.4  GHz and a microcontroller 
(Figure 14.4).
Lastly, flexible chemical sensors have been developed applying soft-MEMS 
techniques onto functional polymers. Recent research efforts on wearable oxygen 
and glucose sensors and their applications are reported in Yao et al. (2011). Also, 
thick-film technology has been applied to monitor transcutaneous blood oxygen, 
using amperometry, incorporating integral heating element to enhance transcuta-
neous diffusion of oxygen at 44°C (Lam and Atkinson 2007).

temperature monitoring. (From Feversmart, Accessed June 30, 2016. http://

14.2.3 Invasive/Implantable (In-Body) Sensors
Recently, invasive and implantable wireless technology has been widely used in 
biomedical applications. Implantable sensors can be used to monitor pressure, 
motility, pH and temperature (Cumming et al. 2006). Moreover, integration of 
ECG devices into a chip has been implemented in implantable pacemakers and 
defibrillators. The most common categories of invasive and implanted sensors are 
discussed next.
Pressure sensors are widely employed in a variety of applications. Passive wire-
less pressure sensors that were originally developed for use in harsh environments 
have been adapted for use in the human body. A wireless, batteryless implantable, 
real-time blood pressure monitoring microsystem for small laboratory animals 
has been recently reported (Cong et al. 2010). It employs an instrumental elas-
tic circular cuff (made of soft biocompatible material) which is wrapped around 
a blood vessel, avoiding vessel penetration and minimizing vessel restriction. 
Diaphragm and strain gauge pressure sensors are also available. As an example, 
the CardioMEM Champion is a small size implantable device for monitoring and 
treating aneurisms using a passive MEMS LC resonator. The device consists of the 
biocompatible sensor implanted in the wall of a patient’s cardiac major artery and 
an external reader that patients hold in their front. The sensor sends a RF signal 
to the reader, indicating real-time blood pressure data. The reader will wirelessly 
transmit the data to the physician, enabling blood pressure monitoring after the 
patient goes home. Also, an implantable intracranial pressure (ICP) senor provid-
ing strong indication of brain health and monitoring of conditions affecting the 
central nervous system has been recently reported. The ICP sensor is based on 
MEMS and liquid crystal polymer is chosen as the biocompatible and flexible 
structure (Sattayasoonthorn et al. 2013).
Chemical sensors are mainly used to monitor pH and glucose based on an 
electrochemical reaction. A remotely powered implantable microsystem for con-
tinuous blood glucose monitoring has been developed. It consists of a MEMS 
glucose biosensor bonded to a transponder chip which transmits the measured 
data to an external reader (Ahmadi and Jullien 2009). In addition, a wireless label-
free detection of disease related C-reactive proteins (CRPs) was reported in Chen 
et al. (2009a). The sensor uses a MEMS microcantilever which is deflected due to 
specific CRP- anti-CRP binding. The deflection of the microcantilever is detected 
using a position-sensitive detector and the converted biosignal is transmitted by a 
custom designed wireless amplitude shift keying transceiver.
In-body sensors have been also used in electroencephalography. A continu-
ous, in vivo EEG system using an inductively powered implantable wireless neural 
recording device has been developed. The device uses an intergrted circuit (IC) to 
amplify, modulate and transmit neural signals to an external receiver (Sodagar et al. 
2007). Moreover, deep brain stimulation (DBS) using brain pacemakers has become 
a reality in the last 20 years. Brain pacemakers, give the doctors an equal chance of 

480 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
defeating neurological diseases causing movement disorders like Parkinson, epilepsy, 
and dystonia. They are equipped with an implantable pulse generator, a battery-
powered micro-electronic device which generates mild electrical signals to reactivate 
the almost dead cells of different organs (Goswam et al. 2015).
Magnetoelastic sensors have been frequently used for implantable sensors. 
They are typically composed of a piezoelectric sensor and amorphous metallic glass 
ribbons or wires with resonant frequency inversely proportional to their length. 
The resonant frequency of such a sensor shifts in response to different physical 
parameters such as stress, pressure, temperature, flow and liquid velocity, magnetic 
field, and mass loading. The fabrication and application of a miniaturized array of 
four magetoelastic sensors that enable simultaneous remote measurement of pH, 
temperature and pressure are presented in Bouropoulos et al. (2005). The platform 
is ideal for applications where the sensors have to be placed inside sealed, optically 
opaque containers and when disposable use is necessary.
Finally, microfluidic technology is becoming increasingly popular in implant-
able devices and for lab-on-a-chip technology. It can also be applied in implantable 
drug delivery systems for colonic disease (Tng et al. 2012). One of the most notable 
 microfluidic-based drug delivery mechanisms is the Jewel insulin pump from Debiotech 
(JewelPUMP 2012), codeveloped with STMicroelectronics using Debiotech’s micro-
fluidic MEMS technology. The pump can be mounted on a disposable skin patch to 
provide continuous insulin infusion. It promises substantial improvement in the treat-
ment efficiency and quality of life of diabetic patients.
14.3 Wireless Technologies for m-Health
In this section the propagation and communications issues for m-Health are dis-
cussed. Basic concepts as well as recent advances are examined in the areas of body 
area electromagnetics, (Kiourti and Nikita 2014c), antennas and RF communica-
tions (Kiourti and Nikita 2014a), inductive coupling techniques and applications 
(Ghovanloo and Kiani 2014), intra-body communications (Roa et al. 2014), and 
wireless biosensor communication standards development (Schmitt et al. 2014).
14.3.1 Body Area Electromagnetics
The field of body area electromagnetics deals with the numerical and experimental 
modeling tools and methods used for wireless biomedical applications. Numerical 
modeling provides an effective way of assessing and predicting the electromagnetic 
performance of such systems in terms of radiation, propagation, and interaction 
with human tissues. It is considered of utmost importance for the computation of 
electromagnetic field values in human tissues as well as the evaluation of implant-
able biomedical devices in cases where it is impossible to conduct measurements in 
real operating scenarios. When simplified canonical geometries are used to model 

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 481
the human body, analytical methods can be implemented whereas numerical meth-
ods are applied when millimeter resolution anatomic models are used for increased 
accuracy of the findings.
14.3.1.1 Numerical Phantoms
Numerical phantoms are commonly used in studies regarding wireless biomedical 
applications. They are divided in two categories: canonical and anatomical ones. 
Canonical models are simple models, typically in the shape of a sphere, cylin-
der or cube, which can be solved either numerically or analytically. They provide 
computational efficiency with standard simulation resources and they can be used 
to obtain preliminary results. Also, experimental phantoms complying with the 
numerical ones are easy to construct, a crucial step in the validation procedure. 
Whole body canonical models have largely been used in the literature. A planar, 
three-layer model consisting of a low-water-content tissue layer embedded between 
two high-water-content tissues has been proposed in Curto and Ammann (2007). 
Canonical models have also been used to model specific parts of the human body. 
For example, a rectangular structure filled with tissue-emulating material has been 
used to model the human torso in Kuhn et al. (2009). Also, the human arm has 
been approximated as a tapered cone of different radii and axis ratio as well as tissue 
compositions, as reported in Lim et al. (2011).
Anatomical models are used to obtain more accurate results. In this case, the 
human body is modeled by cubic cells (voxels) whose electrical properties are con-
sidered constant. By assigning the corresponding electrical properties to each voxel, 
the anatomical tissues and organs are easily modeled. As computing power increases 
and computer resources get less expensive, there is a trend to move to more detailed 
anatomical structures. In contemporary models, the highest complexity used for 
modeling the human body is about 50 tissue types, and the finest resolution is 
about 1 mm. In the majority of studies, the data for designing the anatomical body 
models are obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomog-
raphy (CT) scans. Several anatomical models have been developed for use in a wide 
range of applications. Data acquired from CT scans of a cancer patient have been 
used to create a model consisting of approximately 35,000 10-mm-edge cubic cells 
in Sullivan (1990). Two 2-mm-resolution whole-body Japanese models with hands 
placed at the side of the body have been developed using MRI. They classified over 
50 types of tissues based on images of a 22 year old male and a same age female 
(Nagaoka et al. 2004). Moreover, an anatomical human head model comprising 24 
tissue types has been used in Chen et al. (2009b). The most advanced and complete 
set of computational anatomical models representing a wide range of the popula-
tion is the Virtual Population from IT’IS foundation. Recently, Virtual Population 
3.0 was released, including significantly enhanced models for reliable effectiveness 
and safety evaluations of diagnostic and therapeutic applications, including medi-
cal implants safety (Gosselin et al. 2014, Figure 14.5).

482 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
14.3.1.2 Computational Methods
Computational methods used to solve complex electromagnetic problems are 
divided into analytical and numerical ones. Analytical methods include solving 
Maxwell’s equations without a direct numerical solution and inversion of large 
matrices. They are particularly useful to provide an insight into the physical mech-
anisms of electromagnetic (EM) propagation an interaction with biological tissues. 
The main restriction of analytical methods is the use of simplified canonical geom-
etries for modeling the human body, which is necessary to obtain a closed form 
solution of the wave equation. Analytical methods have been traditionally used 
to treat specific problems in the literature (Weil 1975). Moreover, they can serve 
as valuable tools toward verifying the accuracy of numerical simulation results 
(Nikita et al. 2000; Gupta and Abhayapala 2008). On the other hand, numerical 
methods involve numerical solutions to Maxwell’s equations subjected to a set 
of initial or boundary values and are generally implemented on powerful com-
puting systems. They can handle complex geometries and provide some physical 
insight into the electromagnetic performance of simulated systems (Kiourti and 
Nikita 2014b). The five most common numerical techniques used in the field of 
bioelectromagnetics are: the method of moments (MoM) (Harrington 1968), the 
finite element method (FEM) (Silvester and Ferrari 1996), the finite-difference 
time-domain (FDTD) method (Yee 1966), the transmission line method (TLM) 
(Christopoulos 1996) and the multiple-multipole (MMP) method (Hafner 1990). 
Hybrid methods have also been derived from the combination of these and other 
EM propagation methods (Uzunoglu et al. 2000). These methods have been widely 
used to study a large variety of EM problems concerning biomedical applications 
in the past three decades (Zhao et al. 2006; Traille et al. 2008).

age groups and body shapes. (From Gosselin, M.-C. et al., Phys. Med. Biol., 59,

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 483
14.3.1.3 Experimental Verification
The following step after analytical or numerical evaluation of the corresponding EM 
problem is the experimental verification of simulation results. Therefore, physical 
modeling of the configuration under study is necessary. Experimental verifications 
can be performed with either real human subjects or physical phantoms (Kiourti 
and Nikita 2014b). Physical phantoms are surrogates of the human body that have 
electrical properties (electrical conductivity and relative permittivity) equivalent 
to those of biological tissues. The use of physical phantoms provides a stable and 
controllable EM environment which cannot be easily realized with human subjects. 
Moreover, safety issues make them an essential tool in the procedure of experimen-
tal testing and verification. Physical phantoms consist of materials in liquid, gel, or 
solid state. Several recipes have been proposed to produce such materials account-
ing for different types of tissue and operating frequencies. Liquid phantoms consist 
of an outer thin shell that must comply with specific guidelines (Kanda et al. 2004). 
They are easy to prepare and adjust but suffer from the limited frequency range over 
which they exhibit the desired electrical properties. Liquid phantoms have been 
used in implantable antenna testing among other applications (Liu et al. 2008). 
Gel phantoms cover a wider frequency range and allow more accurate modeling of 
the human body by stacking layers mimicking different tissue types on top of each 
other. They are formed by adding coagulants to the liquid solution. Such phantoms 
have been presented and analyzed in Karacolak et al. (2008) and Sani et al. (2010). 
Their main disadvantage is that they are suitable only for high-water-content tissue 
modeling and their properties highly degrade over time. Solid phantoms are made 
from materials that keep their shape over time, and they have the advantages of 
high accuracy in modeling the heterogeneous human body, fine mechanical stabil-
ity, and minimized degradation over time. On the other hand, solid phantoms are 
usually expensive and complicated to fabricate. Several recipes have been proposed 
in literature (Onishi et al. 2005).
Canonically shaped physical phantoms have been used for biomedical applica-
tions. Rectangular and cylindrical containers filled with tissue mimicking materi-
als have been used to test prototypes of planar inverted F and 3D spiral antennas 
in MICS (402–405 MHz) and ISM (2.4–2.8 GHz) bands (Karacolak et al. 2009; 
Abadia et al. 2009). For a more realistic approach, anatomically shaped models 
have also been used in many studies. The most widely used homogeneous head 
phantom is the Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) which has been pro-
posed by IEEE (2003) and IEC (2005). Furthermore, a homogeneous anatomical 
model of the human head has been used in Karathanasis et al. (2012) and a human 
phantom of approximately 1.7 m height and 0.35 m average width has also been 
used as a radio propagation setup in Alomainy and Hao (2009). For all types of 
phantoms mentioned earlier, agreement of the electrical properties of fabricated 

484 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
materials with the intended theoretical values must be ensured. Toward this direc-
tion, several measurement techniques have been developed (e.g., coaxial probe, slot-
ted line, transverse electromagnetic [TEM] line) with each applying to specific 
materials, frequency ranges, and applications (IEEE 2001, 1528).
Finally, the biological effects of EM radiation must be taken into account during 
the analysis of wireless biomedical applications, ensuring the compliance with statu-
tory guidelines set form international organizations. The effects of EM radiation in 
the human body depend not only on the field level but also on its operation frequency. 
Wireless biomedical systems produce non-ionizing radiation and cause thermal 
effects through transformation of the energy of the photons into kinetic energy of 
the absorbing molecules. All regulations and recommendations regarding the limits 
on allowable absorbed power in the body are based on quantitative short-term evalu-
ation of the thermal effects caused by EM fields. The two major standards have been 
set by IEEE (IEEE 1999, 2003), and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing 
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP 1998) while several other standards exist as well. The 
dosimetric quantity most commonly used to determine the interaction of EM fields 
with human tissues is the specific absorption rate (SAR). SAR can be experimentally 
measured by means of high-precision, multichannel exposition acquisition systems 
(EASY) and reliable high-precision dosimetric assessment systems (DASY) (Speag 
1998). Acceptable levels of radiation are typically expressed in terms of maximum 
permission exposures and SAR values averaged over 1-g or 10-g volumes of tissue.
14.3.2 Antenna Design Considerations
The major drawback of historically reported biomedical systems has been the wired 
communication between medical devices and an exterior monitoring/control 
equipment, significantly limiting patient comfort and convenience. Therefore, 
devices with wireless communication functionalities appear as a highly promising 
option toward improving patients’ quality of life and providing medical systems 
with constant availability, context awareness, reconfigurability, and unobrusive-
ness (Jovanov et al. 2003). Nowadays, advances in wireless communications fur-
ther facilitate the deployment of wireless biomedical systems. In this context, it 
becomes obvious that, like in every other wireless application, antenna design 
plays a key role in the development of wireless biomedical systems. Antennas for 
such systems can be divided into three categories: on-body (wearable), implant-
able, and ingestible. On-body antennas are placed on the human body or are worn 
as part of a garment. Implantable antennas are integrated into medical devices that 
are implanted inside the human body by means of a surgical operation and ingest-
ible antennas are used with medical devices that have the form of a capsule to be 
swallowed by the patient. Several challenges have to be addressed to make the 
wide use of the aforementioned antennas, and thus wireless medical devices, an 
actuality. For example, such antennas are required to be small, lightweight, robust, 
conformal to the body surface, and biocompatible, maintaining an improved 

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 485
patient safety performance. An overview of the challenges and proposed solutions 
for each category is discussed in the following (Nikita 2014).
14.3.2.1 On-Body Antennas and Safety Assessment
Research on on-body antennas has attracted significant interest toward the develop-
ment of antennas for communication with exterior systems or other on-body anten-
nas (Kiourti et al. 2014a). The first step in the design procedure is the selection of the 
operation frequency. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) has allocated the bands of 608–614, 1395–1400, and 1427–1432 MHz for 
wireless medical telemetry service (WMTS), as well as the bands of 902–928 and 
2400.0–2483.5 MHz for industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) applications. In 
Europe, the frequency bands of 433.1–434.8 and 868.0–868.6 MHz are used for 
ISM applications. Finally, the Ultrawide Band (UWB) of 3.1–10.6 GHz, which has 
been authorized by the FCC, receives considerable attention because of the wide 
bandwidth offered. Microstrip and loop designs are generally applied for on-body 
antennas because of their conformability and light weight, but for many body pos-
tures, quarter-wavelength monopole antennas placed on a small ground plane have 
been shown to perform even better due to their omnidirectional pattern. In other 
cases, directive planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) are preferred. Miniature copla-
nar waveguide (CPW)–fed tapered slot antennas (TSA), as well as planar inverted 
cone antennas (PICA) have also been reported for UWB biomedical telemetry 
(Alomainy and Hao 2009). On-body antennas need to be flexible with low profile, 
easy to attach to the body or clothing. Therefore, textile antennas are also studied. 
Conductive materials (electrotextiles) can function as electronics while physically 
behaving as textiles and can thus be used to enable fabrication of textile antennas 
(Kiourti and Volakis 2016). Moreover, an UWB antenna made from textile materi-
als has been reported in Osman et al. (2011). The antenna exhibited 17 GHz of 
bandwidth, omnidirectional patterns and adequate gain and efficiency.
Performance of on-body antennas is considerably affected by their proxim-
ity to human tissues. Commonly reported issues include antenna detuning, dis-
tortion of the radiation pattern, and degradation of the radiation efficiency. To 
better understand those issues, experimental investigations inside a reverberation 
chamber for five compact on-body antennas operating at 2.45 GHz and worn by 
nine individual test subjects have shown standard deviations of the antenna radia-
tion efficiency of less than 0.6 dB and resonance frequency shifts of less than 1% 
(Conway et al. 2008). Furthermore, the technique of designing on-body antennas 
on electromagnetic band gap (EBG) substrates has been reported for overcoming 
radiation absorption inside the human body and achieving higher values of antenna 
gain (Zhu and Langley 2009; Wang et al. 2015). Finally, to achieve the necessary 
radiating characteristics but also reduce peak SAR level for 2.4 GHz ISM band, an 
artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) backed wearable antenna on latex substrate 
has been recently presented in Agrawal et al. (2016), Figure 14.6.

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 487
Another factor that has to be taken into account when designing on-body anten-
nas is the structure of the medical device into which the antenna is to be inte-
grated. This involves the surrounding circuitry, including integrated circuits (ICs) 
and lumped elements. Therefore, antenna operation and performance are expected 
to vary according to the parameters that govern the operation of the medical device 
as a whole. To address this issue, a study that illustrated the importance of including 
the details of the medical device in determining and analyzing the performance of 
an on-body antenna has been presented in Alomainy et al. (2007). Results showed 
the proposed sensor matched monopole antenna design exhibited increased gain 
and efficiency (2.8 dB and a 29% respectively) as well as 25% enhancement in the 
coverage area compared to a stand-alone monopole design.
14.3.2.2 Implantable Antennas
Integrated implantable antennas are a key component of wireless implantable 
medical devices (Kiourti et al. 2014b; Kiourti and Nikita 2015). Operation fre-
quencies for implantable antennas include the already mentioned ISM bands as 
well as the lately established Medical Implant Communications Systems (MICS) 
band at  402–405  MHz. Patch antennas are mostly preferred as implantable 
antennas because they are highly flexible in design and conformability (Kim and 
Rahmat-Samii 2004; Kiourti and Nikita 2012a, 2012d). Implantable antennas 
must also be biocompatible, in order to preserve patient safety and prevent rejec-
tion of the implant. Furthermore, they must be covered by a superstrate dielec-
tric layer to avoid antenna short-circuit through contact with conductive human 
tissues. Commonly used biocompatible materials include Teflon, MACOR, and 
ceramic alumina (Soontornpipit et al. 2004). Insulating the antenna with a thin 
layer of low-loss biocompatible coating is another reported approach. Among 
others, materials proposed for biocompatible encapsulation include zirconia, 
(Skrivervik and  Merli 2011) and Silastic MDX–4210 Biomedical–Grade Base 
Elastomer (Karacolak et al. 2010, Figure 14.7).
One of the greatest challenges in implantable antenna design is miniaturization, 
especially at the low-frequency MICS band. To achieve this goal, several techniques

488 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
can be used (Kiourti et al. 2012; Kiourti and Nikita 2012b). First of all, human 
tissue, in which implantable antennas are intended to operate, exhibits relatively high 
permittivity which is exploited to miniaturize the size of the antenna. Additional 
miniaturization techniques include the use of high-permittivity dielectric materials 
(Kiourti et al. 2011), lengthening the current flow path on the patch surface (Liu 
et al. 2008), addition of shorting pins (Soontornpipit et al. 2004) and patch stacking 
(Kiourti and Nikita 2012c).
Another significant issue related to implantable antenna design is the maximum 
allowable power incident to the antenna, which is limited by safety guidelines. As 
already mentioned, SAR is generally accepted as the most appropriate dosimetric 
measure, and compliance with international guidelines is assessed (ICNIRP 1998; 
IEEE 1999). An attempt to modify the design of an implantable antenna for reducing 
the spatial-averaged SAR in human tissue has been presented in Kim and Rahmat-
Samii (2006). Replacing the uniform-width spiral radiator of an implantable MICS 
PIFA with a non-uniform-width radiator was found to decrease the electric field 
intensity and, in turn, SAR.
Moreover, dual band operation is usually a legitimate requirement for implantable 
antenna design, enabling one frequency band for wake-up and one for data transmis-
sion (Kiourti and Nikita 2012c). This way, the power consumption of the implantable 
medical device is significantly reduced, increasing its lifetime. A dual-band (MICS 
and ISM) implantable antenna for continuous glucose monitoring has been proposed 
in Karacolak et al. (2008). In addition, an advanced antenna design was suggested 
using a π–shaped radiator with stacked and spiral structure, to support triple-band 
operation with data telemetry (402 MHz), wireless power transmission (433 MHz), 
and wake-up controller (2450 MHz) in Huang et al. (2011).
Prototype fabrication of implantable antennas meets all classical difficulties of 
miniature antennas: additional glue layers used to affix all components together 
strongly affect antenna performance by shifting its resonance frequency and degrad-
ing its matching characteristics, whereas the coaxial cable feed used to connect the 
antenna with the network analyzer may give rise to radiating currents on the outer 
part of the cable (Kiourti and Nikita 2014c). On the other hand, testing inside 
phantoms is easy to implement. The fabricated prototype is typically immersed 
inside a liquid tissue phantom and measured. Furthermore, use of animal tissue 
samples provides an easy approach to mimicking the frequency dependency char-
acteristics of the electrical properties of tissues. For example, a dual-band skin-
implantable patch antenna operating in the MICS and 2450 MHz ISM bands has 
been tested in real animal skin in Karacolak et al. (2009). Moreover, a triple-band 
implantable patch antenna has been tested inside a minced front leg of a pig (Huang 
et al. 2011). In vivo testing inside living animals is another experimental verification 
method. In this case, an in vivo testing protocol needs to be developed before the 
experimental investigations, which will deal with the choice and number of animals, 
presurgical preparation, anesthesia, surgical procedure, measurements, and postsur-
gical treatment (Kiourti et al. 2013). In vivo studies reported in the literature are 

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 489
thus very limited. However, the return loss frequency response of a skin-implantable 
antenna has been measured using rats as model animals in Karacolak et al. (2010).
14.3.2.3 Ingestible Antennas
Ingestible antennas have received a lot of research interest in the past years. The con-
ventional methods used for diagnosing disorders of the human gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract cause significant patient discomfort. As a result, there is considerable ongo-
ing work in developing ingestible antennas that can be integrated into a capsule 
and swallowed for examination of the entire digestive tract (Kiourti et al. 2014b). 
Selection of operation frequency for ingestible antennas has received a significant 
attention from the scientific community as it is affected by a number of compet-
ing effects. For example, antenna efficiency can improve with higher operation 
frequency. On the other hand, higher frequencies may cause increased radiation 
absorption because of the high water content of body tissues, requiring increased 
levels of power supply and posing questions regarding patient safety. The presence 
of the human body is another factor that must be taken into account when design-
ing an ingestible antenna. The effects of the human body on the performance of 
an ingestible antenna inside the frequency range of 150 MHz–1.2 GHz have been 
investigated in Chirwa et al. (2003). A peak in the power transmitted by an ingest-
ible medical device at approximately 650 MHz was found, and adequate com-
munication performance was demonstrated between 600 MHz and 1 GHz. On 
the other hand, video transmission in the 2.45 GHz band is better developed for 
WLAN and Bluetooth applications and ingestible medical devices operating at this 
frequency can be directly connected to relevant networks. Also, higher transmission 
frequencies allow the use of smaller antennas and electronic components, a pre-
requisite for ingestible medical devices, rendering the 2.45 GHz band a promising 
solution. For example, an IC design for wireless capsule endoscopy at 2.4 GHz has 
been proposed in Xie et al. (2004).
Besides the aforementioned requirements, an ingestible antenna needs to pos-
sess omnidirectional radiation pattern and exhibit circular polarization in order 
to transmit signals independently of its position and orientation. Taking into 
account the above, normal mode helical antennas are good candidates for such 
applications (Liu et al. 2014). Furthermore, wireless capsule endoscopy typically 
includes real-time transmission of high-resolution data, therefore, antennas with 
miniature size but wide bandwidth are required. For example, a wideband spiral 
antenna for ingestible capsule endoscope systems at 500 MHz was presented in 
Lee et al. (2011). Two more requirements that have to be met during implantable 
antenna design are that of biocompatibility and durability. These requirements 
entail packaging of the ingestible antennas inside a shell. Capsule casings and 
circuitry have been shown to have a negligible effect on the performance of the 
ingestible antenna (Liu et al. 2014); therefore, it is not compulsory to take them 
into account when modeling the antenna.

490 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Safety performance of ingestible antennas has also attracted significant scien-
tific interest. Usually, low frequency wireless devices cause less significant biological 
effects than higher frequency devices as attributed to decreased levels of tissue 
absorption. The SAR and temperature rise performance of ingestible antennas has 
been analyzed at frequencies from 430 MHz to 3 GHz in Xu et al. (2008). Results 
showed that high values of SAR and temperature were localized at the area near 
the ingestible device. The antenna was safe and could be used in ingestible medi-
cal devices at input power levels of less than 25 mW in order to conform to safety 
regulations. Performance of ingestible antennas for various locations inside the body 
and antenna orientations has also been investigated. In Liu et al. (2014), three dif-
ferent implant positions (stomach, small intestine, and colon) were examined using 
a three-dimensional voxel human body. Results showed that radiation characteristics 
(gain and axial ratio) are affected by different implantation depths.
14.3.3 Inductive Coupling
Near-field power transmission is a viable technique to wirelessly power up devices 
or recharge their batteries from a short range without direct electrical contact 
between the energy source and the device. Moreover, the same short-range wire-
less link can be used to establish wide-band bidirectional data communication. As 
a result, wireless implantable medical devices (IMDs) can benefit from the use of 
near-field power and data transmission links (Ghovanloo and Kiani 2014). These 
devices need to transmit and receive information wirelessly across the skin barrier 
since breaching the skin with interconnect wires would be a source of morbidity 
for the patient and would increase the risk of infection. To make things more com-
plicated, in sensory prosthetic devices which interface with the central nervous 
system, the quality of perception has been reported to increase with the number of 
stimulating sites and rate (Fernandes et al. 2012). Generally, these devices require 
more power and bandwidth than autonomous devices, like pacemakers. State-
of-the-art visual prostheses are currently targeting beyond one thousand sites to 
improve the quality of the visual functions, such as mobility without a cane, face 
recognition, and reading large fonts (Mathieson et al. 2012). Also, inductive links 
can be utilized to power up wireless neural recording systems for freely behaving 
small animal subjects developed for neuroscience applications (Fernandes et al. 
2012), surmounting the limitation of a large payload of batteries carried by the 
animal. In the following paragraphs, the main aspects of inductive coupling for 
m-Health applications are briefly discussed.
14.3.3.1 Operating Principle and Key Design Parameters
The main physical principle of inductive coupling is Faraday’s law, which states 
that when the total magnetic flux through a conductive loop varies with time, a 
current is induced in the loop itself. This, in turn, results in an electromotive force 

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 491
(EMF) induced in the loop (Sadiku 2007). Thus, a primary loop will generate the 
varying magnetic field, which concatenates with the secondary loop, resulting in 
an induced current in the secondary loop. A key design requirement in IMDs is 
to provide sufficient power delivered to the load (PDL) while maintaining high 
power transfer efficiency (PTE). The inductive PTE is defined as the ratio of the 
PDL to the power drained by the energy source. High PTE is required to reduce 
heat dissipation within the coils, tissue exposure to EM fields, size and weight of 
the external energy source and interference with nearby electronics. The typical 
power flow from external power source to IMD electronics indicating the various 
loss parameters along the way is depicted in Figure 14.8.
In an inductive power transmission link, active rectifiers can be used to main-
tain a high PTE. A 13.56-MHz active rectifier, which has achieved 80.2% power 
conversion efficiency when delivering 20 mW to the load, has been reported in Lee 
and Ghovanloo (2011). Furthermore, a closed-loop power transmission system 
can be used to maintain the received voltage constant in cases where the relative 
distance between the coils changes (Kiani et al. 2011). This way, voltage fluctua-
tions occurring due to changes in coils relative distance or misalignment can be 
mitigated.
Another critical parameter of the induction link is coil geometry. One of the deci-
sions that should be made early on when designing such a link is whether the coils 
should be wire wound or lithographically defined on a planar conductive surface. 
Wire-wound coils are made of filament wires twisted in a circular bundle, also known 
as Litz wires. The optimal number of turns for a coil made of Litz wire depends 
on the desired volume of the coil and parameters such as the number and diam-
eter of individual strands (Tourkhani and Viarouge 2001). Wire-wound coils major 
drawback, however, is the fact that they cannot be batch fabricated or miniaturized 
without the use of sophisticated machinery. On the other hand, printed spiral coils 
(PSCs), which are lithographically defined in one or multiple layers on rigid or flex-
ible substrates, such as PCB, can be batch fabricated. Also, they offer more flexibility 
in optimizing their geometries while occupying less space, deeming them attractive 
for IMD applications. An iterative design procedure has been reported, which starts 
with a set of design constraints and initial values and can result in the optimal PSC 
pair geometries (Jow and Ghovanloo 2007).

492 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Finally, ensuring that the electromagnetic power absorbed in the human body 
meets international safety standards is one more crucial aspect that coil designs for 
IMD applications should take into account. Full-wave electromagnetic computa-
tional tools and experimental methods with phantoms filled with tissue simulants 
can be used to determine the field induced by induction devices in the human body 
and compare them with standard safety limits (ICNIRP 1998; IEEE 1999).
14.3.3.2 Data Transmission
Bidirectional wireless data transmission is essential for IMD systems to establish 
short-range wireless communication between the transmitting and receiving parts 
of the system. The majority of advanced IMDs have several adjustable parameters 
that can be fine-tuned after implantation for every individual patient according 
to his or her specific needs. In addition, research is conducted to equip sensory 
devices with a flow of stimulation commands from the external artificial sensors and 
signal processing units to build closed-loop neuroprosthetic devices (Schwartz et al. 
2006). Sending adjustment and control commands wirelessly from the external unit 
to the implanted unit is known as the forward telemetry or downlink. Moreover, 
the same devices often need to inform the external processing components about 
the IMD operating status, possible faults, and in some cases the neuronal response 
immediately after stimulation for proper adjustment of the stimulation parameters 
(Venkatraman et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2010). This data flow direction is often referred 
to as backward telemetry or uplink.
When designing an induction link, there are two options: using a single carrier 
for both power and data transmission or using multiple (two or three) carriers for 
power, downlink and uplink. The choice of a single carrier has the advantage of 
robust coupling between power coils, which can lead to more reliable data trans-
fer. Also, space is saved by reusing power coils for multiple purposes. However, 
achieving high PTE and large bandwidth simultaneously is challenging as they 
set conflicting requirements. As a result, the use of two or three carrier signals for 
power, downlink, and uplink with each carrier having its own pair of coils in order 
to decouple the data transfer link bandwidth from the PTE has been proposed in 
(Zhou et al. 2008; Shire et al. 2009). The use of multiple carriers in a small space 
introduces new challenges though, with the most important being the interfer-
ence between strong power carrier with much weaker data carriers. Several research 
efforts have been reported offering solutions such as using orthogonal symmetrical 
coils (Jow and Ghovanloo 2010), coaxial coils with differential phase shift keying 
(DPSK) (Shire et al. 2009), and shifted coplanar coils with offset quadrature phase 
shift keying (OQPSK) (Zhou et al. 2008; Shire et al. 2009). Even though modu-
lating a carrier signal provides a robust means to transfer data, generation of the 
carrier signal at a power level that ensures sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 
the receiver involves consuming a considerable amount of power at the transmitter, 

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 493
which is scarce on the IMD side. One solution to this problem is to substitute the 
carrier signal with a series of sharp and narrow pulses, which require much less 
power to generate them (Inanlou and Ghovanloo 2011).
14.3.4 Intra-Body Communications
A different approach for wireless communications in the area of the human body 
is becoming popular nowadays. It is based on signal transmission through the 
human body, called intra-body communication (IBC) and has led to the first defi-
nition of body area networks (BANs) (Roa et al. 2014). This approach was pro-
posed by Zimmerman (1996): the architecture included a transmitter placed on 
the body surface that modulates an electric field, which is conducted by means of 
small currents through the body toward the receiver that demodulates the received 
signal, thus recovering the encoded information. Low carrier frequencies associ-
ated with low-power waves can be used, favoring lower consumption of the ter-
minals and less interference with nearby devices. The IBC propagation channel is 
mainly established through the human body, but depending on the application 
and the coupling type, there are different signal pathways. Three types of body-
centric communications types have been distinguished, namely off body, on body, 
and in body, depending on the degree of interaction of the human body with the 
surrounding space. For example, galvanic coupling should always be used when 
sensors are implanted inside the human body (in body). When all sensors are 
deployed on the surface of the skin, we refer to body surface sensor networks 
(on-body and off-body types), and both IBC galvanic and capacitive coupling 
schemes can be used. Some relevant examples of IBC are facilitated by the deploy-
ment of sensors in direct contact with human skin (like EMGs or ECG) for the 
welfare enhancement of disabled people (Liolios et al. 2010), or the estimation of 
muscular fatigue trough EMG (Lucev et al. 2010).
During the last decade, an important boost in IBC research has taken place 
by exploiting modeling approaches and techniques that have taken advantage of 
the rapid development of MEMS and nanotechnologies for the implementation 
of several laboratory prototypes with better performance. The results of attenua-
tion on experimental measurements performed on a human cadaver obtaining a 
range of −10 to −40 dB in the frequency range of 1–20 MHz are reported in Tang 
and Bashirullah (2011). In Zedong et al. (2012), the 24–30 MHz frequency range 
is suggested as optimal for IBC communications, which was obtained through 
experimentation in a shielded chamber. On the other hand, a frequency band 
between 280 and 500  MHz for capacitive body-coupled communications was 
determined in Attard and Zammit (2012). The maximum rate reported for IBC 
has been 10 Mbps, thanks to the introduction of high- impedance electro-optical 
sensors (NTT 2015). Unfortunately, these sensors have the disadvantage of a more 
complex electronic design, resulting in low capacity for integration, greater power 

494 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
consumption, and size. Based on the above, it is clear that there is an important 
variability in the reported performances, which demands research efforts focused 
on different techniques and approximations to measure channel propagation char-
acteristics (Yang et al. 2011).
Despite the great performance obtained by IBC systems, there are still impor-
tant remaining advances to be made. From a theoretical p, although IBC prototypes 
have significantly improved in performance, bit rate, and consumption, there is 
yet no common methodology to establish the design specifications of IBC systems, 
although some recent exceptions can be made (Bae et al. 2012). This is due to 
the fact that the electromagnetic (EM) mechanisms that govern the transmission 
through biological tissues still remain unknown. From a technological point of view, 
IBC systems must consider present and future trends in the field of micro and nano-
MEMS, which can lead to unobtrusive and compact solutions, like the proposed 
IBC system on a chip in Yan et al. (2011), while facing the need to compromise 
electronic complexity with performance to obtain realistic and sustainable solutions 
to be translated to the health care domain.
14.3.5 Biomedical Communication Standards
This section describes some examples of recent standard-based wireless technologies 
that are suitable for biomedical communications (Schmitt et al. 2014). In order to 
create a telehealth ecosystem, interoperability is important and can be achieved 
by means of well-defined and standardized interfaces between the various device 
classes. The Continua Health Alliance, with currently more than 240 member com-
panies (care providers, device manufacturers, software and middleware vendors, 
information technology suppliers, silicon device manufacturers, etc.), is working on 
selecting connectivity standards and defining complementary guidelines for ensur-
ing interoperability (Continua Health Alliance 2006).
The IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE 2011), specifies the physical and media access 
control layers for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) and is the basis 
for the ZigBee (ZigBee Alliance 2012), ISA100.11a (Kenney 2007), WirelessHART 
(HART 2008), and MiWi (Microchip 2010), specifications, which further extend the 
standard by developing the upper layers. The standard was released in 2003, amended 
in 2006, and enables communication of data at a maximum rate of 250 kbps.
In February 2012, IEEE published the IEEE 802.15.6 standard (referred to 
as 15.6) for a short-range wireless communication inside, on, or around a human 
body, with support of the combination of high reliability, quality of service, low 
power, scalable data rates (up to 10 Mbps), and interference mitigation (IEEE 
2012). The 15.6 standard specifies three Physical layers (PHYs) and a unified 
medium access control (MAC) and security solution to address the broad require-
ments of medical as well as nonmedical (e.g., entertainment and well-being) body 
area network (BAN) applications.

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 495
IEEE 802.15.4j (IEEE 2013) defines necessary PHY/MAC modifications for 
the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, making it able to operate in the 2360–2400-MHz 
band in compliance with the FCC MBAN rules (FCC 2012). Two considerations 
have been taken into account in the TG 4j standardization: (1) to keep the chan-
nelization scheme flexible to accommodate harmonized coexistence with in-band 
primary/MBAN services and (2) to provide MAC support to enable MBAN low-
power implementations.
Mature wireless transport standards suitable for connected devices in bio-
medical applications have been developed, solving a significant number of prob-
lems on the lower layers. However, more work at levels closer to the application 
is needed. A solution to this last gap of application layer interoperability has 
been developed within the family of International Standards Organization (ISO)/
IEEE 11073 personal health device (PHD) communication standards (Schmitt 
et al. 2007). These define a common framework for making an abstract model 
for personal health data available in transport-independent transfer syntax to 
establish logical connections between personal health sensors or devices (e.g., 
ECG sensors, heart rate meters, thermometers, or blood pressure monitors) and 
in-home compute engines. Besides general requirements like patient and user 
safety of medical devices, minimal user interaction, and unambiguous associa-
tion between devices and sensors, the protocol suite is optimized to personal 
health device usage requirements. Personal health devices are often battery pow-
ered, which mandates the need for very low computational complexity and low 
power consumption. For wireless devices the latter requirement suggests not only 
minimizing transmit power but also reducing transmission time by minimizing 
protocol overhead. The ISO/IEEE 11073 PHD standards have been adopted by 
the Continua Health Alliance and are leveraged by its design guidelines to enable 
a consistent, interoperable data layer concept across the different Continua 
interfaces.
14.4 Wearable, Implantable, Ingestible Devices
14.4.1 Spectrum Regulations
Demand on radio spectrum for use in wireless biomedical systems is currently on 
the rise. This demand is driven by a rapid increase in the use of medical devices, 
advancements in wireless communication technologies, and the need to improve 
quality, reliability, and delivery of health care. Some of the most commonly used 
frequency bands for biomedical telemetry systems include the MICS, WMTS, ISM, 
and UWB bands. Regardless of the chosen band, constant management is crucial 
for reducing the probability of interference from other transmitting devices (Nikita 
2014, Figure 14.9).

14.4.1.1 Medical Implant Communications Systems
In 1998, the International Telecommunication Union—Radiocommunication 
(ITU-R) outlined the use of the 402–405-MHz frequency band for Medical Implant 
Communications Systems (MICS) (ITU-R 1998). The MICS band is currently 
regulated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) (MICS Federal 
Register 1999) and the European Radiocommunications Committee (ERC 1997) 
and is expected to become a true global standard within several years. Two fields of 
application are indicated for this standard: communication between an implantable 
medical device and an exterior receiving station and communication between medi-
cal devices implanted within the same human body. MICS devices can use up to 
300 kHz of bandwidth at a time for the complete session. Equivalently, separate 
transmitter and receiver bands, each with a bandwidth of 300 kHz, may be adopted 
as long as they are not used simultaneously. The range is typically 2 m, and the maxi-
mum power limit is set to 25 μW of equivalent radiated power (ERP).
14.4.1.2 Wireless Medical Telemetry Service
The FCC has allocated the frequency bands of 608–614, 1395–1400, and 
1427–1432 MHz for wireless medical telemetry service (WMTS) in the United 
States (FCC 2003). These bands are very advantageous for biomedical telem-
etry because they allow a relatively large bandwidth for communication (e.g., 
four 1.5-MHz-wide channels are allowed in the 608–614-MHz WMTS band). 
Furthermore, WMTS bands are solely reserved for biomedical telemetry, meaning 
that medical devices which operate at these frequencies are protected from interfer-
ence caused by other sources. However, there is currently no indication that the 
WMTS bands would be allotted in other parts of the world, meaning that devices 
cannot be marketed or used freely in countries other than the United States.
14.4.1.3 Industrial, Scientific and Medical
The industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands were originally reserved interna-
tionally for noncommercial use of radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. They 
are defined by the ITU-R, but individual countries’ use of the bands differs due to 
variations in national radio regulations. The 902–928 and 2400.0–2483.5-MHz fre-
quency bands are used in the United States and are defined by the FCC, whereas the 
European countries use the 433.1–434.8 and 868.0–868.6-MHz frequency bands, 
which are defined by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC). The ISM 
bands offer users the advantage of increased bandwidth, thus enabling video and voice 
transmissions. Furthermore, since government approval is not required, the ISM bands 
are nowadays used by a wide variety of commercial standards. However, the ISM bands 
are not exclusive to biomedical telemetry equipment, meaning that transmission of 
sensitive medical data in these bands is susceptible to interference from other devices.

498 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
14.4.1.4 Ultrawide Band
Ultrawide Band (UWB) systems are spread-spectrum communication systems or, 
equivalently, systems in which the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is consider-
ably wider than the frequency content of the original information. More specifically, 
UWB is defined by the FCC as any communication system which has a spectral 
occupation of greater than 20% or occupies an instantaneous bandwidth of more 
than 500 MHz. The band of 3.1–10.6 GHz, which has been authorized by the FCC 
for unlicensed use, is nowadays receiving the most attention by standardization bod-
ies. Extremely short pulses are transmitted, and high data rates are thus achieved. 
Despite the fact that UWB medical devices are currently only allowed in the United 
States and Singapore, regulatory efforts are already underway in Europe and Japan.
14.4.2 Patient Safety
Before medical devices can be widely accepted, the public needs to be convinced of 
their safety (Psathas et al. 2014). People’s perception of electromagnetic radiation is 
generally fearful and safety standards need to be established in order to quantify bio-
logical damage and preserve patient safety. It was not until recently that research on the 
biological effects of medical devices with telemetry functionalities started being car-
ried out. The approach that is currently in use for establishing such safety standards is 
through animal experimentation (Johnson and Guy 1972). The actual fields, current 
density, and absorbed energy density which cause biological damage inside the tissues 
of the animal are recorded and further extrapolated to human beings. The specific 
absorption rate (SAR), which is defined as the rate of energy deposited per unit mass 
of tissue, is generally accepted as the most appropriate dosimetric measure. Limits for 
the United States and Europe are based on recommendations from the IEEE (IEEE 
1999) and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP 1998), respectively. Actual regulations may vary according to the scenario 
under study and legislation of each country. Device manufacturers must ensure that 
their products do not introduce higher SAR values than the specified limits. This 
is most commonly accomplished through in vivo experimental investigations or 
numerical computations. It is worth noting that the actual SAR values are not only 
determined by the medical device itself, but also depend on any device in the close 
vicinity of the human body that could influence the fields inside the human tissues. 
Furthermore, increasing the power incident in the medical device to improve its com-
munication range may result in the device exceeding the regulations for maximum 
power absorption inside the body and must be taken into account by manufacturers.
14.4.3 Biocompatibility
Biocompatibility plays a key role in the development of implantable and ingestible 
devices and is an important input requirement for their design. Such devices must 
be biocompatible in order to preserve patient safety and prevent rejection of the 

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 499
implant. Furthermore, human tissues are conductive and would short circuit the 
implantable or ingestible components if they were allowed to be in direct contact 
with their metallization. Biocompatibility and prevention of undesirable short cir-
cuits are especially significant in the case of devices that are intended for long-term 
implantation. It is important to highlight that medical devices consist of a variety of 
materials. Therefore, in order to assess the biocompatibility of the device, one must 
consider the applied materials one by one as well as the complete medical device as 
a whole. Furthermore, biocompatibility of a medical device depends on the time 
that it is exposed to the human body as well as its specific location inside the body. 
In any case, the designer of the medical device is responsible for its biocompatibility 
and safety, rather than the physician.
14.4.4 Commercial Products
A number of commercial wireless medical devices have already been reported and 
indicative examples are summarized next (Nikita 2014). Ultra-lightweight, flex-
ible and disposable skin patches, no thicker than ordinary adhesive bandages, are 
combined with Gentag NFC wearable sensors to simplify diagnostics, fitness, dia-
betes monitoring, and drug delivery. Using proprietary ASICs (application-specific 
integrated circuits), Gentag can custom design and license its wearable patch tech-
nology for a wide array of consumer or medical applications, which can be created 
to be entirely battery-free, that is, passive, powered only by NFC (Gentag 2011, 
Figure 14.10).
Moreover, GE Healthcare has introduced a smartphone-size imaging tool, 
known as the VScan, which lets physicians carry ultrasound technology in their 
pockets (GE Healthcare 2009). Biotronik has recently proposed a small battery-
powered electrical impulse generator to be implanted in patients who are at risk 
of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia 
(Biotronik 2012). Enhanced with Advanced Patient Management, Biotronik pro-
vides the cornerstones for comprehensive patient protection and care. The Medtronic

500 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
Adapta with MVP pacing system offers managed ventricular pacing (MVP), atrial 
therapy, ventricular capture, and remote cardiac telemetry (Medtronic 2010), 
whereas the Medtronic Revo MRI SureScan pacing system is magnetic resonance 
(MR) conditional designed to allow patients to undergo MRI under the specified 
conditions of use (Medtronic 2011, Figure 14.11).
The Nucleus Freedom cochlear implant includes a sound processor which is worn 
behind the ear and a cochlear implant which is placed under the skin, behind the 
ear (Cochlear 2010). The sound processor captures sounds, digitizes them, and sends 
the digital code to the implant. The implant converts the coded sound to electrical 
impulses and sends them along an electrode array to further stimulate the cochlea’s 
hearing nerve. Hearing may be managed via a remote assistant or directly from the 
sound processor. Furthermore, The Medtronic SynchroMed II Pump is a drug infu-
sion system which provides precise drug delivery for chronic therapy of severe spasticity 
(Medtronic 2012). Another commercial product intended to provide visual perception 
in blind individuals is Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. It includes a miniature video 
camera, a transmitter mounted on a pair of eyeglasses, a video processing unit, and a 
60-electrode implanted retinal prosthesis that replaces the function of degenerated cells 
in the retina. Although it does not fully restore vision, it can improve a patient’s ability 
to perceive images and movement (Second Sight 2012, Figure 14.12).
Commercial ingestible medical devices are used for gastrointestinal (GI) endos-
copy and sensing of physiological parameters within the GI (pH, temperature, 
pressure), which allow for direct and noninvasive examination of the GI tract. Up 
until 2007, wireless endoscopic capsules were only developed by Given Imaging 
(Given Imaging 2012a). The vitamin-sized capsule (PillCam) provides a way to

visualize, monitor, and diagnose small-bowel abnormalities including abnormali-
ties associated with obscure GI bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, and Crohn’s 
disease. After 2007, other companies, made significant improvements in their 
own endoscopic capsules. The Olympus Endocapsule is a small-bowel endoscopy 
system that travels through the small intestine via normal muscle contractions, 
taking thousands of pictures that are transmitted to a recorder worn around the 
waist (Olympus 2012). The IntroMedic MiroCam is a capsule endoscope based 
upon HBC (human body communication), a state-of-the-art patented technol-
ogy utilizing the human body as a communication medium (Intromedic 2012). 
Apart from capsules used for visualization, monitoring and diagnosis of small-
bowel abnormalities, there are also capsules with integrated sensing technologies 
for monitoring physiological parameters within the GI tract. For example, the 
Bravo pH Monitoring System is a catheter-free way to measure pH (Medtronic 
2010). By using a miniature pH capsule attached to the esophagus, pH data from 
the esophagus can be wirelessly transmitted to a small recorder worn on a shoulder

measures pressure, pH and temperature as it travels through the gastrointestinal 
(GI) tract to assess GI motility (Given Imaging 2012b, Figure 14.13).
14.5 Integrated m-Health Systems
A variety of integrated systems based on the use of wearable, implantable and 
ingestible devices have been developed for a series of applications (Kwasnicki and 
Yang 2014). These applications range from wireless capsule endoscopy, to gait 
assessment, nerve stimulation, fall detection and chronic disease management 
(Bourbakis and Karargyris 2014; Cancela et al. 2014; Cela et al. 2014; Fioravanti 
et al. 2014; Hao and Foster 2014). In this section, some characteristic examples 
of recently reported m-Health systems are briefly presented and discussed. By no 
means is this list exhaustive; the goal is to provide some insights in the directions 
followed by current studies toward the introduction of wireless communications, 
mobile computing and sensing technologies in today’s health care.
An interactive m-Health system (ImHS) to establish two-way communication 
between long term diabetic patients and caregivers by utilizing IoT technology has been 
recently reported (Chang et al. 2016). The system consists of three devices: a General 
Packet Radio Service (GPRS) blood-glucose monitor (BGM), a telecare Android/
iOS application for caregivers, and a cloud server platform that integrates the system’s 
main functions. Via the GPRS BGM, the ImHS collects patient information—such 
as blood-glucose values and measurement scenarios and times (before/after meals, 
before/after activity, at night, and so on)—and uploads it to a cloud server in XML 
format via the GPRS protocol. The collected data are used to detect abnormal blood-
glucose levels through a set of rules and procedures developed based on discussions 
with doctors and relevant publications by the World Health Organization (WHO).

As each patient’s health condition is unique, the system allows patients to customize 
the system’s detection parameters based on their doctor’s suggestions. Subsequently, the 
ImHS will analyze this information to determine the patient’s health status. According 
to the determined status, the system will automatically execute appropriate actions, 
such as sending a message to the GPRS BGM. Moreover, in a scenario in which a 
patient’s health status is critical, the ImHS will automatically notify the patient’s care-
givers through the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Future 
improvements include advanced functionalities for critical health case situations, such 
as patient location tracking through GPS.
A novel wearable sensor system called Smart Wristlet, which can provide 24 hours 
fall detection service has been presented in Li et al. (2014). A fall accident is the lead-
ing cause of accidental injury and death for the elderly people (Tamura et al. 2009). 
For persons older than 85%, 86% of their injuries are from fall accidents. The system 
uses a 3-layer function architecture as depicted in Figure 14.14. Smart Wristlet is 
designed to sense user’s activities in a noninvasive way using embedded sensors to 
monitor movement parameters as well as physiological data. A machine-perception 
based fall detection algorithm was developed to ensure reliability and practicability. 
Due to the high efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm, Smart Wristlet achieves fall 
detection precision as high as 93%, which is 3% higher than conventional methods.

504 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
More importantly, by simplifying the computational complexity and sensor data, the 
battery life is extended by more than 30%. This way, long-time and uninterrupted 
m-Health services in real applications can be ensured. For instance, with pop-up 
airbags on the user’s body, Smart Wristlet can trace user’s activity and pop-up the 
airbags to protect him/her when a fall event is detected. Furthermore, automated 
remote emergency alerting for elderly fall can be incorporated to the system since old 
people usually are not able to call for help in case they fall and get injured. Taking 
into consideration that only in the United States, elderly falls cause around 8 billion 
dollars direct medical costs each year (Carroll et al. 2005), Smart Wristlet targets to 
save more than 800 million dollars per year in a socio-economic level.
An end-to-end m-Health system for screening and management of noncommu-
nicable diseases (NCDs) has been developed (Clifford et al. 2014). Cardiovascular 
diseases (CVD) account for most NCD-related deaths, followed by cancers, respi-
ratory diseases, and diabetes (Lim 2012). Combined, NCDs are related to 80% of 
deaths, and studies show the risk factors include tobacco, alcohol, high blood pres-
sure, diet, and physical inactivity (Habib and Saha 2010). The system includes sim-
ple, low-cost ($5–$20) and open-source hardware peripherals that allow a minimally 
trained person to collect high-quality medical data at the point-of-care through a 
standard smartphone. The data can be reliably transmitted even in the case of high 
latency network connections and stored into a web-based system that manages the 
Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) of the patients, making these records accessible 
anywhere. The novel, low-cost sensors used (semiautomatic blood pressure monitor, 
three lead ECG, spirometer) are connected as USB peripherals in the smartphone. 
Signal analysis software running on Android smartphones has been developed, guid-
ing an untrained user through the data acquisition. Server software to allow crowd 
sourcing of diagnostics in order to improve accuracy and learning has been also 
developed. The system is fully scalable, with an open architecture to allow the addi-
tion of decision support and analysis algorithms on the back end, and peripherals 
and mobile phone-based software on the front end (Figure 14.15).
A smartphone based system for remote real-time tele-monitoring of physical 
activity has been used in a pilot study with actual patients suffering from chronic-
heart-failure (CHF) (Aranki et al. 2016). Patient’s physical activity and vital signs 
data during everyday activities are being collected via a smartphone and reported 
to a central server. Global position system (GPS) is also used to track outdoor 
activity and measure walking distance. The system is designed to assess patient 
activity via minute-by-minute energy expenditure estimated by accelerometry, 
self-reported vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and weight), and relevant 
cardiovascular symptoms (fatigue, activity, dizziness, shortness of breath, etc.). 
The collected data are securely transmitted to a server where they are analyzed in 
real-time. This way, medical staff can monitor patient status and provide medical 
intervention if necessary. Future plans include privacy enhancements as well as 
battery lifetime extension through delegation of computation procedures from 
the smartphone to the server. Conclusions elicited by this study can be applied to 

Emerging Technologies for Mobile Health ◾ 505
other chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, which would 
also benefit from continuous monitoring through m-Health technologies.
14.6 Future Challenges and Opportunities
Current challenges in mobile health care technologies are related to several factors. 
To begin with, there is the issue of extended power supply lifetimes that can be 
achieved using energy scavenging techniques that utilize the inner workings of the 
body (Tentzeris et al. 2014). For example, glucose fuel cells (Zebda et al. 2013), and 
electrochemical gradients are some emerging techniques (Mercier et al. 2012). These 
systems show strong potential as new energy sources, but their large area (fuel cells) 
or extremely low energy density (electrochemical gradients) means these technologies 
need to be further developed before a complete system with a practical data acquisi-
tion rate can be built upon them. Furthermore, the majority of power consumption 
budget is dedicated to wireless communications (Ntouni et al. 2014); ultrawideband 
transceivers and energy-efficient data compression algorithms can be used to address 
this issue (Chin et al. 2012). Also, delegation of computation hungry procedures from

management. Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC), 2014 IEEE, 
pp. 41–48, 2014.)

506 ◾ New Directions in Wireless Communications Systems
mobile devices to servers can contribute in power consumption reduction (Aranki 
et al. 2016). In the context of implantable sensors, biocompatibility poses a significant 
factor. Use of biocompatible materials and careful design of the device are required to 
avoid traumatizing human tissues and ensuring functionality. Also, it is important to 
protect the privacy of data collected and disseminated by health care-related technolo-
gies. Complex security mechanisms can be used, but since they require more compu-
tational and power resources, a trade-off is crucial (Bourbakis et al. 2014). Currently, 
most of the health care related technology is developed on-demand. Using dynamic 
programming environments and cognitive surfaces we should be able to measure mul-
tiple parameters in the human body and use this data to aid in preventive medicine 
diagnosis. Of course there is always the computational and economic perspective, 
since the cost and size of health care technologies impose limitations on their use. To 
conclude, m-Health is a highly interdisciplinary field, therefore generating innovative 
ideas demands the widest possible participation and a culture that appreciates the 
notion that not all ideas will succeed (Modi and Mohanty 2015).
