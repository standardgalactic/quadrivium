Introduction
W
 
elcome! Thank you for selecting this book. We assume you’ve done 
so because you’re hoping it will explain how to use Microsoft Access 
2016, and of course, as the authors, we believe this was a wise decision. We, 
the authors, base this belief on the fact that both of us have been teaching 
and using Access for a very long time, and we know how to share what we 
know with our students.
So what was it that made you seek out a book on Access? It might be that 
you’ve been asked to use it at work, or perhaps you run your own business 
or are managing a non-profit organization. If any of these is the case – or if 
you’re just a regular human with a lot of personal contacts and irons in the 
fire, you need Access to organize your data. You need it so you can find a 
name or a transaction in seconds after a few keystrokes, not after minutes 
spent leafing through your files or swiping apps this way and that on your 
smartphone. You need it so you can produce reports that make you look like 
the genius you are. You need it so you can create cool forms that will help 
your staff enter all the data you’ve got stacked on their desks — and in a way 
that lets you know the data was entered properly so that it’s accurate and 
useful. You need Access so you can find little bits of data out of the huge pool 
of information you need to store. So that’s it. You just need it.
About This Book
With all the power that Access has (and that it therefore gives you), there 
comes a small price: complexity. Access isn’t one of those applications you 
can just sit down and use “right out of the box.” It’s not scarily difficult or 
anything, but there’s a lot going on — and you need some guidance, some 
help, and some direction to really use it and make it bend to your will. And 
that’s where this book — a “reference for the rest of us” — comes in.
So you’ve picked up this book. Hang on to it. Clutch it to your chest and run 
gleefully from the store, or click the Add to Shopping Cart button and sit back 
with an expression of satisfaction and accomplishment on your face, because 
you’ve done a smart thing (if we don’t say so ourselves). When you get home, 
or when the book arrives in person (or when you download it to your hand-
held device), start reading — whether you begin with Chapter 1 or whether 
you dive in and start with a particular feature or area of interest that’s been 
giving you fits. Just read, and then go put Access to work for you.

Foolish Assumptions
You need to know only a few things about your computer and Windows to

grams, save your files, create folders, find your files once you’ve saved

Icons Used in This Book
When something in this book is particularly valuable, we go out of our way to 
make sure that it stands out. We use these cool icons to mark text that (for 
one reason or another) really needs your attention. Here’s a quick preview of 
the ones waiting for you in this book and what they mean.
Tips are incredibly helpful words of wisdom that promise to save you time, 
energy, and the embarrassment of being caught swearing out loud while you 
think you’re alone. Whenever you see a tip, take a second to check it out.
Some things are too important to forget, so the Remember icon points them 
out. These items are critical steps in a process — points that you don’t 
want to miss.
Sometimes we give in to the techno-geek lurking inside us and slip some 
technical babble into the book. The Technical Stuff icon protects you from 
obscure details by making them easy to avoid. On the other hand, you may 
find them interesting. (Your inner techno-geek will rejoice.)

ccess 2016, the most recent version of the Microsoft Office database 
application, continues to be a very powerful program. You probably 
already know that, and perhaps that power is what made you choose Access 
for managing your data and to also reach for this book. Great decisions so far!
For all of its power, Access is pretty friendly to new users. In fact, with just 
the basic functionality that you’ll discover in this book, you’ll be able to put 
Access through many of its most important paces, yet you’ll be working with 
wizards and other onscreen tools that keep you at a comfortable arm’s dis-
tance from the software’s inner workings, the things that programmers and 
serious developers play with. There. Don’t you feel better now?
You don’t have to use every feature and tool and push the edges of the 
Access envelope. In fact, you can use very little of everything Access has to 
offer and still create quite a significant solution to your needs for storing and 
accessing data — all because Access can really “do it all” — enabling you 
to set up a database quickly, build records into that database, and then use 
that data in several useful ways. Later on, who knows? You may become an 
Access guru.
In this chapter, you’ll discover what Access does best (and when you might 
want to use another tool instead), and you’ll get a look at what’s new and 
improved in Access 2016 (compared to Access 2013). You’ll see how it does 
what it does, and hopefully you’ll begin to understand and absorb some basic 
terminology.

Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
Now, don’t panic; nobody’s expecting you to memorize tons of complex 
vocabulary or anything scary like that. The goal here (and in the next two 
chapters) with regard to terms is to introduce you to some basic words and 
general concepts intended to help you make better use of Access — as well 
as better understand later chapters in this book, if you choose to follow us all 
the way to its stunning, life-altering conclusion.
What Is Access Good For, Anyway?
What is Access good for? That’s a good question. Well, the list of what you 
can do with it is a lot longer than the list of what you can’t do with it — of 
course, especially if you leave things like “wash your car” and “put away the 
dishes” off the “can’t do” list. When it comes to data organization, storage, 
and retrieval, Access is at the head of the class.
Building big databases
Okay, what do I mean by big database? Any database with a lot of records — 
and by a lot, I mean hundreds. At least. And certainly if you have thousands 
of records, you need a tool like Access to manage them. Although you can 
use Microsoft Excel to store lists of records, it limits how many you can store 
(no more than the number of rows in a single worksheet). In addition, you 
can’t use Excel to set up anything beyond a simple list that can be sorted 
and filtered. So anything with a lot of records and complex data is best done 
in Access.
Some reasons why Access handles big databases well are
✓
✓Typically, a big database has big data-entry needs. Access offers not 
only forms but also features that can create a quick form through which 
someone can enter all those records. This can make data entry easier 
and faster and can reduce the margin of error significantly. (Check out 
Chapter 8 for more about building forms.)
✓
✓When you have lots and lots of records, you also have lots of oppor-
tunities for errors to creep in. This includes duplicate records, records 
with misspellings, and records with missing information — and that’s 
just for openers. So you need an application such as Access to ferret out 
those errors and fix them. (Chapter 10 lays out how you can use Access 
to find and replace errors and search for duplicate entries.)
✓
✓Big databases mean big needs for accurate, insightful reporting. 
Access has powerful reporting tools you can use to create printed and 

9

 Chapter 1: Access 2016 Basic Training
onscreen reports — and those can include as few or as many pieces 
of your data as you need, drawn from more than one table if need be. 
You can tailor your reports to your audience, from what’s shown on the 
reports pages to the colors and fonts used.
✓
✓Big databases are hard to wade through when you want to find some-
thing. Access provides several tools for sorting, searching, and creating 
your own specialized tools (known as queries) for finding the elusive 
single record or group of records you need.
✓
✓Access saves time by making it easy to import and recycle data. You 
may have used certain tools to import data from other sources — such 
as Excel worksheets (if you started in Excel and maxed out its useful-
ness as a data-storage device) and Word tables. Access saves you from 
reentering all your data and allows you to keep multiple data sources 
consistent.
Building apps
There are several ways to build apps — a term that’s come to mean an 
application that runs on a smartphone or tablet — but that also applies to 
SharePoint, with Access 2016.
You can build an app using the Access 2016 Web App template or build a 
custom web app, starting from scratch. You can download an app from the 
Office Store and then customize it. You can also build a standard database, 
just like you always have in Access, and publish that via the web.
Now, that said, this is not a book about apps or building them. The goal of 
this book is to show you how to use Access to build databases for use on a 
computer (a desktop or laptop/notebook). If you need to create a database 
app for use on a smartphone or tablet, you can take a look at Dummies.com  
or check out iOS 6 Application Development For Dummies, published by 
Wiley, or explore instructions available online by Googling How do I create a 
database app with Access 2016.
Creating databases with multiple tables
Whether your database holds 100 records or 100,000 records (or more), if 
you need to keep separate tables and relate them for maximum use of the 
information, you need a relational database — and that’s Access. How do you 

10
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
know whether your data needs to be in separate tables? Think about your 
data — is it very compartmentalized? Does it go off on tangents? Consider the 
following example and apply the concepts to your data and see if you need 
multiple tables for your database.
The Big Organization database
Imagine you work for a very large company, and the company has data per-
taining to their customers and their orders, the products the company sells, 
its suppliers, and its employees. For a complex database like this one, you 
need multiple tables, as follows:
✓
✓One table houses the customer data — names, addresses, phone num-
bers, and email addresses.
✓
✓A second table contains the customers’ orders, including the name of 
the customer who placed the order, the salesperson who handled the 
sale, shipping information, and the date of the order.
✓
✓A third table contains information on the products the company sells, 
including product numbers, supplier names, prices, and the number of 
items in stock. 
✓
✓A fourth table contains supplier data — about the companies from 
which the main organization obtains its inventory of products to resell 
to customers. The table contains the company names, their contact 
person, and the address, email, and phone number information to 
reach them.
✓
✓A fifth table contains employees’ data — from the date they were hired 
to their contact information to their job title — and also contains notes 
about them, sort of a summary of their resumes for reference.
Other tables exist, too — to keep a list of shipping companies and their con-
tact information (for shipping customer orders), an expense table (for the 
expenses incurred in running the business), and other tables that are used 
with the main four tables. The need for and ways to use the main tables and 
these additional tables are covered later in this book, as you find out how to 
set up tools for data entry, look up records, and create reports that provide 
varying levels of detail on all the data you’ve stored.
Because you don’t have to fill in every field for each record — in any table 
in the database — if you don’t have a phone number or don’t know an 
email address, for example, it’s okay to leave those fields blank until you’ve 
obtained that information.
Fail to plan? Plan to fail
If you think carefully about your database, how you use your data, and what 
you need to know about your employees, customers, volunteers, donors, 

11

 Chapter 1: Access 2016 Basic Training
products, or projects — whatever you’re storing information about — 
you can plan
✓
✓How many tables you’ll need
✓
✓Which data will go into which table
✓
✓How you’ll use the tables together to get the reports you need
Of course, everyone forgets something, and plans change after a system 
has already been implemented. But don’t worry — Access isn’t so rigid that 
chaos will ensue if you begin building your tables and forget something (a 
field or two, an entire table). You can always add a field that you forgot (or 
that some bright spark just told you is needed) or add a new table after the 
fact. But planning ahead as thoroughly as possible is still essential.
As part of thorough planning, sketch your planned database on paper, draw-
ing a kind of flowchart with boxes for each table and lists of fields that you’ll 
have in each one. Draw arrows to show how they might be related — it’s sort 
of like drawing a simple family tree — and you’re well on your way to a well-
planned, useful database.
Here’s a handy procedure to follow if you’re new to the process of planning 
a database:
1.	On paper or in a word-processing document, whichever is more com-
fortable, type the following:
•	A tentative name for your database
•	A list of the pieces of information you plan on getting from that 
database on a daily or regular basis
2.	Now, based on that information, create a new list of the actual details 
you could store:
List every piece of information you can possibly think of about your 
customers, products, ideas, cases, books, works of art, students — 
whatever your database pertains to. Don’t be afraid to go overboard — 
you can always skip some of the items in the list if they don’t turn out to 
be things you really need to know (or can possibly find out) about each 
item in your database.
3.	Take the list of fields — that’s what all those pieces of information 
are — and start breaking them up into logical groups.
How? Think about the fields and how they work together:
•	For example, if the database keeps track of a library of books, 
perhaps the title, publication date, publisher, ISBN (International 
Standard Book Number, which is unique for each book), price, and 

12
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
page count can be stored in one group, whereas author information, 
reviews, and lists of other titles by the same author or books on the 
same topic can be stored in another group. These groups become 
individual tables, creating your relational database of books.
•	Figure out what’s unique about each record. As stated in the previ-
ous point, you need a field that’s unique for each record. Although 
Access can create a unique value for you if no unique data exists 
for each record in your database, it’s often best to have such a 
field already in place, or to create such a field yourself. Customer 
numbers, student numbers, Social Security numbers, book ISBNs, 
catalog numbers, serial numbers — anything that isn’t the same 
for any two records will do.
With a big list of fields and some tentative groupings of those fields at 
the ready, and with an idea of which field is unique for each record, you 
can begin figuring out how to use the data.
4.	Make a list of ways you might use the data, including
•	Reports you’d like to create, including a list of which fields should 
be included for each report
•	Other ways you can use the data — labels for mailings, product 
labels, catalogue data, price lists, contact lists, and so on
5.	List all the places your data currently resides. This might be on slips 
of paper in your pocket, on cards in a box, in another program (such 
as Excel), or maybe through a company that sells data for marketing 
­purposes.
With this planning done, you’re ready to start building your database. The 
particulars of that process come later in this chapter and in subsequent 
chapters, so don’t jump in yet. Do pat yourself on the back, though, because 
if you’ve read this procedure and applied even some of it to your potential 
database, you’re way ahead of the game, and we’re confident you’ll make 
good use of all that Access has to offer.
Databases with user forms
When you’re planning your database, consider how the data will be entered:
✓
✓If you’ll be doing the data entry yourself, perhaps you’re comfort-
able working in a spreadsheet-like environment (known in Access as 
Datasheet view), where the table is a big grid. You fill it in row by row, 
and each row is a record.

13

 Chapter 1: Access 2016 Basic Training
Figure 1‑1 shows a table of volunteers in progress in Datasheet view. You 
decide: Is it easy to use, or can you picture yourself forgetting to move 
down a row and entering the wrong stuff in the wrong columns as you 
enter each record? As you can see, there are more fields than show in 
the window, so you’d be doing a lot of scrolling to the left and right to 
use this view.
✓
✓You may want to use a form (shown in Figure 1‑2) instead. A form is a 
specialized interface for data entry, editing, and viewing your database 
one record at a time, if
•	Someone else will be handling data entry
•	Typing row after row of data into a big grid seems mind-numbing
The mind-numbing effect (and inherent increased margin for error) is espe-
cially likely when you have lots of fields in a database, and the user, if work-
ing in Datasheet view, has to move horizontally through the fields. A form 
like the one in Figure 1‑2 puts the fields in a more pleasing format, making it 
easier to enter data into the fields and to see all the fields simultaneously (or 
only those you want data entered into).
Figure 1-1:  
Datasheet 
view can

environment 
for data 
entry. Or 
not.

14
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
You find out all about forms in Chapter 8. If your database is large enough 
that you require help doing the data entry, or if it’s going to grow over time, 
making an ongoing data-entry process likely, Access is the tool for you. The 
fact that it offers simple forms of data entry/editing is reason enough to make 
it your database application of choice.
Databases that require special reporting
Yet another reason to use Access is the ability it gives you to create custom-
ized reports quickly and easily. Some database programs, especially those 
designed for single-table databases (known as flat-file databases), have some 
canned reports built in, and that’s all you can do — just select a report from 
the list and run the same report that every other user of that software runs.
If you’re an Excel user, your reporting capabilities are far from easy or simple, 
and they’re not designed for use with large databases — they’re meant for 
spreadsheets and small, one-table lists. Furthermore, you have to dig much 
deeper into Excel’s tools to get at these reports. Access, on the other hand, is 
a database application, so reporting is a major, up-front feature.
Figure 1-2:  
Here’s a 
simple form 
for entering 
new records 
or ­reviewing 
existing 
ones.

15

 Chapter 1: Access 2016 Basic Training
An example? In Excel, to get a report that groups your data by one or more 
of the fields in your list, you have to sort the rows in the worksheet first, 
using the field(s) to sort the data, and then you can create what’s known as a 
subtotal report. To create it, you use a dialog box that asks you about calcula-
tions you want to perform, where to place the results, and whether you’re 
basing a sort and/or a subtotal on more than one field. The resulting report 
is not designed for printing, and you have to tinker with your spreadsheet 
pagination (through a specialized view of the spreadsheet) to control how 
the report prints out.
In Access? Just fire up the Report Wizard, and you can sort your data, choose 
how to group it, decide which pieces of data to include in the report, and 
pick a visual layout and color scheme, all in one simple, streamlined process. 
Without you doing anything, the report is ready for printing. Access is built 
for reporting — after all, it is a database application — and reports are one of 
the most (if not the most) important ways you’ll use and share your data.
Because reports are such an important part of Access, you can not only 
create them with minimum fuss but also customize them to create powerful 
documentation of your most important data:
✓
✓Build a quick, simple report that just spits out whatever is in your table 
in a tidy, easy-to-read format. (See Figure 1‑3 for an example.)
Figure 1-3:  
Ah, 
­simplicity. A 
quick report 
is just one 
click away.

16
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
✓
✓Create a customized report that you design step-by-step with the help of 
the Report Wizard. (See Figure 1‑4.) The report shown in the figure has 
the volunteers sorted by their status. These options were easily put to 
work with just a few clicks.
✓
✓You can really roll up your sleeves and design a new report, or play with 
an existing one, adding all sorts of bells and whistles. Figure 1‑5 shows 
this happening in Design view. Note that the report’s title (Volunteers 
List by Status) is selected: It has a box around it and tiny handles on the 
corners and sides of the box, which means you can reformat the title, 
change the font, size, or color of the text, or even edit the words if a new 
title is needed.
So, you can create any kind of custom report in Access, using any or all of 
your database tables and any of the fields from those tables, and you can 
group fields and place them in any order you want:
✓
✓With the Report Wizard, you can choose from several preset layouts 
for your report, and you can customize all of it row by row, column 
by column.


 Chapter 1: Access 2016 Basic Training
✓
✓You can easily add and remove fields after creating the report, should 
you change your mind about what’s included in the report. If you want 
to place your personal stamp on every aspect of your report, you can 
use Design view to do the following:
•	Add titles, instructional or descriptive text boxes, and graphics.
•	Set up customized headers and footers to include any information 
you want to appear on all the report’s pages.
If all this sounds exciting, or at least interesting, then you’re really on the 
right track with Access. The need to create custom reports is a major 
reason to use Access; you can find out about all these reporting options in 
Chapters 18 through 21. That’s right: This chapter plus three more — that’s 
four whole chapters — are devoted to reporting. It must be a big feature 
in Access!
What’s New in Access 2016?
For users of Access 2007, 2010, or 2013, the upgrade to 2016 won’t seem like a 
big deal, other than the changes to the fonts used on the ribbons, the change 
to a white background for the ribbons, database tabs, and the All Access 
Objects panel on the left side of the workspace — but these are purely 
­cosmetic changes.
Figure 1-5:  
Design 
view might 
look a little 
intimidating, 
but to really 
customize 
things, you’ll 
need it — 
and you 
might even 
enjoy it!

18
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
If you’re coming from 2003, the biggest changes are found in the interface. 
Gone are the familiar menus and toolbars of 2003 and prior versions, now 
replaced by a ribbon bar divided into tabs that take you to different versions 
of those old standbys. It’s a big change, and it takes some getting used to.
In this book, however, we’re going to assume you already got your feet wet 
with 2007, 2010, or 2013 and aren’t thrown by the interface anymore. We’re 
figuring you upgraded to 2010 or 2013 or have played with one or both of 
them enough to feel comfortable diving into 2016.
Reach out with SharePoint
What the heck is SharePoint? Even if your company isn’t using it yet, you’ve no 
doubt been seeing the product name and hearing how it provides the ability 
to see and use your Access data from anywhere — using desktop applications, 
a web browser, or even your phone. And in truth, it’s Microsoft’s software 
product that does all that and more, helping you manage your documents 
and collaborate with coworkers via the company network. Simply click the 
Save Database As command in the File tab’s panel (see Figure 1‑6), and you’re 
on your way to publishing your database to SharePoint, which means you 
can access it from pretty much everywhere, including that beach in Maui. Of 
course, if you or your company don’t have a SharePoint server, you won’t 
be able to make use of this, and you don’t need to concern yourself with 
this section.

­saving your

19

 Chapter 1: Access 2016 Basic Training
As shown in Figure 1‑6, the Save As options include regular old Save Database 
As, to save your existing database with a new name or in some format other 
than as an Access database; and Save Object As, to save a table, form, query, 
or report with a new name. You can also choose from several Advanced 
options to save the database as a package (to distribute your Access applica-
tions) or as an executable file (a single file that when run by the recipient, 
opens a database application), to back up the database, and to use the afore-
mentioned SharePoint.
How Access Works and  
How You Work with It
When you look at all the applications in Microsoft Office — Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, Outlook, and of course, Access — you’ll see some features that 
are consistent throughout the suite. There are big differences, too, and that’s 
where books like this one come in handy, helping you deal with what’s differ-
ent and not terribly obvious to a new user.
Access has several features in common with the rest of the applications in 
the Microsoft Office suite. You’ll find the same buttons on several of the tabs, 
and the Quick Access Toolbar (demonstrated in Chapter 2) appears in all the 
applications.
If you already know how to open, save, and print in, say, Word, you’re prob-
ably ready to do the same things in Access without any difficulty.
To make sure you’re totally Access-ready, here’s a look at the basic proce-
dures that can give you a solid foundation on which to build.
Opening Access
Access opens in any one of several ways. So, like a restaurant with a very 
comprehensive menu, some people will love all the choices, and others will 
say, “I can’t decide! There are just too many options to choose from!”
Now, you’ll run into situations in which one of the ways is the glaringly best 
choice — hands down, and that one will be the way to go. But what if you’ve 
never heard of it? You’ll be trying to find my phone number (I’m unlisted — 
ha!) so you can give me a piece of your mind. So to acquaint you with all your 

20
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
choices (so you’ll be ready for any situation), here are all the ways you can 
open Access:
✓
✓Windows 7 users can click the Start menu button (in the lower left 
corner of the screen) and choose All Programs  ➪  Microsoft Office 
2016  ➪  Microsoft Access 2016.
✓
✓Windows 8.1 users can utilize any of several methods to start an 
application — click the lower left corner of the screen to display the 
Start icon, press the Windows key on the keyboard, or if you have a 
touchscreen, tap the Start button. Once the Start screen appears, tap 
the Access application tile.
If you’ve recently used Access, you’ll see it in the list on the left side of 
the Start menu. Just choose Start  ➪  Microsoft Access 2016, and Access 
opens.
✓
✓Double-click any existing Access database file on your Desktop or in a 
folder (as shown in Figure 1‑7). Access opens automatically.
Good news: Access 2016 will open database files you created with pre-
vious versions of Access, and should support whatever features are 
employed within those database files. All your tables should open prop-
erly, and reports, forms, and queries should all work fine, too.

 Chapter 1: Access 2016 Basic Training
✓
✓If some helpful person has added Access to the Quick Launch toolbar 
(on the taskbar), you can click the Access 2016 icon (it looks like an A on 
the cover of a book), and there you go. Access opens for you right then 
and there.

So Access is open, and (assuming you opened it from the Start menu or from 
the Quick Launch portion of the Taskbar) you’re staring at the Access inter-
face. You may see features whose purposes elude you or that you don’t yet 
know how to use. Hey, don’t worry; that’s why you’re reading this book!
You can find out more about all the tabs and buttons, panels and menus, and 
all that fun stuff in Chapter 2. For now, just look at the ways Access offers you 
to get started with your database, be it an existing one that needs work or a 
new one you have all planned out and ready to go.
Opening an existing database
Well, this is the easy one. If a database already exists, you can open it by 
clicking the File tab (at the upper left of the workspace) and choosing Open 
from the list of commands that appears. As shown in Figure 1‑8, a panel 
opens, displaying the types of files you can open (just to the right of the long 
red File panel) and the databases you’ve most recently used. Click the word 
Recent in the list to the near left and then click the database in the Recent 
list, and it opens, listing its current tables, queries, reports, and forms on the 
far left side of the window.
When the database opens, you can open and view its various parts just by 
double-clicking them in that leftmost panel; whatever you open appears in 
the main, central part of the window. Figure 1‑9 shows an example: a table, 
ready for editing.
After you open a table, you can begin entering or editing records. You can 
read more about how that’s done in Chapter 6, which demonstrates the dif-
ferent ways to edit your data and tweak your tables’ setups. If you want to 
tinker with any existing queries, you can open these, too, just by clicking 
them in the list on the left side of the workspace. (For more information on 
queries, check out Chapters 12 and 13. You can do simple sorting and look 
for particular records with the skills you pick up in Chapters 10 and 12.)
Starting a new database from scratch
So you don’t have a database to open, eh? Well, don’t let that stop you. To 
start a new one, all you have to do is open Access, using any of the tech-
niques listed earlier in this chapter (except the one that starts Access by 
opening an existing database file, which you don’t have yet).

 Chapter 1: Access 2016 Basic Training
A database file holds all your database components. Everything associated 
with the data is part of the database, including
✓
✓All the tables that house your data
✓
✓Queries that help you search and use the data
✓
✓Reports that show what your data is and what it means
✓
✓Forms that allow people to view, enter, and edit data
After Access is open, click the New command in the File tab (if that’s not 
already the active command). From the resulting display, you can click the 
Blank Desktop Database button (shown in Figure 1‑10) to get started.
Next, give your database a name (see the dialog box that appears in 
Figure 1‑12), and click the Create button.
The X in Figure 1‑11’s caption represents a number — Access assigns con-
secutive numbers to the default names, counting from any previously created 
databases. Figure 1‑11 shows a 1 added to the filename.

If this is your absolute first database in a fresh installation of Access, the 
filename offered in this panel will be Database1. Note that you don’t need to 
type a file extension here; Access will add the correct one for you.
What is that little yellow folder in the dialog box where you named your 
new database? It allows you to choose a folder (other than the default My 
Documents folder if you’re a Windows 7 user, or the Documents folder in 
Windows 8/8.1) into which you can save your database. Click the folder icon 
after typing a name for your database, and then use the resulting File New 
Database dialog box to choose a location — an existing subfolder within 
My Documents, the Desktop, a network drive (if you’re on a network, say at 
your office), or your Office 365 Skydrive. The dialog box looks very familiar 
to anyone who’s used any Windows application, so this won’t be new terri-
tory for you.
At this point, with your new database open, you can begin entering records 
into your first table or begin naming your fields and setting them up. The 
field names go in the topmost row (the ID field is already created, by default 
in the new table), and the label Click to Add is atop the column with 
the active cell. If you choose to save your table now (right-click the Table1 
tab and choose Save), you can name your table something more useful 
than Table1.
Starting with a template
Access provides templates (prepared files that work sort of like database 
cookie cutters) for your new database needs. You’ll find a set of template 
icons in the same New panel where we just chose a Blank Desktop Database. 
As shown in Figure 1‑12, you can choose a template category by clicking any 
of the words under the Search for Online Templates search box, and search 
online for templates in that category.

25

 Chapter 1: Access 2016 Basic Training
Once the online search is complete (assuming you’re online at the time), a 
series of big buttons, one for each template found that matches your search, 
appears. Note that a larger list of categories — to be used if you want to 
search again for another category of templates — appears on the right.
Now What?
So you’ve got a new database started. What do you do now? You can leaf 
on over to Chapter 2, where you can find out more about all the tools that 
Access offers — which tools are onscreen almost all the time and which ones 
are specific to the way you chose to dig in and start that database.
In Chapter 3, you actually begin building a database, setting up tables and the 
fields that give them structure. And you figure out which tables you need to 
set up, putting that great plan you built in this chapter to work!

f you skipped Access 2007, 2010, and 2013 and are coming to Access 
2016 from the 2003 version, you’re probably surprised by the new inter-
face, which was introduced with Microsoft Office 2007. If you did upgrade 
to Access (or Office) 2007, 2010, or 2013, then the 2016 interface looks 
very familiar — and you’ll find much of it to be the same as what you’re 
­accustomed to.
For those to whom the Office 2016 interface is a big change, take note of the 
following changes to the interface, which are strikingly different from what 
you may have used in previous versions:
✓
✓Menus have given way to tabs and buttons arranged in a strip across the 
top of the screen — known as the Ribbon.
✓
✓Toolbars are no longer made up of distinct 3-D buttons. Instead, there 
are buttons and graphic examples of formatting, pictures of what the 
buttons create, and drop-down lists.
For users of Access 2007: Notice the new File tab and resulting panel. Instead 
of spawning a square menu, the button now displays the panel shown on 
the left in Figure 2‑1, where common tasks such as saving and printing are 
available. It even looks different than it did in 2010 and 2013 — so users of 
those two versions will also be surprised at the look of this panel and how it 
appears onscreen when you click the File tab.

28
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
You also see features in the center and on the sides of the workspace, which 
change depending on what you’re doing or which button you’ve clicked:
✓
✓If you’re starting a new database, options for doing so appear in the 
center pane (click New in the red panel on the left).
✓
✓If you’re working with an existing database, clicking Info (as shown in 
Figure 2‑1) displays a link to “View and edit database properties”, which 
shows you information about the open database, or to Compact & 
Repair your database, or to Encrypt with Password, to secure the data-
base with a password.
✓
✓Clicking Save, Save As, Print, and Options open dialog boxes through 
which you can perform those tasks. Options, of course, displays settings 
you can change to control how Access looks and works.
I won’t go into every possible combination of onscreen features in this 
­chapter — you get to know a lot of them in subsequent chapters. For now, I’ll 
show you the basic workspace in three states:
✓
✓When Access first opens up
✓
✓When a new database is being built, either from scratch or when you’ve 
started with one of Access’s database templates
✓
✓When you’re working on an existing database

 Chapter 2: Navigating the Access Workspace
As you read through the following sections, you can refer solely to the accom-
panying figures or, if you want, try to work along with the procedures — 
you’ll find doing what you see described here boosts your confidence when 
you’re using Access later, on your own.
Diving Right In
So you’re ready to dive in. Well done, you! It’s easy to start Access. You can 
start the application in multiple ways, accommodating nearly any situa-
tion you’re in. (Chapter 1 discusses most of them.) Whether you’re starting 
Access to view and edit an existing Access database (which gives you what 
you see in Figure 2‑2) or are about to create your own (which opens the appli-
cation and displays the list of Recent databases and template icons, shown in 
Figure 2‑3), you can get to the tools you need right away. Figure 2‑2 shows an 
existing database open to one of its tables; its other components are listed on 
the left side of the workspace.
You can open an existing database by double-clicking it by name in the 
Explorer window or from an icon on your Desktop; you can start Access from 
the Start menu in Windows 7 or the Start screen in Windows 8.1, and then 
Figure 2-2:  
Open 
Access 
and your 
existing 
database 
in one fell 
swoop.

30
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
pick which existing database you want to work with; you can start a new, 
blank database from scratch; or you can start out with one of the Access 
templates.
Figure 2‑3 shows the various template icons displayed when you choose New 
from the left-hand panel.
If you opened Access by using the Start menu or Start screen or a Desktop/
Taskbar icon and now you want to open an existing database, you can use the 
Open command in the panel on the left (see Figure 2‑4). This allows you to 
open either a recently used database or browse for one you haven’t opened 
in a while. The Open command’s list of options includes
✓
✓Recent: Shows a smaller version of the Recent list
✓
✓OneDrive: Opens your OneDrive cloud account if you have one
✓
✓This PC: Allows you to search your computer
✓
✓+Add a Place: Adds SharePoint and OneDrive locations
✓
✓Browse: Opens an Open dialog box


 Chapter 2: Navigating the Access Workspace
When you use the Recent list, clicking any one of the Recent Databases listed 
opens that sucker right up, displaying its parts on the panel on the left side of 
the workspace.
So that’s it, really — any way you want to get started is available either by 
opening the Access application from the Start menu (Windows 7) or Start 
screen (Windows 8/8.1) or an application icon, or by clicking the File tab after 
you’ve got a database open.
After you get to working, however, it’s time to use the onscreen tools that 
don’t appear until you open a database. Read on for a whirlwind tour of the 
Access workspace, including views and explanations of all the major bells, 
whistles, and buttons.
Working with Onscreen Tools in Access
When you open a database — be it an existing one or one you’re just start-
ing from a blank database or a template — the workspace changes, offering 
the Ribbon and its tabs shown in Figure 2‑5 (Home, Create, External Data, 
and Database Tools). These tabs are not to be confused with the database 
Figure 2-4:  
Open an 
existing or 
recently 
used 
­database.

32
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
components’ tabs, which appear in the center of the workspace for which-
ever tables, reports, queries, or forms you’ve chosen to open from the list 
on the left.
When the Ribbon tabs first appear, many of their buttons are dimmed — 
because they don’t become available until you’re doing something that 
warrants their use. For example, if you haven’t opened any tables, forms, 
reports, or queries in your open database, the tools for editing or formatting 
your database will appear on the tabs, but they’ll be dimmed, which 
indicates that they’re unavailable. Tools for creating new components are 
available on the Create tab, but anything that works with existing data will 
be dimmed.
After you open a table, report, query, or form, the tools for that table, 
report, query, or form become available. Displaying a form, for example, 
adds the Form Layout Tools group to the main set of five tabs, as shown in 
Figure 2‑6.
Clicking tabs
To move from one tab on the Ribbon to another, simply click the tab’s name. 
It’s easy to see which tab is currently open — as shown in Figure 2‑7, the 
Create tab is bright, and you can see all its buttons. When you mouse over 
another tab, its name turns dark red (notice the Database Tools tab in the 
figure); the active tab remains bright, though, until you click a new one, 
making that the active tab.

When you have a table open, the Home tab is displayed, and a new label — 
Table Tools — appears above the Fields and Table tabs.
Using buttons
Access buttons come in two varieties:
✓
✓Buttons that do something when they’re clicked: Either opening a 
dialog box or wizard or performing some change or task in your open 
table, report, query, or form.
✓
✓Buttons that represent lists or menus of choices: This latter variety 
comes in two flavors of its own:
•	Drop-down list buttons are accompanied by a small, down-pointing 
triangle, appearing to the button’s right. When you click the tri-
angle, a list of options appears, as shown in Figure 2‑8.
•	Some buttons have a down-pointing triangle at the bottom of the 
button (as shown in Figure 2‑9). Click the bottom half of the button 
(or on the triangle), and a menu appears.

The File tab and Quick Access tools
If you’re fresh from using a pre-2007 version of Office (XP and previous), 
you’ll be relieved to see a File tab. Office 2007 users lost that familiar word in 
that version’s interface, replaced then by an Office button, with no comfort-
ing word “File” on it. The word File came back in 2010, however, displaying 
Backstage view, for opening files, saving files, starting new files, printing, and 
customizing Access through the Options command. The File tab remains in 
Access 2016, and is shown in Figure 2‑10.

Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
When you’re in a database and click the File tab, you’re taken to the Info dis-
play, showing information about the open database.
Where’s the Quick Access Toolbar? It appears while you’re in a database, but 
it disappears when you go to the File tab. No problem; to see it again, just 
click the Back button in the File panel, and you’re back to your database, with 
the Quick Access Toolbar in the upper left of the workspace. If you want to 
customize the Quick Access Toolbar, click the triangle at the right end of the 
toolbar. It offers a pop-up menu with several choices, from Customize Quick 
Access Toolbar to Show Below the Ribbon. In between, you’ll find some of 
the same commands found on the File panel.
Accessing panes, panels, and  
context-sensitive tools
Depending on what’s going on within the workspace — that is, what you’ve 
just done as you edit your table, report, query, or form, or which button 
you’ve clicked on one of the Ribbon tabs — Access offers relevant onscreen 
tools and panels. As an example of this context-sensitive feature, if you open 
a table and click the Report button on the Create tab (see the Reports sec-
tion of the Create tab), not only does a report appear, but you also get new 
tabs — Design (shown in Figure 2‑11), Arrange, Format, and Page Setup, 
under the heading “Report Design Tools”.


 Chapter 2: Navigating the Access Workspace
To find out more about reporting, including the capability to group, sort, and 
total your data, see Chapters 18 through 20.
As you work with Access, you’ll get a feel for what’s going to appear when 
you do certain things. Things appear and disappear as you work because 
Access offers you just what you need for the task you’re performing or fea-
ture you’re using.
Customizing the Access Workspace
Any good application provides some capability for the user to customize the 
workspace — from adding and rearranging buttons on the toolbar to drag-
ging toolbars and panes around to optimize the layout.
Access is certainly a good software application, so it does what any good 
application does: It allows you to customize the workspace. You can move 
the Quick Access Toolbar, you can add buttons from the main tabs to the 
Quick Access Toolbar, you can resize the Ribbon, you can tweak the status 
bar, and you can decide how (or if) your ScreenTips are displayed as you 
mouse over the tools.
There’s no need to do any customization, really — the default settings for 
toolbar locations, button combinations, and onscreen help are designed with 
the average or most common user in mind, and they’re pretty good. On the 
other hand, you may just want to tweak things to feel at home. (Think of the 
times you’ve fluffed the pillows on the couch before lying down — they may 
not have needed it, but you want to make your mark on your environment, 
right? Right.)
Repositioning the Quick Access Toolbar
For the position of the Quick Access Toolbar, you have two choices:
✓
✓Above the Ribbon, which is the default location
✓
✓Below the Ribbon
To move the Quick Access Toolbar, simply right-click it and choose Show 
Quick Access Toolbar Below the Ribbon. Figure 2‑12 shows the pop-up menu 
with this command available. Note that if you click the down-pointing triangle 
at the right end of the Quick Access Toolbar, the command is Show Below 
the Ribbon.

38
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
When you place the Quick Access Toolbar below the Ribbon, you’ll notice 
that the same command (viewed by right-clicking the toolbar in its new 
­location) is now Show Quick Access Toolbar Above the Ribbon. So it toggles 
like that, switching from Above to Below, depending on its current location.
You don’t have to right-click specifically the Quick Access Toolbar in order 
to reposition it. The aforementioned command (Show . . .) is available in the 
pop-up menu that appears when you right-click the tabs, too.
Adding buttons to the  
Quick Access Toolbar
Speaking of the Quick Access Toolbar and all the ways you can access 
­commands for customizing it, try this to add commands:
1.	With any database open (so that the Ribbon tabs are displayed), 
­right-click any of the buttons on any of the tabs.
You can also right-click the Quick Access Toolbar or any Ribbon tab.
2.	Choose Customize Quick Access Toolbar (or More Commands, if 
you’re already looking at the Quick Access Toolbar’s menu from 2-12).
The Access Options dialog box opens (shown in Figure 2‑13), with its 
Customization options displayed.

39

 Chapter 2: Navigating the Access Workspace
3.	Click the Choose Commands From drop-down list and choose a 
­command category.
A list of Popular Commands appears by default.
4.	From any (or each) category, choose the commands you want to see at 
all times in the Quick Access Toolbar by clicking them one at a time 
and then clicking the Add button.
As you click the Add button, the command you choose is added to the 
list on the right. Note that you have up- and down-pointing triangles 
on the right side of the list of commands you’ve added — with one of 
the commands you’ve chosen to add selected, use them to reorder the 
list, which rearranges the left-to-right order in which they’ll appear on 
the toolbar.
5.	Continue selecting categories and commands on the left and using the 
Add button to add them to the list on the right.
Not all commands will be usable at all the times that the Quick Access 
Toolbar is displayed. For example, if you choose to place the Filter 
button from the Home tab on the Quick Access Toolbar, the button won’t 
be available until and unless a table or set of query results is open.

Pick a 
command 
category 
and a

Toolbar.

40
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
6.	When you’ve added all the commands you want to add, click OK to 
add them and close the dialog box.
When you click OK, the changes to the Quick Access Toolbar are 
applied. The toolbar’s space on the top of the workspace grows to 
accommodate all the new buttons, as shown in Figure 2‑14.
If you’re in a hurry to add a specific button to the Quick Access Toolbar, and 
you’re looking right at the button you want to add, just right-click the button 
and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar from the menu that appears. The 
button you right-click instantly appears on the toolbar and remains in the tab 
where it was living when you right-click it.
Why, then, would you use the Access Options dialog box if a simple right-
click takes care of business? Because it gives you the ability to select buttons 
from all the various tabs in one place — no need to go hunting on the tabs for 
the buttons you want to add. But when there’s just one you want and you can 
see it at the time, the right-click method can’t be beat.

Removing buttons from the  
Quick Access Toolbar
Want to remove a command from the Quick Access Toolbar? It’s easy:
1.	Point to the unwanted button on the Quick Access Toolbar and  
right-click.
2.	Choose Remove from Quick Access Toolbar from the pop-up menu 
(see Figure 2-15).
Voilà! It’s gone.
Because the button remains on the tab where it originally lived, it’s not lost — 
it’s just not taking up space at the top of the Access workspace.
Be careful not to remove the default buttons — Save, Undo, and Redo. Why? 
Because they’re used so often that it’s silly to remove them from such a great 
location. If you do remove them, you’ll have to use the Quick Access menu 
button and select them from that menu when you want to use them. That’s 
two steps (opening the menu and making a selection) instead of one, and 
who wants to increase steps by 100 percent? Not me!

Minimizing the Ribbon
Need more elbow room? If you need to spread out and want more workspace, 
you can make the Ribbon smaller, reducing it to just a strip of the tab titles 
(whichever tabs are in place at the time you choose to minimize the Ribbon). 
When it’s minimized, you can bring it back to full size with minimum fuss.
To minimize the Ribbon, follow these steps:
1.	Right-click anywhere on the Ribbon.
A pop-up menu appears. Note that you can right-click a button, a Ribbon 
tab, or a section name (such as “Reports” on the Create tab, or “Font” on 
the Home tab) and the appropriate pop-up menu will appear.
2.	Choose Collapse the Ribbon.
The Ribbon is reduced to a long bar with just the tab titles on it, as 
shown in Figure 2‑16.
Figure 2-16:

 Chapter 2: Navigating the Access Workspace
3.	To bring the Ribbon back to its full glory, right-click the reduced 
Ribbon and then choose Collapse the Ribbon.
Note that the command is now checked, indicating that the Ribbon 
is currently minimized. Performing this step — reselecting the 
­command — toggles this setting off, and the Ribbon returns to full size.
Working with ScreenTips
ScreenTips are the little names and brief descriptions of onscreen tools that 
appear when you put your mouse pointer over buttons, commands, menus, 
and many of the other pieces of the Access workspace.
Not all onscreen features have ScreenTips, but for anything you can click to 
make something happen — as when a dialog box opens, Access performs 
some task for you, or something is created — these typically have associated 
ScreenTips that you can choose to view or not view. If you choose to view 
them, you can choose to see very brief or more elaborate tips.
To tinker with Access’s ScreenTips settings, follow these steps:
1.	Click the File tab.
The File menu (the red panel on the far left) and the Info view appear on 
the workspace, as shown in Figure 2‑17.
Figure 2-17:

2.	Click the Options command, near the bottom of the menu.
The Access Options dialog box appears onscreen.
3.	From the list on the left side of the Access Options dialog box, select 
General.
The options in the dialog box change to show other options related to 
ScreenTips, file formats and folders, and how your name and initials are 
stored, as shown in Figure 2‑18.
4.	In the first section of the dialog box, click the ScreenTip Style  
drop-down list.
5.	Choose from the following options:
•	Show Feature Descriptions in ScreenTips: This option displays 
ScreenTips with extra information, as shown in Figure 2‑19. Here 
you see that in addition to the name of the button, a brief descrip-
tion of how it works (or its effect) is displayed for your benefit. 
It even points to more assistance and information — through the

Mousing Around
Access, like all Windows applications, is meant to be used with the mouse. 
The mouse is assumed to be your main way of communicating with the 
software — clicking Ribbon tabs, buttons, and drop-down lists, and making 
choices in dialog boxes to use things like the Report Wizard and the Access 
Options dialog box discussed in the previous sections of this chapter.
You can left-click to make standard choices from onscreen tools and right-
click to access pop-up menus — also known as context-sensitive menus

and tab

because the menu choices vary depending on what was right-clicked. If you 
right-click a Ribbon tab or button, you get choices for customizing toolbars 
and buttons. If you right-click a database component tab (say, the Table tab 
while that table is open), you get choices related to the table.
Not a big fan of the mouse? Check out the online Cheat Sheet for this book, 
available at www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/access2016. It’s full of powerful 
keyboard shortcuts.
Navigating Access with the Alt Key
If you like to use the keyboard as much as possible when you’re working with 
software, Access makes it somewhat easy to do that. I say somewhat because 
you need to use a special key in order to make the rest of the keyboard work 
as a commander.
When you want to switch tabs and issue commands with the keyboard 
(rather than with the mouse), press the Alt key. As shown in Figure 2‑20, 
pressing Alt causes numbers and letters to appear in small squares on the 
Quick Access Toolbar and the Ribbon’s tabs. When the numbers and letters 
are visible, you can press one of those characters on your keyboard to issue 
a command (such as pressing 1 to Save) or to switch to a tab (such as press-
ing C to get to the Create tab).

When you’re on a tab (but only if you press its letter key to activate it), the 
individual buttons on that tab have their own keyboard shortcuts displayed. 
Instead of single numbers or letters, however, now you’re looking at pressing 
key combinations, such as F + Z (displayed as FZ onscreen) to activate the 
Form Wizard. Figure 2‑21 shows the keyboard shortcuts for the Create tab.
The goal is not to try to press the two keys at the exact same time. Instead,

his may be the single most important chapter in this book. That prob-
ably sounds like a strong statement, but it’s really true. When you want 
to figure out how to actually do something, it’s essential to understand not 
just how it works, but why it works that way, and what’s going on behind the 
scenes. So after you’ve read about why Access is the right tool for you (in 
Chapter 1) and how to get around in the Access interface (Chapter 2), it’s 
time to really nail down how Access works and how to start building your 
database.
Database Lingo
Now, if the section heading (“Database Lingo”) is making you panic because 
you think I want you to memorize a bunch of database jargon, don’t worry. 
Just relax. Breathe normally. The next section, and many throughout this 
chapter, simply use some terms you need to know so you can figure out 
what Access is referring to in its various dialog boxes as well as on the vari-
ous tabs it uses to give you access to commands in the Access workspace. 
Knowing these terms will, therefore, help you get around and get things done 
in Access.
Unfortunately, you simply must know technical terms — there are no two 
ways about it. I’m talking about only a handful of words, though — some of 
which you probably already know and maybe even use in reference to infor-
mation in general — words like record and database. See? Nothing high tech, 
just some basic words and concepts you really need to absorb so you can 
move on and use Access effectively.

50
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
The terms in this section appear in size order, starting with the smallest 
piece of a database — the data — and advancing to the largest — the entire 
database itself. I’ve done it this way so you get the big picture, a little bit 
at a time, and see that the big picture is made up of smaller items. Seeing 
how they all fit together (and what to call each piece) is what this chapter’s 
all about.
Data, no matter how you pronounce it
Data is the stuff that Access stores. Information you may store in your head 
one way will be stored in a different way in a database program like Access. 
For example, you may think of someone’s name as John Smith, or you may 
only ever think of the guy as John — either because you don’t know his last 
name or because you never use his last name. A database, however, stores 
his name as either John Smith, in a field called Name, or as two pieces — Last 
Name (Smith) and First Name (John). The latter approach is best because 
it gives you more freedom to use the data in more ways. You can sort the 
data by Last Name, for example, which is hard to do if you’ve just stored the 
entire name as one chunk.
Get the idea? As mentioned in Chapter 1 (where you plan out your database), 
it’s a good idea to break down the data as much as possible. No matter how 
you pronounce it — “day-tah” or “dat-tuh” — it’s your information, and you 
want to be able to get at it in the simplest, most logical way possible. As 
you read on in this chapter, and when you review Chapters 1 and 2, you’ll 
see that Access gives you all the tools you need to do just that — it’s just a 
matter of using the right tools at the right time!
Fields of dreams (or data)
Because people don’t want their data to wander around homeless, the techni-
cal wizards created fields — places for your data to live. Each field holds one 
kind of data. For example, to track information about a baseball card collec-
tion, your fields might include Manufacturer, Player Name, Position, Year, 
Team, and Average (or ERA, for pitchers). If you have a name and address 
database, your fields might consist of Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, 
Address1, Address2, City, State, Zip, Phone, Cell, and Email. When you think 
about it, it’s pretty logical. What are all the things you can know about a 
baseball player? A client? A product? These things become fields.
As with the term data, other database programs (such as FoxPro and 
FileMaker) all agree on what a field is. In larger database packages, however 
(such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server), you find the term column replac-
ing field. And to make things more exciting, Microsoft Excel stores your fields 
in columns when you use an Excel spreadsheet to store a list. The tabular 

51

 Chapter 3: Database Basics
structure of a database table is what leads Oracle and SQL to refer to col-
umns rather than fields, but for heaven’s sake — couldn’t they have stuck to 
a term we all know?
Records
Having fields is a good start, but if you stop there, how do you know which 
last name works with which first name? Something needs to keep those 
unruly fields in order — something like a record. All the fields for one baseball 
card — or one client or one product — are all collectively known as a record. 
If you have two baseball cards in your collection, you have two records in 
your database, one for each card. Fifty clients? Fifty records.
For a little more about records, check out the following:
✓
✓Each record in a table contains the same fields but (usually) has differ-
ent data in those fields. And not every record must have data in every 
field. If someone doesn’t have a cell phone, you can’t very well have any 
data in the Cell field for that person, right?
✓
✓A single record contains all the information you need about a single 
item (accounting entry, recipe, or whatever) in your table. That’s all 
there is to it.
Tables
A table is a collection of records that describes similar data. The key phrase 
to remember in that last sentence is similar data. All the records in a single 
table contain fields of similar data. The information about that baseball card 
collection may fit into a single table. So would the client or product data. 
However, a single table would not handle both baseball cards and clients 
because they’re unrelated databases. You wouldn’t put the records for 
your car’s repairs in the folder where you keep your Christmas cookie reci-
pes, right?
Why? Because if anyone else needs to know when you last had the tires 
rotated, they aren’t going to know to look in the same place one finds the 
best recipe for Ginger Snaps. You might remember that they’re stored in 
the same place, but it’s just too confusing for anyone else. And too limiting. 
Access lets you write reports and queries based on your data, and if the 
data in your database isn’t all related, it’ll be chaos trying to write a report 
or generate a query that pulls data from that database. You could end up 
with a recipe that calls for motor oil or a maintenance schedule that tells you 
to preheat the car to 350 degrees. Such a report might be amusing, but it’s 
hardly useful.

52
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
The database
An Access database, or database file (the terms are interchangeable), is a col-
lection of everything relating to a particular set of information. The database 
contains all the tables, queries, reports, and forms that Access helps you 
create to manage and work with your stuff. Instead of storing all those items 
individually on the disk drive — where they can become lost, misplaced, or 
accidentally erased — Access groups them into a single collective file.
Here’s an important point: All those parts — the tables, the reports, queries, 
and forms — cumulatively make a database. And that’s before you even enter 
any records into the tables. The database, therefore, is more than the data; 
it’s the tools that store, manipulate, and allow you to look at the data, too.
Field Types and Uses
A field, you remember, is where your data lives. Each field holds one piece of 
data, such as Last Name or Batting Average.
Because there are so many different kinds of information in the world, Access 
offers a variety of field types for storing it. In fact, Access puts the following 
field types at your disposal:
✓
✓Short Text
✓
✓Long Text
✓
✓Number
✓
✓Currency
✓
✓AutoNumber (this data type is applied, by default, to the starting ID field 
in any new table)
✓
✓Date & Time
✓
✓Yes/No
✓
✓Lookup & Relationship
✓
✓Rich Text
✓
✓Attachment
✓
✓Hyperlink
✓
✓OLE Object
✓
✓Calculated
✓
✓Lookup Wizard

53

 Chapter 3: Database Basics
The types just listed are those available for fields you create in addition to 
that first field — the ones that will contain your data.
For now, suffice it to say that the aforementioned Autonumber field is a 
field that contains an automatically generated number so that each record is 
unique in that it has a unique autonumber, or ID. You get the word about the 
need for (and ways to create) unique fields later on, in Chapter 4.
As for the Lookup Wizard, we also get to that one much later in the book, in 
terms of its actual use. But you’ll find out more about when and how this data 
type is used later on in this very chapter!
For now, don’t worry about figuring out what each field type is or what it 
does based on its name — I go over each one shortly. As you can see, though, 
the list covers just about any type of data you can imagine. And remember, 
each one can be customized extensively, resulting in fields that meet your 
needs exactly. If you absolutely cannot wait to find out about modifying all 
the specs for your fields, Chapter 4 should be your next stop.
The upcoming bulleted list introduces the available field types and how 
they’re used. You’ll also find out a little bit about how you can tweak them to 
meet your specific needs:
✓
✓Short Text: Stores up to 255 characters of text — letters, numbers, 
­punctuation, and any combination thereof.
✓
✓Long Text: This replaces the Memo field type found in versions 2010 
and previous. A Long Text field holds up to 64,000 characters of 
­information — that’s almost 18 pages of text. This is a really big text 
field. It’s great for general notes, detailed descriptions, and anything else 
that requires a lot of space.
Numbers in a text field aren’t numbers to calculate with; they’re just 
a bunch of digits hanging out together in a field. Be careful of this fact 
when you design the tables in your database — you don’t want to enter, 
say, a value that you intend to use in a Calculated field or to extract 
some other kind of information from a report and have that value stored 
as text, rendering it inoperable as a number. If the data is numeric, store 
it that way.
Text fields have one setting you need to know about: size. When you 
create a text field, Access wants to know how many characters the field 
holds. That’s the field size. If you create a field called First Name and 
make its size 6, Joseph fits into the field, but not Jennifer. This restric-
tion can be a problem. A good general rule is to make the field a little 
larger than you think you need. It’s easy to make the field even larger at 
some later point if you need to, but it’s potentially dangerous to make it 
smaller. Surgery on fields is covered in Chapter 4.

54
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
✓
✓Number: Holds real, for-sure numbers. You can add, subtract, and cal-
culate your way to fame and fortune with number fields. But if you’re 
working with dollars and cents (or pounds and pence), use a currency 
field instead.
✓
✓Currency: Tracks money, prices, invoice amounts, and so on. In an 
Access database, the buck stops here. For that matter, so do the lira, the 
mark, and the yen. If you’re in the mood for some other kind of number, 
check out the Number field.
✓
✓Date/Time: Stores time, date, or a combination of the two, depending 
on which format you use. Use a date/time field to track the whens of life. 
Pretty versatile, eh?
✓
✓Yes/No: Holds Yes/No, True/False, and On/Off, depending on the format 
you choose. When you need a simple yes or no, this is the field to use.
✓
✓Lookup & Relationship: If you want a field within one table to actually 
display content from a field in another table, choose this as the field 
type. A simple Lookup Wizard opens as soon as this field type is chosen, 
through which you select the table and field to look up through this new 
field in your table.
✓
✓Rich Text: Need the content of a particular field to be formatted just so? 
Choose this field type, and the formatting applied to the data in the field 
(using the Text Formatting tools on the Home tab) will be how it appears 
onscreen and in reports.
✓
✓OLE Object: You can use the OLE Object data type to link or embed 
an object — such as an Excel worksheet or Word document — to an 
Access Table. 
✓
✓Attachment: Use this field type to attach files — Word documents, 
Excel worksheets, PowerPoint presentations, or any other kind of file, 
including graphics (a photo of the volunteer, product, or location, 
perhaps?) — to the record.
✓
✓Hyperlink: Thanks to this field type, Access understands and stores the 
special link language that makes the Internet such a powerful place. If 
you use Access on your company’s network or use the Internet exten-
sively, this field type is for you. You’ll find out more about hyperlinks 
and other neat ways Access and the Internet play well together in 
Chapter 11.
✓
✓Calculated Field: Use this field type when you want to fill the field in 
question with the result of a formula that uses one or more other fields 
in the same table. For example, in a table that contains a list of your 
products, other fields might include Price and Discount. If you want 
to also have a field that calculates the new price (the Price, less the 
Discount), you’d make that a Calculated field. When you choose this as 
the field type, you use a submenu to choose what kind of data will house 
the result, and then an Expression Builder dialog box appears, through 
which you set up the formula.

All the field types listed as samples in Table 3-1 are really text fields, even 
the ones for phone numbers. This is because Access sees their content as 
text rather than as a number that could be used in a calculation. (Check out

Fun with field names
Of all the Windows database programs out 
there, I think Access has the simplest field-
naming rules. Just remember these guidelines 
to make your field names perfect every time:
✓
✓It’s a good idea to start with a letter or a 
number. Although Access won’t stop you 
from using certain characters at the begin-
ning of or within your field name, it’s not a 
good idea. It can make things confusing for 
other people who might use your database, 
and symbols are hard to read if the type 
is very small. They also have only limited 
logical use in identifying the content of the 
field — what would “^Address” tell you 
that “Address” wouldn’t? Of course, after 
the first character, you might find logical 
uses for symbols such as plus signs and 
underscores. You can include spaces in 
field names, too. Oh — and which symbols 
are no-nos? See Table 3-2.
✓
✓Make the field name short and easy to 
understand. You have up to 64 characters 
for a field name, but don’t even think about 
using all that space. On the other hand, 
don’t get stingy and create names like N1 
or AZ773 unless they mean something par-
ticular to your company or organization.
✓
✓Use letters, numbers, and an occasional 
space in your field names. Although 
Access lets you include all kinds of crazy 
punctuation marks in field names, don’t do 
it. Keep it simple so that the solution you 
develop with Access doesn’t turn into a 
problem on its own.

57

 Chapter 3: Database Basics
Of course, another field type (listed in the Type column) is neither a Short 
Text nor Long Text field — you also see the Hyperlink field. This data type is 
also considered text, but the Hyperlink data type stores URLs, as URLs — 
not just as a string of text and punctuation.
If all this text versus numbers stuff is confusing you, remember that comput-
ers think there’s a difference between a number (that you’d use in a calcula-
tion) and a string of digits, such as the digits that make up a phone number. 
When it comes to different kinds of text fields, it’s a matter of how much text 
will be stored in the field, and if it needs any special formatting in order to 
work properly in the database.
Choosing Between Flat and  
Relational Databases
Unlike ice cream, databases come in just two flavors: flat-file and relational. 
Also unlike ice cream, it’s not really a matter of preference as to which one 
you choose. Some databases require a relational approach; others would be 
overwhelmed by it. Read on to figure out how to tell the difference.
Isolationist tables
In a flat system (also known as a flat-file system), all the data is lumped into 
a single table. A phone directory is a good example of a flat-file database: 
Names, addresses, and phone numbers (the data) are crammed into a single 
place (the database). Some duplication occurs — if one person has three 
phone lines at home, his or her name and address are listed three times in 
the directory — but that’s not a big problem. Overall, the database works 
just fine.
Tables that mix and mingle
The relational system (or relational database) uses as little storage space as 
possible by cutting down on the duplicated (also known as redundant) data in 
the database. To accomplish this, a relational database splits your data into 
several tables, with each table holding some portion of the total data.

58
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
Borrowing the preceding phone book example, note that one table in a rela-
tional database can contain the customer name and address information, 
whereas another can hold the phone numbers. Thanks to this approach, the 
mythical person with three phone lines has only one entry in the “customer” 
table (after all, it’s still just one customer) but has three distinct entries in 
the “phone number” table (one for each phone line).
The key to relational databases
The key field (or linking field) is the key to this advanced technology. All 
related tables in a relational database system contain this special field. The 
key field’s data identifies matching records from different tables.
The key field works just like the claim stub you receive when you drop off 
your dry cleaning. To pick up your dry cleaning when it’s finished, you pres-
ent the claim check, complete with its little claim number. That number iden-
tifies (or links) you and your cleaning so the clerk can find it.
Likewise, in the phone book example, each customer can have a unique cus-
tomer ID. The “phone number” table stores the customer ID with each phone 
number. To find out who owns a phone number, you look up the customer ID 
in the “customer name” table. Granted, it takes more steps to find someone’s 
phone number than it does in the plain flat-file system, but the relational 
system saves storage space (no more duplicate names) and reduces the 
chance of errors at the same time.
If this process seems complicated, don’t feel bad. Relational databases are 
complicated! But that’s mostly behind the scenes, where Access is doing the 
stuff it does when you make a selection in a tab or ask it to run a wizard for 
you. A good deal of the complexity is invisible to you; all you see is the power 
it gives you. When you’re ready to find out more about all that behind-the-
scenes stuff, check out Chapter 4.
But do your tables need to relate?
Now you at least have an idea of the difference between flat-file and rela-
tional databases. But do you care? Yes, you do. Each approach has its unique 
pluses and minuses for your database:
✓
✓Flat-file systems are easy to build and maintain. A Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheet is a good example of a flat-file database. A list of records is 
stored, one record per row, and you have as many records as can fit on 
the worksheet. Simple, easy, and in many cases, the way to go — if your 
database is simple and easy, too.
✓
✓Relational systems shine in big business applications such as invoic-
ing, accounting, or inventory. They’re also a big help if you have a small 
business — your customer data, for example, could require several 
tables to store customer names and addresses, purchase history, and 
credit information. Storing everything you need to store about custom-
ers could be too big a job for a single, flat-file database.

59

 Chapter 3: Database Basics
I don’t recommend that you set off to build a relational database system all 
by yourself after reading just some (or even all) of this book. It’s a big job; 
you’ll likely just end up discouraged if you dive in too quickly. If you’re sure 
that you need a relational database, enlist some help in the form of a friend 
or colleague who’s had some experience building databases. He or she can 
walk you through it the first time, and then, with this book (and Access help 
files) at your side, you can try it on your own later.
Although Access is a relational database program, it does flat-file systems 
quite nicely because even though it lets you set up several tables and set up 
relationships between them, it’s also quite happy to set up a single flat-file 
table if you want one. Whether you choose flat-file or relational for your data-
base project, Access is the right program.
Building a Database
So you’ve read a few chapters here at the beginning of the book, maybe 
you’ve leafed ahead where I’ve referred to other chapters, and now you feel 
ready. You want to dive in and start building a database. Keeping in mind my 
previous advice to take it slowly, you can take a whack at it here.
In the following procedure, you set up a new database and then use the Table 
Wizard to build the first table in the database. Ready? Here we go . . .
1.	If Access is not already running, take a moment to start it.
Chapter 1 shows you how to do this.
In the Access workspace, a series of large template icons appears, 
below a Search for Online Templates box, accompanied by links to likely 
searches for templates that store Assets, Business, Contacts, Employee, 
and so on.
2.	Click the Blank Desktop Database icon.
A Blank Desktop Database dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3‑1.
Figure 3-1:  
New blank 
databases

names. Give 
yours one 
here.

60
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
3.	Type a name to replace the generic DatabaseX (where X is the 
number assigned chronologically to the database).
You don’t need to type a file extension (.accdb); Windows 7 and 
8/8.1display your extensions automatically. Also, if you accidentally 
delete the file extension while changing the filename, don’t worry — 
Access adds it to the filename you type.
4.	If you don’t like the folder that Access picked out for you, click the 
little folder icon and choose where to store the new database.
As shown in Figure 3‑2, when you click that little folder icon, the File 
New Database dialog box opens. From here, you can navigate to any-
where on your local system or on a network to which you’re connected 
and select the drive and folder on which to store your new database. 
When you’ve finished selecting a spot for your new database, click OK to 
return to the workspace.
5.	Click the Create button.
A blank table, called Table1, appears in the central section of the work-
space, and on the left, a panel lists the parts of your database (there’s 
just one part so far). Figure 3‑3 shows your new table and the left-
hand panel.
When you click Create, if a dialog box pops up and asks whether you 
want to replace an existing file, Access is saying that a database with the 
name you entered is already on the disk.
•	If this is news to you, click No and then come up with a different 
name for your new database.

•	If you intended to replace that old database with a new one, click 
Yes and proceed.
6.	Create and name your fields in the table by double-clicking where it 
says Click to Add at the top of the second column in the table.
7.	Click the arrow to the right of the words Click to Add and choose the 
type of field you want to add.
The many choices are discussed earlier in this chapter. For most fields, 
Text will be the type, but your data and its nature (and your desired 
uses for it) will dictate what’s best to choose here.
What’s that ID field in the first column? It’s there by default and will 
contain a unique number for each record you create (when you start 
entering records, later). This provides the unique field that each table 
requires, especially if you’re going to relate your tables. You can change 
its name by double-clicking the name “ID” and changing it to, for exam-
ple, Customer Number.
Later on, after you’ve set up your tables and established relationships 
between them, you can reassign what’s known as the primary key 
(another name for a unique field in a table), and at that point, if you 
want, the ID field can be removed.
8.	Type a new field name (to replace the highlighted placeholder name), 
and press Enter to save the new field name.
As soon as you press Enter, a new field appears, with a blank at the top, 
awaiting a name.

Repeat Steps 7 and 8 until you have all the fields you think you’ll need in 
this table. You can always rename them later (by double-clicking the cur-
rent names), so don’t worry about perfection at this point. Just start set-
ting up fields so you can start entering data. Figure 3‑4 shows a new field 
name in place and a new one awaiting the Enter key to confirm it.
9.	To save your new table and the entire database, press Ctrl+S or click 
the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar.
It’s a good idea to save each time you’ve done something important — 
building a table, updating some fields, adding records, and so on — 
essentially after anything you’d hate to have to do over again.
Rarely is “Table1” a really useful name for a table. Before or after saving your 
database, renaming a table is easy. Just follow these steps:
1.	Right-click the Table tab.
2.	Choose Save from the pop-up menu that appears.
3.	Type a name for the table in the resulting Save As dialog box.
4.	Click OK to keep the name.
5.	Resave your database to include this change.

 Chapter 3: Database Basics
Adding and Removing Tables
Nobody’s expecting perfection at this stage of the game. Certainly not in 
your first foray into database creation, and not even on your second or third 
attempt. Even seasoned experts forget things now and then, realizing after 
they’ve built a table that they didn’t need it, or after they’ve started setting 
up reports and queries that they’ve forgotten a table that they needed. It can 
happen to anyone.
What to do? Use Access’s simple interface to add the tables you want and 
delete the tables you don’t.
One more, please
If, after you start building your database, you decide that your database war-
rants more than one table — in other words, if you realize you need a rela-
tional database — then you need to add another table. If you already knew 
that your database was going to need multiple tables, then — after building 
the first one — the only thing to do is build the rest, one by one.
To add new tables to an existing database, repeat the following steps for each 
new table:
1.	Click the Create tab on the Ribbon.
The Create tab’s buttons appear, as shown in Figure 3‑5.
2.	Click the Table button on the Ribbon.
A new table, blank and awaiting the name for the first field, appears, as 
shown in Figure 3‑6.
3.	Build and name the fields for this new table as shown in the previous 
procedure.
Save your database periodically as you work.

tab is the 
logical 
place to 
go when 
you want 
to ­create a 
new table.

64
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
4.	Continue adding tables, using Steps 1 through 3 for as many tables as 
you need in the database.
You don’t have to do this perfectly from the start — you can always go 
back to rename fields and add or remove tables (more on how to do that 
in a second). The goal here is to just do it — just get started and get the 
database going so you can see what you have and start working with it.
Naming tables is important — because you’re going to need to know, at a 
glance at that left-hand panel, what’s in Table1 or Table2 or Table3, right? 
Better to name them Customers, Orders, Products, and so on, so you don’t 
have to remember each one by a generic number. To name a table, you 
can do so when you first close it and are prompted to save it. As shown in 
Figure 3‑7, the Save As dialog box gives you a Table Name box. Type the name 
and press Enter. If you decide you don’t like the name later on, simply right-
click the name it currently has, as displayed in the left-hand panel, and the 
current name is highlighted. Type the new name, and press Enter to confirm 
it. You can also choose Rename from the menu that appears if you right-click 
the table’s name in the left-hand panel that lists your database components. 
This also gives you the opportunity to type a replacement name.

 Chapter 3: Database Basics
Oops, I didn’t mean to do that
So you have a table you didn’t want. Maybe you realize after building Table 
C that you really only need Tables A and B — or that Table D, which you’ve 
also created, really makes Table C unnecessary. Whatever the reason, tables, 
even ones with records in them, are easy to get rid of.
Let me state that again: Tables are easy to get rid of. Perhaps too easy. Before 
you delete a table, check and recheck your database to make sure you aren’t 
deleting information that you need to keep. When a table is deleted, all con-
nections to it — including all relationships and references in queries and 
reports — are deleted, too. A prompt appears when you choose to delete a 
table, reminding you of this.
Still committed to ditching the table? Here’s how it’s done:
1.	With your database open, look at the panel on the left side of the 
workspace.
You should see a list of your tables in that panel, as shown in Figure 3‑8.
2.	Right-click the table name in the panel on the left side of the 
­workspace, and choose Delete from the pop-up menu, as shown in 
Figure 3‑9.

3.	Click Yes in response to the resulting prompt if, in fact, you do want to 
delete the table.
All gone!
Now, you probably think it’s time to start entering records, but no, I don’t 
advise doing that yet. Before you start populating your tables with data, it’s a 
better idea to set up your table relationships, establish the key fields that will 
connect your relational tables, and define the specs for each of your fields — 
taking advantage of those field options I mention earlier in this chapter.
Even if your database will be a (relatively simple) flat-file database, you 
need to iron out the settings for your fields before you start entering data — 
establishing the rules for entering names, numbers, dates, and so on — so 
that what you enter is graciously accepted by the fields you’ve set up.
Chapter 4 helps you prepare your database for its relational duties. In 
Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, you get a handle on customizing your fields to 
suit your needs. After that’s done, you can enter your data and begin taking 
advantage of Access’s forms, queries, and reports — all the stuff covered in 
the rest of the book!

A
 
s a professional Access database developer, I’ve seen a lot of things 
over the years. And one of the most common is poor table design. 
Planning a database is like building a house; if you don’t get the foundation 
right, you’ll start to see cracks or worse! Same thing with an Access database. 
Access tables are like the foundation of your house. Design them right and all 
will go well. Design them wrong, and you’ll start to see those cracks as you 
get further into the project.
Back in Chapter 1, we discussed planning out your database. In this chapter, 
we’ll dig deeper into how to turn that plan into the best possible table design.
Planning Your Database Tables
As you know, tables are made up of fields — the bits of information you want 
to store in your database. Hopefully, you put your list of fields together back 
in Chapter 1 and you broke them into logical groups. You did do that, didn’t 
you? You see, I keep harping on it because table design is the most impor-
tant part to building a database but oftentimes, not given the attention it 
deserves. So, time to do the work, or if you already did, pull your field list out 
so we can get started!
Reviewing fields
Take a look at your field list and think about how you’ll use that data. For 
example, you might have Volunteer Name as one of your fields. Now, should 
that be one field or two? Well, if you’ll always refer to your volunteers by 

68
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
full name, like Ken Cook, then one field is fine. However, that seems unlikely. 
Suppose your database produces emails to volunteers. It’s unlikely you’ll 
want the email to begin with “Hi Ken Cook”. It would say “Hi Ken”. So, now 
you know that you need two fields, one for first and one for last name.
Address is another example. Do you want to group your volunteers by city on 
a report? If the answer is yes, you can’t lump the entire address in one field. 
You’ll need fields for street, city, state, and zip code. This gives you the most 
flexibility.
Take a good look at your field list and make sure you have each piece of 
information at the most granular level. You’ll thank yourself for taking time 
now to think this through. Once you have your volunteer field on two forms 
and five reports and it’s time to build that email functionality, if you have 
two fields (first name and last name), you’ll smile! If you have one field, you’ll 
frown because you have to split the name into two fields and change all the 
forms and reports that use that field to incorporate the two fields.
Determining data types
After you have a good field list, it’s time to think about the type of data 
each field will store. Will it store a date, a number, text, or perhaps just the 
choices of true or false? Setting data types correctly affects overall database 
size and performance. Next to each field, write down the type of data the field 
will store and the maximum size of that data.
Text data
Suppose a state field stores the two-letter state abbreviation for a volunteer’s 
state of residence. Access has a Long Text and Short Text data type. Long 
text stores up to 64,000 characters. Short text stores up to 255 characters 
and you can specify the exact number of characters using the Field Size prop-
erty. I’m sure you’ve figured out which data type to choose but might want to 
know the reasons why.
If you choose Long Text for your state field, you’ll be reserving the capacity 
to store 64,000 characters in that field even though you’ll never store more 
than two. What a waste! This inflates the size of your database and over time 
degrades its performance. The larger the amount of data in a database, the 
slower it may perform over time. So, choose Short Text with a Field Size of 2 
and you’ll be all set!
Now, the flipside of that is being too conservative. Back to our volunteer first 
and last name. If you specify 10 characters and a Short Text data type for 
the LastName field, you’re fine unless the volunteer has a last name that’s 11 

69

 Chapter 4: Sounds Like a Plan
characters long. Now, you’ve got a problem. Access won’t allow you to type 
an 11-character name in that field. You’ll have to edit the Field Size property 
for that field and increase the number to accommodate the longest possible 
name. So, choose wisely when setting data types.
Number data
The rules that apply to text apply to numbers, too. Pick the number field 
size that fits closest to the size of the number you’ll store in the field with-
out going under. Table 4‑1 shows the number field sizes and the maximum 
number and number of decimal places that the data type can hold.
A significant digit is a non-zero number either to the left or right of the 
decimal place. So, 0.123 has three significant digits, 22.00013 has four signifi-
cant digits, and 42 has two significant digits. A single field size will accept 
0.1234567 but not 12.1234567 because the first number has seven significant 
digits and the second nine. The second number will appear in a field sized as 
single as 12.12346 (the 5 is rounded to a 6 and the 6 and 7 are dropped).
If the number is not a number that you’ll perform calculations with, use one 
of the text data types. A zip code is the classic example. Many zip codes 
begin with a zero. If you choose a number data type for your zip code field 
and type 08888 in your zip code field, you’ll get a nice surprise. Access 
removes the leading zero when you tab out of the field and 08888 becomes 
8888. Thank you Access! Easy to fix. Just choose Small Text with a Field Size 
of 9 and you’re leading zero will stick around like it should.
Assigning data type and size is not an exact science. If you’re not sure what 
to choose, bigger is better than smaller. Choose a type and size that will 
accommodate what you think is the largest possible entry for that field. If you 
choose 50 as the Field Size for your LastName field and the longest last name 
is only 40 characters, no big deal. But if you choose 10 and the longest last

name is 40 characters, then you’ve got to go back and edit the field proper-
ties in the table, which, depending on where you are with the project, can be 
a big deal.
Grouping fields into tables
At this point, you’ve done some great work specifying each field and the data 
type and size for each field. Now it’s time to organize the fields into tables. 
This may seem easy. Just one table for everything, right? Wrong! There are 
some guiding principles when grouping fields into tables:
✓
✓Make sure the data is related. The data should share a common theme 
like volunteer contact information, events, or locations.
✓
✓Make sure the data does not repeat. If you find yourself entering the 
same volunteer into the Volunteers table two times because they have 
two addresses, you need a new table.
✓
✓Make sure related choices do not become field names. If you have 
three volunteer fields in your events table called Volunteer1, Volunteer2, 
and Volunteer3, then you’ve got a problem. Querying data like this is dif-
ficult. If you need to specify multiple volunteers for the same event, then 
you need a new table.
Take your list of fields and group them by subject. Then check for duplicates 
per points two and three in the previous list. When you’re done, you might 
have something like Figure 4‑1.
Figure 4-1:  
Tables, 
fields, data 
types, and 
sizes.

71

 Chapter 4: Sounds Like a Plan
What is normal?
The process of building tables so you don’t repeat data or repeat fields is 
called normalization. A normalized table follows the guiding principles out-
lined in the previous section. Figure 4‑2 shows a table that is not normalized. 
Can you figure out why?
Didn’t figure it out? OK, I’ll give you a hint. Suppose the Swim-a-thon requires 
a fourth volunteer? What would you do? Add a new field? That would fix the 
problem for now, but what happens if a fifth volunteer is needed? You can’t 
keep adding fields. The answer is to remove the volunteer series of fields and 
create a new table called EventVolunteers. This new table allows you to add 
as many volunteers as you need to each event.
If you know you could have two addresses per volunteer or ten volunteers 
per event, then you need a new table for addresses and another for event 
­volunteers. This step is crucial to proper table design.
If the figures in this section make no sense, not to worry. Queries are covered 
in Part IV. I need to show you this so you understand how good table design 
saves time and effort!
Why? Because it becomes very difficult to get a list of events that Burrell vol-
unteered for if you have ten volunteer fields. Figure 4‑3 shows the query in 
Design view with the abnormal events table.
Just imagine if there were ten volunteer fields! You’d have to type Burrell’s 
name ten times on ten different rows (see Figure 4‑4). Also, notice how 
Burrell’s name shows in multiple columns along with names of other volun-
teers that you’re not interested in at the moment. If you had ten volunteer 
fields, you’d see a lot of names of other volunteers.
Now let’s look at the same query with normalized tables, as shown in 
Figures 4‑5 and 4‑6.

 Chapter 4: Sounds Like a Plan
If you compare Figure 4‑4 to 4-6, you’ll see that Figure 4-6 returns the results 
we want without the extra names we don’t want. If you compare Figures 4‑3 
and 4‑5, I think you’ll agree that Figure 4-5 is the easier query to write. Both 
queries return the same number of events, but the second one is easier to 
build and has cleaner results! This is why it’s so important that the table 
design is right the first time around. I can tell you from personal experience, 
getting design right the first time will save you a lot of aggravation!
Building Tables in Design View
Now that you’ve organized, you can build your tables. Here’s how to start:
1.	Click the Create tab on the Ribbon.
2.	Click the Table Design button in the Tables group.
A new table appears in Design view ready for your new fields (see 
Figure 4‑7). The Property Sheet and Field Properties appear as well. If 
you don’t see the Property Sheet, press F4 to open it.
Creating fields
You can’t save a table unless it has at least one field. Because you’ve done 
the legwork of organizing your data into fields and tables up front (if you 
didn’t do this, see the section, “Planning Your Database Tables” earlier in this 
chapter), this part should be easy. These steps assume you have a table open 
in Design view.
1.	Click in the first blank row in the Field Name column.
2.	Type your field name.
A field name can be a maximum of 64 characters.
Figure 4-6:  
Burrell’s 
events with 
­normalized 
table

74
Part I: Getting Started with Access 2016 
Keep your field names short and descriptive of what they’ll store. You’ll 
sometimes need to type field names out when referring to them in 
queries or on forms and reports. Long field names mean more typing! 
Avoid using spaces in field names. Field names with spaces must be sur-
rounded by square brackets ([]) that you’ll have to type. If your field 
name does not have a space and you need to type it out, Access will 
enter the square brackets for you. That Access is one awesome helper, 
don’t you think?
3.	In each subsequent blank row, type each field name that belongs with 
your new table.
This is shown in Figure 4‑8.
4.	Click File  ➪  Save (or press Ctrl+S) to save your new table.
Care to guess the maximum size of a table name? If you said 64, you’re a 
winner!
Keep table names short and avoid using spaces in them for the same reasons 
I mention in the field name tip. Avoid special characters in field and table 
names; many of them aren’t allowed. Stick to letters, numbers, and under-
scores (_) and you won’t have any problems. Use underscores rather than 
spaces if you need to differentiate words in your names.

 Chapter 4: Sounds Like a Plan
Setting data types
Once you have your field names entered, tell Access what data they will 
hold by choosing a data type. If you don’t know what a data type is or 
what to choose, see the sections, “Field Types and Uses” in Chapter 3 and 
“Determining data types” earlier in this chapter. Here are the data type steps:
1.	Click in the Data Type column next to the new field, as shown in 
Figure 4‑9.
A drop-down list appears with data type choices.
2.	Select a data type from the list.
3.	Enter a field size on the Field Size property row in the Field Properties 
section of table design.
Not every data type needs a field size, but most do.
4.	Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each field in the table.
5.	Save the table.
Take your time to build tables. Get it right the first time and you’ll save your-
self a lot of aggravation down the road.

ife in today’s world is all about doing things faster and more efficiently 
to increase productivity. Isn’t that what your life is about? Oh, you have 
a life outside the office, too? (What a concept.) Maybe you have a relation-
ship? This chapter is about making your databases faster and about building 
good relationships (the database kind, not the human kind!).
As with any good relationship, the end result is often harmony and happi-
ness. Making your Access tables work well together will make things so much 
easier in so many ways as you move on to build your queries, forms, and 
reports. The good news is that building relationships in Access takes a lot 
less time than building human relationships.
How can you make Access work faster and more efficiently? With key fields 
and indexes, that’s how! Each table should have that one special field 
assigned as a primary key. A primary key prevents duplicate records from 
being entered into a table — hence more efficient data entry. (I love the word 
hence!) To retrieve your data faster, you need to create the proper balance 
of indexes for each table. Not enough indexes, and querying 100,000 records 
will take forever; too many, and the same could be true. So assigning indexes 
to the correct fields is an art form. You find out all about the art of indexes in 
this chapter.
The Primary Key to Success
A table’s primary key is a special field in your table. You use this field to 
uniquely identify each record in the table.

80
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Usually the primary key is a single field. In very special circumstances, two 
or more fields can share the job. The technical term for this type of key is a 
multifield key.
The lowdown on primary keys
Before we discuss how to create a primary key, you’ll need to know some 
rules and guidelines for using one. This section contains the when, where, 
and why of the primary key.
Uses
Almost every table you create needs a primary key. Here’s why:
✓
✓A primary key organizes your data by uniquely identifying 
each record.
That’s one reason why a primary key makes your database work a little 
faster. For an explanation of indexes and their creation, see the section 
“Indexing for Faster Queries,” later in this chapter.
For example, a Volunteer table typically contains a  Volunteer 
Number field. This field is the primary key. If your Volunteer table 
contains a dozen Jane Smiths, you need a way to tell them apart. The 
VolunteerNumber field for each record uniquely identifies each Jane 
Smith — and every other volunteer, too.
✓
✓Tables, by default, are sorted by primary key.
A primary key helps Access find a particular record much faster.
✓
✓Your database could freak out if you don’t have a primary key. 
Without a primary key, finding the requested records can be difficult for 
Access. Think of the Jane Smith example just used. How does Access 
know which Jane Smith you want if multiple Jane Smith volunteers are 
in your database? Well, by the primary key, that’s how! It is unique for 
each volunteer and therefore can be used to uniquely identify each Jane 
Smith. Problem solved!
Rules
Before you create a primary key, you need to know a few guidelines. Here’s a 
handy listing:
✓
✓Location: Access doesn’t care where the primary key field appears in 
the table design. The key can be the first field, the last field, or buried in 
the middle.
Even if Access doesn’t care where you put things, I always recommend 
that you make the primary key field the first field in your table. It makes 
relationships easier to build (as you see later in this chapter).

81

 Chapter 5: Table Tune Ups
✓
✓Defaults: Access tries to save you time and trouble with the default 
actions it gives to the primary key:
Access really, really wants you to have a primary key in your table.
If you create a new table in table design mode without a primary 
key, Access suggests adding a primary key field when you save the 
table.
Access gives this automatic primary key field a wildly creative 
name — ID — with an AutoNumber data type.
If the first field you add in a table is an AutoNumber type, Access 
automatically makes that AutoNumber field the primary key.
Access indexes the primary key field automatically.
✓
✓Restrictions: You can’t just create primary keys willy-nilly. Access 
imposes these limits:
•	A table can have only one primary key.
•	You can’t use the Calculated, Attachment, and OLE Object 
data types or a multivalued field for a primary key.
Avoid using the yes/no field type in a primary key. You can have 
only two records in such a table: Yes and No.
•	All primary key indexes must have a name (just as all fields must 
have a name).
•	Access automatically names all primary key indexes PrimaryKey.
Creating a primary key
To create a primary key, follow these steps:
1.	Open the table in Design view.
If you just asked yourself “how do I do that?” then it might not be time 
for you to create a primary key. Chapter 3 shows you the table basics 
you need before you can create a primary key.
2.	Click the field name for the primary key.
Don’t know which field to select for your primary key? See the sidebar, 
“The key to table happiness.” The preceding section, “Rules,” relates the 
guidelines for selecting a primary key.
3.	On the Ribbon, click the Primary Key button (shown in Figure 5-1).
A key symbol appears on the button next to the field name you selected.
The primary key is set!

The key to table happiness
What makes a good key field? How do you find 
the right one? Good questions! In fact, they’re 
the two most important questions to ask about 
a primary key.
Primary key values must be unique for each 
record. Leaving a primary key field blank is 
not an option. So start by looking at some 
sample data that will go into your table. Is there 
something like a phone number or customer 
number that will be unique for each record? 
If so, you’ve just found your primary key field. 
If not, then an AutoNumber field is the way 
to go. When you designate a field’s data type 
as AutoNumber, Access assigns sequential 
numbers to each record entered into the table. 
(Isn’t our good pal Access the best?)
AutoNumber fields always create a unique 
identifier for each record. When you delete a 
record with an AutoNumber field, Access 
even keeps track of those numbers and will 
not use them again. (Access, you are quite a 
pal indeed!)

 Chapter 5: Table Tune Ups
Making Tables Get Along
Relational databases split data among two or more tables. Access uses a link-
ing field, called a foreign key, to tie related tables together. For example, one 
table may contain volunteer names and addresses, whereas another table 
tracks the volunteer event participation history. The event participation 
information is tied to the volunteer information with a linking field, which (in 
this example) is probably a Volunteer ID.
Why is this important? Well, suppose you need to print an invoice schedule 
for volunteer Anita Cash. By placing the Volunteer ID in the Events table and 
relating the Events table to the Volunteer table via the Volunteer ID, you can 
pull Anita Cash’s name and address information for the schedule without 
having to put that information in the Events table.
Rules of relationships
Keep this in mind when relating tables:
✓
✓Tables you want to relate must have at least one field in common. 
Although the field name need not be identical, its data type must be 
the same in each table. For example, you can’t relate a text field to a 
number field.
Keep key field names consistent between your tables. If you don’t, that 
ball of confusion will roll your way at some point down the road.
✓
✓Usually, the linking field is one table’s primary key but rarely the pri-
mary key in the other table. The Volunteer table, for example, is prob-
ably arranged by Volunteer ID, whereas event data is likely organized 
by Event ID.
✓
✓After the two tables have been created and share a common field, 
you’re not done. You still have to build that relationship. (You’ll 
find out how to actually do that in the later section, “Building Table 
Relationships.”)
Relationship types
There is more than one type of table relationship in Access. When you relate 
two tables, you can choose one of three possible relationship types.
Unless you want to be an Access expert, you only need to understand the 
one-to-many table relationship. It’s the most common one.

84
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
One-to-many
One-to-many relationships connect one record in the first table to many 
records in the second table. This is the default relationship type.
Typical example: One volunteer may participate in many events, so one 
­volunteer record is linked to many event records in the Events table.
One-to-one
One-to-one relationships link one record in the first table to exactly one 
record in the second table.
One-to-one relationships aren’t common. Tables that have a one-to-one 
­relationship can be combined into one table, which usually happens.
Many-to-many
Many-to-many relationships link many records in one table to many records 
in another table.
Here’s a common example of a many-to-many relationship:
✓
✓A customer-order database contains separate tables for
•	Customers
•	Individual products
✓
✓Every individual product needs to be available to every customer.
In other words, many customers need to be able to order many of the 
same products. The database needs to satisfy queries that look for both 
of these:
•	Every customer who ordered the same product
•	Every product that one customer ordered
In Access 2016, you can link many customers to many of the same products 
two ways: multivalued fields and junction tables.
Multivalued fields
Access 2016 allows the creation of many-to-many relationships between two 
tables via multivalued fields.
Multivalued fields were a new capability in Access 2007. Prior to Access 2007, 
many-to-many relationships between two tables were bad — so bad that 
Access didn’t allow them. Older versions of Access required creating a third 
table called a junction table (more on junction tables in a minute) to accom-
plish a many-to-many relationship.

85

 Chapter 5: Table Tune Ups
A multivalued field can store many similar data items. Adding a multivalued 
field ends the need for creating multiple records to record multiple products 
ordered on one customer order. For example, you can add a multivalued field 
called ProductID to the Order Detail table. All products ordered can be 
stored in one field, so only one record per order is required.
Multivalued fields are not all peaches and cream. Use a junction table if you 
need to sort the data stored in the multivalued field or you think you’ll upsize 
down the road to SQL Server. Sorting these fields is quite cumbersome and 
multivalued fields don’t upsize to other platforms such as SQL Server. If you 
think you’ll upsize to a more robust database platform at some point, avoid 
multivalued fields.
Microsoft created multidvalued fields as an easy alternative to junction 
tables — and to make Access more compatible with SharePoint. Unless 
you’re certain you’ll never need to sort the field or upsize your database, 
avoid multivalued fields.
Junction tables
A junction table is a special table that keeps track of related records in two 
other tables:
✓
✓The junction table has a one-to-many relationship with both tables.
✓
✓The result works like a direct many-to-many relationship between 
both tables.
For example, a junction table called Orders can connect the customers to 
the order details for a particular order. The junction table has a one-to-many 
relationship with both the Customer and Order Details tables.
Building Table Relationships
If you can drag-and-drop, you can build a table relationship.
Keep these three limitations in mind:
✓
✓You can only relate tables that are in the same database.
✓
✓You can relate queries to tables, but that’s unusual.
✓
✓You need to tell Access specifically how your tables are related.
When you’re ready to play the matchmaker between your loving tables, 
here’s how to do it.

86
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
The Relationships window
To build a table relationship, first open the Relationships window. Follow 
these steps:
1.	Click the Database Tools tab on the Ribbon.
The Relationships group appears on the Ribbon. (See Figure 5‑2.)
2.	From the Relationships group, click the Relationships button.
The Relationships window appears. The first time you set a relation-
ship, the Show Table dialog box appears as well. More on that in the 
next section.
If some tables are already listed in the window, someone (or some wizard) 
has already defined relationships for this database. If you’re not sure how 
they got there and if more than one person is working on your database, 
stop and consult all database developers before changing the relation-
ships. What might work for you could be disastrous for your colleagues.
When the Relationships window is open, you can select and relate tables.
Table relationships
For each pair of tables you relate, you must select the tables and then join 
their common fields. The following sections show you how.
Selecting tables
To select tables to relate, open the Relationships window (as described in 
the preceding section) and follow these steps:

tionships


 Chapter 5: Table Tune Ups
1.	Choose Show Table from the Ribbon’s Relationships group. (If you 
don’t see the Relationships group, select the Database Tools tab on the 
Ribbon.)
The Show Table dialog box appears, listing the tables in the current 
database file.
2.	For each pair of tables you want in the relationship, follow these 
steps:
a.	Click the table.
b.	Click Add.
In the large Relationships workspace, a little window lists the fields 
in the selected table. As you add tables to the layout, a separate 
window appears for each table. You can see these windows below 
the Show Table dialog box in Figure 5‑3.
Repeat Step 2 for each pair of tables you want to relate. If one of the 
tables in the pair is already present (because of an existing relationship 
it has with another table), you don’t have to add it again.
3.	After you finish adding tables, click the Close button.
When you have all the tables present, you’re ready for these tables to get to 
know each other. The following sections show how to relate the tables.

Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Managing relationships
This section contains all the information you’ll need to create, edit, and 
delete your table relationships.
Creating relationships
After you select the tables (as shown in the preceding instructions), follow 
these steps to create a relationship between two tables:
1.	Decide which two tables you want to relate.
Because the one-to-many relationship is the most common, these 
instructions pertain to it. The two tables in a one-to-many relationship 
are designated as fulfilling one of two roles:
•	Parent: In the parent table, the related field is the primary key. Each 
record in the parent table is uniquely identified by this related 
field.
•	Child: In the child table, the related field contains the same infor-
mation as the field in the parent table. Typically, it has the same 
name as the corresponding field in the parent table — although 
this is not a requirement.
To make relating tables easier, put related fields near the beginning of 
the field list. In Access, you must see the related fields on the screen 
before you can make a relationship. If the related fields are not at the 
beginning of the field list, you have to do a lot of scrolling to find them. 
To move a field, open the problem table in DesignView, point to the 
button that’s left of the field name, then press and drag on the button to 
move the field up.
2.	Follow these steps to select the parent field from the list:
a.	Put the mouse pointer on the field you want to relate in the 
parent table.
Usually the field you want to relate in the parent table is the 
primary key.
b.	Hold down the left mouse button.
3.	While holding down the left mouse button, follow these steps to join 
the parent field to the child field:
a.	Drag the mouse pointer from the parent field to the child table.
A plus sign appears at the base of the mouse pointer.
b.	Point to the related field in the child table.
c.	Release the mouse button.
The Edit Relationships dialog box appears, detailing the soon-to-be 
relationship, as shown in Figure 5‑4.

89

 Chapter 5: Table Tune Ups
Be very careful before releasing the mouse button. Put the tip of the 
mouse pointer directly on the child field before you let go.
•	If you drag between the two fields correctly, the Edit Relationships 
dialog box displays the parent and child fields side by side, as 
shown in Figure 5‑4.
•	If you miss, click Cancel in the Edit Relationships dialog box and 
try Step 3 again.
4.	In the Edit Relationships dialog box, select the Enforce Referential 
Integrity option.
5.	Double-check that your field names are the correct ones and then 
click Create.
Access illustrates the new relationship in the Relationships window:
•	A line between the related fields shows you that the tables are 
related.
•	If you checked the Enforce Referential Integrity option in the 
preceding step, Access places a 1 next to the parent in the rela-
tionship and an infinity symbol next to the child, as shown in the 
relationship in Figure 5‑5.
To relate another pair of selected tables, repeat Steps 1 through 5.
Access also provides tools for modifying and removing relationships. The fol-
lowing section shows how to use them.
Figure 5-4:  
The Edit 
Relation-
ships dialog 
box details 
how Access 
connects 
two tables.

90
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Modifying relationships
After you relate tables, you can see, organize, and remove the relationships.
If you create a relationship you don’t want, open the Relationships window 
and follow these steps to delete the relationship:
1.	Click the Relationship line connecting the two tables.
If you are successful, the line will thicken. That means the line 
is selected.
2.	Tap the Delete key on your keyboard and then Yes in the resulting 
message box.
Voilà! The relationship is gone.
If you’re relating many tables together, the Relationships window may look 
a little messy because Relationship lines will cross each other. This makes it 
difficult to determine which tables are related to each other. To rectify this 
situation, click and drag the title bar of a table window to another part of the 
Figure 5-5:  
A one-
to-many 
relationship 
between 
two tables.
Child tables’ “protective services”?
Enforce Referential Integrity sounds harsh, 
doesn’t it? It simply means that Access makes 
sure that a record is present in the parent 
table before you can add one to its child table. 
(Shouldn’t every child have a parent watching?) 
For example, with Referential Integrity enforced, 
Access won’t let you assign a location to an 
event in the Events table that is not present in 
the Locations table.

91

 Chapter 5: Table Tune Ups
screen. It’s good practice — although not always possible — to show parents 
either above or to the left of their children. Try to arrange the parent and 
child tables so the lines between the parent and child tables don’t cross over 
any lines that illustrate other table relationships.
Having trouble understanding your relationships? (Who isn’t?) Are you 
scrolling all over the place in the Relationships window to see everything? If 
so, the Relationship Report is just for you. To preview this report, click the 
Relationship Report button in the Tools group on the Ribbon’s Design tab. 
All the related tables in your database will display in an easy-to-read report. 
(Okay, easier to read!)
Indexing for Faster Queries
You may find yourself sitting for a minute or two waiting for a query or report 
to run. (I’ve sat longer than that for some reports during the development 
stage.) So what can be done to speed up your queries? Add indexes to your 
tables, that’s what.
A table index in Access works just like the index in a book. It helps Access 
find a record in a table just as a book index helps you find a topic in a book.
Indexes dramatically speed up queries and sorts. When you sort or query a 
table on an indexed field, the index has already done most of the work.
How an index works
An index is essentially a copy of the table that’s 
already sorted on the indexed field.
When a table is indexed properly, queries run 
faster because the indexes help Access locate 
the data faster.
Here’s an example. Suppose you need 
to produce a list of all your Pennsylvania 
volunteers, and you often query your volunteer 
table by state:
✓
✓If you index the State field in your 
Volunteers table, all the Pennsylvania 
volunteers will be in one place. When 
Access reaches the Pennsylvania 
volunteers, it can stop there and return 
them to you in your query. It doesn’t have 
to continue to the end of the table through 
the rest of the states. 
✓
✓Without the index, Access must scan every 
record in the table to return the desired 
results.

92
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
The benefit of an index depends on the number of records in the table:
✓
✓If you have 100 volunteers, an index won’t improve performance much.
✓
✓If you have tens of thousands of volunteers, an index will improve per-
formance significantly.
Creating your own index
Here’s the lowdown on indexes:
✓
✓Each field in a table can be indexed if it isn’t a calculated, attachment, 
OLE object data type, or multivalued field.
✓
✓As with the primary key, an index may have a unique name that’s dif-
ferent from the field name. It can also have the same name as the field 
name. Access won’t balk either way.
✓
✓You don’t have to name your index; Access does that for you.
✓
✓Indexes either allow or prevent duplicate entries in your table.
Here are some guidelines to help you decide which fields to index, presented 
in their recommended order:
1.	Start by querying the table whose query performance you’d like to 
improve (for more on queries, see Chapter 13).
Make note of the time it took to run the query.
2.	Next, index each field that you know you’ll query frequently.
For example, in a Volunteer table, you might query by Volunteer ID, 
Volunteer Last Name, and Volunteer State.
3.	Finally, query the newly indexed table.
If the query time improves, your indexes are correct. If your query time 
worsens, try removing one index at a time, starting with the field you 
think you’ll query the least. Rerun your query and note performance.
When you’ve optimized performance, your indexing is complete.
4.	Apply an index type.
The sidebar “To duplicate or not to duplicate” shows which index type 
to apply.
To list a table’s indexes, follow these steps:
1.	Open the table in Design view.
2.	On the Design tab, click the Indexes button in the Ribbon’s Show/
Hide group. (See Figure 5-6.)

93

 Chapter 5: Table Tune Ups
Building too many indexes in a table slows down some tasks. Adding records 
to a table with several indexes takes a little longer than adding records to 
an non-indexed table. Access spends extra time updating all those indexes 
behind the scenes. The trick is to get the right number of indexes assigned to 
the right fields. Sometimes it comes down to trial and error when you’re opti-
mizing query performance via indexes.
To duplicate or not to duplicate
When you create an index, you have two 
options for handling duplicate values:
✓
✓If records can have the same value in this 
field, click Yes (Duplicates OK).
Yes (Duplicates OK) is the most common 
choice.
✓
✓If every record needs a unique value in 
this field (such as volunteer IDs in your 
Volunteer table), click Yes (No Duplicates), 
as shown in the figure included here.
The No Duplicates setting tells Access to 
make sure that no two records have the 
same value in the indexed field.
Access indexes primary key fields automat-
ically as No Duplicates when you designate 
the primary key.

94
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Adding and removing indexes
After you decide on the correct fields to index (as outlined previously), creat-
ing an index is a snap.
In the following instructions, Step 4 can delete an existing field index. You 
may decide to delete a field index if it’s hindering data input more than it’s 
enhancing query performance.
To add or remove field indexes, open the table in Design view and follow 
these steps:
1.	Click the name of the field you want to index.
The blinking cursor lands in the field name.
2.	In the General tab of the Field Properties section, click the 
Indexed box.
Now the cursor moves into the Indexed box, and a down arrow appears 
on the right end of the box.

95

 Chapter 5: Table Tune Ups
If the Indexed property is unavailable, this field type doesn’t work with 
indexes. You can’t index Calculated, Attachment, OLE Object, or 
multivalued fields.
3.	Click the down arrow at the end of the Indexed box.
A list of index options appears:
•	Yes (Duplicates OK)
•	Yes (No Duplicates)
•	No
The previous sidebar “To duplicate or not to duplicate” shows how to 
determine the correct index setting.
4.	Select the index type you want from the list.
To remove an existing index from the selected field, click No.
5.	To make the change permanent, click the Save button on the Quick 
Access Toolbar.
If your table contains thousands of records, Access may take a few 
moments to create the index.

rom remembering to change your car’s oil every 3,000 miles to cleaning 
out your rain gutters in the autumn, everything in your surroundings 
needs a little maintenance now and then. Most of that maintenance involves 
tidying up, getting rid of old or unwanted things, or making improvements. 
Sometimes all these things are part of the maintenance process.
Well, it’s no different for your database — an Access database needs a tune-
up now and then, just to keep things running right. This can be as simple as 
checking for blank fields where you need to plug in missing data, as common 
as purging old or inaccurate records, or a practical matter such as changing 
the names of tables and fields so your database makes more sense to the 
people who use it.
Unlike getting your car serviced or cleaning out your gutters, however, main-
taining your database isn’t expensive or difficult. Of course, not keeping your 
database in good working order can get expensive — it can cost you in terms 
of your time, the potential impact of inaccurate records on your organization, 
more time (and paper) wasted printing reports that include obsolete data, 
and the confusion that plagues those who use a database that has incorrect 
(or vague) field and table names.
Don’t worry, though — for all those doomsday potentialities, the solution is 
as simple as a few clicks, a couple of double-clicks, and a little bit of typing, 
and it’s free!

98
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Opening a Table for Editing
When you open Access 2016 (as we discuss in Chapters 1 and 2), the work-
space offers you a list of recently opened databases, along with templates 
you can use to start a new database, as shown in Figure 6‑1.
To open a database from the Recent Databases list, just point to it and 
click once.
If you remember where your database is stored, but it isn’t in the Recent list, 
use either of the following options to use the Open view:
1.	Click the File tab to the left of the Home tab, and choose Open Other 
Files from the list of commands. Alternatively, if you’ve just opened 
Access, click the Open Other Files link at the bottom of the left-hand 
panel (shown in Figure 6-1).
Either way, the Open view appears onscreen, as shown in Figure 6‑2.
By default, the Open view displays your most recently used databases.
2.	If the database isn’t displayed, click This PC in the series of Open 
commands.
This displays the view shown in Figure 6‑3.
3.	When you find the database, open it by clicking its name.
The database file opens immediately, as shown in Figure 6‑4.
If you don’t see your database listed in on the right-hand side of the 
workspace (after clicking This PC), click the Browse button instead. This 
opens a dialog box through which you can navigate to the folder that 
contains your database.
An introductory screen known as a switchboard (or perhaps — utilizing 
a feature introduced in Access 2010 — a Navigation form) may appear 
instead of the tabbed dialog box. Access is telling you that your data-
base either contains some custom programming or was created by the 
Database Wizard. You probably have some special forms that help you 
interact with the information in your database. If you want to find out 
how to create your own navigation form, check out Chapter 23.
4.	Within the All Access Objects list on the left side of the workspace, 
look for the table you want to open.
Each table has its own listing, accompanied by a table icon.
5.	Double-click the table you want to edit.
The table opens in Datasheet view, and you can begin your maintenance 
of the data. You can add or remove fields or change the names of your 
fields — topics discussed later in this information-packed chapter.

Inserting Records and Fields
Ever gone on vacation and forgotten your toothpaste? Sure, you can prob-
ably just pick up a tube at a drugstore in the place you’re visiting, but it’s still 
a pain. The same “Darn!” feeling overcomes you when you realize you’ve left 
something out of your database suitcase. (Okay, you might use a different 
four-letter word in that case, but this is a family publication.)
Luckily, adding a forgotten record or field to your table is about as easy as 
making a quick trip to the drugstore for that forgotten toothpaste — so easy 
that you may forget to say “Darn!” (or any other word expressing regret) 
when you discover a missing field. Instead, you’ll calmly launch into the fol-
lowing steps — one set for inserting a missing record and one set for insert-
ing a missing field.
Adding a record
To add a record, follow these steps:
1.	In the Datasheet view of the table that’s missing a record, click inside 
the first empty cell at the bottom of the table — below the last dis-
played record in the table.
Your cursor blinks in the first field in that record, as shown in Figure 6‑5.
2.	Type your information for the first field.
If the first field is an AutoNumber type, then you’re automatically placed 
in the second field when you click the row. In the second field, you can 
begin typing the data for that field. As soon as you start typing, the 
AutoNumber field generates a new number and displays it in the field.
Don’t panic if the AutoNumber field seems to skip a number when it 
creates an entry for your new record. When an AutoNumber field skips 
a number, it means you probably entered (or at least started to enter) a 
record at some point during this (or a previous) data-entry session and 
then deleted it.
3.	Press Tab to move through the fields and enter all the data for this 
new record.
4.	When you finish entering data into the last field for the new record, 
you’re finished!
Because Access saves the new record automatically while you’re typing 
it, you have nothing more to do. Pretty neat, eh?
If you want to add another record, press Tab and type away, filling in yet 
another new record.

102
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
If you change your mind and want to kill the new addition, you have a couple 
of options:
✓
✓While the new record is in progress, press Ctrl+Z to undo whatever work 
you’ve done thus far on the new record.
✓
✓Right-click the cell to the far left of the record (the empty cell to the 
left of the first field). From the resulting pop-up menu, choose Delete 
Record. Click Yes when asked whether you’re sure about the deletion.
Inserting a field
With the field-challenged table open, follow these steps to add the field 
you’re missing:
1.	In Datasheet view, find the field heading aptly called Click to Add 
(see Figure 6-6).
The column is typically placed at the end of your existing fields — so be 
prepared to scroll all the way to the end to see it.
2.	Click the instructional Click to Add heading you found in Step 1.
A pop-up menu appears, from which you can choose the type of field 
this new field will be, as shown in Figure 6‑7.

3.	Choose a field type from the list.
The new field appears, entitled Field1, and the Click to Add column 
moves over one column. Field1 is highlighted and awaiting your new 
name for it, as shown in Figure 6‑8.
4.	Type the name of your new field and press Enter.
Your new field is created.
5.	To rearrange your fields so the new field is where you want it to be 
among the existing fields, click the heading of the field column you 
just created — and then click again.
On the first click, the entire column is highlighted, and the black down-
pointing arrow changes to a left-pointing white arrow. On the second 
click, the arrow acquires a small box just below it, indicating that you’re 
ready to move the column.
6.	Drag to the left or right depending on where you want to drop your

You can also tinker with settings that go with the data type you choose — 
for example, if you choose a Number format, you can use the buttons

Deleting a field
Getting rid of a field is no big deal — in fact, it might be too easy. Access 
does, at least, give you a little nudge (in the form of a dialog box) to make 
sure you’re positive you want to get rid of the field in question.
To get rid of an existing field that you no longer need, follow these steps:
1.	Right-click the heading for that field column.
2.	From the resulting pop-up menu, shown in Figure 6-11, choose Delete 
Field.
3.	When prompted, click Yes to confirm your desire to complete the 
deletion.

Modifying Field Content
Although your stuff is safely tucked away inside a table, you can reach in and 
make changes easily. In fact, editing your data is so easy that it’s hard to tell 
whether this is a good feature or a bad one.
Whenever you’re browsing through a table, please be careful! Access doesn’t 
warn you before saving changes to a record — even if the changes are acci-
dental. (If I were that kind of preachy author, I’d probably make a big, guilt-
laden point about how this “feature” of Access makes regular backups all the 
more important, but that’s not my style.)
To change something inside a record, follow these steps:
1.	Scroll through the table until you find the record that needs some 
adjusting.
2.	Click the field (the individual cell in the table) that you want to 
change.
The blinking line cursor pops into the field.
If your mouse has a wheel button, use the wheel to take a quick spin 
through the table. (For such a small innovation, that wheel is a big 
timesaver!)
3.	Change the field.
What you change and how you change it is up to you:
•	Replace the entire field: Press F2 to highlight the data and then type 
the new information. The new entry replaces the old one.
•	Repair a portion of the data in a field: Click the field and then use 
the right and left arrow keys to position the cursor exactly where 
you want to make the change.
•	Remove or add characters: Press Backspace to remove characters 
to the left of the cursor; press Delete to remove characters to the 
right. Insert new characters by typing.
If you’re in a time/date field and want to insert the current date, 
press Ctrl+; (semicolon). To insert the current time, press Ctrl+Shift+; 
(semicolon).
If you change your mind and want to restore the original data, press Esc 
or Ctrl+Z to cancel your edits.
4.	When you’re finished with the record, press Enter.

Name-Calling
You’ve built your table, and maybe you’ve done a stellar job from the 
get-go — you didn’t forget any fields, you put the fields in the right order, 
and you set up the fields to house the right kind of data. Well done, you!
Okay, back to reality. (Of course nothing in life is that simple, is it?) It’s not 
uncommon to realize, after building your table (and accepting my previous 
“Well done, you!”) that you need to make a few changes. You may need to 
change the table’s name or you might need to change one or more of the 
field names in the table. Or both! If this happens, it doesn’t mean you messed 
up or anything, it just means you’re a human being who, with even the most 
scrupulous planning and preparation, can make a mistake or change your 
mind — or perhaps the terminology has changed since the table was first 
created, and now it needs updating. Luckily, regardless of the reason you 
need to do it, Access makes it easy to make either kind of change.
Renaming fields
Uh-oh. The field name you used when you first built the table has been the 
source of some confusion. People don’t know what “Status” means — does it 
mean the members have paid their dues or does it refer to whether they’re 
active in the organization? It’s clear enough to you, but it’s important that 
other folks who use the data feel confident that they understand what’s in it.
This sort of field-naming dilemma is common when you’re setting up a table 
for the first time, and can even crop up later on, when you’re working with 
a table that’s been around and in use for a while. The need to edit field 
names can arise for any reason, at any time; it’s never too early or too late to 
edit them.
So, for whatever reason, you find you have to edit a field name. What to do?
Access makes it incredibly easy to rename a field — to keep it simple, do 
it first in Datasheet view. The simplicity doesn’t end with how the actual 
renaming takes place, either — as soon as you rename a field, Access updates 
a whole slew of things automatically:
✓
✓All connections from that field to other tables (if you’ve already set up 
your table relationships, as discussed in Chapter 5)
✓
✓All queries, reports, and other goodies that already use the field
What could be easier than that?

109

 Chapter 6: Remodeling Your Data
Working in Datasheet view
So when you’re ready, follow these steps:
1.	Double-click the field name, as shown in Figure 6-12.
The current name is highlighted in place, atop the column.
2.	Edit the name as needed:
•	To replace the current name entirely, type the new name while the 
current name is still highlighted.
While the field name is highlighted, the very next thing you type 
will replace the current name — so don’t start typing at that point 
unless you want to replace the entire field name.
•	To edit the name (leaving some of the current name in place), click 
inside the existing, selected name and then insert or remove char-
acters as needed.
3.	When you like the name you see, click in any cell in the table.
The new name appears at the top of the column, and you’re ready to do 
whatever you need:
•	Enter new records.
•	Edit another field.
•	Save the table (for design changes) and close it (if you’ve finished 
working).
Using the Fields tab
To rename a field in the Fields tab in Datasheet view, follow these steps:
1.	Click the field name that you want to edit.
You can also click in any cell in that column — just give Access some 
way of knowing which field you want to rename.
Figure 6-12:  
A selected

Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
2.	Click the Fields tab, in the Table Tools section of the Ribbon.
3.	In the Properties section, click Name & Caption.
A dialog box opens (as shown in Figure 6‑13) in which you can rename 
the field.
4.	Type the new name in the Name field in the dialog box.
5.	Press Enter or click OK to change the name.
This tells Access to accept your change, and you return to the table, 
with your field’s new name in place.
If you prefer the quick-and-easy way to change a field name (and have no 
other changes you need to make, such as editing the Field Size, via the Fields 
tab in the Table Tools section of the Ribbon), you can double-click the exist-
ing field name, and when it highlights, type the new name. Press Enter to con-
firm your change.
Renaming a table
Renaming an entire table is not as common as needing to rename a field, but 
it can happen. Maybe you misspelled the name. Maybe the name you gave 
it is too long, too short, or is misleading to people who have to guess which 
table to open when they’re looking for something in particular.
To edit the name of a table, follow these steps:
1.	Open the database that contains the table you want to rename.
With the chosen database listed on the left side of your Access work-
space, look for the table you wish to rename.
Don’t open the table itself. It can’t be open during the renaming process 
if you want those steps to work.

 Chapter 6: Remodeling Your Data
2.	Right-click the table name.
3.	Choose Rename from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 6-14.
The name is highlighted.
4.	Change the table name.
You can make the change in one of two ways:
•	Type the new name.
•	Modify the current name (use your arrow keys to move within the 
name and your Backspace and/or Delete keys to edit).
After you’ve renamed your table, all the items that link to or use it within 
your database will be updated to use the same table with the new name. You 
don’t need to re-create any of your queries, reports, forms, or relationships.

Turn Uh-Oh! into Yee-Hah!
It happens to everyone. You add, move, or change the name of a field and 
regret it later — or you rename your table and wish you hadn’t. What can you 
do? Call upon Access’ techniques for avoiding the panic that ensues when a 
mistake is made and you think you’re stuck with the results.
Now, none of the following three methods for cleaning up after a regrettable 
change are magical or really high-tech, but they are helpful. Here goes:
✓
✓You can recover from one addition or edit with the Undo command. 
Unfortunately, you cannot undo the deletion of a record. Access will 
warn you, though, if you attempt to delete one or more records; you can 
choose not to proceed if you’re not absolutely sure.
✓
✓Double-check any change you make before saving it. This sounds pain-
fully obvious, but really — just do it. And if the change is important, 
triple-check it. When you’re sure it’s correct, press Enter and commit the 
change to the table. Until you’re sure about the change you’re making, 
don’t click outside of the field. 
✓
✓Keep a good backup so you can quickly recover missing data and 
get on with your work. Good backups have no substitute. If you make 
good backups — which is as easy as using the File tab’s Save As com-
mand and then choosing Save Database As (I like to name the backup 
“DatabaseBackup-xx-xx-xxxx” where the x characters represent the date 
of the backup, and the word Database is exchanged for the name of 
the database you’re backing up). With regular backups, the chance of 
losing data is greatly reduced, your boss promotes you, your significant 
other unswervingly devotes his or her life to you, and you may even 
win the lottery. At the very least, you’ll sleep better, knowing that your 
data is safe.

f you have a sound table structure but poor data collection, your database 
won’t report anything of interest to its intended audience. You know the 
old saying, “garbage in, garbage out”? This chapter helps you limit the gar-
bage that is put into your tables by detailing five tools Access puts at your 
disposal. (Access doesn’t call them tools; it calls them properties.)
You don’t want the task of going back and cleaning up your data after it has 
all been typed. Better to type it correctly the first time. This chapter shows 
you how to use formatting, input masks, required fields, and validation to 
keep your data nice and tidy.
Access Table Settings
This chapter shows how to use the following five properties to help keep 
incorrect data out of your database:
✓
✓Format: Control how your data appears without changing the way it 
is stored.
✓
✓Input mask: Force data entry to follow the correct structure, such as 
typing phone numbers in the (###) ###-#### format.

114
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
✓
✓Required: Force the entry of data in the field before the record 
can be saved.
✓
✓Validation Rule: Require that data be typed in a field following a specific 
set of rules, such as a number between 0 and 100.
✓
✓Default Value: Auto-enter data when a new record is inserted.
All five properties are in the same place: in Table Design view on the General 
tab in the Field Properties section. Use the following steps to access and 
modify the five properties:
1.	Open the database file that contains the data you want to keep clean. 
From the Navigation pane, right-click the table you want to modify.
The shortcut menu appears.
2.	Choose Design View from the menu, as shown in Figure 7-1.
The table flips to Design view, showing its fields and field properties.
If the table you want is already on the screen in Datasheet view, just 
click the View button from the Home tab of the Ribbon. This toggles 
between Design and Datasheet views.

3.	Repeat these steps for each field whose properties you want to alter:
a.	Click the name of the field.
The General tab in the Field Properties section (the bottom half of 
the window) displays the details of the current field, as shown in 
Figure 7‑2. You’re ready to do your thing!
b.	In the Field Properties section, click in the Format, Input Mask, 
Default Value, Validation Rule, or Required boxes, and type 
your changes.
In the remainder of this chapter, I delve into these properties in 
more detail to show you what they do and how to modify them to 
suit your needs.
The Format, Required, Validation Rule, and Default Value properties can 
be modified in Datasheet view. Just click the Fields tab on the Ribbon 
and check out the Formatting, Properties, and Field Validation groups.
Validation Text has a box, too. It goes with the Validation Rule box (kind 
of like coffee and cream). The “Making your data toe the line with valida-
tion” section, later in this chapter, explains how these two properties 
work together to prevent the entry of unwanted data.
4.	When you’ve made all necessary property changes, click the Save 
button on the Quick Access Toolbar to keep your changes.
To reject your changes, close the table (click the x in its upper right 
corner) and click No in the resulting dialog box.

Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Using formats, masks, required fields, validations, and default values involves 
many more details, but use the preceding steps to get started. These steps 
are the same regardless of which property you apply.
The following sections tackle each property individually.
Field Data Formats
Formatting helps you see data in a recognizable, clear arrangement. Formats 
only change the way you see your data on the screen, not how your data is 
stored in the table.
Some field data types require different formatting codes than others. For 
example, text formatting uses different codes than numeric formatting. The 
following sections cover formats for the most common field data types.
If your format command doesn’t work the first time, follow these steps to 
troubleshoot it:
1.	Double-check the data type.
For example, if you see left-aligned numbers without a standard number 
of decimal places, you may have selected the Text data type for a 
numeric field. Just change the data type to Number or Currency and 
like magic, you have beautiful numbers!
2.	Review the format commands and make any necessary changes.
For example, if you see percent signs and your intention is dollar signs, 
just flip the format from Percent to Currency by using the Format 
Property drop-down list.
Apply formatting, minimize data-entry errors
Although formatting won’t stop inaccurate 
data entry, it can make data-entry errors more 
recognizable. Here’s how formatting can cut 
down on errors:
✓
✓Make errors more visible.
For example, suppose you need to type the 
number one million into a numeric field. 
Without formatting, you see this: 1000000. 
(Uh, how many zeros are in that?) With 
standard formatting, you see this: 1,000,000.
✓
✓Cut down on typing during data entry.
For example, phone numbers are often 
seen as (111) 222-3333. With text formatting 
applied to a phone number field, simply type 
1112223333. Access displays the phone 
number with the parentheses and the dash. 
(Can you say “fewer keystrokes”?)

117

 Chapter 7: Types, Masks, and Triggers
Text fields
Text fields can be formatted using four characters that affect capitalization, 
spacing, and punctuation.
Access does not have predesigned formats for text fields, but you can make 
your own. Just string together some special characters to construct a format-
ting string that Access can use to display the text in a standardized way.
Table 7‑1 lists the special characters that you can use to build your 
text formats.
Here’s what you need to know about the formatting codes in Table 7‑1.
Capitalization
By default, Access displays text fields with the actual capitalization of the 
stored data. However, Access can automatically display a field in all upper-
case (capital) or lowercase letters, regardless of how the data is stored.
Set the Format property of a short text or long text field to the greater-than 
or less-than symbol to affect the capitalization of the whole field.
Uppercase
The greater-than symbol (>) makes all the text in that field appear in upper-
case (capital) letters, regardless of how the text was typed. To use this 
option, type a single greater-than symbol in the Format box.
This format is great for abbreviating the names of U.S. states, whose abbre-
viations are normally seen as uppercase.
Lowercase
The less-than symbol (<) makes all the text in that field appear in lowercase, 
regardless of how the text was typed. To use this option, type a single less-
than symbol in the Format text box.
Table 7-1	
Formatting Codes for Text Fields
Character
Display Option
>
Show whole field as uppercase (capital letters).
<
Show whole field as lowercase.
@
Show a space in this position if there isn’t a data character.
&
Display a character if there is one; otherwise, don’t do anything.

118
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Spacing and punctuation
Access allows you to format the spacing and punctuation of typed text. 
Through formatting, you can add extra spaces or special characters 
like dashes.
When using the @ or & character in a format, always include one @ or & to rep-
resent each typed character in the field.
Show filler spaces
The at sign (@) forces Access to display either a character or a space in the 
field. If the typed field data is shorter than the formatting code, Access adds 
extra spaces to fill the format.
For example, if a field uses @@@@@@ as its format, but the field’s data is only 
three characters long (such as Tim or now), Access displays three spaces 
and then the data. If the field data is four characters long, the format pads the 
beginning of the entry with two spaces.
Don’t show filler spaces
The ampersand (&) means “display a character if there’s one to display; other-
wise, don’t do anything.”
You can use the ampersand to create special formats. For example, a Social 
Security number can use this format: &&&-&&-&&&&.
If someone types 123456789 in that field, Access applies the format and dis-
plays 123-45-6789, adding the dashes in the middle of the numbers by itself.
Make Access see red so you don’t
Here’s a great tip for highlighting missing text 
data in a record: When you’re typing data, 
sometimes you need to skip a text field because 
you don’t have that particular information 
at hand. Wouldn’t it be great if Access 
automatically marked the field as blank as a 
reminder for you to fill in the info later?
Access can create such a custom text format. 
For example, the following character string 
displays the word Unknown in red if the field 
doesn’t contain a value. Type the following 
command in the field’s Format text box exactly 
like this (there are no spaces between the 
characters in the string and punctuation):
@;”Unknown”[Red]
It’s easy to customize the preceding formatting 
example to suit your needs:
✓
✓Text: Between the quotes, substitute any 
display text you want instead of Unknown.
✓
✓Color: Between the square brackets, sub-
stitute any display color you want instead 
of Red.

119

 Chapter 7: Types, Masks, and Triggers
Formatting changes only the appearance of data, not the data itself. 
Therefore, if you intend to export the data to another program (such as 
Excel), the formatting won’t necessarily go with it. So if you type pa in a 
State field and apply the > formatting code to that field, the data will appear 
as PA in Access but will export to Excel as pa.
Number and currency fields
Microsoft makes it easy for you to apply numeric formats to your numeric 
fields. They built the seven most common formats into a drop-down menu in 
the Format property row.
To set a Number or Currency field format, follow these steps:
1.	With your table in Design view, click the Format text box for the field 
you’d like to format.
2.	Click the down arrow that appears at the right side of the box and 
select a format for your field.
Figure 7‑3 shows the drop-down menu, which is divided in half:
•	The left side shows each format’s given name.
•	The right side shows a sample of how each format looks.
Numeric formats change only the appearance of the number, not the number 
as it is stored. So if you select the Single Field Size and choose Standard 
to format a field that contains the number 1.235678, you see 1.24 on the 
screen — but Access stores 1.235678 in the field. Any calculations done with 
the numbers in that field will use the actual typed-in number, not the format-
ted number seen onscreen.
The following sections describe the numeric formats built into Access.
General Number format
The General Number format is the Access default. It merely displays what-
ever you put in the field without making any editorial adjustments to it. This 
includes decimal places. If you format the number 1.23456 to General, two 
decimal places, it will display as 1.23456. I know, it doesn’t make sense, but it 
is what it is!
Currency formats
The currency formats make a plain number field look like a currency field.

120
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Some numeric fields store decimal characters, and others do not — it all 
depends on the field size you select. So decimal formatting is irrelevant if you 
select a field size that doesn’t store decimal places (the Long Integer size, for 
example). Chapter 3 covers number fields and field sizes in more detail.
These two formats show the data with two decimal places (the “cents” part 
of a dollar amount), substituting zeros if decimals aren’t already present:
✓
✓Currency: Shows the local currency sign and punctuation (based on the 
Regional Settings in the Windows Control Panel).
Don’t assume that the Currency formats automatically perform an 
exchange-rate conversion for the selected currency. They don’t. They 
merely display the selected currency symbol in front of the value typed 
in the field.
✓
✓Euro: Uses the Euro symbol (ε) regardless of the Regional Settings.
Scientific, Percent, and Decimal formats
The remaining built-in formats are used for a variety of purposes, from dis-
playing a large number in scientific notation to showing decimals as percents:
✓
✓Fixed: Shows the decimal value without a comma as a thousands 
separator.
✓
✓Standard: Shows the decimal value with a thousands separator.
Figure 7-3:  
The number 
format list.

121

 Chapter 7: Types, Masks, and Triggers
For either Fixed or Standard format, you can adjust the number of deci-
mal places that appear:
•	By default, Fixed and Standard round the display to two decimal 
places via the Auto setting, which is the default.
•	To specify a different number of decimal places, type a number 
between 0 and 15 in the Decimal Places setting right below the 
Format setting.
✓
✓Percent: This format adds a percent sign after the number.
There’s no need to convert percentages to decimals for data entry. To 
enter 97%, type 97 in the field.
If your percentages are displayed only as 0.00% or 100.00%, the sidebar 
“What happened to my percentages?” has a solution.
✓
✓Scientific: Displays numbers in scientific notation (the first significant 
digits plus the number of places where the digits belong on the left or 
right side of the decimal point).
Scientific notation is mostly for very big numbers (like the distance light 
travels in a year) and very small numbers (like the distance light travels 
in a trillionth of a second) that are hard to measure precisely or read at 
a glance.
What happened to my percentages?
When you create a field with the Number data 
type, Access assigns the Long Integer field size 
by default. Because integers are by definition 
whole numbers, Access rounds any decimal 
number entered in such a field. So if you enter 
25 in a field with the Percent format and Access 
displays your entry as 0.00%, your entry:
✓
✓Automatically rounds to the nearest whole 
number (in my example, 0).
✓
✓Always displays zeros in the decimal 
places.
The solution? Change the Field Size setting 
(pictured in the following figure) from Long 
Integer to Single. This setting tells Access to 
remember the decimal part of the number.

122
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Date/time fields
Microsoft provides you with a drop-down menu full of ready-to-use date and 
time formats. Here’s how to apply a date/time format to a field:
1.	With your table in Design view, click the Format text box for the field 
you’d like to format.
2.	Click the down arrow that appears on the right side of the text box.
The menu shown in Figure 7‑4 drops down to serve you.
3.	Select the format you want to use.
Keep these tips in mind when you apply a date/time format:
✓
✓When you use one of the longer formats, such as General Date or Long 
Date, make sure that the datasheet column is wide enough to display all 
the information. Otherwise, Access will fill the field with number sym-
bols (#), making the date unreadable.
✓
✓If more than one person uses the database, choose a format that pro-
vides more information, not less information.
My clients often ask me to provide a date in the m/d/yy format with a two-
digit year (such as 10/1/16 rather than 10/1/2016). To display a date with a 
two-digit year, type the following in the format box: m/d/yy.

Yes/No fields
You can say only so much about a field with three options. Oddly, Yes/No 
fields are set to the Yes/No formatting by default.
If you want the ability to type Yes/No, True/False, or On/Off in the field, make 
sure that Display Control in the Lookup tab (next to the General tab) is set to 
Combo Box. Otherwise, you’ll have check boxes in your field (because Check 
Box is the default display for a Yes/No field).
Allowable Yes/No field entries
Here’s what you can type in a Yes/No field (see Figure 7‑5):
✓
✓Yes and No (this is the default)
✓
✓On and Off
✓
✓True and False
Yes and No is the default, but you can change how a Yes/No field formats its 
content. Here’s how:
1.	With your table in Design view, click the Format text box for the field 
you’d like to format.
2.	Click the down arrow that appears on the text box’s right side.
The menu of three Yes/No formats drops down for your selection.
3.	Select the format you want to use.
Create your own Yes/No format
To display your own choices instead of a boring Yes and No, type a cus-
tomized entry in the Format box. A good example format looks something 
like this:
”REORDER”[Red]; “In stock”[Green]
Figure 7-5:  
Not much to 
talk about 
with Yes/No 
formatting.

124
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
The No and Yes parts of the format are separated by a semicolon (;).
✓
✓The part on the left appears if the field is equal to No.
✓
✓The part on the right appears if the field is equal to Yes.
With the preceding example, type Yes in the field, and the text In stock 
appears in green. Type No in the field, and REORDER screams a warning in 
bright red.
A custom Yes/No format simply changes the way the typed data appears. 
A Yes/No field will still accept only the entries as outlined in the previous 
section “Allowable Yes/No field entries,” regardless of the custom format 
applied to it.
You can type any words between the quotes and any Access-allowed color 
names between the square brackets. Who knew that formatting could be 
so much fun!
Gaining Control of Data Entry
The remaining sections in this chapter explore Access field properties that 
allow you to control what data is entered in a field. The more you control the 
data that goes into your tables, the less you’ll need to clean it up after it’s 
been entered.
You really need to put a mask 
on those fields
An input mask is a series of characters that tells Access what data to expect 
in a particular field — and actually prevents users from typing data that does 
not fit the mask. If you want a field to contain all numbers and no letters, an 
input mask can do the job. It can also do the reverse (all letters and no num-
bers) and almost any combination in between. Short Text, Number, Date/
Time, and Currency field data types accept input masks.
Formatting (shown previously in this chapter) can make some data entry 
errors visible, but formatting doesn’t block errors. Input masks, on the other 
hand, keep that bad data out.
Input masks are stored in the Input Mask property box of the field’s General 
tab. (The beginning of this chapter shows the steps to follow to access the 
General tab.)

125

 Chapter 7: Types, Masks, and Triggers
Add these masks to fields that contain dates, times, phone numbers, Social 
Security numbers, passwords, and zip codes, among other things. You’ll 
be so glad you did. If you don’t, expect to see plenty of phone numbers like 
111-123 and zip codes like 0854.
Input masks work best with short, consistent data. Numbers and number-and-
letter combinations that follow a consistent pattern are excellent candidates. 
Phone numbers, dates, and zip codes are common examples of data items 
that follow a consistent pattern.
You create an input mask in one of two ways:
✓
✓Ask the Input Mask Wizard for help.
The Input Mask Wizard can’t possibly contain every mask for every 
situation. It only knows about text and date fields, and offers just a few 
options.
Always start with the wizard. If it doesn’t have your solution, then you 
need to manually build the mask.
✓
✓Type the mask manually.
Create the mask manually if your data follows a consistent pattern (such 
as a six-digit part number) that isn’t a choice offered by the Input Mask 
Wizard.
Using the Input Mask Wizard
The Input Mask Wizard gladly helps if you’re making a mask for text fields 
(such as those containing phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and 
United States zip codes) or simple date and time fields.
If your data doesn’t fit one of the masks that the wizard provides yet follows 
a consistent pattern, check the next section, which shows how to create a 
mask manually.
To ask for the wizard’s help, follow these steps:
1.	Open the database file that contains the data you want to mask. From 
the Navigation pane, right-click the table you want to modify and 
choose Design View.
The table flips into Design view.
2.	Click the name of the field that will receive the input mask.
You can use the wizard only with text and date/time fields.
The General tab in the Field Properties section (the bottom half of the 
window) displays the details of the current field.

126
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
3.	Click the Input Mask box.
The cursor monotonously blinks away in the Input Mask box. To the 
right of the box, a small button with three dots appears. That’s the 
Builder button, which comes into play in the next step.
4.	Click the Builder button.
The wizard appears, offering a choice of input masks, as shown in 
Figure 7‑6.
5.	Scroll through the list of input masks to find what you want.
6.	Click the input mask you want.
To play with the mask a bit and see how it works, click the Try It area at 
the bottom of the dialog box and then type a sample entry.
7.	Click Finish to close the wizard and use the mask with your field.
If you click Next instead of Finish, the wizard gives you more options, 
but I recommend avoiding them. (The sidebar “The rest of the Input 
Mask Wizard” has the details.)
The chosen mask appears in the Input Mask text box in the table’s Field 
Properties section, as shown in Figure 7‑7.
Making a mask by hand
It’s not uncommon to need a mask that the Input Mask Wizard doesn’t pro-
vide. If your fingers can string together a seemingly nonsensical string of 
characters on the keyboard, then you can make your own input mask. The 
trick is making sense out of all the nonsensical characters.

The rest of the Input Mask Wizard
This sidebar shows my recommendations for 
the last two steps of the Input Mask Wizard. If 
you click Next instead of Finish at the end of my 
steps, the Input Mask Wizard continues asking 
you about changing some obscure settings that 
are best left at the defaults:
✓
✓The placeholder character for the input 
mask
The placeholder character in the mask rep-
resents the actual typed character by the 
user. The default is a dash. You can change 
from the default to a #, @, !, $, %, or *.
✓
✓Storing the data with the symbols included 
within the input mask
For example, a Social Security number 
could be stored with or without the dashes.
The default is Without the Symbols in the 
Mask (for don’t store the symbols). I recom-
mend you keep it that way. The mask takes 
care of the data display. Why store extra 
characters in your database?

128
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
Table 7‑2 shows the codes you can use in an input mask; each code has an 
explanation of the character(s) that it represents:
✓
✓Required Code: Users must type that type of character (whether they 
actually want to or not).
✓
✓Optional Code: Users can type or not type the kind of character 
mentioned in the first column. For example, if your input mask is 
99/99/0000;0;_, you can type 1/1/2016 or 01/01/2016 but you can’t type 
1/1/16 or 01/01/16. 
You must use the input mask codes to design an input mask.
Designing an input mask
Before you can create a mask, you must determine what mask codes you’ll 
need to build the mask. Here’s how:
1.	On a piece of paper, write several examples of the data that the mask 
should allow into the table.
If the information you’re storing has subtle variations (such as part 
numbers that end in either a letter/number or letter/letter combination), 
include examples of the various possibilities so that your input mask 
accepts them all. You can’t build a mask if you don’t know your data.
Table 7-2	
Codes for Input Masks

Optional Code
Digits (0 to 9) only.

 Chapter 7: Types, Masks, and Triggers
2.	Write a simple description of the data, including which elements are 
required and which are optional.
For example, if your sample is a part number that looks like 728816ABC7, 
write six numbers, three letters, one number; all parts are required.
Remember to allow for the variations, if you have any. The difference 
between one number and one letter or number can be crucial.
If you need to include a special character in your mask, like a dash 
or parentheses or a combination of static characters, use this list 
for guidance:
•	Dash, slash, or parenthesis characters: Put a backslash (\) in front 
of it, such as \- for a dash.
•	Multiple characters: Put quotation marks around them.
For example, an area code may be separated from the rest of the 
number by both a parenthesis and a space, like this:
(567) 555-2345
The corresponding mask has quotes around the parenthesis and 
the space, like this: !\(999") "999\-9999.
The phone-number mask also begins with an exclamation point. 
The exclamation point forces the typed data to fill the mask from 
right to left rather than left to right (the default). What’s the big 
deal about that? Some phone numbers don’t require an area code; 
others do. Suppose you have to type a seven-digit phone number. 
If not for the right-to-left entry, you’d have to move the cursor 
past the area code (___) placeholder part of the mask to get to the 
beginning of the seven-digit part.
If your field includes letters and you want them to be stored as all-
uppercase, add a greater-than symbol (>) to the beginning of your mask. 
To store the letters as all-lowercase, use a less-than symbol (<) instead.
3.	Write the mask codes that represent the elements you’ve written 
in Step 2.
If (for example), you wrote “six numbers, three letters, one number; 
all parts are required” in Step 2, then you need the mask codes 
000000LLL0. Refer to Table 7‑2.
Putting on your input mask
Now that you have your mask written on paper, it’s time to enter it in Access. 
Here’s how:
1.	With the database file open, right-click the table you want to work 
with and then choose Design View from the shortcut menu.
The table flips to Design view.

130
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
2.	Click the name of the field you want to adjust.
3.	Click the Input Mask box.
The cursor blinks in the Input Mask box.
4.	Carefully type your finished mask into the Input Mask area of the 
Field Properties section (as shown in Figure 7-8).
If you don’t know what to type here, see the preceding section.
5.	Click the View button on the Ribbon to switch to Datasheet view and 
place the cursor in the masked field to check out your new mask.
When prompted to Save, click Yes so you don’t lose your work.
When you’ve entered the mask and have saved the table, try these tests:
a.	Type something unacceptable into the masked field.
The input mask should prevent you from typing an incorrect value 
(see Figure 7‑9).
b.	Try an acceptable entry.
The mask should accept your entry.
c.	Try all the variations you identified in the mask-planning process.
All should be accepted by the mask. If they are not, switch back to 
Design view and tweak your mask until all possible variations of 
your entry are acceptable to the mask.

tion mask.

 Chapter 7: Types, Masks, and Triggers
If you’re adding a mask to an existing table with data, Access doesn’t report 
to you on existing records that fail the mask; it gives that data a free pass to 
exist as typed. To enforce the mask on existing records, you’ll need to repeat 
these steps for each record:
1.	Click the field in the record.
2.	Edit the data.
You can delete the last character and then retype it.
When you move the cursor out of the field, you’ll see the warning if the 
data doesn’t comply with the mask.
To require or not to require
On many occasions, you will not want a record typed until all the facts are in. 
For example, you certainly wouldn’t want an order typed without an order 
date, customer, and product information. The Required property prevents 
records that are missing essential data from being saved to a table.
The Required property has two settings:
✓
✓Yes: The user cannot save the record without putting something in 
the field.
✓
✓No: Anything goes. (This is the default.)
To require data entry in a field, follow these simple steps:
1.	While in a table’s Design view, click the field in which you want to 
require data entry.
2.	Click in the Required box on the General tab in the Field Properties 
section.
An arrow appears at the end of the box. By default, the box reads No.
3.	Click the arrow and select Yes from the list that appears, as shown in 
Figure 7-10.
Watch out, the field is now required!
Figure 7-9:  
I have 
violated the 
input mask.

132
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
4.	Click the View button on the Ribbon to switch to Datasheet view and 
then test your work.
Type a new record, omitting data entry in the required field. You should 
see a message box gently reminding you for forgetting the required data.
Don’t get overzealous with the Required property and set it to Yes for 
nonessential fields. For example, a volunteer without an email address is 
usually better than no volunteer at all.
Making your data toe the line 
with validation
With a validation, Access tests the incoming data to make sure that it’s 
what you want in the table. If the data isn’t right, the validation displays an 
error message (you get to choose what it says) and makes the user try the 
entry again.
Like the other options in this chapter, validations are stored in the General 
tab of the Field Properties area. Two options relate to validations:
✓
✓Validation Rule: This rule is the validation itself.
✓
✓Validation Text: The text is the error message you want Access to dis-
play when some data that violates the validation rule is typed.
Validations work best with number, currency, and date fields. Creating a vali-
dation for a text field is possible, but the validations tend to get very compli-
cated very fast.
Tables 7‑3 and 7‑4 contain some ready-to-use validations that cover the most 
common needs. These are ready for you to type into the General tab of the 
Field Properties area.
Figure 7-10:  
The 
Required 
property is 
set to Yes.


 Chapter 7: Types, Masks, and Triggers
Here’s how to enter a validation rule:
1.	With the database file open, right-click the table you want to work 
with and choose Design View from the shortcut menu.
The table flips to Design view.
2.	Click the name of the field you want to adjust.
3.	Click the Validation Rule box.
The cursor blinks in the Validation Rule box.
4.	Type the validation rule that matches your data.
For example, if you want to allow only numbers between 0 and 1,000 in 
the field, type >0 AND <1000.
5.	Click in the Validation Text field.
The cursor blinks in the Validation Text box.
6.	Type the message you’d like the user to see if he breaks the 
validation rule.
Keep it short and simple. For my example in Step 4, you might type 
Please enter a number greater than 0 and less than 1,000.

Must be between January 1, 2010 and 
today (inclusive)

134
Part II: Getting It All on the Table 
When you apply a validation rule to a field, watch out for these gotchas:
✓
✓When using AND, both sides of the validation rule must be true before 
the rule is met.
✓
✓With OR, only one side of the rule needs to be true for the entire rule 
to be true.
✓
✓Be careful when combining >= and <=. Accidentally coming up with one 
that can’t be true (such as <= 0 AND >= 100) is too easy!
You can test your new validation rules against existing table data by clicking 
the Test Validation Rules button in the Tools group of the Ribbon’s Design 
tab. Just follow the prompts in the resulting message boxes (to save your 
table, for example), and you’ll know if your data likes the new rules!
Give Your Fingers a Mini 
Vacation by Default
Wouldn’t it be a dream come true if every time you entered a new volunteer, 
you didn’t have to type the current date in the Start Date field? Well, guess 
what? Access is all about making your dreams come true! (Your data-entry 
dreams, anyway.) It accomplishes this feat through the Default Value prop-
erty. The Default Value property places the data that you specify for a field 
into that field every time a new record is inserted into the field’s table. Yes, it 
sounds too good to be true — but I assure you it is not!
Here’s how to enter a default value:
1.	With the database file open, right-click the table you want to work 
with, and choose Design View from the shortcut menu.
The table flips into Design view.
2.	Click the name of the field you want to adjust.
3.	Click the Default Value box.
The cursor blinks in the Default Value box. The Builder button appears.
4.	Type the data that you’d like to appear for that field when a new 
record is inserted.
For example, if you want the current date to appear in a Start Date 
field for each new record, type Date() in the Default Value text box. (See 
Figure 7‑11.)

A
 
ccess forms are similar to paper forms in their function — they’re used 
in part to collect data — but Access forms go beyond paper forms by 
having a direct connection to the database tables that store the collected 
information. In the “old days,” after you completed a paper form, some poor 
soul had to manually organize and file each form in a file cabinet or tabulate 
results by hand. With the advent of electronic databases such as Access, the 
data typed into an electronic form is simultaneously placed in the file cabinet 
(the table) connected to that form.
Like reports and queries, forms are named and stored in the database file. 
Forms are full-fledged Access objects, so you can customize them easily to 
meet the needs of your business.
This chapter shows what forms can do for you, shows you how to 
make forms, and provides tips for customizing forms so they’re exactly 
what you need.
Generating Forms
Depending on your needs, you can create forms in three ways:
✓
✓The Form tools make attractive forms with a click of the mouse.
✓
✓The Form Wizard asks some questions and then creates an attractive 
form based on your answers.
✓
✓The Form Design and Blank Form buttons let you start with a blank form 
and build from the ground up.

140
Part III: Data Management Mania 
The Form tools and the Form Wizard make it easy to create a form. I focus 
on using these two methods to build forms. Building forms from scratch in 
Design or Layout view is beyond the scope of this book.
The Form Wizard and Form tools are a time-saving gift from your friends at 
Microsoft. Use them to create your forms. They do the hard stuff so all you 
have to do is provide the finishing touches.
Use these criteria to determine which form-building tool to use:
✓
✓Use the Form tools if
•	You want all fields in the selected table or query to appear on 
the form.
•	You don’t want control over the type of style that is applied to 
the form.
Why use forms?
Access forms have all kinds of advantages 
over old-fashioned paper forms — and they’ll 
spoil you if you’re used to wandering through 
your data in Datasheet view (where the data 
appears in a spreadsheet format).
Here are the most important reasons for using 
Access forms to manage your data:
✓
✓Say goodbye to Datasheet view: Main­
taining your data in Datasheet view isn’t 
much fun. The constant scrolling back and 
forth and up and down can drive you crazy. 
With a form, you focus on one record at a 
time with all of its data laid out on a single 
screen. Maintaining your data becomes a 
snap, and you can watch those datasheet-
induced headaches disappear.
✓
✓Modify at will: When your needs change, 
update the form in Design view. When you 
need to collect a new piece of data, just 
add a field to the appropriate table and to 
the form associated with that table.
✓
✓See your data any way you want: Access 
lets you take one set of data and maintain it 
with as many different forms as you want. 
Create a special form for the data-entry 
department, another for your manager, and 
a third for yourself. Each form can display 
just the fields that those people need to see. 
Well-designed forms give the right informa-
tion to the right people without revealing 
unnecessary data.
✓
✓View the entries in a table or the results of 
a query: Forms pull information from tables 
or queries with equal ease.
✓
✓Combine data from multiple tables: One 
form can display data from several related 
tables. Forms automatically use the rela-
tionships built into your database. So you 
can (for example) see a list of volunteers 
and their corresponding event participation 
all on one form.

141

 Chapter 8: A Form for All Reasons
✓
✓Use the Form Wizard (covered later in this chapter) if
•	You want to select specific fields for your form.
•	You want to select fields from more than one table or query.
•	You want to choose from a list of layouts for your form.
Keeping it simple: Form tools
I have good and bad news about these tools:
✓
✓Good news: They’re fast, and they don’t ask any questions or talk back!
✓
✓Bad news: They’re extremely inflexible buggers.
You want a larger font and a different background color? Keep it to your-
self. The Form tools decide what font, colors, and layout you get.
After you create a form with a Form tool, you can modify the form. In this 
chapter, the “Customizing Form Parts” section gives you the straight scoop.
Meet the Form tools
There are three kinds of Form tools:
✓
✓A simple form displays one record at a time.
	
Suppose you have a Locations table and 
an Events table related by a Location 
ID field (see Chapter 5 for an explanation 
of table relationships). If you select the 
Locations table before you click the Simple 
Form tool, you get a form that displays not 
only locations data but also events data for 
that location.
✓
✓Split forms display one record on the top 
half of the form and all records on the 
bottom half — think a single volunteer 
record on the top half and the remaining 
volunteers on the bottom half. Click a volun-
teer on the bottom half, and you’ll see that 
entire volunteer’s record on the top half.
Use a split form if you want to browse and 
edit multiple records in a user-friendly 
fashion. The split-screen format lets you 
easily browse records in the datasheet 
portion (bottom half) of the form and see 
and edit each record’s detail in the cur-
rently selected record portion (top half) of 
the form.
✓
✓Multiple Items shows all records from the 
data source in a beautiful datasheet-like 
format.
Create a Multiple Items form if you want 
to see all records at a glance. This usually 
works best with tables that contain only a 
small number of fields; each field translates 
into a column on your screen.

The Form Wizard springs into action, as shown in Figure 8‑3.
4.	Using the Tables/Queries drop-down menu, select the source of the 
form’s fields:
a.	Click the down arrow to list the database’s tables and queries.
b.	Select the table or query that contains the fields you want to view 
with this form.
The Form Wizard lists the available fields.
5.	Select the fields you want.
•	To select individual fields, double-click each field you want in the 
Available Fields list. (Again, see Figure 8‑3.)
•	If you want to add all the fields from your table or query to your 
form, click the >> button in the middle of the screen.
Feel free to select fields from different tables, provided the tables are 
related properly. The wizard will not let you select fields from unrelated 
tables. For more on relating tables, see Chapter 5, Table Tune Ups.

Part III: Data Management Mania 
To remove a field that you accidentally choose, double-click its name in 
the Selected Fields list. The field jumps back to the Available Fields side 
of the dialog box.
6.	After you’ve selected all the fields you want to include on your form, 
click Next.
If you selected fields from more than one table, the Form Wizard takes 
a moment to ask how you want to organize the data in your form. If 
you choose to organize your data by the parent table (Chapter 5 shows 
how), you’ll be asked to show the child table data as either
•	Subform: Shows data from both tables on one form.
•	Linked form: Creates a button that, when clicked, will take you to a 
new form that displays the child table data.
7.	When the wizard asks about the form layout, choose one of the follow-
ing layouts and then click Next:
•	Columnar: Records are shown one at a time.
•	Tabular: Multiple records are shown at the same time with an 
attractive style applied to the form.
•	Datasheet: Multiple records are shown at the same time in a rather 
unattractive spreadsheet-like way.
•	Justified: Arranges the fields on the form in a tidy block of rows 
that have pronounced left and right margins.
Don’t know which layout is best? Check out the “Giving forms the right 
look” sidebar.

 Chapter 8: A Form for All Reasons
8.	Enter a descriptive title in the What Title Do You Want for Your Form? 
box at the top of the Form Wizard screen.
There are good reasons to give your form a descriptive title rather than 
the default name (which is the name of the data source):
•	Tables and forms that share the same name can become  
confusing.
•	The name you type is used to save your form. Letters and numbers 
are allowed in form names. It’s a great opportunity to understand 
form usage through its name.
9.	Click Finish to open the form in Form view.
Your new form appears onscreen, as shown in Figure 8‑4.
The Form Wizard automatically saves the form as part of the creation 
process. You don’t need to manually save and name it. All saved forms 
display in the Forms section of the Navigation pane.
The rest of this chapter shows how to customize forms you’ve created with 
the Form Wizard and Form tools.

Giving forms the right look
Depending on the data you select for your form 
(for example, whether you use more than one 
table), you have different options for displaying 
your data:
✓
✓Columnar: A classic, one-record-per-page 
form.
	
Most data-entry forms are Columnar.
✓
✓Tabular: A multiple-records-per-page form.
	
This layout is best for tables with few fields, 
like the form based on the AmenitiesList 
table (shown in the figure to the right). For 
tables with a larger number of fields, be 
prepared to scroll back and forth if you 
select Tabular.
✓
✓Datasheet: A spreadsheet-like grid.
	
Essentially, this is an Access Datasheet 
view embedded in a form. It’s appropriate 
when an Excel-style presentation suits your 
needs.
✓
✓Justified: One record of data is laid out 
across the whole form over multiple rows 
(shown in the following figure).
	
This layout may be especially useful when 
you have memo fields.

 Chapter 8: A Form for All Reasons
Customizing Form Parts
The Access 2016 Form tools and Form Wizard do a great job building forms. 
In fact, for the typical user, they do just about everything — but they don’t 
always do it all. So you may need to do some form-tweaking.
If you know some form-design basics, you can clean up most of the problems 
left behind by the Form tools and Form Wizard.
This section shows how to change the overall look of the form. In particular, 
you get a handle on moving, sizing, labeling, and formatting controls on your 
forms. (A control is any design element on a form — say, a line, label, or data-
entry box — that affects the appearance of the form. More about that later in 
the chapter.)
Taking the Layout view
You can make form-design changes in either Design or Layout view.
The sidebar “A form with a view” explains these views.
These instructions concentrate on Layout view because it’s easier to use.
To enter Layout view, follow these steps:
1.	On the Navigation pane, right-click the form you’d like to modify.
The shortcut menu appears.
2.	Select Layout View from the shortcut menu.
How can you tell whether you’re in Layout view or Form view? Look at the 
status bar in the lower left corner of your screen. It tells you the current view 
for an open form.
The theme’s the thing
After building your new form with the Form Wizard or Form tools, you may 
not like the appearance that the tools have chosen for your form. Fear not! 
It’s easy to change the look of the form by using the Theme group of buttons. 
Here’s how:
1.	From the Navigation pane, right-click the form that needs a new look 
and choose Layout View from the menu that appears.
The form opens in Layout view.

148
Part III: Data Management Mania 
2.	Click the Design tab on the Ribbon.
Several button groups appear on the Ribbon, including the Themes 
group. (See Figure 8‑5.)
3.	Click the Themes button.
An illustrated list (called a Gallery) of themes opens.
4.	Roll the mouse pointer slowly over each theme.
The form in the background changes to match the highlighted theme.
5.	When you’ve found the theme you like, click it to select it from the 
drop-down list and apply it to the form.
A form with a view
Access forms have multiple personalities, all 
useful: They can be displayed in several ways, 
called views. Each view serves a purpose in 
using or maintaining the form.
Use the view buttons on the right side of the 
status bar to switch between these views. (The 
following figure shows the Form View tools on 
the status bar.)
Here are the views:
✓
✓Design: Sound familiar? Every Access 
object has its Design view.
	
In this view, you can modify the layout and 
appearance of the objects (called controls) 
on the form.
✓
✓Layout: Use this view to see data on the 
form and edit its layout and appearance 
simultaneously. Now if that isn’t fun, I don’t 
know what is!
	
This view is very helpful for stuff like sizing 
controls properly and choosing fonts.
✓
✓Form: Yes, a form has a Form view. Bizarre 
but true.
	
This view displays the data connected to 
the form, but unlike Layout view, the design 
of the form cannot be altered. End users of 
the database typically see all forms in Form 
view.

group on the 
Ribbon.

 Chapter 8: A Form for All Reasons
Choose a theme with fonts and colors that are easy on the eyes, such as soft 
colors and simple fonts. Form users will thank you for it!
Managing form controls
A control is any design element (such as a line, label, or data-entry text box) 
that appears on a form. The Form Wizard and Form tools do a fine job of 
constructing forms but often don’t place or size them just right. This section 
discusses how to take charge of your controls.
Control types
The two most common control types display data pulled from an underlying 
table or query (as with a text box) or supply a design element to keep the 
data organized on the form (as with a line).
Here are the most common form controls:
✓
✓Text box: The box where you type your data.
Text boxes are either bound (a way of saying linked) to a table field or 
unbound (containing a calculation derived from other fields in a table).
✓
✓Label: The descriptive text next to the control or the title of the form.
✓
✓Combo box: A drop-down list of choices.
✓
✓List box: A box that contains a list of choices, from which the user can 
choose more than one item.
✓
✓Check box: A square box attached to a field that can store only true/
false, on/off, or yes/no answers. For example, a personnel table may 
have a field called Married. Either you are or you aren’t.
✓
✓Option Group: A box that contains related choices where only one 
choice is allowed. For example, suppose a marital status field contains 
Married, Single, and Divorced choices. The option group control bound 
to that field would allow only one of those three choices.
✓
✓Subform: A form inside another form.
Subforms usually display the “many” records of the “one” record when 
tables are in a one-to-many relationship. (For details on table relation-
ships, see Chapter 5.)
If your form is columnar (most are) and you’ve created it with the Form 
Wizard or Form tools, all text boxes and labels on the form are anchored. 
Anchored controls behave as a group when you size them. Additionally, you 
can move anchored controls as long as they’re among the other controls in a 
group; you can’t move them if they’re outside the group.

150
Part III: Data Management Mania 
Creating controls
Most controls have a Control Wizard associated with them. Once you create 
the control, the wizard appears and guides you through the process. Here are 
the general steps to create a control:
1.	From the Navigation pane, right-click the form that’s to get the new 
control and choose Design View.
2.	Click the Design tab on the Ribbon if necessary.
The Controls group appears (see Figure 8‑6).
3.	From the Controls group, click the appropriate button for the new con-
trol (such as combo box) and roll the mouse onto the form.
The mouse pointer changes to a plus sign and icon of the con-
trol selected.
4.	Position the mouse at the location on the form where you’d like the 
new control to appear, then press and drag diagonally to draw the 
control.
The control wizard appears if applicable.
5.	If you’ve selected a control that has a Control Wizard, follow the steps 
in the Control Wizard and then click Finish.
The control appears on the form.
Don’t see a Control Wizard after creating a new control? Control Wizards 
are turned on by default. If, for some reason, yours are not on, choose Use 
Control Wizards toward the bottom of the Controls group. Note: Click the 
More button (dash with down arrowhead button) located at the lower right 
of the Controls group to see the Use Control Wizards option (see Figure 8‑7).
Moving controls
To move a control, enter Layout view (as shown previously in this chapter) 
and then follow these steps:
Figure 8-6:  
The Controls 
group on the 
Ribbon.

151

 Chapter 8: A Form for All Reasons
1.	Put the mouse pointer anywhere on the control that you want 
to move.
The mouse pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
2.	Hold down the left mouse button.
The control is selected, so a thick border appears around it. See 
Figure 8‑8 for an example of a selected control.
To select additional controls such as a label corresponding to a text box, 
press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking the additional control. A thick 
border will appear around all selected controls.
3.	Drag the control to its new location.
A line follows the mouse pointer as you drag up, down, left, or right.
4.	When the control is in position, release the mouse button.
The control drops smoothly into place.
If you don’t like an adjustment you’ve made, press Ctrl+Z to undo the 
change and start over from scratch. Access has multiple undo levels, so 
play to your heart’s content; you can always undo any mistakes.

152
Part III: Data Management Mania 
Sizing controls
Sometimes the Form Wizard and Form tools fall a bit short (literally) when 
they’re sizing your text boxes and labels. A common problem is that the last 
part of the information displayed in a label or text box is cut off.
To size a control, enter Layout view (as shown previously in this chapter) 
and then follow these steps:
1.	Put the mouse pointer on the control that you want to size.
The mouse pointer changes to a four-headed arrow. If the controls are 
anchored, it doesn’t matter which control you roll the mouse pointer over.
2.	Click to select the control.
A thick border appears around the control to indicate that the control 
is selected.
3.	Move the mouse pointer to the edge of the selected control.
A double-arrow pointer shape appears.
4.	Click and drag to resize the control.
Anchored controls size together horizontally within the same column 
and vertically within the same row. So when you change the width of 
one control in a column, all are changed to that same width. When you 
change the height of one control in a row, all in that row are changed to 
the same height.

 Chapter 8: A Form for All Reasons
Editing labels
The Form Wizard and Form tools use field names or captions as control 
labels when they build your forms. If you abbreviated a field name (say, 
FName for First Name) or caption when creating a table, that abbreviation 
will become the label for the control created by the Form Wizard and Form 
tools. So, if a label doesn’t quite say what it should, you’ll need to know how 
to edit the text in it.
To edit a label, enter Layout view (as shown previously in this chapter) 
and try this:
1.	Put the mouse pointer anywhere on the label that you want to edit.
The mouse pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
2.	Click to select the label control.
A thick border indicates that the control is selected.
3.	Click the word you’d like to edit.
A blinking cursor appears on the word.
4.	Edit the word.
5.	Click outside of the label control.
The label is deselected and the edit is preserved.
Deleting controls
Sometimes an Access form contains an unneeded or unwanted control:
✓
✓Maybe you selected an unwanted field while using the Form Wizard.
✓
✓Maybe you added a control (such as a line) and in retrospect decided it 
wasn’t needed.
✓
✓Maybe you’re just tired of looking at that control.
Here’s how you remove the control:
1.	In Layout view, put the mouse pointer anywhere on the control that 
you want to delete.
The arrow mouse pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
2.	Click to select the control.
A thick border appears around the control, indicating that it is selected.
3.	Tap the Delete key on your keyboard.
The unwanted control disappears into digital oblivion.

154
Part III: Data Management Mania 
When you delete a text box, its corresponding label will also be deleted. 
When you delete a label, however, its corresponding text box (if there is one) 
won’t be deleted. Go figure!
Managing Data in Form View
You’re done with form design and ready to take it for a drive. This section 
explains how to move between records, start a new record, and more.
Navigating and finding records
How do you move between records on the form? The Navigation buttons at 
the lower left of the form (see Figure 8‑9) make it easy to:
✓
✓Move between records: Click the right arrowhead (>) to move forward, 
the left arrowhead (<) to move backward, the right arrowhead with line 
(>|) to move to the last record, and the left arrowhead with line (<|) to 
move to the first record.
✓
✓Go to a new record: Click the right arrowhead with asterisk (>*) button 
to go to a new record.
✓
✓Search for data: Type a search word in the Search box and Access will 
find the first record that contains your search word. For example, type 
“Prince” in the search box and Access will dutifully move to the first 
record that contains the word Prince.

 Chapter 8: A Form for All Reasons
Saving, clearing, and deleting
Saving is very confusing to those from the Word and Excel world entering the 
Access world. In most other programs, you enter something new in a docu-
ment and click Save to save your work. Access is different. The second you 
move to a new record or close a form, your good friend Access saves the 
record for you. So, it’s very hard to lose data in Access! Clearing field data 
and deleting records is not quite so automatic, but that’s a good thing.
If you’re the overly cautious type, you can save a record before moving off of 
it or closing the form by clicking the Save button in the Records group of the 
Home Ribbon (see Figure 8‑10).
To clear the contents of a field, follow these steps:
1.	While in Form view, tab to the field that contains the unwanted data.
The contents of the field are selected.
2.	Tap the Delete key on your keyboard.
The contents of the field are deleted.

Here’s how to delete an entire record:
1.	While in Form view, navigate to the poor record that will meet its 
demise.
2.	Click the Record Selector button located on the left edge of the form 
(see Figure 8-10).
3.	Click Delete Record in the Records group on the Home tab of the 
Ribbon.
Access asks you if you want to delete the record and related records if 
appropriate.
4.	Click Yes in the confirmation dialog box to delete the record.
Adios record!
Deleted records can’t be undone. Confirm you’re on the correct record 
before you delete, and back up your database file often should you need to 
restore a deleted record!

I
 
t would be nice if all computer software spoke the same language, but 
unfortunately this is not the case. Software applications have proprietary 
languages called file formats. Just as a person who speaks only English can’t 
easily communicate with one who speaks only Spanish, software of one file 
format cannot directly communicate with software of another file format.
If you’re a typical business user, you’ll come across a situation in which you 
need some data in your Access database, but it happens to be in another file 
format. Or you’ll get the question, “Can you put that data in a spreadsheet for 
me so I can play around with it?”
Do you get ready for tedious hours of data reentry? Not with Access! Access 
provides tools that speak the languages of other software applications. This 
chapter looks at these import and export capabilities of Access. If you work 
with Access and almost any other program, you need this chapter — because 
sometime soon, you will need to move data to and from Access.
If you’d like to try the import and export techniques described in this chap‑
ter, download the sample files used in the chapter at www.dummies.com/
go/access2016. There you’ll find the Access database used for the screen‑
shots in the book and a sample spreadsheet to import.
If you’re using databases of your own as guinea pigs, make copies of your 
databases before trying the techniques in this chapter.

158
Part III: Data Management Mania 
Retrieving Data from Other Sources
Access includes two ways of grabbing data from other applications:
✓
✓Importing: This capability translates the data from a foreign format into 
the Access database file format — and then adds the translated data to 
an Access table. You can import in one of two ways:
•	Create a new table in an Access database for the data. You might 
do this if you’re creating a new database and some of your data is 
already in spreadsheets.
•	Append the data as new records at the end of an existing table. 
Perhaps you need to import monthly expense data into your 
expense reporting database from your credit card company and 
that data can be provided only in spreadsheet format.
✓
✓Linking: Build a temporary bridge between the external data and 
Access. The data remains at its original source — yet Access can manip‑
ulate it just as though it were residing in the source (usually an Access 
database). When a link is established, it remains until the link is deleted 
or the source file is moved or deleted.
When you link tables between two Access databases, you can’t edit the 
source table’s structure in the destination database (the database that con‑
tains the links). You must open the source database to edit the structure of a 
table linked to a destination database.
Translating file formats
Regardless of whether you import or link the data, Access understands only 
certain data formats.
Always back up your data before importing, exporting, or mowing the 
lawn — er, trying anything that could do serious damage to the data. The 
“I should have backed up” lesson is one of the most painful to learn — and 
one of the most common. Make a copy of your database before trying the 
­techniques in this chapter.
Tables 9‑1 (spreadsheets), 9-2 (other file types), and 9-3 (databases) list the 
file formats that Access can understand. These tables cover the vast majority 
of data formats used on PCs all over the world.
Here is some additional information on how to prepare the most common 
import file formats so that your import will go smoothly. I don’t mention 
prepping other database file formats because, typically, no preparation is 
needed. I’ll get to the step-by-step instructions on importing (see “Importing 
and linking”) and exporting (see “Hit the Road, Data”) later in this chapter.

 Chapter 9: Importing and Exporting Data
Spreadsheets
When you import a spreadsheet file, each spreadsheet column becomes an 
Access table field:
✓
✓The first row in the spreadsheet (the column headings) becomes the 
field names.
If you want to use the first row for field names, you must check the First 
Row Contains Column Headings check box during the import process.
An ideal spreadsheet for import will have field names in Row 1.
✓
✓Each following row becomes a record in the Access table.
An ideal spreadsheet for import will have data starting in Row 2.

When you import data from spreadsheets, watch for these quirks:
✓
✓Double-check spreadsheet data to be sure that it’s consistent 
and complete.
✓
✓Make sure that all entries in each spreadsheet column (field) are the 
same data type (numbers, text, or whatever).
✓
✓Make sure that the first ten rows of the spreadsheet contain data so 
Access can correctly recognize data types.
✓
✓Remove titles and blank rows from the top of the spreadsheet.
✓
✓Make your spreadsheet column headings short and unique.
Shorten your spreadsheet column headings to the field names you’d like 
Access to use so you don’t get scolded during import about field name 
issues.
✓
✓If you’re adding data to an existing Access table, make sure the 
spreadsheet columns are of the same number and in the same order 
as the Access table fields.
Your spreadsheet columns and table fields must line up exactly.

 Chapter 9: Importing and Exporting Data
Text files
If you have difficulty importing a format (such as an Excel spreadsheet) into 
Access, you may be able to import the data as text. Text is the most widely 
recognized form of data known to man (or computer). Try these steps to 
import the data as text:
1.	Open the file with the existing software product (like Excel).
2.	Use the existing product’s exporting tools or Save As command to 
export your data into a text file.
A delimited text file is preferred if the existing product supports this 
type of text file. A delimited file contains a marker character (such as a 
comma) to separate each field from the next so Access can easily under‑
stand where one field ends and another begins.
3.	Import the text file into Access (as shown later in this chapter).
Importing and linking
Because Access offers two ways to get existing data in — linking and 
­importing — a logical question comes up: Which method should you use? 
The method depends on the situation:
✓
✓Link: If the data in the other program must remain in that program, link 
to the source.
If the data is in a SQL Server database that’s a permanent business fix‑
ture, it’s not going anywhere; link to the source.
✓
✓Import: If you want the database in which you’re placing the data to 
replace the source, then import. This is the option for you if you’re cre‑
ating an Access database to replace an old spreadsheet that no longer 
meets your needs. Also import if the source data is supplied by an 
outside vendor in a format other than an Access format. For example, 
suppose you receive cash-register sales data from an outside vendor on 
a monthly basis in spreadsheet format. Access is a great tool for report‑
ing, so you can import the data into Access and use its reporting tools to 
generate your reports.
The following section shows how to link and import data from the file for‑
mats discussed in the previous sections of this chapter.
Steps for importing
Here are the steps for importing or linking data sources to your 
Access database:
1.	Open the Access database that will hold the imported data.
2.	Click the External Data tab on the Ribbon.

162
Part III: Data Management Mania 
The Import & Link group of buttons appears on the Ribbon (see 
Figure 9‑1).
Each button is connected to a wizard that walks you through 
the process:
•	Common file formats such as Excel or Text (labeled as Text File) 
have their own specific buttons.
•	You can find the less common file formats using the More button.
3.	Click the button that matches your file format.
A Get External Data dialog box specific to the selected file format 
appears onscreen. (See Figure 9‑2.)

If typing filenames is not your thing, click the Browse button to 
locate the file.
5.	Select the method of data storage.
This is where you tell Access whether to import or link the data. You can 
link to all file formats except XML.
The sidebar “Storing data from external data sources” shows the 
common data storage options.
6.	Follow the remaining steps in the Get External Data dialog box.
From this point forward, the steps depend on which data format you’re 
importing. Follow the prompts carefully. The worst that can happen is 
that you get an imported (or linked) table full of gibberish. If you do, 
check the format of the source file. For example, if the source is a text 
file and you get gibberish, you may need to confirm that the text file was 
saved as a delimited file (with a character — a comma, for example — 
placed between fields). It’s also possible that the source file isn’t in the 
correct format (for example, you may think it’s an Excel spreadsheet but 
it’s not).
If you expect to import or link to this type of file often, click the Save 
Import Steps check box. (The check box will be located on the last 
screen of the wizard.) After you check the box, you’ll be prompted for a 
name for your import, as shown in Figure 9‑3.
Figure 9-3:

Part III: Data Management Mania 
The External Data tab’s Import group on the Ribbon contains a button called 
Saved Imports. (Refer to Figure 9‑1.) You can use this button to call up saved 
imports and run them as often as you like. (See Figure 9‑4.) Data sources 
must remain in their original locations with their original names to rerun a 
saved import.
Troubleshooting
During the import or linking process, Access may have difficulties. If it does, 
you’ll know — either the import or linking process will take a noticeably long 
time to finish or Access will display an error message. This section describes 
some common problems that crop up during importing and linking — and 
how to fix these problems.
Slow imports and links
If importing is taking forever, Access is probably struggling with errors in the 
inbound data. Follow these steps to troubleshoot the problem:
Storing data from external data sources
When you select a method of data storage, most 
of the Get External Data dialog boxes ask you to 
select from the following storage methods:
Import the source data into a new table in the 
current database. This means creating a new 
table from the imported data.
Access warns you that this choice could 
overwrite an existing table with the same name 
as the imported data’s filename. For example, if 
you have a Volunteers table in your database 
and an Excel spreadsheet with Volunteer 
data (the first tab name is Volunteers in the 
spreadsheet), then Access will prompt you to 
overwrite (replace) the existing table. So, be 
careful when importing!
Append a copy of the records to the table. This 
choice adds the imported data to the end of 
existing records in an existing table.
When you append, make sure that the import 
file and the existing table have
✓
✓The same number of columns
✓
✓The same order of columns
✓
✓The same data types
✓
✓The same field names
Link to the data source by creating a linked 
table. Access creates a table that manages 
the data in the external file. Depending on the 
source, the link may be either of the following:
✓
✓Two-way link. Edits in either file (the inter-
nal Access file or the external file) auto-
matically appear in both files.
	
A link to another Access data source is an 
example of a two-way link.
✓
✓One-way link. You can change the data in 
the external source but not in Access.
	
A spreadsheet link is a one-way link. You can 
change the data in the spreadsheet but not in 
the Access table linked to the spreadsheet.

 Chapter 9: Importing and Exporting Data
1.	Press Ctrl+Break to stop the import process.
If your device does not have a Break key, consult its documentation for 
the proper key sequence to implement the Break command. For exam‑
ple, on some laptops it’s the FN + F6 key, so to stop the import process, 
you’d press Ctrl+Fn+F6.
2.	Open the source file in its native application and check the data that’s 
being imported for problems, such as
•	Corrupt data. The file you’re attempting to import may be unusable.
•	Badly organized spreadsheet data. See the Spreadsheets section 
of Translating File Formats earlier in this chapter for tips on a 
properly organized spreadsheet.
•	An invalid index. Sometimes database indexes become corrupt, 
making the data within the table with the corrupt index unus‑
able. Access will usually holler at you when you open the source 
table that contains the invalid index. For more on indexes, see 
Chapter 5.
•	Too much data. In this case, break the file into several smaller files.
3.	Make any necessary changes and then save the corrected source file.
4.	Start the import or linking process again, as outlined in the previous 
section of the chapter.

Part III: Data Management Mania 
Bad data
If the imported table barely resembles the source, delete the imported table 
from Access, open the source file in its native program, and clean up the data 
before importing again.
Follow the tips in the earlier section, “Translating file formats,” to clean up 
your data.
Hit the Road, Data
Every Access object can be exported; the most common export tasks are 
exporting data in a table or query to another program (such as a spread‑
sheet) and exporting a report as a Portable Document Format (commonly 
known as a PDF). Therefore, this section concentrates on exporting table and 
query data to other file formats and exporting reports.
Exporting a table or query involves reorganizing the data it contains into a 
different format. As with importing, Access can translate the data into a vari‑
ety of file formats, depending on your needs.
Because every Access object can be exported, the External Data tab on 
the Ribbon presents you with all the file formats in which the object can 
be exported. If you can’t export it to a certain format, that format’s button 
is disabled.
Export formats
Access exports to the same formats that it imports (as listed earlier in the 
chapter). Access also exports to PDF (Adobe Acrobat files), XPS (XML Paper 
Specification), Microsoft Word, and to an email attachment.
Exporting table or query data
The steps to exporting a table or query are simple:
1.	With the database open, click the table or query that you want to 
export. All database objects are located in the Navigation pane.
The table or query name is highlighted.

167

 Chapter 9: Importing and Exporting Data
2.	Click the External Data tab on the Ribbon.
The Export button group appears on the Ribbon. (See Figure 9‑5.) Note 
the following features of the Export button group:
•	The common exporting tasks have their own buttons.
•	The seldom-used formats are lumped together; you can get at them 
with the More button.
3.	Click the button that matches the program to which you’ll export 
your data.
An Export dialog box (see Figure 9‑6) customized to your format of 
choice appears.

168
Part III: Data Management Mania 
4.	Follow the steps in the Export dialog box to complete the export.
The Export dialog box displays the choices for your export file’s format:
•	Every choice asks for a filename (including path) for your exported 
data.
•	Some export processes also ask whether you want to open your 
new file after the export is complete.
	This latter feature can prevent a frustrating search after you save 
the file.
5.	Select the Save Export Steps check box if you know you’ll do this 
export again.
The check box is located on the last screen of the Export Wizard. After 
you check the box, you’ll be prompted for a name for your export.
The Ribbon contains a button called Saved Exports. (Refer to Figure 9‑5.) 
Use this button if you want to make the frequent export of a table 
or query easier. Figure 9‑7 shows a table exported from Access as it 
appears in Excel. When you run a saved export more than once, Access 
tells you that the destination file already exists

Exporting a Report to PDF
Follow these steps to export a report to PDF:
1.	With the database open, click the report that you want to export. All 
database objects are located in the Navigation pane.
The report name is highlighted.
2.	Click the External Data tab on the Ribbon.
The Export button group appears on the Ribbon.
3.	Click the PDF or XPS button in the Export group.
The Publish as PDF or XPS dialog box appears (see Figure 9‑8).
4.	Browse to the folder you’d like to store the file in and type a file name 
in the File name box.
5.	Click Publish.
The report is saved as a PDF to the folder and with the file name you 
specified.

orrecting an incorrect entry in an Access table is pretty easy: A few 
clicks, some typing, and voilà — the problem is gone. But what if you 
need to correct 26,281 records? Manually editing so many records would 
involve a whole bunch of clicking and typing and clicking and typing. (Editing 
an entire table by hand doesn’t sound like an opportunity for a triumphant 
“Voilà!”)
Fortunately, Access offers some handy, large-scale housekeeping and editing 
tools you can use to make big changes to your database — all without wear-
ing out your keyboard, mouse, or fingertips.
Please Read This First!
If you’re following my not-terribly-subtle suggestion to not skip this section, 
you’re well on your way to successful database maintenance. Why? Because 
the fact that you’re reading this tells me you’re a careful person who follows 
advice and instructions. These traits are the key to managing thousands of 
records, keeping them accurate and up-to-date, and making the types of cor-
rections I talk about in this chapter.
Why do I sound so serious, all of the sudden? Well, when you’re making large-
scale changes to a database, things can go wrong and mistakes can be made. 
If you’re going to do anything major to your database — especially if you’re 
editing and/or deleting a whole lot of records — you want a backup there 
behind you; if you do make a mistake and wipe out the wrong records, or edit 
something that should have been left alone, you can easily go back to the 
original version of the database and start over.

172
Part III: Data Management Mania 
It’s a wise Access user who makes a backup of his or her database table or 
tables before starting any task that involves a margin for error. Here’s how 
you back up the table you want to edit:
1.	Open the database file that contains the table you want to edit.
The list of tables in the database appears on the left side of the window.
2.	Right-click the table name in the list on the left.
3.	Choose Copy from the pop-up menu that appears (see Figure 10-1).
Access places a copy of the table on the Windows Clipboard.
4.	Right-click anywhere below the list of tables, reports, and so on in the 
left-side panel (as shown in Figure 10-2).
A pop-up menu appears.
5.	Choose Paste from the pop-up menu.
The Paste Table As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10‑3. It offers 
choices for how to paste your copied table data, but you don’t really 
need to worry about them at this point.
6.	Type a name for the new table into the dialog box’s Table Name field.
Access suggests “Copy of _____,” where the blank is the current table 
name (which might be a good choice).
Figure 10-1:  
Copy that 
table for 
safekeeping.

173

 Chapter 10: Automatic Data Editing
7.	Click OK.
Don’t worry about the options in the dialog box. The default setting 
(Structure and Data) works just fine.
The dialog box closes, and you now have a copy of the original table.
With your table copy there to support you, you now have a backup — 
­something to go back to should any of the steps in the rest of this chapter 
go awry when you apply them to your data.
Backup at the ready, it’s time to move on and start editing your database — 
automatically.

Creating Consistent Corrections
Automated editing queries have a lot of power. But before you haul out the 
really big guns, here’s a technique for small-scale editing. The technique may 
seem simplistic, but don’t be fooled; it’s really very handy.
You can practice small-scale editing by using the Replace command 
as follows:
1.	Open a table in Datasheet view.
2.	Click in the field you want to edit — it doesn’t matter which row 
you’re in; just be in any record, in the field you want to edit.
3.	On the Home tab, click the Find button in the Find section.
The Find and Replace dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10‑4.
4.	In the Find What box, type the value you want to change. In the 
Replace With box, type a new value.
With this information in place, you’re ready to start making changes. 
Note that the Look In setting defaults to Current Field, which is why you 
clicked as instructed in Step 2.
5.	(Optional) Click the Look In drop-down list to choose a different field 
in which to search.
The Find and Replace dialog box assumes you want to search and make 
changes to the active table (or form, report, or query, whatever’s the 
open and active part of your database). As mentioned previously, it 
defaults to searching the current field, but you can click the Look In 
drop list and choose Current Document instead, which means to search 
all fields in the active table, form, report, or query.
6.	Click one of the buttons on the right side of the dialog box to apply 
the changes to your table.
Figure 10-4:  
The Find 
and Replace 
dialog box.

175

 Chapter 10: Automatic Data Editing
•	To find the next record to change, click Find Next. The 
cursor jumps to the next record in the table that contains the 
text you entered in the Find What box. No changes get made at 
this point — Access only finds a matching candidate. To make a 
change, click the Replace button, explained next.
•	To apply your change to the current record, click Replace. This 
makes the change and moves the cursor to the next matching 
record in the database. Click Replace again to continue the pro-
cess. To skip a record without changing it, click Find Next.
•	To make the change everywhere in the current field, click 
the Replace All button. Access won’t ask about each individual 
change. The program assumes that it has your permission to cor-
rect everything it finds. Don’t choose this option unless you are 
absolutely certain that you want the change made everywhere.
The moment you click either the Replace or Replace All button, Access 
permanently changes the data in your table. Access lets you undo only 
the last change you made, so if you clicked Replace All and updated 
12,528 records, Access lets you undo only the very last record that you 
changed — the other 12,527 records stay in their new form. This, dear 
reader, is why we started out making a backup!
7.	When you finish, click Cancel or the X button in the top right corner 
of the dialog box.
The Find and Replace dialog box closes.
One of the most common reasons to use Find and Replace is to correct a 
misspelling. We all hate it when we make such a mistake, but we hate it less 
when the solution is as simple as making Access go look for the error and 
replace it with the correction, utilizing the very powerful Find tools we’ve 
been discussing in this section. So . . . if you misspell a word, any word, 
throughout your data and need to change all its occurrences to the proper 
spelling, follow these steps:
1.	Open the Find and Replace dialog box.
2.	On the Find tab in the dialog box, type the incorrect spelling in the 
Find What box.
3.	Type the proper spelling in the Replace With box.
4.	Click the Replace All button.
Your computer goes off and does your bidding, changing each 
instance of the word in the Find What box to the word in the Replace 
With box.

176
Part III: Data Management Mania 
Access gives you a lot of control over the process. In addition to the options 
of the Find command (discussed in Chapter 12), Replace offers addi-
tional options:
✓
✓Match Whole Field: Selected by default, Whole Field (in the Match drop-
down list) makes Access look only for cases in which the information in 
the Find What box completely matches an entry in the table. That is, if 
the data in your table includes any additional characters in the field — 
even a single letter — Match Whole Field tells Access to skip it.
✓
✓Match Any Part of Field: If you select Any Part of Field from the Match 
drop-down list, Access performs the replace action whenever it finds 
the text in any portion of the matching text in the field. For example, this 
setting picks the area code out of a phone number. Unfortunately, it also 
replaces those same three numbers if they appear anywhere else in the 
phone number, too.
✓
✓Match Start of Field: If you choose Start of Field from the Match drop-
down list, Access replaces the matching text only if it appears at the 
beginning of the field. This option could replace only the area code in a 
series of phone numbers without touching the rest of the numbers.
If your editing goes awry, remember that the wonderful Undo option corrects 
only the very last record that Access changed. Just click the Undo button on 
the Quick Access Toolbar or press Ctrl+Z.
Using Queries to Automate  
the Editing Process
Queries, especially those created through the Query Wizard, are exception-
ally easy to create (as you discover in Chapter 13). In this chapter, you create 
a very simple and specific query not created elsewhere in the book — a 
query designed specifically to look for duplicate records.
But what about correcting those 26,281 records? If Find and Replace doesn’t 
solve the problem, you’re looking at some serious querying (a topic covered 
in Chapters 12 through 17), and you may find that creating a single query that 
fixes all the problems is impossible.
Therefore, be prepared to use a combination of things: Create a query that 
seeks out certain issues, do some editing of individual records, and use 
Find and Replace procedures to locate consistent errors and replace them 
with something you can spot easily, like every place someone doing data 
entry placed an “X” to indicate they didn’t know what to enter or didn’t 
have the data to enter for a given field. This is kind of a twist on using Find 

177

 Chapter 10: Automatic Data Editing
and Replace to fix spelling errors (covered previously in this chapter), 
but instead of fixing an error, you’re using Replace to flag certain records 
for editing.
Generally, however, Find and Replace will do what you need because a uni-
versal misspelling, a bunch of zip codes entered accidentally into the wrong 
numeric field — or any repeated error of that sort — can be fixed pretty 
quickly by searching for the erroneous content and replacing it with what 
should be there instead. With a backup copy of your table preserved for safe-
keeping (you did read the “Please Read This First!” section, didn’t you?), feel 
free to experiment with Find and Replace and even some queries that you 
make on your own.
Looking for duplicate records
Let’s get back to that duplicate records query. What, exactly, is a duplicate 
record? You will have duplicated data in your database — people who 
live in the same city, for example, will have the same city in their records 
in the City field. Products that have the same price, or that come in the 
same colors, will have the same data in some or nearly all of their fields. 
What I mean here by a duplicate record is an entire record that is an exact 
­duplicate — every field is the same in one record as it is in another record 
(or in several others, as the case may be).
How do duplicate records get made? It can happen quite easily:
✓
✓It happens a lot when more than one person is doing data entry; two or 
more people might have the same list or stack of cards or other source 
of data that’s being keyed into your Access table.
✓
✓If you’re relying on an Excel worksheet as the source of the table data, 
or if some other electronic source is providing the records, accidental 
duplication is still a common risk; it’s just as easy to paste the same 
rows of data into the table twice as it is to enter the same records twice 
manually. Maybe easier.
Duplicate records waste time and money. If you think that it’s no big deal to 
have the same person entered into your database three times, or that the 
record for your Green Widget with the Deluxe Carrying Case is in the data-
base twice, consider the extra postage you would spend mailing a catalog 
more than once to the people who appear in the database multiple times, 
or the confusion when only one instance of a product is updated to reflect 
a price increase. Which record is correct after they’re no longer identical? 
So it’s a good idea not only to be vigilant about avoiding duplicates from 
the beginning, but also to ferret them out and get rid of them whenever 
they’re found.

178
Part III: Data Management Mania 
Running the Find Duplicates Query Wizard
The Find Duplicates Query Wizard can help you spot that common curse of 
the database: duplicate records. Duplicates waste time and money, especially 
when the database is used for mailings or some similar business activities. 
This wizard can help your database clean up its act.
To run the Find Duplicates Query Wizard, follow these simple steps:
1.	Click the Ribbon’s Create tab.
The Create tab’s sections — Templates, Tables, Queries, Forms, Reports, 
and Macros & Code — appear.
2.	Click the Query Wizard button, found in the Queries section.
The New Query dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10‑5.
3.	Choose the Find Duplicates Query Wizard from the list of available 
wizards.
A description of the wizard’s function appears on the left side of the 
dialog box.
4.	Click OK.
The original Query Wizard dialog box closes and is replaced by the Find 
Duplicates Query Wizard dialog box, shown in Figure 10‑6.
5.	Choose the table in which you want to search for duplicates.
•	Notice that in the View area, you can choose to see Tables, 
Queries, or Both, so if this isn’t your first query or if another user 
has created one for you, you can certainly search an existing que-
ry’s results for duplicates, too.
•	If this is your first query, and your data is only in tables that you or 
someone else made, simply leave Tables selected in the View area.
Figure 10-5:  
The Query 
Wizard is

 Chapter 10: Automatic Data Editing
You’ll also see your backup copy of the table in this list, so be sure you 
pick the right table and don’t start operating on your backup!
6.	Click Next.
In the Available Fields list (see Figure 10‑7), double-click those fields 
you’re worried could have duplicate entries in them. Skip fields that 
are supposed to have duplicates anyway or where duplicates, however 
unlikely, are no problem — such as cities, states, zip codes, or last 
names. You can also skip your primary key field, because by its very 
nature (as a field containing unique data for each record), it won’t have 
any duplicate values.
7.	When the Duplicate-Value Fields list is populated with those fields that 
you want the query to look in, click Next.
The next step in the wizard appears, as shown in Figure 10‑8.

180
Part III: Data Management Mania 
8.	From the Available Fields list, double-click those fields you want 
to include in the query’s results in addition to those with duplicate 
values.
Such fields typically include those that help you identify records that 
are harboring duplicate data, such as First Name if you’re looking for 
records that might have identical Last Names, or Product Numbers if 
you’re looking for products that have the same description or price. In 
this example, I am looking for duplicate records in a customer table, 
which will prevent mailings going out to anyone more than once (or at 
an old and a new address for the same person).
9.	Click Next.
The last step in the Find Duplicates Query Wizard appears, as shown in 
Figure 10‑9. Here’s where you decide on a name for your new query.

10.	If you don’t like the default name Access gave your query, just enter a 
new name into the text field.
Preferably, the name should be short but should identify the query’s 
purpose — Duplicate Names Query is a good name for this example. 
The default query name that Access offers will be “Find duplicates 
for _______,” where the blank is the name of the table searched-for 
duplicates.
11.	Click Finish.
The results of your query appear onscreen, as shown in Figure 10‑10.
Now that you know which records have duplicate data within them, you can
✓
✓Edit them individually. Just click within the records shown as dupli-
cates and make changes to names, addresses, or whatever else might be 
incorrect, if an error is the cause of the duplication.

records

182
Part III: Data Management Mania 
✓
✓Use Find and Replace. Use on the query results to make more targeted 
changes, such as taking all records with a particular word in a particular 
field and either
•	Change that word to something else
	
or
•	Append a character or digit to that entry to make it different from 
the others.
✓
✓Delete the unwanted records. To do so, simply click the leftmost cell in 
the row for the unwanted record (the entire record/row will be selected) 
and then press the Delete key. Of course, be careful not to delete both 
records — you only want to delete the unwanted duplicate!
You’ll be asked to confirm your deletion, and you can choose Yes if you do 
want to get rid of the extra record.

A
 
ccess can be a great resource for Internet and intranet information. If 
the data you’re working with really needs global exposure — or if you 
simply want to reach your data from anywhere you might be — Access 2016 
(and the entire Office suite, for that matter) is ready to help. In fact, a connec-
tion to all things web-related has been a priority for Microsoft as each new 
version of Office has been released over the years, and Office 365 takes that 
to a whole new level with the suite’s new connection to the cloud.
In this chapter, I explain the Office connection to the cloud and discuss the 
overall capabilities of Access with regard to the web. Then you’ll find out 
how to build and use a web app, and finally, how to use hyperlinks within 
your Access desktop application. The hyperlink section of this chapter 
applies to the desktop version of Access 2016.
How Access Works with the Web
It’s almost a requirement these days that software be web-ready, or at least 
web-friendly. Even word processors — which should never be used to create 
a web page — contain “Save for Web” commands, and graphics software can 
help you create web-ready images.
Of course, Access is a natural fit for the web because data is something we’ve 
all come to expect to find online. Access makes it easy to both export your 
data to the web, using External Database Tools, and to build a quick web app 
(shorthand for “application”) using some handy web app templates or simply 
uploading your existing desktop database tables.

To make Access do its Internet tricks, you should have or be able to obtain
✓
✓A version of your browser that’s no more than a year old (so it will be 
compatible with the current version of Office)
✓
✓A connection to the Internet (or to your company’s intranet)

✓A SharePoint account (for sharing your data with other SharePoint 
users) OR a subscription to Office 365 for Business

Office 365 is not the same thing as Office 2016. Office 2016 is just the com-
bined suite of applications — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Access 
for the desktop computer. Office 365 is a subscription-based set of tools that 
enables companies to collaborate and share their data online. Most Office 
365 subscriptions come with all the desktop office applications but not the 
other way around.
Microsoft offers a variety of monthly fee-based plans for businesses of all 
shapes and sizes, providing a variety of options. As of this writing, the prices 
for Office for Business range from $5 to $12.50 a month. You can investigate 
these plans by searching the web for “compare office 365 plans” and choos-
ing the right plan for you.
Now, this is not to say that you have to use Office 365, because you absolutely 
do not. You can use Office 2016’s applications without setting foot on the cloud, 
and install the applications locally. You don’t need to put your Office data (doc-
uments, worksheets, presentations, and so on) in the cloud if you don’t want 
to. You can store your data locally, just as you always have. In fact, everything 
done in this book was done with a locally installed copy of Access 2016.
Whether you’re planning to use it or not, you’re probably asking, “What is the 
cloud?” The term the cloud simply describes services that are hosted outside 
of your organization, using the web. You may already be using the cloud, 
because lots of services you use all the time are part of the cloud — things 
like web-based email, mobile banking, and online data storage services. 
Because this data is located online, you can access it from just about any-
where, using any PC, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone.
When it comes to Office 365, the cloud also provides online versions of your 
software, meaning that you can work with most of the Office applications 
online, instead of from locally installed copies. This is where the fee-based 
subscription plans come into play — along with sharing options for online 
collaboration with coworkers and clients anywhere in the world. Office 365 
makes it easy to collaborate on and share a Word document or Excel spread-
sheet. Oddly, Access is not one of those applications with a companion 
online version. Access does make use of the web, however, as you’ll soon see.

 Chapter 11: Access and the Web
An Access web app front end (the part you see in the web browser) is cre-
ated in SharePoint and the back end is created in SQL Server — Microsoft’s 
powerful enterprise database engine. An Office 365 for business subscription 
gets you this powerful technology for a nominal fee.
Connect Office 365 to Access 2016
As mentioned earlier, you can host your web app on a local SharePoint site 
or on an Office 365 SharePoint site in the cloud. If you’re using SharePoint 
locally, make sure you have administrative rights and the URL to the 
SharePoint site. I have an Office 365 business subscription so I’ll use 
that to create my web app. To begin, connect Access 2016 to your Office 
365 account.
1.	Click Sign in to get the most out of Office near the right end of the 
screen (see Figure 11-1).
The Sign in dialog box appears.

2.	Type the email address associated with your Office 365 account and 
click Next.
3.	Type the password associated with the account and click Sign in.
You’ll see the name associated with the account at the right end of the 
Ribbon in place of the words Sign In. Now you’re ready to create your 
web app.
Meet the Custom Web App
So what is a web app anyway? Well, web means it’s online, and app is just 
shorthand for “application.” A Custom Web App is an online database appli-
cation accessed from the cloud using a browser. You build and maintain the 
web app in the desktop version of Access but use it in a browser. This makes 
your Access data available to almost any device that has an Internet connec-
tion such as a smartphone or tablet.
You can also upload existing tables to a web app from sources such as Access 
and Excel to name a few. If you’re starting from scratch, Access comes with 
several web app templates that make it easy to build a web app. Table 11-1 
show the available templates with the descriptions provided by Microsoft:
To create a web app, follow these steps:
1.	Click the File tab, and then click the word New in the red left-hand 
panel (see Figure 11-2).

2.	Click the Custom Web App button (it’s rather large, so you can’t 
miss it).
The dialog box in Figure 11‑3 opens, through which you can name 
your app and choose where to store it online. Note that just below 
the Web Location box is a link that says Get Help Finding Your Web 
Location, which takes you to a website (shown in Figure 11‑4) that 
provides options for you to use if you choose to continue developing 
your web app.
3.	Enter a name for the app in the App Name text box.
4.	Select or enter the URL for the site that will host the web app.
Office 365 sites are listed in the Available Locations list box. If you’re 
using a local SharePoint site, type its URL in the SharePoint or Office 
365 site URL.
5.	Click the circled right arrowhead to the right of the dialog box (see 
Figure 11-5) to browse templates.
6.	Once you’ve found your template, click Create.
Access builds a web app based on the template you selected and the 
Add Tables tab appears. You’re now ready to add other tables to your 
web app beyond the one created with your template selection.

Adding new tables to your web app
Access provides a handy list of table designs for you to choose from if you’re 
starting your web app from scratch.
Here’s how to add a table:
1.	Click Table from the Create group on the Home tab of the Ribbon if 
necessary (you’ll be here by default after creating a new web app).
2.	Type a keyword in the search box that represents the type of data to 
go into your table.
For example, type contacts for contact-related tables or order for cus-
tomer- and order-related tables.
3.	Click search (the magnifying glass icon).
Access displays a list of related tables (see Figure 11‑6).
4.	Select a table.
Access creates the table. The table name appears down the left side of 
the screen.

Part III: Data Management Mania 
Access web apps do not support the OLE Object, and Attachment data types 
that that Access desktop databases support. For more on data types, see 
Chapter 3.
Uploading an existing table  
to your web app
Access gives you the ability to upload a data table from an existing source 
such as an Access desktop database, an Excel spreadsheet, or text file. 
Follow these steps to upload an existing Access table. Steps for other file for-
mats are similar.
1.	Click Table from the Create group on the Home tab of the Ribbon if 
necessary.
2.	Click Access from the Create a table from an existing data source list 
(Figure 11-7).
The Get External Data dialog box appears, ready to serve.
3.	Click Browse, navigate to the file location, and then click on the file 
that contains your table.
4.	Click Open.
The path and file name are entered in the File name text box in the Get 
External Data dialog box.

5.	Click OK.
The Import Objects dialog box appears.
6.	Select the table name and click OK.
The table and its data are imported into the web app.
7.	Click Close.
The imported table appears down the left side of the web app screen.
Web app tables are maintained just like Access desktop database tables.  
Just open the Navigation Pane (F11), right-click the table, and choose Design 
View. If you read Chapters 4 and 5 (and I know you did!), you already know all 
about editing and designing Access tables.
Web app forms
When you create a web app table, Access is such a great pal that it also 
creates two views for you. While a bit confusing, it’s not quite the same as 
the views you are familiar with in desktop Access such as Design view and 
Datasheet view.  A view, in this context, is a way for you to see and edit data 
in a table similar to a form in the desktop version of Access. In fact, Access 
classifies these views as forms in the Navigation Pane (see Figure 11‑8). 
Unlike tables, though, views do not look like desktop Access forms. They’re 
actually web pages.
Figure 11-7:  
Select the 
source of 
the existing 
table.

192
Part III: Data Management Mania 
The first view Access creates is called List view. It displays table data one 
record at a time. The second view is called Datasheet view. Sound familiar? 
It’s just like desktop Access’s Datasheet view. It displays table data in a 
spreadsheet-like format.
Unlike desktop Access, in a web app, you can’t see data in Datasheet or List 
view from the Navigation pane. To see data in the view, you must open it in a 
web browser (see the next section, “Launching your Web App in a Browser”).
Customizing web apps is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this book. 
If you’re interested in learning more, search the Internet for “Create and cus-
tomize a web app in Microsoft Access.” You’ll find several great articles on 
how to get the job done!
Launching your web app
When you’ve created your tables and Access has created the corresponding 
views (remember your pal Access does that for you!), it’s time to take a look 
at the web app in a browser. When you launch your app, you’ll see the tables 
you created or uploaded listed down the left side of the screen (Figure 11‑9). 
When you click a table name, the data from that table opens in List view 
ready for data entry. Records are listed down the left side of the view. When 
Figure 11-8:  
The Events 
table and 
correspond-
ing forms 
(views).

193

 Chapter 11: Access and the Web
you click on a record, you’ll see the data from that record on the right side of 
the view. You can change to Datasheet view by clicking (oddly enough) the 
Datasheet link at the top left of the form.
Each form has a series of command buttons across its top called an Action 
Bar. By default, the Action Bar has buttons for common record management 
actions. Figure 11‑10 shows you the Action Bar buttons with an explanation 
of what each does.
Data entry in the browser is very similar to data entry in desktop Access.  
The two major differences are you must click a button to edit a record and 
another to save it. Don’t worry though: If you forget to click Save and then try 
to move to another record, Access prompts you to save. Access and you, per-
fect together! Here’s how to launch your web app:
1.	Click the Home tab on the Ribbon if necessary.
2.	Click the Launch App icon (Figure 11-11) in the View group of the 
Ribbon.
Your browser opens showing your web app.
Figure 11-9:  
The Events 
table in List 
view.

194
Part III: Data Management Mania 
To launch a web app from any browser on any device, you’ll need its URL 
(web address). Open the web app in desktop Access (File  ➪  Open on the 
Ribbon). Click the File tab on the Ribbon and then Info. You’ll see the URL 
at the top of the Info tab. If you click on the URL, you’ll see a shortcut menu 
choice to copy it to the Clipboard. You can email the URL to yourself and 
launch the web app from that email on your mobile device. Make sure to 
bookmark it after opening!
Adding a record
Once you’ve launched your web app, List and Datasheet views give you two 
different ways to add a new record. List view is best if your table contains 
many fields and you don’t like scrolling. Datasheet view, as you can probably


 Chapter 11: Access and the Web
guess, is best if your table contains a small number of fields (generally, less 
than fifteen) and you do like scrolling! Once you’ve launched your app, follow 
these steps in either view to add a new record:
1.	Click the name of the table to which you’d like to add data.
The table opens in List view displaying the first record in the table. Click 
Datasheet if you want to add your records in a datasheet. Remember, 
tables are listed down the left side of the screen and have star symbols 
next to them.
2.	Click the Add icon (+) on the Action Bar to move to a new record.
The form moves to a new record and the cursor is placed in the 
first field.
3.	Add data for the new record to the appropriate fields on the form.
4.	Click the Save icon (disk) on the Action Bar.
The record is saved. You must click the Save icon in a web app to 
save data, unlike desktop Access where records are saved automati-
cally when you change records or close a form. Don’t panic though, if 
you forget to click Save and change records or views in your web app, 
Access will prompt you.
Editing a record
Once you’ve launched your web app, List and Datasheet views give you two 
different ways to edit data. List view has a filter feature, making it easy to 
find a record. Datasheet view assumes you’ll scroll through the data or use 
your browser’s Find command (Ctrl+F in most browsers) to locate the record 
in question. List view requires the click of an icon to switch to edit mode. 
Datasheet view is already in edit mode.
Here’s how to edit a record in List view. The steps for Datasheet view 
are similar.
1.	Click the table name that contains the record you’d like to edit.
The table opens in List view. Remember, tables are listed down the left 
side of the screen and have star symbols next to them.
2.	Click in the filter box and type a word from any field on the record 
you’d like to edit.
3.	Tap the Enter key on your keyboard.
The form filters to the record or records with your keyword 
(Figure 11‑12). If the keyword matches multiple records, you’ll see the 
data from the first field for each record listed down the left side of the 
form. Click that data to switch to the desired record.

196
Part III: Data Management Mania 
4.	Click the Edit icon (pencil) on the Action Bar.
The form switches to edit mode. Datasheet view doesn’t have an Edit 
icon. Just click in the field you’d like to edit and type away!
5.	Edit the record as necessary.
6.	Click the Save icon (disk) on the Action Bar to save your changes.
Deleting a record
Once you’ve launched your web app, steps for deleting a record are identical 
regardless of view.
1.	Click the table name that contains the record you’d like to delete.
The table opens in List view.Tables are listed down the left side of the 
screen and have star symbols next to them.
2.	Locate the record you’d like to delete.
3.	Click the Delete icon (trash can) on the Action Bar.
You’re asked to confirm the deletion.
4.	Click Yes in the delete confirmation message box.
You can’t undo a record after you delete it! Proceed with caution!
Linking to a web app from an 
Access desktop database
It is possible to connect to web app tables located in the cloud or your 
locally hosted SharePoint site from your desktop database. This means your 
Figure 11-12:  
Filtering to 
the word 
“fund.”

197

 Chapter 11: Access and the Web
data is in one place (cloud or local SharePoint site) and you’ll use two differ-
ent applications to access it – the web app and the desktop database. This 
is an advanced topic beyond the scope of this book. However, this is a very 
important piece of information to know before planning and building your 
database. If you’re like me, you’ll want your data in one place (in the cloud) 
and the ability to connect to it from multiple sources — your desktop data-
base and your web app via a browser.
This means you can have people in the office in the desktop version of your 
database and out of the office using your web app editing the same data. 
All you need is an Internet connection (easy) and a well-designed database 
and web app (not quite as easy, but you can do it!). If you want to know how 
to do this, search the Internet for “How to make external connections to an 
Access web app.”
Click! Using Hyperlinks in Your 
Desktop Access Database
If you don’t need your data to sit in the cloud via a web app, you can connect 
your desktop database to the outside world. The term hyperlink is probably 
quite familiar — it’s the text or pictures that serve as jumping-off points to 
other data. Click a hyperlink, and you go to another web page. Click an image 
that’s set up as a hyperlink (your mouse pointer turns to a pointing finger), 
and you go to a larger version of the image — or to another website where 
information pertaining to the subject of the image can be found. Underlined 
text (or text in a different color or that changes color when you point to it) is 
the typical sign of the existence of a hyperlink.
So what’s this hyperlink stuff? Although hyperlink makes it sound like a link 
that’s had way too much coffee, within the context of Microsoft Office (of 
which Access is a part), it’s actually a special storage compartment for stor-
ing the address of a resource on either the Internet or your local corporate 
network (or a file stored on your local computer). Hyperlinks start with a spe-
cial identification code that explains to the computer what kind of resource 
it’s pointing to and where that resource is.
Table 11‑2 lists the most common protocol codes (a harmless but scary-
sounding term that simply refers to portions of the programming code that 
allow a browser to use a hyperlink). You’ll find, along with the code itself, an 
explanation of the kind of resource the code refers to.

198
Part III: Data Management Mania 
For more information on links and how Access understands and uses them, 
press F1 or click the handy Help icon (the question mark in the upper right 
corner of the Access screen) to open the Access Help system and then 
search for the term hyperlink.
If you surf the web regularly, many of these terms and concepts should be 
familiar. Although most of them are geared to Internet or intranet applica-
tions, Access can also use hyperlinks to identify locally stored documents 
(that’s what file:// does). This enables you, for example, to create a 
hyperlink in your Access table that opens a Word document, an Excel spread-
sheet, or a JPEG image file. This technology is so flexible that the sky’s liter-
ally the limit.
Adding a Hyperlink field to your 
desktop database table
Access provides a handy field type specifically designed for this special type 
of data. As you probably guessed, this type is called the Hyperlink field.
Adding a Hyperlink field to a table doesn’t require special steps. Just use 
the same steps for adding any field to a table — get to Design view for your 
table and use the Data Type column to choose the Hyperlink data type, as 
shown in Figure 11‑13.
The Hyperlink data type is no different from the other field types in terms 
of applying it. When you hop back to Datasheet view, you’ll see that your 
entries (if any) in the Hyperlink field are underlined, looking just like link 
text on a web page.

•	The ScreenTip (the little text that pops up when your mouse 
pointer hovers over a web address). To create one, click the 
ScreenTip button and use the resulting Set Hyperlink ScreenTip

 Chapter 11: Access and the Web
Although most hyperlinks store web or other Internet addresses, they can 
point to just about anything in the cyberworld. Thanks to their flexible 
tags, hyperlinks understand web pages, intranet servers, database objects 
(reports, forms, and such), and even documents on your computer or 
another networked PC.
Testing links
Hyperlinks in your table work just like the ones you find on the web — just 
point and click. You can double-check for yourself by doing the following:
1.	Make sure you’re connected to your network and the Internet.
Although Internet Explorer (or whichever browser you’re using) will 
open whenever a hyperlink that points to a website is clicked, if you’re 
not online at the time, it won’t go where the hyperlink points.
2.	Open the Access desktop database you want to use.
3.	Open the table containing hyperlinks.
The fun is about to begin!
4.	Click the hyperlink of your choice.
•	If the hyperlink leads to a web page, Internet Explorer (or whatever 
browser you’ve set as your default) leaps onto the screen, display-
ing the website from the link.
•	If the link leads to something other than a website, Windows auto-
matically fires up the right program to handle whatever the link 
has to offer.

ou probably already know what databases do. They help you store, 
organize, view, and document the information that’s important to 
you — your personal information, your business-related information, any 
kind of information you need to keep track of.
Of course, this is not a new concept. People have been storing information 
for as long as there’ve been people. From making scratches in the dirt to 
keep count of the number of sheep in the flock to handwritten census infor-
mation kept in huge ledgers to metal filing cabinets filled with typed lists and 
reports, man has been using some form of database for a long, long time.
Over the years — make that decades, even centuries — the process of stor-
ing information has gotten easier, even if it’s more technologically compli-
cated than writing things down and putting the paper you wrote it on in a box 
or drawer.
Thanks to the advent of database software and the Internet, you can store 
millions of records in a single computer, and people all over the world can 
access them, assuming they have permission. Farmers can keep track of 
their sheep, countries can keep track of their populations, and you can keep 
track of your friends, family, employees, products, and holiday card lists — 
­anything your little data-driven heart desires.

206
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
But what is all this “keeping track” of which I speak? It’s not just storing the 
data; it’s getting at it when you need it. Thanks to the magic of the Find, Sort, 
and Filter commands, Access tracks and reorganizes the stuff in your tables 
faster than ever, putting it literally at your fingertips whenever you need to 
locate one or more of the pieces of information you’re storing. When you 
need a quick answer to a simple question, these three commands are ready 
to help. This chapter covers the commands in order, starting with the speedy 
Find, moving along to the organizational Sort, and ending with the flex-
ible Filter.
Find, Sort, and Filter do a great job with small questions (such as “How 
many customers from France didn’t give us a phone number?”). Answering 
big, complex questions (such as “How many people attended Major League 
Baseball games in July and also bought a team hat?”) still takes a full-fledged 
Access query (in this case, querying a database of baseball-game attendees 
and the database of items sold in the team store). Don’t let that complexity 
worry you, though, because you can flip back to Chapter 10, which explains 
queries in exciting detail.
Using the Find Command
When you want to track down a particular record right now, creating a query 
for the job is overkill. Fortunately, Access has a very simple way to find one 
specific piece of data in your project’s tables and forms: the Find command.
Find is found — big surprise here — in the Find section of the Home tab, 
accompanied by a binoculars icon. You can also get to Find by pressing 
Ctrl+F to open the Find dialog box.
Although the Find command is pretty easy to use, knowing a few tricks makes 
it even more powerful, and if you’re a Word or Excel user, you’ll find the 
tricks helpful in those applications, too — because the Find command is an 
Office-wide feature. After you get through the Find basics (covered in the 
next section), check the tips for fine-tuning the Find command in the “Shifting 
Find into high gear” section, later in this chapter.
Finding anything fast
Using the Find command is a very straightforward task. Here’s how it works:
1.	Open the table or form you want to search.
Note that the Find command works in Datasheet view and with Access 
forms and becomes available as soon as a table or form is opened.
If you want to dive into forms right now, flip back to Chapter 8.

207

 Chapter 12: Finding, Filtering, and Sorting Your Data — Fast
2.	Click in the field that you want to search.
The Find command searches the current field in all the records of the 
table, so be sure to click the correct field before starting the Find pro-
cess. Access doesn’t care which record you click; as long as you’re on a 
record in the correct field, Access knows exactly which field you want 
to Find in.
3.	Start the Find command.
You can either click the Find button in the Find section of the Home tab 
or press Ctrl+F.
The Find and Replace dialog box opens, ready to serve you.
4.	Type the text you’re looking for in the Find What box, as shown in 
Figure 12-1.
Take a moment to check your spelling before starting the search. Access 
is pretty smart, but it isn’t bright enough to figure out that you actually 
meant plumber when you typed plumer.
5.	Click Find Next to run your search.
•	If the data you seek is in the active field, the Find command imme-
diately tracks down the record you want.
The cell containing the data you seek is highlighted.
What if the first record that Access finds isn’t the one you’re look-
ing for? Suppose you want the second, third, or the fourteenth 
John Smith in the table? No problem; that’s why the Find and 
Replace dialog box has a Find Next button. Keep clicking Find Next 
until Access either works its way down to the record you want or 
tells you that it’s giving up the search.
•	If Find doesn’t locate anything, it laments its failure in a small 
dialog box, accompanied by this sad statement:
Microsoft Access finished searching the records. The search item 
was not found.

Part IV: The Power of Questions 
If Find didn’t find what you were looking for, you have a couple of options:
✓
✓You can give up by clicking OK in the small dialog box to make 
it go away.
✓
✓You can check the search and try again (you’ll still have to click OK 
to get rid of the prompt dialog box). Here are things to check for after 
you’re back in the Find and Replace dialog box:
•	Make sure that you clicked in the correct field and spelled every-
thing correctly in the Find What box.
You can also check the special Find options covered in the follow-
ing section to see whether one of them is messing up your search.
•	If you ended up changing the spelling or options, click Find Next 
again.
Shifting Find into high gear
Sometimes just typing the data you need in the Find What box doesn’t pro-
duce the results you need:
✓
✓You find too many records (and end up clicking the Find Next button 
endlessly to get to the one record you want).
✓
✓The records that match aren’t the ones you want.
The best way to reduce the number of wrong matches is to add more details 
to your search, which will reduce the number of matches and maybe give you 
just that one record you need to find.
Access offers several tools for fine-tuning a Find. To use them, open the Find 
and Replace dialog box by either
✓
✓Clicking the Find button on the Home tab
or
✓
✓Pressing Ctrl+F
The following sections describe how to use the options in the Find and 
Replace dialog box.
If your Find command isn’t working the way you think it should, check the 
following options. Odds are that at least one of these options is set to exclude 
what you’re looking for.

209

 Chapter 12: Finding, Filtering, and Sorting Your Data — Fast
Look In
By default, Access looks for matches only in the current field — whichever 
field you clicked in before starting the Find command. To tell Access to 
search the entire table instead, choose Current Document from the Look In 
drop-down list, as shown in Figure 12‑2.
Match
Your options are as follows:
✓
✓Any Part of Field: Allows a match anywhere in a field (finding Richard, 
Ulrich, and Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous). This is the default.
✓
✓Whole Field: This requires that the search terms (what you type in 
the Find What box) be the entirety of the field value. So Rich won’t find 
Ulrich, Richlieu, Richard, or Richmond. It finds only Rich.
✓
✓Start of Field: Recognizes only those matches that start from the begin-
ning of the field. So Rich finds Richmond, but not Ulrich.
This option allows you to put in just part of a name, too, especially if you 
know only the beginning of a name or the start of an address.
To change the Match setting, click the down arrow next to the Match field 
(see Figure 12‑3) and then make your choice from the drop-down menu 
that appears.

the entire

Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Search
If you’re finding too many matches, try limiting your search to one particular 
portion of the table with the help of the Search option. Search tells the Find 
command to look either
✓
✓At all the records in the table (the default setting)
or
✓
✓Up or down from the current record
Clicking a record halfway through the table and then telling Access to search 
Down from there confines your search to the bottom part of the table.
Fine-tune your Search settings by clicking the down arrow next to the Search 
box and choosing the appropriate offering from the drop-down menu.
Match Case
Checking the Match Case check box makes sure that the term you search for 
is exactly the same as the value stored in the database, including the same 
uppercase and lowercase characters.
This works really well if you’re searching for a name, rather than just a word, 
so that rich custard topping is not found when you search for (capital R) Rich 
in the entire table.
Search Fields as Formatted
This option instructs Access to look at the formatted version of the field 
rather than the actual data you typed. By “formatted” we mean with format-
ting applied to the content – numbers formatted as percentages, dates set as 
short dates vs medium dates, and so on.
Limiting the search in this way is handy when you’re searching for dates, 
stock-keeping unit IDs, or any other field with quite a bit of specialized 
formatting.
Turn on Search Fields as Formatted by clicking the check box next to it.
This setting doesn’t work with Match Case, so if Match Case is checked, 
Search Fields as Formatted appears dimmed. In that case, uncheck Match 
Case to bring back the Search Fields as Formatted check box.
Most of the time, this option doesn’t make much difference. In fact, the only 
time you probably care about this particular Find option is when (or if) you 
search many highly formatted fields.

 Chapter 12: Finding, Filtering, and Sorting Your Data — Fast
Sorting from A to Z or Z to A
Very few databases are organized into nice, convenient alphabetical lists. 
You don’t enter your records alphabetically; you enter them in the order they 
come to you. So what do you do when you need a list of products in product-
number order or a list of addresses in zip code order right now?
Sorting by a single field
The solution lies in the sort commands, which are incredibly easy to use. The 
sort commands are on the Ribbon’s Home tab, in the Sort & Filter section. 
The two buttons (Ascending and Descending) do the job quite well:
✓
✓Sort Ascending sorts your records from top to bottom:
•	Records that begin with A are at the beginning, and records that 
begin with Z are at the end.
•	If your field contains numeric data (whether they’re true numbers 
or Short Text fields storing zip codes or Currency fields storing 
prices), an Ascending sort puts them in order from lowest number 
to highest.
✓
✓Sort Descending sorts your records from bottom to top:
•	Records that begin with Z are at the top, and records that begin 
with A are at the bottom of the list.
•	If your field contains numeric data, a Descending sort puts the 
records in order from highest number to lowest.
If, after sorting in Ascending or Descending order you want to put things 
back the way they were – in the order just prior to clicking either of those 
buttons – click the Remove Sort button, located just below the Ascending and 
Descending buttons in the Sort & Filter group.
Sorting on more than one field
What if you want to sort by multiple fields – such as by zip code, and then 
within that sort, you want all the people with the same zip code to appear 
in Last Name order? Or maybe you want to sort all your customers by a 
Status field and then within each group of customers that creates, to sort 
by current balance? You’d need to use the following steps to nest one sort 
inside another.

212
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
You can sort by more than one column at a time like this:
1.	Click the heading of the first column to sort by.
The entire column is highlighted.
2.	Hold down the Shift key and click the heading of the last column to 
sort by.
All columns from the first one to the last one are highlighted.
3.	Choose either Sort Ascending or Sort Descending.
The sort is always performed from left to right.
In other words, you can’t sort by the contents of the fourth column and 
within that by the contents of the third column.
Sorting has its own peculiarity when working with numbers in a text field. 
When sorting a field that has numbers mixed in with spaces and letters (such 
as street addresses), Access ranks the numbers as though they were letters, 
not numbers. This behavior means that Access puts (say) “1065 W. Orange 
Street” before “129 Mulberry Street.” (Thanks to the peculiar way that your 
computer sorts information, the 0 in the second position of 1065 comes 
before the 2 in the second position of 129.)
Fast and Furious Filtering
Sometimes you need to see a group of records that shares a common value in 
one field. Perhaps they all list a particular city, a certain job title, or they’re 
all products that have the same cost. Always willing to help, Access includes 
a special tool for this very purpose: the Filter command.
Filter uses your criteria and displays all matching records, creating a mini-
table of only the records that meet your requirements. It’s like an instant 
query without all the work and planning. Of course, it’s not as flexible or 
powerful as a query, but it’s all you need when you’re looking for a fairly 
simple answer.
The Filter tool appears in the Sort & Filter section of the Ribbon’s Home tab, 
and you have the following choices for a simple filter:
✓
✓Filter
✓
✓Selection
✓
✓Advanced Filter by Form
✓
✓Advanced Filter/Sort
✓
✓Toggle Filter

213

 Chapter 12: Finding, Filtering, and Sorting Your Data — Fast
Each type of filter performs the same basic function, but in a slightly differ-
ent way. The following sections cover the first three options. The Advanced 
Filter/Sort option, found by clicking the Advanced button, opens a window 
that actually has you building a query — selecting tables and fields to filter, 
setting up criteria for the filter to use while it’s finding specific records, that 
sort of thing. You can read about queries and familiarize yourself with the 
Advanced Filter/Sort tool in Chapter 13.
Filters work in tables, forms, and queries. Although you can apply a filter to 
a report, filtering reports can be a daunting task, one that I’m not going to 
get involved with here. Of course, what you read here can be applied to that 
process, should you want to try it on your own. And in the following sections, 
what you learn to apply to a table can also be applied when you’re working 
with queries and forms.
Filtering by a field’s content
The main Filter command enables you to filter your records so you view only 
records that meet specific criteria. Suppose, for example, that you want to 
see all records for people living in a particular city. Here’s how to do it:
1.	In your table of interest, click the small triangle on the field name for 
the field you want to filter (City in this case).
Access displays a pop-up menu like the one in Figure 12‑4.
Figure 12-4:  
Filtering a 
single field 
based on 
that field’s 
entries.

214
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Don’t right-click the header at the top of the column (where it says City 
in the figure). Right-clicking there displays a different pop-up menu filled 
with wonderful things you can do to that column of your table.
2.	If you want to omit some entries from your filter, remove their check 
marks in the pop-up menu.
You can either
•	Remove check marks from individual entries.
or
•	Remove the Select All check mark to uncheck all the items.
Uncheck everything so you can easily check only those entries whose 
matching records you want to see. With all the entries checked, you see 
all the records.
3.	Place check marks next to those entries you want to use in construct-
ing your filter for the field.
Access searches the selected field and displays only those records that 
meet your Filter criteria.
4.	Click OK.
All the records meeting the criteria set (by virtue of the items you 
checked) are displayed. This might be several records, a whole lot of 
records, or just one.
To jump back and see all the original (unfiltered) records, you can either
✓
✓Click the Toggle Filter button in the Sort & Filter section of the Ribbon to 
remove the last filter applied.
or
✓
✓Click the field name’s tiny triangle again and choose Clear Filter From 
Field Name.
If you don’t remember which fields you filtered, you can tell them by the 
small funnel symbol that appears next to the field name in Datasheet view.
The entire table, full of records, returns to view.
Filter by selection
The Selection command is the easiest of the Sort & Filter commands to use. It 
assumes that you’ve found one record that matches your criteria. Using the 
Selection filter is a lot like grabbing someone in a crowd and shouting: “Okay, 
everybody who’s like this guy here, line up over there.”

215

 Chapter 12: Finding, Filtering, and Sorting Your Data — Fast
For example, imagine you want to find all the volunteers who live in 
Landisville. You can use the Selection filter in this manner:
1.	Click the field that has the information you want to match.
In this case, it’s the City field.
2.	Scroll through the list until you find the field entry that will serve as 
an appropriate example for your filter.
3.	Click to select the value you’re searching for, right-click the cell 
containing the selection, and then choose Equals Whatever. (In this 
instance, it would be Equals Landisville, as shown in Figure 12-5.) 
You can also select the cell and then click the Selection button on 
the Home tab (in the Sort & Filter section) to access the same list of 
choices.
Access immediately displays a table containing only the records match-
ing your selection. (Again, check out Figure 12‑5, where my City filter has 
been applied.)
4.	Click the Toggle Filter button on the toolbar after you finish using 
the filter.
Your table or form returns to its regular display.

Part IV: The Power of Questions 
At this stage of the game, you may want to save a list of everything that 
matches your filter. Unfortunately, the Filter’s simplicity and ease of use now 
come back to haunt you. To permanently record your filtered search, you 
have to create a query. (See Chapter 13 for details about creating queries.)
You can also use the Filter menu that shows sorting options and the list of 
checked field values in the “Filtering by a field’s content” section earlier 
in this chapter. When you display the pop-up menu, unclick Select All and 
then check the value you want to look for. Then choose Text Filters from 
that same pop-up menu. The same list of options (Equals, Does Not Equal, 
Begins With, and so on) appears as a fly-out menu, and you can make your 
choice there.
Filter by Form
You can tighten a search by using additional filters to weed out undesir-
able matches, but that takes a ton of extra effort. For an easier way to iso-
late a group of records according to the values in more than one field, try 
Filter by Form.
Filter by Form uses more than one criterion to sift through records. In some 
ways, it’s like a simple query. (What’s a query? See Chapter 13.) It’s so simi-
lar to a query that you can even save your Filter by Form criteria as a full-
fledged query!
Suppose, for example, that you need a list of all the employees at your com-
pany who work in a certain department and have a particular title. You can 
perform two Selection filters (on the Department and Job Title fields, using 
the employee database as an example) and write down the results of each to 
get your list, or you can do just one search with Filter by Form and see all the 
records that meet your criteria (based on their entries in multiple tables) in a 
single step.
To use Filter by Form, follow these steps:
1.	On the Ribbon’s Home tab, click the Advanced button in the Sort & 
Filter section.
A menu appears.
2.	Choose Filter by Form from the menu.
The table is replaced by a single row of cells, one under each field 
header in your table, as shown in Figure 12‑6.

217

 Chapter 12: Finding, Filtering, and Sorting Your Data — Fast
3.	Click in the empty cell beneath field name for the first column that 
you want to filter.
Use the scroll bars to bring the column onscreen if it’s off to the right 
and can’t be seen.
The down arrow jumps to the column you click.
•	Normally, Access shows a down-arrow button next to the first field 
in the table.
•	If you previously used a Filter command with the table, Access 
puts the down-arrow button in the last field you filtered. (Again, 
refer to Figure 12‑6.)
4.	Click the down arrow to see a list of values that the field contains, as 
shown in Figure 12-7.
5.	In the list of values, click the value that you want to use in this filter.
For instance, if you select Landisville from the drop-down list in the 
City field, “Landisville” moves into the City column. Access adds the 
quotes automatically — one less detail that you have to remember!

a grid and 
drop-down 
lists to set 
criteria for 
each field.

Part IV: The Power of Questions 
6.	To add another filter option for the chosen field, click the Or tab in 
the lower left corner of the table.
A new Filter by Form window appears, letting you add an alternate 
search condition. Access also offers an Or tab to the lower left corner of 
the display, as shown in Figure 12‑8.
The Filter by Form command likes to answer simple questions, such 
as “Show me all the volunteers who live in Lancaster.” It also provides 
answers to more complex questions like “Show me all the records con-
taining Th in the AvailableDays field and who have Landisville in the 
City field,” and it performs both tasks easily.
Asking a more complex question (such as “Show me all the volunteers 
in Lancaster who like fundraising”) requires a query. To find out about 
­queries, flip ahead to Chapter 12.
7.	For each additional field you want to filter, click the Or tab and repeat 
Steps 3 through 6.
In this example, the second field to be filtered is VolunteerInfo, and 
Fundraising was typed into the field’s box.
8.	When you finish entering all the criteria for the filter, click the Toggle 
Filter button.
Figure 12‑9 shows the results.
A final thought about Filter by Form: Although you can get fancy by adding Or 
searches to your heart’s content, keeping track of your creation gets tough in 
no time at all. Before you go too far, remind yourself that queries work better 
than filters when the questions get complex. Flip to Chapter 13 for the low-
down on queries.

When you finish fiddling with your filter, click the Toggle Filter button. At 
that point, your table returns to normal (or at least as normal as data tables 
ever get).
Unfiltering in a form
What do you do when you enter criteria by mistake? Or when you decide that 
you really don’t want to include Lancaster in your filter right after you click 
Lancaster? No problem — the Clear Grid command comes to the rescue!
When you click the Clear Grid command (found in the Sort & Filter section’s 
Advanced menu), Access clears all the entries in the Filter by Form grid and 
gives you a nice, clean place to start over again.
Filter by excluding selection
The Selection filter can also be used to exclude certain records. This works 
great for times when you want to briefly hide a bunch of records that all 
share a unique attribute (a particular state, city or zip code). In the following 
sample, I searched for the volunteers who are either Active or Inactive, by 
choosing Does not equal “Prospective”).

Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Here’s how to make the Selection filter exclude records for you:
1.	Scroll through the table until you find the value you want to exclude.
2.	Right-click the field containing the value and then choose Does Not 
Equal ______ (where the blank represents the value you’ve right-
clicked) from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 12-10.
Those records matching the value you’ve chosen get out of the way so 
you can concentrate on the records that really interest you.
You can also click the Selection button (in the Sort & Filter section of the 
Home tab) and choose Does Not Equal from the menu there. You’ll also 
notice the Contains and Does Not Contain commands. These are handy for 
culling records that have something in common, such as a particular word 
or number within them. You can also combine filters, excluding not only (for 
example) volunteers who are Prospective, but the Prospective volunteers 
who live in a certain City or State.

ou know the old saying, “The only stupid question is the one you 
didn’t ask.” It’s supposed to mean that if you have a question, ask it — 
because if you don’t, you’ll be operating in the dark, and that’s far sillier than 
your question could ever have been. Although you don’t ask “meaning of life” 
questions of a database, you do pose questions such as, “How many custom‑
ers in London do we have?” or “What’s the phone number of that guy who 
works for Acme Explosives?” Either of those questions, if you didn’t ask it, 
would require you to scroll through rows and rows of data to find the infor‑
mation. (That’s the silly approach, obviously.)
This chapter introduces you to the art of asking questions about the infor‑
mation in your database using queries. You discover how to use the Query 
Wizard to pose simple questions, and then you find out about creating your 
own simple‐yet‐customized queries by using the bizarrely and inaccurately 
named Advanced Filter/Sort tool. After that, you discover how to combine 
multiple tables (from the same database) in your query — which can yield 
interesting answers to the questions you have about your data. Suffice it to 
say that by the end of this chapter, you’ll be a veritable quizmaster, capable 
of finding any record or group of records you need.
Don’t worry if your first few queries produce odd or unexpected results — 
including no results at all. As with anything new, queries (along with their 
inherent procedures and concepts) take a little getting used to. Because 
they’re so powerful, they can be a little complicated, but it’s worth taking 
the time to figure things out (with the help of this book!). Take your time, be 
patient with yourself, and remember that old saying: “The only stupid ques‑
tion is the one you didn’t ask.”

222
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Simple (Yet Potent) Filter and Sort Tools
Wait a minute. We were just talking about queries, and the heading above 
says something about filter and sort. What happened to querying? Well, sort‑
ing and filtering are queries unto themselves — using them, you can more 
easily find a record — say, for a particular person if your list is in alphabeti‑
cal order by the LastName field. Filtering, on the other hand, says “Give me 
all the records that have this in common” (this being the criterion you set 
your filter to look for). It’s kind of like playing Go Fish with your database.
It’s all related, and it’s all about asking questions. There are really two ways 
to find a particular record:
Fast filing with Access
Back before computers, people filed information 
in file folders and stored them in file cabinets.
✓
✓The file folders had useful information on 
their tabs — such as letters of the alphabet, 
dates, or names — indicating what kind of 
information could be found inside. 
✓
✓The file‐cabinet drawers had information on 
them, too — little cards with names, num‑
bers, or letters on them, indicating which 
folders were stored inside the drawers. 
The figures on the file drawers and file folders 
helped people find information:
✓
✓Need an order from April 10, 2015? Go to the 
Order cabinet, open the 2015 drawer, and 
pull out the folder for April’s orders. After a 
little leafing through, voilà! You’ve got the 
order from April 10.
✓
✓Need to know how much a particular cus‑
tomer spent in the last quarter of 2014? 
Go to the 2014 cabinet, open the drawer 
of customer orders, pull the folder for the 
customer you’re interested in, and begin 
tallying the orders for that year, for that 
customer.
In a sans‐computer environment, you’d also 
need a calculator, abacus, or scrap paper 
and a pencil to do this. Sound tempting? 
Didn’t think so.
Querying in Access is similar to the process 
of opening a file drawer, looking at folder 
tabs to figure out which folder is needed, and 
then leafing through the pages in the folder, at 
least in terms of the progression of steps. The 
process just happens a lot faster, and you don’t 
get any paper cuts!
✓
✓The data stored in an Access table can 
be found by using a query that goes to a 
particular table, looks in particular fields, 
and pulls out certain records, based on the 
criterion set for the query, such as “Show 
me all the customers with Lancaster in the 
City field.”
✓
✓You can even perform calculations with 
queries (such as tallying the orders for a 
particular customer). Chapter  16 shows 
you how. 

223

 Chapter 13: I Was Just Asking . . . for Answers
✓
✓Queries use a set of criteria — conditions that eliminate many, if not all 
but one, of your records — that you present to the database and that 
says, “Look here, here, and here, and find THIS for me!”
✓
✓Filters use one criterion, saying (in effect), “Sift through all these records 
and find the one(s) with THIS!”
Of course, the exclamation point is optional (depending on your level of 
excitement about the data involved) — and so is the method you use. You 
can query or filter for any record or group of records you want. And you can 
sort the results of your filter. But it’s still all about asking questions.
Filter things first
I begin by explaining filters because they’re more straightforward, procedur‑
ally, than queries. By starting with filters, too, you can get your feet wet with 
them while preparing for the deeper waters of querying.
How filters work
Filters quickly scan a single table for whatever data you seek. Filters exam‑
ine all records in the table and then hide those that do not match the crite‑
ria you seek.
The filtering options are virtually unlimited, but simple:
✓
✓Want every volunteer in Lancaster? Filter the City field for Lancaster.
✓
✓Want to see all the fundraising events that occurred in the first quarter 
of 2015? Filter for EventDate (between 1/1/2015 and 3/31/2015) and the 
EventType field for Fundraising, and there you go.
✓
✓Want all the Locations that have Wi‐Fi, but that are also Outdoor 
locations? Filter for Yes on the Wi‐Fi field and Outdoor in the 
LocationType field.
There’s a price to pay for ease and simplicity, however. Filters are neither 
smart nor flexible: 
✓
✓You cannot filter multiple tables without first writing a query that 
contains — brings together — the tables.
✓
✓A filter cannot be the basis for the records seen on a report or form.
✓
✓If you want to filter on two fields using the OR operator, you’ll need a 
query, not a filter — when using multiple fields with a filter, the criteria 
must work with AND as the operator. 
Chapter 12 covers filters in their limited‐but‐useful glory.

224
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
What about queries?
Queries go far beyond filters. But to get to that great “beyond,” queries 
require more complexity. After all, a bicycle may be easy to ride, but a bike 
won’t go as fast as a motorcycle. And so it goes with queries. Queries work 
with one or more tables, let you search one or more fields, and even offer the 
option to save your results for further analysis, but you can’t just hop on and 
ride a query with no lessons.
For all the differences between filters and queries, the most advanced filter 
is, in reality, a simple query — which makes some bizarre sense: Your first 
step into the world of queries is also your last step out of the domain of fil‑
ters. Welcome to Advanced Filter/Sort, the super‐filter of Access, masquerad‑
ing as a mild‐mannered query.
Advanced Filter/Sort
Advanced Filter/Sort is more powerful than a run‐of‐the‐mill filter. It’s so 
powerful that it’s like a simple query:
✓
✓You use the same steps to build an Advanced Filter/Sort as you do to 
create a query.
✓
✓The results look quite a bit alike, too.
Advanced Filter/Sort looks, acts, and behaves like a query, but it’s still a filter 
at heart and is constrained by a filter’s limits, including these:
✓
✓Advanced Filter/Sort works with only one table or form in your database 
at a time, so you can’t use it on a bunch of linked tables.
✓
✓You can ask only simple questions with the filter.
Real, honest‐to‐goodness queries do a lot more than that.
✓
✓The filter always displays all the columns for every matching record.
With a query, you choose the columns that you want to appear in the 
results. If you don’t want a particular column, leave it out of the query. 
Filters aren’t bright enough to do that.
Even with these limitations, Advanced Filter/Sort makes a great training 
ground to practice your query‐building skills (that’s why I’m starting with 
this feature, despite the word “Advanced” in its name).
Although this section talks about applying filters only to tables, you can also 
filter a query. There’s a good reason to filter queries: Some queries take a 
long time to run, so it’s faster to filter the query results than to rewrite and 
rerun the query. Suppose (for example) that you run a complicated sales‐
report query and notice it includes data from every state instead of the 

225

 Chapter 13: I Was Just Asking . . . for Answers
­individual state you wanted. Rather than modify the query and run it again, 
you can apply a filter to your query’s results. Poof! You get the results you’re 
after in a fraction of the time.
Fact‐finding with fun, fast filtering
Before you use the Filter window, you need to take a quick look at its compo‑
nents and what they do. In the section that follows this one, you find out how 
to access and use the Filter window.
The Filter window is split into two distinct sections, as shown in Figure 13‑1:
✓
✓Field list (the Volunteers box in Figure 13‐1): The Field list displays all 
the fields in the current table or form (the table or form that’s open at the 
time). Not sure about forms? Check out Chapter 7!
At this point, don’t worry about the upper half of the window. The 
Field list comes more into play when you start working with full que‑
ries. The table you were working on is already shown in the upper half 
of the window, so you don’t have to do anything with this part of the 
window now.
✓
✓Query grid (the lower half of the screen): When you use the Advanced 
Filter/Sort command, you are presented with a blank query grid for the 
details of your filter.
You’re building a filter, but Access calls the area at the bottom of the 
screen a query grid because you use the same grid for queries. (You also 
see it later in the chapter, in the section about building real queries.)
To build the filter, you simply fill in the spaces of the query grid at the 
bottom of the window you see in Figure 13‑1. Access even helps you along the 
way with pull‐down menus and rows that do specific tasks. The procedure 
for filling in these spaces appears in the next section, along with details about 
each part of the grid and how it all works.
Here’s the “advanced” part
The Advanced Filter/Sort tool also works on forms. If you feel particularly 
adventuresome (or if you mainly work with your data through some ready‐
made forms), try the filter with your form. Filtering a form works like filtering 
a table, so you can follow the same steps.
The following sections show how to design and use filters.

226
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Starting the process
Start your filter adventure by firing up Access’s basic query tool, the 
Advanced Filter/Sort.
1.	Decide what question you need to ask and which fields the question 
involves.
Because it’s your data, only you know what information you need and 
which fields would help you get it. You may want (for example) a list 
of volunteers who live in a particular state, donors who’ve donated 
in excess of a certain amount to your organization, cities in a particu‑
lar state, books by your favorite author, or people whose birthdays 
fall in the next month (if you’re painfully organized, in which case I 
commend you).
Whatever you want, decide on your question first and then get ready to 
find the fields in your table or form that contain the answer.
Don’t worry if your question includes more than one field or multiple 
options. Both filters and queries can handle multiple‐field and multiple‐
option questions.
2.	Open the table (or form) that you want to interrogate.
Assuming you have the correct database open, your table or form pops 
into view.
Figure 13-1:  
Query 
Design View 
window 
allows you 
to choose 
the field(s) 
on which to 
filter your 
data in the 
current 
table.

227

 Chapter 13: I Was Just Asking . . . for Answers
3.	Click the Ribbon’s Home tab at the top of the Access workspace.
4.	In the Sort & Filter section of the Ribbon’s Home tab (see Figure 13‐2), 
choose Advanced ➪ Advanced Filter/Sort.
The Filter window appears, ready to accept your command. What you 
see depends on the following considerations:
•	If you previously used a filter of any kind with this table, Access 
puts that most recently used filter information into the new 
window.
•	If no filter was done previously — or you cleared the previous 
filter — the Filter/Sort window looks pretty blank — for now.
The Filter window is nothing but a simplified query window. The filter 
looks, acts, and behaves a lot like a real query. More information about 
full queries comes later in the chapter, so flip ahead to the next section 
if that’s what you need.
After you open the Filter window, you’re ready to select fields and criteria for 
your filter. The following section shows you how.

228
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Selecting fields and criteria
As you begin selecting the fields you want to use in your filter and set up the 
criteria against which your fields’ content will be compared, be sure to follow 
these steps carefully:
1.	Click the first box in the Field row (in the query grid) and then click 
the down arrow that appears to the right of the box.
The drop‐down menu lists all the fields in your table (or form).
2.	Click the field (as identified in the preceding section) that you want to 
query.
Access helpfully puts the field name in the Field box on the query grid. 
So far, so good.
If you want to see the results of your filter in the same order that your 
data always appears in, skip to Step 4.
3.	If you want to sort your filter results by this particular field, follow 
these steps:
a.	Click the Sort box.
b.	Click the down arrow that appears.
c.	Select Ascending or Descending from the drop‐down menu.
Ascending order is lowest to highest (for example, A, B, C . . .). 
Descending order is highest to lowest (for example, Z, Y, X . . .). If 
you don’t want to stop and click the drop arrow to choose a sort 
method, just type an “a” or a “d” and Access fills it in for you, and 
you can move on to the Criteria field to specify what you’re 
looking for.
4.	Set up your criteria for the field.
Follow these steps:
a.	Click the Criteria box under your field.
b.	Type each criterion (such as =value, where “value” refers to a spe-
cific word or number that is represented within your data or < or > 
followed by a value).
Setting criteria is the most complex part of building a query — it’s 
the most important part of the entire process. The criteria are your 
actual questions, formatted in a way that Access understands. 
Table 13‑1 gives you a quick introduction to the different ways you 
can express your criteria.

229

 Chapter 13: I Was Just Asking . . . for Answers
If you’re making comparisons with logical operators, flip to 
Chapter 14 for everything you need to know about Boolean logic, 
the language of Access criteria.
c.	If your question includes more than one possible value for this field, 
click the Or box and type your next criterion in the box to the right of 
the word Or.
If you move on to a new box, the criterion you entered is automatically 
placed in quotes. Don’t worry. This is just Access acknowledging that 
you’ve given it a specific value to look for, to
•	Make an exact match.
•	Use the value with a greater‐than or less‐than symbol for 
comparison.
If your question involves more than one field, repeat the preceding Steps 1–4 
for each field. Just use the next column in the grid for the additional field or 
fields you want to use in your filter.
Table 13-1	
Basic Comparison Operators
Name
Symbol
What It Means
Example
Equals
=
Displays all records that 
exactly match whatever 
you type.
To find all items from 
customer 37, type 37 in the 
Criteria row.
Less  
Than
<
Lists all values that are less 
than your criterion.
Typing <50000 in the 
Salary field finds all 
employees who earn less 
than $50K.
Greater  
Than
>
Lists all values in the field 
that are greater than the 
criterion.
Typing >50000 in the 
Salary field finds all 
employees I’ll be hitting 
up for a loan because they 
earn more than $50K.
Greater 
Than or  
Equal To
>=
Works just like Greater 
Than, except it also 
includes all entries that 
exactly match the criterion.
>=50,000 finds all values 
from 50,000 to infinity.
Less Than 
or Equal To
<=
If you add = to Less Than, 
your query includes all 
records that have values 
below or equal to the 
criterion value.
<=50000 includes not only 
those records with values 
less than 50,000, but also 
those with a value of 50,000.
Not Equal To
<>
Finds all entries that don’t 
match the criterion.
If you want a list of all 
records except those with 
a value of 50,000, enter 
<>50000.

230
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
With all the fields and criteria in place, it’s time to take your filter for a test 
drive. Figure 13‑3 shows an example that uses two criteria: the Volunteers 
table filtered for Active Status volunteers whose start date is before 2011, 
indicating they’re long‐time volunteers whom the organization can count on.
Running the filter
After completing the process of choosing fields and setting criteria, you’re 
ready to run the filter. Click the Toggle Filter button in the Sort & Filter sec‑
tion of the Ribbon.
Access thinks about it for a moment, and then the record or records that 
meet your criteria appear. This is shown in Figure 13‑4. Pretty cool, eh? Note 
the little Filter symbols on the Field Name headers for the two fields by which 
this particular table was filtered — a tiny arrow and a Filter icon — to remind 
you which fields your filter used.
There are two ways to see all the data again:
✓
✓Click the Toggle Filter button, found in the Sort & Filter section of the 
Ribbon’s Home tab.
The filtered records join their unfiltered brethren in a touching moment 
of digital homecoming.
✓
✓Click the Filtered button.

ried in this

This button appears at the bottom of the Access window (next to the 
Record buttons that you use to move through your records one at a 
time, and you can see it in Figure 13‑4). When you click the Filtered 
button, your entire table comes back, and the button changes so its 
label says Unfiltered. Click again? The results of your query return. It’s a 
quick toggle, perhaps even toggle‐ier than the Toggle Filter button!
Select Queries
The basic query tool, created to make your life easier, is the Select query — 
so named because it selects matching records from your database and dis‑
plays the results according to your instructions.
The sidebar “Secrets of the Select query” summarizes the differences that 
make Select queries more powerful than lesser filters. If upon reading these 
secrets you suspect that the Select query sounds like the right tool for the 
job you have in mind, you may be able to use a query rather than a filter.

Voilà! Your

cadabra

232
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
The best process for creating a Select query depends on the following:
✓
✓If you’re new to writing queries, the Query Wizard is a fast, easy way 
to get started. It walks you through the process of selecting tables and 
fields for your query — and can even add some summary calculations 
(such as counting records) to your query.
✓
✓If you’ve already written some queries and are comfortable with the 
Query Design window, you’ll probably want to bypass the Query Wizard 
and build your queries from scratch. Later in this chapter, “Getting Your 
Feet Wet with Ad Hoc Queries” guides you through the process.
Solid relationships are the key to getting 
it all (from your tables)
In life, solid relationships make for a happier person; in Access, solid relation‑
ships make for a happier query experience.
To query your database effectively, you need to know the following about its 
table structure:
Secrets of the Select query
Unlike its simplified little brother, Advanced 
Filter/Sort (shown previously in this chapter), 
a Select query offers all kinds of helpful and 
powerful options, including these:
✓
✓Use more than one table in a query. 
Because a Select query understands the 
relational side of Access, this query can 
pull together data from more than one table. 
✓
✓Show only the fields you want in your 
results. Select queries include the ever‐
popular Show setting, which tells Access 
which fields you really care about seeing.
✓
✓Put the fields into any order you want in the 
results. Organize your answer fields where 
you want them without changing the order 
of the fields in your original table(s).
✓
✓List only as many matching entries as 
you need. If you need only the top 5, 25, or 
100 records, or a percentage, such as 5% 
or 25%, use the Top Value setting. (This 
and other query options are covered in 
Chapter 15.)
✓
✓You can save your query for future use. A 
Select query can be given a name and run 
over and over, whenever you need it. 

233

✓
✓Which tables do you need to use?
✓
✓How are the tables you need to use related to each other?
✓
✓Which fields contain the data you want to know about?
✓
✓Which fields do you need in the solution?
Access maintains relationships between the tables in your database. Usually 
you (or your Information Systems department) create these relationships 
when you first design the database. When you build the tables and orga‑
nize them with special key fields, you actually prepare the tables to work 
with a query.
Key fields relate your Access tables to each other. Queries use key fields to 
match records in one table with their related records in another table. You 
can pull data for the item you seek from the various tables that hold this data 
in your database — provided they’re properly related before you launch 
the query.
Want to refresh your memory on creating relationships between the tables in 
your database? Check out Chapter 4, where all those secrets are revealed.
If you don’t relate your tables via the Relationships window, you’ll have to do 
so for each multiple‐table query you build in Access. As a general rule, put in 
the time to properly design and relate your tables. With proper table design 
and relationships, you’ll get the results you want in a shorter amount of time.
Running the Query Wizard
You can rely on the Query Wizard — and the Simple Query Wizard found 
within it — for a real dose of hands‐free filtering. With the Simple Query 
Wizard, you enter table and field information. The wizard takes care of the 
behind‐the‐scenes work for you.
Access isn’t psychic (that’s scheduled for the next version); it needs some 
input from you!
To create a query with the Query Wizard’s Simple Query Wizard, follow 
these steps:
1.	On a piece of paper, lay out the data you’d like in your query results.
A query returns a datasheet (column headings followed by rows of 
data), so make your layout in that format. All you really need are the 
column headings so you’ll know what data to pull from the database.

234
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
2.	Determine the table location of each piece of data (column heading) 
from your paper.
Write down the table and field name that contain the data matching the 
column heading on the paper above the column heading.
3.	In the Database window, click the Create tab on the Ribbon and then 
click the Query Wizard button from the Queries section.
The New Query Wizard dialog box appears, asking you what kind of Query 
Wizard you’d like to run. Choose Simple Query Wizard and click OK.
4.	Choose the first table you want to include in the query (see 
Figure 13‐5).
You’ll use the Tables/Queries drop‐down menu, which shows all 
the tables (and any existing queries) in your database. Here are the 
specifics:
a.	Click the down arrow next to the Tables/Queries drop‐down menu 
(as shown in Figure 13‐6).
b.	Click the name of the table or query to include in this query.
5.	Select the fields from that table or query for your query.
Repeat these steps to select each field you want included in your query:
a.	Click the name of the table or query to include in this query.
The Available Fields list changes and displays the fields available 
in the table.
b.	In the Available Fields list, double‐click each field from this table or 
query that you want to include in the query you’re creating.

Query

If you add the wrong field, just double‐click it in the Selected Fields list. 
It will go back home. If you just want to start all over, click the double‐
left chevron (that’s what you call the symbol that looks like a less‐than 
sign) and all the selected fields go away.
6.	After you select all the fields, click Next.
If the wizard can determine the relationships between the tables you 
selected, the window in Figure 13‑7 appears.
If you don’t see the window, not to worry. Access just wants you to name 
the query instead. Skip to Step 8.

236
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
If you include fields from two tables that aren’t related, a warning dialog 
box appears. The dialog box reminds you that all the selected tables 
must be related before you can run your query — and suggests that you 
correct the problem before continuing. In fact, it won’t let you go any 
further until you appease it in one of two ways:
•	Remove all the fields selected for your query from the unrelated 
tables.
•	Fix the relationships so that all tables you’ve selected in your 
query are related.
7.	If the wizard asks you to choose between a Detail and a Summary 
query, click the radio button next to your choice and then click Next.
•	Detail creates a datasheet that lists all records that match the 
query. As the name implies, you get all the details from those 
records.
•	Summary tells the wizard that you aren’t interested in seeing 
every single record; you want to see a summary of the information 
instead.
A summary query can perform calculations (such as sums and 
averages) on numeric fields. If text fields are selected, Access can 
count the records or pull the first and last item from the set of 
fields alphabetically.
If you want to make any special adjustments to the summary, click 
Summary Options to display the Summary Options dialog box 
shown in Figure 13‑8. Select your summary options from the check 
boxes for the available functions — Sum, Avg, Min, and Max — and 
then click OK.
If you’re curious about how the wizard decides whether to display 
the Detail or Summary step, the sidebar “To summarize or not to 
summarize” tells the story.
8.	In the wizard page that appears, select a radio button for what you 
want to do next:
•	If you want to make your query snazzy: Select the Modify the Query 
Design option.
The wizard sends your newly created query to the salon for some 
sprucing up, such as the inclusion of sorting and totals.
•	If you want to skip the fancy stuff: Select the Open the Query to View 
Information option to see the Datasheet view. 
The wizard runs the query and presents the results in a typical Access 
datasheet.

9.	Type a title for your query in the text box and then click Finish.
The wizard builds your query and saves it with the title you entered; 
then Access displays the results, as shown in Figure 13‑9.
Congratulations! You’ve given birth to a query.
When you finish the steps in this section, the Query Wizard saves your query 
automatically with the name you typed.
Use the following list to modify or use a query created with the 
Query Wizard:

238
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
To summarize or not to summarize
How does the wizard choose whether it feels 
like summarizing things? Well, computers are 
a lot like people that way: Choices that seem 
arbitrary usually have reasons behind them.
The wizard displays the Detail or Summary step 
(shown previously in Figure 13‑7) if either of 
these statements is true: 
✓
✓Fields for your query are selected from two 
tables that have a one‐to‐many relationship 
with each other. (Chapter 4 explains one‐
to‐many relationships.)
✓
✓A selected field contains numeric data.
But what about the other query wizards?
Besides the Simple Query Wizard, Access 
offers three other query wizards.
✓
✓Crosstab Query Wizard summarizes mul‑
tiple rows of data into a spreadsheet‐like 
format.
A Crosstab is similar to an Excel PivotTable.
✓
✓Find Duplicates Query Wizard helps you 
locate duplicate records in a table or query.
This wizard locates all records in the 
customer table that have the exact same 
content in the fields specified during the 
query’s creation. After it finds the dupli‑
cates, you can decide whether the records 
in question are truly redundant or simply 
have a lot in common.
✓
✓Unmatched Query Wizard finds unrelated 
records in two tables that share a common 
field.
If an Orders table contains orders for a 
customer who isn’t in the Customers table, 
you have yourself a problem — orders in 
the system and no one to bill. Sounds like a 
recipe for the unemployment line! How can 
such a thing happen? Referential integrity 
prevents a child table from containing a 
record that has no corresponding record 
in the parent table. (Chapter 4 covers refer‑
ential integrity.) If you don’t turn Referential 
Integrity on, it’s quite possible to put in an 
order for a nonexistent customer. The Find 
Unmatched Query Wizard can find records 
with reference problems and help you get 
to the bottom of such a dilemma.

Getting Your Feet Wet 
with Ad Hoc Queries
If you use Access regularly, you need to know how to build a query from 
scratch. This is where Design view comes into play. Design view may look a 
little complicated — check out Figure 13‑10 — but it’s really not that bad, and 
you have seen it before, when building the filters we just looked at. You’ll be 
all right, I promise! 
✓
✓The top half of the view is where you place the tables or previously cre‑
ated queries you want to include in this new query.
✓
✓The bottom half is called the Design Grid; it contains the Field, Table, 
Sort, Show, Criteria, and Or rows used to generate the results.
You’ll notice that a new tab appears on the Ribbon as soon as you enter a 
Design task. The Design tab appears under a Query Tools heading, as shown 
at the top of the window in Figure 13‑10.
To build a multiple‐table query by hand in Design view, follow these steps:
1.	Click the Create tab on the Ribbon.
A series of buttons organized by object type appears on the Ribbon.

2.	From the Queries section, click the Query Design button.
The Show Table dialog box appears, listing all tables and queries avail‑
able for your new query.
Yes, you can query a query.
3.	Add the tables you want in your query:
a.	In the Show Table dialog box (see Figure 13‐11), double‐click the 
names of each table or query you want.
After you double‐click a table, a small window for that table 
appears in the Query Design window.
•	After you add the last table you want, click Close.
The Show Table dialog box is dismissed.
In the Query Design window, lines between your tables (as shown in 
Figure 13‑12) show relationships between the tables. The sidebar “Get 
the right tables” explains how these relationships are essential to the 
proper building and execution of your query.

4.	In the table(s) that now appear(s) in the top half of the Query window, 
double‐click each field you want in the list at the top of the Query 
Design window.
Consider the following while choosing fields:
•	Choose your fields in the order you want them to appear in the 
query results.
•	You can include fields from any or all of the tables at the top of the 
query window (the tables you selected in the preceding step).
If you accidentally choose the wrong field, you can easily correct 
your mistake:
a.	Click the field name’s entry in the Query grid.
b.	Select the Delete Columns button from the Ribbon’s Query Tools 
Design tab.
The field is removed from the Query grid.

Adding the finishing touches
To sort your query results in Design view (as shown here), follow 
these steps:
1.	Repeat these steps for each field you want to use for sorting:
a.	In the Query grid, click the Sort box under the field name.
b.	Click the down arrow that appears at the edge of the Sort box.
c.	Click either Ascending or Descending (as shown in Figure 13‐13).
The sidebar “Just these, and in this order” shows how to arrange sort 
fields. For all you need to know about sorting, see Chapter 12.
Get the right tables
If you’ve been a faithful reader from Page 
1 of this book, you’ve probably established 
relationships between your selected tables 
and saved yourself an extra step when 
building a query.
That’s one reason table relationships are 
important. Each time you create a new query 
and select multiple tables, the relationship 
lines will already be in place for your queries. 
Database geeks call these relationship lines 
join lines or just plain old joins. Without those 
relationships, you’ll have to join the tables 
manually for each new query.
What happens if you create a query but no 
line appears between the tables? Access is 
telling you that it doesn’t have a clue how to 
relate the tables. It’s possible that you selected 
the wrong tables — that is, tables that don’t 
share a common field and therefore cannot be 
related. If you’ve selected the wrong tables, 
follow these steps to delete the unwanted 
tables and add the correct tables to your query:
1.	 Click the title bar of the table that doesn’t 
belong.
The little * at the top of the table’s Field 
list will highlight, indicating that the entire 
Table List window is selected.
2.	 Tap the Delete key on your keyboard to 
remove the table.
Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for each table you’d 
like to remove from the query.
The Show Table dialog box should appear. If 
it doesn’t, click the Show Table button, found 
in the Query Setup section of the Ribbon.
3.	 Select the correct table or tables for your 
query.
If you select the right tables and still get 
no join lines, then you can go back to the 
Relationships window and relate the tables 
correctly. Chapter 5 shows you how. (You can 
also join tables in Query Design view, but I don’t 
recommend it.)

2.	In the Criteria row for each field you want to use as criterion, type the 
criterion appropriate to that field.
For example, to show only fundraising events, as shown in Figure 13‑14, 
type Fundraising in the Criteria cell in the EventType column.

3.	If you don’t want that field to appear in the final results, deselect the 
check box in the Show row for that field.
The Show setting really stands out in your Query grid. There’s only one 
check box in there — the Show option.
After you tell the query how to sort and select data, you’re ready to see your 
query results by running the query.
Just these, and in this order
Access has a nice tool for sorting the results 
from a query. After all, queries don’t get much 
easier than clicking a little box labeled Sort and 
then telling the program whether Ascending or 
Descending is your choice for sort‐flavor‐of‐
the‐moment.
The only problem with this little arrangement 
is that Access automatically sorts the results 
from left to right. If you request only one sort, 
this order is no big deal. But if you request two 
sorts, the column that’s closest to the left side 
of the query automatically becomes the primary 
sort, with any other field playing second (or 
third) fiddle. Another trick? If you want to sort 
by a field and also display it in a different order 
within the fields included in the query, include 
that field twice — but only show it once. Just 
turn off the Display check box for the column 
where you’re using the field for sorting.
Taking control of the sort order isn’t hard, but 
it also isn’t obvious. Because Access looks 
at the Query grid and performs the sorts from 
left to right, the trick is to move the column for 
the main sorting instruction to the left side of 
the grid. Follow these steps to move a column 
in the grid:
1.	 Put the tip of the mouse pointer in the thin 
gray box just above the field name on the 
Query grid.
2.	 When the mouse pointer turns into a black 
downward‐pointing arrow, click once.
All of a sudden the chosen field is high‑
lighted; the mouse pointer changes from 
a downward‐pointing black arrow to an 
upward‐pointing white arrow.
3.	 While still pointing at the thin gray box just 
above the field name, hold down the mouse 
button and drag the field to its new position 
on the grid.
As you move the mouse (which includes a 
gray outline of a box, along with the white 
arrow) a black bar moves through the grid, 
showing you where the field will land when 
you release the mouse button.
4.	 When the black bar is in the right place, 
release the mouse button.
The field information pops into view, safe 
and happy in its new home.
This moving trick also changes the order 
in which the fields appear in your query 
results. Feel free to move fields here, there, or 
anywhere, depending on your needs.
Is this some great flexibility or what?

Saving the query
After you create your query, you’re ready to save it. Follow these steps:
1.	Review your work one more time. When you’re sure it looks good, 
click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar to save your query.
The Save As dialog box appears.
2.	In the Save As dialog box, type a name for the query and then 
click OK.
You’re saving the design of the query and not the results returned by 
the query. So as records are added, edited, and deleted from your data 
tables, the query always returns the data as it is at the moment the query 
is run.
Running your query
After you create your query and save it, you’re ready to run it. Follow 
these steps:
1.	Take one last look to make sure it’s correct.
Inspect the fields you’ve chosen and your other settings in the 
query grid. The sidebar “Query troubleshooting” lists common 
query problems.
2.	Click the Run button (the huge red exclamation point, shown second 
from left in the Ribbon’s Design tab shown in Figure 13‐15).
Did you get the answer you hoped for? If not, take your query back into 
Design view for some more work. To do so, click the Design View button 
on the Quick Access Toolbar.

Query troubleshooting
If your query results aren’t exactly what you 
thought you asked for (isn’t that just like a

errors. Common design errors include 
✓
✓Mixing up the greater‐than (>) and less‐than 
(<) signs
✓
✓Leaving out an equals sign (=) in your 
greater‐than‐or‐equal‐to statements
✓
✓Misspelling criteria such as region name,

s you build larger and more complex databases with Access, your ques‑
tions about the data they contain become larger and more complex. 
Simply changing the order of your records — sorting from A to Z and then 
from Z to A — and filtering it from one or more perspectives just may not 
be enough for your needs anymore. You want greater power to find and use 
data, and you need more from your database. You also need it quickly.
What to do? You can use queries that ask questions (present criteria to the 
database to see which records meet them) to help you find the records you 
need to access (pardon the expression) right now.
This chapter shows you how to set more specific criteria for your queries, 
controlling the answers to your database questions with ease and speed. 
You find out about two very powerful Access operators — AND and OR — 
what the operators do, how they do it, and (most important) when and why 
to use them.
If AND and OR are not the solutions to your query‐building needs, Chapter 13 
takes a more detailed stroll through the basics of querying, and may help 
point you in the right direction. You can create queries automatically, or 
you can build them from scratch. Chapter 13 gives you some more advanced 
ideas about queries and helps you craft specialized queries for your spe‑
cific needs.

248
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
 Working with AND and/or OR
AND and OR are the most powerful and popular of the Boolean terms.
In written language, you probably know when to use and versus or. If 
you’re not sure how this knowledge can be transferred to your use of 
Access, read on:
✓
✓AND is used when all the items in a list are to be chosen. For example, 
“bring a salad, a side dish, and a dessert to the potluck dinner” would 
tell the person to bring all three items to the dinner.
✓
✓OR creates a list wherein each item is a choice — “bring a salad, a side 
dish, or a dessert to the potluck dinner.” In this example, the person 
reading the instruction would know that only one item need be brought, 
but it’s okay to bring one or more (or all) of the items.
With the OR example, you’ll be spending less time in the kitchen, and 
with OR in your query, you’ll be making it possible for more of the 
records to meet your criteria. Using the employee database as an 
example, your query might say, “Give me all the people who work in 
Accounting AND Operations” — and none of the employee records 
would meet that criterion, because nobody works in two departments at 
the same time. However, using OR would work: “Give me all the people 
who work in Accounting OR Operations” would provide a list of all the 
employees in the two departments.
Boolean logic (named for George Boole, the guy who invented it) allows you 
to use words like AND, OR, NOT, LESS THAN, GREATER THAN, and EQUAL TO 
to search a database. In Access, these terms are called operators.
If you’re not sure you can remember when to use AND versus OR, think of 
it this way:
✓
✓AND narrows your query. Fewer records match.
In normal usage, and gives you no options. You do everything in the list.
✓
✓OR widens your query. More records match.
In normal usage, or gives you more options because you can pick and 
choose which items from the list you want to do.
As an example, in Access, if you’re searching a customer database and you 
say you want customers who live in a particular city and who live in an area 
with a particular zip code and who have purchased more than $50,000 worth 
of items in the past year, you’re probably going to end up with a short list 
of customers — you’ll have fewer options. On the other hand, if you want 
customers who are in a particular city or have a particular zip code or who 

249

 Chapter 14: I Want These AND Those OR Them
have purchased more than $50,000 in goods this year, you’ll get many more 
choices — everyone from the city, with the zip code, and over that purchas‑
ing level — probably many more customers than the and query will give you.
Data from here to there
One of the most common Access queries involves listing items that are 
between two values.
Here’s an example. You may want to find all the events that occurred 
between June 1, 2012 and January 1, 2015. For this list of records, you use 
AND criteria to establish the range. Here’s how:
✓
✓Put the two conditions (on or after June 1, 2012 and before January 1, 
2015) together on the same line.
✓
✓Separate the conditions with an AND operator.
Figure 14‑1 shows the query window for this range of dates.
Don’t worry about the pound signs (#) — Access puts those in automatically 
for you. When entering your ranges in the future, don’t type them yourself, 
let Access do its job. You don’t want it to feel unnecessary, right?
Figure 14-1:  
Find data 
that falls 
within a 
range of 
dates by 
using AND.

250
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Anyway, here’s what’s going on in the query window:
1.	Access begins processing the query by looking through the records in 
the table and asking the first question in the criteria:
Did this event take place before June 1, 2015?
•	If the event occurred before this date, Access ignores the record 
and goes on to the next record.
•	If the order was placed on or after the date, Access goes to Step 2.
2.	If the event took place on or after June 1, 2012, Access asks the 
second question:
Did this event take place before January 1, 2015?
•	If yes, Access includes the record in the results.
•	If no, the record is rejected, and Access moves on to the next 
record.
Access repeats Step 1 and Step 2 for all records in the table.
3.	When Access hits the last record in the database, the query’s 
results appear.
Note that using the greater‐than sign (>) without the equal sign (=) would 
include events occurring after June 1, 2012 — but not events occurring on 
June 1, 2012. Similarly, the second date in this query could be specified as 
either <1/1/2015 or ≤12/31/2014 to get the same results: records occurring 
before the first day of 2015.
This type of “between” instruction works for any type of data. You can list 
numeric values that fall between two other numbers, names that fall within a 
range of letters, or dates that fall within a given area of the calendar.
You could also search for dates by using the BETWEEN operator (see 
Figure 14‑2 for an example of BETWEEN in action). The criteria BETWEEN 
#6/1/2012# AND #1/1/2015# selects records if the dates land on or 
between June 1, 2012 and January 1, 2015.
Using multiple levels of AND
Overall, Access lets you do whatever you want in a query — and for that 
reason, flexibility really adds to the application’s power.
Access doesn’t limit you to just one criterion in each line of a query — you 
can include as many criteria as you want, even if by adding more and more 
criteria you end up whittling your results down to one record, or even no 
records. When you add multiple criteria, Access treats the criteria as though 
you type an AND between each one and the next.

251

 Chapter 14: I Want These AND Those OR Them
All that power can backfire on you. Each AND criterion that you add must sit 
with the others on the same row. When you run the query, Access checks 
each record to make sure it matches all the expressions in the given Criteria 
row of the query before putting that record into the result table. Figure 14‑3 
shows a query that uses two criteria: Because they all sit together on a single 
row, Access treats the criteria as though they were part of a big AND state‑
ment. This query returns only events that happened between June 1, 2012 
and January 1, 2015, AND that have an EventType of Education.
When you have a very large database and want to restrict your results to a 
minimum of records, combining a few criteria is the most useful way to go.
Really want to whittle that list of records down? Because Access displays 
the query results in Datasheet view, all the tools available in Datasheet view 
work with the query — including filters! Just use any of the filter commands 
(use the Filter tool group’s buttons to filter by Selection, for example) to 
limit your query results. (If you need a quick refresher on filters, flip back to 
Chapter 12.)

range 
finder.

252
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Establishing criteria with OR
When you want to find a group of records that match one of several possibili‑
ties (such as orders shipped from either Canada or France), you need the OR 
operator when you choose your criteria. It’s the master of multiple options.
Access makes using OR easy. Because the OR option is built right into the 
Access query design window, you can just
✓
✓Choose the field on which to query the data.
✓
✓Indicate which values to look for.
To make a group of criteria work together as a big OR statement, list each 
criterion on its own line at the bottom of the query, as shown in Figure 14‑4. 
Here you see that events between June 1, 2012 and January 1, 2015 (based 
on the EventDate field’s date range) and that are also of the Education or 
Collection (for the EventType field) will be the only records to meet the 
query’s criteria.
Each line can include a criterion for whichever fields you want, even if 
another line in the query already has a criterion in that field. (This is easier 
than it sounds.)
Of course, you can list the criteria in different columns, as shown in 
Figure 14‑5. Here you see a query that searches for Education or Collection 
events that occurred in June of 2014 or June of 2015, achieved by includ‑
ing the EventDate field twice, each time with a different date range. Such 
a search might be done to isolate events that occur in a month with volatile 
weather, which can affect attendance or result in postponements.
Each OR criterion is on a separate line. If the criteria are on the same line, 
you’re performing an AND operation — only records that match both 
rules appear.
Figure 14-4:  
OR allows 
more 
(yet very 
specific) 
records to 
meet your 
criteria.

253

 Chapter 14: I Want These AND Those OR Them
Combining AND with OR 
and OR with AND
When it comes to combining the use of AND and OR operators, Access can 
bend like a contortionist (how do they do that?). When the AND and OR 
operators by themselves aren’t enough, you can combine them within a 
single field — or in multiple fields in one or more tables.
These logically complex queries get really complex, really fast. You can end 
up confused as to why certain records come back in your results — or worse, 
why certain records didn’t make the cut. If a query grows to the point that 
you’re losing track of which AND the last OR affected, you’re in over your 
head, and it’s time to start over again.
Instead of adding layer upon layer of conditions into a single query, you 
can break down your question into a series of smaller queries that build on 
each other:
1.	Begin with a simple query with one or two criteria.
2.	Build another query that starts with the first query’s results.
3.	If you need more refining, create a third query that chews on the 
second query’s answers.
Each successive query whittles down your results until the final set of 
records appears.
This procedure lets you double‐check every step of your logic, so it min‑
imizes the chance of any errors accidentally slipping into your results. 
You can also use it to build on an existing query, adding more criteria 
and including more (or different) fields in the query — just open the pre‑
viously created query and begin working on it as though it were a new 
query in progress.
Figure 14-5:  
You can 
use the OR 
operator 
to set 
criteria for 
data from 
different 
fields.

254
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Each OR line (each line within the query) is evaluated separately so that all 
the records returned by a single line will appear in the final results. If you 
want to combine several different criteria, make sure that each OR line repre‑
sents one aspect of what you’re searching.
For example, in our Pantry database, querying for events that happened 
before June 1, 2012 and after June 1, 2014 requires the OR condition, and 
using an OR condition means that the criteria go on separate lines.
Imagine, however, that you want to find only the events that happened within 
that range of dates but that were also of a particular type or run by a particu‑
lar volunteer. For such a query to work, you need to repeat the date‐range 
information on each OR line.
To set up this query, you need criteria on separate lines:
✓
✓One line asks for events that happened within a range of dates 
(EventDate).
✓
✓The other Criteria line shows the EventType we want to see — 
Fundraising or Collection this time.
Figure 14‑6 shows this combination of AND and OR operators in action — a 
range of dates within one year, and events relative to another year, along 
with specific EventType values.
When reviewing your query criteria, keep these points in mind:
✓
✓Separately, make sure each line represents a group that you want 
included in the final answer.
✓
✓Check to be sure that the individual lines work together to give you the 
answer you’re seeking:
•	AND criteria all go on the same line and are evaluated together.
•	OR criteria go on separate lines. Each line is evaluated separately.
•	Criteria that you want to use in each OR statement must be 
repeated on each separate line in the query grid.

Any criteria 
placed on 
separate 
lines are 
seen as OR 
statements.

ver need to know how many orders were placed in the past month? Or 
total donations for last year? How about the top ten best‐selling prod‑
ucts for the current year? If you answered yes to any of these questions (or 
have similar questions that need answering), then this chapter is for you. 
Here I discuss the fabulous Total row. The Total row does it all for your data! 
Well, actually, it summarizes your data via the select query. (If you don’t 
know what a select query is or how to create one, I suggest you go back and 
read Chapter 13 before beginning the material in this chapter.)
Say Hello to the Total Row
In Chapter 13, I show you how simple select queries can fetch data, such as 
a list of volunteers who reside in California or all the details of tofu sales. 
The Total row takes the select query one step further and summarizes the 
selected data. The Total row can answer questions such as, “How many of 
our volunteers reside in California?” and “How much money did we make in 
tofu sales last month?” It can also do statistical calculations, such as stan‑
dard deviations, variances, and maximum and minimum values. For a com‑
plete list of what the Total row can do for each field selected in the Field row, 
see Table 15‑1.

256
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
To make Access perform these calculations, you must first group your 
records together by using the Total row’s Group By function. (The Total row 
makes an appearance in Figure 15‑1.) As you might imagine, Group By treats 
multiple repeated instances of information as one. It puts all the Californians 
together on one row so you can count the number of Californians in your 
database. Typically, you apply Group By to a text or ID field and the remain‑
ing functions in the Total row on numeric fields.
The most commonly used items among the Total row’s offerings are Group 
By, Sum, Avg, Count, and the odd‐sounding option Where. Later sections in 
this chapter go into more depth about these items — explaining what they 
do, how to use them, and why you really do care about all this stuff.

Adding the Total Row to Your Queries
By default, Access always assumes you want a simple select query. You must 
tell it specifically that you want to summarize your data; adding the Total row 
to your query does the trick.
Okay, enough chatter about the Total row; it’s time to get busy. Make sure 
you’re in Design view, and then follow these steps to create summary queries 
with the Total row:
1.	Create a new select query or open an existing select query that con-
tains the data you want to summarize.
If you’re scratching your head at this point, refer to Chapter 13 for infor‑
mation on creating select queries.
2.	Turn on the Total row by clicking the Totals button in the Show/Hide 
group of the Design Ribbon’s Query Tools tab.
The Total row appears between the Table and Sort rows on the query 
grid. For every field already in your query, Access automatically fills the 
Total row with its default entry, Group By.
Figure 15-1:  
The Total 
row appears 
between 
the Table 
and the Sort 
rows.

258
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
The Totals button displays the Greek letter sigma (Σ). Mathematicians, 
engineers, and others with questionable communication skills use this 
symbol when they mean “give me a total.”
3.	To change a field’s Total entry from Group By to something else, click 
that field’s Total row.
The blinking‐line cursor appears in the Total row, right next to a down‐
arrow button.
4.	Click the down‐arrow button in the field’s Total row and then select 
the new Total entry you want from the drop‐down menu that appears.
The new entry appears in the Total row.
5.	Make any other changes you want and then run the query.
By setting values in the Total row, the query results automatically 
include the summary (or summaries) you selected. How about that?
The following section shows how to use the most popular and useful Total 
row options.
Working Out the Total Row
This section focuses on the most commonly used items in the Total row’s 
toolbox: Group By, Sum, Count, and Where. Remember, the choice made in 
the Total row applies to the field selected in the Field row above it.
Unless you’re a statistician or scientist, the information in this chapter 
should suffice for all your Total row needs. Even though I don’t discuss 
standard deviations or variances, they work the same way as Sum or Count. 
Check the Access Help system (press F1 on your keyboard) for more about 
the less popular Total row functions.
Most Total row options perform well by themselves, but they also work 
well with others. When you run multiple queries, try using several different 
options together to save yourself time. It takes some practice to ensure that 
everything works the way you want, but the benefits (more information with 
less effort) make up for the investment.
Putting it together with Group By
The Group By instruction has two functions:
✓
✓To organize your query results into groups based on the values in one or 
more fields.
✓
✓To eliminate duplicate entries in your results.

259

 Chapter 15: Number Crunching with the Total Row
When you turn on the Total row in your query grid, Access automatically 
puts in a Group By for every field on the grid. Group By combines like 
records so that the other Total row instructions (such as Sum and Count) 
can do their thing. So to make effective use of the Total row, your query must 
return one or more fields that contain duplicate information across records.
✓
✓Putting a single Group By instruction in a query tells Access to total 
your results by each unique value in that field (by each volunteer or 
product name, for example). Each unique item appears only once in the 
results, on a single line with its summary info.
✓
✓If you include more than one Group By instruction in a single query 
(such as the one shown in Figure 15‑2), Access uses the Group By 
instruction to build a summary line for every unique combination of 
the fields. Grouping works like sorting. Access groups by the position 
of grouped fields from left to right in query design. It’ll group by the 
closest field to the left first, the second closest field to the left second, 
and so on.
Put the Group By instruction into the field you want to summarize — the one 
that answers the question, “What do you want to count by?” or “What needs 
totaling?” To count California volunteers (for example), group by the State 
field in your table. To produce a list of total dollar donations by volunteer, 
you need to group by the FirstName and LastName fields.
Figure 15-2:  
This query 
counts the 
donations 
for every 
combination 
of data in 
the City 
and State 
fields.

260
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
When you use Group By, Access sorts the results automatically, in an order 
based on the field you specified with the Group By instruction. If you put 
Group By in the State field, for example, Access sorts your results alpha‑
betically by the contents of that field. To override this behavior and choose a 
different sorting order, just use the Sort row in your query grid. Here’s how:
1.	Choose the field that you want to sort everything by.
2.	Put the appropriate sorting command (Ascending or Descending, 
depending on your needs) in that field’s Sort row, as shown in 
Figure 15‐3).
Access organizes the query results in the indicated order.
Well, that certainly sums it up
Sum finds the total value of numeric fields:
✓
✓When you put the Sum instruction in a field, Access totals the values in 
that field.

✓If you use the Sum instruction on the only field in a query grid, Access 
calculates a grand total of the values in that field for the entire table.
✓
✓When you pair a Sum instruction with a Group By instruction (as shown 
in Figure 15‑4), your results display a sum for each unique entry in the 
Group By field.
✓
✓Pair the Sum instruction with any other Total row option to get more 
than one summary for each line of your results. Count and Sum naturally 
go together, as do Sum and Avg (Average), Min (Minimum value), and 
Max (Maximum value).
To limit the range of the records totaled in Sum, use the Where instruction 
(described later in this chapter).

 Chapter 15: Number Crunching with the Total Row
Counting, the easy way
Use the Count instruction in the query when you want to know how many 
entries are in the group, instead of performing mathematical calculations on 
numeric fields for the group.
Don’t see what you expect in your results?
Sometimes, when I run a summary query, a few 
lines are “missing.” I expect to see them, but 
they just aren’t there. That begs the question 
“Why?” Usually it’s because of the type of join 
between tables in my query. The default join is 
called an inner join, in which a row can appear 
in the query only if matching records exist in 
both tables. So for a volunteer to show up on a 
donations count query that joins the Volunteers 
and Donations tables, every volunteer must 
have at least one donation in the Donations 
table. If I want a query to show volunteers who 
haven’t made a donation yet, I have to change 
the type of join to an outer join, which will 
accommodate that condition.
To change join types between any two tables in 
a query (in my example here, the Volunteers and 
Donations tables), display the Join Properties 
dialog box by double‐clicking the line that 
connects the two tables. You have to be good 
with the mouse on this one. If you miss the join 
line, nothing happens. This can be one of those 
take‐a‐sledge‐hammer‐to‐your‐computer 
moments. However, don’t despair. Just point 
to the line once again and double‐click. If the 
tip of the mouse pointer is on the line, the Join 
Properties dialog box will pop up.
Read options 2 and 3 carefully and select 
whichever one is appropriate for your situation. 
Each option will create an outer join. In the 
example given previously, the option that reads 
“2: Include ALL records from ‘Volunteers’ and 
only those records from ‘Donations’ where 
the joined fields are equal” would be correct. 
This option displays all volunteers, regardless 
of their donation situation. So I’ll see 0 next to 
each volunteer who has yet to donate — plus a 
donation count next to those who have donated.

Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Because Count doesn’t attempt any math on a field’s data, it works on a field 
of any data type in your tables.
When used by itself in a query (as shown in Figure 15‑5), Count tallies the 
number of entries in a particular field across every record in the entire table 
and then displays the answer. By using Count with one or more Group By 
instructions in other fields, Access counts the number of items relating to 
each unique entry in the Group By field.
For a quick and accurate count of the number of records in a group, point 
the Group By and Count instructions at the same field in your query grid, 
as shown in Figure 15‑6. To be part of the group, the records need match‑
ing data in a certain field. Because you know that the field for your Group 
By instruction contains something (namely, the data that defines groups 
for the query results), that field is a perfect candidate for the Count instruc‑
tion as well. Add the field to your query grid a second time by choosing the 
same field name again — in a new column — and then selecting Count in the 
Total row.
Apply a calculation to a field, and Access tacks on a newfangled word such as 
SumOf or CountOf or <insert calculation name here>Of to the beginning of the 
field name in Datasheet view. To insert your own (more meaningful) column 
heading, type the heading followed by a colon (as in StateCount:) in front of 
the field name on the query grid (see Figure 15‑7).


 Chapter 15: Number Crunching with the Total Row
Narrowing the results with Where
The Where instruction works a bit differently from the other options in the 
Total row. The Where instruction lets you add criteria to the query (such 
as showing volunteers from certain states, or including orders placed only 
after a certain date) without including additional fields in your results. In fact, 
Access won’t allow you to show a field in your query results that contains the 
Where instruction.
The query in Figure 15‑8 uses a Where instruction to limit which records 
appear in the query results. Normally, that query would count donations by 
volunteer, using every record in the table. Adding a Where instruction to 
the City field tells the query that it must test the data before including it in 
the results. In this case, the Where instruction’s criteria include records for 
those people living in Lancaster or Marietta.

Part IV: The Power of Questions 
Creating Your Own Top‐Ten List
Here’s a problem that is a snap to solve with Access. Suppose you need 
a list of your top ten volunteers, ranked by donation amounts. Or a list of 
the top five best‐selling products last year. Or a list of the top whatever. 
The query property Top Values takes all the dirty work out of this chore. 
Simply set it and forget it — the dirty work, that is! You can return the top 
values (for example, the top 5 out of a list of 40) or top percentage of values 
(say, the top 5 percent, which returns the top 2 out of 40) with the Top 
Values property.
Follow these instructions to make a top‐ten (or whatever number you 
choose) list:
1.	Open the query containing the data for your top‐values list in 
Design view.
The query must contain at least one numerical field so that a set of 
top values can be selected. Usually, it’s a summary query, such as 
total donation amount by volunteer. The query must be sorted on the 
numerical field.
2.	From the Design tab on the Ribbon, locate the Return button in the 
Query Setup group of buttons.
3.	Click the drop‐down list arrow next to the Return button and select a 
choice from the list or type your own number in the box.
Because 10 isn’t on the list, you’ll have to type 10 in the box to generate 
a top‐ten list. (See Figure 15‑9.)
4.	Switch to Datasheet view.
The list is limited to the range of top values determined by the number 
or percentage you entered in the box.
The Top Values property returns the top values for whatever column is 
sorted first in the query (Access sorts first by the leftmost field that has Sort 
row instructions in the QBE grid). If you tell Access to show you the top ten 
volunteers in donation amount based on a field called DonationAmount, 
you won’t get them unless you sort on the DonationAmount field. Choose 
Descending in the Sort row of the DonationAmount field to have Access 
order them for you from highest to lowest.

 Chapter 15: Number Crunching with the Total Row
Choosing the Right Field for the 
Summary Instruction
Deciding which field gets a Sum, Count, or other Total row instruction greatly 
affects your query results. If you choose the wrong field, Access fails to tally 
things correctly.
Follow these guidelines when choosing fields for your summary queries:
✓
✓Don’t apply summary functions that require numbers to calculate (such 
as Sum and Avg) to a text field. You’ll get the ever‐popular Data type 
mismatch error message if you do.
✓
✓Fields with repetitive information (such as order date in an orders table 
or volunteer ID in a donations table) make excellent Group By fields. 
For example, if you group by donation date and count the VolunteerID 
field, you get a count of donations per day.
✓
✓When counting records, choose a field that contains data for each 
record. If you don’t, Access excludes the blank fields in its count.

Top Values 
property

266
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
To see the kinds of miscues that can happen, check out Figure 15‑10. There 
you’ll see a summary query that has been written to count volunteers and 
zip codes. The Count instruction has been applied to both the VolunteerID 
and Zip fields of the Volunteers table. The Zip field returns 17, whereas the 
VolunteerID field returns 19. Which is right? The latter is correct because 
each record in the table has a volunteer ID. Not every record has a zip code 
specified. Therefore, Access counts only the records for which a value 
appears in the Zip field for a customer. Choose your fields wisely to avoid 
this problem.
The Total row takes some getting used to. But in no time, you’ll master the 
power of this tool in your queries. When that day comes, say goodbye to 
your old friend Mr. Spreadsheet forever!

fficient database design requires that tables contain only necessary 
fields. Too many fields can cause a table to load slowly — you won’t 
notice the difference with a few hundred records, but you certainly will with 
a few hundred thousand. So what fields are often added unnecessarily to a 
table’s design? The short answer: fields that could be generated from calcula-
tions on data stored in other fields.
For example, suppose you have a Commitment table with a 
DonationCommitment field and a Donation table with a DonationAmount 
field. You may be tempted to add an AmountOwed field to your Donation 
table that stores the result of subtracting DonationAmount from 
DonationCommitment. This is unnecessary because Access can perform 
these calculations on the fly — in what’s called a calculated field.
A calculated field takes information from another field or fields in the data-
base and performs some arithmetic to come up with new information. Access 
calls the arithmetic formula used to perform the calculation an expression. 
In fact, a calculated field can take data from more than one field and com-
bine information to create an entirely new field if that’s what you want. You 
can perform simple arithmetic (such as addition and multiplication) or use 
Access’s built-in functions, such as DSum and DAvg (average), for more dif-
ficult calculations.
In this chapter, you build all kinds of calculations into your queries. From 
simple sums to complex equations, the information you need is right here.
Although the examples in this chapter deal with calculated fields in queries, 
the same concept applies to calculated fields in forms and reports.

268
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
A Simple Calculation
The first step in creating a calculated field in a query is to include the tables 
that contain the fields you need for your calculation. In the preceding exam-
ple, the commitment amount was in the Commitment table; the donation 
amount was in the Donation table. Therefore, a query to calculate donation 
amount from commitment amount must include information from both the 
Commitment and Donation tables. Access can’t pull the numbers out of thin 
air for the calculation; you must make sure the fields that contain the num-
bers you need are present in your query.
Access uses a special syntax for building calculated fields. Here’s how to 
create a calculated field:
1.	Click an empty column in the Field row of the query grid.
The good old cursor will blink in the row. Access puts the results of the 
calculation in the same grid position as the calculation itself, so if the 
calculation sits in the third column of your query grid, the calculation’s 
result will be in the third column, too.
2.	Enter a name for your calculation followed by a colon (:).
Access will refer to this calculation from now on by whatever name 
you enter before the colon (known as an alias). Keep it short and sweet 
(say, AmountOwed or Tax) so it’s easier to refer to later on. If you don’t 
name your calculation, Access will put the generic Expr (followed by a 
number) as its name. It has to be called something, so why not Expr1 or 
Expr2, right?
3.	Enter your calculation, substituting field names for the actual num-
bers where necessary.
My AmountOwed calculated field would look something like (well, 
exactly like) the calculation in Figure 16‑1.
You don’t have to use only field names in your calculations. You can also 
enter formulas with numbers, like this:
NewCommitment: DonationCommitment *1.05
If a field name contains more than one word, put square brackets around it. 
Access treats anything else it finds in the calculation as a constant (which is 
the math term for it is what it is and it never changes). If the field name con-
tains no spaces, Access will put the square brackets in for you after you enter 
the field name. That’s why I always use one-word field names — so I don’t 
have to type those irritating square brackets.

269

 Chapter 16: Express Yourself with Formulas
When you create formulas, keep these general guidelines in mind:
✓
✓You must type the field names and constants into your formula. You 
can’t just drag and drop stuff from the table list.
✓
✓Don’t worry if your calculation grows past the edge of the Field box. 
Access still remembers everything in your formula, even if it doesn’t 
appear onscreen.
To make the query column wider, aim the mouse pointer at the line on 
the right side of the thin bar above the calculation entry. Keep trying 
until you see a vertical line with a horizontal double arrow through it. 
When that happens, click and drag the mouse to the right. As you do, 
the column expands according to your movements. To fit the width to 
just the right size, position the mouse to size the column as described 
earlier — and then double-click! Isn’t Access a gem?
✓
✓If it’s a super-duper long calculation, press Shift+F2 while the cursor is 
somewhere on the calculation.
This opens the Zoom dialog box so you can easily see and edit every-
thing in a pop-up window.

270
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
When you run a query containing a calculation, Access
✓
✓Produces a datasheet showing the fields you specified.
✓
✓Adds a new column for each calculated field.
In Figure 16‑2, the datasheet shows the VolunteerID, FirstName, 
LastName, DonationCommitment, DonationAmount, and the calculated 
field AmountOwed for each volunteer.
Complex Calculations
After getting the hang of simple calculations, you can easily expand your 
repertoire into more powerful operations, such as using multiple calculations 
and building expressions that use values from other calculations in the same 
query. This stuff really adds to the flexibility and power of queries.
Calculate ’til you drop!
Access makes it easy to put multiple separate calculations into a single 
query. After building the first calculation, just repeat the process in the next

view.

271

 Chapter 16: Express Yourself with Formulas
empty Field box. Keep inserting calculations across the query grid until 
you’ve calculated everything you need.
You can use the same field in several calculations. Access doesn’t mind at all.
Using one calculation in another
One of the most powerful calculated-field tricks involves using the solution 
from one calculated field as part of another calculation in the same query. 
This is sometimes called a nested calculation, and it can do two useful tricks:
✓
✓It creates a field in the query results.
✓
✓It supplies data to other calculations in the same query, just as if it were 
a real field in the table.
Figure 16‑3 shows an example of a nested calculation in Design view.
Figure 16‑4 shows the actual results of the calculations.
Although this technique seems simple, be careful. A small error in one cal-
culation can quickly trickle down to other calculations that are based on it, 
compounding a simple error into a huge mistake. Yikes!

Owed 
calculated

272
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
To use the results from one calculation as part of another, just use the name 
of the first calculation as if it were a field name. In short, treat the first calcu-
lation like a field in your table.
Using parameter queries to ask for help
At times, you may want to include a value in a formula that doesn’t exist any-
where in your database (for example, the number .25 for a 25-percent next 
donation rate in the calculation example earlier in this chapter). If you know 
the value, you can type it directly into the formula.
But what if the number changes all the time? You don’t want to constantly 
alter a query; that’s a big waste of time and effort. Instead of building 
the ever-changing number into your formula, why not make Access ask 
you for the number (called a parameter) when you run the query? This is 
an easy one:
Figure 16-4:  
The results 
of the 
Amount­
Owed 
and Next­
Donation 
columns.

273

 Chapter 16: Express Yourself with Formulas
1.	Think of an appropriate name for the value (such as Tax Rate, Last 
Price, or NextDonatePercent).
When choosing a name for your parameter, don’t use the name of an 
existing field in your table — Access will ignore the parameter if you do. 
Instead, go with something that describes the number or value itself. As 
you can see in the query grid shown in Figure 16‑5, entering something 
like [Enter next donation percentage as decimal] makes it 
very clear what is required from the user. When you look at this query 
months (or even years) from now, you can easily recognize that some-
thing called [Enter next donation percentage as decimal] 
probably is a value that Access asks for when the query runs, not a 
normal field.
Order, order in the calculation!
You’ve written your formula and don’t see the 
answer you expect to see. You double-check 
the formula, and it seems correct. How can the 
formula be correct yet the result wrong? If you 
have more than one mathematical operation in a 
calculated expression,  Access will follow these 
rules (called the order of operations) when 
determining the results of your expression.
✓
✓All operations in parentheses are calcu­
lated first.
✓
✓Exponents (^) are calculated second.
✓
✓Multiplication (*) and division (/) are cal­
culated third.
✓
✓Addition (+) and subtraction (–) are calcu­
lated fourth.
For example, you might expect the formula 
2+3*6 to equal 30. However, due to the order 
of operations (multiplication before addition), 
Access will return 20. To make Access 
generate the expected result, the formula must 
be entered as (2+3)*6.

274
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
2.	Use the name in your formula as if it were a regular field.
Put square brackets around it and place it into your calculation, just as 
you did with the other fields.
3.	Run the query.
Access displays a dialog box like the one shown in Figure 16‑6.
4.	Enter the prompted information.
For this example, just enter the value of your next donation percentage 
(as a decimal value). Access does the rest.
This option means you can use the same query with different values to see 
how changing that value affects your results.
“Adding” words with text formulas
Number fields aren’t the only fields you can use in formulas. Access can also 
use the words stored in text fields.
A classic formula comes from working with names. If you have a Volunteers 
table with FirstName and LastName fields, you will at some point want to 
string those names together on a form or report. A text formula can do this 
for you. It can add the first name to the last name; the result is the person’s 
full name in one column.
The syntax for text-field formulas is similar to the syntax for number-field 
­formulas — the field name is still surrounded by square brackets and must 
be carefully entered by hand. Include literal text in the formula (such as 
spaces or punctuation) by surrounding it with quotation marks (for example, 
you’d type “,” to insert a comma).
You connect text fields with the ampersand character (&). Microsoft calls 
the ampersand the concatenation operator, which is a fancy way to say that it 
connects things.
Figure 16-6:  
Access asks 
for a next 
donation 
percentage.

275

 Chapter 16: Express Yourself with Formulas
Figure 16‑7 shows a text-field formula. This example solves the problem I 
describe earlier in this section: making one name out of the pieces in two sep-
arate fields. The formula shown in the figure combines the FirstName and 
LastName fields into a single full name, ready to appear on a mailing label, 
report, or some other useful purpose you dream up.
This formula consists of the FirstName field, an ampersand (&), a single 
space inside quotation marks, followed by another ampersand, and then the 
LastName field. Here’s what it looks like:
[FirstName]&“ ”&[LastName]
When you run this query, Access takes the information from the two fields 
and puts them together, inserting the space between them so they don’t run 
straight into each other. Figure 16‑8 shows the results of this query.

Hooray for Expression Builder
Creating calculated fields presents you with two basic challenges:
✓
✓Figuring out what the formula should say
✓
✓Entering the formula in a way that Access recognizes
Although Access can’t help you with the first problem, it tries hard to offer 
some assistance with the second. When all else fails, and you just can’t 
assemble a calculated field in query design exactly the way Access wants it, 
click the Builder button on the Design tab of the Ribbon to open Expression 
Builder (see Figure 16‑9).
Figure 16-9:

Don’t rely on Expression Builder
In theory, Expression Builder walks you through 
the frustrating syntax of building a calculation 
(what Access calls an expression) that meets all 
the nitpicky requirements Access puts in place. 
Although it does present you with the tools to 
build the formula, you have to wade through 
lists of every object, field, control, and function 
in the database to find what you need. You must 
also have some idea of how to build the formula 
to have success with Expression Builder. I find 
Expression Builder helpful for locating a list 
of built-in Access functions, for referring to a 
field properly in an expression, or for building 
a really long expression — but beyond that, it 
isn’t much help. For me, it’s faster to type my 
numerical operators instead of clicking those 
operators from a list in Expression Builder.
Before resorting to Expression Builder, try 
a little troubleshooting on your own. If your 
formulas don’t work the way you think they 
should, double-check the spelling of every 
field, punctuation, and spacing. Most problems 
come from simple field-name spelling errors, 
a missing quotation mark, or a missing space. 
If all else fails and you’re feeling adventurous, 
give Expression Builder a try. With any luck, it 
might actually solve your problem.

277

 Chapter 16: Express Yourself with Formulas
Expression Builder has several parts, as shown in Figure 16‑10.
✓
✓You create the expression in the large window at the top.
✓
✓The lower half of the dialog box contains three lists that work as a team:
•	The Expression Elements list provides a navigational tree contain-
ing all the items that are at your disposal to build an expression 
such as tables, queries, forms, reports, constants, functions, and 
operators.
You’ll find the tables, queries, forms, and report objects within 
your database under an Expression Element with the same name 
as the name of your database. For example, if you want to select 
a Volunteers table field and you’re in a database named Access 
2016 Dummies.accdb, you’ll see an item with that name on the 
Expression Elements list. Expand that item by clicking the plus sign 
(+) next to it to see the Tables item. Expand the Tables item to see 
the list of tables. Click the Volunteers table to see the fields in the 
Expression Categories list. Double-click the desired field to add it 
to the expression.
•	When you click something in the Expression Elements list (such as 
Operators), the Expression Categories list populates with the cat-
egories within the selected element.
•	When you click a category in the Expression Categories list (such 
as Comparison), the Expression Values list populates with the 
items within the selected category that finally (whew!) you can use 
in your expression.

Part IV: The Power of Questions 
✓
✓Near the bottom of the Expression Elements list, Access also includes a 
few items for the Truly Technical Person — including these:
•	Constants (values that never change, such as true and false).
•	Operators that are available for comparisons and formulas:
The Arithmetic category contains operators for addition, subtrac-
tion, division, and multiplication.
The Comparison category contains operators such as =, >, <, <>
Use comparisons to develop expressions for the Criteria section of 
your queries, when you need a response of true or false.
The Logical category contains logical operators such as and, or, 
and not.
The String category contains the Ampersand (&) operator that is 
used to combine two text fields.
•	A folder called Common Expressions that contains stuff that’s 
common only if you’re creating reports or working with dates.
Expression Builder works like a big calculator crossed with a word processor:
✓
✓At the bottom, double-click items in the Expression Categories or the 
Expression Values list (depending on the situation) to include them in 
your expression at the top.
✓
✓Click anywhere in the big pane on top; then type whatever you 
need to type.
Expression Builder can refer to controls on a form in your query so you can 
easily control the criteria used to run the query. Figure 16‑11, for example, 
shows a simple form called Order Report with one combo box called 
Customer that lists all customers in the Customers table.

Figure 16‑12 shows how Expression Builder finds and uses the combo box 
on the form.
Finally, Figure 16‑13 shows the expression in the Criteria row of the Donor 
Totals Report query. So how does all this work? Open the form and select a 
volunteer. Run the query, and the query will be limited to just the donations 
for the volunteer selected on the form. Cool, huh?

ver have to update multiple records in a table with the same informa‑
tion? How about copying data from a linked spreadsheet into an existing 
Access table? What about deleting a certain group of records from a table? 
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you’ve come to the right 
place. Action queries perform a specific task on a group of records in a table, 
all in one fell swoop, so you don’t have to add or update each record manu‑
ally. (Now, try to control your excitement! If you ever get into the situation 
where an action query is needed, I know you’ll thank me for writing this.)
The three most common action queries are
✓
✓Update: This query updates the value in a field for the records you 
select via the Criteria row. For example, if an employee keys in the wrong 
order date of 11/2/2015 on 25 orders, an update query would allow you 
to easily update all 25 order dates to the correct date of 11/3/2015.

✓Append: Use this query type to add records from one table to another. 
For example, your credit card company gives you monthly expense 
transactions in an Excel spreadsheet, and you need to input the 
expenses into your Access database Expense table. You can link or 
import (see Chapter 9 for details) the spreadsheet into your Access 
database and then use an append query to add the records to your 
Expense table. An append query gives you control over what records 
you add from the spreadsheet to the Expense table. Importing directly 
to the Expense table will import every record from the spreadsheet.
✓
✓Delete: If you’re in a destructive mood, use this query to delete groups 
of records from a table. Suppose you work for a company that has dis‑
continued a product as of 12/1/15 — and customers have been notified 

282
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
that any order dated after 12/1 for delivery of the discontinued product 
will be deleted. Okay, they were warned; you can use a Delete query 
to eliminate all orders for the discontinued product that have delivery 
dates after 12/1/15.
The action queries described in this chapter will alter data in your database 
PERMANENTLY. Although they’re beneficial when used correctly, they can 
wreak havoc if used incorrectly. The results of running an action query 
cannot be undone. Therefore, it’s wise to back up your database file before 
you run any action query!
Easy Update
The Update query can replace the value in a field in a group of records with 
another value. To create an Update query, first you need to determine the 
table (and the field within it) in need of updating — and decide how you want 
to update that field. When you’ve figured that out, do this:
1.	Click the Create tab on the Ribbon.
The Create buttons appear onscreen. Notice the Queries group toward 
the left side of the Ribbon.
2.	Click the Query Design button from the Queries group on the Ribbon 
(see Figure 17-1).
A new query opens in Design view, and the Show Table dialog 
box pops up.
3.	Select the table that contains the field you’d like to update; then click 
the Add button.
The selected table is added to the top half of the Query Design window, 
as Figure 17‑2 illustrates.

4.	Click the Close button in the Show Table window.
The Show Table window closes.
5.	From the Table field list, double-click the field name that the query 
will update along with any fields you’ll need to write criteria.
The fields are added to the bottom half of the Query Design window (see 
Figure 17‑3).
6.	Click the Design tab on the Ribbon.
The Ribbon displays the design commands, including the Query 
Type group.
7.	Select the Update button from the Query Type group.
The Update To row appears on the query grid, as Figure 17‑4 illustrates.

8.	In the Update To row of the field you want updated, enter a value or 
expression to update the field.
The Update To row can contain a static value such as a status (Active), 
an expression such as Date()+10, or the name of a field such as 
[RequiredDate].
If you’re not sure what you can enter in the Update To row, make sure 
the cursor is in the row and click the Builder button from the Design tab 
of the Ribbon. Expression Builder shows you your options and helps 
with syntax.
9.	In the Criteria row, enter the criteria that will select the records you’d 
like updated.
The query in Figure 17‑5 updates the status in the Status field to 
Active for those volunteers in Pennsylvania with a current status of 
Prospective.
10.	Click the Run button from the Ribbon’s Results group to run the query 
and update the records.
A message box (see Figure 17‑6) appears, telling you how many records 
will be updated.

Select query and run it. If the resulting records are correct, switch back 
to an Update query and you’ll run the update with confidence knowing 
what records you’re updating. Switch query type using the Query Type 
group on the Ribbon’s Design tab.

Add Records in a Flash
Append queries add records from one table (called the source table) to 
another table (called the destination). A common use for an Append query is 
to add data from an external file (such as an imported or linked spreadsheet) 
to an existing Access table. To create an Append query, follow these steps:
1.	Click the Create tab on the Ribbon.
The Create buttons appear onscreen. Notice the Queries group toward 
the left side of the Ribbon.
2.	Click the Query Design button from the Queries group (as shown ear-
lier in Figure 17-1).
A new query opens in Design view, and the Show Table dialog 
box pops up.
3.	Select the table that contains the source data to be appended, and 
then click the Add button.
The selected table is added to the top half of the Query Design window.
4.	Click the Close button in the Show Table window.
The Show Table window closes.
5.	From the Table field list, double-click the field names that contain the 
data to be added to the destination table.
The fields are added to the bottom half of the Query Design window (see 
Figure 17‑9).
6.	Click the Design tab on the Ribbon.
The Ribbon displays the Design buttons, including the buttons in the 
Query Type group.
7.	Select the Append button from the Query Type group (see Figure 17-11).
The Append dialog box appears, as Figure 17‑10 illustrates.

8.	Select the destination table from the Table Name drop-down list, and 
then click OK to close the Append dialog box.
The Append To row appears in the query just above the Criteria row. If a 
source field name matches exactly a destination field name, the Append 
To row will pre-populate with each matching field name from the desti‑
nation table.
If the source and destination field names do not match for a specific 
field, the Append To row will not pre-populate with a field name from the 
destination table. To fix this, click in the Append To row with a missing 
destination field name. A drop-down arrow appears to the right. Select 
the matching destination field from the drop-down list.
9.	Add criteria to the Criteria row in Query Design if necessary, to select 
just those records you want from the source table.
See Figure 17‑11 for the completed Append query.

288
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
In most cases, the source and destination fields must be of the same 
data type. For example, you cannot append data from a text field to a 
number field.
10.	Click the Run button from the Ribbon’s Results group to run the query 
and append the records from the source table to the destination table.
A message box appears, telling you how many records will be added.
When Append queries add records to the destination table, you cannot 
undo the results. Be sure to back up your database file before you run an 
Append query.
11.	Click Yes in the message-box window to run the query and add the 
records.
If you run an Append query in error, you can take one of two actions:
✓
✓Delete the appended records from the destination table manually (they 
will be near the bottom) or via a Delete query (see next section).
✓
✓Revert to your backup file, correct the problem, and try again.

Quick Cleanup
The Delete query can clean up unwanted records in a hurry. Of the three 
action queries that have been discussed in this chapter, the Delete query is 
the most dangerous: It can wipe out all the data in your table in an instant. 
Pay special attention to the selection criteria you write for a Delete query so 
you’re sure you’ll delete only the correct records. To build a Delete query, 
follow these steps:
1.	Click the Create tab on the Ribbon.
The Create buttons appear onscreen. Notice the Queries group toward 
the left side of the Ribbon.
2.	Click the Query Design button from the Queries group (as shown pre-
viously in Figure 17-1).
A new query opens in Design view and the Show Table dialog 
box pops up.
3.	Select the table that contains the data to be deleted, and then click the 
Add button.
The selected table is added to the top half of the Query Design window.
4.	Click the Close button in the Show Table window.
The Show Table window closes.
5.	From the Table field list, double-click the asterisk (*) at the top of the 
list and any individual field names you intend to use for criteria.
The fields will be added to the bottom half of the Query Design window. 
The word From is added to the Delete row in the Query Design under the 
asterisk to indicate you’re deleting all records that match criteria writ‑
ten in the Criteria row from the selected table.
6.	Click the Design tab on the Ribbon.
The Ribbon displays the Design buttons, including the Query 
Type group.
7.	Select the Delete button from the Query Type group.
The Delete row appears in the query grid, as pictured in Figure 17‑12.
8.	Add criteria to the Criteria row in Query Design if necessary, to select 
just those records you want to delete from the table.
See Figure 17‑13 for the completed Delete query.
If you don’t write any criteria, every record in the selected table will 
be deleted!

290
Part IV: The Power of Questions 
After you’ve written your criteria, change the query back to a Select 
query using the Query Type group on the Ribbon’s Design tab, to see 
which records will be deleted. If the Select query returns the records 
you wanted to delete, change the query back to a Delete query, run it, 
and you’ll know you deleted the correct records. What a relief!
9.	Click the Run button from the Ribbon’s Results group to run the query 
and delete the records from the selected table.
A message box will appear, telling you how many records will be deleted.
A Delete query deletes records permanently from the selected table. You 
cannot undo the result of running this query type. Back up your data‑

he fact that you’re reading this chapter right now tells me that either 
you’ve already been asked to create a report or you’re afraid that might 
happen. Yes, if you’re like the rest of us, afraid applies now and then — the 
idea of reporting on a database seems daunting to many users. You might 
be wondering, “Do I have to learn some really complex Access features? Do I 
have to master some word-processing program so I can make the report look 
like more than just a list of records?”
The answers to those questions are no and no. You don’t have to learn 
anything other than a couple of quick mouse clicks in the Access workspace 
in order to whip up a snazzy report on the currently open or selected 
table, in just seconds. And you don’t have to master Word or any other 
word-processing program to dress up your report and make it look serious 
and important. No, you have all you need to make a quick, simple, yet 
professional-looking report, right here in Access 2016.
“But what if I have to report on more than one table?” you’re asking. What if 
your boss/customer/partner needs a report on data from Table A and Table 
B, and you know he or she does not want to see certain pieces of data from 
those tables anywhere on the report? In situations such as these, the Report 
Wizard comes in handy; using it, you can choose multiple tables as the 
sources for your report — and even pick and choose which fields to include 
from those tables.

294
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
Knowing that there are two very simple paths to follow, depending on the 
report you’re looking for (or that someone else is hounding you for), it’s time 
to take a look at the two paths and figure out which one is right for you.
Chances are you’ll need both of Access’s simple reporting tools (the Access 
Report and the Report Wizard buttons) over time — so it’s worth checking 
them both out now. I start with an analysis of both of them and then get into 
the procedural specifics of the simplest one first.
Quick and Not-S0-Dirty  
Automatic Reporting
The Access Report and Report Wizard tools make reporting on your database 
extremely simple. If you use the Access Report tool, Access uses your table 
(the open or selected one at the time you click the tool’s Report button) to 
generate a report instantly. You can then go in and tweak margins, fonts, and 
other formatting so the result looks more like what you’d imagined and/or 
fits on the number of pages you prefer.
If you use the Report Wizard, you’re taken step by step through the process 
of choosing which fields (and which tables) to include in your report, how 
the report will look, and how the content will flow over one or more pages.
Each method has its merits in different situations:
✓
✓If you want every field in your single table included in your report, 
and you don’t mind if your report looks a lot like a worksheet or the 
way your table looks onscreen while you’re in Datasheet view, then the 
Report tool is for you. It’s quick, and it gives you a report without any 
formatting or other fanfare required.
✓
✓If you want to choose which fields to include in your report, and 
maybe want your report to include fields from more than one table, the 
Report Wizard is for you. It takes a little longer than the Report tool, but 
the flexibility and ability to customize the report’s appearance through 
a series of dialog boxes (instead of using multiple tabs and buttons) is a 
real plus.
Creating a quick, one-table report
To generate a report on an open table, all you really have to do is click your 
mouse twice:

295

 Chapter 18: Fast and Furious Automatic Reporting
1.	Click once on the name of the table you want to report on — you don’t 
need to open the table — in the left-hand All Access Objects panel.
2.	Click the Create tab on the Ribbon, and then click the Report button. 
An instant report appears, as shown in Figure 18‑1.
The table is now a report, laid out exactly as it appeared in Table view — 
as a series of rows and columns. It has a heading and a small graphic in 
the upper left corner, and some color has been added — using a default 
template — to the field names and the report’s title (which is the same 
as the table name).
If the Property Sheet panel opened along with your report, you can close 
it at this point. If you want to use the panel at some point in the future, 
however — perhaps when making design changes to the report — press 
the F4 key to redisplay it. Once the panel’s open, you can make changes 
to the settings for your report, and you learn more about how to do that 
in Chapter 19.
3.	Use the File tab to access the Print command (or press Ctrl+P) if you 
want to print the report you see onscreen.
You can also display the report onscreen, now and in the future; there’s 
no requirement that you print the report immediately.
Figure 18-1:  
You can find 
the Report 
button on 
the Create 
tab.

296
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
To save the report, press Ctrl+S or click the Save button on the Quick 
Access Toolbar. The Save As dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18‑2, 
and I suggest adding the word “Report” to the default name (which is 
the same as the table name). It helps later on when you’re making quick 
selections from the All Access Objects panel to not have two items (the 
table and the report) with the exact same name.
Your instant report formatting options
Although the Report tool works with only one table or query at a time, it still 
offers some choices for the way the report looks and how the fields appear in 
the report.
Did I say something about reporting on queries? Yes, I did! Check out 
Chapters 13, 14, and 15 for all the basics — and then some — on queries. 
When you have your own queries put together and run, you can use the 
Report button to document them!
In the Report Layout Tools section of the Ribbon (the section is displayed after 
you use the Create tab to generate the quick, one-table report), you can choose 
from a variety of options for the tabular layout of your report. You can have 
each record listed on its own row, as a series of columns, or you can stack your 
fields with the Tabular button in the Table section of the Ribbon’s Arrange tab. 
The results of clicking the Stacked button are shown in Figure 18‑3.
Hey, where is it, you say? If you can’t find the buttons to change your report’s 
tabular settings, click the Arrange tab, and look at the Table section (far left), 
also shown in Figure 18‑3. There are several choices available, and my advice 
is that you experiment with different layouts, and when you like what you 
see onscreen, print. If you hate what you’ve done, just keep clicking the Undo 
button (up on the Quick Access Toolbar) until the report is back at its pre–I 
Don’t Like That state.
If you hate the report entirely, just right-click it in the left panel that lists the 
components of your database and choose Delete from the resulting pop-up 
menu. When a prompt appears, asking whether you really want to delete the 
report, just click Yes. Remember, all you had to do was click the Create tab and 
then click Report to make this thing — so how bad would it be to start over?

 Chapter 18: Fast and Furious Automatic Reporting
Rearranging columns
Not only can you pair up your report’s fields vertically, stacking them to keep 
relevant fields together, but also you can rearrange your columns so that (a) 
your report’s readers see what they want to see first (assuming they read 
from left to right) and (b) you can horizontally pair up things that relate to 
each other. As shown in Figure 18‑4, all you have to do to rearrange columns 
is click on the heading for the column you want to move, and then Shift+click 
on any data in that column to select the data as well. You can also click the 
column heading and then click the Select Column button on the Arrange tab.
With your column selected, drag the heading and all the data that comes 
with it. When you release your mouse, the fields — the headings and then the 
data — are rearranged.
Sizing columns to fit the data
One thing that can be very appealing about a quick report on a single table 
is the ability to put the entire report on a single page (if you have only 20 or 
30 records) or on a series of pages that includes all the table’s fields on each 
page (for large databases with hundreds or thousands of records, but not a 
whole lot of fields per record). This can be difficult on a report that has a lot 
of fields or uses all the fields in a table because rarely do they fit across an

8½-x-11-inch sheet of paper. Sometimes you can fit them all across a sheet 
of paper — if you resize the fields, narrowing them so they’re no wider than 
they have to be to display the widest entry in the column.
The easiest way to do this is to narrow the columns manually. You can widen 
all the columns in one fell swoop, but that requires working in Design view, 
which is discussed way over in Chapter 19. This way is quicker for now.
To adjust columns manually — the one column that’s taking up too much 
room or each of them, one at a time — simply click the column’s heading 
and then use the two-headed arrow that appears when you mouse over the 
column’s right seam to move the seam to the left to make the column header 
narrower. Then, using the same two-headed arrow, snag the first record in 
that column and drag it to the same width as you’ve just set the heading. The 
dragging process is shown in Figure 18‑5, where I make more room for long 
company names, taking space away from Customer ID, where the horizontal 
space is not needed.
Starting the Report Wizard
So you’ve decided to take things step by step, perhaps because you want 
to include multiple tables and/or queries in your report. Or maybe you’re 
still deciding what the best path is, and want to see what’s involved in 
the process.

 Chapter 18: Fast and Furious Automatic Reporting
The query advantage
The fact that Access lets you base a report on 
a query is wonderful. When you build a report 
on a table, you get a report containing each 
and every record in the table. But what if you 
want only a few of the records? Access makes 
it easy to create a query and then base the 
report upon that query. (Chapter 13 shows how 
to make a query.)
The advantages don’t stop there. If you create 
a query based on multiple tables, Access neatly 
organizes your results into a single datasheet. 
This allows you to use the quick, one-click 
Report tool to report on multiple tables — 
essentially duping Access into giving you a 
quick report on more than one table because 
the tables are part of a single query, and that 
single query is your Report source. (If you’re 
unclear on the process of creating a query on 
multiple tables, take a look at Chapter 13.)

The Report Wizard is simple. It requires a few more steps and decisions from 
you than the Report tool does, but it’s much more flexible than the instant 
Report tool. Here goes:
1.	In your database window, click the Ribbon’s Create tab and then click 
the Report Wizard button. (It’s right there in the tab’s Reports section.)
The Report Wizard dialog box appears, listing all the fields in the active 
table. As shown in Figure 18‑6, the dialog box offers
•	A drop-down list from which you can choose other tables and 
queries
•	Two columns of Selected and Available fields, which you use to 
determine which fields from the selected table(s) will be used in 
your report
2.	Use the Tables/Queries drop-down list to choose the table you want to 
start with.
The fields from the table you select appear in the Available Fields box.
3.	Add fields to your report by double-clicking them in the Available 
Fields box.
By double-clicking, you add the fields to the Selected Fields box, and 
they become part of the report. You can also click a field once and then 
click the button with a > symbol on it, as shown in Figure 18‑7.
4.	Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each table and/or query in the database that 
you want to include in the report.
If, at any point, you want to add all the fields in a given table or query, 
just click the >> button to add all the Available Fields to the Selected 
Fields list.

5.	Click Next to move on to the next page of the Report Wizard (see 
Figure 18‑8).
You can also click Next twice, which bypasses grouping issues, which, 
for a simple report, are often unnecessary. To explore this step of the 
Report Wizard in greater detail, check out Chapter 20.
6.	Choose a sort order for your report — typically sorting on the field 
people will use to look up information in the report — as shown in 
Figure 18‑9.
For example, if your report documents a list of employees, Last Name 
might be a good choice. A report on product sales would be useful in 
Product Number or Product Name order. You can sort by more than 
one field, choosing up to four fields to sort by and either Ascending

or Descending for the sort order on each field. Figure 18‑9 shows the 
LastName field chosen for sorting in Ascending order, adding to the 
value of having grouped by Status, so that each status group is in alpha-
betical order by the volunteer’s LastName value.
Sorting is best done on fields that have either very few entries or a lot of 
duplicate entries:
•	In a name and address list, sorting by Last Name (which may have 
very few duplicates) will put the list in an order for which there’s 
very little opportunity for subsequent sorting — because the 
unique records in Last Name don’t create any groups that can be 
sorted further.
•	If you sort that name and address list by City or State (which may 
have lots of duplicate entries), a subsequent sort can be done on 
Last Name, putting each group of people living in the same city or 
state in last-name order.
•	To choose between Ascending (the default) and Descending sort 
order, you’ll either leave the Ascending button alone (for A–Z sort-
ing) or click it to change it to Descending (for Z–A sorting).
7.	Click Next to display your options for Layout and Orientation.
8.	Choose a Layout and an Orientation from the two sets of radio buttons 
and click Next.
•	Layout options (Tabular or Columnar) are simple — you 
either want to see your report as a list (Tabular) or in sections 
(Columnar), in which each record appears in a section on its own. 
Justified is similar to Tabular, but groups the fields in a sort of 
stacked jumble.

•	Orientation decisions (Portrait or Landscape) are generally easier 
if you envision the report in your head — are there more fields 
than will fit across a sheet of 8½-inch-wide paper? If so, choose 
Landscape to give yourself 11 inches of paper (or 10 inches, to 
allow for the smallest margin possible) across which your fields 
will appear.
Figure 18‑10 shows a format chosen at this stage of the Report Wizard 
and allows the user to set up the layout and orientation for that report.
You probably don’t want to use Justified unless your report has very few 
fields per record.
If you leave the Adjust the Field Width So All Fields Fit on a Page option 
checked, you run the risk of data being chopped off in the report and 
rendering the report unusable. If you have more than four or five fields, 
and if any of your fields have very long entries, turn this option off.
9.	Click Next.
A default name for your report now appears in this next step in the 
wizard, as shown in Figure 18‑11.
10.	Give your report a name.
Type a name in the long box at the top of the dialog box. At this point, 
you also need to decide how to finish things up — with a Preview of 
the report, or by leaping right into Design view to make more changes 
to your report’s appearance and content. (This part of the process is 
covered in Chapter 19.) For now, choose to Preview the Report, which is 
the default.

11.	Click Finish.
The report appears in a Preview window, at which point, you can print 
it or close it. To close it, right-click the report’s tab and choosing Close 
from the pop-up menu. If you make additional changes and haven’t 
chosen to save, you’ll be asked if you want to close without saving.

Previewing Your Report
When you’re in Print Preview mode (which results from clicking Finish 
to complete the Report Wizard process, as described in the steps in this 
­chapter’s previous section), you can’t do a whole lot with your report 
except print it. But Print Preview shows exactly what your document looks 
like. Table 18-1 shows the tools Print Preview provides to help with your 
inspection.

Another way to see a Print Preview — say, for a report you created awhile 
ago and you don’t remember what it looks like on paper — is to open the 
report (double-click it in the left panel to open it) and then click the File tab. 
From there, click the Print command, and choose Print Preview from the 
resulting choices.
Zooming in and out and all around
In Figure 18‑12, you see the report. In your preview (assuming you’re work-
ing along with me here or have tried this on your own), you may be able to 
see the entire page of your report. The parts you can see look okay, but how 
can you commit to printing if you don’t know how the whole page looks? In 
Figure 18‑13, you can click your mouse when the pointer turns to a magnify-
ing glass — as it will when you mouse-over the page. You can also use the 
Zoom tool to choose a lower zoom percentage.
When you move your mouse pointer over the preview of your report, your 
pointer changes into a magnifying glass. Use this magnifying glass to zoom in 
to the report and check individual sections:
✓
✓Just click what you want to see, and Access swoops down, enlarging that 
portion of the report so you can see it clearly.
✓
✓Click again, and your view changes back to the previous setting.

 Chapter 18: Fast and Furious Automatic Reporting
Clicking any of the page-number buttons (One Page, Two Pages, More Pages) 
sets the Zoom view to the Fit View setting. When you have two pages show-
ing, the odd-numbered page is always on the left, unlike book publishing, 
which puts the odd-numbered page on the right (unless the typesetting 
department is having a very bad day).
If you use the Zoom section of the Ribbon’s Print Preview tab rather than 
one of the page-number buttons, Access offers quite the selection of Page 
View options, as you see in Figure 18‑14. Set your system to show 1 page or 
2 pages — or click the More Pages button’s drop-down list to choose up to 
12 pages per screen (of course, you won’t be able to read anything at this set-
ting, but at least you can see how the whole report lays out).
Pop goes the menu
You can right-click anywhere on the Print Preview screen to see a pop-up 
menu that gives you the choice of switching the zoom or viewing a specific 
number of pages, as shown in Figure 18‑15. When you click the Zoom button 
drop list in the Zoom section of the Print Preview tab, you get a similar 
pop-up menu offering various zoom percentages, from 10% to 1000%.
Other than the Zoom submenu, the following useful commands are available 
when you right-click the Print Preview screen:
✓
✓Report View, Layout View, Design View, and Print Preview: These four 
options appear at the top of the pop-up menu and give you lots of ways 
to look at your report.
✓
✓Zoom: Enter or choose a zoom percentage.

Beauty Is Only Skin (Report) Deep
After looking at your report in the Print Preview window, you have a decision 
to make. If you’re happy with how your report looks, great! Go ahead and 
print the document. However, a few minutes of extra work does wonders for 
even the simplest of reports.
Start with the basics in the Page Setup dialog box. To get there, right-click 
anywhere on the report and choose Page Setup from the pop-up menu. (This 
command and others hidden away in the pop-up menu are briefly explained 
in the preceding section of this chapter.)
Use the Page Setup dialog box to fine-tune your report in terms of its Print 
Options, Page, and Columns settings. You can adjust margins, change orien-
tation, and control how many vertical columns your report content is divided 
into — all from within this handy dialog box.
The Print Options tab
The Print Options tab of the Page Setup dialog box controls the width of the 
margins in your report — no surprises here.
Figure 18‑16 shows your margin options. The page has four margins, so the 
dialog box includes a setting for each one (Top, Bottom, Left, and Right).
Here is how you set or change margins:
1.	Double-click in the appropriate box (Top, Bottom, Left, or Right) and 
type a new setting.
When you double-click the box, the current entry is selected. Access 
automatically uses whatever Windows thinks is your local unit of mea-
surement (inches, centimeters, or whatever else you measure with). On 

310
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
the right side of the dialog box, Access displays a sample image, which 
shows you how your current margin settings work on a page. After 
editing one margin, you can press Tab to move through the remaining 
fields (Bottom, Left, and Right, if you started out in Top), and you can 
adjust each one.
2.	Make all the changes you want to your report’s layout, and then 
click OK.
3.	Look at your report in Print Preview to check your adjustments.
If you need to tweak the report, simply go back to Page Setup and play 
with the options until everything looks just right.
The last item on the Print Options tab is the Print Data Only check box. 
(Maybe the programmers couldn’t think of anywhere else to put this box 
because it has nothing to do with margin settings.) If you select this option 
by checking its box, Access prints only the data in your records; field head-
ings won’t appear on the printed document. Use Print Data only if you plan 
to use preprinted forms. Otherwise, leave it alone because your report looks 
pretty odd without any field labels.
The Page tab
The Page tab of the Page Setup dialog box tells Access about the sheet 
of paper on which you plan to print your report — including its size and 
layout — as well as what printer you keep the paper in. You make some of 
the most fundamental decisions about how your report looks from the Page 
tab of the Page Setup dialog box. (See Figure 18‑17.)

 Chapter 18: Fast and Furious Automatic Reporting
The Orientation box sets the direction that your report prints on paper:
✓
✓Portrait (the way that this book and most magazines appear) is the 
default choice.
✓
✓Landscape pages lie on one side, giving you more horizontal room 
(width) but less vertical space (height).
Deciding whether to use Portrait or Landscape is more important than you 
might think:
✓
✓For tabular reports, landscape orientation displays more information for 
each field, thanks to the wider columns. Unfortunately, the number of 
records you can view per page decreases in the process. (After all, that 
piece of paper is only so big.)
✓
✓Columnar reports don’t do very well in a landscape orientation because 
they usually need more vertical space than horizontal space.
Your other choices for the Page tab are determined by your printing 
capabilities:
✓
✓The Size drop-down list in the Paper section of the tab enables you to 
choose the size of the paper you want to use. (Refer to Figure 18‑17.)
✓
✓The Source drop-down list gives you the option to
•	Use your regular paper feed (the Automatic choice).
•	Use another automatic source, should your printer be equipped 
with multiple trays.
•	Feed your paper manually into the printer.
✓
✓The last part of the Page tab lets you choose a specific printer for 
this report.

Page tab

a printer,

and more.

312
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
Most of the time you can leave this setting alone; it’s useful only if you 
want to force this report to always come from one specific printer at 
your location. You can choose either
•	The Default Printer option: Access uses whatever printer 
Windows says to use.
•	The Use Specific Printer option: You choose the printer yourself.
If you click the Use Specific Printer option, the Printer button 
comes to life. Click this button to choose from among your  
available printers.
The Columns tab
You get to make more decisions about your report’s size and layout on the 
Columns tab, as shown in Figure 18‑18.
The Columns tab of the Page Setup dialog box is divided into three sections:
✓
✓Grid Settings: Controls how many columns your report uses and how far 
apart the different elements are from each other.
✓
✓Column Size: Adjusts the height and width of your columns.
✓
✓Column Layout: Defines the way Access places your data in columns 
(and uses an easy-to-understand graphic to show you as well).
The default number of columns is one column to a page, but you can easily 
change the setting to suit your particular report. Just keep in mind that with 
more columns, your report may show less information for each record. If you 
use so many columns that some of the information won’t fit, Access conve-
niently displays a warning.
Figure 18-18:

Layout 
area of the 
Columns tab 
enables you 
to format a 
report with 
vertical 
columns.

313

 Chapter 18: Fast and Furious Automatic Reporting
If the number of columns you select fits (or if you’re willing to lose your view 
of the information in some of your fields), click OK to see a view of how your 
document looks with multiple columns.
The Grid Settings section of the Columns tab also adjusts
✓
✓Row Spacing: Adjusts the space (measured in your local unit of dis-
tance) between the horizontal rows. Simply click the Row Spacing box 
and enter the amount of space that you want to appear between rows. 
Again, this setting is a matter of personal preference.
✓
✓Column Spacing: Adjusts the width of your columns. If you narrow this 
width, you make more room, but your entries are more difficult to read.
The bottom section of the Columns tab, called Column Layout, controls how 
your columns are organized on the page. You have two options here:
✓
✓Down, then Across: Access starts a new record in the same column (if 
the preceding record has not filled up the page). For example, Record 13 
starts below Record 12 on the page (provided there’s enough room), and 
then Records 14 and 15 appear in the second column.
✓
✓Across, then Down: Access starts Record 13 across from Record 12, and 
then puts Record 14 below Record 12, and Record 15 below Record 13, 
and so on.
If your columns don’t look exactly right the first time, keep trying. Small 
adjustments to the row and column spacing produce big changes throughout 
a long report. The onscreen preview gives you an easy way to check how the 
report looks — and prevents you from killing multiple trees in the quest for 
perfection.

he Report Wizard does most of the dirty work of report creation. 
However, it has its shortcomings. Most of the Report Wizard’s shortcom-
ings have to do with text — sometimes the text is cut off, it’s not aligned 
properly, it’s too small, it’s too big — you get the idea.
Along the way, you may not like the Report Wizard’s color choices or 
design elements as well. Don’t despair. (Hopefully, you’re never at a point 
in your life where you’ll despair over an Access report, but I have to throw 
some drama in here somewhere.) Design and Layout views hold the key to 
unlocking the report of your dreams. (I know — who isn’t dreaming about 
Access reports?)
In this chapter, I discuss some of the most popular report Design and Layout 
view tasks. With this knowledge, you can create professional-quality reports 
and be the envy of the office.

316
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
Report Repairs
Design and Layout views are the places to be for tweaking reports — but 
which view to use and when? Usually your best options are as follows:
✓
✓Design view: Great for those situations where you want to add new 
elements (stuff like lines, titles, and subtitles) to the report.
Figure 19‑1 shows a report in Design view.
✓
✓Layout view: A better choice for when you want to format existing 
elements. (Layout view shows you actual data as it will appear on the 
printed page.)
Figure 19‑2 shows the same report in Layout view.

 Chapter 19: Professionally Designed Reports Made Easy
You have many ways to change report views. Here are some of the 
most common:
✓
✓After you create a report with the Report Wizard, the wizard asks 
whether you want to
•	Preview the report.
•	Modify the report’s design.
Click the Modify the Report’s Design option to send the wizard’s cre-
ation straight into Design view.
✓
✓While a report is print previewed on the screen, use the row of View 
buttons on the lower right corner of your screen:
•	Design view is the last button from the right.
•	Layout view is the second-to-last button from the right.
✓
✓To open a report in Design or Layout view from the Navigation pane, 
follow these steps:
1.	Right-click the report you want to work on.
A shortcut menu pops up.
2.	Select Design View or Layout View from the shortcut menu.

318
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
Report Organization
Access provides the following design tools to control the layout of your 
report — where the report data appears on the printed page and where the 
pages break.
Structural devices
When you look at a report in Design or Layout view, Access displays a ton 
of markers (called controls by Access) that are grouped into several areas 
(called sections by Access). Together, these design elements make up the 
layout of your report — and determine where the report data appears on the 
printed page.
Controls
In Design or Layout view, controls show the following:
✓
✓Where Access plans to put the report elements (such as text, lines, or 
logos) on the printed page.
✓
✓How the program plans to format each element.
Access uses three kinds of controls for text, depending on what information 
the report includes:
✓
✓Text boxes: Boxes that display a particular field’s data in the report.
Most fields you want to include in the final report are represented as a 
text box in Design view. (The exception is a Lookup field, which is repre-
sented on the report as a combo box.)
✓
✓Combo boxes: Report combo boxes do not act the same way as form 
combo boxes. On a report, you’ll see the value of the combo box but will 
not see the drop-down arrow toward the right end of the combo box.
✓
✓Labels: Plain, simple text markers that display a text message on 
the report.
Sometimes labels stand alone (for example, “Ken Cook Enterprises — 
Monthly Sales”). Often they accompany a text box to show people who 
read the report what data they’re looking at (“Volunteer ID,” or “Event,” 
for example).

319

 Chapter 19: Professionally Designed Reports Made Easy
Sections
The sections (report headers, for example) determine where and how often 
the elements will print.
The report design in Figure 19‑3 displays the most common sections (in the 
order of their appearance on the page).
Chapter 20 shows how to slice and dice your sections. The following informa-
tion is a summary of the report sections.
Headers
Access provides a pair of header sections for the top of reports.
The header section you use depends on whether you need to print informa-
tion at the beginning of the report or on every page:
✓
✓Report Header: Anything in the report header prints just once at the 
very start of the report — the top of the first page.
Typically, a report title appears in the report header.
✓
✓Page Header: Information in the page header prints at the top of 
every page.
On the report’s first page, the page header appears below the report 
header.
Typically, the page header contains column heading labels. You can 
also add design elements such as lines or shaded rectangles to the page 
header to separate the data rows from the column headings. You may 
want the report title to appear on every page. If so, place it in the Page 
Header and it will!
Figure 19-3:  
Common 
report 
sections.

320
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
Detail
The Detail section displays the essence of the report — the actual database 
records. The Detail section appears only once in Design view. However, the 
Detail section is repeated for every record in the actual report as seen in 
Layout view.
The report automatically fits as many Detail sections (records) as possible 
between the header and footer sections on each page of your report.
The data in the Detail section usually fills the majority of each report page.
Footers
Access provides a pair of footer sections for the bottom of reports.
The footer section you need depends on whether you need to print informa-
tion at the end of the report or on every page:
✓
✓Page Footer: When each page is nearly full, Access finishes it off by 
printing the page footer at the bottom.
Common page footer elements are the date and page number.
✓
✓Report Footer: At the bottom of the last page, immediately following the 
page footer, the report footer is the last thing that prints on the report. 
This information prints only once.
Typically, the report footer contains summary formulas that calculate 
grand totals for numeric columns (such as total dollar sales).
Page breaks
By default, Access fills each report page automatically with as many records 
as possible and then starts another page. But Access does provide a couple 
of ways that you can control how reports start new pages:
✓
✓Grouping: Places like records together.
For example, you’re printing a donation report by month and you want 
each month to start at the top of a page. If you group the report by 
month and add a group footer, you can tell Access to start a new page 
after each month’s footer prints.
For more about putting records into groups, see Chapter 20.
✓
✓Page Break control: Starts a new page from the point where the control 
is placed in the Report layout.
The following sections show how to add and remove page breaks.

321

 Chapter 19: Professionally Designed Reports Made Easy
Grouping is much more efficient in controlling page breaks than the Page 
Break control. Only use the Page Break control if you can’t get the pages to 
break the way you want with grouping.
Inserting a page break
Here’s how to add a page break in Design view:
1.	On the Design tab of the Ribbon, click the Controls button in the 
Controls group and then select the Insert Page Break button. (See the 
Ribbon in Figure 19‑4.)
The mouse pointer changes to a crosshairs with a page next to it.
2.	Position the crosshairs wherever you want the page break and 
then click.
A small horizontal line appears on the left side of the report. What you 
are seeing is actually the selected Page Break control. Click somewhere 
away from the line, and that line will become a series of dots, as shown 
in Figure 19‑4. From now on, a new page always begins at the spot of the 
marker.
Figure 19-4:  
The Page 
Break 
control.

322
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
Removing a page break (or any other control, for that matter)
If you want to remove a page break, just follow these steps:
1.	With the report in Design view, click the Page Break marker — those 
series of dots you can see in the preceding Figure 19‑4.
Selection markers appear around the Page Break control.
2.	Press the Delete key on the keyboard.
Goodbye, Mister Page Break!
This will not remove any page breaks that are automatic or created with 
grouping. Manual deletion will get rid of only page breaks created using the 
Page Break control.
Formatting Stuff
You can change almost any existing item in a report’s design with the help of 
the Format tab, which is shown in Figure 19‑5. With the Format tab, you can 
change item properties such as fonts, colors, and borders.
The Format tab is visible only while a report is in either Layout or Design 
view. Because you can see the results of formatting changes better in Layout 
view, the upcoming steps use that view.
To adjust items in your report with the buttons on the Format tab, follow 
these steps:
1.	Click the down arrow at the bottom of the View button on the Ribbon 
and select Layout View from its drop-down menu.
The report displays in Layout view, and the Format tab appears on 
the Ribbon.
2.	Click the Format tab to select it.
The Format buttons appear on the Ribbon.
Figure 19-5:

tab on the

 Chapter 19: Professionally Designed Reports Made Easy
3.	Click the item you want to format.
A thick border appears around the item, as in Figure 19‑6.
4.	Click the button for the formatting effect you want.
The appropriate buttons will be enabled for the item you’ve selected. 
There are two kinds of buttons:
•	Toggle buttons (like Bold): They are either on or off.
•	Pull-down arrows (like Font): Offer many available choices.
I cover these options in detail later in the chapter.
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for all the items you want to modify.
If you make a mistake while formatting, click the Undo button on the 
Quick Access Toolbar or press Ctrl+Z. Your mistake will be sent away 
never to return.
The following sections step through some of the most common formatting 
tasks. Just follow the instructions, and your report will look like a million 
bucks in no time. (Now if you could only sell it for a million bucks!)
Adding color
A little color can help keep report readers awake as they browse through 300 
pages of data.
Figure 19-6:  
The report 
title is

324
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
These buttons change the color of labels and text boxes in your report:
✓
✓Font Color: Changes the color of text in a text box or label marker.
✓
✓Background Color: Changes the control’s background color, but 
not the text.
Taking control of your report
In addition to Label, Text, and Combo Box 
controls, more controls are available in Design 
view by using the tools from the Controls group 
of the Ribbon’s Design tab.
Some controls work with specific types of 
fields. For example, a check box can graphically 
display the value of a Yes/No field.
Some of these controls can be a bit complicated 
to set up. However, Access includes several 
control wizards to take the pain out of the 
process. These wizards walk you through the 
steps for building your controls in the usual 
wizardly step-by-step process. Just answer the 
questions, and the wizard does the rest.
A control’s wizard usually pops onscreen 
automatically after you place the control in 
the report. If you create a new control but the 
control’s wizard doesn’t show up to help, be 
sure that the Use Control Wizards button is 
turned on. Click the Controls button (pictured 
in the following figure in Layout view) to see 
the Use Control Wizards button. If it’s on, the 
Use Control Wizards button will have a colored 
border around it (pictured in the figure below).
Here is a list of the report controls covered 
in this book and where you can find 
information on them:

These buttons are located in both Layout and Design view on two different 
Ribbon tabs. You can find them in the Font group on the Format tab or the 
Text Formatting group on the Home tab.
You might find these buttons are easier to work with in Layout view.
When a text control is selected, the buttons will show you the current font 
and background colors for the control. To change colors, follow these steps:
1.	Click the control to select it.
The control has a thick border around it.
2.	Click the arrow to the right of the Font Color or Background Color 
button.
The menu of colors appears.
3.	Click the color you want to use.
The colors are divided into sections:
•	Theme: Colors that the experts at Microsoft have determined work 
well together
•	Standard: All colors that have been created for you
•	Recent: All colors that have been used in the current Access ses-
sion on the report
If you make the text and background colors the same, the text seems to 
disappear! If this happens, just click the Undo button on the Quick Access 
Toolbar to bring back the original color setting.
Relocation, relocation, relocation
Don’t like that column where it is? The position of your report title got you 
down? Your line won’t stay in line? You can easily move just about any ele-
ment (text box, label, line, and such) in a report.
✓
✓Most elements can be moved in Layout view. You see your data in 
Layout view, so we recommend that you start there.
✓
✓If you have trouble in Layout view, switch to Design view. For example, 
we find lines are easier to work with in Design view.

The amount of space between the controls determines the space between 
items when you print the report:
✓
✓Increasing spacing gives your report a less crowded look.
This is appropriate if you have only a few columns on your report 
and you want to spread them out to fill up the width of the page. For 
example, a report that shows annual donations by volunteer might have 
a column for the volunteer name and a column for donation amount. 
Spread out the controls to fill up the page width.
✓
✓Decreasing the space enables you to fit more information on the page.
This is appropriate when you have many columns on your report and 
you want to fit them all on the width of one page. For example, a report 
that shows donations by month may have 14 columns — 1 for the volun-
teer name, 12 for the months, and a Total column. Crowd the 14 controls 
together to fit the page width.
Moving a single control
To move a line, box, label, or text box, follow these steps:
1.	Point the tip of the mouse pointer to the item you want to move. Make 
sure the item is deselected (click off of it first) before you point.
2.	Press the left mouse button.
The mouse pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
3.	Drag your item to a new position.
As you move the mouse, the four-headed arrow drags an outline of what-
ever object you selected.
4.	Release the mouse button when the item is in the right place.
If you make a mistake while moving, click the Undo button on the Quick 
Access Toolbar or press Ctrl+Z. This will put the item back where it 
started.
To move multiple controls at one time, follow these steps:
1.	Click the first control to select it.
The border thickens around the control, indicating that it’s 
been selected.
2.	Press and hold the Ctrl key, and then click the next control.
The border thickens around each control, indicating that they’re 
both selected.
3.	Follow Steps 2 through 4 in the previous procedure to move both 
controls.

Moving a group of controls
In a columnar report, you can move an entire group of controls in the Detail 
section. Here’s how:
1.	Click one of the controls in the Detail section.
A thick border appears around the item and a Select All box (the little 
guy containing a four-headed arrow) appears toward the upper left 
corner of the group of controls. (See Figure 19‑7.)
2.	Roll the mouse over the box icon containing the four-headed arrow.
The mouse will change to a four-headed arrow.
3.	Drag the group of controls to a new position.
All the controls in the group will move at one time. Everything stays in 
alignment.
One size does not fit all
The Report Wizard as well as the basic Report button do their best to size 
your report items properly. Very often, however, neither gets it right. A 
column will be too narrow or too wide, using the space on the page ineffi-
ciently. Do you throw your hands in the air and curse at the computer gods? 
Of course not. You can size any control to your exact needs.

I find that sizing works best in Layout view; you can see the data in the con-
trols as you’re sizing them. You can also size your controls in Design view.
Follow these steps to size a control:
1.	Select the item you want to size by clicking it.
The item will have a thick border around it.
2.	Roll the mouse pointer to the edge of the selected item.
The mouse cursor changes to a two-headed arrow. See Figure 19‑8 for 
a picture.
3.	Drag your item to its new size.
As you drag with the mouse, the two-headed arrow drags an outline of 
whatever object you selected to show you its new size.
4.	Release the mouse button when the item is the right size.
The item stretches or shrinks to its new size.
Labels can be scaled to the exact size required to display all the text. To 
do this, follow Steps 1 and 2 in the previous steps and then double-click 
rather than drag. Like magic, Access figures out the correct size for the 
item and sizes it accordingly.

Spaced-out controls
The spacing of columns is a common problem in tabular reports. The Report 
Wizard creates a control group in the Detail section and tends to butt col-
umns up against each other, sometimes making data difficult to read. If this 
is the case for you, you can use the Control Padding button located on the 
Arrange tab of the Ribbon to space everything out a bit.
This adjustment can be done in either Layout or Design view, but I think 
you’ll find Layout view is easier.
Follow these steps to add space between your columns in Layout view:
1.	Click one of the controls in the group and then click the Select All box 
that appears. (Refer to Figure 19‑7.)
The labels and text boxes for all the columns are selected.
2.	Switch to the Arrange tab on the Ribbon, if necessary, by clicking it.
The Arrange buttons appear, including the Control Padding button 
located in the Position group. (See Figure 19‑9.)
3.	Click the Control Padding button.
Four padding choices drop down.
4.	Select one of the last three choices to add spacing between the col‑
umns and rows.
The first choice (None) will butt all the controls up against each other, 
so if your goal is to add padding, you’ll want to avoid that one.
Check your changes in Print Preview (see “Sneaking a Peek,” later in this 
chapter). Sometimes adding too much space between columns pushes 
one or more of them off the page. If this happens, experiment with the 
different choices on the Control Padding button until everything fits 
correctly.

Borderline beauty
Organizationally speaking, lines and borders are great accents to
✓
✓Draw your readers’ eyes to parts of the page.
✓
✓Highlight sections of the report.
✓
✓Add some style.
The Format tab on the Ribbon contains three commands that work  
with lines:
✓
✓Shape Outline
✓
✓Line Type
✓
✓Line Thickness
You can use these commands on a line control to change the appearance of 
the line or on label and text box controls to add a border to the control. The 
three buttons are within the Shape Outline button in the Control Formatting 
group on the Format tab.
Coloring
The Shape Outline button changes the color of lines that mark a text box’s 
border and lines you draw on your report by using the Line button.
This button works just like the Background Color and the Font Color but-
tons for text.
To change the color of a line or other control border, follow these steps:
1.	Click the item to select it.
The item has a thick border around it.
2.	Click the Shape Outline button.
A drop-down display of color choices appears, as shown in Figure 19‑10. 
The colors are divided into sections:
•	Theme: Colors that the experts at Microsoft have determined work 
well together
•	Standard: All colors that have been created for you

331

 Chapter 19: Professionally Designed Reports Made Easy
•	Recent: All colors that have been used in the current Access ses-
sion on the report. Recent will not display until you’ve used at 
least one color.
•	Transparent: No color applied to the object’s outline
Note: The Shape Outline button hangs out in the Control Formatting 
group of the Ribbon’s Format tab.
3.	Click your color choice from the many options.
Thickness
In addition to colorizing lines and control borders, you can also adjust their 
thickness:
1.	Click a line or other control to select it.
2.	Click the Shape Outline button to reveal its choices.
Near the bottom of the Shape Outline drop-down list is the Line 
Thickness button.
3.	Click Line Thickness to reveal a submenu of options, as shown in 
Figure 19‑11.

You’ve heard this tip before but it’s such a good one, I’ve got to say it 
again. All together now! If you make a mistake, click the Undo button on 
the Quick Access Toolbar or press Ctrl+Z to undo your mistake.
Changing the type
You can change the type of line displayed by your line control or other con-
trol border. The Line Type button handles that job for you. Eight choices are 
available under this button, as shown in Figure 19‑12. Don’t know what I mean 
by line type? Well, think dotted, dashed, or solid.
To change the line type of a control, follow these steps:
1.	Click the control whose line type you want to change.
2.	Click the drop-down arrow next to the Shape Outline button to display 
its options.
3.	Click Line Type (the very last choice) to reveal a submenu of line 
types.

Tweaking your text
You must select the text you’d like to tweak before using any of the format-
ting tools. With Access labels, all the text in the label must be formatted the 
same way. You cannot format one word differently from another. The same 
is true with the contents of a text box — unless the text box is tied to a Long 
Text field with its Text Format property set to Rich Text (see Chapter 3 
for details).
Fonts
You can change the font or the font size as follows:
1.	Select the text you want to change.
2.	Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the Font or Font Size 
list box.
Both list boxes are found in the Font group of the Ribbon’s Format tab.
3.	Make a selection from the drop-down list that appears.

To turn on or off bold, italic, or underline characteristics, select a control and 
click the appropriate button from the Font group on the Ribbon’s Format tab. 
The characteristic toggles (switches) between on and off each time you click 
the button.
Alignment
You can control the alignment of the text within labels and text boxes. To 
change the alignment of the text for a label or text box, follow these steps:
1.	Select the control.
2.	Click one of the three alignment buttons found in the Font group of 
the Ribbon’s Format tab.
Figure 19‑13 shows the alignment buttons. Pictured from left to right:
•	Align Left
•	Center
•	Align Right
Make sure your reports follow these simple rules for your reader’s pleasure:
✓
✓Align numeric data and dates to the right so the numbers line up cor-
rectly. Use the Number group of buttons on the Ribbon’s Format tab to 
help keep your numbers orderly.
✓
✓Align text to the left.
✓
✓Align your column headings to the data in the column:
•	Text column headings should align left.
•	Number column headings should align right.

Sneaking a Peek
Neither Layout view nor Design view give you a perspective on how the 
report will look on the printed page. So where can you go to see how the 
report will print?
Access provides a command called Print Preview that does the trick. To pre-
view your report, click the Print Preview button from the set of four View but-
tons on the lower right part of your screen. (The Print Preview button is the 
second from the left with the magnifying glass on it.)
Figure 19‑14 displays a report in Print Preview. Here’s how to navigate it:
✓
✓Zoom: Click anywhere on the report to zoom in or zoom out.
To zoom to a specific percentage of actual size, click the drop-down 
arrow on the Zoom button in the Zoom group on the Ribbon’s Print 
Preview tab and then select your size.

•	The right arrows move to the next or last pages.
•	The left arrows move to the first or previous pages.
•	Type a page number in the Current Page box (the one with the 
number in it), and Access will take you to that page.

✓
✓Zoom group (on the Ribbon): The buttons change the number of pages 
that appear in Print Preview and the magnification of the page.
✓
✓Close Print Preview button (on the Ribbon): Exits Print Preview.
For details on setting margins, paper size, and page orientation, see 
Chapter 18.
Getting a Themes Makeover
When you want to change the look of the entire report in a few easy clicks, 
check out the Themes button. When you click this button, Access offers sev-
eral different format packages that reset everything from the headline font to 
the color of lines that split up items in the report.
The Themes button is available in either Layout or Design view on the Design 
tab of the Ribbon.
Follow these steps to apply a theme to your report:
1.	Open the report in Design or Layout view.
Right-click on the report in the Navigation pane and choose Design or 
Layout View from the shortcut menu.
2.	Select the Design tab on the Ribbon, if necessary.
The Design buttons appear, including the Themes group.
3.	Click the Themes button.
A palette of formatting choices drops down with a variety of color 
schemes, as depicted in Figure 19‑15.

337

 Chapter 19: Professionally Designed Reports Made Easy
4.	Roll the mouse over a theme and Access will apply that theme to 
the report in the background. Click the theme you want to lock in a 
choice.
Access updates your report with the new look.
If you don’t like any of the prebuilt themes on the drop-down list, use 
the Colors and Fonts buttons in the Themes group on the Ribbon to 
design your own. If you like what you created, click Save Current Theme 
(via the Themes button drop-down menu) to record your creation for 
posterity.

Drawing lines
An easy way to make your report a bit easier to read is to add lines that 
divide the sections. Lines can be added only in Design view.
You can use the Shape Outline button (discussed earlier in this chapter) to 
dress up your lines.
You must switch to Design view to add lines.
Straight lines
To add straight lines to your report, follow these steps:
1.	Click the Line button (the one with the diagonal line on it) on 
the Controls button menu in the Controls group of buttons on the 
Design tab.
Your cursor changes to a cross hairs with a line trailing off to the right.
2.	Repeat these steps for each line you want:
a.	Click where you want to start the line.
b.	Drag to the location where you want to end the line.
c.	Release the mouse button.
It’s often difficult to get a perfectly straight line when following Step 2 as just 
described. It’s easy to fix though. Just click on the line to select it, open the 
Property Sheet (Property Sheet button on the Design tab of the Ribbon), 
click the Format tab of the Property Sheet, and change the Height property 
to 0 (zero).
Rectangular boxes
The Rectangle button draws boxes around separate items on your report. 
Rectangles can be added only in Design view. Follow these steps:
1.	Click the Rectangle button (the one shaped like a rectangle with a 
white interior) on the Controls button menu in the Controls group of 
buttons on the Design tab.
2.	Repeat these steps for each rectangle you want:
a.	Click where you want to start the upper left corner of the rectangle.
b.	Drag the rectangle shape down to the lower right corner.
c.	Release the mouse button.

Pretty as a picture
You can add some flair to a report by adding a logo. This, of course, also 
helps identify that the printed document is from your organization. Use the 
Logo button to add a logo to the report. After you click the button, you will 
be prompted to select a logo file. By default, Access places the logo on the 
upper left corner of the report.
The Logo button places an Image control on your report. You can find this 
button on the Design tab’s Header/Footer group.
Adding a logo
You can add a logo in both Layout and Design views.
Pages that contain logos take longer to print. Use your logos wisely:
✓
✓Headers and footers are the best places for logos.
✓
✓The Detail section is not a good place for logos.
In the Detail section, you get one copy of the logo for each record on the 
report. This could greatly slow the printing of your report and one could 
argue, add a few too many logos to the report!
Should you have a report title on the upper left corner of your report, 
move the title to the right to make room for the logo before you insert 
the logo.
If you want to add a logo to your report, switch to Design or Layout view and 
follow these steps:
1.	Select the Design tab on the Ribbon, if necessary.
The Design buttons appear, including the Header/Footer group.
2.	Click the Logo button from the Header/Footer group.
The Insert Picture dialog box opens.
3.	Navigate to the folder that contains your logo, and select the logo file. 
(See Figure 19‑16.)
4.	Click OK.
The logo is placed on the upper left part of the report.
After you add a logo, you can size, move, or delete the logo as described ear-
lier in this chapter.

Hitting the Office links
You can do a lot with Access, but sometimes 
you may want to use a different program 
because Access cannot do what you need. For 
example, you may need to calculate a median 
on a report. Access does not contain a built-in 
median function. To resolve this issue, you can 
export your data via the Excel button to Excel 
and use Excel’s Median function to perform 
your calculation.
Access provides tools for converting reports to 
file formats that can be opened and modified 
in other programs (including other Office 
programs):
1.	 In the Navigation pane, locate and then 
right-click the report.
2.	 Choose Print Preview from the shortcut 
menu that appears.
The Data group of buttons on the Print 
Preview tab has a button for each file 
format to which you can export your data.
3.	 Click the button for your desired format.
An Export dialog box will appear.
4.	 Use the Browse button to assist you in 
entering a filename in the File Name box.
The File Name box should contain a path 
and filename when you’re finished.
5.	 Check the Open the Destination File after 
the Export Operation is Complete check 
box.
Do this so you won’t have to remember 
where you stored the exported file and 
what you called it.
6.	 Click OK to begin the export process.
The report will be exported to your selected 
file format and then opened in the exported 
format’s application.

he Report Wizard takes much of the stress and decision-making out 
of creating reports. This is also true of the Report tool, which asks no 
­questions at all and just turns your table into a report — bang, zoom, no fuss, 
no muss. The Report Wizard is almost that simple; it asks just a few simple 
questions that you won’t have any trouble answering.
Well, maybe no trouble. A few of the questions, which I address in this 
­chapter, may give you a moment’s pause, if only because you may not under-
stand what’s being asked or how your answer can affect your report. Given 
that this book is all about eliminating any stress or concern for the Access 
user, my goal is to explain those questions — and to help you make the 
Report Wizard even more wizardly.
In addition to simplifying the already-simple Report Wizard, this chapter 
also covers the use of two very convenient and powerful report features — 
­headers and footers. These stalwart additions appear at the top and/or 
bottom of your reports, performing whatever role you dictate — from eye 
candy to outright informers. They can be very spare and simply tell your 
readers what the name of the report is, or they can be really useful and tell 
people when the report was created, when it was last printed, or that the 
data within it is proprietary or confidential. What you include in your head-
ers and footers is entirely up to you.

A Place for Everything and  
Everything in Its Place
The secret to successful report organization lies in the way you set up the 
information included in the report. Access enables you to choose how your 
fields are laid out on the report, enabling you to achieve the most effective 
layout for the data in question.
A report is effective when the reader can glance at it and see exactly what 
information is offered:
✓
✓What data is included
✓
✓How much detail is available
✓
✓Where to look on the page to find specific pieces of information
Achieving an effective layout is simple; the automatic reporting tools in 
Access create a very basic, no-confusion-here layout by default.
Layout basics
Reports come in two layouts, Columnar or Tabular.
The layout that’s right for your report is totally subjective. You can preview 
your report in both layouts and make your decision accordingly.
In either layout, each of the fields you choose to include in your report 
appears in two parts:
✓
✓Fields
✓
✓Labels (a name for the field, essentially)
The fields and labels are paired and laid out in either Columnar or 
Tabular format.
This chapter shows how you can take the default layouts that Access’s 
automatic reporting features give you and tweak them by working in Design 
view. You can drag labels and fields around to achieve a completely custom 
report layout.

343

 Chapter 20: Headers and Footers and Groups, Oh My! 
Here’s the skinny on how Columnar and Tabular layout options 
look and work:
✓
✓Columnar layout:
•	Field descriptions print with every record’s data (side by side), as 
shown in Figure 20‑1.
The layout behaves this way because both the field descriptions 
and data area are in the report’s Detail section.
•	The report title prints only once, at the very beginning of the 
report (because the title is in the Report Header section).
✓
✓Tabular layout:
•	Field descriptions (labels) print once per page in the Page Header 
section, as shown in Figure 20‑2.
•	The data areas are in the Detail section.
•	The title prints only at the top of the report.

Columnar 
report, 
labels are

of the fields 
and repeat 
for each 
record.

Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
Sections
Reports are divided into sections. The information that appears in each sec-
tion is dictated by your chosen layout.
Understanding the section concept is a prerequisite for performing any 
serious surgery on your report — or for running off to build a report from 
scratch. Otherwise, your report groupings don’t work right, fields are out of 
place, and you end up with a very frustrating, unfriendly report that neither 
you nor anyone else will want to read (or be able to use effectively).
The most important point to understand about sections is that the contents 
of each section are printed only when certain events occur. For example, the 
information in the Page Header is repeated at the top of each page, but the 
Report Header prints on only the first page.
Getting a grip on sections is easy when you look at the innermost section of 
your report first and work your way outward, like so:
✓
✓Detail: Access prints items in this section each time it moves to a new 
record. Your report includes a copy of the Detail section for each record 
in the table.

In a Tabu-
lar report, 
labels 
become 
column 
headings.

345

 Chapter 20: Headers and Footers and Groups, Oh My! 
✓
✓Group headers and footers: You may have markers for one or more 
group sections.
In Figure 20‑3, information in the report is grouped by Status. (You can 
tell by the section bar labeled Status Header — the section bar identifies 
which field is used for grouping.)
Group sections may contain:
•	The group header section is above the Detail section in the report 
design.
•	The group footer is always below Detail.
Information in these sections repeats for every unique value in the 
groups’ fields. For example, the report shown in Figure 20‑3 reprints 
everything in the Status Header for each volunteer in the database, 
grouped by Status. Within the section for each status, Access repeats 
the information for each volunteer.
✓
✓Page Header and Page Footer: These sections appear at the top and 
bottom, respectively, of every page. They’re among the few sections not 
controlled by the contents of your records.
Use the information in the Page Header and Footer sections to mark the 
pages of your report.
✓
✓Report Header and Footer: These sections appear at the start and end 
of your report. They each make only one appearance in your report — 
unlike the other sections, which pop up many times.

Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
Here’s what you can do with headers and footers:
✓
✓The Report Header provides general information about the report. 
This is a good place to add the report title, printing date, and version 
information.
✓
✓The Page Header contains any information you want to appear at the 
top of each page (such as the date or your company logo). If your report 
layout is set to Tabular, the column headings (field names) for the data 
included in the report are found in this section.
✓
✓The headers for each group usually identify the contents of that group 
and the field names.
✓
✓The footers for each group generally contain summary information, 
such as counts and calculations. For example, the footer section of the 
Department group may hold a calculation that totals the minimum bids.
✓
✓The Page Footer, which appears at the bottom of every page, tradition-
ally holds fields for the page number and the report date.
Reporting, step-by-step
When Access produces a report, what does 
it do with all these sections? The process 
goes this way:
1.	 Access begins by printing the Report 
Header at the top of the first page.
2.	 Access then prints the Page Header, if you 
choose to have the Page Header appear 
on  the first page. (Otherwise, Access 
reprints this header at the top of every page 
except the first one.)
3.	 If your report has groups, the Group 
Headers for the first set of records appear 
next.
4.	 When the headers are in place, Access 
prints the Detail lines for each record in the 
first group.
5.	 After it’s finished with all the Detail lines for 
this group, Access prints that group’s Group 
Footer.
6.	 If you have more than one group, Access 
repeats Steps 3, 4, and 5 for each group.
7.	 At the end of each page, Access prints the 
Page Footer.
8.	 When it finishes with the last group, Access 
prints the Report Footer — which, like the 
Report Header, appears only once in a 
given report.

 Chapter 20: Headers and Footers and Groups, Oh My! 
✓
✓The Report Footer in your report can be a good place to put things 
like these:
•	Confidentiality statements
•	Information regarding the timeliness of the data in the report
•	The name(s) of the report’s author(s)
•	An email address or phone number to contact the person who 
made the report
Grouping your records
When the Report Wizard creates a report for you, it includes a header and 
footer section for each group you want. If you tell the Report Wizard to 
group by the State field, for example, it automatically creates both the State 
Header and the State Footer sections. You aren’t limited to what the wizard 
does, though. If you’re a little adventuresome, you can augment the wizard’s 
work with your own grouping sections.
Before making any big adjustments to the report, take a minute to save the 
report (choose Save from the Quick Access Toolbar). That way, if something 
goes wrong and the report becomes horribly chewed up, just close it (click 
the X at the end of the report’s tab) without saving your changes. Ahhh. Your 
original report is safe and sound.
The key to creating your own grouping sections is the Group, Sort, and Total 
panel — which is available after you’ve created a report with the Report 
Wizard or while you’re in Design view working on a customized report. To 
display the panel (shown in Figure 20‑4), click the Ribbon’s Design tab and 
then click the Group & Sort button in the Grouping & Totals section.
This panel allows you to control how Access organizes the records in your 
report — augmenting the sorting and grouping you may have already set up, 
whether through the Report Wizard dialog box or while building a report 
from scratch in Design view.

You can completely customize how your report’s records are grouped and 
sorted and sort by multiple fields quickly and easily. The next set of steps 
shows you how.
To build your own groupings and add sorting with the Group, Sort, and Total 
panel, follow these steps:
1.	Click the Design tab in the Report Design Tools tab group.
2.	Click the Group & Sort button in the Grouping & Totals section.
The Group, Sort, and Total panel appears beneath your 
report’s sections.
3.	View any existing grouping or sorting, each represented by a Sort By 
or Group On bar, as shown in Figure 20-5.
The tree-like display shows the hierarchical groups and sorting currently 
set up for your report.
4.	Click Add a Group (you may need to scroll down within the Group, 
Sort, and Total Section, as shown in Figure 20-6); when the pop-up 
menu appears, select a field by which to group.
Access displays a list of available fields you can choose and use to group 
your report’s records.

new field 
by which 
to group or 
sort your 
records.

349

 Chapter 20: Headers and Footers and Groups, Oh My! 
5.	Click Add a Sort and select a field by which to sort from the pop-up 
menu.
Again, a list of fields appears. You can click a field to choose a new field 
on which to sort your records. If you can’t see these boxes (Add a Group 
and Add a Sort), scroll down, using the scroll bar on the right side of the 
workspace.
If you’ve already sorted by a field within the report, your subsequent 
sorting will be applied to the sort already applied. Here’s an exam-
ple using the employee database: If you already elected to sort by 
Department (say, while you were setting up the report in the Report 
Wizard), that sort will appear in the panel. If you click Add a Sort, your 
next logical field on which to sort might be JobTitle or LastName. 
The resulting sort would then put the list — already in order by 
Department — in further order: putting the departments in order by 
field chosen for the added sort. All the Accounting department people 
will be ordered by that second field, all the Operations people, and so 
on. It’s a lot like the phone book (remember those?) — all the records 
in that book are in order by last name, and for those listings with the 
same last name, the records are in order by first name. If the first 
names are the same, a third order — by Street — is applied; if there 
are two John Smiths, the one on Elm Street comes before the one on 
Walnut Street.
6.	To change the settings for an existing group or sort, click the Group 
On or Sort By bar and change the sort order or pick a different field 
by which to sort.
Your sorting and grouping options are determined by the nature 
of the existing sort or group. For example, when the sort is based 
on a field that’s a Short or Long Text data type, you can sort 
alphabetically.
7.	Close the Group, Sort, and Total panel.
You can close the panel after you’ve finished using it by
•	Clicking the X in its upper-right corner.
•	Clicking the Group & Sort button again (in the Grouping & Totals 
section of the Design tab).
To remove a group, click the X on the far right end of the Group On or Sort 
By bar (visible in Figure 20‑6). There is no confirming prompt; when you click 
that X, your group or sort is gone. Of course, you can re-group or re-sort by 
using the Add a Group or Add a Sort buttons.

350
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
So you want more?
In addition to adding and removing groups and sorts with the Group, Sort, 
and Total panel, you can make the following adjustments/selections:
✓
✓On the Sort By bar, click More and view a list of options, including “By 
Entire Value,” “With No Totals,” “With Title” (click the Click to Add link 
to insert a title), and options for adding headers and footers for the 
sorted records.
To hide these options, click Less.
✓
✓On the Group On bar, click More to make the same choices as to how 
to group the records, whether to include totals, and how to use headers 
and footers.
Click Less to hide the options on the bar when you’ve finished using 
them.
If you don’t see the More button, be sure to click the Group On bar to 
activate it.
With the appropriate fields in the correct header, footer, and detail sections, 
you’ve successfully finished the biggest step in building your report. Now 
you’re down to the little things — tweaking, adjusting, and touching up the 
details of how your report presents itself. The properties described in the fol-
lowing sections govern the visual aspect — the look and feel — of your report.
Some of the stuff in the coming paragraphs looks a little technical at first 
glance because these settings dig deep into the machinery of report-making. 
Don’t let the high-tech look scare you. By organizing your headers, footers, 
and detail rows, you’ve already conquered the hard part of building the 
report. This other stuff’s just the window dressing.
Customizing Properties
In an amazing stroke of usability, Access keeps all property settings for your 
report in a single panel — the Property Sheet, which appears on top of your 
report (as shown in Figure 20‑7, which shows the daunting All tab). But before 
you can start using the Property Sheet, you have to have it on your screen:
✓
✓To start adjusting the details of any component of your report, either
•	Click the item you want to modify.
•	Right-click the item and choose Properties from the pop-up menu 
that appears.

351

 Chapter 20: Headers and Footers and Groups, Oh My! 
•	You can also display the Properties panel by clicking the Property 
Sheet button, found in the Tools section of the Design tab. The 
Design tab is one of four tabs available in the Report Design Tools 
section of the Ribbon.
When displayed, you can widen the Property Sheet panel by pointing to 
its left side. Your mouse pointer turns to a two-headed arrow; click and 
drag to the left — essential if you want to use the second column in the 
panel (which shows values and settings for each property).
✓
✓To display the Property Sheet for the report, double-click the little box 
where the two rulers meet, just to the left of the Report Header.
✓
✓You can also double-click any part of the report to display the Property 
Sheet, focused on the part you double-clicked.
When the Property Sheet appears, its title bar indicates which part of the 
report you’re about to tweak. You can also click the drop-down list (which 
repeats the name of the currently displayed portion of the report’s properties) 
and choose a different component to work with.
The Property Sheet is very long and a bit scary-looking — but don’t worry 
about it. Regardless of which report component you choose to tweak (or if 
you’re looking at the properties for the entire report), some of the settings 
won’t need to be tweaked, and you’ll probably have no idea how to tweak 
them anyway. And that’s fine at this stage of the game. Seasoned Access

users often leave many of these properties in their default state, because 
default settings are the defaults for a reason — they’re effective in most situa-
tions (and suit most users’ needs) without adjustment.
The Property Sheet has five tabs along the top of the list of properties — 
Format, Data, Event, Other, and All (which is the active tab in Figure 20‑7). 
The only tab that’s really worth looking at is Format; the others are really 
only of interest to programmers, and All is just plain frightening because it 
lists every possible property you can adjust.
So, with the Format tab clicked, as shown in Figure 20‑8, feel free to tweak 
away. Change the caption, decide whether you want scroll bars on the report 
when viewed onscreen, decide which pages should have a header or footer, 
and so on. Most of the properties’ names are pretty self-explanatory, so you 
should be fine.
If you’re at a loss as to what one of the properties does or means, click the 
setting to its right and see the drop-down arrow (as shown in Figure 20‑9); 
then you can use the drop-down list to see the options for the chosen prop-
erty. In many cases, seeing those options clarifies what the property is and 
does. (Note that if there’s a numerical value in the column, no drop-down 
arrow appears — instead, you can simply edit the value.)

Controlling report and page headings
To adjust when various headings appear in your report, start with the 
Property Sheet. After the panel appears (open it by double-clicking the report 
component of your choice), try these settings:
✓
✓The default setting for both the Page Header and the Page Footer is 
Yes (or All Pages when Report is selected at the top of the Property 
Sheet) — meaning that Access prints a header and footer on every page 
in the report.
Choose Display When to tell Access to
•	Always show the header.
•	Show the header when the report is printed.
•	Only show the header onscreen.
The Keep Together option allows you to decide if a given part of the 
report should be kept with the adjacent parts. The default is Yes, with 
your alternative being No. Note that this option is not listed in the 
Property Sheet for the Page Header and Page Footer.
✓
✓The Page Header section of the Property Sheet panel comes with a 
bunch of options, too. Double-click the Page Header to display the 
PageHeaderSection panel, as shown in Figure 20‑10.

✓
✓Click the Format tab on the Property Sheet for the following options:
•	Visible: Controls whether the Page Header appears at all.
•	Height: Access sets this property automatically as you click and 
drag the section header up and down on the screen.
To specify an exact size, type the size in this section. (Access automati-
cally uses the units of measurement you choose for Windows itself.)
✓
✓Back Color: If you want to adjust the section’s color, follow these steps:
1.	Click the currently selected color.
2.	Click the small gray button with three dots (the Ellipsis button) that 
appears to the right of the entry.
This button displays a color palette.
3.	Click your color choice.
Let Access worry about the obnoxious color number that goes into 
the Back Color box.
✓
✓Special Effect: This property adjusts the visual effect for the section 
heading, much as the Special Effect button does for the markers in the 
report itself — though in this case your choices are limited. Click the 
Special Effect box and then click the down arrow to list what’s available. 
Choose Flat (the default setting), Raised, or Sunken.

✓
✓Auto Height: This option is set to Yes, but you can choose No if 
you’d prefer not to have an automatic height setting applied to your 
page heading.
✓
✓Display When: This is set to Always by default, but allows you to choose 
from Print Only or Screen Only, should those options appeal to you.
Adjusting individual sections
If you want to change the format for just one section of the report, double-
click the header for that section to display its GroupHeader properties in the 
Property Sheet, as shown in Figure 20‑11. (You can also choose the associ-
ated GroupHeader item from the drop-down menu at the top of the Property 
Sheet panel.
If your report doesn’t include any groups, GroupHeader won’t be in the list 
of components for which you can view properties, nor will there be a Group 
heading to double-click in Design view.
If your report does have a group (or groups) in it, you can tweak 13 differ-
ent Group Header settings. The settings you’re most likely to want to adjust 
include the following:
✓
✓Force New Page: This option controls whether the change for that 
group automatically forces the information to start on a new page. When 
you set this option, you can determine whether this page break occurs
Figure 20-11:  
Choose a 
section of

356
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
•	Only before the header
•	Only after the footer
•	In both places
or
•	None, to insert no page break at all
You can control the way in which section beginnings and endings are 
handled for multiple-column reports (such as having the group always 
start in a separate column). You can control whether
•	The group is kept together (Keep Together)
•	The section is visible (Visible)
✓
✓Can Grow: The section expands as necessary, based on the data in it.
Can Grow is particularly useful when you’re printing a report that con-
tains a Long Text field:
1.	Set the width of the field so it’s as wide as you want.
2.	Use the Can Grow property to enable Access to adjust the height 
available for the information.
✓
✓Can Shrink: The section can become smaller if, for example, some of the 
fields are empty.
To use the Can Grow and Can Shrink properties, you have to set them 
for both the section and the items in the section that can grow or shrink.
✓
✓Repeat Section: Controls whether Access repeats the heading on each 
page when a group is split across pages or columns.
Itemized adjustments
Double-clicking works for more than sections. When you want to adjust the 
formatting of any item of your report — a field, a label, or something you’ve 
drawn on your report — just double-click that item in Design view. Access 
again leads you to the Property Sheet, from which you can do all manner of 
technical nitpicking.
Customizing headers and footers
Although Access includes several default settings for headers and footers, 
those settings aren’t personalized or imaginative. You can do much more 
with headers and footers than simply display labels for your data. Why 

357

 Chapter 20: Headers and Footers and Groups, Oh My! 
not build expressions in these sections — or insert text that introduces or 
summarizes your data? (Now, that’s a header or footer that impresses your 
friends, influences your co-workers, and wins over your boss. In a perfect 
world, anyway.)
A good header on your report’s shoulders
How you place the labels in the report’s header sections controls how the 
final report both looks and works, so you really need to put some thought 
into your headers. You want to make sure that all your headings are easy to 
understand and that they add useful information to the report.
When you’re setting up a report, feel free to play around with the header 
layouts. Experiment with your options and see what you can come up with — 
the way the information repeats through the report may surprise you.
For example, when you use a wizard to create a grouped report, Access puts 
labels for your records in the page header by default. Figure 20‑12 shows 
such a report in action. Notice that the Status accompanies the volunteers’ 
actual status (the data). This appears at the top of each and every page 
because that label is in the Page Header section.
If you want to promote other labels to the page header, simply drag those 
labels to the Page Header section. You can do this in Layout view (as shown 
in Figure 20‑13). Also in Figure 20‑13, the Status label is in transit.

Solid footing with page numbers and dates
Access can insert certain information for you in either the header or the 
footer. Most notably, Access can insert
✓
✓Page numbers: Insert them by using the Page Numbers command found 
in the Header/Footer section of the Design tab.
✓
✓Dates: Click the Date and Time command, also found in the Header/
Footer section of the Design tab.
And this is page what?
If you click the Page Numbers button on the Header/Footer section of the 
Ribbon’s Design tab, the Page Numbers dialog box appears (as shown in 
Figure 20‑14).


 Chapter 20: Headers and Footers and Groups, Oh My! 
The Page Numbers dialog box has several options for your page-numbering 
excitement:
✓
✓Format:
•	Page N: Prints the word Page followed by the appropriate page 
number.
•	Page N of M: Counts the total number of pages in the report and 
prints that number with the current page number (as in Page 2 of 15).
✓
✓Position: Tells Access whether to print the page number in the Page 
Header or the Page Footer.
✓
✓Alignment: Sets the position of the page number on the page.
Click the arrow at the right edge of the list box to see your options.
✓
✓Show Number on First Page:
•	Select this option to include a page number on the first page of 
your report.
•	Deselect this option to keep your first page unnumbered.
To change how the page numbers work on your report, follow these steps:
1.	Manually delete the existing page number field.
To delete the field, click it (you should be in Report view at the time) 
and press the Delete key.
2.	Click the Page Numbers button in the Header/Footer section of the 
Design tab.
3.	Set up new page numbers.
Time-stamping your reports
Click the Date and Time button — in the Header/Footer section of the Ribbon’s 
Design tab — to display the Date and Time dialog box (shown in Figure 20‑15).
The most important options are
✓
✓Include Date
✓
✓Include Time
Select the exact format of your date and/or time from the set of choices. 
The dialog box displays a sample of your settings in the section cleverly 
marked Sample.
Including the date and time makes a huge difference with information that 
changes regularly. By printing the information at the bottom of your report 
pages, Access automatically documents when the report came out. It never 
hurts to include a date stamp (or a time and date stamp) in report footers.

360
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
You probably noticed the Logo and Title buttons in the Header/Footer sec-
tion of the Design tab, too. The Logo button opens an Insert Picture dialog 
box, where you can choose an image to add to the report (such as your com-
pany logo or a photo of the people or objects your report is about). The Title 
button inserts the report’s name (the name that appears on the report’s tab).
When inserted, the logo or title can be dragged to any position on the report. 
Figure 20‑16 shows an image on the report, to the right of the report’s header.
As shown in Chapter 19, you can add images (like your logo) to any report, 
and not just by adding them to a header or footer. Check it out!

T
 
he Report Wizard (covered in Chapters 18 and 20) is just the tip of the 
Access reporting iceberg. If you’re so inclined, you can use Access to 
generate useful printouts that you probably never thought of as reports — 
mailing or product labels. So grab your basket (and your little dog, too) 
because we’re off to see the wizard again, as Access provides friendly and 
magical helpers to see you through.
Massive Mailings with the Label Wizard
So you have 5,000 catalogues, newsletters, or some other mailable items 
printed and ready to go out to your adoring (or soon-to-be adoring) public. 
You also have a big Access database full of names and addresses. How can 
you introduce these two and get them started on what will surely be a won-
derful relationship? Although e-blasts have become even more common as 
ways to mass “mail” your clients and potential customers, there are still 
­marketing and informative items that (a) require printing and (b) have to be 
put in the actual mail.
With the Access Label Wizard, your sheets of labels and your database 
will be hooked up in no time flat. With the Label Wizard, you can (almost 
instantly!) generate labels that work with just about any commercial 
label product on the market. If your local stationery or office-supply store 
carries them, Access can print your data on them. All you need to know is 
what kind of label you have, which data should go on the labels, and who’s 
going to slap the labels on the mailings after you’ve finished your part 
of the job.

362
Part V: Simple and Snazzy Reporting 
The names and addresses on labels are just part of the story. You can also 
print product labels, with product names, numbers, and inventory locations 
on them, helping your warehouse personnel find and put away products. If 
you have the data — whatever it might be — and the blank labels, you can 
bring the two together to print labels for just about any purpose.
Microsoft engineers put the specifications for hundreds of labels from popu-
lar label manufacturers right in the Label Wizard. If you happen to use labels 
from Avery, Herma, Zweckform, or any other maker listed in the wizard’s 
manufacturer list — it’s a long, long list, so yours is probably in there — just 
tell the wizard the manufacturer’s product number. The wizard sets up the 
report dimensions for you according to the maker’s specifications. Life just 
doesn’t get much easier than that.
Before firing up the Label Wizard, decide on the information you’ll need for 
the labels:
✓
✓The Label Wizard uses the active table’s fields by default.
✓
✓You can create a query that includes only those fields you want to print, 
drawing those fields from the tables that currently house them.
Chapters 12 through 15 show the procedures for creating queries. It can 
be as simple as selecting the table that contains the data destined for your 
label, querying for all the records, and choosing to include only some of the 
fields. Or you can query for certain records — again, specifying which fields 
to include — and you’re good to go. Call it one more great reason to check 
out the query chapters — especially Chapter 13 — for the basics before you 
embark on this process.
Of course, if your label information can all be found in a single table, make 
sure that table is open or selected in the All Access Objects panel — and 
follow these steps to build a label report:
1.	In the database window, click the Ribbon’s Create tab and then make 
your way over to the Reports section of the tab.
The Create tab’s many tools appear, including the Report and Report 
Wizard buttons discussed in Chapters 18 and 20.
2.	Click the Report section’s Labels button to start the Label Wizard.
The Label Wizard dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 21‑1.
3.	Click the Filter by Manufacturer drop-down list and select your label 
manufacturer.
Access assumes you have Avery labels; if you do, there’s no need to 
­perform this step — just move on to Step 4.

363

 Chapter 21: Magical Mass Mailings
4.	Scroll through the list of label types and find your label’s product 
number — and when you locate it, click it to select it.
The three-column list includes Product Number, Dimensions, and 
Number Across information.
Find the product number on your package of labels in the list. If you 
don’t see it, check the packaging for an equivalent product number that 
the manufacturer recommends. If you buy a generic or store brand of 
labels, often the Avery equivalent is printed right on the packaging; you 
can look for that number in the list.
5.	Click Next.
The Label Wizard asks you for your font choices, as in Figure 21‑2.

6.	Choose the font, size, font weight (to determine whether you want 
your text to be light or very bold — click the drop list to see your 
choices for the font you’ve chosen), and the text color you want for 
your labels; then click Next.
The next page of the Label Wizard appears; here’s where you choose 
which fields from the active table you want to include in your labels.
7.	Double-click the first field you want to include on the labels.
As shown in Figure 21‑3, there are two boxes — Available Fields and 
Prototype Label. When fields from the left-hand box are double-clicked, 
they end up in the right-hand box.
8.	After the field name appears in the Prototype Label box, type a space 
after it so there’s a space between the first field and the second one. If 
the field needs to be on the next line, you can press Enter.
9.	Double-click the next field to insert it into your label and place a 
space or press Enter after the field (to advance to the next line), as  
in Step 8.
Continue double-clicking fields to add them to the Prototype — being 
careful to put spaces between fields and to press the Enter key to move 
to a new line in the Prototype box, as needed. Figure 21‑4 shows a 
­completed address label.
10.	Click Next.

often want the mail presorted by zip or postal code; check first because 
each post office may handle things differently. Rather than drive your 
friendly postal workers over the edge, bring your mail sorted the way 
they want it.

So you want to create a chart?
In previous versions of Access, charting (or 
graphing, depending on your terminology 
preference) tools were part of the action: You 
could transform your data into a bar, pie, or 
other lovely chart, suitable for any presentation 
purpose or venue. Sounds great, right? Well, 
in Access 2016 (actually, since Access 2007), 
the Chart Wizard no longer exists. If you want 
to create a chart, you have to use either 
of the following programs from the Microsoft 
Office suite:
✓
✓PowerPoint, the presentation applica-
tion in Microsoft Office: If you want to use 
PowerPoint, you can use the datasheet 
that appears automatically in a PowerPoint 
chart slide, and you can type your chart 
data (such as department names and total 
salary expenses for a given time period) 
into that datasheet. Alternatively, you can 
paste your data from an Access table into 
the PowerPoint chart.
✓
✓Excel, the Microsoft Office spreadsheet 
application: You can paste or import your 
Access table data into Excel and then use 
Excel’s charting tools to create a chart 
based on those numbers.
If you’re feeling discouraged about Access’s 
reduced charting capabilities, don’t be. Access 
isn’t really the place to build charts. If you have 
Office, then you already have much better 
charting tools in PowerPoint and Excel; these 
two applications use charting more naturally 
than a database application ever could.
A PowerPoint presentation is a perfect place 
for charts — as is an Excel workbook, where 
rows and rows of numeric data are often 
better explained with pictures, in the form of 
a nice, clear pie chart. Because you can easily 
use your Access table data to populate a 
PowerPoint datasheet or an Excel worksheet 
(and therefore base a chart on the data), you 
could say that the charting capability has 
simply been confined to the application where 
it belongs.

T
 
he Access Analyzer tools promise to help you set up, document, and 
fine-tune the performance of your database. Sound too good to be true? 
Well, like most software tools that promise the blessings of automation, the 
Analyzer tools do some things well — and others not so well.
Here is what the Analyze tools promise to do:
✓
✓Convert flat files into relational databases automatically.
✓
✓Document the database and all its parts (including tables, queries, 
forms, and reports).
✓
✓Analyze the structure of your tables to make sure everything is set up in 
the best possible way.
So which Analyze tool makes good on its promise? That would have to be the 
Database Documenter. To do manually what the Database Documenter does 
would take the average person hours, if not days. If you’re using the Analyze 
tools for the other two tasks, they don’t quite deliver on their promises — 
but they do have merit, so I cover them as well.
From Flat File to Relational Tables  
with Table Analyzer
Doesn’t this sound great? The Table Analyzer promises to take a messy flat-
file table (such as an imported spreadsheet) — with all its repetitive data — 
and convert it to an efficient set of relational tables. But, as the saying goes, 
promises made are promises broken. Unless your flat file follows some strict 

372
Part VI: More Power to You 
rules, the Table Analyzer won’t quite get it right. I would love to tell you 
what those rules are, but only Microsoft knows the mysterious rules of the 
Table Analyzer.
A flat-file database is one in which all the data is in one file. Access is a relational 
database that allows data to be stored in multiple tables for more efficiency.
Sometimes you get a perfect set of relational tables, and sometimes the Table 
Analyzer doesn’t suggest a new table when it should or suggests a new table 
when it shouldn’t. My advice to you is to give it a try and see what happens. 
Best case, it works right and you’ve just saved yourself a boatload of time. 
Worst case, it doesn’t work right and you wasted a few minutes of your time. 
Most of the time, you’ll get something of value that may need tweaking. At 
least you saved a partial boatload of time!
The Analyzer works best with a flat-file table that contains plenty of dupli-
cate information. For example, imagine a flat-file table for a bookstore. Each 
record in the table contains customer and book data. If the same customer 
buys six books, the table contains six separate records with the customer’s 
name, address, and other information duplicated in every one. Multiply that 
by 1,000 customers, and you have precisely the kind of flat-file mess that the 
Analyzer loves to solve.
With that thought in mind, here’s how to invoke the Table Analyzer Wizard:
1.	Open your database and select the table you’d like to evaluate from 
the Navigation pane.
2.	Click the Database Tools tab.
The Analyze group of buttons appears on the Ribbon as shown in 
Figure 22‑1.
3.	Click the Analyze Table button from the Analyze group.
The Table Analyzer Wizard dialog box appears (see Figure 22‑2).

Group on

 Chapter 22: Analyze This!
4.	Read the first two screens if you want (they’re strictly educational); 
click Next after each one.
Another Table Analyzer Wizard screen appears, as shown in Figure 22‑3.
5.	The name of the table you selected in the Navigation pane should be 
selected in the Tables list. If it is not, click the name of the table you’d 
like to convert.

Here comes 
the Table 
Analyzer.
Figure 22-3:  
Select a

­analyze.

374
Part VI: More Power to You 
6.	Click Next.
In the dialog box that appears, the wizard asks whether you want to just 
let the wizard do its thing (the wizard will decide how the flat-file table 
should be arranged into multiple tables) or if you want to decide which 
fields go to what tables.
7.	Click the Yes option (if it’s not already selected) to give the wizard full 
power in deciding the fate of your table, and then click Next.
If the wizard recommends that you not split your table, click the Cancel 
button and pat yourself on the back for a job well done. This message 
means that the wizard thinks your table is fine just as it is.
If the wizard does split your table, it will analyze your table and show 
you its findings. The results look like those shown in Figure 22‑4.
8.	Make sure the information from your flat-file table is grouped cor-
rectly into new tables:
•	If the information is grouped correctly, name the tables by double-
clicking each table’s title bar and typing a new name in the result-
ing dialog box.
•	If the information is not grouped correctly, use your mouse to drag 
and drop fields from table to table — and then double-click each 
table’s title bar to rename the tables.
•	If you want to create a new table, drag a field into any open space 
between or around the existing tables. The wizard will create a new 
table window containing the field. Double-click the new table’s title 
bar to rename the table.
Figure 22-4:  
The Table 
Analyzer 
makes its 
decision.


 Chapter 22: Analyze This!
9.	When you’re finished arranging and naming your tables, click Next.
The wizard automatically selects a key field for each table that it thinks 
needs a key field. Should the wizard select a field incorrectly as a key 
field, you can correct the error.
10.	If the wizard doesn’t designate a key field properly, you can
•	Designate an existing field as a key field by selecting the field and 
clicking the Set Unique Identifier button (looks like a key).
•	Change a key-field designation by selecting the proper key field and 
then clicking the Set Unique Identifier button (looks like a key).
•	Add a key field by clicking the Add Generated Key button (contains 
a plus sign and key).
11.	Click Next for the final step in the process.
The wizard offers to create a query that looks and acts like your original 
table. If you have reports and forms that work with the flat file, they’ll 
work with the new query.
At this point in the process, you may not see the last screen of the wizard 
as described in Step 12; the wizard may tell you that some of your data 
might be incorrect and that you should correct it. For example, if you 
have a Country field in your table and there are two entries such as USA 
and UAS, the wizard will ask you for — or suggest — a correction for the 
error. You definitely should correct this type of error. Unfortunately, I’ve 
found that the wizard is often not very good at identifying such errors. 
(It might suggest that you change Belgium to Brazil, for example.) My 
advice is to take a quick peek at the data for actual errors and move on — 
because the suggested “corrections” are often incorrect!
12.	Choose Yes to have the wizard create the query or No to skip query 
creation.
Choosing Yes creates a query that runs against the new tables. The 
query looks and acts like the original table. The original table is renamed 
with an _OLD slapped on the end, and any reports and forms use the 
query (rather than the original table) automatically. Choosing No gener-
ates the new tables but leaves the original table with its original name.
13.	Click Finish to exit the wizard.
The wizard completes the process of splitting the flat-file table into a set 
of relational tables.
The Table Analyzer is unlikely to split a flat-file database correctly into a prop-
erly designed relational database — especially if the flat file is complicated. 
You’re much better off bringing the database to a qualified human and letting 
her properly redesign it as a relational database — or figuring out how to do 
that yourself! For more information on proper table design, see Chapter 4.

Record Database Object Information 
with the Database Documenter
In the world of database development, the last thing on the to-do list — if it’s 
done at all — is database documentation. You’re probably asking yourself, 
“Why do I need to create a mountain of pages to tell me about my database?” 
Well, if you’re the developer of that database and something were to happen 
to you — say, you’re promoted or you leave the company — someone else 
would take over responsibility for the database, and be up a creek without a 
paddle. A well-documented database is easier to maintain than one that is not 
documented.
Why is this important step rarely done? Because it takes time and money — 
both of which are in short supply for most businesses. Enter the Database 
Documenter. It browses through everything in your database and records the 
minutest of details about each item, be it a table, field, form, query, or report. 
The Database Documenter collects information so obscure that the program-
mers might not know what some of it means.
If you think the Documenter will create a nice user guide for your database 
end user, unfortunately, you’ve thought wrong! The Documenter records infor-
mation helpful to the developer should the database need to be re-created. 
However, you’ll still need to create end-user documentation the old-fashioned 
way — manually.
The Database Documenter is fast and easy. All you have to do is turn it on, 
and it does the rest. Before you know it, the timely and costly job is done!
Here’s how to document your database:
1.	Open your database and select the Database Tools tab.
The Analyze group appears on the Ribbon.
2.	Click the Database Documenter button in the Analyze button group.
The Documenter dialog box appears.
3.	In the Documenter dialog box, click the All Object Types tab, as 
shown in Figure 22-5.
4.	Click the Select All button to document every object in your database, 
and then click OK to start the process.
The Documenter begins by examining all the objects in your database, 
starting with the tables and moving on to the queries, forms, reports, 
and so on.

377

 Chapter 22: Analyze This!
The process can take a while, depending on the size and complexity­ of the 
database you’re documenting. So you might want to run the Documenter 
before a coffee or lunch break. There’s nothing more satisfying than 
“working” on a break. When the Documenter finishes, it creates a lengthy 
report about your database, as shown in Figure 22‑6.
5.	Click the Print button on the Ribbon to get a paper copy.
Access doesn’t care a whit about trees or how much paper costs, so it 
generates hundreds of documentation pages about your database. For a 
small to mid-size database, this can be 500 to 1,000 pages of information. 
If you really want everything documented, and don’t want a couple of 
reams of paper describing your database, consider saving the report and

All Object 
Types tab 
and then

then referring back to it later. To store the report electronically, right-
click the report while it is in Print Preview and choose Export  ➪  PDF or 
XPS. Select the destination folder and type a filename; then click Publish. 
The resulting exported file can be opened in a PDF viewer such as Adobe 
Acrobat, when needed.
If you run the Documenter and find that it has generated too much detail, you 
can control what is documented — thereby reducing the detail (and number 
of pages) in the resulting report. The following instructions remove specified 
object properties (such as field properties like the Field Size property) from 
the Documenter’s report:
1.	From the Database Tools tab, click the Database Documenter button in 
the Analyze button group.
The Documenter window opens.
2.	Click the All Object Types tab.
3.	Click the Select All button.
Steps 2 and 3 tell the Documenter that you want to document all objects 
in the database.
4.	Repeat these steps for each object type (tables, queries, forms, reports, 
macros) in the Documenter window:
a.	Click the tab for the desired object type (like the Tables tab).
b.	Click the Options button in the Documenter window.
The Print Definition dialog box for the object selected will appear. 
(Figure 22‑7 shows the Print Table Definition dialog box.)
c.	Uncheck all the check boxes in the Include for <object type> section.
In the Print Table Definition dialog box, for example, this section 
will be labeled Include for Table.
d.	In the remaining Include For sections, select the second radio button — 
the one below Nothing (as illustrated in Figure 22-7).
In the Print Table Definition dialog box, for example, these sections 
are labeled Include for Fields and Include for Indexes.
e.	Click OK to close the Print Definition dialog box.
5.	Click OK in the Documenter window to start the documentation 
­process.

Improve Database Performance  
without Steroids
The Performance Analyzer is an Access tool that reviews each database 
object you designate and makes suggestions on how to improve the object’s 
performance. It might, for example, tell you to break up a complex form that 
loads slowly onscreen into several smaller forms that will load faster. Use the 
Performance Analyzer to (a) locate problem objects that are affecting data-
base performance and (b) improve those objects. This procedure, in turn, 
improves performance.
Like the Table Analyzer, the Performance Analyzer is far from perfect. When 
you run it (and you should), be sure to review its recommendations carefully 
before implementing them.
Here’s how to use the Performance Analyzer:
1.	Make sure all database objects (such as forms and reports) are closed 
so the only remaining window is the Navigation pane.
2.	Click the Database Tools tab on the Ribbon.
The Analyze button group appears.
3.	Click the Analyze Performance button from the Analyze button group.
The Performance Analyzer dialog box appears.
4.	Choose the database objects (such as forms and reports) that you want 
to analyze.
I recommend clicking the All Object Types tab and then clicking the 
Select All button. The Performance Analyzer dialog box is similar to the 
Documenter dialog box (refer to Figure 22‑5).
Figure 22-7:  
The Print 
Table

5.	Click OK to run the Performance Analyzer.
You’ll see a dialog box flash onscreen, listing each database object as it’s 
analyzed. Eventually, the results of the analysis appear in a dialog box. If 
the Performance Analyzer has no suggestions, you can skip Steps 6 and 
7, congratulate yourself for your superior database design skills, and 
then move directly to Step 8.
6.	Select each result (as shown in Figure 22-8) and review the comments.
If Access can make the changes for you, the Optimize button is enabled. 
Otherwise, use a pencil and paper and jot down any good thoughts that 
Access may offer. Sadly, Access does not provide a way to print the 
Performance Analyzer’s results — hence, the pencil and paper.
7.	To implement a task from the results list, select it and click the 
Optimize button.
The Optimize button won’t be available for all recommendations — only 
for those tasks that Access can implement.
After Access performs the task, a blue check mark appears next to the 
task on the list.
8.	When you’ve completed your review of the Analyzer’s suggestions, 
click Close to exit the Performance Analyzer dialog box.
If you’re not sure that a result should be implemented, don’t implement 
it. Ask your local Access expert for his opinion before implementing 
such a result.

f you plan for others to use your database, you may want to provide them 
with navigation tools so they can easily find their way around your data-
base (especially if they know nothing about Access). You may even want this 
luxury for yourself. It’s much easier to move around a database with a naviga-
tion system in place. Fortunately, the Navigation form provided with Access 
2016 makes it easy to build such a system. The form uses a familiar web-type 
interface to view various database objects. This chapter explains all there is 
to know about making your database user-friendly via the Navigation form.
To see a Navigation form in action, download the sample files at www.
dummies.com/go/access2016. Open the file Access 2016 Dummies.
accdb and open the NavigationForm form. And no, you’re not seeing double!
The Comings and Goings  
of a Navigation Form
Before you create your Navigation form, take a few minutes to plan out your 
database navigation. How do you want you and your users to navigate to the 
various forms and reports you’ve created? Access provides several layouts 
for Navigation forms; which one you choose depends on what you need:
✓
✓If you have a simple database with a few data-entry forms and sev-
eral reports, use one of the simpler layouts such as the Vertical Tabs, 
Left layout.

382
Part VI: More Power to You 
✓
✓If your database is more complex, you may need to categorize forms and 
reports. Use a multilevel layout such as the Horizontal Tabs and Vertical 
Tabs, Left layout.
For example, you might have a series of sales reports and a series of 
inventory reports. You may want two tabs across the top of your form — 
one for each series of reports. When you click a tab across the top, the 
associated reports for that tab show up down the left side of the form.
This multilevel scheme can make the object you (and your users) are 
looking for easier to find.
Whatever you decide, you can always modify the design of your Navigation 
form at any time. (I discuss Navigation form editing later in the chapter.)
Here’s how you build a Navigation form:
1.	Open the database file that will contain the Navigation form.
2.	Click the Create tab on the Ribbon.
The Forms group appears toward the center of the Ribbon.
3.	Click the Navigation button on the right side of the Forms group.
A drop-down list of Navigation layouts appears, as shown in Figure 23‑1.
4.	Select a layout from the drop-down list.
The selected Navigation form appears in Layout view, ready for design. 
(See Figure 23‑2.)
5.	Show the Navigation pane, if necessary. (If you don’t see it, press the 
F11 key.)
Your database objects appear.
Don’t confuse the Navigation form with the Navigation pane. The former 
is a special type of form that you create from a command on the Ribbon; 
the latter is the built-in window that displays your database objects.
6.	From the Navigation pane, drag an object that you want your users to 
open on top of an [Add New] tab on the Navigation form.
The object’s name appears in place of the Add New tab; the object itself 
appears in the middle of the form. (See Figure 23‑3 for an example.)
7.	Repeat Step 6 for each object you’d like added to the Navigation form.
8.	Save the form using the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar.
The form will appear in the Navigation pane along with all other data-
base forms. (See “Displaying the Navigation Form at Startup,” later in 
this chapter, for instructions on launching the form automatically when 
the database opens.)

Part VI: More Power to You 
If you find your Navigation form filling up because of the many forms and 
reports you have, you can create several Navigation forms — and have one 
Navigation form call another. It’s not that unusual; I’ve created databases 
containing well over 50 reports. In this instance, I might create a Reports 
Navigation form and call it from the main Navigation form. Just take care to 
arrange your forms and reports in a way that makes intuitive sense.
Am I in the Right Place? 
Testing Navigation Forms
After you’ve created your Navigation form, be sure to test it before turning 
your database loose on your users. You’ll want to test for two qualities:
✓
✓The legitimacy of the commands you’ve added. Can you navigate to each 
form and report you’d like your users to see?
✓
✓The intuitive usability of your Navigation form. Is it easy to find 
everything?

 Chapter 23: Steer Users in the Right Direction with Navigation Forms
Put yourself in the shoes of someone who knows nothing about Access. 
Could you figure out how to run a report or enter a new volunteer with your 
Navigation form? If the answer is no, then you’d better make some modifica-
tions. If the answer is yes, then sit back and crack open a nice cool drink!
Present your database to someone who knows nothing about Access. See if 
your “tester” can perform the basic tasks you’d like your users to perform — 
without any special instructions. Use your tester’s feedback to tweak your 
Navigation form if necessary.
Of course, to do any testing, you’ll want to see the form as your users will. 
Here’s how:
1.	From the Navigation pane, double-click your Navigation form.
Your Navigation form opens in Form view. Figure 23‑4 shows a sample 
horizontal and vertical tab Navigation form.
2.	Click a tab button to launch one of your forms or reports.
The form or report signified by the tab label should run. If it does, then 
you’ve done everything right! If it doesn’t, you need to make some 
­modifications — which are discussed in the next section.
3.	Repeat Step 2 for every tab you’ve created.
If everything checks out, your Navigation form is ready for launch.

Maintaining the Navigation Form
Almost without fail, a Navigation form will need modifications. You may (for 
example) have to tweak that form to:
✓
✓Correct mistakes or omissions made during initial Navigation 
form creation.
✓
✓Open new database objects (such as a new report).
See the “The Comings and Goings of a Navigation Form” section, earlier in 
the chapter, for more on creating Navigation forms. Let’s just concentrate on 
editing, deleting, and moving items here.
Edit a Navigation form item
If a tab is misspelled or does not perform the expected command, you need 
to know how to fix that command. If the form title is mislabeled, you can fix 
that as well. Here’s how:
1.	Show the Navigation pane, if necessary.
The Navigation pane appears, showing a list of all database objects.
2.	Right-click the Navigation form you’d like to edit from the Navigation 
pane and choose Layout View from the resulting shortcut menu.
The selected Navigation form opens in Layout view.
3.	To edit the Navigation form or tab name, double-click in the 
Navigation Form Name or Tab Name box and make your edits.
4.	Click Save on the Quick Access Toolbar to save your edits.
Delete a Navigation Form tab item
If a Navigation Form tab is no longer needed, it’s a snap to send that crit-
ter packing.
Here are the steps for deleting a Navigation Form tab:
1.	Show the Navigation pane, if necessary.
2.	Right-click the Navigation form you’d like to edit from the Navigation 
pane and choose Layout View from the resulting shortcut menu.
The selected Navigation form opens in Layout view.

387

 Chapter 23: Steer Users in the Right Direction with Navigation Forms
3.	Select the tab you’d like to delete by clicking it.
A thick border will appear around the tab.
4.	Press the Delete key on the keyboard.
The tab and its corresponding form or report are removed from the 
Navigation form.
5.	Click Save on the Quick Access Toolbar to save your changes.
Move a Navigation form item
If the tab order on a Navigation form is not quite right, it’s easy to rearrange 
the tabs. You can move items up or down on a vertical set of tabs and left 
or right on a horizontal set to put them in whatever order you like. So let’s 
get moving!
1.	Show the Navigation pane, if necessary.
2.	Right-click the Navigation form you’d like to edit from the Navigation 
pane and choose Layout View from the resulting shortcut menu.
The selected Navigation form opens in Layout view.
3.	Select the tab you’d like to move by clicking it.
A thick border appears around the tab.
4.	Drag the selected tab into its new location.
A vertical or horizontal bar (depending on the orientation of the tabs) 
follows the tab as you drag.
5.	Release the mouse button when your tab has reached its new home.
The tab moves into its new position.
6.	Click Save on the Quick Access Toolbar to save your changes.
Displaying the Navigation 
Form at Startup
The last step in implementing a Navigation form is to have that Navigation 
form open when the database opens. Your users might find it inconvenient to 
have to locate the Navigation form and open it themselves, wouldn’t you say?

So you’ll have to do it for them — automatically. Does this sound too good to

es, even so-called “experts” have problems with computers. I’ve chosen 
ten of the most common Microsoft Access problems and presented 
them to you in this chapter — with their solutions, of course!
Don’t give up hope if your problem is not on this list. I find many solutions to 
my computing problems by searching online. Chances are, if you’re having 
the problem, someone else has already had it and figured out the solution. 
That’s why the Internet is a valuable resource. The Appendix at the back of 
this book lists a few more valuable help resources.
Speaking of valuable resources, check out the ten problems in this chapter.
That’s Just Not Normal
One of the hardest things to do (yet most important when building a data-
base) is building the table structures properly. This process is known as nor-
malization. A properly normalized database should never have just one table 
containing redundant information. Consider the following table:
Customer
Address
City
State
Zip
Telephone
Jones
125 Main Street
Jonestown
NJ
08000
609-555-1244
Jones
125 Main Street
Jonestown
NJ
08000
609-555-7890
Smith
1542 Jones Hwy
Laramie
WY
82051
307-555-5412
Wilson
78 Smith Circle
Jones
CA
90000
451-555-8645

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Do you see the redundant information? Right you are. It’s the customer name 
and address. What is causing the redundancy? Right again! It’s the two phone 
numbers for customer Jones. The correct way to normalize this table would 
be to split it into two tables — one for customer name and address informa-
tion and the second for phone numbers. This would eliminate the need to 
repeat the second Jones record in the Customers table. For more on normal-
ization, see Chapter 4.
If you’re having trouble normalizing empty tables, fill each table with five to 
ten records. Viewing the tables with data usually makes it easier to spot nor-
malizing issues.
Here’s how to get started normalizing your tables:
1.	Examine each table as it is currently structured.
Are you repeating any information unnecessarily (as you saw with the 
address and customer name earlier)?
2.	If you have duplicate information, determine why you’re repeating it 
(for example, the multiple phone numbers for one customer).
3.	Break the one table into two tables to eliminate the redundancy.
4.	Repeat Steps 1–3 for each table until all redundancy is eliminated.
You may find that splitting one table into two still does not eliminate all 
redundancy in a table. In that case, keep splitting the tables until all redun-
dancy is gone.
You Type 73.725, but It Changes to 74
Automatic rounding can frustrate the living daylights out of you, but correct-
ing it is easy. By default, Access sets all number fields to accept long integers. 
As you may remember from your high school math days, an integer is a nega-
tive or positive whole number. To accommodate decimals, you change the 
field-size setting so it accepts decimals. Here’s how:
1.	Open the table in Design view and then click the field that’s not 
­cooperating.
2.	On the General tab of the Properties area at the bottom of the screen, 
click the Field Size box.
3.	Click the down arrow at the end of the box, and then select Single, 
Double, or Decimal from the drop-down menu that appears.
4.	Save the table, and your automatic rounding problem is over.

395

 Chapter 24: Ten Common Problems
For details about the difference between Single, Double, and Decimal field 
sizes, press the F1 key while in the Field Size property box. The Help screen 
gives a detailed description of each field size, the numbers it will hold, and 
the amount of space reserved for that size. Access requires an Internet con-
nection to use its help system.
The Words They Are A-Changing
Sometimes those “helpful” features in Access can become a nuisance. One 
such feature is called AutoCorrect. You may be familiar with it from Microsoft 
Word, where it is often a great thing. Databases, however, often contain acro-
nyms, part numbers, and the like. AutoCorrect can have a field day with such 
“words.” You may not even realize it as you enter your data.
You have two choices to resolve this problem.
✓
✓Undo AutoCorrect’s effects as they occur. Press Ctrl+Z right after 
AutoCorrect has botched your data entry. Access puts the data back to 
the way you typed it. Unfortunately, for this to work you actually have to 
notice that Access has changed what you entered.
✓
✓Turn AutoCorrect off entirely. To turn off AutoCorrect, follow 
these steps:
1.	Click the File tab in the upper left corner of the Access screen.
2.	Click the Options button in the menu down the left side of the screen.
The Access Options dialog box appears.
3.	Click Proofing from the list on the left.
Your proofing choices appear.
4.	Click the AutoCorrect Options button.
The AutoCorrect dialog box appears.
5.	Uncheck some or all of the check boxes in the AutoCorrect 
dialog box.
You can disable some or all of the AutoCorrect features, depending 
on what AutoCorrect is doing to annoy you at present. Uncheck 
the Replace Text as You Type option if you no longer want Access 
to “fix” your “spelling errors” for you.
6.	Click OK two times to save your changes.
You can now type your problem text correctly, without 
AutoCorrect’s interference, and have it stay as you typed it.

Was There and Now It’s Gone
You might’ve heard this one a lot over the years: “The database deleted my 
record!” Well, I’ve got news for you: The database doesn’t do anything with-
out us humans commanding it. And humans can make a couple of mistakes:
✓
✓Accidental deletion: There are several ways to delete a record acciden-
tally. Usually a keyboard shortcut for Delete is pressed, such as Ctrl+ – 
(delete record) or Ctrl+X (cut).
The Undo command (Ctrl+Z) will not reverse the deletion of a record.
✓
✓Data error: A record may appear deleted if someone inadvertently 
changes a particularly vital piece of information. For example, suppose 
the record in question contains an order date of 12/15/16, and someone 
inadvertently changes the date to 12/15/06. The order date isn’t what’s 
expected, so the record may seem to have been deleted.
If a data error makes the record seem deleted, there are several possible 
fixes, as outlined in the following sections.
Undo
Don’t panic. Before doing anything else, press Ctrl+Z. That’s the Undo command. 
If the record comes back, you’re in luck. Undo reverses data-entry errors that 
may cause the record to appear deleted. However, this will work only if you 
Undo right after the data-entry error takes place.
Search for the missing record
If you try the Undo command and the record doesn’t come back, there’s still 
a chance that a data-entry error is hiding it by putting it where you don’t 
expect it to be. Open the table that contained the record and search for it in 
some way other than you normally would. Look for anything out of the ordi-
nary on similar records. Here are some examples:
✓
✓If you normally search for orders by date, search by client. See whether 
an order similar to the missing one exists for that client and has an 
unusual date (say, the same month and day as the missing order but 
with the wrong year).
✓
✓Try looking at all orders on the date in question to see whether the 
client on each order seems to be correct. It could be that the client was 
changed inadvertently on the missing order.

397

 Chapter 24: Ten Common Problems
Backup recovery
If you can’t find the record anywhere, copy the record from a backup of the 
database file.
This solution works only if you’ve backed up your database since the record 
was originally added. If you back up at night and the record was entered 
during the same day it went missing, that record will not be in your backup.
You Run a Query, but the Results  
Aren’t What You Expect
Query-writing is an art form. Even the experts spill their paint every now and 
then. Here are some common solutions to unexpected query results:
✓
✓Check criteria for accuracy. A single misplaced keystroke is all it takes 
to turn your query into a dud. Check your criteria for spelling or syntax 
errors — and then run the query again.
✓
✓Try the Unique Values property. Ever see two copies of each record in 
your query results when you were expecting just one? A quick fix often 
comes from using the Unique Values property. This property tells Access 
to stop with the doubling, already — and, if the query results contain a 
group of exact duplicates, to return only one row from the group. Here’s 
how to use this property:
1.	Open the problem query in Design view.
The Design tab on the Ribbon appears.
2.	Click the Property Sheet button from the tab’s Show/Hide 
Ribbon group.
The Property Sheet window opens to the right of the query grid.
3.	Click in the gray area between the field lists in the top half of the 
query grid.
The Property Sheet should now display Query Properties. (Look 
right under the Property Sheet’s title bar to confirm this.)
4.	Click in the Unique Values row of the Property Sheet.
A drop-down list arrow appears at the end of the Unique 
Values row.
5.	Select Yes from the drop-down list and run the query.
The doubling should disappear.

398
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
✓
✓Correct the selection logic. Juggling a bunch of AND and OR connections 
in a query can quickly mess up even the hardiest of database designers. 
Chapter 14 has tips on untangling the mess.
✓
✓Fix table joins. If your query results show way too many records, and 
the query uses two or more tables, improper joining is the likely cause. 
Flip back to Chapter 5 for more about joining one table to another.
✓
✓Check table join types. If your query involves two or more tables, and 
you get fewer records than you expected, incorrect table joins are the 
likely cause. For example, if you have an order entry database and run 
a query listing all customers and their orders, by default, you’ll see 
only those customers who have placed an order. To see all customers, 
whether or not they’ve placed orders, do the following:
1.	In Design view, right-click the join (the line connecting the two 
tables) and choose Join Properties from the menu that appears.
2.	Examine the types of joins offered and choose the one that says 
something like “Include ALL records from ‘Customers’ and only those 
records from ‘Orders’ where the joined fields are equal.”
The actual text you see differs according to the names of your 
tables. To query aficionados, this is called an outer join. Very cool.
3.	Click OK and run the query.
You should now have all records from the Customers table whether 
or not there are corresponding records in the Orders table.
✓
✓If your query involves several criteria, some calculated fields, and 
numerous joins, try breaking the task into several smaller steps instead 
of trying to solve the problem all at once. The step-by-step approach lets 
you focus on each piece, one at a time, making sure each works perfectly 
before moving on to the next one.
If your query still doesn’t work no matter what you do, ask someone else to 
take a look. I’ve often worked on a tough query problem for hours, shown 
it to someone else, and heard those magical words: “That’s simple. Just do 
this.” And the problem is solved. Getting a fresh pair of eyes on the problem 
often solves things fast.
The Dreaded Parameter Dialog Box
At some point, when opening a query, form, or report, you’ll see a Parameter 
dialog box when you don’t want to see a Parameter dialog box. Do you throw 
your hands in the air and curse the universe? Of course not!
Whenever you see a Parameter dialog box unexpectedly (you can set them 
on purpose — see Chapter 16 for details), it means that Access can’t find a 

399

 Chapter 24: Ten Common Problems
field referenced by either the form or report or the query behind the form or 
report. Say that the problem is with a report. To troubleshoot, start with the 
query behind the report. Open that query in Datasheet view and see if you get 
the parameter. If you do, what field is it asking for? That field is the one Access 
can’t find. So, switch the query to Design view and find the column with the 
field that Access can’t find. The problem field is usually a calculated field that 
references other fields. Is each field and table name spelled correctly? If not, 
correct the spelling errors. Is each field in the table it’s supposed to be in? For 
example, if your reference reads Orders.LastName and the LastName field 
is in the Customers table, correct the error by typing Customers.LastName.
If the query runs without a parameter, then the problem is on the report. So, 
open the report in Design view and check each control on the report that is 
bound to a field. If Access can’t find one of the fields the control is supposed 
to display, it’ll put a green triangle in the upper-left corner of the control. 
Check each one for the green triangle. If you find the green triangle, check the 
spelling of the field referenced by the control. For example, if the control is 
supposed to display LastName (no space) and the reference in the control 
says Last Name (space), then remove the space so that the control on the 
report matches the field name from the query. Also check the report’s under-
lying query to confirm the problem field is selected in the query.
The Slowest Database in Town
An Access database may end up on the shared drive of a business so it’s 
available to everyone who needs it. The problem with placing the entire 
Access database on the shared drive is that it often runs slowly on each 
user’s workstation (that’s a fancy word for an individual computer). The com-
plaints start rolling in, and you don’t know what to do.
The solution to this problem lies in splitting the Access database file into two 
separate files:
✓
✓Front end: Contains all the database objects except the tables.
The front end resides on the user workstation.
✓
✓Back end: Contains just the tables.
The back end resides on the shared server.
The front end is linked to tables in the back end. (See Chapter 9 for more 
on table linking.)
All you’re really sharing is the data — so the data is all that should go on the 
shared drive. By setting things up this way, the only information that must 
travel across the network is the data requested by the user. Such a setup dra-
matically speeds database performance.

400
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Splitting the dataset is not as hard as you might think. Access makes it a snap 
with the Database Splitter Wizard. Follow these steps to split your database:
1.	Back up the database you’d like to split.
If anything goes wrong (unlikely, but hey, you can never be too safe 
when it comes to data!), you can try again with the backup copy.
2.	If necessary, move the database you’d like to split to a folder on your 
shared drive.
This step allows the Database Splitter to set up table links properly for you.
3.	Open the database file you’d like to split from the shared folder.
Make sure you have a backup copy of this database before going any fur-
ther. Also make sure all database objects are closed.
4.	Click the Database Tools tab on the Ribbon.
The Move Data group appears on the Ribbon. It contains a button called 
Access Database.
5.	Click the Access Database button.
The Database Splitter Wizard dialog box appears.
6.	Click the Split Database button and let the wizard do its thing.
You will be prompted for a back-end database filename. Enter a name, sit 
back, and watch the fun unfold before your very eyes.
7.	Copy the front-end file (the original file you split) to each user’s 
­workstation.
Have the users open the file from their workstations — and see how they 
marvel at the improved speed of the database! You are a hero. Yea!!
Your Database File Is as Big as a Whale
As time goes by, you find your database file growing larger and larger. This is 
a result of deleting objects and records over time. If, for example, you create 
a query and then later delete it because it’s no longer needed, Access doesn’t 
automatically remove the space occupied by that query from the database 
file. The same is true for records. As you delete records from a table, the 
space that those records occupied in the database file remains. Eventually, 
the file can become four or five times the size required to hold the data and 
objects within it.
Why should you care if the file size increases? Here are two reasons:
✓
✓A smaller database file runs faster. Performance is a key component 
to happy database users. You want your forms to load quickly and your 
queries and reports to run as fast as possible.

401

 Chapter 24: Ten Common Problems
✓
✓A regularly compacted database is more stable. If the database is used 
often, compacting regularly helps keep file and table corruption from 
occurring.
The Compact and Repair command removes the excess. It is good practice to 
compact your database regularly (once a week is usually fine). Always com-
pact it after making any design changes. Here’s how:
1.	Open the bloated database and click the Database Tools tab on the 
Ribbon.
The Tools group appears at the very left of the Ribbon.
2.	Click the Compact and Repair Database button from the Tools group.
The status bar (lower right of your screen) displays a progress bar that 
notifies you of how the compact process is progressing. When the prog-
ress bar disappears, compacting is complete — and you’ll be left with a 
much trimmer (faster and more stable) database file. If you’ve split your 
database, don’t forget to compact both the front- and back-end files.
Want a database file to compact each time you close it? Follow these steps:
1.	Click the File tab on the Ribbon.
2.	Click the Access Options button in the menu bar down the left side of 
the screen.
The Access Options dialog box appears.
3.	Click Current Database from the list on the left.
Options for the current database appear.
4.	Check the Compact on Close check box.
5.	Click OK to save your changes.
6.	Click OK from the resulting message box.
7.	Close the database and note the lower-right status bar.
The database is compacting before it closes!
You Get a Mess When Importing  
Your Spreadsheet
It’s common practice to upgrade a collection of spreadsheets to an Access 
database after the spreadsheet solution no longer suits your needs. It’s 
also common to find the imported spreadsheet (now table) data in a state 

402
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
of disarray. The easiest way to solve this problem is by cleaning up the 
­spreadsheet before you import it. Here are a few tips for a tidy import:
✓
✓Double-check information coming from any spreadsheet program to 
be sure that it’s consistent and complete. Above all, make sure that all 
entries in each column (field) are the same data type (all numbers, all 
text, or all whatever).
✓
✓Remove any titles and blank rows from the top of the spreadsheet. An 
ideal spreadsheet for import will have field names (column headings) in 
row 1 and data starting in row 2.
✓
✓Make sure your spreadsheet column headings are short and unique so 
Access can easily translate them to field names during import.
We’re Sorry; Your Database  
File Is Corrupt
It started out as a day just like any other. However, on this day, you are get-
ting an error when you open the front end of your split Access database. You 
can’t seem to open any forms or reports. It’s funny how a few little messages 
can ruin your day. You start wondering if you backed up the data file last 
night and when the file was actually corrupted. Then you start wondering 
how you’ll get out of this mess.
Fear not. There is a simple solution to a corrupt database. Here are the steps:
1.	Browse to the folder that contains the back-end file.
2.	Double-click the file to open it.
Access will launch and attempt to repair the file. You should see a repair 
progress bar on the right part of the status bar. If all goes well, the 
file opens.
3.	Close the back-end data file.
4.	Reopen the front-end file and everything should be working normally.
If, after following the preceding directions, the corrupted file still doesn’t 
open, you have a serious problem that could take some effort to clean up. 
The next step is to resort to a backup copy of the database. Check what data 
is missing between the backup and your recollection of the corrupted file. 
Yes, you’ll have to reenter any missing data. Sorry!
If you don’t have a backup, all hope is not lost. You can buy software 
designed specifically to repair corrupted Access database files. Try searching 
the web for repair corrupt Microsoft Access database files. Make sure the soft-
ware works with Microsoft Access 2016.

echnical experts — the people who know Access inside and out — might 
be a little intimidating, but they’re important — and they (we?) in no way 
intend to intimidate. They’re important to average Access users because they 
provide invaluable advice, and they’re important to Access itself because 
they drive the way Microsoft continuously improves its products. These 
guys (and girls) are the people who test Office products before new versions 
are released to the public, and they’re the ones who write books (like this 
one and more advanced books for more advanced users) to help users of all 
levels make the most of the software.
So the people who develop databases for a living are an essential resource to 
the average user, to the “power user,” and to the software manufacturer as 
well. This chapter is a compilation of some of the best advice gathered from 
a long list of Access experts. Knowing they were offering suggestions for new 
users, they offered advice to fit your needs and help ensure that, after read-
ing this book, you really can use Access confidently and effectively. By the 
time you finish, you’ll have given your efforts the right amount of planning 
and organizing — and you’ll have solid plans for moving forward with your 
development and use of the databases you build with Access.
So here’s the sage advice — in ten quick bites.

404
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Document Everything as Though One Day 
You’ll be Questioned by the FBI
Don’t skimp on the time spent documenting your database. Why? Because 
you’ll be glad later on that you didn’t skimp. You’ll have all your plans, your 
general information, and all your ideas — those you acted on and those that 
remained on the drawing board — ready the next time you need to build a 
database. You’ll also have them to refer to when or if something goes wrong 
with your current database. You accidentally deleted a saved query? No 
problem. Refer to your documentation. Forgot how your tables were related? 
Check the documentation and rebuild the relationships. Need to explain to 
someone why or how you set something up? Refer to your notes and wow 
them with your forethought and careful consideration.
So what should this glorious documentation include? Well, everything. But 
here’s a list to get you started:
✓
✓General information about the database:
•	File locations (with specific network paths, not just drive letters)
•	Explanation of what the database does
•	Information on how it works
✓
✓Table layouts:
•	Include field names, sizes, contents, and sample contents.
•	If some of the data comes from esoteric or temporary sources (say, 
the shipping report that you always shred right after data entry), 
note that fact in the documentation.
✓
✓Summary of reports:
•	Report names
•	An explanation of the information on the report
•	A list of who gets a copy of the report when it’s printed
Jot down the job title and department in the documentation as well 
as the current person in the position.
If you need to run some queries before creating a report, document the 
process. (Better yet, get a friendly nerd to help you automate the work.)
✓
✓Queries and logic: For every query, provide a detailed explanation 
of how the query works, especially if it involves multiple tables or 
data sources outside Access (such as SQL tables or other big-time 
­information-storage areas).

405

 Chapter 25: Ten Uncommon Tips
✓
✓Answer the question “Why?”: As you document your database, 
focus on why your design works the way it works. Why do the queries 
use those particular tables? Why do the reports go to those people? 
Granted, if you work in a corporate environment, you may not know why 
the system works the way it does, but it never hurts to inquire.
✓
✓Disaster-recovery details:
•	The backup process and schedule
•	Where backup discs, external drives, or flash/thumb drives are 
located (you are making backups, right?)
•	What to do if the computer isn’t working
If your database runs an important business function — such as 
accounting, inventory, point-of-sale, or order entry — make sure that a 
manual process is in place to keep the business going if the computer 
breaks down — and remember to document the process!
If you need help with any of these items, ask someone! Whether you borrow 
someone from your Information Systems department or rent a computer 
geek, get the help you need. Treat your documentation like insurance — no 
business should run without it.
Every 6 to 12 months, review your documentation to see whether updates are 
needed. Documentation is useful only if it’s up to date and if someone other 
than you can understand it. Likewise, make sure you (or your counterparts 
in the department) know where the documentation is located. If you have an 
electronic version, keep it backed up and have a printout handy — ­something 
you’ll be glad you did if you or someone else attempts to recycle your data-
base parts using the Application Parts feature.
Keep Your Fields as Small as Possible
As you build tables, make your text fields the appropriate sizes for the data 
you keep in them. By default, Access sets up text (known as Short Text) fields 
to hold 255 characters — a pretty generous setting, particularly if the field 
holds measly two-letter state abbreviations.
A hundred or more extra spaces — that go unused in most text fields — 
wouldn’t seem like anything to lose sleep over, but multiply that space across 
a table with 100,000 customer addresses in it, and you end up with lots of 
megabytes of storage space that are very busy holding nothing.
Adjust the field size with the Field Size setting on the General tab in 
Design view.

406
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Use Number Fields for Real Numbers
Use number fields for numbers used in calculations, not for text pretending 
to be a number. Computers perceive a huge difference between the postal 
code 47999 and the number 47,999. The computer views a postal code as a 
series of characters that all happen to be digits, but the number is treated 
as an actual number that you can use for math and all kinds of other fun 
numeric stuff. The other reason a zip code isn’t a Number field? If you’re in 
the U.S. and using the zip+4 zip code layout, the dash that separates the main 
five digits of the zip code and the +4? That keeps the zip code from being 
a pure number, like a quantity on hand in an inventory table or the total 
number of students enrolled in a training center’s attendance table.
When choosing the type for a new field with numbers in it, ask yourself a 
simple question: Are you ever going to make a calculation or do anything 
math-related with that field?
✓
✓If you’ll calculate with the field, use a number type.
✓
✓If you won’t calculate with the field, store the field as short text.
Validate Your Data
Validations can help prevent bad data from getting close to your tables. 
Validations are easy to make, quick to set up, and ever-vigilant (even when 
you’re so tired you can’t see straight). If you aren’t using validations to 
protect the integrity of your database, you really should start. Flip back to 
Chapter 7 and have a look at the topic.
Use Understandable Names  
to Keep Things Simple
When building a table or creating a database, think about the database file, 
field, and table names you use:
✓
✓Will you remember what the names mean three months from now? Six 
months from now?
✓
✓Are the names intuitive enough that someone else can look at the table 
and figure out what it does, long after your knowledge of Access puts 
your career on the fast track?
Windows allows long filenames. Use them. You don’t need to get carried 
away, but now you have no excuse for a file called 16Q1bdg2. Using 2016 Q1 
Budget Rev 2 makes much more sense to everyone involved.

 Chapter 25: Ten Uncommon Tips
This becomes even more important as you start using the tools for putting 
your Access tables and databases online and sharing them via SharePoint — 
potentially you’re bringing millions of users “to the table.” Also, with the 
Application Parts feature, the components of your databases can be recycled 
to help speed the creation of a new database. You don’t want mysterious 
names for the parts of your database to spread to a new database — to 
create nightmarish mysteries there too — right?
Delete with Great Caution
Whenever you’re deleting field values from a table, make sure you’re killing 
the values in the right record — check again, and then only when you’re sure, 
delete the original. Even then, you can still do a quick Ctrl+Z and recover the 
pestiferous thing.
Why all the checking and double-checking? Because after you delete a field 
value and do anything else in the table, Access completely forgets about your 
old value. It’s gone, just as though it never existed. If you delete a record from 
a table, the record is really gone — because there is no Undo available for an 
entire record. If that record happened to be important and you didn’t have a 
current backup file when the record went away, you’re out of luck. Sorry!
Backup, Backup, Backup
Did I make that clear enough? Always keep a backup of your work! There’s no 
substitute for a current backup of your data — particularly if the data is vital 
to your personal or professional life. Effective strategies often include main-
taining backup copies at another location in case a disaster destroys your 
office, be it a home office or an office at your employer’s location.
If you’re thinking that you’ve never needed a backup before so why bother, 
think about floods. Think about newscasters saying that an area currently 
underwater has never flooded before. Picture people’s lives floating down the 
street. Whether you’re faced with a real disaster of hurricane proportions, a 
fire, or your computer’s hard drive deciding to die (and that does happen — 
even if it has never happened to you before), you’ll be much happier if you 
have a backup of your database.
Think, Think, and Think Again
You know the carpenter’s slogan, “Measure twice, cut once”? The same 
can be said for thinking when it comes to your database. Don’t just think 
about something, come to a quick conclusion, and then dive in. Wait, think 

408
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
it through again, and then maybe think about it a third time. Then draw 
a conclusion and begin acting on it. With all the power Access gives you, 
coupled with the capability to store thousands of records in your database, 
a relatively simple mistake can be quite costly because of the potential 
­ramifications in terms of data loss or an “un-undoable” action taken in error.
Get Organized and Stay Organized
Although the suggestions to get organized and to keep it simple may seem to 
be at odds, these two pieces of advice are really companions. Keeping things 
simple can often be a way to avoid the need for a lot of organization after the 
fact. Whereas you probably got tired of hearing your parents remind you that 
“there’s a place for everything, and everything in its place” (or if they were 
less poetic, “Clean your room!!!”), they were right.
If you keep your database organized, you’ll save yourself time and grief. A 
well-planned, well-organized table will be easier to query, report on, and 
include in a form. It’ll also sort and filter like lightning.
Yes, you can get too organized. In fact, overorganizing is altogether too easy. 
Temper your desire to organize by cultivating another passion: working 
with as few steps as possible. On your computer, limit the number of folders 
and subfolders you use — a maximum of five levels of folders is more than 
enough for just about anybody. If you go much beyond five levels, your orga-
nization starts bumping into your productivity (and nobody likes a productiv-
ity loss, least of all the people who come up with those silly little slogans for 
corporate feel-good posters).
There’s No Shame in Asking for Help
If you’re having trouble with something, swallow your ego and ask for help. 
Saying “I don’t know” — and then trying to find out about what you don’t 
yet know — holds no shame. This rule is especially important when you’re 
riding herd on thousands of records in a database. Small missteps quickly 
­magnify and multiply a small problem into a huge crisis. Ask for help before 
the ­situation becomes dire.
Not sure how to ask for help? Check the Appendix in this book. This little 
chapter offers you ways to get help through the installed Office suite, 
through Microsoft’s online help, and through third-party sources that offer 
help on the web 24/7. Crying “Uncle!” has never been easier.

e pause for a timely word from Laurie:
I admit it; I’m one of those people who likes to be prepared — for anything. 
My handbag contains all sorts of “But what if . . . ?” objects intended to 
help me out of just about any situation. I have a Swiss Army knife, a small 
flashlight, a mini sewing kit, hand sanitizer, lots of pens, paper, lip gloss 
(you don’t think pale lips are an emergency?), mints, and my phone. The 
most important item? Well, I’m tempted to say lip gloss, but this Appendix 
is about helping you find the help you need from Microsoft, so you can 
get answers to the questions (few though they may be) that we don’t deal 
with in this book. So, the most important item in my handbag is my phone, 
because it contains phone numbers and web bookmarks to help me get in 
touch with Microsoft when I need help with Windows or Office.
In addition to contacting Microsoft directly, we’ve found that it can also be 
faster and more effective to tap into various third‐party online sources for 
help (“those make up a lot of my bookmarked web pages,” adds Laurie). That’s 
because your situation isn’t likely to be unique (even though it probably feels 
that way) and will no doubt have been experienced by someone else. That 
said, every feature of the software is covered in the help found within the 
application and through Microsoft’s online help. Between those two and the 
third‐party sources, you’re bound to find the answer you seek.
Access 2016 For Dummies saves you from a lot of that searching. The informa‑
tion you need is probably found on the pages of this book, and at the very 
least, this book enables you to understand Access features well enough to 
find and grasp the more advanced assistance you may eventually need.

Access 2016 For Dummies 
Asking Access for Help
No matter where you are in Access, help is there, ready to give you tips, 
tricks, and answers to your questions.
Installed Help files
When you have questions, Access helps you to
✓
✓Navigate the (automatically installed) Access Help files.
✓
✓Find help at the Help database on the Microsoft website.
Asking the right questions
Access 2016 gives you two quick ways to ask for help at any time:
✓
✓Press F1 for context‐sensitive help on what you’re doing, or whatever’s 
going on at the time, in terms of the windows open, the tools in use, 
­displayed dialog boxes, and so on.
Context‐sensitive help tries to pick the most appropriate help articles 
for you, based on what you’re doing within the Access workspace at 
the time.
✓
✓Click the little question mark in the upper right corner of the Access 
window. This opens the Access Help window, shown in Figure A‑1.
Figure A‑1 shows the main Access Help window, including a Search box (to 
type any question or keyword) and sections entitled Popular Searches and 
Basics and Beyond.
Access‐ing Help Online
Access Help works best if your computer links 
to the Internet through an always‐on, high‐
speed connection such as Wi‐Fi, FIOS, cable, 
or a corporate network at the office. With those 
connections, the Access Help system can 
always find the best, most recent answers to 
your questions. Of course, if for some reason 
you aren’t online, you can always use the 
installed help that comes with Access — or 
use the phone to speak to an actual human 
being, using the contact numbers listed later in 
this Appendix.

411

 Appendix A: Getting Help
To use this little window, follow these simple steps:
1.	Click the Search box, shown in Figure A 1, and type a question, task, 
or keyword, such as Create a form.
This spawns a list of articles pertaining to creating forms, as shown in 
Figure A‑2.
2.	Click the link to the article that looks the most helpful, based on its 
title, and you’re on your way to the help you need.
If it turns out to not be the one that’s best for your needs, click the back 
button (the left‐pointing arrow to the left of the Search Help box), and 
you’re back to the list of articles where you can try a new one.

Access 2016 For Dummies 
Online Help
If you’re connected to the Internet, the world truly is your oyster — and you 
can find some pearls of wisdom out there if you’re willing to poke around, 
comb through mailing list postings, and read a lot of online content (some of 
which may or may not help).
The online world includes websites with “official” information from Microsoft 
and “unofficial” information from the global community of Access users. You’ll 
find it handy when you can’t find what you need through the installed Access 
Help files, or if you simply want to tap into a more diverse range of insights.
Of course, unofficial doesn’t mean inaccurate or unreliable, but rather that 
the sources are not representing or working for Microsoft when they offer 
their information. For example, the authors of this book, technically, are 
unofficial sources of information on Access, yet you (and the publishers) 
trust us to help you.
When you do go for unofficial sources of help, although much (if not most) of 
it is perfectly useful, accurate, and reliable, not all of it is. If the advice you’re 
about to take or the steps someone has suggested you follow will affect the 
data in your tables, it’s probably wise to back up your database before trying 
it. This little fail-safe procedure is probably a good idea even when you’re 
using official help sources. Not sure how to implement good backup proce‑
dures? Check Chapter 25.

Office.com
For the official sort of help that Microsoft can provide, you’ll find support 
areas for each of the Office applications on the Microsoft Office website. 
If you visit http://support.office.com and type Access 2016 in the Office 
Support box shown in Figure A‑3, and then follow the links that appear in 
response to that, one of them will surely be useful for your needs!
Search engines and other sites
More often than not, the unofficial Access help you find at sites other than 
Microsoft’s is helpful — and it’s often posted by people who’ve had the very 
problem you’re experiencing. Bona fide experts are out there, ready and 
waiting, and continuously updating their websites to provide lots of help to 
those willing to look for it. You’ll also find various user forums — for users 
of all levels — where regular folks have shared questions and answers, and 
these can be useful, too. Just Google (or Bing) your question, making sure to 
include “Access 2016” in the search terms, to prevent links pertaining to old 
versions of Access from coming up in the results. Happy hunting!

Who’s Our Next Caller?
Live technical support isn’t extinct. At the other end of your phone, a live 
person who works for Microsoft can answer just about any question when
✓
✓You can’t phrase your question to get the help you need from either 
installed or online help sources.
✓
✓The answer you find is either too basic or too far over your head.
Live help isn’t always free:
✓
✓Questions about basic installation are answered for free by Microsoft.
✓
✓If you want help with anything else, it’s gonna cost you.
Except for the line that answers basic sales questions, Microsoft live techni‑
cal support is available seven days a week, except holidays:
✓
✓Monday through Friday: 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (Pacific Time)
✓
✓Saturdays and Sundays: 6:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (Pacific Time)
The next section is your handy‐dandy Microsoft phone directory.
Voice calls
The cost and phone number to use when you want to speak with a Microsoft 
expert in the United States and Canada depends on what you need to know 
about Access.
For answers to any Access questions involving using the software (beyond 
simple questions such as, “How do I install Access?”), you can call the 
­following numbers:
Books are our friends
Whether you’re a new Internet user or a veteran, 
books can help you comprehend an application 
in a general way — and also serve as a reference 
for specific features, topics, and questions.
If the idea of using the Internet to get help is a bit 
daunting, kiss your scaredy‐cat days goodbye. 
Check out The Internet For Dummies, 14th 
Edition, by John Levine and Margaret Levine 
Young. You’ll feel much more comfortable with 
the whole process of searching the Internet, 
and you’ll find out stuff you never knew you 
didn’t know!

 Appendix A: Getting Help
In the U.S. & Canada: 800‐865‐9408
Australia: 800‐197‐503
United Kingdom: 0800‐032‐6417
According to their support site’s phone contact information, the above num‑
bers are good 24 hours a day. Bear in mind, however, that like most software 
companies, Microsoft would much rather people use online help instead of 
calling in to talk to a person. Phone numbers change, prompts for routing 
your call to the right support person may be cryptic or non‐existent — so be 
prepared for calling for support to be less than helpful.
Solutions from these numbers aren’t free, even though the initial call is. 
There are two ways to pay:
✓
✓A support contract from Microsoft (usually through your company).
✓
✓A flat fee per incident.
According to Microsoft, an “incident” is all the calls related to the same 
problem (or something close to that). If you call several times trying to 
solve the same problem, you pay for only one incident.
TDD/TT calls
If you are deaf or hearing‐impaired and have a TDD or TT modem, call this 
number for all questions about Access (and all other Microsoft products):
800‐892‐5234
Unless you (or your company) have a Microsoft support contract, TDD/TT 
help calls incur a fee per incident, just like the technical voice line.

About the Authors
Laurie Ulrich Fuller has been writing about and teaching people to use 
Microsoft Office for more than 20 years. She’s been there through every 
new version of Access as Office has evolved to meet the needs of users 
from all walks of life — from individuals to huge corporations, from grow-
ing businesses to non‐profit organizations.
In the meantime, Laurie has personally trained more than 20,000 people 
to make better, more creative use of their computers, has written and 
co‐written 30+ nationally published books on computers and software — 
including several titles on Microsoft Office. In the last few years, she’s also 
created several online training courses, teaching online students to use 
Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop.
Laurie’s own firm, Limehat & Company, offers training and educational 
materials as well as graphic design, marketing, promotions, and web‐
development services. She invites you to contact her with your Office-
related questions at help@limehat.com and to visit her website at www.
limehat.com.
Ken Cook has built and managed a successful computer consulting busi-
ness (now called Cook Software Solutions, LLC) since 1990. He began as a 
trainer — training numerous users (too many to count!) on a variety of soft-
ware packages — specializing in Microsoft Office. Currently he “dabbles in 
training” (specializing in online synchronous training), but his main focus 
is creating expert Microsoft Office solutions and Microsoft Access database 
solutions for Fortune 500 and small business clients.
Ken is also a published author on Microsoft Excel, having contributed 
chapters on macros and VBA to Special Edition: Using Excel 2000 and 
Special Edition: Using Excel 2002 published by Que. Ken also contributed 
Microsoft Access chapters to the book How to Do Everything with Office XP 
published by Osborne and coauthored the previous edition of this book: 
Access 2010 For Dummies published by Wiley.
Prior to his career in computers, Ken was a Product Manager for Prince 
Manufacturing, Inc. He is a graduate of Syracuse University with a bach-
elor’s degree in Marketing. He can be contacted through his website (www.
kcookpcbiz.com) or by email (mailto:ken@kcookpcbiz.com).
