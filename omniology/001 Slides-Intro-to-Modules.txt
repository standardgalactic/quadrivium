Python Modules
●
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements such as variables, 
functions, classes etc;
●
The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended; 
Exemple: automation.py is the file and automation is the module;
●
There isn’t a special syntax to create a module;
●
Python modules and packages are two mechanisms that facilitate modular programming;
●
Before using a module, we must import it !
Example:
>>> import math
>>> type(math)
<class 'module'>
>>> dir(math)
['__doc__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'acos', 'acosh',......]
>>> math.sqrt(2)
