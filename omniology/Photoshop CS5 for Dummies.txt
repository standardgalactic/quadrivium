About the Author
Peter Bauer is best known as the Help Desk Director for the National 
Association of Photoshop Professionals (NAPP), but he has also authored 
or co-authored more than a dozen books on Adobe Photoshop, Adobe 
Illustrator, computer graphics, and photography. Pete is also the host of 
video-training titles at Lynda.com, a contributing writer for Photoshop User 
and Layers magazines, and an award-winning ﬁ ne-art photographer. He 
appears regularly as a member of the Photoshop World Instructor Dream 
Team, hosting Help Desk Live! As NAPP Help Desk Director, Pete person-
ally answers thousands of e-mail questions annually about Photoshop and 
computer graphics. He has contributed to and assisted on such projects as 
feature ﬁ lm special effects and 3D, major book and magazine publications, 
award-winning Web sites, and ﬁ ne art exhibitions. He has taught computer 
graphics at the university level, serves as a computer graphics efﬁ ciency con-
sultant for a select corporate clientele, and shoots exclusive photographic 
portraiture. Pete’s prior careers have included bartending, theater, broadcast 
journalism, professional rodeo, business management, and military intelli-
gence interrogation. Pete and his wife, Professor Mary Ellen O’Connell, of the 
University of Notre Dame Law School, live in South Bend, Indiana.


Dedication
In the early years of Photoshop World, Robb Kerr’s work ethic and enthu-
siasm were inspirational. In later years, as Robb battled colon cancer, his 
spiritual faith and dedication to helping ﬁ nd a cure — despite the pain and 
suffering that he endured — raised the bar. To those like Robb, who suffer 
and serve, whether through illness or public and military service, I raise a 
salute! On behalf of those who beneﬁ t from your selﬂ essness, I thank you.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First, I’d like to thank Bob Woerner and Linda Morris and the rest of the 
superb crew at Wiley that put the book together. I’d also like to acknowledge 
Scott and Kalebra Kelby, Jean Kendra, Larry Becker, and Dave Moser of the 
National Association of Photoshop Professionals (NAPP), who make my pro-
fessional life what it is today. With their support, I’m the Help Desk Director 
for NAPP, and get to share my Photoshop knowledge with tens of thousands 
of NAPP members — and with you. I also thank my Help Desk colleagues 
Jeanne Rubbo and Rob Sylvan (who served as technical editor on this book) 
for their support during the development of this book.
Another great group from whom I continue to receive support are my col-
leagues on the Photoshop World Instructor Dream Team. If you haven’t been 
to Photoshop World, try to make it — soon. Rather than “Photoshop confer-
ence” think “Photoshop festival.” Where else can you see suits and slackers, 
side by side, savoring every single syllable? It’s more than just training and 
learning: It’s a truly intellectually invigorating environment.
As this book was being fi nalized, the great Hugo the bulldog was also coming 
to his end. His companionship and loyalty, both at home and in the studio, 
will be missed. As a last-minute model for a photo in a book, article, or 
tutorial, he couldn’t be beat! Of course, I also thank my wife, the wonder-
ful professor Mary Ellen O’Connell of the Notre Dame Law School, for her 
unwavering support during yet another book project.

Photoshop CS5 For Dummies 

Introduction
A
dobe Photoshop is one of the most important computer programs of 
our age. It’s made photo editing a commonplace thing, something for 
the everyperson. Still, Photoshop can be a scary thing (especially that first 
purchase price!), comprising a jungle of menus and panels and tools and 
options and shortcuts as well as a bewildering array of add-ons and plug-ins. 
And that’s why you’re holding this book in your hands. And why I wrote it. 
And why Wiley published it.
You want to make sense of Photoshop — or, at the very least, be able to work 
competently and efficiently in the program, accomplishing those tasks that 
need to get done. You want a reference that discusses how things work and 
what things do, not in a technogeek or encyclopedic manner, but rather as 
an experienced friend might explain something to you. Although step-by-step 
explanations are okay if they show how something works, you don’t need 
rote recipes that don’t apply to the work you do. You don’t mind discovering 
tricks, as long as they can be applied to your images and artwork in a produc-
tive, meaningful manner. You’re in the right place!
About This Book
This is a For Dummies book, and as such, it was produced with an eye toward 
you and your needs. From Day One, the goal has been to put into your hands 
the book that makes Photoshop understandable and useable. You won’t find 
a technical explanation of every option for every tool in every situation, but 
rather a concise explanation of those parts of Photoshop you’re most likely 
to need. If you happen to be a medical researcher working toward a cure for 
cancer, your Photoshop requirements might be substantially more specific 
than what you’ll find covered here. But for the overwhelming majority of the 
people who have access to Adobe Photoshop, this book provides the back-
ground needed to get your work done with Photoshop.
As I updated this book, I intentionally tried to strike a balance between the 
types of images with which you’re most likely to work and those visually 
stimulating (yet far less common) images of unusual subjects from faraway 
places. At no point in this book does flavor override foundation. When you 
need to see a practical example, that’s what I show you. I (and my editors) 
worked to ensure that each piece of artwork illustrates a technique and does 
so in a meaningful, nondistracting way for you.

Photoshop CS5 For Dummies 
You’ll see that I used mostly Apple computers in producing this book. That’s 
simply a matter of choice and convenience. You’ll also see (if you look 
closely) that I shoot mostly with Canon cameras and use Epson printers. 
That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t shoot with Nikon, or that you shouldn’t 
print with HP or Canon. If that’s what you have, if it’s what you’re comfort-
able with, and if it fulfills your needs, stick with it! You’ll also find that I men-
tion Wacom drawing tablets here and there (and devoted one of the final 
chapters to the subject). Does that mean you should have one? If you do any 
work that relies on precise cursor movement (like painting, dodging, burning, 
path creation and editing, cloning, healing, patching, or lassoing, just to name 
a few), then yes, I do recommend a Wacom Cintiq display or Intuos tablet. 
Next to more RAM and good color management, it’s the best investment just 
about any Photoshop user can make.
One additional note: If you’re brand new to digital imaging and computers, 
this probably isn’t the best place to start. I do indeed make certain assump-
tions about your level of computer knowledge (and, to a lesser degree, your 
knowledge of digital imaging). But if you know your File➪Open from your 
File➪Close and can find your lens cap with both hands, read Chapter 1, and 
you’ll have no problem with Photoshop CS5 For Dummies.
How This Book Is Organized
Photoshop CS5 For Dummies is primarily a reference book. As such, you can 
check the Table of Contents or the index for a specific subject, flip to those 
pages, and get the information you need. You can also start at the beginning 
and read cover to cover (just to make sure you don’t miss a single tip, tech-
nique, or joke). To give you an indication of the type of information in each 
chapter, I organized the book into parts. Here’s a quick look at what sort of 
content you can find in each part.
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training
The first set of chapters presents the basic operation of Photoshop, what you 
need to know to get around in the program, and the core process of getting 
images into Photoshop and back out again. If you’re new to digital imaging, 
and particularly unfamiliar with Photoshop, make sure to read Chapter 1 
through Chapter 3. If you’ve worked with Photoshop or another image-editing 
program and aren’t quite sure about the concept of resolution or which file 
formats are best for which purposes, don’t overlook Chapter 2. Chapter 4 is 
the meat and potatoes of Photoshop: scanning and downloading images from 
cameras, cropping to fit specific print and frame sizes, and printing or post-
ing your images on the Web. All in one nice, tidy package.

 Introduction
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images
In Chapters 5 through 9, you discover ideas and techniques for improving the 
appearance of your images. You read about tonality (the lightness and dark-
ness of the image), color correction (making the image’s color look natural), 
and making selections to isolate individual parts of your image for correction. 
Part II also includes a full chapter on the Raw file format for digital cameras — 
what it is, why it’s important, and how to determine whether it’s right for 
you. At the end of this part, I include a chapter on the most common prob-
lems in digital photos: red-eye, wrinkles, and unwanted objects. And, yes, 
that chapter includes what to do about those problems, too!
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop
The chapters in Part III take a walk on the creative side. Although not every-
one wants to use Photoshop as a digital painting program, everyone should 
understand how to get around in the complex and daunting Brush panel. 
Compositing images (making one picture from two or more), adding text 
(whether a simple copyright notice or an entire page), using paths, and 
adding layer styles are all valuable skills for just about all folks who work 
with Photoshop, even if they don’t consider their work to be “art.”
Part IV: Power Photoshop
The two chapters in Part IV are more specialized than the rest of the book. 
If you don’t work in a production environment (even regularly cropping to 
the same size for printing on your inkjet printer can count as production), 
you might not need to use Actions in Photoshop. But there’s far more to 
Chapter 16 than just Actions and scripting! It also shows you how you can 
use Adobe Bridge’s Output panel to create an on-screen presentation that 
anyone can view, generate a single page with small thumbnail images of all 
your photos, and save paper by printing multiple copies of a photo on a 
single sheet. Chapter 17 is a brief introduction to those features found only in 
Photoshop CS5 Extended. If you have Photoshop CS5 rather than Photoshop 
CS5 Extended, you might be interested in the highly technical, very complex 
scientific, technical, video, and 3D features. Or not.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The final part of this book, The Part of Tens, was both the easiest and most 
difficult section to prepare. It was easy because, well, the chapters are short. 
It was incredibly tough because it’s so hard to narrow any Photoshop-related 
list to just ten items. Photoshop is such a beautifully complex and deep pro-
gram that I had a very hard time (as you’ll read) restricting myself to just ten 
favorite tips and tricks, just ten reasons a Wacom tablet can be your best 
friend, and just ten things you need to know about high dynamic range (HDR) 
photography. But I did it. (More or less — beware of hidden tips and tricks!)

Photoshop CS5 For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
To save some space and maintain clarity, I use an arrow symbol as shorthand 
for Photoshop menu commands. I could write this:
Move the cursor onto the word Image at the top of your screen and 
press the mouse button. Continuing to press the mouse button, move 
the cursor downward to the word Adjustments. Still pressing the mouse 
button, move the cursor to the right and downward onto the words 
Shadow/Highlight. Release the mouse button.
But it makes more sense to write this:
Choose Shadow/Highlight from the Image➪Adjustments menu.
Or even to use this:
Choose the Image➪Adjustments➪Shadow/Highlight command.
You’ll also note that I include keyboard shortcuts (when applicable) for both 
Mac and Windows. Generally the shortcuts are together, with Mac always 
first, and look like this:
Move the selection to a separate layer with the shortcut Ô+Shift+J/
Ctrl+Shift+J.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see icons in the margins as you read this book, icons that indicate 
something special. Here, without further ado, is the gallery:
 
This icon tells you I’m introducing a new feature, something just added to the 
program with Photoshop CS5. If you’re brand new to Photoshop yourself, you 
can ignore this icon — it’s all new to you. If you’re an experienced Photoshop 
user, take note.
 
When I have a little secret or shortcut to share with you — something that 
can make your life easier, smoother, more convenient — you see the Tip 
icon.
 
This icon doesn’t appear very often, but when it does, read carefully! I 
reserve the Warning icon for those things that can really mess up your 
day — things that can cause you to lose work by ruining your file or messing 
up Photoshop. If there were to be a quiz afterward, every Warning would be 
in the essay section!

5
 Introduction
 
The Remember icon shows you good-to-know stuff, things that are applicable 
in a number of different places in Photoshop, or things that can make your 
Photoshop life easier.
 
You might notice this icon in a place or two in the book. It’s not common 
because I exclude most of the highly technical background info: you know, 
the boring techno-geek concepts behind Photoshop.
How to Use This Book
This is a reference book, not a lesson-based workbook or a tips-and-tricks 
cookbook. When you have a question about how something in Photoshop 
works, flip to the Table of Contents or the index to find your spot. You cer-
tainly can read the chapters in order, cover to cover, to make sure that you 
get the most out of it. Nonetheless, keep this book handy while you work in 
Photoshop. (Reading cover to cover not only ensures that you find out the 
most about Photoshop, but it guarantees that you don’t miss a single cartoon 
or joke.)
Unless you’re borrowing a friend’s copy or you checked this book out of 
the library, I suggest you get comfortable with the thought of sticky notes 
and bent page corners. Photoshop is a very complex program — no one 
knows everything about Photoshop. And many concepts and techniques in 
Photoshop are hard to remember, especially if you don’t use them often. 
Bookmark those pages so they’re easy to find next time because you’re sure 
to be coming back time and again to Photoshop CS5 For Dummies.

A
 solid understanding of certain basic con-
cepts and techniques makes learning 
Photoshop much easier. Heck, it’s difﬁ cult to 
understand a discussion of feathered selections 
when you don’t know your pixels from a hole in 
the ground, right?
In Chapter 1, I introduce you to Adobe Photoshop. 
Chapter 2 focuses on the basic concepts of digital 
imaging and offers a look at the primary ﬁ le for-
mats in which you save Photoshop images. 
Chapter 3 makes sure we’re all reading from the 
same menu as we discuss Photoshop’s various 
commands, tools, and features — and provides 
some critical trouble-shooting procedures. Finally, 
Chapter 4 covers bringing images into Photoshop 
from digital cameras or scanners, organizing those 
ﬁ les, and basic output through printing.

Welcome to Photoshop!
In This Chapter
▶ What Photoshop does very well, kind of well, and just sort of, well . . .
▶ What you need to know to work with Photoshop
▶ What you need to know about installing Photoshop
A
dobe Photoshop is, without question, the leading image-editing pro-
gram in the world. Photoshop has even become somewhat of a cultural 
icon. It’s not uncommon to hear Photoshop used as a verb (“That picture is 
obviously Photoshopped!”), and you’ll even see references to Photoshop in 
the daily comics and cartoon strips. And now you’re part of this whole gigan-
tic phenomenon called Photoshop.
Before I take you on this journey through the intricacies of 
Photoshop, I want to introduce you to Photoshop in a more 
general way. In this chapter, I tell you what Photoshop is 
designed to do, what it can do (although not as capably 
as job-specific software), and what you can get it to 
do if you try really, really hard. I also review some 
basic computer operation concepts and point out 
a couple of places where Photoshop is a little dif-
ferent than most other programs. At the end of 
the chapter, I have a few tips for you on installing 
Photoshop to ensure that it runs properly.
Exploring Adobe Photoshop
Photoshop is used for an incredible range of projects, from 
editing and correcting digital photos to preparing images for 
magazines and newspapers to creating graphics for the Web. You 
can also find Photoshop in the forensics departments of law-enforcement 
agencies, scientific labs and research facilities, and dental and medical 
offices, as well as in classrooms, offices, studios, and homes around the 
world. As the Help Desk Director for the National Association of Photoshop 
Professionals (NAPP), my team and I solve problems and provide solutions 

10
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
for Photoshop users from every corner of the computer graphics field and 
from every corner of the world. People are doing some pretty amazing things 
with Photoshop, many of which are so far from the program’s original roots 
that it boggles the mind!
What Photoshop is designed to do
Adobe Photoshop is an image-editing program. It’s designed to help you edit 
images — digital or digitized images, photographs, and otherwise. This is the 
core purpose of Photoshop. Over the years, Photoshop has grown and devel-
oped, adding features that supplement its basic operations. But at its heart, 
Photoshop is an image editor. At its most basic, Photoshop’s workflow goes 
something like this: You take a picture, you edit the picture, and you print 
the picture (as illustrated in Figure 1-1).
Figure 1-1: Basic Photoshop: Take photo, edit photo, print photo. Drink coffee (optional).
Whether captured with a digital camera, scanned into the computer, or 
created from scratch in Photoshop, your artwork consists of tiny squares of 
color, which are picture elements called pixels. (Pixels and the nature of digital 
imaging are explored in depth in Chapter 2.) Photoshop is all about chang-
ing and adjusting the colors of those pixels — collectively, in groups, or one 
at a time — to make your artwork look precisely how you want it to look. 
(Photoshop, by the way, has no Good Taste or Quality Art filter. It’s up to you to 
decide what suits your artistic or personal vision and what meets your profes-
sional requirements.) Some very common Photoshop image-editing tasks are 
shown in Figure 1-2: namely, correcting red-eye and minimizing wrinkles (both 
discussed in Chapter 9); and compositing images (see Chapter 10).
 
It seems that every time a new version of Photoshop is released, it has 
at least one new feature that I just can’t wait to tell you about. Of all the 
great improvements in Photoshop CS5 (including 64-bit cross platform 
performance — more on that in a bit), perhaps the biggest Wow! factor is 
Content-Aware Fill. When you’re retouching and compositing, Content-Aware 
Fill can really help make your result look more natural and seamless. When 
you make a selection and press the Delete/Backspace key, the Fill dialog box 
pops up, offering you the opportunity to simply delete the content of the 

11
 Chapter 1: Welcome to Photoshop!
selection, fill with color, or use the Content-Aware option. Content-Aware Fill 
looks at the pixels surrounding the selection and tries (very successfully, in 
most cases) to match the colors, textures, and patterns. In Figure 1-3, com-
pare the original to the left, zoomed, and the full image, to the same views on 
the right, after content-aware filling of the selection. The Spot Healing Brush 
offers Content-Aware in the Options bar now, too!

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Over the past few updates, Photoshop has developed some rather power-
ful illustration capabilities to go with its digital-imaging power. Although 
Photoshop is still no substitute for Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop certainly 
can serve you well for smaller illustration projects. (Keep in mind that 
Photoshop is a raster art program — it works with pixels — and vector art-
work is only simulated in Photoshop.) Photoshop also has a very capable 
brush engine, including the new Mixer Brush tool, which makes it feasible 
to paint efficiently on your digital canvas. Figure 1-4 shows a comparison 
of raster artwork (the digital photo, left), vector artwork (the illustration, 
center), and digital painting (right). The three types of artwork can appear 
in a single image, too. (Simulating vector artwork with Photoshop’s shape 
layers is presented in Chapter 11, and you can read about painting with 
Photoshop in Chapter 14.)
Photoshop CS5 includes some basic features for creating Web graphics, 
including slicing and animations (but Web work is best done in a true Web 
development program, such as Dreamweaver). Photoshop’s companion pro-
gram Adobe Bridge even includes the Output panel to help you create entire 
Web sites to display your artwork online and PDF presentations for on-screen 
display, complete with transition effects between slides. (Read about Bridge’s 
Output panel’s capabilities in Chapter 16.)
Photoshop CS5 and Photoshop CS5 Extended
Adobe is once again offering two differ-
ent versions of Photoshop. Photoshop CS5 
and Photoshop CS5 Extended both have all 
of Photoshop’s powerful image-editing, vec-
tor-drawing, painting, and type capabilities. 
Photoshop CS5 Extended also includes some 
very specialized, highly technical features for 
use in science, research, and video editing, and 
for use with 3D modeling programs. (These fea-
tures are briefly introduced in Chapter 17.)
So, if you have Photoshop CS5 rather than 
Photoshop CS5 Extended, should you feel 
cheated or like a second-class citizen? Nope! 
Unless you specifically need those extended 
features, there’s no real reason to purchase 
them. But what if you got Photoshop CS5 
Extended as part of a Creative Suite or Adobe 
Bundle package of software — did you pay for 
something you don’t need? Well, sort-of-yeah-
but-not-really. The folks who’re really paying 
extra for the extended features are those who 
purchase Photoshop CS5 Extended as a stand-
alone program. The additional cost they pay 
funds the research and development of the 
extended features.
So why didn’t you get to choose between 
Photoshop CS5 and Photoshop CS5 Extended 
when you ordered your Bundle or Suite? Buying 
software shouldn’t be as complicated as, say, 
ordering a cup of coffee. (Caf, de-caf, half-caf? 
Latte, espresso, cappuccino? White, brown, 
or raw sugar? Cream, half-and-half, milk, or 
skim? Small, medium, large, super, or el grosso 
maxmo?) It could get quite confusing. Imagine 
trying to wade through all of the thousands of 
products if Adobe marketed every possible 
combination as a separate Bundle or Suite or 
Studio! You’d spend so much time trying to find 
your perfect bundle, you’d never get to use the 
software.

13
 Chapter 1: Welcome to Photoshop!
Figure 1-4: You can use Photoshop with raster images, vector artwork, and even to paint.
Other things you can do with Photoshop
Although Photoshop isn’t a page layout or illustration program, you certainly 
can produce simple brochures, posters, greeting cards, and the like using 
only Photoshop. One of the features that sets Photoshop apart from basic 
image editors is its powerful type engine, which can add, edit, format, and 
stylize text as capably as many word-processing programs. Photoshop even 
has a spell check feature — not bad for a program that’s designed to work 
with photos, eh?
Even if you don’t have the high-end video features found in Photoshop CS5 
Extended, you can certainly supplement your video-editing program with 
Photoshop CS5 (even if Photoshop can’t open and play movies you capture 
with your video camera). From Adobe Premiere (or other professional video 
programs), you can export a series of frames in the FilmStrip format, which 
you can open and edit in Photoshop.
If you don’t have specialized software
Admittedly, Photoshop CS5 just plain can’t do some things. It won’t make you 
a good cup of coffee. It can’t press your trousers. It doesn’t vacuum under the 
couch. It isn’t even a substitute for iTunes, Microsoft Excel, or TurboTax — it 
just doesn’t do those things.
However, there are a number of things for which Photoshop isn’t designed 
that you can do in a pinch. If you don’t have InDesign, you can still lay out 
the pages of a newsletter, magazine, or even a book, one page at a time. (With 
Bridge’s Output panel, you can even generate a multipage PDF document 
from your individual pages.) If you don’t have Dreamweaver or GoLive, you 
can use Photoshop to create a Web site, one page at a time, sliced and opti-
mized and even with animated GIFs. You also have tools that you can use to 
simulate 3D in Photoshop, such as Vanishing Point (see Chapter 10).

14
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Page layout in Photoshop isn’t particularly difficult for a one-page piece or 
even a trifold brochure. Photoshop has a very capable type engine, consider-
ing the program is designed to push pixels rather than play with paragraphs. 
Photoshop can even show you a sample of each typeface in the Font menu. 
Choose from five sizes of preview in Photoshop’s Preferences➪Type menu. 
However, you can’t link Photoshop’s type containers, so a substantial addi-
tion or subtraction at the top of the first column requires manually recom-
posing all of the following columns. After all, among the biggest advantages 
of a dedicated page layout program are the continuity (using a master page 
or layout) and flow from page to page. If you work with layout regularly, use 
InDesign.
Dreamweaver is a state-of-the-art Web design tool, with good interoperability 
with Photoshop. However, if you don’t have Dreamweaver and you desper-
ately need to create a Web page, Photoshop comes to your rescue. After 
laying out your page and creating your slices, use the Save for Web & Devices 
command to generate an HTML document (your Web page) and a folder filled 
with the images that form the page (see Figure 1-5). One of the advantages to 
creating a Web page in Dreamweaver rather than Photoshop is HTML text. 
(Using Photoshop, all the text on your Web pages is saved as graphic files. 
HTML text not only produces smaller Web pages for faster download, but it’s 
resizable in the Web browser.)
Figure 1-5: You can create an entire Web page in Photoshop.
Viewing Photoshop’s Parts and Processes
In many respects, Photoshop is just another computer program — you 
launch the program, open files, save files, and quit the program quite nor-
mally. Many common functions have common keyboard shortcuts. You 
enlarge, shrink, minimize, and close windows as you do in other programs.

15
 Chapter 1: Welcome to Photoshop!
Reviewing basic computer operations
Chapter 3 looks at Photoshop-specific aspects of working with floating 
panels, menus and submenus, and tools from the Options bar, but I want to 
take just a little time to review some fundamental computer concepts.
Launching Photoshop
You can launch Photoshop (start the program) by double-clicking an image 
file or through the Applications folder (Mac) or the Start menu (Windows). 
Mac users can drag the Photoshop program icon (the actual program itself) 
to the Dock to make it available for one-click startup. You can find the file 
named Adobe Photoshop CS5 inside the Adobe Photoshop CS5 folder, inside 
the main Applications folder. (Chapter 3 shows you the Photoshop interface 
and how to get around in the program.)
 
Never open an image into Photoshop from removable media (CD, DVD, your 
digital camera or its Flash card, Zip disks, jump drives, and the like) or from 
a network drive. Always copy the file to a local hard drive, open from that 
drive, save back to the drive, and then copy the file to its next destination. 
You can open from internal hard drives or external hard drives, but to avoid 
the risk of losing your work (or the entire image file) because of a problem 
reading from or writing to removable media, always copy to a local hard 
drive.
Working with images
Within Photoshop, you work with individual image files. Each image is 
recorded on the hard drive in a specific file format. Photoshop opens just 
about any current image file consisting of pixels as well as some file formats 
that do not. (File formats are discussed in Chapter 2.) Remember that to 
change a file’s format, you open the file in Photoshop and use the Save As 
command to create a new file. And, although theoretically not always neces-
sary on the Mac, I suggest that you always include the file extension at 
the end of the filename. If Photoshop won’t open an image, it might be in 
a file format that Photoshop can’t read. It cannot, for example, open an 
Excel spreadsheet or a Microsoft Word DOC file because those aren’t image 
formats — and Photoshop is, as you know, an image-editing program. If you 
have a brand-new digital camera and Photoshop won’t open its Raw images, 
check for an update to the Adobe Camera Raw plug-in at
www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html
You will find installation instructions for the update there. (Make sure to read 
and follow the installation instructions exactly.)

16
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Saving your files
You must use the Save or Save As command to preserve changes to your 
images. And after you save and close an image, those changes are irrevers-
ible. When working with an important image, consider these three tips:
 
✓ Work on a copy of the image file. Unless you’re working with a digital 
photo in the Raw format (discussed in Chapter 7), make a copy of your 
image file as a backup before changing it in Photoshop. The backup 
ensures that should something go horribly wrong, you can start over. 
(You never actually change a Raw photo — Photoshop can’t rewrite the 
original file — so you’re always, in effect, working on a copy.)
 
✓ Open as a Smart Object. Rather than choosing File➪Open, make it a 
habit to choose File➪Open As Smart Object. When working with Smart 
Objects, you can scale or transform multiple times without continually 
degrading the image quality, and you can work with Smart Filters, too!
 
✓ Save your work as PSD, too. Especially if your image has layers, save 
it in Photoshop’s PSD file format (complete with all the layers) before 
using Save As to create a final copy in another format. If you don’t save a 
copy with layers, going back to make one little change can cost hours of 
work.
If you attempt to close an image or 
quit Photoshop without saving your 
work first, you get a gentle reminder 
asking whether you want to save, 
close without saving, or cancel the 
close/quit (as shown in Figure 1-6).
Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts are custom-
izable in Photoshop (check out 
Chapter 3), but some of the basic 
shortcuts are the same as those you 
use in other programs. You open, 
copy, paste, save, close, and quit just 
as you do in Microsoft Word, your e-mail program, and just about any other 
software. I suggest that you keep these shortcuts unchanged, even if you do 
some other shortcut customization.
Photoshop’s incredible selective Undo
Here’s one major difference between Photoshop and other programs. Almost 
all programs have some form of Undo, enabling you to reverse the most 
Figure 1-6: Photoshop reminds you if you 
haven’t saved changes to an image.

17
 Chapter 1: Welcome to Photoshop!
recent command or action (or mistake). Like many programs, Photoshop 
uses the Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z shortcut for Undo/Redo and the Ô+Option+Z/Ctrl+Alt+Z 
shortcut for Step Backward, which allows you to undo a series of steps (but 
remember that you can change those shortcuts, as described in Chapter 3). 
Photoshop also has, however, a great feature that lets you partially undo.
You can use Photoshop’s History Brush to partially undo just about any 
filter, adjustment, or tool by painting. You select the History Brush, choose a 
history state (a stage in the image development) to which you want to revert, 
and then paint over areas of the image that you want to change back to the 
earlier state.
You can undo as far back in the editing process as you want, with a couple of 
limitations: The History panel (where you select the state to which you want 
to revert) holds only a limited number of history states. In the Photoshop 
Preferences➪General pane, you can specify how many states you want 
Photoshop to remember (to a maximum of 1,000). Keep in mind that storing 
lots of history states takes up computer memory that you might need for 
processing filters and adjustments. That can slow things down. The default 
of 20 history states is good for most projects, but when using painting tools 
or other procedures that involve lots of repetitive steps (such as touching 
up with the Dodge, Burn, or Clone Stamp tools), a larger number (perhaps as 
high as 60) is generally a better idea.
The second limitation is pixel dimensions. If you make changes to the image’s 
actual size (in pixels) with the Crop tool or the Image Size or Canvas Size 
commands, you cannot revert to prior steps with the History Brush. You 
can choose as a source any history state that comes after the image’s pixel 
dimensions change but none that come before.
Here’s one example of using the History Brush as a creative tool. You open 
a copy of a photograph in Photoshop. You edit as necessary. You use the 
Black and White adjustment on the image to make it appear to be grayscale. 
In the History panel, you click in the left column next to the step immediately 
prior to Black and White to designate that as the source state, the appearance 
of the image to which you want to revert. You select the History Brush and 
paint over specific areas of the image to return them to the original (color) 
appearance (see Figure 1-7). There you have it — a grayscale image with 
areas of color, compliments of the History Brush!

Installing Photoshop: Need to know
If you haven’t yet installed Photoshop CS5 (or the Adobe Creative Suite), here 
are a few points to keep in mind:
 
✓ Install only into the default location. Photoshop is a resource-intensive 
program. Installing it into the default location ([harddrive]➪Applications 
on a Mac and C:\Program Files for Windows) ensures that it has 
access to the operating system and hardware as necessary. Installing 
into any other location or attempting to run Photoshop across a net-
work can lead to frustrating problems and loss of work in progress.
 
✓ Disable all spyware and antivirus software before installing. Antivirus 
software can intercept certain installation procedures, deeming them 
to be hazardous to your computer’s health. That can lead to malfunc-
tions, crashes, lost work, frustration, and what I like to call Computer 
Flying Across Room Syndrome. If you use antivirus software (and if you 
use Windows, you’d better!), turn it off before installing any program, 
especially one as complex as Photoshop. You might find the antivirus 
program’s icon in the Windows taskbar; or you might need to go to the 

19
 Chapter 1: Welcome to Photoshop!
Start menu, use All Programs to locate the antivirus software, and dis-
able it. On Mac, check the Dock. And don’t forget to restart your antivirus 
software afterward! If you already installed Photoshop and antivirus 
software was running at the time, I urge you to uninstall and reinstall. 
(Reinsert the Photoshop CS5 DVD and launch the installer to use the 
built-in uninstall feature.)
 
✓ If you use auto-backup software, shut it down, too. It’s best not to run 
auto-backup software when installing software. Like antivirus software, 
it can also lead to problems by interfering with the installer.
 
✓ Connect to the Internet and activate right away. It’s also best to 
run the Photoshop installer while your computer is connected to the 
Internet. That enables Photoshop’s activation process to happen right 
away, making sure you can get started as soon as the installer finishes.
 
✓ Photoshop CS5 is 64-bit software (and 32-bit, too). On both Windows 
and Mac, Photoshop CS5 is a 64-bit program — if you have a 64-bit oper-
ating system. (Windows 7, Vista, and XP all offer 64-bit versions; the Mac 
OS became 64-bit with Snow Leopard, OS 10.6.) 64-bit software generally 
runs faster and can take advantage of much more RAM than 32-bit soft-
ware. However, in a 64-bit operating system, Photoshop CS5 also installs 
a 32-bit version. On Windows, it’s Photoshop CS5 (x86). On the Mac, 
you can right-click on the Adobe Photoshop CS5 program icon (inside 
the Applications➪Adobe Photoshop CS5 folder), select Get Info, and, in 
Photoshop’s Info box (shown in Figure 1-8), choose to run Photoshop as 
a 32-bit program the next time it starts up. Why might you want to run 
Photoshop as 32-bit software? You may have 32-bit plug-ins that won’t 
work with 64-bit Photoshop. Many third-party plug-ins (plug-ins pur-
chased from companies other than Adobe) and even some Adobe plug-
ins are not yet 64-bit capable. How do you know? Photoshop gives you a 
warning upon startup.
 
✓ If you have third-party plug-ins, install them elsewhere. Third-party 
plug-ins — those filters and other Photoshop add-ons that you buy from 
companies other than Adobe — can be installed into a folder outside 
the Photoshop folder. You can then make an alias (Mac) or shortcut 
(Windows) to that folder and drag the alias/shortcut to Photoshop’s 
Plug-Ins folder. (If you have a multibutton mouse, right-click the folder 
to create an alias/shortcut; Control+click if you’re using a one-button 
trackpad.) Why install outside the Photoshop folder? Should you ever 
need to (gasp!) reinstall Photoshop, you won’t need to reinstall all your 
third-party plug-ins. Just create a new alias/shortcut and move it into 
Photoshop’s new Plug-Ins folder. And don’t forget to go to the plug-ins’ 
Web sites to see if the manufacturers offer updates!

20
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Figure 1-8: 32-bit plug-ins don’t load into 64-bit Photoshop CS5.
 
✓ If you have lots of plug-ins, create sets. Plug-ins require RAM (computer 
memory that Photoshop uses to process your editing commands). If you 
have lots of plug-ins, consider dividing them into groups according to 
how and when you use them. Sort (or install) them into separate folders. 
(Hint: Plug-ins that you use in many situations can be installed into mul-
tiple folders.) When you need to load a specific set, do so through the 
Photoshop Preferences➪Plug-Ins pane by designating a second plug-ins 
folder and relaunching Photoshop.
 
✓ If you love fonts, use a font management utility. If you have hundreds 
of fonts (over the years, I’ve somehow managed to collect upward 
of 10,000 fonts), use a font-management utility to create sets of fonts 
according to style and activate only those sets that you need at any 
given time. Too many active fonts can choke the Photoshop type engine, 
slowing performance. The Mac OS has Font Book built right in, or 
you can use the excellent Suitcase Fusion 2 (Mac and Windows) from 
Extensis (www.extensis.com).

n the early days of photography, some less-advanced cultures viewed 
a photo with great suspicion and even fear. Was that an actual person, 
trapped in the paper? Did taking a photo steal a person’s soul? You know that 
a camera doesn’t trap anyone inside the paper — and you can be pretty sure 
about the stolen soul issue — but how much does the average 
shooter know about digital images? And how much do you 
need to know about digital images to work effectively in 
Photoshop?
The answers to those two questions are “Not as 
much as he/she should” and “Not as much as you 
might fear.” In this chapter, I give you some basic 
information about how digital images exist in 
Photoshop, a real understanding of that critical 
term resolution, and an overview of the different 
ways that you can save your images. But most 
importantly, I help you understand the very nature 
of digital images by explaining the world of pixels.
Welcome to the Philosophy Chapter!

22
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
What Exactly Is a Digital Image?
Whether you take a picture with a digital camera or use a scanner to bring 
a photo (or other artwork) into Photoshop, you are digitizing the image. 
That is, digit not as in a finger or toe, but as in a number. Computers do 
everything — absolutely everything — by processing numbers, and the 
basic language of computers is binary code. Whether it’s a photo of a Tahitian 
sunset, a client’s name in a database, or the latest box score on the Internet, 
your computer works on it in binary code. In a nutshell, binary code uses a 
series of zeros and ones (that’s where the numbers part comes into play) to 
record information. 
So what does binary code have to do 
with the wedding photos that you 
took this weekend or the master-
piece you must print for your thesis 
project? An image in Photoshop con-
sists of tiny squares of color called 
pixels (pixel is short for picture ele-
ment), as you can see in the close-up 
to the right in Figure 2-1. The com-
puter records and processes each 
pixel in binary code. These pixels 
replicate a photo the same way 
that tiles in a mosaic reproduce a 
painting.
A tile in a mosaic isn’t face or sky or grass; rather, it’s beige or blue or green. 
The tiles individually have no relationship to the image as a whole; rather, 
they require an association with the surrounding tiles to give them purpose, 
to make them part of the picture. Without the rest of the tiles, a single tile has 
no meaning.
Likewise, a single pixel in a digital image is simply a square of color. It 
doesn’t become a meaningful part of your digital image until it’s surrounded 
by other pixels of the same or different color, creating a unified whole — a 
comprehensible picture. How you manipulate those pixels, from the time you 
capture the image digitally until you output the image to paper or the Web, 
determines how successfully your pixels will represent your image, your art-
work, your dream.
The True Nature of Pixels
Here are some basic truths about pixels that you really need to know. 
Although reading this section probably can’t improve your love life, let 
you speak with ghosts, or give you the winning lottery number, it can help 
Figure 2-1: That’s not really Hugo the Bulldog; 
it’s a bunch of tiny, colored squares.

23
 Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
you understand what’s happening to your image as you work with it in 
Photoshop.
 
✓ Each pixel is independent. You might think that you see a car or a 
circle or a tree or Uncle Bob in an image, but the image is actually only 
a bunch of little colored squares. Although you can read about various 
ways to work with groups of pixels throughout this book, each pixel 
exists unto itself.
 
✓ Each pixel is square (except on TV). Really! Each pixel in a digital image 
is square except when you’re creating images for television, which uses 
nonsquare pixels. It’s important that you understand the squareness 
of pixels because you sometimes have to deal with those pointy little 
corners.
 
✓ Each pixel can be exactly one color. That color can change as you edit 
or alter the image, but each pixel consists entirely of a single color — 
there’s no such thing as a two-tone pixel. Figure 2-2, at 3,200 percent 
zoom, shows each pixel distinctly.
Figure 2-2: Each pixel is monotone, containing a single color throughout the pixel.
 
✓ Smaller is better (generally speaking). The smaller each pixel, the better 
the detail in an image. (However, when you are preparing images for the 
Web, you need smaller images that invariably have less detail.) If you cap-
ture an image of a house with a cellphone camera and capture the same 
shot with a professional DSLR (digital single-lens reflex camera — you 
know, one of the big professional cameras with interchangeable lenses) 
that captures six or seven or fifteen times as many pixels, it’s pretty 
obvious which image has better detail. Take a look at Figure 2-3, which 
illustrates how lots more smaller pixels present a better image than do 
fewer-and-larger pixels.
 
 Smaller pixels also help hide those nasty corners of pixels that are some-
times visible along curves and diagonal lines. When the corners of pixels 
are noticeable and degrade the image, you call it a bad case of the jaggies.

24
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Figure 2-3: More pixels (top) means better detail. Note the zoom factors in the lower-left of 
each shot.
 
Keep in mind that the size at which an image can be printed — and still look 
good — depends on the number of pixels available. Sure, these days every 
digital camera seems to capture at least 10 megapixels, which is fine for 8 x 10 
prints and perhaps even as large as 16 x 20 inches. But what about those cell-
phone shots? How about when your 10 megapixel pocket camera doesn’t have 
a long enough zoom to capture little Tommy’s exploits on the soccer field up 
close? That’s when you might need to crop and resample the image to increase 
the number of pixels. Resampling is discussed later in this chapter.
 
✓ Pixels are aligned in a raster. The term raster appears regularly when 
you discuss images created from pixels. Raster, in this case, refers to the 
nice orderly rows and columns in which pixels appear. Each image has 
a certain number of rows of pixels, and each row is a certain number of 
pixels wide — the columns. Within the raster, the pixels perfectly align 
side to side and top to bottom.
 
✓ Every picture created with pixels is rectangular. Some images might 
appear to be round, or star-shaped, or missing a hole from the middle, 

25
 Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
but they aren’t unless you print them out and grab your scissors. The 
image file itself is rectangular, even if it appears round. There are actu-
ally pixels in those seemingly empty areas; the pixels are, however, 
transparent.
How Many Pixels Can Dance 
on the Head of a Pin?
You hear the term resolution a lot when working with digital images. Digital 
cameras have so-many megapixels of resolution; inkjet printers have so-much 
by so-much resolution; to work in Photoshop CS5, your monitor must have 
a resolution of at least 1,024 x 768 pixels; when printing your images, you 
must use 300 pixels per inch (ppi) as your resolution (wrong!), but your Web 
images must have a resolution of 72 ppi (again wrong!); and don’t forget your 
New Year’s resolution!
Resolution revelations
In this wonderful world of digital imaging, you see resolution used in four 
basic ways:
 
✓ Image resolution: Image resolution is the size of your image’s individual 
pixels when you print. I go into greater detail about this concept in the 
upcoming section, “Picking an image resolution.”
 
✓ Camera resolution: Digital cameras capture each image in a specific 
number of pixels. Check your camera’s user guide or open one of the 
images in Photoshop and choose Image➪Image Size. Take a look at the 
number of pixels that your camera records for the width and for the 
height. Multiply the numbers together, divide by one million, and round 
off the result. (If you’re in the camera maker’s marketing department, 
make sure that you round up.) That’s the megapixel (MP) rating for the 
camera. Use it as a general guideline when shopping. If you’re still work-
ing with a camera that captures only 6 megapixels, you might want 
to consider upgrading to more fully take advantage of Photoshop’s 
capabilities.
 
✓ Monitor resolution: Monitor resolution determines how many pixels are 
visible on-screen. Whether you use a Mac or a PC, you set the monitor 
resolution at the system level (as shown in Figure 2-4). When you use a 
higher monitor resolution, you get a larger workspace, but each pixel 
is smaller, which might make some jobs tougher. Experiment to find a 
monitor resolution that works just right for you.

26
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Figure 2-4: Set a Mac’s resolution through the System Preferences (left), a PC’s resolution 
through the Control Panel (right).
 
• Mac: Click the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of the screen 
and choose System Preferences. Then click Displays. (Some Apple 
monitors have a button on the bezel that automatically opens the 
window for you.)
 
• Windows 7: Go to Control Panel➪Hardware and Sound, and then 
click on Adjust screen resolution.
 
✓ Printer resolution: Unlike the three preceding terms, printer resolution 
doesn’t involve pixels. Rather, a printer resolution tells you how many 
tiny droplets of ink are sprayed on the paper. Remember that it takes 
several droplets to reproduce a single image pixel — you certainly don’t 
need an image resolution anywhere close to the printer’s resolution! 
(See the following section for more on this.)
Resolving image resolution
Image resolution is nothing more than an instruction to a printing device 
about how large to reproduce each pixel. On-screen, when working in 
Photoshop, your image has no resolution at all. An image that’s 3,000 pixels 
wide and 2,400 pixels tall looks and acts exactly the same in Photoshop 
whether you have the image resolution at 300 ppi or 72 ppi. Same number 
of pixels, right? (The one real exception to this rule is type — text is usually 
measured in points in Photoshop, and that measurement is directly tied to 
the print size of your document. Type and text are discussed in Chapter 13.)

27
 Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
 
You can always check — or change — a picture’s resolution by choosing 
Photoshop Image➪Image Size. The Image Size dialog box (which you can see 
in Figure 2-5) has two separate but related sets of information about your 
image. At the top, you see information about the actual image itself, in the 
Pixel Dimensions area. Below, in the Document Size area, you see instruc-
tions for a printing device — that “size” pertains only to printing and has no 
impact on what you do in Photoshop.
Figure 2-5: At the top, real information about your image. Below, merely printing instructions.
 
You’ll find it very handy to change the pixel dimensions and the print size at 
the same time in the Image Size dialog box. And, much to the delight of math-
challenged folks, the Image Size feature does most of the calculations. For 
example, with the Constrain Proportions option selected, you enter a new 
Width and Photoshop calculates the new Height automatically!
Changing the size of your artwork with the Image Size command
You have a number of ways to change the size of your photos and other art. 
In Chapter 4, I introduce you to cropping (chopping off part of the artwork to 
make it fit a certain size or to improve its overall appearance and impact). You 
can use Photoshop’s Image Size command to change the image dimensions 

28
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
or printing instructions without altering the composition, which is the visual 
arrangement of the image or artwork. All the content of the original image 
is there, just at a different size. Of course, as you can see in Figure 2-6, if 
you reduce the size of an image too much, some of that original content can 
become virtually unrecognizable.
Figure 2-6: As the zoomed-in smaller image shows, you can reduce an image too much.
If you know the specific pixel dimen-
sions that you need for the final 
image — say for a Web page — you 
can simply type a new number in 
one of the upper fields in the Image 
Size dialog box and click OK. In most 
cases, you select all three check 
boxes at the bottom of the dialog 
box, enter your desired print width 
or height (letting Photoshop cal-
culate the other dimension), enter 
your desired print resolution, and 
click OK. Of course, you probably 
want a little more control over the 
process, don’t you? Figure 2-7 gives 
you a closer look at the Image Size 
dialog box.
In the lower part of the Image Size 
dialog box, you have three decisions to make. The first is rather easy: If 
you’re resizing an image that uses layer styles (see Chapter 12), you want 
to select the Scale Styles check box to preserve the image’s appearance as 
Figure 2-7: Your choices can have a substantial 
impact on the appearance of your final image.

29
 Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
it shrinks or grows. In a nutshell, layer styles (such as shadows, glows, and 
bevels) are applied to a layer at a specific size. You can scale the image 
without changing those sizes, or you can scale the image and change the 
style sizes proportionally. Not scaling layer styles can dramatically alter the 
appearance of a resized image, as you can see in Figure 2-8. A slight bevel 
combined with a small drop shadow produces a subtle 3D effect in the origi-
nal (upper) image. Below, when the image is scaled down to 1/4 the original 
size without scaling the effects, your chips change to chumps, and the art-
work is ruined.
Figure 2-8: Scaling an image without scaling its layer styles can ruin your image.
The middle check box, Constrain 
Proportions, should almost always 
remain selected. Some exceptions 
might come up, but you normally 
want to preserve an image’s aspect 
ratio (the relationship between 
height and width) when resizing to 
prevent distorting the image. Figure 
2-9 shows you what can happen 
when you scale one dimension 
without constraining the image’s 
proportions.
Figure 2-9: Resizing an image without con-
straining proportions. Interesting, yes, but 
useful?

30
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
The third check box, Resample Image, is the one that most often requires 
the attention of that gray matter within your skull. Not only do you need to 
decide whether you want to resample the image (change its pixel dimen-
sions), but you also need to decide how you want to resample. Refer to Figure 
2-7 to see that you have five different ways to calculate the change (called 
resampling algorithms).
Before I talk about those choices, 
let me explain what happens when 
the Resample Image box is left 
deselected. The top portion of the 
Image Size dialog box becomes 
unavailable — you can no longer 
make changes in the Pixel Dimension 
fields (as you see in Figure 2-10). 
The information is there, but it 
won’t change. When you clear the 
Resample Image check box, you pro-
tect the original pixels, preventing 
any change to the image itself.
So what’s left? When using Image 
Size without resampling, you’re 
simply changing the instructions 
recorded in the image for your printing device. When you enter one dimen-
sion, either width or height, Photoshop does the math and fills in both the 
other dimension and the new resolution.
 
Take a look at Figure 2-11. I cleared 
the Resample Image check box 
and entered 10 and inches for my 
new print width in order to print 
this image to a letter-size (8.5 x 11 
inches) sheet of paper. Photoshop 
fills in the new height (6.667 inches) 
and a new resolution (307.2 ppi). 
But what if I want an 8 x 10 print? If 
I enter 8 and inches for the height, 
Photoshop recalculates the width to 
12 inches and enters a resolution of 
256 ppi. If I want a true 8 x 10, I have 
to crop some of the image because 
most digital photos have a different 
aspect ratio than an 8 x 10. (You can 
read more about that in Chapter 4.)
Figure 2-10: Clear the Resample Image check 
box to change print size, not pixel dimensions.
Figure 2-11: Enter a value, and Photoshop 
recalculates the fields automatically.

31
 Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
Okay then, back to the subject of resampling! When you resample an image 
(change the pixel dimensions), Photoshop takes the image and maps it to the 
new size, attempting to preserve the image’s appearance as much as possible 
at the new size, using the new number of pixels. Of course, if you take an 
image that’s more than 3,000 pixels wide and resample it to 300 pixels wide, 
you’re going to lose some of the detail. (Remember what happened to the 
photo of the Alpine village earlier in this chapter in Figure 2-6!)
Choosing a resampling method
After you decide to change the pixel dimensions of your image via the Image 
Size command, you need to select one of the five resampling algorithms (take 
another peek at Figure 2-7). Table 2-1 sums up my advice on choosing the 
right one.
To resample or to crop: That is the question
To better understand the difference between 
resampling an image and cropping an image, 
consider this situation:
 1. A painter paints a picture. He or she paints 
it at whatever size he or she thinks is appro-
priate. (Or, perhaps, on the only piece of 
canvas he or she can afford on that par-
ticular day.)
 2. A patron likes the artwork, but the painting 
is too large for the frame that works best 
with the dining room table. Yeah, patrons 
can be like that, can’t they?
 3. The patron asks the artist to make the 
painting fit the frame.
 4. The artist decides between cropping and 
resampling. He or she can grab a pair of 
scissors and cut off some of the painting 
(cropping), or painstakingly re-create the 
painting from scratch at a smaller size. 
Thankfully, Photoshop does the “repaint-
ing” for you, using Image Size with its resa-
mpling algorithms.
 5. The artist charges the patron for the extra 
work. (Don’t forget this final, crucial step!)
Cropping cuts away part of the image to meet 
a target size. Resampling retains all the image 
but shrinks or enlarges it to meet the target size.

32
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
 
If you’ll be resizing a number of images in the same way, either upsampling or 
downsampling, open Photoshop’s Preferences➪General and select the opti-
mal resampling method in the Image Interpolation menu. That algorithm then 
becomes the default in Image Size, saving you the trouble of changing the 
algorithm each time.
 
Keep in mind that the resampling method that you select in the Preferences 
is also used for the Edit➪Transform commands, which you use to scale, 
rotate, and otherwise alter individual elements within your artwork. (You 
can read about the Transform commands in Chapter 10.)

Content-aware scaling
Introduced with Photoshop CS4 is the 
Edit➪Content-Aware Scale command. 
Designed to be used when an image needs to 
be resampled to a new aspect ratio but can’t 
be cropped, it tries (very hard) to keep the sub-
ject of the photo undistorted while stretching or 
shrinking the background. Here’s how to use it:
 1. Open an image or make a selection. Make 
a selection if you need to scale only part of 
an image. If you need to resize the entire 
image, don’t make any selection.
 2. Convert the Background layer. If your 
image has a layer named Background, 
double-click the layer name in the Layers 
palette and rename the layer. You can’t use 
Context-Aware Scale on a flattened image.
 3. Image➪Canvas Size. If increasing the pixel 
dimensions, resize the canvas as required. 
If you’re reducing the size of the image, skip 
this step.
 4. Edit➪Content-Aware Scale. Drag the 
anchor points in the center of the four sides 
of the bounding box to resize to fill the new 
canvas, and then press Return/Enter. Hold 
down the Option/Alt key to scale from the 
center. If you’re resizing an image of one or 
more people, click the button to the right in 
the Options bar to protect skin tones.
 5. Flatten (optional). If desired, use the 
Layer➪Flatten Image command.
In this example, the original image is to the left. In 
the middle, the image has been resampled from 
6.67 x 10 inches to 8 x 10 inches using Image Size 
(with Constrain Proportions deselected). To the 
right, Content-Aware Scale does a much better 
job — in this particular case — of scaling the 
image while minimizing distortion of the subject.
Is Content-Aware Scale a substitute for prop-
erly composing in-camera before shooting? 
Absolutely not! Is it preferable to cropping to 
a new aspect ratio? Rarely. Is it an incredibly 
powerful tool for certain difficult challenges? 
Now we’re talking!

34
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Picking an image resolution
After you have the concept of resampling under your belt, how do you know 
what size you should be resampling to? How many pixels do you need? Here 
are your general guidelines:
 
✓ Photos for your inkjet printer: 
Inkjet printers are stochastic 
printing devices: That is, they 
use a series of droplets to repli-
cate each pixel in your image, as 
shown in Figure 2-12. In theory, 
the optimal image resolution is 
1/3 of the printer’s rated resolu-
tion. For example, for a 1,440 
ppi printer, the formula calls 
for an image resolution of 480 
ppi (and that goes for the 2,880 
x 1,440 printers, too). However, 
most folks find that regardless of the printer’s rating, they never need an 
image resolution higher than 300 ppi.
 
 If you’re printing something that will only be viewed at a distance, such 
as a banner to be hung above the crowd or a poster that hangs on a wall, 
you can print at a substantially lower resolution to save ink and print 
faster. Banners, for example, can often be printed with a resolution of 
100 ppi.
 
✓ Web images: Ignore resolution. Ignore the entire Document Size area of 
the Image Size dialog box. Consider only the image’s pixel dimensions. 
Determine what area of the Web page the image will occupy and then 
resize to exactly those pixel dimensions.
 
✓ Page layout programs and commercial printing: If your image is to be 
placed into a page layout program’s document and sent to a commercial 
printing facility, you need to know the line screen frequency (the resolu-
tion, so to speak) of the printing press on which the job will be run. Ask 
the print shop or the person handling the page layout. Your image reso-
lution should be either exactly 1.5 times or exactly twice the line screen 
frequency. (You shouldn’t notice any difference in the final printed prod-
uct with either resolution.)
 
✓ PowerPoint presentations and word processing documents: Generally 
speaking, 72 ppi is appropriate for images that you place into a presenta-
tion or Word document. You should resize to the exact dimensions of 
the area on the page or slide that the image fills.
Figure 2-12: The close-up to the left shows ink-
jet printer droplets and to the right, pixels.

35
 Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
File Formats: Which Do You Need?
After working with your image in 
Photoshop, you need to save the 
changes. Choosing File➪Save updates 
the current file on your hard drive, 
maintaining the current file format 
when possible. If you added a feature 
to the file that isn’t supported by the 
original file format, Photoshop auto-
matically opens the Save As dialog 
box and shows you which features 
are not supported by the selected file 
format. In Figure 2-13, the lower part 
of the Save As dialog box shows you 
the yellow warning triangles that iden-
tify options being used in the image 
that are not available when saving as 
a JPEG.
You can go ahead and save the image in that format, but your file will no 
longer contain those unsupported features. In the example shown in Figure 
2-13, I can click the Save button and create a JPEG file, but that JPEG won’t 
have the alpha channel (a saved selection) or the spot channel (a custom 
printing color); and it will be flattened to a single layer. If I want to retain 
those features in the file, I need to choose a different file format, such as 
Photoshop’s own PSD format. (Read more about alpha channels in Chapter 8 
and about spot channels in Chapter 6.)
 
No matter which of the file formats you choose, if you add layers, type, 
adjustment layers, channels, or paths to your image, keep the original as 
an unflattened/unmerged (all the layers are preserved) Photoshop (PSD) 
or layered TIFF file. In the future, should you ever need to make changes to 
the image or duplicate an effect in the image, you won’t need to start from 
scratch.
Formats for digital photos
If you print your images yourself at home or the office, you can stick with the 
original format or use the PSD Photoshop format. If you send the photos to 
the local camera shop (or discount store) for printing, stick with JPEG — or, 
if they accept it, TIFF. Here are the pros and cons of the major formats that 
you should consider for photos:
 
✓ PSD: Photoshop’s native file format is great for saving your images with 
the most flexibility. Because the PSD format supports all of Photoshop’s 
features, you don’t need to flatten your images — and keeping your 
layers lets you make changes later. If your file size is very large (400MB 
Figure 2-13: Photoshop shows you which 
image features are not available in your 
selected file format.

36
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
or larger), make a TIFF or JPEG copy before printing, flattening all the 
layers. Don’t send PSD files to the local shop for prints.
 
✓ TIFF: Although the TIFF file format (as you use it in Photoshop) can save 
your layers and most other Photoshop features, make sure to choose 
Layers➪Flatten Image before sending files out for printing. Layered 
TIFF files generally are compat-
ible only with programs in the 
Creative Suite. If you don’t flat-
ten the image prior to saving as 
TIFF or if you elect to include 
layers when saving as TIFF, 
Photoshop presents you with 
a gentle reminder, as shown in 
Figure 2-14.
 
✓ JPG: JPEG, as it’s called, is actu-
ally a file compression scheme 
rather than a file format, but 
that’s not important. What is 
important is that JPEG throws 
away some of your image data 
when it saves the file. Save 
important images in PSD or TIFF 
and use JPEG only for copies. When should you use JPEG? When send-
ing images to a photo lab that doesn’t accept TIFF files and when sending 
images (perhaps by e-mail or on CD) to people who don’t have Photoshop. 
Unlike PSD and TIFF, you can open JPEG images in a Web browser and print 
from there — and so can Granny, and Cousin Jim, and that overseas soldier 
you adopted. When saving JPEGs, the lower the Quality setting you choose 
in the JPEG Options dialog box, the smaller the file but also the more 
damage to the image. I discuss saving as JPEG in more detail in the sidebar, 
“Resaving images in the JPEG format.”
 
✓ PDF: It’s easy to overlook Adobe’s PDF format when talking about photos, 
but you should consider using this format. Although the local photo lab 
probably won’t accept it, it’s a great format for sharing your pictures 
with folks who don’t have Photoshop. Unlike JPEG, your images won’t be 
degraded when saving as PDF; and like JPEG, just about anyone with a 
computer can view the files. (Either Adobe Reader or the Mac’s Preview, 
which you can also use with PDFs, is found on just about every computer 
now, just like Web browsers for JPEG.) Keep in mind, however, that PDF 
files are larger than JPEGs.
 
✓ Large Document Format (PSB): Really, really, really big pictures — over 
30,000 pixels wide or long or both — need to be saved in the PSB file 
format. Will you ever need this format? Consider that 30,000 pixels at a 
photo-quality resolution of 300 ppi is 100 inches long. At a resolution of 
85 ppi, more appropriate for a long banner to hang in a hallway, you’re 
talking about artwork that stretches almost 30 feet! Can your printer 
do that? If not, you probably don’t need the PSB file format.

for use in other programs.

 Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
You could theoretically use a number of other available formats, such as 
DCS, PNG, and Photoshop Raw, but there’s no real need with the more 
common and more versatile formats about which you just read.
 
The JPEG file format doesn’t support 16-bit color, but even when working with 
a 16-bit image (perhaps a Raw image from your digital camera), JPEG is avail-
able as a file format in Photoshop CS5’s Save As dialog box. The image will 
automatically be converted to 8-bit color when saving as JPEG. It’s more conve-
nient — saving you a trip to the Image➪Mode menu to select 8-Bits/Channel — 
but the JPEG is an 8-bit version of the original image, which you probably want 
to first save in a format that supports 16-bit color, such as PSD or TIFF.
Formats for Web graphics
Generally speaking, you use Photoshop’s Save for Web & Devices command 
rather than Save As to generate copies of your images for use on a Web site 
or for use with cellphones, PDAs, and other such devices. Here are the three 
file formats that you need for the Web:
 
✓ JPG: Use JPEG for photos. Remember to resize the photo so that it fits on 
a Web page. When selecting a Quality setting, you need to balance image 
appearance with file size. A smaller file downloads (and displays in a Web 
browser) faster, but a larger file generally looks better. If you reduce the 
Quality setting until just before the image doesn’t look great, you’ve hit 
the sweet spot — the compromise between file size and image quality.
 
✓ GIF: GIF is more appropriate for items like Web 
buttons and banners (such as those shown in 
Figure 2-15) than it is for photos. If you save a 
photo that’s more than perhaps 100 x 100 pixels 
in size, you might see some degradation of the 
image quality as similar colors become one 
color. When you save an image as GIF, it can 
contain no more than 256 distinct colors. JPEG 
and the other common file formats can have 
thousands of different colors.
 
✓ PNG: PNG comes in two types: PNG-8 (which 
is a substitute for GIF) and PNG-24 (which 
is a substitute for JPEG). PNG has a couple 
of advantages for Web designers, such as 
support for transparency, but not all Web 
browsers can display PNG graphics. Generally 
speaking, it’s safer to use JPEG and GIF.
Formats for commercial printing
You’re the Photoshop master of your office. 
Everyone knows that you understand everything 
Figure 2-15: Use GIF for Web 
interface items.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
about digital images. So you’re the right person to create the company’s new 
brochure. Except you’re a photographer. Or you’re a Web designer. Or you’re 
actually pretty new to Photoshop. And you don’t have a clue about preparing 
images for a commercial printing press.
Here’s what you need to know about file formats for those CMYK (cyan/
magenta/yellow/black) color images that you’re sending to the print shop:
 
✓ TIFF: TIFF is generally a solid choice. Use TIFF for photographic images 
that don’t contain any type layers.
 
✓ EPS: Choose EPS if your image has type. Don’t flatten or merge the type 
layers before using Save As to create the EPS. In the EPS options, make 
sure to select the Include Vector Data check box to ensure that your 
type prints perfectly.
 
 If you reopen an EPS file in Photoshop, your type layers get merged. 
Don’t! Instead, make sure to save your original file as PSD and, should 
you need to make changes, open the PSD and create a new EPS file when 
you’re done editing.
 
✓ PDF: PDF offers the same disadvantage (don’t reopen in Photoshop) as 
the EPS file format. But it also offers support for spot color channels, 
alpha channels, and paths — options not supported by EPS. (Spot chan-
nels are used with custom colors, and alpha channels store information 
about transparency in the image.) If your file uses any of these features, 
choose PDF over EPS, if your print shop accepts PDFs.
 
 When saving as PDF, the PDF Options dialog box offers you Preserve 
Photoshop Editing Capabilities. If you select the option, the PDF file will 
reopen in Photoshop CS5 with layers and editable type. However, this 
option isn’t compatible with Photoshop CS and earlier, and it can cause 
problems in a page layout program other than InDesign.
 
✓ PSD: Use PSD only if you’re adding the image file to a project in Adobe 
InDesign. Don’t send PSD files to a print shop unless specifically 
requested to do so by the print shop.
 
✓ DCS: DCS 2.0 is a variation of the EPS file format that supports spot color 
channels and alpha channels. Use it primarily with QuarkXPress.
Formats for PowerPoint and Word
If the final destination of your image is PowerPoint or Word, use the PNG file 
format. If your image has areas of transparency in it, PNG is definitely the way 
to go. (Read about the two types of PNG files in “Formats for Web graphics,” 
earlier in this chapter.)
And what about all that neat clip art that you have on your hard drive? How do 
you use those images when Photoshop won’t open the vector-based WMF and 
EMF clip art files? Here’s how you get clip art into Photoshop, quick and easy:

39
 Chapter 2: Knowing Just Enough about Digital Images
 
1. Open a new document in Word (or a comparable word processing 
program).
 
2. Add the clip art.
 
 In Word, choose Insert➪Picture➪Clip Art (or your word processor’s 
comparable command). Click directly on the artwork and drag the 
lower-right corner to resize it to the dimensions that you need in 
Photoshop. (The artwork comes into Photoshop at 300 ppi.)
 
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
 This copies the image to the 
Clipboard (the computer’s 
memory) in Word.
 
4. Switch to your Photoshop 
document.
 
5. Choose Edit➪Paste.
 
 You have your clip art, ready 
to use in Photoshop! Use the 
Edit➪Transform commands to 
scale, rotate, and otherwise fit 
the clip art into your design. 
(See Figure 2-16.)
Resaving images in the JPEG format
JPEG uses a lossy compression scheme: That 
is, as part of the compression process, it actu-
ally permanently throws away some data when 
you save your image. The lower the Quality set-
ting, the more image degradation occurs. Take 
a look at the figure here. The original image 
is on the left. In the middle is the same image 
saved in JPEG format with medium quality and 
then on the right with low quality. Take a look 
at the inset on the eye (400% zoom). See what I 
mean by degradation?
If you save by using JPEG a second time, even 
more data is thrown away. Every time you save, 
your image quality suffers. Yes, indeed, you 
might sometimes need to open a JPEG image, 
make some changes, and save as JPEG again 
(perhaps for the Web, perhaps to share with 
non-Photoshop friends and family). To minimize 
damage to the image, either use the highest set-
ting (12) for the Quality setting or (if you know it) 
the exact same setting used last in Photoshop.

Taking the Chef’s Tour of 
Your Photoshop Kitchen
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the general guidelines for working in Photoshop
▶ Working more efficiently with customization
▶ Determining your preferences and color settings
▶ Troubleshooting Photoshop
I
 know you’re hungry to dive right in and start mixing up some master-
pieces, but before you fire up the stove, look around the Photoshop 
kitchen. Get to know your spoons from your ladles, your pots from 
your pans, figure out how to turn on the blender . . . that sort of 
thing.
In this chapter, rather than going through all the 
Photoshop menus, panels, and tools (which would 
take several hundred very boring pages), I show 
you some basic operational concepts. (But don’t 
worry — you can read about how to use specific 
commands and tools throughout the book, in the 
chapters most appropriate for them.) Here you 
discover such things as how to spot which menu 
commands have dialog boxes, what the little symbol 
in the upper-right corner of a panel does, and which 
tools don’t use the Options bar. You also read about 
customizing your Photoshop environment for faster 
and more efficient work. Next I show you how to set up 
Photoshop’s Preferences and Color Settings. And to wrap up 
the chapter — perhaps the most important section in this entire 
book — I explain what to do when Photoshop doesn’t seem to be working 
properly.

42
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Food for Thought: How Things Work
A good understanding of certain fundamental operations and features in 
Photoshop provides you with the background that you need in order to 
follow the recipes or get creative and whip up some delicious artwork.
 
And don’t forget about Photoshop’s Tool Tips. If you don’t know what some-
thing or some option does, park your cursor over it for a couple of seconds, 
and Photoshop provides its information in a little box.
Ordering from the menus
When you’re working in Photoshop, you see a horizontal list of menus spread 
across the very top (Mac) or near the top (Windows) of the screen: File, 
Edit, Image, Layer, Select, Filter, View, Window, and Help. (If you also see the 
Analysis and 3D menus, you have Photoshop CS5 Extended.) On the Mac, the 
program also has a menu named Photoshop, just to the left of the File menu.
As with most programs, you click the 
name of a menu to reveal its com-
mands. For both Mac and Windows, 
you can click and hold down the 
mouse button until you’re over the 
command you want; or, you can click 
and release, move the cursor, and 
then click again. Some commands, 
such as Crop and Reveal All, are exe-
cuted immediately after you choose 
them. When a command name in 
the menu is followed by an ellipsis 
(. . .) — the Image Size command 
shown in Figure 3-1, for example — 
you know that a dialog box will open 
so that you can input variables and make decisions. A triangle to the right of 
a command name, such as that which you see next to Image Rotation, indi-
cates a submenu. If you click the command name, another menu appears to 
the right. The cryptic set of symbols to the right of the Image Size command 
is the keyboard shortcut for opening the command’s dialog box. (I show 
you how to assign keyboard shortcuts later, in the section “Sugar and spice, 
shortcuts are nice.”)
As you read in the upcoming section, “Clearing the table: Custom work-
spaces,” Photoshop menus are customizable — you don’t have to see com-
mands that you never use. You can also color-code your menu commands, 
making it easier to spot those that you need regularly.
Figure 3-1: Some commands have submenus, 
and some have dialog boxes.

43
 Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
When a specific command appears grayed out in the menu (in gray type 
rather than black), that command isn’t available. Some commands, such 
as Reveal All in Figure 3-1, are available only under specific circumstances, 
such as part of the image being hidden with the Crop tool. When working 
with Photoshop’s creative filters, you’ll find that many aren’t available unless 
you’re working with an 8-bit RGB (red/green/blue) image. (Color modes and 
bit depth are discussed in Chapter 6; filters are explored in Chapter 15.)
Your platter full of panels
Photoshop, like the other programs of the Adobe Creative Suite, uses float-
ing panels. The panels, many of which you see along the right edge of your 
screen, usually appear on top of (float over) your image window. (As you 
drag panels around to customize your workspace, you’ll find that panels can 
hide other panels.) The Options bar across the top of the work area and the 
Toolbox (technically, it’s called the Tools panel) along the left edge of the 
screen are also panels.
Panels contain Photoshop features that you might need to access regu-
larly enough that using a menu command is inconvenient. (I can’t imagine 
having to mouse to a menu command every time I want to change tools or 
select a specific layer!) You don’t always need to have your panels visible. 
In Photoshop, press the Tab key to hide all the panels or press Shift+Tab to 
hide all but the Toolbox and the Options bar. With fewer panels visible, you 
provide more room for your image. You can selectively hide and show panels 
via the Window menu.
Photoshop uses expanding/collapsing panel docks. As shown to the right in 
Figure 3-2, clicking the double-arrow button at the top of a stack of panels 
collapses that stack to a tidy group of icons. The Color, Adjustments, and 
Layers panels are fully visible. The Swatches, Styles, Masks, Channels, and 
Paths panels — “nested” with the three visible panels — can be made vis-
ible by clicking on the panel tab. The collapsed Navigator, Histogram, and 
Info panels all together occupy only a tiny fraction of the screen, those three 
buttons to the left of the Color panel. In Photoshop’s Preferences (discussed 
later in this chapter), you can even elect to have each docked palette auto-
matically collapse when you’re done working with it.
By clicking and dragging a panel’s tab when the panel isn’t collapsed, you can 
move it to another grouping or pull it out of its grouping and away from the 
edge of the screen. You might, for example, want to drag the Clone Source 
panel away from its buddies to make it more easily accessible while perform-
ing a complex clone operation. (The Clone Source panel is used with the 
Clone Stamp tool. You can specify up to five different source locations and 
easily switch among them.)

44
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Figure 3-2: Nesting and collapsing panels open up the work area.
Many of the panels are resizable. 
Like an image window, you drag 
the lower-right corner of the panel 
to expand or contract it. Almost all 
the Photoshop panels have a panel 
menu from which you select various 
options. (The Toolbox and Options 
bar don’t have menus.) You open 
the panel menu by clicking the small 
button in the upper-right corner of 
the panel, as shown in Figure 3-3. The 
panel menu contains such options 
as thumbnail size (for example, the 
Layers, Channels, and Paths panels); 
how to display items in the panel 
(Swatches, Styles, and Brush among 
others); or even the size and content of the panel (Info and Histogram).
Figure 3-3: Access a panel’s menu by clicking 
the button below the double-arrow. (Clicking 
the double-arrow expands or collapses the 
panel group).

45
 Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
 
You might have noticed in Figure 3-2 that the Photoshop Toolbox is one 
tall skinny column along the left edge of the screen to free up even more 
workspace. If you prefer a shorter, squatter two-column Toolbox, click the 
Expand/Collapse button (the double arrow) at the top of the column.
The content of some panels changes 
automatically as you work with your 
image. Add a layer, and the Layers 
panel shows a new layer. Save a 
selection, and the Channels panel 
shows a new alpha channel. If you 
drag a shape tool, the Layers panel 
gets a new layer, and the Paths panel 
shows the layer’s vector mask. You 
control some other panels by load-
ing and deleting content through the 
panel menus or with the Edit➪Preset 
Manager command. Use the Preset 
Manager (as shown in Figure 3-4) to 
save sets of your custom bits and 
pieces as well as to load and delete items from the panels.
In addition to the content of the Brush, Swatches, Styles, and Tool Presets 
panels, you use the Preset Manager with a number of pickers. Pickers are sort 
of mini-panels, available only with certain tools or features. The Gradient 
and Custom Shape pickers are accessed through the Options bar when those 
tools are in use. The Pattern picker is found in the Fill dialog box, the Layer 
Style dialog box, and (with some tools) in the Options bar. The Contour 
picker is used with six of the effects in the Layer Style dialog box.
 
When you create custom layer styles, brushes, gradients, and the like, use 
the Preset Manager to protect your work. Create sets of the items and save 
those sets with the Preset Manager. Then remember to save copies of the 
sets someplace on your hard drive outside the Photoshop folder so that 
you don’t accidentally delete them if you ever (oh, no!) have to reinstall 
Photoshop. Remember that new content of your panels is stored only in 
Photoshop’s Preferences file (introduced later in this chapter) until you 
create and save sets.
The tools of your trade
You control the behavior of Photoshop’s tools through the Options bar. 
With the exception of a few path-related tools (Direct Selection, Add Anchor 
Point, Delete Anchor Point, and Convert Point), every tool in Photoshop has 
Figure 3-4: Use the Preset Manager to control 
the content of a number of panels.

46
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
options. The Options bar changes as you switch tools. In some cases, the 
Options bar changes while you work with the tool. In the case of the Crop 
tool, as shown in Figure 3-5, you have one set of options before you drag the 
tool and another set after establishing the bounding box.
Figure 3-5: The Options bar changes when you have an active crop marquee.
The behavior of some tools changes when you add one or more modifier 
keys (Ô, Shift, and Option for the Mac; Ctrl, Shift, and Alt for Windows). 
As an example of how modifier keys can affect tool behavior, consider the 
Rectangular Marquee and Elliptical Marquee tools:
 
✓ Hold down the Shift key while dragging. Normally the marquee selection 
tools are freeform — you drag however you like. When you hold down the 
Shift key while dragging, on the other hand, you constrain the proportions 
of the selection to a square or circle (rather than a rectangle or ellipse).
 
✓ Hold down the Option/Alt key while dragging. When you hold down 
the Option/Alt key while dragging a marquee selection tool, the selection 
is centered on the point where you first clicked. Rather than being a 

47
 Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
corner of a selection, that start-
ing point is the center of the 
selection.
 
✓ Hold down the Shift and 
Option/Alt keys while drag-
ging. You can select from the 
center while constraining pro-
portions by using the Shift and 
Option/Alt keys together.
 
✓ Use the Shift key to add to 
an existing selection. If you 
already have an active selection 
in your image, Shift+dragging a 
selection tool adds to that selec-
tion. (Press Shift before you click and drag.)
 
✓ Use the Option/Alt key to subtract from an existing selection. When 
you have an existing selection and you hold down the Option/Alt key, 
you can drag to subtract from the selection. Note in Figure 3-6 that the 
selection tool’s cursor shows a small minus sign when subtracting from 
a selection.
 
✓ “Double-clutch” with the Shift or Option/Alt key. You can even con-
strain proportions or select from the center and add to or subtract from 
a selection. Press the Shift key (to add to the existing selection) or the 
Option/Alt key (to subtract from the existing selection). Click and start 
dragging the marquee selection tool. While continuing to hold down the 
mouse button, release the modifier key and press and hold Shift (to con-
strain proportions), Option/Alt (to center the selection), or both; then 
continue to drag your selection tool. You might want to use this tech-
nique, for example, when creating a donut-shaped selection. Drag the 
initial circular selection and then subtract a smaller circular selection 
from the center of the initial circle.
Don’t be afraid to experiment with modifier keys while working with tools. 
After all, you always have the Undo command (Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z) at hand!
Get Cookin’ with Customization
Customizing Photoshop not only helps you work faster and more efficiently, 
but it can also help you work more precisely and prevent tragic errors. 
Consider using a Crop tool preset to create a 5 x 7 print at 300 pixels per inch 
(ppi). Such a preset will always produce exactly those dimensions, every 
single time. Setting up the Crop tool each time you need a 5 x 7 at 300 ppi 
doesn’t just waste time: It also opens the door for time-consuming or project-
wrecking typos. (“Oops! I guess I made a mistake — this image is 5 x 7 at only 
30 pixels per inch!”)
Figure 3-6: Use the Option/Alt key with a selec-
tion tool to subtract from a selection.

48
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Clearing the table: Custom workspaces
One of the easiest ways to work more efficiently is to see your image better. 
Generally speaking, bigger is better, so the more room you have on the moni-
tor to display your artwork, the better you can zoom in and do precise work. 
The easiest way to gain workspace? Press the Tab key to hide Photoshop’s 
panels. Pressing Shift+Tab hides all the panels except the Options bar and 
the Toolbox.
 
Keep in mind that it’s best to use 100% zoom when evaluating your image for 
banding or moiré and when applying filters. Any other zoom factor is a simu-
lation of the image’s appearance. If you have a computer and video card that 
support OpenGL drawing (check the computer’s User Guide or call your tech 
support folks), you have much better on-screen display. But 100% zoom is 
safest when making critical decisions.
You can also drag the panels that you need regularly to a custom group of 
panels. To move a panel, drag it by the tab and “nest” it with other panels. 
And don’t forget that the major panels have keyboard shortcuts assigned to 
show and hide. Although keyboard shortcuts are customizable (as you can 
read later in this chapter), here are the primary panels’ assigned F keys, the 
function keys that appear at the top of your keyboard:
 
✓ Actions: Option/Alt+F9
 
✓ Brush: F5
 
✓ Color: F6
 
✓ Info: F8
 
✓ Layers: F7
 
Any panels nested with the panel that you show/hide are also shown and 
hidden. And don’t forget that you can always restore all panels to their 
default locations by choosing Window➪Workspace➪Essentials (Default). 
If the default workspace is already selected, use the command Window➪
Workspace➪ Reset Essentials to get back to the default panel layout.
The most efficient way to customize your work area is to create and save spe-
cialized workspaces. Arrange the panels exactly as you need them for a par-
ticular job you do regularly, choose Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace 
(in the Windows menu, visible panels are indicated with a checkmark), and 
name the workspace for that type of job. Then you can make a specialized 
workspace for each type of work you do. For example, perhaps when you 
do color correction, you need to see the Histogram panel (in the expanded 

49
 Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
view), the Info panel, and the Channels panel. Arrange those panels how 
you need them and then hide the rest, saving the workspace named as Color 
Correction. Or, perhaps when you create illustrations in Photoshop, you 
need to see the Layers and Paths panels at the same time. Drag one out of 
the group to separate it, position them both where convenient, and save the 
workspace as Illustration.
To access a saved workspace, 
choose Window➪Workspace and 
select it from the list at the top of the 
menu, as shown in Figure 3-7. You 
can see some preset custom work-
spaces in the middle sections of the 
menu, as well.
 
You can also save the current state 
of the customizable keyboard short-
cuts and menus in your workspace. 
Although streamlining the menus 
for the specific work you’re doing is 
a great idea, it’s probably not such 
a great idea to have more than one 
set of custom keyboard shortcuts. 
The time it takes to remember which 
shortcuts go with the current work-
space (or to undo a mistake caused 
by the wrong shortcut) is time 
wasted.
To customize Photoshop’s menus, 
choose Edit➪Menus, which opens 
the Keyboard Shortcuts and Menus 
dialog box. (Alternatively, choose Edit➪Keyboard Shortcuts and click the 
Menus tab.) Here you can find every menu command listed. You also have 
the option of hiding a command or assigning a custom color to make it easier 
to identify in the menu. You might, for example, hide the artistic filters that 
you never use, and color-code the others according to how you like or use 
them (see Figure 3-8).
In addition to the application menu commands (from the menus at the top of 
the screen), you can switch the Menus For pop-up to Panel menus and cus-
tomize those menus, too. Don’t forget to save your customized menu arrange-
ments with the button directly to the right of the Settings pop-up. Your saved 
menu set appears in that Settings pop-up for easy access.
Figure 3-7: Select a workspace from the menu 
to instantly rearrange your panels.

50

Figure 3-8: You can hide menu commands and color-code the visible commands.
Sugar and spice, shortcuts are nice
The Photoshop keyboard shortcuts can save a bunch of time. Rather than 
mousing to the Toolbox to select the Brush tool, just press the B key. To 
open the Levels dialog box, press Ô+L/Ctrl+L instead of mousing to the 
Image menu, down to the Adjustments submenu, and then over and down 
to Levels.
Photoshop has customizable keyboard shortcuts. Because the default set 
of shortcuts is pretty standard — not only throughout the Adobe Creative 
Suite but also with other major programs — you’re probably best served by 
making only a few changes. Open Keyboard Shortcuts and Menus (shown in 
Figure 3-9) through the Edit menu to make one major change and then any 
changes for personal preferences. Change Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z to use Step Backward. 
In most programs, pressing Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z keeps undoing — reverting through a 
series of previous actions in the program. In Photoshop, however, that short-
cut toggles an Undo/Redo function; that is, press once to undo and press a 
second time to reverse the undo. Bah! Make Photoshop conform to the undo-
undo-undo behavior common to other programs. In Keyboard Shortcuts, 
under Edit, change Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z to Step Backward and then use Ô+Option+Z/
Ctrl+Alt+Z to toggle between Undo and Redo.

Spoons can’t chop: Creating tool presets
One of the keys to efficient, accurate work in Photoshop is using the right 
tool for the job. The Patch tool, for example, copies texture only. If you need 
to cover a spot on a client’s face, changing both texture and color, you need 
the Clone Stamp tool rather than the Patch tool. (You can read about how the 
tools work throughout this book.)
You can ensure that you’re using not 
only the correct tool but also the cor-
rect settings for that tool by creating 
tool presets, which store your set-
tings from the Options bar. You can 
then select the preset tool (and, of 
course, that’s where the catchy name 
comes from) from the Tool Presets 
panel or from the left end of the 
Options bar, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Figure 3-10: Tool presets help you work faster 
and more accurately.

52
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Although just about any tool is a good candidate for tool presets, some are 
just plain naturals. Consider, if you will, the Crop tool. As I explain in Chapter 
4, a photo from a high-end digital camera has an aspect ratio (relationship 
between width and height of the image) of 2:3, and common print and frame 
aspect ratios include 4:5 for 8 x 10 prints; 5:7; and 13:19 for large prints. 
(Some lower-cost cameras shoot in different aspect ratios.) You’ll often find a 
need to crop an image to a specific size to meet your printing requirements. 
And, don’t forget resolution — printing in the correct size at the wrong 
resolution is simply a waste of paper and ink! Set up a number of Crop tool 
presets for your typical print sizes and relax, knowing that you’ll always be 
cropping correctly.
Another logical candidate for tool presets is the Type tool. When you con-
sider all the options for the Type tool in not only the Options bar but also in 
the Character and Paragraph panels, you have quite a bit to select and track. 
To ensure consistent text from project to project, consider creating tool pre-
sets for each project, including (as appropriate) headline and body text, spe-
cial effects and accent type, and even your copyright information.
 
Using the Preset Manager (opened through the Edit menu), you can drag the 
tools presets up and down to rearrange them. Sort them in a logical order or 
move the presets you use most often to the top of the panel. The changes 
are for both the Tool Presets panel and the picker at the left end of the 
Options bar.
Season to Taste: The Photoshop Settings
The program-level Preferences and the Color Settings flavor all your work 
in Photoshop. The options that you choose in Photoshop’s Preferences 
(or simply the Prefs) control many facets of the program’s basic behavior. 
Choices made in the Color Settings dialog box determine how your work 
looks, both on-screen and in print. And when you get down to brass tacks, 
that’s what it’s all about — the appearance of your artwork.
Standing orders: Setting the Preferences
Photoshop’s Preferences file stores a whole lot of information about how you 
use the program. Whether you prefer to measure in inches or pixels, how you 
like the grid and guides displayed, what size thumbnails you prefer in your 
panels, which font you used last — all sorts of data is maintained in the Prefs. 
Much of the info in the Preferences is picked up automatically as you work 
(such as the size and color mode of the last new document you created, 

53
 Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
whether the Character panel was visible when you last shut down the pro-
gram, and which tool options were selected in the Options bar), but you must 
actively select a number of options in the Preferences dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 3-11.
Figure 3-11: Use Photoshop’s Preferences to establish many program behaviors.
 
Your custom styles, brushes, Actions, and the like are recorded only in 
Photoshop’s Preferences until you actually save them to your hard drive. 
That makes them vulnerable to accidental loss. Use the Actions panel menu 
command Save Action to save sets of Actions (not individual Actions) and 
use the Preset Manager (under the Edit menu) to save sets of your other 
bits and pieces. And make sure to save them in a safe location outside the 
Photoshop folder — you wouldn’t want to accidentally delete your custom 
items if you should ever have to (oh, no!) reinstall Photoshop, would you?
Open the Prefs on a Mac with the keyboard shortcut Ô+K or choose 
Photoshop➪Preferences to select one of the ten specific subsets of 
Preferences to change. The shortcut for Windows users is Ctrl+K, and the 
Preferences submenu is under the Edit menu. The default settings are per-
fectly acceptable (after all, they are the defaults for a reason), but the fol-
lowing sections cover some changes to the Prefs to consider, listed by the 
section of the Preferences dialog box in which you find them.

54
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Preferences➪General
If you’ll be doing a lot of resizing and scaling in Photoshop, consider changing 
the Image Interpolation method. Use Bicubic Smoother if you’ll be increasing 
pixel dimensions regularly; select Bicubic Sharper when downsizing.
The History Log maintains a record of what you’ve done to a specific image. 
You can record when you opened and saved a file with the Sessions option, 
a summary of what you did with the Concise option, or you can keep track of 
every command, every feature, and every setting you used with the Detailed 
option! And the log can be recorded to a text file or stored in an image’s 
metadata for retrieval with Photoshop’s File➪File Info command.
One option not selected by default that you may find very handy is Zoom 
Clicked Point to Center. When you click with the Zoom tool, this option auto-
matically centers the view on the point where you clicked.
 
If the options Animated Zoom and Enable Flick Panning are grayed out, your 
computer doesn’t support OpenGL drawing. If you do see these options, 
they’re worth a try — zooming in and out is smooth and a short, quick jerk of 
the Hand tool can send a zoomed-in view shooting across the screen.
 
Also note the button named Reset All Warning Dialogs at the bottom of the 
General pane. Many of Photoshop’s handy reminder messages include a 
Don’t Show Again option. If you someday decide that you do indeed need to 
start seeing one or more of those reminders again, open the Prefs and click 
this button.
Preferences➪Interface
The Interface panel of the Preferences offers several options of note:
 
✓ Screen Modes: You can easily customize the look of Photoshop’s three 
screen modes.
 
✓ Show Channels in Color: When only one channel is active in the 
Channels panel, it normally shows as a grayscale representation of the 
image. If you prefer to have the active channel appear in its own color, 
select this option. I do suggest to you, however, that after you get 
comfortable working with individual channels, the default grayscale is 
easier to see.
 
✓ Show Menu Colors: As I discuss earlier in this chapter, you can assign 
colors to specific commands in the Photoshop menus. That might make 
it easier for you to quickly spot and select often-used commands. Use 
this option to disable the color coding without having to deselect each 
assigned color.

55
 Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
 
✓ Show Tool Tips: Pause the cursor over just about any tool or option in 
Photoshop and a little yellow box appears, telling you what that feature 
does. This is a great feature while you’re learning about Photoshop, but 
might be distracting after you master the program. Disable the Tool Tips 
if you decide you no longer need or want to see them.
 
✓ Auto-Collapse Iconic Panels: If you prefer an uncluttered workplace, 
here’s a great option for you! When selected, panels in icon mode (click 
the upper bar of a group of panels) collapse to buttons. To open a panel, 
you click its button. When Auto-Collapse is selected, the selected panel 
automatically closes when you click elsewhere in Photoshop. If you need 
to keep a specific panel open while you work (perhaps Histogram or 
Info), drag it out of its group and away from the edge of the screen, and 
it will stay open until you close it.
 
✓ Auto-Show Hidden Panels: Position the cursor over a collapsed panel 
and it springs open.
 
✓ Open Documents as Tabs: Photoshop, by default, opens each document 
as a tab across the top of the work area. You click on a tab to bring that 
image to the front. If you find that you’re constantly dragging tabs off to 
create floating windows, deselect this option in the Preferences.
Preferences➪File Handling
Image previews add a little to the file size, but in most cases, you want to 
include the preview. On Macs, you have the option of including a file exten-
sion or not (or having Photoshop ask you each and every time). Even if you 
don’t plan on sharing files with a Windows machine, I strongly recommend 
that you always include the file extension in the filename by selecting the 
Always option. Likewise, I suggest that you always maximize PSD and PSB file 
compatibility. This ensures that your Photoshop files can be opened (with as 
many features intact as possible) in earlier versions of the program and that 
they’ll function properly with other programs in the Creative Suite. 
Preferences➪Performance
The Performance panel contains options related to how Photoshop runs on 
your computer:
 
✓ Memory Usage: If you have 2GB or less of RAM, leave the memory allo-
cation set to the default (70% for Mac, 55% on Windows). If you have 
more than 2GB of RAM, especially when working with a 64-bit version of 
Windows or with Mac 10.6, try bumping the memory allocation to 100%. 
If things seem slower rather than faster, back off the memory allocation 
to perhaps 85%. In a 64-bit environment, Photoshop can take advantage 
of all the RAM you can cram (into the computer).

56
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
 
✓ Scratch Disks: Photoshop’s scratch disks are hard drive space used to 
support the memory. Use only internal hard drives as scratch disks — 
never an external drive, a network drive, or removable media! If you 
have multiple internal hard drives, consider a dedicated partition (per-
haps 15–50GB) on the second drive — not the drive on which the operat-
ing system is installed. Name the partition Scratch and use it exclusively 
as a scratch disk for Photoshop (and perhaps Adobe Illustrator). If you 
have a couple of extra internal drives, each can have a scratch parti-
tion. (On a Windows computer, you might see a message warning you 
that the scratch disk and the Windows paging file, which serves the 
same basic purpose at the system level, are on the same drive. If you 
have only one internal hard drive, ignore the message.) To re-order the 
scratch disks, click on the scratch disk in the list and then, rather than 
dragging, use the arrows keys to the right (as shown in Figure 3-12).
 
Figure 3-12: Re-order the scratch disks with the arrow buttons.
 
✓ History States: This field determines how many entries (up to 1,000) 
appear in the History panel. Storing more history states provides more 
flexibility, but at a cost — storing too many history states uses up all 
your available memory and slows Photoshop to a crawl. Generally 
speaking, 20 or 30 is a good number. If, however, you do a lot of opera-
tions that use what I call “little clicks,” such as painting or dodging/
burning with short strokes, that History Panel fills up quickly. For such 
operations, a setting of perhaps 50 or even 60 is more appropriate.

57
 Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
 
✓ Cache Levels: The image cache stores low-resolution copies of your 
image to speed on-screen display at various zoom levels. Although this 
process speeds up screen redraw, the price is accuracy. Unless your 
video card has trouble driving your monitor at your selected resolu-
tion and color depth, you might be better served by Cache Levels: 1. 
That gives the most accurate picture of your work. (But remember to 
make critical decisions at 100% zoom, where one image pixel equals one 
screen pixel.)
 
✓ GPU Settings: This area displays information about your computer’s 
video card. If your system has the capability, you’ll see a check box for 
Enable OpenGL Drawing. This provides smoother, more accurate views 
at all zoom levels and other enhancements, including the capability to 
rotate the image on-screen — not rotate the canvas, but rotate just the 
on-screen image. And that’s too cool for words when painting a complex 
layer mask!
Preferences➪Cursors
Photoshop offers you a couple of ways to display cursors for painting tools. 
You can show the tool icon (Standard), a small crosshair (Precise), or a rep-
resentation of the tool’s brush tip, indicating the size and shape of the brush 
(Brush Size). With soft-edged brushes, the brush size cursor shows where 
the tool will be applied at 50% strength or higher. Alternatively, select the 
Full Size Brush Tip option, which always shows the full extent of the brush 
tip, regardless of the Hardness setting.
You also have the option of adding 
a crosshair in the middle of either 
brush-size cursor. The crosshair 
option is great for keeping a brush 
centered along an edge or path, and 
it just about eliminates the need for 
the Precise cursor option. As you 
can see in Figure 3-13, when working 
with a soft brush, showing all the 
pixels that are changed even a little 
(to the right) might not give you an 
accurate view of your work. (The 
Normal Brush Tip cursor is shown at 
the top center with the Show Crosshair in Brush Tip option to the lower left.)
 
New in Photoshop CS5 is the Show Only Crosshair While Painting option. 
When this option is selected in the Preferences, the brush cursor appears at 
the selected diameter display (Full Size or Normal) until you press the mouse 
Figure 3-13: When working with a low 
Hardness setting, Normal Brush Tip is usually 
best.

58
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
button (or press the stylus to the tablet). It then automatically switches to 
the crosshair and remains as a precise cursor until you release the mouse 
button (or lift the stylus). Experienced brush tool-using Photoshoppers might 
want to experiment with this option — if you know the diameter, you might 
want to better focus on the center of the brush when you are, for example, 
painting or dodging or burning along a distinct edge.
 
When you’re sure that you have a brush-size cursor selected in the Preferences 
but Photoshop shows you the precise cursor, check the CapsLock key. Press-
ing CapsLock toggles the painting cursors between precise and brush size.
Also found in the Cursors panel is the Brush Preview color. Click the color 
swatch to open the Color Picker and assign a color to use when dynamically 
resizing your brushes. (If you don’t have OpenGL drawing capability, the 
brushes can still be resized, but the color preview will not be visible.) With 
a brush-using tool active, press and hold down the Option+Control keys on 
Mac and drag left or right; on Windows, Alt-right-click and drag left or right 
to resize the brush — on the fly! Want to change the brush hardness? Hold 
down those same keys and drag up or down rather than left or right. 
Preferences➪Transparency & Gamut
If you work in grayscale regularly, you might want to change the color of the 
transparency grid to something that contrasts with your image; perhaps pale 
blue and pale yellow. If you find the gray-and-white checkerboard pattern 
distracting in images with transparency, you can set Grid Size to None, which 
gives you a plain white background in transparent areas of your artwork. 
Preferences➪Units & Rulers
If you create Web graphics rather than print images, you probably want to 
change the unit of measure from Inches to Pixels. Keep in mind that you 
can change the unit of measure on the fly by right-clicking the rulers in your 
image (which you show and hide with the shortcut Ô+R/Ctrl+R). If you regu-
larly print at a resolution other than 300 ppi, you might also want to adjust 
the default resolution for print-size new documents.
Preferences➪Guides, Grid & Slices
Photoshop offers Smart Guides, 
which appear and disappear auto-
matically as you drag the content of 
one layer into and out of alignment 
with the content of other layers. 
Smart Guides (magenta in color by 
default) show when the content 
of the layer you’re dragging aligns 
perfectly with the edges or center of other layers’ content. See Figure 3-14. 
(Show/hide Smart Guides through the View➪Show menu.)
Figure 3-14: The magenta guides show how 
the layer aligns with other layers.

59
 Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
The one thing you might want to change in this panel of the Preferences 
is the Show Slice Numbers option. The slice numbers appear in the upper-
left corner of each slice when you’re subdividing Web graphics. Unless you 
intend to edit the images individually later, you probably don’t need to know 
which slice is which, so slice numbers are generally not necessary. Clear the 
check box to remove the distractions.
Preferences➪Plug-Ins
 
If you have third-party plug-ins, filters, and such that you purchased sepa-
rately for use in Photoshop, consider using a second folder for the plug-ins, 
outside the Photoshop folder, and designate that folder as the Additional 
Plug-Ins Folder in the Preferences. Having your extra plug-ins outside the 
Photoshop folder means you won’t have to reinstall them if you have to 
replace Photoshop. 
Preferences➪Type
Photoshop has a panel in the Preferences that you can use to select some 
type-related options. Photoshop can show the font menu in each font’s name 
in the actual typeface, and you can specify the size of that preview here.
 
Photoshop’s Preferences menu also provides you with direct access to the 
Camera Raw plug-in’s Preferences. In Camera Raw’s Preferences you can, 
among other things, determine whether or not JPEG and TIFF files open into 
Camera Raw.
Ensuring consistency: Color Settings
If one term strikes fear deep in the heart of a typical Photoshop user, it’s 
color management. Few aspects of the program are so misunderstood. Yet 
without wise color management decisions, your images won’t print accu-
rately. For most Photoshop users, color management can be implemented 
with a few key choices in the Edit➪Color Settings dialog box (shown in Figure 
3-15), which can then be saved for future use:
 
✓ Select an RGB working space. Open the Color Settings dialog box 
(under the Edit menu) and select your RGB working space — the color 
space in which you edit and create. If you primarily create Web graph-
ics, shoot in the JPEG format, send your images to a photo lab for 
printing, or print with an inkjet printer that uses only four ink colors 
(cyan, magenta, yellow, and black), choose sRGB as your color space. 
If you shoot Raw and print to an inkjet printer that uses six or more 
inks, or you prepare artwork that will be converted to a CMYK color 
space, choose Adobe RGB. (If you have hardware and software to create 
a custom profile for your computer’s monitor, use that profile at the 
system level so that it’s available to all programs.)

60
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
 
Figure 3-15: Choose wisely in the Color Settings dialog box 
 
for optimal printing.
 
✓ Elect to convert images to your working space. In the Color 
Management Policies area of the Color Settings dialog box, choose RGB: 
Convert to Working RGB. This ensures that the images you see onscreen 
actually use your working profile.
 
✓ Turn off the mismatch warnings. Clear the check boxes for those 
annoying and time-wasting warnings that pop up on-screen any time 
you open an image with a profile other than your working space. You’re 
intentionally converting to your working space — you don’t need to reaf-
firm the decision every time.
 
✓ CMYK and Grayscale settings: CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/black) 
color mode is used exclusively with images intended for output on com-
mercial printing presses and some color laser printers. (Don’t be fooled 
by the inks you purchase for your inkjet printer — the printer’s driver 
expects to convert from RGB, so sending CMYK color to an inkjet will 
produce substandard output.) Likewise, you’ll use Grayscale very rarely. 
If, in fact, you have an inkjet printer that is capable of printing grayscale 
(such as the magnificent Epson Stylus Pro 7900), you may still want to 
have an RGB image and let the printer’s print driver handle the gray-
scale conversion. If, however, you are preparing an image for output on 
a commercial press (in CMYK or Grayscale color mode), speak directly 
with the person who will place the image into the page layout or with 
the print shop to find out what settings to use for that particular job.

61
 Chapter 3: Taking the Chef’s Tour of Your Photoshop Kitchen
When it’s time to print, you’ll get the most accurate and pleasing color prints 
when you let Photoshop (rather than the printer) control color. In the Print 
dialog box’s Color Management section, choose Document to keep the source 
space as your working space. In the Options area, choose Color Handling: 
Photoshop Manages Colors and select the printer’s own profile for the 
specific paper on which you’re printing as the Printer Profile. Use Relative 
Colorimetric as the rending intent and leave the Black Point Compensation 
check box marked. (Note: If your prints are too dark, deselect Black Point 
Compensation.) Click the Print Settings button to open the printer’s own 
options. Make sure to deactivate the printer’s built-in color management and 
select the same paper you chose to the right in Photoshop’s Print dialog box. 
(In Photoshop CS5, the printer’s Print dialog box does not open after you 
click the Print button — make sure to use the Print Settings button before 
clicking the Print button!)
The preceding guidelines are appropriate for most, but not all, Photoshop 
users. You might fall into a special category. If you exclusively create 
Web graphics, in the Color Settings dialog box, choose Settings: Color 
Management Off. In the Save For Web & Devices dialog box, when saving 
images in the JPEG file format, don’t embed ICC profiles. (ICC profiles make 
specific adjustments to the appearance of your images to compensate for 
vagaries of the hardware. I discuss color profiles in Chapter 4.) When you 
eliminate color profiles from the equation, you’re creating Web graphics that 
any Web browser can show properly (or, more accurately, “as properly as 
the viewer’s uncalibrated monitor can display”).
If color in your images needs to be absolutely perfect because merely 
accurate won’t do, consider purchasing hardware and software to calibrate 
and profile all the devices in your workflow. GretagMacbeth and X-Rite 
(www.xrite.com), ColorVision (www.datacolor.com), and PANTONE 
(www.pantone.com) are three sources to explore.
When Good Programs Go Bad: Fixing Photoshop
Sometimes things happen. Bad things. Tools don’t work right. Simple com-
mands take ages to execute. Photoshop (gasp!) crashes! Don’t give up, and 
please don’t toss the machine through the window. (Hey, I might be walking 
past at the time.) Start with the easy fixes and work your way up as necessary.
 
✓ Check the panels and selection. If a tool isn’t working as expected or 
isn’t working at all, check whether you’re inadvertently preventing it 
from doing its job. See whether you have an active selection elsewhere 
in the image or press Ô+D/Ctrl+D to deselect. Look at the Layers panel: 

62
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Are you working on the correct layer? Is the layer itself active or a layer 
mask? Is there no higher layer hiding the area in which you’re trying to 
work? Check the Channels panel: Are the color channels active? At the 
left end of the Options bar, right-click (Control+click for a trackpad) the 
tool icon and select Reset Tool. Open a flattened 8-bit RGB image and try 
the tool or technique in that image. If it works there, the problem isn’t 
Photoshop but rather the specific image. Check the Image➪Mode menu 
to ensure you have an appropriate color mode and bit depth.
 
✓ Reset Photoshop’s Preferences file to the defaults. Before replacing 
the Prefs, open Photoshop’s Preset Manager (through the Edit menu) 
and save any custom styles, gradients, brushes, and so forth. Save them 
in a safe place, outside the Photoshop folder. Open the Actions panel 
and save any sets of custom Actions with the panel menu Save Actions 
command. (Remember that you must click a set of Actions — not an 
individual Action — to use Save Actions.) Open the Preferences and 
Color Settings and make notes about any special settings you’re using. 
Quit Photoshop and restart the program with the Ô+Option+Shift 
keys pressed (Mac); or in Windows, position your fingers over the 
Ctrl+Alt+Shift keys and immediately after launching the program (not 
before), press and hold down the three keys. When asked whether you 
want to delete the Settings file, release the modifier keys and confirm the 
deletion; then allow Photoshop to finish starting. Reset your Preferences 
and Color Settings and reload your custom bits and pieces.
 
✓ Reinstall Photoshop. If replacing the Prefs doesn’t solve the problem, 
try reinstalling Photoshop. Save all your custom items (as described 
earlier) and then uninstall Photoshop. Insert the Photoshop DVD and 
launch the installer, then opt to uninstall. After uninstalling, restart your 
computer (not always necessary, but a good practice) and reinstall.
If reinstalling Photoshop doesn’t solve the problem, the source might be at 
the operating system level or perhaps a hardware problem. Call in the big 
guns by contacting Adobe tech support:

Getting Images into and 
out of Photoshop
In This Chapter
▶ Mommy, where do pictures come from?
▶ Keeping track of your images
▶ Putting pictures on paper
▶ Sharing your work
You could, theoretically, open a new empty Photoshop file, paint in it, 
save the file, and drive from house to house to show the artwork on 
your computer to friends and family. However, you have lots of ways 
to share your images that are much easier. You can print them, 
post them on your Web site, or even e-mail them. And 
e-mailing an image file across the country is much more 
convenient (and, of course, more eco-friendly) than 
driving hither and yon with your computer in the 
trunk.
In this chapter, I show you how to get images into 
Photoshop from your digital camera and your scan-
ner and then how to keep those images organized 
on your hard drive and CDs/DVDs. I discuss the 
basics of printing your images on inkjet printers 
(and alternatives) and tell you some things you need 
to know to make sure you get the prints you expect. 
I also explain how to prepare images for sending by 
e-mail.

Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Bringing Images into Photoshop
Artwork in Photoshop originates in one of three ways:
 
✓ You open an image using Photoshop’s File➪Open dialog box (as shown 
in Figure 4-1) or through Bridge (discussed later in this chapter). If you 
own the Creative Suite, you also have the option of using Version Cue, 
the Creative Suite’s workgroup management program. (Read about 
Version Cue in Bridge’s Help.) In Figure 4-1, note that Windows does not 
provide previews or thumbnails of PSD files, which is one of the reasons 
you have Bridge available.
 
✓ You import an image (typically through a scanning device).
 
✓ You create an image from scratch by choosing File➪New.
Figure 4-1: Windows on the left, Mac to the upper-right.
If you double-click a file and Photoshop doesn’t launch or the wrong program 
launches, you need to associate the file format with Photoshop:

65
 Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop
 
✓ Adobe Bridge file association
 
a. Open Bridge’s Preferences with the shortcut Ô+K/Ctrl+K.
 
b. In the column to the left, click File Type Associations.
 
c. In the lower right, click the Reset to Default Associations button.
 
✓ Mac file association
 
a. In the Mac Finder, right-click (Control+click for a trackpad) a file of 
the type that you want to open in Photoshop.
 
b. From the contextual menu, choose Get Info.
 
c. In the Get Info dialog box, expand the Opens With area, choose 
Photoshop CS5 from the pop-up menu, and click Change All.
 
d. (Optional) Repeat for any additional file formats.
 
 If you double-click a file and Photoshop launches but the image 
doesn’t open, you’ve likely made a change to the Mac OS and need 
to reinstall Photoshop.
 
✓ Windows 7 file association
 
a. Click on the Start button in the lower-left corner of the screen.
 
b. From the menu, select Computer.
 
c. Navigate to a folder that holds one or more files of the format you 
need to associate with Photoshop.
 
d. Right-click on the image file, and in the Open With submenu, select 
Choose default program, and then choose Photoshop CS5.
 
e. (Optional) Repeat for any additional file formats.
Downloading from your digital camera
Adobe Bridge offers the File➪Get Photos from Camera command, which 
offers you the options of organizing with subfolders, renaming, and automati-
cally converting to the DNG file format. Alternatively, you can use the soft-
ware that comes with your digital camera to transfer photographs from it to 
your computer’s hard drive. Or, if you have the hardware, you can remove 
your camera’s memory card, memory stick, or other media from the camera 
and use a card reader, which is a small device designed to read camera stor-
age media. Transferring via the Mac Finder or Windows is generally much 
faster than and usually just as reliable as transferring using the camera manu-
facturer’s software. 

66
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
 
Never open an image into Photoshop directly from a camera, Flash card, or 
CD/DVD. Doing so can slow down your work, and you also risk losing your 
work if Photoshop isn’t able to immediately and efficiently read the original 
file while you work. And, of course, you can’t save from Photoshop back to 
most removable media, so you need to create a new file (on a writable drive) 
anyway. Open images from a network drive only when working with Adobe’s 
Version Cue, the Adobe Creative Suite’s project management software.
After the images are safely stored 
on your local hard drive (or a high-
speed external hard drive), you can 
open them in Photoshop by using 
one of the methods that I describe 
earlier in the chapter. Depending on 
your color settings, you might see a 
warning that the image’s color pro-
file and the profile that you selected 
as your RGB working space don’t 
match. Photoshop asks you what you 
want to do (see Figure 4-2). Generally 
speaking, you want to convert to 
your working space so that you see the most accurate color on your monitor. 
You might want to preserve the embedded profile if you’ll be returning the 
image to the originating computer after looking at or working on it. The third 
option disregards all color profiles and works with uncorrected color. This 
is a good choice when working with images that you’ll later use with a non-
color-managed program, such as a Web browser or presentation program. 
(Without color management, you see the image as it will appear in the other 
program.) You can disable the color mismatch warnings in Photoshop’s 
Color Settings dialog box.
When opening an image that includes text, you might also get a message 
warning you that the type layers need to be updated. Generally speaking, you 
want to update them unless the image contains fonts that aren’t available on 
your computer.
Scanning prints
You place a photo (face down) on the glass of your scanner. You push a 
button. It automatically appears on your computer screen. That’s scanning at 
its most basic. If your scanner’s software installed a Photoshop-compatible 
plug-in into the Import/Export folder inside Photoshop’s Plug-Ins folder, you 
can scan from within Photoshop. (The File➪Import menu will show your 
scanner by name.)

you have to make a choice.

Determining scan resolution
Before scanning an image, you need to make some decisions:
 
✓ How you want to use the image
 
✓ What its final size will be
 
✓ What resolution you need
By determining how many pixels you need beforehand, you eliminate the 
need to resize the image in Photoshop (and the resulting image degradation). 
Many scanner interface windows let you input the final size and resolution 
you need right in the scan window. If you find the need to calculate scan 
resolution manually, here’s how:
 
1. Determine the required pixel dimensions.
 
• For print: If you’ll be printing the image, determine the size at 
which you want to print (in inches) and the resolution at which 
you want to print (typically 300 ppi [pixels per inch] is a good 
choice). Multiply the print width and height by the resolution to 
determine pixel dimensions.
 
• For the Web: If the image is destined for your Web site, determine 
how much of your page the image will occupy (in pixels).
Purchasing commercial images
Some projects require images that you can’t run 
out and shoot yourself. Say, for example, that 
you’re preparing a poster or brochure about a 
ski trip to Japan. In your office or studio. In the 
United States. In July. Pretty tough to shoot what 
you need, eh? Turn to stock photography. You 
can purchase or license stock images (photos, 
illustrations, video, and even audio) from a wide 
variety of sources, including Internet-based 
services and collections on CD/DVD. 
When you consider using stock images, keep 
in mind the difference between royalty-free and 
rights-managed images. Royalty-free images 
are yours to use as you see fit (within the terms 
of your agreement — no resale as stock photos, 
no defamatory or pornographic use, and so on). 
You can use the images when you need them, 
as often as you need them. Rights-managed 
images, on the other hand, are licensed for a 
specific use, in specific media, for a specified 
time. Rights-managed artwork does have one 
advantage over royalty-free: Because usage 
is controlled, you can license exclusive rights 
to the image for that period of time so that the 
image you use won’t appear in some competi-
tor’s advertising at the same time. Royalty-free 
images, on the other hand, are available to 
anyone who pays for them, and usage is not 
controlled.

2. Measure the original.
 
 Before placing it on the scanner’s glass, measure the original image. If 
you’re using only part of the image, measure that part. (Be careful not to 
scratch the original with your ruler!)
 
3. Do the math.
 
 Divide your required pixel dimensions (Step 1) by the physical dimen-
sions of the original (Step 2). The result is your scan resolution. (If you 
get different numbers for the width and height, use the larger and expect 
to do some cropping in Photoshop.)
 
Many flatbed scanners (scanners designed for use with documents and 
photos) have transparency adapters that let you scan film and slides. However, 
if you have a lot of negatives or slides to scan or if the best possible quality is 
required, consider a dedicated film scanner from Nikon, Minolta, or Kodak.
Preventing moiré patterns
Unless you spent thousands of dollars on your scanner, you probably want to 
forget about the scanner software’s color and tonal correction capabilities — 
Photoshop gives you more control. However, here is one thing that scanner 
software does much better than Photoshop, and it’s a capability that you 
should use when appropriate: moiré (pronounced, roughly, mwah-RAY) 
reduction. A moiré pattern is a visible rosette pattern created by the pattern 
of dots placed by the printing press to reproduce color.
When you need to scan a color image 
or artwork that comes from a book, 
magazine, or newspaper (or other 
material printed on an offset printing 
press, such as product packaging or 
signs), you want to use the scanner’s 
software to reduce moiré. When 
you let the scanner know the pat-
tern is there, the scanner’s software 
compensates for the pattern and 
smoothes the scanned image (as you can see in Figure 4-3).
The moiré reduction feature in your scanner’s software might not be imme-
diately recognizable. It might be labeled Descreening, or it could be a choice 
between Color (Photo) and Color (Document). As always, refer to your hard-
ware’s User Guide for specific guidance.
If rescanning is out of the question and you have a moiré pattern to reduce 
in Photoshop, blur the image enough to disguise the problem, and then paint 
with the History Brush to restore areas of critical detail in the image.
Figure 4-3: Scanning without (left) and with the 
scanner’s moiré reduction option.

 Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop
 
Here’s an important announcement from The Department of an Ounce of 
Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure: A minute or two spent cleaning the scan-
ner could save hours of touch-up in Photoshop. Before doing any scanning, 
use a can of compressed air to make sure that the scanner’s glass is clean 
and free of dust. Likewise, check the inside of the scanner’s lid. (What good 
does it do to clean the glass if dust from the lid is going to contaminate it 
again as soon as you close it?) If necessary, eliminate fingerprints or smears 
with appropriate glass cleaner. (Check the scanner’s User Guide for cleaning 
instructions and be careful when using liquid glass cleaner with an electrical 
device! I like to use the same premoistened wipes I use for my eyeglasses.)
 
You can use a burst of compressed air on the original image, too, before plac-
ing it on the glass. Just be careful — hold the can of air some distance away 
from the photo and spray at an angle so that you don’t damage it.
Keeping Your Images Organized
Because digital photography doesn’t have a per-shot cost (as does shooting 
film), people certainly have a tendency to shoot more. And more. And more. 
Experimental shots, this-might-be-interesting shots, special effects shots, and 
(at least in my case) the same shot over and over and over again. They build 
up on your hard drive.
It’s pretty easy to stay organized after you choose a system. The hard part 
is actually deleting those digital photos that you really don’t need to keep — 
you know, out-of-focus, shot at a bad angle, Aunt Betsy’s eyes were closed 
and mouth was open, the 400th shot of the dogs sleeping all curled up, the 
401st shot of the dogs sleeping all curled up, and the like. It takes discipline! 
(Or an optical drive that can burn CDs and/or DVDs.)
Creating a folder structure
I generally recommend using a subject-based organization scheme, 
such as the one shown in Figure 4-4. For example, inside the main folder 
named AllVacationPhotos, you might have subfolders with names such as 
DisneyWorld-2010, NHL_30CityTour, and Paris-2009. (Notice that none of the 
folder names use empty spaces or characters other than letters, numbers, a 
dash, and an underscore — that minimizes the possibility that Photoshop or 
another program won’t be able to find a file.)
 
Don’t overload your folders! If you find that your computer is slowing down 
when it tries to display the content of a folder, you have too many files in the 
folder. Create a second folder of the same name and add -01 and -02 to the 
folder names. Generally speaking, 500MB is probably as large as you want in 
a single folder.

70
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
Figure 4-4: Organize with subfolders.
You can use your computer’s CD/DVD drive (if it has the capability) to burn 
folders of images to disc. This not only provides you with a reliable backup 
(assuming you store the discs correctly and handle them carefully), but it 
can free up space on your hard drive. Your folder/subfolder structure can 
also be used when creating your discs.
Using Adobe Bridge
Adobe Bridge, the asset-management program for Photoshop and the 
Creative Suite, is installed at the same time you install Photoshop or the 
Creative Suite. Bridge has its own folder on your hard drive, inside the 
Applications folder on the Mac and in C:\Program Files for Windows — 
and also the Program Files(x86) folder if you’re running a 64-bit version of 
Windows. (The Photoshop/Bridge you see in the x86 folder is the 32-bit ver-
sion.) You can open Bridge independently, or you can use the Photoshop 
File➪Browse command to launch Bridge, which you see in Figure 4-5. If you 
choose Bridge’s Preferences➪Advanced, you can elect to have Bridge launch 
automatically whenever you log in to your computer.

71
 Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop
Figure 4-5: Adobe Bridge is a separate program for managing and organizing your image files.
Here are a few tips for working with 
Adobe Bridge:
 
✓ Use keywords and categories. 
Using the Keywords tab to the 
lower-right in Bridge’s default 
layout (as shown in Figure 4-6), 
you can assign keywords and 
categories to images. Keywords 
and categories are descriptive 
terms that you assign to individ-
ual images. Down the road, you 
can use the File➪Find command 
to find all images with a specific 
assigned keyword.
 
✓ Select multiple images in 
Bridge. You can have multiple 
images active by clicking and 
Shift+clicking (or Ô+clicking/
Ctrl+clicking) on the image 
Figure 4-6: Assign keywords and categories to 
help organize (and locate) images.

72
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
thumbnails. You might want to select multiple images and then assign 
the same keywords to all the selected images at once.
 
✓ Use labels, ratings, and filters. Under the Label menu, you can assign 
a star rating to each image and assign colors to organize by subject or 
project. Use the View➪Sort menu to arrange images in the thumbnails 
area of Bridge according to either the label or the rating. In the lower-
left of the default workspace, you find the Filter tab. Use that feature 
to locate specific files by showing as thumbnails only those files that 
meet the selected criteria. Want to find a specific JPEG file? Click on that 
format in the Filter tab to hide the thumbnails of all non-JPEG files.
 
✓ Add folders to the Favorites. You invariably will visit some folders on 
a regular basis. Choose File➪Add to Favorites to get back to that folder 
faster and more easily. In the upper-left corner of the Bridge window, 
click the Favorites tab for one-click access. Keep in mind, too, that you 
can add a folder to the Favorites while working on a specific project, and 
then choose File➪Remove from Favorites when the project is finished.
 
✓ Change your view and workspace. Use the View menu to customize 
what the Bridge window shows, and use the Window➪Workspace menu 
to determine how it is displayed. You might find that Compact Mode 
fits your needs better in some circumstances than does Full Mode. And 
don’t overlook Bridge’s Slideshow feature — it can be a great way to 
show off your work! 
 
✓ Use Stacks to organize images. Select similar images or variations on 
the same shot and use Bridge’s menu command Stacks➪Group as Stack. 
All of the selected images are piled into one spot as a single thumbnail, 
with a number in the upper-left corner to indicate how many images are 
stacked together. When you have ten or more images in a stack, you can 
scroll through the thumbnails with a slider that appears when you move 
the cursor over the stack.
 
✓ Zoom with the Loupe. Click in the Preview (in the upper-right corner of 
the default workspace) to zoom in. Drag the cursor to inspect the pre-
view up close and personal.
 
New to Photoshop CS5 is a Mini Bridge panel that provides a Bridge-like tool 
right in Photoshop. You open it with Photoshop’s command File➪Browse 
in Mini Bridge or by clicking the panel’s icon (visible in Photoshop’s default 
layout to the upper-right). Mini Bridge provides a quick and easy way for you 
to work with files and thumbnails without leaving Photoshop (see Figure 4-7). 

73
 Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop
Click to access the Home page.
Figure 4-7: Mini Bridge is an even faster and easier way to 
access folders of images and special features.
Renaming image files easily
All right, then, you’ve arranged a hierarchy of folders and subfolders. You’ve 
sorted your images into those folders. You’ve assigned rank and label to the 
images. However, you still have no idea which is which in the File➪Open 
Recent menu. Filenames such as _MG_1907.CR2 and PB270091.jpg don’t 
tell you much about the image content, do they? Use Bridge’s Tools➪Batch 
Rename command (as shown in Figure 4-8) to assign more meaningful (and 
informative) names to your files. Select content from each field from the 
pop-up menu or type in a field. Click the + button to the right to add more 
elements or variables to each name.

74
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
 
So that each of your origi-
nal images gets a unique 
name, you must include a 
variable when using Batch 
Rename. (If you did try to 
rename all the images in 
a folder to say, picture.
jpg, you would end up 
with only one image file in 
the destination folder — 
each would overwrite 
the previous.) Therefore, 
when using Batch Rename, 
you must choose one of 
the variables for one of 
the fields via the pop-up 
menu, be it the original 
document name or a 
sequence number/letter.
Also keep in mind that you shouldn’t type a period (.) into any field. That 
character should be used only before the file extension. And, as a wonderful 
keep-us-from-creating-problems-for-ourselves improvement, Batch Rename 
automatically adds the file extension for you.
Printing Your Images
In the very recent past, the subject of printing images from Photoshop 
required a huge number of pages. Thankfully, improvements in hardware 
and software make printing much easier. Monitors are well calibrated out of 
the box, printers reproduce color more accurately, and inks and papers last 
for decades. Yes, things have come a long way in a short time. But before 
you click the Print button, you should make sure that your image is ready to 
print. Will it fit properly on the page and in the frame? Are the pixels small 
enough that they blend evenly into the overall picture? Will the colors you 
envision be the colors that appear on paper?
Cropping to a specific aspect ratio
Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of your image. An 
image in landscape aspect ratio is wider than it is tall, and an image in portrait 
aspect ratio is taller than it is wide. Although digital cameras capture in a vari-
ety of aspect ratios, including 3:4 and 4:5, SLR (single lens reflex) cameras typi-
cally use a 3:2 aspect ratio: One side is 1.5 times the size of the adjoining sides. 
Typical print (and picture frame) sizes are 8 x 10 inches (a 4:5 aspect ratio), 
5 x 7 inches (5:7), 4 x 6 inches (3:2), and 3 x 5 inches (3:5). In Figure 4-9, the 3:2 
aspect ratio is outlined in green, 5:7 is shown in yellow, and 4:5 is red.
Figure 4-8: Use Batch Rename to assign informative names 
to files.

75
 Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop
Figure 4-9: Different print sizes encompass different amounts of your image.
 
Although an 8 x 10 print is physically larger than a 4 x 6 print, it may print 
less of your original image because of cropping. The 4 x 6 print, with a 3:2 
aspect ratio, includes all of the original image; the 8 x 10 print (with its 4:5 
aspect ratio) is missing 2 full inches of the image’s longer dimension. To 
print 8 inches wide and retain the entire image, you’d be printing at 8 x 12. 
Of course, if your camera captures in a 4:5 aspect ratio, the problem is 
reversed — the original image fits perfectly into an 8 x 10 print, but won’t fill 
a 4 x 6 print without cropping.
In Photoshop, you can change the aspect ratio of your image with the Canvas 
Size command (if one dimension is already correctly sized), the Crop tool, or 
the Rectangular Marquee tool with the Image➪Crop command. The Crop tool 
can resample your image to the exact print dimensions and resolution in one 
step, but you generally need to use the Image Size command when changing 
aspect ratio with Canvas Size or the Rectangular Marquee. (And see Chapter 
2 for information on Photoshop CS5’s Content-Aware Scale command.)
With the Crop tool selected, you can enter specific dimensions and a target 
resolution on the Options bar. Drag the tool, position and adjust the bound-
ing box, and then press Return/Enter to execute the crop. Whatever is within 
the bounding box is resampled to the exact size that you specify on the 
Options bar. (Remember to click the Clear button on the Options bar after-
ward to restore the Crop tool to its normal behavior.)

76
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
 
When cropping, Photoshop uses the resampling algorithm that you specify in 
Preferences➪General as the Image Interpolation method. For best results, 
choose Bicubic Smoother when increasing an image’s size and Bicubic 
Sharper when decreasing the size.
 
New in Photoshop CS5, the Crop tool offers a couple of helpful overlays in 
the Options bar. You can elect to show a grid or guides showing the Rule 
of Thirds after you drag the bounding box. (The Rule of Thirds — or the 
Suggestion of Thirds as we call it in my studio — is used to help compose 
images. Placing critical elements of the image at the intersections of the 
guide lines often improves the composition of a photo.) Figure 4-10 shows the 
Rule of Thirds option. You may find the Grid option especially useful when 
you need to rotate the crop bounding box.
Figure 4-10: The Crop tool overlays can help when composing an image.
When creating a cropping selection with the Rectangular Marquee tool, you 
can change the tool’s Style pop-up menu (on the Options bar) from Normal 
to Fixed Ratio or Fixed Size. Generally speaking, use Fixed Ratio and drag the 
marquee to encompass that part of the image you want to retain. When the 
selection marquee is how and where you want it, choose Image➪Crop.
 
Keep in mind that the Image➪Crop command doesn’t resample the image — 
you’ve just changed the aspect ratio so far — so you need to also choose 
Image➪Image Size (which is discussed in Chapter 2).
Remembering resolution
Chapter 2 presents you with an in-depth look at resolution as it pertains to 
digital imaging. As a quick refresher, keep these points in mind when thinking 
about printing your images:

77
 Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop
 
✓ Images themselves have no resolution. Whether in your camera, on 
your hard drive, or open in Photoshop, your images consist only of tiny 
colored squares called pixels. The image looks and acts the same within 
Photoshop (except for adding type), regardless of resolution. An image 
3,000 x 2,000 pixels at 300 ppi is handled in Photoshop exactly as an 
image 3,000 x 2,000 pixels at 72 ppi.
 
✓ Resolution is an instruction to a printing device. The resolution value 
that you assign to an image in your digital camera or in Photoshop’s 
Image Size dialog box is recorded with the image strictly as an instruc-
tion to the output device.
 
✓ Resolution measures the size of individual pixels. A resolution of 300 
ppi really means that each pixel will print at a size exactly 1/300 of an 
inch square. Likewise, 72 ppi equates to each pixel printing at 1/72 of 
an inch square. Some folks might find this reasoning uncomfortable 
(although they can deny neither the mathematics nor the logic). Should 
you run across such an individual, feel free to ask this question: “What 
if an image’s resolution is 300 pixels per inch, but the image is only 299 
pixels wide?” Then smile and buy the next round of beverages.
 
✓ Web images use only pixel dimensions. Web browsers aren’t capable 
of reading the resolution information embedded in your simple graph-
ics by Photoshop. Each image is displayed in the Web browser strictly 
according to the number of pixels in the image.
Controlling color using File➪Print 
In the past few years, reproducing accurate color from monitor to printer has 
become much easier. Although the process of color management still strikes 
fear into the hearts of many, the actual need for complex hardware and soft-
ware to control color is greatly reduced. Why? Simply because computer 
manufacturers recognized that we, the consumers, wanted better color. 
(Okay, maybe it was all the video gamers who got the attention.) Monitors 
ship from the factory calibrated and accurate. Printers use smaller droplets 
and better inks. Software does a better job of communicating color.
For most Photoshop users, accurate color is important. After spending hours 
tweaking an image’s appearance on-screen, surely you want the print to look 
exactly like the monitor. Here’s how to get that great color:
 
1. When you’re ready to output your image, choose File➪Print in 
Photoshop.
 
 A large, one-stop-shopping Print dialog box opens (see Figure 4-11).
 
2. Select your printer and the number of copies you want to print.
 
 If your printer supports 16-bit color and the image is in 16-bits/channel 
mode, select the Send 16-bit Data option. You can center the image 
within the printer’s margins or offset the print. You can also elect to 

78
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
scale the image to fit the paper rather than printing at the image’s 
actual size. 
 
3. Set up color management.
 
• In the Color Management section of the dialog box, make sure that 
the Print option is set to Document rather than Proof. Choose your 
options.
 
• In the Color Handling pop-up menu, select Photoshop Manages 
Colors.
Figure 4-11: Photoshop’s Print dialog box offers resizing and color management options.
 
• In the Printer Profile pop-up menu, choose the printer’s profile for 
the paper on which you’re printing.
 
• For Rendering Intent, choose Relative Colorimetric and select the 
Black Point Compensation check box. (If your prints are too dark, 
deselect this option.)
 
 Optional: In the menu to the upper-right, click on Color Management and 
switch the pop-up menu to Output. In this area, you can — if desired — 
add such printable options as crop marks, labels and descriptions, back-
grounds, and borders.
 
4. Click Print Settings to disable the printer’s color management and to 
select the proper paper.

79
 Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop
 
 Because you’re doing all your color management in Photoshop, you 
want to disable all printer-level color management in the printer’s own 
Print dialog box. (Check your printer’s User Guide for specific instruc-
tions.) You’ll also want to make sure that the same paper specified in 
Photoshop is selected in the printer’s Print Settings dialog box. (Unlike 
earlier versions of Photoshop, you no longer see the printer’s own Print 
dialog box unless you click this button.)
 
5. Print.
 
 Clicking the Print button in Photoshop’s Print dialog box sends the image 
to the printer and starts the actual process of putting ink on paper.
 
Don’t forget that Bridge offers you a couple of different ways to save paper 
(and time and money) by printing multiple images on a single sheet of paper. 
See Chapter 16 for full information.
Considering color management solutions
If your prints don’t match your monitor, first evaluate your monitor’s settings. 
Open an image with known color values (you know what the image should look 
like) in a non-color-managed program. You might, for example, open Microsoft 
Word and choose Insert➪Picture➪From File to add the image Ducky.tif from 
the Samples folder (inside the Photoshop folder) or a downloaded color chart to 
a blank document. Use the monitor’s controls to make that image look the best 
possible, and then print. If the image prints accurately, great — you’re all set.
If the monitor looks great but the print is strange, first try cleaning and calibrat-
ing the print head, then print from Photoshop. And take another look at the Print 
dialog box to make sure that you’re selecting the proper paper and color set-
tings. (Again, refer to the User Guide for your printer for specific instructions.)
If your work (or play) requires extreme color fidelity, a number of companies 
offer hardware and software that regulate color. You can create custom pro-
files for monitors, printers, and even scanners and digital cameras. Although 
not inexpensive, skillful handling of these tools (in accordance with the User 
Guides!) not only results in better prints, but also reduces the amount of aw-
shucks wasted paper and ink from bad output. If you fall into this category, 
explore the current offerings from X-Rite (www.xrite.com), PANTONE 
(www.pantone.com), and Datacolor (www.datacolor.com).
 
Keep in mind that all the color management hardware and software in the 
world doesn’t do you a bit of good if you’re not controlling your environment. 
If your work requires perfect color — not good, but perfect — you need to 
take some additional steps. In the office or studio, you need to regulate ambi-
ent light so that you have a consistent color-viewing situation, day in and day 
out, rain or shine, summer and winter. If you have windows, you need shades 
or drapes that you can close before doing color-critical work. The walls visi-
ble behind the monitor and the immediate work area should be neutral in 

80
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
color. (And that means no brightly colored sticky notes on the bezel of your 
monitor!) You probably need a hood for your monitor and perhaps a D50 (or 
D65) viewing station in which to evaluate your prints under optimal lighting 
conditions.
Printing alternatives
Many Photoshop folks use an inkjet printer to put their photos on paper. 
Although inkjet printers are the most popular and perhaps the most practi-
cal, you do have alternatives. If, for example, your work consists mainly of 
brochures and flyers rather than photos, a color laser printer might better 
fit your needs. The initial cost is generally higher than all except wide-format 
inkjets, but the cost per page is much lower. Color laser printers generally 
don’t print photographs as well as a mid- to high-end inkjet, and the prints 
aren’t archival (they won’t last for a whole lot of years without fading), but 
such prints might be just fine for sharing snapshots among friends and 
family. The print options for a color laser printer differ from an inkjet’s 
options. Compare the inkjet options, to the left in Figure 4-12, with those of a 
color laser printer. Take a look at the User Guide for the specific printer you 
use to set up your job correctly.
Check your color (Mac only)
The Mac OS includes a great little program 
called DigitalColor Meter. You’ll find it in the 
Utilities folder (choose Applications➪Utilities). 
Open DigitalColor Meter and position the 
window in the middle part of your screen. Open 
Photoshop. Open the Swatches panel, shown 
in the figure. Move the cursor onto the first 
(red) swatch. If your selected monitor profile 
is accurate and your monitor is working prop-
erly, DigitalColor Meter will show RGB values 
of 255/0/0 (see the figure here). Move the cursor 
over each of the next five swatches, measur-
ing each with DigitalColor Meter. You should 
see Yellow: 255/255/0; Green: 0/255/0; Cyan: 
0/255/255; Blue: 0/0/255; and Magenta: 255/0/255.
If you have an Apple Cinema Display or an Apple 
Studio Display and DigitalColor Meter tells you 
something’s not quite right, try the simple solu-
tion. Open Apple’s System Preferences and 
click Displays. On the Color tab, select Adobe 
RGB as the system-level color profile and then 
close System Preferences. In Photoshop’s 
Color Settings dialog box, select Adobe RGB 
as the RGB Working Space. Open DigitalColor 
Meter again and test the swatches once more.

81
 Chapter 4: Getting Images into and out of Photoshop
Figure 4-12: Color laser printer options (right) differ from those for inkjet printers (left).
Dye sublimation printers use rolls of film impregnated with dyes to reproduce 
prints. Prices for these printers range from less than $200 to several thousand 
dollars. The quality and longevity of the prints is generally tied to the price.
Here’s another output alternative available to virtually all Photoshop users. 
Burn your images in JPEG format (highest quality, 300 ppi) onto a CD and take 
the CD to the local photo lab. Alternatively, use an online service with which 
you upload your JPEGs to the service’s Web service to order prints. (Check 
with the lab or service to see if you need to use the sRGB color profile for your 
images.) You’ll get back glossy or matte prints at the size(s) requested. And 
the cost per print can be substantially less than using your inkjet printer. The 
local photo lab is often a great alternative for stacks of vacation photos and 
family reunion shots that need to be sent to a whole passel of kin.
 
Unless your inkjet printer is specifically designed to generate grayscale 
images, you might want to use the photo lab for such prints. Inkjet printers 
designed with grayscale in mind output using black ink plus one or more 
supplemental light-black or gray inks to increase the tonal range and ensure 
adequate detail in your shadows. Inkjets that aren’t designed to print gray-
scale can either print using only black ink (which severely limits the detail 

82
Part I: Breezing through Basic Training 
and tonal range), or they use rich black (black ink supplemented with the 
additional color inks), which invariably leads to some color tint or color cast 
in the supposedly neutral grayscale images.
Sharing Your Images
Photoshop and Bridge offer a number of nifty ways to make it easy to share 
your images with others. You can simply send a folder of JPEG files to a 
friend or client with instructions to double-click each one to view the images. 
However, there are certainly more elegant ways to showcase your talents.
Creating PDFs and Web sites
Portable Document Format (PDF), the native file format of Adobe Acrobat, 
has become an incredibly useful and near-universal format. It’s hard to find 
a computer that doesn’t have Adobe Reader (free software to open and view 
PDF files) or another PDF-capable program (such as the Mac’s Preview), 
and that helps make PDF a wonderful format for sharing or distributing your 
images.
You can use Bridge’s Output panel to create PDF presentations and multi-
page PDFs to send to others for review or to simply show off your magnifi-
cent imagery. You can also create stand-alone Web sites to post to a Web 
server using the Output panel. You’ll find more information on these sharing 
features in Chapter 16.
E-mailing your images
Remember, too, that you can send images via e-mail. Keep in mind, how-
ever, if you like these folks enough to send them your images, you probably 
want to keep their friendship. And to that end, you want to be a responsible 
e-mailer — you don’t want to send out an e-mail attachment so large that it 
disrupts service for the recipient. (“Hi Marge. You know those images from 
your vacation that you e-mailed me on Tuesday? They’re still trying to down-
load. Yeah, today is Saturday. Anyway, why don’t I drive up to Maine and 
look at the snapshots — it’s probably faster than waiting for the e-mail.”)
 
As a general rule, your attached images should rarely if ever total more than 
1MB in size (unless you verify through direct communication that every-
one on your To: list can handle large attachments). Each image should be 
no more than 550 pixels tall so that it can be viewed in a Web browser on 
any screen. You can certainly use your computer’s compression utility to 
compress one or more images before sending. But if you do compress your 
attached images, make sure to include instructions to save the compressed 
file to the hard drive and double-click to expand.

Enhancements for 
Digital Images

In this part . . .
S
ome photos can be printed straight from the 
camera without ever seeing the light of 
Photoshop. However, most images need at least 
some adjustment, and many need a lot of adjust-
ment. Here’s where you discover how to work 
magic on your images.
The range of brightness from black to white is crit-
ical for most images. In Chapter 5, you read how 
to maximize and adjust that tonal range in your 
photos, and how to maximize your use of the 
Histogram palette. And there’s more to a great 
photo than shadows and highlights. Chapter 6 
looks at adjusting the color in your images, 
making them look as natural as possible. More 
and more digital photographers are switching to 
the Raw ﬁ le format because of the control it pro-
vides over the ﬁ nal image. Read Chapter 7 for the 
Raw lowdown.
Sometimes only part of an image needs to be 
adjusted. The key to making precise adjustments, 
as you can read in Chapter 8, is to tell Photoshop 
where to work with selections and masks. Chapter 9 
examines many of the most common problems in 
Photoshop (and what to do about them). You can 
read about eliminating red-eye, reducing wrinkles, 
whitening teeth, and minimizing digital noise.

t’s the difference between an Ansel Adams print and the snapshot of your 
grandfather as a boy. It’s the difference between premium cable channel 
shows and the local public access channel. It’s the difference between 
a Ferrari and a minivan. It’s that thing — that special something — 
that tells you that you’re seeing the real deal, the genuine 
article, all that it can be. And it’s something that you can 
do for your images.
When an image really pops — when it jumps off the 
page at you — it’s generally because the shadows 
are dark, the highlights are light, and the colors are 
rich. I’m sure it’s no surprise to you that Photoshop 
can handle the job. (That’s one of the reasons why 
you bought the program, right?)
In this chapter, I introduce you to the concept of 
tonality, which is the range of brightness in your 
image. I also introduce to you the various commands 
that Photoshop offers for you to adjust your image’s tonal-
ity. A couple of tools even give you pin-point control of shad-
ows and highlights. And along the way, I offer you a look at the 
Histogram panel — what it tells you, what it doesn’t tell you, and how to use 
it best.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Adjusting Tonality to Make Your Images Pop
Most photos look better with a little tweaking. For pictures that look good to 
begin with, you might still want to perk them up a little with a tonal adjust-
ment. Making the shadows a little darker and the highlights a bit lighter 
increases your image’s perceived tonal range, which is sort of the distance 
between black and white. Take a look at Figure 5-1. It’s a pleasant enough 
snapshot, with decent composition and an interesting subject. But it lacks 
pizzazz.
With Photoshop, you can darken the 
shadows and lighten the rest of the 
image to make it more interesting. By 
intensifying the difference between 
what the eye sees as dark and what 
the eye sees as light in the image, 
you add some semblance of depth 
to this simple picture. Comparing 
Figure 5-1 with Figure 5-2, you can 
see that one basic tonal adjust-
ment can also make the colors seem 
richer and even produce a perceived 
increase in detail or sharpness.
 
You might hear a number of words 
used for the same concept: the light-
ness and darkness of your image. 
Tonality, luminosity, and even 
brightness can be used virtually 
interchangeably when you’re talking 
about the general subject. However, 
you generally use brightness when 
talking about specific pixels and 
tonality when referring to the image 
as a whole.
Histograms Simplified
In most photographs of general subject matter, your eye sees the darkest 
neutral (gray) tone as black and the lightest neutral as white. (If the dark-
est color is obviously purple and the lightest a bright yellow, you probably 
wouldn’t classify the photo’s subject as “general.”) In a given image, the 
shadow under the shoe might be just a dark gray, and the shirt looks like it 
might need some bleach, but your mind (in cooperation with your eye) com-
pensates to some degree and lets you see black and white.

darkens, lightens, enriches color, and brings 
out detail.

87
 Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
For a more accurate look at the tonal range of your image, Photoshop offers 
the Histogram panel, which displays the distribution of the pixels in your 
image at various luminosity values. The darker pixels (shadows) are stacked 
at the left end, the lighter pixels (highlights) are stacked at the right end, and 
the rest of the brightness values (midtones) are stacked between. The taller 
a column in the histogram, the more pixels at that luminosity value. Figure 
5-3 shows an image with what some semi-experienced folks would call a near-
perfect histogram distribution because of the beautiful bell curve centered in 
the graph.
Figure 5-3: This image has a very even distribution of pixels through the midtones.
But don’t be seduced by a histogram distribution! Not every properly 
exposed image has such a bell curve. Many perfect images have wildly dif-
ferent histograms. The correct distribution in the histogram depends on two 
things: the image content and the artistic aims of the artist.
Consider, if you will, an image that consists primarily of white pixels, perhaps 
a beautiful Alpine snow scene or an ugly creepy-crawly thing on porcelain 
(as you can see in Figure 5-4). Either image has a histogram skewed dramati-
cally to the right — what you call a high-key image. Nothing is wrong with 
the image (despite the histogram); it just happens to have a huge number of 
light-colored pixels.

88
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Likewise, a low-key image has a pre-
ponderance of dark pixels, which 
skews the histogram to the left. Just 
about any night scene has a very 
large number of very dark pixels, 
pulling the distribution to the left 
in the histogram. But many night 
scenes also include lights, which 
produce a spike at the far right end.
 
Keep in mind, too, that the heights 
of the individual columns in the 
histogram area are relative: The 
tallest goes all the way to the top of 
the box, and the others are scaled 
accordingly. For example, an image 
on a black background — say, a large 
black background — might have so 
many pixels in the left-most column 
that the other columns in the image 
appear tiny and almost unreadable, 
like the histogram shown in Figure 5-5.
 
If the histogram is skewed to one end 
or the other, making it hard to read, 
you can make a selection within the 
image and the histogram updates 
to show information for only the 
selected area. (Read about making 
selections in Chapter 8.) If the image 
has multiple layers or adjustment 
layers, the little pop-up menu below 
the histogram (when in Expanded 
View mode) enables you to specify 
what layer to calculate.
 
If you see a little warning triangle to 
the upper-right of the histogram data 
in the panel, you’re not necessarily 
seeing accurate information. The histogram is using information from the 
image cache rather than the image. Click the triangle to update the histo-
gram. And, if you choose Preferences➪Performance, you can set the Image 
Cache to 1 to ensure accurate onscreen display and histograms.
Sometimes a histogram seems to tell you absolutely nothing worthwhile. 
For example, take the histogram in Figure 5-6. The image doesn’t have a bell 
curve distribution, with a gentle sloping to either side of the center peak. It’s 
not a high-key image because the pixels aren’t mashed together at the right. 
Figure 5-4: The histogram is skewed to the 
right because of the many white pixels. Or 
maybe it’s trying to escape the spider.
Figure 5-5: Too many pixels in the left-most 
column make the distribution for the midtones 
hard to see.

89
 Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
The image is somewhat low-key, but the histogram 
doesn’t have a huge stack at the left end. It does 
tell you, however, that there are three distinct 
ranges of tonality in which you find most of the 
image’s pixels.
 
Using the menu, opened with the button in the 
upper-right corner of the Histogram panel, you 
can change the panel’s configuration. (So far in 
this chapter, I show the Compact View.) In this 
case, switching to the All Channels View, which 
shows you a histogram for each color channel, helps solve The Mystery of 
the Wacky Histogram, especially when seen with the image itself, as shown in 
Figure 5-7. The image contains a large number of pixels of a rather consistent 
color. If you mixed that color in the kitchen, the recipe would call for one 
part red, two parts green, and four parts blue.
As you read later in this chapter (in the section “Level-headed you!”), you can 
use the histogram to help avoid degrading your image while making adjust-
ments, and (as you can read in Chapter 7) it’s very important for working 
with the Camera Raw plug-in. But don’t forget about your eyeballs — you 
don’t need the Histogram panel to spot a low-key or high-key image.
Figure 5-7: The All Channels View shows individual histograms for each color channel.

sometimes speaks to you in 
riddles.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Using Photoshop’s Auto Corrections
Adjusting the tonality of your image can be as simple as selecting one of the 
Auto commands from Photoshop’s Image menu. With many photos, the tonal-
ity (and even the color) jump to just the right look for your image. No muss, 
no fuss — just a great-looking picture with a single command.
If you need to do something special with the image (for example, create an 
unusual effect) or if the image is in bad shape to begin with, the Auto com-
mands might not be your best bet. But remember this: It never hurts to try 
an Auto command first. At worst, you use the Undo command, and you’ve 
wasted only a couple of seconds and a pair of keystrokes.
From least sophisticated to most, here are your three Auto correction 
choices:
 
✓ Auto Contrast: Auto Contrast makes the dark pixels darker and the light 
pixels lighter, and it tries to avoid introducing any color shift (an overall 
change in the color appearance). The same adjustment is applied to all 
three of your image’s color channels. You can use Auto Contrast with an 
image in which the colors already look good and you perhaps just need 
a bit of a boost to the contrast.
 
✓ Auto Tone: Each of your image’s color channels gets its own adjust-
ment, maximizing the tonal range in the channel. If one of the color chan-
nels has very little to contribute to the original image, a color cast (an 
unwanted tint, as shown in Figure 5-8) might be introduced. Auto Tone is 
fine for most images that look good already and don’t need to have exact 
colors.
 
✓ Auto Color: Rather than using a single bright-
est pixel and a single darkest pixel to deter-
mine what should be white and what should 
be black, Auto Color averages a few pixels at 
each end. That averaging prevents one single 
stray pixel from throwing off the calculation 
used to adjust your image. Auto Color is great 
for most typical images. You might need that 
Undo command, however, on some photos 
with very brightly colored objects or images 
that have extreme color casts.
Levels and Curves and You
Sometimes you need (or simply want) more control than what’s offered by 
the Auto commands. You might have a more demanding problem or a more 
expansive artistic vision. You might need to make major corrections or 
Figure 5-8: The same photo, 
with and without an orange 
color cast.

91
 Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
create stupendous effects. Photoshop, not surprisingly, offers that sort of 
control over your image. In fact (and also not surprisingly), you have several 
ways at your disposal to manipulate the tonality of your images. Two of the 
most commonly used are Levels and Curves, both found in the Adjustments 
panel (see Chapter 8) and the Image➪Adjustments menu.
Before I introduce you to those two commands, let me quickly explain and dis-
miss a couple of other available options, one at the very top of the Adjustments 
menu, the other at the very bottom. Since the early days of Photoshop, the 
Brightness/Contrast command has lurked among the Image➪Adjustments 
commands. In fact, it was the image adjustment command way back when. 
Now, however, the feature is somewhat lacking in control and sophistication 
and is perhaps of most use when fine-tuning an alpha channel or layer mask. 
Although its behavior is vastly improved from the early days, it is still a two-
slider adjustment. But if you’re an old-timer and absolutely love that old-time 
behavior of the Brightness/Contrast adjustment, click on the Use Legacy box 
to restore the older adjustment performance. (Alpha channels are discussed 
in Chapter 8, and layer masks appear in Chapter 10.) In both alpha channels 
and layer masks, you use a grayscale representation to identify specific areas 
of your image. Brightness/Contrast is perfectly adequate for many adjustments 
that you might make to those channels.
Also of limited use is the Equalize adjustment. It finds the lightest pixel in 
the image and calls that white and also finds the darkest pixel and calls that 
black. The rest of the pixels in the image are distributed between those 
values, creating an extended tonal range. In practice, you’ll find that the 
adjustment results in extreme highlights and extreme shadows, with a rather 
garish image overall as well as a lack of details in the midtones.
 
Always keep in mind that you don’t have to make changes to the entire image. 
If only part of an image needs repair, make a selection of that area before 
opening the particular adjustment dialog box you want to use. (Read about 
making selections to isolate areas of your image in Chapter 8.) Say, for exam-
ple, that you take a beautiful photo of a room in your house — “beautiful” 
except that the view out the window is far too bright. Isolate the window with 
a selection, and then use one of your image adjustment commands to tone it 
down.
Level-headed you!
The Image➪Adjustments➪Levels command (Ô+L/Ctrl+L), or adding a Levels 
adjustment layer (discussed in Chapter 8), gives you control over shadows, 
highlights, and your image’s overall tonality individually. Using a slider with 
three controls, you adjust the picture both to suit your eye, and with an eye 
on a histogram for reference. You even have numeric fields in which you can 
type exact values, should you find the need.

92
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
 
To perform the basic Levels correction, spreading the image’s tonality over 
the full range of values available, you simply drag the slider controls under the 
histogram in the Levels dialog box inward until they’re under the point where 
the histogram begins to rise in a mountain shape. Ignore those little flat tails 
that extend outward — they represent individual stray pixels — and drag the 
little pointers under columns that are at least a few pixels tall. The histogram 
in the Levels dialog box (as shown in Figure 5-9) is for reference as you make 
changes. Note, however, that while you work in Levels, the Histogram panel 
updates, showing you the “after” in black, with the “before” histogram in color.
 
Dragging the middle slider to the right moves the bulk of the histogram 
toward the left, indicating that the overall appearance of the image is slightly 
darker. Dragging the middle slider to the left lightens the overall image.
Also note the lower Output Levels slider in Figure 5-9. You generally use that 
only when preparing an image for a commercial printing press that requires 
you to compress the image’s tonal range or when preparing to create a gallery 
print with a high-end inkjet printer. Otherwise, ignore that slider and its two 
fields except for special effects. And make a mental note of that pop-up menu 
at the top of the Levels dialog box — you can apply Levels to each color chan-
nel of your image individually, changing this tonal adjustment tool to a color 
correction feature. (Fixing the color in your image is covered in Chapter 6.)
Defining white and black
The Options button in the Levels (and Curves) 
dialog box opens a door through which you 
might never need to walk. However, should your 
path lead you to that door, I want you to know 
what lies behind. Neither pit nor tiger awaits 
you, only the possibility of controlling your high-
lights and shadows — or making a total mess of 
your image, of course. (Adobe does a good job 
of hiding those it-could-cost-me-a-fortune-if-I-
screw-it-up features.) The Options button gives 
you control over the behavior of the Auto button 
(in both Levels and Curves), but I suggest that 
you leave the defaults alone. Even more impor-
tant, the Options button lets you define what 
colors Photoshop should use for the lightest 
pixels and for the darkest pixels. That’s right: 
White and black are not always the same.
Generally speaking, if you print to an inkjet, 
you want the full tonal range of the printer, so 
you should leave white and black set to the 
extremes, as far apart as possible. However, if 
you’re creating gallery prints, you might want 
to change the definition of “white” from RGB 
255/255/255 to RGB 245/245/245 to ensure that 
you produce 100 percent ink coverage, with no 
paper showing through in the highlights. You 
can use a Levels adjustment or adjustment 
layer, dragging the lower-right slider control to 
the left to 245.
If you want to make semi-permanent changes 
to your highlight and shadow values (you can 
always restore the defaults later), perhaps in 
response to a request from a print shop, open 
Levels (or Curves), click the Options button, 
click the highlight (white) color swatch to open 
the Color Picker, and then input the suggested 
values. Click OK and then repeat for the shadow 
swatch. Make sure to click the buttons that 
retain the values as your defaults as you OK 
your way back out of all those dialog boxes.

93
 Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
Figure 5-9: Compare the Levels histogram and the Histogram panel.
 
When you’re working in Levels (or just about any dialog box), remember that 
holding down the Option/Alt key changes the Cancel button to Reset. When 
you click Reset, all values in the dialog box are restored to the defaults, let-
ting you start over without having to cancel and reselect the command.
Earlier in this chapter, I mention that you can use the Histogram panel 
to avoid introducing problems into the image. Note in Figure 5-9 that the 
Histogram panel shows slight gaps appearing among the darker columns in 
front. Technically called posterization, these gaps represent tonal values that 
are being squished together into a single value. The pixels at one brightness 
level are being shifted to the next higher or the next lower value, leaving that 
empty column in the Histogram. Is this a problem? No, as long as you don’t 
see wide gaps, representing a number of consecutive tonal values not in use. 
(Extensive posterization ruins the subtle transitions between colors in your 
image.) And that’s why you want to keep an eye on the Histogram panel — to 
make sure you’re not creating wide gaps in the histogram and noticeable 
posterization in your image.
 
Here is an easy way to minimize that posterization, one that lets you make 
your Levels adjustment but keep a pretty histogram. Immediately after using 
Levels, choose Edit➪Fade Levels and change the blending mode from Normal 
to Luminosity. As you see in Figure 5-10, the posterization goes away with a 
minimal change in the effect of the Levels adjustment. Remember that the 

94
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Fade command is available only immediately after applying an adjustment (or 
filter or tool) — you can’t even use the Save command between. (Read more 
about the Fade command in Chapter 15.)
Figure 5-10: Change the Levels adjustment blending mode to 
Luminosity with the Fade dialog box.
Tonal corrections with the eyedroppers
The Levels dialog box (and the Curves dialog box, too) offers another way to 
make tonal corrections to your image — sort of a half-automated technique, 
using the three eyedroppers in the right side of the dialog box. Open your 
image, open the Levels dialog box, and correct both tonality and color in 
your image with three little clicks:
 
1. Click the left eyedropper on something that should be black.
 
 This might be a shadow, a piece of clothing, or the tire of a car. 
Generally, you click something in the image that’s already quite dark.
 
2. Click the right eyedropper on something that should be white.
 
 A cloud, the bride’s dress, perhaps an eye . . . all are likely targets for the 
highlight eyedropper. You usually click something that’s already quite light.
 
3. Click the middle eyedropper on something that should be gray.
 
 Click something that should be neutral in color (should be, not already 
is). It doesn’t have to be mid gray, just something that should be neutral. 
This reduces or eliminates any unwanted color cast in the image. If you 
don’t like the result, click somewhere else in the image. Keep clicking 
until the colors in the image look right.
In Figure 5-11, the shadow under the bridge, the splash of water, and the weath-
ered wood of the bridge itself provide excellent targets for the three eyedroppers.

95
 Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
 Figure 5-11: Use the eyedroppers in Levels to set the black and white 
points; then neutralize your image’s colors.
 
Here’s another way to adjust color using Levels. Duplicate the image layer and 
apply the Blur➪Average filter. The layer becomes a solid color. Open the 
Levels dialog box. Click in the layer with the middle eyedropper and click OK. 
Delete that blurred layer. This technique doesn’t work with every image (such 
as extremely bright, super-saturated images), but it does a great job on most.
Adjusting your curves without dieting
One step up from Levels in complexity, and about five steps ahead in terms 
of image control, is Image➪Adjustments➪Curves (Ô+M/Ctrl+M). The Curves 
dialog box has a pair of slider controls (similar to the left and right sliders 
in Levels) to easily control the endpoints of your shadows and highlights. 
The curve line itself gives you control over various parts of the tonal range 
independently. Curves also offers eyedroppers for tonal and color correction. 
They’re used the same way you use the eyedroppers in Levels.
At the very beginning of this chapter, I show you how a simple tonal adjust-
ment can add some drama and some interest to a rather bland image. 
Figure 5-12 shows you the simple Curves adjustment that I applied to that 
image. Dragging the curve downward in the shadows makes them darker; 
dragging upward for the highlights makes them brighter. The midtones (that 
section of the tonal range between shadows and highlights) have improved 
contrast using this adjustment.
When you first open the Curves dialog box, you see a graph with a diagonal 
line running from an anchor point in the lower left to another in the upper 
right. You can click and drag that line up or down (not sideways) to add 
anchor points and make changes in the curve (and in your image). By default, 

96
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
the shadows are in the 
lower left, so dragging 
down darkens, and drag-
ging up lightens. (In the 
Curves Display Options 
area, switching from 
Light to Pigment/Ink will 
reverse the shadows/
highlights. Use this option 
when preparing CMYK 
images for page layout 
programs.) You can add 
more than a dozen anchor 
points to the curve — 
although you generally 
need only between one 
and three new points.
Most snapshots can benefit from a slight tweak in Curves. Click at the inter-
section of the first vertical and horizontal gridlines in the lower left (the 
three-quarter tones) and drag down slightly. The Input field should read 64, 
and the Output field should be somewhere between 55 and 60 for a shot that 
looks pretty good to start. Next, click at the intersection of the grid lines in 
the upper right (the quarter tones) and drag up slightly. The Input field should 
show 192, and the Output field can be anywhere from 195 to 205. This is 
called a basic S-curve.
 
Both the Curves and Levels dialog boxes offer you the Load and Save options 
using the menu button to the right of the Preset menu. If there’s a correction 
that you’ll use more than once or a correction that needs to be precise time 
after time, use Save. Then, later, you can click Load to apply that adjustment 
to another image. If, for example, you used the wrong setting in your camera 
while taking a series of shots all under the same lighting conditions, they 
probably all need the same correction. Make the adjustment once, save it, 
and then apply it to the other images with the Load button.
 
If you want to correct a specific area in the image, move the cursor into the 
image window (where it appears as the Eyedropper tool). Hold down the 
mouse button and you’ll see a circle on the curve, telling you where those 
pixels fall in the tonal range. To add an anchor point there, Ô+click/Ctrl+click 
in the image. New to Photoshop CS5 is the great big circle surrounding the 
eyedropper when you click and hold down the mouse button, as shown in 
Figure 5-13. The inner circle shows the color directly under the cursor as 
you drag in the top half, whereas the lower half of the circle shows the previ-
ous color on which you clicked. If you find that behavior more distracting 
than helpful, hold down the Option/Alt key to switch to a plain circle. (When 
adding a Curves adjustment layer, make sure the adjustment layer’s mask is 
not active in the Layers panel.)
Figure 5-12: A simple S-curve adjustment makes the image 
more dramatic.

97
 Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
Figure 5-13: The top half of the colored circle shows the color currently 
under the cursor; the bottom shows the previous color on which 
you clicked.
Curves offers the option to adjust the curve by clicking and dragging right in 
the image window. Activate the on-screen adjustment option by clicking the 
button to the lower-left of the grid in the Curves dialog box or to the upper-
left of the grid when adding a Curves adjustment through the Adjustments 
panel. With the on-screen adjustment option active, click in the image 
window on an area that needs improvement and drag upward to lighten or 
downward to darken. The adjustment is applied 
to the entire image or selection, not just the area 
where you click. (Working with the Adjustments 
panel is discussed in Chapter 8.)
When your curve has multiple anchor points, the 
active anchor point shows as a filled-in square. 
Deselected anchor points are hollow squares. For 
precision, you can use the arrow keys to move 
the active anchor point, or you can type specific 
values in the Input field (starting position for the 
anchor point) and Output field (where you want 
the anchor point to go).
Option+click/Alt+click in the grid area to toggle 
between a 4 x 4 grid and a 10 x 10 grid or 
expand the Curve Display Options and use the 
two grid buttons to switch back and forth. And, 
rather than clicking and dragging on the curve, 
you can activate the Pencil tool and draw your 
curve by hand (as shown with a Curves adjust-
ment in the Adjustments panel in Figure 5-14). 
Figure 5-14: Hand-draw a curves 
adjustment with the Pencil tool.

When hand-drawing your curve, the Smooth button is available, too, to 
ensure that the transitions in your tonal adjustments aren’t too severe.
Grabbing Even More Control
The Image➪Adjustments menu in Photoshop includes a couple more 
extremely powerful ways to work with tonality in your images. You can use the 
Shadow/Highlight adjustment to isolate and change whatever range of dark 
and light pixels you want. By specifying what range of tonal values that you 
want to be considered dark or light, you control how broadly or narrowly your 
change is applied. The Exposure feature lets you change the overall tonality 
of the image, much as if you’d taken the photo with a different camera setting. 
And don’t forget about making spot corrections with the Dodge and Burn tools!
 
New in Photoshop CS5 is the Image➪Adjustments➪HDR Toning command. 
Although it could be used with images in 8-bit and 16-bit color, it’s really 
designed — like the Exposure adjustment — to be used with 32-bit/channel 
high dynamic range images. You can read about HDR (and HDR Toning) in 
Chapter 20.
 
The Shadow/Highlight and Exposure adjustments are not the same as work-
ing with Raw images in the Camera Raw plug-in (see Chapter 7). Camera Raw 
works with unprocessed image data, the so-called digital negative. Using 
Photoshop’s Adjustment commands, you’re working with image data that has 
already been manipulated in the camera, in Photoshop, or both. When work-
ing with unprocessed data in Camera Raw, you truly have control over the 
exposure, the shadows, the highlights, and much more.
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is not available as an adjustment layer. 
Changes that you make with the Shadow/Highlight feature are a permanent 
part of your image.
Using Shadow/Highlight
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is designed to rescue two specific sorts 
of images — you’ve seen them (and maybe taken them): The background is 
perfectly exposed, and the subject in the foreground is in horrible shadow. 
Or, equally bad, the background looks great, but the subject is washed out by 
a strong flash. (See both examples in Figure 5-15.) By controlling the shadows 
and highlights separately from the rest of the image, this feature helps you 
restore more balance to the image.
The default settings in Shadow/Highlight are intended to repair backlighting 
problems, as you see on the left in Figure 5-15. When the foreground lacks 
detail because of flash (as you can see in the top dog image on the right), 
minimize changes to the shadows and drag the Highlights slider to the right. 

99
 Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
And, as shown in Figure 5-16, with Show More Options selected, Shadows/
Highlights gives you incredible control over images that have problems at 
both ends of the tonal range.
Figure 5-15: Shadow/Highlight does a rather good job with these very common problems.
Figure 5-16: Some images need help for both shadows and highlights.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
 
In the Shadows/Highlights dialog box, the Shadows slider lightens the darker 
areas of your image, and the Highlights slider darkens the lighter areas. 
Generally, you’ll use one slider or the other to fix a specific problem in an 
image, but you can use both if you need to lighten shadows and tone down 
highlights in the same image.
When you enable the Show More Options check box, Shadow/Highlight has a 
rather intimidating set of controls. Not to worry! It’s actually pretty simple:
 
✓ Amount: For both Shadows and Highlights, the Amount slider is how 
much of a correction you’re making. This is the nuts and bolts of the 
Shadow/Highlight adjustment. For a backlit subject, you’ll use the 
Shadows slider a lot and not the Highlights slider. When working with a 
washed-out subject, you’ll probably move the Shadows slider to 0% and 
work with the Highlights slider.
 
✓ Tonal Width: Use the Tonal Width sliders to specify how much of the 
image’s tonal range you want to include as shadows or highlights. If 
you drag either Tonal Width slider to 100%, you’re working on the 
entire tonal range of the image — not a particularly appropriate job for 
Shadow/Highlight (use Curves instead). The default of 50% is rather too 
high most of the time. Instead, start your adjustment with a range of per-
haps 20% and fine-tune from there.
 
✓ Radius: You adjust the Radius sliders to tell Shadow/Highlight which 
pixels should be identified as being in the shadow or highlight. With 
too low of a Radius setting, an individual black pixel stuck in the middle 
of a light area in your image might get classified as a shadow area. Too 
high of a setting has a tendency to apply the adjustment to the entire 
image. Generally speaking, start with a Radius of perhaps 10 pixels for 
very small images and 30 pixels for large digital photos. After adjusting 
your Amount and Tonal Width sliders, move the Radius slider back and 
forth while watching some of the smaller patches of shadow or highlight 
(whichever you’re correcting) to make sure that those areas are being 
included in the adjustment.
 
✓ Color Correction/Brightness: This slider changes its name to match your 
image’s color mode. When working with a color image, you see Color 
Correction. When you apply Shadow/Highlight to a grayscale image, the 
slider’s name changes to Brightness. Don’t bother with this slider until 
you make your Amount adjustment. In a color image, lightening the shad-
ows or darkening the highlights shows the actual color of the pixels in 
those areas. Use this slider to increase (drag to the right) or decrease 
(drag to the left) the saturation of those pixels. Remember that Color 
Correction works only on the pixels that you identify with the Tonal Width 
and Radius sliders. (If you set both sets of Tonal Width and Radius sliders 
to 0%, Color Correction has no effect on the image at all.) When you cor-
rect a grayscale image, on the other hand, the Brightness slider affects all 
pixels except those that are already pure white or pure black.

101
 Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
 
✓ Midtone Contrast: You can increase or decrease the contrast through-
out the image with the Midtone Contrast slider. Much like clicking in the 
middle of the curve in the Curves dialog box and dragging up or down, 
you adjust the whole range of your image, including the shadows and 
highlights. When the overall appearance of your image needs improve-
ment, start with Midtone Contrast and then work with your shadows 
and highlights individually.
 
✓ Clip: Most of the time, you don’t want to change the clipping values. 
Clipping takes pixels that are almost black and forces them to pure black, or 
it takes pixels that are almost white and forces them to pure white. Clipping 
your shadows or highlights reduces those subtle differences in color that 
provide the detail in the shadows and highlights. When would you want 
to clip shadows or highlights? When you don’t care about detail in those 
areas of your image and need more contrast through the midtones.
Changing exposure after the fact
Photoshop also offers the Exposure feature in the Image➪Adjustments menu. 
It simulates how the image would have looked if you changed the exposure 
setting on your camera before clicking the shutter. Think of it as an across-
the-board adjustment of tonality in the image or within a selection in the 
image. Even a minor adjustment can have a major impact on the image!
The Offset and Gamma Correction sliders are designed primarily to work with 
very high-bit images (the special 32-bit/channel high dynamic range images), 
and you likely will find them too sensitive to be of much use for most images. 
Exposure is a rather specialized tool, and you probably won’t find it nearly 
as user friendly or effective as Curves and Shadow/Highlight. If you do actu-
ally work with 32-bit/channel images, take it for a test drive; you might decide 
that it fills a need.
Using Photoshop’s toning tools
You have a couple more ways to work with tonality in Photoshop — the 
toning tools. These two brush-using tools let you paint corrections on your 
image, giving you incredible control over the appearance. Select the Burn 
tool to darken or the Dodge tool to lighten. Select a brush tip in the Options 
bar and drag the tool in your image to apply the correction. (You can read 
about controlling the brush-using tools and that incredibly complex Brush 
panel in Chapter 14.) In Figure 5-17, you see the Burn tool darkening a spe-
cific area of the fence on the right.
 
The Dodge tool is great for minimizing (without removing) shadows in an 
image. You’ll find it particularly useful for reducing wrinkles in faces and 
other such jobs that require lightening specific areas of an image. Figure 5-18 
compares the original (left) with a working copy in which I’m using the Dodge 

102
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
tool to reduce the appearance of the wrinkles. By reducing rather than elimi-
nating those wrinkles completely, I retain the character of the man’s face as 
well as prevent that phony, just-out-of-plastic-surgery look.
Figure 5-17: “Painting” the fence with the Burn tool. Where is Tom Sawyer when I need him?
 
The Dodge and Burn tools offer a 
couple of new options. In almost 
all circumstances, you should acti-
vate the Protect Tones option in 
the Options bar. With this option 
selected, the tools do a much better 
job of protecting color and retain-
ing detail in shadows and highlights. 
To the right in the Options bar is a 
button you can use to enable pres-
sure sensitivity when you’re working 
with a Wacom tablet, overriding any 
pressure-sensitivity setting in the 
Brush panel.
Figure 5-18: Use the Dodge tool to minimize 
wrinkles without removing them.

103
 Chapter 5: Adding Dark Shadows and Sparkling Highlights
 
For most of the work that you do with the Dodge and Burn tools, the default 
Exposure setting of 50% is way too strong. In the Options bar, reduce the 
Exposure to about 15–20% for most work. And unless you’re specifically 
working on lightening shadows or toning down highlights, set the tools’ 
Range to Midtones in the Options bar.

n the end (and the middle and the beginning), your image in Photoshop 
is nothing but little squares of color. Each square — each pixel — can be 
exactly one color. Which color for which square is up to you. I’ll say it again: 
There is no car or circle or tree or Uncle Bob in your Photoshop image — just 
a bunch of little squares of color.
In this chapter, I explain how those squares of color are formulated, 
how Photoshop works with those formulations, and — most 
important — how you can manipulate the colors of those 
squares. Toward the end of the chapter, you read about 
one of the biggest color-related challenges in Photoshop: 
achieving accurate skin color.
What Is Color in Photoshop?
Photoshop works with digital images (including 
digital photos, images that have been digitized with 
a scanner, and artwork that you create from scratch 
in Photoshop). The digits are the computer code 
used to record the image’s information. The number 
of pixels, the color of each pixel, and any associated 
information are all recorded in a series of zeros and ones 
on your hard drive. Color, therefore, is nothing more than 
numbers — at least as far as Photoshop is concerned. For you 
and me, however, color is far more than binary code on a hard drive. It’s the 
image, the artwork, the message. The artwork is the color, and color is the 
artwork, pixel by pixel.

106
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Color modes, models, and depths
Photoshop records the color of each pixel in your image in any of several dif-
ferent ways. Every pixel in any given image has all color recorded in a single 
color mode, which is the actual color format for the image file. While working 
with your image, however, you can define specific colors in any of a variety 
of color models, which are sort of the formula or recipes with which you mix 
color. And an image can have only one color depth, which is the limitation on 
the number of colors in an image.
Before I get into too many details, you need to understand one of the basic 
concepts of color: gamut. Consider gamut to be the range of colors that can 
be theoretically reproduced in a specific color mode or with a specific color 
profile. A wide gamut, therefore, has many more colors available than does 
a limited gamut. Those extra colors are generally the brighter, more vibrant 
colors . . . the ones that make an image come alive. The red/green/blue (RGB) 
color mode generally offers you a wider range of colors than does cyan/
magenta/yellow/black (CMYK). See, for example, the comparison in Figure 6-1, 
paying particular attention to the purples and yellows. And keep in mind that 
the specific color profile (the working space that you select; see Chapter 4) 
also has an impact on the colors in your image.
Figure 6-1: A wide-gamut image (on the left) and the same picture with a smaller gamut.

107
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
Which color mode should you choose?
If you’ll be printing to an inkjet printer, sending photos to a lab for prints, 
or posting your image on the Web, you need RGB color mode. (Despite the 
CMYK inks that you load into your inkjet printer, the printer’s software 
expects and must receive RGB color data.) If you’re prepping an image for 
inclusion in an InDesign document destined for a commercial offset press, 
you need CMYK. You select the image’s color mode from the Image➪Mode 
menu. That’s the simple summary. Here’s a bit more detail, presented in the 
order in which you’re likely to need the various color modes:
 
✓ RGB: RGB is the color mode for digital photos, computer monitors, the 
World Wide Web, and inkjet printers. All colors are recorded as propor-
tions of the three component colors, red, green, and blue. RGB color is 
recorded in the three color channels (described a bit later in this chap-
ter). RGB is an additive color mode — that is, the more of each compo-
nent color you add, the closer you get to white.
 
✓ CMYK: CMYK is used primarily for printing on a commercial offset 
press, but you might need it for a color laser printer or a high-end inkjet 
printer with which you use a RIP (raster image processor, which is a spe-
cialized bit of hardware or software that lets your inkjet pretend it’s a 
printing press). CMYK is the color mode of magazines, books, and other 
mass-produced printed material, such as the example in Figure 6-2. 
CMYK is a subtractive color mode — that is, the less of each component 
color you have, the closer you are to white.
 
✓ Grayscale: When most people talk about a black-and-white photo, they 
really mean grayscale. The image does contain black and white but also 
a wide range of grays in between. You might use grayscale mode for 
Web-based images or for prints. Keep in mind that unless your inkjet 
printer is designed to reproduce grayscale images with black and gray 
inks (or black and light-black inks), you probably won’t be happy with 
grayscale output. Using just one black ink doesn’t reproduce the full 
range of grays in the image. Using the color inks adds a tint to the image. 
You do have an alternative for grayscale images: Send them to the local 
photo lab for printing.
 
✓ Indexed Color: Using a color table, or a list of up to 256 specific colors, 
Indexed Color mode is for the Web. You save GIF and PNG-8 images in 
Indexed Color, but only those file formats require such a limited number 
of colors. Things like buttons on your Web page, which need only a 
couple of colors, should be created as GIFs using Indexed Color mode. 
That keeps the file size down, reducing the amount of space the image 
requires on your Web server and also speeding the download time (how 
long it takes for the image to appear on your site-visitor’s monitor).

108
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 6-2: You typically use CMYK images for bulk-print materials.
 
✓ Lab: Also known as L*a*b and CIELAB (and pronounced either lab, as 
the dog or a research facility, or verbally spelled out, as el-ay-be), this is 
a color mode that you might use when producing certain special effects 
or using certain techniques in Photoshop, but it’s not one in which you’ll 
save your final artwork. The three channels in a (or “an”) Lab image are
 
• Lightness, which records the brightness of each pixel
 
• a, which records the color of the pixel on a green-to-red axis
 
• b, which records each pixel’s color value on a blue-to-yellow axis
 
 You shouldn’t print Lab images on an inkjet or post them on your Web 
site. You might see (not in this book!) a tip that you should convert your 
RGB or CMYK images to Lab mode before using one of Photoshop’s 
Sharpen filters. Bah! Apply the Sharpen filter, choose Edit➪Fade Unsharp 
Mask (or Fade Smart Sharpen — the Fade command changes its name to 
match the last-used filter), and change the blending mode from Normal 
to Luminosity. Same result, less work, and less potential for degradation 
of your image.

109
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
 
✓ Duotone: Duotone (including tritone and quadtone) is a very specialized 
color mode, exclusively for commercial printing, that uses only two (or 
three or four) inks spread throughout your image. Although that might 
sound good for an inkjet printer, in fact, Duotone is not an acceptable 
color mode for inkjets. Duotone images require that specific premixed 
inks are poured into the presses, which isn’t something that you can do 
to your inkjet.
 
✓ Multichannel: Like Duotone, the Multichannel color mode is restricted 
to commercial printing because it depends on specific premixed colors 
of ink that are applied to the paper. Unlike Duotone, in which the inks 
are generally spread across the page, Multichannel images use certain 
inks in certain areas. You might need 
Multichannel mode when creating a 
logo for a client.
 
✓ Bitmap: Bitmap color mode is true 
black and white (as you see in Figure 
6-3). Each pixel is either black or white. 
The placement of the black and white 
pixels produces shading, but the image 
doesn’t really have any gray pixels. 
You might use Bitmap mode to create 
images for some wireless devices, use 
on the Web, or commercial print, but 
that’s about it.
 
Converting between color modes or gamuts (done with the Image➪Mode 
menu) can reduce the quality of your image by compressing variations of a 
color into a single color value. You would not, for example, want to convert 
from RGB (which has a comparatively large number of colors available) to 
CMYK (with a more restricted color gamut) and then back to RGB. After 
colors are compressed by a conversion, you can’t restore their original 
values by converting back to a wider gamut.
Does a color model make a difference?
Although the image itself has a single color mode, you can use any of the 
available color models when defining a color in Photoshop. Say, for example, 
that you’re preparing to use the Brush tool to paint some artistic elements 
for your latest project. The project is in RGB mode because you’ll be print-
ing it with your inkjet printer. You can use the Color panel to define your 
foreground color any way you please — RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, Lab, or even 
HSB (hue/saturation/brightness, which isn’t available as a color mode, just a 
color model). It doesn’t matter how you set up the Color panel, which you do 
through the panel’s menu, as shown in Figure 6-4. When you add the color to 
your image, Photoshop uses the nearest RGB (or CMYK) equivalent.
Figure 6-3: Bitmap images contain 
only black and white pixels; no grays, 
no colors.

110
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Notice that the Color panel menu 
in Figure 6-4 doesn’t list Duotone or 
Multichannel. Those are color modes 
only, not color models. A couple of 
other things to note about working 
with the Color panel: The warning 
triangle visible in Figure 6-4 in the 
lower-left corner of the panel indi-
cates that the selected color is out-
side the CMYK color gamut. (Clicking 
the swatch to the right would select 
the nearest equivalent color. If, 
that is, you were actually working 
in CMYK mode.) Also note that the 
background swatch is selected in 
the panel, highlighted with a black 
outline — click the foreground 
swatch to make changes to the 
foreground color.
Why should you worry about color depth?
Color depth is the actual number of different colors that you have available. 
(Remember that each pixel can be only one color at any time.) When you work 
in 8-bit/channel color, simply called 8-bit color, each of the component colors is 
recorded with exactly 8 bits of information in the computer file. (At the begin-
ning of this chapter, I mention digits. These are the actual numbers — the zeros 
and ones recorded on the hard drive to track each pixel’s color.) In an 8-bit RGB 
image, each pixel’s color is recorded with three strings of eight characters. When 
you work with 16-bit/channel, or 16-bit color, each of the component colors is 
recorded with 16 characters. The larger numbers mean more possible ways to 
record each color, which means more possible variations of color (as well as 
files that take up more space on your hard drive).
What that means to you, in practical terms, is possibly a better-looking image 
when working in 16-bit color. You’ll have smoother transitions between 
colors throughout your image, no banding in gradients (those annoying areas 
in a gradient where you can actually see one color stop and the next color 
start), and no splotchy shadows. Posterization, which I explain in Chapter 5, 
is the degradation of your image’s appearance when similar colors are forced 
to the same color, making transitions between colors more abrupt. Many 
tonal and color corrections that produce posterization in your 8-bit images 
won’t harm a 16-bit image in the least. Take a look at Figure 6-5. To the left, a 
Levels adjustment is increasing a 16-bit image’s tonal range. When the same 
adjustment is applied to an 8-bit version of the image, some rather substan-
tial posterization becomes visible in the Histogram panel (represented by the 
gaps in the histogram).
Figure 6-4: Choose your preferred color model 
from the Color panel menu.

111
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
 
Some of the top inkjet 
printers, when printing on 
a Mac, can process and 
use 16-bit color — but 
unless Photoshop’s Print 
dialog box offers the Send 
16-Bit Data option (shown 
in Figure 6-5), you won’t 
be using more than 8 bits 
of color data.
So, should you use 16-bit 
color all the time? No. 
You can’t post a 16-bit 
image on the Web, and 
16-bit color is rarely used 
for CMYK images. Digital 
photos taken in JPEG 
format are 8-bit because 
that file format doesn’t 
support 16-bit color. And unless you’re using a 16-bit capable inkjet printer, 
you won’t see any improvement in the final print. You might, however, see a 
dramatic increase in printing time because there’s twice as much image data 
to process.
If you shoot in 16-bit color, whether TIFF or Raw, it makes sense to process 
the image in 16-bit color. When the image is perfect, you might want to 
convert a copy of the file to 8-bit color for printing (Image➪Mode➪8-Bits/
Channel). You might find some situations in which you’ll convert an 8-bit 
image to 16-bit. Switching from 8-bit to 16-bit doesn’t help you avoid poster-
ization, but it might reduce banding if you add a sizable gradient.
One other note on color depth: Photoshop can work with 32-bit/channel 
images. These monstrous files are called high dynamic range (HDR) images 
and are typically constructed by combining different exposures of the same 
photo. Chapter 20 takes a look at HDR.
Recording color in your image
All your image’s color data is saved in the Channels panel. When you’re 
working with RGB or CMYK images, each color channel holds information 
for one of the component colors (red/green/blue or cyan/magenta/yellow/
black). Each channel is a grayscale version of the image as a whole, using 
shades of gray, from white to black, to indicate where that channel’s color 
appears (and how strongly) in the image. In RGB images, the lighter the pixel 
in a channel, the more of that color. When you work with a CMYK image, the 
light-dark in a channel is reversed, with darker areas showing where more of 
that color is applied.

posterization (right).

Making Color Adjustments in Photoshop
Sometimes you have an image that needs some help in the color department. 
It might have been shot with an incorrect camera setting, it might have a 
color cast (an unwanted tint of a specific color), or it might just be dull and 
dingy. Photoshop provides you with an incredible array of commands and 
tools to make the colors in your images look just right. You’ll hear the term 
color correction being tossed about, but not all images have incorrect color. 
Some have very good color that can be great color. Instead of color correc-
tion, I like to think in terms of color improvement. And just about every image 
can use a little tweaking to improve its color.
How do you know when the color is right? Your primary tool for the job is in 
your head. Literally. Make your decisions based primarily on what your eyes 
tell you. Sure, you can check the Info panel and the Histogram panel to make 
sure that your shadows are black and your highlights are white, but adjust 
your images until they look good to you — until you’re satisfied with the color.
 
That little bomb symbol to the left of this paragraph is a little scary, but it 
does get your attention, doesn’t it? This isn’t a your-computer-will-blow-up 
sort of warning but more of a you-don’t-want-to-waste-your-time-and-effort 
warning. Do your tonal adjustments before you start working with the 
image’s colors. Go through the procedures in Chapter 5 first and then use the 
techniques here. Why? If you get perfect hue and saturation and then start 
making tonal adjustments, you’re likely to knock your colors out of whack 
again. And, of course, there’s also the possibility that adjusting your image’s 
tonality will make the colors look perfect!
Watching the Histogram and Info panels
As you work with your various color adjustments in Photoshop, a couple of 
panels can help you track the changes you’re making. You show the Info and 
Histogram panels by selecting them in Photoshop’s Window menu. Keeping 
an eye on your Info and Histogram panels while you’re dragging sliders and 
entering numbers into various fields can help you spot potential problems as 
they develop.
The Histogram is useful for tracking changes in the distribution of pixels 
at various tonal ranges. You can read more about it in Chapter 5. The Info 
panel, while you’ve got an adjustment dialog box open, shows you “before” 
and “after” color values. Wherever you move the cursor in the image window, 
the Info panel shows you the result of the adjustment — the consequences of 
your action, so to speak. You can click in the image with the Color Sampler 
(or Shift-click with the Eyedropper tool) to add up to four markers in the 
image. The color values under those color samplers appear in the Info panel 
and, like the cursor location, show before/after values as you’re making 
changes (see Figure 6-6).

113
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
“Here, Spot!”: What is a spot color?
Spot colors in your image are printed by using 
premixed inks of exactly that color. (I’m talking 
commercial printing press here, not your run-
of-the-mill inkjet printer.) To properly prepare a 
spot color for press, it needs to be in its own 
spot channel, which is a separate color channel 
in which you show where and how the ink will 
be applied. (Channels in your image are eventu-
ally used to create the actual printing plates that 
pick up ink and put it on paper.) Because spot 
channels are used with CMYK images, dark rep-
resents more. Where you need the spot color 
at 100% strength, the spot channel should be 
black. In areas where you want only a light tint 
of the spot color, use a light gray.
You create your spot channel by selecting the 
Spot Channel command from the Channels 
panel menu. Click the color swatch in the New 
Spot Channel dialog box to open the color librar-
ies. (If you see the regular Color Picker, click the 
Color Libraries button.) Select the appropriate 
book (collection of colors; see the figure here) 
for your project, and then select your color. 
Click OK in the New Spot Channel dialog box to 
accept the color, do not change the name of the 
spot channel, and then click OK. You can now 
paint, fill, or copy/paste into that new channel.
When saving images with spot channels, you 
can use the PSD file format (if the image will be 
placed into an InDesign document), PDF, TIFF, 
or DCS 2.0. Check with the person handling the 
layout or the print shop to see which is required.

Choosing color adjustment commands
Photoshop offers almost two dozen different commands that you can use 
to improve the appearance of your images, all of which are easily accessed 
through the Image➪Adjustments menu (as you see in Figure 6-7). Some have 
specialized purposes, and some are extremely versatile, but all are worth 
understanding so that you choose the most appropriate feature for the prob-
lem staring at you from the screen. Most (but not all) of the commands that I 
discuss here can be added to your images as an adjustment layer, which gives 
you added flexibility. (Adjustment layers are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.)
Auto Tone, Auto Contrast, Auto Color
The three “auto” adjustments, found in the Image menu rather than Image➪
Adjustments, are one-click solutions to many image problems. Auto Color, 
the most powerful of the three, is perhaps the simplest way to improve both 
color and tonality (the darkness of the shadows and the brightness of the 
highlights). Select the command, and Photoshop automatically finds the light-
est and darkest pixels in the image. Then, on a channel-by-channel basis, it 
redistributes the values of the remaining pixels. For more information on Auto 
Color and the related Auto Contrast and Auto Tone commands, see Chapter 5.

115
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
Brightness/Contrast, Levels, 
Curves, Exposure
These commands are generally used 
to work with tonality rather than 
color (see Chapter 5). However, you 
can select an individual channel in 
Levels or Curves, as shown in Figure 
6-8, to adjust color in an image. Keep 
in mind that changes to an individual 
color channel are reflected through-
out all colors in an image.
Vibrance
The Vibrance adjustment gives you 
control over both vibrance (the 
saturation of near-neutral colors) 
and saturation (the saturation of 
colors throughout the image). You 
can increase Vibrance to make the 
near-neutral colors more saturated, 
or you can reduce Vibrance to make 
those colors even more neutral, 
while increasing Saturation to make the brighter colors in your image stand 
out even more.
Hue/Saturation
Often overlooked and rarely exploited to the fullest, Hue/Saturation is a very 
powerful tool. Using the three sliders together, you can adjust the hue to 
eliminate a color cast, increase saturation so that your colors appear richer 
and more vibrant, and adjust lightness to improve your image’s tonality. (See 
Figure 6-9.) Keep in mind that when you adjust something that’s very dark, 
start with the Lightness slider so that you can evaluate the other changes 
(Hue and Saturation) properly. Remember, too, that you can apply Hue/
Saturation (like a number of other adjustments) to a specific range of colors 
in the image, selected in the pop-up menu at the top of the dialog box.
Using the pop-up menu at the top, you can elect to apply an adjustment to 
only a certain part of the color in your image. Once a color is selected, the eye-
droppers become active, to add to or subtract from the range of color being 
adjusted, and sliders become active between the gradients at the bottom, 
giving you yet another way to control the range of color being adjusted.
Visible in Figure 6-9 is the Adjustments panel, which you use to add adjust-
ment layers to your images. (It’s discussed in more depth in Chapter 8.) The 
content of the panel offers the same options as the Image➪Adjustments➪
Hue/Saturation dialog box, but the Preview check box is replaced by the 
eyeball icon you see at the bottom of the panel in Figure 6-9, which toggles 
Figure 6-7: Photoshop’s flexibility is truly 
evident in the Image➪Adjustments menu.

116
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
the visibility of the new adjustment layer on and off. Use the Adjustments 
panel to add adjustment layers for the first 15 of the commands you saw 
in the Adjustments menu (Figure 6-7), with the exception of the new HDR 
Toning adjustment.
Color Balance
The Color Balance command (as shown in Figure 6-10) presents you with 
three sliders that you use to make changes to the balance between your 
color opposites. If the image is too blue, you drag the third slider away from 
Blue and toward Yellow. (This is also a great way to remember which colors 
are opposite pairs!)
Figure 6-8: Correct each channel individually with Curves to adjust color in your image.

117
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
Figure 6-9: Hue/Saturation can cure three problems at once.
Figure 6-10: Color Balance gives you direct control over opposites.
You can control the highlights, midtones, and shadows of your image indi-
vidually by using radio buttons in the Color Balance dialog box and the 
Adjustments panel. And, in almost all cases, you’ll want to leave the Preserve 
Luminosity check box marked so that the brightness of the individual pixels 
is retained.

118
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
You can also use Color Balance to throw an image out of whack for special 
effects or (getting back to the adjustment’s roots) to compensate for a color 
cast being introduced by the printing device.
Black & White
The Black & White adjustment creates outstanding grayscale copies of your 
color images. As you can see in Figure 6-11, you can control the amount of 
each major range of color used to create the grayscale copy. In this particu-
lar example, the original consists primarily of greens and browns, so the top 
three sliders are key. Reducing Reds and increasing Yellows both lightens the 
browns and greens and increases contrast among the brown tones.
Figure 6-11: Black & White enables you to determine grayscale tones by mixing color values.
 
Note the Tint check box, with which you can easily create sepia or Duotone 
looks for your images. If you’ll be printing on an inkjet printer (rather than 
sending the file to your photo lab), be sure to use a Black & White adjustment 
layer rather than the menu command. Your inkjet printer may introduce an 
unwanted color shift. If so, you can reopen the adjustment layer and work 
with the Hue and Saturation sliders to compensate.
Photo Filter
Photoshop’s Photo Filter is actually an image adjustment rather than a filter. 
The filter in the name refers to those physical photographic filters that you 
screw onto the end of a lens. This adjustment is a great way to correct prob-
lems with temperature in an image — the perceived warmth or coldness of 
an image. When the camera takes a picture under unexpected lighting condi-
tions, a color problem is apparent. (Say, for example, that the camera is set to 
Daylight when shooting indoors.) When an image is too blue, it’s too cool; con-
versely, an image that’s orangey is too warm. (Remember that these are per-
ceptual evaluations — blue light is technically hotter than yellow or red light.)

119
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
In Photo Filter, you select a preset filter from a pop-up menu or select a color 
of your choice. As you can see in Figure 6-12, both preset filters and custom 
colors can be effective in neutralizing a color cast. (You could, of course, also 
use these filters to add a color cast . . . if you wanted to, that is.)
Figure 6-12: Neutralize a color cast with a filter of the opposite color in Photo Filter.
Channel Mixer
Designed to repair a defective channel in an image, Channel Mixer lets you 
use sliders to replace some or all of the intensity of one color channel with 
content from the others. Should you come across an image with damage in 
one channel, you can certainly use the Channel Mixer adjustment to work on 
it (with some degree of success). You reduce the value of the target channel 
by dragging the slider to the left. You then drag one or both of the other slid-
ers toward the right. Generally speaking, you want to add an amount (com-
bined between the two other channels) just about equal to what you subtract 
from the target channel.
 
If you drag a slider to the left past 0 (zero), you invert the content of the 
channel. You can produce some incredible (and incredibly weird) effects 
with this technique, partially inverting one or two channels. When you get 
a chance, give it a try. Using the Monochrome check box in Channel Mixer 

120
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
gives you an alternative to the Black 
& White adjustment for a controlled 
grayscale effect.
Invert
More creative than corrective, the 
Invert command (no dialog box) 
simply reverses the colors in your 
image or the selected area. Although 
inverting areas of an image (like 
desaturating) can draw attention to 
the subject of the image, it’s an edgier 
technique and generally requires 
touch-up after inverting. You’ll find 
that any specular highlight — a pure-
white area (mainly reflections) — 
becomes a distracting black spot.
Posterize
The Posterize command forces your 
image’s broad range of colors into 
a few selected colors (as shown in 
Figure 6-13). You automatically get 
black and white, and then a limited 
number of additional colors, based 
on the content of the original. You 
pick the number of colors that you 
want to use, and Photoshop picks 
which colors to use. You can use as 
few as two colors (plus black and 
white) or as many as 255, which 
pretty much gives you your original 
image. Posterize can create a rather 
pleasing rendering of a photo with very few colors.
 
When experimenting with Posterize, click in the Levels field and use the up- 
and down-arrow keys to preview different numbers of colors. Start low and 
work your way up. If you see something that you like, you can stop or you 
can keep going and come back to that number later — the image will look 
exactly the same when you try that number again.
Threshold
Threshold converts each pixel to either black or white (no colors, no grays). 
You adjust the border between black and white with a slider or by entering 
a value in the Threshold Level box. For an eye-catching special effect, open 
a color image and make a selection of the background (or the subject!) and 
apply Threshold, mixing color and black and white.
Figure 6-13: Reduce colors with Posterize for a 
special effect.

121
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
 
Sometimes, when adjusting color in an image, you need to find the darkest 
and lightest pixels in an image (for use with the eyedroppers in the Curves 
dialog box, for example). Open Threshold, drag the slider all the way to the 
left, then slowly back to the right. The first black spot you see is the darkest 
in the image. Add a color sampler (so you can find the spot again) by Shift+
clicking in the image. Drag the slider all the way to the right and then slowly 
back to the left to find and mark the lightest pixels. After placing your color 
samplers, click Cancel.
Gradient Map
Again, more creative than corrective, the Gradient Map feature re-creates 
your image by using a gradient. The leftmost color stop (the anchor points 
where a gradient color is assigned) in the gradient is mapped to the shadows, 
the right-most to the highlights, and any color stops in between are appropri-
ately assigned to the rest of the tonal range. In Figure 6-14, you can see how 
a two-color gradient (upper left) lacks detail compared with the four-color 
gradient being created for the lower image.
Generally speaking, you use darker colors for the color stops on the left 
and lighter colors for the color stops on the right (although you can create 
extremely interesting effects by mixing things up). Using a black-to-white gra-
dient produces a grayscale image.
Figure 6-14: Using more colors in your gradient produces more detail.

122
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
To edit the gradient, simply click directly on the sample gradient in the 
Gradient Map dialog box. Click to add color stops, drag to move color 
stops, and click the color swatch near the bottom to change the color of the 
selected stop. (You can find more detailed information on creating and work-
ing with gradients in Chapter 14.)
Selective Color
Although designed to help you compensate for the vagaries of printing 
presses, Selective Color can do other great things for you! The command’s 
dialog box, shown in Figure 6-15, has a pop-up menu that offers the six basic 
colors of Photoshop, as well as Whites, Neutrals, and Blacks. You select which 
range of colors to adjust and then drag the sliders. You can work on one set of 
colors, switch to another and make adjustments, switch to another, and so on 
without having to click OK in between. For example, you can adjust the reds in 
the image and leave the blues untouched, or you can adjust the reds and then 
tweak the blues without having to exit the dialog box.
When you have reasonably small adjustments to make, select the Relative 
radio button at the bottom. If you have substantial changes — rather radical 
alterations — select the Absolute radio button.
HDR Toning
 
Designed for use with high dynamic range images (32-bits/channel), the new 
HDR Toning adjustment provides a different way to adjust color. It can be 
used with flattened images in 8-bit or 16-bit color, but keep in mind that small 
adjustments are usually required. HDR Toning is examined in Chapter 20.
Figure 6-15: Tweaking the Neutrals can adjust the overall appearance of an image.

123
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
Shadow/Highlight
The Shadow/Highlight adjustment is discussed at length in Chapter 5 as a 
tonal-correction tool, the job for which it was designed. However, keep in 
mind that the Shadow/Highlight dialog box also includes the Color Correction 
slider. After you lighten shadows or tone down highlights, you can increase 
or decrease the saturation of the colors in the adjusted areas of your image 
with the Color Correction slider.
Variations
Variations is a semi-automated way to make adjustments to your image’s 
color and tonal range. It’s discussed in detail later in this chapter.
Desaturate
The Photoshop Desaturate command creates a grayscale representation of a 
color image without changing the color mode. However, with no dialog box 
or adjustments, it doesn’t offer the control you get by using a Black & White 
adjustment.
Match Color
Now this is a feature to savor! There you are, adding Cousin Joe to the family 
reunion photo because he wasn’t bailed out in time, and you see that the 
lighting is all kinds of different and he sticks out like a sore thumb (or bum). 
Or you return from a major shoot only to find that something wasn’t set cor-
rectly in the camera, and all your images have a nasty color cast.
Match Color lets you adjust one image to another (and you can even use 
selections to identify areas to adjust or areas of the images to use as the 
basis for adjustment), but keep in mind that you get better results with 
images that are already rather similar. You can also fix one shot and use that 
shot as a standard by which others are corrected. (Like most image adjust-
ments, you can record a change in an Action and use Photoshop’s Batch 
command to apply that adjustment to a series of images. Read more about 
Actions in Chapter 16.) Take a look at Figure 6-16 to see the Match Color 
dialog box.
Because Match Color is such a powerful tool, it’s worth taking at look at 
what’s going on in the dialog box:
 
✓ Ignore Selection when Applying Adjustment: If you have an active 
selection in the target layer or image (for calculating the adjustment, see 
the upcoming bullet on that) and you want the adjustment to be applied 
to the entire target, select this check box. If the box is left clear, the 
adjustment is applied only within the selection. Note that you can use 
selections to apply Match Color to only a portion of your image, such as 
flesh tones, or you can adjust sections of the image one at a time.

124
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 6-16: The small image to the upper-right shows the results of using Match Color.
 
✓ Luminance: After the preview shows in your image window, you can 
tone down or brighten up the target area with the Luminance slider.
 
✓ Color Intensity: Think of this slider as a saturation adjustment.
 
✓ Fade: Using Fade lets you blend the adjustment, reducing its intensity.
 
✓ Neutralize: If a color cast is introduced by the adjustment, selecting the 
Neutralize check box often eliminates it.
 
✓ Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colors: You can make a selection 
in the image to which you’re trying to match (the source) and use the 
colors within that selection as the basis for the Match Color calculation.
 
✓ Use Selection in Target to Calculate Adjustment: You can make another 
selection in the target layer or image that presents Match Color with a 
sample of those pixels to use for calculating the adjustment.
 
✓ Source: The Source pop-up menu lists all the open images that can be 
used as a basis for adjustment. Only images of the same color mode and 
color depth get listed. Think of source as the image whose colors you’re 
trying to match. (The selected image or the active layer within an image 
is what you’re adjusting.)

125
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
 
✓ Layer: When a multilayer image is selected in the Source pop-up menu, 
you can designate which layer (or a merged copy of the layers) is the 
actual source.
 
✓ Load Statistics/Save Statistics: If you’re doing a series of images and you 
want to speed things up, click the Save Statistics button to record the 
adjustment you’re making and then use the Load Statistics button with 
other images.
In Figure 6-16, an area of water is selected in the target image and a compara-
ble area of water is selected in the source image. (The selection in the source 
image is visible in Figure 6-16 for illustrative purposes only — a selection in 
an inactive image window isn’t normally visible.) With the two selections, I 
tell Match Color to adjust the target image based on the difference between 
the water color in the two images. Using selections prevents any skewing of 
the adjustment that would be caused by the colors in the sail (source image) 
and the trees (target image). But with the Ignore Selection When Applying 
Adjustment check box enabled as well, I make sure the entire target image is 
adjusted, not just the areas within the selection.
Replace Color
Sort of a cross between the Select➪Color Range command (see Chapter 8) and 
the Hue/Saturation adjustment, Replace Color is an outstanding tool for swap-
ping out one color for another. It’s truly great in a production environment 
where, for example, a certain blouse is available in several colors. Shoot one 
color and then use Replace Color to produce the additional product shots.
The Replace Color dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-17, has two separate 
parts: Selection and Replacement. Click with the left eyedropper in either 
the preview area or in the image windows and adjust the Fuzziness slider 
(how much variation counts as “selected”) to make your initial selection. Use 
the middle eyedropper to add colors or shades of your initial color, and use 
the right eyedropper to subtract from the selection. Choose only variations 
of one color. Then drag those Hue, Saturation, and Lightness sliders in the 
Replacement section of the dialog box to produce your new look.
 
Rather than switching eyedroppers back and forth, use the left eyedropper 
and the Shift key (to add) or the Option/Alt key (to subtract). You can also 
hold down the Shift key and drag through an area to select all the colors in 
the area. If you accidentally select some colors you don’t want, release the 
Shift key and click once to start over.
When the Localized Color Clusters option (to the upper-left of the Replace 
Color adjustment in Figure 6-17) is active, Replace Color looks at each range 
of color you add to the selection as a separate entity. This enables much 
better technical control over the colors selected, but may not be appropriate 
for most uses of Replace Color, in which you generally want smooth and com-
plete transformation of all of the selected colors.

126
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 6-17: Make a selection and change the selection’s hue, saturation, and lightness.
Equalize
When you select the Equalize adjustment, Photoshop finds the darkest 
pixel in the image and maps it to black, maps the lightest pixel to white, and 
distributes the rest of the tonal values between. You can pretty much skip 
Equalize — use Auto Color instead.
Working with Variations
The Variations feature, which you find in the Image➪Adjustments menu, is 
a semi-automated way to make color and tonal adjustments to your images. 
You open the image, open Variations, and then click which version looks 
better (see Figure 6-18).
Much like getting new eyeglasses, using Variations is a matter of “Which 
looks better, this or this?” When you click one of the images, it moves to the 
Current Pick position, and a new set of variations is automatically generated. 
The blue areas that you see in some of the options in Figure 6-18 indicate 
areas where colors will be clipped — forced into black in the shadows or to 

127
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
white in the highlights — which results in a loss of detail in the image. You 
can disable that feature by clearing the Show Clipping check box in the upper 
right. Also note that you can adjust the shadows, midtones, and highlights 
independently, and you can also control (to some degree) the amount of 
variation from sample to sample.
 
Start with the Fine/Coarse slider set somewhere in the middle and get reason-
ably close to a great image, correcting midtones, shadows, highlights, and 
then saturation. Now drag that slider to the Fine setting and zero in on a 
perfect image.
Figure 6-18: You use Variations to click your way to a perfect picture.
Manual corrections in individual channels
Sometimes different areas of an image require different corrections or 
adjustments. You can, for example, “paint” corrections into specific areas 
of a channel by using the toning tools in Photoshop’s Toolbox. The image 

128
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
in Figure 6-19 has a distinct problem (okay, well, maybe a few problems). 
In the lower left is a light-green blob that needs to be eliminated if there’s 
any chance of salvaging this photo. By using the Burn tool on one channel 
at a time, you can darken that specific area of each channel — each channel 
according to its needs.
Figure 6-19: The problem is only in one area of each channel, but you can fix it manually.
On the left, you can see the distinct light area in the thumbnail of the Red and 
Green channels. On the right, after using the Burn tool, those lighter areas 
are gone in the Green channel and a similar adjustment to the Red channel 
eliminates the problem completely.
In addition to the Burn tool, you can use the Dodge, Blur, Sharpen, and 
Smudge tools. You can use the Brush tool and paint with black, white, or 
gray. You can use Levels or Curves on an individual channel or even a selec-
tion within one or more channels. When fine-tuning (or salvaging) an image, 
don’t be afraid to work in one channel at a time, perfecting that channel’s 
contribution to the overall image.

129
 Chapter 6: Making Color Look Natural
Take another look at the two Channels panels shown in Figure 6-19. 
Obviously that’s a composite image because there’s only one Channels 
panel in Photoshop, right? On the right, the Green channel is active (you can 
tell because it’s highlighted), and only the Green channel is visible (only it 
shows the eyeball icon to the left). The other channels are invisible, and you 
see only the grayscale representation from the Green channel in the image 
window. On the left, however, only the Red channel is active, but all the 
channels are visible. Any change I make to that image in that state is applied 
only to the Red channel. But because all channels are visible, I can see the 
overall impact on my image.
 
Sometimes you want only one channel visible, such as when you’re trying to 
balance the tonal range throughout the channel, for example. But most of the 
time, you want to see what’s going on in the image as a whole. Click the one 
channel (or Shift+click two channels) in which you need to work. Then click 
in the left column next to the composite channel at the top to make all chan-
nels visible.
The People Factor: Flesh Tone Formulas
One of the toughest and yet most important jobs in Photoshop is making sure 
that skin looks right. People come in a wide variety of colors and shades and 
tints, and all people vary in color in different places on their bodies and at 
different times of the year. (The top and bottom of your forearm are likely dif-
ferent colors, and the difference is generally much greater in summer than in 
winter.) There are even some exceptions to those broad generalities. Making 
skin tones look great is often a major, yet often critical, challenge.
When you have skin in your image, it’s generally part of the focus of the 
image — the person whom you’re photographing. And even when a person 
isn’t the subject of the image, skin attracts attention in the image. The eye 
naturally goes to people in just about any image (perhaps not first, but 
eventually).
You’ll also find that unnatural variations in skin color are very noticeable. 
Consider how often you think to yourself that someone looks a little pale, or 
flushed, or sunburned, or tanned, or just plain sick. You’re making that judg-
ment call based to a large degree on the appearance of the skin.
Keeping in mind that the numbers shown in Figure 6-20 are general guidelines 
and that real people vary quite a bit, I’ve prepared for you some target values 
for skin tones. Use these formulas loosely when using the techniques in this 
chapter to adjust the color in your images, keeping in mind the individual 
you photographed and the lighting at the time.

130
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 6-20: These are guidelines only, not absolute values!
Note that the numbers are CMYK, even for use with RGB images. Open the 
Info panel menu, choose Panel Options, and set the Second Color Readout 
to CMYK. Remember, too, that you can use the Color Sampler tool to add 
placeholders in the image, monitoring the changes that you’re making in the 
Info panel. Set the color sampler readings to CMYK in the Info panel itself by 
clicking the eyedropper symbol to the left of the color mode listed for each 
sampler.
 
Promise me that you’ll keep in mind that these numbers are for reference 
only, okay? Your individual image determines what the correct adjustment 
should be. You can use these numbers as a starting point, but trust your eyes 
and evaluate your image as you work.

The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
In This Chapter
▶ Taking advantage of the Raw file format
▶ Evaluating your Raw capabilities
▶ Using the Camera Raw plug-in
T
here was a time, not so long ago in people years (but a couple of genera-
tions ago in computer years), when capturing digital photos in a Raw file 
format required you to spend tens of thousands of dollars. The wonderful thing 
about the Raw file format is that you use it to record unprocessed image data, 
which gives you incredible control over the final appearance of your image. 
These days, however, cameras that cost only a few hundred dollars can capture 
images “in the Raw.” If you don’t have a Raw-capable camera now, after reading 
this chapter, you might decide that you need to have Raw capability.
In this chapter, I explain how Raw differs from other image 
file formats and why those differences can be important. 
I show you how to determine whether you have what 
you need to capture in Raw and whether Photoshop’s 
Adobe Camera Raw plug-in is capable of handling 
your camera’s image files. Most of the rest of the 
chapter looks at the Camera Raw interface and what 
all those sliders do for you and your image.
Understanding the Raw Facts
The Raw file format at its heart is nothing but unpro-
cessed image data. It comes in a number of variations — 
one or several for each camera manufacturer. Each has its 
own file extension (such as .crw, .cr2, or .nef), and many have 
their own special features that are totally incompatible with each other and 
even incompatible with Raw images from different camera models that use 
the same file extension. And those camera manufacturers love to tinker with 
their proprietary formats, changing them regularly. But each of the formats, 
at the basic level, is Raw. (Check your camera’s User Guide to see whether 

132
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
it’s capable of recording image data in a format other than JPEG or TIFF. If so, 
it’s probably a variation of Raw.)
Thankfully, Adobe updates the Camera Raw plug-in for Photoshop (as shown 
in Figure 7-1) on a regular basis, adding the capability to work with the newest 
cameras shortly after they’re available. (Plug-ins, like Camera Raw and most of 
Photoshop’s filters, extend the program’s capabilities. Updating your plug-ins 
regularly ensures you have the greatest capabilities.) Be warned, however, that 
purchasing a new camera model the day it comes on the market might mean 
using the camera’s own software for a while until Camera Raw is updated.
Figure 7-1: The impressive Camera Raw window, explained fully in this chapter.
 
In the Camera Raw window in Figure 7-1, notice the thumbnails stacked to the 
left. Select multiple Raw images in the Photoshop File➪Open dialog box or in 
Bridge and they all open in Camera Raw together. Click a thumbnail to work 
on that particular image. If you open images that all need a similar correc-
tion, adjust one and then click the Select All and Synchronize buttons in the 
upper-left corner.
Adobe also offers the free DNG Converter software for converting supported 
Raw files to the open source DNG file format. (Open source means that 
anyone can freely use it. The DNG format is also known as “digital negative.”) 

133
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
Although some camera manufacturers have adopted the DNG format for their 
cameras, it’s more commonly used as “insurance for the future” — if sup-
port for a specific Raw format is dropped in the future, the DNG copies of the 
image can still be processed. However, because Adobe doesn’t plan on drop-
ping support for any Raw formats in Camera Raw, you really don’t need to 
make DNG copies at this time. If there is a problem with one of your Raw for-
mats in the future, it will make sense to download DNG Converter and make 
DNG copies of the no-longer-supported files at that time.
What’s the big deal about Raw?
Cameras that record images using the Raw format save unprocessed image 
data. When recording as TIFF or JPEG, the camera manipulates the image data, 
processing it in a variety of ways. So what’s the big deal with unprocessed — 
Raw — image data? Assuming that you’re as hungry for food as for knowledge, 
I’ll use a cooking analogy.
Say you purchase frozen lasagna and heat it up in your microwave oven. It 
probably tastes good and fulfills your needs (“Food!”). However, the chef who 
designed this prepared meal and the good folks who churn it out use a specific 
recipe designed to appeal to a large number of people, hopefully offending very 
few. When you reheat your lasagna in the microwave, you have some choices. 
For example, you decide how warm to make it (generally following the pack-
age’s reheating instructions). Or, you can add some pepper or hot sauce.
What you can’t do with that frozen lasagna is take out some of the salt or fat 
in it from the recipe designed by the chef and prepared by the good folks. 
You can’t substitute olive oil for butter. You can’t cut back on the garlic a bit 
(just in case your date goes well). You’re pretty much restricted by what the 
original chef and his good folks prepared. Sure, you could pour a half-bottle 
of blue food coloring over it, creating a special effect, but you’re not likely 
to turn that microwavable lasagna into a gourmet dinner. So if you’re just 
hungry and your demands aren’t too severe, no problem — shoot JPEG (the 
digital photo equivalent of a microwave meal).
The gourmet dinner is what Raw is all about! If you consider yourself a gour-
met chef of the camera, creating art from virtually nothing, Raw is the format 
for you. Avoid the limitations put on your image editing by preprocessing 
and dive right in with the greatest flexibility. (And you don’t even have to go 
down to the farmers’ market for fresh tomatoes.)
Working in Raw
There’s one critical difference between working with Raw images and work-
ing with JPEGs or TIFFs: You never actually make changes to the Raw file. 
Instead, you record your adjustments in the image’s metadata (non-image 
data recorded with the image data) or in a sidecar file (a separate file in which 
Camera Raw records any information that can’t be recorded in the metadata). 

134
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Because adjustments are recorded separately rather than applied to the 
images, the original image data remains unchanged, waiting for you to create 
again and again, all from the same unprocessed, undegraded image data.
 
Sidecar files have the same name as the image file, but they use the .xmp file 
extension. Keep each sidecar file in the same folder as the image with which 
it is associated. If you move the image file without taking the sidecar file 
along for the ride, the information stored in the sidecar file won’t be available 
when you reopen the image file, so you’ll need to adjust the image’s appear-
ance all over again.
 
When capturing in Raw, you can basically ignore all the camera’s settings 
other than aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and (of course) focus. Everything 
else can be adjusted in the Camera Raw plug-in. However, because Raw 
devotes significantly more resources to recording highlights than shadows, 
it’s not a bad idea to concentrate on those highlights when shooting. When 
the highlights are great to start with, you can reallocate some of the image’s 
tonal range to the deprived shadows, thus reducing unwanted digital noise 
and increasing detail.
Keep in mind that in addition to the Photoshop Camera Raw plug-in, you also 
have available the software that came with your camera. (And you might 
even have additional software packages available, such as Aperture from 
Apple and Adobe Lightroom, depending on what camera make and model 
you use.) Which package is best? As usual, “best” is a relative term. For 
example, Nikon’s proprietary software does a great job with sharpness when 
processing .nef files, but it lacks some of Camera Raw’s features. If sharp-
ness is your overriding requirement, you might prefer the Nikon software. 
(Remember that your Raw file can’t be processed by both the camera’s soft-
ware and then by Camera Raw, but you can process the data with either and 
then further refine your image in Photoshop itself.)
 
While working in Camera Raw, keep in mind that what happens when you 
move the image from Camera Raw to Photoshop (or save your adjustments 
and close) is governed by Camera Raw’s Workflow Options. Discussed later 
in this chapter, Workflow Options controls the color space, color depth, pixel 
dimensions, and resolution of the image after you’re done in Camera Raw. 
Workflow Options is where you also control whether the formerly-Raw file 
opens into Photoshop as an image or a Smart Object and, new in Photoshop 
CS5, whether a sharpening preset is applied.
 
Photoshop’s Save As dialog box offers you the option of the Photoshop Raw 
file format. Photoshop Raw is not compatible with the Camera Raw plug-in 
and does not provide you with the benefits of using the Raw format with 
your digital camera. It is, however, necessary for certain high-end graphics 
and animation programs into which someone, somewhere, sometimes places 
images from Photoshop.

135
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
Do You Have What It Takes?
To capture images in the Raw format requires only a camera that shoots 
Raw. To work with those images in Photoshop, however, you need both a 
camera and software that can process the Raw files. To work with images in 
the Camera Raw plug-in, you need a camera on the supported cameras list for 
Camera Raw — and, of course, Photoshop with Camera Raw. Adobe updates 
the Camera Raw plug-in regularly to ensure compatibility with the latest cam-
eras as well as with the latest nit-picky changes that camera manufacturers 
have made to their proprietary versions of Raw. Check for the latest Camera 
Raw update and list of supported cameras here (and don’t forget to read the 
installation instructions very carefully):
www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html
Working with images in the Raw format requires one other thing that you might 
not have: additional time. Opening the Camera Raw plug-in, making the neces-
sary adjustments to your image, and then transferring the image into Photoshop 
all take time. Granted, making changes in Camera Raw eliminates the need for 
many of the adjustments that you’d be making in Photoshop, but working in 
Camera Raw could seem to be slower. (Actually, depending on your system, 
Camera Raw might speed things up because tonal adjustment, color correction, 
sharpening, and noise reduction are all in one place — there’s no waiting for 
adjustments and filters to be applied and then for the next dialog box to open.)
Camera Raw with JPEG and TIFF
Camera Raw also offers the capability to work 
with JPEG and TIFF in the Camera Raw dialog 
box. Although not a substitute for shooting Raw 
(JPEG and TIFF image data has already been 
processed by the camera), it’s a huge step for-
ward in terms of flexibility. When you do your ini-
tial processing in Camera Raw, the adjustments 
are recorded as instructions in the file metadata 
rather than actually making changes to the pixels 
in your image. You can later go back and make 
changes to those adjustments — the changes 
are applied to the original pixel data fresh and 
clean rather than making changes to changes.
To open a JPEG or TIFF File in Camera Raw, open 
the Camera Raw Preferences (which you can now 
open through the Photoshop Preferences menu) 
and elect to open all JPEG and TIFF files into 
Camera Raw. Later you may decide to change that 
Preference setting to only open JPEG and TIFF 
files that already have settings associated with 
them, or you may elect to not open JPEG and TIFF 
files into Camera Raw at all. After changing the 
Preferences, you can simply use any of Photoshop 
and Bridge’s open commands, or double-click the 
file in Bridge to open into Camera Raw.
Keep in mind that after you adjust a TIFF or 
JPEG file in Camera Raw, that image will always 
open into Camera Raw. If, down the road, you 
decide that you want to bypass Camera Raw 
and make those adjustments a permanent part 
of the image’s appearance, use Photoshop’s 
Save As command to create a new copy of the 
file, or disable JPEG and TIFF support in Camera 
Raw’s Preferences.

136
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Working in the Camera Raw Plug-In
The cornerstone of Photoshop’s Raw capability is the Camera Raw plug-in. After 
an image is open in Photoshop itself, you manipulate the pixels directly, rather 
than manipulating the metadata. When you work in the Camera Raw plug-in, 
you never change the image itself, only the adjustments recorded in the file’s 
metadata (or in a sidecar file). As shown earlier in Figure 7-1, the Camera Raw 
window is filled with tools and sliders. Even though you might not work with all 
the Camera Raw features, here’s the lowdown on the features there.
Tools and preview options
In the upper-left corner of the Camera 
Raw window are almost a dozen 
tools (as shown in Figure 7-2) for 
manipulating your image and the 
workspace. From the left, the tools 
are Zoom, Hand, White Balance, Color 
Sampler, Targeted Adjustment, Crop, 
Straighten, Spot Removal, Red Eye 
Removal, the Adjustment Brush, and the Graduated Filter. To the right of the 
tools are buttons to open Camera Raw’s Preferences and two rotation buttons. 
 
When multiple images are open in Camera Raw, you also have the Trash 
icon to the right of the rotation buttons. With one or more image thumbnails 
selected, click the Trash button to mark the files for deletion. When you click 
the Done or Open Images button, marked images are sent to your computer’s 
Trash or Recycle Bin. Mark images for deletion only when you’re sure you 
have no use for them.
The Zoom and Hand tools function as you would expect — they zoom in and out 
and reposition a zoomed-in image in the window. Click with the White Balance 
tool on something in the image that should be gray (not something that is 
already gray, but that should be gray) to automatically adjust the Temperature 
and Tint sliders. It’s a one-click way to neutralize any color cast and correct the 
color balance. If you get an unexpected result, click elsewhere. And, of course, 
afterward you can still tweak the Temperature and Tint sliders as desired.
When you add color samplers (a maximum of nine) to the image preview 
area (click with the Color Sampler tool), their values are displayed below the 
tools, as you see in Figure 7-2. When you haven’t added color samplers, that 
area is collapsed, leaving more room for the preview area. Color samplers in 
Camera Raw function the same as they do in Photoshop (see Chapter 6). Color 
samplers are visible earlier in Figure 7-1 as numbered targets in the preview 
area, strategically located in critical areas of the photo. You can use the Color 
Sampler tool to drag existing color samplers to new locations or delete them 
by Option/Alt+clicking on the sampler. With any but the Retouch and Red Eye 
Figure 7-2: Camera Raw offers 11 tools for per-
fecting your images and up to nine color 
samplers.

137
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
Removal tools active, the Clear Samplers button will delete all existing color 
samplers. Remember, too, that the position of the cursor can function as an 
additional color sampler — the RGB values are shown below the histogram.
 
If you never upgraded to Camera Raw 5.2 or later, you haven’t seen the Targeted 
Adjustment tool, as shown in Figure 7-3. Designed for on-image adjustments, you 
click on the tool, hold down the mouse button, select the type of adjustment 
you want to make, and then click directly in the image preview. Drag up or down 
and left or right to adjust the image’s appearance. Whether you elect Parametric 
Curve, Hue, Saturation, Luminance, or Grayscale Mix, the appropriate pane 
opens to the right so that you can monitor (and fine-tune) the adjustment. If you 
select Parametric Curve and click in a light area in the image, Highlights or Lights 
are adjusted; if you click in a dark area, Shadows or Darks are adjusted. With the 
other four options for the Targeted Adjustment tool, you’re adjusting a specific 
range of color — based on the color on which you click — as you drag.
Figure 7-3: Click in the image and drag with the Targeted Adjustment tool to adjust the image.
Click and hold the Crop tool icon to select an aspect ratio (relationship 
between width and height), as shown in Figure 7-4. Drag the Crop tool to create 
a bounding box, which will automatically adjust to Landscape or Portrait 
orientation as you drag. You can then adjust the size of the bounding box 
by dragging its anchor points. You can also rotate an image while cropping: 
Position the tool just outside the bounding box and drag to rotate. If you drag 

138
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
the Straighten tool along a line in the image that 
should be horizontal or vertical, perhaps the inter-
section of two walls or the horizon, a crop bound-
ing box is created with that alignment.
When you have the Crop tool’s bounding box just 
right and you’ve finished adjusting the image’s 
appearance, click the Open or Done button. 
Should you change your mind about cropping, 
click the Crop tool, hold down the mouse button 
to show the menu, and select Clear Crop. Or 
you can eliminate the bounding box (when the 
Crop tool is active) by pressing Delete (Mac) or 
Backspace (Windows).
The Straighten tool can be used in conjunction 
with the Crop tool. Select the tool and drag along 
any line in the image that should be vertical or 
horizontal. A crop bounding box is automatically 
created that encompasses as much of the image as possible while rotating to 
straighten the image. Keep in mind that the Straighten tool uses the aspect 
ratio currently selected for the Crop tool, so make that selection before drag-
ging the Straighten tool.
The Spot Removal tool gives you the 
ability to make minor corrections 
right in the Camera Raw dialog box. 
As shown in Figure 7-5, it offers capa-
bilities similar to the Healing Brush 
and the Clone Stamp, including an 
Opacity slider. However, the Spot 
Removal tool’s behavior is quite 
different. To use the Spot Removal 
tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the area you want to heal or clone over.
 
2. Drag to expand the tool’s diameter.
 
 You can also set the diameter using the Radius slider to the right, in the 
area below the histogram.
 
3. Position the source (green) and destination (red) circles.
 
 When you release the mouse button after setting the tool’s diameter, a 
pair of circles appears. Click within the green circle and drag it over the 
element from which you want to clone or heal. You can also drag the red 
circle to fine-tune the location of the destination. You can click the edge 
of either circle and drag to resize them both (or use the Radius slider).
 
4. Repeat, accept, or clear.
Figure 7-4: The Crop tool can 
ensure perfect aspect ratio.
Figure 7-5: Camera Raw’s Spot Removal tool 
offers both healing and cloning modes.

139
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
 
 Clicking outside the circles accepts the change and starts the next heal-
ing/cloning process. Changing tools and continuing with your adjust-
ments accepts the changes. Clicking the Clear All button (just above 
Camera Raw’s Done button) deletes the changes you made with the Spot 
Removal tool.
To use the Red Eye Reduction tool, drag a rect-
angle around the entire eye, including some sur-
rounding skin (see Figure 7-6). It automatically 
tries to hunt down and eliminate any suspicious 
red eye in the rectangle. You might need to adjust 
the Pupil Size and Darken sliders (in the area to 
the right, under the Histogram) to fine-tune the 
adjustment.
To make localized adjustments in specific areas 
of your image, select the Adjustment Brush 
(shown in Figure 7-7), 
drag the sliders, and paint 
in the image. You can 
paint a number of differ-
ent adjustments (use the 
New button) or paint the 
same adjustment in dif-
ferent areas (use the Add 
button). And remember 
that these adjustments 
are only recorded in the 
metadata, and therefore 
can be changed any 
time down the road. It’s 
not quite the same as 
duplicating layers and 
using layer masks in 
Photoshop, but a great 
non-destructive way to 
paint adjustments!
The Graduated Filter tool 
enables you to set the 
adjustment in the area 
to the right, and then 
drag the tool in the image 
window. The adjustment 
is applied at full strength 
in the area before your 
first click, and gradually 
faded through the area where you dragged (see Figure 7-8). You can add 
more than one graduated adjustment if necessary.

haunted red eye effect right in 
Camera Raw.

Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
To the right of the tools 
are Camera Raw’s buttons 
to quickly open Camera 
Raw’s Preferences (the 
same as using the key-
board shortcut Ô+K/
Ctrl+K) and to rotate the 
image in 90 degree incre-
ments in either direction.
Here are some options in 
the Preferences that you 
might want to consider:
 
✓ Save settings in 
sidecar files. This is 
already the default, 
and it’s a good one. 
When Camera Raw 
can’t record data 
directly to the image 
file’s existing meta-
data, you can either 
save everything in 
one central location — 
which means you lose everything if that database is damaged or lost — or 
each image you adjust can have its own .xmp file to hold your adjustments.
 
✓ Set defaults for each camera. If you shoot with more than one camera 
(and remember that Camera Raw can now work with JPEG images, as 
explained in the “Camera Raw with JPEG and TIFF” sidebar in this chap-
ter) use separate defaults for each of them. Saving a new camera default 
is discussed later in this chapter, in the “Workflow options and presets” 
section. You can also make defaults that change based on the ISO setting 
with which each image was captured.
 
✓ Update DNG previews. If you work with Adobe’s DNG Converter and 
make DNG copies of your images, doesn’t it make sense that you’d want 
the latest adjustments reflected in the file’s preview? (The JPEG preview 
is used by your computer’s operating system and other programs that 
can’t read DNG files.) And those previews might as well be full-size, eh?
You’ll also find options in Camera Raw’s Preferences for opening JPEG and 
TIFF files into Camera Raw. Keep in mind that once you open an image in 
either format using Camera Raw, you’ll have to go through Camera Raw every 
time you open that image (unless, of course, you disable all support for JPEG 
and TIFF files in Camera Raw’s Preferences). If you ever decide you don’t 
want to open a particular image through Camera Raw again, use Photoshop’s 
Save As command to create a new copy of the picture.

with more control!

 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
The histogram
Because of the unprocessed nature of Raw images, the histogram you see in 
the top-right corner of the Camera Raw window (also shown in Figure 7-9) is 
generally far more important than the Histogram panel in Photoshop itself. 
By keeping an eye on the histogram while you adjust sliders, you can ensure 
that you’re not blowing out the highlights (when the very right end of the 
histogram starts crawling up the edge) or clogging the shadows (the left edge 
gets too tall). The RGB values that you see just above the histogram repre-
sent the values of the pixel directly under the cursor when the cursor is in 
the preview area of the window.
The histogram in Camera Raw shows you not only the distribution of tonal 
values but also the distribution by channel. In Figure 7-9, you can see that the 
Blue channel has a lot of dark pixels: The blue column climbs the left edge of 
the histogram. This could indicate any of a number of situations. However, 
because you also see a generally good distribu-
tion of blue throughout the histogram (in part 
shown by the areas of white, which indicate that 
all three channels have comparable values), you 
can be pretty sure that the column of blue to the 
left simply indicates a lot of bright yellow in the 
image. (Blue and yellow are color opposites in 
RGB.) As always, remember that what you see in 
the preview area — what your eyes tell you — 
trumps any information from a histogram.
To toggle a preview of any “clipping” in your image, click the triangles in the 
upper-left (shadows) and upper-right (highlights) of the histogram. Anyplace 
where the shadows are being forced to pure black, losing detail that you could 
retain, you see a solid blue overlay. Anywhere that the highlights are being 
blown out to pure white, again losing valuable detail, you see a solid red over-
lay. (Fix this clipping problem using the Exposure, Blacks, Brightness, and 
Fill Light sliders, as explained later in this chapter.) You can hide these gamut 
warnings by again clicking the triangles. The triangles change color to tell you 
what’s wrong or which colors are causing the problem. You might want to 
hide the overlays when creating special effects. (I readily admit that I often 
intentionally clog shadows and blow out highlights to produce special effects 
and to focus attention on the subject of my photos.)
The preview area
As shown earlier in Figure 7-1, the bulk of the Camera Raw window is filled 
with the image preview, giving you the best possible view of your work. 
Remember that you can drag the lower-right corner of the Camera Raw 
window to resize it. The preview area benefits/suffers from the changes that 
you make as you enlarge/shrink the window. To the lower left are a pop-up 
menu with preset zoom factors as well as a pair of buttons to zoom in or out. 
Figure 7-9: Consult the histo-
gram to make sure you don’t 
wreck your highlights and 
shadows.

142
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
(Don’t forget about the Zoom tool!) Unlike Photoshop, Camera Raw’s maxi-
mum zoom percentage is 400%.
Above the top-right corner of the preview area is the Preview check box, 
which you can toggle off and on to see the difference between the current 
adjustments and the original (or earlier adjustments made in Camera Raw). 
To the right of the Preview check box is a handy button that expands Camera 
Raw to Full Screen mode. The only Camera Raw–related information that 
disappears is the name of the camera from which the images came. Note to 
Mac users: In Full Screen mode, you may not have access to the hidden Dock 
(even if you drag the lower-right corner to reduce the size of the Camera Raw 
window). Simply click the button again to toggle back to Normal mode or 
use the Mac’s shortcut Ô+Tab to switch programs. (Pressing the F key also 
toggles to and from Full Screen mode.)
Workflow options and presets
Just below the preview area in Camera Raw is a line of information in blue. 
That tells you the current color space, color depth, pixel dimensions, and 
resolution. Click that line to open the Workflow Options dialog box.
Here are your workflow options:
 
✓ Space: Camera Raw offers only four color spaces — Adobe RGB, 
ColorMatch RGB, ProPhoto RGB, and sRGB. Color spaces (read about 
them in Chapter 6) determine which colors are available in an image.
 
 Using the ProPhoto RGB color space gives you the widest gamut (the 
largest number of possible colors), which minimizes the chance of 
colors getting squished into each other as you work with your image. If 
your image has extreme colors, use ProPhoto and 16-bit color in Camera 
Raw, and then, if your printer can’t handle ProPhoto as a color space, 
choose Edit➪Assign Profile to change to your required profile (Adobe 
RGB for inkjet printers or sRGB for images being sent to a photo lab). 
Select Relative Colorimetric as the rending intent.
 
✓ Depth: Because a greater color depth means more possible variations in 
color, generally you want to select 16-bit color and either keep the image 
in that color depth or switch to 8-bit color later in Photoshop by choos-
ing Image➪Mode➪8-Bits/Channel. Use 8-bit color for any image that 
must be saved in JPEG format (including Web images), for CMYK (cyan/
magenta/yellow/black) images, or when the file size overwhelms your 
printer. You might also opt for 8-bit color if storage space is limited. 
(Chapter 6 includes a detailed explanation of color depth.)
 
✓ Size: You can choose from a number of pixel dimensions for your image 
in Camera Raw. The camera’s native pixel dimensions for the image is 
the default, but you can also downsize or upsize to various preset sizes 
(which vary from one camera model to the next). Camera Raw uses a 

143
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
variation of the Bicubic Sharper algorithm for resampling (calculating 
the colors of the new pixels). If you crop the image in Camera Raw, the 
pixel dimensions are proportionally scaled.
 
✓ Resolution: Resolution is simply an instruction to a printing device 
about what size to make each pixel. It can be assigned in Camera Raw or 
later in Photoshop’s Image Size dialog box (with Resample unselected). 
If your camera embeds a resolution that Camera Raw can read, it will be 
used. Generally speaking, 300 ppi is an appropriate resolution for images 
that will be printed.
 
✓ Sharpen For: New in Photoshop CS5, the Sharpen For menu provides 
you with presets designed for specific purposes, including on-screen 
presentation, inkjet prints on glossy paper, and prints on matte paper. 
Each category includes Low, Medium, and High options. This sharpen-
ing is in addition to the sharpening you add in Camera Raw’s Detail tab. 
(Generally you should leave this set to None and sharpen according to 
the image content.)
 
✓ Open in Photoshop as Smart Objects: This option enables you to auto-
matically open your Raw image into Photoshop as a Smart Object. Smart 
Objects, which are discussed in Chapter 10, can be scaled and trans-
formed multiple times with minimal degradation of the image quality. 
And, as explained in Chapter 15, you can apply Smart Filters — re-editable 
filters — to Smart Objects.
 
On the subject of workflow, let me 
also suggest how you can save loads 
of time when working with Camera 
Raw: Create your own defaults and 
use saved settings. Figure 7-10 shows 
the menu commands available to 
you. (Not all commands are available 
all the time.) The most important 
is perhaps Save New Camera Raw 
Defaults.
Here’s my recommendation:
 
1. Open one of your typical 
images.
 
 Open an image that’s well 
exposed and typical for what and how you shoot. Don’t open some wild 
image that’s three-quarters wrecked and in need of emergency surgery.
 
2. Adjust the image to make it look perfect.
 
 The various adjustments are discussed in the following sections. Make 
all the necessary adjustments, including noise reduction and camera 
calibration if required.
Figure 7-10: Camera Raw permits you to save, 
export, and import settings, as well as estab-
lish custom default settings.

144
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
 
3. Save as your new defaults.
 
 Open the menu and select Save As New Camera Raw Defaults.
Now when you open one of your images into Camera Raw, you’ll already have 
a good correction established and you’ll need to tweak the settings only a bit 
to adjust for the peculiarities and vagaries of that particular shot.
 
Remember, too, that you can save settings for each individual shoot by using 
the Save Settings command. Say, for example, that you shot on-location 
under difficult lighting circumstances. Rather than adjusting each image, 
adjust one, save the settings, and load (or apply) those settings for each addi-
tional image from that shoot that needs to be processed.
The Basic panel
When it comes to actually correcting your images 
in Camera Raw, the meat-and-potatoes portion is 
the Basic panel. Click on the leftmost of the eight 
tabs directly below the histogram area to open 
the Basic panel, which is shown in Figure 7-11.
Here are some general guidelines for working in 
the Basic panel (but remember that each image 
has its own particular requirements):
 
 
✓ Adjust the white point. Generally, you 
adjust the white point (the Temperature and 
the Tint sliders) by clicking with the White 
Balance tool (which looks like the 
Eyedropper tool, shown here in the margin) 
in some area that should be neutral and 
close to white. If the image doesn’t look 
right, click elsewhere or manually adjust the 
Temperature and Tint sliders.
 
✓ Adjust the Exposure. Drag the Exposure 
slider right or left to spread the histo-
gram across most of the space available. 
(Remember, these are general guidelines for 
typical images, not “rules.”)
 
✓ Fine-tune the shadows and highlights. Use the Brightness and Blacks 
sliders to spread the histogram toward the right and left ends. The 
Recovery slider can bring back some of the depth in the upper part of 
the tonal range (bright areas, but not as bright as the highlights), and 
the Fill Light slider lightens the midtones.
 
✓ Fine-tune the contrast. Drag the Contrast slider to the right to increase 
contrast or to the left to flatten out the image’s contrast.
Figure 7-11: The Basic panel is 
where you do the bulk of your 
image correction.

145
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
 
✓ Make the image “pop” with the Clarity slider. Drag the Clarity slider 
to the right to increase the contrast among neighboring areas of color. 
Somewhat akin to sharpening, this slider can do a great job of adding life 
to most images.
 
✓ Tweak the colors. Using the Vibrance slider in conjunction with the 
Saturation slider, adjust the appearance of the color in your image. 
Remember that the Saturation adjustment is applied to all colors in the 
image, while Vibrance works primarily with the near-neutral colors.
 
Double-click any slider control to reset that slider to its default value. This 
works not only for sliders in the Basic panel, but also for sliders anywhere in 
Camera Raw.
 
As you work, the best adjustments are those that make the image look great 
to you and meet your creative goals. The order of adjustments and the histo-
gram suggestions here are not appropriate for all images. Let your artistic 
sense be your guide.
Adjusting the tone curve
The second tab in Camera Raw, just to the right of the Basic tab, presents you 
with a pair of ways to adjust the histogram using curves (see Figure 7-12). In the 
Tone Curve panel, you have two tabs: Parametric and Point. The first thing to 
know about the Tone Curve adjustments is that they are in addition to changes 
you make in the Basic tab. All changes are cumulative — dragging sliders in the 
Parametric panel, for example, won’t change the sliders on the Basic tab.
In the Parametric panel, you adjust four sliders to control various parts of the 
tonal range. The three sliders immediately below the curve itself govern the 
pivot points around which the sliders bend the curve. The two outer sliders 
govern what part of the tonal range is affected by the Shadows and Highlights 
sliders, and the middle slider controls the relationship between the Darks 
and Lights sliders.
The Point panel of the Tone Curve tab is quite similar to the Curves adjustment 
in Photoshop: Click the curve to add an anchor point; drag up and down to 
adjust that part of the tonal range. You can add up to 14 separate points to the 
curve. Click an anchor point to make it active (it appears as a solid point rather 
than hollow) and you can use the Input and Output fields to adjust the point 
numerically, or use the arrow keys to change the point’s location.
So, you might ask yourself, “Should I use the Basic tab, the Tone Curve tab, 
or both?” And the answer is “Yes, you should use the Basic tab, or the Tone 
Curve tab, or both.” You might find that you’re more comfortable using one 
curve or the other rather than the Blacks, Brightness, and Contrast sliders 
in the Basic tab. Or you might find that for one particular image you want to 
make large adjustments with one set of sliders and fine-tune with the other.

146
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 7-12: You make changes to tonality in the Tone Curve tab.
But how do the adjustments compare? An increase of 10 in the Contrast 
slider in the Basic tab is approximately comparable to a parametric curves 
adjustment of Lights plus-4 and Darks minus-5. A parametric curve adjust-
ment of Highlights plus-15 and Shadows minus-15 is roughly comparable 
to Blacks 5 and Brightness 4 on the Basic tab. You might find that using 
the Blacks slider (in the Basic tab) has a heavier influence on the darkest 
shadows and less influence on the midtones than working with the Shadows 
slider in the Parametric panel of Tone Curve. Likewise, you might find the 
Brightness slider a bit more concentrated in the lightest highlights than the 
Highlights slider. But most of all, you might find that using both sets of sliders 
gives you incredible control over the tonal range in your image!
The Detail panel
 
Nine sliders on the Detail tab (as shown in Figure 7-13) control sharpness and 
noise in your image. I suggest that as soon as you click the Detail tab, you 
zoom in to 200% or even 400% on an area of shadow in your image and drag 
the sliders all the way to the left, setting them to 0 (zero). Rather than work-
ing from the top down, as you do in most Camera Raw panels, I generally sug-
gest reducing noise before sharpening. Drag the Color Noise Reduction slider 
slowly to the right until all red/green/blue specks in the shadows disappear. 

147
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
Next, drag the Luminance slider to 
the right until the bright specks in 
your shadows are reduced but not 
so far to the right that detail in your 
image is damaged. Use the Luminance 
Detail, Luminance Contrast, and Color 
Detail sliders in conjunction with the 
Luminance and Color sliders to mini-
mize the loss of detail.
Sharpening in Camera Raw has 
developed so much that it’s actu-
ally perhaps better than sharpening 
in Photoshop. Rather than a single 
slider, you now have four sliders 
with which to perfect your images:
 
✓ Amount. The Amount slider is 
the basic how-much-sharpening-
am-I-adding slider. You might 
consider “sharpening” to be 
creating bright and dark “halos” 
along edges in the image. 
Amount refers to the brightness 
of those halos. The slider ranges 
from zero to 150.
 
✓ Radius. The Radius slider con-
trols the width of the “halos” along the edges. Higher is wider, up to a 
maximum of 3 pixels.
 
✓ Detail. Use the Detail slider to control how large an edge has to be to get 
included in the sharpening process. Leave it at zero and only major edges 
in the image are sharpened. Drag the slider all the way to the right, to 100, 
and everything in the image gets sharpened, every pore, each grain of 
sand—even the remains of any digital noise you want to hide.
 
✓ Masking. The Masking slider, used in conjunction with the Detail slider, 
can help protect the smallest detail in the image from becoming over-
sharpened and garish. The farther to the right you drag the slider, the 
more tiny detail is excluded.
 
Here’s the coolest part: Zoom in to at least 100% and hold down the Option/
Alt key while dragging any of the Sharpening sliders — you’ll see a grayscale 
preview of what you’re actually doing to your image!
Figure 7-14 shows three views of the same image: The unsharpened original 
(top); the Sharpening sliders set to Amount–85, Radius–1.0, Detail–55, and 
Masking–5 (middle); the preview of the Detail adjustment (bottom).

HSL, grayscale, and split toning
Working with options in three tabs, Camera Raw’s HSL/Grayscale feature 
gives you incredible control over hue, saturation, and luminance of specific 
color ranges in your image. Need to perk up the reds in your image? Not a 
problem — boost the Reds slider in Saturation and Luminance! Yellows a bit 
too garish? Tone ’em down with the Yellows slider. Maybe the green grass 
looks a bit yellow. Drag the Greens slider halfway to the right in the Hue 
tab. You can control each of the eight major color ranges independently (as 
shown in Figure 7-15).
A fourth panel, Grayscale Mix, appears only when the Convert to Grayscale 
box is selected. With the Convert to Grayscale option selected, you control 
the contribution of each range of color to the final grayscale image. Use the 
Basic tab’s Exposure, Blacks, Brightness, and Contrast sliders to control the 
overall appearance of the image.

149
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
 
The Saturation tab also enables you to create partial grayscale images quite 
easily. Drag some sliders to the left to make those areas of color grayscale; 
drag others to the right to enhance the remaining colors. Figure 7-15 shows 
an excellent candidate for this partial-grayscale technique.
The Split Toning tab is generally used in conjunction with the Convert to 
Grayscale option HSL/Grayscale tab. (Although you can use it to make adjust-
ments to highlights or shadows, you would generally remove or introduce a 
color cast in the Basic tab with the Temperature and Tint sliders.) Think of 
split toning as creating a sepia or Duotone version of an image. As you can 
see in Figure 7-16, you have separate controls for adjusting the highlights and 
shadows. Select a different hue for each and adjust the saturation indepen-
dently. The Balance slider allows you to control what part of the tonal range 
is considered highlight or shadow.
Vibrance and Saturation
Both the Vibrance and the Saturation sliders in 
Camera Raw adjust the intensity of colors in your 
image. So what’s the difference? The Saturation 
slider changes all color in the image, whereas 
the Vibrance slider works its magic primarily on 
those pixels that are least saturated. To see how 
this works, open an image in Camera Raw and 
adjust the sliders to make the image look great. 
Drag the Saturation slider all the way to the left. 
Grayscale, right? Move the Saturation slider all 
the way to the right. Over-saturated, right? Drag 
the Vibrance slider slowly to the right while 
keeping an eye on areas of the image that are 
close-to-but-not-quite gray. Watch how they 
increase in saturation, gradually going from near 
gray to almost colorful. Now here’s the coolest 
trick of all: With Saturation still at +100, drag the 
Vibrance slider all the way to the left, to –100. 
Starting with an appropriate image, this can be 
a very interesting effect.

150
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 7-15: Grayscale greenery contrasts nicely with highly saturated blooms.
Figure 7-16: A photo of a bland building in front of an overcast sky is 
improved with split toning.
To create a sepia effect, start with a value of 40 in both of the Highlights 
fields and perhaps +30 for Balance. Use a Shadow saturation value of 0 (and 
because saturation is set to 0, it doesn’t matter what value you select for 
the Hue slider). Remember, too, that you can select the same hue for both 
Highlights and Shadows to create a monochrome effect.

151
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
Compensating with Lens Correction
Use the Lens tab’s controls (as shown in Figure 7-17) to compensate for cer-
tain undesirable characteristics of your lens. Zoom in on an area of angled 
lines in a corner of your image — perhaps tree branches in front of a bright 
sky — and look for colorful halos or fringes along edges. Use the Chromatic 
Aberration sliders to minimize the fringe. Be patient and careful — often 
there will be one precise pair of settings that eliminates the problem. (And 
keep in mind that while refraction of light through water or ice isn’t the same 
as chromatic aberration, these sliders are sometimes helpful in minimizing 
those colored halos, as well.) The Defringe menu offers the options of None, 
Highlight Edges, and All Edges. Use it to help maintain the appearance of 
edges after minimizing chromatic aberration.
Figure 7-17: Original to the left, corrected image to the right.
Use the Lens Vignetting sliders to eliminate darkness around the edges of the 
image. When the Amount slider has a value other than 0, the Midpoint slider 
is active, which lets you compensate for the location of the vignette in the 
image. Keep in mind that the Lens Vignetting slider is intended to compen-
sate for problems in the image as it was captured. To add a vignette as a spe-
cial effect, use the Post Crop Vignetting sliders in the Effects pane (discussed 
in the following section).
 
The Effects pane of Camera Raw 6, shown in Figure 7-18, is used to add simu-
lated film grain and vignette effects. Instead of using Photoshop’s Artistic➪
Film Grain or Texture➪Grain filters, you may choose to simulate grain in 
Camera Raw. (Or perhaps you won’t add any film grain. Ever. Especially after 

152
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
you worked so hard to minimize 
luminance noise in your images. 
Your digital images.) The Post Crop 
Vignetting sliders are used to add a 
dark or light vignette effect (unlike 
the Vignette slider discussed in the 
preceding section, which is used to 
remove a vignette.) You can add a 
vignette before or after working with 
the Straighten and Crop tools. For 
both Grain and Post Crop Vignetting, 
adjust the Amount slider first to acti-
vate the other sliders. Experiment 
with the three style options to see 
which best suits your artistic vision.
Camera profiles, presets, 
and snapshots
You might want to use the Camera 
Calibration tab to compensate for 
what you perceive to be regular 
and consistent deviation in your 
particular camera’s behavior. You 
might, under some circumstances, 
want to use the sliders on the Camera 
Calibration tab (see Figure 7-19) to reduce a color cast, an unwanted color tint 
in the image. Use very small adjustments! Generally, though, you’ll skip the 
Camera Calibration tab completely.
If your particular camera model has had multiple profiles created, you’ll see 
them listed in the Name menu. These camera profiles correlate to the in-cam-
era settings you may have selected when capturing the image. (The content 
of the menu varies from one camera model to the next.)
Camera Raw’s Presets tab simply stores a convenient list of your saved pre-
sets. Any time you use the Save Settings command from the menu to the right 
of the tabbed area, your preset is added to the list for convenient one-click 
application. To use save settings, open an image in Camera Raw, open the 
Presets panel, click the profile, and click Open Image/Open Object or Done.
You may find the Snapshots panel to be very useful, especially when you’re 
working on perfecting a particularly difficult image. While you’re working 
on an image, if you think you’ve reached a good spot but want to continue 
playing around with the image, open the Snapshots panel and click the New 
Snapshot button to the lower-right. Name the snapshot (using a name that 
will actually mean something to you later) and then continue adjusting the 
image. If later you decide to return to the snapshot, simply select it in the 
Figure 7-18: Simulate film grain and vignettes 
in the Effects panel.

153
 Chapter 7: The Adobe Camera Raw 6 Plug-In
panel. The snapshots are saved 
in the file’s metadata, so you can 
always open the image into Camera 
Raw and select them sometime down 
the road. Snapshots are also a great 
way to save variations of an image 
for different purposes!
The Camera Raw buttons
In the lower-left and lower-right cor-
ners of Camera Raw are four buttons, 
three of which have hidden features 
that you access by pressing the 
Option/Alt key:
 
✓ Save Image . . ./Save Image: 
After making your adjustments, 
click the Save Image . . . button 
to save a copy of the image as 
a DNG, JPEG, TIFF, or PSD file. 
Option/Alt+click to bypass the 
Save Options dialog box and 
simply save the image using the 
most recently selected options.
 
✓ Open Image/Open Copy (or 
Open Object/Open Copy): 
After making your adjustments, 
click Open to update the file’s 
metadata and open the image in 
Photoshop itself. Holding down 
Option/Alt changes the button 
to Open Copy, which opens the 
image without updating the metadata. You might use Open Copy when 
creating a second version of the image while preserving your exactingly 
precise original adjustments. (Remember that a simple change in the 
Workflow Options — which you open by clicking the blue information 
line under the preview — enables you to automatically open an image 
from Camera Raw into Photoshop as a Smart Object.)
 
✓ Cancel/Reset: Clicking Cancel closes the Camera Raw window without 
making any changes to the image’s metadata. Holding down the Option/
Alt key changes the button to Reset, which restores the settings seen 
when you first opened the image in Camera Raw.
 
✓ Done: The Done button, with or without the Option/Alt key, simply 
updates the image’s metadata with the adjustments you’ve made and 
closes Camera Raw without opening the image.

Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
In This Chapter
▶ Telling Photoshop where to work with selections
▶ Masking for layer visibility and to protect parts of your image
▶ Keeping your options open with adjustment layers
T
here you are, repainting the bedroom — all by yourself, saving money, 
being productive — and it’s time to do the windows. Now, you probably 
don’t want to paint over the glass, right? Just the frame, the sash, the sill, 
those little whatch-ya-call-its between the panes, right? (Okay, technically the 
dividers between the panes are called muntins.) There are several ways you 
can avoid painting the glass. You can use a little brush and paint very care-
fully. You can use a larger brush, paint faster, and scrape the excess from the 
glass afterward. You can grab the masking tape, protect the glass, 
and paint as sloppily as you like — when the tape comes off, 
the glass is paint-free.
Those are unbelievably similar to the choices that you 
have in Photoshop when you need to work on only a 
part of your image. You can zoom in and use tools, 
dragging the cursor over only those pixels that you 
want to change (just like using a tiny paintbrush). 
You can use the History Brush feature (which I 
introduce in Chapter 1) to restore parts of the 
image to the original state (like scraping the glass). 
You can isolate the area of the image you want to 
change with a selection (much like protecting the rest 
of the image with masking tape).
In this chapter, you read about getting ready to make 
changes to your image rather than actually making those 
changes. You can isolate groups of pixels in your image in a vari-
ety of ways. For example, you can select pixels that are in the same part of 
the image (regardless of color), or you can select pixels that are the same 
color (regardless of location in the image). This is power: the ability to tell 

156
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Photoshop exactly which pixels you want to alter. After you make that selec-
tion, you can manipulate the pixels in a variety of ways — everything from 
making color and tonal adjustments to working with Photoshop’s creative 
filters to simply copying them so you can paste them into another image.
I discuss “taping the glass” first by making selections and then by using 
masks — channels that actually store selection information. After that, I tell 
you about working with adjustment layers, which are special layers that help 
you apply certain color and tonal adjustments without actually changing any 
pixels in the image. An adjustment layer even lets you restrict the change to 
one or several layers in the image.
What Is a Selection?
When you make a selection in your image, you’re simply isolating some of the 
pixels, picking them (selecting them) so that you can do something to those 
pixels without doing it to all the pixels in your image. Photoshop shows you 
what part of the image is within the selection with a flashing dashed line. 
(Now that you’re part of the Photoshop Inner Circle, you call that selection 
boundary the marching ants.)
Say, for example, that part of your image looks great, but part of the image 
looks, well, just plain wrong. Figure 8-1 is an excellent example.
Figure 8-1: Sometimes only part of the image needs changes.

157
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
By making a selection and applying an adjustment, I can make this image 
look much, much better. Of course, you might choose to make a different 
selection and apply a different adjustment, but you can see what I chose to 
do in the lower-left of Figure 8-2. By selecting the rails (in this case, with the 
Polygon Lasso tool, which I explain later in this chapter), I isolate those areas 
from the rest of the image, enabling me to change the color of those pixels 
without changing anything else. (Rather than selecting and darkening the 
rails to make them appear to be in front of a glow, I could have selected 
the lighter area and created a uniform sky color. But this is visually more 
interesting.)
Figure 8-2: The selection (shown to the right) restricts the change to some parts of the image.
The tonal and color adjustments that I discuss in Chapters 5 and 6 are often 
applied to an image as a whole. You can, however, apply them to specific 
areas of an image. Much of the rest of the work that you do in Photoshop is 
not global in nature, but rather is done to only restricted areas of your image. 
You use selections to do that restricting.
You can also use selections for a variety of other jobs in Photoshop. One 
of the most common is copying from one image and pasting into another. 
You can see one example in Figure 8-3. The subject of one image (upper left) 

158
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
is selected. You can see a close-up of the selection to the right. Choosing 
Edit➪Copy copies the selected pixels to the Clipboard. You can then 
switch to another image and use the Edit➪Paste command to drop those 
pixels into a second image (lower left). You can adjust the size by choosing 
Edit➪Transform➪Scale, adjust the position by dragging with the Move tool, 
and perhaps add some shadows by using the Brush tool. The composited pic-
ture is ready for whatever nefarious purpose you might have in mind!
Figure 8-3: Make a selection, copy, switch to another image, and paste.
 
Any pixel in your image can be selected, deselected, or partially selected. For 
example, if you have a selection and fill it with red, the selected pixels turn 
red, the deselected pixels don’t change, and the partially selected pixels get 
a red tint. How much tint depends on the level of selection. (Photoshop gen-
erally uses 8-bit grayscale for selections, so there are 256 different levels of 
“selected.”)

159
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
Feathering and Anti-Aliasing
You need to keep in mind a couple of very important terms as you read 
about the various tools and commands with which you make selections. Both 
feathering and anti-aliasing make the edges of your selections softer by using 
partially transparent or differently colored pixels. That, in turn, helps blend 
whatever you’re doing to that selection into the rest of the image.
 
Don’t forget that all pixels in your image are square, aligned in neat, orderly 
rows and columns. (That’s the raster in raster artwork.) When you create 
a curve or diagonal in your artwork, the corners of the pixels stick out. 
Feathering and anti-aliasing disguise that ragged edge. You can also use 
feathering to create larger, softer selections with a faded edge. Generally 
speaking, use anti-aliasing to keep edges looking neat and use feathering to 
create a soft, faded selection.
Nothing illustrates the power of feathering quite like a simple black-on-white 
demonstration, as you see in Figure 8-4. In the upper-left, I made an unfeath-
ered selection and filled it with black. To the upper-right, the filled selection 
is exactly the same size but has a 2-pixel feather. Below, I used a 15-pixel 
feather when making the selection.
Figure 8-4: A close-up look at no feathering, feathering, and lots of feathering.

160
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
 
Note that there’s feathering on both sides of the selection border. And don’t 
be fooled by the amount that you enter in the Feather field on the Options 
bar — that’s a general guideline, not a precise value. A 15-pixel feather for the 
Elliptical Marquee tool might give you 50 or 60 partially transparent pixels, 
half on either side of the selection border. Even a 1-pixel feather gives you a 
selection with several “soft” pixels on either side.
Anti-aliasing is similar to feathering 
in that it softens edges: It’s designed 
to hide the corners of pixels along 
curves and in diagonal lines. You use 
anti-aliasing with type (as I explain 
in Chapter 13). You’ll often find that 
anti-aliasing is all you need to keep 
the edges of your selections pretty; 
feathering isn’t required. Anti-
aliasing is a yes/no option, with no 
numeric field to worry about. Figure 
8-5 compares a diagonal with no anti-
aliasing, with anti-aliasing, and with a 
1-pixel feather.
At 100 percent zoom (to the upper 
left), the first line looks bumpy along 
the edges (it has a case of the jaggies, you would complain to a friend or co-
worker). The lower line looks soft and mushy, out of focus. And the middle 
line? To quote Goldilocks, “It’s just right!” When zoomed to 600 percent, you 
can really see those jaggies and that softening. And in the middle, you see 
that the anti-aliasing uses light gray and mid-gray pixels interspersed along 
the edge among the black pixels. At 100 percent zoom (upper left), your eye 
is fooled into seeing a straight black edge.
Generally speaking, use anti-aliasing with just about every selection (other 
than rectangular or square), and use feathering when you want to really 
soften the edges to create a special effect.
Making Your Selections with Tools
Photoshop offers you nine tools whose whole purpose in life is to help you 
make selections. You also use those tools to alter your selections by adding 
to, subtracting from, and intersecting with an existing selection. The nine 
selection tools are divided into three groups:
 
✓ Four marquee tools
 
✓ Three lasso tools
 
✓ The Quick Selection tool and the Magic Wand
Figure 8-5: Anti-aliasing helps smooth the 
appearance of curves and diagonals.

161
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
Marquee selection tools
You have four marquee selection tools, although you’ll generally use only 
two of them. Figure 8-6 shows the marquee selection tools, along with each 
tool’s Options bar configuration. (Note that the Refine Edge button is only 
available when you have an active selection in your image.)
Figure 8-6: Marquee selection tools come in four flavors, two of which are tasty.
You drag the very useful Rectangular Marquee and Elliptical Marquee tools to 
make selections. Click and drag in any direction to make your selection. After 
you start dragging, hold down the Shift key (while still dragging) to constrain 
proportions. When you constrain the proportions of a selection, you create 
a square or circle rather than a rectangle or an ellipse. If you start dragging a 
selection and press the Option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) key, the selection cen-
ters itself on the point where you click. The Shift and Option/Alt keys can be 
used together. Holding down the Shift key before you click and drag adds the 
selection to any existing selection. Holding down the Option/Alt key before 
dragging subtracts the new selection from any existing selection.
The Single Row Marquee and Single Column Marquee tools are simply clicked 
at the point where you want a 1-pixel selection, running from side to side or 
from top to bottom. These tools create selections that extend the full width 
or full height of your image. You might use these tools to create a gridlike 
selection that you can fill with color. Or you might never use them at all.
Take another glance at the Options bars in Figure 8-6. The four buttons to the 
left in the Options bar, which you can use with any of the tools, determine 
how the tool interacts with an existing selection.

162
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
 
✓ New Selection: When you select the first button, any selection that you 
make replaces an active selection (deselecting any previous selection). 
If, with a selection tool, you click inside an active selection when the 
first option is active, you can drag that selection in your image without 
moving any pixels. When you haven’t already made a selection, these 
tools always make a new selection, regardless of which button is active.
 
✓ Add To: When you have an active selection and need to add to that 
selection, use the second button or simply press and hold down the 
Shift key while dragging.
 
✓ Subtract From: When you have a selection and need to deselect part of 
it, use the third button. Say, for example, that you make a round selec-
tion and want to chop out the middle to make a donut shape. Click the 
third button and then drag within the original selection to deselect the 
donut hole.
 
✓ Intersect With: You have a selection, but you want to keep only part 
of the selection. You could set your selection tool to subtract from the 
existing selection, or you could intersect with that original selection and 
deselect a number of areas at once.
Figure 8-7 presents a visual explanation of how all four buttons work. On the 
left, you see the selected option for the active marquee selection tool. Next 
is an original selection. In the third column, you see another selection being 
made (with the selection tool dragged from the lower right to the upper left). 
Finally, on the right, you see the result of combining the two selections.
In the bottommost example, you could do a whole series of subtractions from 
the existing selection to chop off the “points,” but using the intersect option 
takes care of the job with a single drag.
 
While you’re dragging a selection with the Rectangular Marquee or the 
Elliptical Marquee tool, you can hold down the mouse button and press and 
hold the spacebar to reposition the marquee. When you have it where you 
want it, release the spacebar and continue to drag.
Take another look at the four views of the Options bar shown earlier in 
Figure 8-6. Take note of these variations among them:
 
✓ Anti-aliasing isn’t available for the Rectangular Marquee tool. That’s 
because all four edges of the selection will align perfectly with the edges 
of the pixels — no need to disguise corners of pixels. (You can, 
of course, soften the selection with feathering.)
 
✓ Both the Rectangular Marquee and the Elliptical Marquee tools offer the 
options of Normal (unconstrained, just drag as necessary), Fixed Aspect 
Ratio (the relationship between width and height you specify in the 

163
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
Options bar is maintained as you drag), and Fixed Size (just click in the 
upper-left corner of your intended selection).
 
✓ The Single Row Marquee and Single Column Marquee tools offer the four 
buttons to determine how the tool will interact with an existing selection 
and the Feather field. Although feathering a 1-pixel wide or tall selection 
seems a little strange. . .
Figure 8-7: The buttons at the left on the Options bar control selection interaction.
Lasso selection tools
Three lasso selection tools are available in Photoshop CS5. On the Options 
bar, all three of the lasso selection tools offer you the same basic features 
that you find in the marquee selection tools, as you can see in Figure 8-8. You 
can add to, subtract from, or intersect with an existing selection. You also 
have the feathering and anti-aliasing options available. The Magnetic Lasso 
tool offers three additional settings that help determine how it identifies 
edges as you drag.

164
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 8-8: The basic options for the lasso selection tools match those for the marquee 
selection tools.
So what makes lasso tools different from a marquee tool? Read on to find out:
 
✓ Lasso tool: The Lasso tool is a true freeform tool; that is, you click and drag 
it wherever you want the selection to go. You can drag around and return 
to the starting point, or you can release the mouse button anywhere, and 
your selection is finished along a straight line from that point to the spot 
where you start your selection. If you press and hold the Option/Alt key 
while dragging, you’ll temporarily switch to the Polygon Lasso tool.
Controlled selections
Lurking within the Options bar Style drop-
down menu are two options worth noting: 
Fixed Aspect Ratio and Fixed Size. Using the 
Fixed Aspect Ratio option with the Rectangular 
Marquee or the Elliptical Marquee tool forces 
the selection to the height and width relation-
ship that you specify in the Options bar. This is 
great for composing an image that you need at 
a specific size, say to fit in a standard 5 x 7-inch 
picture frame. The selection tool won’t resize 
the image for you, but you can make the selec-
tion and choose Image➪Crop and then choose 
Image➪Image Size to resize to your required 
dimensions and resolution. (Read about resizing 
and cropping your images in Chapter 4.)
The Fixed Size option changes the behavior of 
the tools. After you enter an exact width and 
height in the Options bar, position the cursor 
in the upper-left corner of the area that you 
want to select and click once — the selec-
tion is created to the lower right of that point. 
Don’t worry about being exact because you 
can drag the selection marquee into position 
afterward. (You’ll want to have the leftmost of 
the four buttons on the Options bar selected to 
reposition your selection.) And take a look at the 
button between the Width and Height fields on 
the Options bar: When you’re using the Fixed 
Aspect Ratio or Fixed Size styles, click that 
button to swap the values in the two fields.

✓ Polygon Lasso tool: Rather than dragging, you click-click-click to make 
straight selection segments, at any angle, for any distance. When you 
position the cursor directly over your starting point, a little circle 
appears to the lower right of the cursor to indicate that you’re back to 
the start. Or simply double-click to finish the selection. If you press and 
hold the Option/Alt key while dragging, you’ll temporarily switch to the 
regular Lasso tool, which lets you drag your selection any way you want. 
Using the Option/Alt key lets you switch back and forth between the 
freeform drag of the Lasso tool and the perfectly straight selection bor-
ders of the Polygon Lasso tool.
 
✓ Magnetic Lasso tool: When you need to select around a subject that has 
good contrast with its background, the Magnetic Lasso tool can do a 
great job. The perfect candidate for this tool is a simple object on a very 
plain background. You can, however, use it with just about any image 
where the edges of the area you want to select differ substantially from 
the rest of the image. Click and drag the tool along the edge of your 
subject. If the tool misses the edge, back up and drag along the edge 
again. If the edge makes a sudden change in direction, click to add an 
anchor point. If the tool places an anchor point in the wrong spot, back 
up and then press Delete/Backspace to remove the point. (By the way, if 
you have a Wacom pressure-sensitive tablet hooked up, you can set the 
Magnetic Lasso tool to vary its width according to pen pressure. Use the 
button just to the right of the Frequency field on the Options bar.)
 
 The Magnetic Lasso tool works by identifying the difference in color 
along the edges, using all available color channels. From the Options 
bar, use the Width field to tell the tool how wide of an area it can look 
in to find an edge. The edge Contrast field tells the tool how much the 
edge must differ while searching. Use the Frequency field to choose the 
number of anchor points the tool sets while outlining the selection.
The Quick Selection tool
Consider the Quick Selection tool to 
be sort of a color-based-selection-in-a-
brush. You drag the tool through an area 
of color and, based on the color varia-
tions under the brush and the brush 
size, the tool automatically selects simi-
lar colors in the surrounding area. Keep 
in mind that you can adjust the brush 
size as you work by using the square 
bracket keys, [ and ]. (When working 
with a Wacom tablet, this tool works 
great with brush size set to pen pres-
sure.) The Auto-Enhance option in the 
Options bar may slow down the perfor-
mance of the Quick Selection tool a bit, 
Figure 8-9: Drag through an area of color 
to select the pixels under the brush and 
nearby pixels of similar color.

166
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
but the great job it does analyzing edges usually produces a better selection. 
With just a little practice, you’ll likely find the Quick Selection tool to be quite 
simple to use, even for rather complex selections (see Figure 8-9).
The Magic Wand tool
The Magic Wand tool selects pixels similar in color to the pixel on which 
you click with the tool. Like the other selection commands, you can add to, 
subtract from, or intersect with an existing selection, and you can select anti-
aliasing. Tolerance determines how closely pixels must match your target 
color to be included in the selection. When you enable the Contiguous check 
box and then click a spot, only pixels connected to the spot by pixels of the 
same color are selected. The Sample All Layers option lets you make a selec-
tion of similarly colored pixels on every visible layer in your image, not just 
the currently active layer.
When you use a low Tolerance setting, you select only those pixels in the 
image that are very similar to the pixel on which you click. A high Tolerance 
setting gives you a much wider range of color, which might or might not be 
appropriate for the selection you’re making.
Refine Edge
 
Technically, Refine Edge doesn’t qualify as a new feature in Photoshop, but 
the capabilities are so enhanced in Photoshop CS5, that it deserves that little 
icon to the left anyway. The folks at Adobe took a good idea, implemented it 
well, and have now — what’s the word I’m looking for? — refined it to make 
it truly amazing. The new Refine Edge joins the ranks of Photoshop’s most 
impressive features.
You may have noticed the Refine Edge button in Figures 8-6, 8-8, and 8-9. It 
sits quietly to the right of the other options in the Options bar, waiting for 
you to click. Not only does Refine Edge have a whole lot of new capabilities, 
but it’s got a whole new look, too. Take a gander at Figure 8-10 to see the new 
Refine Edge dialog box.
Here’s what you need to know about each of the options in Refine Edge:
 
✓ View Mode: Click on the downward-pointing triangle to select from 
among several different ways to view the selection you’re refining. Using 
a black or white or red mask is great for many images, but the new On 
Layers option shows you the content of the selection as if it was floating 
on a separate layer. Show Radius and Show Original are great for a quick 
preview of what you’re doing, but you’ll generally take a look and then 
disable those options. The keyboard shortcuts for the various views are 
also handy, especially X to disable all views and show the original and 
F to cycle through the view modes to see which is most appropriate for 
the current task.

167
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
Figure 8-10: With the addition of various output options, Refine Edge has become a much 
more powerful feature.
 
✓ Edge Detection: The Radius slider determines how much of an area 
surrounding the initial selection will be refined. The Smart Radius 
option enables Refine Edge to differentiate between hard edges and 
soft edges — think in terms of the edge between the subject’s shirt and 
the background (usually a well-defined “hard” edge) versus the sub-
ject’s hair and the background (usually a fuzzy “soft” edge). 
 
✓ Adjust Edge: Smoothing the selection edge minimizes any jagged areas. 
Feathering (as described earlier in this chapter) softens the edge. Contrast 
makes the selection edge more distinct. (You rarely use Feather and 
Contrast together.) Shift Edge expands or contracts the selection edge. 
 
✓ Output: Here’s where the new Refine Edge really rocks! Instead of clicking 
OK and seeing a newly-refined selection marching around some pixels in 
your image, you now also have the options of clicking OK and producing a 
layer mask (background layers are automatically converted), a new layer 
with only the content of the refined selection, a new layer using a layer 
mask to reveal the content of the selection, a new document with only the 
content of the selection, or a new document consisting of a layer using a 
layer mask to reveal the content of the selection! The new Decontaminate 
Colors can do a great job of eliminating that fringe of background color 

168
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
that sometimes appears when you’re making complex selections. (With 
this option selected, you output to a new layer or document, with or with-
out a layer mask.) 
 
✓ Tools: To the upper-left in Refine Edge are the usual Zoom and Hand 
tools for inspecting your work up close. New, however, are the Refine 
Radius and Erase Refinements tools. Refine Radius can selectively soften 
the selection edge where you drag. Use the Erase Refinements tool to 
reverse changes made with the Refine Radius tool, or use the Option/Alt 
key to toggle between the two brushes.
 
✓ Remember Settings: If you hit upon a sweet set of refinement settings 
that look like they are a sure-fire answer to most of your selection chal-
lenges, by all means make sure to select the Remember Settings box 
before you click OK. Refine Edge then starts with those preferred set-
tings each time you open the dialog box.
 
Refine Edge does double duty as Refine Mask, which can be used to tweak an 
existing layer mask. In the Layers panel, click on the layer mask thumbnail to 
make it active. From the Select menu, choose Refine Mask. Use the options 
discussed in the previous list, elect to output to a layer mask, and click OK. 
The selected layer mask is updated to reflect the changes you specified in 
Refine Mask.
Your Selection Commands
You have 17 menu commands at your service when selecting pixels in your 
artwork. Some, like those near the top of the Select menu, are rather simple 
and aptly named. See Figure 8-11 for a list of the Select commands. (The All 
Layers, Deselect Layers, and Similar Layers commands are not used to select 
pixels, but rather to change the activation of layers in the Layers panel.)
The primary selection commands
The commands near the top of the Select menu are features that you’re likely 
to use regularly. (Okay, maybe not the Reselect command.) Memorizing their 
keyboard shortcuts and using them regularly is a timesaver.
 
✓ Select All (Ô+A/Ctrl+A): Select All does exactly what the name implies — 
it makes a selection of all the pixels in your image on the active layer (or 
in an active layer mask).
 
✓ Deselect (Ô+D/Ctrl+D): Use the Deselect command to make sure that 
no pixels are selected. This is a handy command when it seems that 
a tool, or a filter or adjustment command, isn’t working. There could 
be an unnoticed selection in the image, preventing the command from 
appearing how — or where — you expect.

169
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
 
✓ Reselect (Ô+Shift+D/
Ctrl+Shift+D): This is a great 
little command for those times 
when you’re making a complex 
selection, and a little slip acci-
dentally deselects. Just use 
Reselect to restore the most 
recent selection. Or use the 
Undo command.
 
✓ Inverse (Ô+Shift+I/Ctrl+Shift+I): 
The Inverse command reverses 
the selection. What was selected 
is deselected, and what wasn’t 
selected becomes selected. 
(Don’t forget to include the Shift 
key — without it, you invert the 
colors in your image rather than 
your selection!)
The Color Range 
command
In its own little group, right in the 
middle of the Select menu, is the incredibly powerful Color Range command. 
Rather than dragging the Quick Selection tool or Shift+clicking with the Magic 
Wand, you can select by color quickly and easily with the Color Range com-
mand. In Figure 8-12, I clicked and dragged through some orange areas in 
the image with the middle Eyedropper tool. You can also click once with the 
left eyedropper and use the other eyedroppers to add and subtract colors 
from the selection. The Fuzziness slider near the top of the dialog box deter-
mines how close a color must be to those through which you dragged to be 
included in the selection.
Here are a couple of ways that you can get a better look at your selection as you 
create it. In Figure 8-13, you see the options available from the Selection Preview 
menu. The Grayscale (upper left) and Black Matte (upper right) do a good job of 
showing that the background will be partially selected if you click OK. You can 
lower the Fuzziness or use the eyedropper on the right to click in those areas 
of the fence that shouldn’t be selected. The White Matte (lower left) does an 
excellent job of showing that the tips of some leaves below the blooms will also 
be selected. (Ignore that and Option+drag/Alt+drag with the Lasso tool later to 
deselect that area.) Because of the color of this image’s subject, the red Quick 
Mask preview (lower right) is almost worthless for this image, although it is often 
good with other images that don’t have red and orange.
Figure 8-11: The Deselect or Reselect 
command — or both — are always grayed 
out, depending on whether there’s an active 
selection in your image.

170
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 8-12: The Color Range feature selects by color.
Figure 8-13: Color Range offers four ways to preview — five, if you include None.

171
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
The Localized Color Clusters option looks for distinct areas of the selected 
color and tightens up edges along those “clusters” of color. When your target 
color appears distinctly in different areas of the image, this option is a plus. 
When selecting a range of color with subtle transitions, deselect this option. 
(Think “leopard’s spots” compared to “blue sky.”)
The pop-up menu at the top of the Color Range dialog box lets you pick 
among the RGB (red/green/blue) and CMY (cyan/magenta/yellow) colors, 
as well as the image’s highlights, midtones, or shadows, and even any out-
of-gamut colors in the image (colors that can’t be reproduced within the 
selected color space). When you choose one of the presets from the top 
menu, the Fuzziness slider isn’t available, limiting that feature’s value.
Selection modification commands
The next group of commands in the Select menu actually holds six separate 
commands, including Refine Edge (discussed earlier in this chapter), and 
the five Modify commands (shown in Figure 8-11), each of which has a single 
numeric field.
The Border option creates a selection of your specified width, centered on the 
original marching ants visible in the image window. It’s great for creating bor-
ders or vignettes and can also be used to delete pixels along a selection edge 
to neaten it up. The other four commands are poor cousins to the control you 
have in the Refine Edge dialog box — none of them offers a slider or a pre-
view. However, if you know exactly how many pixels you need to smooth or 
expand or contract or feather, these commands are quick and simple.
As you make your way down the Select menu, you come across the Grow 
and Similar commands, which are somewhat like the Magic Wand with 
Contiguous (Grow) and without Contiguous (Similar) selected on the Options 
bar. (In fact, they use the Magic Wand’s Tolerance setting.) Grow adds to 
your selection any adjacent pixels of the appropriate color, and Similar 
looks throughout the entire image for similarly colored pixels. Use Grow and 
Similar when your initial selection consists primarily of a single color. Using 
these commands with a selection that contains lots of different colors gener-
ally results in most of your image being selected.
Transforming the shape of selections
As you work with selections, you might find times when the selection capa-
bility doesn’t match your need. For example, the Elliptical Marquee tool 
can certainly make oval selections, but those ovals are either vertical or 
horizontal. What if you need an oval selection at an angle? That’s where the 
Select➪Transform command comes into play. Make your initial selection, 
choose the Transform Selection command, and then manipulate the selection 
to fit your needs, as shown in Figure 8-14.

172
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 8-14: The many faces of transformations.
Here’s what you see in Figure 8-14:
 
✓ Top left: This is the original selection.
 
✓ Top center: Click an anchor point on any side of the bounding box and 
drag to change the height or width of the selection.
 
✓ Top right: Position the cursor outside the bounding box and drag to 
rotate.
 
✓ Middle left: Drag any corner anchor point to manipulate the selection’s 
width and height at the same time.
 
✓ Middle center: Hold down the Shift key while dragging a corner anchor 
point to avoid distorting the selection while changing size.

173
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
 
✓ Middle right: Hold down the Option/Alt key while dragging a corner 
anchor point, and you end up scaling the image based on that crosshair 
in the center of the bounding box. (You can drag that crosshair any-
where, even outside the bounding box, to change the point of transfor-
mation.) You can use the Shift key with Option/Alt, too.
 
✓ Bottom left: Hold down the Ô/Ctrl key and drag any side anchor point to 
skew.
 
✓ Bottom center: Hold down the Ô/Ctrl key and drag a corner anchor 
point to distort.
 
✓ Bottom right: If you Ô/Ctrl+drag two or four corner anchor points, you 
can add perspective to the selection. I might, for example, fill this trans-
formed selection with color, move the selection, scale it down a bit, 
fill again, and repeat a number of times to create a series of paw prints 
marching into the distance.
Edit in Quick Mask mode
With Photoshop’s Quick Mask mode, you make a basic selection, enter Quick 
Mask mode (by using the Select➪Edit in Quick Mask Mode command, clicking 
the button at the bottom of the Toolbox, or by pressing Q on the keyboard), 
edit the selection as if it were a mask, and then exit Quick Mask mode (by 
deselecting this command in the Select menu, by clicking again on the button 
in the Toolbox, or by pressing Q again). Heck, you don’t even have to start 
with a selection! In Quick Mask mode, your mask appears on-screen as a red 
overlay, just like the red overlay for Refine Edge or Color Range (as you can 
see in Figure 8-13). Paint, apply filters or adjustments, or make selections — 
anything you can do to a grayscale image, you can do in Quick Mask mode. 
(The following sections go into further details on working in masks.)
 
If you’re more comfortable with the Brush tool than the Lasso tool, you might 
want to use Quick Mask mode to make all your selections. You might find it 
faster and easier to “paint” a selection 
in Quick Mask mode rather than to drag 
a selection with a lasso tool or use the 
selection commands. Enter Quick Mask 
mode, paint the mask, exit Quick Mask 
mode, and you have your selection. You 
can also enter and exit Quick Mask 
mode by clicking the button at the 
bottom of the Toolbox. Double-clicking 
the button opens the Quick Mask 
Options dialog box (as shown in Figure 
8-15). You can reverse the behavior of 
the overlay, making it show selected 
areas instead of the deselected areas, 
Figure 8-15: You can change the opacity 
and color of the Quick Mask overlay.

174
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
and you can change the color and opacity of the overlay. (Hop back to Figure 
8-13 to see how hard it is to see the edges of the orange blooms with the red 
overlay. Changing the overlay to, say, blue would solve that problem.)
 
By default, you paint with black in Quick Mask mode over areas that you 
don’t want selected, paint with white over areas that you do want selected, 
and paint with shades of gray over areas that you want partially selected.
The mask-related selection commands
At the bottom of the Select menu, you see a pair of commands that you use 
to store your selections for future use and to actually reuse them. When you 
save a selection, you create an alpha channel in the image. The alpha chan-
nel, like a color channel, is a grayscale representation of the image. White 
areas in the alpha channel represent areas that are selected when the chan-
nel is loaded as a selection. Black areas in the channel show you deselected 
areas. Gray represents feathering and other partially selected pixels.
I discuss channels in greater depth in the next section of this chapter. While 
you’re exploring selection commands, the key points to remember are that 
you can use the Save Selection command to save any selection as an alpha 
channel, and then later you can use the Load Selection command to reacti-
vate the selection without having to re-create it from scratch.
Masks: Not Just for Halloween Anymore
In Photoshop, a mask is a channel (in the Channels panel) that stores informa-
tion about a selection or about layer visibility (or that can be used with certain 
filters as a bump map, a grayscale representation of 3D in the image). When 
you talk about selections saved as masks, you can refer to them as alpha chan-
nels. Any time you make a complex selection, consider saving it as an alpha 
channel, just in case. So what exactly counts as complex? That depends on how 
much time you have on your hands. If it takes me more than a minute or two 
to do anything in Photoshop, I want to save it. And what counts as just in case? 
You might need to return to the image at some later date to make changes, you 
might need to shut down for the day, or maybe you’ll even (fingers crossed 
against!) have a crash. Save your selections, just in case. . .
Saving and loading selections
Creating an alpha channel from a selection is as simple as choosing Select➪
Save Selection and selecting a name for the new channel. If you have more 
than one document of exactly the same pixel dimensions open in Photoshop, 
you can select any of the available documents for the new channel. If you 
already saved a selection as an alpha channel, you can elect to have the 

175
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
two selections interact in a single channel. As you see in Figure 8-16, the 
Operation choices parallel those that you find on the Options bar when work-
ing with selection tools: You can replace the selected channel, add to the 
existing channel, subtract from the existing channel, or intersect with that 
existing channel.
Figure 8-16: When you already have an alpha channel, the new selection can modify it.
When you need to work with a saved selection, choose Select➪Load 
Selection or simply Ô+click/Ctrl+click the alpha channel’s thumbnail in 
the Channels panel — either activates the selection.
The Load Selection dialog box offers the same key features that you see for 
Save Selection. (Refer to Figure 8-16.) When loading a selection, you can 
add to, subtract from, or intersect with an active selection. You can also 
invert a selection when loading by selecting the Invert check box. Using that 
check box produces the same result as loading the selection and choosing 
Select➪Inverse, but it’s faster and easier.

176
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Editing an alpha channel
Alpha channels, like color channels, are grayscale representations. As such, 
you can edit them like you would any grayscale image. Click the channel 
in the Channels panel to make it active and visible. You see it in the image 
window as a grayscale (or black and white) representation of the saved selec-
tion. If you want to see the image while you work on the channel, click in the 
left column (the eyeball column) to the left of the RGB (or CMYK) channel. 
The alpha channel then appears as a red overlay on top of the image, just like 
working in Quick Mask mode or using the red overlay in Refine Edge or Color 
Range. Figure 8-17 shows you what the screen looks like with just the alpha 
channel visible (left) and how it appears when the alpha channel is active 
and the RGB channel is also visible. Also take a look at the difference in the 
Channels panel. See the eyeball column on the left?
Figure 8-17: You can see just the alpha channel itself (left) or as a red overlay (right).
Here are some of the things that you might want to do to an active alpha 
channel:
 
✓ Blur the alpha channel. Blurring an alpha channel (Filter➪Blur com-
mands) is much like feathering a selection — it softens the edges. One 
of the big differences is that you can see a preview of the blur, which is 
much better than guessing how much feathering you need while drag-
ging a selection tool.
 
✓ Sharpen the alpha channel. Sharpening a saved selection (Filter➪
Sharpen commands) makes the edges cleaner and more precise.
 
✓ Paint in the alpha channel. Painting with the Brush tool using black, 
white, and gray in the channel changes the selection. Paint with white to 

177
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
add areas to the saved selection; paint with black to remove areas from 
the selection; paint with shades of gray to partially select areas of the 
image. You can edit an alpha channel with the Brush tool very precisely, 
adding and eliminating stray pixels, as well as creating precise edges.
 
✓ Use Levels or Curves on the alpha channel. If the saved selection has 
feathering or other areas of partial selection (grays in the alpha chan-
nel), you can manipulate them with a Levels or Curves adjustment (from 
the Image➪Adjustments menu). The Levels adjustment is particularly 
appropriate for controlling the feathering along an edge.
 
✓ Apply one or more filters to an alpha channel. Use artistic filters on a 
saved selection to create special effects, such as borders and frames. 
Chapter 15 covers filters.
Adding masks to layers and Smart Objects
When your image has multiple layers (as I discuss in Chapter 10), includ-
ing Smart Objects, you can partially hide the content of the layer or Smart 
Object with layer masks. Layer masks and alpha channels have much in 
common: Layer masks are selections saved as channels, you can paint in the 
layer mask, you can apply filters and adjustments to the layer mask, and so 
on. Just keep in mind that a layer mask appears in the Channels panel only 
when you select its layer in the Layers panel. (In the Layers panel, you’ll see 
the layer mask thumbnail to the right of the layer’s thumbnail.) If you want 
to edit a layer mask, click its thumbnail in the Layers panel and then edit it 
as you would an alpha channel or use Select➪Refine Mask to edit the mask 
as you would edit a selection with Refine Edge. Remember to click the layer 
thumbnail afterward to reactivate the layer itself.
The easiest way to add a layer mask is to make a selection of the pixels that 
you want visible on that layer and then click the Add Layer Mask button 
at the bottom of the Layers panel (third button from the left). You can 
also make a selection and choose Layer➪Layer Mask➪Reveal Selection or 
Layer➪Add Layer Mask➪Hide Selection. That menu also offers Reveal All and 
Hide All as well as commands to disable (hide) or delete the layer mask. You 
can also apply the layer mask, which deletes any hidden pixels on that layer.
By default, the layer mask is linked to the layer or Smart Object. If you drag 
the layer, the mask comes right along, staying in alignment. If you like, you 
can unlink the mask from the layer content by clicking on the Link icon 
between the two thumbnails in the Layers panel. Re-link the mask to the layer 
content by clicking in the empty space between the thumbnails.
 
A layer named Background (in italics) in the Layers panel can’t have any 
transparent areas, so you can’t add a layer mask. Not a problem! Simply 
double-click the layer name in the Layers panel and rename the layer. That 
converts it to a regular layer, which would be more than happy to accept 
your layer mask.

178
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Masking with vector paths
A layer or Smart Object can also be masked with a vector path. (Paths are 
explained in Chapter 11.) Vector masks have very precise edges, and you 
can edit them as a path with the Direct Selection tool. A layer (other than 
a Background layer) can have both a regular pixel-based layer mask and a 
vector mask. To show up in your artwork, pixels on that layer must be within 
both the layer mask and the vector mask. When a layer has both a layer mask 
and a vector mask, the vector mask thumbnail appears to the right in the 
Layers panel.
Adjustment Layers: Controlling Changes
Photoshop gives you the capability of making tonal and color adjustments 
that you can later refine, change, or delete. Most of the adjustment com-
mands (discussed in Chapters 5 and 6) are available as adjustment layers. 
An adjustment layer applies the selected change to color or tonality just as 
the comparable command would, but using an adjustment layer offers a few 
major advantages:
 
✓ Adjustable adjustments: You can reopen an adjustment layer’s dialog 
box at any time to change the settings.
 
✓ Reversible adjustments: You can delete an adjustment layer, removing 
the change from your image.
 
✓ Hidden adjustments: Click the eyeball column to the left of the adjust-
ment layer in the Layers panel to temporarily hide that change.
 
✓ Tweakable adjustments: You can change the opacity and blending mode 
of adjustment layers to fine-tune the effect.
 
✓ Limitable adjustments: You can add layer masks and vector masks to 
your adjustment layers to restrict their effect to only some of the pixels 
below. And you can later edit the masks as necessary.
Because of the added flexibility, you’ll generally want to use adjustment 
layers rather than adjustment commands in your images. Of course, you still 
need the Image➪Adjustments menu for those several commands that can’t 
be added through an adjustment layer.
Adding an adjustment layer
Photoshop uses the Adjustments panel (shown in Figure 8-18) as a quick and 
easy way to add adjustment layers to your images. Open the panel, select a 
preset or, for a custom adjustment, click on the button for the type of adjust-
ment layer you want to add. The Adjustment panel changes to a small ver-
sion of that particular adjustment’s dialog box, presenting you with the same 
options you have when using the Image➪Adjustments menu.

179
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
Figure 8-18: To the left, the basic Adjustments panel; to the right, a 
Curves adjustment layer being added to the image.
When an adjustment layer is selected in the Layers panel, several buttons 
appear at the bottom of the panel (to the right in Figure 8-18):
 
✓ Add another adjustment layer: Click the left-pointing arrow and another 
adjustment layer will be added above the layer you just completed.
 
✓ Toggle between Expanded and Standard views: The Expanded view 
of the panel is simply a larger version of the panel. This is useful, per-
haps, when you’re adding a Curves or Levels adjustment; otherwise, 
it’s unnecessary.
 
✓ Clip the adjustment layer to the layer immediately below: Click the 
button to toggle between the adjustment layer being applied to only the 
one layer immediately below in the Layers panel and it being applied 
to all layers below. (Clipping adjustment layers is explained more com-
pletely in the next section.)
 
✓ Toggle adjustment layer visibility: Click on the eyeball button to hide 
the current adjustment layer; click again to show it. Use this button to 
preview the adjustment as you work.
 
✓ Review previous adjustment: Click and hold down the mouse button 
to see the image as adjusted prior to returning to the adjustment layer. 
Say, for example, that you have added a Curves adjustment layer and 
later return to the Adjustments panel to tweak the curve a bit. To see 
the difference between the current appearance of the image and the 

180
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
appearance of the image with the original Curves adjustment, use this 
button. If you prefer the untweaked version, use the Undo command.
 
✓ Reset adjustment: Click the curled arrow button toward the right to 
reset the current adjustment to the adjustment’s default settings.
 
✓ Delete adjustment layer: Click the Trash icon to the far right at the 
bottom of the Adjustment panel to delete the current adjustment layer.
You can also add an adjustment layer through the menu at the bottom of 
the Layers panel (click the fourth button from the left) and then move the 
cursor to the type of adjustment layer that you want to add or through 
the Layer➪New Adjustment Layer submenu. The choices are the same. 
When you select the particular adjustment that you want to add from the 
bottom of the Layers panel, that specific adjustment’s options appear in the 
Adjustments panel. (Selecting the adjustment through the Layers menu pres-
ents you with the New Layer dialog box first.)
 
The top three options in the menu that you open from the Layers panel are 
fill layers — layers completely filled with a color, gradient, or pattern. You 
can add a new empty layer and choose Edit➪Fill to do the same thing, or 
you can add such a layer through the Layer➪New Fill Layer menu. (Note that 
these three options are not available through the Adjustment panel.)
Limiting your adjustments
When your image has multiple layers and you want to apply an adjustment 
layer to only one layer, the new adjustment layer must be clipped — restricted 
to the one layer immediately below it in the Layers panel. (That’s the layer 
that’s active when you add the adjustment layer.) You can clip it to the layer 
below by Option+clicking/Alt+clicking the line between the two layers in the 
Layers panel (which is also how you unclip a pair of layers). When working 
in the Adjustments panel, click the third button at the bottom of the panel 
to clip the new adjustment layer to the layer below. Figure 8-19 shows the 
difference between a clipped adjustment layer (left) and an unclipped adjust-
ment layer (right). When unclipped, the adjustment is applied to all the 
layers below rather than to the one layer immediately below. When adding 
an adjustment layer through the Layers menu, select the option Use Previous 
Layer to Create Clipping Mask.
On the left side of Figure 8-19, the Hue/Saturation adjustment is applied only 
to the upper layer — the layer named Symbol. On the right, the adjustment 
layer isn’t clipped, so it changes both the Symbol layer and the Background 
layer. By the way, the thumbnail in the Layers panel shows the Symbol lay-
er’s original copper color prior to the addition of the Hue/Saturation adjust-
ment layer. Among the beauties of using adjustment layers is the joy you 
might feel when the client says, “Yup, you were right — let’s go back to the 
original design.”

181
 Chapter 8: Fine-Tuning Your Fixes
Figure 8-19: Restrict an adjustment to one layer by clipping it to the layer.
In the Layers panel on the left in Figure 8-19, you can see the so-called “wed-
ding rings” icon between the adjustment layer and the layer named Symbol 
immediately below. That’s the icon that you see when Option+clicking/
Alt+clicking to clip (or unclip) layers.
 
But what if you want an adjustment layer to change, say, three of the layers 
in your image? Create a layer group from the layers (click the New Group 
button at the bottom of the Layers panel and drag the layers into the Group 
icon in the panel), add the adjustment layer within the group and above the 
layers in the group, and change the layer group’s blending mode from Pass 
Through to Normal at the top of the Layers panel. The adjustment layer, 
within the layer group and at the top of the layer group, is applied to all your 
layers in the group and only the layers in that group.
 
Because they’re layers, you can use a layer mask to apply the adjustment 
layer to only part of your layer. You may find it easier to make a selection 
of the area where you want the adjustment before selecting the adjustment 
layer — the mask will be automatically created from the selection.

Common Problems 
and Their Cures
In This Chapter
▶ Perfecting portraits of people
▶ Hushing the noise in your images
▶ Editing your digital landscape
S
ometimes you take perfect photos of imperfect people, and sometimes 
you take imperfect photos of, well, imperfect people. (Even the top 
models benefit from a little Photoshopping.) Although capturing absolute 
reality is the goal of some artists and most photojournalists, the people 
in your photos probably prefer to look as good as you (and 
Photoshop) can make them look.
In this chapter, I present you with some basic tech-
niques for curing many of the most common prob-
lems that you encounter as a photographer. I show 
you how to remove that spooky red-eye effect that 
appears when your camera’s flash reflects off the 
blood vessels in the back of a subject’s eyes. I also 
show you tricks for removing wrinkles, whitening 
teeth, and tightening waistlines. Digital noise (those 
distracting red, green, and blue pixels scattered in 
your image’s shadows) is easy to minimize when you 
use the tricks here. At the end of the chapter, I cover 
how to remove some larger problems from images 
and introduce you to the new Content-Aware features 
in Photoshop. Throughout this chapter, I use real-world 
examples — the types of photos with which you’re most likely to 
work. (After all, you probably don’t get to shoot beautiful models all 
the time.)

184
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Making People Prettier
You can do lots of things in Photoshop to improve your images, but few are 
appreciated as much as fixing a person’s photographed flaws (the appear-
ance kind, not their bad habits). Whether it’s a studio portrait or a snapshot, 
the people in your images generally can benefit from a little touching up.
 
Although you can theoretically make almost anyone look truly beautiful and 
glamorous using Photoshop, remember to balance improving with reality. 
Always work on a copy of your image. I also recommend saving separate 
copies at different stages during the editing process. The client might say 
that he wants the braces removed from his teeth, but after you present the 
finished product, he might just (gasp!) change his mind.
Getting the red out . . . digitally
When a subject looks directly into the camera and the camera-mounted flash 
fires, the result is often red-eye. This result is caused when light (such as a 
flash) bounces off the blood vessels 
at the back of an eye, and it gives 
the subject a spooky vampire look. 
Among the many ways to minimize 
this problem is with the Red Eye 
tool. Zoom in and click once with 
the tool to watch the red disappear, 
leaving the natural highlights and a 
perfect eye. As you see in Figure 9-1, 
the default settings are good for typi-
cal cases of red-eye.
The Red Eye tool finds red and not 
green. For green-eye (in photos of 
animals), for too-bright white reflec-
tions from eyes, and for those times 
when you’re not happy with the 
performance of the Red Eye tool, use 
the Brush tool (as you see in Figure 
9-2). Set the foreground color to 
black; in the Options bar, select the 
Luminosity blending mode and an 
Opacity of about 50%. Use a brush 
diameter just slightly larger than the 
pupil and a brush hardness of about 75%. Click once and evaluate the result; 
if necessary, reduce the Opacity to 20% and click again.
Figure 9-1: Click with the Red Eye tool to 
replace red with natural-looking black.
Figure 9-2: When the Red Eye tool won’t work, 
use the Brush tool.

185
 Chapter 9: Common Problems and Their Cures
 
Here’s one more red-eye/green-eye trick: Use the Sponge tool to desaturate, 
followed by the Burn tool (Midtones, 25% exposure). You’ll find the Sponge 
tool nested in the Toolbox with the Dodge and Burn tools.
The digital fountain of youth
At the end of Chapter 5, I show an example of using the Dodge tool to fade 
wrinkles without removing them completely. Photoshop, being a complex 
and capable animal, has lots of other ways to minimize or eliminate wrinkles. 
Among the most powerful tools for this job are the Healing Brush, the Spot 
Healing Brush (especially with its new Content-Aware option), the Patch tool, 
and the Clone Stamp.
Both the Healing Brush and the Patch tool work by copying texture from one 
area to another. You can, for example, copy smooth skin onto a wrinkled 
area, smoothing the wrinkles while retaining the area’s general tonality 
and color. To work with the Healing Brush, Option+click (Mac)/Alt+click 
(Windows) the area from which you want to copy, and then click and drag 
over the area that you’re fixing. When you select the Aligned option from the 
Options bar, you maintain the relationship between the point from which 
you’re healing and the area over which you drag. No matter where you 
move the cursor, the source point stays the same distance and direction. 
When repairing areas of a face, however, you might find it easier to clear the 
Aligned check box. Every time you release the mouse button, you start over 
from the same source point. By using short strokes, you can heal from the 
same source area to any area of your image.
To work with the Patch tool, make a selection with the Patch tool (or using 
any of Photoshop’s selection techniques) and then drag with the Patch tool. 
Depending on which option you select from the Options bar, you can either 
select and drag the damaged area to a good area (select Source from the 
Options bar), or you can select a good area and drag to the damaged area 
(select Destination). You can use both the Healing Brush and the Patch tool 
to apply a predefined pattern, too. That can be handy for adding a texture 
where one doesn’t already exist in your image.
Like the Healing Brush, you Option+click/Alt+click with the Clone Stamp to 
set the area from which you’re copying and then paint over an area to make a 
change. The Healing Brush copies texture, but the Clone Stamp copies pixels, 
completely replacing the area over which you drag. (That is, of course, sub-
ject to the blending mode and opacity that you select from the Options bar.) 
Like the Healing Brush, the Clone Stamp offers the Aligned option. Figure 
9-3 shows a comparison of wrinkle reduction using the Clone Stamp (set to 
Normal and 100 Opacity) and using the Healing Brush. (If you use the Clone 
Stamp to repair skin, reduce the opacity and make sure to select a source 
area that has similar skin color and lighting.)

whereas the Healing Brush (lower right) melts them away.
Dieting digitally
You can certainly use the Clone Stamp tool to reduce a bit of a bulge at the 
waistline or below an upper arm, but you might find it easier (and more 
natural looking) to make a selection and rotate the outer edge inward a 
bit. Take a look at Figure 9-4. Although this subject hardly has what you’d 
call a “spare tire,” that bit of extra 
sticking out above her skirt isn’t 
particularly flattering. Make a 
selection with the Lasso tool that 
includes some of the background 
and some skin (or shirt or dress). 
Copy the selection to a new layer 
with Ô+J/Ctrl+J. Press Ô+T/Ctrl+T 
to enter Free Transform (or choose 
Edit➪Transform➪Rotate). Drag the 
point of rotation (the little crosshair 
Figure 9-4: Rotate a selection to pinch in a 
waist.

187
 Chapter 9: Common Problems and Their Cures
symbol in the middle of the bounding box) to the top of the bounding box, 
and then position the cursor slightly outside the bounding box and drag to 
rotate. When you’re satisfied, press Return/Enter to accept the transforma-
tion and merge the layers with Ô+E/Ctrl+E. (With complex backgrounds, you 
might need to do a little cloning to even things out.)
When working with double chins, your 
best bet is usually to minimize rather 
than eliminate. Putting a skinny neck 
under a fleshy face looks unnatural. You 
can certainly tuck in the sides of the 
second chin a bit by using the rotate 
method, but rely on the Burn tool to 
darken. By darkening the excess flesh 
under the chin, you make it appear to 
be in shadow — and, therefore, under 
the actual chin (see Figure 9-5). Use the Dodge tool or the Clone Stamp (if 
necessary) to hide any creases or wrinkles associated with the excess chin. 
Redefine a natural-looking jaw line and chin — but once again, remember that 
the result must not only be acceptable to the client, it must also look natural.
 
When working with the Burn and Dodge tools, don’t forget to reduce the 
Exposure setting in the Options bar — 15% to 20% is plenty strong for this 
type of work. You’ll also want to juggle between Highlights and Midtones 
(the Range setting in the Options bar) when creating an artificial shadow on 
a double chin with the Burn tool. Zoom in when doing this sort of work, but 
also open a second window via Window➪Arrange➪New Window for [file-
name] to keep an eye on the overall impact of your changes.
You can use the Filter➪Liquify feature to push, pull, twist, pucker, bloat, and 
otherwise manipulate pixels into the shape and position you need. There’s 
really nothing more powerful when it comes to reconfiguring a figure. In 
Figure 9-6, you see how leveling off a beltline in Liquify is sometimes all that’s 
needed to restore that trim-man-she-married look. And a little touch-up with 
the Healing Brush or Dodge and Burn tools can eliminate the wrinkles in the 
shirt, helping improve the overall appearance of the image by reducing dis-
traction. (Chapter 15 has full info on using Liquify.)
De-glaring glasses
Although hindsight is usually 20/20, many people need spectacles. 
Unfortunately, those eyeglasses can be a photographer’s nightmare! The 
reflections off glass are usually specular highlights — that is, areas of pure 
white with absolutely no detail in them. To properly evaluate flash reflections 
in eyeglasses, open the Info panel and move the cursor through the area. If 
you see a noticeable variation among the RGB values in the Info panel, you 
might be able to restore the area with the Burn tool.
Figure 9-5: Burning and dodging can 
reduce even a very prominent double chin.

188
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 9-6: Use Liquify to make major adjustments to figures.
If the Info panel shows RGB values of 255/255/255 or close to it, the area has 
no detail. Zoom in close and use the Clone Stamp tool to copy over the area 
from another part of the image. In severe cases of glare, you might need to 
copy from another photo of the same person. When possible (say, in a 
portrait sitting), try to take one shot of the subject without eyeglasses, 
just in case.
Whitening teeth
Teeth generally aren’t truly white 
(unless somebody has spent a lot 
of time and money getting ready for 
a portfolio shoot). Instead, you see 
shades of ivory and yellow in teeth, 
but they don’t necessarily have to 
be unattractive or distracting shades of yellow. The Sponge tool is great for 
desaturating teeth, moving them from yellow to gray. Use the Dodge tool to 
lighten teeth. From the Options bar, set the tool to Midtones (not Highlights) 
and an Exposure of perhaps 30% for front teeth. Paint over each tooth indi-
vidually, making sure that you don’t eliminate the shadows that differentiate 
the individual teeth. Then switch to Shadows and lighten those molars visible

tool digital correction; show-biz-white teeth.

189
 Chapter 9: Common Problems and Their Cures
in back. Don’t overdo it — remember that folks who don’t make their living in 
Hollywood or on TV generally don’t have snow-white teeth. Figure 9-7 shows 
normal people teeth, “improved” normal people teeth, and Hollywood teeth. 
Balance your judgment with the client’s needs.
Reducing Noise in Your Images
The move from the darkroom to digital saved you thousands of dollars in 
film and processing costs (not to mention a reduction in environmental deg-
radation) but has added a new set of challenges to the art and business of 
photography. Perhaps foremost among the problems presented by digital 
photography is noise. Those pesky red, green, and blue (or light and dark) 
specks in an image can ruin a digital photo. Noise is generally most promi-
nent in shadow areas and against dark colors in your images.
The higher the ISO setting on your camera, the more digital noise it will 
record. Use the lowest ISO setting that’s suitable for the environment in 
which you’re shooting. When you must use a high ISO (low light, moving 
subject), be prepared for digital noise. Using a tripod can also help keep the 
problem to a minimum.
Decreasing digital noise
If you shoot Raw, reduce noise in Camera Raw, as described in Chapter 7. If 
you shoot JPEG, use the Reduce Noise filter (under the Filter➪Noise menu). 
As you see in Figure 9-8, it does a very good job of neutralizing the random 
red, green, and blue pixels while preserving detail in the image.
Figure 9-8: The Reduce Noise filter keeps your image sharp 
while eliminating RGB noise.

190
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Notice that Reduce Noise also offers a Remove JPEG Artifact option. When 
saving in the JPEG file format, you compromise between image quality and 
smaller file size. The smaller the file, the greater the likelihood of compres-
sion damage to your image. That damage generally shows itself as visible 
lines between blocks of pixels measuring eight pixels square.
 
You’ll also find the Color Replacement tool very handy for noise reduction, 
especially in areas of rather uniform color. Option+click/Alt+click right in the 
area to set the foreground color; then simply paint away the digital noise. As 
you move from area to area in your image, Option+click/Alt+click to pick up a 
new foreground color.
Eliminating luminance noise
In addition to the red, green, and 
blue specks of digital noise, you 
might face luminance noise, which is 
the bright and dark specks sprinkled 
throughout your photo. Under the 
Filter➪Noise menu, you can find the 
Despeckle command. No dialog box 
appears and you have no options 
to choose from: You simply run the 
filter two or three times. For more 
challenging noise, try Photoshop’s 
Blur➪Smart Blur filter. For supreme 
control over blurring, Smart Blur 
even lets you enter fractions for both 
the Radius and Threshold values (as shown in Figure 9-9). Sometimes the dif-
ference between a 1.5-pixel blur and a 2-pixel blur is the salvation of the fine 
detail in your image.
Fooling Around with Mother Nature
Sometimes a very nice photo has something in it that you want gone . . . a 
piece of litter, telephone lines in the distance, or perhaps a building that 
distracts from the composition. Other times, everything in the image is fine, 
but the image looks wrong because of the angle at which it was taken, or you 
want to change the angle of something in the photo. Photoshop offers you 
quite a variety of tools and techniques for cutting out, copying over, cleaning 
up, and even correcting perspective.
Removing the unwanted from photos
Perhaps the easiest way to remove something from an image is to crop the 
photo: that is, cut off that part of the picture. This technique is easy enough 
Figure 9-9: The Smart Blur filter is a good 
choice for luminance noise reduction.

191
 Chapter 9: Common Problems and Their Cures
if that piece of litter or whatever happens to be at the edge of the image and 
cropping won’t ruin your composition. (Of course, picking up that piece of 
litter and disposing of it prior to taking the photo is the best solution.) When 
you must cover up rather than crop out, consider both cloning and copy/
paste.
One of the keys to using the Clone Stamp tool is keeping an eye on your work. 
Zoom in close so you can work precisely, but choose Window➪Arrange➪New 
Window for [filename]. Keep that second window zoomed out and off to the 
side so you can monitor your progress while you work. I also like to keep a 
copy of the original image open for reference. You can make a copy of the 
file with the Image➪Duplicate command or by clicking the left button at the 
bottom of the History panel. In Figure 9-10, you see the original image to 
the upper-left, the zoomed-in work image below, and a zoomed-out second 
window for the work image. (The Navigator panel shows you what part of the 
zoomed-in image is visible.) The unwanted bicycle is easily removed.
Here are some tips for working effectively with the Clone Stamp tool:
 
✓ Work on a separate layer. Before cloning, click the New Layer button 
at the bottom of the Layers panel and set the Sample menu to All Layers 
in the Options bar. By cloning to the new layer, you protect yourself 
from irreversible errors (you can always erase part of the upper layer), 
and you can show/hide your work layer to check progress. If the image 
already has multiple layers and you want to clone from only one, hide 
the other layers in the Layers panel by clicking the eyeball icons in the 
left column.
 
✓ If color or pattern is uniform, clone near. If, for example, you’re remov-
ing a power line in a beautiful blue sky, clone from right above and 
below the power line so that you get the best possible color match. For 
delicate jobs or larger items, you can clone by halves — clone half from 
one side and the other half from the other side.
 
✓ To avoid a recognizable pattern, clone far. In Figure 9-10, I cloned over 
the bicycle handles in the lower-right corner of the image from a variety 
of places to avoid creating any recognizable replicas of nearby flowers 
or rocks. You should, however, try to clone from areas that are approxi-
mately the same distance from the lens as the area over which you’re 
cloning. If you clone from the far distance into the foreground, you’ll 
have a recognizable size mismatch and perhaps a focal difference, as 
well.
 
✓ To copy areas or objects, use Aligned. In Figure 9-10, I copied patches 
of wildflowers, grass, and rock. By using the Aligned option, the relation-
ship between the point from which I sampled and the point to which I 
cloned remained constant when I released the mouse button. To pick a 
new source point, I Option+clicked/Alt+clicked elsewhere in the image.

192
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 9-10: Use the Clone Stamp to remove unwanted bits and pieces.
 
✓ To repeat a pattern or texture, don’t use Aligned. If you have a specific 
object, texture, or pattern that you want to replicate in more than one 
area, you can clear the Aligned check box on the Options bar. Every 
time you release the mouse button, the source point returns to the exact 
spot where you Option+clicked/Alt+clicked. You can copy the same part 
of the image into as many different places as you choose.
 
✓ You can vary the tool’s opacity and blending mode. Generally speak-
ing, when you want to hide something in the image, use the Normal 
blending mode and 100% opacity. However, you can also clone with 
other blending modes and reduce opacity to subdue rather than hide 
and, of course, for fun special effects.
 
✓ Adjust your brush size on the fly. Pressing the left and right brackets 
keys (to the right of P on the standard English keyboard) decreases and 
increases the brush diameter without having to open the Brushes panel.
 
✓ Check the brush’s hardness and spacing settings. To get the smoothest 
result for general cloning, reduce the brush’s Hardness setting to about 
25%, allowing edges to blend. There are times, however, when you’ll 

193
 Chapter 9: Common Problems and Their Cures
need a more distinct edge to the brush, but you’ll rarely need to clone 
with a brush set harder than perhaps 90%. In the full-size Brushes panel, 
I generally set the Spacing (in Brush Tip Shape) to 1% for cloning to 
ensure the edge is as smooth as possible.
 
The Spot Healing Brush works much like the Healing Brush to repair and replace 
texture. However, instead of designating a source point by Option+clicking/
Alt+clicking, the Spot Healing Brush samples from the immediate surround-
ing area, which makes it perfect for repairing little irregularities in an area of 
rather consistent texture. The new Content-Aware option for the Spot Healing 
Brush makes it a “smart” tool — it looks at the surrounding area and tries to 
replicate both the texture and the content. The Spot Healing Brush could, for 
example, do a fine job with individual flowers and small rocks shown earlier 
in Figure 9-10, but even with the Content-Aware option it’s not quite up to the 
task of hiding a bicycle or a steer. (The results would be noticeably softer 
and show irregular splotches.)
You can also move something in your image to a new location to create a 
new look in the shot. As shown in Figure 9-11, copy the entire image, repo-
sition it, use a layer mask to hide parts of the upper layer, and clone to 
remove anything not needed on the exposed areas of the lower layer. In 
Figure 9-11, the background layer is copied and moved upward (after using 
the Image➪Canvas Size command to expand the canvas), and a layer mask 
hides everything except the boy, his racket, and the ball. On the lower layer, 
the boy is cloned out. (The look of surprise from the boy in the red hat in the 
background is simply a fortuitous coincidence that seems to add credibility 
to the adjusted image.)
 
New in Photoshop is the Edit➪Puppet Warp feature. Like Liquify (presented 
in Chapter 15), Puppet Warp enables you to very easily produce complex dis-
tortions on an image. Here’s the workflow I recommend for most jobs using 
Puppet Warp:
 
1. Make a selection of the area of the image you want to alter.
 
 You can use whatever selection technique works best for the part of the 
image that needs to be selected — Lasso tool, Color Range command, or 
any of the selection tools and techniques described in Chapter 8.
 
2. Copy to a new layer.
 
 Use the keyboard shortcut Ô+J/Ctrl+J to put the selected pixels on their 
own layer.
 
3. Remove the selected pixels from the lower layer.
 
 Hide the upper layer by clicking the eyeball icon to the left of the layer 
name in the Layers panel. Click on the lower layer in the panel to make 
it the active layer. Clone or copy/paste over the selected pixels using 
the techniques in the preceding section. (This stage of the workflow is 
shown to the upper-right, next to the original shot, in Figure 9-12.)

194
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
Figure 9-11: One small step for Photoshop, one giant leap for mankind!
 
4. Make the upper layer visible and active.
 
 Click in the eyeball column to the left of the upper layer’s name to make 
the layer visible, and then click on the layer name or thumbnail to make 
the layer active.
 
5. Activate the Puppet Warp feature.
 
 Select Puppet Warp from the Edit menu.
 
6. Set pins.
 
 Click in two or more places along the axis that you want to change to set 
anchor points known as pins. If you’re manipulating an arm, you would 
generally place pins at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. When manipulat-
ing a leg, place pins at the hip, knee, and ankle.
 
7. Select your options.
 
 In the Options bar, choose a mode. Normal is usually appropriate, 
Distort enables you to change perspective while dragging pins, and Rigid 
helps maintain special relationships. You can also change the density of 
the now-visible mesh and use the Expansion slider and field to expand 
or contract the content within the mesh.
 
8. Drag the pins and accept the warp.
 
 Click on a pin to make it the active pin; drag as desired. You can switch 
among pins as often as necessary, and you can remove a pin by clicking 
on it and pressing Delete/Backspace. When you’re happy with the new 
look of your “puppet,” press the Return/Enter key.

Eliminating the lean: Fixing perspective
When you take a photograph at an angle, perhaps shooting upward at a build-
ing, you get foreshortening, with the upper part of the subject shrinking into 
the distance. Photoshop’s Filter➪Lens Correction does a great job of fixing 
perspective.
 
In Photoshop CS5, Lens Correction not only gets a new spot in the Filter 
menu (it used to be in the Distort submenu), but it also gets a whole new 
capability with the Auto Correction panel! If you shoot a recent model high-
end DSLR, you can use custom profiles created for your camera/lens combi-
nation. Use these automatic corrections when the perspective is great and 
you just need to compensate for the tendencies of the lens itself. You can 
even search online at Adobe Labs for profiles created and posted by other 
photographers. (If you have the technical inclination and time, you can even 
create your own custom profiles and post those online for others shooting 
your same camera and lens.)

196
Part II: Easy Enhancements for Digital Images 
In the Custom panel of Lens Correction, drag the Vertical Perspective slider 
to the left to correct images shot from below, or to the right for shots from 
above. In Lens Correction, as shown in Figure 9-13, you can also adjust hori-
zontal perspective, barrel distortion (when the center of the image bulges 
out), pin cushioning (when the center of the image bulges in), chromatic 
aberration (blue/yellow or red/cyan fringing along edges), and add a vignette.
 
Before entering Lens Correction, double-click the layer name Background in 
the Layers panel and rename the layer. Use Image➪Canvas Size to add some 
empty area at the top (or bottom) of the image. That way, you won’t chop 
off the top (or bottom) of the photo when dragging the Vertical Perspective 
slider to the left (or right). Notice in Figure 9-13 that a generous amount of 
extra canvas was added, which can easily be cropped off after correcting 
perspective.
You can also use Photoshop’s Edit➪Transform➪Perspective command, but 
that usually produces some foreshortening of the image, requiring you to 
scale it upward a bit afterward. The Crop tool can also fix perspective. Mark 
the Perspective check box on the Options bar before dragging a bounding 
box. For best results, position the four corners of the bounding box on visible 
corners of something in the image that should be rectangular or square; drag 
the side handles outward to expand the bounding box to encompass your 
image. Press Return/Enter when you’re done. 
Figure 9-13: Lens Correction does a fine job of correcting perspective.
Rotating images precisely
Buried under the Eyedropper in the Photoshop Toolbox is the little-known 
Ruler tool. Generally, you use it in conjunction with the Info panel or Options 

197
 Chapter 9: Common Problems and Their Cures
Bar to find distances and angles in your image. You can also use it to make 
sure that you apply the exact amount of rotation needed for your image. 
Select the Ruler tool, drag it along any line in your image that should be ver-
tical or horizontal and then choose Image➪Image Rotation➪Arbitrary. The 
angle of the Ruler tool will already be waiting for you in the dialog box, so 
you need only click OK to precisely rotate your image.
 
One final thought for this chapter: When you come across an image that 
requires more fixing than you have time for, or one with such severe lumi-
nance noise that smoothing removes too much detail, or just a problem 
photo in general, head for the Filter Gallery. It’s amazing how many flaws 
you can hide with a few artistic effects. Creating an artistic rendering of an 
image is often preferable to deleting a lousy photo. Blur away the noise and 
add a canvas texture with the Texturizer filter. Blown out highlights? Try 
the Colored Pencil filter. (Read more about the Filter Gallery in Chapter 15.) 
When faced with lemons, think of the Filter Gallery as your own personal 
lemonade stand.

Part III
Creating “Art” in 
Photoshop

In this part . . .
P
 hotoshop is far more than just a pixel-
 pushing image editor. More than merely per-
fecting excellent photography, you can create art 
in Photoshop. And Photoshop includes a very 
powerful painting engine. You need to understand 
the extremely complex Brush palette and painting 
tools, all covered here.
Chapter 10 introduces you to compositing (com-
bining images into a piece of artwork) and work-
ing with layers. You also see how to use color 
channels as the basis for selections, enabling you 
to move elements from one image to another. 
Chapter 11 introduces you to Photoshop’s shape 
layers and vector paths, which are illustration tools 
used to add speciﬁ c elements.
In Chapter 12, I show you how to work with the 
Styles palette and how to create your own custom 
styles — and make sure you don’t lose them by 
mistake! Chapter 13 looks at the many tools, pal-
ettes, and commands you have available in 
Photoshop to add text and type. Chapter 14 intro-
duces you to painting in Photoshop. Chapter 15 
introduces you to those ﬁ lters you need on a near-
daily basis, and then shows you how to work in 
the Filter Gallery and in Liquify.

 pharaoh’s head on a lion body. A lion with the head, talons, and wings 
of an eagle. As evidenced by the sphinx and the mythological griffin, 
compositing elements has been around a lot longer than Photoshop, but 
Photoshop certainly makes it easier! Take part of one image, drop it onto 
another image, and sell the composite to the tabloids for thousands 
of dollars. (One of the more infamous misuses of Photoshop 
occurred during the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign, 
with the publication of a fake photo of candidate John 
Kerry with actress and antiwar activist Jane Fonda.) 
Photoshop offers you incredible power — use it 
wisely!
In this chapter, I show you some basic techniques 
for compositing (combining two or more images 
into a single picture), how to use channels to select 
part of an image for compositing, the Vanishing 
Point feature, and then wrap up the chapter with 
a look at combining images automatically to create 
panoramas.

202
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Compositing Images: 1 + 1 = 1
You make a selection in one image, copy, switch to another image, and paste. 
There you have it — the basic composite! Pretty simple, isn’t it? Whether 
you’re putting together two images or creating complex artwork involving 
dozens of elements, the trick is making the composited image look natural. 
The key techniques are blending the edges of your selections and matching 
color among the elements.
Understanding layers
When you put together images, you work with layers. Think of layers in 
Photoshop as stackable elements, each of which holds part of your image. 
Where an upper layer is transparent, the lower layers show through. Where 
the upper layer has pixels that aren’t transparent, those pixels either block 
or interact with pixels on the lower layer. (You control that interaction with 
blending modes and opacity, explained later in this chapter.)
Take a look at Figure 10-1 (which reveals how Figure 13-2 is created). The 
Layers panel shows the individual layers and their content. The individual 
elements come together to create a single image.
You can manipulate the content of each layer independently — moving, 
resizing, erasing, painting, or adjusting color and tonality — to suit your 
needs and artistic vision. Remember to click a layer in the Layers panel to 
make that layer active for editing. You can link two or more layers so that 
they maintain their positions relative to each other as you move them. (Ô/
Ctrl+click to select the layers; then click the Link button at the bottom of 
the Layers panel — a Link symbol appears to the right of linked layers when 
active in the layers panel.) Linked layers can be moved together without 
knocking them out of alignment.
 
The left column in the Layers panel, known as the eyeball column (for an 
obvious reason) allows you to hide a layer, making the content of the layer 
invisible. The pixels are still there; they’re just not visible. Click the eyeball 
icon to hide the layer and then click the empty space in the left column to 
make the layer visible again. You can hide and show adjustment layers, too, 
which lets you see their impact on the image. (Read about adjustment layers 
in Chapter 8.)
One key concept about layers is well illustrated in Figure 10-1. The higher 
a layer is in the stacking order (the order of layers in the panel from the top 
down), the more “in front” it will be. The layers Clouds-Dark and Clouds-Light 
are on top of everything in the image. The layer Man is in front of everything 
except the clouds. Because of the stacking order, the man appears to be 
standing on top of the musical notes, and the notes appear to be on top of 
the compact disc.

203
 Chapter 10: Combining Images
 
Figure 10-1: Elements on different layers form a single image.
You can also create groups, which are two or more layers packaged together 
in the Layers panel so that you can work with them together. As you can see 
in the Layers panel in Figure 10-1, you can have nested groups: a group within 
a group. (In Photoshop CS5, the number of nested groups is increased from 
5 to 10.) The group named Background Items includes another group, named 
Sun, as well as several layers that aren’t part of the Sun subgroup.
Seldom used — actually, seldom even noticed — are the layer-related com-
mands in the Select menu. The Select➪All Layers and Deselect Layers com-
mands are pretty obvious, but the Select➪Similar command deserves a little 
attention. With a layer active in the Layers panel, this command selects all 
layers of the same category. All type layers, shape layers, and adjustment 
layers can be selected quickly with this command. When would you use 
it? You might, for example, use it to apply a stylesheet to a number of type 
layers using the Character Style or Paragraph Style panel.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Why you should use Smart Objects
Smart Objects provide you with even more flexibility in Photoshop. When 
working with Smart Objects, you preserve your editing options without risk 
to the image quality. For example, you can transform a Smart Object as often 
as you like because each time you rotate or scale or otherwise manipulate 
a Smart Object, Photoshop goes back to the original pixels and resamples 
again. This prevents the sort of image degradation you would see if you were 
to shrink and enlarge a regular layer’s content numerous times.
When working with Smart Objects, you can apply a filter to a selection in 
Photoshop and then later go back and change the filter settings or even 
remove the filter entirely. But this feature is available only when you’re work-
ing with Smart Objects. Again, it goes back to Photoshop’s ability to return to 
the original source pixels when working with Smart Objects. (Filters are dis-
cussed in Chapter 15.) In the Layers panel, Smart Filters very much resemble 
layer styles: You can click an eyeball icon to temporarily hide a filter’s effect, 
and you can double-click the filter name to re-open the dialog box so that you 
can make changes (see Figure 10-2).
Figure 10-2: Filters applied to the Smart Object are listed under Smart Filters.

205
 Chapter 10: Combining Images
You can make a selection of part of a Smart Object before applying a filter, 
which creates a mask that restricts the filter to certain areas of the Smart 
Object (visible in Figure 10-2 as a mask thumbnail to the left of the words 
“Smart Filter.”) Note, too, that a Smart Object can have both Smart Filters and 
a layer style.
When you choose File➪Place, a Smart Object is automatically created. To 
create a Smart Object from an existing layer (even a background layer), 
choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Convert to Smart Object.
Using the basic blending modes
The pop-up menu at the top-left corner of the Layers panel offers more than 
two dozen different blending modes. A layer’s blending mode determines how 
the pixels on that layer interact with the visible pixels on the layers below.
 
Because a layer named Background can’t have any layers below it, you can’t 
change the blending mode of background layers. Convert a background layer 
to a regular layer by changing the layer’s name in the Layers panel. Simply 
double-click a layer name in the Layers panel and type to rename the layer.
In Figure 10-3, the black-white and rainbow strips of gradients overlaid on the 
garden photo below each use the blending mode shown by the text outline. 
(You can see the original gradients in the Normal stripe.) Normal, Multiply, 
Screen, Overlay, and Luminosity are the blending modes you’re most likely to 
use regularly.
 
When working with layer blending modes, always keep in mind that you can 
use the Layers panel’s Opacity and Fill sliders to help determine the layer’s vis-
ibility and appearance. The Opacity slider controls the visibility of the layer’s 
content and any layer style applied to the layer. The Fill slider controls the 
visibility of the layer content without hiding any layer style. For a practical 
example of the difference between the two sliders, take a look at Chapter 18.
The Layers panel blending mode pop-up menu is divided into six sections, 
based loosely on how the pixels on the upper layer affect the pixels on the 
lower layer. Here’s a quick look at how you use the key layer blending modes:
 
✓ Normal: Photoshop picks Normal by default. Pixels on the upper layer 
completely hide the pixels on the lower layers (subject, of course, to 
the Opacity and the Fill settings). Use Normal to show the content of the 
layer without any interaction with lower layers.
 
✓ Multiply: The Multiply blending mode darkens where your upper layer 
is dark and ignores white. Use Multiply when you want the upper layer 
to darken but not obscure the lower layer and also for shadows and 
dark glow effects.

206
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 10-3: Blending modes control the interaction between the gradients and the photo.
 
✓ Screen: The Screen blending mode — the opposite of Multiply — uses 
lighter pixels to lighten the pixels below. Use it for highlights and light-
colored glows.
 
✓ Overlay: Overlay works like a combination of Multiply and Screen. Use 
it when you’re working with an upper layer that includes both dark and 
light pixels that you want to interact with pixels on layers below.
 
✓ Soft Light: Soft Light is a subtle blending mode. Like Overlay, where 
your upper layer’s pixels are dark, the lower layer is darkened; where 
they’re light, the lower layer is lightened. Soft Light is like adding a dif-
fused spotlight to the lower layer — useful for adding a little drama to 
the lower layer.
 
✓ Hard Light: The Hard Light blending mode is much like a more vivid ver-
sion of Soft Light. Use it to add a lot more drama to the lower layer. Hard 
Light works well with colors that aren’t overwhelmingly bright.
 
✓ Difference: Where the upper layer (using the Difference blending mode) 
and the lower layer are exactly the same, you see black. Where the 
two layers are different, you see brightness or color. For example, use 
Difference (temporarily) when trying to align two overlapping photos. 
Set the upper layer to Difference, move the upper layer until the areas 
of overlap show black, and then switch the upper layer’s blending mode 
back to Normal.

207
 Chapter 10: Combining Images
 
✓ Color: When the upper layer 
is set to Color, the lower 
layer’s brightness and satu-
ration are retained, and the 
upper layer’s color is used. 
If you want to create a color 
picture from a grayscale pic-
ture, convert the image to RGB 
(Image➪Mode➪RGB), add a 
new layer, change the upper 
layer’s blending mode to Color, 
and paint on the upper layer 
(as shown in Figure 10-4).
 
✓ Luminosity: When the upper layer is set to Luminosity, the color and 
saturation of the lower layer are retained, and the brightness (luminos-
ity) of the upper layer is applied. Because the luminosity (dark and light) 
generally provides texture, use this blending mode to produce detail in 
the lower layer.
Photoshop also offers two pairs of blending modes that you might find useful, 
but confusing. The Lighten and Lighter Color blending modes both compare 
the pixel on the upper layer to the pixel directly below it on the lower layer 
and choose the lighter color value. The Lighten blending mode looks at each 
color channel. For example, if the upper pixel’s RGB values are 200/180/75 
and the lower pixel’s RGB colors are 175/240/90, the resulting color in your 
image is RGB 175/240/90 (the lighter — higher RGB value — of each of the 
three channels). Using the Lighter Color blending mode for the upper layer, 
on the other hand, would result in the lower layer’s color being used — RGB 
200/240/90 is lighter overall than RGB 200/180/75. While Lighten looks at 
each channel independently, Lighter Color simply uses the overall lightness. 
The Darken and Darker Color blending modes work similarly, but choose the 
darker values.
Opacity, transparency, and layer masks
Blending modes help determine how pixels on an upper layer interact with 
pixels on a lower layer, but those upper pixels have to be visible before they 
can do any interacting at all. When looking at any pixel on a layer, you have 
to consider four factors about transparency:
 
✓ Whether the pixel has any color to start with
 
✓ The Opacity value
 
✓ The Fill value
 
✓ Whether there’s a layer mask
Figure 10-4: Paint on a layer set to Color to 
retain the detail of the layer below.

208
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
When you add a layer and paint on it, for example, 
you color some of the pixels yet leave other pixels 
transparent. (Every layer in every image is com-
pletely filled with pixels, whether visible or not.) If 
nothing is done to color some pixels, they remain 
transparent, and the lower layers can be seen 
through that part of your upper layer. In Figure 
10-5, the words upper layer are on a separate layer 
above the layer containing the words LOWER 
LAYER. Where the upper layer has transparent 
pixels, the lower layer shows through.
 
A layer named Background in the Layers panel can 
have no transparent pixels.
Lowering the Opacity or the Fill slider in the Layers panel (or the Layer Style 
dialog box) makes all visible pixels on the layer partially transparent: The 
pixels on layers below can be seen through the upper layer’s pixels. (The 
Opacity slider controls the pixels on the layer and any layer style; the Fill 
slider works only on the pixels, not the layer style.)
Chapter 8 discusses layer masks and vector masks. Remember that any pixel 
inside the mask is visible, and any pixel outside the mask is transparent, 
regardless of whether it has color. But, as you can guess, any transparent 
pixels inside the mask remain transparent.
Creating clipping groups
This being Photoshop, here is yet another way to restrict the visibility of 
pixels on an upper layer: clipping groups. Clipping an upper layer to the layer 
below, in effect, creates a mask for the upper layer. The opacity of the pixels 
on the lower layer is applied to the pixels on your upper layer. Where the 
lower layer is transparent, the upper layer (regardless of original content) 
becomes transparent. In the Layers panel, Option+click (Mac)/Alt+click 
(Windows) the line between two layers to clip the upper layer to the lower. 
When you hold down the Option/Alt key, the cursor turns into the wedding 
rings icon, shown between the top two layers in Figure 10-6.
After you Option+click/Alt+click the line between Layer 0 and the layer 
named GARDENS, the upper layer is visible only within the text on the lower 
layer. The upper layer is indented to the right in the Layers panel, with a 
downward-pointing arrow, to let you know that it’s clipped to the layer 
below. Note that the upper layer’s thumbnail in the Layers panel shows the 
entire layer, not just the visible area. To unclip a layer, Option+click/Alt+click 
again on the line between the two layers in the Layers panel. Also note in 
Figure 10-6 that the layer style is applied to the lower layer rather than the 
upper layer.
Figure 10-5: Where you see 
the lower layer, the upper 
layer is transparent.

209
 Chapter 10: Combining Images
The wedding rings icon
Figure 10-6: Option+click or Alt+click the line between two layers to clip the upper to the lower.
Photoshop lets you show the layer thumbnails in two ways. Normally, the 
entire layer, including all areas of transparency, shows in the thumbnail. 
Although that gives you a good indication of how large or small the particular 
layer’s content is in the image, layers with little content have little to show in 
the thumbnail. By using the Panel Options (from the Layers panel menu) or 
Control+clicking/right-clicking the empty area below the layers in the panel, 
you can elect to show a thumbnail that includes only nontransparent areas of 
the layer. Little things fill the thumbnail, but they also appear out of propor-
tion to the other thumbnails. Your choice.
Making composited elements look natural
One of the keys to compositing two images is a slight fade to the edges of 
the element you’re adding to the original image. That fade, called feathering, 
makes the edges of the image appear to fall off into the distance very slightly 
rather than having a sharply defined edge that sticks out like a sore thumb. 
(See Chapter 8 for full information on feathering.) You have a number of ways 
to feather a selection, including the following:

210
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Use the Feathering field on the Options bar 
before you use a selection tool.
 
✓ Use the Refine Edge button in the Options 
bar or the Select➪Refine Edge command after 
making your selection.
 
✓ Choose Select➪Modify➪Feather after you 
make a selection.
 
✓ Apply a slight blur to a saved selection’s alpha 
channel in the Layers panel (or to a layer 
mask).
Matching color between two layers is also 
critical for a natural appearance. Take a look at 
Chapter 6 for full information on Match Color and 
Photoshop’s other color adjustment capabilities.
You also need to be aware of perspective and scale. 
When an element in your composited image seems 
to be too large or too small or when it seems to 
be facing the wrong way or standing on air, rely 
on the Edit➪Transform commands. Although the 
Scale and Rotate commands are self-explanatory, 
Figure 10-7 shows visually how you can use 
the other Transform commands, such as Skew, 
Perspective, and Warp. Drag the bounding box 
anchor points to transform the selected pixels.
The Edit➪Transform➪Warp com-
mand adds a simple mesh over the 
content of the layer or selection. 
You click and drag the direction 
lines for the corners of the mesh 
and at the intersection of mesh lines 
to distort your artwork. As you see 
in Figure 10-8, the Warp distortion 
gives you a level of control second 
only to Photoshop’s Liquify feature 
(discussed in Chapter 15). You can 
also use Warp with paths and shape 
layers.
Figure 10-7: Drag anchor 
points to transform.
Figure 10-8: Use the Warp transformation to 
distort layers or selections.

211
 Chapter 10: Combining Images
Making Complex Selections
In order to combine elements from separate images into a single piece of 
artwork, you sometimes need to make very complex selections. That’s often 
best done with an alpha channel, which can then be made into an active 
selection with the aptly-named Select➪Load Selection command. Among the 
alpha channel creation techniques available to you are
 
✓ Save a selection: If you already have a selection, perhaps created with 
the Lasso tool or the Select➪Color Range command, you can use the 
Select➪Save Selection command to create an alpha channel. This saved 
selection can then be edited as necessary by painting, or can be com-
bined with another selection or additional alpha channels.
 
✓ Duplicate a quick mask: Press Q to enter Quick Mask mode, paint your 
quick mask (as described in Chapter 8), and then — before exiting Quick 
Mask mode — drag the Quick Mask channel to the New Channel button 
at the bottom of the Channels panel to duplicate it.
 
✓ Paint from scratch: Click the New Channel button at the bottom of the 
Channels panel, and paint with black, white, and shades of gray. White 
will be included in the selection, black will be excluded from the selec-
tion, and gray indicates partial selection.
 
✓ Duplicate an existing channel as the basis for a mask: You can also 
examine the color channels to see which provides the best contrast 
between the subject and the background, drag that channel to the New 
Channel button, and then adjust the duplicate channel.
Duplicating a color channel is often the most effective way to extract a com-
plex subject from a complex background. Here’s one way to approach the 
task:
 
1. Examine each channel individually to see which offers the most con-
trast between subject and background.
 
 Open the Channels panel and click on each color channel, one at a time, 
to see which presents the best contrast between the edges of the sub-
ject and the surrounding background.
 
 Don’t forget that you have 10 color channels — that’s right, 10 channels — 
from which to choose! In addition to the Red, Green, and Blue channels 
in your image, you can use the Image➪Duplicate command and then 
convert the copy to CMYK or Lab mode. One of the CMYK channels 
often offers much better contrast between subject and background than 
do the RGB channels. In Lab mode, the a and b channels are also worth 
a try. And after creating your alpha channel, you don’t even need to 
switch back to RGB mode.

212
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
2. Duplicate the selected channel.
 
 Drag the color channel of your choice to the New Channel button at the 
bottom of the Channels panel to create an alpha channel from it.
 
3. Maximize the contrast between subject and background.
 
 Ideally, you’ll end up with a subject that’s completely white and a back-
ground that’s completely black. (If your alpha channel shows a dark 
subject and a light background, simply use Ô+I/Ctrl+I or the command 
Image➪Adjustments➪Invert.) Generally speaking, the first place to start 
maximizing the contrast is Levels. Drag the end sliders way in under the 
middle of the histogram, and then adjust the middle slider. After clicking 
OK, you may want to use Levels again. After Levels has done most of the 
work, grab the Brush tool and clean up any additional areas, painting 
directly in the channel with black and white.
 
As you adjust your duplicated channel, pay attention to the edge between the 
subject and background. Don’t worry about areas away from the edge — those 
are easy to clean up with the Brush. It’s that narrow band that separates the 
subject and background that’s critical.
Figure 10-9 illustrates the steps. To the left, the Red channel shows decent 
contrast between the subject and background, the Green less so, and the 
Blue channel is useless for this particular image (too much yellow in the 
background). After you create a duplicate and convert to CMYK mode, it’s 
apparent that both the Cyan and Black channels are even better starting 
points than the Red channel. After duplicating the Black channel and using 
Levels twice, the alpha channel is in pretty good shape (top center). After a 
few swipes with the Brush using black and then again using white, the alpha 
channel is ready (top right). Switch back to the RGB copy, use Select➪Load 
Selection and load the Black copy channel, and there’s a perfect selection of 
the flower!
 
When working with Raw images, you have another option available. After 
making the subject look great in Camera Raw, click Open Image to open 
the image into Photoshop, and then save it as .psd or a .tif file. Reopen the 
original Raw image back into Camera Raw. This time, maximize the differ-
ences between the subject and background — without regard for how ugly 
the image becomes — in the Basic and HSL/Grayscale panels. Hold down the 
Option/Alt key and click the now-visible Open Copy button (which opens the 
new copy without overwriting your earlier Camera Raw adjustments). Select 
a color channel, duplicate the channel, and create your alpha channel as 
described in the preceding section.

213
 Chapter 10: Combining Images
Figure 10-9: Duplicating a color channel is often the fastest way to a great alpha channel.
Vanishing Point
When combining images to create a scene, you might find a need to add tex-
ture or a pattern along what is supposed to be a three-dimensional object. 
You might, for example, add a product box to a photo of a kitchen and need 
to add a logo to the front of the box. Or maybe you will create a room, per-
haps in a castle high on a hill, and you’ll need to add a realistic stone texture 
to the walls. Use the Vanishing Point feature to “map” a pattern to angled sur-
faces, such as walls, floors, buildings, and boxes. Vanishing Point, using infor-
mation that you provide, automatically determines the correct angle, scale, 
and perspective. (Vanishing Point is rather complex, so for simple jobs, you 
might want to stick with the Paste and Edit➪Transform commands.)
To use Vanishing Point, you follow a specific sequence of steps:
 
1. Copy your pattern.
 
 Open whatever pattern file (or texture or color or logo or whatever) 
you’re going to add to the walls or sides in your image, make a selection, 
and then choose Edit➪Copy. You can now close the pattern file.

214
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
2. Make a selection in your working image.
 
 Identify where you want the pattern to be applied. If you’re working with 
walls, for example, make a selection that includes the walls but doesn’t 
include windows and doors.
 
3. Open Vanishing Point (Filter➪Vanishing Point).
 
 The Vanishing Point window opens, displaying your image.
 
4. Create planes on your image in the Vanishing Point window.
 
a. Select the Create Plane tool (the second tool from the top on the 
left edge of the window).
 
b. Click on your image where you want to place the three corners of 
your plane and then move the cursor to the fourth corner.
 
 You see the plane extending along the last two sides.
 
c. Click the fourth corner to create the plane.
 
 If the plane is yellow or red rather than blue, it’s not aligned prop-
erly. Drag the corners of the plane to realign them, using the Edit 
Plane tool (the top tool on the left). Drag the side anchor points out-
ward to expand the plane’s mesh to cover the whole wall or side.
 
d. Create perpendicular planes by holding down the Ô/Ctrl key and 
dragging the side anchor point at the point where the two planes 
should meet. If the second plane should be at an angle other than 
90 degrees to the first plane, Option+drag/Alt+drag one of the 
anchor points to rotate the grid.
 
 If the second plane’s angle is off a little, drag one of the corner 
anchor points to adjust it. In Figure 10-10, you see two perpendicu-
lar planes.
 
5. Paste your pattern.
 
a. Press Ô+V/Ctrl+V to paste your pattern into Vanishing Point.
 
 Your pattern is pasted into the upper-left corner of the Vanishing 
Point window.
 
b. Select the Marquee tool (third from the top) and drag the pattern 
into your plane.
 
 The pattern automatically adopts the orientation of the plane. If 
necessary, press T on your keyboard and then rotate and scale the 
pattern.

215
 Chapter 10: Combining Images
Figure 10-10: Use the Create Plane tool to identify surfaces.
 
6. Replicate the pattern.
 
 Unless your pattern is an exact fit, you need to replicate it to fill the 
plane. With the Marquee tool selected, hold down the Option/Alt key. 
Then click and drag in your pattern to replicate it. Repeat as necessary 
to fill the plane. As you see in Figure 10-11, you can replicate a relatively 
small pattern to fill a large area.
 
 If the lighting in your original image varies, set the Healing pop-up 
menu (at the top of the window, only with the Marquee tool active) to 
Luminance. That helps maintain the original lighting on the new pattern 
or texture.
 
7. Click OK to exit Vanishing Point and apply the pattern or texture to 
your image.
 
 After exiting Vanishing Point, you might need to do some touch-up work 
on your image with the Clone Stamp tool (depending on how precise you 
were when dragging). You might also, depending on the original image, 
need to add a layer and paint some shadows or highlights to reproduce 
the original lighting in the scene.

216
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 10-11: Option+drag or Alt+drag with the Marquee tool to copy your pasted selection.
 
In Figure 10-11, the pasted and replicated brick pattern doesn’t cover the 
door, window, or artwork because they were not selected prior to opening 
Vanishing Point. Without that active selection when opening Vanishing Point, 
it would have been much more difficult to properly align the pattern without 
covering those areas.
Here are some tips for working with Vanishing Point:
 
✓ Create accurate planes; then drag. Click in four corners of any iden-
tifiable area of your plane — perhaps a window — and drag the side 
anchor points outward (or inward) to identify the whole plane.
 
✓ Use the X key to zoom. Pressing and holding the X key on your key-
board makes the preview area zoom to show the area where you’re 
working. Release the X key to zoom back out.
 
✓ Press T to transform. After pasting your pattern, you can press T on 
your keyboard and then scale and rotate your pasted pattern.
 
✓ Use the Shift key to drag in alignment. Hold down the Shift key while 
Option+dragging/Alt+dragging to replicate your pattern. That keeps the 
new part aligned to the old.

 Chapter 10: Combining Images
 
✓ Duplicate elements in the image. Make a selection with the Marquee 
tool and Ô+Option+drag/Ctrl+Alt+drag to the area where you want to 
place the copy.
 
✓ Paste over objects in Vanishing Point. Create your plane. Use the 
Marquee tool to select an area that you want to replace, and then hold 
down the Ô/Ctrl key and drag to an area that you want to paste into the 
marquee selection.
 
✓ Clone in Vanishing Point. Define your plane, select the Stamp tool, and 
Option+click/Alt+click at the source point. Release the Option/Alt key 
and move the cursor to the point where you want to start cloning. When 
the preview is properly aligned, click and drag to clone.
 
✓ Paint in perspective. With a plane identified, the Brush tool in Vanishing 
Point shrinks or grows in accordance with your perspective plane.
 
✓ Work on an empty layer. You can add an empty layer in the Layers 
panel before entering Vanishing Point. Your result is added to the new 
layer, which lets you work with blending modes and opacity to merge 
your pattern into the original.
Creating Panoramas with Photomerge
Sometimes a snapshot doesn’t adequately portray a scene. (It’s hard to cap-
ture the majesty of the Grand Canyon in a single frame.) For those situations, 
take a series of images and combine them into one large panorama with 
Photomerge.
The first step in using Photomerge successfully is taking appropriate photos. 
Here are some tips:
 
✓ Use a properly leveled tripod. Use a tripod, making sure that the tri-
pod’s head is steady and level so the individual photos align properly. If 
necessary, set the legs to different heights.
 
✓ Turn off auto-exposure. If you use your camera’s auto-exposure feature, 
each image is actually exposed differently because of the lighting in that 
frame. Instead, expose for the center (or most important) photo and use 
the same settings for all shots.
 
✓ Don’t use auto-focus with zoom lenses. Auto-focus can change the zoom 
factor of the lens. Instead, set the lens to manual focus after using auto-
focus on your most important shot.
 
✓ Overlap by at least 15 percent. Up to one-quarter of each shot (on each 
side) should overlap so that Photomerge can properly align neighboring 
images.

218
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
When working with images that are properly exposed and have suitable 
overlap, Photomerge is fully automated. You open Photomerge (visible in 
Figure 10-12), select the images you want to use, select how you want the 
component images to interact, click OK, sit back, and watch the magic as the 
elements are put into order, aligned, and blended.
Figure 10-12: Photomerge aligns and blends your elements automatically.
After Photomerge completes its mission, you’re left with a layered image 
that uses layer masks to combine the individual photos (one per layer) into 
a unified whole. Each layer is named for the file from which it was created. 
Typically you need to crop the panorama a bit to clean up the edges.

Precision Edges with Vector Paths
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding vector artwork
▶ Creating objects with shape layers
▶ Making a new path
▶ Changing the shape of an existing path
▶ Editing the shapes of type characters
M
ost of the images with which you work in Photoshop — digital 
photos and scanned artwork, layers on which you paint, and filled 
selections — are created with pixels. There’s also another type of artwork: 
vector art, which you create by defining a path (an outline) and adding color 
within that path. That path has a very precise edge, enabling vectors 
(when printed appropriately) to give you very crisp, clean lines 
in your artwork.
Typically, vector art consists of specific elements 
(objects) that are uniform in color (although vector 
art can also include gradients). You might have, for 
example, a red triangle, a blue square, and a green 
circle as your logo (boring!). These three solid-
color objects are best defined as vector artwork. 
Vectors, however, are not appropriate for photo-
graphic images and other such imagery that include 
subtle transitions among colors.
In Photoshop, you have tools that create predefined 
shapes; you have tools that create freeform shapes; you 
have tools to edit the paths that define those shapes. You 
also have a shape picker and a bunch of menu commands. 
You can even bring in artwork from Adobe Illustrator and create 
your own shapes, too. After reading this chapter, you’ll have a solid under-
standing of all these bits and pieces. I even tell you where to find dozens, 
or even hundreds, of custom shapes already on your computer — 
absolutely free!

220
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Pixels, Paths, and You
The vast majority of the artwork with which you work (or play) in Photoshop 
is raster artwork. Raster imagery consists of uniformly sized squares of color 
(pixels), placed in rows and columns (the raster). Digital photos, scanned 
images, and just about anything that you put on a layer in Photoshop con-
sists of pixels. When you edit the image, you’re changing the color of the indi-
vidual pixels, sometimes in subtle ways and sometimes in dramatic ways.
Vector artwork is a horse of another color. Rather than pixels, vector art con-
sists of a mathematically defined path to which you add color. In a dedicated 
vector art program, such as Adobe Illustrator, the path produces the shape 
of the object, and you add color 
along the path (stroke), within the 
path (fill), or both to make the shape 
become an object. Photoshop simu-
lates vector artwork using vector 
paths on shape layers to hide parts 
of a layer, so you can fill the “shape” 
but not add a stroke to the path. (A 
shape layer is filled with pixels of a 
specific color, or which form a gradi-
ent or a pattern; and a vector mask 
determines what part of the layer 
is visible.) Remember that you can 
use layer styles in conjunction with 
shape layers to simulate strokes and 
other effects.
Figure 11-1 shows a fine example of 
vector artwork. Observe that each 
element in the image consists of 
a single color. Each section of the 
image is easily identifiable as an 
individual object, consisting of a 
specific color. (Remember, though, 
that vector objects can be filled with 
gradients rather than color.)
Each element in the artwork is defined by its path, which consists of a 
number of path segments. In Figure 11-2, you see the path that defines the 
tongue. (You read about the anatomy of a path later in this chapter, in the 
section “Understanding paths.”)
 
When artwork is defined by pixels, the little square corners of the individual 
pixels can be noticeable along curves and diagonal lines. With vector art-
work, the path is sharp, and the edges are well defined. However, to truly 
get the best appearance from vector art or vector type, the artwork must be 
Figure 11-1: Each element in vector art has a 
single specific color.

221
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
printed to a PostScript-capable device, such as a 
laser printer. PostScript is a page-description lan-
guage that takes advantage of the mathematical 
descriptions of vector art. When you print to an 
inkjet printer, the vector art is converted to pixels. 
If you print to such a non-PostScript device, use a 
high image resolution for best output — 300 pixels 
per inch (ppi) is usually good.
A vector path can be scaled (changed in size) 
almost infinitely without losing its appearance. A 
vector logo can be used for both a business card 
and a billboard without loss of quality because the 
path is mathematically scaled before the stroke or 
fill is added. Raster art, on the other hand, can be 
severely degraded by such scaling. For a simple 
demonstration of the difference between scaling 
raster art and scaling vector art, see Figure 11-3.
Figure 11-3: Using text as an example shows the advantage of vector artwork when scaling.
Figure 11-2: Paths define the 
outline of an object — the 
snake’s tongue, in this case.

222
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Type in Photoshop is vector-based: That is, it’s created with paths. Objects 
in Photoshop, such as circles and squares that you create with vector paths, 
can also be scaled as vector artwork. The paths are recalculated to their new 
size and retain their crisp, sharp edges.
Easy Vectors: Using Shape Layers
If you made it through the preceding section, you’re officially an expert on 
the theory of vector graphics. It’s time to see how you can actually create 
these little devils in your artwork. Keep in mind that a vector shape in 
Photoshop actually consists of a shape layer with a path that defines what 
part of the layer is visible and what part is hidden. The content of the layer — 
be it solid color, pattern, or gradient — is visible within the path and hidden 
outside the path. The easiest way to create a shape layer in Photoshop is 
with the aptly named shape tools, which automatically create a color-filled 
layer with a vector path that shows/hides the layer according to the shape 
selected. Could you have it any easier? Just drag a tool and create a vector-
based “object”!
Your basic shape tools
Rectangles, rectangles with rounded corners 
(rounded rectangles), circles and ovals, multisided 
polygons, straight lines and arrows, and a whole 
boatload of special custom shapes are all at your 
command with a simple click-drag. Select the appro-
priate tool in the Toolbox, select the appropriate 
foreground color, and click-drag to create your 
object. (The various shape tools are nested in the 
Toolbox, as shown in Figure 11-4.) Sounds simple, 
right? It is — no tricks. Here are some additional 
features to make things even easier for you:
 
✓ Use the Shift key. Pressing the Shift key (both 
Mac and Windows) while you drag constrains 
proportions (maintains the width-to-height 
ratio). With the Shift key, the Rectangle tool 
creates squares; the Ellipse tool creates 
circles; the Polygon tool creates proportional polygons; the Line tool 
creates horizontal or vertical lines (or lines at 45° angles). When using 
custom shapes, pressing the Shift key ensures that the shape retains the 
width-to-height ratio with which it was originally defined.
Figure 11-4: The shape tools 
are collected in one spot in 
Photoshop’s Toolbox.

223
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
 
✓ Use the Option (Mac) or Alt (Windows) key. The Option/Alt key creates 
the object centered on the point at which you click. Without the Option/
Alt key, the object is created in whichever direction you drag.
 
✓ Use the Shift and Option/Alt key. Pressing the Shift and Option/Alt 
together helps you create a proportionally constrained object, centered 
on the point at which you click.
 
✓ Use the spacebar. While you’re dragging a shape, keep the mouse 
button down and press the spacebar. You can then drag to reposition 
the object while you create it. Still keeping the mouse button down, 
release the spacebar and finish dragging the object.
 
✓ Check the Options bar. When you switch from shape tool to shape 
tool, the Options bar changes to fit your needs. For example, with the 
Rounded Rectangle tool active, you choose the radius of the rounded 
corners. The Polygon tool offers a simple field in which you choose the 
number of sides for the shape. When you’re using the Line tool, choose 
the thickness (weight) of the line in the Options bar. And click the trian-
gle to the right of the shape tool icons in the Options bar to add arrow-
heads to the lines.
 
✓ Change the layer content. After you create a shape layer, you can 
change the color of the layer to another color with the menu command 
Layer➪Layer Content Options. To add a gradient or pattern to the shape 
layer, use the commands Layer➪Layer Style➪Gradient Overlay and 
Pattern Overlay.
 
✓ Edit the vector path. As you can see later in this chapter (in the section 
“Adding, deleting, and moving anchor points”), you can use the Direct 
Selection tool to change the course of the path, altering the appearance 
of the shape layer and, therefore, the shape of the object on the shape 
layer.
 
✓ Create work paths or pixel-filled shapes. Using the three buttons to the 
left on the Options bar, you can elect to create shape layers, work paths, 
or add pixels in the selected shape to your currently active layer.
You can easily spot a shape layer in the Layers panel — especially when the 
default layer name starts with the word Shape. (You can, of course, change 
the layer name by double-clicking it in the Layers panel.) You can see in the 
Layers panel shown in Figure 11-5 that the shape layer consists of a color-
filled layer (the thumbnail on the left) and a vector layer mask (the thumbnail 
on the right). That vector mask (a heart-shaped path, in this case) is also vis-
ible in the Paths panel when the shape layer is selected in the Layers panel. 
If you click the Background layer in the Layers panel, the Shape 1 Vector Mask 
in the Paths panel is hidden.

224
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 11-5: Dragging a shape tool creates a color-filler layer 
with a path to define a shape.
The Custom Shape tool
Although the basic shape tools are great for circles and squares and lines 
and arrows, you’ll probably get the most use out of the Custom Shape tool. 
With this tool selected, you click the triangle to the right of the sample shape 
on the Options bar to open the Custom Shape picker, as shown in Figure 11-6. 
The Custom Shape picker offers a number of ready-to-use shapes. When you 
click the triangle in the upper-right corner, you can choose from a variety of 
other sets of shapes listed at the bottom of the Custom Shape picker menu.
When you select a set of custom shapes from the menu (or use the Load 
Shapes command to add a set of shapes not in the menu), you are asked 
whether you want to add the new shapes to the current content of the 
Custom Shape picker (Append), replace the current shapes (OK), or not add 
the shapes after all (Cancel). When you load all the custom shape sets that 
come with Photoshop CS5, you’ve got a pretty impressive group from which 
to choose!
More custom shapes — free!
The custom shapes already available in Photoshop cover a wide range, 
but they might not fill all your needs. You can purchase commercial collec-
tions of custom shapes from a couple of sources. You can create custom 
paths and define shapes from them, too. But you’ve already got bunches 
of custom shapes on your computer, just waiting for you to use them. 
Select Photoshop’s Type tool and take a look in your Font menu. Check out 
the fonts already there with names like Wingdings, Webdings, Symbol, and 

225
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
Dingbats. These are all examples of symbol fonts, which are fonts that have 
shapes and symbols rather than letters and numbers. Many more typical 
fonts also have special characters available when you use the Shift key, the 
Option/Alt key, and the Shift key in combination with the Option/Alt key.
Figure 11-6: Load additional sets of custom shapes from the list at the bottom of the menu.
Here’s how you can define a custom shape from a symbol:
 
1. Choose File➪New to open a new document.
 
 The document can be virtually any size and can be either grayscale or 
color.
 
2. Select the Type tool and pick a font.
 
 With the Type tool active, choose a symbol font from either the Options 
bar or the Character panel. The font size doesn’t matter much because 
you’re creating a vector-based shape that you can easily scale. The 
foreground color doesn’t matter either, because shape tools rely on the 
foreground color active at the time you create the shape.

226
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
3. Type a single symbol and then end the editing session.
 
 Click the check mark button to the right on the Options bar, switch tools 
in the Toolbox, or press Ô+Return (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows) to 
end the editing session. (The symbol visible in Figure 11-7 can be pro-
duced by pressing the V key when using the font Webdings.)
 
4. Convert the type character to a shape layer.
 
 With the type layer active in the Layers panel, use the menu command 
Layer➪Type➪Convert to Shape.
 
5. Define a custom shape.
 
 Choose Edit➪Define Custom 
Shape, give your new shape a 
name in the Shape Name dialog 
box (shown in Figure 11-7), 
and save it. Your new shape 
is added to the Custom Shape 
picker, ready to use.
 
Later in this chapter, after you 
master using the Pen tool, remember 
this section. You can also define 
a custom shape from paths that 
you create with the Pen tool — any 
shape at all!
 
Remember that your custom shapes aren’t truly saved until you use the 
Custom Shape picker menu command Save Shapes (to save all the shapes in 
the picker as a single set) or the Edit➪Preset Manager command (to save a 
set of selected shapes). In the Preset Manager dialog box, Ô+click/Ctrl+click 
each of your custom shapes and then click the Save Set button to save them 
as a set (see Figure 11-8). Until you take this step, the shapes exist only in 
Photoshop’s Preferences file. If the Preferences become corrupt, you could 
lose all your custom shapes. This holds true, too, for custom brushes, layer 
styles, swatches, and the like — use the Preset Manager to save all your 
custom items.
 
When saving custom shapes (or layer styles or brushes or any of your other 
custom bits and pieces) with the Preset Manager, save them in a folder out-
side the Photoshop folder. That prevents accidental loss should you ever 
need to (gasp!) reinstall Photoshop. Figure 11-8 shows one possible folder 
structure for saving and organizing your custom bits and pieces.
Figure 11-7: Name your new shape and 
click OK.

Changing the appearance of the shape layer
After you use any one of the numerous shape tools in the Photoshop arsenal 
to add a shape layer to your artwork, you have a number of ways that you 
can enhance, adjust, and simply change its appearance:
 
✓ Add a layer style. Layer styles, 
such as bevels, glows, and 
shadows (applied through the 
Layer➪Layer Style menu), can 
certainly spice up a shape layer. 
Compare, for example, the 
pair of shapes in Figure 11-9. 
(Layer styles are presented in 
Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Change the layer content. Via 
the menu command Layer➪ Layer Content Options, you can select a dif-
ferent color, and you can use a layer style overlay to add a gradient, or 
choose a pattern to fill the shape layer.
Figure 11-9: A simple layer style makes your 
shape jump off the page.

228
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Edit the path shape. Click a path with the Direct Selection tool and drag 
to change the path’s shape. (This is discussed in more detail later in this 
chapter.)
 
✓ Change the layer blending mode or opacity. By default, your shape 
layer’s blending mode is Normal, and the Opacity is set to 100%. Your 
shape layer blocks and hides the content of every layer below. By chang-
ing the blending mode or opacity, you can make your shape layer inter-
act with the layers below in interesting ways. Experiment with different 
blending modes to find one that suits your artistic vision. (Blending 
modes are covered in more detail in Chapter 10.)
Simulating a multicolor shape layer
Shape layers are typically filled with a single solid color, although you can 
use a gradient or a pattern overlay. Sometimes, however, you’re better 
served with a multicolor shape. Take a look at Figure 11-10 and compare the 
pair of shape layers to the left with the same two shapes to the right.
Figure 11-10: Dressing up the shapes can make a world of difference.
In addition to the layer styles applied, layer masks hide parts of the more 
elaborate pair of shapes on the right. Like the vector path that hides parts 
of a shape layer, a layer mask determines what areas of the layer are visible. 
You can use layer masks and vector masks together on a single layer, as you 
can see for three of the four layers in Figure 11-11.

229
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
Figure 11-11: Layer masks and vector masks work together to determine layer visibility.
Comparing the color in the left column in the Layers panel to the artwork 
helps you identify what you see in Figure 11-11:
 
✓ Shape 1 copy: This is the top layer and would normally hide everything 
on the layers below. The layer, as you can tell from the leftmost thumb-
nail in the Layers panel, is filled with green. The rightmost thumbnail 
is the vector mask created by the Custom Shape tool. You can see the 
shape’s path in that thumbnail. The middle thumbnail is the layer mask. 
By painting with black in the layer mask, you can hide parts of the layer. 
In this case, only the left part of the shape layer is visible.
 
✓ Shape 2 copy: Again, a pair of masks are used together. You can see 
that the vector shape is an entire pair of scissors. The middle thumbnail 
shows that most of the layer is hidden by a layer mask, leaving only the 
blades of the scissors visible on the gray-filled layer.
 
✓ Shape 2: This layer requires only the vector path shape. The gray layer 
just above hides what would be black scissors blades.
 
✓ Shape 1: The layers above partially hide the red shape layer. Notice how 
because of the order of the layers in the Layers panel, the blades of the 
scissors appear to be in front of the red part of the object and behind 
the green part of the object.

230
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Adding a layer mask to your shape layer is as easy as clicking the Add Layer 
Mask button at the bottom of the Layers panel (third button from the left), 
and then painting with black to hide, white to show, and gray to partially 
hide. You can also make a selection in your image and use the Layer➪Layer 
Mask menu commands. You can add layer masks to any layer except those 
named Background. (You can’t have transparent areas on a background layer, 
but you can rename a background layer to convert it to a regular layer.)
Using Your Pen Tool to Create Paths
Even with all the custom shapes available, you might need to create a path 
that’s unique to a specific image. For that, Photoshop offers the Pen tool and 
its associated tools. Before you start creating paths willy-nilly, you can prob-
ably benefit from a little bit of background information about paths.
Understanding paths
As you click and click-drag, you place anchor points, which connect the path 
segments that create your path. Path segments can be straight or curved. You 
control those curves not with diet 
and exercise but rather with direc-
tion lines and their control points. A 
straight path segment is bordered on 
either end by corner anchor points, 
and a curved path segment is bor-
dered by two smooth anchor points 
or one of each type. As you can see 
in Figure 11-12, Photoshop helps you 
differentiate between path segments 
and direction lines by using squares 
(hollow and filled) for anchor points 
and diamond shapes for control 
points.
Only smooth anchor points have direction lines and control points. The angle 
and length of the direction line determine the shape of the curve. When you 
create a curved path segment between a corner anchor point and a smooth 
anchor point, only the smooth point’s direction lines adjust the curve. When 
you create a curved path segment between two smooth anchor points, both 
points’ direction lines affect the curve.
Figure 11-12: Paths have square anchor points 
and diamond-shaped control points.

231
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
 
Here’s another important way to classify paths in Photoshop:
 
✓ An open path has two distinct and visible endpoints; think of it as a 
pencil line or piece of string.
 
✓ A closed path has no beginning or end — like a circle or an unbroken 
rubber band.
When you use a shape tool, you’re creating closed paths. When you click-
click-click with the Pen tool, you create an open path — unless, that is, your 
final click is back on the very first anchor point.
Clicking and dragging your way 
down the path of knowledge
All that theory about how paths work is fine, but you’ll get a better under-
standing by playing around with the Pen tool. Open a new document (any 
size, resolution, and color mode will 
do) and select the Pen tool. On the 
Options bar, click the middle of the 
three buttons to the left (as shown in 
Figure 11-13) so that the tool creates 
work paths rather than shape layers, 
and then start clicking around. 
Randomly click in various places in 
the image, adding new straight path 
segments as you go.
 
Use the middle of the three buttons to the left in the Options bar when you 
want to create a path. Use the leftmost of the three buttons when you need a 
shape layer. The button on the right, for adding pixels to the current layer, is 
used only with shape tools.
I’m sure Picasso would be proud, but it’s time to let go of your new artwork 
and move on — press Delete (Mac) or Backspace (Windows) twice. The first 
time deletes the most recent anchor point; the second time deletes the rest 
of the path.
Now, in that same canvas, start click-dragging to create curved path seg-
ments. Watch how the distance and direction in which you drag control the 
segment’s curve. Just because it’s fun, try a click-drag and, with the mouse 
button held down, move the mouse around and around in a circle. “Path 
Jump Rope”! Press Delete/Backspace twice to delete the path.
Figure 11-13: Select the left button to create a 
shape layer, or the middle button to create a 
work path.

232
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Now, to get a feel for how to control your curved path segments, try this:
 
1. Choose File➪New to open a new document.
 
2. Choose 1024 x 768 from the Preset: Web group.
 
 A reasonable size to work with, it should fit on your screen at 100% 
zoom.
 
3. Show the Grid.
 
 Press Ô+’ (apostrophe; Mac) or Ctrl+’ (apostrophe; Windows) to show 
the Grid in the image. The Grid makes it easier to control the Pen tool 
as you drag. You can also show the Grid with the menu command 
View➪Show➪Grid. In Photoshop’s Preferences➪Guides, Grid & Slices, 
the Grid shown in Figure 11-14 is set to Gridline every: 1 inch and 
Subdivisions: 6.
 
4. Select the Pen tool in the Toolbox.
 
5. Click and click-drag as shown in Figure 11-14.
 
 Don’t worry about precision — you won’t be creating a work of art this 
time. Click on the dots in numeric order; where you see a dashed line, 
click-drag in that direction for approximately that distance.
Figure 11-14: You don’t need to be precise; just more or less follow the four patterns.

233
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
You’ve just created four of the more useful scallops and curve sets! These 
sorts of paths can be used in a variety of ways, including stroking, filling, 
and creating selections (all of which I discuss later in this chapter) to create 
decorative borders and artistic elements in your images.
You should know about a 
couple of other features 
of the Pen tool before you 
move on. With the Pen 
tool active, take a look at 
the Options bar (or look 
at Figure 11-15, which 
shows the Options bar).
When you have the Freeform Pen 
option selected in the Options Bar, 
you can click and drag around your 
image, creating a path as you go. It’s 
much like painting with the Brush 
tool or drawing lines with the Pencil 
tool — wherever you drag the tool, 
the path is created.
The Freeform Pen offers the 
Magnetic option, too. When you 
need to make a path (or selection) 
around the outside of something of 
uniform color in your image, using 
the Magnetic option forces the path 
to look for and follow edges. Take a 
look at Figure 11-16, which shows an 
example of an appropriate use for 
the Freeform Pen and the Magnetic 
option.
A closer look at the Paths panel
You can save, duplicate, convert, stroke, fill, and delete paths via the Paths 
panel (which, like all panels, you can show and hide through the Window 
menu). You can even create a path from a selection by using the Paths panel. 
Without the Paths panel, your paths have no meaning or future and probably 
won’t get into a good university or even a good collage.
Pick a path, any path
The Paths panel can hold as many paths as you could possibly want to add 
to your artwork. You can also see the six buttons across the bottom of the 
panel that you use to quickly and easily work with your paths. You can clas-
sify paths in the five different ways shown in Figure 11-17.
Figure 11-15: The Pen tool has a couple of tricks up its sleeve!
Figure 11-16: Tracing a uniformly colored 
object is a great job for the Freeform Pen using 
the Magnetic option.

234
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
You might not use them all, but it’s good to know the five types of paths:
Unsaved path
Saved path
Clipping path
Shape layer path
Vector mask
Create new path
Stroke path
Delete path
Fill path
Selection from path
Path from selection
Figure 11-17: The Paths panel is your key to organizing and 
controlling vectors in your artwork.
 
✓ Work path: As you create a path, Photoshop generates a temporary 
work path, which is not automatically saved. Unless you save your path, 
it’s deleted as soon as you start to create another path or when you 
close the file. To save a work path, simply double-click the name field in 
the Paths panel and type a new name.
 
✓ Saved path: Much like working in the Layers panel, you can double-
click the name of any path and rename it in the Paths panel. (You must 
rename a work path in order to save the path for later use.) After you 
give the path a name, it’s safe from accidental deletion.
 
✓ Clipping path: Clipping paths are used primarily with some page layout 
programs, such as QuarkXPress. Much like how a shape layer’s vector 
path determines what parts of the layer are visible, a clipping path 
identifies what part of the image as a whole is visible. You won’t need a 
clipping path when you work with Adobe InDesign — simply create your 
image on a transparent background and place that Photoshop file into 
an InDesign document. To create a clipping path, first make your path, 
give it a name in the Paths panel (to save it), and then use the Paths 
panel menu command Clipping Path.

235
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
 
✓ Shape layer path: When a shape layer is active in the Layers panel, its 
vector mask path is visible in the Paths panel. If you want to customize a 
shape layer’s path, you need to make the layer active first. When a shape 
layer path is visible, you can drag it to the New Path button at the bottom 
of the panel to create a duplicate. (It’s the second button from the right.)
 
✓ Vector mask path: When a regular layer has a vector mask assigned and 
that layer is visible in the Layers panel, the layer’s mask path is visible 
in the Paths panel.
 
When creating a clipping path, leave the Flatness field completely empty unless 
your print shop specifically instructs you to use a specific value. The Flatness 
value overrides the output device’s native setting for reproducing curves. 
Using the wrong value can lead to disastrous (and expensive!) mistakes.
To activate a path in the Paths panel, click it. You can then see and edit the 
path in the image window. With the exception of shape layer and vector mask 
paths, the paths in the Paths panel are independent of any layer. You could 
create a path with the Background layer active and then later use that path 
as the basis for some artwork on, for example, Layer 3.
The Paths panel buttons
The six buttons across the bottom of the Paths panel (refer to Figure 11-17) 
do more than just simple panel housekeeping. Use them to create artwork 
from a path and to convert back and forth between paths and selections.
 
✓ Fill Path: Click a path in the Paths panel and then use this button to fill 
the area inside the path with the foreground color. If you fill an open 
path (a path with two distinct endpoints), Photoshop pretends that 
there’s a straight path segment between the endpoints. The fill is added 
to the active layer in the Layers panel. If a shape layer or a type layer is 
selected in the Layers panel, the Fill Path button isn’t available. You can 
see filled (and stroked) paths in Figure 11-18.
Figure 11-18: Think about whether you want to stroke first (left) or fill 
first (right).

236
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Stroke Path: Click a path in the Paths panel and then use this button 
to add a band of the foreground color along the course of the path. 
Most often, you can think of it as painting the path itself with the Brush 
tool. If you have a different brush-using tool active in the Toolbox 
(Clone Stamp, Healing Brush, Dodge, Burn, Eraser, and so on), the path 
is stroked with that tool. Like a fill, a stroke is added to the currently 
active layer in the Layers panel. You can’t stroke a shape layer path. 
You can, however, duplicate such a path and stroke the copy on another 
layer. Take a look at Figure 11-18 to see how stroking and filling differ.
 
✓ Selection from Path: When you have a path selected in the Paths 
panel, you click this button, and voilà! An instant — and very precise — 
selection is at your disposal. You can create a selection from any path. 
If you want to add feathering to the selection, use the Paths panel menu 
command Make Selection rather than clicking the Selection from Path 
button.
 
✓ Path from Selection: You can create a work path from any selection 
simply by clicking this button. If the path isn’t as accurate as you’d like, 
or if it’s too complex because it’s trying to follow the corner of every 
pixel, use the Paths panel menu command Make Work Path and adjust 
the Tolerance setting to suit your needs.
 
✓ Create New Path: You’ll likely use this button primarily to duplicate an 
existing path. Drag any path to the button, and a copy is instantly avail-
able in the Paths panel. When you click this button, you’re not creating 
(or replacing) a work path but rather starting a new saved path.
 
✓ Delete Path: Drag a path to the Delete Path button or click the path and 
then click the button. Either way, the path is eliminated from the panel 
and from your artwork.
 
The order in which you stroke and fill a path can make a huge difference 
in the appearance of your artwork. The stroke is centered on the path, half 
inside and half outside. The fill extends throughout the interior of the path. 
If you stroke a path and then add a fill, the fill covers that part of your stroke 
that’s inside the path. As you can see in Figure 11-18, that’s not always a bad 
thing. (Both paths are visible for comparison purposes — normally only one 
path is active at a time.)
Rather than using the buttons at the bottom of the Paths panel to fill and 
stroke, you can also use the Paths panel menu commands Fill Path and 
Stroke Path. The commands open dialog boxes that offer more options than 
simply using the current foreground color. When using the Stroke Path com-
mand, you can choose from any of the brush-using tools, which enables you 
to, for example, very precisely dodge, burn, or clone along a path you create. 
When using Fill Path, you can add color or a pattern within the path, or fill to 
a designated state in the History panel. 

237
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
Keep in mind that Photoshop doesn’t really create vector objects. If you 
stroke or fill a path and then edit the path itself, the stroke and fill don’t 
move with the path — they stay right where they are, as pixels on a layer. If 
you’re used to working with vectors in Illustrator, this can be a nasty 
surprise.
 
Sometimes the easiest and fastest way to create a complex path is to make a 
selection and convert the selection to a path. You might, for example, click 
once with the Magic Wand and then click the Selection from Path button at 
the bottom of the Paths panel. Remember to rename the path to save it!
Customizing Any Path
Photoshop gives you a lot of control over your paths, not just when creating 
them, but afterward, as well. After a path is created, you can edit the path 
itself. While the path is active in the Paths panel, the Edit➪Transform Path 
commands are available, giving you control over size, rotation, perspective, 
skewing, and even distortion. But there’s also much finer control at your fin-
gertips. You can adjust anchor points, change curved path segments, add or 
delete anchor points, and even combine multiple paths into compound paths, 
in which one path cuts a hole in another. (Think donut.)
Adding, deleting, and moving anchor points
Photoshop provides you with a number of tools with which to edit paths 
although you might never use a couple of them. Consider, for example, the 
Add Anchor Point and Delete Anchor Point tools shown in Figure 11-19. Now 
take a look at the Option bar’s Auto Add/Delete option. With the Pen tool 
active, you automatically switch to the Delete Anchor Point tool when over 
an anchor point, and automatically switch to the Add Anchor Point tool when 
the cursor is over a path segment. Smart tool, eh? The Convert Point tool, 
on the other hand, can be invaluable . . . or valuable, at least. Click a smooth 
anchor point to convert it to a corner anchor point. Click-drag a corner anchor 
point to convert it to a smooth point.
Figure 11-19: Photoshop gives you every tool you need to edit vector paths.

238
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Nested in the Toolbox with the Path Selection tool (which you use to select 
and drag a path in its entirety), the Direct Selection tool lets you alter individ-
ual path segments, individual anchor points, and even the individual direc-
tion lines that control curved path segments.
When you click an anchor point with the Direct Selection tool, you can drag 
it into a new position, altering the shape of the path. If it’s a smooth anchor 
point, clicking it with the Direct Selection tool makes the point’s direction 
lines visible (as well as those of immediately neighboring smooth anchor 
points).
The Direct Selection tool has no user-definable options on the Options bar. 
It’s a pretty straightforward, no-nonsense tool that follows a few simple rules 
of behavior (which you can see illustrated by pairs of “before” and “after” 
paths in Figure 11-20):
 
✓ Drag a path segment. Drag a path segment with two corner anchor 
points, and you drag those points along with you. If the path segment 
has one or two smooth points, you drag the segment (reshaping the 
curve), but the anchor points remain firmly in place. Note in Figure 11-20 
(upper left) that when you drag a curved path segment, the adjoining 
direction lines change length, but they retain their original angles.
Figure 11-20: The pairs of paths are shown in color for illustrative purposes only — paths are 
generally black when active.
 
✓ Drag a corner anchor point. Click a corner anchor point and drag, and 
the Direct Selection tool pulls the two adjoining path segments along 

239
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
with it. As you can see in Figure 11-20 (upper center), the other two 
anchor points (and the path segment between them) are unchanged.
 
✓ Drag a smooth anchor point. When you drag a smooth anchor point, all 
four of the direction lines associated with the path segments on either 
side retain both their lengths and their angles. The direction lines don’t 
change; only the curved path segments connected at the smooth anchor 
point are altered. In Figure 11-20 (upper right), the path continues to 
flow smoothly through the anchor point, even as the point moves.
 
✓ Drag a smooth point’s direction line. Dragging a direction line changes 
the curves on either side of the anchor point so that the path still flows 
smoothly through the point. (Remember that you click the control 
point at the end of a direction line to drag it.) Figure 11-20 (lower left) 
illustrates how the path segments on either side of the smooth point 
adjust as the direction line is changed. However, paths don’t always flow 
smoothly through a smooth anchor point — not if you use the following 
trick!
 
✓ Option+drag/Alt+drag a direction line. Hold down the Option/Alt key 
and drag a smooth anchor point’s direction line, and you’ll break the 
flow of the path through that point. With the Option/Alt key, you change 
only the path segment on that side of the anchor point, leaving the 
adjoining path segment unchanged. In Figure 11-20 to the lower left, the 
direction line on the left is being dragged without the Option/Alt key (as 
described in the preceding bullet point). On the lower-right, adding the 
modifier key preserves the appearance of the adjoining path segment.
 
You can use the Shift key with the Direct Selection tool to ensure that you’re 
dragging in a straight line. You can also use the Shift key to select multiple 
anchor points before you drag.
Combining paths
As you’ve probably noticed through the course of this chapter, some paths 
are very simple (like the paths in the preceding figure), and some paths are 
more complex (like the shapes shown earlier in Figure 11-11). Complex paths 
are often compound paths: that is, paths that contain two or more paths 
(called subpaths) that interact with each other. Think about a pair of circles, 
different sizes, centered on top of each other. What if the smaller circle cut 
a hole in the middle of the larger circle, creating a wheel (or, depending on 
how early you’re reading this, a bagel)? Take a look at Figure 11-21.
There are several ways in which two (or more) paths can interact. Complete 
this sentence with terms from the following list: “The second path can (fill in 
the blank) the original path.”

240
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Add to: The areas within the 
two subpaths are combined as if 
they were within a single path.
 
✓ Subtract from: The second path 
is used like a cookie cutter to 
delete an area from within the 
first path. (When you need to 
make a bagel, this is the option!)
 
✓ Intersect with: Only the areas 
where the two subpaths overlap 
is retained.
 
✓ Exclude from: All the area 
within both subpaths is retained 
except where the two paths 
overlap.
When any shape tool or the Pen tool 
is active, the Options bar presents 
you with four buttons to determine 
the behavior of multiple paths. (The first path that you create will always be 
just a normal path. The buttons don’t come into play until you add additional 
subpaths.) Figure 11-22 shows you the buttons, tells you which is which, and 
provides a simple graphic representation to demonstrate the interaction. The 
upper-left path is the original, with the lower-right path showing how each 
option controls the interaction between subpaths.
Tweaking type for a custom font
I want to show you one more little thing you can do with vectors in 
Photoshop, a last bit of fun before this chapter ends. Each individual charac-
ter in a font consists of paths. You can convert the type to shape layers (or 
work paths) and change the appearance of the individual characters by edit-
ing their paths with the Direct Selection tool.
 
1. Open a new document in Photoshop.
 
2. Select 800 x 600 from the Web presets in the Preset menu and then 
click OK.
 
3. Select the Horizontal Type tool in the Toolbox and set the font.
 
 From the Options bar, choose Arial, set the font style to Bold, set the 
font size to 72, choose Sharp for anti-aliasing, left-align, and click near 
the lower left of your document.
Figure 11-21: Two (or more) paths can interact 
with each other, creating a compound path, 
consisting of two or more subpaths.

241
 Chapter 11: Precision Edges with Vector Paths
Figure 11-22: The buttons control how a second path (and any subsequent paths) interacts with your 
original path.
 
 Okay, in all honesty, you can use just about any settings you want — but 
if you use these settings, your image will look a lot like mine.
 
4. Type the word Billiards in your image.
 
5. Press Ô+Return/Ctrl+Enter to end the text editing session.
 
6. Choose Layer➪Type➪Convert to Shape.
 
 This changes the type layer (editable text on its own layer) to a shape 
layer (a layer filled with color, with only those areas within the vector 
path visible in the artwork).
 
7. Activate the Direct Selection tool.
 
8. Edit the shapes of the Ls and the D to simulate billiard cues.
 
 Drag the uppermost anchor points even farther upward to create cue 
sticks.
 
 See the result in Figure 11-23.

Dressing Up Images 
with Layer Styles
In This Chapter

▶ Creating your own styles
▶ Preserving your custom layer style
I
n artwork and photography, you use shadows and highlights in your 
image to produce the illusion of depth. Highlights and shadows lead the 
viewer to imagine that a light is falling on parts of a 3D object. You can 
also use a shadow or glow to make it appear that some distance 
exists between one object in the image and another object 
behind it. Photoshop’s built-in layer styles help you add 
shadows, glows, and other effects almost instantly.
In this chapter, I explain how transparent areas on 
layers enable lower layers to show through and let 
your layer styles appear on those lower layers. You 
get a good look at the Styles panel and how you use it 
to store and apply layer styles, including your very 
own custom styles. I then present the all-important 
(for layer styles) Layer Style dialog box and the vari-
ous effects that you can add with it. I also show you 
how to save (and protect) your custom layer styles.

244
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
What Are Layer Styles?
A layer style comprises one or more 
effects that surround or are applied 
to all the pixels on your layer. Effects 
that surround pixels include strokes 
(thin or thick outlines of color), 
shadows (just like the one this book 
is casting right now on your desk 
or lap), and glows (outlines of semi-
transparent color). Effects that are 
applied to pixels include overlays of 
color, patterns, or even gradients. 
But Photoshop offers even more, 
including the ever-popular Bevel 
and Emboss effect, which does a 
great job of giving the content of 
your layer a 3D look. And, of course, 
effects can be used in combination; 
check out Figure 12-1 for some exam-
ples. You can add effects to layers in 
several ways, including through the 
Layer Style menu at the bottom of 
the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 
12-2. I explain each of the effects 
individually later in this chapter in 
the section on creating your own 
custom layer styles.
 
Just so everyone is on the same 
sheet of music, when you refer to a 
drop shadow or an outer glow or a 
color overlay or any one of the other 
items shown in the menu in Figure 
12-2, call it a layer effect or simply an 
effect. 
After you apply an effect to a layer 
or save it in the Styles panel (which 
I discuss a bit later in this chapter), 
it becomes a layer style. A layer 
style can include one effect or sev-
eral effects. The individual layer 
effects are built into Photoshop, 
Figure 12-1: Strokes, shadows, overlays, and 
bevels are just some of the effects available.
Figure 12-2: You can add a layer style through 
the Layers panel.

245
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
but you can add or delete layer styles and even create your own. By the way, 
Blending Options, at the top of the list in Figure 12-2, isn’t actually a layer 
effect, but rather it governs how the colors of the pixels on the selected layer 
interact with pixels on layers below. The check marks to the left of some 
effects listed in Figure 12-2 indicate that those effects are already applied to 
the layer.
Some layer effects, such as drop shadows and outer glows, appear outside 
the content of the layer. For those effects to be visible in your artwork, the 
layer must have at least some area of transparent pixels. If the layer is filled 
edge to edge, the effect has no place within the image to appear because the 
glow or shadow would logically be outside the image’s canvas. Take a look at 
a couple of layer style examples in Figure 12-3.
In the sample on the left, you can 
imagine that the shadow logically 
also appears to the lower right of the 
object as a whole (as it does in the 
sample to the right). However, that’s 
outside the image’s canvas, so that 
part of the shadow doesn’t appear in 
the artwork.
 
Keep in mind that every layer in 
an image has the same number of 
pixels — but some of those pixels 
can be transparent. When a layer 
has areas of transparency, layers 
below in the image can show through. In the two examples in Figure 12-3, 
the yellow background layer is visible, giving the upper layer’s shadows 
a place to fall. (And remember that a layer named Background can’t have 
areas of transparency. Convert it to a regular layer by double-clicking the 
layer name in the Layers panel and renaming it.) Chapter 10 is full of infor-
mation on working with layers.
Using the Styles Panel
The Styles panel is, by default, nested with the Color and Swatches panels. 
Choose Window➪Styles to make it visible. This panel, which you see with its 
menu open in Figure 12-4, is where you find and store layer styles and is the 
easiest way to apply a layer style to your active layer.
To apply a layer style via the Styles panel, make the target layer active by 
clicking it in the Layers panel; then click the style that you want to apply. It’s 
Figure 12-3: Some layer effects need trans-
parent areas on the layer, or they won’t 
appear.

246
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
truly that simple! To remove a layer 
style from the active layer, click the 
leftmost button at the bottom of 
the Styles panel. You can click the 
middle button to save a custom layer 
style (which I explain later in this 
chapter), and you can drag a layer 
style to the Trash icon on the right to 
delete it from the panel.
Take a look at the Styles panel menu, 
starting from the top and making 
your way down to the bottom. The 
first command simply adds the style 
applied to the active layer to the 
panel (like clicking the Create New 
Style button). (Refer to Figure 12-4.)
In the second section of the menu, 
you can choose from five differ-
ent ways to view the content of the 
Styles panel. The Text Only, Small 
List, and Large List options might 
come in handy after you create a 
bunch of custom styles with names 
you recognize, but until you become 
familiar with the styles in the panel, 
their names are pretty much meaningless. The Large Thumbnail option gives 
you a better view of the effects in the style, but you see fewer styles at a time 
in the panel than you can with the default Small Thumbnails view.
The Styles panel Preset Manager command opens the same Preset Manager 
that you access through the Edit menu. Use the Preset Manager (discussed 
at the end of this chapter) to save custom styles in sets on your hard drive to 
protect them from accidental loss.
The next four commands in the Styles panel menu are what I call “housekeep-
ing commands” because you use them to control the content of the panel:
 
✓ Reset Styles: The Reset Styles command returns the content of the panel 
to its default. You have the option of adding the default set to the cur-
rent panel content with the Append button or replacing the current con-
tent with the selected set by clicking OK.
 
✓ Load Styles: Use the Load Styles command to add custom styles from 
your hard drive (or another location). You can even purchase prepared 
sets of layer styles on CD. The set is added to the current content of the 
panel automatically.
Create New Style
Clear Style
Delete Style
Figure 12-4: The Styles panel holds your preset 
and saved layer styles.

247
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
 
✓ Save Styles: The Save Styles command lets you save the current content 
of the panel as a set of styles. All the layer styles in the panel at the time 
are saved in the set.
 
✓ Replace Styles: Use the Replace Styles command to remove the current 
content and then add the selected set.
Below in the Styles panel menu, you can find a list of all the layer style sets 
saved in Photoshop’s Presets➪Styles folder. When you select a set from that 
list, you have the option once again of appending or replacing the current 
content of the panel. (The list in your Styles panel menu might differ from 
what’s shown in Figure 12-4.)
The last two commands in the Styles panel menu are used to control the vis-
ibility of the panel (Close) and the visibility of the panel and those panels 
nested with it (Close Tab Group), by default the Color and Swatches panels.
Creating Custom Layer Styles
You create a custom layer style by applying one or more layer effects to your 
active layer. (Once again, remember that you can’t apply layer effects or 
layer styles to a layer named Background.) When you have the effects looking 
just the way you want them, you can add that new style to the Styles panel 
and even save it for sharing with friends and colleagues. Combining multiple 
layer effects lets you create complex and beautiful layer styles that change 
simple shapes and text into art.
Exploring the Layer Style menu
In addition to the pop-up menu at the bottom of the Layers panel (refer 
to Figure 12-2), you can apply layer effects through the Layer➪Layer Style 
menu. As you can see in Figure 12-5, the Layer Style menu has a few more 
commands than the menu at the bottom of the Layers panel.
The ten items in the Layer Style menu below Blending Options are the actual 
layer effects. A check mark to the left of the effect indicates that it’s currently 
applied to the active layer. The Copy Layer Style and Paste Layer Style com-
mands come in handy, but if you’re more mouse- or stylus-oriented than 
menu-oriented, you’ll find it easier to add the style to the Styles panel and 
click the style to apply it to other layers. You can also Option/Alt+drag a 
layer style from layer to layer in the Layers panel to duplicate it. Clear Layer 
Style is the equivalent of using the leftmost button at the bottom of the Styles 
panel — it removes all layer effects from the target layer. The four commands 
at the bottom of the menu are worthy of a little special attention:

248
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Global Light: A number of 
layer effects are applied at 
an angle. Drop shadows, for 
example, simulate light coming 
from a specific angle (which, 
of course, determines where 
in your artwork that shadow 
falls). You use the Global Light 
command to set the default 
angle at which your effects are 
applied. Generally speaking, you 
want the angle to be consistent 
from effect to effect and from 
layer to layer in your artwork. 
There are exceptions, however, 
such as the situation shown in 
Figure 12-6. In that artwork, the 
two type layers have shadows 
receding at different angles to 
simulate a light source posi-
tioned immediately in front of 
and close to the image. (As you 
can read in the next section 
of this chapter, when you use 
layer effects that are applied at 
an angle, you have the option of 
using or not using the angle in 
Global Light.)
 
✓ Create Layers: Sometimes you 
need to edit a layer effect — say, 
to control where a drop shadow falls on the lower layers in the image. 
The Create Layers command rasterizes each layer effect (adds it to the 
image as a separate layer or layers containing pixels). You can then 
erase portions of the new layers, apply artistic filters, or otherwise cus-
tomize each effect layer. Remember that after a layer style is rasterized 
with this command, you can no longer edit it through the Layer Style 
dialog box, but the original style (if you added it to the Styles panel) is 
still available.
 
✓ Hide All Effects: You can temporarily hide a layer style with the Hide All 
Effects command. Alternatively (and more conveniently), you can click 
the eyeball icon next to the layer style in the Layers panel to hide the 
effects.
 
✓ Scale Effects: Use the Scale Effects command to uniformly make the 
layer style larger or smaller.
Figure 12-5: You can use the Layer Style menu 
to apply layer effects and more.

249
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
Figure 12-6: Sometimes shadows in your artwork shouldn’t all use the 
Global Light setting.
Exploring the Layer Style dialog box
The first step in creating custom layer styles is to become familiar with the 
individual layer effects. Each of the ten effects available in the Layer Style 
dialog box (see Figure 12-7) has its own set of options. Most of the basic 
default values are very good starting points: You might need to change only 
a color or perhaps adjust a Size, Distance, or Opacity slider. You can, of 
course, do lots and lots of customizing for some of the effects. 
In the column to the left in the Layer Style dialog box, you can select a check 
box to apply the effect, but you need to click the name of the effect to open 
that effect’s options pane. In Figure 12-7, the check marks show that this partic-
ular layer style includes a drop shadow, bevel, color overlay, pattern overlay, 
and stroke. The options pane for Bevel and Emboss is visible, as you can tell by 
the highlighting in the left column (not to mention the subtle Bevel and Emboss 
in bold at the top-center of the dialog box). And in the far right of the Layer 
Style dialog box, note the Preview check box (upper right, which shows what 
the layer style will look like) and the small sample just below. That sample 
shows how your style will look when applied to a square about 55 x 55 pixels.
 
Take a look at the bottom of the Layer Style dialog box in Figure 12-7. New 
to Photoshop CS5 are a couple of very welcome buttons: Make Default and 
Reset to Default. In addition to saving a new layer style every time you hit 
upon a winning combination of settings, you can make those favorite set-
tings the default. Change your mind later? One click is all it takes to reset to 
Photoshop CS5’s defaults.

250
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 12-7: The Layer Style dialog box has separate options for each layer effect.
 
As you read the descriptions of the various sets of options, keep in mind 
some generalities about a few key options that you’ll see a number of times:
 
✓ Color Selection: When you see a color swatch — a small rectangle or 
square, usually near the Blending Mode option — you can click it to 
open the Color Picker and select a different color.
 
✓ Noise: When you see the Noise slider, you can add a speckling effect to 
help diffuse a glow or shadow.
 
✓ Contour: Glows, shadows, and the like can be applied linearly, with a 
steady fade from visible to not visible. Or you can elect to have that 
transition vary with a nonlinear contour. Generally speaking, nonlinear 
contours can be great for bevels, but linear is usually best for shadows 
and glows unless you intend to create concentric halos.
 
✓ Angle/Use Global Light: You can change the angle for several layer 
effects by entering a specific angle in the numeric field or by dragging 
in the circular Angle controller. If the Use Global Light check box is 
selected, you change all the angles for that layer style.
Layer effects basics
In this section, I explain the basics of each of the ten layer effects, showing 
the options available in the Layer Style dialog box for that effect in an 
insert, as well as one or more examples. And don’t forget to take a look at 

251
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
the sidebar, “The four key blending modes.” Later in this chapter, you can 
read about the Opacity and the Fill sliders as well as some other advanced 
blending options.
Drop Shadow
A drop shadow is a great way to separate the content of one layer from 
the rest of the image, as you can see by comparing the two versions of the 
artwork in Figure 12-8. In effect, the content of the target layer is copied, 
converted to black, and placed behind your layer. The blending mode 
and opacity determine how the shadow interacts with the layers below. 
You decide how much to offset and blur the duplicate with the sliders. 
(Remember that this is a layer style, so no second layer is actually added to 
your image.) You’ll generally want to leave the Contour option of your drop 
shadows set to the linear default. As you saw in Figure 12-6, drop shadows 
are great with type layers!
Figure 12-8: Drop shadows can visually separate the upper layer from the lower layer.
Inner Shadow
You can do a couple of things with the Inner Shadow layer effect, as you can 
see in Figure 12-9. Compare the two sets of options. On the left, a soft, light-
colored inner shadow using the Screen blending mode softens edges. On 
the right, a hard inner shadow, using a dark color and the Multiply blending 
mode, produces a totally different look. Despite what your eyes might be tell-
ing you, the layer effect is applied to the red shape on the upper layer.

252
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 12-9: Inner shadows can be soft or hard, light or dark.
Outer Glow
The Outer Glow layer effect is much like a nondirectional shadow when 
applied using a dark color. However, it also has a variety of uses with a light 
color and the Screen blending mode. As you can see in Figure 12-10, it has 
The four key blending modes
Photoshop offers over two dozen different 
blending modes, many of which you see in the 
Layer Style dialog box. You really need only a 
few on a regular basis, although it’s always fun 
to experiment with the others, just in case one 
of them gives you a cool effect.
The Multiply blending mode generally dark-
ens. When working with dark shadows or 
glows, choose the Multiply blending mode so 
that the layer effect darkens (but doesn’t hide 
completely) the pixels on the layers below. The 
Screen blending mode lightens. Use Screen 
with light glows and other such effects. The 
Overlay blending mode is a mix of Multiply 
and Screen. When working with patterns that 
contain both dark and light colors, you might opt 
for Overlay as the blending mode.
Of course you should remember the Normal 
blending mode, too! If you want a glow or 
shadow to completely block whatever lies 
below, choose Normal at 100% opacity. You 
might also want to use Normal with a some-
what lower opacity for a uniform coverage over 
both dark and light pixels. And don’t be afraid to 
experiment — run through the blending modes 
(and opacity settings) to see whether you can 
tweak that custom style just a little more. (For 
more information on blending modes, see 
Chapter 10.)

253
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
practical and whimsical uses. (Please remember that in real life, stars do not 
appear between the horns of a crescent moon!)
In the Structure area at the top of the Outer Glow options, you can select the 
blending mode and opacity, add noise if desired, and select between a color 
(click the swatch to open the Color Picker) or a gradient (click the sample 
to open the Gradient Editor). You define the size and fade of the glow in the 
Elements area. The Technique pop-up menu offers both Softer and Precise — 
try them both. And don’t overlook the options at the bottom, in the Quality 
area. Although you use Jitter only with gradients to add some randomness, 
the Range slider is an excellent way to control the distance at which your 
glow is offset. And when you get a chance, play with different contours for an 
Outer Glow effect.
Figure 12-10: An Outer Glow layer effect is a multipurpose layer effect.
Inner Glow
The Inner Glow effect offers you the same control as an Outer Glow, with 
the impact of an Inner Shadow. As you can see in Figure 12-11, an Inner Glow 
can be the base for a neon glow style. (Add an Outer Glow effect, perhaps a 
Stroke effect, and there you go!)

254
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 12-11: Inner Glow offers more control than Inner Shadow.
You can also develop some rather amazing styles by using the Inner Glow 
and the Inner Shadow in combination. Using similar Size settings and varying 
the colors and blending modes let you overlay a pair of effects in combina-
tion. And when you play with Inner Glow and Inner Shadow in combination, 
don’t overlook the Contour variations.
Bevel and Emboss
Perhaps the most fun of all the Photoshop layer effects, Bevel and Emboss is 
a quick and easy way to add a 3D look to your artwork. You can apply a Bevel 
and Emboss layer effect to text or to buttons for your Web site. You can also 
use this effect to create more complex elements in your artwork, examples of 
which appear in Figure 12-12.
 
When you feel the need and have the time to let your imagination frolic 
through the fertile fields of Photoshop fun, filters are first, but the Bevel and 
Emboss layer effect follows fruitfully. Take the time to play with the vari-
ous settings in the Bevel and Emboss pane of the Layer Style dialog box to 
see what they do. Add a new layer, create a simple shape (perhaps with one 
of the shape tools), select Bevel and Emboss from the pop-up menu at the 
bottom of the Layers panel, and experiment — that’s a far more efficient way 
to get to know this effect than reading technical explanations of each of the 
options. (One caveat: You won’t see any change in your layer with the Stroke 
Emboss style unless you’re also using the Stroke layer effect.) Don’t forget to 
play with the various Gloss Contour presets!

255
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
Figure 12-12: The Bevel and Emboss layer effect is very versatile.
As you read this book, keep an eye out for the Bevel and Emboss layer effect. 
When you come across a bevel or emboss effect, such as those shown in 
Figure 12-13, you might want to take a moment to remember your experimen-
tation and think about what settings I might have used.
Satin
The Satin layer effect uses the shape of the object to produce a wave-like 
overlay. As you can see in Figure 12-14, it’s more effective with type and com-
plex shapes than it is with large plain shapes.
Color Overlay
The key to using the Color Overlay layer effect is the blending mode. (See the 
sidebar, “The four key blending modes” elsewhere in this chapter.) When you 
use Normal, in effect, you paint all the pixels on the layer with the selected 
color. To blend the color with the original artwork or other effects (such as 
pattern overlays), choose an appropriate blending mode — Multiply with 
dark colors, Screen with light colors — or simply experiment with blend-
ing modes. However, using the Color Overlay layer effect with the Normal 
blending mode in a custom layer style is a good way to ensure consistency in 

256
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
artwork, such as buttons and banners for a Web site. Keep in mind, however, 
Cover Overlay at 100% opacity and Normal completely hide any Gradient 
Overlay or Pattern Overlay effect.
Figure 12-13: Many illustrations in this book use the Bevel and Emboss layer effect.
Figure 12-14: The Satin layer effect is very effective with complex shapes.

257
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
Although you’ll generally find Color Overlay most useful for simple shapes in 
artwork and on Web pages, you can certainly use it for more exciting effects, 
such as the effects shown in Figure 12-15. The original is in the upper left, and 
each example shows the color and blending mode selected. Remember that 
when you use a layer effect, you can later return and alter or remove that 
change from your image.
Figure 12-15: Color Overlay can produce subtle or dramatic changes in your artwork.
Gradient Overlay
Unlike the Gradient Map adjustment (see Chapter 6), which applies a gradient 
to your image according to the tonality of the original, the Gradient Overlay 
effect simply slaps a gradient over the top of the layer content, using the 
blending mode and opacity that you select. You also control the shape of the 
gradient, the angle at which it’s applied, and the gradient’s scale (see Figure 
12-16). And don’t forget that a Gradient Overlay using the Normal blending 
mode and 100% opacity will hide any Pattern Overlay effect.
 
When working with gradients, you click the triangle to the right of the gradi-
ent sample to open the Gradient panel. You directly click the gradient sample 
itself to open the Gradient Editor. (See Chapter 14 for more information on 
editing and creating gradients.)

258
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 12-16: In keeping with its name, the Gradient Overlay effect overlays a gradient.
Pattern Overlay
Like the Color Overlay layer effect, Pattern Overlay relies on the blending 
mode and opacity settings to determine how the artwork (pattern) that it 
overlays interacts with your original artwork. As you see in Figure 12-17, you 
can scale the pattern, align it to the upper-left corner of your image (with the 
Snap to Origin button), and link the pattern to your layer so that the appear-
ance of your artwork doesn’t change as you drag the layer into position. Click 
the triangle to the right of the sample pattern to open the Pattern panel and 
then select a pattern.
Stroke
If you’ve read this chapter to this point, you’ve seen the Stroke layer effect 
for several pages now. Each of the insets from the Layer Style dialog box in 
the preceding figures has a one-pixel black Stroke layer effect applied. Adding 
that tiny stroke helps set off the dialog box from the background.
 
Not only is Stroke a handy and practical production tool, but it’s a wonder-
ful creative effect, too, especially when you use it in conjunction with other 
layer effects. For example, a stroke of a contrasting color is a great way to 
redefine the edge of your object when working with an outer glow and an 
inner shadow. (In the Stroke effect’s options, remember that you click the 
color swatch to open the Color Picker.) A simple stroke can convert even the 
plainest text into an eye-catching statement. And don’t forget that without 
the Stroke effect, the Bevel and Emboss effect’s Stroke Emboss option does 
nothing for your artwork. Figure 12-18 has a few examples of layer styles, 
including a Stroke effect.

259
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
Figure 12-17: The Pattern Overlay layer effect adds texture to your layer’s artwork.
Figure 12-18: The Stroke effect can stand alone or be used with other layer effects.
Opacity, fill, and advanced blending
In the Blending Options area of the Layer Style dialog box and the upper-right 
corner of the Layers panel, you see a pair of adjustments named Opacity and 

260
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Fill Opacity, as shown in Figure 12-19. Both have an impact on the visibility of 
the content of your layer.
Figure 12-19: The Opacity and Fill Opacity sliders control visibility of a layer.
When you reduce the Opacity setting for the layer, you make the layer con-
tent and any layer style partially or completely transparent. Reducing the 
Fill slider changes the opacity of the pixels on the layer but leaves any layer 
effects fully visible. When might you want to use the Fill slider? The first thing 
that comes to mind is when creating the ever-popular Glass Type technique, 
which produces see-through text that’s perfect for your copyright notice on 
any image:
 
1. Add some text to an image with the Type tool.
 
 This is a wonderful trick for adding your copyright information to 
sample images because everyone can see the image, but no one can use 
it without your permission. Start by adding your copyright information 
or perhaps the word Sample.

261
 Chapter 12: Dressing Up Images with Layer Styles
 
2. Apply a layer style to the type 
layer.
 
 A bevel, a thin black stroke, and 
perhaps an inner shadow or 
white outer glow make an excel-
lent combination. (Select the 
individual effects as described 
earlier in this chapter.)
 
3. Reduce the Fill slider to 0%.
 
 Adjust Fill at the top of the 
Layers panel or in the Layer 
Style dialog box’s Blending 
Options pane. You can click 
and type in the Fill field, click 
the arrow to the right of the 
field and drag the slider, or 
simply click the word Fill and 
drag to the left. The type layer 
disappears, but the layer effect 
remains.
 
 You can see all three steps in 
Figure 12-20.
The Blending Options pane of the 
Layer Style dialog box offers you 
a number of other choices in the 
Advanced Blending area, as shown 
in Figure 12-21.
Other than the Fill Opacity slider, you’ll probably never change the Advanced 
Blending options from their default settings, but you might be curious about 
what they do. Here’s a short explanation of each:
 
✓ Channels: Clear one or more of the color check boxes in the Advanced 
Blending area to hide the layer’s content in that color channel. Clear 
the R check box, for example, and you hide the target layer in the Red 
channel.
 
✓ Knockout: You can use the content on the target layer to create trans-
parency on lower layers. The top layer becomes transparent as do the 
layers below every place that the upper layer had visible pixels. (I think 
of it as a “cookie cutter” effect.) If you want to restrict the effect, use the 
Figure 12-20: In some cases, using the Glass 
Type effect makes the text more visible.
Figure 12-21: You find Advanced Blending 
options on the Blending Options pane of the 
Layer Style dialog box.

262
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Shallow option, and the knockout extends only to the lowest layer in 
your layer group. The Deep option knocks out to the Background layer 
(or to transparency if your image doesn’t have a background layer).
 
✓ Blend Interior Effects as Group: You can blend the Inner Glow, Satin, 
and your overlay effects before the layer as a whole is blended with 
lower layers. Use this option if it seems your layer effect’s blending 
mode is being canceled out by the layer’s own blending mode.
 
✓ Blend Clipped Layers as Group: If you have layers clipped together (see 
Chapter 10), you can elect to use the base layer’s blending mode for all 
the layers or let each layer interact independently. You generally want 
to leave this check box selected.
 
✓ Transparency Shapes Layer: Another option that you’ll almost always 
want active, Transparency Shapes Layer restricts the layer style to the 
visible pixels on the target layer. If, for example, you’re working with a 
small rounded rectangle and a Color Overlay layer effect, clearing the 
check box fills the entire layer — not just the rounded rectangle — with 
color.
 
✓ Layer Mask Hides Effects: If the target layer’s visibility is controlled 
with a layer mask (see Chapter 8), you can opt to have the layer style 
hidden by the mask, too. You can also use a layer mask to hide just the 
layer style with this option — say, when you need to make sure that 
your drop shadow doesn’t fall where it shouldn’t. Simply create a layer 
mask that hides those areas where you don’t want the style visible and 
mark the Layer Mask Hides Effects check box.
 
✓ Vector Mask Hides Effects: This option uses a layer’s vector mask in 
exactly the same way that the Layer Mask Hides Effects option uses a 
layer mask. (Remember that a vector mask is a path that determines 
which areas of a layer are visible — see Chapter 11 for information on 
creating paths.)
 
If you have an image with a plain white (or plain black) background, you can 
make that background disappear with the Blend If sliders (see Figure 12-22). 
In the Layers panel, double-click the layer name Background and rename the 
layer. At the bottom of the Layers panel, click the second button from the 
right to add a new layer. Move the new layer below the original layer. With 
the original layer active, open the Blending Options pane of the Layer Style 
dialog box and drag the upper-right Blend If slider control to the left until the 
background disappears. As the white background disappears, the checker-
board transparency grid becomes visible. Press Ô+E (Mac)/Ctrl+E (Windows) 
to merge the layers and retain the now-transparent background.

Saving Your Layer Styles
Creating custom styles takes some time and effort. Saving the styles means 
that you don’t have to spend time re-creating the style. Save your styles not 
only in the Styles panel but also on your hard drive.
Adding styles to the Style panel
After you have your layer style looking just right, you can add it to the Styles 
panel. From the Styles panel, you can apply your custom style to any layer 
(except, of course, layers named Background) in any image with a single click. 
You simply make the target layer active in the Layers panel by clicking it; 
then click your custom style in the Styles panel.
To add your style to the Styles panel, you must first create it. Select a layer in 
the Layers panel, open the Layer Style dialog box, and select the layer effects 
and options. Click the New Style button to save the style or, after clicking 
OK in the Layer Style dialog box, click the middle button at the bottom of 
the Styles panel. Then, in the New Style dialog box that appears, assign your 
custom style a name and click OK. If desired, you can also elect to save the 
target layer’s blending mode as part of the layer style.
Preserving your layer styles
 
Adding your custom styles to the Styles panel makes them available day in 
and day out as you work with Photoshop. However, should you ever need to 
replace the Preferences file (see Chapter 3) or reinstall the program, all your 

264
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
custom styles are wiped from the Styles panel. To make sure that you don’t 
accidentally lose your custom styles, create and save a set of styles, which 
you can then reload into the panel whenever necessary.
The Styles panel menu offers the 
Save Styles command (refer to Figure 
12-4), which lets you save all the 
styles currently in the panel as a set. 
However, for more control — to actu-
ally select which styles you want in 
your set — use Photoshop’s Preset 
Manager (see Figure 12-23). You can 
open the Preset Manager from either 
the Styles panel menu or through 
the Edit menu. (Make sure that you 
retain the .asl extension in the file-
name so that Photoshop recognizes 
the file as a set of styles!)
As you can see in Figure 12-23, you use Preset Manager to save many kinds of 
custom bits and pieces. And use it you should! Shift+click to select a series of 
items or Ô+click/Ctrl+click to select individual items; then click the Save Set 
button. Give the set a name (again, with the .asl file extension), pick a loca-
tion, and click OK.
 
Saving sets of styles, brushes, custom shapes, and the like in the Photoshop 
Presets folder adds those sets to the various panels’ menus. That makes it 
quite easy to load the set into the panel: Just choose the set from the panel 
menu. However, you should also save a copy of the set someplace safe, out-
side the Photoshop folder, so it doesn’t accidentally get deleted when you 
upgrade or (horror!) reinstall.
Figure 12-23: Use the Preset Manager to make 
sure your custom styles are safe.

U
n croquis vaut mieux qu’un long discours. Or, as folks often paraphrase 
Napoleon, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” But sometimes in 
your Photoshop artwork, nothing says Bob’s Hardware quite like the very 
words Bob’s Hardware. A picture of a hammer and a picture of a nail — 
perhaps toss in some nuts and bolts — all are great symbols for 
your client’s logo. However, you also need to give Bob’s 
customers a name and an address so they can actually 
spend some money, which goes a long way toward 
helping Bob pay you.
For a program that’s designed to work with 
photographic images, Photoshop has incredibly 
powerful text capabilities. Although it’s not a 
page-layout program such as Adobe InDesign or a 
word-processing program such as Microsoft Word, 
Photoshop can certainly enable you to add lines, 
paragraphs, or even columns of text to your images.
Photoshop offers you three categories of text:
 
✓ Point type is one or more lines of text, comparable with 
the headlines in a newspaper or the text that you add to, 
say, a Bob’s Hardware advertisement. Click with a type tool to add 
point type.
 
✓ Paragraph type consists of multiple lines of text. Like in a word-pro-
cessing program, a new line is started whenever your typing reaches the 
margin. Drag a type tool to create paragraph type.

266
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Warp type and type on a path are typically single lines of type that are 
bent, curved, or otherwise distorted as a special effect. Use the Option 
bar’s Warp Text feature (or Edit➪Transform➪Warp), or click with a type 
tool on a path.
In this chapter, I discuss the tools and panels that you use to add text to an 
image, how to add paragraphs and columns of text (as you might use in a bro-
chure or booklet), and even how to make your type bend and twist along paths.
Making a Word Worth a Thousand Pixels
To control your work with text, Photoshop offers you four tools, the 
Options bar, the Character and Paragraph panels, and several options in the 
Preferences dialog box (both in the Type section, visible in Figure 13-1, and in 
the Units & Rulers section). By default, the Character and Paragraph panels 
are hidden; because you can make the major type-related decisions (such 
as font style and alignment) right from the Options bar, that’s generally fine. 
You might need to show the panels if you’re doing some fine-tuning of the 
text appearance. When you need the panels, you can show them through the 
Window menu.
Figure 13-1: Photoshop gives you lots of tools for working with text.

267
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
As you can see in Figure 13-1, the Font menus in the Options bar and the 
Character panel can show a sample of the typeface (using the word Sample) 
when you click on them. You can activate the preview and choose from five 
different sizes for the font preview in the Preferences.
Type can be informative or decorative or both. You can use the type tools to 
add paragraphs of text or a single character as an element of your artwork. 
(In Chapter 11, you can even see how to make custom shapes from your 
various symbol fonts.) The text can be plain and unadorned or elaborately 
dressed up with layer styles, such as drop shadows, glows, bevel effects, and 
other effects that you apply to make the layer content fancier. (Layer styles 
are discussed in Chapter 12.) However you use it, text can be a powerful 
element of both communication and symbolism. Take a look at Figure 13-2, 
in which I use the Type tool to add the binary code to the left and even the 
musical notes below.
Figure 13-2: You can also use type as symbolic or decorative elements.
But before you add any text to your artwork, you need to have a good handle 
on the various type tools, panels, menus, and options available to you. I start 
with an introduction to Photoshop’s type tools.

268
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
A type tool for every season, or reason
Photoshop offers four type tools — or, perhaps more accurately, two pairs of 
type tools — that assist you with adding text to your images. The Horizontal 
Type tool and the Vertical Type tool (the first pair) create type layers, which 
show up as special layers in the Layers panel that enable you to later re-edit 
the text that you put there. The Horizontal Type Mask tool and the Vertical 
Type Mask tool (the second pair) make selections on the active layer, just 
as if you had used the Rectangular Marquee or Lasso tools (as I describe in 
Chapter 8).
In addition to that glorious advantage of being able to easily correct accidental 
misspellings, creating and using type layers offer a number of other advantages. 
You can
 
✓ Apply layer styles to type layers to fancy them up. For example, try a 
simple Inner Bevel or Drop Shadow effect to make the words leap from 
the background.
 
✓ Adjust type layer blending modes and opacity. Doing this can help 
you achieve a unique integration with the artwork’s other elements or 
background.
 
✓ Produce extraordinarily crisp and clean type on the page. When 
printing with a laser printer (or other PostScript device), the text on 
type layers prints beautifully.
Until the image is flattened or the type layer is merged or rasterized 
(converted to pixels), you can change any type attribute, such as the spelling, 
font, layer styles, opacity, and blending modes as I show in Figure 13-3.
 
You automatically gain the advantage of using type layers when you use 
the Horizontal Type or Vertical Type tools to add text to your images in 
Photoshop. (You can spot a type layer in the Layers panel easily. The layer 
shows a T instead of a preview for the layer thumbnail.)
Whether you’re adding a simple “© Peter Bauer” (yeah, okay, use your own 
name if you want) to an image or a couple of columns of text to a brochure, 
you’ll generally use the Horizontal Type or Vertical Type tools. But when, you 
might ask, would you ever need to use the type mask tools? Perhaps never. If 
you ever need a selection in the shape of your text, though, you can manage 
that trick by adding a type layer and then Ô+clicking (Mac) or Ctrl+clicking 
(Windows) the type layer’s thumbnail in the Layers panel. Voilà! You’re pre-
sented with a text-shaped selection, and you still have an editable type layer 
that you can hide and save, just in case.

269
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
Figure 13-3: When you have type layers, you have the flexibility to make changes.
 
That, of course, doesn’t answer the questions of why you might want a 
text-shaped selection in the first place, why type mask tools even exist, or 
why the sky is blue. Although the third question is probably better answered 
in a book named Skies For Dummies, here are a number of reasons to use a 
type mask tool:
 
✓ Stroke: You can stroke a selection, which adds a line of color along the 
path of the selection. With a type-shaped selection, this gives you a 
type-shaped line of color. Stroke a selection with the menu command 
Edit➪Stroke.
 
✓ Fill: You can fill that selection with color, a gradient, or even a pattern 
with the Edit➪Fill command.
 
✓ Delete: You can delete that selection from an existing area of color, 
creating a type-shaped hole in the color or layer. I chopped the words 
in Figure 13-4 from the wrench-shaped sign with a text-shaped selection 
made with the Horizontal Type Mask tool.

270
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 13-4: Use type mask tools to quickly and easily make text-shaped selections.
Whether working with type layers or 
creating type masks, you have the 
option of using either horizontal 
or vertical type. The difference 
between type that is set vertically 
and the more common horizontal 
type rotated 90 degrees is illustrated 
in Figure 13-5. The figure also shows 
that when you add text with a type 
mask tool, you see the characters 
cut out of a red overlay (top right in 
figure); when done, you see the 
traditional marching ants selection 
border (bottom right). Chapter 8 
gives you more information on 
working with selections.
Figure 13-5: Vertical type stacks the individual 
characters. You can rotate horizontal type for a 
different look.

271
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
 
You can select type options before adding text to the image, or you can 
change your options afterward. When you make the type layer active in the 
Layers panel — but haven’t yet selected any text in your image — any 
changes that you make are applied to all the text on the layer. You can also 
click and drag to select some of the text on the layer and make changes to 
only those characters or words.
When you’re done adding or editing text, you can end the editing session in 
any of a number of ways:
 
✓ Click the check mark button (or the Cancel button) on the Options bar.
 
✓ Switch to a different tool in the Toolbox.
 
✓ Press Ô+Return or Ctrl+Enter.
 
✓ Ô+Shift+click or Ctrl+Shift+click to finish that type layer and start a new 
type layer.
What are all those options?
Here you are, the proud owner of the world’s state-of-the-art image editor, 
and now you’re adding text, setting type, and pecking away on the keyboard. 
You’re faced with a lot of variables. Which options are you going to need all 
the time? Which ones are you going to need now and then? Which ones can 
you ignore altogether? Read on as I introduce you to the various text and 
type variables, and toss in a few general guidelines on which options are 
most (and least) frequently required.
Take a look at Figure 13-6, in which you can see (in all their glory) the most 
commonly used text attributes, all of which are available to you from the 
Options bar whenever a type tool is active.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
You can change the following text attributes via the Options bar, which is 
usually available at the top of your screen:
 
✓ Tool Presets: The Tool Presets panel enables you to select a predefined 
set of options that you’ve already saved. Say, for example, that you 
always use the same appearance for headlines in a recurring project and 
a different appearance for the body type. Set up each as a preset and 
then activate all the options with a single click. (See Chapter 3 for more 
detailed information on tool presets.)
 
✓ Orientation: The Orientation button toggles existing type layers 
between horizontal and vertical. Regardless of what type is selected, the 
entire type layer is flipped when you click this button. (The button is 
grayed out when no type layer is active in the Layers panel.)
 
✓ Font menu: Click the triangle 
to the right of the Font Family 
field to open the Font menu, 
showing all your active fonts in 
alphabetical order. You can also 
click in the field itself and use 
the arrow keys to switch fonts. 
If you select some type with 
a type tool first (as shown in 
Figure 13-7), using an arrow 
key automatically applies 
the change to the selected 
characters. If no characters are 
selected, you change the entire 
type layer.
 
✓ Font Style: When a font has 
multiple styles built in, you 
can choose a variation of the 
font from the Font Style menu. 
Styles include Regular (or 
Roman), Bold, Semibold, Italic, 
Condensed, Light, and combi-
nations thereof (as you see in 
Figure 13-8). Many fonts, however, have no built-in styles.
 
✓ Font Size: You can select a font size in three ways: by typing a number 
in the Font Size field, by clicking the triangle to the right of the field and 
Figure 13-7: Select specific characters, such 
as the words SELECTING THEM, to change 
some, or make no selection to change all.

273
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
selecting a font size from the 
pop-up menu that appears, or 
by clicking the TT icon to the left 
of the Font Size field and then 
dragging left or right to change 
the value in the field. Font size 
is generally measured in points 
(1 point = 1/72 inch), but you 
can elect to use pixels or 
millimeters. Make the units 
change in Photoshop’s 
Preferences (choose 
Preferences➪Units & Rulers).
 
✓ Anti-Aliasing: Anti-aliasing 
softens the edges of each 
character so that it appears 
smooth on-screen. As part 
of this process, anti-aliasing hides the corners of the individual pixels 
with which the text is created. When outputting to a laser printer or other 
PostScript device, anti-aliasing isn’t required. It is, however, critical 
when printing to an inkjet or when producing Web graphics. Generally, 
the choices here have little difference among them (other than None, of 
course). Smooth is a good choice unless your text begins to look blurry, 
in which case you should switch to Crisp. Use the Strong option with 
very large type when the individual character width must be preserved.
 
✓ Alignment: The three alignment choices on the Options bar determine 
how lines of type are positioned relative to each other. The buttons do 
a rather eloquent job of expressing themselves, wouldn’t you say? Note: 
Don’t confuse the term alignment with justification, which straightens 
both the left and right margins (and is selected in the Paragraph panel).
 
✓ Type Color: Click the color swatch on the Options bar to open the Color 
Picker and select a type color. You can select a color before adding text, 
or you can change the color of the text later. If you start by selecting a 
type layer from the Layers panel, you’ll change all the characters on that 
layer when you select a new color in the Color Picker. Alternatively, use 
a type tool to select one or more characters for a color change, as you 
can see in Figure 13-9.
Figure 13-8: Some fonts have many styles 
available.

274
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 13-9: Select any individual character and change its font, color, 
size, or any other attribute.
 
✓ Warp Text: Warp Text, which I discuss later in this chapter, bends the 
line of type according to any number of preset shapes, each of which 
can be customized with sliders. (The text in Figure 13-9 uses the Arc 
Lower warp style.) Keep in mind, however, that the Warp Text feature 
isn’t available when the Faux Bold style is applied through the Character 
panel. (I talk about faux styles later in this chapter.)
 
Each character in a type layer can have its own attributes. Click and drag 
over one or more characters with a type tool and then use the Options bar or 
Character panel to change the text attributes. Color, font, style — just about 
any attribute can be assigned, as you saw in Figure 13-9.
 
Like many word-processing programs, you can select an entire word in 
Photoshop by double-clicking the word (with a type tool). Triple-click to 
select the entire line. Quadruple-click to select the entire paragraph. Click 
five times very fast to select all the text.
Taking control of your text with panels
For incredible control over the appearance of your text, use the Character 
and Paragraph panels. In addition to all the text attributes available on the 
Options bar, the panels provide a wide range of choices. With them, you 
can customize the general appearance of the text or apply sophisticated 
typographic styling.

275
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
The Character and Paragraph panels can be shown and hidden by using the 
Panels button on the right end of the Type tools’ Options bars or through the 
Window menu. By default, the two panels are nested together, so choosing 
Window➪Character or Window➪Paragraph makes both panels available.
You can use the 
Character panel 
to edit a single 
selected character, 
a series of selected 
characters, or the 
entire content 
of a type layer. 
Figure 13-10 shows 
what you face 
when “building 
character” using 
this panel.
Unless you’re a typographer, a number of the fields in the Character panel 
might require explanation:
 
✓ Leading: Leading (pronounced LED-ding rather than LEED-ing and which 
refers to the lead strips of metal that typesetters used to place between 
lines of type) is the vertical space between lines of text. Generally, you’ll 
leave Leading set to Auto. However, you can select one or more lines of 
text (select the whole line) and change the spacing. Adding more space 
gives the text an airy, light appearance. Reducing the leading tightens up 
the text, which enables you to fit more lines in the same area.
 
✓ Kerning: The space between two characters is determined by the 
kerning built into a font. You can, however, override that spacing. Click 
with a type tool between two letters and then change the setting in the 
Kerning field to change the distance between the letters. You might, for 
example, want to reduce the kerning between a capital P and a lowercase 
o to tuck the second character protectively under the overhang of the 
taller letter. This can produce a cleaner and better-connected relationship 
between the two characters.
 
✓ Scaling: Vertical and horizontal scaling modifies the height and width of 
the selected character(s). You’ll find this useful primarily for customizing 
short bits of type rather than long chunks of text.
 
✓ Baseline Shift: Produce subscript and superscript characters, such 
as those used in H2O and E = mc2, with the Baseline Shift field. The 
Character panel’s Baseline Shift option is best used in conjunction with 
a slight reduction in the font size for the specific character(s).

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Faux Styles: Use faux styles to apply the appearance of a character 
style, even when they’re not built into the font. From the left, as the 
buttons show, the available faux styles are Bold, Italic, All Caps, Small 
Caps, Superscript, Subscript, Underline, and Strikethrough. Generally 
speaking, if a font offers a specific style in the Font Style menu, you’ll use 
the font’s built-in style rather than the faux style.
 
✓ Dictionary: Photoshop has more than three dozen dictionaries built in. 
And, wonderfully or confusingly depending on your personal linguistic 
talents, you can assign dictionaries on a word-by-word (or even character-
by-character) basis. You could, for example, insert a bon mot into the 
middle of your text in the language of your choice, assign the appropriate 
language dictionary, and not have that phrase trigger an alert when you 
run a spell check (Edit➪Check Spelling).
Type warping isn’t available when Faux Bold is applied to any of the selected 
characters. As warped as it might sound, that’s the only faux style that 
interferes with Warp Text.
 
If you click in your image window and start typing but no characters appear, 
check the Layers panel to make sure no layer is hiding your type layer and 
verify that your text color isn’t the same as the background over which 
you’re typing. If neither of those factors is the problem, it’s likely an invalid 
setting in the Character panel. Press the Escape key, and then right-click on 
the Type tool icon at the left end of the Options bar and select Reset Tool.
 
You’ll probably find yourself using certain sets of options pretty regularly in 
Photoshop. Luckily for you, you don’t need to make changes on the Options 
bar and Character panel every time you want (for example) Arial Bold, 24 pt, 
Sharp anti-aliasing, 22 pt leading, and tracking +10. Set up the options once and 
then click the Create New Tool Preset button in the panel at the left end of the 
Options bar, as shown in Figure 13-11. The next time that you want those specific 
text attributes, select the preset from that panel, and you’re ready to type!
Figure 13-11: Tool presets can save you lots of time.

 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
The Paragraph panel is used, not surprisingly, with paragraph type. The 
alignment options that you see in the upper left of the Paragraph panel 
in Figure 13-12 can be applied to both point type and type on a path, but 
you can usually access your alignment options much more easily from the 
Options bar.

Figure 13-12: Most of this panel is only for paragraph type.
 
I use the term type container when I discuss the Paragraph panel and 
paragraph type. Think of it as a rectangular column of text, with the words 
flowing from line to line, just as they do when you compose e-mail or use a 
word processor. You drag a type tool to create the rectangle, and then you 
type inside that rectangle. In contrast, when you simply click a type tool and 
start typing, you need to press Return (Mac) or Enter (Windows) at the end 
of each line.
You can find specific information about some of these options later in the 
chapter (when I discuss paragraph type), but here’s a quick look at the 
choices in the Paragraph panel:
 
✓ Alignment: As the text flows from line to line in your type container, 
the alignment option determines how the lines will stack. You can align 
the text for a straight left edge, a straight right edge, or you can have 
the lines stack centered upon each other. Which option is selected also 
determines where text will be placed in relationship to the point in the 
image where you click when adding point type.
 
✓ Justification: Unlike alignment, which balances lines of type based on a 
point of origin (left, center, or right), justification equalizes both the left 
and right margins of a paragraph of type. As you can see by the icons, 
the difference among the four options is the last line in the paragraph. 
That last line can be aligned left, centered, aligned right, or stretched to 
fit from left to right (called full justification).
 
✓ Indent Margins: Paragraphs of text can be indented from the left margin 
or the right. Even if you have only a single word selected, the entire 
paragraph is indented. Harkening back to that last term paper you 
wrote (whenever that might have been), think in terms of a block quote. 
You can also use negative numbers in the Indent Margin fields, which 
extends the paragraph beyond the margin.

278
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Indent First Line: You can indent the first line of your paragraphs (or 
extend the first line to the left past the margin with a negative value) 
without having to press the Tab key. The option can be set before you 
start adding text and is applied to each paragraph.
 
✓ Space Before/After: When your type container includes multiple 
paragraphs (created by pressing the Return/Enter key), you can specify 
the distance that’s automatically added between them. Rather than 
pressing the Return/Enter key an extra time between paragraphs, set the 
spacing in the Paragraph panel.
 
✓ Hyphenation: If you’re using justification rather than alignment, I 
recommend keeping the Hyphenate check box marked. When words at 
the ends of lines of justified type aren’t hyphenated, the spacing within 
the lines can get rather messy. If you don’t like the look of hyphens 
along the right margin, clear the Hyphenate check box.
 
Keep in mind that after you drag a type tool to create a type container, you 
can have as many paragraphs as fit. When you reach the end of a paragraph, 
press Return/Enter. A new paragraph is created within the type container. 
Consider the type container to be a column of text, such as you’d see in a 
newspaper, magazine, or newsletter.
The panel menus — even more options
Like most of Photoshop’s panels, clicking the menu button in the upper-right 
corner of the Character or Paragraph panel opens the Panel menu, which 
holds a cornucopia of options you probably never need to see. (Consider this: 
If it were a really important option, it would be easier to get to, wouldn’t it?)
As you can see in Figure 13-13, not all menu options are available for all fonts. 
Some of the options are merely command forms of the panel menus (such as 
the faux styles), and other options are specific to Japanese fonts. A number 
of the options apply only to OpenType fonts, which include a much larger 
selection of glyphs (characters) than do other fonts.
Here are a couple of panel menu options with which you should be familiar:
 
✓ Fractional Widths: When selected, Photoshop uses this option to adjust 
the spacing between letters on an individual basis. Will you or I spot 
the difference? Not with large type, but if you’re creating small text 
(especially for the Web), clear this option. How small is small? Generally 
10 pt or smaller.
 
✓ System Layout: Unless you need to match the appearance of text in 
TextEdit for Mac or Windows Notepad, leave this option deselected. 
When might you need it? When designing interface items for a program 
or game.

279
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
Figure 13-13: Not all options are used with all fonts.
 
✓ No Break: When working with paragraph type, you can select one or 
more words and choose No Break to prevent them from being hyphen-
ated. You might want to do this with words that are difficult to recognize 
when split between two lines.
 
✓ Roman Hanging Punctuation: Found on the Paragraph panel menu, 
this option permits the smaller punctuation marks located at the left 
and right margins of justified text to hang out past the margins. When 
commas and the like are outside the margin, the margin itself has a 
cleaner look. Don’t use this option if your layout can’t handle text that 
extends past the edges of your column.

280
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Adobe Composer: This choice is actually quite simple: Single-Line 
Composer looks at one line of type to determine hyphenation. Every-
Line Composer looks at the entire block of text, generally producing a 
more pleasing appearance.
 
✓ Reset (panel name): If you’re seeing some strange behavior from your 
type tools, you might want to invoke the Reset Character and Reset 
Paragraph commands. They restore the settings in their respective 
panels to the defaults, eliminating any errant setting that might be 
causing the problem.
 
Remember that you can right-click the tool icon at the left end of the Options 
bar and select Reset Tool (or Reset All Tools) to immediately return to the 
tool’s default settings. If the Type tool doesn’t seem to be working correctly, 
reset and then reselect your options.
Putting a picture in your text
Enough of that heavy stuff for now — time to take a look at one of the coolest 
things that you can do with text. Here’s an easy way to create a text-shaped 
picture, one that’s fully editable.
 
1. Using File➪Open, Adobe Bridge, or by double-clicking an image file, 
open a photo in Photoshop.
 
2. If the Layers panel has a layer named Background, double-click the 
layer name and rename the layer (as shown in Figure 13-14). If the 
image has multiple layers, choose Layer➪Merge Visible.
 
 You want to work with a single regular (not background) layer for this 
project. Background layers don’t support transparency, and no layers 
can be placed below a Background layer.
 
3. Add your type with the Horizontal Type tool.
 
4. Click the type layer in the Layers panel and drag it below the image 
layer.
 
5. In the Layers panel, Option+click (Mac) or Alt+click (Windows) the 
line between the two layers.
 
 The two layers are joined together, as shown in Figure 13-15. When you 
clip two layers, the lower layer serves as a mask for the upper layer. The 
upper layer is visible only where the lower layer has pixels and adopts 
the opacity of those lower-layer pixels.
 
6. Finish the image with a layer style (applied to the lower layer) and 
any other artwork that the project requires.

281
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
 
 You can click the lower layer in the Layers panel and then click a favor-
ite layer style in the Styles panel. Or, of course, you can create a custom 
layer style by choosing Layer➪Layer Style. In Figure 13-16, you see a 
stroke, a bevel, and a slight outer glow applied to the GARDENS layer.
Figure 13-14: Renaming a background layer converts it to a regular layer.

Creating Paragraphs with Type Containers
Although the vast majority of the text that you add to Photoshop artwork is 
point type — that is, type that exists on just one or a couple of lines — you’ll 
certainly find situations in which you need to use paragraph type in a type 
container. The primary advantage of using paragraph type is word wrap. 
While you type, the text automatically starts a new line every time it reaches 
the margin.
“Why is that a big deal?” you might ask. “I don’t mind pressing the Return or 
Enter key at the end of each line.” Ah, but consider the ever-present (when 
you type like me) typographical error! Or what if the very first sentence of 
your manual-Return paragraph is missing a word? To insert that word and 
maintain a visually pleasing right margin, you’d need to go back and redo 
every line of type. With paragraph type, the content of each line automatically 
adjusts as you insert that forgotten word.
 
The difference between point type to create a column of type and paragraph 
type is comparable with the difference between a typewriter and a word 
processor. (If you’re old enough to remember Wite-Out and Liquid Paper, 
raise your hand, but not for very long — I don’t want to tire you out.)
Adding a type container is simple. Click and drag with the Horizontal Type 
tool (or, in some rare cases, you might want to use the Vertical Type tool), 
and then start typing. The type automatically starts the next line as soon as 
you press enough keys to reach the far margin. You can keep typing until you 
fill the type container. Press Return or Enter whenever you want to start a 
new paragraph within your type container.

283
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
 
You can also copy/paste text from a word-processing or text-editing program. 
You can, for example, open a Microsoft Word document in Word, select the 
text that you want by clicking and dragging, and then choose Edit➪Copy to 
place the text into the computer’s memory (on the Clipboard). Switch to your 
Photoshop document; select a font, font size, and other attributes; drag a 
type container; and then choose Edit➪Paste (or the assigned keyboard 
shortcut) to place your text inside the container. When the text you need 
already exists, you not only save time by using copy/paste, but you also 
eliminate the possibility of introducing typos.
But what if you have more text than fits in the type container? Unlike Illustrator 
and InDesign, you can’t link two type containers, enabling the excess text to 
automatically move to the next container. Photoshop does, however, remind 
you that your text doesn’t fit by showing you a symbol in the lower-right 
corner of the type container’s bounding box — the dashed line surrounding 
the type container. As you can see in Figure 13-17, the lower-right anchor 
point of the bounding box has a plus sign in it.
Figure 13-17: A plus sign in the lower-right anchor point warns you that text doesn’t fit in the 
type container.

284
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
When you have more text than the type container can hold, you have a 
number of options:
 
✓ Enlarge the type container. Click one of the bounding box’s anchor 
points and drag to increase the size of the type container. Making a type 
container a little bit wider often gives you an extra line or two of text at 
the bottom.
 
✓ Shrink the font. Select the text with a keyboard shortcut (Ô+A/Ctrl+A) 
and select a smaller font size on the Options bar.
 
✓ Decrease the space between lines. Select the text and decrease the 
leading — the amount of space between lines of type — in the Leading 
field found in the upper right of the Character panel. By default (the 
Auto setting in the Leading field), Photoshop uses an amount equal to 
120 percent of the font size. You can often reduce the leading to 1 or 
2 pt larger than the font size before you start overlapping lowercase 
letters with descenders (g, j, p, q, and y) and uppercase letters on the 
line below.
 
✓ Edit the text. Rephrase the text, using fewer words to convey the same 
message. If you’re not the author, however, this option might not be 
available.
Selecting alignment or justification
Photoshop gives you several options for controlling the appearance of your 
margins. In the “Taking control of your text with panels” section earlier in 
this chapter, I outline a number of options that you can find on the Paragraph 
panel menu. But let me go into more detail about a couple of options that you 
have when adding paragraph type.
Perhaps the most important decision (other than font and font size) that you 
make when preparing paragraph type is a choice of alignment or justification. 
When text is aligned left, the left margin is perfectly straight, and the right 
margin is ragged, with each line ending where it ends, without any relationship 
to the lines of type above and below. A column of text that’s aligned right has 
a clean right margin and a ragged left margin. If you choose center aligned, 
the middle of each line of text is centered. Take a look at Figure 13-18 for a 
visual comparison.
Unlike alignment, justification gives you straight margins on both sides of 
the column of text. The four justification options at the top of the Paragraph 
panel differ only in how they treat the last line of a paragraph. As you can see 
from the Paragraph panel buttons, the last line can be independently aligned 
left, center, or right; or it can be fully justified, spreading the last line from 
margin to margin. You shouldn’t use the fourth option unless that last line 
(of every paragraph) is rather full because it looks rather strange when just a 
couple of words are stretched edge to edge.

285
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
Figure 13-18: Compare the left and right margins of each column of text.
Ready, BREAK! Hyphenating your text
When a word is too long to fit on the current line of text, either it can be moved 
to the beginning of the next line (wrapped), or it can be broken into two parts: 
one finishing the upper line and the other starting the next line (hyphenated).
 
The hyphenation options are for the truly geeky, my-typography-is-my-life types. 
The defaults are excellent and can suffice for all but the most precise layouts 
(which you should be doing in InDesign or perhaps Illustrator, anyway).
If you want to fine-tune how 
hyphenation is applied (or have 
far too much time on your hands), 
select Hyphenation from the 
Paragraph panel menu to open the 
options shown in Figure 13-19. The 
Hyphenation check box (upper left) 
activates/deactivates hyphenation. 
The top three fields govern which 
words to hyphenate and what limits 
to place on the hyphenation. (Think 
of the second and third fields as 
Hyphenate or cram into the line 
without hyphenating.) The lower two 
fields control the appearance of the margin, limiting the number of 
consecutive lines that can be hyphenated and the maximum distance from 
that margin that a hyphen can be placed.
Figure 13-19: Default hyphenation values give 
you good results and a pleasing appearance.

286
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Shaping Up Your Language with 
Warp Text and Type on a Path
You can change the line along which your type flows either by using the Warp Text 
feature or by typing on a path. Type warping uses predefined shapes to which 
your type is formed (and can be used with both point and paragraph type), 
and typing on a path uses a custom path (and is used only with point type).
Warping type and placing type along a path are great ways to spice up your 
message as long as you don’t overdo it and make the message illegible or 
distract from the overall appearance of your artwork. Warp Text is a quick 
and easy way to bend text, and placing type on a path is a more complex — 
and more controlled — technique.
Applying the predefined warps
With a type layer active in the Layers panel and a type tool selected, click the 
button to the right of the color swatch on the Options bar. That opens the 
Warp Text dialog box, as shown in Figure 13-20, in which you choose both 
the distortion you want to apply as well as the settings.
Figure 13-20: The illustration uses two separate type layers, each with its own Warp Text settings.

287
 Chapter 13: Giving Your Images a Text Message
Photoshop offers 15 different Warp Text presets, each of which you can 
customize by dragging any of three sliders. Negative numbers can be used, 
too, reversing the warp. You can also set the Bend slider to 0 and adjust the 
lower two sliders to create the appearance of depth or perspective for a type 
layer, but keep in mind that the Horizontal and Vertical buttons aren’t available 
for some of the styles. Warp Text is one of Photoshop’s truly fun features. 
The best way to become familiar with it is to open the dialog box and test-
drive each of the variations. And don’t forget to try the Horizontal and 
Vertical buttons when they’re available!
Customizing the course with paths
You can use the shape tools or the Pen tool to create a custom path along 
which you add your text. (You find full information about paths and shape 
layers in Chapter 11.) To add type along a path, simply select the Horizontal 
Type or Vertical Type tool, click the path, and type. The flow of the type from 
the point on the path where you click is determined by the alignment option 
that you select from the Options bar or the Paragraph panel. If the text is 
left-aligned, characters are added to the right of the point where you click 
(called the point of origin for the type). Left alignment is great when adding 
type along an open path, such as the upper path in Figure 13-21. You might, 
however, want to choose center alignment when adding type along the top 
of an arc or circle, so you can click on the top of the arc and not worry about 
dragging the type later to center it.
 
If you want type to go in two different directions — say, pointed upward 
along both the top and the bottom of a circle — you need to create two 
separate paths and two separate type layers, as shown in Figure 13-22.
After you add your type to the path, you can press the Ô/Ctrl key and 
reposition the type along the path by dragging. When you press and hold Ô/
Ctrl, the type tool’s cursor changes to an I-beam cursor with a heavy black 
arrow on either side, indicating which way you can drag the type. You see the 
type’s point of origin as a hollow diamond on the path (not to be confused 
with the hollow squares that represent the path’s anchor points). Figure 
13-23 gives you a zoomed-in look at the converted cursor and a comparison 
of the point of origin diamond and the anchor point square. Note, too, that 
not only can you drag type along a path, but you can also drag it across the 
path, flipping over the type.
 
After flipping type across a path, you might need to adjust the tracking (the 
space between characters), which is the second field from the top on the 
right in the Character panel. And don’t be afraid to click in the type and press 
the spacebar a few times to adjust the placement of words along the path.

A word about fonts
You already have a nice selection of fonts 
installed on your computer. Some are installed 
with the operating system (Windows or Mac), a 
number of fonts may have been installed with 
the Adobe Creative Suite, and other programs 
could have tossed more morsels into the stew. 
However, you might find that the more you work 
with text, the more you crave additional fonts.
Although having lots of fonts can stretch your 
options, too many fonts can lead to slowdowns 
and other problems. If you do find yourself 
someday with a massive collection of fonts 
(I have over 10,000 fonts), none of which you 
could bear to part with (okay, I could part with 
some of them), use a font management util-
ity. The Mac OS has the built-in Font Book, 
and Extensis (www.extensis.com) offers 
Suitcase Fusion 2 for Mac and Windows (about 
$100).

P
ainting. The word evokes images of brushes and palettes and color 
being precisely applied to canvas. Or, perhaps, images of drop cloths, 
ladders, rollers, and buckets — color being slopped on a wall and spread 
around. It doesn’t generally bring to mind digital image editing. But painting 
certainly has a place in your arsenal of Photoshop skills, even if you never 
create an image from scratch.
In addition to painting landscapes and portraits (which you 
certainly can do in Photoshop, if you have the talent and 
training), you can use Photoshop’s painting tools for 
a variety of other tasks. For example, you can paint 
to create masks and layer masks, adjust tonality or 
sharpness in specific areas, repair blemishes and 
other damage in an image — even to create graphic 
elements and special effects.
In this chapter, I concentrate on those editing-
related painting skills and give you a quick look 
at painting with the new Mixer Brush tool and the 
Airbrush option for the Brush tool. I introduce you to 
the basic concepts of painting in Photoshop and also 
walk you through the basic brush-related tools and the 
Brush panel, concentrating on those features that you most 
likely need (as well as a few of the other, more artistic features). 
To wrap up the chapter, I show you how to create custom brush tips and 
how to save them for future use.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Discovering Photoshop’s Painting Tools
Nothing in Photoshop gives you more precise control of color in your image 
than using the Pencil tool with a 1-pixel brush. Remember that your image 
consists of a whole lot of little colored squares (pixels) and that the color 
of those individual squares is what produces the appearance of a tree or a 
sunset or even good ol’ Uncle Bob. If you zoom in really close on an image, 
you can paint pixel by pixel — you could even create an entire image, one 
pixel at a time!
Whether you’re using a tiny brush 
with the Pencil tool or a larger 
one with the Brush tool, adding 
color to your image with the painting 
tools enables you to create beautiful 
or whimsical imagery, such as what’s 
shown in Figure 14-1 (with acknowl-
edgment to Picasso’s Woman with 
Pears).
As you work in Photoshop, however, 
you’ll find many very important roles 
for the brush-using tools other than 
creating imagery. From touching 
up dust and scratches in a scan to 
removing distant power lines from 
a photo to perhaps adding wispy 
hairs to soften the outline of a head, 
you have lots of reasons to paint in 
Photoshop (many of which you can 
read about in Chapters 9 and 10). 
When you’re capable and confident 
using the Brush tool, you might even 
find it the best way to make selec-
tions in your image. Selections with the Brush tool? That’s right — painting 
in an alpha channel creates or refines a saved selection. (You can read about 
alpha channels in Chapter 8.) Photoshop even has a brush-using tool that 
you can use to make selections directly. The Quick Selection tool, like the 
Magic Wand, selects areas of similar color. However, instead of Shift+clicking 
in a variety of areas with the Magic Wand to add to your initial selection, you 
simply drag the Quick Selection tool. The brush diameter, selected in the 
Options bar, tells Photoshop the size of the area you want to search for simi-
larly colored pixels.

another way to create in Photoshop.

 Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
You have 19 tools that use brushes available in Photoshop. Here’s a quick 
look at the various capabilities of those tools:
 
✓ Painting tools: The Brush, Pencil, and Mixer Brush tools (all discussed 
a bit later and in more depth) add the selected foreground color to the 
active layer as you click or drag the tool.
 
✓ Eraser tools: These tools (also discussed in more depth in pages to 
come) can make areas of a layer transparent or can paint over pixels 
with the current background color (if the layer doesn’t support 
transparency).
 
✓ Healing tools: The Spot Healing Brush and Healing Brush are designed 
to repair texture, like smoothing wrinkles or adding the appearance of 
canvas. With the Healing Brush, you designate a source point — an area 
from which you want to copy texture — by Option/Alt+clicking and then 
dragging over the target area. The Spot Healing Brush, on the other 
hand, automatically samples the texture around an area and makes the 
target area match its surroundings. With the new Content-Aware option, 
this tool can better match the healed area to the surrounding image. 
Quite cool!
 
✓ Color Replacement tool: Nested with the Brush and Pencil, the Color 
Replacement tool replaces the color over which you drag with the fore-
ground color. Remember that, by default, the Color Replacement tool 
alters only the color, not luminosity, so painting with black over pink 
gives you gray rather than black. From the Options bar, you can set 
the tool to change luminosity rather than color to darken or lighten, or 
choose to match hue or saturation.
 
✓ Stamp tools: The Clone Stamp tool, unlike the Color Replacement tool or 
the Healing Brush, doesn’t copy an attribute (such as color or texture), 
but actually copies pixels. It’s like having copy/paste in a brush. Option/
Alt+click a source area and then move the cursor and drag where you 
want to copy those pixels. It’s powerful! The Pattern Stamp tool paints 
with a selected pattern, using the blending mode and opacity that you 
designate in the Options bar. The Pattern Stamp tool is sometimes a 
good way to add texture selectively.
 
 When working with the Clone Stamp tool and the Clone Source panel, 
you can specify and move between up to five different source points. 
You also have the option of showing an overlay, which lets you see in 
advance what dragging the tool will do to your artwork.
 
✓ History brushes: The History Brush, discussed in Chapter 1, allows you 
to paint areas of the image to restore them to a previous state in the 
development process. Nested with the History Brush, the Art History 
Brush uses the history state selected in the History panel to add an 
Impressionist look where you paint.

294
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Focus tools: The Blur and Sharpen tools do just what their names say, 
but you’ll likely find the default 50% Strength to be way too powerful for 
most jobs. Selective sharpening can help bring out details and direct 
attention in an image. Likewise, selective blurring can hide minor defects 
and help direct the viewer’s eye toward areas of sharpness in the image. 
If you have avoided the Sharpen tool in the past, give it another chance 
using the new Protect Detail option.
 
 Tucked in with the focus tools is the Smudge tool. Click and drag to 
smear pixels along the path. (I find the Smudge tool especially useful 
for dragging out wispy hairs from heads that appear perhaps too well 
defined and smooth.)
 
✓ Toning tools: The Dodge tool lightens, the Burn tool darkens — and if 
you use the defaults, they do it too much! When using these tools to 
adjust luminosity in your image, it’s best to start with an Exposure set-
ting of about 15% and paint carefully, perhaps repeatedly, rather than 
making a huge change with Exposure set to 50%.
 
 The Sponge tool is nested with the Dodge and Burn tools. Use it to 
either increase or decrease saturation as you drag. (Decreasing satura-
tion with the Sponge tool is a great way to create an image that’s par-
tially grayscale.)
The Healing Brush and the Clone Stamp tool have a button to the right of the 
Sample menu in the Options bar. When the Sample pop-up menu is set to All 
Layers or the new Current & Below option, that button gives you the option 
of ignoring adjustment layers. You might want to use this option if, for exam-
ple, you’re cloning or healing from multiple layers below an adjustment layer 
to a new layer that itself would be affected by the adjustment layer. This pre-
vents the adjustment from being applied twice.
Painting with the Brush tool
You control where the Brush tool 
works by selecting a brush tip of a 
particular size, shape, and hardness 
(the fuzziness, or lack thereof, along 
the edges of a round brush tip). 
Remember, too, that you can use 
the Brush and other painting tools 
to create subtle changes in existing 
colors. By selecting an appropriate 
blending mode and opacity, you can 
mix the painting color into the exist-
ing colors in your image. Make these 
basic decisions from the Options 
bar, shown for the Brush tool in 
Figure 14-2.
Figure 14-2: Make the primary decisions about 
painting tool behavior from the Options bar.

295
 Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
As you see in Figure 14-2, the Options bar gives you access to a miniature 
Brush panel, from which you can pick a brush tip, change its size, and adjust 
the hardness of the brush’s edges. (Only round brush tips use the Hardness 
adjustment.) The five sample lines to the right show Hardness, from 0% to 
100% in 25% increments, all using a 40-pixel brush. The Brush tool can use 
any brush tip that you have in the Brush panel — and, as you can read later 
in this chapter, you can customize the brush tip in a variety of ways.
You’re actually ready to paint in Photoshop already! Select a foreground 
color, select the brush size that you want, decide how hard or fuzzy the 
edges should be, change the blending mode and opacity (if desired), and 
drag the tool in your image. (And, perhaps best of all, no turpentine needed 
for cleaning up — just switch tools in the Toolbox.)
 
As you work with the brush-using tools, always remember that the selected 
brush tip is applied as a series of individual impressions, called instances. 
Consider an instance to be a single impression of the brush tip, like tapping 
a pen once on a piece of paper — it leaves a single dot. Take a look at the 
outer borders in Figure 14-3. Changing the brush tip’s Spacing value (in the 
main Brush panel, opened through Photoshop’s Window menu) shows how 
instances appear. In the upper left, the spacing is set to the default 25% and 
a continuous line results. To the upper right, Spacing is set to 67%, and the 
individual brush tip instances are visible as overlapping circles. To the lower 
left, Spacing is set to 133% — this is a setting that you might use for a dotted 
or dashed line — and each brush tip instance is visible individually.
 
If you know you have the cursor set to show the brush tip, but you’re seeing 
the tiny little crosshairs instead, check the Caps Lock key on your keyboard. 
Caps Lock toggles between precise and brush-size cursors for the brush-
using tools. (During the discussion of Photoshop’s Preferences in Chapter 3, I 
showed a comparison of the three brush cursor options in Figure 3-13.)
When you change the Brush tool’s Opacity setting on the Options bar, you 
change the appearance of the stroke as a whole. Changing the Flow setting 
(also on the Options bar), on the other hand, changes the amount of color 
applied with each instance of the brush tip. When the flow is reduced and the 
spacing is set to less than 100%, the overlapping area of each brush instance 
appears darker (or lighter when painting with, for example, white on black). 
One last option for the Brush tool deserves a quick look. To the right of the 
Flow field is the Airbrush button. When the Airbrush is on (the button turns 
dark), the Flow value takes on more meaning. As you paint with the Brush 
in Airbrush mode with a reduced Flow setting, pausing the cursor with the 
mouse button down allows color to build up (become more opaque) as if you 
were using a real airbrush. You can use the Airbrush both as a traditional air-
brush artist and to simulate spray paint. You can see both in Figure 14-4.

 Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
If your computer has a processor and video card that support OpenGL draw-
ing, you can rotate the image on screen for easier painting. Not rotate the 
canvas, but rotate the on-screen image! As you see in Figure 14-5, this can be 
great for fine-tuning a layer mask or doing other delicate painting tasks. Using 
the Rotate View tool (nested with the Hand tool) permits you to arrange the 
artwork for your most comfortable painting stroke. While dragging the Rotate 
View tool, the on-screen compass’s red arrow always orients you to the top 
of the screen. When you want the image oriented back to the top, simply 
double-click on the Rotate View tool icon in the Tool panel.
Figure 14-5: Rotating the on-screen view can make painting much 
easier and more precise.
Fine art painting with the Mixer Brush
 
New in Photoshop is the Mixer Brush, a tool designed to give traditionally-
trained artists a more familiar feel. Best used with a Wacom tablet or Cintiq 
and a stylus (see Chapter 19), this tool takes painting several steps forward. 
The bristle tips available for the Mixer Brush are designed to work more like 
the physical brushes used to add physical paint to physical canvas, but in 
a digital sort of way. (The bristle tips can be used with other painting tools, 
but they pretty much behave like the static tips, the brush tips normally used 
with the other tools.)

298
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
The Mixer Brush can apply the foreground color interactively with pixels 
already on the active layer. Using a “wet” brush (selected in the Options bar) 
liquefies or melts the existing colors on the layer, pulling them along (with 
the foreground color) as you drag the tool. To minimize interaction with 
existing colors, use a “dry” brush or add a layer and paint on the new layer. 
For a comparison of brushes using the wet (upper stroke) and dry (lower 
stroke) options, as well as a look at the Mixer Brush Options bar and the new 
Brush Presets panel, see Figure 14-6.
Figure 14-6: The Mixer Brush’s Brush preview in the upper-left can be shown/hidden through 
the View➪Show menu.
Some of the options for the Mixer Brush (from the left in Figure 14-6) deserve 
explanation:
 
✓ To the right of the standard tool preset and mini-Brush panel, the color 
swatch represents the current brush load, the paint on the brush. 
Clicking on the swatch opens the Color Picker; clicking the triangle to 
the right of the swatch provides an easy way to clean the brush (so that 
it interacts only with existing colors on the layer) or to reload the brush 
(add color to the mix).

299
 Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
 
✓ The two buttons to the right of the color swatch can be used to auto-
matically reload the tool after each stroke and to automatically clean the 
brush after each stroke. The two buttons can be used together.
 
✓ The pop-up menu to the right of the Auto-Load and Auto-Clean buttons 
provides a list of dry, moist, wet, and very wet presets from which to 
choose.
 
✓ The Wet field controls how the brush interacts with color already on the 
layer. The wetter the brush, the more it picks up color (and blends with 
the current brush load) on the layer. A low value overlays the load color 
without mixing in the existing colors.
 
✓ The Load field controls how much “paint” is added to the brush. With a 
low value, the color runs out quickly and strokes are short. With a high 
value, the strokes continue to add color. The load settings are most 
apparent when using a dry brush.
 
✓ The Mix field also contributes to how the load color and existing color 
on the layer interact. A low value uses lots of the load color, whereas 
a high value uses more of the color already on the layer. Mix isn’t used 
with dry brushes (because they don’t interact with the existing colors).
 
✓ The Flow field is yet another variable for the amount of color added 
by the Mixer Brush. Low values result in a more transparent stroke, 
whereas very high values produce opaque strokes (which tend to be 
shorter because the brush, you might say, “runs out” of paint).
 
The Mixer Brush can also interact with strokes applied by the Brush and 
Pencil tools. And as you fine-tune your masterpiece, remember that you 
can push this paint around with the Smudge tool and use the Blur, Sharpen, 
Dodge, Burn, and Sponge tools, too.
Sometime when you need a break, open a new empty document, select the 
Mixer Brush, and explore your inner Rembrandt (or Salvador Dali, perhaps).
Adding color with the Pencil tool
The Pencil tool differs from the Brush tool in one major respect: Regardless 
of the Hardness setting in the Brush panel, the Pencil tool always uses a hard-
ness value of 100%. With the Pencil tool active, the Options bar offers the 
miniature Brush panel, choice of blending mode and opacity, and the some-
what-misnamed Auto Erase option. When selected, Auto Erase lets you paint 
over areas of the current foreground color using the current background 
color. Click an area of the foreground color, and the Pencil applies the back-
ground color. Click any color other than the foreground color, and the Pencil 
applies the foreground color. But remember, you’re not erasing, just painting 
with the background color (even on layers with transparency).

300
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Removing color with the Eraser tool
The fourth of your primary painting tools is the Eraser. On a layer that sup-
ports transparency, the Eraser tool makes the pixels transparent. On a layer 
named Background, the Eraser paints with the background color. On the 
Options bar, the Eraser tool’s Mode menu doesn’t offer blending modes, 
but rather three behavior choices. When you select Brush (the default), the 
Options bar offers you the same Opacity, Flow, and Airbrush options as the 
Brush tool. You can also select Pencil, which offers an Opacity slider, but no 
Flow or Airbrush option (comparable to the actual Pencil tool). When Mode 
is set to Block, you have a square Eraser tool that erases at the size of the 
cursor. Regardless of which mode is selected, the Options bar offers one 
more important choice: To the right of the Airbrush button, you’ll find the 
Erase to History check box. When selected, the Eraser tool paints over the 
pixels like the History Brush, restoring the pixels to their appearance at the 
selected state in the History panel.
A couple of variations on the Eraser tool are tucked away with it in the 
Toolbox, too. The Background Eraser tool can, in fact, be used to remove 
a background from your image. However, it’s not limited to something in 
your image that appears to be a background. Remember that digital images 
don’t really have backgrounds and foregrounds or subjects — they just 
have collections of tiny, colored squares. What does this mean for using 
the Background Eraser? You can click and drag on any color in the image to 
erase areas of that color. You can also elect to erase only the current back-
ground color and designate the foreground color as protected so that it won’t 
be erased even if you drag over it.
The Magic Eraser, like the Magic Wand selection tool (see Chapter 8), isn’t a 
brush-using tool, but this is a logical place to tell you about it. Click a color 
with the Magic Eraser tool, and that color is erased, either in a contiguous 
area or throughout the image, depending on whether you have selected the 
Contiguous option in the Options bar. And, like the Magic Wand, you can set 
the tool to work on the active layer or all layers in the Options bar, and you 
can also set a specific level of sensitivity (Tolerance). Here is the one differ-
ence between the two: The Magic Eraser is, in fact, a painting tool in that you 
can set an opacity percentage, which partially erases the selected pixels.
Picking a color
If you want to apply a specific color to your image with a painting tool, you 
have to be able to select that color, right? Photoshop provides you with a 
number of ways to select a color:
 
✓ Click a saved color swatch in the Swatches panel.
 
✓ Enter numeric values or drag sliders in the Color panel.

301
 Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
 
✓ Click a color swatch at the bottom of the Toolbox or in the Color panel 
to open the Color Picker.
 
✓ Select the Eyedropper tool and click any color already in your image. 
Heck, click in your image with the Eyedropper tool, hold the mouse 
button down, and drag to any color anywhere on your screen — that 
color doesn’t even have to be in Photoshop!
 
The Eyedropper’s Options bar now offers the option Show Sampling Ring. 
When active and the Eyedropper is in use, the Sampling Ring is a pair of con-
centric circles (as shown to the right in Figure 14-7). The outer ring is neutral 
gray to isolate the inner ring from surrounding colors. The bottom half of the 
inner ring shows the current foreground color, whereas the top half shows 
the color over which you have dragged the cursor. If you find it distracting, 
disable it in the Options bar.
Figure 14-7: Use the Color Picker to define colors with precision. The Eyedropper’s Sampling 
Ring is visible to the right.

302
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
In both the Toolbox and the Color panel, the foreground color is shown in 
the swatch to the upper left, and the background swatch is partially hidden 
behind it. Swap the foreground and background colors by pressing the X key 
on your keyboard. Reset them to the default black and white by pressing the 
D key.
In Chapter 6, I introduce the Color panel and the various ways you can define 
color with it. Now take a look at the Color panel’s big brother, the Color 
Picker (see Figure 14-7). Note the reminder in the title bar of the Color Picker 
window that tells you whether you’re changing the foreground or back-
ground color. (If you find that you’re changing the background color when 
you want to change the foreground color, exit the Color Picker, open the 
Color panel, and click the foreground swatch.) The best way to get a feel for 
the incredible versatility of the Color Picker is to open it (click a color swatch 
at the bottom of the Toolbox or in the Color panel) and click each of the 
buttons to the left of the numeric fields. Each option changes how the Color 
Picker appears as well as how it defines color.
The default Color Picker configuration uses the radio button to the left of 
the H (Hue) field. It presents you with a vertical rainbow slider (the hue) and 
a square area that defines saturation (left-right) and brightness (up-down). 
Click or drag in the square area to the left and drag the slider up and down 
to pick a color. (Compare the two swatches to the left of the Cancel button 
to see the new color above the previously selected color.) If you click the 
button to the left of the S field, the slider shows saturation, and hue and 
brightness are defined in the square area to the left. Starting to see the pat-
tern? Check out the configuration for Brightness (B) as well as the RGB and 
Lab options. And note that you can type numeric values to define a color as 
CMYK, but there are no buttons to the left to reconfigure the Color Picker. 
Likewise, you can type in the # (hexadecimal) field below the B field, but you 
can’t use it to reconfigure the Color Picker. (Hexadecimal color definition is 
used with HyperText Markup Language [HTML] code in Web pages.)
Between the two color swatches in the top center and the buttons to the 
right are a pair of little icons that aren’t always visible. (Check them out in 
Figure 14-7 if they’re not currently showing in your Color Picker.) The top 
warning triangle tells you that the current color can’t be reproduced within 
your working CMYK color profile. Unless you’re preparing artwork for a com-
mercial offset press, ignore it — it has nothing to do with your inkjet printer, 
for example. If, on the other hand, you are working on a press-destined proj-
ect, click the swatch just below the warning triangle to jump to the nearest 
reproducible color.

303
 Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
The lower icon, a little cube symbol, lets you know that your current color 
isn’t Web safe. Web-safe colors are the couple hundred colors that are exactly 
the same in the base color scheme for both Mac and Windows. If visitors to 
your Web site have their monitors — or PDAs — set to show only 256 colors, 
everyone sees the same thing with Web-safe colors. Generally, you can safely 
ignore the warning because the variation isn’t worth worrying about. (If you 
do want to work with Web-safe colors, click the swatch below the warning 
cube icon and then mark the Only Web Colors check box in the lower left.)
After you define a custom color with the numeric fields or by clicking in the 
sample colors to the left, you can easily save the color to the Swatches panel 
by clicking the Add to Swatches button. Should you need to reselect that spe-
cific color later, or even when working on another image, it’s right there in 
the Swatches panel, exactly as originally defined.
Also note the Color Libraries button. 
Clicking that button swaps the 
Color Picker for the Color Libraries 
dialog box (as shown in Figure 
14-8), in which you can select spot 
colors. Spot colors, which I explain 
in Chapter 6, are special premixed 
inks that can be specially requested 
when preparing a job for a commer-
cial printing press. Adding a spot 
color ensures that the color will 
appear in the final product exactly 
as expected. However, because 
they generally require an extra pass 
through a press, adding spot colors 
increases the cost of your printing. (Remember that if you want the color to 
print as a spot color, you don’t paint with it, but rather create a spot channel 
to identify where the spot color appears in your artwork.) Spot colors can be 
used to define colors for nonpress jobs, but the color is converted to your 
working color mode and printed with a mixture of your regular inks. Return 
to the Color Picker from Color Libraries by clicking the Picker button.
Filling, stroking, and dumping to add color
You have several more ways to add color to your artwork, none of which use 
brushes at all. You can, for example, make a selection and fill the selection 
with color via the Edit➪Fill command, or you can add a band of color along 
the edge of the selection with the Edit➪Stroke command (using the dialog 
boxes shown to the right in Figure 14-9). 
Figure 14-8: Choose custom spot colors in 
Color Libraries.

304
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 14-9: Photoshop offers several non-brush ways to add color to your images.
 
The first time you use the Delete/Backspace key in Photoshop CS5, be pre-
pared for a surprise. Rather than simply filling with the current background 
color, the keystroke opens the Fill dialog box. One of the great new improve-
ments in Photoshop is the Content-Aware fill. The Content-Aware option is 
sort of a “smart fill.” The area surrounding the current selection is analyzed 
and Photoshop fills to match that surrounding area as seamlessly as possi-
ble. If you simply want to delete to the current background color, hold down 
the Ô/Ctrl key and press Delete/Backspace. You can also fill with the current 
foreground color by using Option/Alt with Delete/Backspace.
You can also “dump” color into your image with the Paint Bucket tool, nested 
below the Gradient tool in the Toolbox. Use the Paint Bucket to fill an empty 
selection with color or to replace the color on which you click with the fore-
ground color. Don’t forget shape layers, either! They’re a great way to add 
perfectly defined areas of solid color to an image. (You can read about work-
ing with shape layers in Chapter 11.)

305
 Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
Using gradients
You can add gradients, which are subtle blends of color, quite easily to your 
artwork:
 
1. Make a selection.
 
 Unless you make a selection first, the gradient fills your entire layer. If 
you want the gradient to fill the entire layer, don’t make a selection first.
 
2. Select the Gradient tool.
 
 Click the Gradient tool in the Toolbox. If you don’t see it, look for it 
nested with the Paint Bucket tool.
 
3. Select a gradient.
 
 You can open the Gradient panel by clicking the triangle to the right of 
the sample gradient on the Options bar (see Figure 14-10). You can also 
click the sample gradient directly to open the Gradient Editor.
 
4. Choose a shape.
 
 The five buttons to the right of the sample gradient on the Options bar 
show you the shapes available for the Gradient tool. (From the left, the 
buttons are Linear, Radial, Angle, Reflected, and Diamond.)
 
5. Choose additional options.
 
 You can pick a blending mode and opacity, flip the colors in the gradient 
with the Reverse option, choose Dither to help disguise the transitions 
between colors, and select the Transparency option to preserve any 
transparency defined in the gradient.
 
6. Drag the Gradient tool.
 
 Where you start and in which direction you drag ultimately determine 
the appearance of the gradient.
The background gradient in Figure 14-10 uses the Angle Gradient option on 
the Options bar and the gradient that you see in the Gradient Editor. Notice 
in the Gradient Editor the Opacity stops (above the sample being edited) and 
Color stops (below the sample). The stops — the squares with points posi-
tioned along the sample gradient — determine the color or opacity of the 
gradient at that particular point. By default, there’s a smooth and even blend 
between neighboring stops, but you can adjust the blend by dragging the 
small diamonds you see on either side of the opacity and color stops. (Hint: 
The active stops use filled triangles instead of hollow triangles with their 
little squares.)

Figure 14-10: Control gradients with the Options bar, Gradient panel, and Gradient Editor.
Click anywhere along the top (opacity) or bottom (color) of the gradient to 
add a new stop. Drag stops to move them. Option/Alt+drag a stop to dupli-
cate it. Change the attributes of the selected stop with the options just below 
in the Gradient Editor.
 
After designing your new gradient, remember to click the New button to add 
it to the Gradient panel. But keep in mind that custom gradients aren’t really 
saved until you use the Save button or the Preset Manager to create sets on 
your hard drive. If you don’t save your custom gradients, they’ll be gone if 
you need to reset Photoshop’s Preferences file (see Chapter 3).
Browsing the Brush and Brush Presets Panels
 
Photoshop’s old Brushes panel has been split into two new panels, the Brush 
panel and the Brush Presets panel (as shown in Figure 14-11). Select a brush 
tip in the Brush Presets panel (or in the Options bar), and then customize it 
to do your bidding using the options in the Brush panel.

307
 Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
 
You must have a brush-
using tool active to 
access the Brush panel. 
If the active tool doesn’t 
use brushes, the entire 
panel is grayed out and 
unavailable. If that’s the 
case, simply press B on 
the keyboard to activate 
the Brush tool.
An overview 
of options
The Brush panel, like the 
Layer Style dialog box, 
has a column on the left 
that lists options. Like the 
Layer Style dialog box, you mark the check box to activate the feature, but 
you have to click the name to open that pane in the panel. As you can see in 
Figure 14-11, the Brush panel menu offers very few commands, whereas the 
Brush Presets panel menu includes variations in how to display the panel 
content, some housekeeping commands for resetting/loading/saving brushes, 
and a list of brush sets in the bottom half of the menu.
Don’t overlook those little lock icons to the right of the various pane names 
in the Brush panel. Click the lock to preserve the settings in that pane while 
you switch among brush tip presets. Any unlocked attributes revert to those 
with which the brush tip was created. Locking, for example, Shape Dynamics 
retains those settings even if you switch to a totally different brush tip.
Here, in order, are the Brush panel panes and the options in those panes to 
which you should pay attention:
 
✓ Brush Presets: This button opens the Brush Presets panel, where you 
pick the basic brush tip shape from the brushes loaded in the panel. You 
can also resize the brush tip, but that’s it. (Note that you can also select 
a brush tip in the Brush Tip Shape panel of the Brush panel.)
 
✓ Brush Tip Shape: Without a check box to the left or a lock icon to the 
right, Brush Tip Shape is the pane in which you can select and custom-
ize a brush tip. (Refer to the Brush Tip Shape pane in Figure 14-11.) This 
is perhaps the most important part of the Brush panel. In this pane, 
you can select a brush tip, change its size, alter the angle at which it’s 
applied, change the height-width relationship (Roundness) of the tip, 
and adjust the Spacing setting.
Figure 14-11: The Brush and Brush Presets panels, with their 
panel menus, provide lots of options.

308
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
✓ Shape Dynamics: Dynamics in the Brush panel add variation as you drag 
a tool. Say you’re working with a round brush tip and choose Size Jitter. 
As you drag the brush tip, the brush tip instances (the individual marks 
left by the brush as you drag) will vary in diameter. The Shape Dynamics 
pane offers Size Jitter, Angle Jitter, and Roundness Jitter. Each of the 
“jitters” can be set to fade after a certain number of brush tip instances 
or can be controlled with the stylus that you use with a Wacom tablet. 
Angle can also be set to Direction, which forces the brush tip to adjust 
the direction that you drag or the direction of the selection or path you 
stroke. Use Shape Dynamics to add some variation and randomness to 
your painting, as shown in Figure 14-12.
Figure 14-12: Use jitter to add variation to the application of your selected brush tip.
 
✓ Scattering: Scattering varies the number of brush tip instances as you 
drag as well as their placement along the path you drag. Like the shape 
dynamics, scattering can be set to fade or can be controlled with a 
Wacom tablet.
 
✓ Texture: Use the Texture pane to add a pattern to the brush tip, as 
shown in Figure 14-12. You can select from among the same patterns 
that you use to fill a selection. Texture is most evident when Spacing for 
the brush tip is set to at least 50%.
 
✓ Dual Brush: Using a blending mode you select, the Dual Brush option 
overlays a second brush tip. You could, for example, add an irregular 
scatter brush to a round brush tip to break up the outline as you paint.

309
 Chapter 14: Painting in Photoshop
 
✓ Color Dynamics: Using the Color Dynamics pane, you can vary the 
color of your stroke as you drag. This comes in most handy for paint-
ing images and scenes rather than, say, working on an alpha channel. 
Just as you might add jitter to the size, shape, and placement of a grass 
brush while creating a meadow, you might also want to add some dif-
ferences in color as you drag. You could pick different shades of green 
for the foreground and background colors and then also add jitter to 
the hue, saturation, and brightness values as the foreground and back-
ground colors are mixed while you drag.
 
✓ Transfer: Think of this pane as Opacity and Flow Jitter. You can add 
variation to the opacity and flow settings from the Options bar to 
change the way paint “builds up” in your artwork.
 
✓ Other Options: At the bottom of the left column are five brush options 
that don’t have separate panes in the Brush panel. They’re take-it-or-
leave-it options — either activated or not.
 
• Noise: Adding Noise to the brush stroke helps produce some tex-
ture and breaks up solid areas of color in your stroke.
 
• Wet Edges: Wet Edges simulates paint building up along the edges 
of your stroke.
 
• Airbrush: The Airbrush check box simply duplicates the button on 
the Options bar.
 
• Smoothing: Smoothing helps reduce sharp angles as you drag your 
mouse or stylus. If the stroke you’re painting should indeed have 
jagged turns and angles, disable Smoothing.
 
• Protect Texture: The Protect Texture option ensures that all the 
brushes with a defined texture use the same texture. Use this 
option when you want to simulate painting on canvas, for example.
 
When creating a dashed line or stroking a path with a non-round brush tip, 
go to the Shape Dynamics pane of the Brush panel and set the Angle Jitter’s 
Control pop-up menu to Direction. That enables the brush tip to rotate as 
necessary to follow the twists and turns of the selection or path that it’s 
stroking. (You’ll generally want to leave Angle Jitter set to 0% so that the 
stroke follows the selection or path precisely.)
Creating and saving custom brush tips
You can use any artwork as a custom brush tip — you can even make a brush 
tip from your own face! With the artwork on a transparent or white back-
ground (you don’t even need to make a selection), choose Edit➪Define Brush 
Preset. Type a name (see Figure 14-13) and click OK. Your new custom brush 
is added to the Brush panel. After you define a piece of artwork as a brush, 
you can add that image to any project with a single click or drag.

310
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
 
As soon as you define your custom 
brush, open the Brush panel, select 
the new brush, and set Spacing 
and any other options that you’ll 
generally want to use with the new 
brush. Then from the Brush panel 
menu, choose the New Brush Preset 
command, and resave your custom 
brush. Now when you select your 
custom brush, you have your pre-
ferred settings all ready to go!
 
Keep in mind these things when cre-
ating custom brushes:
 
✓ All brushes are grayscale. 
Regardless of the color in the 
artwork that you use to create 
your new brush, the brush itself 
is saved as a grayscale repre-
sentation of the art.
 
✓ The maximum size for a brush is 2,500 pixels. If you, for example, scan 
your signature to use in a custom copyright notice for your images and 
Define Brush Preset is grayed out, reduce the pixel dimensions with the 
Image➪Image Size command.
 
✓ Only one color is painted. Again, the brush is grayscale: It applies the 
foreground color in tints to match the grays in the brush tip (unless, of 
course, you use the Color Dynamics option in the Brush panel).
 
✓ Your art might need more contrast. You might want to convert a copy 
of your original to grayscale to see whether it wouldn’t benefit from a 
Levels adjustment to boost the contrast. Higher contrast often makes for 
better brush tips.
 
✓ Remember to save your custom brushes! Once again (and you’ll prob-
ably read this sort of reminder a few more times elsewhere in this book), 
your custom brushes aren’t really saved until you use the Brush panel 
menu command Save Brushes to make a new set of all the brushes cur-
rently in the panel or until you choose Edit➪Preset Manager to make a 
new set of only the brushes you select.
Figure 14-13: Define the new brush preset, set 
your options in the Brush panel, and resave.

Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out about Smart Filters
▶ Being productive with “fix it” filters
▶ Getting artsy with creative filters
▶ Adding wackiness (and precise correction) with Liquify
▶ Taking a quick look at the specialized filters
T
he Photoshop Filter menu includes more than 100 commands that you 
can use to fix, flatter, finesse, and freak out your photos. You can use 
most of the filters on most of your artwork and some of the filters on some of 
your artwork, and you probably won’t ever use quite a few of the filters.
In this chapter, I start you off with a discussion of the Smart Filters 
feature, something you should get used to using just about 
every time you apply a filter. Next, you get a look at what I 
call the “production” filters: namely, the key filters you 
use to improve or repair your images. Following that, 
I show you the basics of two of the most fun features 
in all of Photoshop: the Filter Gallery and Liquify. Not 
only are they fun, but you can use them to do won-
drous things to your artwork. I wrap up the chapter 
with a look at several other key filters.
Smart Filters: Your Creative 
Insurance Policy
One of the most important concepts to keep in mind when work-
ing with filters is Smart Filters. When you apply a filter to a pixel layer, 
that’s it — the pixels are changed. But, when you apply a filter to a Smart 
Object, you create a Smart Filter. With Smart Filters, you can apply one 
or more filters to a Smart Object and later change your mind about what 
settings — or even what filters — to use, without reverting to a saved copy 
of the file or using the History panel. Unlike adjustment layers, which are, in 

312
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
fact, separate layers in the image, Smart Filters work more like layer styles. They 
appear in the Layers panel below the layer to which they’re applied and can be 
shown or hidden by clicking an eyeball icon (see Figure 15-1). And, like layer 
styles, you can reopen a Smart Filter by double-clicking it in the Layers panel.
Figure 15-1: Smart Filters are more like layer styles than adjustment layers.
As you can see in Figure 15-1, the layer Inside Passage-02 (the active layer, 
highlighted in the Layers panel) has both layer effects and Smart Filters 
applied. The type layer above has only layer effects, whereas the other two 
Smart Objects, below in the Layers panel, have Smart Filters but no layer 
effects. Clicking the triangle to the far right of a layer name expands and 
collapses the list of effects and filters applied. Clicking the eyeball icon to 
the left of an item hides it without removing it. You can delete a Smart Filter 
by dragging it to the Trash icon (just as you can with layer effects), which 
removes its effect from the layer. To reopen a filter’s dialog box to change 
settings, simply double-click the filter name in the Layers panel.
 
Smart Filters can be applied only to Smart Objects (which are discussed in 
Chapter 10). Luckily, you can convert any pixel-based layer, even a back-
ground layer, to a Smart Object simply by selecting that layer in the Layers 
panel and choosing Layer➪Smart Objects➪Convert to Smart Object. You 
can even select multiple layers in the Layers panel and create a single Smart 

313
 Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
Object with that command. You can then apply a Smart Filter to all of the 
layers in the Smart Object.
Because you can easily remove or change Smart Filters, they provide you 
with a special sort of creative license: the license to experiment and change 
your mind. Because they are nondestructive (they don’t make permanent 
changes to the pixels in your image), you can use Smart Filters without fear 
of damaging your image. Of course that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t work on 
a copy of your beautiful photo — it’s always better to safeguard the original 
image file and work on a duplicate.
The Filters You Really Need
Photoshop has several filters that you can use on just about any image to 
improve or finesse it. Most photos, for example, benefit from at least a little 
bit of sharpening to improve the detail in the image. In some cases, you want 
to decrease the visible detail in an image in some areas to hide defects, or 
perhaps you want to blur a background to draw more attention to the subject 
of your shot. And Photoshop has a couple of filters that you’ll find handy for 
correcting lens distortion and reducing noise (specks of red, green, and blue) 
in digital photos.
 
Some filters aren’t available for images in 16-bit color and some aren’t avail-
able when you’re working in CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/black) color mode. 
All the filters are available for 8-bit RGB and grayscale images. (No filters are 
available for GIF or PNG-8 images, which use Indexed Color mode.) And keep 
in mind that you can apply filters to specific areas of an image by making a 
selection first. (See Chapter 8 for info on selections and masks.) If you need 
to use a filter and it’s grayed out, head to Image➪Mode and convert to 8-bit/
Channel RGB mode.
 
You can instantly reapply the last used filter exactly as it was applied with 
the keyboard shortcut Ô+F (Mac)/Ctrl+F (Windows). If you’d like to reopen 
that last-used filter’s dialog box to change settings before reapplying, press 
Option+Ô+F/Alt+Ctrl+F.
Sharpening to focus the eye
When looking at an image, your eye is naturally drawn to certain areas first. 
You generally look at bright areas before dark areas and areas of detail 
before smoother areas in the image. Compare, for example, the three photos 
in Figure 15-2 (which were taken using different focal lengths and lens aper-
tures). Using Photoshop’s sharpen and blur filters enables you to control 
the amount of detail throughout your image or, when working with selec-
tions, in specific areas in order to control the areas to which you want to 
draw attention.

314
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 15-2: Blurry backgrounds help the subject stand out.
Photoshop offers five sharpen filters, three of which you can ignore. The 
Sharpen, Sharpen More, and Sharpen Edges filters have no user-definable set-
tings and simply work in accordance with their names. Sure, they do a good 
job, but you don’t have that all-important control over your images! Skip 
them in favor of the it-takes-some-work-but-it’s-worth-it sharpening filters: 
Unsharp Mask and Smart Sharpen.
Unsharp Mask
The Unsharp Mask filter is, indeed, a sharpening filter, despite the name 
(which comes from the blurry — unsharp — mask created from a copy of the 
image and used in the sharpening). As you can see in Figure 15-3, Unsharp 
Mask offers three sliders to adjust the appearance of your image.
Figure 15-3: Despite its name, Unsharp Mask actually sharpens your image.

315
 Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
In the upper left, you see the original image at 100% zoom. The middle image 
shows the sharpening at 100% zoom. To the right is a 300% zoom in the pre-
view area of Unsharp Mask’s dialog box.
 
Always evaluate your filters at 100% zoom even if you need to shrink the view 
to only a critical portion of the artwork. Zoomed in or zoomed out views 
might not accurately reflect the changes that you’re making because the image 
isn’t displayed with one screen pixel representing one image pixel. Although 
video performance is greatly improved in recent versions of Photoshop, 100% 
zoom is still the safest view in which to make critical decisions. You can, of 
course, open a second view of the same image with the Window➪Arrange➪
New Window for [filename] command.
Unsharp Mask works by identifying lines of strong 
contrast — the edges of elements within your 
image — and increases the contrast along those 
edges. Along the border of a dark area and a light 
area, Unsharp Mask uses a thin band of light and 
a thin band of dark to create a light and dark halo 
along the edges. That makes the edge appear 
much more defined. Here’s how Unsharp Mask’s 
sliders (as shown in Figure 15-4) work to control 
the effect.
 
✓ Amount: The Amount slider determines how much sharpening is actu-
ally applied by controlling the brightness and darkness of the halo. 
An amount of 50% is often suitable for small images that are already in 
pretty good shape. Use 100% for general photos. Use larger values, up to 
500%, for special effects.
 
✓ Radius: Use the Radius slider to determine the width of the halo. You 
typically need a value as low as 1 pixel for small images and perhaps as 
high as 7 for larger images that don’t have a lot of tiny detail.
 
✓ Threshold: The Threshold slider helps you avoid destroying your image 
by over-sharpening fine details. If the tiniest details in the image get wide, 
bright halos, they can look garish and unnatural. The higher the Threshold 
setting, the larger an area must be before sharpening is applied. Typical 
Threshold settings are 2 for a small image and 5 or 7 for a large image.
Smart Sharpen
The Smart Sharpen filter provides you with an incredible amount of control 
over the sharpening process. Although it won’t (quite) be able to give you 
a crisp image of that bank robber from the pixelated, blurry surveillance 
camera (that happens only on TV), it will help you improve just about any 
image. Those who photograph through microscopes and telescopes might 
find this filter particularly useful. However, remember that although you 
might improve an image, some blurs won’t be removed by sharpening.
Figure 15-4: You adjust three 
sliders when sharpening with 
Unsharp Mask.

316
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Figure 15-5 shows how well Smart Sharpen works with an appropriate image. 
(Note that the Preview box is unchecked in order to show the unsharpened 
original to the right.) In this image, the blurring is consistent throughout the 
subject of the shot, and there is a reasonable amount of blur. In Figure 15-5, you 
can see that when you select the Advanced radio button, you get a pair of new 
tabs in the dialog box: Shadow and Highlight. Use those tabs to control how 
strongly the effect is applied in the darker and lighter parts of the tonal range.
Figure 15-5: Smart Sharpen does a great job with appropriate images.
Smart Sharpen also enables you to specify any of three types of blurring that 
can be plaguing your image: Gaussian Blur (a uniform blur), Lens Blur (areas 
of blur beyond the focal distance of the lens), and Motion Blur (the subject or 
camera moving while the shot was taken). If you don’t see distinct evidence 
of lens blur or motion blur, stick with Gaussian blur.
Blurring images or selections
As you can see in Figure 15-2, blurred areas in an image attract less attention 
than do the sharper parts of the photo. By making a selection, you can selec-
tively apply Photoshop’s blur filters. You can also use the blur filters to hide 
flaws in an image, including dust, noise, and unwanted little bits and pieces in 
the picture. You might also want to blur all or part of an image prior to using 
some of the artistic filters available in the Filter Gallery (which I discuss later 
in this chapter).
Photoshop provides you with almost a dozen different blur filters. Although 
you’ll eventually develop a special fondness for one or two blur filters, it’s 
good to know how each of them works. Table 15-1 gives a quick overview of 
the available filters.

317
 Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
Table 15-1 
The Workings of Photoshop’s Blur Filters
Filter Name
What It Does
Tips on Using It
Average
This filter looks at each of 
the pixels in the selection, 
determines the average 
color value, and then assigns 
that color to all the pixels in 
the selection, producing an 
area of solid color.
Changing the opacity or 
blending mode with the 
Edit➪Fade Average com-
mand afterward softens the 
averaging to the point where 
it’s more useful.
(continued)
The Edit➪Fade command
Immediately after applying just about any filter 
or adjustment command and after using many of 
Photoshop’s tools, you can adjust the effect with 
the Fade command, found under the Edit menu. 
(Keep in mind that Fade is available only immedi-
ately after using a filter, adjustment, or tool. You 
can’t even use the Save command in between.)
With Fade, you can reduce the opacity of the 
previous command or tool, thus reducing its 
impact on your image. You can also change 
the blending mode, which alters how the com-
mand or tool interacts with pixel colors prior 
to your change. Say, for example, you paint a 
black stroke with the Brush tool set to Normal 
and 100% opacity. Immediately afterward, you 
choose Edit Fade Brush. You can then pick a 
new blending mode and/or reduce the opacity 
setting, which changes the painted stroke to 
appear as if you’d selected the new settings in 
the Options bar before painting.
You can also apply the Unsharp Mask (or Smart 
Sharpen) filter and then choose Edit➪Fade 
Unsharp Mask, as shown in the figure here. 
(Yes, the Fade command changes names auto-
matically!) In the Fade dialog box, changing 
the blending mode from Normal to Luminosity 
ensures that your Unsharp Mask filter doesn’t 
alter the color of pixels along edges. Using the 
Fade command this way is the same as if you’d 
switched to Lab color mode and sharpened only 
the L channel — without having to switch color 
modes at all.
Note that the Edit➪Fade command isn’t avail-
able when you’re working with Smart Filters. If 
you need to fade the filter, you can first choose 
Layer➪Smart Objects➪Rasterize and then 
apply the filter. You lose the advantages of 
working with Smart Objects and Smart Filters, 
but the Edit➪Fade command will be available.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Table 15-1 (continued)
Filter Name
What It Does
Tips on Using It
Blur
The Blur filter applies a slight 
blur throughout the image or 
selection.
Apply the Blur filter and then 
use the shortcut Ô+F/Ctrl+F 
to reapply the filter numer-
ous times to make the effect 
stronger.
Blur More
Blur More is simply a stron-
ger version of the basic Blur 
filter.
Box Blur
The Box Blur filter blurs the 
image vertically and hori-
zontally; you see the effect 
most noticeably in small 
highlights that tend to bloom 
into squares.
In the Box Blur dialog box, 
you control the filter with a 
Radius slider.
Gaussian Blur
This filter produces a 
smoothly blurred version 
of your image without the 
distracting artifacts and lines 
you get by repeatedly apply-
ing the Blur More filter.
Get more control over the 
blurring effect by using the 
Radius slider, which lets 
you control the amount of 
blurring.
Lens Blur
This filter simulates the 
effect in which the camera’s 
zoom and aperture create 
a sharp foreground and a 
blurry background.
Use an alpha channel (a 
saved selection) to determine 
where and how strongly the 
filter is applied. For a look at 
the Lens Blur filter in action, 
see Figure 15-6.
Motion Blur
This filter lets you choose 
any angle and a wide range 
of distances (measured in 
pixels) to suggest motion for 
all or part of an image.
Use it without a selection to 
produce the illusion that the 
camera (not the subject) was 
in motion. Make a selection 
and copy it to a new layer to 
blur just that part.
Radial Blur
An incredibly powerful, yet 
incredibly flawed, tool that 
blurs in a spinning motion 
around a center point in your 
image or selection, or simu-
lates zooming in on that point.
With no preview available, 
you have no idea what set-
tings are appropriate for your 
image (and artistic vision) 
without trial and error.
Shape Blur
Uses the Radius slider and 
one of the shapes from your 
Shapes picker as a pattern 
for the blur.
You can load additional 
shapes by using the small 
black triangle at the upper 
right of the shapes area.

319
 Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
Filter Name
What It Does
Tips on Using It
Smart Blur
Controls the blur by rec-
ognizing edges (areas of 
extreme difference along a 
line of pixels) and blurring 
within those areas.
Use Smart Blur in Normal 
mode to eliminate all fine 
detail in your image, use it 
again in Edge Only mode to 
trace edges in the image, 
and then use the shortcut 
Ô+I/Ctrl+I to invert the 
image, which produces a 
black-on-white sketch of 
your original.
Surface Blur
This filter goes beyond Smart 
Blur in preserving edges. 
Restricts the blur to large 
areas of similar color in the 
image, eliminating the fine 
detail. 
Much like working with the 
Unsharp Mask filter, you use 
the Radius slider to determine 
the amount of change and the 
Threshold slider to exempt 
some areas of the image from 
the change.
Figure 15-6: Lens Blur can use an alpha channel (mask) to control the blur.

Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
Using the Lens Correction filter
The Lens Correction filter (Filter➪Lens Correction) does a wonderful job 
of cleaning up pin cushioning and barrel distortion (the outer edges of your 
image appear to bend inward or outward, respectively). You’ll see pin 
cushioning when shooting with a telephoto lens at its max zoom and barrel 
distortion at the lens’s lower magnification. Both are most obvious when 
the photo has what should be straight lines at the edges. You can also use 
Lens Correction to adjust the vertical or horizontal plane of an image, as well 
as perspective (as discussed in Chapter 9). In Figure 15-7, you see the Lens 
Correction window’s rather complex Custom and Auto Correction panels.
Figure 15-7: In addition to the extensive control in the Custom panel, Lens Correction also 
offers Auto Correction.
Here’s what you have at your disposal in the Lens Correction window:
In the upper-left corner of the window are five tools:
 
 
✓ Remove Distortion (top): Select this tool to drag in the preview area to 
adjust the distortion factor.
 
 
✓ Straighten (second): This tool is simple: Click and drag along any line in 
the image that should be straight, and the image is straightened!
 
 
✓ Drag Grid (middle): Use this to reposition the grid overlay, aligning it 
with the content of your image.
 
 
✓ Hand and Zoom: The lower pair of tools should look familiar. The Hand 
and Zoom tools function as they do anywhere in Photoshop: When 

321
 Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
the image doesn’t fit in the window, click and drag with the Hand tool 
to reposition; click the Zoom tool to zoom in, or Option/Alt+click to 
zoom out.
In the Custom panel, you can also find:
 
✓ Remove Distortion slider: The Remove Distortion slider is the heart of 
this filter. You use this to compensate for pin cushioning or barrel dis-
tortion in the image. Drag it back and forth until your image’s vertical 
and horizontal lines are straight throughout the image.
 
✓ Chromatic Aberration sliders: Sometimes a photograph shows dis-
torted color along fine angular lines, such as the branches of trees or 
latticework. You can minimize these colored halos or fringes with the 
Chromatic Aberration sliders. Generally speaking, you want to zoom in 
close on a specific area of detail to make the adjustment.
 
✓ Vignette sliders: Drag the Amount slider to the left to add a dark vignette 
(fading along the outer edges of the image) or correct a light vignette, 
drag to the right to add a white vignette or remove a dark vignette. The 
Midpoint slider increases and decreases the amount of shadowing or 
highlight along the edges.
 
✓ Transform controls: Use the Vertical Perspective and Horizontal 
Perspective sliders to make your image appear parallel to the viewer. 
Much like using the perspective crop option or the Edit➪Transform➪
Perspective command, you’re changing the perceived angle of the image 
to the viewer. (See Figure 9-13 for perspective adjustment in action.)
 
✓ Zoom and grid: Click the minus and plus buttons in the lower-left corner 
to zoom out and in, or choose a preset zoom factor from the pop-up 
menu. Click and drag on the Size field’s label (the actual word Size) 
to resize the grid. Click the color swatch to change the color from the 
default gray. (I liked bright yellow for the image in Figure 15-7.)
 
✓ Saving and loading settings: From the Lens Correction window’s menu 
(to the right of the Settings pop-up menu), you can save settings and 
load them later. Because you can name the settings, you can save a set 
for each of your lenses, at each of their zoom factors, and apply the 
same correction easily, time after time.
 
The Auto Corrections panel, shown to the right in Figure 15-7, enables you to 
apply pre-defined corrections, based on the camera and lens used to capture 
the image. Most recent model high-end DSLRs from major manufacturers 
are supported, along with a variety of lenses. If you don’t see a preset for 
your camera/lens combination, click the Search Online button — other 
photographers using the same gear may have posted a lens profile at Adobe 
Labs. Remember that Auto Correction is used to compensate for the vagaries 
of the camera/lens combination — lens distortion, chromatic aberration, and 
light falloff toward the edges of the image (vignetting). Use the Custom panel 
to correct for the problems listed earlier in this section.

Cleaning up with Reduce Noise
Digital noise — those annoying red, green, and blue specks in your image — 
can ruin an otherwise lovely picture. (To avoid noise, make sure that your 
camera is set to shoot at the lowest ISO setting possible.) Photoshop also has 
a filter for reducing (not necessarily eliminating) digital noise in your images. 
Found in the Filter➪Noise menu, Reduce Noise can do an excellent job of 
minimizing the random red, green, and blue pixels in your image, as you can 
see in Figure 15-8.
Figure 15-8: Reduce Noise neutralizes the red, green, and blue specks in a digital image.
 
When you work with Raw images, do all your noise correction in the Camera 
Raw plug-in (see Chapter 7). For images in formats other than Raw, use the 
Reduce Noise filter.
Here are the steps that I recommend when you use the Reduce Noise filter:
 
1. Set the details sliders to 0 (zero).
 
 In the Reduce Noise dialog box, drag the Preserve Details and Sharpen 
Details sliders all the way to the left. This eliminates any interference 
with the actual noise reduction.

323
 Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
 
2. Reduce Color Noise.
 
 Use the Reduce Color Noise slider to minimize the red, green, and blue 
specks in your image. Drag the slider slowly to the right until the color 
noise is gone.
 
3. Adjust Sharpen Details.
 
 Increase the Sharpen Details slider 1% at a time until the color noise 
returns; then back off 1%.
 
4. Adjust Preserve Details.
 
 Drag the Preserve Details slider to the right until you have a good bal-
ance between image detail and any luminance noise (bright and dark 
specks) in the image. 
If you see noise of one color considerably longer than the others when drag-
ging the Reduce Color Noise slider, click the Advanced button near the top 
of the dialog box and work with each channel individually, according to its 
needs. Also note the Remove JPEG Artifact check box at the bottom of the 
window. If your image is suffering from JPEG compression problems, select-
ing that check box might help relieve the effects. (JPEG compression often 
results in visible borders between 8 x 8 pixel squares within your image.) 
Remember, too, that you can use the button to the right of the Settings 
pop-up menu to save your correction for future use — it will be added to the 
Settings menu.
Getting Creative with the Filter Gallery
You can apply and combine many (but not all) of Photoshop’s creative filters 
by choosing Filter➪Filter Gallery. This integrated window lets you use multi-
ple filters at the same time rather than guessing which settings will look good 
with another filter applied later. Each filter remains live (you can change the 
settings) until you click OK. Check out Figure 15-9.
 
If Filter Gallery is grayed out and unavailable, head for the Image➪Mode 
menu and select 8-Bits/Channel — the Filter Gallery is not available for 
images in 16-bit color. Keep in mind, too, that the Filter Gallery can be 
applied as a Smart Filter when working with Smart Objects.
The basic workflow goes like this: Adjust a filter, add a new filter to the stack, 
select the new filter in the middle pane, adjust the settings to the right, add 
a new filter to the stack, and so on. If you adjust your first filter settings and 
then click another filter in the middle column before adding another effect, 
you replace the first filter rather than adding to it. (If you Option/Alt+click a 
new filter, it will be added to the stack rather than replace the active filter in 
the stack.) Here’s my step-by-step strategy for working in the Filter Gallery 
window:

1. Prepare your image before entering the Filter Gallery.
 
 Many of Photoshop’s creative filters work best when you prepare the 
image (or parts of the image) first. You have a couple of key filters that 
don’t appear in Filter Gallery:
 
• Smoothing detail: Because Photoshop’s art-related filters can con-
centrate on details in your image, too much fine detail can make 
your filter effects crowded and cruddy. Before working with Ink 
Outlines, for example, try eliminating the tiny little bits in your 
image. You could try either Smart Blur or Surface Blur.
 
• Adding detail: Many of Photoshop’s filters don’t do anything if 
the target area doesn’t have some texture or detail with which to 
work. That’s where the Add Noise filter comes in handy, adding 
dark and light specks to the smooth area. Use the Monochromatic 
and Gaussian options, with an Amount setting from 10% to 15%. 
After adding noise to the too-smooth area, consider using the 
Blur➪Motion Blur filter or the Pixelate➪Crystallize filter (to make 
small specks bigger). 

325
 Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
 
2. Don’t forget layers and blending modes.
 
 Make a copy of your layer before entering the Filter Gallery so you can 
later mess around with layer blending modes and opacity to combine 
the filtered version with the original, which can soften or even enhance 
the effects you’ve applied. 
 
3. Add to the stack before selecting filters.
 
 You make your initial filter selection and adjustment. Then before you 
switch to a different filter in the middle pane of the window, you need 
to add a filter to the stack by clicking the New Effect Layer button in the 
lower-right corner (to the left of the Trash icon).
 
4. Play with the stacking order.
 
 Drag filters up and down in the stack at the lower right to change their 
order.
 
 The order in which the filters are applied often makes a huge difference 
in the final appearance of your image.
 
5. Use the eyeball column.
 
 It’s a good idea sometimes to hide one or more effects in the stack while 
you fine-tune a filter’s settings.
 
 Filters are cumulative — changes that you make to one filter can them-
selves be changed by other filters in the stack.
Not all creative filters are available in the Filter Gallery. Remember that 
Photoshop has dozens of filters that are available only through the Filter 
menu, not through Filter Gallery. 
 
Download the Photoshop CS5 For Dummies Cheat Sheet from the link listed on 
the inside cover. Among other things, it lists which of Photoshop’s creative 
filters use the current foreground color, background color, or both. Have the 
correct colors selected before entering the Filter Gallery.
Push, Pull, and Twist with Liquify
Although the Lens Correction filter has added another powerful correction 
tool to your arsenal, you still want to sometimes fix a photograph’s perspec-
tive or barrel distortion with Liquify. Perhaps. But with Lens Correction now 
available, Liquify can concentrate on its fun side.
I know of nothing in Photoshop that can bring a smile faster and more easily than 
creating some strange creature from a friend or loved one in Liquify. I will read-
ily admit that the glow produced by the praise of an art critic is gratifying, but 
does it compare to, “More, Uncle Pete! Give me bigger ears!”? It would certainly 
be a disservice to the Liquify feature to overlook its powerful image-correction 

326
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
capabilities, so please remember that almost anything you can do to emphasize 
or enhance an attribute can be done in reverse to minimize that aspect of the 
image. Making someone short and wide? You can also make them tall and thin. 
Creating a bulging nose? Create a slim and pert nose. It’s all possible with Liquify.
That having been said, examine Figure 15-10, which shows some rather dra-
matic changes. (But it should give you some idea of how useful Liquify can be 
for more subtle tasks, like trimming tummies, toning arms and legs, thinning 
noses, and other such work.)
Figure 15-10: Liquify gives you unbelievable control over the pixels in your image.
Take a look at the tools arrayed along the left edge of the Liquify window. 
Here’s what they do, starting at the top:
 
 
✓ Forward Warp tool: Much like Photoshop’s Smudge tool, you click and 
drag the Forward Warp tool to push the pixels around.
 
 
✓ Reconstruct tool: Use the Reconstruct tool as your “undo.” (When in 
Liquify, you can use Ô+Z/Ctrl+Z, but it goes back only one step.) Drag 
over areas that you want to restore to their original appearance.

327
 Chapter 15: Filters: The Fun Side of Photoshop
 
 
✓ Twirl Clockwise tool: Click and hold the mouse button down or drag in 
a circle to spin the pixels within the brush diameter. And if you want to 
twirl counterclockwise, simply add the Option/Alt key.
 
 
✓ Pucker tool: The Pucker tool sucks pixels into the center of the brush. 
You can click and hold or drag the Pucker tool. Holding down the 
Option/Alt key toggles you to the Bloat tool.
 
 
✓ Bloat tool: The opposite of the Pucker tool, the Bloat tool pushes pixels out 
from the center. Holding down the Option/Alt key switches to the Pucker tool.
 
 
✓ Push Left tool: As you drag the Push Left tool, pixels are shifted to the 
left of the path along which you drag (not necessarily to your left). If you 
drag up, the pixels are shifted to the left on the screen; drag down, and 
the pixels are shifted to the right. Use the Option/Alt key to reverse the 
behavior and push pixels to the right of the path.
 
 
✓ Mirror tool: As you drag the Mirror tool, whatever pixels are immediately to 
the left of the cursor as you drag are flipped and pasted into the brush along 
the path you drag. When dragging left to right, whatever is directly above the 
cursor as you drag is flipped and copied into the brush. For best results, use 
the Freeze Mask tool (see the upcoming bullet) on the pixels that you want 
to copy before using the Mirror tool. Holding down the Option/Alt key 
reverses the behavior, copying the pixels to the right of the path as you drag.
 
 
✓ Turbulence tool: The Turbulence tool is great for adding smooth distor-
tion along the path you drag. Think of it as making waves along the path. 
Holding down the Option/Alt key switches the Turbulence tool to the 
Reconstruct tool.
 
 
✓ Freeze Mask tool: One of the most important tools, the Freeze Mask tool 
lets you protect areas of your image from change. Paint over an area 
(you see a red mask) to freeze it — to keep it from changing.
 
 
✓ Thaw Mask tool: Unprotect areas with the Thaw Mask tool. It removes 
the red overlay and lets you liquify the area again.
 
 
✓ Hand tool: As always, the Hand tool lets you reposition an image in the 
window when it doesn’t all fit. Just click and drag your image to move it 
in the preview window.
 
 
✓ Zoom tool: As you might suspect, the Zoom tool functions as it usually 
does. Click to zoom in, Option/Alt+click to zoom out, and click and drag 
to zoom in on a specific area.
To the right in the Liquify window are a number of variables and options. Brush 
Size is the tool brush diameter; Brush Density is comparable with feathering 
(lower is softer); and Brush Pressure controls the strength of the active tool.
The Reconstruct Options let you restore or partially restore your image to 
the original appearance. The Reconstruct button is less like Step Backward or 
Undo and more like Fade. Rather than reversing the liquification steps you’ve 

328
Part III: Creating “Art” in Photoshop 
already applied, it weakens them. The Mode pop-up menu offers several ways 
to control how strictly the image is reconstructed. The mode that you select 
is also used with the Reconstruct tool. (Revert is the most precise mode.) 
The Restore All button returns your image to its pre-Liquify appearance.
If you’re working on only one layer of your image and that layer has a layer 
mask or transparent areas, or if you make a selection before entering the 
Liquify feature, you can use the buttons in the Mask Options area to create 
frozen areas (areas that are protected from change).
Near the bottom of the right side of the Liquify window (as you can see in Figure 
15-10), you can see the View Options, which let you show and hide the mesh: the 
actual distortion you’re creating. Note the mesh size and color options.
Do I Need Those Other Filters?
Photoshop has dozens of creative 
and productive filters that you 
access through the Filter menu 
rather than through the Filter 
Gallery; the Shear and Spherize 
filters are shown in Figure 15-11. 
Some do strange and wonderful 
things to your selection or image, 
and some do strange things that you 
might never need. (You can find a 
description of each of the filters in 
Photoshop’s Help.)
One fun and useful filter that you 
shouldn’t overlook is Clouds (found 
in the Filter➪Render menu). Using 
the foreground and background 
colors, Clouds, shown in Figure 
15-12, can produce lovely and unob-
trusive backgrounds, or patterns that 
can be scaled and transformed to 
create smoke or steam. Like Clouds, 
the Difference Clouds filter creates 
cloud-like patterns, but it uses the 
content of the active layer as a basis 
for the pattern. Run the filter several 
times, perhaps as many as 20 times, 
to create abstract and marble 
patterns.

Spherize filter bulges and pinches.

ant backgrounds.

Part IV
Power Photoshop

In this part . . .
T
his part is more specialized than the others in 
the book. These two chapters cover features 
of Photoshop that you might never need.
Chapter 16 shows you how to streamline some of 
your work with Photoshop’s automation com-
mands. You also read about recording Actions 
and get a quick look at using scripting to automate 
Photoshop. Keep in mind that Chapter 16 also 
includes information on creating your own Web 
sites in Adobe Bridge, generating on-screen pre-
sentations, creating contact sheets to track your 
images, and printing multiple copies of an image 
on a single sheet of paper — saving both time and 
money!
If you don’t have Photoshop CS5 Extended, you 
might skip Chapter 17. However, even if you don’t 
have the Extended version, you might want to 
take a peek to see how Photoshop can work with 
3D, video, DICOM medical imaging, and measure 
and record various measurements for scientiﬁ c 
and technical research.

In This Chapter
▶ Working with Actions and the Batch command
▶ Scripting in Photoshop
▶ Extending Photoshop
▶ Automating your work in Bridge
▶ Generating multi-page PDFs and presentations
▶ Generating Web galleries through Bridge
A
lot of the work that you do in Photoshop is fun — 
experimenting with filters, applying creative adjust-
ments, cloning over former in-laws, that sort of thing. A 
bunch of your work, though, is likely to be repetitive, 
mundane, and even downright boring. That’s where 
automation comes in. If a task isn’t fun to do, if you 
need to speed things up, or if you need to ensure 
that the exact same steps are taken time after time, 
automation is for you.
I begin the chapter with a look at Photoshop’s 
Actions and the Batch command, which enable 
you to process many files automatically. Next, I give 
you a quick look at scripts, such as the very power-
ful Image Processor. Scripts are sort of little computer 
programs that you use to control your computer — 
Photoshop, other programs, your printer, or even an operat-
ing system itself. There’s a brief introduction to extensions and 
Flash panels. After that, I introduce automation through Bridge’s Tools 
menu and show you the powerful Output panel. Bridge also enables you to 
generate PDF presentations, multi-page PDFs (including contact sheets and 
picture packages), and even Web galleries of your images.

332
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Ready, Set, Action!
In Photoshop, an Action is simply a recorded series of steps that you can play 
back on another image to replicate an effect or technique. To choose a wild 
example, say that every image in your new book about Photoshop needs to 
be submitted at a size of exactly 1,024 x 768 pixels at 300 ppi, regardless of 
content. Record an Action that uses the Image Size command to change reso-
lution and then use the Canvas Size command to expand the image to 1,024 x 
768 pixels. Use that Action (play the Action) on each image before submitting 
it. Better yet, wait until all the images for a chapter are ready and then use 
the Batch command to play the Action automatically on each of them!
Actions and the Batch command not only streamline repetitive tasks; they 
also ensure precision — that every one of those images will be exactly 1,024 
x 768 pixels, each and every time. But Actions also have a creative side to 
them. The lower part of the Action panel’s menu (see Figure 16-1) contains 
Action sets that you can load into the panel to produce frame and border 
effects, text effects, and more. (The content of your Actions panel menu 
might differ from what’s shown in Figure 16-1.) You can also purchase collec-
tions of Actions from commercial sources.
To work with an Action, open an image, select the Action in the Actions 
panel, and then click the Play button at the bottom of the panel. As you can 
see in Figure 16-1, the three buttons to the left use the near-universal symbols 
for Stop, Record, and Play. The three to the right use the standard Adobe 
symbols indicating New Set, New Action, and Trash.
Any step in the Actions panel that doesn’t have a check mark in the left 
column is skipped when you play the Action. Any step that has a symbol vis-
ible in the second column (the modal control column) pauses when you play 
the Action. Click in the second column when you want the Action to wait for 
you to do something. Perhaps you’ll click in that column next to a Crop step 
so that you can adjust the Crop tool’s bounding box. You might click in the 
second column next to an Image Size step so that you can input a specific 
size or choose a resampling algorithm. After you make a change or input a 
value for that step, press Return/Enter to continue playing the Action.
 
Notice the grayed-out Save Actions command in the panel’s menu in Figure 
16-1. Remember that you have to select a set of Actions in the panel, not an 
individual Action, to use the Save Actions command. If you want to save only 
one Action, create a new set and Option/Alt+drag the Action to that set to 
copy it. You can also create a printable text file (.txt) of your Actions set by 
holding down the Ô+Option/Ctrl+Alt keys when selecting Save Actions. Text 
versions of your Actions provide an easy reference for what each Action (and 
step) does to an image.

333
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop
Figure 16-1: The Actions panel menu includes sets of Actions 
you can load into the panel.
If you get hooked on Actions, you’ll also want to try Button Mode in the 
Actions panel menu. Each Action appears in the panel as a color-coded 
button. You don’t see the steps of the Action, so you don’t know whether 
an individual step is being skipped and you can’t change the modal control 
column, but you might like the color-coding to sort your Actions.
Recording your own Actions
The real power of Actions comes to you when you record your own. Sure, the 
sets of Actions included with Photoshop are great, and the commercial pack-
ages of Actions have some good stuff too, but it’s not your stuff. When you 
record your own Actions, you record the steps that work for your images, 
your workflow, and your artistic vision.
Actions can’t float free in Photoshop’s Actions panel: Each Action must be 
part of a set of Actions. Before beginning to record your Action, you can 

334
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
select an existing set or click the 
fourth button at the bottom of the 
panel to create a new set. When you 
have a set selected, you can then 
click the New Action button (second 
from right). Then, in the New Action 
dialog box that appears (as shown 
in Figure 16-2), assign a name (and 
color-code for Button Mode and 
perhaps assign an F-key combina-
tion) and click the Record button. 
From that point forward, just about 
everything you do in Photoshop is 
recorded as part of the Action until 
you click the Stop button at the 
bottom of the Actions panel. No worries, though — you can always delete 
unwanted steps from a recorded Action by dragging them to the Trash icon 
at the bottom of the Actions panel. And if you want to change something in 
the Action, you can double-click a step and rerecord it.
 
You can record most of Photoshop’s commands and tools in an Action, but 
you can’t control anything outside of Photoshop. (For that you need script-
ing, introduced later in this chapter.) You can’t, for example, use an Action 
to print (controlling the printer’s own print driver), copy a filename from 
the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer, or open Illustrator and select a path to 
add to your Photoshop document. Nor can you record the movement of the 
cursor in your Actions, which generally rules out recording painting tools.
Here are some tips about recording your own custom Actions:
 
✓ Open a file first. Open the file in which you’re going to work before you 
start recording the Action. Otherwise, the Open command becomes part 
of the Action, and the Action will play on that specific file every time you 
use it. You can, however, record the Open command within an Action to 
open a second file — perhaps to copy something from that file.
 
✓ Record the Close command after Save As. When you record the Save 
As command in an Action, you’re creating a new file on your hard drive. 
Follow the Save As command with the File➪Close command and elect 
Don’t Save when prompted. That closes and preserves the original image.
 
✓ Use Percent as the unit of measure. If you need an element in your 
artwork to be in the same spot regardless of file size or shape (like a 
copyright notice in the lower-right corner), change the unit of measure 
to Percent in Photoshop’s Preferences before recording the Action.
 
✓ Record/insert menu commands. When you use a menu command while 
recording your Action, the actual values that you enter into the dialog 
Figure 16-2: After you click the New Action 
button, you see the New Action dialog box.

335
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop
box are recorded, too. If you’d rather select the values appropriate for 
each individual image (perhaps for the Unsharp Mask filter or the Image 
Size command), insert the command rather than record it. When you 
reach that specific spot in your process, use the Actions panel menu 
command Insert Menu Item (refer to Figure 16-1). With the dialog box 
open, mouse to and select the appropriate menu command; then click 
OK to continue recording the Action. In Figure 16-3, you see the Insert 
Menu Item dialog box when first opened (before a command is selected) 
and after I used the mouse to select the Image Size command from 
Photoshop’s Image menu.
 
 Figure 16-3: Using Insert Menu Item leaves a dialog box open when 
playing the Action.
 
✓ Record multiple versions of a step, but activate one. Say you want to 
record an Action that does a lot of stuff to an image, including changing 
the pixel dimensions with the Image Size command. However, you want 
to use this Action with a variety of images that require two or three dif-
ferent final sizes. You can record as many Image Size commands as you 
want in that one Action — just remember to deselect the left column in 
the Actions panel next to each of the Image Size steps except the one 
you currently want to use.
 
✓ Record Actions inside Actions. While recording an Action, you can 
select another Action and click the Actions panel’s Play button — the 
selected Action will be recorded within the new Action.
 
✓ Insert a message or warning. Use the Actions panel menu command 
Insert Stop to send a message to anyone who plays your Action. The 
message could be something like “You must have a type layer active in 
the Layers panel before playing this Action” with buttons for Stop and 

336
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Continue. Or you could phrase it more specifically: “If you have not 
selected a type layer in the Layers panel, click Stop. If a type layer is 
active in the Layers panel, click Continue.” The more precise the mes-
sage, the less confusion later. In Figure 16-4, you see the Record Stop 
dialog box, where you type your message when recording the Action 
(top), as well as a look at how the message appears when the Action is 
played back later (bottom).
 
Figure 16-4: Insert a Stop to show a message when the Action is played.
 
✓ Remember Conditional Mode Change and Fit Image. These two com-
mands in the File➪Automate menu are designed to be recorded in an 
Action that you might later use on a wide variety of images.
 
• Conditional Mode Change is very handy when your Action (or final 
result) depends on the image being in a specific color mode. When 
you record Conditional Mode Change in an Action, every image, 
regardless of its original color mode, is converted to the target 
color mode (see Figure 16-5). Say, for example, that you need to 
apply a certain filter in an Action, but that filter is available only for 
RGB images. If you record Conditional Mode Change before run-
ning the filter, the Action will play properly.

337
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop
 
 Figure 16-5: Conditional Mode Change converts every image to the 
target color mode.
 
• Fit Image specifies a maxi-
mum width and height 
that the image being pro-
cessed must not exceed, 
regardless of size or 
shape — great for batch-
processing images for the 
Web. Fit Image maintains 
your images’ aspect ratios 
(to avoid distortion) while 
ensuring that every image 
processed fits within the 
parameters you specify 
(see Figure 16-6). If you need all landscape-oriented images to be 
800 x 600 pixels and all portrait-oriented images to be 600 x 800 
pixels, enter 800 in both the width and the height fields.
 
 Notice the new Don’t Enlarge check box in the Fit Image dialog box. This 
is one of those simple “Why hasn’t this always been there?” changes 
in Photoshop CS5. If you’re prepping images for a Web site and reduc-
ing them to a specific size to make them download and display faster, 
you don’t necessarily want to enlarge some of the images, making them 
download slower. Disable this option when you’re trying to make all the 
images uniform in size, perhaps for the creation of a PDF presentation 
(discussed later in this chapter).
Figure 16-6: Fit Image scales all images to fit 
within the specified dimensions.

338
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
 
✓ Always record an Action using a copy of your image. Because the 
steps that you record in the Action are actually executed on the open 
file, record your Action using a copy of the original image. That way, if 
something goes wrong, your original image is protected.
Working with the Batch command
Photoshop’s File➪Automate➪Batch command plays back a single Action on a 
number of files. You select an Action to play and also a folder of image files to 
play it on; then you decide what you want to do with the files after the Action 
finishes with them. You can leave the images open in Photoshop, save and 
close them, or (much safer) save them to another folder, preserving the origi-
nals. Figure 16-7 shows the Batch dialog box and also the pop-up menu for the 
fields in the File Naming area. (When you select a new folder as the Destination 
in Batch, you must tell Photoshop how you want the new files to be named.)
Figure 16-7: The Batch command is much simpler than it looks!

339
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop
You must remember three things when assigning filenames:
 
✓ Include a variable. Something must change from filename to filename. 
Select one of the top nine items in the pop-up menu (some version of the 
original document name or a serial number or a serial letter). It doesn’t 
have to be in the first field, but one element of the filename must be dif-
ferent from file to file.
 
✓ Don’t use a period (.) in any field. You can type in any of the fields 
(except the last one you use), but for compatibility, stick with letters, 
numbers, underscores (_), and hyphens (-).
 
 Absolutely do not use a period (.) in the filename. The only period that 
can be used in a filename is the one that’s automatically added immedi-
ately before the file extension.
 
✓ You have two other decisions of note in the Batch dialog box. When 
you elect to suppress any Open commands in the Action, you protect 
yourself from poorly recorded Actions that start by opening the image 
with which they were recorded. However, if the Action depends on the 
content of a second file, you don’t want to override that Open command. 
Generally, you want to override any Save As commands recorded in 
the Action, relying instead on the decisions that you make in the Batch 
dialog box to determine the fate of the image.
Sticking to the Script
You can use AppleScript (Mac), Visual Basic (Windows), and JavaScript 
(both) with Photoshop. Scripts are much more powerful than Photoshop’s 
Actions because they can control elements outside of Photoshop itself. 
AppleScripts and Visual Basic scripts can even run multiple programs and 
play JavaScripts. If you’re interested in scripting, go to the Photoshop folder 
on your hard drive and explore the content of the Scripting Guide folder. You 
can find plenty of information to get you started!
 
You can find more scripts on the Internet, including some at www.adobe.com/
cfusion/exchange/index.cfm. Select Scripts from the Adobe Photoshop 
Download pop-up menu.
If you shoot in your camera’s Raw format, perhaps the most useful of the sev-
eral pre-recorded scripts installed with Photoshop is Image Processor (see 
Figure 16-8). You can use Image Processor to batch-convert your Raw images 
to JPEG, PSD, or TIFF — and you can even resize the images automatically 
while converting! (And while Image Processor is designed to work with Raw 
files, you can actually convert any file format that Photoshop can open.)

340
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Figure 16-8: Image Processor can batch-convert to speed your workflow.
Image Processor is much simpler than it appears:
 
✓ Select the images to process. If the images are already open in 
Photoshop, great! If not, click the button and select a folder of images. If 
the source folder has subfolders and you want to process the images in 
those subfolders, select that option.
 
✓ Choose a destination. You can save the files in the folder of origination, 
or you can click the button and select a different folder in which to save 
the processed images.
 
 Do not click the Select Folder button and select the source folder. 
If you want to keep the processed images in the same folder as the 
unprocessed images, simply click on the Save in Same Location button. 
Photoshop is smart enough — most of the time — to recognize the 
source folder and avoid re-processing already-processed images in an 
endless loop, but don’t risk it.

341
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop
 
✓ Select the file format and options. Each of the three file formats offers 
the option of resizing. JPEG offers options for Quality (the amount 
of compression — and associated image degradation) and to convert 
to sRGB (for the Web or e-mail). Maximizing compatibility for PSD 
files ensures the image can be seen and opened by other programs 
of the Creative Suite and earlier versions of Photoshop. TIFF’s LZW 
compression can significantly reduce file size, without degrading the 
image at all.
At the bottom of the Image Processor dialog box, you also have the options 
to run an Action on the images as they’re processed, to add your copyright 
information to the file’s metadata (not on the image itself), and to embed the 
color profile in the image.
Note also the Save and Load buttons. If you set up a couple of folders, one 
where you dump the originals and another where you save from Image 
Processor, you can save your usual setup and load it whenever you need to 
repeat the job.
Adding Extensions to Photoshop
Extensions are custom-made panels that add functionality to Photoshop. 
Kuler, which is installed by default with Photoshop, is used to generate sets 
of coordinating colors. Other extensions, also called 
Flash panels, are available from a variety of sources, 
including Adobe Exchange (www.adobe.com/
cfusion/exchange/index.cfm).
Extensions can be simple panels that hold a specific 
set of tools and commands often used together, or 
complex panels that can runs scripts and access 
assets outside of Photoshop.
For the adventurous, consider making your own 
panels using Adobe Configurator, available from 
Adobe Labs (www.labs.adobe.com). You can, for 
example, create a custom panel that holds the tools 
and commands (as buttons) that you use for a partic-
ular job. In Figure 16-9, a simple custom panel holds 
those tools and commands I like to access while 
painting on a Cintiq or Intuous tablet. This tidy little 
panel can float near the area where I’m working; it’s 
easily available and easy to use.
Figure 16-9: Custom panels 
can simplify your 
workspace.

Tooling around in Bridge
The first step in getting familiar with Adobe Bridge’s automation options 
is Bridge’s Tools menu (see Figure 16-10). Note that if you have the Adobe 
Creative Suite installed, you’ll also see other programs listed in addition to 
Photoshop.
Figure 16-10: The Tools commands can make quick work of big jobs.
Here’s an overview of some of the tasks you can perform through the Tools 
menu:
 
✓ Batch Rename. Rename a whole series of images in a single process! 
Select the image thumbnails or a folder of images in Bridge, open Batch 
Rename (see Figure 16-11), construct the new filenames, and click the 
Rename button.
 
 When building the new file names, use the plus and minus buttons to the 
right to add or subtract each element. The various choices are shown in 
the box to the right in Figure 16-11. Each element will have one or two 
fields or pop-up menus to the right.
 
 Absolutely do not use a period (.) in any text field of the new filename. 
The only period that can be used in a filename is the one that’s auto-
matically added immediately before the file extension. In the text fields, 
use only letters, numbers, underscores (_), and hyphens (-). To use 
a period or any other symbol in the new filename risks making the file 
unrecognizable by Photoshop or any other program. (This means you, 
too, Mr. & Ms. MacUser!)
 
✓ Device Central. Used to create images for display on cellphones 
and other such smaller screens, Device Central can also be accessed 
through Photoshop’s File➪Save for Web & Devices command.

343
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop
Figure 16-11: Batch Rename enables you to speedily take care of one very important 
organizational task.
 
✓ Work with metadata templates. Metadata, that useful information about an 
image stored with the image, often is repeated from file to file. You might, 
for example, add exactly the same copyright information to each and every 
image you shoot. Or you might return from a job or trip or vacation with 
gigabytes of images shot at the same location or of the same subject. Using 
metadata templates enables you to quickly and easily add metadata to a 
series of (or even folders of) images, in just a couple of clicks.
 
✓ Manage Bridge’s cache. The cache is where Bridge stores thumbnails 
and metadata of images with which it has already worked. Accessing the 
cache for a folder (rather than re-processing each image every time you 
open the folder) can save loads of time. However, sometimes the cache 
can get corrupted. Should you see, for example, thumbnails of images 
that have been moved or deleted, go to the Tools➪Cache menu and 
elect to purge the cache. You can also build and export the cache for the 
current folder through this menu, which is a great thing to do just before 
burning the folder to DVD or CD as a backup!
 
✓ Access automation in other programs. As you can see in Figure 16-10, 
Bridge’s Tools menu also gives you access to a number of Photoshop’s 
automations and scripts. (If you have Illustrator and/or InDesign 
installed, you’ll have access to some of their features as well.)

Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Creating Presentations and Multi-page PDFs
Much of the functionality that once appeared in Photoshop’s File➪Automate 
menu has migrated to Bridge, where it’s available to all of the programs of 
the Creative Suite. You can create PDFs, both multi-page and presentations, 
as well as Web galleries, through Bridge’s Output panel. Access the Output 
panel by clicking that workspace name or the button, as shown in Figure 16-12.
Figure 16-12: Automate your output with Bridge’s Output panel.
Creating a PDF presentation
Portable Document Format (PDF), the native file format of Adobe Acrobat, 
has become an incredibly useful and near-universal format. It’s hard to find 
a computer that doesn’t have Adobe Reader (free software to open and view 
PDF files) or another program for viewing PDFs, and that helps make PDF a 
wonderful format for sharing or distributing your images.
In Bridge’s Output panel, shown in Figure 16-13, you can quickly and easily 
create both on-screen presentations (complete with fancy transitions between 
images) and multi-page PDF documents (suitable for distribution and printing).
To create a PDF Presentation in Bridge, take the following steps:
 
1. Select the thumbnails of the images you want to include. You can click 
and then Shift+click to select a series of images or Ô+click (Mac)/
Ctrl+click (Windows) to select individual images.
 
 Hint: You must select the images; you can’t select only the folder. 
Bridge automatically skips any non-image files that are selected.
 
2. In the Document section, choose an appropriate size.
 
 Choose one of the Web presets, shown in Figure 16-14, rather than 
a paper size. Adobe Reader can scale the presentation, so 800 x 600 
pixels is a good choice unless you know the presentation will always 
be played back on a larger monitor. Choose your background color 
(black is an excellent choice) and determine whether you want to 
require a password to open the document or to make the presentation 
non-printable.
 
3. Choose a layout of one-by-one.
 
 Unless you actually want more than one image displayed in each frame 
of the presentation, use a layout of one column and one row, as you see 
in Figure 16-15.

345
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop
Figure 16-13: PDF is a great format for sharing images as presentations or as documents.
 
4. (Optional.) Add the filename, a header, a footer, or a watermark to 
each frame.
 
 In the Overlays section (flip ahead to Figure 16-19 if you want to see 
it), you can elect to add the filename (with or without the file exten-
sion) below each image, choosing the font, style, size, and color of 
your choice. The Header and Footer sections enable you to add a text 
message (customizable, of course) to the top and/or bottom of each 
slide of your presentation. You can also add a watermark, perhaps your 
copyright information at a reduced opacity, across the center of the 
image. Your options in the Watermark section (shown in Figure 16-20) 
include all the font choices, Opacity, and Foreground or Background. 
(Unless your images include transparency or reduced opacity, select 
Foreground.)
 
5. Choose your playback options.
 
 You select whether you want the presentation to fill the screen, how 
long each frame will be displayed, whether the presentation plays once 
or continuously, and how it changes from frame to frame. Figure 16-16 
shows the layout.

346
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
 
6. Preview your presentation.
 
 Click the Refresh Preview button near the top (shown in Figures 16-14 
through 16-16) to make sure you’ll get want you want.
 
7. Save your presentation.
 
 Way down at the bottom of this dialog box (and shown in Figure 16-16), 
you can choose to view the presentation (or not) when ready with the 
View PDF After Save option. Click the Save button, name the presentation 
(Bridge will automatically add the .pdf file extension), choose a location 
in which to save, and click Save.
Collecting thumbnails 
in a contact sheet
In the old Dark(room) Ages, photographers regularly made a record of which 
images were on which film strips by exposing those strips on a piece of pho-
tographic paper, thus creating a contact sheet. The contact sheet serves the 
same purpose as thumbnails or previews in Bridge or the Open dialog box or 
Figure 16-15: It’s possible to have multiple 
images in each frame, but not typical.
Figure 16-14: Size your presentation for 
on-screen display rather than print.

347
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop
thumbnail images on a Web 
page — they show which image is 
which. Hard copy contact sheets are 
useful to present to a client. Bridge 
can automate the process for you in 
the Output panel by generating a PDF 
that contains small copies of each 
image in a folder. Here’s the 
procedure:
 
1. Select the thumbnails of the 
images you want to include.
 
 Hint: You must select the 
images; you can’t select only 
the folder. Bridge automatically 
skips any non-image files that 
are selected.
 
2. Select an appropriate page size 
in the Document area.
 
 Choose from among the presets 
or define a custom size. If the 
contact sheets will be printed, 
use a paper size, as you see in 
Figure 16-17. If they’re intended 
only for on-screen display, 
select a size from the Web pre-
sets (shown in Figure 16-14). 
Elect to generate high-quality or low-quality thumbnails and pick a back-
ground color. (Black is beautiful and makes your images “snap,” but also 
uses a lot more ink when printing.) You can also require a password to 
open the document or forbid printing the contact sheets.
 
3. Define your layout.
 
 In the Layout section, you choose how many thumbnails are in each row 
and column (Figure 16-18). You can choose to have the images added 
to the page row by row (the second image is to the right of the first) 
or column by column (the second image is directly below the first). 
You can also define the spacing between thumbnails, but the Use Auto-
Spacing option is almost always a safe choice. You can also elect to 
auto-rotate images so that, regardless of orientation, all the images are 
the same size. Do not select Repeat One Photo per Page when 
Figure 16-16: The options in Playback govern 
how the presentation will be displayed.

348
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
generating contact sheets. (With 
that option selected, instead of 
contact sheets you’ll have pages 
with multiple copies of one 
image).
 
 If your folder is filled with por-
trait-oriented images, you can 
certainly have more columns 
than rows so that each image 
better fills the area allotted for 
it. For example, when print-
ing 20 portrait images, using 5 
columns and 4 rows produces 
larger printed images than using 
4 columns and 5 rows.
 
4. Choose whether to use the file-
name as a caption.
 
 In the Overlays section (shown 
in Figure 16-19), you can elect 
to use the filename as a caption, 
with or without the file exten-
sion. If you use this option, be 
sure not to choose a font size 
too large to fit within the space 
Figure 16-17: Select the size and orientation of 
the contact sheets in Document.
Figure 16-18: Define the number of thumbnails 
and set the spacing (or use the convenient 
Auto-Spacing option).

order prints, but only you might need to see a 
file extension.

349
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop
allocated for each thumbnail! 
You can also add a page number 
in the header or footer of each 
document.
 
5. Add a watermark, header, or 
footer (or nothing).
 
 You also have the option of 
adding a watermark, as shown 
in Figure 16-20, but if it’s 
splashed across the middle of 
the page, it might serve little 
purpose. You can, however, add 
a line of text (your copyright 
info or a logo image, for exam-
ple) across each image as a bit 
of protection. More appropriate 
for a contact sheet might be a 
header or footer identifying you 
as the photographer and per-
haps mentioning the copyright 
status of your images, as well as 
a page number (selected in the 
Overlays section).
 
6. Preview and save.
 
 Click the Refresh Preview 
button (visible in Figure 16-20 
near the top) to get a look at 
what you’re creating, make any 
changes necessary, and then 
click the Save button. You next 
see a dialog box in which you 
name the document (Bridge 
automatically adds the .pdf file 
extension) and choose a loca-
tion in which to save. Bridge 
creates a multi-page PDF, gener-
ating as many pages as necessary to hold all of the selected thumbnails. 
Saving paper with 
picture packages
Using Bridge’s PDF-generation feature is also a great way to put multiple copies 
of an image on the same page for printing. Suppose you need to print a dozen 
copies of an image, each at 4 x 5 inches. Printing each on a separate sheet 
Figure 16-20: Adding a copyright notice across 
each image can serve as a reminder.

350
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
of paper takes 12 sheets (oh, the cost!) and 12 print cycles. Define a custom 
layout in Bridge’s Output panel (as shown in Figure 16-21) to put four 4 x 5 
images on a single Letter size page, and you use three sheets of paper and wait 
through only three print cycles. Um, let’s see, which do you want to do?
 
You have to do the math to get your picture packages to print at the size you 
want. In this example, I want 4 x 5 inch prints, so I split the difference between 
size of the prints and paper in the Top/Bottom and Left/Right margins.
Figure 16-21: Multiple images on a single page to create a picture 
package.
Creating Web Galleries
In Bridge’s Output panel, you can also generate galleries of your photos (see 
Figure 16-22). Create quick, yet elegant, stand-alone Web sites of your photos 
for posting on the Internet.
It takes only a few steps (okay, and a lot of experimentation) to create gor-
geous galleries to display your photos just the way you want them to be seen. 
Here’s what to do:
 
1. Select the thumbnails of the images you want to include.
 
 Hint: You must select the images; you can’t select only the folder. 
Bridge automatically skips any non-image files that are selected.
 
2. Select a template.
 
 To the upper-right in Figure 16-22, you can see the Template menu. 
Choosing the template that’s just right for you might take a number of 
experiments, but it’s certainly worth exploring each of them, one at a 
time.

351
 Chapter 16: Streamlining Your Work in Photoshop

3. Fill out the Site Info.
 
 This section is where you name the site, pro-
vide your contact info, and list the copyright 
notice (see Figure 16-23).
 
4. Choose colors for the gallery.
 
 The options in this section vary, depending 
on the template selected. Figure 16-24 shows 
what choices you’ll need to make when 
selecting the Standard template.
 
5. Fine-tune the appearance.
 
 The content of the Appearance section 
(Figure 16-25) also varies, depending on the 
selected template.
 
6. Preview.
 
 Click the Refresh Preview button (shown in 
the upper-right in Figure 16-22) to see the 
fruits of your decision-making process in 
steps 1–5. 
Figure 16-23: The Site Info sec-
tion provides your visitor with 
vital information.

352
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
You can also preview in your Web browsers, 
which can show you any potential problems 
with complex templates in certain browsers. 
It’s a great idea, too, to take the time to pre-
view each of the templates, perhaps using 
the default color schemes and appearance 
settings, just to get a feel for them.
 
 Bridge saves you time by only processing 
the first twenty of the selected images when 
generating a preview. When you finally have 
the gallery looking juuuust right and click the 
Save button, all of the selected images are 
processed.
 
7. Generate the gallery.
 
 Bridge offers you the option to save your gal-
lery to your hard drive or to directly upload 
it to the host Web server. The Web server is 
a computer owned by your Internet Service 
Provider (ISP). (Most Internet service agree-
ments these days include space on the 
servers for your personal home page.) 
Check with your ISP for specific upload 
instructions — the process varies quite a 
bit from ISP to ISP.
 
If you’d like to share a gallery with friends or clients but you don’t have a 
Web server, save the gallery to your hard drive, send the entire content of 
the folder you choose as the destination, and instruct the recipient to open 
the file named index.html using a Web browser’s File➪Open command.

have different components and 
differing color options.

CS5 Extended
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring Photoshop CS5 Extended
▶ Working in 32-bit color
▶ Stacking modes for Smart Objects
▶ Getting an overview of 3D, video, and analytical features
▶ Spelling out some new capabilities
You might have purchased Photoshop CS5 and are wondering about the 
features of Photoshop CS5 Extended. You might have received 
Photoshop CS5 Extended as part of a bundle or the Adobe 
Creative Suite and aren’t sure whether you need these fea-
tures. You might be browsing in the bookstore, trying 
to determine whether to purchase Photoshop CS5 or 
Photoshop CS5 Extended. (If this last scenario is the 
case, my advice to you is this: Purchase this book 
first and then, with any money you have left over, 
buy the version of Photoshop that best fits your 
needs. Read about the Extended features, and if 
you don’t need them, save some money and buy 
Photoshop CS5. And then buy lots more copies of 
this book to give to friends, family, and co-workers.)
In this chapter, I introduce you to the various spe-
cial features of Photoshop CS5 Extended. This chapter 
won’t get you fully up-to-speed on how to work with the 
features; instead, it’s meant to quench your curiosity about the 
difference between Photoshop CS5 and Photoshop CS5 Extended. 
(For an in-depth look at working with the special features of Photoshop CS5 
Extended, see Photoshop CS5 Bible, Professional Edition from Wiley.)

354
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Understanding Photoshop CS5 Extended
For years, Adobe has heard the pleas of researchers, scientists, and other 
highly specialized users of Photoshop to include features that fulfill their 
needs. Adobe now provides the tools these specialists need. But rather than 
just adding them into Photoshop CS5 and making everyone pay the costs 
for developing these features that few will use, Adobe packaged them as a 
separate, higher-priced version of the software. “Let those who need the new 
features subsidize their costs!” was the decision. And, in my opinion, it was a 
fine decision. As I explain, these extended features don’t really have a place 
in the workflow of most Photoshop users.
That doesn’t mean that if you do 
have Photoshop CS5 Extended that 
you’ll never use any of these fea-
tures! (“How do I know which ver-
sion I have?” Watch as Photoshop 
starts to see which splash screen 
appears.) Even if you didn’t specifi-
cally purchase the Extended version 
(it might have been part of a package 
deal), you might someday decide to 
work with 32-bit, high dynamic range 
images. Or you might find a need to 
calculate a height or a distance using 
the measuring tools in Vanishing 
Point. But unless you actually work directly in one of the target fields for 
the features of Photoshop CS5 Extended, you’re not likely to miss the addi-
tional capabilities at all. Another clue that you’re working in Photoshop CS5 
Extended is that you can see the Analysis and 3D menus, visible in Figure 
17-1, which contain commands related to working with the new measuring 
capabilities (discussed later in this chapter).
Painting and Layers in 32-Bit Color
One of the features of Photoshop CS5 Extended that appeals to some photog-
raphers is the ability to work with layers and painting tools in 32-bit color. 
With layers comes access to some blending modes, opacity, shape layers, 
and the Type tool. And, as you can see in Figure 17-2, 32-bit images can 
employ certain types of adjustment layers and a 32-bit Color Picker.
 
Although you can now create a 32-bit/channel high dynamic range (HDR) 
image through the File➪ New command, such images are generally the prod-
uct of the File➪Automate➪Merge to HDR feature. (See Chapter 20 for more 
on HDR photography.)
Figure 17-1: Photoshop CS5 Extended includes 
the Analysis and 3D menus.

355
 Chapter 17: Introducing Photoshop CS5 Extended
Figure 17-2: A 32-bit image can contain layers and adjustment layers, but only in the Extended 
version of Photoshop.
Smart Object Stack Modes
Working with Photoshop CS5 Extended, you can combine a number of images 
into a single stack as a Smart Object. Within the pile of images, you can 
determine how the pixels in each interact with those in the others. Select 
several related or contrasting images and add them as layers to a single 
image, select the layers, and create a Smart Object by choosing Layer➪Smart 
Objects➪Convert to Smart Object. Return to the Layer➪Smart Object sub-
menu and take a look at the Stack Modes submenu that’s now available. 
These options determine how the content on the layers within the Smart 
Object interact to produce the appearance of the Smart Object itself. (Not 
quite the same, but similar to the way layer blending modes help determine 
the overall appearance of your artwork.) You can find technical explanations 
of each option in Photoshop’s Help, but I show a couple of stacks as exam-
ples. On the left in Figure 17-3, you see a combination of the layers (shown to 
the left as thumbnails) using the stack mode Summation, which pretty much 
adds up all the lightness of each pixel in each channel, on each layer. To the 
right, several images shot for use with Merge to HDR are combined in a Smart 
Object using the stack mode Mean, which averages the values for each pixel 
in each channel. Not quite Merge to HDR, but with some planning and prep, it 
could be a supplemental technique.

356
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
Figure 17-3: A couple of different uses for stack modes.
Working with 3D Artwork
 
Photoshop CS5 Extended offers some more 3D capabilities, including repoussé 
(creating 3D meshes from 2D paths), more control over the spatial relation-
ships among objects, improved rendering, and generally improved perfor-
mance. Figure 17-4 shows many of the features available when working in 3D.
Figure 17-4: Tools, menus, and panels especially for working in 3D.

357
 Chapter 17: Introducing Photoshop CS5 Extended
 
If you’re interested in working with 3D in Photoshop, I highly recommend 
that you pick up a copy of a book that goes into more detail on the subject. 
(Let me recommend the Photoshop CS5 Bible from Wiley.)
Editing Imported Video
Photoshop CS5 Extended supports video layers — layers that contain actual 
video that you can edit and manipulate. (Obviously, you can’t print an image 
with playable video right on the page. Not on paper, anyway. But if you’re 
preparing something for the iPad, however, that’s another story!) The Layer 
menu’s Video Layers submenu offers a number of commands for inserting 
video clips, replacing existing clips, and inserting, duplicating, and deleting 
individual frames. But the heart of video in Photoshop CS5 Extended is the 
Animation (Timeline) panel (see Figure 17-5).
Figure 17-5: The Animation panel menu has many commands for editing video.

358
Part IV: Power Photoshop 
 
If the Layer➪Video Layers menu is grayed out, open the Animation panel’s 
menu and select Convert to Timeline or click the button in the lower-right 
corner of the Animation panel to toggle from the panel’s Frame Animation 
mode. Keep in mind, however, that converting the panel also converts any 
active video clips. Converting a video clip to frame-based animation uses 
only the keyframes, not all frames. If you want to generate a frame-based ani-
mation using all frames, choose File➪Import➪Video Frames to Layers.
Measuring, Counting, and Analyzing Pixels
Designed for researchers and scientists, the measuring capabilities in 
Photoshop CS5 Extended are quite powerful. You can measure just about 
anything and count the number of whatevers in a technical image, perhaps 
from a microscope or telescope.
Measuring length, area, and more
If you know the exact size of any element in an image, you can then dis-
cover just about anything you want to know about anything else in that 
image. The key is to set the measurement scale (Analysis➪Set Measurement 
Scale➪Custom), as shown in Figure 17-6.
In this example, we know the knee is 2.5 inches wide, and that the Ruler tool 
(nested in the Toolbox with the Eyedropper) was Shift+dragged over 138 
pixels. We can, therefore, set the scale to 138 pixels = 2.5 inches. You can add 
the measurement scale to the image (as an editable layer group) with the 
Analysis➪Place Scale Marker command.
Using any selection tool, we can isolate any part of the image, click the 
Record Measurements button in the Measurement Log panel (which you 
open, like any panel, through the Window menu), and we find out more than 
we ever wanted to know about that particular selection and its content. In 
addition to the fields visible in Figure 17-6, the Measurement Log can also 
track (among other things) the height, width, area, and perimeter length of 
the selection, as well as the minimum, maximum, mean, and median gray 
values within the selection.
After you have made and recorded all the various measurements you need, 
you can select all the lines in the Measurement Log (or only a few) and click 
the third button in the upper-right corner of the panel to export the data for 
use in a spreadsheet program.

359
 Chapter 17: Introducing Photoshop CS5 Extended
Figure 17-6: Drag a known distance; set the measurement scale.
Photoshop CS5 Extended also offers measurement in perspective through 
Vanishing Point. Suppose, for example, that for some reason or other you 
need to calculate how much wallpaper to order for the room shown in Figure 
17-7. You know the height of the window (70 inches) and, using that as your 
known measurement, you can have Photoshop calculate the height and 
length of each wall.
Counting crows or maybe avian flu
Nested with the Ruler tool and the Eyedroppers in the Toolbox is the Count 
tool. Zoom in and start clicking on whatever it is that you need to count, 
whether it’s birds in the sky or viruses on a slide. Each item you click is 
labeled with a number. When you want to record the count, click the Record 
Measurements button in the Measurement Log. You can also record and 
work with multiple counts. To the right of the Count Groups menu in the 
Options bar (see Figure 17-8) are buttons to show/hide the currently-selected 
count group, to start a new count group, and to delete the current count 
group. Click the color swatch in the Options bar to select a new color for the 
count group, and you can customize both the size of the circle that marks the 
count and the marker number — individually for each count group.

 Chapter 17: Introducing Photoshop CS5 Extended
 
(Don’t you love the way that Warning symbol in the margin catches your 
eye?) Adjust the marker and label sizes before you start clicking around in 
your image with the Count tool — changing the size after placing your count 
markers can shift them in the image window, destroying your meticulous 
placement.
Ignoring MATLAB, DICOM, and Other Initials
Photoshop CS5 Extended offers all of these interesting features for scientists, 
researchers, and technicians, so it only makes sense that it should work with 
some of the file formats they actually use and integrate with their software. 
When you come across the term MATLAB in Photoshop CS5 Extended, rec-
ognize it as a software environment (sort of like a programming language) 
that speeds calculations and helps coordinate work in various technical pro-
grams. Unless you actually work with MATLAB, say in a research lab, there’s 
nothing else you really need to know. (If you’re intrigued by the idea, visit 
www.mathworks.com.)
Another set of initials in Photoshop CS5 Extended might be of interest: 
DICOM (Digital Imaging and COmmunication in Medicine). If your doctor’s 
office, hospital, or lab has sent you home with a CD that contains the results 
of your CAT scan, MRI, ultrasound, or X-rays, you can open the files and take 
a look right in Photoshop. Copy the files to your hard drive. (Don’t open 
files into Photoshop directly from CD or DVD.) Choose File➪Open, and in 
the Open dialog box, select the frames in which you’re interested, and click 
Open. In the dialog box that opens (shown in Figure 17-9), select the frames, 
elect to open as layers in an image or in a grid pattern (N-Up), and open. (You 
can also use Photoshop’s File➪Place command to add a DICOM image to an 
existing image.)

Pete’s Top Ten Favorite Photoshop 
Tips and Tricks
In This Chapter
▶ Playing with artistic and creative tricks
▶ Exploring a few useful tips
I
 have literally thousands of Photoshop tips and tricks to share with you, 
but space here allows for only ten. Actually, just about anything you do that 
doesn’t use Photoshop’s default values or presets could be considered a tip or 
a trick. However, you’re likely interested in creative and productive shortcuts 
rather than something like this: Save copies of your custom brushes, styles, and 
other such bits and pieces somewhere other than the Photoshop folder so 
you don’t lose them should you ever need to reinstall the program. 
(Oops! I snuck in an extra tip, didn’t I?)
In this chapter, I present ten of my favorite creative 
and useful techniques. Some of these tricks I devel-
oped while helping solve problems in my role as 
Help Desk Director for the National Association of 
Photoshop Professionals (NAPP), and others are 
tried-and-true helpers that have been around for 
years.
Adding Artistic and Creative Effects
Surely you’d prefer to read Fill a layer with brown, use the 
Add Noise filter (Gaussian Distribution, Monochromatic), and 
then apply a Motion Blur filter to create a wood grain effect rather 
than If you need to apply a grayed-out filter to a CMYK image, apply it to one 
channel, and then the other three channels individually using Ô+F/Ctrl+F. (Now, 

366
Part V: The Part of Tens 
don’t consider those to be tips or tricks — remember that the chapter title 
says “Ten”!) Here are some of my favorite and most useful creative tips.
Smoothing skin perfectly
When you see glamour shots — you know, photos of The Beautiful People 
who look so absolutely perfect — one of the things you’re not seeing is 
the texture of the skin. No wrinkles. No creases. No pores? Indeed, the skin 
appears to be perfectly smooth (see Figure 18-1).
Figure 18-1: Use the Healing Brush and a plain-color source area to smooth skin.
Here’s how you can achieve that effect without blurring:
 
1. Open a copy of your image.
 
 Whenever you use a technique that makes permanent changes to the 
pixels in your image, you should work on a copy. That preserves the 
original image, which not only protects you from any errors that you (or 
Photoshop) might make but also keeps that original for different tech-
niques and tricks in the future. (For any sticklers counting the number 
of tips in this chapter, please note that little round thing to the left is a 
Warning, not a Tip.)

367
 Chapter 18: Pete’s Top Ten Favorite Photoshop Tips and Tricks
 
2. Add a new layer by clicking the New Layer button in the Layers panel.
 
3. Make a selection.
 
 The selection should be away from the face area, and sized at least one-
half the width and height of the face.
 
4. Fill the selection with color; then deselect.
 
 Press Option+Delete (Mac)/Alt+Backspace (Windows) to fill it with the 
foreground color (it doesn’t matter what color).
 
5. Select the Healing Brush and set the source point.
 
 Make sure that the Sample: All Layers option is selected in the Options 
bar and that Aligned is deselected. Option/Alt+click in the center of the 
filled selection. (You can disable the overlay in the Clone Source panel if 
you find the preview distracting.)
 
6. Paint over the skin.
 
 In the Layers panel, click on the lower layer, the original image layer, to 
make it active. Click and drag with the Healing Brush to smooth areas 
of skin. The Healing Brush replaces the texture of the skin (pores and 
all) with the texture of the source area (smooth). Use short strokes that 
follow the contour of the face. Make sure that you don’t paint over eye-
brows, nostrils, lips, and other areas of critical detail.
From a photo to a painting
You have dozens of ways to create a “painterly” effect in Photoshop. Here’s 
one of my favorites, as illustrated by Figure 18-2.
 
1. Open a copy of your image as a Smart Object.
 
 Choose File➪Open as Smart Object or, if the image is already open, 
choose Layer➪Smart Objects➪Convert to Smart Object. When working 
with Smart Filters, you can later — if necessary — re-open the filter and 
change the settings.
 
2. Select the shadows and blur.
 
 Open the Channels panel and Ô/Ctrl+click the RGB channel at the top 
to make a selection according to the brightness of each pixel. Use the 
shortcut Ô+Shift+I/Ctrl+Shift+I to invert the selection (select shadows 
rather than highlights). Apply a slight Gaussian Blur, perhaps 1 or 2 
pixels, to blur detail in the darker areas. (Remember that you can use 
the shortcut Ô+H/Ctrl+H to hide the “marching ants” and make the 
selection border disappear — and that’s not yet another tip!)

368
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 18-2: Blur shadows, sharpen highlights, and add texture for a “painterly” effect.
 
3. Select the highlights and sharpen.
 
 You need to reselect the highlights, so again Ô/Ctrl+click the RGB chan-
nel at the top. Apply the Sharpen➪Smart Sharpen filter with initial set-
tings of Amount: 200% and Radius: 2 pixels. (Adjust the values to match 
the content of your image and your artistic vision.)
 
4. Add a canvas texture to the image.
 
 Don’t deselect (so that the texture will be applied a bit more promi-
nently to the image’s highlights than to the shadows). Use the Texture➪
Texturizer filter to add a slight canvas texture, enhancing the painterly 
effect.
Creating a sketch from a photo
Simulating a painting in Photoshop is great, but sometimes you might need 
line art or a sketch. Photoshop has a couple of filters that do a nice job of 
creating pencil sketches, but none of them really do a great job with outlines. 
Here’s an easy way to create line art from a photo (see Figure 18-3).

369
 Chapter 18: Pete’s Top Ten Favorite Photoshop Tips and Tricks
Figure 18-3: You can use the versatile Smart Blur filter to produce line art from a photo.
 
1. Open a copy of your image and create a Smart Object.
 
 Again, open your image as a Smart Object or convert with the com-
mand Layer➪Smart Objects➪Convert to Smart Object. When working 
with Smart Filters, you can later — if necessary — re-open the filter and 
change the settings.
 
2. Apply the Smart Blur filter.
 
 Set the filter to Quality: High and Mode: Normal. Use settings that 
remove all the tiny detail in your image (such as pores and individual 
hairs or blades of grass) but maintain edges and major detail (such 
as eyes, noses, golf balls, and trees). If Smart Blur is grayed out, go to 
Image➪Mode and select 8-Bits/Channel.
 
3. Define edges with Smart Blur.
 
 Reopen the Smart Blur dialog box and set the Mode pop-up menu to 
Edge Only. Adjust the sliders until the white-on-black preview shows 
approximately the amount of detail you want in the final image; then 
click OK.

370
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
4. Invert the colors.
 
 Using the button at the bottom of the Layers panel or the Layer➪New 
Adjustment Layer menu, add an Invert adjustment layer. (Not only is it a 
good idea to use adjustment layers rather than adjustment commands, 
but you’ll find that you can’t use most adjustment commands with Smart 
Objects.)
 
5. Blur the lines.
 
 Click the Smart Object layer again in the Layers panel to make it active 
and apply a 1- or 2-pixel Gaussian Blur to soften the edges of the lines.
 
6. Adjust the thickness of the lines with a Levels adjustment layer.
 
 In the Levels dialog box, drag the middle slider control left and right 
until you’re satisfied with the image’s appearance. If desired, you can 
further refine the sketch with the Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask filter.
Creating snow or rain
Here’s a multi-use technique that you 
can use to create falling snow or rain 
(as shown in Figure 18-4):
 
1. Add a new layer to your image 
by clicking the New Layer 
button in the Layers panel.
 
2. Still in the Layers panel, 
change the layer’s blending 
mode from Normal to Screen.
 
 Because this technique uses a 
separate layer, you can consider 
it to be nondestructive (you can 
always delete the layer later), 
so you don’t have to work on 
a copy of your image. But it’s 
always a good idea to work on a copy, just in case.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Fill to fill the layer with black.
 
 Because the layer’s blending mode is Screen, you won’t see the black fill.
 
4. Add Noise to the layer.
 
 Use the Noise➪Add Noise filter to add some variation to the layer. Use 
Amount: 20%, Distribution: Gaussian, and mark the Monochromatic 
check box.
Figure 18-4: Use the Noise and Crystallize filters 
to produce snow or rain.

371
 Chapter 18: Pete’s Top Ten Favorite Photoshop Tips and Tricks
 
5. Enlarge the noise with the Crystallize filter.
 
 Use the Pixelate➪Crystallize filter to turn the little noise into larger 
chunks. Use Cell Size: 3 for small snow or rain; try 7 or 10 for larger 
flakes. You can also apply a slight Gaussian Blur to increase the size.
 
6. Sharpen the edges.
 
 Using the Unsharp Mask filter, sharpen until the snowflakes have dis-
tinct edges. Use Amount: 100%, Radius: 2, Threshold: 0. When you create 
rain, use Amount: 40%.
 
7. Apply a Levels adjustment.
 
 In the Levels dialog box, drag the middle slider about halfway to the 
left; then drag the left slider slowly to the right until you see the amount 
of snow or rain that you want. Afterward, if desired, you can apply the 
Motion Blur filter to the falling snow/rain. And, of course, you can add a 
layer mask to control visibility.
The Glass Text effect
Perfect for adding a large copyright notice right across the center of your 
image (while allowing the image’s beauty to still show through), this tech-
nique is so easy it doesn’t even need a step-by-step explanation. Simply type 
your copyright info or any other text and add a Bevel and Emboss layer style 
(perhaps with a slight Inner Shadow and maybe a 1-pixel black Stroke effect). 
Then, at the top of the Layers panel, reduce the Fill slider (not the Opacity 
slider) to 0 (zero). The pixels on the layer become transparent, but the layer 
style remains visible.
Useful Tricks to Make Life Easier
Here are five techniques that make life easier and your work look snappier 
and more professional.
Changing product colors in a snap
Use the Replace Color feature (in the Image➪Adjustments menu) to quickly 
and easily make variations of a single image by changing color. Replace Color 
is especially handy in production environments, letting you shoot one shot 
and produce numerous color variations. (See Figure 18-5.)

372
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Open Replace Color and Shift+drag 
the Eyedropper tool through the 
color you want to change. Adjust 
the Fuzziness slider to fine-tune 
the selection; then adjust the Hue/
Saturation and Lightness sliders to 
change the color.
 
If the target color appears in more 
than one part of the image, perhaps 
a red blouse and red lipstick, make a 
loose selection around the area you 
want to change (excluding the other 
areas) before opening Replace Color.
Deleting a plain white background
Lots of stock photographs come as a subject shot against a plain white back-
ground. Clip art also generally comes on a plain white background. Most 
of these images have clipping paths or alpha channels that you can use to 
extract the subject from the background to add it to another image. And 
when there is no path or channel? Open both images in Photoshop and drag 
the stock photo’s Background layer from the Layers panel to the window of 
the destination image. Make sure that the upper layer is active in the Layers 
panel and then open the Blending Options panel of the Layer Style dialog 
box. In the Blend If area at the bottom, drag the upper-right slider handle to 
the left until the upper layer’s white background is completely gone. (See 
Figure 18-6.)
Figure 18-6: Use the Blend If sliders to hide a white background.
Figure 18-5: The Replace Color adjustment 
makes quick work of color changes.

373
 Chapter 18: Pete’s Top Ten Favorite Photoshop Tips and Tricks
Quick and easy edge effects
Need some way to make your images stand out? Try this:
 
1. Add a new layer to your image by clicking the New Layer button in 
the Layers panel.
 
 To avoid making any permanent change to your image (primarily so you 
can change your mind about the border later), work on a new layer.
 
2. Select a border area around the image.
 
 Choose Select➪All and then choose Select➪Modify➪Border. Enter a 
value twice the width that you want for your edge effect.
 
3. Fill the selection with black, gray, or white.
 
• Black: Makes your image look brighter and more saturated
 
• Gray: Minimizes any perceived color shift
 
• White: Mutes the image somewhat but allows it to stand on its own
 
 Alternatively, use any color from the image (or its inverse).
 
4. Apply filters to the layer.
 
 Open the Filter Gallery and apply one or more filters to the border to 
create an interesting edge effect (such as the samples in Figure 18-7). 
Remember, too, that you can convert this layer to a Smart Object before 
applying filters so that you can later change your settings.
Not that this counts as an additional tip in this chapter, but remember that 
you can open this image, open another image of the same size, and drag the 
frame layer from the Layers panel of the first image to the window of the 
second image to duplicate it. Reusable frames!
Making dashed and dotted lines
Changing a couple of settings in the Brush panel enables you to create 
dashed and dotted lines with ease. In the Brush Tip Shape pane, increase 
Spacing to a value higher than 100% to separate the individual imprints of the 
brush tip (the brush tip instances). Switch to the Shape Dynamics pane and 
select Direction from the Control pop-up menu below the Angle Jitter option. 
Create a path (or make a selection and click the button at the bottom of the 
Paths panel that converts your selection to a work path), and then select 
Stroke Path from the Paths panel menu. Make sure the Brush tool is selected 
and click OK. You’ll find examples of stroked paths in Figure 14-3.

374

Figure 18-7: Filtering a border area creates interesting edge effects for your images.
Print multiple documents at the same time
You have a bunch of images to print from your latest job, but you also have 
a bazillion other things to do — you don’t want to sit at your computer and 
open one image, print, close, open the next image, print, close, open the next 
image, print, close, and so on, all afternoon long. Instead, use the Output 
panel in Bridge to create a multipage PDF document (see Chapter 16) and 
print all of the pages — all of your images — from Acrobat or Adobe Reader, 
without sitting around to babysit the computer!

Ten Reasons to Love 
Your Wacom Tablet
In This Chapter
▶ Considering reasons to use a tablet
▶ Setting up your tablet for efficient Photoshop work
D
rawing tablets from Wacom enable you to use a special stylus, which 
you hold like a pen or pencil or brush, to move the cursor (rather than 
using a mouse, track pad, or trackball). Some of Wacom’s Bamboo models 
enable you to control the cursor with Multi-Touch, much like an iPhone or 
iPad. There are several reasons why using a stylus is a huge improvement 
over a mouse, and I give you five to start off the chapter. Another 
five reasons you’ll love your Wacom tablet involve maximizing 
your efficiency; those reasons conclude the chapter.
More Natural Movement
Whether you use a pen only to sign your name or 
you’re a traditionally trained artist, the movement 
of a stylus is far more natural than pushing a mouse 
around a desk.
Health and Safety
Use of a drawing tablet instead of a mouse can help avoid 
repetitive stress injuries and carpal tunnel syndrome, and can 
be vastly more comfortable for those of us who suffer from arthritis 
and tendonitis.

376
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Artistic Control
With up to 2,048 levels of sensitivity, 
a “click” or a “drag” using a draw-
ing tablet is far more versatile than 
working with a mouse, especially 
when you’re working with the new 
Mixer Brush tool (which is intro-
duced in Chapter 14). Open the 
Photoshop Brushes palette and take 
a look at some of the eight different 
options that you can control through 
Pen Pressure, Pen Tilt, or (with the 
Wacom Airbrush) Stylus Wheel (see 
Figure 19-1). And don’t forget about 
tools that can be directly controlled 
with pen pressure, such as the Quick 
Selection tool, which can use pen 
pressure to adjust the brush 
diameter.
Extended Comfort
You can lean back and relax or sit up straight: With fingers poised over the 
keyboard or hand grasping mouse, you’re pretty much locked into a single 
position, often for hours at a time. With the long cord of a Wacom tablet 
plugged into a handy USB port, you have the flexibility to change positions, 
move back from the monitor, even slouch in a way that would make Mom 
turn pale — all while still sending input to the computer. Whether you work 
with the tablet on the desk or on your lap, it doesn’t matter; do whatever is 
most comfortable and efficient for you. 
Programmable ExpressKeys, Touch 
Rings, and Touch Strips
How about convenient controls, right on the tablet, that let you access modi-
fier keys, keyboard shortcuts, and even brush sizes and tool selection? No 
need to lean back in toward the desk to press a key or two; just program your 
most-needed keystrokes to the tablet. Keep in mind, too, that the Intuos line 
is southpaw-friendly — switch the USB cord and all the labels and controls 
conveniently flip over for lefties.
Figure 19-1: Scattering, Color Dynamics, and 
Transfer also have pen-controlled options.

377
 Chapter 19: Ten Reasons to Love Your Wacom Tablet
The Optimal Tablet
The inexpensive Bamboo series comes in several sizes and in Multi-Touch 
and pen models (as well as Multi-Touch and pen). The professional Intuos 
line includes four different sizes, with working areas (the active area) ranging 
from about 4 x 6 to more than 12 x 19 inches and 2,048 levels of sensitivity. 
The Cintiq line, which combines a pressure-sensitive tablet into a flat screen 
monitor, comes in 12-inch and 21-inch models.
If you have a fine-arts background, you might want a larger tablet. If you 
are not a traditionally-trained artist, you might be more comfortable with a 
smaller tablet, on which you can make smaller strokes. Regardless of what 
size tablet you have, don’t forget that you can zoom in on a specific area of 
your image while you work. (And keep in mind that you might also want to 
have a smaller tablet to slide right into your laptop case, too.)
The Pen’s Switch
Most (but not all) Wacom pens have a switch, called the DuoSwitch, right on 
the side that (by default) lets you right-click or double-click simply by rock-
ing the switch. Rather than tapping the pen twice on the tablet to double-
click (which could leave two spots of color if the Brush tool is active), simply 
press the DuoSwitch’s upper rocker. And, of course, you can program the 
DuoSwitch to other functions as well, such as a specific keystroke, a modifier 
key, even panning and scrolling.
Setting Preferences
After downloading and installing the latest version of the Wacom driver for 
your tablet, open the Control Panel and customize your tablet. (On a Mac, 
choose System Preferences➪Wacom Tablet. In Windows, choose Start➪All 
Programs➪Wacom Tablet➪Wacom Tablet Properties.) The Control Panel 
(see Figure 19-2) enables you to assign a specific function or keystroke to 
each of the ExpressKeys, Touch Ring, and Touch Strips, as well as program 
your various pens and mouse. (Options vary for Bamboo and Cintiq models.) 
Settings can be customized for Photoshop, Bridge, and even iTunes. You can 
share saved Preferences settings with friends and co-workers.
Don’t Forget the Accessories
Wacom offers a variety of pens, an airbrush, a five-button mouse, and even 
a CAD-friendly lens cursor to help you get the very most out of your tablet. 
Choose the input device that’s best for you — or switch among several, using 
the one that’s most appropriate for the specific job at hand.

378
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 19-2: Think about what keystrokes and functions are best assigned to the Intuos 4’s 
easy-to-reach ExpressKeys and Touch Ring.
Cintiq for the Ultimate Control
The ultimate tablets are, of course, 
the Cintiq tablets, which integrate 
a monitor into the tablet, enabling 
you to paint or draw directly on your 
image. Wacom offers Cintiqs in both 
12” and 21” (measured diagonally). 
And although $999 to $1,999 may 
seem like a lot of money for a tablet, 
it’s not too extreme when you con-
sider the money you may save by 
not purchasing a monitor. Whether 
you use the integrated stand and 
paint on your Cintiq on your desk 
(see Figure 19-3) or take advantage of 
the long cable and work with the dis-
play in your lap, you’re bound to find 
increased accuracy and productivity at your fingertips — literally!
 
Until you’re perfectly comfortable using a stylus and tablet, the Cintiq line 
might be a bit of a stretch. But after you’ve worked with the more affordable 
lines of tablets (Intuos and the entry-level Bamboo pen models), you may 
develop a craving for a Cintiq!

a standard monitor.

Ten Things to Know about HDR
In This Chapter
▶ Defining HDR
▶ Shooting for HDR
▶ Processing, saving, and outputting HDR
T
he world of photography continues to evolve at an amazing pace! It 
seems like just last edition of this book that I was trumpeting the advan-
tages of shooting digitally and working to convince people to switch from 
film. (Oh, yeah, that was the last edition of this book, wasn’t it?) It seems that 
the move to digital is nearly complete and it’s time to look to the future, just 
as I did when I urged the conversion to digital.
Understanding What HDR Is
HDR stands for high dynamic range. The dynamic range 
is the visual “distance” from black to white. By making 
that visual distance greater, you create a wider tonal 
range in the image. The world we see around us con-
tains far more range than can be reproduced on a 
monitor, printed to paper, or even saved in a 16-bit 
image. See Chapter 6 for an explanation of 8-bit, 
16-bit, and 32-bit color.
Consider, for example, shooting an image in a room 
with windows on a sunny day. If you expose your 
image for the content of the room, whatever is outside 
is blown out and completely white (see the examples in 
Figure 20-1). If you expose for the outside, the content of 
the room is in shadow. So, why not create an image in which the 
content of the room and the world outside the windows are both properly 
exposed?

Figure 20-1: You can expose for the room and lose the highlights, you can expose for the 
highlights and lose the room, or you can have both with HDR.
Is HDR “the future” of photography, the way digital has supplanted film? 
Probably not until we have cameras that can capture HDR images natively, 
as well as a way to better take advantage of the enhanced tonal range when 
printing. (If you’re a camera engineer, I might have a way to handle the first 
problem. Look me up, eh?) Is HDR something about which you should be 
aware, so that you can take advantage of its potential to meet difficult chal-
lenges in your own photography? Absolutely!
Capturing for Merge to HDR Pro
To merge several exposures into an HDR image, you need to have several 
exposures with which to work. There are two ways to meet the challenge: 
You can shoot a series of exposures, or shoot one Raw image and make sev-
eral copies with different Exposure values.
If you want the absolutely best results from Merge to HDR Pro, keep two words 
in mind: manual and tripod. Those are the keys to capturing multiple exposures 
for use with Merge to HDR Pro. The only variable you want to change from 
shot to shot is the camera’s shutter speed — everything else, including focus, 
should remain the same. Your tripod should be sturdy and level, and a cable 
release is a good idea. You can use auto focus and auto exposure to set the 
lens and get an exposure recommendation from the camera. But then switch 
the lens to manual focus and set the camera to manual exposure. Before each 
exposure, adjust only the shutter speed.
How many exposures do you need? I recommend a minimum of three (the 
best exposure possible for the scene, one “overexposed” for detail in the 
shadows, one “underexposed” for detail in the highlights). Each scene dif-
fers to some degree, but you’ll want to capture as much of the tonal range as 
possible. It is better, however, to use seven separate exposures with Merge 
to HDR Pro. More than that is rarely necessary, and most scenes can be cap-
tured in five exposures.

381
 Chapter 20: Ten Things to Know about HDR
If you are familiar with exposure values, try for a range of perhaps seven, 
including three below and three above the “optimal” exposure. If that’s unfa-
miliar territory, try shooting the optimal exposure, a shot at 1/4 the shutter 
speed of the first shot, and a shot at four times the original shutter speed.
 
Okay, so say that you don’t have a tripod and there’s a shot that’s just crying 
for HDR. Set your camera to auto-bracket at the largest increment possible, 
set the camera to “burst” mode, get as settled as possible, frame the shot, 
focus, take a deep breath, let the breath out halfway, pause, and press and 
hold the shutter button. In burst mode, three (or more, depending on your 
camera) shots are taken as quickly as the camera can operate. In auto-
bracket mode, the exposure is automatically changed for each shot. (Note 
that you need to set the camera to auto exposure bracketing, sometimes seen 
as AEB, not white balance bracketing. Check your camera’s User Guide.)
Preparing Raw “Exposures” in Camera Raw
Alternatively, and usually with quite good results, you can change the expo-
sure after the fact using Camera Raw. (You’ll want to use a Raw image, not a 
JPEG image, for this technique.) Here’s how:
 
1. Shoot the best exposure possible.
 
2. Transfer the image to your computer.
 
3. Open the image into Camera Raw. 
 
 Make sure that Camera Raw’s Workflow Options — click the blue line of 
info below the preview — are set to 16-bit color.
 
4. Adjust the image until it looks perfect.
 
5. Click the Open Image button to open from Camera Raw into Photoshop.
 
6. Copy the image into a new file and save in the TIFF format. Select➪All. 
Edit➪Copy. File➪New (the preset will be Clipboard, so just click OK). 
Edit➪Paste. Layer➪Flatten Image. File➪Save As, choose TIFF as the file 
format and save. Using this procedure strips out the EXIF data, making 
sure Merge to HDR Pro doesn’t use the wrong exposure value.
 
7. Reopen the original Raw file into Camera Raw.
 
8. Drag the Exposure slider to the left to reduce the exposure by 2.
 
 Two is just a general guideline — watch for maximum detail in the 
highlights.
 
9. Hold down the Option/Alt key and click Open Copy.
 
 This prevents Camera Raw from overwriting the earlier adjustment in 
the file’s metadata.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
10. Copy the image into a new file and save in the TIFF format. (Repeat 
Step 6.)
 
11. Reopen the Raw file into Camera Raw a third time.
 
12. Drag the Exposure slider to the right to increase the exposure by 2.
 
 Again, two is just a starting point — you want to see maximum detail in 
the shadows.
 
13. Hold down the Option/Alt button and click Open Copy.
 
14. Copy the image into a new file and save in the TIFF format (repeat 
Step 6.)
You can now use these three adjusted images in Merge to HDR Pro, as 
described in the following section. The results likely won’t be as great as 
using a series of separate exposures, but should be better than a single Raw 
exposure.
Working with Merge to HDR Pro
After you have the exposures from which you want to create your HDR mas-
terpiece, you need to put them together using Photoshop’s improved Merge 
to HDR Pro. 
You can open Merge to HDR Pro either through Photoshop’s File➪Automate 
menu or you can select the images to use in Bridge and use Bridge’s menu 
command Tools➪Photoshop➪Merge to HDR Pro. (If you open through 
Photoshop, you’ll either need to open the images into Photoshop first, or 
navigate to and select the images to use. If you browse, the files must all be in 
the same folder on your hard drive.)
Be patient with Merge to HDR Pro — it has a lot of work to do before you get 
to play with the combined exposures. When the calculations are done, the 
Merge to HDR Pro window opens (as shown in Figure 20-2).
Each of the images used in the merge is shown as a thumbnail below the pre-
view. You can deselect each image to see what impact it has on the combined 
exposure. (After you click on the green check mark, give Merge to HDR Pro 
a couple of moments to redraw the preview.) If you’re working with seven 
exposures and one seems to degrade from the overall appearance, leave that 
thumbnail’s box deselected.
By default, Merge to HDR Pro assumes that you want control over the image 
right away and sets the Mode menu to 16-bit color. You then have the options 
shown in Figure 20-2, as well as a few others, including the Curve panel (as 
shown in Figure 20-3).

383
 Chapter 20: Ten Things to Know about HDR
Figure 20-2: Merge to HDR Pro opens after the images have been processed.
So, what are all those options you see in Figure 20-2 and Figure 20-3?
 
✓ Preset: If you have a series of similar images that require the same 
adjustments, you can save and load presets.
 
✓ Remove Ghosts: When you’re capturing multiple exposures, especially 
outdoors, moving objects in your image may have left “ghosts” behind. 
This option helps minimize those moving objects.
 
✓ Edge Glow: Use the Radius and Strength sliders in combination to 
increase the perceived sharpness of the image.
 
✓ Tone and Detail: Think of the Gamma slider as your contrast control. 
Dragging to the right flattens the contrast between highlights and shad-
ows, dragging to the left increases the contrast. The Exposure slider 
controls the overall lightness (to the right) or darkness (to the left) of 
the image, just like the more familiar Exposure slider in Camera Raw. 
The Detail slider sharpens the smallest bits in the image. The Shadow 
and Highlight sliders control the lower and upper parts of the image’s 
tonal range. For both sliders, dragging left darkens and dragging right 
lightens.

384
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 20-3: In 16-bit mode with Local Adaptation, you have quite a bit of control.
 
✓ Color: Visible in Figure 20-2, Color shares space with Curve in Local 
Adaptation. The Vibrance slider controls the saturation of the near-neu-
tral colors and Saturation controls all of the colors in the image. (These 
sliders, too, are comparable to their counterparts in Camera Raw and 
are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Curve: Click on the curve (visible in Figure 20-3) to add an anchor point 
and drag up/down or enter numeric values to adjust the tonality of the 
image. The Corner option produces a sharp change in the angle of the 
curve, which is generally not desirable. The button to the right of Corner 
resets the curve.
Switching the Mode menu to 32-bit color restricts you to adjusting the 
preview — anything else will be done in Photoshop after you click Merge to 
HDR Pro’s OK button. (The entire expanded tonal range is still in the 32-bit 
image, it’s just the preview that you’re adjusting.) Using options other than 
Localized Adaptation in 16-bit mode give you less (or no) control over the 
conversion from 32-bit color.

385
 Chapter 20: Ten Things to Know about HDR
Figure 20-4: HDR Toning offers the same options as Merge to HDR Pro’s 16-bit mode, but in 
32-bit color.
In 32-bit mode, you have a simple slider to adjust the preview; 16-bit mode’s 
Exposure and Gamma sliders control the overall tonal range and the contrast 
between shadows and highlights.
Note that 16-bit and 8-bit offer the same options, but I don’t recommend con-
verting from 32-bit to 8-bit in Merge to HDR Pro. If you need an 8-bit version 
of the image, work in16-bit, and then after perfecting the image in Photoshop 
and saving as 16-bit, use the command Image➪Mode➪8-Bits/Channel to con-
vert and Save As (or Save for Web and Devices) to save the 8-bit copy.
 
Remember that when the changes you make in Merge to HDR Pro’s 16-bit mode 
are finalized, the unused parts of the 32-bit tonal range are discarded. Working 
in 16-bit mode in Merge to HDR Pro can be convenient, but you can also stay 
in 32-bit mode, open into Photoshop with the OK button, save the 32-bit image, 
and then do all the adjusting available in Merge to HDR Pro — and much more — 
in Photoshop. Want to fine-tune or change the image sometime down the road? 
Sure, why not? Simply reopen the saved 32-bit image and re-adjust, paint, filter, 
whatever, and then save again. Need a 16-bit copy to share or print? Save first as 
32-bit, adjust, and then use Save As to create the 16-bit copy.

386
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Saving 32-bit HDR Images
A 32-bit image can be saved in a number of file formats, including Photoshop’s 
PSD and Large Document Format (PSB), as well as TIFF and some specialized 
formats. Unless you’re sending the image to another program (perhaps when 
working with computer animation) or a client who has requested a specific 
format, stick with PSD, PSB, or TIFF.
HDR Toning
Found in the Image➪Adjustments menu, HDR Toning (see Figure 20-4) 
is your 32-bit image adjustment master tool. It offers the same Local 
Adaptation, Equalize Histogram, Exposure and Gamma, and Highlight 
Compression options found in Merge to HDR Pro. (Each of the options is 
described in the “Working with Merge to HDR Pro” section of this chap-
ter.) Although it’s also available for 16-bit and 8-bit images, HDR Toning 
is designed to work with the 32-bit images you create with Merge to HDR 
Pro. You’ll also see HDR Toning when you convert to 16-bit or 8-bit color 
through the Image➪Mode menu.
Painting and the Color Picker in 32-bit
If you have Photoshop CS5 Extended, you can paint in 32-bit color. The 
Brush, Pencil, and Mixer Brush tools (but not Color Replacement) are 
available. The Blur, Sharpen, and Smudge tools are also available in 32-bit 
color, but not Dodge, Burn, or Sponge. Type layers, shape layers, and paths 
are also at your command. You can add color to a 32-bit image with the 
Gradient tool, but not the Paint Bucket. And although the History Brush 
is available, the Art History Brush is not, nor are the Healing Brush, Spot 
Healing Brush, Patch tool, or Red Eye tool. 32-bit images can have multiple 
layers and layer styles, too. Be aware, too, that not all blending modes are 
available in 32-bit color. Normal, Darken, Multiply, Lighten, Difference, and 
about a dozen less commonly used blending modes are enabled for tools 
and layers.
Working with painting tools and gradients requires a way to define color in 
32-bits. When you open the Color Picker while working with a 32-bit image, 
you’ll see something different. In Figure 20-5, the 32-bit Color Picker shows 
some additional features. In addition to working with HSB and RGB fields, 
color is defined with the Intensity slider. Think of “intensity” as “exposure.” It 
permits color values that go beyond RGB’s 255/255/255. Define the color and 
choose how light or dark the exposure is — it’s sort of a fourth dimension of 
color definition.

387
 Chapter 20: Ten Things to Know about HDR
The bar at the top shows the last-selected color below and the current selec-
tion above. You can click on any of the size previews to the left or the six to 
the right to jump to that color. You control how different each of the 12 pre-
views is from the current color with Preview Stop Size.
Figure 20-5: The incredible range of 32-bit color requires a 
new way to define “color.”
Filters and Adjustments in 32-bit
The list of filters available in 32-bit color is even shorter than the list for 
16-bit color. Lens Correction, Liquify, and Vanishing Point won’t work in 
32-bit color, but you do have the key Blur and Sharpen filters, as well as 
Add Noise, Clouds and Difference Clouds, Lens Flare, Emboss, High Pass, 
Maximum, Minimum, and Offset. Don’t forget that 32-bit images can be con-
verted to Smart Objects to apply Smart Filters!
The only adjustment layers that can be added to 32-bit images are Levels, 
Exposure, Hue/Saturation, Photo Filter, and Channel Mixer, along with Solid 
Color, Gradient, and Pattern layers. In the Adjustments menu, you’ll also find 
HDR Toning and Desaturate at your service.

388
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Selections and Editing in 32-bit
Not surprisingly, the Rectangular Marquee, Elliptical Marquee, Single Row, 
Single Column, Lasso, and Polygon Lasso tools are available when working 
in 32-bit color because they simply create selections around pixels. Also not 
surprising is the unavailability of the Magnetic Lasso tool because it works its 
magic based on identifying differences between neighboring colors. And, on the 
subject of magic, the Magic Wand is also out of commission when working in 
32-bit color. But you can work with the Quick Selection tool in your HDR image.
And after you have made your initial selection, you’ll find that Refine Edge 
is fully functional in 32-bit color, as are the Select➪Modify commands and 
Transform Selection. You can also save and load selections (alpha channels) 
and work in Quick Mask mode in 32-bit images.
Printing HDR Images
Okay, well, you can’t really print the entire tonal range of a 32-bit image — no 
printer (or paper) can handle the range. In fact, you can’t print an image in 
32-bit color at all from Photoshop (the Print and Print One Copy commands 
are grayed out). What you can do is print a 16-bit (or 8-bit) image that has 
outstanding highlights, outstanding shadows, and outstanding midtones.
After saving the 32-bit original, use Photoshop’s Image➪Mode➪16-Bits/
Channel command to convert to 16-bit color (using Local Adaptation). After 
changing the color depth, use Image➪ Image Size to set your desired print 
size. You can either uncheck the Resample box and enter your desired print 
dimensions, letting Photoshop calculate the new resolution, or you can use 
the Resample option and input both the print dimensions and resolution. If 
you’re increasing the pixel dimensions up to 200%, set Resample to Bicubic 
Smoother. If you’re reducing the pixel dimensions or increasing the pixel 
dimensions by more than 200%, use Bicubic Sharper. (In 32-bit color, the only 
resampling algorithms available are Nearest Neighbor and Bilinear, neither of 
which is appropriate for most photos.)
When the image is ready, open Photoshop’s File➪Print window. Choose the 
printer and click the Print Settings button to set up the printer. Choose the 
specific paper on which you will be printing and disable the printer’s color 
management. Choose the printer’s resolution and — if your printer has the 
capability — select 16-Bit Output.

389
 Chapter 20: Ten Things to Know about HDR
To the right in Photoshop’s Print dialog box, make sure that Photoshop is 
managing colors and that you have selected the printer’s own profile for the 
specific paper on which you are printing. Generally you should use the Relative 
Colorimetric rendering intent and Black Point Compensation. (Note that if your 
print is way too dark, Black Point Compensation should be disabled.)
 
With Photoshop CS5, you need to make all of the printer-specific choices 
by clicking the Print Settings button. After you click Photoshop CS5’s Print 
button, the image data is sent directly to the print driver; the printer’s own 
Print dialog box does not appear.
If you want to save this 16-bit version of the image, use Save As to create a new 
file. Using the Save command would overwrite the 32-bit original HDR image.
And there you have it — ten things you should know about HDR. You’re now 
ahead of the curve and ready for the Next Big Thing in digital photography!
On behalf of everyone involved with the production of this book, let me say 
thanks for coming along for the ride. We wish you peace, love, health, and 
happiness!
