Preface
Die Lehrer der verschiedenen mathematischen ¨Ubungen began-
nen ihren Kursus, mit wenigen Ausnahmen, durch einige magere

Gottfried Keller, Der gr¨une Heinrich
The holomorphic discs in the title of this book refer to a mathematical object
that is, strictly speaking, neither holomorphic nor a disc. This is in accordance
with the principle, as laid down by [Hirsch 1976], that “in mathematics a red
herring does not have to be either red or a herring”.
By discs we mean smooth maps deﬁned on the unit disc in the complex
plane C, taking values in some manifold. We shall be speaking of curves as smooth
maps deﬁned on a domain (or its closure) in the complex plane1. More generally,
the domain of deﬁnition may be a Riemann surface (possibly with boundary); such
curves will not be considered in the present text, though.
The usage of the word holomorphic requires a more detailed explication.
In the strict sense of the word, this refers to curves where the target space is a
complex manifold, and the map satisﬁes the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Equiva-
lently, these are maps whose diﬀerential at any point of the domain of deﬁnition
is a complex linear map. In the main body of the text, we shall adhere to this
narrow interpretation of the word ‘holomorphic’.
The holomorphic discs of the title in point of fact refer to the more general
pseudoholomorphic or J-holomorphic maps. The idea behind this concept is quite
simple. In order to speak sensibly of maps with complex linear diﬀerential, there is
no need for (local) complex coordinates on the target space. All that is required is
a notion of complex multiplication on each tangent space, which is precisely what
an almost complex structure J on a manifold amounts to. (In two real dimensions,
any almost complex structure comes from complex coordinates, thanks to the
existence of isothermal coordinates2 for any conformal structure; for this reason
we need not consider a wider class of domains of deﬁnition.)
Beware that many authors nowadays use ‘holomorphic curve’ with the latter,
wider meaning. To keep the title of this book snappy, we have done the same there,
but there only.
The ground-breaking observation in [Gromov 1985] was that pseudoholomor-
phic curves share many desirable features with holomorphic curves, provided that
the almost complex structure J is compatible, in a sense to be deﬁned, with a sym-
plectic form ω (that is, a closed nondegenerate diﬀerential 2-form). This includes
1Except when, as will be clear from the context, we are speaking of real curves deﬁned on
intervals in the real line.

them being minimal surfaces, and energy estimates that guarantee the compact-
ness of certain ‘moduli spaces’ of pseudoholomorphic curves. Such compactness
results pave the way for cobordism- or degree-theoretic topological arguments.
Gromov’s ﬁrst application of the theory of pseudoholomorphic curves in sym-
plectic manifolds was the nonsqueezing theorem, which may be regarded as the big
bang for the new ﬁeld of symplectic topology.
Symplectic geometry is a time-honoured subject, as it provides the mathe-
matical framework for classical mechanics; see [Arnol’d 1989]. Liouville’s theorem
on the preservation of volume in phase space is in fact a statement about symplec-
tic mappings. The nonsqueezing theorem demonstrates that symplectic mappings
are considerably more restrained than volume-preserving ones. It says that one
cannot squeeze a ball (in the standard symplectic space R2n) into a cylinder of
smaller radius by a symplectic embedding.
Outline of the text
The book you hold in your hands (if you are an old-fashioned reader) presents
a complete proof of the nonsqueezing theorem. In Chapter I we expand on the
classical context just mentioned and introduce all the concepts required to give a
precise formulation of the theorem and a sketch of its proof.
The later chapters successively ﬁll in the details of this proof. Given a sym-
plectic embedding of a ball of radius r into a cylinder of radius R, the aim is to
show that r ≤R. Ultimately, the proof boils down to establishing the existence
of a J-holomorphic disc passing through the centre of the embedded ball, and
whose boundary is mapped to the boundary of the cylinder. The almost complex
structure J in question is adapted to the embedding of the ball. Energy estimates
and an isoperimetric inequality for holomorphic discs then combine to yield the
desired inequality on the radii.
The existence of such a disc rests crucially on the properties of the mod-
uli space of all pseudoholomorphic discs with boundary behaviour as described.
Broadly speaking, chapters II and III are devoted to establishing the compactness
of this space; chapter V deals with the manifold property of this space. A major
complication in the proof stems from the fact that one cannot work solely within
the framework of smooth discs, as spaces of smooth maps fail to be Banach mani-
folds. Chapter IV shows how to resolve this issue by considering spaces of weakly
diﬀerentiable pseudoholomorphic curves and then establishing regularity results
for such curves.
The nonsqueezing theorem is very easy to state, and the formidable mathe-
matical eﬀort we need to expend on its proof may seem surprising and daunting.
In order to assuage the intellectual strain, at several places in the text we pause
to explain why one cannot do without the intricate, mostly analytic tools that we
introduce.

The rationale for this text
Beautiful and unexpected as the nonsqueezing theorem may be, its proof should
not be regarded as an end in itself. We principally take Gromov’s theorem as
a motivation to explore the powerful tools it calls for. As the title of the book
suggests, the true aim of this text is to provide a self-contained, comprehensive, and
yet concise introduction to the theory of pseudoholomorphic curves. This theory
has become indispensable in symplectic topology, and we develop its basics in
suﬃcient generality for the method to be widely applicable. The special emphasis
on discs leads us to analyse boundary behaviour in considerable detail.
In our education of students we have, for a long time, felt a dearth of texts
on pseudoholomorphic curves to which we could unhesitatingly direct them for
instruction and ediﬁcation. The exhaustive monograph [McDuﬀ& Salamon 2012]
contains everything a seasoned researcher may be looking for, but it is a steep
climb3 for a beginner. The books [Wendl 2018] and [Wendl 2020] stem from mini-
courses or lectures for a relatively mature audience, focus on speciﬁc themes, and
are brief on the mathematical basics. The beautiful and impressive Diplomarbeit
[Hummel 1997] contains a proof of the compactness theorem (for closed curves),
and we have used parts of it in this text, but it never pretends to cover all fun-
damentals of pseudoholomorphic curves theory. Hummel’s thesis takes Gromov’s
diﬀerential geometric approach via hyperbolic surfaces, whereas we follow a more
analytical line of argument, based on ideas developed by Helmut Hofer.
The present text began its life as a set of notes prepared by the second-named
author for a one-semester course taught at the Westf¨alische Wilhelms-Universit¨at
M¨unster in 2015 to an audience of Master and doctoral students. Since then, we
have taught from and — with the assistance of our students — improved upon
these notes in courses and seminars at the Justus-Liebig-Universit¨at Gießen, Ruhr-
Universit¨at Bochum, and the Universit¨at zu K¨oln.
During the conversion of the handwritten notes into a typed text, while
preserving the overall structure of the course, we added some background material
(e.g. on Fredholm operators), shed light into some black boxes (such as the Banach
manifold property of spaces of maps), and polished the arguments in various places.
This book is meant to serve two purposes. On the one hand, the text is
structured so as to be suitable for self-study. On the other, we hope that this text
will inspire colleagues to teach their own students from it. For this reason, we have
tried to stay true to the spirit of the course from which this text originates. The
scores of exercises throughout the text, some from our teaching, some added as
the notes expanded, should be helpful for either purpose.
3Our text, by comparison (and with apologies to Felix Schlenk), is intended to feel like a
gentle hike on Uetliberg; cf. reference [13] in [Cieliebak et al. 2007].

Preface
Discs versus spheres
This section is for readers who already have some familiarity with symplectic and
contact topology.
Gromov’s original proof of the nonsqueezing theorem works with a partial
compactiﬁcation S2
R/2 ×R2n−2 of the cylinder B2
R ×R2n−2, and then utilises pseu-
doholomorphic spheres. As mentioned earlier, our proof instead studies pseudo-
holomorphic discs whose boundary lies on the boundary of the cylinder. Arguably
this is a more natural approach.
Pseudoholomorphic discs made their ﬁrst appearance in applications to con-
tact topology, where one works with the symplectisation of a contact manifold.
This symplectisation carries an exact symplectic form and therefore does not ad-
mit nonconstant closed pseudoholomorphic curves such as spheres. A compre-
hensive monograph on the use of pseudoholomorphic discs in contact topology is
[Abbas & Hofer 2019].
The ideas for ﬁlling cylinders with discs, again in the context of contact
topology (and Reeb dynamics), go back to [Eliashberg & Hofer 1994]. That paper
mostly dealt with 3-dimensional contact topology; in [Geiges & Zehmisch 2016]
we extended the theory to higher-dimensional contact manifolds.
There, we also systematically began to explore degree-theoretic arguments
for pseudoholomorphic discs — here, the content of Chapter V — that originate
(for spheres) from [McDuﬀ1991]. Again for spheres, this was developed further in
[Barth, Geiges & Zehmisch 2019].
In [Eliashberg & Hofer 1994] and [Geiges & Zehmisch 2016] the use of discs
was necessitated by the contact-geometric setting. In the symplectic setting, pseu-
doholomorphic discs were used in [Gromov 1985] to deal with Lagrangian sub-
manifolds. The present text might also serve to encourage more mature readers to
revisit some of the results in this area, and to ﬁnd other applications of pseudo-
holomorphic discs in symplectic topology.
An interesting variation on the theme of pseudoholomorphic discs can be
found in [Sukhov & Tumanov 2014].4 There, the authors establish the existence of
pseudoholomorphic discs — and use this to give a proof of Gromov’s nonsqueezing
theorem — by solving a vector analogue of the classical Beltrami equation. For
analytical reasons in dealing with the boundary problem, the authors replace the
round cylinder with a cylinder having a triangular base.
For further reading on applications of pseudoholomorphic discs we modestly
suggest [Geiges & Zehmisch 2010], where we ﬂeshed out an idea by Eliashberg to
give a contact-geometric proof of Cerf’s theorem that every diﬀeomorphism of
the 3-sphere S3 extends to a diﬀeomorphism of the 4-ball. This proof relies on a
‘ﬁlling’ of S3 ⊂C2 by holomorphic discs, i.e. discs in the 4-ball with boundary
on S3, adapted to a contactomorphism of the standard contact structure5 on S3.
In [Geiges & Zehmisch 2013], more generally, we studied the ﬁlling of symplec-

tic cobordisms with pseudoholomorphic discs. This allowed us to give a uniﬁed
treatment of some ‘classical’ results in symplectic and contact topology (including
Reeb dynamics). A number of arguments developed in these papers have found
their way into the presentation here.
Mathematical prerequisites
The theory of pseudoholomorphic curves draws on methods and results, some of
them quite deep, from diverse areas of mathematics. We have tried to develop
the theory from ﬁrst principles wherever feasible, but it is impossible to include
everything without the book becoming encyclopaedic.
The ﬁrst two chapters can probably be understood with little more than a
background in complex analysis. In fact, we have read this part proﬁtably (for
all involved) with students in the third and ﬁnal year of their Bachelor stud-
ies. Advanced calculus, which German students take in their second and third
semesters, is taken for granted. This includes concepts such as (sub-)manifolds,
tangent spaces, diﬀerential forms, and Stokes’s theorem (especially in the diver-
gence version known as the theorem of Gauß).
Everything we require from point-set topology can be found in [J¨anich 1996]:
compactness vs. sequential compactness, continuity vs. sequential continuity, ﬁrst
and second countability axioms for topological spaces.
Concerning analysis on manifolds, we freely (but sparingly) use concepts such
as the ﬂow of a vector ﬁeld and the Lie derivative (including Cartan’s formula).
Where possible, we provide alternative and more elementary arguments.
The remaining chapters require some basic concepts and results from linear
functional analysis, such as Banach spaces, bounded (a.k.a. continuous) linear
operators, and the open mapping theorem. In a few places, and in passing, we quote
the Hahn–Banach theorem. Everything we use can be found in the undergraduate
text [Bollob´as 1999] or the slightly more advanced [Hirzebruch & Scharlau 1971].
We need much less than these books cover. For instance, all the prerequisites from
Fredholm theory are introduced in Chapter V, even though they can be found in
the text by Hirzebruch and Scharlau.
As concerns Sobolev spaces, some acquaintance with the fundamental con-
cepts in [Adams & Fournier 2003] is certainly a boon, but not required. We quote
without proof some Sobolev inequalities and embedding theorems, but the theory
of weakly diﬀerentiable functions is developed from scratch in Chapter IV.
From diﬀerential geometry, we use the concept of geodesics without expla-
nation, but we do discuss the exponential map — the only reason we need to
talk about geodesics — in detail. We also use some concepts from elementary
diﬀerential geometry such as the curvature of plane curves.
Concerning diﬀerential topological methods, we occasionally apply them with-
out being overly loquacious. Books such as [Br¨ocker & J¨anich 1973], [Hirsch 1976],
or [Wall 2016] cover much more than what is needed here, but a certain acquain-
tance with one of these books certainly helps to smooth some corners in the text.

Preface
The mapping degree theory in Chapter V is developed in detail, following a dif-
ferential topological route. The alternative approach, using homological methods,
is sketched for readers familiar with the relevant algebraic topology.
No previous knowledge of symplectic geometry is assumed.
A guide for the reader and the lecturer (and a little rant)
In the German Diplomstudiengang of lore — before it was scrapped by EU bu-
reaucrats and an overambitious federal minister of education, misappropriating the
name of a renowned Italian university town6 for a process of intellectual vandal-
ism7 — a course such as this would have, we believe, been welcomed by students as
a challenging treat in their ﬁnal year, even if few of them would have elected it as
part of their oral Diplompr¨ufung. In this day and age of credit points, international
‘harmonisation’ of educational systems, and curricula geared towards ‘employabil-
ity’, the situation is a little more vexatious. (We hear an inner voice quoting from
Christian Morgenstern’s Der Ginganz: “Der Knecht wirft beide Arm’ empor, als
wollt’ er sagen: Laß doch, laß!”)
On the positive side, even if occasionally we may have been carried away by
romanticised conceptions of what students ‘in the old times’ were like (including
an idealised view of our own student days), we have been rewarded by students
who have put in to some extent ‘voluntary’ work in reading parts of this text in
various seminars and Arbeitsgemeinschaften, the latter our own humble version of
the seminar concept designed by Felix Klein.
That being said, our text can be used in a variety of settings. First and
foremost it can naturally be the basis for a one-semester course of four hours per
week, like the one from which these notes originate. The book now contains slightly
more material than can reasonably be covered in such a course, and the selection
of parts to exclude can be made dependent on the students’ background.
Section I.6 is optional, as it will not be used anywhere else. Some of the more
gruesome analytical details in Chapters III and IV, such as in Section IV.3.5,
should probably be skimmed. A few parts of the material in Section IV.1, notably
the discussion of manifolds of maps, may safely be put back into a black box or
left as vocational reading. The selection of topics in Chapter V may depend on
whether the students have been educated more thoroughly in either functional
analysis or diﬀerential topology.
Alternatively, one can cover selected parts of the book in student seminars. As
already mentioned, the ﬁrst two chapters lend themselves to a seminar following a
ﬁrst course on complex analysis. Other parts can be used for seminars on functional
analysis or diﬀerential topology.
We have placed well over a hundred exercises throughout the text rather
than at the end of sections or chapters. They form an integral part of the course.
6The university of Bologna, founded in 1088, is the oldest university in Europe.
7A declaration that speciﬁes objectives to be reached “within the ﬁrst decade of the third
millennium” is, in our view, more than just a little grandiose.

Indeed, many exercises ask for ﬁlling in smaller details of proofs, and in this way
provide an important self-assessment for the lone reader.
The sources we consulted
With a course that has developed over several years, it has become shrouded by
the mists of time exactly which sources were of help in writing certain parts of the
text. We make only modest claims to originality.
The initial design of the course and the approach to the nonsqueezing theorem
via discs have been inspired by unpublished notes of Helmut Hofer, some of which
made their way into [Abbas & Hofer 2019]. A copy of [McDuﬀ& Salamon 2012]
was of course always at hand during the writing. The proof of the monotonicity
lemma in Section I.4.3 closely follows [Hummel 1997]. For writing Section V.5 on
the Floer space of almost complex structures we reread the thesis [Schwarz 1995].
Course notes by Kai Cieliebak on nonlinear functional analysis were of great help
in writing Section IV.1. We also used lecture notes by Joa Weber on Sobolev spaces
to streamline parts of the discussion in Section IV.2.
For cultural reasons, in the bibliography we have not replaced the German
texts we consulted with English ones. The reader will easily ﬁnd equivalent sources
in his favourite language.

Chapter I
Gromov’s Nonsqueezing
Theorem
And now, if e’er by chance I put
My ﬁngers into glue,
Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
Into a left-hand shoe.
Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass
The theorem in the title is the protagonist of this text. We state it in Sec-
tion I.3 and present a sketch proof, where (pseudo-)holomorphic discs make their
ﬁrst appearance. This is preceded by a section on Liouville’s theorem in classical
mechanics, which serves as a motivation to study properties of symplectic maps;
these we deﬁne in Section I.2.
Geometrically, the proof of the nonsqueezing theorem rests crucially on two
estimates. One is a lower bound on the area of certain holomorphic curves. This
bound is derived from a monotonicity formula (Section I.4) and an isoperimetric
inequality (Section I.5). The monotonicity lemma is an expression of the fact that
holomorphic curves are minimal surfaces. Although our argument does not rely
explicitly on this minimality property, in Section I.6 we explain this connection.
The second geometric input is a computation of the symplectic energy of
certain J-holomorphic curves, that is, curves that are ‘holomorphic’ with respect
to an almost complex structure J. Section I.7 is devoted to the relevant space
of almost complex structures, which is foundational for the study of the ‘moduli
space’ of J-holomorphic discs. The proof of the nonsqueezing theorem rests on
an abundance of such discs. The ﬁrst basic properties of this moduli space are
discussed in Section I.8; this section includes the energy calculation mentioned
above.

Chapter I. Gromov’s Nonsqueezing Theorem
I.1
Liouville’s theorem in Hamiltonian mechanics
The time evolution of many classical mechanical systems, such as a simple pendu-
lum or, more interestingly, a number of celestial bodies under mutual gravitational
attraction, is governed by a set of diﬀerential equations known as Hamilton’s equa-
tions. For an elementary derivation of these equations from a variational principle,
see [Geiges 2016, Chapter 9]. The geometric ideas behind Hamiltonian mechanics
are beautifully elucidated in [Levi 2014].
The bare-bones description of Hamilton’s equations that follows merely serves
to provide the terminology for formulating Liouville’s theorem — in its simplest
version — on the preservation of volume in phase space.
We are considering R2n = Rn ⊕Rn with Cartesian coordinates (x, y). In the
physical interpretation, x = (x1, . . . , xn) is regarded as a point in the conﬁgura-
tion space of the mechanical system (e.g., describing the positions of the celestial
bodies); y = (y1, . . . , yn) describes the corresponding momenta (or velocities, if
you will). The full space R2n is the phase space (rather, its local description) of
the system.
The Hamilton equations corresponding to a smooth ‘Hamiltonian’ function1
H : R2n →R are
˙x
=
∂H
∂y ,
˙y
=
−∂H
∂x ,





(I.1)
where we write time derivatives with dots in the Newtonian fashion. Denote by
∇H =
∂H
∂(x, y)
the gradient of H. Then, (I.1) becomes
(−˙y, ˙x) = ∇H.
(I.2)
Now we identify Rn⊕Rn with Cn via2 (x, y) 7→x+iy =: z. Let J0 : Cn →Cn
be the isomorphism corresponding to multiplication by the imaginary unit i, but
thought of on the level of tangent spaces, that is,
J0(∂xj) = ∂yj,
J0(∂yj) = −∂xj,
j = 1, . . . , n.
Here, ∂xj, ∂yj denote unit vectors in the coordinate directions; the notation comes
from the interpretation of these tangent vectors as directional derivatives. Notice
1The attribute ‘Hamiltonian’ does not refer to any special properties of the function, but
simply to its role in giving rise to a dynamical system in the Hamiltonian formalism. As explained
in [Geiges 2016], the letter H actually stands for Huygens.
2Later on, when we speak of the identiﬁcation of Cn with R2n, our convention is to order the
real coordinates as (x1, y1, . . . , xn, yn); see Section I.7.1, for instance.

that J2
0 = −id and J0( ˙x + i ˙y) = −˙y + i ˙x. Hence, (I.2) can be rewritten even more
succinctly as
˙z = −J0∇H(z) =: XH(z),
(I.3)
and XH is called the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld corresponding to H.
The ﬂow of this vector ﬁeld describes the evolution of the mechanical system,
and Liouville’s theorem says that this ﬂow preserves the standard volume form
volR2n := dx1 ∧dy1 ∧. . . ∧dxn ∧dyn
on phase space.
Theorem I.1.1 (Liouville). The ﬂow of the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XH on phase
space is volume-preserving.
Proof. Thanks to the divergence theorem of Gauß, it suﬃces to observe that the
vector ﬁeld XH is divergence-free (or see the subsequent elementary exercise):

Exercise I.1.2. This exercise is meant to elucidate the interpretation of divergence
as ‘source strength’, without appealing to the theorem of Gauß. Let v: Rm →Rm
be a vector ﬁeld on Rm. Write e1, . . . , em for the unit vectors in the coordinate
directions. For a small ε > 0 we consider the little cube spanned by the vectors
εei, i = 1, . . . , m at some point a ∈Rm. Now we study how this cube moves under
the ﬂow deﬁned by the vector ﬁeld v. In a small time t, the corner a of the cube
moves, in ﬁrst approximation, to the point a + tv(a); the corners a + εei move to
a+εei +tv(a+εei). These corners deﬁne a parallelepiped spanned by the vectors
ui(ε, t) := εei + t
 v(a + εei) −v(a)

,
i = 1, . . . , m.
Write Vε(t) for the volume of this parallelepiped, that is,
Vε(t) = det
 u1(ε, t), . . . , um(ε, t)

,
where we interpret the ui(ε, t) as column vectors of an (m × m)-matrix.
Compute ˙Vε(0) and show that
lim
ε→0
˙Vε(0)
Vε(0) = div v(a).
♦
We shall see presently that one can avoid referring to the geometric inter-
pretation of divergence, and prove something considerably stronger to boot. Enter
symplectic geometry.

I.2
Symplectomorphisms and symplectic embeddings
We now consider the 2-form
ω :=
n
X
j=1
dxj ∧dyj
(I.4)
on R2n. Notice that in terms of the standard inner product ⟨. , . ⟩, for arbitrary
vector ﬁelds v, w on R2n we have
ω(v, w) = ⟨J0v, w⟩.
Exercise I.2.1. Verify this identity. Further, show that J0 is an element of the
orthogonal group O(2n), and that it preserves the 2-form ω, in the sense that
ω(J0v, J0w) = ω(v, w).
So, we also have ω(v, J0w) = ⟨v, w⟩.
♦
The 2-form ω is obviously closed, i.e. dω = 0, and it is nondegenerate in
the sense that for any nonzero tangent vector vp ∈TpR2n one can ﬁnd a tangent
vector wp ∈TpR2n such that ωp(vp, wp) ̸= 0; indeed, one may take wp := J0vp.
Deﬁnition I.2.2. A closed and nondegenerate 2-form Ωon a smooth manifold M
is called a symplectic form. The pair (M, Ω) is then called a symplectic manifold.
The 2-form ω in (I.4) is the standard symplectic form on R2n.
Note I.2.3. The nondegeneracy condition can be interpreted as saying that the
linear map
TpM
−→
T ∗
p M
vp
7−→
Ωp(vp, . )
from the tangent space to its dual is injective, and hence an isomorphism, at all
points p ∈M.
The nondegeneracy is a pointwise condition, and some simple linear algebra
shows that it forces the manifold to be of even dimension 2n, and that the nonde-
generacy of Ωcan equivalently be phrased as the condition that the nth exterior
power Ωn of Ωbe nowhere zero, i.e. a volume form. In our concrete example, we
have ωn = n! volR2n.
Exercise I.2.4. Prove the claims in the preceding paragraph.
♦
Proposition I.2.5. With the help of ω, the deﬁning equation (I.3) for the Hamilto-
nian vector ﬁeld XH can be written as
iXHω = dH,
(I.5)
where i denotes the interior product.

I.2. Symplectomorphisms and symplectic embeddings
5
Proof. By Note I.2.3, equation (I.5) deﬁnes a unique vector ﬁeld XH for any given
smooth function H. Therefore, it suﬃces to verify that the Hamiltonian vector
ﬁeld XH deﬁned in (I.3) also satisﬁes (I.5):
iXHω = ⟨J0XH, . ⟩= ⟨∇H, . ⟩= dH.
□
Here is the promised improvement on Liouville’s theorem. For the basic facts
about Lie derivatives we are using in the proof and the subsequent discussion,
the reader may wish to refer to [Warner 1983]. Cartan’s formula is Proposition
2.25 (d) in that text.
Theorem I.2.6. The ﬂow of the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XH preserves the sym-
plectic form ω on phase space.
Proof. This follows from the vanishing of the Lie derivative:
LXHω = (d ◦iXH + iXH ◦d)(ω) = d2H = 0,
where we have used Cartan’s formula LX = d ◦iX + iX ◦d.
□
If we write φt for the (local) ﬂow of XH, then
d
dt|t=t0φ∗
t ω = φ∗
t0LXHω,
so the vanishing of the Lie derivative LXHω is indeed equivalent to φ∗
t ω = ω for
all times t (when and wherever φt is deﬁned). Alternatively, one can perform a
direct and elementary computation. Write
φt : (x0
1, y0

Chapter I. Gromov’s Nonsqueezing Theorem
Deﬁnition I.2.7. A diﬀeomorphism Φ of a symplectic manifold (M, ΩM) is called
symplectic or a symplectomorphism if Φ∗ΩM = ΩM.
An embedding Φ: (M, ΩM) ,→(N, ΩN) of symplectic manifolds is symplectic
if Φ∗ΩN = ΩM. (Here it is not assumed that dim M = dim N.)
With this terminology in place, Theorem I.2.6 becomes: The ﬂow map φt of
the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XH is a symplectomorphism of phase space. A sym-
plectomorphism Φ of (M, ΩM) preserves, a fortiori, the volume form Ωn
M (where
dim M = 2n), since Φ∗Ωn
M = (Φ∗ΩM)n = Ωn
M. So the classical Liouville theorem
is indeed a direct consequence of Theorem I.2.6.
For completeness we mention that a diﬀeomorphism that arises as the time-1
map of a Hamiltonian ﬂow is called a Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism. On a compact
symplectic manifold (M, ΩM) without boundary, a Hamiltonian function H : M →
R necessarily has singular points (a minimum and a maximum), and thus XH has
zeros by (I.5). Thus, the shift (ϕ, θ) 7→(ϕ + ϕ0, θ) on the 2-torus T 2 = S1 × S1,
with circular coordinates ϕ, θ and symplectic form dϕ ∧dθ, would be a simple
example of a non-Hamiltonian symplectomorphism.
A concise textbook on symplectic geometry is [Cannas da Silva 2001]. For a
considerably more comprehensive treatment, including more topological aspects,
see [McDuﬀ& Salamon 2017]. The use of symplectic geometry in Hamiltonian
mechanics is amply explained in [Abraham & Marsden 1978], [Arnol’d 1989] and
[Libermann & Marle 1987].
I.3
Gromov’s nonsqueezing theorem
The emancipation of symplectic geometry from its servant role to classical mechan-
ics, and its subsequent metamorphosis into the ﬁeld of symplectic topology, can be
dated quite precisely. The seminal event was the publication of M. Gromov’s paper
Pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds [Gromov 1985]. The methods
developed there opened vistas of thought that have led to spectacular advances
over the course of several decades. One of the key results of that paper, and the
protagonist of these lecture notes, is the celebrated3 nonsqueezing theorem.
As we have seen, Liouville’s theorem is usually formulated as a result about
the preservation of volume in phase space under Hamiltonian ﬂows, although these
ﬂows actually preserve the symplectic form ω, not only the volume form ωn. Thus,
it seems natural to ask: how much more restrictive is the condition for a map (a
diﬀeomorphism, an embedding, . . .) to be symplectic rather than merely volume-
preserving?
The nonsqueezing theorem provides an instance where one can establish the
nonexistence of a symplectic embedding, although a volume-preserving embedding
can be found. This proves the existence of ‘symplectic obstructions’.
3We were too young to be invited to the party.

I.3. Gromov’s nonsqueezing theorem

I.3.1
Statement of the theorem
In order to formulate the theorem, we introduce the following notation. Write
B2n
r
:=

z ∈Cn : |z| < r
	
for the open ball4 of radius r > 0 in Cn, and B2n := B2n
1
for the open unit ball.
We drop the superscript 2n when the dimension is understood. The open unit
cylinder in Cn is the set
Z := Z2n :=

z = (z1, . . . , zn) ∈Cn : |z1| < 1
	
= B2 × Cn−1 ⊂C × Cn−1.
For n ≥2 and any s > 0, the complex linear diﬀeomorphism
Φ = Φs : (z1, z2, . . . , zn) 7−→
 z1
s , sz2, . . . , zn

of Cn is volume-preserving for the volume form ωn (since det Φ = 1), but it is not
symplectic unless s = 1:
Φ∗ω
=
Φ∗(dx1 ∧dy1 + dx2 ∧dy2 + · · · + dxn ∧dyn)
=
1
s2 dx1 ∧dy1 + s2 dx2 ∧dy2 + · · · + dxn ∧dyn.
For 0 < r ≤1, the ball Br embeds into Z simply by inclusion. For r > 1, if we
choose s ≥r, the restriction of Φs to Br deﬁnes a volume-preserving embedding
of Br as a ‘cigar’ into Z, that is,
Φs(Br) ⊂Z for s ≥r;
see Figure I.1.
By contrast, in the symplectic realm we have the following theorem.
Theorem I.3.1 (Gromov’s Nonsqueezing Theorem). The ball (Br, ω) embeds sym-
plectically into (Z, ω) if and only if r ≤1.
Remark I.3.2. This theorem permits a physical interpretation as a classical (in the
sense of non-quantum) version of the uncertainty principle in statistical mechanics.
We regard the ball Br in phase space as an initial collection of states of a physical
system. The nonsqueezing theorem then says that, under the Hamiltonian ﬂow,
this collection of states never evolves into one where position and momentum in
the (x1, y1)-direction are compressed into a disc of radius smaller than r. For a
more precise formulation in terms of the so-called covariance ellipsoid, and for a
comprehensive discussion of the physical context, see [de Gosson 2009].
4For n = 1, we usually speak of the disc B2
r ⊂C.

Figure I.1: The volume-preserving embedding Φs : Br ,→Z for s ≥r > 1.
I.3.2
Almost complex structures
Before we sketch the proof of the nonsqueezing theorem, we introduce a little more
terminology.
Deﬁnition I.3.3. An almost complex structure on a smooth manifold M is a bundle
isomorphism J : TM →TM satisfying J2 = −id.
An almost complex structure J turns each tangent space TpM, p ∈M, into
a complex vector space by deﬁning
(a + ib)v = av + bJv.
In particular, M must be even-dimensional.
Remark I.3.4. The dimension of M being even is not suﬃcient for the existence of
an almost complex structure. For instance, in dimension 4 there are obstructions
coming from the signature theorem. This allows one to show that the 4-sphere
S4 does not carry an almost complex structure. In fact, S2 and S6 are the only
spheres admitting an almost complex structure.
Deﬁnition I.3.5. An almost complex structure J on M is called compatible with
a given symplectic form Ωon M if
⟨v, w⟩J := Ω(v, Jw),
where v, w are vector ﬁelds on M, deﬁnes a Riemannian metric.
The compatibility condition is equivalent to saying that
Ω(Jv, Jw) = Ω(v, w)

I.3. Gromov’s nonsqueezing theorem
9
and
Ωp(vp, Jvp) > 0
for 0 ̸= vp ∈TpM.
For example, the isomorphism J0 on R2n = Cn introduced in the preceding section
is an almost complex structure compatible with the standard symplectic form
ω = P
j dxj ∧dyj, and the associated metric ⟨. , . ⟩J0 equals the standard metric
⟨. , . ⟩.
Note I.3.6. The almost complex structure J is orthogonal with respect to ⟨. , . ⟩J,
that is,
⟨Jv, Jw⟩J = ⟨v, w⟩J.
I.3.3
Idea of the proof
Suppose we have a symplectic embedding
Φ: Br0 −→Z.
We consider the restriction of Φ to the closed ball Dr := Br for some radius
r < r0, and we write Φ−1 : Φ(Dr) →Dr for the inverse diﬀeomorphism. It suﬃces
to show that r ≤1, for this entails r0 ≤1.
As before, we write ω, J0 and ⟨. , . ⟩= ⟨. , . ⟩J0 for the standard symplectic
form, almost complex structure and inner product, respectively, on R2n. Thanks
to the fact that Φ: Dr →Φ(Dr) (and hence Φ−1) is a symplectomorphism, the
endomorphism5
J := Φ∗J0 := TΦ ◦J0 ◦TΦ−1
of the tangent bundle of Φ(Dr) is an almost complex structure compatible with ω,
since
⟨v, w⟩J
:=
ω(v, Jw)
=
ω(TΦ−1(v), TΦ−1(Jw))
=
ω(TΦ−1(v), J0 TΦ−1(w))
=
⟨TΦ−1(v), TΦ−1(w)⟩
is an inner product.
As we shall see in Section I.7, this J can be extended to an almost complex
structure (which we continue to call J) compatible with ω on all of R2n, and such
that it coincides with J0 outside a small neighbourhood of Φ(Dr). The central
aim of this course will be to establish a theory of pseudoholomorphic discs. In the
setting at hand, this will allow us to establish the existence of a smooth map
ˆu: (D, ∂D) −→(Z, ∂Z),
5We use the diﬀerential topologist’s notation TΦ for the diﬀerential of a diﬀerentiable map Φ
between manifolds (and TpΦ for the diﬀerential at the point p), except for real-valued functions f,
where we tend to write the diﬀerential as df.

ˆu∗ω = π,
(D3)
ˆux + J(ˆu) ˆuy = 0.
Remark I.3.7. By a smooth function on D we mean the restriction to D of a smooth
function deﬁned on an open subset of C containing D. In particular, equation (D3)
makes sense even in the boundary points of D. Thanks to an extension result of
[Seeley 1964], with a surprisingly short and simple proof, this is equivalent to the
requirement that the function be smooth on Int(D), and the function and all its
derivatives extend continuously to the boundary.
Notation I.3.8. We write C∞(D, R2n) for the maps D →R2n that are smooth in
this sense.
Exercise I.3.9. Show that a diﬀerentiable function7 u = g + ih: U →C on an
open subset U ⊂C satisﬁes the Cauchy–Riemann equations
gx = hy,
gy = −hx
(and hence is holomorphic) if and only if
ux + J0uy = 0.
Here (and in (D3) above) the subscripts denote partial derivatives. Observe that
this equation entails ⟨ux, uy⟩= 0.
Show further that these conditions are equivalent to the diﬀerential
Tzu: C = TzU −→Tu(z)C = C
being a complex linear map. If that is the case, show that Tzu is multiplication
by uz := 1
2(ux −iuy), i.e. uz is the derivative of u when interpreted as a complex-
valued function. Also, verify the formulæ
uz = ux = −iuy for u holomorphic.
6We shall not religiously adhere to this notational convention, but only where it helps to
clarify matters.
7The notation u is a little unfortunate in this context, since most books on elementary complex
analysis write a complex-valued function as u + iv, with u denoting the real part. In symplectic
topology, however, u has become the standard notation for pseudoholomorphic curves.

I.3. Gromov’s nonsqueezing theorem
11
Further consequences are
|uz| = |ux| = |uy| for u holomorphic,
and that holomorphic functions (as well as their real and imaginary parts) are
harmonic, i.e.
∆u := uxx + uyy = 0.
Conclude that the diﬀerential of a holomorphic map u: U →C at any given
point z ∈C, viewed as a real linear map TzU →Tu(z)C, has rank 0 or 2.
♦
In view of this exercise, we recognise condition (D3) as the direct analogue
of the holomorphicity condition for a map into an almost complex manifold.
Deﬁnition I.3.10. Let (M, J) be an almost complex manifold, and U ⊂C some
open subset. A smooth map u: U →M is called a J-holomorphic curve, or a
pseudoholomorphic curve with respect to J, if ux + J(u)uy = 0.
In particular, J0-holomorphic curves U →Cn are simply holomorphic maps.
As in the holomorphic case, J-holomorphicity is equivalent to saying that the
diﬀerential Tzu: TzU →Tu(z)M is complex linear, where the complex structure
on Tu(z)M is deﬁned by J
 u(z)

.
Exercise I.3.11. Let ϕ: V →U be a biholomorphism between two open subsets
U, V ⊂C, and u: U →(M, J) a J-holomorphic map. Show that u ◦ϕ is likewise
J-holomorphic. In other words, conformal reparametrisations of J-holomorphic
curves are J-holomorphic.
♦
The relevance of condition (D1) is that we can ﬁnd a J-holomorphic disc
passing through the given point Φ(0); the fact that this value is attained in 0 ∈D
is not important and can be arranged by a reparametrisation, i.e. by precomposing
Φ with a M¨obius transformation of D.
The integral in (D2) is called the symplectic energy of the holomorphic disc.
This notion of energy can be deﬁned for any smooth map from a 2-dimensional
domain of deﬁnition (preferably compact) to a symplectic manifold. In Sections
I.4.2 and I.8.4 we shall discuss aspects particular to the symplectic energy of
holomorphic and J-holomorphic curves, respectively.
Deﬁnition I.3.12. Let u: D →M be a smooth map into a symplectic manifold
(M, Ω). The symplectic energy of u is
Z
D
u∗Ω.
On the closure Gr of the subset Gr := ˆu−1(Φ(Br)), which contains 0 ∈D
by (D1), we can compose ˆu with Φ−1:
u := Φ−1 ◦ˆu|Gr : Gr −→Dr.

The map u is J0-holomorphic (i.e. holomorphic in the usual sense as a map
into Cn), and it passes through the origin: u(0) = 0 ∈Cn; see Figure I.2. Be-
ware that on the right of that ﬁgure we give a schematic illustration with reduced
dimensions, so that ˆu(Dr) looks like a real curve, even though it is a disc (possibly
with singularities).

We claim that
Gr ⊂Int(D)
and
u(∂Gr) ⊂∂Dr.
(I.6)
To see this, we make the following observations. First of all, Φ(Dr) is a compact
subset of Cn as the embedded image of a closed ball. Hence, ˆu−1(Φ(Dr)) is a
closed subset of D. Moreover, ˆu−1(Φ(Dr)) is actually contained in Int(D), since
Φ(Dr) ⊂Z and ˆu(∂D) ⊂∂Z. Points in Gr are mapped by ˆu to points in the closure

I.4. The monotonicity lemma
13
of Φ(Br), which equals Φ(Dr). Hence, Gr ⊂ˆu−1(Φ(Dr)) ⊂Int(D), which is the
ﬁrst claimed inclusion. The second one follows by observing that ∂Gr = Gr \ Gr
is mapped by ˆu into Φ(Dr) \ Φ(Br) = Φ(∂Dr).
It is these properties (I.6) that will allow us to apply the monotonicity lemma,
which we are going to prove in Section I.4, to this situation. This lemma says that
under these conditions we have
πr2 ≤
Z
Gr
u∗ω.
(I.7)
But the embedding Φ is symplectic, which means that
ˆu∗ω = (Φ ◦u)∗ω = u∗Φ∗ω = u∗ω
on Gr.
We also observe that ˆu∗ω is a non-negative 2-form on all of D; indeed, using (D3)
we ﬁnd
ˆu∗ω(∂x, ∂y) = ω(ˆux, ˆuy) = ω(ˆux, J(ˆu)ˆux) ≥0.
Thus, the monotonicity lemma says that the area of the holomorphic curve u(Gr)
passing through the centre of Dr and with boundary on ∂Dr — where area is
measured with respect to the 2-form ω on u(Gr) — cannot be smaller than the
area of the equatorial disc Dr ∩{z2 = · · · = zn = 0}.
We then compute
Z
Gr
u∗ω =
Z
Gr
ˆu∗ω ≤

D
ˆu∗ω = π,
the last equality coming from (D2). With (I.7) we conclude that r ≤1.
This concludes the sketch proof of Theorem I.3.1.
Remark I.3.13. Holomorphicity of u is used in the proof of (I.7) by interpreting the
symplectic energy of u as an area with respect to a degenerate metric conformal
to the standard metric on R2n. The computation of the energy integral for ˆu
is purely homological. For the compactness property of the moduli space of J-
holomorphic curves, one crucial property of the energy integral is its integrand
being non-negative.
I.4
The monotonicity lemma
Let G ⊂C be a domain, i.e. an open, connected subset. We assume that 0 ∈G.
We are going to formulate the monotonicity lemma for a proper holomorphic map
u: (G, 0) −→(Cn, 0).
Recall that a map between topological spaces is called proper if the preimage of
any compact subset is compact.

14
Chapter I. Gromov’s Nonsqueezing Theorem
As before, we write Br ⊂Cn for the open ball of radius r about 0 and
Dr := Br for its closure. We write Sr = ∂Dr for the (2n −1)-sphere of radius r.
Set Gr := u−1(Br). This is an open subset of G, and hence of C. Moreover, Gr is
a subset of the — by the properness of u — compact set u−1(Dr); hence,
Gr ⊂u−1(Dr) ⊂G.
With u being continuous it follows that the boundary ∂Gr = Gr \ Gr is mapped
by u into the sphere Sr:
u(∂Gr) ⊂Sr.
This geometric property, as illustrated on the left-hand side of Figure I.2 will be
crucial for the monotonicity lemma.
If we did not impose this condition, we could easily write down maps that
violate inequality (I.7). For example, the inclusion of B2
r′, for r′ < r, into the
equatorial disc Dr ∩{z1-plane} has symplectic energy π(r′)2.
Theorem I.4.1 (Monotonicity Lemma). If u: (G, 0) →(Cn, 0) is a proper holo-
morphic map, then for any r > 0 the symplectic energy of u|u−1(Br) with respect
to the standard symplectic form ω on Cn is bounded from below by πr2:
Z
u−1(Br)
u∗ω ≥πr2.
Without the assumption on u being proper, this inequality holds whenever u−1(Dr)
is compact.
This theorem will be proved in Section I.4.3.
Exercise I.4.2. Show by an example that the conditions u(0) = 0 is necessary for
the monotonicity lemma to hold.
♦
Remark I.4.3. The name ‘monotonicity lemma’ derives from the fact that the
inequality can be proved by showing the quotient of the left-hand by the right-
hand side to be a nondecreasing function of r; see [Jost 2017], for instance. We
follow a slightly diﬀerent route.
I.4.1
The strong maximum principle
Before we attend to the proof of Theorem I.4.1, we want to state and prove a
simple version of the maximum principle for subharmonic functions, and use it to
gain information about the qualitative topological behaviour of the holomorphic
curve u. Our discussion of the maximum principle is inspired by [Jost 2013].
Deﬁnition I.4.4. A smooth map f : G →R is called subharmonic if
∆f := fxx + fyy ≥0.

I.4. The monotonicity lemma
15
Lemma I.4.5. The function f := |u|2, where u: G →Cn is holomorphic, is sub-
harmonic.
Proof. We compute
fxx = 2⟨u, uxx⟩+ 2⟨ux, ux⟩,
and similarly for fyy. With the harmonicity of u (Exercise I.3.9) we conclude
fxx + fyy = 2
 |ux|2 + |uy|2
≥0.
□
Exercise I.4.6. Show that the function |u| is likewise subharmonic away from the
zeros of u.
♦
Consider a smooth function f : G →R, a point z0 ∈G and a radius r > 0
such that the closed r-disc
Dr(z0) :=

z ∈C: |z −z0| ≤r
	
is contained in G. Write Sr(z0) := ∂Dr(z0) for the circle of radius r about z0. We
then deﬁne the spherical mean
S(f, z0, r) :=
1
2πr
Z
Sr(z0)
f ds = 1
2π
Z 2π
0
f(z0 + reit) dt.
Observe that the length element in terms of the parametrisation t 7→z0 + reit
of Sr(z0) is ds = r dt. The second expression for the spherical mean shows that
S(f, z0, r) extends continuously into r = 0, with S(f, z0, 0) = f(z0).
Exercise I.4.7. Deduce from the Cauchy integral formula that u(z0) = S(u, z0, r)
for a holomorphic function u: G →C; this is known as the mean value property.
(This identity also follows from the harmonicity of u and the next lemma.)

Chapter I. Gromov’s Nonsqueezing Theorem
Here we have written n for the outer normal along Sr(z0), and we have applied
the divergence theorem of Gauß in its classical formulation.
□
Proposition I.4.9. If f is subharmonic, then f(z0) ≤S(f, z0, r).
Proof. By the preceding lemma we have
∂
∂r S(f, z0, r) ≥0 for r > 0, and the
continuous extension of the spherical mean to r = 0 is S(f, z0, 0) = f(z0).
□
We can now prove the (strong) maximum principle for subharmonic func-
tions.
Theorem I.4.10 (Maximum Principle). Let f : G →R be a subharmonic function.
If there exists a point z0 ∈G with
f(z0) = sup
z∈G
f(z),
then f is constant. In particular, if G is bounded and f extends to a continuous
function on G, then
f(z) ≤max
w∈∂G f(w)
for all z ∈G.
Proof. Suppose there is a point in G where f attains its maximum M. Then,
GM :=

z ∈G: f(z) = M
	
̸= ∅.
By the preceding proposition, for any z ∈GM the function f is constant equal to
M on any disc Dr(z) contained in G. Thus, GM is open in G. By the continuity
of f, the subset GM is also closed in G. It follows that GM = G.
□
Remark I.4.11. An alternative proof of the maximum principle will be outlined in
Section II.1.4.
Exercise I.4.12. The purpose of this exercise is to prove the weak maximum prin-
ciple for subharmonic functions, using a more simplistic argument. Let G ⊂C be
a bounded domain and u: G →R a continuous function on the closure G, which
on G is smooth and subharmonic. Show that u attains its maximum on ∂G by
considering the function z 7→u(z) + εex, where z = x + iy and ε > 0, and then
passing to the limit ε →0.
♦
When applied to the function f = |u|2, the maximum principle says that
u: G →Cn cannot touch a boundary sphere S2n−1
r
= ∂D2n
r
⊂Cn from the
inside. Even without the condition u(0) = 0 and u proper, the image of u cannot
lie completely in a sphere S2n−1
r
, unless u is constant, as we ask you to show in
the next exercise, where we assume n = 2 for notational simplicity.
Exercise I.4.13. Let r be the radial coordinate on C2, and consider the 1-form
α := −r dr ◦J0.
(a) Show that ker
 α|T S3
deﬁnes a tangent 2-plane ﬁeld on S3 invariant under J0.

I.4. The monotonicity lemma
17
(b) Verify that the description of α in Cartesian coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) on
R4 = C2 is
α = x1 dy1 −y1 dx1 + x2 dy2 −y2 dx2.
(c) Show that the 4-form r dr ∧α ∧dα is nowhere zero. This implies that the
3-form (α ∧dα)|T S3 is nowhere zero (and hence a volume form on S3). Equi-
valently, dα does not vanish on the 2-plane ﬁeld ker
 α|T S3
.
(d) Let u: G →C2 be a nonconstant holomorphic curve. Show that the image
of u cannot be contained in S3 (or any S3
r) by computing u∗α and u∗(dα)
under the assumption u(G) ⊂S3 and deriving a contradiction.
The Dark Lady in this exercise is contact geometry [Geiges 2008].
♦
From elementary complex analysis the reader will be aware that holomorphic
functions also satisfy a minimum principle. If u: G →C is holomorphic and |u|
attains its minimum in z0 ∈G, then u(z0) = 0 or u is constant. This follows by
considering the function 1/u.
Note I.4.14. Similarly, a harmonic function f : G →R satisﬁes the mean value
property f(z0) = S(f, z0, r) by Proposition I.4.9, applied to f and −f. This im-
mediately implies both the maximum and the minimum principle for harmonic
functions.
For subharmonic functions, the minimum principle no longer holds, in gen-
eral, and indeed a holomorphic curve u: G →Cn may well be tangent to S2n−1
r
from the outside. The simplest example would be a complex line tangent to S2n−1
r
.
But even with the additional assumption that u pass through 0 ∈Cn, such tan-
gencies can occur, as the next exercise shows.
Exercise I.4.15. Let u: (G, 0) →(C2, 0) be the holomorphic curve deﬁned by
u(z) = (z, sin 4z). Show that the function |u|2 has isolated local minima.

Symplectic energy of holomorphic curves
Let u: G →Cn be a holomorphic map. The partial derivatives of u with respect
to the real coordinates x, y can be written as
ux = Tu(∂x),
uy = Tu(∂y).
Then,
u∗ω = u∗ω(∂x, ∂y) dx ∧dy = ω(ux, uy) dx ∧dy = ω(ux, J0ux) dx ∧dy,
where we have used Exercise I.3.9. Combining this with Exercise I.2.1, we can
rewrite ω(ux, J0ux) as
ω(ux, J0ux) = ⟨ux, ux⟩= ⟨uy, uy⟩= 1
2
 ⟨ux, ux⟩+ ⟨uy, uy⟩


rem I.4.1) can be written as

u∗ω = 1
2
Z
u−1(Br)
|∇u|2 dx dy.
(I.8)
Remark I.4.16. The identity theorem for holomorphic functions [J¨anich 1999] im-
plies that the zeros of u, and likewise Tu, do not accumulate at any point in G.
By Exercise I.3.9, u is an immersion outside the zeros of Tu.
Notation I.4.17. Instead of ⟨. , . ⟩we use the notation ⟨. , . ⟩R2n for the standard
Euclidean inner product on R2n when we want to avoid confusion with other
metrics. When we read vectors v, w ∈R2n as n-tuples v = (v1, . . . , vn), w =
(w1, . . . , wn) of complex numbers, then
⟨v, w⟩R2n =
n
X
j=1
Re(vjwj).
Set
⟨. , . ⟩u := ⟨Tu( . ), Tu( . )⟩R2n.
By the preceding remark, this is a Riemannian metric (i.e. a pointwise inner prod-
uct on tangent spaces) on G\{Tu = 0}, and completely degenerate on the discrete
set {Tu = 0}. Nonetheless, we shall usually speak of the ‘metric’ ⟨. , . ⟩u. The cor-
responding ‘norm’ on tangent vectors (likewise degenerate at the points where
Tu = 0) will be denoted by | . |u.
Exercise I.4.18. Show that ⟨. , . ⟩u is conformally equivalent to ⟨. , . ⟩R2, speciﬁ-
cally,
⟨. , . ⟩u = |ux|2⟨. , . ⟩R2.
Show further that u∗ω equals the ‘area form’ |ux|2 dx ∧dy of this metric.
♦

I.4. The monotonicity lemma
19
Remark I.4.19. Let G0 = G \ {Tu = 0}, so that u|G0 is an immersion. From a
course on elementary diﬀerential geometry [Millman & Parker 1977] or analysis
[Br¨ocker 1992] you may know that the area element of this immersion, which
computes the area on u(G0) with respect to the metric induced by ⟨. , . ⟩R2n, is
√gu dx ∧dy,
where gu is the determinant of the Gram matrix of metric coeﬃcients
⟨ux, ux⟩
⟨ux, uy⟩
⟨uy, ux⟩
⟨uy, uy⟩

(which here equals |ux|2 times the unit matrix). Thus, computing area on u(G0)
w.r.t. ⟨. , . ⟩R2n is the same as computing area on G0 w.r.t. ⟨. , . ⟩u. The same goes
for lengths of curves.
By Exercise I.4.18, the ﬁrst way of writing the symplectic energy in (I.8)
can be interpreted as an area integral (outside isolated singularities). The second
way of writing the symplectic energy is known in the theory of minimal surfaces
as the Dirichlet integral [Jost 1994]. So you may also ﬁnd the symplectic energy
referred to as symplectic area or Dirichlet energy. The analogous statement for
J-holomorphic curves will be discussed in Section I.8.4.
Example I.4.20. We want to verify the monotonicity lemma for the holomorphic
function u: C →C, z 7→azk, with a ∈C∗and k ∈N := {1, 2, 3, . . .} given. We
have u−1(Br) = Br′ with r′ =
kp
r/|a|. The complex derivative of u is uz(z) =
akzk−1. By Exercise I.3.9 we have

I.4.3
Proof of the monotonicity lemma
Recall that in the monotonicity lemma (Theorem I.4.1) we are considering a proper
holomorphic map u: (G, 0) →(Cn, 0), and our aim is to show that for any r > 0
the integral
R
u−1(Br) u∗ω is bounded from below by πr2.

Chapter I. Gromov’s Nonsqueezing Theorem

continuous on G and smooth on G \ {u = 0}. Deﬁne
K :=

z ∈G: f(z) = 0 or (f(z) ̸= 0 and dzf = 0)

The set {u = 0} ⊂u−1(Dr) is ﬁnite by Remark I.4.16 and the properness of u (or
the speciﬁc assumption that u−1(Dr) be compact). Moreover, the set of critical
values of f has Lebesgue measure zero by Sard’s theorem [Milnor 1965]. It follows
that
f(K) ∩[0, r] = f
 u−1(Dr) ∩K

is a zero set. Write
R := Rr := (0, r) \ f(K)
for the set of regular values of f in the open interval (0, r).
Note I.4.22. The set K is closed, and u−1(Dr) is compact thanks to u being
proper. It follows that f(K) ∩[0, r] is a compact zero set, and hence R is open.
This implies that R can be written as the disjoint union of countably many open
intervals, R = ∪ν(bν, cν).
Exercise I.4.23. Why does a disjoint union of intervals in the real line always
constitute a countable (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) collection?
♦
The preimage f −1(R) does not contain any critical points of u, since the
rank of Tu is zero in those points (Exercise I.3.9), and dzf = Tu(z)| . |◦Tzu. Thus,
f −1(R) ⊂G \ {Tu = 0},
and ⟨. , . ⟩u is a nondegenerate Riemannian metric on f −1(R).
For each t ∈R, the preimage f −1(t) is a compact 1-dimensional submanifold
of G, and hence8 a ﬁnite collection of embedded circles. Then, u
 f −1(t)

is a
collection of immersed circles in Cn. We write ℓ(t) for the total Euclidean length
of this latter collection of circles.
On the interval [0, r] we deﬁne the strictly increasing function t 7→a(t) ∈R+

increasing. What role is being played by the properness assumption on a?

I.5.1
Proof of Lemma I.4.25
We consider the function a on a component (b, c) of R. Choose a reference point
t0 ∈(b, c).
Write φs for the ﬂow of the vector ﬁeld X := ∇uf/|∇uf|2
u on f −1(R). This
ﬂow sends level sets of f to level sets, since
df(X) = ⟨∇uf, X⟩u ≡1.
In particular, the number of circles in the collection f −1(t) is constant as t ranges
over a connected component of R. For ease of notation we assume that this number
is one for the component (b, c).
Choose a regular parametrisation γ0 : S1 = R/2πZ →f −1(t0) of the embed-
ded circle f −1(t0) in G, that is, γ′
0(θ) ̸= 0 for all θ ∈S1. We can then parametrise
the open subset G(b,c) := f −1 (b, c)

of G by
Φ:
(b −t0, c −t0) × S1
−→
G(b,c)
(s, θ)
7−→
Φ(s, θ) := φs
 γ0(θ)

.
Notice that θ 7→γs(θ) := Φ(s, θ) gives a parametrisation of the circle f −1(t0 + s).
Computing length and area in G(b,c) with respect to ⟨. , . ⟩u is the same as
computing it in the parameter space (b−t0, c−t0)×S1 with respect to the pull-back
metric
⟨. , . ⟩Φ := ⟨TΦ( . ), TΦ( . )⟩u.

We determine the metric coeﬃcients of this new metric:

By Lemma I.5.2, the Gram determinant gΦ of this metric satisﬁes

Symplectic action and energy of loops
In order to complete the proof of the monotonicity lemma (Theorem I.4.1), it
remains to establish the isoperimetric inequality (Proposition I.4.27). The next
exercise serves as a preparation.
Exercise I.5.3. Let γ : S1 = R/2πZ →R2n be a smooth loop and λ a primitive
1-form for the standard symplectic form ω on R2n, i.e. dλ = ω.
(a) Show that the symplectic action
A(γ) :=

is independent of the choice of λ and remains unchanged under orientation-
preserving reparametrisations of γ. If G ⊂C is a bounded domain with
smooth boundary ∂G = S1, and u: G →R2n a smooth map with u|∂G = γ,
then
A(γ) =

Recall that the length
L(γ) :=

|˙γ(t)|R2n dt
of a smooth curve γ : S1 →R2n does not change under reparametrisations. This
L(γ) is the ‘distance travelled’ rather than, in general, the geometric length of the
loop γ(S1) ⊂R2n. The energy of γ is

Beware that this energy does depend on the parametrisation of the loop.
We now prove an action-energy inequality and a more classical formulation
of the isoperimetric inequality, whence it is only a small step to Proposition I.4.27.
Proposition I.5.4. Let γ : S1 →R2n be a smooth loop. Then the following inequal-
ities hold:
(a) Action-energy inequality:
|A(γ)| ≤E(γ).
(b) ‘Classical’ isoperimetric inequality:

The action-energy inequality is an immediate consequence.
(b) We ﬁrst consider the case that γ is actually a regular curve (in other
words, an immersion), i.e. ˙γ(t) ̸= 0 for all t ∈S1. Since A and L do not depend on
the parametrisation, we may assume that γ is of constant speed |˙γ|R2n ≡L(γ)/2π.
Then,
E(γ) = 1

and the isoperimetric inequality follows directly from the action-energy inequality.
In the general case, we choose a sequence (ak)k∈N in Cn with ak →0 as
k →∞, and such that each ak does not lie in the compact set

ie−it ˙γ(t) ∈Cn : t ∈S1	
.
Then, γk(t) := γ(t) + akeit deﬁnes a sequence of immersed loops that converges
to γ in the C∞-topology, and the isoperimetric inequality for γ follows from that
for the γk by passing to the limit k →∞.
□
Note I.5.5. When γ is a simple closed curve in the plane R2, then A(γ) equals the
area of the region bounded by γ. This yields the isoperimetric inequality known
from elementary diﬀerential geometry.
Remark I.5.6. The proof of the isoperimetric inequality via Fourier expansions
can be traced back to A. Hurwitz (1902); cf. [Blaschke 1930].
Proof of Proposition I.4.27. Write γ1, . . . , γN for the collection of loops making
up u|f −1(t). Notice that the γk are regular curves for t ∈R. The proof of the
inequality a(t) ≤ℓ2(t)/4π is now a straightforward computation:

I.6
Holomorphic curves are minimal surfaces
The observations and results in this section will not be used in the rest of the text.
However, they are of independent interest and serve to place the discussion of
holomorphic curves in a diﬀerential geometric context. For a concise introduction
to minimal surfaces, see [Jost 1994] or the class notes [White 2013].
The isoperimetric inequality provides an upper estimate on the area of a holo-
morphic curve-with-boundary in terms of its boundary length. Thus, it ought not
to come as a surprise that holomorphic curves permit an interpretation as minimal
surfaces, as we shall now explain. The monotonicity lemma is an expression of this
minimal surface property.
In this section, ⟨. , . ⟩and | . | denote the standard metric and norm, re-
spectively, on R2n. For v, w vectors in R2n, write area(v, w) for the area of the
parallelogram spanned by v and w.
Exercise I.6.1. Verify the formula
area(v, w) =
s
det
⟨v, v⟩
⟨v, w⟩
⟨w, v⟩
⟨w, w⟩

♦
As before, ω denotes the standard symplectic form on R2n, and J0 the almost
complex structure corresponding to the identiﬁcation of R2n with Cn.
Lemma I.6.2. We have the inequality
ω(v, w) ≤area(v, w),
where equality holds if and only if
(i) v, w are linearly dependent over R, or
(ii) v, w span a complex line, with v, w deﬁning the positive orientation.
Proof. Both sides of the inequality (and the conditions for equality) remain un-
changed when a multiple of v is added to w. We may therefore assume that w is
orthogonal to v. Under this assumption,
ω(v, w) = ⟨J0v, w⟩≤|v| · |w| = area(v, w),
with equality if and only if one of v, w is zero, or w is a positive multiple of J0v.
□

I.7. The space of almost complex structures

Now consider a bounded domain G ⊂C with smooth boundary, and let
v: G →R2n be a smooth map. Write gv for the Gram determinant of v. Notice
that
√gv = area
 Tv(∂x), Tv(∂y)

.
With the lemma this shows that
v∗ω(∂x, ∂y) ≤√gv,
with equality if (not ‘if and only if’) v is holomorphic when regarded as a map
into Cn. The case of equality was shown earlier in Exercise I.4.18.
From this observation we easily deduce the following minimality statement
for holomorphic curves. Recall that the area of v is, by deﬁnition,
area(v) :=
Z
G
√gv dx ∧dy;
if v is an injective immersion, this equals the area of v(G).
Theorem I.6.3. Let G ⊂C be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. Let
u: G →Cn be a holomorphic map, and v: G →Cn a smooth one with u|∂G =
v|∂G. Then,
area(u) ≤area(v),
with equality if v is holomorphic.
Proof. We compute

The space of almost complex structures
One of the tasks left over from Section I.3.3 is to construct an almost complex
structure on R2n that coincides with J on Φ(Dr), and with the standard almost
complex structure outside a small neighbourhood, say Φ(Br+ε), of Φ(Dr).
The required interpolation procedure for almost complex structures is based
on the fact, which will be established in this section, that the space of compatible
complex structures on a given symplectic vector space is diﬀeomorphic to a convex
space.

I.7.1
Linear algebra of complex structures
On the vector space R2n we consider the standard inner product ⟨. , . ⟩and sym-
plectic form ω. As before, we write J0 for the isomorphism of R2n corresponding
to multiplication by i under the identiﬁcation R2n = Cn; cf. footnote 2 on page 2.
For the following discussion we want to think of linear maps of R2n as (2n × 2n)-
matrices with respect to the canonical basis. Then,
J0 =

Notice that J−1
0

0 = −J0. We write E for the unit matrix.
Deﬁnition I.7.1. A (linear) complex structure on the vector space R2n is an au-
tomorphism J : R2n →R2n with J2 = −E. A complex structure J is said to be
compatible with ω if
ω(Jv, Jw) = ω(v, w)
for all v, w ∈R2n
and
ω(v, Jv) > 0
for all v ∈R2n \ {0}.
Notation I.7.2. We write J = J (ω) for the space of ω-compatible linear complex
structures on R2n.
By Exercise I.2.1, J0 is compatible with ω. Recall from Section I.3.2 that the
compatibility condition is equivalent to saying that
⟨v, w⟩J := ω(v, Jw)
deﬁnes an inner product on R2n, for which J is an orthogonal transformation.
Also, we have ⟨. , . ⟩J0 = ⟨. , . ⟩, or ω(v, w) = ⟨v, −J0w⟩, which in matrix notation
becomes
ω(v, w) = −vtJ0w.
Notation I.7.3. We write Km×n for the vector space of (m × n)-matrices over the
ﬁeld K.
Exercise I.7.4. Given a vector v ∈R2n, we write vC ∈Cn for the corresponding
complex vector under the natural identiﬁcation of R2n with Cn.
Let A ∈R2n×2n be a matrix that commutes with J0. Show the existence of
a unique matrix AC ∈Cn×n such that (Av)C = ACvC for all v ∈R2n.

Exercise I.7.5. Show that a real (2n × 2n)-matrix J deﬁnes a complex structure
if and only if the matrix Z := −J0J satisﬁes
J0Z = Z−1J0.
(I.10)
Show further that such a J is compatible with ω if and only if Z is symmetric
(Zt = Z) and positive deﬁnite (which we write as Z > 0).
Observe that Z is the matrix representing the inner product ⟨. , . ⟩J, that is,
vtZw = ⟨v, w⟩J.
♦
We denote the space of such matrices by
Z :=

Z ∈R2n×2n : Zt = Z, Z > 0, J0Z = Z−1J0
	
.
Then the preceding exercise says that we have a bijection

J 7−→−J0J.
Exercise I.7.6. Show that Z can equivalently be described as
Z =

Z ∈R2n×2n : Zt = Z, Z > 0, ZtJ0Z = J0
	
.
The third deﬁning condition is equivalent to ω(Zv, Zw) = ω(v, w). This identiﬁes
Z as the space of positive deﬁnite symmetric and symplectic matrices.
♦
Remark I.7.7. We shall see presently that the spaces J and Z are manifolds, and
the map J 7→−J0J a diﬀeomorphism between them.
Our aim will be to transform the space Z in such a way that (I.10) is turned
into a linear condition.

The Cayley transformation as a M¨obius transformation
As you recall from complex analysis, any M¨obius transformation
z 7−→az + b
cz + d,
where a, b, c, d are complex numbers with ad −bc ̸= 0, deﬁnes an automorphism
of the extended complex plane (or Riemann sphere) ˆC := C ∪{∞}, (i.e. a biholo-
morphism of ˆC onto itself) and these M¨obius transformations constitute the full
group of biholomorphisms of ˆC. The M¨obius transformation
fC : z 7−→1 −z
1 + z =: w
is known as the Cayley transformation.

30

preted (for z ∈C) as the Euclidean distance from the point z to the points ±1,
respectively. It follows that
|1 −z|
|1 + z| = 1 if and only if Re(z) = 0 or z = ∞.

Note I.7.11. From this exercise we conclude that the automorphism group Aut(D)
of D is of real dimension 3, and it acts simply transitively on ordered triples of
boundary points. In other words, given any two such triples, there is a unique
automorphism of D that sends one to the other.

I.7.3
The Cayley transformation on matrices
Inside the vector space of symmetric and complex anti-linear (2n × 2n)-matrices,
we deﬁne W as the open subset of matrices having operator norm (with respect
to the Euclidean norm on R2n) smaller than 1:
W :=

W ∈R2n×2n : W t = W, |W| < 1, J0W = −WJ0
	
.
Thus, W is in a natural way a manifold. Notice that for any W ∈W we have
sW ∈W for all s ∈[0, 1].
Notation I.7.12. We tend to write the operator norm on matrices — better: the
linear maps on ﬁnite-dimensional normed vector spaces deﬁned by those matrices
— simply as | . |. For linear operators on inﬁnite-dimensional normed spaces we
prefer the notation ∥. ∥. Occasionally, when arguments involve several diﬀerent
norms, we clarify which norms are operator norms by using ∥. ∥op.
Exercise I.7.13. Show that the dimension of the vector space

W ∈R2n×2n : W t = W, J0W = −WJ0
	
,
and hence that of the manifold W, equals n(n + 1). To this end, think of W as
a block matrix made up of (2 × 2)-matrices. Because of the symmetry condition
W t = W, we need only consider the blocks on and below the diagonal. Translate
the equation J0W = −WJ0 into conditions on the entries of each block.
♦
When the complex anti-linearity condition J0W = −WJ0 is rewritten as
−W = −J0WJ0, one recognises it as the deﬁning equation for the matrices in Z,
with Z 7→Z−1 replaced by W 7→−W. So the next proposition should not come
as too big a surprise.
Proposition I.7.14. The map
fC : Z 7−→(E −Z)(E + Z)−1 =: W
deﬁnes a diﬀeomorphism from Z onto W.
Proof. For Z ∈Z, the matrix E+Z is symmetric and positive deﬁnite, so (E+Z)−1
is deﬁned. Notice that E + Z commutes with E −Z, hence so does (E + Z)−1, i.e.
the order of factors in the deﬁnition of fC is not important. Using this observation
and Zt = Z, one easily checks that W t = W.
Next we want to check that |W| < 1. From the polarisation identity
|(E + Z)v|2 −|(E −Z)v|2 = 4⟨v, Zv⟩
we obtain
|w|2 −|Ww|2 = 4⟨v, Zv⟩
for v = (E + Z)−1w.
(I.11)
From Z > 0 it follows that |W| < 1. With the next exercise, we have shown
fC(Z) ⊂W.

32
Chapter I. Gromov’s Nonsqueezing Theorem
Exercise I.7.15. Observe that Z−1 is likewise symmetric and positive deﬁnite.
Show that J0(E + Z)−1 = (E + Z−1)−1J0, and further that J0W = −WJ0.
♦
In order to show that fC is actually a bijection onto W, we describe an explicit
inverse. For |W| < 1, the matrix E + W deﬁnes an injective map and hence is
invertible. With the observation at the beginning of this proof, one computes that
the same map fC, but now deﬁned on W, that is,
fC : W 7−→(E −W)(E + W)−1 =: Z,
deﬁnes the desired inverse, as was to be expected from Exercise I.7.8. It only
remains to check that fC(W) ⊂Z. From (I.11) we see that Z > 0 when |W| < 1.
Symmetry of Z and the equation J0Z = Z−1J0 one checks as before.
In order to show that Z is a manifold and fC : Z →W a diﬀeomorphism,
we observe that the map Z 7→(E −Z)(E + Z)−1 is a diﬀeomorphism between
the open neighbourhoods {Zt = Z, Z > 0} and {W t = W, |W| < 1} of Z and W,
respectively, inside the vector space of all symmetric (2n × 2n)-matrices. Since W
is a submanifold, so is Z.
□
Remark I.7.16. Similarly, the map J →Z, J 7→−J0J is the restriction to J of
the diﬀeomorphism A 7→−J0A deﬁned on the vector space R2n×2n.

Interpolating almost complex structures
We can now address the interpolation problem. An almost complex structure on
R2n is simply a smooth map R2n ∋p 7→Jp ∈J , that is, a family of matrices
Jp ∈J with matrix entries varying smoothly in p.
In the notation of Section I.3.3, choose ε > 0 small enough such that r + ε <
r0. Then the almost complex structure J = Φ∗J0 is deﬁned on Φ(Br+ε).
Lemma I.7.17. There is an almost complex structure ˆJ on R2n, compatible with ω,
that coincides with J on Φ(Dr), and with J0 on R2n \ Φ(Br+ε).
Proof. Choose a smooth function χ: R2n →[0, 1] with χ ≡1 on Φ(Dr), and χ ≡0
on R2n \ Φ(Br+ε); see the exercise below. Then, ˆJ := f −1

We shall continue to write J rather than ˆJ for this extended almost complex
structure.

I.8
A moduli space of J-holomorphic discs
The ﬁnal claim from Section I.3.3 that needs to be validated is the existence of a
J-holomorphic disc ˆu with the described properties. In the present section, we set
up the relevant moduli space and initiate a discussion of its basic properties.
Presumably you know the Schwarz lemma from a course on complex analysis,
but since it plays a crucial role in several of our arguments, we begin by recalling
its proof and some immediate consequences.
I.8.1
The Schwarz lemma
Write B ⊂C for the open unit disc, and Dr ⊂C for the closed disc of radius r.
Proposition I.8.1 (Schwarz Lemma). Let f : B →B be a holomorphic map with
f(0) = 0. Then, |f(z)| ≤|z| for all z ∈B, and |f ′(0)| ≤1. If |f(z0)| = |z0| for
some 0 ̸= z0 ∈B, or if |f ′(0)| = 1, then f is a rotation, that is, f(z) = eiθz for
some θ ∈R.
Proof. The power series expansion of f about 0 shows that f can be written
as f(z) = zg(z) with g: B →C holomorphic. By the maximum principle, the
maximum of |g| on Dr, for any given r ∈(0, 1), is attained on ∂Dr, i.e.
for all z ∈Dr : |g(z)| ≤max
|ζ|=r |g(ζ)| = max

By taking the limit r →1, we deduce that |g(z)| ≤1 for all z ∈B, which means
|f(z)| ≤|z| and |f ′(0)| = |g(0)| ≤1.
If |f(z0)| = |z0| for some 0 ̸= z0 ∈B, then |g(z0)| = 1; if |f ′(0)| = 1, then
|g(0)| = 1. In either case, the maximum principle applied to g shows that g ≡eiθ
for some θ ∈R.
□
Corollary I.8.2. Every biholomorphic map f : B →B with f(0) = 0 is a rotation.
Proof. With the Schwarz lemma applied to f and f −1 we have
|f(z)| ≤|z| = |f −1(f(z))| ≤|f(z)|,
i.e. |f(z)| = |z| for all z ∈B. Then apply the second part of the Schwarz lemma.

I.8.2
Automorphisms of the unit disc
Every M¨obius transformation that sends B onto B is obviously a biholomorphism
of B. We now show that there are no others. We denote the rotation z 7→eiθz
by Rθ, and for given z0 ∈B we deﬁne the M¨obius transformation fz0 by
fz0(z) = z −z0
1 −z0z .
The map fz0 indeed restricts to a biholomorphism of B. To see this, it suﬃces to
observe that fz0(z0) = 0, and that
|fz0(z)|2 = z −z0
1 −z0z · z −z0
1 −z0z
equals 1 for |z| = 1.
Proposition I.8.3. The automorphism group Aut(B) of B is made up entirely of
M¨obius transformations, speciﬁcally,
Aut(B) =

Rθ ◦fz0 : z0 ∈B, θ ∈R/2πZ
	
.
Proof. Given f ∈Aut(B), set z0 := f −1(0). Then, f ◦f −1
z0 is an automorphism of
B ﬁxing 0, and hence a rotation.
□
Remark I.8.4. The maps Rθ ◦fz0 may also be regarded as automorphisms of D,
and they constitute the full group Aut(D). In particular, any automorphism of B
is the restriction to B of an automorphism of D = B.
Exercise I.8.5. Use the description of Aut(B) to show that the automorphism
group of the open upper half-plane {Im z > 0} is made up of the real M¨obius
transformations z 7→(az + b)/(cz + d), a, b, c, d ∈R, ad −bc > 0. This shows that
the extension statement of Exercise I.7.10 (c) also holds for biholomorphisms of
the open half-plane.
♦
Exercise I.8.6. Show that Aut(D) acts simply transitively on pairs (z0, eiθ) made
up of a point z0 ∈Int(D) and a point eiθ ∈∂D; cf. Note I.7.11.

I.8.3
The moduli space M
Recall that the target space in Gromov’s nonsqueezing theorem is the cylinder
Z = B × Cn−1 in C × Cn−1. We write the coordinates on this ambient space as
(w, x + iy) with x = (x2, . . . , xn), y = (y2, . . . , yn) in Rn−1. In the boundary of Z
we consider the family of n-dimensional cylinders, t ∈Rn−1,
Lt := ∂B × Rn−1 × {y = t}.
Exercise I.8.7. Compute that the standard symplectic form ω pulls back to the
zero form on Lt under the inclusion map Lt →Cn.
♦

I.8. A moduli space of J-holomorphic discs
35
Deﬁnition I.8.8. A submanifold L ⊂(M, Ω) inside a symplectic manifold (M, Ω),
with the property that dim L = dim M/2 and Ω|T L = 0 is called Lagrangian.
Exercise I.8.9. The condition Ω|T L = 0 by itself forces dim L ≤dim M/2.
♦
Notation I.8.10. The moduli space M is the set of J-holomorphic discs
u: (D, ∂D) −→(R2n, ∂Z)
with the following properties:
(M1) (Lagrangian boundary condition) For every u ∈M there is a t ∈Rn−1,
called the level of u, such that
u(∂D) ⊂Lt.
(M2) (homotopy condition) The boundary map
u|∂D : ∂D −→Lt
is (smoothly)10 homotopic in Lt to
eiθ 7−→
 eiθ, 0 + it

.
(M3) (three-point condition) For k = 0, 1, 2 we have
u(ik) ∈{ik} × Rn−1 × {y = t}.
Remark I.8.11. The Lagrangian boundary condition (M1) is essential for the
analytical set-up. Thanks to the homotopy condition (M2), as we shall see in
Lemma II.1.18, for every u ∈M the boundary map u|∂D is an embedding, and in
particular injective. Therefore, by Note I.7.11, the three-point condition (M3) ﬁxes
the parametrisation of u, that is, for u ∈M and ϕ ∈Aut(D), we have u ◦ϕ ∈M
if and only if ϕ = idD. The boundary of any u ∈M being embedded is crucial for
the transversality theory in Chapter V via the properties of the set of so-called
injective points.
Remark I.8.12. Occasionally, we identify the target space R2n with Cn, even
though it is now equipped with the almost complex structure J rather than J0.
This is often convenient, for instance when using complex coordinates for describ-
ing the boundary behaviour of our J-holomorphic discs u; indeed, u(∂D) lies in a
region where J = J0.
10Under the assumption of a continuous homotopy, we shall see in Lemma II.1.18 that u|∂D is
an embedding. One can then also ﬁnd a smooth homotopy, so the smoothness assumption is no
restriction.

Chapter I. Gromov’s Nonsqueezing Theorem
Here is the central theorem of this course. With this theorem (rather, its
immediate corollary) and the energy calculation in the next section, we shall have
completed the proof of Gromov’s nonsqueezing theorem (Section I.3.3). The mean-
ing of ‘generic almost complex structure’ will be elucidated in Section V.2.4. If you
are unfamiliar with the concept of mapping degree, we ask you to bear with us
until Section V.7.2.
Theorem I.8.13. For a generic choice of the ω-compatible almost complex struc-
ture J (Lemma I.7.17), the moduli space M of J-holomorphic discs is a smooth
manifold of dimension 2n −2.
The evaluation map
ev:
M × D
−→
R2n
(u, z)
7−→
u(z)
is smooth, proper, and it takes values in the closed cylinder Z. Regarded as a map
into Z, the evaluation map ev has degree (over Z2) equal to 1:
deg2 ev = 1.
Some basic properties of the evaluation map will be worked out in Chap-
ter II; they are summarised in Section II.1.6. The properness of ev is stated again
as Theorem II.2.7. Some hard analysis is required for its proof, which will only
be complete by the end of Chapter III. Chapters IV and V are concerned with
establishing that M is a manifold.
In the corollary, Φ denotes the purported embedding Br0 →Z from the proof
of Gromov’s theorem.
Corollary I.8.14. Possibly after reparametrising with an element of Aut(D), there
is a J-holomorphic disc ˆu: (D, ∂D) →(Z, ∂Z) with ˆu(0) = Φ(0).
Proof. This follows from ev being of nonzero degree (see Note V.7.8), and the
reparametrisation being possible by Exercise I.8.6.
□
Remark I.8.15. As we shall see (Section II.1.5 and Exercise V.3.1), the discs u ∈M
are embeddings near the boundary. We shall not be making any claims about them
being globally embedded or pairwise disjoint. In dimension 4, such statements can
be proved using positivity of intersection of J-holomorphic curves and an inter-
section theory adapted to discs; see [Geiges & Zehmisch 2010]. This also implies
that M is connected (in dimension 4).
I.8.4
Symplectic energy of J-holomorphic discs
Here we show that the J-holomorphic discs in M have the energy property (D2)
mentioned in Section I.3.3.

Proof. Let u ∈M be a holomorphic disc of level t ∈Rn−1 deﬁned by the boundary
condition (M1). Set ut
0(z) := (z, it), z ∈D (this anticipates Notation I.8.23).
Thanks to the homotopy condition (M2), we can ﬁnd a homotopy
H : [0, 1] × ∂D −→Lt
from H(0, . ) = ut
0|∂D to H(1, . ) = u|∂D. Let λ be a primitive 1-form for ω. Then,

In particular, a J-holomorphic curve has positive symplectic energy, unless it is
constant.
Notation I.8.17. Let J be an ω-compatible almost complex structure on R2n. Write
⟨. , . ⟩J := ω( . , J . )
for the induced metric (cf. Section I.3.2), and | . |J for the corresponding norm. Let
G ⊂C be a bounded domain with smooth boundary, and u: G →R2n a smooth
map. The Dirichlet energy of u is deﬁned as 1

I.8.5
Flat discs
In order to gain a ﬁrst understanding of the moduli space M, we want to show
now that the J-holomorphic discs that stay entirely in the region where J = J0
are ‘ﬂat’ in a sense that we are going to explain.
Notation I.8.23. The ﬂat discs in Z are the maps11 ut
s : D →Z = D × Cn−1
deﬁned by
ut
s(z) := (z, s + it),
where s + it is a parameter in Cn−1.
If ut
s(D) is contained in the region where J = J0, then obviously ut
s ∈M.
We want to demonstrate the converse of this observation.
11We tend to write Int(D) or D for the open and closed unit disc, respectively, as domains
of deﬁnition, but B and B = D for the same sets in the target space. Occasionally, it becomes
impractical to stick to this convention, e.g. right here in the proof that follows.

I.8. A moduli space of J-holomorphic discs
39
Proposition I.8.24. Let u ∈M be a J-holomorphic disc such that u(D) ⊂R2n is
contained in the region where J = J0. Then, u = ut
s for some s, t ∈Rn−1.
Proof. By the Lagrangian boundary condition (M1), there is a level
t = (t2, . . . , tn) ∈Rn−1
such that u(∂D) ⊂Lt. If we write u = (u1, u2, . . . , un), this implies that for
j = 2, . . . , n we have holomorphic functions
uj −itj : (D, ∂D) −→(C, R).
This means that ± Im(uj −itj) are harmonic functions on D that vanish along
∂D. By the maximum principle, Im(uj −itj) vanishes identically. The Cauchy–
Riemann equations then imply that Re(uj −itj) is constant, so that uj = sj + itj
for some sj ∈R, j = 2, . . . , n.
Now consider the holomorphic function
u1 : (D, ∂D) −→(C, ∂D).
By the three-point condition (M3), this map is not constant, so the maximum
principle implies u1(B) ⊂B. The argument principle says that the number of
zeros of u1 in B (counted with multiplicities) equals the winding number of the
curve u1|∂D about 0. The latter equals 1 by the homotopy condition (M2). Thus,
u1 has a single zero at a point z0 ∈B, say, and this has to be of order 1.
By considering the function u1 −b for any b ∈B, and observing that the
winding number of (u1−b)|∂D about 0 likewise equals 1, we see that u1 is a bijection
of B. Locally, any holomorphic function (up to a coordinate transformation in the
domain of deﬁnition and a translation in the image) looks like z 7→zk, so it is
locally bijective if and only if its derivative is nonzero, which then means it actually
is locally biholomorphic. Thus, we have u1|B ∈Aut(B). Since, by Remark I.8.4,
the automorphisms of B are given by the restriction of automorphisms of D, we
have u1 ∈Aut(D).
The three-point condition (M3) then implies, by Note I.7.11, that u1 is the
identity map of D.
□
The next exercise provides an alternative argument for the penultimate para-
graph in the preceding proof.
Exercise I.8.25. Let f : (D, ∂D) →(D, ∂D) be a continuous function that is holo-
morphic on Int(D). Further assume that f has a single zero, which is of order 1.
Use the arguments from Sections I.8.1 and I.8.2 to show that f ∈Aut(D).
♦
Given what we have learned so far, it is still conceivable that the family of
J-holomorphic discs that do pass through the region where J ̸= J0 does not stay
inside a bounded region of R2n. Fortunately, with the geometric a priori bounds
that we shall establish in the next chapter, this pathological scenario can be ruled
out. In particular, this means that even though the manifold M is noncompact,
its ‘ends’ are easy to understand and control.

Chapter II
Compactness
The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha’s,
And these are of them: whither are they vanish’d?
William Shakespeare, Macbeth
The moduli space M has inﬁnite ends made up of ﬂat discs, so it is certainly
not compact. Nonetheless, the properness of the evaluation map claimed in The-
orem I.8.13 is a compactness statement of sorts. The present chapter contains the
proof of this statement, except for an analytical ‘bootstrapping’ argument that is
relegated to Chapter III.
In Section II.1 we look at what we call the nonstandard discs, i.e. those discs
u ∈M whose image u(D) intersects the embedded ball Φ(Br+ε) where the almost
complex structure J (potentially) diﬀers from J0 (Deﬁnition II.1.8). We show that
the images of the nonstandard discs lie in a bounded region of R2n. This C0-bound
is the ﬁrst ingredient in establishing that the noncompactness of the moduli space
is caused only by the ends of ﬂat discs. Key ingredients here are the maximum
principle and the boundary lemma of E. Hopf, so the reasoning is mostly geometric.
The essential results of this discussion are summarised in Section II.1.6.
A further source of noncompactness of the moduli space might be the phe-
nomenon of ‘bubbling’ in sequences of holomorphic discs. The analytical arguments
in the remainder of this chapter and in Chapter III serve to rule out this limiting
behaviour of discs in M.
In Section II.2 we ﬁrst introduce the basic analytical tools (Ck-norms, Fr´echet
metric, Arzel`a–Ascoli theorem) and show that properness of the evaluation map
will be a consequence of establishing uniform Ck-bounds on the nonstandard discs.
In Section II.2.3 we then describe the bubbling phenomenon for sequences of
holomorphic discs (with target spaces other than those in our Theorem I.8.13); in
other words, the phenomenon that we should like to rule out in the context of the
nonsqueezing theorem.

Chapter II. Compactness
A basic observation is that in a manifold with an exact symplectic form ω =
dλ there cannot be any nonconstant J-holomorphic spheres for an ω-compatible
almost complex structure J. In the remainder of Section II.2 we show that the
failure of a uniform C1-bound would result in precisely such impossible spheres
in R2n.
The contradictory properties of purported limit curves that would result from
the failure of a C1-bound are established by geometric arguments based again on an
isoperimetric inequality. These arguments are the content of Sections II.3 and II.4.
This concludes the proof of the existence of a uniform C1-bound. To get from
there to Ck-bounds for higher k requires a considerable amount of analysis, as we
shall see in Chapter III.
II.1
Geometric a priori bounds
In this section we establish a C0-bound on the nonstandard discs, and we show
that all discs in M take their image inside the closed cylinder Z. We also discuss
the boundary behaviour of these holomorphic discs.
Remark II.1.1. An ‘a priori bound’ (or the similar term ‘a priori estimate’ in
Chapter III) is an estimate of the ‘size’ of a purported solution to a geometric
problem or diﬀerential equation, i.e. typically a bound on some appropriate norm of
such a solution, prior to any knowledge about the actual existence of any solution.
The norm in question may (and in our case, will) involve higher derivatives of
the solution. Often, such a priori bounds form part of the subsequent proof that
solutions really do exist.
II.1.1
Schwarz reﬂection in the unit circle
We ﬁrst recall the classical Schwarz reﬂection principle.
Notation II.1.2. Given a subset U ∈C, in the context of Schwarz reﬂection we
write
U := {z ∈C: z ∈U}
for the conjugate set. There should be little danger of confusing this with the
notation for the closure of a set used elsewhere.
Proposition II.1.3 (Schwarz Reﬂection in the Real Line). Let U be an open subset
of the closed upper half-plane H := {z ∈C: Im z ≥0}. Let f : U →C be a
continuous function that is holomorphic on {z ∈U : Im z > 0} and takes real
values on U ∩R. Then the function ˆf : U ∪U →C, well deﬁned by
ˆf(z) :=
(
f(z)
for z ∈U,
f(z)
for z ∈U,
is holomorphic.
□

II.1. Geometric a priori bounds
43
For our purposes, we need a variant of this result, where reﬂection in the
real line is replaced by inversion in the unit circle. The proof of this latter result,
which we include here, is easily adapted to the previous result.
Inversion in the unit circle S1 ⊂C is the diﬀeomorphism of C\{0} that sends
a point z to the point w on the same ray from the origin, and such that |zw| = 1.
So the map is described by z 7→z/|z|2 = 1/z. Notice that the ﬁxed point set of
this inversion is S1. In fact, we may regard the inversion as a diﬀeomorphism of
the Riemann sphere ˆC, sending 0 to ∞and vice versa.
Proposition II.1.4 (Schwarz Reﬂection in the Unit Circle). Let U be an open subset
of the closed unit disc D. Let f : U →C be a continuous function that is holo-
morphic on {z ∈U : |z| < 1} and takes real values on U ∩∂D. Then the function
ˆf : U ∪(1/U) →C, well deﬁned by
ˆf(z) :=
(
f(z)
for z ∈U,
f(1/z)
for z ∈(1/U),
is holomorphic.
Recall from Exercise I.3.9 that a diﬀerentiable map f : G →C is holomorphic
if and only if its diﬀerential is complex linear, which means that J0 ◦Tf = Tf ◦J0.
Similarly, we call a linear map L: R2 →R2 complex anti-linear if J0◦L = −L◦J0;
cf. Section I.7.3.
Exercise II.1.5. Show that the diﬀerentials of the maps z 7→z and z 7→1/z are
complex anti-linear. This is true even at the points 0 and ∞; one has to use the
holomorphic chart z 7→1/z around the point ∞in the Riemann sphere.
♦
Proof of Proposition II.1.4. The function ˆf is continuous on U ∪(1/U), and holo-
morphic on U ∩{|z| < 1}. It is also holomorphic on (1/U) ∩{|z| > 1}, since
the diﬀerential of z 7→f(1/z) is the composition of one complex linear and two
complex anti-linear maps.
The theorem of Morera [J¨anich 1999] says that if the integral
R
∂∆ˆf dz of the
continuous function ˆf along the boundary curve ∂∆(oriented counter-clockwise)
of any triangle ∆⊂U ∪(1/U) vanishes, then ˆf is holomorphic.
Thus, consider such a triangle ∆. If ∆is contained in U ∩{|z| < 1} or
(1/U) ∩{|z| > 1}, where ˆf is holomorphic, then
R
∂∆ˆf dz = 0 by the Cauchy
integral theorem. Otherwise, consider the regions
Qε
0 := ∆∩{|z| ≤1 −ε}
and
Qε
1 := ∆∩{|z| ≥1 + ε};
see Figure II.1.
Then

ˆf dz = 0 for j = 0, 1 by the Cauchy integral theorem, but thanks

Remark II.1.6. Under the M¨obius transformation z 7→z−i
z+i of ˆC, the closed upper
half-plane H is mapped biholomorphically to D \ {1}; cf. Exercise II.2.13 below.
This M¨obius transformation conjugates the reﬂection z 7→z in the real line to the
inversion z 7→1/z in the unit circle, and the two versions of Schwarz reﬂection
correspond to each other under this conjugation.
Exercise II.1.7. Replace the assumption f(U ∩∂D) ⊂R in Proposition II.1.4 by

II.1.2
A bound on boundaries
As a ﬁrst step towards proving Theorem I.8.13, we want to establish a bound
on the region where the boundaries of the nonstandard discs can lie. For ease of
notation, we assume that the almost complex structure J on R2n coincides with
J0 outside Φ(Br), rather than Φ(Br+ε). In this section, all balls with dimension
not speciﬁed are understood to be of dimension 2n. As before, we write Dr for
the closure of Br. Notice that the closure of Φ(Br) equals Φ(Dr), since Φ is an
embedding of a slightly larger ball Br0.
Deﬁnition II.1.8. The nonstandard discs are the J-holomorphic discs u ∈M with
u(D) ∩Φ(Br) ̸= ∅.
We write Mnst ⊂M for the subspace of nonstandard discs.
Choose K > 0 large enough such that Φ(Dr) is contained in B2 × B2n−2
K
⊂
R2 × R2n−2.

II.1. Geometric a priori bounds
45
Lemma II.1.9. There is a bounded region in R2n that contains the boundaries
u(∂D) of all u ∈Mnst.
Proof. Given u ∈Mnst, let G be the component of the preimage u−1 R2n\Φ(Dr)

containing ∂D. Notice that G is an open subset of D, the map u is holomorphic
on G, and the boundary of G in D (i.e. the set of points in the closure of G but
not in G) is mapped under u to Φ(∂Dr).
Let t ∈Rn−1 be the level of u, that is, u(∂D) ⊂Lt. Write u on G in complex
components as u = (u1, . . . , un), and set
h := (u2 −it2, . . . , un −itn): (G, ∂D) −→(Cn−1, Rn−1).
Denote by ˆh: ˆG →Cn−1 the holomorphic continuation of h by Schwarz reﬂection
to ˆG := G ∪(1/G).
Choose zm ∈∂D such that u(zm) =: (p1, p) ⊂C × Cn−1 maximises the
distance — among points in u(∂D) — to the ‘box’ B2 × B2n−2
K
containing Φ(Dr).
Denote this maximal distance by R. If u(∂D) happens to lie entirely inside the
box, we no longer need to be concerned with that u, so we only consider the case
R > 0. Our aim is to ﬁnd a bound on R, independent of u.

For the second and third inequality in this line we have used that u1 and h, as

Exercise I.4.18 we have ˆh∗ωn−1 ≥0, which gives the second inequality. For the

A bound on nonstandard discs
Next we extend Lemma II.1.9 to a bound on the full nonstandard discs.
Lemma II.1.10. There is a bounded region in R2n that contains the images u(D)
of all u ∈Mnst.
Proof. Choose K > 0 large enough such that the ball BK ⊂R2n contains Φ(Dr)
and the boundaries u(∂D) of all nonstandard discs. On a neighbourhood of the
complement R2n \ BK we have J = J0.
For a given nonstandard disc u, deﬁne G := u−1(R2n \ DK); this is an open
subset of D whose closure is contained in Int(D). The function |u| is subharmonic
on G, takes values larger than K on G, and the value K on ∂G. This would
contradict the maximum principle (Theorem I.4.10), unless G = ∅. So we must
have u(D) ⊂DK.
□
Exercise II.1.11. Use the maximum principle and an open-closed argument to
show that |u| cannot attain the value K at any interior point of D, and conclude
that u(D) ⊂BK.
♦
II.1.4
The boundary lemma of E. Hopf
The Hopf lemma will play a crucial role in some of our arguments. In its proof we
use the weak maximum principle (Exercise I.4.12), and then we ask you to derive
the (strong) maximum principle (Theorem I.4.10) from it.
We say that a domain G ⊂C has a C2-boundary if each point of ∂G has
a neighbourhood in C in which ∂G is the graph of a C2-function (and G the
subgraph). In particular, ∂G is a curve that admits a regular C2-parametrisation,
that is, with nonvanishing velocity.
Proposition II.1.12 (Boundary Lemma of E. Hopf). Let G ⊂C be a bounded
domain with C2-boundary, and let f : G →R be a continuous function on the
closure G of G that is smooth and subharmonic on G. Suppose there is a boundary

48
Chapter II. Compactness
point z0 ∈∂G where f is diﬀerentiable, and such that f(z) < f(z0) for all z ∈G
close to z0. Then the directional derivative of f at z0 in the direction of the outward
normal is positive.
Proof. The C2-smoothness of ∂G means that this boundary curve has a well-
deﬁned notion of curvature, depending continuously on the point. This allows one
to ﬁnd a closed disc contained in G that touches ∂G in the point z0 only; see
Exercise II.1.14 below. By choosing this disc small enough, we may assume that
f(z) < f(z0) on the whole disc. Moreover, by scaling and translation we may
assume this to be the closed unit disc D, and by subtracting f(z0) (now with
z0 ∈∂D) from f we may assume that f(z0) = 0, so that f is negative on D \ {z0}.
Exercise II.1.13. Check that the function
g(z) := f(z) + ε
 e−2r2 −e−2
is subharmonic on the annulus A := {3/4 < |z| < 1} and satisﬁes g < 0 on
∂A \ {z0} for ε > 0 small enough.
♦
By the weak maximum principle (Exercise I.4.12) we have
max
z∈A
g(z) = max
z∈∂A g(z) = 0.
With ∂r denoting the radial derivative (which is the derivative in the direction of
the outward normal along ∂D), this implies ∂rg(z0) ≥0, whence
∂rf(z0) ≥−ε∂r|r=1
 e−2r2 −e−2
= 4εe−2 > 0,
as we wanted to show.
□
Exercise II.1.14. In the situation of the Hopf lemma, let γ : R/LZ →∂G be a C2-
parametrisation by arc length of a component of ∂G, where L is the length of that
component. The curvature of γ is deﬁned as κ(s) = |γ′′(s)|. Set κ0 := maxs κ(s),
and let n be the outer normal to ∂G at z0. Let C be the circle with centre z0−n/κ0
and radius 1/κ0. Show that near z0, the boundary curve ∂G lies outside C (except
at the point z0, where the curves touch). Show that by possibly choosing a smaller
radius (depending on the global shape of ∂G), one can ﬁnd a closed disc contained
in G and touching ∂G in z0 only.
♦
In this exercise we have used the boundedness of G, but not in an essential
way, and the desired conclusion can be reached under milder conditions. Notice,
however, that the deﬁnition of C2-boundary is a condition not only on ∂G, but
also on the behaviour of G near the boundary.
Exercise II.1.15. Give an example of a bounded domain G ⊂C whose boundary
is a compact collection of regular C2-curves, but where a disc as in the previous
exercise cannot be found at every boundary point.
♦

II.1. Geometric a priori bounds
49
Exercise II.1.16. Use the Hopf lemma to prove the strong maximum principle.
Hint: Without loss of generality, you may take the domain G to be bounded.
Assuming that the subharmonic function f : G →R attains its supremum but is
not constant, argue that the subset {z ∈G: f(z) = max f}, which is closed in G,
must have boundary points in G. Then, ﬁnd an open disc B = B2
ε(z0) contained
in the open set {z ∈G: f(z) < max f}, with B ⊂G and ∂B ∩{z ∈G: f(z) =
max f} ̸= ∅. Derive a contradiction using the Hopf lemma.
♦
II.1.5
Boundaries are embedded
In this section we consider all discs u ∈M, not just the nonstandard ones.
Lemma II.1.17. Every u ∈M sends Int(D) into the cylinder Z = B2 × R2n−2.
Proof. Consider the open subset G := u−1 R2n\Φ(Dr)

of D. Write the boundary
of G as ∂G = ∂D⊔∂iG, with ∂iG denoting the boundary points of G in the interior
of D; this set ∂iG may be empty, in case G = D. Since u(∂iG) ⊂Φ(Dr) ⊂Z, the
ﬁrst component u1 of u satisﬁes
u1|∂iG
 < 1 =
u1|∂D
.
The map u1|G : G →C is holomorphic with respect to the standard complex
structure on C, so the maximum principle implies
u1|G\∂D
 < 1, which means
u(G \ ∂D) ⊂Z.
By the deﬁnition of G, the complement D\G is sent by u to Φ(Dr) ⊂Z.
□
Lemma II.1.18. Every u ∈M restricts to an embedding u|∂D : ∂D →∂Z.
Proof. On a neighbourhood of ∂D in D, the map u1 is holomorphic. So the Hopf
lemma, applied to the subharmonic function |u1|, tells us that along u(∂D) the
vector Tu1(∂r) is nonzero and points out of Z. Along ∂D we have ∂θ = i∂r, so the
holomorphicity of u1 means that
Tu1(∂θ) = J0Tu1(∂r)
along u(∂D).
Since u1(∂D) ⊂∂B2, the vector Tu1(∂θ) must be tangent to S1 = ∂B2. Then
the previous equation means that Tu1(∂r) must in fact be orthogonal to S1 (and
nonzero), and Tu1(∂θ) positively tangent to S1 along u(∂D).
Since u1|∂D is homotopic to the identity map ∂D →S1 by the homotopy
condition (M2), u1|∂D is a diﬀeomorphism ∂D →S1 (rather than a multiple cover).
It follows that u|∂D is an embedding ∂D →∂Z.
□
II.1.6
The evaluation map
The considerations of the previous sections can be summarised in the following
properties of the evaluation map ev: M × D →R2n:
(EV1)
ev(M × D) ⊂Z.

II.2
Uniform gradient bounds
We now turn our attention to C1-bounds on the holomorphic discs in M.
II.2.1
The Fr´echet metric
On the space C∞(D, Rm) of smooth maps u: D →Rm (see Remark I.3.7) we
have, for k ∈N0 := {0, 1, 2, . . .}, the Ck-norms
∥u∥C0 := max
z∈D |u(z)|
and
∥u∥Ck :=
X
|α|≤k
∥Dαu∥C0,
k ∈N.
Here, α = (α1, α2) ∈N0 × N0 is a double index, |α| := α1 + α2, and
Dαu :=
∂|α|u
∂xα1 ∂yα2 .
We can then deﬁne the so-called Fr´echet metric
d(u, v) :=
∞
X
k=0

2k ·
∥u −v∥Ck
1 + ∥u −v∥Ck
(II.2)
on C∞(D, Rm).
Exercise II.2.1. Convergence with respect to this metric is the same as uniform
convergence of all derivatives.
♦
A (possibly degenerate) metric as in (II.2) can be deﬁned starting from any
countable sequence of seminorms on a vector space.
Deﬁnition II.2.2. A Fr´echet space is a vector space E with a family of seminorms
| . |k, k ∈N0, such that the following conditions hold:
(i) If v ∈E satisﬁes |v|k = 0 for all k ∈N0, then v = 0; this is equivalent to
saying that the corresponding Fr´echet metric is nondegenerate.
(ii) E is complete with respect to the Fr´echet metric.

II.2. Uniform gradient bounds
51
Exercise II.2.3. Verify the triangle inequality for the Fr´echet metric. Show that
the spaces Ck(D, Rm), k ∈N0, and C∞(D, Rm) are complete with respect to the
Ck-norm and the Fr´echet metric, respectively. So the former are Banach spaces;
the latter is a Fr´echet space.
Hint: Recall (or prove) that the pointwise limit of a C0 Cauchy sequence is actually
the uniform limit. Moreover, it suﬃces to prove completeness for real-valued C1-
functions on an interval [a, b]. Use the fundamental theorem of calculus to show
that uniform convergence of a sequence of functions fν : [a, b] →R and of the
sequence (f ′
ν) of derivatives implies the diﬀerentiability of the pointwise limit f :=
lim fν with f ′ = lim f ′
ν. See also [Wall 2016, Theorem A.4.7].
♦
Remark II.2.4. In the metric space C∞(D, Rm), sequential compactness is the
same as compactness in the sense of coverings; see [J¨anich 1996]. Similarly, in
Lemma II.2.6 below, we use that the notions of continuity and sequential continuity
are equivalent in metric spaces.
In fact, for the equivalence of continuity and sequential continuity, it suﬃces
that the domain of deﬁnition be a topological space with a countable local base
(a.k.a. neighbourhood base) for its topology, that is, a ﬁrst-countable space.
On C∞(D, Rm), the topology induced by the Fr´echet metric is the C∞-
topology, that is, the union of the compact-open Ck-topologies for all k ∈N0;
cf. Exercise II.2.1. See [Hirsch 1976] for details on this topology. A countable local
base around f0 ∈C∞(D, Rm) is provided by the sets {f : ∥f −f0∥Ck < 1/k},
k ∈N.
Exercise II.2.5. Let J be an almost complex structure on R2n compatible with
the standard symplectic form ω, and u: D →R2n a smooth J-holomorphic disc.
Observe from Exercise I.8.18 that u∗ω = 1
2|∇u|2
J dx∧dy, and use this to show that
the operator norm ∥Tzu∥op of Tzu: TzD →Tu(z)R2n with respect to the metric

z∈D ∥Tzu∥op = 1

In particular, for a set of J-holomorphic discs to have a uniform C1-bound is
equivalent to it having a uniform C0-bound and a uniform bound on gradients.♦
Lemma II.2.6. The evaluation map ev: C∞(D, R2n) × D →R2n is continuous.
Proof. Given sequences (uν) with uν →u in C∞(D, R2n), and (zν) with zν →z
in D, we have
|ev(uν, zν) −ev(u, z)|
=
|uν(zν) −u(z)|
≤
|uν(zν) −u(zν)| + |u(zν) −u(z)|
≤
∥uν −u∥C0 + |u(zν) −u(z)| →0
by the C0-uniform convergence uν →u and the continuity of u.
□

52
Chapter II. Compactness
We equip the subset M ⊂C∞(D, R2n) with the induced topology. Here is
the main result of this section.
Theorem II.2.7. The evaluation map ev: M × D →R2n is proper.
Let K ⊂M × D be the preimage under ev of a compact subset in R2n. For
ﬂat discs ut
s we have ev(ut
s, z) = (z, s + it), so that every sequence in K with ﬁrst
component made up of ﬂat discs has a convergent subsequence, since both the
sν + itν and the zν lie in a compact set. So it suﬃces to prove compactness of
the closure of the space Mnst of nonstandard discs, since then the closed subset
K ∩(Mnst × D) ⊂Mnst × D will likewise be compact.
Lemma II.1.10 can be read as saying that Mnst is uniformly C0-bounded:
∃K0 > 0 ∀u ∈Mnst : ∥u∥C0 < K0.
Our aim is to establish a uniform C1-bound:
∃K1 > 0 ∀u ∈Mnst : ∥u∥C1 < K1.
In Chapter III we shall see by a ‘bootstrapping’ argument that the C1-bound
implies boundedness in the Ck-norm for all k ∈N.
II.2.2
The Arzel`a–Ascoli theorem
As a preparation, we prove a version of the Arzel`a–Ascoli theorem suﬃcient for the
purpose of reducing the properness of the evaluation map to ﬁnding Ck-bounds
on Mnst. We consider the Banach space C0(D, Rm) of continuous maps D →Rm
with the C0-norm.
Deﬁnition II.2.8. A sequence (uν) in C0(D, Rm) is called uniformly equicontinuous
if for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that |uν(z) −uν(w)| < ε for all z, w ∈D
with |z −w| < δ and all ν ∈N.
Proposition II.2.9 (Arzel`a–Ascoli). Every bounded, uniformly equicontinuous se-
quence (uν) in C0(D, R2n) has a uniformly convergent subsequence.
Proof. Choose a countable dense subset of points z1, z2, . . . in D. The boundedness
of (uν) implies that there is a subsequence (u1ν) that converges in the point z1, a
further subsequence (u2ν) that converges in the point z2, and so on. The diagonal
sequence (uνν) then converges pointwise on a dense subset of points.
We write again (uν) for this diagonal subsequence and claim that it is a
Cauchy sequence. Given ε > 0, let δ be as in the deﬁnition of equicontinuity.
Choose ﬁnitely many convergence points a1, . . . , aN of (uν) such that the open
discs Bδ(aj) cover D. Then, choose n0 ∈N such that |uν(aj) −uµ(aj)| < ε for all
ν, µ ≥n0 and all j = 1, . . . , N.
Then, given z ∈D, choose an aj =: a with |z −a| < δ. It follows that
|uν(z) −uµ(z)| ≤|uν(z) −uν(a)| + |uν(a) −uµ(a)| + |uµ(a) −uµ(z)| < 3ε
for ν, µ ≥n0, which proves the claim.
□

II.2. Uniform gradient bounds
53
Corollary II.2.10.
(a) Every sequence (uν) in C∞(D, Rm) that is bounded in the
C0- and the C1-norm has a subsequence uniformly convergent in C0(D, Rm).
(b) Every sequence (uν) in C∞(D, Rm) that is bounded in each of the Ck-norms,
k ∈N0, has a convergent subsequence with respect to the Fr´echet metric.
Proof. (a) The boundedness in the C1-norm means that the ﬁrst-order partial
derivatives of the uν are bounded uniformly in z ∈D and ν ∈N. By the mean
value theorem, so is
|uν(z) −uν(w)|
|z −w|
.
This says that (uν) is uniformly equicontinuous, and hence by Arzel`a–Ascoli pos-
sesses a subsequence uniformly convergent to some u ∈C0(D, Rm).
(b) The same argument applies to the ﬁrst partial derivatives of the uν.
Hence, passing to a further subsequence we may assume that Dαuν is convergent
in C0(D, Rm) for both α = (1, 0) and (0, 1).
In particular, (uν) is then a C1 Cauchy sequence, which by completeness
converges in C1(D, Rm), and the limit must of course still be u. This proves u ∈
C1(D, Rm). Iterating this argument we establish that u ∈C∞(D, Rm), and the
diagonal sequence in the subsequences we have constructed will converge in all
Ck-norms, k ∈N.
□
This corollary, together with the remarks after Theorem II.2.7, says that
Theorem II.2.7 will follow from having uniform Ck-bounds on Mnst for all k ∈N0.
Exercise II.2.11. Show that M is a closed subset of C∞(D, R2n).
♦
This exercise implies that the closure of Mnst in M is the same as the closure
in C∞(D, R2n).
II.2.3
Examples of bubbling
The idea for establishing a uniform C1-bound will be, arguing by contradiction,
that if such a bound did not exist, a certain bubbling-oﬀphenomenon would have
to occur, which in the concrete situation at hand can be ruled out.
In order to get a feel for this phenomenon and the reparametrisations of
holomorphic discs that are necessary in the process, here we present three simple
examples where bubbling does occur.
Bubble sphere at an interior point.
Consider the sequence (uν)ν∈N of holomor-
phic discs in D × ˆC given by
uν :
D

D × ˆC
z

(z, ν2z).

Chapter II. Compactness
Observe that the circle {|z| = 1/ν} in D is mapped by uν to

(eiθ/ν, νeiθ): θ ∈R/2πZ
	
,
and this embedded circle ‘converges’ to the point (0, ∞) ∈D × ˆC as ν →∞.
Next we consider the restriction of uν to the annulus {1/ν < |z| ≤1}. As
ν →∞, the domains of deﬁnition form a nested sequence ﬁlling out D \ {0}, and
the maps converge pointwise to
D \ {0}
−→
D × ˆC
z
7−→
(z, ∞).
On any compact subset of D \ {0}, the convergence is uniform in all Ck-norms; on
the ˆC-factor one should look at this in the chart z 7→1/z around the point z = ∞.
Exercise II.2.12. Carry out this last step. For the convergence of the derivatives,
consider compact subsets in D \ {0} independent of ν.
♦
We call this, somewhat loosely, C∞
loc(D \ {0})-convergence. Obviously, the
limit map can be completed to the holomorphic disc z 7→(z, ∞) deﬁned on all
of D.
Finally, we consider the restriction of uν to the open disc B1/ν = {|z| < 1/ν}.
Let vν be the reparametrised map
vν(z) := uν(z/ν2) = (z/ν2, z),
z ∈Bν ⊂C.
Here we have C∞
loc(C)-convergence to the map
C
−→
D × C
z
7−→
(0, z),
which can be completed to a holomorphic sphere ˆC →D × ˆC by including the
point z = ∞. This bubble sphere and the disc found as the limit of annuli connect
at the limit point (0, ∞) of the ‘waist’ circle.
Bubble sphere at a boundary point.
The M¨obius transformation
z 7−→z −i
z + i
of ˆC restricts to a biholomorphism from ˆH :=

z ∈C: Im z ≥0
	
∪{∞} to D.
Exercise II.2.13. Verify this.
♦
By this exercise, we may parametrise a holomorphic disc by ˆH. Consider the
sequence (uν) of holomorphic discs in ˆH × ˆC given by
uν :
ˆH

ˆH × ˆC
z


z, z −(ν2 + 1)i
z −(ν2 −1)i

.

II.2. Uniform gradient bounds
55
The image of the circle {Im z = ν} ∪{∞} ⊂ˆH under uν converges to the point
(∞, 1) as ν →∞. The strips {0 ≤Im z < ν} form a nested sequence ﬁlling out
H = {z ∈C: Im z ≥0}, and the maps uν on these respective strips C∞
loc(H)-
converge to
H
−→
ˆH × ˆC
z
7−→
(z, 1).
This completes to a holomorphic disc by ∞7→(∞, 1).
As to the restriction of uν to the open disc {z ∈C: Im z > ν}, the reparame-
trised map
vν(z) :=

z + ν2, z −i
z + i

,
for z ∈C with Im(z) > ν −ν2,

which can be completed to a holomorphic sphere by including the point z = ∞.

You should ﬁnd a ‘double bubble’, one sphere attached to a disc (at an interior
point), and a second sphere attached to the ﬁrst one.

Bubble disc at a boundary point.
Consider the sequence (uν) of holomorphic
discs
uν :

The semicircle {|z| = 1/ν} ∩ˆH is mapped by uν to

(eiθ/ν, νeiθ): θ ∈[0, π]
	
,
which shrinks to the point (0, ∞) as ν →∞.
The sets {|z| > 1/ν} ∩ˆH ﬁll out ˆH \ {0} as ν →∞, and the maps uν
C∞
loc(ˆH \ {0})-converge to
ˆH \ {0}
−→
ˆH × ˆH
z
7−→
(z, ∞).
This can be completed in the obvious way to a map deﬁned on all of ˆH, i.e. to a
holomorphic disc.

56
Chapter II. Compactness
On the half-discs {|z| < 1/ν} ∩ˆH we reparametrise the map as
vν(z) := uν(z/ν2) = (z/ν2, z),
z ∈Bν ∩ˆH.
As ν →∞, this converges to
H
−→
ˆH × ˆH
z
7−→
(0, z),
which can be completed to a holomorphic disc by including the point z = ∞.
Remark II.2.15. An explicit and elementary example of bubbling for solutions of
an inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equation is discussed in [Polterovich 2001,
Section 4.4].
II.2.4
The bubbling-oﬀargument
We now want to establish a uniform bound on the gradients of the nonstandard
J-holomorphic discs. By Exercise II.2.5, this will yield the desired C1-bound. In
that exercise we used the metric ⟨. , . ⟩J corresponding to the almost complex
structure J, but for establishing the bound on gradients we may likewise work
with the standard metric, thanks to the next exercise.
Exercise II.2.16. The metric ⟨. , . ⟩J on R2n and the standard metric deﬁne equiv-
alent norms, i.e. there is a constant C ≥1 such that
1
C | . | ≤| . |J ≤C | . |.
Hint: The largest and smallest eigenvalue of a positive deﬁnite symmetric matrix
A ∈Rm×m can be found as the maximum and minimum, respectively, of ⟨Av, v⟩,
as v ranges over the unit sphere Sm−1 ⊂Rm. Use this to show that, for a contin-
uous family At of matrices, these eigenvalues depend continuously on t. Then use
the fact that J diﬀers from J0 only on a compact subset of R2n.
♦
Arguing by contradiction, we assume that there is no uniform bound on
gradients. This means that we ﬁnd a sequence (uν) in Mnst with
Rν := max
z∈D |∇uν(z)| −→∞
as ν →∞.
Let tν ∈Rn−1 be the level of uν determined by the boundary condition (M1). By
Lemma II.1.9, the sequence (tν) is bounded, and by passing to a subsequence we
may assume that
tν −→t0
as ν →∞
for some t0 ∈Rn−1. For each ν pick a point zν ∈D with
|∇uν(zν)| = max
z∈D |∇uν(z)| = Rν.

II.2. Uniform gradient bounds
57
Again without loss of generality, we may assume that the sequence (zν) converges
in D:
zν −→z0 ∈D
as ν →∞.
We now distinguish whether z0 ∈Int(D) or z0 ∈∂D.
Case 1:
z0 ∈Int(D).
Choose ε > 0 small enough such that Bε(zν) ⊂Int(D) for ν suﬃciently large. The
M¨obius transformation
z 7−→zν + z
Rν
of C sends the open disc1 BRνε diﬀeomorphically onto Bε(zν), so that for large ν
we can deﬁne J-holomorphic maps
vν :

The following properties of the vν are straightforward; for the estimate in (iii) we
use Lemma I.8.16:
(i) |∇vν| = |∇uν|/Rν ≤1,
(ii) |∇vν(0)| = |∇uν(zν)|/Rν = 1,
(iii)

The uniform C0-bound on the nonstandard discs from Lemma II.1.10 also
applies to the vν. A C1-bound comes from (i) and Exercise II.2.5. With the boot-
strapping argument from Chapter III and Corollary II.2.10, this proves — replac-
ing D by any closed disc Dk, k ∈N — that (vν) has a subsequence (vkν)ν∈N
convergent in C∞(Dk, R2n).
By choosing these subsequences successively as a subsequence of the pre-
ceding one, and then taking the diagonal sequence, we arrive at a subsequence,
which we now call (vν) again, that converges on any compact subset of C. Beware
that the vν are not deﬁned on all of C, but on any given compact subset they
will be deﬁned for suﬃciently large ν. The pointwise limit v of the vν is then in
C∞(C, R2n).
In the language introduced in Section II.2.3, the original sequence has a
C∞
loc(C)-convergent subsequence. We write (for the convergent subsequence (vν))
vν −→v in C∞
loc(C) as ν →∞.
Lemma II.2.17. This limit map v ∈C∞(C, R2n) has the following properties:
1Discs with centre not speciﬁed are understood to be centred at 0 ∈C.

Proof. Statement (V1) follows from the argument that you will have used to solve
Exercise II.2.11. Statement (V2) is a consequence of |∇v(0)| = 1, which holds
thanks to the C1-convergence of (vν) and property (ii) of this sequence. For (V3)
we note that (v∗

The claimed upper estimate in (V3) follows. The lower estimate is a consequence
of (V2) and the observation on page 37 that a nonconstant J-holomorphic curve
always has positive symplectic energy.
□
As we shall see in Section II.3, if a J-holomorphic curve v: C →R2n with
an upper energy bound as in (V3) maps a pointed neighbourhood of ∞∈ˆC to
the region in R2n where J = J0, one can use the Riemann removable singularities
theorem to extend v to a J-holomorphic sphere ˆv: ˆC →R2n. But the symplectic
form ω on R2n is exact, ω = dλ, so by Stokes we have
Z
C
v∗ω =
Z
ˆC
ˆv∗ω =

∂ˆC
ˆv∗λ = 0,
which contradicts the lower energy bound in (V3).
If the behaviour of v near ∞cannot be controlled in this way, one could
in principle still prove a version of the Riemann removable singularities theorem.
Instead, in Section II.3 we shall give a direct argument that
R
C v∗ω = 0.
Case 2:
z0 ∈∂D.
In this case it is more convenient to parametrise the J-holomorphic discs uν on
the upper half plane rather than D. As before, write H for the closed upper half
plane {z ∈C: Im z ≥0}, not including the point ∞.
Exercise II.2.18. Verify that the M¨obius transformation
gz0 : z 7−→−z0
z −i
z + i
of ˆC sends H to D \ {−z0}, the origin 0 to z0, the point ∞to −z0, and the closed
half-disc D+ := H∩D to the half-disc in D with z0 at the ‘zenith’; this is illustrated
in Figure II.4.

Figure II.4: Reparametrisation in Case 2.
We now replace the J-holomorphic discs uν by ˜uν := uν ◦gz0, and the se-
quence of points zν where the gradient blows up by the points ˜zν := g−1
z0 (zν).
Notice that the ˜zν converge to 0, and the symplectic energy of the ˜uν still equals
π by the transformation formula.
Remark II.2.19. On the compact set D+, the operator norm ∥Tzgz0∥op of gz0 is
bounded from above and by a positive constant from below.
Since the ˜zν lie in D+ for ν suﬃciently large, we still have that ˜Rν :=
|∇˜uν(˜zν)| goes to inﬁnity as ν →∞.
We now drop the tildes from the notation.
Choose ε > 0 small enough such that Bε(zν)∩H ⊂D+ for ν suﬃciently large.
Write zν = xν + iyν. Without loss of generality we may assume the existence of
the limit
r := lim
ν→∞Rνyν ∈[0, ∞].
Case 2.1:
r = ∞.
Here we reparametrise as in Case 1, but of course we need to be aware that we
work with Bε(zν)∩H, not the full disc Bε(zν). Thus, we deﬁne the J-holomorphic
maps
vν(z) := uν

zν + z
Rν

,
z ∈BRνε ∩{Im z ≥−Rνyν}.
By Remark II.2.19, the sequence of norms of gradients |∇vν| is uniformly
bounded from above, and by a positive constant from below at the point z = 0.
For the symplectic energy, we have
Z
BRν ε∩{Im z≥−Rνyν}
v∗
νω =

Bε(zν)∩H
u∗
νω ≤π.
Thus, we have properties completely analogous to (i)–(iii) on page 57. Any given
compact subset of C will be contained in the domain of deﬁnition of vν for ν suﬃ-
ciently large. Thus, as in Case 1, we obtain a C∞
loc(C)-limit v as in Lemma II.2.17,
and the same contradiction as before.

60
Chapter II. Compactness
Case 2.2:
r < ∞.
Here, the contradiction will not come from an impossible bubble sphere, but from
a bubble disc ruled out by the three-point condition (M3) in the deﬁnition of the
moduli space M.
In this case, we reparametrise uν : Bε(zν) ∩H →R2n, where we write zν =
xν + iyν, as
vν(z) := uν

xν + z
Rν

,
z ∈BRνε(iRνyν) ∩H.
Any compact subset of H will be contained in the domain of deﬁnition of vν for
ν suﬃciently large, since Rνε goes to inﬁnity, and iRνyν converges to the (ﬁnite)
point ir.
Again by Remark II.2.19, the sequence of norms of gradients |∇vν| is uni-
formly bounded from above, and the sequence |∇vν(iRνyν)| is bounded from below
by a positive constant, i.e. we have properties (i), (ii) as on page 57. The energy
estimate (iii) is likewise satisﬁed:
Z
BRν ε(iRνyν)∩H
v∗
νω =
Z
Bε(zν)∩H
u∗
νω ≤π.
Thus, analogous to the argument in Case 1, and because of tν →t0 as ν →∞,
we ﬁnd a subsequence C∞
loc(H)-convergent to a J-holomorphic map
v: (H, R) −→(R2n, Lt0)
with properties (V1)–(V3) as in Lemma II.2.17.
As we shall see, such a map v would have contradictory properties. The
argument is based on estimates analogous to those in Section II.3 for Case 1, so
we defer it to Section II.4.
II.3
An asymptotic isoperimetric inequality
The aim of this section is to show that a J-holomorphic map v: C →R2n with the
properties described in Lemma II.2.17 cannot exist, and hence that the gradient
of a sequence (uν) in M cannot blow up at an interior point of D (Case 1).
As the pointwise limit of (reparametrised) nonstandard discs, the (purported)
map v has its image v(C) contained in a bounded region of R2n by property (EV2)
in Section II.1.6.
Case 1.1:
For suﬃciently large R > 0, the image v
 C \ DR

is contained in the
region where J = J0.
In this case we shall appeal to the classical Riemann removable singularities the-
orem [J¨anich 1999] in order to extend v to a J-holomorphic sphere ˆv: ˆC →R2n
and arrive at a contradiction as explained on page 58. First, we lead the reader
through a simple proof of Riemann’s theorem.

II.3. An asymptotic isoperimetric inequality
61
Exercise II.3.1. Let G ⊂C be a domain containing the origin 0 ∈C, and let
f : G \ {0} →C be a bounded holomorphic function. Show that f extends to a
holomorphic function G →C by arguing as follows. Set
g(z) :=
(
z2f(z)
if z ∈G \ {0},
0
if z = 0.
Show that g is a holomorphic function on G with g′(0) = 0. Then use the power
series expansion of g at 0 to deﬁne a holomorphic extension of f.
♦
In the given case, we can apply this theorem to the components of the holo-
morphic map
z 7−→v(1/z),
z ∈B1/R \ {0},
to obtain the (contradictory) extension of v into the point ∞.
Case 1.2:
Without any further assumption on the map v one can still establish
a removable singularities theorem in the J-holomorphic setting — a complete
proof, relying on the minimality property of J-holomorphic curves, can be found
in [McDuﬀ& Salamon 2012, Section 4.5] — and then conclude as in Case 1.1.
Instead, we present an ad hoc argument, based on the isoperimetric inequality,
showing that a J-holomorphic map C →R2n with ﬁnite symplectic energy in fact
has energy 0, so a map v as in Lemma II.2.17 cannot exist.
Consider the loops γr : S1 = R/2πZ →R2n, r ∈R+, deﬁned by
γr(θ) := v
 1
reiθ

,
θ ∈S1.
For the following isoperimetric estimates, involving the length of γr and the energy
of v, we need an inequality coming from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for 2π-
periodic functions.
Exercise II.3.2. On the vector space of continuous functions S1 →R we deﬁne
the scalar product
⟨f, g⟩S1 := 1

Remark II.3.3. In Proposition I.5.4 we derived the classical isoperimetric inequal-
ity from the action-energy inequality. With the preceding exercise we see that,
conversely, the action-energy inequality follows from the isoperimetric inequality.

62
Chapter II. Compactness
Set w(x, y) := v(1/z), z = x + iy ∈C \ {0}, so that
γr(θ) = w(r cos θ, r sin θ).
Then γ′
r(θ) = −wx r sin θ + wy r cos θ. The map w is J-holomorphic; hence, wy =
Jwx, ⟨wx, wy⟩J = 0, and |wx|J = |wy|J. It follows that

r = −log ε diverges to ∞as ε →0, so from the estimate
above we conclude that LJ(γr) cannot be bounded from below for small r. In
other words, there must be a sequence rν ↘0 with LJ(γrν) →0 as ν →∞. By
Exercise II.2.16, the same limit behaviour is shared by the lengths L(γrν) measured
with respect to the standard metric on R2n.
By Exercise I.5.3, the action of γrν equals, up to sign, the symplectic energy
of v over the domain B1/rν:
−A(γrν) =
Z
B1/rν
v∗ω.
The minus sign comes from the fact that γrν is the negatively oriented boundary
curve of B1/rν. The isoperimetric inequality (Proposition I.5.4) then yields

It follows that

The same argument covers Case 2.1.

II.4
Boundary singularities
We now turn to the purported J-holomorphic map
v: (H, R) −→(R2n, Lt0)
found in Case 2.2 of Section II.2.4 and want to show that such a map cannot
actually exist (and hence that boundary bubbling does not occur).
As the C∞
loc-limit of a sequence of J-holomorphic maps mapping into the
closed cylinder Z = D2 × R2n−2 and sending boundary points into ∂Z, the map
v shares these properties. Thus, by the maximum principle, the interior of H is
mapped by v into the open cylinder Z = B2 × R2n−2. This allows us to apply the
Hopf lemma, and as in the proof of Lemma II.1.18 we conclude that v wraps ∂H
positively around ∂Z. More precisely, write v = (v1, . . . , vn) and
γ := v1|∂H :

In this chapter we want to make good on the promise from Chapter II that
starting from a C1-bound on Mnst one can ‘bootstrap’ (or ‘pigtail’, if one credits
M¨unchhausen with the invention of this method) to a Ck-bound for all k ∈N
(page 52), and that one can extract from a C1-bounded sequence of holomorphic
discs a subsequence convergent in C∞

The a priori estimate
First we are going to deal with arbitrary maps u ∈C∞
c
 BR, Rm
, that is, smooth
Rm-valued maps with compact support inside the open disc of radius R in C.
The relevant estimates involve various Sobolev norms. The reason why we cannot
directly work with Ck-norms or the Fr´echet metric on the space of C∞-maps will
be discussed in Section III.1.6.
In the present chapter we only deal with Sobolev norms on spaces of smooth
maps (or maps of class Ck). At a later stage we shall have to work with Sobolev
spaces of weakly diﬀerentiable maps, but on pedagogical grounds we delay the
introduction of these spaces until Chapter IV.

Chapter III. Bounds of Higher Order
III.1.1
Sobolev norms
Let G ⊂C be a domain. The Lp-norm, p ∈[1, ∞), of a continuous map u: G →
Rm is
∥u∥Lp(G) :=
Z
G
|u|p
1/p
,
where integration is with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure on C. (This
norm may of course take the value ∞unless we assume compact support, for
instance.)
Note III.1.1. In this deﬁnition, | . | can be any norm on Rm. Since any two such
norms are equivalent (Exercise II.2.16), diﬀerent choices will simply alter the con-
stants in the estimates we shall establish. A convenient choice is the ℓp-norm
|(u1, . . . , um)|p =
 |u1|p + · · · + |um|p1/p,
for then the pth power of the Lp-norm is additive, which means one can prove
estimates componentwise:
∥(u1, . . . , um)∥p
Lp(G) = ∥u1∥p
Lp(G) + · · · + ∥um∥p
Lp(G).
For the next deﬁnition, recall the notation from Section II.2.1.
Deﬁnition III.1.2. The Sobolev (k, p)-norm, k ∈N0, p ∈[1, ∞) of a smooth map
u: G →Rm is
∥u∥k,p,G :=
 X
|α|≤k
∥Dαu∥p
Lp(G)
1/p
.
Notice that ∥u∥0,p,G = ∥u∥Lp(G). We usually drop G from the notation when the
domain of deﬁnition is understood.
Note III.1.3. Again, since any two norms on RN are equivalent, the Sobolev (k, p)-
norm is equivalent to the norm
X
|α|≤k
∥Dαu∥Lp(G).
Thus, whenever we prove estimates, up to a constant, involving various Sobolev
norms, we may as well think and argue in terms of the respective equivalent norms.
Often this simpliﬁes the reasoning.

c (BR, R2n),
(III.1)
where p > 2 (this condition on p is required in the Sobolev inequality of Propo-
sition III.1.20). Even so, it is instructive to prove a corresponding estimate for
p = 2, which is technically much less involved.

The inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equation
As a further preparation, both for the a priori estimate and for the Fredholm
theory in Chapter V, we now want to study the inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann
equation
∂u = g
(iCR)
on the space of smooth functions C →Cn. Our presentation here closely follows
[Hofer & Zehnder 1994, Appendix 4].
For convenience, we drop the factor 1/2 from the Cauchy–Riemann operator,
that is, we take
∂= ∂x + i∂y : C∞(C, Cn) −→C∞(C, Cn).
The inhomogeneity g is assumed to lie in the vector space C∞

where dλ2
ζ denotes the 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure on C with respect to the
variable ζ. We ﬁrst need to convince ourselves that this integral exists.
Exercise III.1.8. Consider the function f : C →C deﬁned by f(z) = 1/z for z ̸= 0
(and f(0) arbitrary).

(b) Use the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem to show that f is inte-

♦
In fact, this improper integral, also known as the Cauchy principal value at 0,
can be deﬁned for functions g of lower regularity, for which the Lebesgue integral
over C may no longer exist owing to the singularity of the integrand at 0. For
smooth functions this is not an issue, but it is still convenient for computations
to think of the integral as a Cauchy principal value.
In particular, we can use this to establish the properties of the operator A by
ad hoc methods, rather than by appealing to general theory. Thus, for any given
ε > 0 we deﬁne
Aε : C∞

Aεg is continuous:
We show that Aεg is even locally Lipschitz continuous. Since the smooth function
g has compact support, it is globally Lipschitz continuous, i.e. there is a constant
M such that
|g(z2) −g(z1)| ≤M|z2 −z1|.

For g ∈C∞

satisﬁes Dα ◦A = A◦Dα for all derivatives Dα; cf. Section II.2.1 for this notation.
In particular, we have ∂◦A = A ◦∂:
It suﬃces to establish the identity De ◦A = A ◦De (and the existence of DeAg
in the ﬁrst place) for the directional derivative De in the direction e; the general

III.1.4
The Calder´on–Zygmund inequality
In this section we want to prove the following estimate.
Proposition III.1.12. For p ∈(1, ∞) there is a constant c = c(p) such that
∥∇u∥Lp ≤c∥∂u∥Lp
for all u ∈C∞
c
 C, Cn
.
The main ingredients of the proof are the operator A from the preceding
section and the so-called Calder´on–Zygmund inequality. The proof of the latter is
beyond the scope of this text, but we discuss the setting of that inequality in some
detail.
Recall that (changing notation from g to u)

The Calder´on–Zygmund inequality deals with exactly such convolutions. We de-
note the partial derivatives of K by K1 := ∂xK and K2 = ∂yK.
Theorem III.1.13 (Calder´on–Zygmund Inequality). For p ∈(1, ∞) there is a con-
stant c = c(p) such that, for j ∈{1, 2},
∥∇(Kj ∗u)∥Lp ≤c∥u∥Lp
for all u ∈C∞
c (C, Cn).

Chapter III. Bounds of Higher Order
For a proof, see [McDuﬀ& Salamon 2012, Section B.2].
Exercise III.1.14. The aim of this exercise is to work through the proof of The-
orem III.1.13 for the case p = 2, which is considerably simpler than the general
case. Further simplifying the discussion, we assume that u is real-valued, that is,
u ∈C∞
c (R2). Set v = Kj ∗u for a ﬁxed j ∈{1, 2}. We want to show that
∥∇v∥L2 ≤∥u∥L2
for all u ∈C∞
c (R2).

Beware that v need not have compact support.
(i) Convince yourself that vi = Kj ∗ui for i ∈{1, 2}.
(ii) Verify that Kj(x1, x2) = xj/2π|x|2.
(iii) Use (i) and (ii) to show that there is a constant c = c(u) such that
|v(x)| + |∇v(x)| ≤c

from the divergence theorem of Gauß. Here, ∂v/∂n denotes the directional
derivative in the direction of the outer normal n along ∂BR.
(v) It is known that k := K ∗h is a solution of Poisson’s equation ∆k = h;
see [Evans 2010, Section 2.2.1]. Show that v = K ∗uj, from which we deduce
that ∆v = uj.
(vi) Use the estimate in (iii) to show that the second summand on the right-
hand side of (III.8) converges to zero as R →∞. Deduce from (v) that
the ﬁrst summand on the right-hand side of (III.8) is independent of R for
large R. Conclude that ∇v ∈L2(R2) and, in terms of the L2 inner product
⟨f, g⟩L2 :=
R
R2 fg (and its obvious analogue for vector-valued functions), we
have
∥∇v∥2
L2 = −⟨v, ∆v⟩L2 = −⟨v, uj⟩L2 = ⟨vj, u⟩L2 ≤∥∇v∥L2∥u∥L2.
The claimed estimate (III.7) follows.
♦
Proof of Proposition III.1.12. By point (iv) in Section III.1.3 and (III.6) we have
u = A∂u = ∂K ∗∂u.
The result then follows with the Calder´on–Zygmund inequality.
□

III.1. The a priori estimate
75
III.1.5
The a priori estimate
In this section we want to derive an a priori estimate, as announced in (III.1),
for the (k, p)-norm of a compactly supported map u: BR →R2n in terms of the
(k−1, p)-norm of ∂u, where ∂= 1
2(∂x+J0∂y). The existence of such an estimate is
quite surprising, since the former norm contains all derivatives of u up to order k,
whereas the latter sees only a selection of these derivatives.
First, we need an analogue of the Poincar´e inequality for the Lp-norm.
Exercise III.1.15. Let p ∈(1, ∞). Mimic the proof of Lemma III.1.5 — where
you replace the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality with the H¨older inequality ∥fg∥1 ≤
∥f∥q∥g∥p, with q the dual coeﬃcient to p, that is, 1
p + 1
q = 1 — to show that there
is a constant c = c(p, R) such that for all C1-functions u: C →R2n with compact
support in BR we have
∥u∥Lp ≤c∥∇u∥Lp.
By Note III.1.1 one may argue componentwise as in the proof of Lemma III.1.5.♦
We now formulate the desired estimate.
Proposition III.1.16 (The a priori Estimate). For any given natural number k and
real numbers p > 1 and R > 0 there is a positive constant c = c(k, p, R) such that
∥u∥k,p ≤c ∥∂u∥k−1,p
for all u ∈C∞
c (BR, R2n).
Proof. We may replace the Sobolev norms in the claimed inequality by the re-
spective equivalent norms from Note III.1.3. The statement for k = 1 follows by
combining the Poincar´e inequality from Exercise III.1.15 with Proposition III.1.12.
Now argue by induction on k. Suppose the estimate holds for a given k. Then,
X
|α|≤k+1
∥Dαu∥Lp

It remains to estimate the second summand in terms of the Lp-norm of the deriva-
tives of ∂u up to order k. The crucial point is that the ∂-operator commutes with
derivatives, since J0 is a linear map on R2n.

This completes the inductive step.
□
Remark III.1.17. We wish to reiterate that for the case p = 2 we have presented a
complete proof of Proposition III.1.16, without the Calder´on–Zygmund estimate
as a black box. For the base case k = 1 of the induction, you can use either
Exercise III.1.6 or Exercise III.1.14.
We quote without proof the following Sobolev inequality; good references
are [Adams & Fournier 2003, Theorem 4.12, Part II] or [McDuﬀ& Salamon 2012,
Theorem B.1.11]. First, we deﬁne the relevant condition on the domain in this
inequality.
Deﬁnition III.1.18. A domain G ⊂Rm is called a Lipschitz domain if each point
of its boundary ∂G has a neighbourhood in Rm in which ∂G is the graph of a
Lipschitz continuous function, and G the subgraph.
Exercise III.1.19. Show that the open half-disc B1 ∩{z > 0} ⊂C is a Lipschitz
domain.
♦
In fact, most of the time we apply the following Sobolev inequality (and re-
lated results) to domains with smooth boundary such as discs, where the Lipschitz
condition is certainly satisﬁed.
The condition p > 2 in the Sobolev inequality is tied to the fact that we
are dealing exclusively with 2-dimensional domains. For the requirements on p in
dependence on the dimension, see [Adams & Fournier 2003].
Proposition III.1.20 (Sobolev Inequality). For k ∈N, p > 2 and G ⊂C a bounded
Lipschitz domain, there is a positive constant c = c(k, p, G) such that for all smooth
maps u: G →Rm we have
∥u∥Ck−1(G) ≤c ∥u∥k,p,G.
□
III.1.6
Why do we need Sobolev norms?
There are two places in the proof of the nonsqueezing theorem where we rely on
the theory of Sobolev norms and Sobolev spaces. The ﬁrst one is the bootstrapping
argument in the present chapter, which will give us Ck-bounds on the nonstandard
discs. The second instance will arise in Chapter IV, where we are going to prove
a regularity result for J-holomorphic curves. There, too, we are performing a
bootstrapping argument in order to show that solutions of the nonlinear Cauchy–
Riemann equation (page 90) are smooth maps, even if a priori we assume smaller
degrees of diﬀerentiability.
The novice is usually perplexed and mystiﬁed why one has to go through
the rigmarole of Sobolev theory to arrive at these goals. This section is meant to
provide some sort of answer to such justiﬁable queries.
As regards the bootstrapping argument in the present chapter, the key to
everything that follows is the a priori estimate of Proposition III.1.16. We are

III.1. The a priori estimate
77
going to show by an example how this estimate fails if we replace the Sobolev
norms with Ck-norms.
The bootstrapping argument in Chapter IV is not only concerned with im-
proving the order of the norms involved, but also the degree of diﬀerentiability,
since there we cannot work with C∞-maps from the start, as we shall explain in
Section IV.3.6. The example in the present section will also be pertinent to the
discussion there.
The calculations in the example can best be done in terms of the Wirtinger
derivatives of complex-valued functions. As these are not always treated in a ﬁrst
course on complex variables, we introduce them now.
Lemma III.1.21. Let U ⊂C be an open subset. A function f : U →C is real dif-
ferentiable at z0 ∈U if and only if there are functions A1, A2 : U →C, continuous
at z0, such that
f(z) = f(z0) + A1(z)(z −z0) + A2(z)(z −z0)
for all z ∈U.
In this case we have
A1(z0)
=

2
 fx(z0) −ify(z0)

A2(z0)
=

2
 fx(z0) + ify(z0)

.
Exercise III.1.22.
(a) Prove this lemma, starting from the fact that f is real
diﬀerentiable in z0 = x0 + iy0 if and only if f can be written as
f(z) = f(z0) + ∆1(z)(x −x0) + ∆2(z)(y −y0),
where z = x + iy, with ∆1, ∆2 continuous at z0.
(b) We deﬁne the Wirtinger derivatives
∂f
∂z (z0) = A1(z0),
∂f
∂z (z0) = A2(z0).
We also write fz and fz, respectively, for these derivatives. The second state-
ment in the lemma then translates into
fz = 1
2(fx −ify)
and
fz = 1
2(fx + ify).
In particular, ∂/∂z equals the linear Cauchy–Riemann operator ∂.
(c) Show that f is complex diﬀerentiable in z0 if and only if f is real diﬀerentiable
in z0 and fz(z0) = 0; cf. Exercise I.3.9.
(d) Verify that
∂f
∂z = ∂f
∂z
and
∂f
∂z = ∂f
∂z .

78
Chapter III. Bounds of Higher Order
(e) Show that ∂/∂z and ∂/∂z are complex linear operators that satisfy the Leib-
niz rule.
(f) Formulate and prove the chain rule for the Wirtinger derivatives. Also con-
sider compositions g ◦f where f is real-valued and g a complex-valued func-
tion on a real interval, as well as the real derivative of g ◦f when f is deﬁned
on a real interval.
♦
Part (b) of the next exercise shows that the a priori estimate fails for the
Ck-norms. In fact, as shown in part (a), we may not even be able to write down
the estimate in a meaningful way, since ∂u may be of class Ck−1 without u being
of class Ck. The latter will also be the reason why we need Sobolev spaces in the
bootstrapping argument of Chapter IV.
This example is a reﬁnement of one described by [Sikorav 1994].
Exercise III.1.23. On B1/2 ⊂C, the open disc of radius 1/2 centred at 0, we
consider the following complex-valued function, where log denotes the real natural
logarithm:
f(z) =
(
z2 log log |z|−2
for z ∈B1/2 \ {0},
0
for z = 0.
(a) In this part of the exercise we want to show that f is of class C1, but not C2,
whereas fz is of class C1. (Strictly speaking, we only ask you to show that the
derivatives fzz(z) and fz z(z) at z ̸= 0 extend continuously into z = 0. With
the notion of a ‘weak’ derivative (Deﬁnition IV.2.2) this can be formulated
correctly as saying that the weak derivatives of fz exist and are continuous.
For further details, see [Geiges, Sa˘glam & Zehmisch 2023].)
(i) Prove that fz(0) = 0 by writing down an expression for f as in Lemma
III.1.21. Verify that
fz(z) = 2z log log |z|−2 −
z
log |z|−2
for z ̸= 0
by using the diﬀerentiation rules for the Wirtinger derivatives. Show
that fz is continuous.
(ii) Similarly, show that fz(0) = 0 and
fz(z) = −
z2
z log |z|−2
for z ̸= 0.
This, too, is continuous.
(iii) Conclude that f is of class C1.
(iv) Show that fzz(z) →∞as z →0, so f is not of class C2.
(v) Show that the derivatives fzz(z) and fz z(z) at z ̸= 0 extend continu-
ously into z = 0.

(b) Now consider the sequence of functions fν : B1/2 →C, ν ∈N, deﬁned by
fν(z) =

for z ∈B1/2 \ {0},
0
for z = 0.
(i) Show that fν is of class C1 by computing ∂fν and ∂fν.
(ii) Show that ∥∂fν∥C0 is bounded uniformly in ν, whereas ∥∂fν∥C0 and
hence ∥fν∥C1 goes to inﬁnity as ν →∞.
(iii) Use a cut-oﬀfunction to produce a counterexample to the a priori es-
timate in the Ck-norms, i.e. ﬁnd a sequence of compactly supported
C1-functions uν : B1/2 →C that violates the inequality ∥uν∥C1 ≤

Various Sobolev estimates
In this section we shall assume throughout that G ⊂C is a bounded Lipschitz
domain, p is a real number greater than 2, and k is a natural number, that is,
k ≥1. These assumptions are essential in Lemma III.2.2, where we use the Sobolev
inequality.
Exercise III.2.1. Let α be a double index as in Section II.2.1, and ⟨. , . ⟩the
standard Euclidean inner product on Rm. Prove the Leibniz rule for the scalar
product of two functions u, v ∈C∞(G, Rm):

β+γ=α
cβγ⟨Dβu, Dγv⟩,
where β, γ are likewise double indices, and the cβγ suitable natural numbers. Give
a formula for cβγ.
♦
Lemma III.2.2. There is a constant c = c(k, p, G) such that for any functions
u, v ∈C∞(G, Rm) with ﬁnite (k, p)-norm we have
∥⟨u, v⟩∥k,p ≤c ∥u∥k,p ∥v∥k,p.
Proof. The Sobolev inequality gives

the condition k −|β| ≥1 is used when we apply the Sobolev inequality in the
second line. For |β| = k the same inequality can be proved by exchanging the roles
of u and v. With the Leibniz rule, the lemma follows.
□
Exercise III.2.3. Consider the function u: B1 →R deﬁned by
u(reiθ) =
1
p
r(1 −r)
for r ̸= 0;
the value u(0) may be chosen arbitrarily. Show that u ∈L1, and that its integral
with respect to the area form r dr ∧dθ (i.e. the Lebesgue measure on R2) equals
R
B1 u = π2. Show further that u2 is not in L1. This illustrates that Lemma III.2.2
fails for k = 0 (and p = 1). How does one have to modify the example for larger p?
If you prefer an example where the norms of u, v and the product uv are all
ﬁnite, you may consider the function uε, for ε > 0, deﬁned by
uε(reiθ) =
1
p
r(1 + ε −r)
.
For ε suﬃciently small, the inequality in Lemma III.2.2 (with u = v = uε, k = 0
and p = 1) will be violated.

Lemma III.2.4. There is a real polynomial P = Pk,p,G of degree k with non-
negative coeﬃcients such that for any u ∈C∞(G, Rm) of ﬁnite (k, p)-norm and

With the triangle inequality

we ﬁnd

For the ﬁrst derivatives of f ◦u we observe, with ∂x(f ◦u) = (df ◦u) · ∂xu, that
∥∂x(f ◦u)∥Lp ≤∥f∥C1 ∥∂xu∥Lp,
and similarly for the derivative with respect to the y-coordinate. In total, this
gives us the estimate
∥f ◦u∥1,p ≤const. ∥f∥C1 ∥u∥1,p + 1

which is the statement of the lemma for k = 1.
We now proceed by induction on k, starting from the estimate
∥f ◦u∥k,p ≤∥f ◦u∥1,p + ∥∂x(f ◦u)∥k−1,p + ∥∂y(f ◦u)∥k−1,p.
For the second summand on the right-hand side we have, for k ≥2,

III.3
The Ck-norm of nonstandard discs is bounded
Here is the desired Ck-bound, for each k ∈N, on the nonstandard discs. As noted
at the end of Section II.2.2, this completes the proof of Theorem II.2.7 on the
properness of the evaluation map.

82
Chapter III. Bounds of Higher Order
Proposition III.3.1. For every k ∈N there is a constant c = ck > 0 such that
∥u∥Ck(D) ≤c
for all u ∈Mnst.
Thanks to the Sobolev inequality (Proposition III.1.20), it suﬃces for the
proof of this proposition to establish bounds on the Sobolev (k, p)-norms for some
p > 2 and all k ∈N. The estimates that follow hold under the more general
assumption p ∈(1, ∞); the condition p > 1 is required because of our reliance on
the a priori estimate.
Arguing by contradiction, suppose that Mnst were not bounded in the Sobo-
lev (k, p)-norm for some k. Then we could ﬁnd a sequence (uν)ν∈N in Mnst such
that
∥uν∥k,p,B1 > ν
for all ν ∈N.
As shown in Chapter II, the space Mnst is C1-bounded, and hence by Corol-
lary II.2.10 (a) to the Arzel`a–Ascoli theorem we may assume (by passing to a
subsequence) that
uν −→u ∈C0(D)
as ν →∞.
Thus, we arrive at the desired contradiction if we can prove, by bootstrapping,
the next lemma.
Lemma III.3.2. Let (uν)ν∈N be a C1-bounded sequence in M with uniform limit
u ∈C0(D, R2n). Then for every k ∈N there is a constant c = c(k, p, u, J) > 0
such that
∥uν∥k,p,B1 ≤c
for suﬃciently large ν ∈N.
Wait, you say. Didn’t we appeal to a bootstrapping argument on page 57 to
establish the C1-bound on Mnst in the ﬁrst place? It seems we have been caught
cheating, or trapped in a circular argument. Lest the reader suspect us of boasting
after the manner of M¨unchhausen, let us clarify the logic of our reasoning.
Assuming that Mnst were not C1-bounded, we constructed a C1-bounded
sequence (vν) of holomorphic discs deﬁned on larger and larger domains BRνε.
Thus, starting from a suﬃciently large index ν, we may regard this as a sequence
of holomorphic maps deﬁned on some large closed disc. In the ﬁrst instance, we
apply Lemma III.3.2 to this sequence, with a minor modiﬁcation of the proof, as
we shall explain in Remark III.3.11. As argued on page 57 et seq., this leads to
a contradiction, which establishes the C1-bound on Mnst. Now the lemma also
applies to the sequence (uν) in Mnst.
Exercise III.3.3. Use the compactness of D and Note III.1.3 to prove the conclusion
of Lemma III.3.2 for k = 1.
♦
Proof of Lemma III.3.2. We prove this by induction on k. The case k = 1 is
covered by the preceding exercise, so it remains to perform the inductive step
from k to k + 1.
Let {Uj : j = 0, 1, . . . , N} be a covering of D by open subsets — these will
be speciﬁed later — with the property that Uj ∩∂D = ∅for j ≥1. Furthermore,

III.3. The Ck-norm of nonstandard discs is bounded
83
let {fj : j = 0, 1, . . . , N} be a partition of unity subordinate to this covering, in
the sense that the supports
supp fj := {z ∈D: fj(z) ̸= 0}
of the smooth functions fj : D →[0, 1] satisfy
supp fj ⊂Uj,
j = 0, 1, . . . , N,
and PN
j=0 fj ≡1. Then,
∥uν∥k+1,p,B1 ≤
N
X
j=0
∥fjuν∥k+1,p,Uj,
so it suﬃces to ﬁnd a bound on each summand on the right.
Localisation near the boundary
Recall that the almost complex structure J on R2n coincides with the standard
structure J0 outside a compact subset. The uniform limit u of the sequence (uν)
in M is a continuous map
u: (D, ∂D) −→(R2n, Lt)
for a suitable t ∈Rn−1.
Exercise III.3.4. Use the uniform convergence of (uν) to show that there is a
δ ∈(0, 1
2), depending only on u, such that every uν with ν suﬃciently large maps
U0 := D \ D1−δ
into the region of R2n where J = J0; cf. the proof of Lemma II.1.9.
♦
This means that the component functions of uν|U0 are holomorphic maps
U0 →C. By Schwarz reﬂection in the unit circle (Exercise II.1.7 for the ﬁrst
component, Proposition II.1.4 for the remaining n−1 components), uν|U0 extends
to a holomorphic map ˆuν deﬁned on
U0 ∪(1/U 0) =
n
1 −δ < |z| <

⊂B2.
Extend the function f0, which is supported in U0 and constant equal to 1 near
∂D, to a smooth function (still denoted f0) B2 →[0, 1] supported in the annulus
U0 ∪(1/U 0). We then have the following estimates:
∥f0uν∥k+1,p,U0
≤
∥f0ˆuν∥k+1,p,B2
≤
const. ∥∂(f0ˆuν)∥k,p,B2
by Proposition III.1.16
=
const. ∥∂f0 · ˆuν∥k,p,B2
since ˆuν is holomorphic
≤
const. ∥∂f0∥k,p,B2 ∥uν∥k,p,B1
by Lemma III.2.2;

84
Chapter III. Bounds of Higher Order
for the passage from ∥ˆuν∥k,p,B2 to ∥uν∥k,p,B1 in the last line we appeal to the next
exercise. Also notice that we could equally write ∥f0∥Ck+1 instead of ∥∂f0∥k,p,B2,
since we are only estimating up to constants.
Exercise III.3.5. Let ϕ: G1 →G2 be a diﬀeomorphism of bounded domains
G1, G2 ⊂C that extends smoothly to a neighbourhood of the closure G1. Show
that for every k ∈N and p ≥1 there is a constant c = c(k, p, ϕ) > 0 such that
1
c ∥u∥k,p,G2 ≤∥u ◦ϕ∥k,p,G1 ≤c∥u∥k,p,G2.
♦
By Exercise III.3.4, the bump function f0 depends on the limit u only, so by
the inductive hypothesis we conclude
∥f0uν∥k+1,p,U0 ≤const.
for ν large, with a constant depending only on u (and k, p, J, of course).
Localisation in the interior
Here is the key idea of the argument. In the interior, the uν may not be holomor-
phic (that is, J0-holomorphic), so when we apply the a priori estimate (Proposi-
tion III.1.16) to fjuν, j = 1, . . . , N, we do not lose one derivative of uν. However,
by localisation and an aﬃne transformation we are ‘almost’ in a holomorphic sit-
uation. This means that we cannot quite get rid of the derivative of uν of order
k + 1, but we can make it appear in the estimate with a factor smaller than 1;
see (III.12) below. M¨unchhausen would have been proud of this idea.
Consider a point p ∈R2n in the image u(B1).
Exercise III.3.6. Use the fact that the tangent vectors ∂x1, . . . , ∂xn ∈TpR2n span
a Lagrangian subspace with respect to ω, and the compatibility of J with ω, to
prove that
∂x1, . . . , ∂xn, J(p)∂x1, . . . , J(p)∂xn
is a basis for the vector space TpR2n.
♦
Let Ap be the endomorphism of R2n deﬁned by
Ap∂xj = ∂xj
and
ApJ(p)∂xj = ∂yj,
j = 1, . . . , n.
Then Ap is invertible, and ApJ(p) = J0Ap. Let ϕp be the aﬃne map
z 7−→Ap(z −p)
of R2n. The diﬀerential of ϕp is Ap, so the equation ApJ(p) = J0Ap means that
the diﬀerential
Tpϕp :
 TpR2n, J(p)

−→

is complex linear. In other words, the almost complex structure Jp∗:= (ϕp)∗J
satisﬁes Jp∗(0) = J0.

III.3. The Ck-norm of nonstandard discs is bounded
85
Exercise III.3.7. Verify this last claim. See Section I.3.3 for the deﬁnition of the
push-forward of almost complex structures.
♦
Write ck for the constant in the a priori estimate from Proposition III.1.16
(with R = 1 and some ﬁxed p), where we use the (k, p)-norm from Note III.1.3.
This choice of norm (and corresponding constant in the estimate) is important for
the control of one particular term, as we shall see. We can choose r > 0 so small
that, with Br(p) ⊂R2n denoting the open ball of radius r centred at p,
∥J0 −Jp∗∥C0(ϕp(Br(p))) < 1
ck
,
where we regard J0 −Jp∗as a map from ϕp(Br(p)) to R2n×2n. Hence, by com-
pactness of D1−δ, we ﬁnd a ﬁnite number of points z1, . . . , zN in D1−δ and radii
δ1, . . . , δN ∈(0, δ) such that the balls Uj := Bδj(zj), j = 1, . . . , N, cover D1−δ,
and such that with pj := u(zj) and rj > 0 chosen such that u(Uj) ⊂Brj/2(pj),
the almost complex structure Jj := (ϕpj)∗J satisﬁes
∥J0 −Jj∥C0(ϕpj (Brj (pj))) < 1
ck
,
j = 1, . . . , N.
(III.9)
By the C0-convergence uν →u we have uν(Uj) ⊂Brj(pj) for ν suﬃciently large.
Exercise III.3.8. Show that
uj
ν := ϕpj ◦uν|Uj : Uj −→(R2n, Jj)
is a Jj-holomorphic map. (This is tautological from the deﬁnition of Jj.)
♦
Since the maps ϕpj are aﬃne, and the number N of these maps depends only
on u, we have
∥uj
ν∥k,p,Uj ≤const. (k, p, u, J)
 ∥uν∥k,p,B1 + 1

.
(III.10)
Exercise III.3.9. Verify this by inspecting the proof of Lemma III.2.4, or by a
direct argument.
♦
The inductive hypothesis now yields
∥uj
ν∥k,p,Uj ≤const. (k, p, u, J),
j = 1, . . . , N.
(III.11)
The inverse map ϕpj is likewise aﬃne, so analogous to (III.10) we have
∥fjuν∥k+1,p,Uj ≤const. (k, p, u, J)
 ∥fjuj
ν∥k+1,p,Uj + 1

.
Therefore, in order to complete the inductive step, it suﬃces to prove the bound-
edness of ∥fjuj
ν∥k+1,p,Uj. For ease of notation we set f = fj, v = uj
ν and J = Jj

86
Chapter III. Bounds of Higher Order
(not to be confused with the original J), and we drop Uj from the subscripts to
the norm. We now estimate (with ∂= 1
2(∂x + J0∂y))
∥fv∥k+1,p

by Proposition III.1.16
≤
ck
2 ∥(∂x + J(v)∂y)(fv)∥k,p + ck
2 ∥(J0 −J(v))∂y(fv)∥k,p.
We consider the two summands on the right in turn. The ﬁrst one can be estimated
as follows:
∥(∂x + J(v)∂y)(fv)∥k,p
≤
∥(∂x + J(v)∂y)f · v∥k,p
since v is J-holomorphic by Exercise III.3.8

∥v∥k,p


Pk,p(∥v∥k,p)∥v∥k,p
by Lemma III.2.4
≤
const. (u, k, p, J)
by (III.11).
The crucial point in this estimate is that thanks to the J-holomorphicity of v,
no derivatives of v of order k + 1 arise, which is what makes the inductive step
possible.
Two comments are in order. The J in the last line is actually the old J,
not the Jj. The norms of fj and Jj can be absorbed into this constant since these
functions and almost complex structures depend only on u and J. We have ignored
the factor ck at no peril.
For the second summand, however, the factor ck is vitally important. It
will enter the following estimates via our choices that guarantee condition (III.9).
Indeed, the second term contains order k + 1 derivatives of fv, so it seems we are
doomed. But if these derivatives appear with a factor smaller than 1, we can carry
them back to the left-hand side and still estimate ∥fv∥k+1,p in terms of lower
derivatives.
Recall that we compute with the (k, p)-norm from Note III.1.3. Thus, we
have (with the notation from Section II.2.1)
ck
2 ∥(J0 −J(v))∂y(fv)∥k,p

by the Leibniz rule (Exercise III.2.1). Thanks to (III.9), the ﬁrst summand can be
estimated by 1
2∥fv∥k+1,p.

III.3. The Ck-norm of nonstandard discs is bounded
87
As we have seen in Exercise III.2.3, the Lp-norm does not satisfy a product
estimate. However, the second summand in the last line can be estimated by a
sum of the form
ck
2
X
|β|+|γ|≤k−1
|β|≥1
c′
βγ∥Dβ(J0 −J(v)) · Dγ∂y(fv)∥1,p.
In this sum we have |γ| ≤k −2, so the highest derivative of fv is of order k (one
derivative from ∂y, one from the (1, p)-norm); the highest derivative of v coming
from the factor Dβ(J0 −J(v)) is likewise of order k.
Exercise III.3.10. Use Lemma III.2.2 to show that this last sum can be estimated
by a product of ∥J∥Ck and a polynomial in ∥v∥k,p (of what degree?) with coeﬃ-
cients depending on f (and hence the limit map u).
♦
Putting all this together, with the inductive hypothesis we arrive at the
estimate
∥fjuj
ν∥k+1,p,Uj ≤1
2∥fjuj
ν∥k+1,p,Uj + const. (k, p, u, J),
(III.12)
whence
∥fjuj
ν∥k+1,p,Uj ≤const. (k, p, u, J).
This completes the localisation in the interior, and hence the proof of Lemma
III.3.2.
□
Remark III.3.11. As mentioned on page 82, in the overall argument we ﬁrst apply
Lemma III.3.2 to the sequence (vν) constructed in Section II.2.4. These holomor-
phic discs vν are deﬁned on open discs BRνε with Rν →∞as ν →∞.
Thus, given any R > 0, for ν suﬃciently large we may regard vν as being
deﬁned on the closed disc DR. The sequence (vν) is C1-bounded (see page 57),
and hence has a uniform limit in C0(DR, R2n). The proof of Lemma III.3.2 cannot
be used without modiﬁcation, since the vν are not J0-holomorphic near ∂DR, so
the boundary localisation argument does not apply.
Instead, we argue as follows. Choose some δ > 0 and ν0(δ) suﬃciently large
such that the vν are deﬁned on BR+δ for ν ≥ν0. Cover DR by ﬁnitely many open
sets U1, . . . , UN ⊂BR+δ. Let {fj : j = 1, . . . , N} be a subordinate partition of
unity, in the sense that supp fj ⊂Uj, and PN
j=1 fj ≡1 on DR. Here the Uj are
chosen as in the ‘localisation in the interior’ argument before, and the remainder
of the proof is unchanged.
The next statement is a corollary to the proof of Lemma III.3.2.
Corollary III.3.12. Let (uν)ν∈N be a sequence in M converging to u ∈M with
respect to the (1, p)-norm. Then, uν →u with respect to all (k, p)-norms.

88
Chapter III. Bounds of Higher Order
Proof. We apply the inductive argument in the preceding proof to the sequence
uν −u, which converges to 0 in W 1,p. The bootstrapping argument for the local-
isation near the boundary works as before and shows that f0(uν −u) →0 in all
(k, p)-norms.
For the localisation in the interior we observe that the C0-convergence to
which we appeal after (III.9) is guaranteed by the Sobolev inequality. Further,
when we apply the aﬃne maps ϕpj to both uν and u, the constant term drops out
in the diﬀerence uj
ν −uj, which means that the summand 1 in (III.10) disappears;
cf. Exercise III.2.5. Equation (III.11) then becomes
∥uj
ν −uj∥k,p,Uj ≤const. ∥uν −u∥k,p,B1.
As you use this information in the remainder of the proof of Lemma III.2.4, you
will see that the ﬁnal estimate in that proof becomes
∥fj(uj
ν −uj)∥k+1,p,Uj ≤const. ∥uν −u∥k,p,B1,
which is exactly what we need for the inductive step.

Exercise III.3.13. Verify that the ﬁnal estimate is as claimed.

Chapter IV
Elliptic Regularity
The ancient poetess singeth,
that Hesperus all things bringeth,
Smoothing the wearied mind.
Alfred Lord Tennyson, Leonine Elegiacs
In this chapter we shall describe our moduli space M of holomorphic discs
as the set of smooth solutions of a nonlinear diﬀerential equation, the so-called
nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann equation ∂Ju = 0. In order to show that this space is
a manifold, one needs inﬁnite-dimensional versions both of the implicit function
theorem and Sard’s theorem. The ﬁrst theorem enables us to establish the mani-
fold property of subsets of manifolds that arise as preimages of regular values of
some diﬀerentiable map; the second theorem we use to ﬁnd such regular values.
‘Regularity’ in this sense will be the topic of Chapter V.
The ‘regularity’ in the title of this chapter is of a diﬀerent nature. The prob-
lem we face is that the space of smooth functions we are dealing with is a Fr´echet
space, and in such spaces there is, unfortunately, no implicit function theorem.
There is, however, such a theorem for Banach spaces, so the idea is to work in a
suitable completion of our function space that does carry a Banach space structure.
One might simply try to work with spaces of Ck-functions for some ﬁnite k,
which are Banach, and hope that Ck-solutions of the equation ∂Ju = 0 are actually
smooth. In a course on complex analysis you will have seen this phenomenon of
‘regularity’ for honest holomorphic functions: a C1-solution of the (linear) Cauchy–
Riemann equation ∂u = 0 is automatically of class C∞.
As explained in Section III.1.6, and further in Section IV.3.6 below, this kind
of bootstrapping is bound to fail, in general, and it does fail for the nonlinear
Cauchy–Riemann equation. Instead, one has to work with Sobolev spaces W k,p of
functions with merely Lp-integrable weak derivatives up to order k.
The miracle of elliptic regularity is that in the realm of W k,p-solutions of the

equation ∂Ju = 0, one can indeed bootstrap with respect to k. Functions that are
of class W k,p for all k ∈N (and some p > 2) are then seen to be smooth by the
Sobolev embedding theorem. The term ‘elliptic’ refers to the fact that this kind
of bootstrapping is speciﬁc to elliptic diﬀerential operators, of which the Laplace
operator (to which the ∂-operator is closely linked) is the archetypical example.
But we shall not pursue this general ‘elliptic’ theory.
In Section IV.1 we describe the basic set-up for this approach via the im-
plicit function theorem. We discuss various notions of diﬀerentiability in Banach
spaces and the concept of Banach manifolds. It will be shown that spaces of maps,
even merely continuous ones, between (ﬁnite-dimensional) manifolds are Banach
manifolds.
In Section IV.2 we present some basic material on Sobolev spaces, and we
describe the Sobolev completion of the function space on which we plan to study
the equation ∂Ju = 0. Regularity of solutions to this equation is then the topic of
Section IV.3.
IV.1
The linearisation
Write C for the space of all C∞-maps
u: (D, ∂D) −→(R2n, ∂Z)
that satisfy conditions (M1), (M2) and (M3) given in Notation I.8.10. As in Exer-
cise II.2.11 one argues that C is a closed subset of the real vector space C∞(D, R2n).
The nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann operator ∂J is the continuous map
∂J :
C
−→
C∞(D, R2n)
u
7−→
ux + J(u)uy.
For convenience we have dropped the factor 1/2 present in the classical linear
Cauchy–Riemann operator, where J ≡J0.
The kernel of ∂J is made up of the J-holomorphic maps in C, so our moduli
space M is the solution space of a nonlinear equation,
M = {u ∈C : ∂Ju = 0}.
There are two aspects to the nonlinearity of ∂J: the space C is not a linear subspace
(because of the conditions on u|∂D), and the coeﬃcients of the diﬀerential equation
∂Ju = 0 depend on u.
Given this description of M as the kernel of ∂J, our aim will be to establish
the diﬀerentiability of the operator ∂J, and to give a description of its linearisation.
This will ultimately allow us to equip M with a manifold structure.
Along the way, there are a number of quite formidable technical problems we
need to overcome. The ﬁrst one is that on a space of C∞maps (even a linear one),
there is only a Fr´echet metric, but no norm. So the space C is merely a Fr´echet

IV.1. The linearisation

manifold, for which there is no implicit function theorem that one might apply to
the equation ∂Ju = 0.
IV.1.1
Notions of diﬀerentiability
We brieﬂy recall the most important notions of diﬀerentiability for maps between
Fr´echet or Banach spaces, and we illustrate the failure of the implicit function
theorem for Fr´echet spaces.
The ﬁrst notion of diﬀerentiability is concerned with directional derivatives.
Deﬁnition IV.1.1. Let E, F be Fr´echet or Banach spaces and U ⊂E an open subset.
A map f : U →F is called Gateaux1 diﬀerentiable at u ∈U if for each h ∈E the
directional derivative
∂hf(u) := lim
t→0
f(u + th) −f(u)
t
exists, and h 7→∂hf(u) is a continuous linear2 map. The map f is said to be
diﬀerentiable of class C1 on U if f is Gateaux diﬀerentiable on U, and the map
U
−→
L(E, F),
u
7−→

h 7→∂hf(u)
	
is continuous; here L(E, F) denotes the space of continuous3 linear maps E →F.
Remark IV.1.2. When E, F are Banach spaces, the topology on L(E, F) is induced
by the operator norm. In particular, this space of linear maps is again a Banach
space. In the Fr´echet case, L(E, F) carries the bounded-open topology, i.e. the
topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets.
In the Banach setting, higher orders of continuous diﬀerentiability can be
deﬁned analogously, thanks to L(E, F) being a Banach space.
In general, L(E, F) is not Fr´echet when E and F are. Therefore, when one
wants to deﬁne higher orders of continuous diﬀerentiability of maps between
Fr´echet spaces, one uses the weaker notion we mention below right before Ex-
ercise IV.1.6, which can be iterated for higher derivatives.
As you know from elementary analysis in ﬁnite dimensions, a Gateaux dif-
ferentiable map (i.e. a map whose partial derivatives exist) that is not of class C1
need not even be continuous.
The following example, illustrating the failure of the implicit function theo-
rem in Fr´echet spaces, goes back to [Eells 1966].
1In the birth roll of Vitry-le-Fran¸cois for the year 1889, and on papers published during his
lifetime — cut short by his death in combat in October 1914 —, the name of Ren´e Gateaux
is written without an accent circonﬂexe on the letter ‘a’. In many posthumous publications his
name appears as ‘Gˆateaux’.
2Beware that some authors do not insist on the linearity of this map.
3Equivalently, this is the space of bounded linear maps. For more on linear operators and the
notions bounded/continuous, see Section V.1.1.

Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
Exercise IV.1.3. On the space C0(R) of continuous functions R →R we have a
sequence of seminorms | . |k, k ∈N0, deﬁned by
|u|k := max

|u(x)|: x ∈[−k, k]
	
.
The corresponding Fr´echet metric deﬁnes the topology of uniform convergence on
compact sets (or compact-open topology), and we write E for the space C0(R)
with this topology.
Show that the map f : E →E, u 7→exp(u), is of class C1, and the map h 7→
∂hf(u) is invertible at each u ∈E. Show further that every neighbourhood of the
constant function 1 = exp(0) in E contains functions that assume negative values.
This implies that no neighbourhood of 1 is the image under f of a neighbourhood
of 0.
♦
There is, however, an implicit function theorem for Banach manifolds. In
order to have a Banach manifold to work with — where the transition maps are
diﬀerentiable, by a rather unfortunate nomenclature, in the sense of Fr´echet —
we shall pass to a completion of C in a suitable Sobolev space, where we can still
make sense of the equation ∂Ju = 0. The remaining steps are then to prove that
- the solutions of the equation ∂Ju = 0 are actually of class C∞thanks to the
miracle of elliptic regularity (this is the content of the present chapter);
- for an apt choice of almost complex structure J one has the required transver-
sality to make the solution space a manifold (this point will be addressed in
Chapter V).
The second diﬀerentiability notion for maps between Banach spaces is the
usual ‘total’ diﬀerentiability as in ﬁnite-dimensional analysis.
Deﬁnition IV.1.4. Let E, F be Banach spaces and U ⊂E an open subset. A map
f : U →F is called Fr´echet diﬀerentiable at u ∈U if there exists a continuous
linear map Tuf : E →F such that
lim
h→0
f(u + h) −f(u) −Tuf(h)
∥h∥E
= 0.
Fr´echet diﬀerentiability obviously implies continuity. Also, Fr´echet diﬀeren-
tiability implies Gateaux diﬀerentiability, and then ∂hf(u) = Tuf(h), but not
conversely. In ﬁnite-dimensional analysis, continuity of the partial derivatives im-
plies total diﬀerentiability. This remains true for Banach spaces, if continuity of
the partial or directional derivatives is interpreted as in Deﬁnition IV.1.1.
Proposition IV.1.5. Let E, F be Banach spaces and U ⊂E an open subset. If
f : U →F is diﬀerentiable of class C1 in the sense of Deﬁnition IV.1.1, then f is
Fr´echet diﬀerentiable.

IV.1. The linearisation
93
The proof of this proposition goes like that in ﬁnite dimensions, once one
has established an analogue of the mean value theorem, for which one needs the
Hahn–Banach theorem. For details, see [Werner 2011, Satz III.5.4], or any other
good text on functional analysis.
In ﬁnite dimensions, continuity of the map (u, h) 7→∂hf(u) is equivalent to
the continuity of u 7→{h 7→∂hf(u)}. In inﬁnite dimensions this is not true, and
the following example illustrates that the ﬁrst (and weaker) notion of continuity
is not suﬃcient to guarantee Fr´echet diﬀerentiability. This example, and some
erroneous claims about it that have slipped into the literature, are discussed at
length in [Gieraltowska-Kedzierska & Van Vleck 1992].
Exercise IV.1.6. We consider the Banach spaces E = L1([0, π]) and F = R, and
the map f : E →F deﬁned by f(u) =
R π
0 sin u(x) dx.
(a) Show that f is Gateaux diﬀerentiable with derivative
∂hf(u) =
Z π
0
h(x) cos u(x) dx.
(b) Observe that under the usual identiﬁcation of the dual space (L1)∗with L∞,
the linear map h 7→∂hf(u) corresponds to cos u ∈L∞. Use this, or a direct
argument, to show that the map u 7→{h 7→∂hf(u)} is not continuous.
(c) Show that the map (u, h) 7→∂hf(u) is continuous.
Hint: Consider sequences (uν), (hν) in L1 with uν →u∞and hν →h∞.
Write
hν cos uν −h∞cos u∞= (hν −h∞) cos uν + h∞(cos uν −cos u∞),
and use Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem to control the integral
of the second summand. Beware that one cannot apply this theorem directly,
since cos uν −cos u∞may not be pointwise convergent almost everywhere.
However, if |h∞(cos uν −cos u∞)| did not converge to 0 in L1, one could pick
a subsequence with integrals bounded from below by some ε > 0, and one
could pick a subsequence of that subsequence that converges pointwise a.e.
to the zero function. Then, Lebesgue’s theorem leads to a contradiction.
(d) If f were Fr´echet diﬀerentiable at u = 0, we would have T0f(h) = ∂hf(0) =
R π
0 h. Show that f is not Fr´echet diﬀerentiable at u = 0 by taking hν —
in the deﬁning equation for Fr´echet diﬀerentiability — as the characteristic
function of the interval [0, 1/ν], ν ∈N.
(e) Show that the restriction of f to the subset L2([0, π]) of L1([0, π]) is diﬀer-
entiable of class C1 and hence Fr´echet diﬀerentiable.

IV.1.2
The linearisation of Ck
We now consider the spaces Ck, k ∈N0, which are deﬁned just like the space C at
the beginning of this chapter, except that we do not require the maps u to be of
class C∞, but merely of class Ck. We want to show that these spaces are Banach
manifolds, and we describe the tangent space at a point of Ck. In fact, we proceed
the other way round: we shall ﬁrst introduce a natural concept of ‘tangent space’
and build the manifold structure from there.
In order to emphasise that the diﬀerentiability of the coordinate changes does
not hinge on the diﬀerentiability properties of the maps u making up the space,
we formulate everything for the space C0, but what we say in this and the next
section holds for any Ck.
By the boundary condition (M1), for any given t ∈Rn−1 we may deﬁne the
subset C0
t ⊂C0 as the set of maps of level t, that is, those u ∈C0 with u(∂D) ⊂Lt.
The tangent space TuC0
t at a point u ∈C0
t is made up of the vector ﬁelds along
u such that an inﬁnitesimal shift in the direction of this vector ﬁeld will preserve
the boundary conditions (M1) and (M3). More formally:
Deﬁnition IV.1.7. The tangent space TuC0
t at u = (u1, . . . , un) ∈C0
t (written in
complex components) is the real vector space of all ξ = (ξ1, . . . , ξn) ∈C0(D, R2n)
such that
(T0)
ξ(z) ∈Tu(z)R2n for all z ∈D.
(T1)
ξ(z) ∈Tu(z)Lt for all z ∈∂D, that is, ξ1(z) is a real multiple of iu1(z),
and ξ2(z), . . . , ξn(z) are real.
(T2)
ξ1(ik) = 0 for k ∈{0, 1, 2}.
These tangent spaces are Banach spaces with respect to the supremum norm.
Our aim will be to equip ﬁrst C0
t and then the full space C0 with the structure of a
Banach manifold, that is, a topological space locally modelled on a Banach space,
just like a (traditional) manifold is modelled on a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space.
The local charts will come from an exponential map that we deﬁne in analogy
with the usual exponential map in Riemannian geometry.
Choose a Riemannian metric g1 on R2 = C with g1 = dr2 + dθ2 on an
annulus around ∂D in polar coordinates z = reiθ, and g1 Euclidean outside a
compact subset of R2. Let gst be the standard metric Pn
i=2(dx2
i + dy2
i ) on R2n−2,
and set g = g1 ⊕gst on R2 ⊕R2n−2.
Exercise IV.1.8. Convince yourself that the Riemannian manifold (R2n, g) is geo-
desically complete (i.e. geodesics exist for all times), and the cylinders Lt are
totally geodesic submanifolds (i.e. geodesics in (R2n, g) starting tangentially to Lt
stay in this cylinder).
♦
Write expq : TqR2n →R2n for the exponential map with respect to the
metric g at the point q ∈R2n, that is, expq(v) := γv(1), where γv is the unique
geodesic determined by the initial conditions γv(0) = q and ˙γv(0) = v ∈TqR2n.

IV.1. The linearisation

Deﬁnition IV.1.9. The exponential map on the space C0
t at the point u ∈C0
t is the
map
TuC0

7−→
expu(ξ)
deﬁned by
 expu(ξ)

(z) := expu(z)
 ξ(z)

,
z ∈D.
Exercise IV.1.10. Verify that for ξ ∈TuC0
t , the map expu(ξ) does indeed belong to
the space C0
t . Condition (M1) holds thanks to Exercise IV.1.8, but you also need
to check (M2) and (M3).
♦
To deﬁne charts on the full space C0, containing all levels C0
t , we use the
exponential map on a ﬁxed level t0, and then compose it with the linear shift on
Cn = C ⊕Cn−1 in the imaginary direction of Cn−1. Write ϕt, t ∈Rn−1, for the
shift (w, x + iy) 7→(w, x + i(y + t)). Then deﬁne charts of C0 by
TuC0
t0 ⊕Rn−1
−→
C0
(ξ, t)
7−→
ϕt ◦expu(ξ).
(IV.1)
Observe that the metric g on R2n = Cn is invariant under the map ϕt. Since
g = g1 ⊕gst is a product metric on R2 ⊕R2n−2, and on the R2n−2-factor the
exponential map is simply linear translation, it follows that
ϕt ◦expu(ξ) = expu
 ξ + (0, it)

.
For u of level t0, we can identify TuC0
t0 ⊕Rn−1 with the tangent space TuC0 via
(ξ, t) 7→ξ + (0, it). So the charts of C0 are really deﬁned by an exponential map
on tangent spaces, just like the charts on C0
t .
The boundary conditions (M1), (M2) and (M3) are irrelevant for the discus-
sion of the manifold structure on C0, so we formulate the main result in a slightly
more general setting.
IV.1.3
Spaces of continuous maps are smooth Banach manifolds
For concreteness we consider the space C0(D, M) of continuous maps D →M,
where M can be any manifold (without boundary). In principle, we could replace
D by any compact manifold, with or without boundary.
Remark IV.1.11. As mentioned in the preface, our presentation follows unpub-
lished course notes by Kai Cieliebak. Another detailed and rigorous proof of the
statement in the section heading can be found in [Wittmann 2019].
On M we pick a Riemannian metric. This gives rise to a metric dM in
the usual sense by deﬁning dM(p, q) as the inﬁmum over the lengths of smooth
paths between p, q ∈M. A metric on C0(D, M) is then given by d(u, v) :=
maxz∈D dM(u(z), v(z)).

96
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
The Riemannian metric on M also gives rise to an exponential map
Exp:
D
−→
M × M
v
7−→
 π(v), γv(1)

,
where D is a suﬃciently small open neighbourhood of the zero section of the
tangent bundle π: TM →M such that the geodesics γv exist until time 1. For
the manifold structure on C0(D, M) we shall have to work in any case with a small
neighbourhood of the zero section of TM, so there is no advantage in assuming
the Riemannian metric to be complete.
Observe that Exp maps the zero section of TM diﬀeomorphically onto the
diagonal in M × M; under the natural identiﬁcation of the zero section with M,
this map is given by p 7→(p, p).
Lemma IV.1.12. For D suﬃciently small, Exp |D is a diﬀeomorphism onto its
image. One may choose D such that Exp(D) is invariant under the involution
τ : (p, q) 7→(q, p) of M × M.
Proof. Write 0p ∈TpM for the zero tangent vector at p ∈M. The tangent space
T0p(TM) decomposes as a direct sum
T0p(TM) = T hor ⊕T vert
of the horizontal tangent space
T hor := Tp(zero section)
and the vertical tangent space
T vert := T0p(TpM),
both of which can be canonically identiﬁed with TpM. Consider curves in TM of
the form t 7→0β(t), with β(0) = p, and t 7→tv, with v ∈TpM. Under Exp these
curves map to t 7→
 β(t), β(t)

and t 7→
 p, γtv(1)

=
 p, γv(t)

, respectively, the
latter thanks to geodesics being of constant speed. Thus, the diﬀerential
T0p Exp: T hor ⊕T vert −→TpM ⊕TpM,
with respect to the mentioned canonical identiﬁcation, is given by
T0p Exp =
id
0
id
id

,
where id denotes the identity on TpM. So the diﬀerential of Exp is invertible along
the zero section, and the implicit function theorem yields the ﬁrst statement of
the lemma.
If we replace a given D by
Exp−1 Exp(D) ∩τ(Exp(D))

,
the invariance condition will be satisﬁed.
□

IV.1. The linearisation
97
For a careful discussion of the manifold charts of C0(D, M) and the diﬀer-
entiability of the coordinate changes it is opportune to deﬁne the tangent space a
little more formally than in Deﬁnition IV.1.7.
The tangent space
Given u ∈C0(D, M), we consider the pull-back bundle
u∗TM =

(z, v) ∈D × TM : u(z) = π(v)
	
.
This ﬁts into the following commutative diagram:
u∗TM
˜u - TM
D
u∗π
?
u - M,
π
?
where u∗π(z, v) = z and ˜u(z, v) = v.
Deﬁnition IV.1.13. The tangent space
Tu := Tu
 C0(D, M)

of C0(D, M) at u is the space Γ(u∗TM) of continuous sections of u∗TM.
Thus, an element ˜ξ ∈Tu is a continuous map of the form z 7→˜ξ(z) =
(z, ξ(z)) with ξ(z) ∈Tu(z)M, which means that Deﬁnitions IV.1.7 and IV.1.13 are
essentially equivalent. The tangent space Tu becomes a Banach space with the
norm
∥˜ξ∥:= max
z∈D |ξ(z)|,
where |ξ(z)| denotes the norm of ξ(z) ∈Tu(z)M with respect to the Riemannian
metric on M.
The manifold charts
The set Du := Γ(u∗D) ⊂Tu is an open neighbourhood of 0 ∈Tu, that is, of the
zero section z 7→(z, 0u(z)) in u∗TM. As before, except for the formal distinction
between ˜ξ and ξ, we deﬁne the exponential map expu on Du by
 expu(˜ξ)

(z) := expu(z)
 ξ(z)

,
z ∈D.
This map is a homeomorphism onto its image
Eu := expu(Du) =

v ∈C0(D, M):
 u(z), v(z)

∈Exp(D) for all z ∈D
	
.

98
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
Notice that u is the image of the zero section under expu, and Eu is an open
neighbourhood of u in C0(D, M). Moreover, v ∈Eu holds if and only if u ∈Ev,
thanks to the τ-invariance of Exp(D).
Remark IV.1.14. These local parametrisations
Tu ⊃Du
expu
−−−−−→Eu ⊂C0(D, M)
are consistent with the interpretation of Tu as the tangent space of C0(D, M) at u,
since
T0 expu(˜ξ)(z)
=
d
ds|s=0 expu(s˜ξ)(z)
=
d
ds|s=0 expu(z)(sξ(z))
=
ξ(z),
where we have used that T0 expu(z) equals the identity map on Tu(z)M.
Coordinate changes are diﬀerentiable
We are now ready to show that the atlas

(Eu, exp−1
u ): u ∈C0(D, M)
	
gives C0(D, M) a smooth Banach manifold structure. For v ∈Eu, the intersection
Eu ∩Ev is an open neighbourhood of both u and v.
Proposition IV.1.15. The coordinate change
huv := exp−1
v
◦expu : exp−1
u (Eu ∩Ev) −→exp−1
v (Eu ∩Ev)
is inﬁnitely often Fr´echet diﬀerentiable.
Proof. We ﬁrst want to interpret the domain of deﬁnition exp−1
u (Eu∩Ev) as a space
of sections. We shall then ﬁnd that the Fr´echet diﬀerential only ‘sees’ the ﬁbrewise
direction, so the mere continuity of u and v does not obstruct diﬀerentiability.
Regarding the ﬁrst issue, we have
exp−1
u (Eu ∩Ev)
=
˜ξ ∈Du : expu(˜ξ) ∈Ev
	
=
˜ξ ∈Γ(u∗D):
 v(z), expu(z) ξ(z)

∈Exp(D) for all z ∈D
	
=
Γ(O)
with
O :=

(z, v) ∈u∗D:
 v(z), expu(z)(v)

∈Exp(D)
	
.
Observe that O is an open neighbourhood of the zero section {(z, 0u(z)): z ∈D}
in u∗TM.

IV.1. The linearisation
99
Next, for ˜ξ ∈Γ(O) the image huv(˜ξ) ∈Tv is given by
 huv(˜ξ)

(z) =
 z, exp−1
v(z) ◦expu(z) ξ(z)

,
so we can write huv(˜ξ) = Φuv ◦˜ξ, where Φuv is the ﬁbre-preserving map
Φuv :
O
−→
v∗TM
(z, v)
7−→
 z, exp−1
v(z) ◦expu(z)(v)

.
We introduce the notation Φuv(z, v) =
 z, φuv(z, v)

. Then, writing dﬁb for the
derivative with respect to the ﬁbre coordinate v, we deﬁne the linear map
d˜ξhuv : Tu −→Tv
by
d˜ξhuv(˜η)(z) :=
 z, dﬁb
˜ξ(z)φuv(η(z))

,
with ˜η ∈Tu written as ˜η(z) = (z, η(z)).
Exercise IV.1.16. Verify that d˜ξhuv is the Fr´echet derivative of huv. It may help
ﬁrst to consider the Gateaux derivative.
♦
The ﬁbre derivative dﬁbΦuv is the ﬁbre-preserving map
dﬁbΦuv :
O
−→
Hom(u∗TM, v∗TM)
(z, v)
7−→
 z,

Tu(z)M ∋w 7→dﬁb
(z,v)φuv(w) ∈Tv(z)M
	
,
and we may then write the derivative of huv as
d˜ξhuv = dﬁbΦuv ◦˜ξ.
Now we can iterate the argument to see that all higher derivatives dkhuv exist,
and at the point ˜ξ are given by the composition of the kth ﬁbre derivative of Φuv
with ˜ξ.
□
IV.1.4
The linearisation of ∂J
We now want to establish the diﬀerentiability of the nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann
operator ∂J : Ck →Ck−1(D, R2n), k ≥1. To this end, we ﬁrst compute the lin-
earisation Du of this operator at u ∈Ck. In Section IV.2 (speciﬁcally, Proposi-
tion IV.2.29) we then show that Du is a continuous linear operator, and hence
constitutes the Gateaux derivative. Furthermore, we show this Gateaux derivative
to be continuous, and thus prove Fr´echet diﬀerentiability.
Remark IV.1.17. For reasons that we shall detail in Section IV.3.6, ultimately
we have to replace Ck by an appropriate Sobolev space of maps. This Sobolev
completion will be introduced in the next section, and the Fr´echet diﬀerentiability
of ∂J will be established in that setting.

100
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
Recall the charts for Ck deﬁned in (IV.1). Using such a chart at the point
u0 ∈Ck
t0, the diﬀerentiable curve
s 7−→us := ϕst ◦expu0(sξ) ∈Ck,
s ∈(−ε, ε),
is tangent to (ξ, t) ∈Tu0Ck. The linearisation Du0 of ∂J is the Gateaux derivative
of the composition of ∂J with this chart, hence
Du0(ξ, t)
=
d
ds|s=0
 ∂xus + J(us)∂yus

=
∂xξ + J(u0)∂yξ + DJ(u0)(ξ)∂yu0 + DJ(u0)(t)∂yu0.
Here, DJ(u0)(ξ) is a map on D taking values in the linear space R2n×2n of real
(2n × 2n)-matrices, sending z ∈D to the derivative of J : R2n →R2n×2n at u0(z)
in the direction of ξ(z); similarly for DJ(u0)(t).
Deﬁne
Dt0
u0(ξ) := ∂xξ + J(u0)∂yξ + DJ(u0)(ξ)∂yu0
(IV.2)
and
Ku0(t) := DJ(u0)(t)∂yu0.
(IV.3)
In this notation, we have a splitting
Du0 = Dt0
u0 ⊕Ku0
of the linearisation Du0 — corresponding to the splitting
Tu0Ck = Tu0Ck
t0 ⊕Tt0Rn−1
of tangent spaces — into a linear operator of ﬁrst order on a ﬁxed level Ck
t0, and
an operator of order zero.
Remark IV.1.18. The diﬀerential DJ is continuous and hence vanishes on the
closure of the set where J = J0, in particular, outside the open set Φ(Br); see
Deﬁnition II.1.8 for notation. This implies that Du = ∂for all ﬂat discs u. Here
we also drop the factor 1/2 from the deﬁnition of the linear Cauchy–Riemann
operator, that is, we now write ∂= ∂x + i∂y.
IV.2
The Sobolev completion
The lack of an implicit function theorem for Fr´echet spaces forces us to look at
the equation ∂Ju = 0 on a suitable Banach completion of the Fr´echet space of
smooth maps. For the reasons given in Section III.1.6 (and Section IV.3.6 below),
this requires the introduction of Sobolev spaces.
We begin with the deﬁnition of Sobolev spaces for arbitrary 2-dimensional
domains G ⊂C. In fact, until the formulation of the Sobolev inequalities, the
dimension of G does not really matter. A number of key results hold for bounded
Lipschitz domains only, which is what we shall always be dealing with in the
applications.

IV.2. The Sobolev completion
101
Remark IV.2.1. We formulate the deﬁnition of Sobolev (k, p)-spaces for k ∈N and
p ∈[1, ∞), and make these assumptions on k and p throughout our discussion.
The deﬁnition also makes sense for k = 0 (Lp-spaces) or p = ∞, but several of the
basic results we rely on fail for k = 0 (e.g. the Banach algebra property) or p = ∞
(e.g. Theorem IV.2.7).
Whenever we rely on the Calder´on–Zygmund inequality (Theorem III.1.13)
or the a priori estimate derived from it (Proposition III.1.16 and, in its version
for Sobolev spaces, Proposition IV.2.24), we need to assume p > 1.
Whenever we appeal to the Sobolev embedding theorem (for 2-dimensional
domains), we have to impose the condition p > 2. Most importantly, this is the
case for the Banach algebra property of W k,p (Proposition IV.2.17), which is
based on Lemma III.2.2 and the Leibniz rule (Proposition IV.2.16), both of which
require p > 2. The Sobolev embedding theorem also enters the proof of the Peter
Paul inequality (Proposition IV.3.17).
The standard monograph on Sobolev spaces is [Adams & Fournier 2003].
Other good references are [Evans 2010, Chapter 5] and [Lieb & Loss 2001]; the
latter also contains all the necessary background on measure and integration the-
ory.
IV.2.1
The deﬁnition of Sobolev spaces
Write L1
loc(G) for the space of measurable functions that are integrable over any
compact subset of G. For the time being, we consider real-valued functions, but ev-
erything we say extends to complex- or vector-valued functions. Recall the notation
Dα for derivatives from Section II.2.1, where α is a double index (or multi-index
for functions on higher-dimensional domains). Recall that by C∞
c (G) we denote
the space of smooth functions with compact support in G. This is the so-called
space of test functions for the following deﬁnition of weak derivatives.
Deﬁnition IV.2.2. Let u ∈L1
loc(G) and a double index α be given. If there is a
function vα ∈L1
loc(G) such that
Z
G
u · Dαϕ = (−1)|α|
Z
G
vα · ϕ
for all ϕ ∈C∞
c (G),
then vα is the weak α-derivative of u.
Remark IV.2.3. The terminology ‘the’ weak derivative is justiﬁed by the fact that
any two such derivatives diﬀer only on a set of measure zero. This follows from the
fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations for L1-functions; see [Alt 2012,
2.22], for instance.
If u has continuous partial derivatives of the required order, then — as seen
using integration by parts — the actual derivative Dαu coincides with the weak
derivative vα. We therefore do not create any confusion by writing, in the general
case, the weak derivative as Dαu := vα.

(a) Compute the weak derivative of the function R ∋t 7→|t|.
(b) Show that the function u: R →R deﬁned by

♦
We can now introduce the Sobolev spaces. There are two ways of doing so,
which turn out to be equivalent. For point (b) of the next deﬁnition, observe
that the inclusion Lp(G) ⊂L1
loc(G) is a consequence of the H¨older inequality; cf.
[Ambrosio, Da Prato & Mennucci 2011, Remark 3.10].
Deﬁnition IV.2.5. Let k ∈N and p ∈[1, ∞).
(a) The space Hk,p(G) is the completion of

u ∈Ck(G): ∥u∥k,p < ∞
	
with respect to the Sobolev norm ∥. ∥k,p; see Deﬁnition III.1.2.
(b) The space W k,p(G) is the space of those u ∈Lp(G) ⊂L1
loc(G) for which the
weak derivatives Dαu of order |α| ≤k exist and satisfy Dαu ∈Lp(G).
Notice that the elements of W k,p(G) are equivalence classes of functions
deﬁned and equal up to sets of measure zero.
Exercise IV.2.6. For s ∈R we consider the function z 7→|z|s on the interval
(−1, 1) ⊂R or on the open unit ball B ⊂C. For which s is this function an
element of W 1,p (−1, 1)

or W 1,p(B), respectively (with p ≥1 given)? Observe
the role played by the dimension of the domain.
♦
Theorem IV.2.7 (Meyers and Serrin). Hk,p(G) = W k,p(G).
□
This can be read as saying that any function in W k,p(G) can be approximated
in the (k, p)-norm by Ck-functions. For a proof of this theorem, see Theorem 3.17
in [Adams & Fournier 2003]. From now on, we exclusively use the notation W k,p.
One way of interpreting this result is that a function is weakly diﬀerentiable
if and only if it can be approximated (in the relevant norm) by smooth functions,
and the weak derivatives then are the limits of the actual derivatives of the smooth
approximation. This will be the key to establishing diﬀerentiation rules for weakly
diﬀerentiable functions in Section IV.2.3.
Remark IV.2.8. For Lp-spaces, something stronger is true: the space C∞
c (G) of
compactly supported smooth functions is dense (with respect to the Lp-norm) in
Lp(G); see Theorem 2.16 and Lemma 2.19 in [Lieb & Loss 2001].
If G is bounded and Lipschitz, the approximation statement of Theorem
IV.2.7 can be strengthened; see Theorem 3.22 in [Adams & Fournier 2003] or
Proposition B.1.4 in [McDuﬀ& Salamon 2012]. First we need to introduce some
notation.

IV.2. The Sobolev completion
103
Notation IV.2.9. For ℓ∈N0, let Cℓ(G) denote the vector space of functions u ∈
Cℓ(G) for which Dα is bounded and uniformly continuous on G for 0 ≤|α| ≤ℓ.
This implies that all these derivatives have a unique continuous extension to G.
We set C∞(G) = ∩∞
ℓ=0Cℓ(G).
Beware that this notational convention leads to ambiguities for unbounded
domains, e.g. Cℓ(Rm) ̸= Cℓ(Rm).
By a result of [Seeley 1964] mentioned earlier in Remark I.3.7, for a bounded
domain G ⊂Rm with smooth boundary, the space C∞(G) can equivalently be
characterised as the space of functions G →R that equal the restriction to G of
some smooth function deﬁned in a neighbourhood of G ⊂Rm.
Theorem IV.2.10. If G is a bounded Lipschitz domain, then C∞(G) is dense in
W k,p(G).
□
We also record the following result [Adams & Fournier 2003, Theorem 3.6].
Recall that a metric space is called separable if it contains a countable dense
subset.
Theorem IV.2.11. Let G ⊂Rm be a bounded domain and p ∈[1, ∞). Then the
Sobolev space W k,p(G) with the Sobolev (k, p)-norm is a separable Banach space.
The same is true for Lp(G) with the Lp-norm.
□
IV.2.2
The Sobolev embedding theorem
When we speak of an embedding W k,p(G) →Cℓ(G), what we mean is that each
element in W k,p(G) has a (unique) representative u ∈Cℓ(G), and
∥u∥Cℓ(G) ≤c∥u∥k,p,G,
(IV.4)
with a constant c not depending on u, which means that the inclusion map
W k,p(G) →Cℓ(G), [u] 7→u, is a bounded (or continuous) linear operator between
Banach spaces. Notice that (IV.4) is a Sobolev inequality as in Proposition III.1.20,
but with weaker diﬀerentiability assumptions on u.
The following Sobolev embedding theorem is a conﬂation of Theorem 4.12,
Part II in [Adams & Fournier 2003] and, for the compactness statement, the Rel-
lich–Kondrachov theorem [Adams & Fournier 2003, Theorem 6.3, Part III]. Recall
that a compact linear operator is one where the image of any bounded sequence
has a convergent subsequence; in particular, a compact operator is bounded.
Beware that the condition p > 2 is tied up with G being a 2-dimensional
domain and the relative degree of diﬀerentiability in the Sobolev space vs. the
space of continuously diﬀerentiable functions under consideration.
Theorem IV.2.12. If G ⊂C is a bounded Lipschitz domain, k ∈N, and p > 2,
there is a compact (and hence continuous) embedding W k,p(G) →Ck−1(G).
□

104
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
The inequality corresponding to this embedding theorem is precisely the
Sobolev inequality from Proposition III.1.20. In other words, the embedding the-
orem says that this inequality continues to hold with the smoothness assumption
on u weakened to u ∈W k,p(G).
Notation IV.2.13. Whenever we have an embedding W k,p(G) →C0(G), that is,
a unique continuous representative G →R for each class in W k,p(G), we allow
ourselves to write W k,p(G), especially in the case G = D.
There are other inequalities in Chapter III that extend to functions of class
W k,p. In order to show how the proofs carry over to this more general setting, we
need a preparation regarding rules of diﬀerentiation in Sobolev spaces.
IV.2.3
Rules of diﬀerentiation in Sobolev spaces
We begin with some straightforward rules.
Proposition IV.2.14. W k,p(G) is a real vector space, and the weak diﬀerential Dα
is linear.
For any u ∈W k,p(G) and any double indices α, β with |α|+|β| ≤k, we have
Dβ(Dαu) = Dα+βu. Implicitly, this is saying that Dαu ∈W k−|α|,p(G). Also, it
implies a general ‘Schwarz lemma’: Dβ(Dαu) = Dα(Dβu).
Exercise IV.2.15. Prove this proposition.
♦
Next, we establish the Leibniz rule. We formulate this product rule in the
setting most relevant to the application we have in mind, rather than in its most
general form.
Proposition IV.2.16. Let G ⊂C be a bounded Lipschitz domain, p > 2, and
u, v ∈W 1,p(G). Then, uv ∈W 1,p(G), and for α = (1, 0) or (0, 1) the weak
derivative Dα satisﬁes the Leibniz rule
Dα(uv) = (Dαu)v + u Dαv.
Proof. By the Sobolev embedding theorem, we have u, v ∈C0(G). This implies
uv ∈Lp(G).
By Theorem IV.2.10, we can ﬁnd sequences (uν), (vν) in C∞(G) with uν →u
and vν →v in W 1,p(G). This implies Dαuν →Dαu and Dαvν →Dαv in Lp(G).
Using integration by parts and the Leibniz rule for smooth functions we ﬁnd,
for any test function ϕ ∈C∞
c (G),
Z
G
uνvν Dαϕ = −
Z
G
 (Dαuν)vν + uν Dαvν

ϕ.
(IV.5)
We claim that in the limit ν →∞this formula becomes
Z
G
uv Dαϕ = −
Z
G
 (Dαu)v + u Dαv

ϕ.
(IV.6)

IV.2. The Sobolev completion
105
From this claim the proposition follows, since the function (Dαu)v + u Dαv is in
Lp(G).
By the Sobolev inequality ∥uν −u∥C0(G) ≤c∥uν −u∥1,p,G, we have uniform
convergence uν →u ∈C0(G), and likewise for vν →v. This implies that the
left-hand side of (IV.5) converges to that of (IV.6) as ν →∞.
Regarding the right-hand side, we start with the observation that Lp(G) ⊂
L1(G) (by the H¨older inequality), since G is bounded. We then have the estimate
∥(Dαuν)vνϕ −(Dαu)vϕ∥L1
≤
∥Dαuν −Dαu∥L1 · ∥vν∥C0 · ∥ϕ∥C0
+ ∥Dαu∥L1 · ∥vν −v∥C0 · ∥ϕ∥C0
→
0,
and a similar one for the second summand. This proves the claim, and hence the
proposition.
□
With the Leibniz rule at our disposal, Lemma III.2.2 now carries over to
W k,p-functions.
Proposition IV.2.17. For G ⊂C a bounded Lipschitz domain, k ∈N, and p >
2, the Sobolev space W k,p(G) is a Banach algebra, that is, the product of two
functions u, v ∈W k,p(G) is again in W k,p(G) and ∥uv∥k,p ≤c ∥u∥k,p∥v∥k,p with
a constant c = c(k, p, G).
□
Finally, we formulate a chain rule for a composition f ◦u with f of class C1.
In the literature, you will usually ﬁnd some assumption on f ′ being bounded. This
is redundant in our case, since our assumptions on u allow us to use the Sobolev
embedding theorem.
Proposition IV.2.18. Let G ⊂C be a bounded Lipschitz domain, p > 2, u ∈
W 1,p(G), and f ∈C1(R). Then, f ◦u ∈W 1,p(G), and for α = (1, 0) or (0, 1) the
weak derivative Dα satisﬁes the chain rule
Dα(f ◦u) = (f ′ ◦u)Dαu.
Proof. By the Sobolev embedding theorem, we have u ∈C0(G), and hence f ◦u ∈
C0(G) ⊂Lp(G).
Choose a sequence (uν) in C∞(G) with uν →u in W 1,p(G) (and hence in
C0(G)). Then, for any test function ϕ ∈C∞
c (G) we have
Z
G
(f ◦uν)Dαϕ = −
Z
G
(f ′ ◦uν)(Dαuν)ϕ.
The function f is uniformly continuous on compact sets, which implies f ◦uν →
f ◦u uniformly in C0(G), so the left-hand side of the above equation converges to
R
G(f ◦u)Dαϕ.

106
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
For the right-hand side, we use the estimate
∥(f ′ ◦uν)(Dαuν)ϕ −(f ′ ◦u)(Dαu)ϕ∥L1 ≤
∥f ′ ◦uν −f ′ ◦u∥C0 · ∥Dαuν∥L1 · ∥ϕ∥C0
+ ∥f ′ ◦u∥C0 · ∥Dαuν −Dαu∥L1 · ∥ϕ∥C0
→
0,
where we use that on compact sets the derivative f ′ is bounded and uniformly
continuous. Since the function (f ′◦u)Dαu is in Lp(G), this proves the proposition.
□
Remark IV.2.19. For ease of notation, in the chain rule we have considered a real-
valued W k,p-function u, but the result generalises in an obvious fashion to vector-
valued functions. This implies that Lemma III.2.4 holds for u ∈W k,p(G, Rm).
We shall also need the chain rule for reparametrisations of the domain.
Exercise IV.2.20. Let G1, G2 ⊂C be bounded Lipschitz domains, τ : G2 →G1 a
C1-diﬀeomorphism, and u ∈W 1,p(G1), p > 2. Show that u ◦τ ∈W 1,p(G2).
In fact, you may well ﬁnd an argument that only uses the boundedness of the
Jacobian of τ, so under this assumption the statement remains true for arbitrary
domains G1, G2 ⊂Rm and p ∈[1, ∞).
♦
Exercise IV.2.21. Give a proof of Proposition IV.2.17 using the chain rule (Propo-
sition IV.2.18) instead of Lemma III.2.2.
♦
IV.2.4
Sobolev estimates
We now reconsider some of the estimates from Chapter III and shall see how
they carry over from smooth to weakly diﬀerentiable functions. Some of the esti-
mates will then involve the following subspace of W k,p(G). The condition k ≥1
is understood; cf. Remark IV.2.1.
Deﬁnition IV.2.22. The space W k,p
0
(G) is the closure of C∞
c (G) in W k,p(G).
For a proof of the next result we refer to [Evans 2010, Theorem 5.5.2] (who
only deals with C1-boundaries) or [Alt 2012, Lemma A6.10]. The proposition holds
for G of arbitrary dimension and p ∈[1, ∞), but then — without the Sobolev
embedding to C0(G) — one needs to be more careful about what one means by
boundary values (the keyword here is ‘trace operator’).4
Proposition IV.2.23. Let G ⊂C be a bounded Lipschitz domain and p > 2. Then,
W k,p
0
(G) equals the set of those u ∈W k,p(G) whose continuous representative
satisﬁes u|∂G ≡0.
□
4Not only the Sobolev embedding theorem but also the deﬁnition of traces requires k ∈N.

IV.2. The Sobolev completion
107
Here is the new version of the a priori estimate (Proposition III.1.16). This
estimate will be instrumental in the Fredholm theory of the ∂-operator in Sec-
tion V.1.5.
Proposition IV.2.24 (The a priori Estimate). For any given natural number k and
real numbers p > 1 and R > 0 there is a positive constant c = c(k, p, R) such that
∥u∥k,p ≤c ∥∂u∥k−1,p
for all u ∈W k,p
0

converging to u with respect to
the Sobolev (k, p)-norm. The continuity of the norm function allows us to pass to
the limit in the inequality of Proposition III.1.16 for uν.
□
Thanks to the chain rule (Proposition IV.2.18), the proof of the polynomial
estimate in Lemma III.2.4 also goes through for Sobolev functions.
Lemma IV.2.25. Let G ⊂C be a bounded Lipschitz domain, k ∈N, and p > 2.
There is a real polynomial P = Pk,p,G of degree k with non-negative coeﬃcients
such that for any u ∈W k,p(G, Rm) and any f ∈C∞(Rm, R) of ﬁnite Ck-norm
we have f ◦u ∈W k,p(G) and
∥f ◦u∥k,p ≤∥f∥Ck P

□
IV.2.5
The completion B of C is a Banach manifold
We now ﬁx a real number p > 2. Then the space of W 1,p-maps B →R2n embeds
into the space of continuous maps D →R2n. Therefore, we can sensibly speak of
the subspace B ⊂C0 of all W 1,p-maps
u: (D, ∂D) −→(R2n, ∂Z)
that satisfy the boundary conditions (M1), (M2) and (M3). The subspace of maps
of level t ∈Rn−1 is denoted by Bt ⊂B.
Likewise, we deﬁne the tangent space TuB = TuBt0⊕Rn−1 as the vector space
of (ξ, t) with ξ a W 1,p-section of u∗TR2n subject to the boundary conditions (T1)
and (T2) in Deﬁnition IV.1.7. A metric on B inducing its topology as a Banach
manifold is deﬁned by the restriction of the (1, p)-norm.
Proposition IV.2.26. The space B is a smooth, separable Banach manifold.
Proof. The very same argument as in Sections IV.1.2 and IV.1.3 shows that B is
a smooth Banach manifold, where we need to observe the following points:
- Lemma IV.2.25 guarantees that the manifold charts do indeed map into the
space of W 1,p-maps.
- For the homeomorphism property of the manifold charts it is essential that
the embedding W 1,p(D) →C0(D) is continuous; see Lemma IV.2.31 below
for details.

108
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
The separability of B, which will be essential for the application of the Sard–
Smale theorem in Chapter V, follows from Theorem IV.2.11 and the next exercise.
□
Exercise IV.2.27. Let (X, d) be a separable metric space. Show that any subspace
A ⊂X is likewise separable. (This is not true, in general, for topological spaces.)
Hint: Let Q ⊂X be a countable dense subset. For q ∈Q, n ∈N, choose aq,n ∈
A ∩B1/n(q) whenever this intersection is non-empty.
♦
As a consequence of the Sobolev embedding theorem, convergence in W 1,p
implies uniform convergence. This means that for a W 1,p-convergent sequence in C,
the boundary conditions (M1) to (M3) persist in the limit. In other words, the
closure of C in W 1,p(B) is contained in B.
Exercise IV.2.28. Show that the closure of C in W 1,p(B) actually coincides with B.
Hint: The essential ingredients here are Theorem IV.2.10 and Proposition IV.2.23.
Look at the components of u individually, and formulate the boundary condition
(M1) as a condition on a function to equal 0 along the boundary. The passage from
smooth functions compactly supported in the interior of D to smooth functions
equal to zero along the boundary requires a cut-oﬀargument; see Exercise V.5.6.
The boundary condition (M3) requires an ad hoc argument.
♦
IV.2.6
Diﬀerentiability of ∂J
The nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann operator ∂J on C extends in a natural fashion to
an operator
∂J : B −→Lp(D, R2n)
by interpreting all derivatives as weak derivatives. Likewise, we can extend the
linearisation Du deﬁned in Section IV.1.4 to a linear map
Du : TuB −→Lp(D, R2n).
Proposition IV.2.29.
(a) The linearisation Du is a continuous linear operator
and hence constitutes the Gateaux derivative of ∂J at u.
(b) The nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann operator ∂J on B is diﬀerentiable of class
C1, that is, the map u 7→Du is continuous. In particular, ∂J is Fr´echet
diﬀerentiable.
Before we attend to the proof of this proposition, we need to clarify what we
mean by u 7→Du being continuous in statement (b), since, as u varies, so does
the space of linear maps in which Du lives.
Remark IV.2.30. Most of the complications that we are dealing with in the present
section stem from the nonlinear boundary condition on the ﬁrst component of our
maps u; see condition (T1) in Deﬁnition IV.1.7. This forces us to deﬁne local
parametrisations via the exponential map, instead of simply using local linear

IV.2. The Sobolev completion
109
coordinates on the target space (here: R2n, where we would even have global
coordinates).
We computed the linearisation Du by using the parametrisation
Tu ⊃Du
expu
−−−−−→Eu ⊂W 1,p(D, R2n)
centred at u; cf. Remark IV.1.14. Here, Tu = TuBt ⊕Rn−1. We now use the same
chart to compute the linearisations Duν for a sequence uν →u. If uν is close to u
in the (1, p)-norm, then also in the C0-norm by the Sobolev embedding theorem.
This means, together with the fact that Exp is a diﬀeomorphism near the zero
section, that we can write uν = expu(ην) for a uniquely deﬁned ην ∈Tu. By the
chain rule (Proposition IV.2.18) and Lemma IV.2.25, applied to the inverse of Exp
near the zero section, ην is indeed of class W 1,p. Conversely, given ην ∈Tu, the
image expu(ην) under the local parametrisation is of class W 1,p (this we remarked
before in Section IV.2.5).
The following lemma says that the local parametrisation expu : Du →Eu
and its inverse, the chart (Eu, exp−1
u ), are continuous at 0 ∈Du and u ∈Eu,
respectively. Similar arguments can be used to show that the charts Eu →Du of
B are homeomorphisms.
Lemma IV.2.31. For uν = expu(ην), the sequence (uν) converges to u in the (1, p)-
norm if and only if the sequence (ην) converges to 0 in the (1, p)-norm.
Proof. Write points of TR2n as (q, v) with q ∈R2n and v ∈TqR2n ≡R2n. On
the unit disc bundle DTR2n with respect to the Euclidean metric we consider the
function
F :
DTR2n
−→
R2n
(q, v)
7−→
expq(v),
where the exponential map is the one with respect to the metric g on R2 ⊕R2n−2
deﬁned in Section IV.1.2. This g is a product metric, invariant under translations
in the R2n−2-direction (on which factor the metric is Euclidean) and, on the R2-
factor, equal to the Euclidean metric outside a compact set. This means that
(i) F(q + q′, v) = F(q, v) + q′ for q′ ∈{0} ⊕R2n−2, and
(ii) for prR2(q) outside a suitable compact subset of R2, we have F(q, v) = q+v
for all |v| ≤1.
Let ∂vF denote the partial Jacobian of F with respect to the v-coordinates,
not the directional derivative in the direction of v. Statements (i) and (ii) imply
that ∂vF is bounded, in the sense that the following supremum over the operator
norm of the partial Jacobian is ﬁnite:
∥∂vF∥:= sup

|∂vF(q, v)|: q, v ∈R2n, |v| < 1
	
< ∞.
Now consider a sequence (ην) in Tu with ην →0. By the Sobolev embedding
theorem, the Euclidean length of ην(z) goes to zero uniformly, and we may assume

110
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
this length to be at most 1 for the whole sequence. We now estimate as in the
proof of Lemma III.2.4:
|uν(z) −u(z)|
=
|F(u(z), ην(z)) −F(u(z), 0)|
=

Z 1

d

≤
∥∂vF∥· |ην(z)|,
which implies
∥uν −u∥Lp ≤∥∂vF∥· ∥ην∥Lp.
Before computing ﬁrst derivatives, we observe that F(q, 0) = q, and hence
the partial Jacobian ∂qF(q, 0) is the identity. Since F is smooth, ∂qF(u, ην) is
C0-close to the identity provided that ην is C0-close to 0, i.e. the constant map
D →0.
We now look at
∂x(uν −u) =
 ∂qF(u, ην) −∂qF(u, 0)

∂xu + ∂vF(u, ην)∂xην,
with a similar expression for the y-derivative. Together with the estimate on the
Lp-norm of uν −u, this yields
∥uν −u∥W 1,p ≤∥∂qF(u, ην) −id ∥C0 ∥u∥W 1,p + ∥∂vF∥· ∥ην∥W 1,p.
As ην goes to zero in the (1, p)-norm, it does so, too, in the C0-norm by the Sobolev
embedding theorem. We conclude that ∥uν −u∥W 1,p →0.
The proof of the converse implication is completely analogous.
□
Proof of Proposition IV.2.29. We demonstrate part (b) and leave (a) as an exer-
cise. The estimates you need to prove part (a) are actually simpler variants of the
ones we are going to establish now.
As in Section IV.1.4, equations (IV.2) and (IV.3), we write
Du = Dt0
u ⊕Ku,
with the linear map Dt0
u : TuBt0 →Lp(D, R2n) given by
Dt0
u (ξ) = ∂xξ + J(u)∂yξ + DJ(u)(ξ)∂yu,
and the linear map Ku : Rn−1 →Lp(D, R2n) given by
Ku(t) = DJ(u)(t)∂yu.
We begin with the second summand Ku in this splitting of Du, for which the
relevant estimate is more straightforward. In particular, we need not worry about
local charts, since the tangent spaces Tu split oﬀa factor Rn−1 globally.

IV.2. The Sobolev completion
111
Claim 1.
The map B ∋u 7→Ku ∈L(Rn−1, Lp(D, R2n)) is continuous.
Since we are dealing with metric spaces, it suﬃces to show that for a sequence
uν →u the operator norm ∥Kuν −Ku∥op goes to zero as ν →∞. We begin with
the triangle inequality
∥(Kuν −Ku)(t)∥Lp
≤
∥DJ(uν)(t)(∂yuν −∂yu)∥Lp
+ ∥
 DJ(uν) −DJ(u)

(t)∂yu∥Lp,
and consider the two summands in turn. The ﬁrst summand we estimate as
∥DJ(uν)(t)(∂yuν −∂yu)∥Lp ≤∥DJ∥· |t| · ∥uν −u∥1,p,
where ∥DJ∥:= supq∈Cn ∥DJ(q)∥op. Notice that ∥DJ∥< ∞, since J coincides
with J0 outside a compact set.
For the second summand, we write
DJ(uν) −DJ(u) =
Z 1

This allows us to estimate
∥
 DJ(uν) −DJ(u)

(t)∂yu∥Lp ≤∥D2J∥· ∥uν −u∥C0 · |t| · ∥u∥1,p,
and thanks to the Sobolev embedding theorem we may replace (up to a constant c)
the C0-norm of uν −u by the Sobolev (1, p)-norm.
Putting things together, we obtain the estimate
∥Kuν −Ku∥op ≤

∥DJ∥+ c ∥D2J∥· ∥u∥1,p

· ∥uν −u∥1,p,
which proves Claim 1.
Claim 2.
The map Bt ∋u 7→Dt
u ∈L(TuBt, Lp(D, R2n)) is continuous.
For the continuity of Dt
u (with t the level of u), we may ignore the shifts in the
t-direction and study a sequence uν →u on a ﬁxed level t. As in Lemma IV.2.31,
we write uν = expu(ην), now with ην ∈TuBt. We then need to estimate the
diﬀerence Dt
uν(ξν) −Dt
u(ξ), where
ξν := Tην expu(ξ) ∈TuνBt.
In this last expression, ξ is an element of Tην(TuBt) ≡TuBt, with a neighbourhood
of the origin in TuBt regarded as the domain of deﬁnition of the local parametri-
sation expu; see Figure IV.1, and cf. Remark IV.1.14 for the identiﬁcation of
T0TuBt ≡TuBt in the domain of the chart with the actual tangent space TuBt to
Bt at u.
This means that we may read this diﬀerence Dt
uν(ξν) −Dt
u(ξ) as a linear
operator on TuBt, and our task is to show that its operator norm goes to zero as
uν →u.

where the last inequality holds thanks to Proposition IV.2.17.
Deﬁne f : DTR2n →L(R2n, R2n) by
f(q, v) = Tv expq −id.
Observe that f(q, 0) = 0. By the same reasoning as at the beginning of the proof
of Lemma IV.2.31, we see that ∥∂vf∥< ∞.
Our aim now is to show that ∥f(u, ην)∥1,p goes to zero as ην →0.
For w ∈TvTqR2n ≡R2n and |v| ≤1 we have

This implies ∥f(u, ην)∥Lp ≤∥∂vf∥· ∥ην∥Lp.
Next we consider ﬁrst derivatives. Since f(q, 0) is identically equal to the
zero map R2n →R2n, we have ∂qf(q, 0) = 0. The map f is smooth, so ∂qf(u, ην)
will be C0-close to the zero map provided that ην is C0-close to 0.
We compute
∂x
 f(u, ην)

= ∂qf(u, ην)∂xu + ∂vf(u, ην)∂xην,
and similarly for the y-derivative. Together with the estimate on the Lp-norm of
f(u, ην) we have
∥f(u, ην)∥1,p ≤∥∂qf(u, ην)∥C0 ∥u∥1,p + ∥∂vf∥· ∥ην∥1,p,
which goes to zero as ην →0.
The remaining estimates for the terms in Dt

(c) Prove, using similar (but simpler) estimates, that the map u 7→∂Ju is con-

IV.3
Elliptic regularity
Recall that we are dealing with the moduli space
M = {u ∈C : ∂Ju = 0}.
The aim of the present section is to show that we obtain exactly the same space
if we study the equation ∂Ju = 0 on the larger space B of W 1,p-maps for some
p > 2.
Theorem IV.3.1. Let u ∈B be a solution of the nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann equa-
tion ∂Ju = 0. Then, u is actually of class C∞, that is, u ∈C.
IV.3.1
The topology on M
Thus, as a set we have
M = {u ∈B: ∂Ju = 0}.
Potentially, the topology on M induced by the C∞-topology on C might be diﬀer-
ent from that induced by the W 1,p-metric on B. The next lemma shows that, in

114
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
fact, the two topologies coincide. The space of C∞-maps D →R2n is ﬁrst-countable
and even metrisable (Remark II.2.4), so to establish the homeomorphism prop-
erty of the identity map on M with respect to one topology on the domain and
the other one on the target, it suﬃces to establish the following lemma about
sequential continuity.
Lemma IV.3.2. A sequence (uν) in M converges to u ∈M with respect to the
C∞-topology if and only if it does so with respect to the W 1,p-topology.
Proof. One direction is straightforward. If uν →u with respect to the C∞-
topology, then a fortiori with respect to the C1-norm. Since D is compact, this
implies convergence with respect to the (1, p)-norm.
Conversely, Corollary III.3.12 tells us that W 1,p-convergence implies that
uν →u with respect to all (k, p)-norms. The Sobolev embedding theorem says
that W k,p-convergence implies Ck−1-convergence. We conclude to convergence in
the C∞-topology.
□
IV.3.2
A local estimate
The smoothness of u ∈B with ∂Ju = 0 is a local property. Thus, to check smooth-
ness near a point z ∈∂D we can use a conformal identiﬁcation of D\{eiθ} for some
θ ∈R with the upper half-plane H both in the domain of deﬁnition and in the ﬁrst
complex coordinate of the image, such that z is mapped to 0 ∈∂H. Thanks to the
chain rule (Proposition IV.2.18 and Exercise IV.2.20) and the fact that conformal
reparametrisations of J-holomorphic curves are J-holomorphic (Exercise I.3.11),
it then suﬃces to study the following situation:
- The almost complex structure J on R2n coincides with J0 along
Rn =
 R ⊕{0}
n.
- For some r0 > 0, we have a map u ∈W 1,p(Br0 ∩H, R2n) weakly solving the
equation ∂Ju = 0 (formally speaking: almost everywhere) and satisfying the
boundary condition u(Br0 ∩∂H) ⊂Rn. (Recall that Br0 ⊂C is the open disc
of radius r0 centred at 0.)
Locally near an interior point of D, we simply study a map u ∈W 1,p(Br0, R2n)
on a small open ball, satisfying ∂Ju = 0. Most of what follows deals with the local
behaviour near a boundary point, and we shall remark on the simpliﬁcations in
the interior case at the appropriate places.
Two comments are in order. When we write W 1,p(Br0 ∩H), strictly speaking
we mean the space of W 1,p-functions on the interior of Br0∩H. Second, the Sobolev
embedding theorem guarantees that such functions extend continuously to Br0 ∩H
(and its closure in C), so it makes sense to formulate the boundary condition.

IV.3. Elliptic regularity
115
Notation IV.3.3. For G ⊂C, v ∈C, and λ ∈R+, we write
G + v := {z + v: z ∈G}
and
λG := {λz : z ∈G}.
Presently we shall have to restrict u to the subset B+ := Br ∩H for some
r ∈(0, r0], which we drop from the notation. For λ ∈R+, the notation B+
λ stands
for λB+.
For r < r0 and h ∈R with |h| ≤r0 −r we have B+ + (h, 0) ⊂Br0 ∩H, so
we can deﬁne the shift operator τhu: B+ →R2n by
(τhu)(x, y) = u(x + h, y).
For h ̸= 0, we then introduce the diﬀerence quotient
uh = τhu −u
h
on B+. Observe that uh(x, 0) ∈Rn.
If B+ is replaced by B+
λ for some λ < 1, these deﬁnitions also make sense
for r = r0, and the condition on h becomes |h| < r0 −λr.
As we shall see, Theorem IV.3.1 is a fairly straightforward consequence of
the following deceptively simple lemma, whose proof (which will be presented in
Section IV.3.5) is surprisingly subtle.
Lemma IV.3.4. Let u ∈W 1,p(Br0∩H, R2n), p > 2, be a map with u(Br0∩∂H) ⊂Rn
and ∂Ju = 0. Then there is an r ∈(0, r0] and a positive constant c = c(p, u) such
that
∥uh∥1,p,B+

In the interior case, Br0 ∩H is replaced by Br0, and B+
1/2 by Br/2.
IV.3.3
The shift operator
Before we derive Theorem IV.3.1 from this lemma, we discuss some basic properties
of the shift operator τh. Consider an Lp-function u: G →R on a domain G ⊂C.
For any subdomain G′ ⊂G and all h ̸= 0 with |h| < dist(G′, ∂G), the diﬀerence
quotient uh is deﬁned on G′ and of class Lp. The following statement can be
thought of as an Lp-version of the mean value theorem.
Lemma IV.3.5. If u ∈W 1,p(G), p ∈[1, ∞), then
∥uh∥Lp(G′) ≤∥ux∥Lp(G),
where ux = ∂xu denotes the weak derivative.

116
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
Proof. By Theorem IV.2.7, it suﬃces to prove this inequality for functions u ∈
C1(G) ∩W 1,p(G). We compute

□
Exercise IV.3.6. For u, v ∈W 1,p(G), prove that on G′ the following identities
hold:
(i) ∂x ◦τh = τh ◦∂x or, equivalently, ∂x(uh) = (∂xu)h in Lp(G′);
(ii) (uv)h = uhτhv + uvh in W 1,p(G′).
♦
Lemma IV.3.7. Let u ∈Lp(G), p ∈(1, ∞), be a function with the property that
there is a constant K such that for all bounded subdomains G′ ⊂G and all h ̸= 0
with |h| < dist(G′, ∂G) we have ∥uh∥Lp(G′) ≤K. Then the weak derivative ux
exists on G and satisﬁes ∥ux∥Lp(G) ≤K.
Proof. Let ϕ be a smooth function with compact support in G. For 0 < h <
dist(supp ϕ, ∂G), we have

extends to a continuous linear functional on Lq(G), with operator norm bounded

♦
Recall that the dual space of Lq(G), that is, the space of continuous lin-
ear functionals on Lq(G), for 1 ≤q < ∞, equals Lp(G); see [Lieb & Loss 2001,
Theorem 2.14]. (This result fails for q = ∞, and since q is the dual coeﬃcient
to p, we need the requirement p > 1.) This means that any linear functional
Lq(G) ∋w 7→A(w) ∈R can be written as A(w) =
R
G vw for some unique
v ∈Lp(G), and the operator norm of A equals ∥v∥Lp.
Applied to our situation, we ﬁnd, a fortiori, v ∈Lp(G) with ∥v∥Lp(G) ≤K

This is saying that the weak derivative ux exists and equals v.

Exercise IV.3.9. Formulate and prove an analogous statement for domains in the
upper half-plane H.
♦
IV.3.4
Proof of Theorem IV.3.1
Let u ∈B be a map D →R2n satisfying the nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann equation
∂Ju = 0. Our aim is to show that u, which is a priori only of class W 1,p, is actually
smooth.
By assumption, the weak derivative ux exists and is in Lp. We now work in
the local setting of Lemma IV.3.4, describing the map u near a boundary point.

Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
with a similar description in the neighbourhood of an interior point of D. The
notation uh
x is unambiguous by Exercise IV.3.6. Lemma IV.3.7 (in its version
for domains in H), applied to G = B+
1/2, tells us that the weak derivative uxx
exists on B+
1/2 and is an Lp-function. Similarly, by starting with uh
y, we ﬁnd that
uyx ∈Lp(B+
1/2).
Exercise IV.3.10. Let G ⊂C be a domain and v ∈W 1,p(G). Suppose that the
weak derivative vyx := ∂x∂yv exists. Show that vxy exists and equals vyx.
♦
With this exercise we deduce that ux ∈W 1,p(B+
1/2). From ∂Ju = 0 we
have uy = J(u)ux, which lies in W 1,p(B+
1/2) thanks to the chain rule (Propo-
sition IV.2.18) and W 1,p(G) being a Banach algebra (Proposition IV.2.17). We
conclude that u ∈W 2,p(B+
1/2). However, the argument up to this point applies
locally near any point of D; hence, with the following exercise, in fact we have
u ∈W 2,p(D).
Exercise IV.3.11. Let (λj) be a partition of unity on D, subordinate to a covering
by open subsets Uj ⊂D, and u: D →R a function with u|Uj of class W 1,p for
all j. Show that by summing over the formula for the weak derivatives of λju one
can deduce u ∈W 1,p(D).
♦
By the Sobolev embedding theorem, u is of class C1 on D. In particular, the
partial derivatives of u (on D or in a local reparametrisation) are derivatives in
the classical sense, deﬁned and continuous on D.
To continue the bootstrapping, we want to apply this lifting from W 1,p to
W 2,p to the partial 1-jet5
w(z) :=
 z, u(z), ux(z)

,
z ∈Br0 ∩H,
with the same setting as before, but now the higher-dimensional target space
C⊕R2n ⊕R2n. This requires (for the local description near boundary points only)
the deﬁnition of an appropriate almost complex structure on this target space,
which is the content of the next exercise.
Exercise IV.3.12. Let J be an almost complex structure on R2n that coincides
with J0 along Rn =
 R ⊕{0}
n. For u, v ∈R2n, set
A(u, v) = DJ(u)(v)
 J(u)v

∈R2n.
Here, DJ(u)(v) is the diﬀerential of J at u in the direction of v; this is again a
linear operator on R2n, which is then applied to the vector J(u)v.
5See [Geiges 2003] for a brief introduction to the language of jets, which are equivalence classes
of (local) sections of ﬁbre bundles. A map M →N between two manifolds may be regarded as a
section of the trivial bundle M × N →M. An r-jet, r ∈N0, at x ∈M is an equivalence class of
smooth local sections around x, determined by the partial derivatives (in some local coordinate
system) at x up to order r. In the situation at hand, we only consider one of the two ﬁrst-order
derivatives, hence ‘partial’ 1-jet.

deﬁnes an almost complex structure on C ⊕R2n ⊕R2n that coincides with
i ⊕J0 ⊕J0 along R ⊕Rn ⊕Rn.
(b) Let G ⊂C be a domain and u: G →R2n a J-holomorphic map. Show that
the partial 1-jet w: G →C ⊕R2n ⊕R2n deﬁned by w(z) =
 z, u(z), ux(z)

is a ˜J-holomorphic map.
♦
Returning to our map u: D →R2n, we observe that the boundary condition
implies that (in the local setting) w sends Br0 ∩H to R ⊕Rn ⊕Rn, so we are in a
completely analogous set-up. Thus, our previous argument implies w ∈W 2,p(B+),
and in particular ux ∈W 2,p(B+). As above, with the J-holomorphicity of u we
infer that u ∈W 3,p(B+), and then globalise again to u ∈W 3,p(D).
Continuing in this fashion with the partial 1-jet of w, inductively we see that
u ∈W k,p(D) for all k ∈N, whence u ∈C∞(D) by Sobolev embedding.
This concludes the proof of Theorem IV.3.1, up to Lemma IV.3.4.
IV.3.5
Proof of the deceptively simple lemma
For the proof of Lemma IV.3.4 we need two estimates of a more general nature.
One is an a priori estimate for maps deﬁned on domains in H with real boundary
values; the second is an inequality of ‘Peter Paul’ type (the expression will be
explained).
In the a priori estimate we use the notation B+
R := BR ∩H.
Proposition IV.3.13 (The a priori Estimate With Boundary). For any real num-
bers p > 1 and R > 0 there is a constant c = c(p, R) such that
∥u∥1,p,B+
R ≤c ∥∂u∥Lp(B+
R)
for all u ∈C∞
c
 B+
R, C

with u(BR ∩∂H) ⊂R.
Remark IV.3.14. By passing to the limit as in the proof of Proposition IV.2.24,
the same equality holds for the closure of

Proof of Proposition IV.3.13. Given u ∈C∞
c

with u(BR ∩∂H) ⊂R, we
deﬁne ˆu: BR →C by Schwarz reﬂection:
ˆu(z) :=
(
u(z)
for Im(z) ≥0,
u(z)
for Im(z) < 0.
This function ˆu is continuous.

120
Chapter IV. Elliptic Regularity
Exercise IV.3.15. Write u = f + ig and ˆu = ˜f + i˜g with real-valued functions
f, g, ˜f, ˜g.
(a) Show that the partial derivatives ˆux and ˜gy exist and are continuous, and
that ˜fy exists (and is then continuous) if and only if fy = 0 along the real
axis (which happens, for instance, when u is holomorphic).
(b) Show that ˆu is weakly diﬀerentiable with weak derivative
˜fy(x, y) =
(
fy(x, y)
for y ≥0,
−fy(x, −y)
for y < 0.
(c) Show that ∂ˆu (in the weak sense), with ∂= ∂x + i∂y, is given by
∂ˆu(x, y) =
( fx −gy + i(gx + fy)

(x, y)
for y ≥0,
 fx −gy −i(gx + fy)

(x, −y)
for y < 0.
In particular, |∂ˆu(x, −y)| = |∂ˆu(x, y)|.
♦
From this exercise it follows that ˆu is of class W 1,p, and since it is com-
pactly supported in BR, by Proposition IV.2.23 (and the comments before it), ˆu
can be approximated in the Sobolev (1, p)-norm by smooth functions compactly
supported in BR.
With c = c(1, p, R) the constant from the a priori estimate in Proposi-
tion IV.2.24, we then conclude
∥u∥1,p,B+
R = 1
2∥ˆu∥1,p,BR ≤1
2c∥∂ˆu∥Lp(BR) ≤c∥∂u∥Lp(B+
R),
where we have used the explicit expression of the (weak) derivatives of ˆu in terms
of those of u.
□
Note IV.3.16. In the proof of Lemma IV.3.4, we need to apply the a priori estimate
to a function of the form fu, with u ∈W 1,p(B+
R, C) for some p > 2, u(BR ∩∂H) ⊂
R, and f : H →[0, 1] a bump function with support in B+
3R/4 and f ≡1 on B+
R/2.
The estimate does indeed hold in this situation, which we see as follows. Write
u = v +iw with v, w real-valued. Then, fw = 0 on ∂B+
R, so by Proposition IV.2.23
we ﬁnd wν ∈C∞
c
 Int(B+
R)

with wν →fw in the (1, p)-norm. The real part v can
be approximated by functions vν ∈C∞ B+
R

by Theorem IV.2.10. Then, the a
priori estimate holds for uν := fvν + iwν (sic!), and uν →fu.
The name of the following inequality refers to the adage that one must ‘rob
Peter to pay Paul’. It is a special case of a general class of inequalities where a
term is estimated by the sum of two terms, one of which can be made small at the
price of making the second summand large.

IV.3. Elliptic regularity
121
Proposition IV.3.17 (Peter Paul Inequality). Let G ⊂C be a bounded Lipschitz
domain and p > 2. Then, for any ε > 0, there is a Cε > 0 such that
∥u∥C0(G) ≤ε∥u∥1,p,G + Cε∥u∥Lp(G)
for all u ∈W 1,p(G).
Proof. We prove this by contradiction. Assume that there is an ε > 0 such that
no Cε with the desired property exists. This means that we can ﬁnd a sequence
(uν) in W 1,p(G) with ∥uν∥1,p,G = 1 for all ν ∈N and
∥uν∥C0(G) > ε + ν∥uν∥Lp(G).
As the embedding W 1,p(G) →C0(G) is compact by Theorem IV.2.12, the bounded
sequence (uν) in W 1,p(G) has a subsequence (uνj) that converges uniformly on G
to some function u ∈C0(G). The inequality
∥uνj∥Lp(G) < 1
νj
 ∥uνj∥C0(G) −ε

yields u = 0 in the limit j →∞. But then
0 < ε + νj∥uνj∥Lp(G) < ∥uνj∥C0(G) −→0
as j →∞,
and thus ε = 0, a contradiction.
□
At last we can turn to the proof of the key lemma of this section.
Proof of Lemma IV.3.4. We start from the equation 0 = ∂Ju = ux+J(u)uy. With
Exercise IV.3.6 we get
uh
x + J(u)uh
y +
 J(u)
hτhuy = 0.

Write c0 = c(p, r0) for the constant in the a priori estimate of Proposi-

have
∥J0 −J(u)∥C0(B+) ≤

2c0
.
Here we use that along ∂H, the map u takes values in
 R⊕{0}
n ⊂Cn, and along
that set we have J = J0. For the discussion around a point z ∈Int(D), we make
instead a transformation around p = u(z) as on page 84 et seq. to achieve J = J0
at p. (At a point z ∈∂D, such a transformation would interfere with the boundary
condition on u.)

Now let f : H →[0, 1] be a bump function with support in B+

our purposes. The second summand, given the estimate on ∥J0 −J(u)∥C0(B+),

M¨unchhausen trick, again). Finally, for the third summand we can use the es-
timate ∥τhuy∥Lp(B+
3/4) ≤∥u∥1,p,B+ ≤const. , so in total we obtain

which is the desired estimate.
□
Remark IV.3.18. Some of the complications in the above argument stem from
the fact that we are dealing with boundaries. Since the boundaries of our J-holo-
morphic discs lie in a region where J = J0, where our discs are honest holomorphic
curves, one could use Schwarz reﬂection and then appeal to the Weyl lemma (see
Section V.6.3), in order to establish Theorem IV.3.1 near the boundary, i.e. the
smoothness of u ∈B near ∂D.
IV.3.6
The need for the Sobolev completion
We can pinpoint two places in the bootstrapping argument that led to a proof of
Theorem IV.3.1 where the reasoning will fail if we try instead to bootstrap from
Ck to Ck+1.
One is Lemma IV.3.7, where we deduced the existence of the weak derivative
from the boundedness of the diﬀerence quotient. For instance, the norm function
u(x) = |x| on R is continuous and satisﬁes |uh| ≤1, but u is not of class C1.
The second is the a priori estimate; cf. Section III.1.6. This also ties up with
the Fredholm property of the ∂-operator, as we shall see in Exercise V.1.4.
See also [Sikorav 1994], where the regularity theory is based on α-H¨older
estimates with 0 < α < 1, or page 572 in [McDuﬀ& Salamon 2012], where the
nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann equation ∂Ju = 0 is transformed into an inhomoge-
neous linear equation ∂u = f; cf. Section V.3.2. Here, the bootstrapping from Ck
to Ck+1 fails by Exercise III.1.23.

Chapter V
Transversality
In Unwissenheit bricht sich dein Blick, denn aus

Raum Bescheid... Wir gehen, wir gehen, – wie
lange schon? Wie weit? Das steht dahin.
Thomas Mann, Der Zauberberg
The ﬁnal and crucial part still missing from the proof of Theorem I.8.13 is
the veriﬁcation that the moduli space M does indeed carry the structure of a
ﬁnite-dimensional manifold. This will be the content of the present chapter.
In Section IV.3 we have rewritten the moduli space M as the zero set of the
nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann operator on the Banach manifold B. This now allows
us to appeal to the implicit function theorem and the Sard–Smale theorem for
Banach manifolds, which involve the concept of Fredholm operators.
Some readers may be familiar with the basics of Fredholm theory from a
ﬁrst course on functional analysis. Nonetheless, we recall all the relevant results
(and most proofs) in Section V.1, and then apply them to the situation at hand.
The implicit function theorem and the Sard–Smale theorem will be presented in
Section V.2.
The further strategy for proving that M is a manifold (for a suitable choice of
almost complex structure on the target space) will be outlined in Section V.2.4, and
the proof will be completed in Section V.7.1. Essential ingredients in this proof are
the Carleman similarity principle (Section V.3) and the notion of injective points
of holomorphic curves (Section V.4).
Finally, we need to address the statements in Theorem I.8.13, the central
theorem of this course, concerning the properties of the evaluation map. This will
be done in Section V.7.3. The relevant diﬀerential topological background for the
concept of mapping degree will be provided in Section V.7.2. With this, we shall
have completed the proof of Gromov’s nonsqueezing theorem.

Chapter V. Transversality
The terminology ‘transversality’ that gives this chapter its name will be ex-
plained at the beginning of Section V.2.
V.1
Fredholm theory
In this section we introduce the fundamentals of Fredholm theory. We then show
that the linearised Cauchy–Riemann operator is Fredholm, and we determine its
Fredholm index (Theorem V.1.5).
V.1.1
Fredholm operators
By E, F etc. we denote Banach spaces. As you are probably aware from a course
on linear analysis (or basic functional analysis), a linear operator E →F is a
continuous map if and only if it is bounded, i.e. its operator norm is ﬁnite; see
[Hirzebruch & Scharlau 1971, §5]. We use the terms ‘continuous’ and ‘bounded’
synonymously in this context, and we usually pick the one that describes the
feature most relevant to the issue at hand.
Deﬁnition V.1.1. A Fredholm operator is a bounded linear map T : E →F with
the following properties:
(i) ker T := T −1(0) is ﬁnite-dimensional, and
(ii) coker T := F/T(E) is ﬁnite-dimensional.
The integer
ind T := dim ker T −dim coker T
is called the index of T.
The quotient space of a normed space by a subspace carries a natural norm
only if the subspace is closed; in the case of a Banach space, the quotient space is
then likewise Banach. For a Fredholm operator T : E →F, the image T(E) ⊂F is
indeed a closed subspace, as we show in the next lemma.
Lemma V.1.2. Let T : E →F be a bounded linear map. If coker T is ﬁnite-
dimensional, then the image im T = T(E) ⊂F is a closed subspace.
Proof. Since ker T ⊂E is a closed subspace, we can pass to the Banach space
E/ ker T and the induced linear map E/ ker T →F, whose image equals T(E).
Thus, without loss of generality we may assume that T is injective.
Choose f1, . . . , fn ∈F, n = dim coker T, that descend to a basis for coker T.
Consider the map
eT :
Rn ⊕E

λ1f1 + · · · + λnfn + T(x).
Exercise V.1.3. Verify that eT is continuous and bijective.
♦

V.1. Fredholm theory
127
By the open mapping theorem, a surjective continuous linear operator be-
tween Banach spaces is an open map. Since {0}⊕E is a closed subspace of Rn ⊕E,
it follows that T(E) = eT
 {0} ⊕E

is a closed subspace of F.
□
The next exercise demonstrates the relevance of the a priori estimate (Propo-
sition IV.2.24) for the Fredholm property of the ∂-operator, and hence, by Exer-
cise III.1.23, the need for Sobolev spaces in our analytical set-up. For an extensive
discussion of this issue, see [Geiges, Sa˘glam & Zehmisch 2023].
Exercise V.1.4. Let T : E →F be a bounded operator with dim ker T < ∞. Let
E1 be a closed complement1 of ker T in E. Use the open mapping theorem to show
that im T is closed if and only if we have an estimate of the form ∥x∥E ≤c∥Tx∥F
for all x ∈E1.
♦
V.1.2
The Fredholm index of ∂J
We now turn to the Cauchy–Riemann operator, deﬁned on the Banach manifold
B of W k,p-maps introduced in Section IV.2.5, with a choice of k ≥1 and p > 2
understood. The conditions on k and p are essential, as we shall frequently rely
on the Sobolev embedding theorem and the Banach algebra property of W k,p in
the discussion that follows; cf. Remark IV.2.1.
Theorem V.1.5. For all u ∈B, the linearised Cauchy–Riemann operator
Du : TuB −→Lp(D, R2n)
is a Fredholm operator of index 2n −2. If u is a ﬂat disc, then Du = ∂(cf.
Remark IV.1.18) is surjective.
The proof of this theorem will be given over the course of several subsections,
by a successive reduction of the problem. We begin by showing that it suﬃces to
study the operator on a ﬁxed level t ∈Rn−1. Recall from Section IV.1.4 that for
u ∈B of level t, we have a splitting
TuB = TuBt ⊕TtRn−1,
and a corresponding splitting
Du = Dt
u ⊕Ku.
Lemma V.1.6. The operator Du is Fredholm if and only if Dt
u is Fredholm, and in
this case we have
ind Du = ind Dt
u + (n −1).
1Such a closed complement exists; see Note V.1.15.

128
Chapter V. Transversality
Proof. Both the kernel and the image of Du diﬀer from those of Dt
u by at most
an (n −1)-dimensional space. This proves the ﬁrst statement. For the dimension
count in the Fredholm situation, we split Rn−1 = TtRn−1 as
Rn−1 = ker Ku ⊕A ⊕B,
where A is mapped injectively by Ku into the image of Dt
u, and the isomorphic
image of B has the property Ku(B) ∩im Dt
u = {0}. Then,
dim ker Du = dim ker Dt
u + dim ker Ku + dim A
and
dim coker Du = dim coker Dt
u −dim B.
The lemma follows.
□
Remark V.1.7. Here we could have argued from more general principles. The
operator Ku, being deﬁned on a ﬁnite-dimensional space, is compact. The sum
of a Fredholm and a compact operator (on the same space) is again Fredholm
of the same index (we shall prove this in Section V.1.4, where we cannot do
without this fact). From this, Lemma V.1.6 is immediate, where you need to
regard Du = Dt
u ⊕Ku as a compact perturbation of Dt
u ⊕0 on TuB; the latter
operator has the same image as Dt
u, but an extra summand Rn−1 in the kernel.
V.1.3
Transformation to a perturbed ∂-operator
We now want to show that, given u ∈Bt, we can conjugate the operator Dt
u to
a compact perturbation of the linear Cauchy–Riemann operator ∂on a space V p
isomorphic to TuBt, where the boundary condition (see Deﬁnition IV.1.7) has been
‘straightened’. This, as we shall see in Section V.1.4, will reduce the problem to
computing the index of ∂on V p. In other words, this conjugation simpliﬁes both
the Banach space and the operator whose index we wish to compute.
Anticipating this transformation, we identify R2n with Cn, even though the
operator Dt
u is the linearised Cauchy–Riemann operator corresponding to some
almost complex structure J on R2n.
We deﬁne V p as the space of those η = (η1, . . . , ηn) ∈W 1,p(D, Cn) — where
the Sobolev embedding theorem allows us to work with continuous representatives
— that satisfy
η(eiθ) ∈eiθR ⊕Rn−1, θ ∈R/2πZ,
and
η1(ik) = 0, k ∈{0, 1, 2}.
Notation V.1.8. Since we are working with a ﬁxed disc u, it is convenient to regard
the almost complex structure J along the image u(D) as a matrix-valued function
on D, that is, by slight abuse of notation we shall from now on think of J as the
function deﬁned by J(z) := J(u(z)).

V.1. Fredholm theory
129
Lemma V.1.9. There is a map B0 : D →GL(2n, R) of class W 1,p (and hence
continuous) into the general linear group such that
ξ 7−→B0ξ :=

z 7→B0(z)
 ξ(z)
	
deﬁnes an isomorphism B0 : TuBt →V p, and an Lp-map C : D →EndR(Cn) =
R2n×2n to the real linear endomorphisms of Cn = R2n such that with
Tη := ∂η + Cη
the following diagram commutes:
TuBt
Dt

- Lp(D, Cn)
V p
B0
?
T
- Lp(D, Cn)
B0
?
Moreover, the map B0 conjugates the almost complex structure along the holo-
morphic disc u to the standard structure, that is, with Notation V.1.8 we have
B0JB−1
0
= J0 as matrix-valued functions on D.
Note V.1.10. Since the map f 7→

z 7→B0(z)
 f(z)
	
is an isomorphism of
Lp(D, Cn), with Lemma V.1.6 this lemma reduces the proof of Theorem V.1.5
to showing that T = ∂+ C is a Fredholm operator of index n −1.
Proof of Lemma V.1.9. We begin with the construction of an isomorphism from
TuBt to V p, deﬁned by a matrix-valued function B on D. The composition B0 of
B with a suitable isomorphism of V p will then give us the conjugation formula
B0JB−1
0
= J0. From this we shall derive the formula for the conjugated Cauchy–
Riemann operator.
We wish to deﬁne B : D →GL(2n, R) as a map of the form
B =

: D −→GL(C ⊕R2n−2),
where E denotes the unit matrix of rank 2n −2.
Recall from Deﬁnition IV.1.7 that for ξ = (ξ1, . . . , ξn) ∈TuBt we have the
boundary conditions ξ1(z) ∈Riu1(z) and ξ2(z), . . . , ξn(z) ∈R for all z ∈∂D, as
well as ξ1(ik) = 0 for k ∈{0, 1, 2}.
Choose a radius r0 ∈(0, 1) such that J(z) = J0 and u1(z) ̸= 0 for all z ∈D
with |z| ≥r0. The universal cover eA of the annulus A := D\Br0 is eA = [r0, 1]×R.

130
Chapter V. Transversality
We write pr: (r, θ) 7→reiθ for the covering projections eA →A and R+ × R →C∗.
By condition (M3) from Notation I.8.10, the map u1 : A →C∗has a unique lift
˜u1 : eA →R+ × R, that is, a map that ﬁts into the commutative diagram

determined by ˜u1(1, 0) = (1, 0). The homotopy condition (M2) implies that
˜u1(r, θ + 2π) = ˜u1(r, θ) + (0, 2π).
Choose a smooth function τ : [r0, 1] →[0, 1] with τ(r) = 0 near r = r0, and
τ(r) = 1 near r = 1. Now deﬁne eH : eA →R+ × R by
eH(r, θ) =

·
 ˜u1(r, θ) + (0, π/2)

+ τ(r)(r, θ),
and H : A →C∗by H(reiθ) = pr ◦eH(r, θ). Finally, deﬁne
b(z) :=
(

for |z| < r0,
H(z)
iu1(z)
for r0 ≤|z| ≤1.
Exercise V.1.11. Verify that b ≡1 on a neighbourhood of {|z| ≤r0}, and
b(eiθ) =
eiθ
iu1(eiθ).
Show that b: D →C is of class W 1,p by the rules of diﬀerentiation from Sec-
tion IV.2.3 and the Banach algebra property (Proposition IV.2.17).
♦
Then multiplication by B (as deﬁned for B0 in the statement of the lemma)
deﬁnes an isomorphism TuBt →V p, thanks to the Banach algebra property of
W 1,p.
Exercise V.1.12. Show that the matrix-valued function B satisﬁes BJB−1 = J
on D.
♦
Now choose pointwise a conjugation matrix A(z) as on page 84, such that
AJA−1 = J0 on D. Notice that the construction of A(p), p ∈Cn, described there
yields a smooth matrix-valued function on Cn. But now we set A(z) := Au(z),
so this is a W 1,p-function on D by the chain rule. Also, A(z) equals the identity
matrix for |z| close to 1, so η 7→Aη deﬁnes an isomorphism of V p. Then, B0 := AB
has the properties described in the lemma.

It remains to compute the transformed operator T. Recall equation (IV.2)

(V.2)
Each of the three summands is a product of matrix-valued maps, at most one of
which is of class Lp, and the others of class W 1,p and hence of class C0 by Sobolev
embedding. By the compactness of D, such products are of class Lp.
□
V.1.4
Fredholm plus compact is Fredholm
We now want to show that in fact it suﬃces to prove that ∂is a Fredholm operator
if we want to demonstrate this property for ∂+ C; cf. Note V.1.10. We begin with
a little general Fredholm theory.
Recall that an operator K : E →F is called compact if the image under K
of the open unit ball in E is relatively compact. Equivalently, the image of every
bounded sequence in E has a convergent subsequence. In particular, a compact
operator is bounded.
Exercise V.1.13. Prove the following statements:
(i) The sum of two compact operators is compact.
(ii) The pre- or post-composition of a compact operator with a bounded operator
is compact.
For (i) one can ﬁnd a direct proof, but you may also use (ii).
♦
Example V.1.14.
(1) If idE is compact, then E is ﬁnite-dimensional, since the
closed unit ball in a Banach space is compact only in ﬁnite dimensions; see
[Hirzebruch & Scharlau 1971, Lemma 24.2].
2Here we write DJ
 u(z)

rather than DJ(z), since for the diﬀerential it is essential that J is
a map deﬁned on R2n.

132
Chapter V. Transversality
(2) If T : E →F is bounded and im T is ﬁnite-dimensional, then T is compact.
(3) With the Arzel`a–Ascoli theorem one can show that the dual K∗: F∗→E∗of
a compact operator K is likewise compact; see [Hirzebruch & Scharlau 1971,
Satz 24.5].
We shall also be using the facts stated in the next note.
Note V.1.15. Any ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of a Banach space is closed, and it
can be shown to possess a complementary closed subspace (use the Hahn–Banach
extension theorem to deﬁne a projection operator P onto the given subspace; the
kernel of P is the complementary subspace). Likewise (and more trivially), any
closed subspace of ﬁnite codimension has a (closed) complement. See, for instance,
Lemmas 24.7 and 24.8 in [Hirzebruch & Scharlau 1971].
In particular, for a Fredholm operator T : E →F we have splittings E ∼=
ker T ⊕V and F ∼= im T ⊕W with dim ker T, dim W < ∞.
Exercise V.1.16. Let T : E →F be a bounded linear operator, and T ∗: F∗→E∗
the dual operator. Show that if im T is closed (so that coker T is a Banach space),
then
(coker T)∗∼= ker T ∗.
Hint: Verify that the maps ker T ∗→(coker T)∗, ρ 7→λ with λ(y + im T) := ρ(y)
and (coker T)∗→ker T ∗, λ 7→ρ with ρ deﬁned as the composition
F −→F/ im T
λ
−→R,
are well deﬁned and inverses of each other.
For a more systematic approach to this statement, see Exercise V.1.21.
♦
Lemma V.1.17. Let K : E →E be a compact operator. Then, T := idE −K is
Fredholm.
Proof. (i) ker T is ﬁnite-dimensional: The identity map on ker T equals idE |ker T =
K|ker T , and hence is compact. This implies that ker T is ﬁnite-dimensional.
(ii) The image im T = T(E) is closed: As a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace,
ker T ⊂E is closed and has a complementary closed subspace V. The restriction
T|V : V →im T is continuous and bijective. It suﬃces to show that the inverse
(T|V)−1 : im T →V is bounded, because then im T is complete and hence closed.
Arguing by contradiction, we assume that (T|V)−1 is not bounded. This
means that for every ν ∈N there is a vν ∈V with ∥vν∥= 1 and ∥Tvν∥≤1/ν.
Since K is compact, after passing to a subsequence we may assume that Kvν →x
for some x ∈E. Since Tvν →0, this implies vν →x, hence x ∈V and ∥x∥= 1.
But Tx = limν→∞Tvν = 0, so also x ∈ker T, which is impossible.
(iii) coker T is ﬁnite-dimensional: By (ii) and Exercise V.1.16 we have
(coker T)∗∼= ker T ∗= ker(idE −K∗).
Since K∗is compact by Example V.1.14, the claim follows from (i).
□

V.1. Fredholm theory
133
The next proposition is known as the Atkinson characterisation of Fredholm
operators.
Proposition V.1.18. A bounded operator T : E →F is Fredholm if and only if T is
invertible modulo compact operators, i.e. there exist a bounded operator S : F →E
and compact operators KE and KF on E and F, respectively, such that
ST = idE −KE
and
TS = idF −KF.
Proof. If S, KE and KF exist as described, then ker T ⊂ker(idE −KE) is ﬁnite-
dimensional by Lemma V.1.17. Similarly, from im(idF −KF) ⊂im T, we see that
dim coker T < ∞.
Conversely, if T is Fredholm, we can choose closed complements of ker T and
im T, that is,
E = ker T ⊕V
and
F = im T ⊕W.
The restriction T|V is an isomorphism onto im T, and the operator
S :=
( T|V
−1
on im T,
0
on W
is continuous by the open mapping theorem.
Exercise V.1.19. Verify that
(i) TST = T and STS = S;
(ii) KE := idE −ST is a projection operator onto ker T, and KF := idF −TS is a
projection operator onto W.
♦
As bounded operators with ﬁnite-dimensional image, KE and KF are com-
pact. This concludes the proof of the proposition.
□
Exercise V.1.20. Let T : E →F and S : F →G be bounded linear operators.
(a) Show that the sequences
0 −→ker T −→ker ST
T

im T
−→
F
im T

im S −→0,
where the unlabelled maps are the obvious inclusions or projections, are

(b) Now suppose that two of T, S and ST are Fredholm operators. Use (a) to
show that the third operator is then likewise Fredholm, and
ind ST = ind S + ind T.
♦

134
Chapter V. Transversality
Exercise V.1.21. Let T : E →F be a bounded operator with closed image. Consider
the exact sequence
0 −→ker T −→E
T
−→F −→coker T −→0
of Banach spaces.
(a) Use the Hahn–Banach theorem to show that the dual sequence
0 −→(coker T)∗−→F∗
T ∗
−→E∗−→(ker T)∗−→0
is likewise exact, and infer that T ∗also has closed image. In particular, this
means that
ker(T ∗) ∼= (coker T)∗
and
coker(T ∗) ∼= (ker T)∗.
(b) Conclude that if T is Fredholm, then so is T ∗, with ind T ∗= −ind T.
♦
In preparation of the next lemma, we recall the following facts.
Note V.1.22. Any bijective continuous linear operator has a continuous inverse
by the open mapping theorem. The subset of such invertible bounded operators
E →F in the space of all bounded operators is open. Indeed, if T : E →F is
invertible, then for ∥S∥< ∥T −1∥−1, an explicit inverse of T −S = T(idE −T −1S)
is given by the geometric series P∞
k=0(T −1S)kT −1.
Lemma V.1.23. The set of Fredholm operators is an open subset in the space of
all bounded linear operators E →F, and the index is constant on the connected
components of this subset.
Proof. Let T : E →F be a Fredholm operator. Write E = ker T ⊕V and F =
im T ⊕W as above. Let I : V →E be the inclusion, and P : F →im T the
projection deﬁned by the splitting of F.
Now, any bounded operator S : E →F gives rise to an operator S′ :=
PSI : V →im T. Since T ′ := T|V : V →im T is an isomorphism, by Note V.1.22
the same will hold for S′, provided that ∥S −T∥is suﬃciently small. This proves
the ﬁrst statement.
For the statement about indices, we may interpret such an S′ = PSI (with
S suﬃciently close to T) as a Fredholm operator of index 0. Since P and I are
Fredholm operators, so is S (apply Exercise V.1.20 (b) twice), and
0 = ind PSI = ind P + ind S + ind I = dim coker T + ind S −dim ker T,
whence ind S = ind T, so the index is a locally constant function on the space of
Fredholm operators.
□
Finally, we arrive at the proposition that will allow us to reduce the claim
that ∂+ C is Fredholm to showing that ∂is Fredholm.

V.1. Fredholm theory

Proposition V.1.24. Let T, K : E →F be a Fredholm and a compact operator,
respectively. Then, T + K is Fredholm with ind(T + K) = ind T.
Proof. Choose S, KE, KF as in the Atkinson characterisation of T being Fredholm.
The operator S also does the trick for T + K, since
idE −S(T + K) = KE −SK
and
idF −(T + K)S = KF −KS
are compact operators by Exercise V.1.13.
The statement about indices follows from the preceding lemma, applied to
the family T + tK, t ∈[0, 1], of Fredholm operators.
□
Exercise V.1.25. Show that a Fredholm operator T has ind T = 0 if and only if it
can be written as T = T0 + K with T0 invertible and K compact.

Recall that the map C deﬁned in equation (V.2) is a matrix-valued map
on D of class Lp, and the corresponding operator V p →Lp(D, Cn) is deﬁned by
Cη =

 η(z)
	
.
Lemma V.1.26. The multiplication operator C : V p →Lp(D, Cn) is compact.
Proof. By the Sobolev embedding theorem, we have a compact embedding V p →
C0(D, Cn), and the multiplication operator C may be regarded as a linear op-
erator C0(D, Cn) →Lp(D, Cn) bounded by ∥C∥Lp. In other words, we have the
factorisation
C : V p −→C0(D, Cn)
C
−→Lp(D, Cn).
As the composition of a compact and a bounded linear operator, C is compact.

Note V.1.27. This reduces the proof of Theorem V.1.5 to showing that ∂is a
Fredholm operator of index n −1.

∂(2). Theorem V.1.5 is then, by Note V.1.27, a consequence of the next proposition.
In the proof it is understood that we always work with the unique continuous
representative of any element in V p

Chapter V. Transversality
Proposition V.1.28.
(a) ∂(2) is surjective, with ker ∂(2) = R given by the constant
(real-valued) functions.
(b) ∂(1) is invertible.
Proof. (a0) Any η ∈V p
2 with ∂η = 0 is smooth (and holomorphic on B1 = Int(D))
by elliptic regularity (Theorem IV.3.1). The real boundary values of η allow us to
extend η by Schwarz reﬂection to a holomorphic function on ˆC, which must be
constant by the maximum principle. (Alternatively, apply the maximum principle
directly to the harmonic function Im η.) This proves that ker ∂(2) = R.
The surjectivity of ∂(2) will be proved in three steps.
(a1) There is a constant c such that
∥η∥1,p ≤c
 ∥∂η∥Lp + ∥η∥Lp
for all η ∈V p
2 .
(V.3)
(a2) The image of ∂(2) is closed in Lp(D, C).
(a3) The image of ∂(2) contains the space C∞
c (B1, C) of smooth functions on D
compactly supported in the interior of D.
The estimate in (a1) is known as a semi-Fredholm estimate, for as we shall see
it leads directly to statement (a2), which together with the ﬁnite-dimensionality
of ker ∂(2) is known as the semi-Fredholm property. Since C∞
c (B1, C) is dense in
Lp(D, C), the surjectivity of ∂(2) follows from (a2) and (a3). For a proof that
C0
c (B1, C) is dense in Lp(D, C), see [Adams & Fournier 2003, Theorem 2.19]; then
the density of C∞
c (B1, C) follows from the Stone–Weierstraß approximation theo-
rem, or see [Adams & Fournier 2003, Corollary 2.30].
Proof of (a1)
The real and imaginary part of η can be approximated separately (in the (1, p)-
norm) by smooth functions (Theorem IV.2.10) and smooth functions compactly
supported in the interior of D (Proposition IV.2.23), respectively. In particular,
this means that η can be approximated by smooth complex-valued functions taking
real values on ∂D. It therefore suﬃces to prove (V.3) for smooth functions η in V p
2 .
Choose a smooth bump function f0 : B2 →[0, 1] that is identically equal to
1 near ∂D and supported in a thin annulus around it. Extend a given smooth η by
Schwarz reﬂection in the unit circle (cf. Exercise IV.3.15 and Remark II.1.6) to a
function ˆη ∈W 1,p(B2, C) (or even on ˆC, if you wish). In the following estimates,
norms where the domain is not speciﬁed refer to functions on D. We estimate f0η
and (1 −f0)η separately. Compare the estimate for f0η with the argument on
page 83.

Proof of (a2)
Let υ ∈Lp(D, C) be a function in the closure of im ∂(2), that is, there is a sequence
(ην) in V p
2 with ∂ην →υ. We need to show that υ ∈im ∂(2).
Since ∂ην remains unaltered when we add a real constant to ην, we may
assume that ην(1) = 0. We claim that with this assumption the sequence (ην) is
bounded.
Arguing by contradiction, if the sequence were unbounded, we would have
(after passing to a subsequence) ∥ην∥1,p > ν for all ν ∈N. Consider the sequence
of normalised functions η1
ν := ην/∥ην∥1,p in V p
2 . This satisﬁes
∥∂η1
ν∥Lp = ∥∂ην∥Lp
∥ην∥1,p
< ∥∂ην∥Lp
ν
−→0
as ν →∞,
since the sequence
 ∥∂ην∥Lp
is convergent and hence bounded. Moreover, the
inclusion V p
2 →C0(D, C) →Lp(D, C) is compact as the composition of a compact
and a bounded3 linear map, so (again after passing to a subsequence) there is
an η1 ∈Lp(D, C) with ∥η1
ν −η1∥Lp →0. Thus, both (∂η1
ν) and (η1
ν) are Cauchy
sequences in Lp(D, C).
By the semi-Fredholm estimate (V.3), (η1
ν) is a Cauchy sequence in the space
W 1,p(D, C), so the limit η1 is actually of class W 1,p, hence lies in V p
2 , and satisﬁes
∂η1 = 0. By (a0), η1 must be a constant function, but then the obvious limit
properties ∥η1∥1,p = 1 and η1(1) = 0 are contradictory.
This contradiction shows that (ην) is indeed bounded. By the same argument
as for (η1
ν), we now conclude that (a subsequence of) (ην) converges in the (1, p)-
norm to a function η ∈V p
2 . This function satisﬁes ∂η = limν→∞∂ην = υ (in Lp),
so υ ∈im ∂(2).
3The inclusion map C0(D, C) →Lp(D, C) is bounded by the area π of D, since ∥η∥Lp ≤
π∥η∥C0.

Chapter V. Transversality
Proof of (a3)
Given f ∈C∞
c (B1, C), we want to ﬁnd an η ∈V p
2 with ∂η = f. As we shall see,
this η can be constructed in C∞(D, C).
The M¨obius transformation ϕ: z 7→i 1+z
1−z of ˆC restricts to a conformal identi-
ﬁcation D →ˆH; cf. Exercise II.2.13. In order to avoid the points ∞in domain and
image, we regard ϕ as a map C \ {1} →C \ {−i}, and its restriction D \ {1} →H,
with limz→1 ϕ(z) = ∞.
Deﬁne
h := f
ϕx
◦ϕ−1|H ∈C∞
c (Int(H), C),
(V.4)
and also write h for the function in C∞
c (C, C) obtained by Schwarz reﬂection. By
Proposition III.1.7, there is a unique function κ ∈C∞(C, C) with
∂κ = h
and
lim
w→∞κ(w) = 0.
Exercise V.1.29. Set λ = c◦κ◦c, where c denotes complex conjugation on C. Show
that limz→∞λ(z) = 0 and, using the fact that c◦h◦c = h (by construction), verify
that ∂λ = h. Then use the uniqueness of κ to conclude that κ(R) ⊂R.
♦
The chain rule for the Wirtinger derivative, which the avid reader elaborated
in Exercise III.1.22, says that for η := κ ◦ϕ: C \ {1} →C we have
ηz = (κ ◦ϕ)z = (κw ◦ϕ)ϕz + (κw ◦ϕ)ϕz = (κw ◦ϕ)∂ϕ
∂z = (κw ◦ϕ)ϕx,
where in the penultimate equality we have used the holomorphicity of ϕ (Exer-
cise III.1.22 (c)) and an identity from Exercise III.1.22 (d); the equality ∂ϕ
∂z = ϕx
is a straightforward computation. It follows that
∂η = (∂κ ◦ϕ)ϕx = (h ◦ϕ)ϕx
on C \ {1}.
(V.5)
By the deﬁnition (V.4) of h on H, this gives the desired solution ∂η = f on
D \ {1}. But this function h is compactly supported in the interior of H, and so
the function h on C obtained by Schwarz reﬂection vanishes in a neighbourhood of
R ∪{∞} ⊂ˆC. But then equation (V.5) says that η is holomorphic on an annulus
around ∂D, with the point 1 removed. Since limz→1 η(z) = limw→∞κ(w) = 0,
the Riemann removable singularities theorem allows us to extend η smoothly to a
function on C by setting η(1) = 0. The equation ∂η = f holds on D by continuity.
(b) To show that ∂(1) is invertible, we establish the following points:
(b1) ∂(1) is injective.
(b2) The image of ∂(1) is closed in Lp(D, C).
(b3) The image of ∂(1) contains the space C∞
c (B1 \ {0}, C).

V.1. Fredholm theory
139
Part (b2) is proved by the same semi-Fredholm estimate as in (a2). Together with
(b3), the surjectivity of ∂(1) follows as in (a). Thus, it remains to demonstrate
(b1) and (b3).
Proof of (b1)
As in (a0) we see by elliptic regularity that an η ∈V p
1 with ∂η = 0 is holomorphic
on B1. The arguments of Section IV.3 also apply to the function z 7→η(z)/z —
which is deﬁned on D \ {0} and has real boundary values along ∂D — to show
that η extends smoothly to ∂D. Thus, on B1 we may write η as a power series
η(z) = P∞
k=0 akzk with (for any 0 < r < 1)
ak =

η(eiθ)e−ikθ dθ;
the passage to the limit is allowed thanks to η being continuous on D. Thus, the
ak are actually the Fourier coeﬃcients in the Fourier series expansion of η|∂D.
Notice that for negative integers k, the Fourier coeﬃcients are zero by the Cauchy
integral theorem.
Since η|∂D is smooth, the Fourier series of η converges uniformly to η, so we
have
η(eiθ) =
∞
X
k=0
akeikθ,
θ ∈R/2πZ.
The property η(eiθ) ∈eiθR gives us the identity
eiθ η(eiθ) = e−iθ η(eiθ),
which translates into
∞
X
k=0
ak ei(1−k)θ =
∞
X
k=0
ak ei(k−1)θ.
By comparing coeﬃcients, we see that a0 = a2, a1 = a1, and ak = 0 for k ≥3, so
we may write η as
η(z) = (α + iβ)z2 + γz + α −iβ
with α, β, γ ∈R.
When we want to prescribe values η(ik) ∈ikR, k ∈{0, 1, 2}, we need to solve the
(real!) linear system

(V.6)
This system has a unique solution for any prescribed values of η at 1, i, −1, and
the three-point condition η(1) = η(i) = η(−1) = 0 for elements of V p
2 yields
α = β = γ = 0.

140
Chapter V. Transversality
Proof of (b3)
Given f ∈C∞
c (B1\{0}, C), we wish to ﬁnd an η1 ∈V p
1 with ∂η1 = f. The function
g: D →C deﬁned by
g(z) :=
(
f(z)/z
for z ∈D \ {0},
0
for z = 0,
is an element of C∞
c (B1, C), and by (a3) there is a solution ζ ∈V p
2 of the equation
∂ζ = g. Set η(z) = zζ(z). Then, η satisﬁes the boundary condition η(eiθ) ∈eiθR,
and
∂η(z) = z∂ζ(z) = zg(z) = f(z).
Next, set η0(z) = (α + iβ)z2 + γz + α −iβ, where (α, β, γ) ∈R3 is the unique
solution of (V.6). Then, η1 := η −η0 ∈V p
1 , and ∂η1 = f.

V.2
Regular values and the Sard–Smale theorem
Ultimately, we want to use the description of the moduli space as
M = {u ∈B: ∂Ju = 0}
(cf. Section IV.3.1) to establish its being a manifold.
Recall the situation in ﬁnite dimensions. Given a smooth function f =
(f1, . . . , fn): Rm →Rn, the zero set M0 = {f1 = . . . = fn = 0} ⊂Rm is a sub-
manifold of codimension n (or empty), provided that the gradients ∇f1, . . . , ∇fn
are linearly independent at all points of M0. This condition is equivalent to saying
that the diﬀerential Tpf is surjective at all points p ∈M0 = f −1(0).
More generally, given a smooth map f : M →N between ﬁnite-dimensional
manifolds, a point q ∈N is called a regular value of f if Tpf is surjective for all
p ∈f −1(q) =: Mq. In this case, Mq ⊂M is empty or a submanifold of codimension
equal to dim N.
Even more generally, if Q ⊂N is a submanifold and f : M →N a map
transverse to Q in the sense that Tpf(TpM) + TqQ = TqN for all q ∈Q and
p ∈f −1(q), then f −1(Q) ⊂M is a submanifold of codimension equal to the
codimension of Q in N.
Even though we shall only be considering the preimage of a single point (see
Section V.2.4 for an outline of the further strategy), this discussion goes by the
name of ‘transversality’ to avoid confusion with the other meaning of ‘regularity’
in Chapter IV.

manifolds, provided that one has an adequate splitting of the domain (or its tan-
gent space, in the case of Banach manifolds) into a direct sum of closed (and hence
complete normed) spaces — the reason being that the proof in ﬁnite dimensions
carries over to inﬁnite dimensions if one can still rely on the Banach ﬁxed point
theorem (a.k.a. the contraction mapping theorem).
Theorem V.2.1. Let E1, E2, F be Banach spaces and k ∈N. Suppose we have an
open set U ⊂E1 ⊕E2 containing the point (x0
1, x0
2), and a Ck-map f : U →F such
that
(i) f(x0
1, x0
2) = 0;
(ii) D2f(x0

2) := D
 f(x0


(x0
2): E2 →F is a bounded invertible linear op-
erator.
Then there is an open neighbourhood U1 × U2 ⊂E1 ⊕E2 of (x0
1, x0
2) and a unique
continuous map g: U1 →U2 such that

(x1, x2) ∈U1 × U2 : f(x1, x2) = 0
	
=

(x1, g(x1)): x1 ∈U1
	
.
Moreover, this map g is of class Ck.
□
V.2.2
Regular values
In inﬁnite dimensions, the deﬁnition of regular values takes the assumptions of the
inﬁnite-dimensional implicit function theorem into account.
Deﬁnition V.2.2. Let f : M →N be a C1-map between Banach manifolds. A
point q ∈N is a regular value of f if for all p ∈f −1(q) the following conditions
are satisﬁed:
(R1)
Tpf : TpM →TqN is surjective.
(R2)
ker(Tpf) has a closed complement in the Banach space TpM.
As in ﬁnite dimensions, the preimage f −1(q) of a regular value q ∈N of f is
empty or a Banach submanifold of M. The tangent space to this submanifold at
p ∈f −1(q) is ker(Tpf).
Note V.2.3. If ker(Tpf) is ﬁnite-dimensional (so in particular if Tpf is a Fredholm
operator), condition (R2) is automatically satisﬁed by Note V.1.15. The compo-
nent of f −1(q) containing p is then a manifold of dimension equal to dim ker(Tpf).
Lemma V.2.4. If condition (R1) in Deﬁnition V.2.2 is satisﬁed, condition (R2) is
equivalent to the existence of a right-inverse to Tpf, that is, a bounded linear map
R: TqN →TpM such that
Tpf ◦R = idTqN,
and with R(TqN) ⊂TpM a closed subspace.

142
Chapter V. Transversality
Proof. Suppose condition (R2) is satisﬁed, i.e. there is a closed subspace C ⊂
TpM complementary to ker(Tpf). Then, Tpf|C : C →TqN is bijective, and hence
invertible by the open mapping theorem. Set R :=
 Tpf|C
−1.
Conversely, if a right-inverse R with the described properties exists, then
R(TqN) is a complementary subspace to ker(Tpf). Notice that any v ∈TpM can
be written as
v =
 v −(R ◦Tpf)(v)

+ (R ◦Tpf)(v) ∈ker(Tpf) ⊕im R.
The sum is direct, for if v ∈ker(Tpf) ∩im R, write v = R(w) and observe that
0 = Tpf(v) = (Tpf ◦R)(w) = w, hence v = 0.
□
V.2.3
The Sard–Smale theorem
Sard’s theorem says that the set of regular values of a C∞-map f : M →N be-
tween ﬁnite-dimensional manifolds is dense in N; in fact, its complement of critical
values is of measure zero [Milnor 1965]. An inﬁnite-dimensional version of this the-
orem for Fredholm maps between separable Banach manifolds was established by
[Smale 1965].
Deﬁnition V.2.5. A C1-map f : M →N between Banach manifolds is called a
Fredholm map if the diﬀerential Tpf : TpM →Tf(p)N is a Fredholm operator for
all p ∈M.
Remark V.2.6. If the index ind(Tpf) is independent of the choice of p ∈M, we
call this the index of f and write ind(f). For instance, by Lemma V.1.23 this will
be the case when M is connected. In our application, we shall prove directly that
the pointwise index is constant.
Theorem V.2.7 (Smale). Let f : M →N be a C∞Fredholm map between Banach
manifolds, with M separable. Then the regular values of f are dense in N.
Smale actually shows that the set of regular values is residual in N, that is,
it contains a countable intersection of sets that are open and dense in N.
Exercise V.2.8. Show that any countable intersection of residual subsets of a given
topological space is again residual; this is often important when one deals with a
succession of constraints.
♦
A Baire space is a topological space in which every residual set is dense.
Exercise V.2.9. Show that every complete metric space is a Baire space.
♦
Note V.2.10. If q ∈N is a regular value of a smooth Fredholm map f : M →N,
with M connected, then f −1(q) ⊂M is a manifold of dimension equal to ind(f)
(or empty).
Smale formulates the theorem for Banach manifolds with a countable base
of the topology (i.e. second-countable spaces). This is equivalent to separability,
as the next exercise shows.

V.2. Regular values and the Sard–Smale theorem
143
Exercise V.2.11. Show that a metric space has a countable base of the topology
if and only if it has a countable dense subset.
♦
We do not present a complete proof of Smale’s theorem. Rather, we encour-
age the reader to take a look at Smale’s beautiful short paper, where this proof
covers a mere two pages. The separability of M and the fact (proved in Smale’s
paper) that Fredholm maps are locally proper4 are used to reduce the proof to
a local statement. The next exercise, whose solution is analogous to the proof of
the implicit function theorem (or the equivalent inverse function theorem), then
reduces the problem to the ﬁnite-dimensional situation.
Exercise V.2.12. Let f : M →N be a C1 Fredholm map. Show that for any p ∈M
there are charts (U, φ) around p and (V, ψ) around f(p) such that ψ ◦f ◦φ−1 is of
the form
E ⊕ker(Tpf)
−→
E ⊕coker(Tpf)
(x, y)
7−→
 x, g(x, y)

,
where E is a Banach space, and g is a C1-map.
♦
Notice that (x, z) is a regular value of the map (x, y) 7→
 x, g(x, y)

if and
only if z is a regular value of g|{x}×ker(Tpf). Thus, Sard’s theorem allows us to ﬁnd
a regular value of f in any given neighbourhood of any f(p), p ∈M. This shows
that the regular values of f lie dense. With the separability of M and the local
properness of f one concludes that the set of regular values is actually residual.
Here is a simple example, found by [Bonic 1966], illustrating the fact that
the Fredholm property is essential in the Sard–Smale theorem. Earlier, a more
involved example of this phenomenon was described by [Kupka 1965].
Exercise V.2.13. Let E be the space of real-valued continuous functions x: t 7→
x(t) on the interval [0, 1]. With the C0-norm, E is a Banach space. We consider
the map f : E →E given by f(x) = x3.
(a) Show that f is of class C∞, and compute its derivatives.
(b) Why is f not a Fredholm map?
(c) Show that x ∈E is a critical point of f, i.e. a point where Txf violates (R1)
or (R2), if and only if x has a zero, and it is an interior point of the set of
critical points if and only if x changes sign.
(d) Observe that f sends the set of critical points onto itself, and it sends the
interior of that set onto the interior. Conclude that the image of the set of
critical points contains an open set.
♦
4Smale calls a map locally proper if any point in the domain of deﬁnition has a neighbourhood
on which the map is proper. (Beware that there are variants of this deﬁnition.)

How to prove that M is a manifold
When we choose any J as in Lemma I.7.17, the nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann op-
erator ∂J : B →Lp(D, R2n) is a Fredholm map by Theorem V.1.5, so if 0 were
a regular value of this map, we would have succeeded in showing that M is a
manifold. Unfortunately, 0 is not, in general, a regular value of ∂J for an arbitrary
choice of J.
The idea now is to regard the nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann operator with
varying J as a map on the product space B × J , where J is a suitable space of
almost complex structures as in Lemma I.7.17.
We may not allow all such structures, for then J would not be a separable
Banach manifold. On the other hand, the space J needs to be suﬃciently large
such that the operator
∂• :
B × J
−→
Lp(D, R2n)
(u, J)
7−→
∂Ju
has zero as a regular value. Then, ker ∂• ⊂B×J is a (separable) Banach manifold.
In Section V.5 we shall use a norm concept introduced by Floer to describe
such a separable space J of almost complex structures. The operator ∂• will be
analysed in Section V.6.
Finally, in Section V.7 we apply the Sard–Smale theorem to the projection
pJ : ker ∂• →J onto the second factor. Notice that for any J, the ﬁbre p−1
J (J)
contains ﬂat discs, so it is non-empty. Any regular value J of pJ then yields
a moduli space MJ = ker ∂J that is a Banach manifold. The set of such J is
residual (and in particular dense) in J . This is the meaning of ‘generic J’ in
Theorem I.8.13.
First, though, we have to deal with some local properties of J-holomorphic
discs that are relevant to this line of reasoning.
V.3
The Carleman similarity principle
The aim of this section is to analyse the local behaviour (around interior points
of D) of elements of the moduli space M. The boundary behaviour of the holomor-
phic discs is irrelevant for this local discussion, so we shall be making statements
about arbitrary solutions of the nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann equation ∂Ju = 0.
In the form stated below (Theorem V.3.3), you will not ﬁnd the similarity
principle in the work of Carleman. However, some of the central ideas can be traced
back via the work of [Vekua 1962] and [Bers 1956] to the paper [Carleman 1933].
V.3.1
Behaviour near the boundary
First, though, we recall what has been established so far about the local behaviour
of holomorphic discs in M. By Lemma II.1.17, any u ∈M sends the interior of

V.3. The Carleman similarity principle
145
D into the open cylinder Z; in particular, the image of Int(D) under u is disjoint
from u(∂D). Furthermore, by Lemma II.1.18, the restriction u|∂D is an embedding
∂D →∂Z.
Exercise V.3.1. Use Lemma II.1.18 (and its proof) and the classical maximum
principle to show that for each u ∈M there is a neighbourhood U ⊂D of ∂D such
that u|U is an embedding, and u(U) ∩u(D \ U) = ∅.
♦
V.3.2
From a nonlinear to a linear equation
Let J be an almost complex structure on R2n = Cn. We ﬁx a solution u ∈
C∞(D, Cn) of the nonlinear Cauchy–Riemann equation ∂Ju = 0. By the argument
on page 84 following Exercise III.3.6, there is a smooth map A: Cn →GL(2n, R)
such that (with Ap := A(p) as on page 84)
ApJ(p) = J0Ap
for all p ∈Cn.
(V.7)
Set v := (A ◦u)u: D →Cn. Using (V.7) and ∂Ju = 0, we compute
∂v = ∂(A ◦u)u + (A ◦u)∂Ju = ∂(A ◦u) · (A ◦u)−1v.
Thus, with the matrix-valued function
B := −∂(A ◦u) · (A ◦u)−1 : D −→R2n×2n
we recognise v as a solution of the linear equation
∂v + Bv = 0.
(V.8)
This may look to you like a conjurer’s trick. Bear in mind, though, that we have
arrived at this linear equation for v = (A ◦u)u only after restricting our attention
to a single solution u of the nonlinear equation ∂Ju = 0.
Remark V.3.2. Likewise, for a ﬁxed u and with J(z) := J(u(z)) (cf. Notation
V.1.8), one may regard u as a solution of the linear equation
ux(z) + J(z)uy(z) = 0.
V.3.3
The similarity principle and its corollaries
The Carleman similarity principle says, in essence, that locally a solution of the
linear equation (V.8) looks, up to a pointwise linear transformation of the tangent
bundle of R2n = Cn, like a holomorphic map. Even though this transformation
is only continuous, the similarity principle allows one to carry over results from
complex analysis about the local behaviour of holomorphic functions, such as the
identity theorem, to J-holomorphic curves.

146
Chapter V. Transversality
Theorem V.3.3 (Carleman Similarity Principle). Let G ⊂C be a domain contain-
ing the origin 0, and v: G →R2n = Cn a smooth solution of ∂v + Bv = 0, where
B is a smooth map G →GL(2n, R). Then there is an ε > 0 such that Bε := Bε(0)
is contained in G, a continuous map
Φ: Bε −→GL(n, C),
and a holomorphic map
h: Bε −→Cn
such that v = Φh on Bε.
Applied to v := (A ◦u)u on G = B1 := Int(D), this theorem tells us that
u = (A ◦u)−1Φh =: Ψh
is of similar form around z0 = 0, but notice that the function Ψ on Bε takes values
in GL(2n, R). By precomposing u with a conformal automorphism of B1 before
applying the similarity principle, one arrives at the same description around any
point z0 ∈B1.
Before we turn to the proof of theorem V.3.3, we record two corollaries one
obtains by applying it to v = (A ◦u)u.
Corollary V.3.4. Given u ∈M, for any p ∈R2n the preimage u−1(p) is a ﬁnite
set.
Proof. Arguing by contradiction, we assume that there is a p0 ∈R2n for which
{u−1(p0)} ⊂D is an inﬁnite set. Then this set has an accumulation point z0 ∈D.
In fact, by Exercise V.3.1, we must have {u−1(p0)} ⊂Int(D) = B1 and z0 ∈B1.
Now apply Theorem V.3.3 to the translated map z 7→u(z) −p0, which is
Jp0-holomorphic for Jp0(p) := J(p + p0). This tells us that u −p0 = Ψh in a
neighbourhood of z0, and z0 is an accumulation point of zeros of the holomorphic
map h. From the identity theorem it follows that h ≡0, and hence u ≡p0 in a
neighbourhood of z0 ∈B1.
Now consider the non-empty set
{z ∈B1 : u ≡p0 in a neighbourhood of z},
which is open by deﬁnition. Our argument above shows that this set is closed in
B1, so it must be all of B1, which by continuity5 means that u ∈M is constant
equal to p0 on all of D, an obvious contradiction.
□
Corollary V.3.5. Any u ∈M has a ﬁnite set of critical points
Crit(u) := {z ∈D: Tzu = 0}.
Hence, by the preceding corollary, the set u−1 u(Crit(u)

of points in D mapping
to a critical value is likewise ﬁnite.
5Or use Exercise V.3.1 once more to arrive at a contradiction.

V.3. The Carleman similarity principle
147
Proof. Again we argue by contradiction. Thus, suppose a given u has an inﬁnite
set of critical points. Then, Crit(u) has an accumulation point z0 ∈D; in fact, by
Exercise V.3.1 this point z0 must lie in B1.
By diﬀerentiating the equation ∂Ju = 0 with respect to the variable x, we
obtain
uxx + J(u)uyx + DJ(u)(ux)uy = 0.
Set v := ux, C = DJ(u)( . )uy, and J = J ◦u (by abuse of notation). Then this
equation becomes
vx + Jvy + Cv = 0.
For w := (A ◦u)v we compute
∂w = ∂(A ◦u)v + (A ◦u)∂Jv =
 ∂(A ◦u) −(A ◦u)C

(A ◦u)−1w,
so again we are in the setting of the Carleman similarity principle. We conclude
that v is of the form v = Ψh around z0, with z0 being an accumulation point of
zeros of the holomorphic map h. Again by the identity theorem we conclude that
ux = v ≡0 and uy = −J(u)ux ≡0 in a neighbourhood of z0, which means that u
is constant on that neighbourhood, contradicting the previous corollary.
□
V.3.4
Proof of the Carleman similarity principle
By assumption of Theorem V.3.3, we have a smooth function B on G taking
values in the space of real (2n × 2n)-matrices, or the real linear endomorphisms
EndR(Cn), and a smooth solution v: G →Cn of (V.8), that is, ∂v + Bv = 0.
Replace B by a map taking values in EndC(Cn)
As a ﬁrst step, we want to replace B in (V.8) by a map taking values in the
complex linear endomorphisms EndC(Cn) of Cn. With
B± := 1
2(B ∓J0BJ0)
we can write B = B+ + B−with B+(z) a complex linear endomorphism of Cn for
all z ∈G, and B−(z) a complex anti-linear one, since
B+J0 = J0B+ and B−J0 = −J0B−.
Now deﬁne C : G →EndR(Cn) by
C(z)(ζ) =



v(z)t ζ
|v(z)|2 v(z)
if v(z) ̸= 0,
0
if v(z) = 0.

148
Chapter V. Transversality
The map G ∋z 7→C(z) ∈EndR(Cn) is smooth on the open set {z ∈G: v(z) ̸= 0}.
By construction, C(z) is complex anti-linear for every z ∈G, we have Cv = v,
and the operator norm of C(z) satisﬁes
|C(z)| =
(
1
if v(z) ̸= 0,
0
if v(z) = 0.
Thus, we have C ∈L∞ G, EndR(Cn)

, and the essential supremum ∥C∥L∞(G) of
this map equals 1, unless v is identically equal to zero.
The composition of two complex anti-linear endomorphisms is complex linear,
so we obtain a map
B′ := B+ + B−C ∈L∞ G, EndC(Cn)

.
Since Cv = v, this map satisﬁes B′v = Bv.
From now on, we write again B for this new map B′. Thus, we have replaced
B in (V.8) by a map taking values in EndC(Cn), at the price of this map being
only of class L∞.
An equation on the transformation Φ
By reverse engineering we ﬁrst derive an equation on the sought-after transforma-
tion Φ, which we subsequently use to ﬁnd this transformation.
Suppose we have written v as v = Φh on Bε, with Φ and h as described in
Theorem V.3.3. Then, on Bε,
0 = ∂v + Bv = ∂(Φh) + BΦh = (∂Φ + BΦ)h + Φ∂h,
where we have used the C-linearity of Φ(z). Notice that having arranged B to take
values in EndC(Cn) allows us to regard BΦ as a map of the same kind. If we can
ﬁnd a map Φ (taking values in GL(n, C)) satisfying the equation ∂Φ + BΦ = 0,
we shall be able to conclude that ∂h = 0, i.e. that h is holomorphic.
Remark V.3.6. As we shall see presently, the map Φ can be chosen to be of
class W 1,p. Then, h := Φ−1v is likewise of class W 1,p. A solution h of class W 1,p
of the equation ∂h = 0 is smooth by elliptic regularity (Theorem IV.3.1). For
the linear Cauchy–Riemann operator we are dealing with here, this regularity
result follows much more directly from the Weyl lemma. We shall discuss this in
Section V.6.3.
Since ε is not known a priori, we start (without loss of generality, really)
with B being deﬁned on the open unit disc B1, and study the equation
∂Φ + χεBΦ = 0,
(V.9)
where χε denotes the characteristic function of Bε, on a suitable Sobolev space
of maps Φ: B1 →EndC(Cn). Our aim will be to show that, for ε > 0 suﬃciently

V.3. The Carleman similarity principle
149
small, a solution Φ does indeed exist, and that it actually takes values in GL(n, C).
Restricted to Bε, this deﬁnes a solution of the original equation ∂Φ + BΦ = 0.
The key, then, is to appeal to the surjectivity of ∂, when regarded as an
operator between suitable spaces, as established in Proposition V.1.28 (a). In fact,
we extend the image space and the map so as to obtain an invertible operator.
Subject to the additional constraints imposed by this extension, we ultimately ﬁnd
a unique solution Φ of (V.9) for ε suﬃciently small.
Solving equation (V.9)
We identify EndC(Cn) with the space Cn×n of complex (n × n)-matrices. This
contains the subspace Rn×n of real (n × n)-matrices. Now deﬁne, for some p > 2,
the real Banach spaces
V p :=

Φ ∈W 1,p(D, Cn×n): Φ(∂D) ⊂Rn×n	
⊂C0(D, Cn×n)
and
Lp := Lp(D, Cn×n),
and consider the linear operator, for ε ∈(0, 1),
Tε :
V p
−→
Lp ⊕Rn×n
Φ
7−→
 ∂Φ + χεBΦ, Φ(1)

The operator ∂: V p →Lp is the multidimensional version of ∂(2) in Proposi-
tion V.1.28, so we infer that ∂: V p →Lp is surjective, with kernel equal to Rn×n
given by the constant real- and matrix-valued functions. It follows that the oper-
ator
T :
V p
−→

Φ

 ∂Φ, Φ(1)

is bijective. This operator T is bounded:
∥TΦ∥Lp⊕Rn×n = ∥∂Φ∥Lp + |Φ(1)| ≤∥Φ∥1,p + ∥Φ∥C0 ≤const. ∥Φ∥1,p,
where the last inequality comes from the Sobolev embedding theorem (Theo-
rem IV.2.12). By the open mapping theorem, T is invertible.
Similarly, for the operator χεB we have the estimate
∥χεBΦ∥Lp ≤∥χε∥Lp · ∥B∥L∞· ∥Φ∥C0 ≤const. ε2/p ∥Φ∥1,p,
so the operator norm ∥χεB∥goes to zero as ε ↘0. Then, for ∥χεB∥< ∥T −1∥−1,
an explicit inverse of
Tε = T + χεB = T(idV p +T −1χεB)
is given by
T −1

Chapter V. Transversality
Hence, for ε > 0 suﬃciently small, we ﬁnd a unique solution Φ = Φε of the
equation TεΦ = (0, E), and in particular a solution of (V.9). Here, E denotes the
unit (n × n)-matrix and, below, the constant function D →Rn×n, z 7→E.
This solution Φ is of class W 1,p, and hence continuous by the Sobolev em-
bedding theorem.
The map Φ takes values in GL(n, C)
It remains to show that for ε > 0 suﬃciently small, Φ takes values in the invertible
matrices. We begin with the observation that ∥T −1
ε
∥→∥T −1∥as ε ↘0, so the
operator norm of T −1
ε
can be estimated by 2∥T −1∥, say, for ε small. Again using
the Sobolev embedding theorem, we ﬁnd

which goes to zero as ε ↘0, entailing the invertibility of Φ(z). In the third line
we have used
Tε(Φ −E) = (0, E) −
 ∂E + χεBE, E(1)

= (χεB, 0).
This concludes the proof of the Carleman similarity principle.
□
Exercise V.3.7.
(a) Show that the Carleman similarity principle also holds under
the weaker assumptions that B and v be merely of class W 1,p, p > 2. Observe
where in the argument you need the Banach algebra property of W 1,p.
(b) Prove the Carleman similarity principle for solutions of equations of the form
∂Jv + Bv = 0, now with Φ taking values in GL(2n, R). Analogous to the
discussion concerning B in Section V.3.2, we may assume that J = J(z).

V.4
Injective points
The concept of injective points of a holomorphic disc u, and the fact that they
constitute an open and dense subset of D, will enter crucially — in conjunction
with the Carleman similarity principle — in the proof that the Cauchy–Riemann
operator on the universal moduli space, which we are going to deﬁne in Section
V.6, has a surjective diﬀerential. This will allow us to conclude that the universal
moduli space is a manifold; see the proof of Proposition V.6.5.

V.4. Injective points
151
Let J be some almost complex structure on R2n, and u: D →R2n a J-
holomorphic disc.
Deﬁnition V.4.1. A point z ∈D is called an injective point of u if
Tzu ̸= 0
and
u−1 u(z)

= {z}.
The set of injective points of u is denoted by Inj(u). Below we shall frequently
appeal to the trivial observation that
u−1 u(z)

⊋{z}
for every z ∈D \
 Crit(u) ∪Inj(u)

.
Remark V.4.2. From Section V.3.1 it follows that for u ∈M there is a neighbour-
hood of ∂D consisting exclusively of injective points.
V.4.1
Inj(u) is open and dense
Here is a basic property of Inj(u).
Lemma V.4.3. The set Inj(u) ⊂D is open.
Proof. We want to show that D\Inj(u) is closed. Let (zν) be a sequence in D\Inj(u)
converging to z0 ∈D as ν →∞. If Tzνu = 0 for inﬁnitely many zν, then Tz0u = 0
by continuity, and hence z0 ∈D \ Inj(u).
Otherwise, we may assume that u−1 u(zν)

⊋{zν} for all ν ∈N, that is,
there are points wν ̸= zν such that u(wν) = u(zν), and by passing to a subsequence
we may assume that wν →w0 ∈D. Then
u(w0) = lim
ν→∞u(wν) = lim
ν→∞u(zν) = u(z0).
If w0 ̸= z0, then z0 ∈D \ Inj(u). If w0 = z0, then Tz0u = 0 (and again z0 ∈
D \ Inj(u)). Indeed, the J-holomorphicity of u means that if Tz0u ̸= 0, then it has
rank 2, and u is injective in a neighbourhood of z0, precluding the existence of the
two sequences (zν), (wν) with the described properties.
□
Here is the main result of this section.
Proposition V.4.4. For every u ∈M, the set Inj(u) is dense in D.
Proof. Arguing by contradiction, we assume that, for some u ∈M, the comple-
ment D\Inj(u) has an interior point z∗, which by Remark V.4.2 must lie in Int(D).
Thanks to Corollary V.3.5, we may assume that z∗̸∈u−1 u(Crit(u))

.
Choose a point z∂∈∂D such that the whole straight line segment [z∗, z∂] ⊂D
is disjoint from u−1 u(Crit(u))

; this, too, is possible by Corollary V.3.5. Let
P ⊂[z∗, z∂] be the set of points that have a neighbourhood in [z∗, z∂] consisting
entirely of non-injective points.
By construction, this set P is an open subset of [z∗, z∂], and it contains
the point z∗. We claim that it is also closed, and hence equals [z∗, z∂]. This, by
Remark V.4.2, is the desired contradiction.

152
Chapter V. Transversality
To prove the claim, we choose a point z0 ∈[z∗, z∂] in the closure of P, i.e.
we have a sequence (zν) in P converging to z0. Choose points wν ̸= zν in D with
u(wν) = u(zν). By passing to a subsequence, we may assume wν →w0 ∈D,
with u(w0) = u(z0). Since z0 is not critical by our choice of the line segment
[z∗, z∂], the map u is injective in a neighbourhood of z0, which implies w0 ̸= z0.
By Remark V.4.2, w0 lies in Int(D).
The lemma in the next section says that in this situation there are disjoint
open neighbourhoods U, V ⊂Int(D) of z0 and w0, respectively, such that u(U) =
u(V ). In particular, z0 has a neighbourhood of non-injective points in [z∗, z∂]. This
proves that z0 ∈P.
□
V.4.2
(Self-)Intersections of holomorphic discs
Observe that in the proof of Proposition V.4.4, the assumption
[z∗, z∂] ∩u−1 u(Crit(u))

= ∅
implies that Tw0u ̸= 0. This places us in the situation of the following lemma.
Lemma V.4.5. Let u: D →R2n be a J-holomorphic curve (for some almost com-
plex structure J on R2n). Assume that there are two distinct points z0, w0 ∈Int(D)
with
u(z0) = u(w0)
and
Tz0u ̸= 0, Tw0u ̸= 0.
Moreover, assume that there are sequences (zν) and (wν) in D converging to z0
and w0, respectively, with
u(zν) = u(wν) and wν ̸= w0
for all ν ∈N,
so that w0 is an accumulation point of double points. Then there are disjoint open
neighbourhoods U, V ⊂Int(D) of z0 and w0, respectively, and a biholomorphism
ψ: V →U such that u|V = u◦ψ. In particular, z0 has a neighbourhood consisting
entirely of non-injective points.
The proof of this lemma relies on a local normal form for J-holomorphic
curves near a noncritical point. We formulate this separately, because it is of
independent interest.
Lemma V.4.6. Let G ⊂C be a domain and u: G →R2n = Cn a J-holomorphic
curve. Let z0 ∈G be a point with Tz0u ̸= 0. (We may then shrink G such that u
is an embedding.) Then there is a diﬀeomorphism ϕ from a neighbourhood W of
(z0, 0) ∈C ⊕Cn−1 to a neighbourhood of u(z0) such that
W0 := W ∩

Then

∂yϕ(z, 0) = uy(z),
and
∂sjϕ(z, 0) = Xj(z),
∂tjϕ(z, 0) = J(u(z))Xj(z),
j = 2, . . . , n.
This means that the Jacobian of ϕ is of full rank at points (z, 0) ∈G × Cn−1.
It follows that ϕ is a diﬀeomorphism in a neighbourhood of (z0, 0). The equation
ϕ(z, 0) = u(z) is clear by construction.
Exercise V.4.7. Verify the equation J(u(z)) ◦T(z,0)ϕ = T(z,0)ϕ ◦J0.
♦
From this equation and the deﬁnition of Jϕ it is immediate that Jϕ(z, 0) =
J0. Moreover, Jϕ satisﬁes Jϕ ◦Tϕ−1 = Tϕ−1 ◦J, so the J-holomorphicity of u
(Tu ◦i = J ◦Tu) entails that v = ϕ−1 ◦u is Jϕ-holomorphic.
□
Proof of Lemma V.4.5. By Lemma V.4.6 we may assume (after replacing u with
ϕ−1 ◦u near z0, and J with Jϕ) that on a small open disc Bε(z0) ⊂Int(D) the
J-holomorphic curve
u = (u1, u): Bε(z0) −→C ⊕Cn−1
is of the form u(z) = (z, 0), and that J satisﬁes J|C⊕{0} = J0.
Since u(z0) = u(w0), we may likewise replace u near w0 with ϕ−1 ◦u. Again
we write u = (u1, u) (for the new u near w0). Then, by assumption, we have
u1(wν) = zν and u(wν) = 0
for all ν ∈N0.
Furthermore, the condition on J allows us to write, near w0,
J(u) −J0

J(u1, u) −J(u1, 0)
=
Z 1

D2J(u1, tu)(u) dt.
Here, D2 denotes the derivative with respect to the 2(n −1) real variables of the
Cn−1-factor; cf. Section IV.1.4. This means that D2J(u1, tu)(u) is a function on
D taking values in the linear space EndR(Cn). With the function
B :=
Z 1
0
D2J(u1, tu)( . ) dt

uy
on D, which takes values in the homomorphisms from R2n−2 to R2n, the J-
holomorphicity of u can be written as
0 = ux + J(u)uy = ux + J0uy + Bu.
(V.10)

V.5. The Floer space of almost complex structures
155
Write π2 for the projection from C ⊕Cn−1 onto the Cn−1-summand. By applying
π2 to this last equation, we obtain
∂u + π2Bu = 0,
which places us in the setting of the Carleman similarity principle.
The component u has an accumulation point of zeros in w0, and as in the
proof of Corollary V.3.4, one argues that u must be identically zero on a neigh-
bourhood V of w0. From (V.10) we then see that ∂u1 = 0 on V . The condi-
tions u1(w0) = z0 and Tw0u ̸= 0 guarantee that, possibly after making V a little
smaller, ψ := u1|V is a biholomorphism from V onto U := ψ(V ) ⊂Bε(z0). Since
u(z) = (z, 0) for z ∈Bε(z0), we then have
u|V = (u1, 0)|V = u ◦u1|V = u ◦ψ.
This proves Lemma V.4.5.
□
Exercise V.4.8.
(a) What can be concluded when the condition Tw0u ̸= 0 in
Lemma V.4.5 is dropped?
(b) Convince yourself that the lemma can be formulated for two J-holomorphic
curves u, v with u(z0) = v(w0), and the other conditions adapted accordingly.
This statement then says that intersection points of two locally distinct J-
holomorphic curves (i.e. curves that are not reparametrisations of each other)
can only accumulate at a point that is critical for both curves.

V.5. The Floer space of almost complex structures
157
V.5.2
A separable Banach space
Here is the main result of this section, concerning the properties of the Floer norm.
Proposition V.5.5. Let Ω⊂Rn be a bounded domain with smooth boundary ∂Ω.
(a) The normed vector space
 C∞
κ (Ω), ∥. ∥κ

is a separable Banach space.
(b) There is a sequence κ such that C∞
κ (Ω) lies dense in C∞
0 (Ω, R) and in
W k,p
0
(Ω) for all k ∈N.
Proof. (a1) We ﬁrst show that
 C∞
κ (Ω), ∥. ∥κ

is complete. Let (fν) be a Cauchy
sequence in C∞
κ (Ω). Given ε > 0, there is an n0(ε) ∈N such that
∥fν −fµ∥κ < ε
2
for all µ, ν ≥n0(ε).
By Exercise V.5.3 (a), (fν) is a Cauchy sequence in Ck(Ω) for all k ∈N0, so there
exists a unique f ∈C∞(Rn), with f ≡0 on Rn \ Ω, such that fν →f in the
Ck-norm for all k ∈N0; cf. Exercise II.2.3.
By Exercise V.5.3 (b), the sequence (fν) converges to f in any truncated
Floer norm, too, so there is an n0(ε, m) ∈N such that
∥fν −f∥κ,m < ε
2
for all ν ≥n0(ε, m).
Choose ν(ε, m) ≥max{n0(ε), n0(ε, m)}. Then,
∥fν −f∥κ,m ≤∥fν −fν(ε,m)∥κ,m + ∥fν(ε,m) −f∥κ,m < ε
for all ν ≥n0(ε).
This holds for all m, so we have
∥fν −f∥κ ≤ε
for all ν ≥n0(ε).
This implies f ∈C∞
κ (Ω) and ∥fν −f∥κ →0 as ν →∞.
(a2) According to the theorem of Stone–Weierstraß, for any ﬁnite-dimensional
vector space V the countable set of polynomial functions Rn →V with rational
coeﬃcients is — when we restrict the functions to the compact subset Ω⊂Rn —
dense in C0(Ω, V ). So we may choose countable dense subsets Qj ⊂C0(Ω, Lj),
j ∈N0. We take these sets to include the zero function. Furthermore, we take a
sequence of smooth bump functions ϕℓ: Rn →[0, 1], ℓ∈N, with ϕℓ≡0 on Rn \Ω
and ϕℓ≡1 on Ωoutside a (1/ℓ)-collar neighbourhood of ∂Ω. Then the countable
set
Q0
j :=

ϕℓf : ℓ∈N, f ∈Qj
	
is dense in C0
0(Ω, Lj).
In the linear space L deﬁned in Note V.5.4 we consider the subset
Q :=
∞
[
k=0
 Q0
0 × · · · × Q0
k × {0} × · · ·

,

158
Chapter V. Transversality
which is countable as the countable union of ﬁnite products of countable sets.
We claim that Q is dense in L. Given f = (fj)j≥0 ∈L, choose a sequence
(qν)ν∈N in Q, with qν = (qν
j )j≥0 satisfying the following conditions:
∥qν
j −fj∥C0 <
1
κjνj+1
for 0 ≤j ≤ν,
qν
j ≡0
for j > ν.
Then,

as ν →∞.
This shows that L is separable, and the separability of C∞
κ (Ω) follows with Note
V.5.4 and Exercise IV.2.27.
(b) By Deﬁnition IV.2.22, W k,p
0
(Ω) is the closure of C∞
c (Ω) in W k,p(Ω). Also,
we claim that the space C∞
0 (Ω) is the closure of C∞
c (Ω) in C∞(Ω). The main ideas
are given in the next exercise.
Exercise V.5.6. Let (−1, 1) × ∂Ωbe a bicollar neighbourhood of ∂Ωin Rn, with
{0}×∂Ω≡∂Ωand (−1, 0)×∂Ω⊂Ω. We write points in this collar neighbourhood
as (t, x). Given f ∈C∞
0 (Ω) and k ∈N, choose −δ1 ∈(−1, 0) such that ∥Djf∥op <
1/k on (−δ1, 0] × ∂Ωfor all j ≤k.
Now choose a smooth monotone increasing function ψ: (−1, 0] →R, Ck-
close to the identity, with ψ(t) = t for t ∈(−1, −δ1] and ψ(0) = δ0 for some
0 < δ0 ≪δ1. Then replace f on (−1, 0] × Ωby f ◦ψ, and extend identically 0
outside Ω.
Show that f ◦ψ is compactly supported in Ωand Ck-close to f. In this way
one can ﬁnd a sequence (fν) in C∞
c (Ω) that converges to f in all Ck-norms.
♦
Therefore, it suﬃces to prove that for a suitable choice of κ, any f ∈C∞
c (Ω)
can be approximated uniformly in all derivatives by functions in C∞
κ (Ω).

V.5.3
A Banach manifold of almost complex structures
Recall the Cayley transformation fW : J →W from Section I.7.3. In that section
we considered linear complex structures on R2n, and the Cayley transformation
was deﬁned with respect to the standard complex structure J0, which meant that
fW(J0) = 0.
One may as well replace J0 in that construction by any linear complex struc-
ture Jb compatible with ω, so that the corresponding Cayley transformation sat-
isﬁes fW(Jb) = 0. We call this the Cayley transformation based at Jb.
Exercise V.5.8. Recall the set-up and notation of Sections I.7.1 and I.7.3. Fix a
linear complex structure Jb ∈J = J (ω). Write the metric
⟨v, w⟩Jb = ω(v, Jbw)
in matrix notation as
⟨v, w⟩Jb = vtBw.
Deﬁne the manifolds6
Z := ZJb :=

Z ∈R2n×2n : (BZ)t = BZ, BZ > 0, JbZ = Z−1Jb

and


W ∈R2n×2n : (BW)t = BW, |W|Jb < 1, JbW = −WJb
	
of (2n × 2n)-matrices. Here, > 0 stands for positive deﬁnite, and |W|Jb denotes
the operator norm of W with respect to the norm | . |Jb on R2n.
(a) Show that J 7→−JbJ deﬁnes a diﬀeomorphism J →Z.
(b) Show that fC : Z 7→(E −Z)(E +Z)−1 is deﬁned and gives a diﬀeomorphism
Z →W.
♦
Remark V.5.9. The equation (BW)t = BW is equivalent to saying that W is
self-adjoint with respect to the metric ⟨. , . ⟩Jb.
We now introduce the Floer space Jκ of ω-compatible almost complex struc-
tures on R2n adapted to the nonsqueezing theorem.
Notation V.5.10. Write J0 for the space of ω-compatible almost complex structures
on R2n that coincide with J0 on R2n \ Φ(Br+ε), and with Φ∗J0 on Φ(Dr); cf.
Section I.7.4.
This space is non-empty by Lemma I.7.17; choose some Jb ∈J0.
Notation V.5.11. By W0 we denote the space of all smooth matrix-valued functions
W : R2n →R2n×2n that satisfy the following conditions:
(i) W(p) ∈WJb(p);
(ii) W ≡0 on R2n \ Ω, with Ω:= Φ(Br+ε \ Dr).
Then the pointwise Cayley transformation based at Jb deﬁnes a diﬀeomor-
phism fW : J0 →W0, J 7→W, where
W(p) = fC
 −Jb(p)J(p)

.
Notation V.5.12. Set Wκ :=

W ∈W0 : ∥W∥κ < ∞
	
, with κ chosen as in Propo-
sition V.5.5. Moreover, deﬁne the Floer space Jκ := f −1
W (Wκ).
The global chart fW|Jκ : Jκ →Wκ gives Jκ the structure of a separable
Banach manifold, and Jκ lies dense in J0.
Notice that W0 is an open subset in what is only a Fr´echet space. The Floer
norm allows us to deﬁne a Banach space — still suﬃciently large for our purposes
— without having to work with spaces of ﬁnite order of diﬀerentiability.
V.6
The universal moduli space
We now follow the strategy outlined in Section V.2.4 to prove that, for an appro-
priate choice of almost complex structure J on R2n subject to the conditions of

V.6. The universal moduli space
161
Lemma I.7.17, the moduli space MJ = ker ∂J is a separable Banach manifold.
The key concept is the ‘universal moduli space’.
On B × Jκ we have the J-dependent Cauchy–Riemann operator
∂• :
B × Jκ
−→
Lp(D, R2n)
(u, J)
7−→
∂Ju.
Deﬁnition V.6.1. The universal moduli space is
U := ker ∂• =

(u, J) ∈B × Jκ : ∂Ju = 0
	
.
The space U is non-empty thanks to the presence of ﬂat discs, as observed
earlier in Section V.2.4. Our immediate aim will be to show that U is a separable
Banach manifold.
V.6.1
The tangent space TJJ0
The tangent space of B×Jκ at a point (u, J) splits as T(u,J)(B×Jκ) = TuB⊕TJJκ.
We need to discuss the second summand.
First, we consider the larger space J0 (Notation V.5.10). The tangent space
TJJ0 is made up of the matrix-valued functions Y : R2n →R2n×2n that arise as
velocity vectors Y =
d
ds|s=0Js of curves s 7→Js ∈J0, s ∈(−ε, ε), with Js|s=0 = J
(we refrain from writing J0 to avoid confusion with the standard almost complex
structure).
As before, ω denotes the standard symplectic form on R2n, and Ωthe domain
Φ(Br+ε \ Dr) ⊂R2n.
Proposition V.6.2. The tangent space TJJ0 is made up of those smooth matrix-
valued functions Y : R2n →R2n×2n that satisfy the conditions
(Y0)
Y ≡0 on R2n \ Ω,
(Y1)
JY = −Y J,
(Y2)
ω(Y v, Jw) + ω(Jv, Y w) = 0 for all vector ﬁelds v, w on R2n.
Proof. Condition (Y0) corresponds to the fact that all J ∈J0 coincide on R2n \Ω:
with J0 on R2n \ Φ(Br+ε), and with Φ∗J0 on Φ(Dr).
By taking the derivative of the equation J2
s = −id we obtain
0 = d
ds|s=0(J2
s ) = Y J + JY.
Similarly, taking the derivative of the compatibility equation
ω(Jsv, Jsw) = ω(v, w),
we ﬁnd
0 = d
ds|s=0 ω(Jsv, Jsw) = ω(Y v, Jw) + ω(Jv, Y w).

162
Chapter V. Transversality
Thus, any Y ∈TJJ0 satisﬁes the linear conditions (Y1) and (Y2).
Conversely, let Y be a matrix-valued function that satisﬁes conditions (Y0)
to (Y2). Write Y as the velocity vector at 0 of the curve s 7→Js := J exp(−sJY ),
which passes through J at s = 0.
Exercise V.6.3. Verify that J2
s = −id for all s ∈R.
♦
With the ω-compatibility of J, condition (Y2) on Y translates into the equal-
ity ω(JY v, w) = −ω(v, JY w). We then compute
ω(Jsv, Jsw)
=
ω
 J exp(−sJY )v, J exp(−sJY )w

Finally, the fact that Y is compactly supported (and the unit sphere in R2n is
compact) allows one to show that the open condition ω(v, Jsv) > 0 for all nowhere
vanishing vector ﬁelds v is satisﬁed for s in a small open interval containing 0.
Thus, we have found a curve (−ε, ε) ∋s 7→Js ∈J0 with velocity vector Y at J
for s = 0, which demonstrates that Y ∈TJJ0.
□
Exercise V.6.4.
(a) Show that condition (Y2) in Proposition V.6.2 is equiva-
lent to saying that Y is self-adjoint with respect to the Riemannian metric
⟨. , . ⟩J. In particular, with Remark V.5.9 one sees that there is a canonical
identiﬁcation of TJbJ0 with T0W0; cf. Notation V.5.11.
(b) Show that the diﬀeomorphism fW : J0 →W0 can equivalently be written as
J 7→(Jb + J)−1(Jb −J).
(c) Let s 7→Js, s ∈(−ε, ε), be a smooth path in J0 with Js|s=0 = Jb. Compute
the derivative at s = 0 of the identity (J0 + Js)−1(J0 + Js) = id.
(d) Show that the diﬀerential of fW at Jb is given by TJbfW(Y ) = 1
2JbY , and
observe, in agreement with (a), that Y 7→JbY is an automorphism of W0
(and an isomorphism of its tangent space at any W ∈W0).
♦
Implicit in part (d) of the exercise is the observation that the deﬁning equa-
tions for the space W0 are linear but for the norm condition |W|Jb < 1, so the
tangent space to W0 at any of its points is described precisely by those linear
conditions. When we pass to the subspace Wκ ⊂W0 (cf. Notation V.5.12), the
tangent spaces to Wκ also inherit the ﬁniteness condition ∥W∥κ < ∞.

V.6. The universal moduli space
163
The tangent space to Jκ at any J ∈Jk may then be described as
TJJκ = TW (f −1
W )(TW Wκ),
where W = fW(J) ∈Wκ.
V.6.2
The linearisation of ∂•
Let s 7→(us, Js), s ∈(−ε, ε), be a smooth path in B × Jκ. As in Section IV.1.4,
where we computed the linearisation Du of ∂J, we use a chart of B given by the
exponential map and write the velocity vector to the curve s 7→us in B as
d
ds|s=0us = (ξ, t) ∈Tu0Bt0 ⊕Rn−1 = Tu0B ⊂W 1,p(D, R2n) ⊕Rn−1.
As in the preceding section we write
d
ds|s=0Js = Y . Then, the linearisation D(u,J)
of ∂• at (u, J) = (us, Js)|s=0 becomes
D(u,J)(ξ, t; Y ) = d
ds|s=0
 ∂xus + Js(us)∂yus

= Du(ξ, t) + Y (u)∂yu.
Here Du is the diﬀerential of ∂J at u, but we suppress the dependence on J from
the notation.
Proposition V.6.5. The linearisation
D(u,J) : TuB ⊕TJJκ −→Lp(D, R2n)
at any point (u, J) ∈U is surjective.
Here is an exercise in linear algebra we shall use in the proof of this propo-
sition.
Exercise V.6.6. Write Y ∈R2n×2n for an element of TJJ0 evaluated at some
point p ∈R2n (in other words, Y is shorthand for Y (p)). By Remark V.5.9 and
Exercise V.6.4, such a matrix Y is characterised by the conditions
Y = JY J
and
Y t = BY B−1,
where B = −J0J (all at the point p) is the positive deﬁnite symmetric matrix
that represents the scalar product ⟨. , . ⟩J; cf. Exercise I.7.5.
Let ξ, η ∈R2n \ {0} be given. Our aim is to ﬁnd a Y such that Y ξ = η.
(a) We ﬁrst consider the case that J = J0, where B is the unit matrix. Set

Chapter V. Transversality
Verify that Y = J0Y J0 = Y t and Y ξ = η.
Observe how Y is constructed. The ﬁrst of eight summands is a ma-
trix that sends ξ to η. The second summand makes the matrix symmetric.
Together with the third and fourth summands, the resulting matrix Y4 is
still symmetric and satisﬁes Y4 = J0Y4J0, but it no longer sends ξ to η. The
remaining four summands also satisfy the two conditions required by Y , and
they give the necessary correction so that Y ξ = η.
(b) Generalise this strategy to ﬁnd Y in the case of an arbitrary J. To do this,
start with
1
|ξ|2
J
ηξtB,
and then add correcting terms as in (a). To ﬁnd these terms, ﬁrst verify
the identity Jt = −BJB−1, and observe that any matrix of the form Z =
Z0 + B−1Zt
0B satisﬁes Zt = BZB−1. Deduce that JZJ also satisﬁes this
condition. Also use that ⟨ξ, Jξ⟩J = 0.
♦
Proof of Proposition V.6.5. Let (u, J) ∈U be given, i.e. J ∈Jκ and u ∈MJ. By
Theorem V.1.5, the diﬀerential Du : TuB →Lp(D, R2n) is a Fredholm operator,
so it has a ﬁnite-dimensional cokernel. Since Du is a direct summand of D(u,J),
the latter has a ﬁnite-dimensional cokernel, too. It follows with Lemma V.1.2 that
the image of D(u,J) is closed.
We now distinguish the two (not mutually exclusive) cases that u is a ﬂat
disc (Notation I.8.23) or a nonstandard disc (Deﬁnition II.1.8).
In the ﬁrst case we have Du = ∂(see Remark IV.1.18), and according to
Proposition V.1.28, this linear Cauchy–Riemann operator is surjective. A fortiori,
D(u,J) is surjective.
In the second case, the image u(D) intersects the domain Ω= Φ(Br+ε \ Dr)
where the almost complex structure is allowed to vary. We shall use in an essen-
tial way that the space Jκ of permissible almost complex structures is suﬃciently
‘large’, in the sense that the inﬁnitesimal variations of J in Jκ ensure the surjec-
tivity of D(u,J). By Note V.1.15, the space im D(u,J), being of ﬁnite codimension,
has a complementary closed subspace. Our aim is to show that this complement
is trivial.
If the complement of im D(u,J) ⊂Lp(D, R2n) were nontrivial, we could deﬁne
a nontrivial bounded linear functional ϕ: Lp(D, R2n) →R with ϕ|im D(u,J) = 0.
Therefore, it suﬃces to show that any element η in the dual space7 Lq(D, R2n),
with q the dual coeﬃcient of p, that is, 1
p + 1
q = 1, is trivial whenever
Z
D
⟨. , η⟩= 0
on im D(u,J).
(V.12)
7For a proof that Lq is the dual space of Lp, see [Hirzebruch & Scharlau 1971, Satz 19.1] or
[Werner 2011, Satz II.2.4]. The dual space of the space of continuous maps, by contrast, is the
space of regular Borel measures — yet another reason for working in the realm of Sobolev spaces.

V.6. The universal moduli space
165
With J′ as deﬁned in (V.1), the diﬀerential D(u,J), applied to a tangent
vector (ξ, t; Y ) = (ξ, 0; 0) takes the form
D(u,J)(ξ, 0; 0) = ∂xξ + J(u)∂yξ + J′ξ.
Thus, if (V.12) is satisﬁed we have, in particular,
Z
D

∂xξ + J(u)∂yξ + J′ξ, η

= 0
for all ξ ∈C∞
c (B1, R2n).
If η were smooth, with the identity J∂yξ = ∂y(Jξ) −(∂yJ)ξ and with integration
by parts we would obtain
Z
D

ξ, ∂xη + J(u)t∂yη +
 (∂yJ)t −(J′)t
η

= 0.
This means that η ∈Lq(D, R2n) is a weak solution of the diﬀerential equation
∂xη + J(u)t∂yη +
 (∂yJ)t −(J′)t
η = 0.
In Lemma V.6.11 we shall prove that η is then automatically of class W 1,q.
Arguing as in Section V.3.2, we can transform η into a solution of a linear
equation of the form (V.8), to which one can apply the Carleman similarity prin-
ciple (in the version of Exercise V.3.7). As in the proof of Corollary V.3.4 one then
argues that if η ≡0 on the open and non-empty set u−1(Ω) ⊂D, then η ≡0 on D.
Thus, to conclude the proof, we want to show that η|u−1(Ω) ≡0. Arguing by
contradiction, we assume that η does not vanish identically on u−1(Ω). According
to Lemma V.4.3 and Proposition V.4.4, the subset Inj(u) ⊂D of injective points
is open and dense in D. This allows us to choose a point z0 ∈D and an ε > 0
such that Bε(z0) ⊂Inj(u) ∩u−1(Ω) and η(z0) ̸= 0. The fact that z0 ∈Inj(u) (and
hence Tz0u ̸= 0) implies ∂yu(z0) ̸= 0; cf. Exercise I.3.9.
By Exercise V.6.6 we ﬁnd a tangent vector Y ∈TJJ0 such that
Y
 u(z0)

∂yu(z0) = η(z0).
Exercise V.6.7. Fill in the minor missing detail in the preceding claim. Conditions
(Y1) and (Y2) in Proposition V.6.2 are pointwise linear. This allows one, with J
denoting the space of all ω-compatible almost complex structures, to regard TJJ
as a vector sub-bundle of the trivial bundle R2n × R2n×2n →R2n. The desired
Y ∈TJJ0 can then be found as a section of this vector bundle with a prescribed
value at u(z0), and with support in Ω.
♦
Notice that because of Bε(z0) ⊂Inj(u), the support of Y may be chosen so
small that it only contains points of u(D) coming from a neighbourhood of z0,
that is,
u−1 supp Y ∩u(D)

⊂Bε(z0).

In this way we can ensure that the function ⟨Y (u)∂yu, η⟩on D is non-negative,
and positive near z0. This yields

Since Jκ is dense in J0, this last positivity condition can also be achieved
with a Y picked in the subspace TJJκ ⊂TJJ0. By (V.12), however, we then have

Remark V.6.8. Rather than abstractly appealing to the density of C∞
κ (Ω) in
C∞
0 (Ω, R), one may observe a little more directly that with the κj deﬁned as
in (V.11), one can directly use the bump function ρ to construct a function in
C∞
κ (Ω) with a prescribed value v0 ∈R at a point x0 ∈Ω. Indeed, the function ρ
constructed in Exercise V.5.7 may be assumed to satisfy ρ(0) = 1, and then the
function x 7→v0εn
0ρε0(x−x0), with ε0 > 0 suﬃciently small such that the support
lies in Ω, does the job.
Exercise V.6.9. Verify the claims made in this last remark.

V.6.3
The Weyl lemma
The Weyl lemma is a fundamental regularity result in the theory of partial diﬀer-
ential equations.
Lemma V.6.10 (Weyl Lemma). Let Ω⊂Rn be a domain. Let u ∈L1
loc(Ω) be a
weak solution of the Laplace equation ∆u = 0, that is,
Z
Ω
u ∆ϕ dλn = 0
for all ϕ ∈C∞
c (Ω).
Then, u is harmonic, i.e. an honest real analytic solution of ∆u = 0.
Idea of the proof. A nice reference for this result is [Beltrami 1968], where the
proof is only marginally longer than the sketch we present here.
We have seen in Note I.4.14 that harmonic functions satisfy the mean value
property. In fact, it can be shown that a function in L1
loc(Ω) is harmonic if and
only if it has the mean value property.
Given a weak solution u of the Laplace equation, consider uε := ρε ∗u,
where ρε is as in Exercise V.5.7, with ρ chosen to be rotationally symmetric. This
convolution uε is harmonic on {x ∈Ω: Bε(x) ⊂Ω}, and hence satisﬁes the mean
value property. The L1
loc-convergence uε →u as ε ↘0 implies that u likewise
satisﬁes the mean value property, and hence is harmonic.
□

V.6. The universal moduli space
167
Here is the lemma needed to complete the proof of Proposition V.6.5.
Lemma V.6.11. Let η ∈Lp(D, R2n) be a weak solution of an equation of the form
∂xη + J∂yη + Aη = 0,
where J = J(z), and A = A(z) is a smooth matrix-valued function. Then η is a
weak solution of class W 1,p.
Proof. We start from the special case of the equation ∂η = 0, to which we can
apply the Weyl lemma, and then proceed step by step to the general equation in
the lemma.
(i) Let η ∈Lp(D, Cn) be a weak solution of the equation ∂η = 0, that is,
Z
D
⟨η, ∂ϕ⟩= 0
for all ϕ ∈C∞
c (B1, Cn).
Here ⟨. , . ⟩denotes the sesquilinear Hermitian inner product on Cn. Taking ϕ
to be of the form ϕ = ∂φ, we see that η is also a weak solution of the Laplace
equation, and hence smooth by the Weyl lemma.
(ii) Let f ∈Lp(D, Cn), and let η be a weak solution of the inhomogeneous
equation ∂η = f, that is,
Z
D
⟨η, ∂ϕ⟩= −
Z
D
⟨f, ϕ⟩
for all ϕ ∈C∞
c (B1, R2n).
Proposition V.1.28 allows us to choose a solution ζ ∈W 1,p(D, R2n) of this inho-
mogeneous equation. Then η −ζ is smooth by (i), and hence η of class W 1,p.
(iii) If η is a weak solution of the equation ∂η + Aη = 0, we may interpret
−Aη ∈Lp(D, R2n) as an inhomogeneity and appeal to (ii).
(iv) Finally, if η is a weak solution of the general equation in the lemma, we
transform the equation to one of type (iii) by conjugating J to J0 as in part (b)
of Exercise V.3.7.
□
For the proof of Proposition V.6.5, instead of appealing to the preceding
lemma and the W 1,p-version of the Carleman similarity principle in part (a) of
Exercise V.3.7, one may improve on the preceding lemma and show that η is actu-
ally an honest smooth solution. This can be achieved by reading the equation on η
in the distributional sense, and then reasoning as in the bootstrapping argument
on page 118 to show that the partial 1-jet z 7→(z, η(z), ηx(z)) satisﬁes an equation
of the same kind as η.
V.6.4
The universal moduli space is a Banach manifold
Now that the surjectivity of D(u,J) at all points (u, J) ∈U has been established,
the next lemma shows that 0 is a regular value of ∂• : B × Jκ →Lp(D, R2n). This
concludes the proof that the universal moduli space U is a Banach manifold.

168
Chapter V. Transversality
Lemma V.6.12. For every (u, J) ∈U the diﬀerential D(u,J) has a right-inverse R
in the sense of Lemma V.2.4.
Proof. The diﬀerential Du is a Fredholm operator by Theorem V.1.5. As in Note
V.1.15 we write
TuB = ker Du ⊕V
and
Lp(D, R2n) = im Du ⊕W
with dim ker Du, dim W < ∞.
Choose a basis f1, . . . , fm for W, and e1, . . . , em ∈T(u,J)(B × Jκ) with
D(u,J)(ei) = fi, which the surjectivity of D(u,J) at (u, J) ∈U allows us to do.

The image of R is the sum (not, in general, direct) of V and the ﬁnite-dimensional
space spanned by e1, . . . , em, and hence closed. One easily veriﬁes that D(u,J) ◦R
is the identity on Lp(D, R2n).
□
V.7
The moduli space M and the evaluation map
Continuing with the strategy outlined in Section V.2.4, we now prove that for
a suitable choice of J ∈Jκ, the moduli space M = MJ is a manifold, and we
determine the degree of the evaluation map ev: M × D →Z.
V.7.1
The moduli space MJ is a manifold
Consider the projection
pJ : B × Jκ ⊃U −→Jκ.
Notice that the projection onto the second factor makes of course sense on all of
B × Jκ, but we regard pJ as being deﬁned exclusively on U. Correspondingly,
the diﬀerential T(u,J)pJ at (u, J) ∈U has T(u,J)U = ker D(u,J) as its domain of
deﬁnition.
Lemma V.7.1. For all (u, J) ∈U, the diﬀerential
T(u,J)pJ : ker D(u,J) = T(u,J)U −→TJJκ
satisﬁes
ker(T(u,J)pJ ) ∼= ker Du
and
coker(T(u,J)pJ ) ∼= coker Du.
By Theorem V.1.5, this lemma shows that the projection pJ : U →Jκ is
a Fredholm map of index 2n −2. Thus, for any regular value J of pJ the (non-
empty!) ﬁbre p−1
J (J) = MJ ⊂U is a manifold of dimension 2n −2. Such regular
values exist in abundance according to the Sard–Smale theorem (Theorem V.2.7).

V.7. The moduli space M and the evaluation map
169
Proof of Lemma V.7.1. We write the diﬀerential
D(u,J) : TuB ⊕TJJκ −→Lp(D, R2n)
as D(u,J)(ξ, t; Y ) = Du(ξ, t) + L(Y ), with
L: TJJκ −→Lp(D, R2n)
given by L(Y ) = Y (u)∂yu. We suppress the dependence of L on u from the
notation.
From TpJ (ξ, t; Y ) = Y we have
ker(TpJ )
=

(ξ, t; Y ) ∈ker D(u,J) : Y = 0
	
∼=
ker Du.
This is the ﬁrst statement of the lemma.
For the second, we observe that
TpJ (ker D(u,J))
=

Y ∈TJJκ : ∃(ξ, t) ∈TuB s.t. LY = −Du(ξ, t)
	
=
L−1(im Du).
Hence
coker(TpJ ) = TJJκ/TpJ (ker D(u,J)) = TJJκ/L−1(im Du).
It therefore remains to show that the well-deﬁned linear map
TJJκ/L−1(im Du)
−→
coker Du
[Y ]
7−→
[L(Y )]
is an isomorphism.
Clearly, this map is injective, for [L(Y )] = 0 in coker Du means that L(Y ) ∈
im Du, and hence Y ∈L−1(im Du), i.e. [Y ] = 0.
For the surjectivity, consider a class [f] ∈coker Du. Write R(f) = (ξ, t; Y ),
where R is the right-inverse of D(u,J) found in Lemma V.6.12. Then the equality
D(u,J) ◦R(f) = f translates into Du(ξ, t)+L(Y ) = f, which means that [L(Y )] =
[f] in coker Du.
□
V.7.2
The mod 2 degree of a smooth map
In order to establish the surjectivity of the evaluation map
ev:
M × D
−→
Z
(u, z)
7−→
u(z),
we need the concept of mapping degree.
We want to show that one can deﬁne a mod 2 mapping degree of a smooth
map f : M →N between equidimensional manifolds without boundary simply by
counting the preimages of any regular value, provided that M is compact and N
is connected.

170
Chapter V. Transversality
Lemma V.7.2. Let M, N be two equidimensional manifolds with M compact, and
let f : M →N be a smooth map. For y ∈N a regular value of f, the set f −1(y)
is ﬁnite, and the function
y 7−→#f −1(y) :=

number of points in f −1(y)
	
∈N0
is locally constant on the (open) set of regular values in N.
Proof. The preimage f −1(y) is a closed subset of the compact space M, and hence
compact. In the neighbourhood of any x ∈f −1(y), the map f is injective by the
inverse function theorem. It follows that the set f −1(y) is ﬁnite.
Write f −1(y) = {x1, . . . , xk}. Choose pairwise disjoint open neighbourhoods
U1, . . . , Uk of x1, . . . , xk, respectively, with f|Ui mapping Ui diﬀeomorphically onto
an open subset Vi ⊂N. Set
V := (V1 ∩. . . ∩Vk) \ f
 M \ (U1 ∪. . . ∪Uk)

.
The set M \ (U1 ∪. . . ∪Uk) is closed in M and hence compact. Its image under f
is compact, and therefore closed in the Hausdorﬀspace N. It follows that V is an
open subset of y in N, consisting entirely of regular values of f, and with
#f −1(y′) = k
for all y′ ∈V .
This proves the lemma.
□
We want to show that #f −1(y) mod 2 does not depend on the choice of
regular value. For this we have to make a slight detour via homotopies of maps.
Deﬁnition V.7.3. Two smooth maps f, g: M →N are (smoothly) homotopic if
there is a smooth map
F : M × [0, 1] −→N
with
F(x, 0) = f(x) and F(x, 1) = g(x)
for all x ∈M.
Proposition V.7.4. Let f, g: M →N be homotopic maps, with M compact. Let
y ∈N be a regular value of both f and g. Then,
#f −1(y) ≡#g−1(y) mod 2.
Proof. Let F be a homotopy between f and g. If y is a regular value of F, then
F −1(y) is a compact 1-dimensional submanifold of M × [0, 1] with boundary
∂
 F −1(y)

= F −1(y) ∩
 M × {0} ∪M × {1}

= f −1(y) × {0} ∪g−1(y) × {1}.
Then the result follows from the well-known fact8 that the only compact 1-
dimensional manifolds are compact intervals (with two endpoints) or circles (with
none); see Figure V.2.
8As noted earlier, a proof of this fact can be found in [Milnor 1965].

V.7. The moduli space M and the evaluation map
171
M × {0}
M × {1}
F −1(y)
Figure V.2: The submanifold F −1(y) ⊂M × [0, 1].
If y is not a regular value of F, choose an open neighbourhood V of y in N
consisting entirely of regular values for both f and g, and with
#f −1(y′) = #f −1(y), #g−1(y′) = #g−1(y)
for all y′ ∈V ;
this is possible by the proof of Lemma V.7.2. Then choose a regular value y′ ∈V
of F (using Sard’s theorem) and proceed as in the ﬁrst case.
□
Exercise V.7.5. Given two points y0, y1 in the same connected component of a
manifold N, show that one can ﬁnd a diﬀeomorphism h of N that is isotopic (i.e.
homotopic via diﬀeomorphisms of N) to the identity and satisﬁes h(y0) = y1.
Hint: Choose a smooth path γ : [0, 1] →N with γ(0) = y0, γ(1) = y1, and without
self-intersections. Extend the vector ﬁeld t 7→˙γ(t) along γ to a compactly sup-
ported smooth vector ﬁeld on N, using local charts and bump functions. Then, the
time-1 map of the ﬂow of this extended vector ﬁeld is the desired diﬀeomorphism.
♦
Proposition V.7.6. Let f : M →N be a smooth map between equidimensional
manifolds, with M compact and N connected. Let y0, y1 be regular values of f.
Then,
#f −1(y0) ≡#f −1(y1) mod 2.
Deﬁnition V.7.7. The well-deﬁned class of #f −1(y) in Z/2Z (for any regular value
y of f) is called the mapping degree mod 2 of f, and denoted by deg2(f).
Proof of Proposition V.7.6. Let h be a diﬀeomorphism of N, isotopic to the iden-
tity, sending y0 to y1. Then, y1 is a regular value of h ◦f, and this composition is
homotopic to f via (x, t) 7→H
 f(x), t

, where H is a homotopy from h to idM.
With Proposition V.7.4 we conclude that
#f −1(y0) = #(h ◦f)−1(y1) ≡#f −1(y1) mod 2.
□
Note V.7.8. If deg2(f) = 1, then f is surjective. This follows immediately from
the fact that any nonvalue is a regular value.

172
Chapter V. Transversality
Exercise V.7.9. Show that the mapping degree deg2(f) depends only on the
smooth homotopy class of f.
♦
Exercise V.7.10. Adapt the arguments of this section to the situation where M
is a compact manifold with boundary, N a connected manifold with boundary,
and f : (M, ∂M) →(N, ∂N) a smooth map. Observe that a point y ∈∂N with a
preimage in M \ ∂M cannot be a regular value.
The compactness assumption on M may be dropped if instead one requires
f to be a proper map.
♦
Exercise V.7.11. Show that the image of a proper map between manifolds is closed.
In fact, this remains true for proper maps between topological spaces, provided
that the target space is locally compact and Hausdorﬀ.
♦
Here is an exercise to show that for maps between noncompact manifolds,
the properness assumption is essential for the deﬁnition of mapping degree.
Exercise V.7.12. Describe a smooth map f : S1 × R →S1 × R such that for any
k ∈Z there is a regular value q ∈S1 × R of f with #f −1(q) = k. Show that if one
requires f to be an immersion, one can still realise all k ∈N0.
♦
Remark V.7.13. The mapping degree can also be deﬁned for continuous maps.
In the case of compact, connected m-dimensional manifolds M, N, the mapping
degree mod 2 of a continuous map f : (M, ∂M) →(N, ∂N) is determined by the
induced homomorphism f∗: Hm(M, ∂M; Z2) →Hm(N, ∂N; Z2) being the trivial
or the nontrivial homomorphism Z2 →Z2.
In the noncompact case, one can use compactly supported cohomology in-
stead.
V.7.3
The degree of the evaluation map
Choose an almost complex structure J ∈Jκ such that M := MJ is a manifold.
According to Theorem II.2.7, the evaluation map
ev:
M × D
−→
Z
(u, z)
7−→
u(z)
is proper. As summarised in Section II.1.6, the image of ev is indeed contained
in the closed cylinder Z, and outside a compact subset D2 × D2n−2
K
we only ﬁnd
points in the image of ev coming from a unique ﬂat disc. We may assume that K
has been chosen large enough such that, for some ε > 0, the region
D2 ×
 D2n−2
K
\ B2n−2
K−ε

is foliated completely by ﬂat discs, and no nonstandard disc passes through this
region. In particular, for any u ∈M we have either u(D) ⊂D2 × D2n−2
K
or
u(D) ∩
 D2 × D2n−2
K

= ∅.

V.7. The moduli space M and the evaluation map
173
We now work with a ‘truncated’ moduli space
M∨:=

u ∈M: u(D) ⊂D2 × D2n−2
K
	
.
Equivalently, we can describe M∨as the projection of
ev−1 D2 × D2n−2
K

⊂M × D
to M. By the properness of the evaluation map, M∨is compact.
We have
Int(M∨) × D = ev−1 D2 × B2n−2
K

,
which shows that Int(M∨) is an open subset of M, and hence a manifold of
dimension 2n −2. A neighbourhood of the boundary ∂M∨in M∨consists of ﬂat
discs ut
s, parametrised by s+it with s+it ∈D2n−2
K
\B2n−2
K−ε . This means that M∨
is a manifold with boundary.
We now consider the evaluation map
ev:
 M∨× D, ∂(M∨× D)

−→
 D2 × B2n−2
K
, ∂(D2 × B2n−2
K
)

.
(V.13)
After smoothing corners (see [Br¨ocker & J¨anich 1973] for this diﬀerential topo-
logical technique), we may regard domain and target as smooth manifolds with
boundary.
In Lemma II.2.6 we have shown that the evaluation map is continuous. This
suﬃces if one works with the homological deﬁnition of mapping degree. The re-
placement for Note V.7.8 is provided by the next exercise.
Exercise V.7.14. Let M, N be compact, connected m-dimensional manifolds with
boundary, and f : (M, ∂M) →(N, ∂N) a continuous map. Show that if there is a
point q ∈Int(N) not in the image of f, then deg2(f) = 0.
Hint: If y ∈Int(N) is a point not in the image of f, the induced homomorphism
f∗: Hm(M, ∂M; Z2) →Hm(N, ∂N; Z2) factorises through the homology group
Hm(N \ {y}, ∂N; Z2). Show this latter group to be zero using the relative Mayer–
Vietoris sequence [Hatcher 2002, p. 152].
♦
If we want to use the diﬀerential topological deﬁnition of mapping degree,
we need to establish that ev is at least of class C1.
Exercise V.7.15. Recall that a tangent vector to the Fr´echet manifold C∞(D, R2n)
at some point u is simply a map ξ ∈C∞(D, R2n), where ξ(z) ought to be regarded
as an element of the tangent space Tu(z)R2n.
Show that the Gateaux derivative of the evaluation map
ev: C∞(D, R2n) × D −→R2n
is given by
T(u,z)ev(ξ, v) = ξ(z) + Tzu(v).
Show further that ev is of class C1 in the sense of Deﬁnition IV.1.1.
By similar arguments one sees that ev is in fact smooth.
♦

174
Chapter V. Transversality
Remark V.7.16. Sard’s theorem remains true for maps f : M →N of ﬁnite degree
of diﬀerentiability Ck, provided that
k > max

dim M −dim N, 0
	
.
Thus, for maps between equidimensional manifolds, C1 is suﬃcient.
We now apply these considerations to the evaluation map ev in (V.13). From
the behaviour of the holomorphic discs near D2 × ∂B2n−2
K
, we deduce that the
mod 2 degree of ev equals 1.
This concludes the proof of Theorem I.8.13. In the proof of Corollary I.8.14
we use the observation from Note V.7.8 or Exercise V.7.14. The proof of Gromov’s
nonsqueezing theorem (Theorem I.3.1) is now complete.
