About the Author
Marsha Collier, one of the foremost eBay experts and educators in the world, 
is also a top-selling eBay author with over 1 million copies of her books in 
print. She is especially proud of two books: eBay For Dummies, the bestsell-
ing book for eBay beginners, and eBay PowerSeller Business Practices For 
Dummies. Marsha co-hosts the Computer and Technology Show on KTRB 
860am in San Francisco and on www.wsradio.com along with Marc Cohen. 
She also shares her eBay business expertise through video training segments 
at Entrepreneur.com’s Entrepreneur’s Coaches Corner and on her blog.
Marsha intermixes her writing about eBay with her role as experienced 
spokesperson on the subject. She was one of the original eBay University 
instructors, as well as a regular presenter at eBay’s annual convention, eBay 
Live. Marsha also hosted the highly acclaimed “Making Your Fortune Online,” 
a PBS special highlighting online business. While traveling across the United 
States and around the world, she makes regular appearances on television, 
radio, and in print to discuss online commerce.
Marsha earned her eBay stripes as a longtime seller on the site. She began 
her eBay selling career in 1996 to earn extra money for her daughter’s educa-
tion (and eventually paid for university with her eBay earnings). She grew 
her business to a full-time venture and was one of the fi rst eBay PowerSellers. 
Nowadays, you can fi nd everything from autographed copies of her books 
to photo supplies, pet toys, and DVDs in her eBay store (“Marsha Collier’s 
Fabulous Finds”) and on her Web site.
Marsha currently resides in Los Angeles, CA. You can contact Marsha via her 
Web site, www.coolebaytools.com.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to all you prospective eBay sellers out there who have 
the dream and the drive to succeed. I wrote this book for you, and I share my 
expertise so you can skip the trial-and-error and go straight to work gaining 
the most profi ts. Those who succeed join me in knowing that hard work and 
loving what you do get the job done — and lead you to fi nancial achievement 
and contentment.
Good luck in your endeavors. I know this book will help you get to the next 
level.
Acknowledgments
Writing a book is a monumental task. Lots of people have helped, but the 
lion’s share of assistance comes from the encouragement that I receive from 
the eBay community and those I’ve met when “doing it eBay.”
If it weren’t for Patti “Louise” Ruby’s friendship and support as the tech 
editor for this book, I think I might have lost my mind. She helped me keep on 
top of the many changes on the eBay site and never said no to my seemingly 
endless requests.
Once again, I was blessed with Leah Cameron and Barry Childs-Helton who 
were my editors on this book. Working with Leah is a dream. She’s there to 
lend her unique style of smart savvyness to my words. She truly “gets it” like 
no one else. And Barry cleans up after us both. You’d almost think there’s no 
one on earth with such vast experience with the English language — especially 
Victorian nouns. I’m honored to have them as my editors; they help create the 
very best in the For Dummies series. Thank you, Leah and Barry.
Then, of course, I thank the management at Wiley. My publisher, Andy 
Cummings, and my acquisitions editor, Steven Hayes, both work hard to fi ll 
the world with instructional and entertaining books.

Introduction
I
t seems I am always writing books about eBay. That’s because eBay 
changes from year to year (as does the online market) and I am obsessive 
about keeping my books the most updated in the arena. 
My books don’t just give you the information you can find on eBay; I give 
you the ins and outs selling on eBay, based on my daily experience of the 
site. I also stay on top of the current trends in online and social marketing; 
test them out, and pass the results back to you. This book gives you more 
information than even many longtime sellers know. (Trust me — I consult 
with sellers, and the things I consider most basic are often new to old-timers 
on the site.)
I am lucky enough to have been selling on eBay since 1996 and am a charter 
member of the PowerSeller program. Running a business on eBay has given 
me the opportunity to spend more time with my loved ones and have better 
control of my life. I can make my own schedule and enjoy what I’m doing 
because my business is making a profit. Owning an online business can be 
empowering.
Those of us who run an eBay business always seem to be doing something. 
Buying, selling, even going on a vacation, our business keeps humming. 
There’s no 9-to-5, no weekends or holidays. Our stores on eBay are always 
open for business — making sales and making us money.
Alas, all that success and freedom takes some work. That’s why you have 
this book.
About This Book
This book will give you the basics, the hows and whys of setting up a 
home-based business on eBay. I’ve authored several best-selling books 
about running a business on eBay. This book gives you the information you 
need to get started in one nifty (albeit heavy) volume. You can get the info 
found in several books about eBay all in one place.
What You’re Not to Read
There’s a lot in this book that you’ll find useful. If some of it seems too basic 
(say, if you’re a more advanced seller), just skip right on by to the information 
that your business needs. 

2
Foolish Assumptions
Sidebars are scattered through the book with additional information on a 
subject. If you want to know the subject in depth, read the sidebar. If it’s not 
important to you right now, blow right past it.
There’s no need to start at the beginning. Check out the Table of Contents 
and see whether something piques your interest. Have a question about 
eBay? Look it up in the index. This book is meant to be your useful desk 
reference on eBay.
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I’ve made a few assumptions about you. Because 
you bought this book, naturally I assume you’re an intelligent person with 
refined tastes. Okay, kidding aside, that may well be true — but the main 
assumption I’ve really made about you is that you want to find out more 
about eBay. 
I assume also that you
 
✦ Have a computer and an Internet connection
 
✦ Are comfortable browsing the Internet
 
✦ Are familiar with e-mail
 
✦ Are looking for a way to make some extra money
 
✦ Have checked out eBay and perhaps bought a few items
You’ve probably sold a few items and made a couple of dollars. Perhaps 
you think eBay just might be a good place to earn a regular stream of extra 
income. It also helps if you’ve read my current edition of eBay For Dummies — 
where you get the basics of eBay.
If you can accept that nothing comes without a bit of effort, you might just 
be on the track of a new career.
How This Book Is Organized
Here, in one volume, are nine individual minibooks related to becoming an 
expert on eBay. Each book is broken down into individual chapters to give 
you more in-depth information on the subject at hand. Here’s the lineup.

3
How This Book Is Organized
Book I: eBay Basics
Book I provides the beginning-level stuff you have to know to make your 
way on eBay. Sure, you can do business on eBay and not know all the small 
details, but knowledge is power; this book has the information that will give 
you the winning edge over other sellers. Even if you’ve been on eBay for a 
while, you might just discover a few things reading this book.
Book II: Essential Tools
Using eBay means using some of the basic tools that eBay has developed 
for buyers and sellers. In Book II, you research prices (for buying or selling), 
find an item (no matter how badly the seller mislisted it), and use PayPal 
with ease. You’ll also find out how an Internet search can help you with your 
eBay business.
Also, there’s a chapter on effective eBay communications. Sounds a bit 
stuffy, I know, but your e-mail communications are the cornerstone of your 
eBay business.
Book III: Selling Like a Pro
Anyone can list an item for sale on eBay, but after you read the information 
in Book III, you’ll be among the elite who can squeeze extra profits from your 
sales. You also find out how to use advanced eBay tools that can cut your 
work time to a fraction of what other sellers spend.
Book IV: Sourcing Merchandise
The number one question that people ask me is “What should I sell on 
eBay?” To me, it’s intuitive — but then again, I love to shop. Book IV gives 
you the tools for finding the right items to please your customers and make 
regular sales. The information in this book is not just someone’s theory. 
Instead, it comes directly from professional retailers, people who are 
successes on eBay!
Book V: Presenting Your Items 
All the salesmanship in the world won’t sell your items if your pictures are

Icons Used in This Book
I’ve written quite a few books in the For Dummies series, and all the books 
have cute little icons to draw your attention to special comments. Following 
are the ones I use, along with what they mean.
 
This icon indicates a story about a real event. It may have been one of my 
auctions or one from a fellow user. I hope you find the story interesting and 
learn from another user’s mistake (or dumb luck).
 
When you see this icon, it’s a friendly reminder to keep in mind the short 
fact that follows. No doubt it will come up again, and you’ll be ahead of the 
game if you remember it.

I
f the whole idea of technology gives you the creeps, don’t back out now. 
I feel your pain. Every tech-oriented bit of knowledge that’s entered my 
pea-sized brain has penetrated only after a great deal of mental whining. I 
suffered the pain so that you wouldn’t have to.
Better yet, you don’t need to know much technology (in the true sense of 
the word) to run a successful online business. Most online sellers have 
about as much knowledge as you will after you read this chapter.
Starting with the Right Computer
You don’t have to know a lot of fancy computer mumbo-jumbo to do well on 
eBay, but you must have a computer. If you’re in the market for a computer, 
you can buy or lease a new, used, or refurbished system, depending on your 
computing needs.
The absolute necessities
Although the following list is geared mainly toward the purchase of new PCs 
(which you can get for considerably under a thousand bucks), you should 
read this info even if you’re thinking of buying a used computer:
 ✦ Look for a computer with a good memory. Remember that 1950s horror 
movie The Blob? The more time you spend using your computer, the more 
stuff you want to save on your hard drive. The more stuffed your hard 
drive, the more Blob-like it becomes. A hard drive with at least 60 gigabytes 
(GB) of storage space should keep your computer happy, but you can get 
hard drives as big as 300GB and more. I recommend you buy the biggest 

10
Starting with the Right Computer
hard drive you can afford because no matter how large your hard drive is, 
you’ll find a way to fill it up.
 ✦ Make sure you have a top-quality modem if you have a dial-up 
connection. Your modem connects your computer to the Internet using 
your telephone line. Even if you have a broadband connection (see 
later in this chapter), you should have a modem (usually built in to most 
computers) that can connect you on the off-chance that your high-speed 
service is down. (A modem transfers data over phone lines at a rate called 
kilobytes per second, or just plain K). A 56K modem is standard equipment, 
especially if you plan on using a lot of digital images (photographs) to 
help sell your items.
 ✦ Get a big screen. An LCD monitor that has at least a 17-inch screen can 
make a huge difference after several hours of rabid bidding or proof-
reading your auction item descriptions. Anything smaller and you’ll have 
a hard time actually seeing the listings and images.
 ✦ Make sure the computer’s central processing unit (CPU) is fast. A CPU 
(also known as a “chip”) is your computer’s brain. It should be the 
fastest you can afford. You can always opt for the top-of-the-line, but 
even a slower 900 MHz (megahertz) processor could suffice. One of my 
computers is an antique slowpoke, but it’s still fast enough that it won’t 
choke when I ask it to do some minor multitasking. If you want lightning-
fast speed (imagine a Daytona 500 race car with jet assist), you have to 
move up to at least 3 GHz (gigahertz).
 ✦ Get a CD-R/DVD-R drive. A disc burner is standard equipment. You 
use the drive to load new software programs into your computer from 
compact discs. You can also use the CDs or DVDs for your backups. 
Most models play and record DVD movies on your computer, but I think 
you’ll be so entertained by eBay that you can skip the frills and save the 
bucks.
 ✦ You must have a keyboard. No keyboard, no typing. The basic key-
board is fine. They do make funky ergonomic models that are split in the 
middle. But if the good old standard keyboard feels comfortable to you, 
stick with it. 
 
 Different keyboards have different feels. I like a keyboard with “clicky” 
keys because my fingers know that the letters I type actually appear. 
Test out several keyboards and see which one suits your typing style.
 ✦ You need a pointing device, usually a mouse. Some laptops come 
with touchpads or trackballs designed to do the same thing — give you 
a quick way to move the pointer around the screen so you can select 
options by clicking.

Starting with the Right Computer
Buying a used computer
If you don’t have a computer yet and don’t have much money to spend, you 
might want to investigate the used market. Thousands of perfectly good 
used machines are floating around looking for a caring home. You can pick 
up a model that’s a few years old for a few hundred dollars, and it will serve 
your budding eBay needs just fine. The same holds true for used Macs. Make 
sure a monitor is included in the purchase price. eBay’s sellers sell their old 
computers when they upgrade. You can get some great deals.
Buying a refurbished computer
If you don’t feel comfortable buying a used machine, you may want to 
consider a factory-refurbished model. These are new machines that were 
returned to the manufacturer for one reason or another. The factory fixes 
them so they’re nice and spiffy, and then sweetens the deal with a terrific 
warranty. Some companies even offer optional, extended, on-site repairs. 
What you’re getting is a new computer at a deep discount because the 
machine can’t be resold legally as new.
 
For the most part, refurbished computers are defined as returns, units with 
blemishes (scratches, dents, and so on), or evaluation units. The factories 
rebuild them to the original working condition, using new parts (or some-
times used parts that meet or exceed performance specs for new parts). 
They come with 60- to 90-day warranties that cover repairs and returns. 
Warranty information is available on the manufacturers’ Web sites. Be sure 
to read it before you purchase a refurbished computer.
Major computer manufacturers such as Dell, IBM, Sony, Hewlett-Packard, and 
Apple provide refurbished computers. Check whether their Web site has an 
outlet store. (Their outlet stores may reside in eBay Stores.) I visit shopping.
hp.com, www.sonystyle.com/outlet, and www.dell.com/outlet, and 
check the sites for closeouts and refurbished goods all the time — and I’ve 
never been burned!
 
Because the inventory of refurbished computers changes daily (as do the 
prices), there’s no way of telling exactly how much money you can save by 
buying refurbished instead of new. I suggest that you find a new computer 
system you like (and can afford) in a store or a catalog, and then compare it 
with refurbished systems. If you’re thinking about buying from the Web or a 
catalog, don’t forget to include the cost of shipping in the total price. Even 
with shipping costs, however, a refurbished computer may save you 
between 30 and 60 percent, depending on the deal you find.

Connecting to eBay without a Computer
Upgrading your system with the help of eBay
 
You may think I’m putting the cart before the horse with this suggestion, but 
you can get a new or used computer system at a great price by signing on to 
eBay before you buy your computer. You can get online at a local library or 
ask to borrow a friend’s computer. I’ve seen eBay listings for workable, “vin-
tage” PCs (a few years old), fully outfitted, for $400. Often such systems also 
come loaded with software. And when you have your new system in shape, 
why not auction off your old system on eBay?
You can also find on eBay all the bits and pieces you need to upgrade your 
computer. The items you may find most useful include
 ✦ Digital cameras and scanners
 ✦ Disk drives, including CD or DVD drives and memory cards
 ✦ Monitors
 ✦ Printers
 
 
 Home wireless networks are becoming de rigueur; many people have 
them set up even if they don’t have a business at home. You can now 
buy Wi-Fi printers that allow you to send print jobs through your net-
work at a printer located elsewhere in your home.
You may have to keep checking in and monitoring the different auctions that 
eBay has going on; listings change daily. Go put in your best bid, and check 
back later to see whether you’ve won! (If you want to find out about the fine 
art of sniping — bidding at the last minute — skip to Chapter 6. I won’t be 
insulted if you leave me for awhile now. Honest.)
Connecting to eBay without a Computer
Yes, sometimes life is a Catch-22 situation. Say your goal is to make some 
money on eBay so you can afford to buy a computer. Because you can’t 
log on to eBay without a computer, you can’t make money, right? Well, not 
exactly. Here’s how you can start selling and bringing in some cold hard 
cash for that shiny new (or not-so-shiny used) hardware.
Libraries: From Dewey Decimal to eBay
If you haven’t been to your local library lately, you may be surprised to 
find that most libraries are fully wired with computers that connect to the 
Internet. The card catalog has been replaced by computers that keep the 
Dewey Decimal System (DDS) alive and connected to libraries all over the 

Book I
Chapter 1
Hooking Up with 
Online Technology
13
Connecting to eBay without a Computer
world. For example, you’ll find this book classified in 381.17, with the subject 
heading “Auctions — computer network resources.”
Some libraries don’t even require you to have a library card if you want to 
use a computer. Others limit the amount of time you can spend online and 
the sites you can log on to (often only adult sites are blocked). eBay is con-
sidered fair game, and exploring it is even considered research.
 
The upside of using the library’s computer is that it’s free. The downside is 
that you may have to wait for some kid to finish doing research for a term 
paper on the ceremonial use of yak milk.
Commercial cyber-outlets and cafés
If you strike out at the public library (or you’re tired of the librarian shush-
ing you as you cheer your winning bids), your friend throws you out of the 
house, and your boss watches you like a hawk, you can use a commercial 
outlet to kick off your eBay career. There’s also the option of finding Internet 
cafés that have computers ready and waiting to use. 
National chains such as FedEx Kinko’s or your favorite local cybercafé offer 
computer usage at an hourly rate. FedEx Kinko’s offers computers (both PCs 
and Macs loaded with all the software you need) that can get you online for 
around $15 per hour or $.25 per minute. No restrictions apply: You get full 
access to the Internet and can enjoy all the elements of eBay. You can con-
duct your auctions by posting them and checking back regularly. You can 
also watch for great computer deals that you may want to bid on.
Cybercafés can be another way to go. If you live near a college, you’ll prob-
ably find some. Hourly rates are much cheaper because you end up ordering 
a cup of joe or a soda. I once checked on my auctions from a cybercafé in 
Peru; they charged only $1.50 an hour — what a deal!
If you love Starbucks already, you’re going to 
love it even more now that they’re beginning 
to reward their most loyal customers with 
two consecutive hours of free Wi-Fi per day. 
To take advantage of the offer, all you have 
to do is register your Starbucks Card and join 
Starbucks Card Rewards. If you use your card 
at least once a month to buy your beverage 
of choice — voila — you’re entitled to free 
AT&T Wi-Fi. Visit www.starbucks.com/
retail/wireless.asp to sign up.
Free Wi-Fi at Starbucks!

Choosing an ISP
Hooking up from work
If you get a long lunch at work or have to kill time waiting for clients to call 
back, you may want to get started on eBay from your work computer. But 
give it a lot of thought before you do. Pink slips can come unbidden to those 
who run auctions on company time.
Choosing an ISP
Okay, so you bought (or found a way to access) a computer, and you’re 
ready to surf eBay. Hold on a minute — before you start surfing, you need 
access to the Internet. (Details, details. . . .) The way to access the Internet 
is through an ISP, or Internet service provider, such as Earthlink, MSN 
(Microsoft Network), or RoadRunner. If you don’t already belong to one of 
these, don’t worry; joining is easy.
 
To join a telephone dial-up ISP (because dial-up requires no additional equip-
ment or connections), just load the freebie software that comes with a com-
puter (or free at the computer store) into your CD drive and follow the 
registration steps that appear on your computer screen. Have your credit 
card and lots of patience handy. With a little luck and no computer glitches, 
you’ll have an active account and instant access to e-mail and the Internet in 
less than an hour. 
 
When you go to a computer store or buy a computer, you’re hit with all 
kinds of free trial offers that beg you to “Sign up now, first month free!” You 
can find free introductory deals everywhere! (They used to just come on 
CDs. I have a friend who painted all her free CDs and hung them on her 
Christmas tree. Another sawed them in half and made a very unattractive 
cyberbelt.) If you’re new to the Internet and not sure which ISP to go with, 
your best bet may be to start with NetZero HiSpeed. NetZero has been 
around for years and offers accelerated speeds on its dial-up connections. 
If you have a need for speed, and your time is worth a bit more than an 
increase in ISP cost, you may want to look into getting a broadband connec-
tion. The quality of the different types of broadband (DSL and cable) can 
vary greatly from area to area and even from street to street.
Before you decide what kind of broadband connection you want, go to the 
following:
www.broadbandreports.com

Choosing an ISP
Type your ZIP code, and read the reports for other users in your area (see 
Figure 1-1). You can e-mail, post questions, and get all the information you 
need to decide what kind of high-speed connection will work best for you.
 
Figure 1-1: 
The 
Broadband 
Reports 
Web site 
has handy 
tools to help 
you select 
an ISP in 
your area.
 
Broadband, or high-speed, connections can be a boon to your eBay busi-
ness. Here’s the skinny on the different types:
 ✦ DSL: Short for Digital Subscriber Line. For as little as $19.95 a month, 
you can get rid of your pokey, analog dial-up connection and always be 
connected to the Internet. A DSL line can move data as fast as 6 MB per 
second — that’s six million bits per second, or 140 times as fast as a 56K 
modem. At that speed, a DSL connection can greatly enhance your eBay 
and Internet experiences. For more information about what DSL is and 
how to get it, visit www.dslreports.com.
 ✦ Cable: An Internet cable connection is a reliable method for Internet 
access if you have digital cable TV. Your Internet connection runs 
through your television cable and is regulated by your cable TV pro-
vider. With the advent of digital cable, this reliable and speedy Internet 
connection is an excellent alternative. (See my speed report from my 
wireless network in Figure 1-2.) Most cable accounts include several 
e-mail addresses and space to store your images.

Accessing E-Mail
After you have access to the Internet, you need access to e-mail. If you have 
your own computer and an ISP, you probably have e-mail access automati-
cally. But if you’re logging on to the Internet away from home, you might 
want to look into setting up a free e-mail provider.
Most ISPs will allow you to check your e-mail from their Web sites, but 
commonly, you’ll be using Microsoft’s Outlook Express to check your mail 
on your home computer.
Google’s Gmail, Yahoo!, and Hotmail are the most popular Web-based, free 
e-mail providers. They are free and secure, and signing up is a snap. I like 
them because all have a Mail Alert feature, which allows you to instruct Gmail, 
Yahoo!, or MSN Mobile to contact you through your Web-enabled cell phone 
when you have new e-mail. You can join Gmail at www.gmail.com, Yahoo! 
e-mail at www.yahoo.com, and Hotmail by going to www.hotmail.com.
Some commonsense rules can help you protect your account:
 ✦ Select a password that’s difficult to guess. Use letter-and-number 
combinations or nonsensical words that nobody else knows. Don’t use 
common names or words relating to you (such as the name of your 
street).
 ✦ Keep passwords secret. If someone asks for your password online, you 
can bet it’s a scam. Never give out your password.
 ✦ Don’t open an e-mail with an attachment from an unknown person. 
The attachment (another file attached to your e-mail message) could 
contain a virus.

Browsing for a Browser
 ✦ Don’t respond to spam e-mail. Spam is online slang for harassing, 
offensive, or useless-but-widely-distributed messages or advertisements. 
If you ignore and delete such junk without even opening it, the senders 
will probably just go look for somebody else to bother.
Browsing for a Browser
When you get a computer, you get an Internet browser for free. A browser is 
the software program that lets your computer talk to the Internet. It’s like 
having your own private cyberchauffeur. Type the address (also known as 
the URL, for Uniform Resource Locator) of the Web site you want to visit, and 
boom, you’re there. For example, to get to eBay’s home page, type www.
ebay.com and press Enter. (It’s sort of a low-tech version of “Beam me up, 
Scotty!” — and almost as fast.)
The two most popular browsers are Firefox (available both for MAC and the 
PC) and Microsoft Internet Explorer. (They are what Coca-Cola and Pepsi are 
to the cola wars.) Both programs are powerful and user-friendly. Figures 1-3 
and 1-4 show you these browsers and how they show pages in the same way. 
(Sit, browser! Now shake! Good browser!) The one you choose is a matter of 
preference — I use them both!

of the software):
 ✦ Go to www.microsoft.com for Microsoft Internet Explorer
 ✦ Go to www.mozilla.com/firefox for Firefox
Have you ever wondered what all those buttons and drop-down lists at the top 
of your browser do? In the following sections, I explain Explorer and Firefox 
in more depth. According to my recent eBay statistics (from Sellathon), 70 
percent of the hits on my listings come from people using Internet Explorer, 
23 percent are from people using Firefox, and the balance come from users of 
Safari, MSN, and AOL. Read on while we browse together.
Perusing the menus
At the top of almost all Microsoft-enabled programs are standard drop-down 
lists that invoke various programs. Who’d ever think you’d need to use 
menus, given all the colorful icons that Internet Explorer provides? Well, the 
drop-down lists give you more in-depth access to the program’s capabilities. 
Tables 1-1 and 1-2 give you an overview of the various tasks you can perform 
from the menus.

A
s I’ve said before, the writer Thomas Wolfe was wrong: You can go 
home again — and again. At least with eBay you can! Day after day mil-
lions of people land at eBay’s home page without wearing out the welcome 
mat. The eBay home page is the front door to the most popular e-tailing site 
on the Internet.
Everything you need to know about navigating eBay begins right here. In 
this chapter, I give you the grand tour of the areas you can reach right from 
the home page with the help of links.
Homing In on the Home Page
The eBay home page is shown in Figure 2-1. It includes several key areas:
 ✦ A navigation bar at the top of the page with five eBay links that can zip 
you straight to any of the many eBay areas, as well as a powerful link 
right below the navigation bar
 ✦ An important link to eBay’s Live Help
 ✦ A list of links to auction categories
 ✦ Links to other eBay companies, and the 29 international eBay sites
 
At the top of almost every eBay page is a search box that helps you find 
items by title keywords.
 
Do not adjust your computer monitor. You’re not going crazy. You may 
notice that a link was on the eBay home page one day but gone the next day. 
The links on the eBay home page change to reflect what’s going on — not 
just on the site but also in the world.

Home-page links, the next generation
If you look carefully on the home page, you can see several other links 
that give you express service to several key parts of the site. Here are the 
highlights:
 ✦ From Our Sellers: Click the link to visit the featured items near the 
bottom of the page. Here at eBay, money talks pretty loudly, so a seller 
can pay extra to feature his or her listing and maybe it will land on the 
home page sometime during its run. eBay rotates six featured items 
throughout the day so that as many sellers as possible get a shot at 
being in the spotlight. When you click the From Our Sellers See All 
Featured Items link, you’re instantly beamed to eBay’s Featured Items 
section.
 
 You can find everything from Las Vegas vacations to Model-T Fords 
to diet products in the Home Page Featured Items section. Home Page 
Featured Items are not for mere mortals with small wallets. They’ve

been lifted to the exalted featured status because sellers shelled out lots 
of money to get them noticed. All you need to get your auction featured 
is $39.95 ($79.95 for Multiple Item listings), plus a second or two to click 
Home Page Featured Item on the Sell Your Item form.
 
 
 Bidding on these items works the same way as bidding on regular items.
 ✦ eBay Companies: In the link area at the bottom of the page, you will find 
links to the ever growing family of eBay — other eBay-owned companies. 
Currently the list includes:
 
• Half.com. Half.com is a long standing Internet site where sellers offer 
items at fixed prices. These items have a UPC, ISBN, or SKU. They 
are not collectible items. The items sold on Half.com are books, text-
books, music, movies, video games, and video game consoles.
 
• Kijiji. Free Classifieds? How cool is that? Kijiji (the Swahili word for 
village) is a Web site for local classified ads. These are same kind of 
ads that appear in the newspapers, but in this case, they’re online. 
Kijiji has sites for major cities in 29 countries, including the follow-
ing: United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, France, Taiwan, China, 
India, Japan, as well as Intoko, Turkey. To visit the site, go to www.
kijiji.com. See the Los Angeles area site in Figure 2-2.

• MicroPlace. “Invest wisely. End poverty.” This is something unique, 
a Web site of “microfinance” where you can invest in very small busi-
nesses from every corner of the world. And you actually have the 
potential to earn interest.
 
• PayPal. PayPal’s no secret. Visit Books II, III, and VI for the lowdown 
on the Internet’s leading payment processor for small business.

Homing In on the Home Page
 
• ProStores. An eBay company (at www.prostores.com) that will 
help you set up your own business on the Web. The stores are inte-
grated with eBay — although you can also make a similar connection 
with a regular hosted e-store. 
 
• Rent.com. Need to rent an apartment or home? Look no further than 
rent.com (www.rent.com). You’ll be able to find large numbers of 
rental properties in most cities in the Unites States. 
 
• Shopping.com. A Web-based price-comparison service. Shopping.
com has features to help shoppers make informed shopping deci-
sions. This site also has extensive product reviews and ratings from 
across the Web.
 
• Skype. A communication service where users download a software 
program that offers free calls over the Internet to other Skype users. 
In addition, they can make calls to landlines and mobile phones for a 
fee through SkypePro.
 
• StubHub. A service that acts as an online marketplace for buyers 
and sellers of tickets for sports, concerts, theater, and other live 
entertainment events. StubHub takes a 25 percent commission after 
the sale occurs (10 percent from the buyer and 15 percent from the 
seller).
 
• StumbleUpon. A Web browser plug-in that allows its users to dis-
cover and rate Web pages, photos, and videos. Web pages appear 
when the user clicks the “Stumble!” button on the browser’s toolbar. 
StumbleUpon selects which new page to display based on the user’s 
ratings of previous pages, ratings by their friends, and by the ratings 
of other users with similar interests.
 ✦ Global sites: Links you to eBay’s international auction sites. From a drop 
down menu, you may enter eBay Argentina, Austria, Australia, Belgium, 
Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, 
Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Poland, 
Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and 
(whew) the United Kingdom. The international sites are in the country’s 
native language. It might be a good place to practice your third-year 
French — or maybe not! Remember that after you leave eBay USA, 
you’re subject to the contractual and privacy laws of the country you’re 
visiting.
 
You may notice that the graphic links on the home page change from day to 
day — and even hour to hour. If you’re interested in the featured areas of 
the site, visit this page several times a day to see the entire array of special 
happenings on eBay.

Bottoming out
At the very bottom of the home page is an unassuming group of links provid-
ing more ways to get to some seriously handy pages. Here’s a guide to some 
of the links you’ll find:
 ✦ Feedback Forum: This link takes you to one of the most important spots 
on eBay. The Feedback Forum is where you can place feedback, respond 
to feedback left for you, and find out whether you’ve forgotten to place 
feedback on a transaction — all in one friendly location.
 ✦ Downloads: A link to eBay supplied software and toolbars. See Book II 
for more on these super tools.
 ✦ Gift certificates & Gift Cards: Send an eBay gift certificate for any spe-
cial occasion. You can print it yourself, or eBay will send it to any e-mail 
address you provide. The gift certificate is good for any item on the site, 
as long as the seller accepts PayPal.
 ✦ Jobs: Click here if you want to work for eBay instead of through eBay.
 ✦ Affiliates: If you have your own Web site and want to make a few bucks, 
click this link. If you sign up for the program and put a link to eBay on 
your Web page, eBay pays you for new users who signs up directly from 
your Web site (plus other bonuses). Click the link for the current details.
 ✦ Developers: If you develop software and would like to design some to 
use with eBay, you can join the developers’ network.
The eBay community is constantly changing. 
To help you get into the swing of things right 
away, eBay provides a couple of special boxes, 
smack dab in the middle of the home page, 
packed with links that take you to the latest 
eBay special events.
Even if the main promotion box doesn’t appeal 
to you, usually you can find some interesting 
links dotted around the home page without a 
headline. Also take a look at the small promo-
tion boxes below the featured items.
You can get there from here — lots of places, 
in fact:
 ✓ A rotating list of special-interest links 
changes at least once a day. (Half the fun is 
getting a closer look at pages you haven’t 
seen.)
 ✓ Special money-saving offers from third-
party vendors can be a boon if you’re on 
the lookout for a bargain.

Navigating eBay the Easy Way
 ✦ The eBay Shop: This link enables you to browse and buy eBay merchan-
dise from the eBay company store.
 ✦ eBay Mobile: eBay’s mobile service for cell phones. eBay.com 
designed just for small screens. Stay connected to eBay from your 
mobile phone browser. 
 ✦ About eBay: Click this link to find out about eBay the company and to 
get its press releases, company overview, and stock information. You 
can also find out about eBay community activities and charities — and 
even apply for a job with eBay.
 ✦ Announcements: Visit the General Announcements Board when you 
want to know about any late-breaking news.
 ✦ Security Center: This link takes you to a page where concerns about 
fraud and safety are addressed. Before buying or selling, it’s a good idea 
to check out the Security Center in Chapter 3.
 ✦ Policies: This is a good place to visit to brush up on the site’s policies 
and guidelines.
 ✦ Government Relations: Get active in the politics of online selling and 
buying. Join groups, send letters to congresspeople, make a difference!
 ✦ Site map: Here’s a second link to the eBay site map (the other link is 
above the navigation bar).
 ✦ Help: For some reason, eBay felt the need to put another help link at the 
bottom of the home page. Save yourself some scrolling and use the link 
on the navigation bar!
 
On other eBay pages, the bottom navigation bar looks a little different. It 
often includes even more links so that you can cruise the site quickly with-
out using the navigation bar.
Navigating eBay the Easy Way
The navigation bar is at the top of the eBay home page and lists five eBay 
links that take you directly to different eBay areas. Using the navigation bar 
is kind of like doing one-stop clicking. You can find this bar at the top of 
every page on eBay. Hovering over some of the links reveals a subnavigation 
list with links to other, related (and important) places.
 
Think of links as expressways to specific destinations. Click a link and, the 
next thing you know, you’re right where you want to be. You don’t even have 
to answer that annoying old question, “When are we gonna get there?” from 
the kids in the backseat.

Navigating eBay the Easy Way
Here, without further ado, are the five navigation bar links and where they 
take you:
 ✦ Buy: Takes you to the page that lists the top-level eBay categories and 
provides many buying-related links, links to the home page’s Featured 
Items (see Book III), and a Search window, as shown in Figure 2-3. You’ll 
find a mini-version of your My eBay page here, with drop-down links for 
your favorite searches, sellers, and categories. From this page, you have 
many ways of finding any one of the millions of items for sale on eBay.
 
Figure 2-3: 
The Buy 
page, linked 
from the 
navigation 
bar.
 
 
 You’ll find top-level categories on the Buy page. When you click to 
browse a category (for example, Books), you’ll be brought to a category 
hub page that lists the subcategories of that category. Click your desired 
subcategory, and you arrive at the subcategory page, where you see 
three yellow tabs at the top of the listings. These tabs offer you different 
viewing options to browse:
 
• All Items is the default setting for the page. This option delivers on 
its promise — you see all items, including auctions and those items 
that can be purchased immediately using Buy It Now.
 
• Click the Auctions tab to see only the items that are up for auction.
 
• The Buy It Now tab isolates a view of all items listed with the Buy It 
Now feature.
 
 Also, just below the tabs and above the listings is a Sort By drop-down 
box (see Figure 2-4) that allows you to sort your category results.

30
Navigating eBay the Easy Way
 
Figure 2-4:
 Just 
browsing a 
category on 
eBay.
 
 
 You can sort in these ways:
 
• Best Match is the default search option; it sorts the listings you see 
by their relevance. A listing’s relevance is based, in part, on past 
successful buyer behavior for similar items. The added reasoning 
behind this search is to identify sellers who provide great buying 
experiences and sellers who don’t, all gauged by the use of Detailed 
Seller Ratings and feedback ratings.
 
• Time: ending soonest allows you to view the category listings in time 
order, with the soonest to end on top. (This is the way I always sort 
when I’m browsing.)
 
• Time: newly listed shows the items that have recently been listed in 
the category.
 
• Time: ending today displays items that end in the next 24 hours and 
are displayed with the item ending soonest listed first.
 
• Time: new today is where you can get the jump on other bargain 
hunters and see the full listing of items launched within the past 24 
hours.
 
• Price + Shipping: Lowest first sorting can be deceiving. Many sellers 
list their items at an extremely low starting price to attract bidders. 
You may have to wade through twenty pages of ninety-nine cent 
items before you reach the dollar ones — a huge waste of time.

Book I
Chapter 2

Navigating eBay the Easy Way
 
• Price: Highest first and Price + Shipping: Highest first are good 
choices if you’re looking for high-ticket items in a category.
 
• Distance: nearest first. If you want to buy a large item (sofa? refrig-
erator? car?) and would rather save on shipping or want to drop by 
to inspect the item, this is the best search for you.
 
 You can also search through the category. Type some keywords in the 
search box to find, for example, a particular book. Because more than 20 
million items are up for auction at any given time, finding just one (say, a 
book on antique Vermont milk cans) is no easy task.
 ✦ Sell: Takes you to the first stop of the Sell Your Item form that you fill 
out to start your listings. (More on how to sell in Book III.) You also see 
a bunch of links that can take you to a zillion different places on eBay. 
Stop by someday when you have a lot of time on your hands.
 ✦ My eBay: Takes you to your personal My eBay page, where you keep 
track of your buying and selling activities, account information, and 
favorite categories (more about My eBay in Chapter 3).
 ✦ Community: Takes you to a page where you can find the latest news 
and announcements, chat with fellow traders in the eBay community, 
find charity auctions, and discover more about eBay. Several boxes in 
the subnavigation bar correspond to the links on the page (more on the 
eBay community in Chapter 8).
 ✦ Help: Opens the eBay Help Center overview page (which consists of a 
search box in which you can type your query) and links for help topics.
Below the eBay navigation bar (on most eBay pages) are powerful links that 
are just as important as the links on the navigation bar:
 ✦ eBay Logo: Takes you directly to the eBay home page. Use this link from 
any other page when you need to get back to the home page right away.
 ✦ Categories: When you click here, there’s a drop-down menu for all 
eBay’s top-level categories.
 ✦ Motors: Takes you to the eBay Motors site. Here, you can find links that 
connect you to the largest vehicle sales site on the Web.
 ✦ Stores. To view or browse eBay stores you click here.
 ✦ Site map: Provides you with a bird’s-eye view of the eBay world. Every 
top-level (or main) link available on eBay is listed here. If you’re ever 
confused about finding a specific area, try the site map first. If a top-level 
link isn’t listed here, it’s not on eBay — yet.
 ✦ Sign In/Sign Out: This link, which is below the navigation bar, toggles 
between Sign In and Sign Out depending on your sign-in status. This is 
an important link, and I remind you about it throughout the book. When 
you’re signed in, it reads Hello, followed by your user ID.

Maneuvering the Categories
Maneuvering the Categories
So how does eBay keep track of the millions of items up for sale at any given 
moment? The brilliant minds at eBay decided to group items into nice, neat 
little storage systems called categories. The home page lists most of the main 
categories, but eBay also lists tens of thousands of subcategories, ranging 
from Antiques to Weird Stuff. And don’t ask how many sub-subcategories 
(categories within categories) eBay has — I can’t count that high.
Well, okay, I could list all the categories and subcategories currently avail-
able on eBay — if you wouldn’t mind squinting at a dozen pages of really 
small, eye-burning text. But a category browse is an adventure that’s unique 
for each individual, and I wouldn’t think of depriving you of it. Suffice it 
to say that if you like to hunt around for that perfect something, you’re in 
browsing heaven now.
Here’s how to navigate around the categories:
 1. From the drop-down menu, click the category that interests you, such 
as Books or DVDs & Movies.
 
 You’re transported to that category’s page. You see categories and sub-
categories listed next to each heading. Happy hunting.
 
 
 If you don’t find a category that interests you among those on the home 
page, simply click the Buy button on the navigation bar, and you’re off 
to the main Categories page. You get not only a pretty impressive page 
of main categories and subcategories, but also a short list of featured 
auctions — and links to them all.
 
 If you really and truly want to see a list of all categories and subcat-
egories (see Figure 2-5), click See All Categories at the bottom of the 
category list on the main Buy page. Or, if you want to make it easy on 
yourself, go directly to the following:
listings.ebay.com/ /ListingCategoryList
 2. After the category page appears, find a subcategory below the main 
category title that interests you. Click the subcategory, and keep dig-
ging through the sub-subcategories until you find what you want.
 
 For example, if you’re looking for items honoring your favorite televi-
sion show, click the Entertainment Memorabilia category or the DVDs & 
Movies category. Note that the Entertainment Memorabilia category has 
many links, including the Television Memorabilia subcategory. Below 
the Television Memorabilia link, you’ll see links to these subcategories: 
Ads, Flyers, Apparel, Clippings, Photos, Pins, Buttons, Posters, Press 
Kits, Props, Scripts, Wardrobe, and Other. Click the link that appeals to 
you and you’re off on a shopping spree.

Maneuvering the Categories
 
Figure 2-5: 
Lots and 
lots and 
lots of sub-
categories.
 
 3. When you find an item that interests you, click the item and the full 
listing page pops up on your screen.
 
 Congratulations — you’ve just navigated through several million items 
to find that one TV-collectible item that caught your attention. (Pardon 
me while I bid on that Lily Munster — Yvonne DeCarlo — signed pic-
ture.) You can instantly return to the home page by clicking its link at 
the top of the page (or return to the listings page by repeatedly clicking 
the Back button at the top of your browser).
 
Near the bottom of every subcategory or search-results page, you can see a 
list of numbers. The numbers are page numbers, and you can use them to 
fast-forward through all the items in that subcategory. So, if you feel like 
browsing around page 8 without going through 8 pages individually, just 
click number 8; you’re presented with the items on that page (their listings, 
actually). Happy browsing.
 
If you’re a bargain hunter by habit, you may find some pretty weird stuff while 
browsing the categories and subcategories of items at eBay — some of it 
super-cheap and some of it just cheap. There’s even a Weird Stuff category — 
no kidding! Remember that (as with any marketplace) you’re responsible 
for finding out as much as possible about an item before you buy — and 
definitely before you bid. So if you’re the type who sometimes can’t resist a 
good deal, ask yourself what you plan to do with the pile of stuff you can get 
for 15 cents — and ask yourself now, before it arrives on your doorstep. 
(Chapter 6 offers more information on savvy bidding techniques.)

Exploring Home Page Search Options
Exploring Home Page Search Options
There’s an old Chinese expression that says, “Every journey begins with the 
first eBay search.” Okay, so I updated the quote. They’re very wise words 
nonetheless. You can start a search from the home page in one of two ways:
 ✦ Use the search box. It’s right there at the top of the home page (and 
most eBay pages), and it’s a fast way of finding item listings.
 ✦ Use the Advanced Search link (which is next to the search box). This 
link will take you to the sophisticated Search area, where you can do all 
kinds of specialized searches.
To launch a title search from the home page, follow these steps:
 1. In the search box, type no more than a few keywords that describe the 
item you’re looking for.
 
 Refer to Figure 2-1 to see the search box.
 2. Click the Search button.
 
 The results of your search appear in a matter of seconds.
You can type just about anything in the search box and get some informa-
tion. Say you’re looking for Star Trek memorabilia. If so, you’re not alone. 
The original television show premiered on September 8, 1966, and even 
though it was canceled in 1969 because of low ratings, Star Trek has become 
one of the most successful science-fiction franchises in history. You can use 
the search box on the eBay home page to find all sorts of Star Trek stuff. I 
just ran a search and found around 13,762 items in numerous categories on 
eBay with Star Trek in their titles.
Try the Advanced Search link under the search box to narrow down your 
search. This link takes you to the basic search page, which has some power-
ful features (explained in Book II, Chapter 1).
 
When you search for popular items at eBay (a classic example is Star Trek 
memorabilia), you may get inundated with thousands of auctions that match 
your search criteria. Even if you’re traveling at warp speed, you could spend 
hours checking each auction individually. (“Scotty, we need more power 
now!”) If you’re pressed for time like the rest of us, eBay has not-so-mysterious 
ways for you to narrow down your search to make finding a specific item 
much more manageable. Take a look at Figure 2-6 to see the way eBay helps 
break things down in that Star Trek search. Also, turn to Chapter 4 for insider 
techniques that can help you slim down those searches and beef up those 
results.

T
he prospect of getting started on eBay is exciting — and daunting. 
Perhaps you’ve visited the eBay Web site once or twice with the idea that 
you might buy something. Maybe you’ve heard your friends talk about the 
things they’ve bought. Did you look up something simple, such as a golf club? 
Did eBay come up with several thousand listings? Or maybe you figured you’d 
get smart and narrow the search down to a 3 iron, but you still got more than 
a thousand listings?
Did you consider buying something and then just left the site, for fear you’d 
get ripped off? eBay works much better for me than any quasi-convenient 
TV shopping channel because there’s no overly made up huckster telling me 
how great I’d look in the outfit on the screen (displayed on a size-4 model). 
On eBay, you have the opportunity to give an item a leisurely once-over, 
read the description and terms, and click a link to ask the seller a question 
before you bid or buy. eBay’s as simple as that. If you don’t like the seller’s 
response, you can just go on to the next seller. That’s the great thing about 
eBay. There’s always another seller — and always another item.
Registering on eBay
You can browse eBay all you want without registering, but before you 
transact any sort of business on eBay, you must register. I recommend 
registering while you’re reading this book.

38
Registering on eBay
You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to register at eBay. The only hard-
and-fast rule is that you have to be 18 or older. Don’t worry; the Age Police 
won’t come to your house to card you — they have other ways to discreetly 
ensure that you’re at least 18 years old. (Hint: Credit cards do more than sat-
isfy account charges.)
If you’re having a momentary brain cramp and you’ve forgotten your age, 
just think back to your childhood. If your first memory is watching The 
Animaniacs and Chip ’n’ Dale Rescue Rangers on TV, you’re in. Head to the 
eBay home page and register. The entire process takes only a few minutes.
 
During the early days of online trading, I was selling Star Trek memorabilia 
on Auction Web (the initial eBay site) and doing quite well. I ran into William 
Shatner (Captain Kirk of Star Trek fame) at a marketing meeting in mid-1997. 
Anxious to let him know how well I was doing with my merchandise online, I 
tried to explain Auction Web. Shatner scoffed, “No one will ever make any 
money on the Internet.” (Really, I have witnesses — remember, this is the 
future Mr. Priceline.com.) Ah, well.
Before you can sign up, you have to be connected to the Web, so now’s the 
time to fire up your computer. After you open your Internet browser, you’re 
ready to sign up. In the address box of your browser, type www.ebay.com 
and press Enter.
Your next stop is the eBay home page. Right there, where you can’t miss it, 
is the Register button — it’s “fast and free!” Click this button and let the sign-
up process begin. You can get to the Registration form also by clicking the 
register link next to the eBay logo at the top of the page.
When you’re at the Registration form, you go through a four-step process. 
Here’s an overview:
 1. Enter the basic required info.
 2. Read and accept the User Agreement.
 3. Confirm your e-mail address.
 4. Breeze through the optional information.
The following sections fill you in on all the details.
You register on eBay through an encrypted (supersecret) connection called 
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). You can tell because the normal http at the 
beginning of the Web address is now https and a small closed padlock 
appears at the bottom-left (or bottom-right) corner of your screen.

Book I
Chapter 3
Signing Up and 
Getting Started
39
Registering on eBay
The padlock icon means that eBay has moved you to a secure place on their 
site that is safe from unauthorized people seeing or receiving your informa-
tion. Your information is treated with the highest security and you can fill 
out these forms with the utmost level of confidence. I could tell you how SSL 
works, but instead I’ll just give you the bottom line: It does work, so trust me 
and use it. The more precautions eBay (and you) take, the harder it is for 
some hyper-caffeinated high-school kid to get into your data.
Filling in required information
After you click the Register button, you go to the first registration page. At 
the top of the page, eBay assures you that the registration process is easy 
and asks you to fill in some required information (see Figure 3-1).
 
Figure 3-1: 
Some of the 
required 
information 
for your 
eBay 
registration.
 
To get started, follow these steps:
 1. eBay needs to know stuff about you. Enter the following information:
 
• Your full name, address, and primary telephone number. eBay keeps 
this information on file in case the company (or a member who is a 
transaction partner) needs to contact you.
 
• Your e-mail address (yourname@myISP.com).
 
 
 If you register with an anonymous e-mail service such as Yahoo!, GMail,

authentication. You must provide valid credit-card information for iden-
tification purposes. Your information is protected by eBay’s privacy 
policy, and your credit card won’t be charged.

 After you input your personal information, you’re ready to create your 
eBay persona.
 2. Scroll down the page to type your new eBay user ID.
 
 Don’t strain your brain too much right now over your choice of user ID. 
You can change your user ID once every 30 days. (See “Selecting Your 
User ID,” later in this chapter, for some tips on selecting your user ID.) 
If your chosen ID is already taken, eBay has a handy tool to help you 
select another one, as shown in Figure 3-2.

eBay’s 
instant 
user ID 
suggestion 
form.
 
 3. Choose a password, enter it in the Create Password box, and then type 
it a second time in the Re-enter Password box to confirm it.
 
 The best passwords for eBay or any Web site are more than six char-
acters long and include a combination of letters and numbers. Never 
use your user ID, name, pet’s name, address, or anything that may be 
easily known by others. C’mon, get a little cagey. For more information 
on choosing your password, see “Picking a Pickproof Password,” later in 
this chapter.
 4. Create your secret question and input the answer.
 
 eBay uses the secret question you select here as a security test should 
you need help to remember your password. There are six choices. I 
suggest you do not select the “What is your mother’s maiden name?” 
question because banks and financial institutions often use this question 
for identification. Guard your mother’s maiden name and don’t give it 
out to anyone blithely. Select one of the other questions and fill in the 
answer. For more info on secret questions and their power, visit Book 
IX, Chapter 4.
 5. Type your date of birth.
 
 eBay needs to have your birth date. This is for two reasons. First, they 
want to be sure that you are of legal age to do business on eBay, and 
second, they may want to send you a nice birthday e-mail!
 6. Make sure all the info you entered is correct, and then go to the not-
so-fine print.

 Think back to your second-grade teacher, who kept saying, “Class, check 
your work.” Remember that? She’s still right! Review your answers.
 
 
 If eBay finds a glitch in your registration, such as an incorrect area code 
or ZIP code, you’ll see a warning message on the next page. This is part 
of eBay’s security system to ward off fraudulent registrations. Use the 
Back button to correct the information — if you put in a wrong e-mail 
address, for example, eBay has no way of contacting you. So you won’t 
hear a peep from eBay regarding your registration until you go through 
the entire process all over again.
 7. Read the not-so-fine print and click Register.
 
 The section below will tip you in on what to expect in the “fine print.”
 
It’s safe to use your personal e-mail address for eBay registration. You will 
not be put on any spurious e-mail lists.
Sellers must register on eBay with a credit or debit card to pay for their eBay 
fees. Buyers do not register with a credit or debit card — unless they choose 
for their e-mail address one of the anonymous e-mail address services such 
as Hotmail or Yahoo! Mail, which do not verify users. Then they must reg-
ister a credit card for identification. The credit card is not charged. If you’d 
rather not use a credit card, you may alternatively choose ID Verify. Read 
about ID Verify further on.
 
 If you change your user ID, an icon of a little blue character changing into a 
gold one appears next to your user ID. This icon stays next to your user ID 
for 30 days. Double-check when you see others with this icon. The world 
being what it is, they may have just changed their user IDs to mask a bad 
reputation. They can’t hide it completely, though. You can find the dirt on 
anyone on eBay by reading their feedback profile. (For more information on 
feedback, see Chapter 7 in this book.)
eBay keeps most personal information secret. 
The basics (your name, phone number, city, 
and state) go out only to answer the specific 
request of another registered eBay user (if 
you are involved in a transaction with that 
person), law enforcement, or members of the 
eBay Verified Rights Owner program (eBay’s 
copyright-watchdog program). Other users 
may need your basic access info for several 
reasons — a seller may want to verify your 
location, get your phone number to call you 
regarding your auction, or double-check who 
you are. If somebody does request your info, 
you get an e-mail from eBay giving you the 
name, phone number, city, and state of the 
person making the request. Just one more 
reason you need to keep the information on 
your My eBay page up to date. If you don’t, you 
risk being banished from the site.
Don’t tell anyone, but your info is safe on eBay

Registering on eBay
Do you solemnly swear?
After you fill in your required information and scroll down, you should click 
the link to see the eBay User Agreement and Privacy Policy. At this page, you 
take an oath to keep eBay safe for democracy and commerce. You promise 
to play well with others, to not cheat, and to follow the golden rule. No, 
you’re not auditioning for a superhero club, but don’t ever forget that eBay 
takes this stuff seriously. You can be kicked off eBay or worse. (Can you say 
“Federal investigation”?)
Be sure to read the User Agreement thoroughly when you register. So that 
you don’t have to put down this riveting book to read the legalese right this 
minute, I provide the nuts and bolts here:
 ✦ You understand that every transaction is a legally binding contract. 
(Click the User Agreement link at the bottom of any eBay page for the 
current eBay rules and regulations.)
 ✦ You agree that you can pay for the items you buy and the eBay fees that 
you incur.
 ✦ You understand that you’re responsible for paying any taxes.
 ✦ You’re aware that if you sell prohibited items, eBay can forward your 
personal information to law enforcement for further investigation.
 ✦ eBay makes clear that it is just a venue, which means it’s a place where 
people with similar interests can meet, greet, and do business.
When everything goes well, the eBay Web site is like a school gym that 
opens for Saturday swap meets. At the gym, if you don’t play by the rules, 
you can get tossed out. But if you don’t play by the rules at eBay, the venue 
gets un-gymlike in a hurry. But fair’s fair; eBay keeps you posted by e-mail of 
any updates in the User Agreement.
If you’re a stickler for fine print, head to these Internet addresses for all the 
Ps and Qs of the latest policies:
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/overview.html
Before you can proceed, you have to click a check box that indicates you 
really, really understand what it means to be an eBay user — and agree to 
the terms. Then, because I know that you (as a law-abiding eBay member) 
will have no problem following the rules, go ahead and click the Continue 
button at the bottom of the page — which takes you to a screen stating that 
eBay is sending you an e-mail. You’re almost finished.

It must be true if you have it in writing
After you accept the User Agreement, the screen notifies you that an e-mail 
has been sent to the e-mail address you supplied during your registration. It 
takes eBay less than a minute to e-mail you a confirmation notice. When you 
receive the confirmation e-mail, click the Complete eBay Registration link 
to continue your registration. If your e-mail doesn’t support links, go to this 
address:
cgi4.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RegisterConfirmCode
After you reconnect with eBay and it knows your e-mail address is active, 
you’ll be heartily congratulated, as shown in Figure 3-3.
 
Figure 3-3: 
It’s time 
to start 
dealing!
 
 
In the unlikely event that you don’t receive your eBay registration confirma-
tion e-mail within 24 hours, your e-mail address most likely contains an 
error. At this point, the customer-support folks can help you complete the 
registration process. Go to the following address:
https://scgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?VAppEma&action=confirm
code&resentemail=1
and enter your e-mail address. Click Submit. You will receive another e-mail 
with a special one-time confirmation password.
 
If, for some reason (brain cramp is a perfectly acceptable excuse), you 
incorrectly type in the wrong e-mail address, you have to start the registration 
process all over again with a different user ID (eBay holds the previous ID for 
30 days). If you run into a snag, you can click the Live Help button that 
appears on the home page. See Figure 3-4 for my Live Help discussion.

Your license to deal (almost)
You are now officially a newbie, or eBay rookie. The only problem is that 
you’re still at the window-shopping level. If you’re ready to go from window 
shopper to item seller, just click the Sell button in the navigation bar. You’ll 
have to fill out a few more forms, and before you know it, you can start 
running your own auctions at eBay.
 
 
Until you’ve been a member of eBay for 30 days, a picture of a beaming, 
golden cartoonlike icon is next to your user ID wherever it appears on the 
site. This doesn’t mean you’ve been converted into a golden robot; the icon 
merely indicates to other eBay users that you’re new to eBay.
Now that you’re a full-fledged, officially registered member of the eBay 
community, you may see an eBay pop-up window, giving you the option to 
provide more information about yourself. These optional questions allow 
you to fill in your self-portrait for your new pals at eBay.
 
Although eBay doesn’t share member information with anyone, you don’t 
have to answer the optional questions if you don’t want to.
The following points show you the optional questions eBay asks. You decide 
what you feel comfortable divulging and what you want to keep personal. 
eBay asks for this information because the company wants a better picture 
of who is using its Web site. In marketing mumbo-jumbo, this stuff is called 
demographics — statistics that characterize a group of people who make up 
a community. In this case, it’s the eBay community. 
Here is the optional information you can provide:
 ✦ Sex: Okay, it really asks you to indicate your gender by selecting a Male/ 
Female radio button set. (But starting the sentence off with sex really got 
your attention, didn’t it?)

Picking a Pickproof Password
 ✦ Annual household income: eBay states that this info is kept anonymous, 
but I think it’s too personal. If you’re not comfortable with it, skip it.
 ✦ Your highest completed education level: Again, if this is too personal, 
leave this area blank.
After selecting your responses from the drop-down box, you can click 
Submit. Or you can click Answer Later, and the pop-up box will reappear for 
your response later in your eBay dealings. If you don’t want to answer any of 
the demographic queries, click Please Don’t Ask Me Again, at the bottom of 
the pop-up window.
Picking a Pickproof Password
Choosing a good password is not as easy (but is twice as important) as it 
may seem. Whoever has your password can (in effect) “be you” at eBay — 
running auctions, bidding on auctions, and leaving possibly-litigious feedback 
for others. Basically, such an impostor can ruin your eBay career — and 
possibly cause you serious financial grief.
 
Many passwords can be cracked by the right person in a matter of seconds. 
Your goal is to set a password that takes too much of the hackers’ time. With 
the number of available users on eBay or PayPal, odds are they’ll go to the 
next potential victim’s password rather than spend too many minutes (or 
even hours) trying to crack yours.
As with any online password, you should follow these commonsense rules to 
protect your privacy:
 ✦ Don’t choose anything too obvious, such as your birthday, your first 
name, or (never use this) your Social Security number. (Hint: If it’s too 
easy to remember, it’s probably too easy to crack.)
 ✦ Do make things tough on the bad guys — combine numbers and letters 
(use uppercase and lowercase) or create nonsensical words.
 ✦ Don’t give out your password to anyone — it’s like giving away the keys 
to the front door of your house.
 ✦ Do change your password immediately if you ever suspect someone has 
it. You can change your password, by going to the Account Information 
area of your My eBay page or to the following address:
signin.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.
dll?ChangePasswordAndCreateHint
 ✦ Do change your password every few months just to be on the safe side.

Selecting Your User ID
 
For more information on passwords and other security stuff, check out 
Book IX.
Selecting Your User ID
Making up a user ID is always a pleasant chore. If you’ve never liked your real 
name or never had a nickname, here’s your chance to correct that situation. 
Choose an ID that tells a little about you. Of course, if your interests change, 
you may regret too narrow a user ID.
You can call yourself just about anything, but remember that this ID is how 
other eBay users will know you. Here are some guidelines:
 ✦ Don’t use a name that would embarrass your mother.
 ✦ Don’t use a name with a negative connotation, such as scam-guy. If 
people don’t trust you, they won’t buy from you.
 ✦ Don’t use a name that’s too weird, you know, something like baby-
vampire-penguin. People may chuckle, but they may also question your 
sanity.
 ✦ eBay doesn’t allow spaces in user IDs, so make sure that the ID makes 
sense when putting two or more words together. A friend of mine 
intended to register as “gang of one.” She forgot the hyphens, so her ID 
reads gangofone.
 
If you’re dying to have several short words as your user ID, you can use 
underscores or hyphens to separate them, as in super-shop-a-holic. And if 
you sign in to eBay for the whole day, you won’t have to worry about repeat-
edly typing a complicated ID.
 
You can change your user ID once every 30 days if you want to, but I don’t 
recommend it because people come to know you by your user ID. If you 
change your ID, your past does play tagalong and attaches itself to the new 
ID. But if you change your user ID too many times, people may think you’re 
trying to hide something.
Nevertheless, to change your user ID, click the My eBay link, which appears 
at the top of most eBay pages. From your My eBay Summary page, click the 
My Account: Personal Information link, scroll to the User ID area, and click 
the Change link. Fill in the boxes, and then click the Change User ID button. 
You now have a new eBay identity.
eBay also has some user ID rules to live by:
 ✦ No offensive names (such as &*#@guy).

Book I
Chapter 3
Signing Up and 
Getting Started
47
Signing In to Deal
 ✦ No names with eBay in them. (It makes you look like you work for eBay, 
and eBay takes a dim view of that.)
 ✦ No names with & (even if you do have both looks&brains).
 ✦ No names with @ (such as @Aboy).
 ✦ No symbols, such as the greater than or less than symbol (> <), and no 
consecutive underscores (__).
 ✦ No IDs that begin with an e followed by numbers, an underscore, a 
hyphen, a period, or dot (as in dot.com).
 ✦ No names of one letter (such as Q from Star Trek).
When you choose your user ID, make sure that it isn’t a good clue for your 
password. For example, if you use Natasha as your user ID, don’t choose 
Boris as your password. Even Bullwinkle could figure that one out.
 
Hey, AOL users, this one’s for you. If you have Internet e-mail blocked, you 
need to update your AOL Mail Controls to receive e-mail from eBay. To do 
so, enter the AOL keyword Mail Controls.
Signing In to Deal
You don’t have to wear one of those tacky “Hello, my name is” stickers on 
your shirt, but you and several million other folks will be roaming around 
eBay’s online treasure trove. eBay needs to know who’s who when we’re 
browsing. So, keeping that in mind, sign in when you first go on to the eBay 
Web site, please!
By going to the Sign In page and signing in, you don’t have to enter your user 
ID when you bid or post items for sale. The Sign In page also takes you to a 
link that allows you to change your sign in or My eBay preferences. 
If you’re the only one who uses your computer, be sure to select the box 
that says “Keep me signed in on this computer unless I sign out.” This way, 
you’re signed in to eBay every time you go to the site for an entire day. The 
sign-in process places a cookie (a techno-related piece-of-code thingy) on 
your computer that remains a part of your browser until you sign out. If 
you don’t select the box, you will be signed in only while you’re on the site. 
If there’s no activity for 40 minutes or you close your browser, the cookie 
expires and you have to sign in again.
Here’s how to get to the eBay Sign In page and sign in:
 1. Click the Sign In link next to the eBay logo on the eBay home page.
 2. Enter your user ID and password.

48
Verifying Your ID
 
 
 If you’re on your home computer and want to make your eBay-ing easier, 
click the box next to “Keep me signed in for today.” Your password will 
be saved in the browser until you sign out, even if you disconnect from 
the Internet, close your browser, or turn off your computer.
 3. Click Sign In Securely.
You’re now signed in to eBay and can travel the site with ease. You may go 
to your My eBay page’s eBay Preferences to tell eBay where you want to 
land after you sign in.
Verifying Your ID
During the later years of the Cold War, the late President Ronald Reagan 
said, “Trust but verify.” The President’s advice made sense for dealing with 
the Soviet Union in those days, and it makes good sense with your dealings 
at eBay, too! (Even if you’re not dealing in nuclear warheads.)
To show other eBay members that you’re an honest type, you can buy a 
“trust but verify” option, known as ID Verify, from eBay for five bucks. The 
process is simple, and it allows new users of eBay to show other members 
that they are earnest in their desire to become responsible members of the 
community. A company called Equifax verifies your identity by asking for the 
following information:
 ✦ Name
 ✦ Address
 ✦ Phone number
 ✦ Social Security Number
 ✦ Driver’s license information
 ✦ Date of birth
Equifax matches the info you give to what’s in its humungous database — 
and presents you with a list of questions from your credit file that only you 
should know the answer to. Equifax may ask you about any loans you have, 
for example, or what kinds of credit cards you own (and how many).
 
Equifax sends only the results of its test (that is, whether you pass the test) 
to eBay — and not the answers to the private financial questions it asks you. 
Equifax doesn’t modify or add information you provide to any of its databases.

Book I
Chapter 3
Signing Up and 
Getting Started
49
eBay Is Watching Over You
Equifax’ questions are meant to protect you against anyone else who may come 
along and try to steal this information from you and assume your identity. The 
questions aren’t a credit check, and your creditworthiness is never called into 
question. This info simply verifies that you are who you say you are.
 
 
If you pass the test and Equifax can verify that you are who you say you are 
and not your evil twin (can you say “Mini Me”?), you get a cool icon by your 
name. If any of your contact information changes, you have to reapply for a 
new ID Verify logo.
Although you can feel secure knowing that a user who’s verified is indeed 
who he or she claims to be, you still have no guarantee that he or she is 
not going to turn out to be a no-goodnik (or, for that matter, a well-meaning 
financial airhead) during auction transactions.
Aside from the identification feature, ID Verify offers other benefits to 
buyers. ID Verify allows you to
 ✦ List with the Buy It Now or the Best Offer options.
 ✦ List using Fixed Price or Multiple Item formats.
 ✦ Bid above $15,000 (hey, Big Spender!)
 ✦ Become a seller (without putting a credit card on file).
 ✦ Access the Mature Audiences category.
 
You should consider all of eBay’s programs for protecting you from prob-
lematic transactions and people, but I think the undisputed heavyweight 
champ for finding out who someone really is and keeping you out of trouble 
is the first program eBay created. That’s right, folks; feedback can show you 
other eBay members’ track records and give you the best information on 
whether you want to do business with them or take a pass. Feedback is espe-
cially effective if you analyze it with eBay’s other protection programs. I sug-
gest taking the time to read all about feedback in Chapter 7 of this minibook.
eBay Is Watching Over You
The Security Center is where eBay’s Trust and Safety gurus focus on protect-
ing the Web site from members who aren’t playing by the rules. Through 
this department, eBay issues warnings and policy changes — and in some 
cases, it gives eBay bad guys the old heave-ho.

50
eBay Is Watching Over You
You can find eBay’s Security Center by clicking the Security Center link at 
the bottom of most eBay. Trust and Safety’s Security Center page is more 
than just a link to policies and information. It also connects you with a group 
of eBay staffers who handle complaints, field incoming tips about possible 
infractions, investigate infractions, and dole out warnings and suspensions 
via e-mail in response to the tips.
eBay staffers look at complaints on a case-by-case basis, in the order they 
receive them. Most complaints they receive are about these problems:
 ✦ Shill bidders (see the section on “Selling abuses” in this chapter)
 ✦ Feedback issues and abuses (see the section on “Feedback abuses” in 
this chapter)
 
Keep in mind that eBay is a community of people, most of whom have never 
met each other. No matter what you buy or sell on eBay, don’t expect eBay 
transactions to be any safer than buying or selling from a complete stranger. 
If you go in with this attitude and stay personable-but-vigilant, you won’t be 
disappointed.
Staying notified about the rules
For an up-close online look at eBay’s rules and regulations, click the Policies 
link (which is at the bottom of most eBay pages) and then read the User 
Agreement. (The agreement is revised regularly, so check it often.)
Another helpful link is the FAQ (frequently-asked questions) page for the 
User Agreement, which explains the legalese in clearer English. To visit the 
FAQ page, go to
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/everyone-ov.html
If you plan on being an active eBay member, it’s probably worth your while 
to opt-in for eBay’s User Agreement update e-mail. To do so, go to your My 
eBay page and click the eBay Preferences link in the My Account area. You’ll 
see your Notification Preferences. To make a change, click View/Change. 
At this point, you’re asked to type your password — this is to protect your 
security on eBay. Then you go to the magic page where you can change all 
your eBay notification preferences, including the User Agreement update.
Abuses you should report to Trust and Safety
Before you even consider blowing the whistle by reporting someone who 
(gasp!) gave you negative feedback to Trust and Safety, make sure that what 
you’re encountering is actually a misuse of eBay. Some behavior isn’t nice 
(no argument there), but it also isn’t a violation of eBay rules — in which 
case, eBay can’t do much about it. The following sections list the primary 
reasons you may start Trust and Safety investigations.

Selling abuses
If you’re on eBay long enough, you’re bound to find an abuse of the service. 
It may happen on an auction you’re bidding on, or it may be one of the sell-
ers who compete with your auctions. Be a good community member and be 
on the lookout for the following:
 ✦ Shill bidding: A seller uses multiple user IDs to bid, or has accomplices 
place bids to boost the price of his or her auction items. eBay investiga-
tors look for six telltale signs, including a single bidder putting in a really 
high bid, a bidder with really low feedback but a really high number 
of bids on items, a bidder with low feedback who has been an eBay 
member for a while but who’s never won an auction, or excessive bids 
between two users.
 ✦ Auction interception: An unscrupulous user, pretending to be the actual 
seller, contacts the winner to set up terms of payment and shipping in 
an effort to make off with the buyer’s payment. This violation can be 
easily avoided by paying with PayPal directly through the eBay site.
 ✦ Fee avoidance: A user reports a lower-than-actual final price or illegally 
submits a Final Value Fee credit. (Final Value Fee credits are explained in 
Book III.)
 ✦ Bid manipulation: A user, with the help of accomplices, enters dozens 
of phony bids to make the auction appear to have a lot of bidding action. 
Let the experts at eBay decide on this one; but you may wonder if loads 
of bids come in rapid succession but the price moves very little.
Bidding abuses
If you want to know more about bidding in general, see Chapter 6. Here’s a 
list of bidding abuses that eBay wants to know about:
 ✦ Bid shielding: Two users work in tandem. User A, with the help of 
accomplices, intentionally bids an unreasonably high amount and then 
retracts the bid in the closing moments of the auction — leaving a lower 
bid (which the offender or an accomplice places) as the winning bid.
 ✦ Bid siphoning: Users send e-mail to bidders of a current auction to offer 
the same merchandise for a lower price elsewhere.
 ✦ Auction interference: Users warn other bidders through e-mail to stay 
clear of a seller during a current auction, presumably to decrease the 
number of bids and keep the prices low.
 ✦ Bid manipulation (or invalid bid retraction): A user bids a ridiculously 
high amount, raising the next highest bidder to the maximum bid. The 
manipulator then retracts the bid and rebids slightly over the previous 
high bidder’s maximum.

52
eBay Is Watching Over You
 ✦ Unpaid item (nonpaying bidder): No matter how eBay chooses to 
couch it by fancy verbiage, I call these bidders deadbeats. The bottom 
line is that these people win auctions but never pay.
 ✦ Unwelcome bidder: A user bids on a specific seller’s auction despite 
the seller’s warning that he or she won’t accept that user’s bid (as in the 
case of not selling internationally and receiving international bids). This 
practice is impolite and obnoxious. If you want to ban specific bidders 
from your auctions, you can exclude them in your My eBay area links.
Feedback abuses
All you have at eBay is your reputation, and that reputation is made up of your 
feedback history. eBay takes any violation of its feedback system seriously. 
Because eBay’s feedback is transaction related, unscrupulous eBay members 
find that manipulating the system is much harder. Here’s a checklist of 
feedback abuses that you should report to Trust and Safety:
 ✦ Feedback extortion: A member threatens to post negative feedback if 
another eBay member doesn’t follow through on some unwarranted 
demand.
 ✦ Personal exposure: A member leaves feedback for a user that exposes 
personal information that doesn’t relate to transactions on eBay.
 
 
✦ –4.3 feedback: Any user reaching a net feedback score of –4.3 is subject 
to suspension.
Identity abuses
Who you are on eBay is as important as what you sell (or buy). eBay 
monitors the identities of its members closely — and asks that you report 
any great pretenders in this area to Trust and Safety. Here’s a checklist of 
identity abuses:
 ✦ Identity misrepresentation: A user claims to be an eBay staff member or 
another eBay user, or registers under the name of another user.
 ✦ False or missing contact information: A user deliberately registers with 
false contact information or an invalid e-mail address.
 ✦ Underage: A user falsely claims to be 18 or older. (You must be at least 
18 to enter into a legally binding contract.)
 ✦ Dead or invalid e-mail address: When e-mails bounce repeatedly from 
a user’s registered e-mail address, chances are good that the address is 
dead. Usually return e-mail indicates that the address is unknown.
 ✦ Contact information: One user publishes another user’s contact 
information on the eBay site.

Operational abuses
If you see someone trying to interfere with eBay’s operation, eBay staffers 
want you to tell them about it. Here are two roguish operational abuses:
 ✦ Hacking: A user purposely interferes with eBay’s computer operations 
(for example, by breaking into unauthorized files).
 ✦ Spamming: The user sends unsolicited commercial e-mail to eBay users.
Miscellaneous abuses
The following are additional problems that you should alert eBay about:
 ✦ A user is threatening physical harm to another eBay member.
 ✦ A person uses racist, obscene, or harassing language in a public area 
of eBay.
 
For a complete list of offenses and how eBay runs each investigation, go to 
the following address:

See the next section for information on how to report violators to eBay.
Reporting abuses
If you suspect someone of abusing eBay’s rules and regulations, go to the 
Security Center (the link is at the bottom of every eBay page) and click

Giving eBay all the right information
If you have a troubled item and need to launch a report, follow these steps:
 1. Read all the information on the Security and Resolution Center page 
before filing a new complaint.
 2. Click Report a Problem.
 
 You arrive at that handy form shown in Figure 3-5.
 3. Select the item that relate to your situation, and then click Report 
Problem.
 4. If eBay presents you with a page full of links to teach you about their 
policies and some possible solutions to your issue, review them. Then 
scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the Start Here link.
 5. You see a list of most requested FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), 
but look at the tabs at the top and click Send Us an Email.
 6. On the resulting page, use the drop-down menu to select your issue 
topic; then give a thorough description of what transpired. Sign the 
bottom of the form with your e-mail address and user ID, and type the 
item number (or numbers) if they’re part of a related problem. Click 
Continue.
 
 Figure 3-6 shows you the form for one type of transgression. Be sure to 
review what you’ve written to confirm that your report is accurate.

eBay Is Watching Over You
 
If you file a report, make your message clear and concise by including every-
thing that happened, but don’t editorialize. (Calling someone a “lowdown 
mud-sucking cretin” doesn’t provide any useful info to anyone who can help 
you and doesn’t reflect well on you, either.) Keep your comments business-
like — just the facts, ma’am. Be sure that the subject line of your report pre-
cisely names the violation and that you include all pertinent documentation.
Here’s a checklist of backup documentation you may need for your Trust 
and Safety report:
 ✦ A copy of the facts you recorded on your report: And remember to 
stick to only the facts as you know them.
 ✦ E-mail correspondence: Attach any pertinent e-mails with complete 
headers. (Headers are all the information found at the top of an e-mail 
message.) Trust and Safety uses the headers to verify how the e-mail 
was sent and to follow the trail back to the author.
 ✦ Receipts and cancelled checks: These help verify that a transaction 
took place, and when.
 
If the clock is running out on your case (for example, you suspect bidding 
offenses in a current auction), I suggest that you avail yourself of the Live 
Help link, which appears on the eBay home page. After eBay receives your 
report, you usually get an automatic response that your e-mail was received. 
Several days may go crawling by before eBay investigates your allegations. 
(They must look at a lot of transactions.)
eBay’s response may vary
If your complaint doesn’t warrant an investigation by the folks at Trust and 
Safety, they pass it along to someone from the overworked customer-support 
staff, who then contacts you. (Don’t bawl out the person if the attention you 
get is tardy.)
 
Depending on the outcome of the probe, eBay may contact you with the 
results. If your problem becomes a legal matter, eBay may not let you know 
what’s going on. The only indication you may get that some action was taken 
is that the eBay member you reported is suspended, or turns out to be 
NARU (Not A Registered User).
 
Unfortunately, NARU members can show up again on the eBay site. 
Typically, nefarious sorts such as these just use a different name. In fact, this 
practice is common, so beware! If you suspect that someone who broke the 
rules once is back under another user ID, alert Trust and Safety. If you’re a 
seller, you can refuse to accept bids from that person. If the person persists, 
alert customer support by e-mail.

56
eBay Is Watching Over You
 
Make sure that you don’t violate any eBay rules by sharing any member’s 
contact information as you share your story in a chat room. In addition, 
make sure that you don’t threaten or libel (that is, say untrue things or 
spread rumors about) the person in your posting.
Speeding up a response (or not)
As eBay has grown, so has the number of complaints about slow response 
from customer support. I don’t doubt that eBay staffers are doing their best. 
Although slow response can get frustrating, avoid the temptation to initiate a 
reporting blitzkrieg by sending reports over and over until eBay can’t ignore 
you. This practice is inconsiderate at best and risky at worst, and it just 
slows down the process for everyone — and won’t endear the e-mail bom-
bardier to the folks who could help.
If you’re desperate for help and can’t find a Live Help link, you can post a 
message with your problem in one of the eBay chat rooms. eBay members 
participating in chat rooms often share the names of helpful staffers. Often 
you can find some eBay members who faced the same problem (sometimes 
with the same member) and can offer advice — or at the very least, com-
passion and a virtual ear. (Jump to Chapter 8 for more info on discussion 
boards and chat rooms.)
 
If you’re a PowerSeller, you can always contact PowerSeller support with 
your immediate problem. You can get to PowerSeller support by going to the 
site map and clicking the PowerSeller link in the middle of the page. You can 
also go directly to
pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/welcome.html
Don’t get caught in a trading violation
Playing by eBay’s rules keeps you off the Trust and Safety radar screen. If 
you start violating eBay policies, the company’s going to keep a close eye 
on you. Depending on the infraction, eBay may be all over you like jelly on 
peanut butter. Or you may safely lurk in the fringes until your feedback 
rating is lower than the temperature in Nome in November.
Here’s the docket of eBay no-no’s that can get members flogged and keel-
hauled — or at least suspended:
 ✦ Feedback rating of –4.3
 ✦ Three instances of deadbeat bidding
 ✦ Repeated warning for the same infraction
 ✦ Feedback extortion
 ✦ Bid shielding

 ✦ Unwelcome bidding after a warning from the seller
 ✦ Shill bidding
 ✦ Auction interception
 ✦ Fee avoidance
 ✦ Fraudulent selling
 ✦ Identity misrepresentation
 ✦ Bidding when younger than age 18
 ✦ Hacking
 ✦ Physical threats
 
If you get a suspension but think you’re innocent, respond directly to the 
person who suspended you to plead your case. Reversals do occur. But don’t 
broadcast your suspicions on chat boards. If you’re wrong, you may regret 
it. Even if you’re right, it’s oh-so-gauche.
 
Be careful about accusing members of cheating. Unless you’re involved in a 
transaction, you don’t know all the facts. Perry Mason moments are great on 
television, but they’re fictional for a reason. In real life, drawing yourself into 
a possible confrontation is senseless. Start the complaint process, keep it 
businesslike, and let eBay’s staff figure out what’s going on.

Chapter 4: Understanding 
eBay Sales
In This Chapter

✓ Bidding on an auction
✓ Buying something right now
✓ Visiting eBay’s specialty sites
S
ometimes, when you know exactly what you want to buy, you find not 
one but many auctions and fixed-price listings with that same item for 
sale. In this situation, knowing the different eBay sales formats is important. 
In this chapter, I go over the various types of sales and show you the ways 
to use each type to your advantage.
Checking Out the Listing Page
All item pages on eBay — whether auctions, fixed-price items, or Buy It 
Now items — look about the same. Figure 4-1 shows a conventional auction-
item page. If you were viewing this auction page on the screen, you could 
scroll down and see a complete description of the item, along with shipping 
information.
eBay auction listings have some subtle differences. (With a venue as big as 
eBay, you gotta have some flexibility.) Some auctions feature a picture at 
the top of the page and some don’t, depending on how the seller sets up his 
or her sale page. You may also see the words Financing Available (more on 
that later). Some auctions also have preset item specifics that appear above 
the description written by the seller. If you’re looking at an item in a fixed-
price sale, you’ll see the words Buy It Now, as shown in Figure 4-2.

Here’s a list of stuff you see as you scroll down a typical auction-item page:
 ✦ Item category: Located just above the item title and number bar, you 
can click the category listing and do some comparison shopping. (Book 
II, Chapter 1 offers some more searching strategies.)
 ✦ Item title and number: The title and number identify the item. Keep 
track of this info for inquiries later. Some sellers (refer to Figure 4-2) also 
use a subtitle to pass on more information about their items.

Chapter 4

eBay Sales
61
Checking Out the Listing Page
 
 If you’re interested in a particular type of item, take note of the key-
words used in the title (you’re likely to see them again in future titles). 
Doing so helps you narrow down your searches.
 ✦ Watch this item: Click this link, and the item is magically added to the 
Watching area of your My eBay All Buying page so you can keep an eye 
on the progress of the auction — without actually bidding. If you haven’t 
signed in, you have to type your user ID and password before you can 
save the auction to your My eBay page.
 ✦ Starting bid or Current bid: This is the dollar amount that the bidding 
has reached. The amount changes throughout the auction as people place 
bids. If no bids have been placed on the item, it will read Starting bid.
 
 
 Sometimes, next to the current dollar amount, you see Reserve not met or 
Reserve met. This means the seller has set a reserve price for the item — a 
secret price that must be reached before the seller will sell the item. Most 
auctions do not have reserve prices.
 ✦ End Time: Although the clock never stops ticking on eBay, you must 
continue to refresh your browser to see the time remaining on the 
official clock. When the item gets down to the last hour of the auction, 
you’ll see the time expressed in minutes and seconds. You’ll also see the 
date and time that the listing will close.
 
 
 Timing is the key in an eBay bidding strategy (covered in Chapter 6), so 
don’t forget that eBay uses Pacific Standard Time (PST) or Pacific 
Daylight Time (PDT) as the standard, depending on the season.
 ✦ Shipping costs: If the seller is willing to ship the item anywhere in the 
country for a flat rate, you’ll see that here. This area may also link to 
eBay’s shipping calculator if the seller customizes the shipping expense 
according to weight and distance.
 ✦ Ships to: If the seller ships to only the United States, it will state so here. 
If the seller ships to any other countries, this is where they will be listed.
 ✦ Item location: This field tells you at the very least the country where the 
seller is located. You may also see more specific info, such as the seller’s 
city and geographic area. (What you see depends on how detailed the 
seller chooses to be.) The item location is handy if you’d like to go pick 
up the item — but e-mail the seller first to see whether he or she would be 
willing to meet you at (say) a local Starbucks to complete the transaction.
 ✦ History: This field tells you how many bids have been placed. The start-
ing bid is listed in light gray next to the number of bids. When the listing 
is live, you can click the number of bids to find out who is bidding and 
when bids were placed. (In some circumstances, only the seller and 
buyer can access this data.)
 
 You can click the number of bids to see how the bidding action is going, 
but you won’t be able to see the high bidder’s proxy bid (more about 
proxy bids later in this chapter).

62
Checking Out the Listing Page
 ✦ High bidder: This field shows you the user ID and feedback rating of the 
current high bidder. It could be you if you’ve placed a bid!
 
 
 When you’re bidding, eBay can hide your bidder ID by using anonymous 
names under certain circumstances. Your actual user ID is shown to the 
seller of this item only. Bidders are assigned anonymous names, such as 
a***k. Anonymous names are used for auctions that exceed a certain 
bidding level.
 
 
 Sometimes an item has no bids because everyone is waiting until the 
last minute. Then you see a flurry of activity as bidders try to outbid 
each other (called sniping, which Chapter 6 explains). It’s all part of the 
fun of eBay.
 ✦ Buy It Now price: If you want an item immediately and the price listed in 
this area is okay with you, click Buy It Now. You will be taken to a page 
where you can complete your purchase. Buy It Now is an option and 
does not appear in all listings.
 ✦ Quantity: This field appears only when multiple items are available. 
If you see a number other than 1 in this field and the item is open to 
bid, you’re looking at a multiple-item auction (Dutch auction), which I 
describe later in this chapter. If it’s a multiple-item, fixed-price sale, you 
have no opportunity to bid — you use Buy It Now to purchase whatever 
quantity of the item you want. You’ll be prompted for a quantity when 
you buy.
 ✦ Meet the Seller: This area, on the right side of the page, gives you infor-
mation about the seller. Know thy seller ranks right after caveat emptor 
as a phrase that pays at eBay. As I tell you nearly a million times in this 
book, read the feedback rating! (Okay, maybe not a million — it would 
drive the editors bonkers.) Like any community, eBay has its share of 
good folks and bad folks. Your best defense is to read the seller’s feed-
back. You’ll see several things in the Meet the Seller box (as shown in 
Figure 4-3):
 
Figure 4-3:

on the seller 
here.
 
 
• Seller icons: Various icons that show the status of the seller. A 
varied color star reflects the feedback level of the seller. If the seller 
is a PowerSeller, you see the PowerSeller icon. To see if the seller 
has an About Me page, click on their feedback number and look for a 
blue-and-red me icon.

• Feedback score: This number is also to the right of the seller’s name 
in parentheses. Click the number next to the seller’s ID to view his or 
her eBay ID card and entire feedback history. Read, read, and reread 
all the feedback to make sure you feel comfortable doing business 
with this person.
 
• Positive feedback percentage: The eBay computers calculate this 
figure. It’s derived from all the positive and negative feedback that a 
user receives.
 
• Member since: You can find the date the seller joined eBay and the 
country in which he or she registered by clicking the Read Feedback 
Profile link.
 
• Read Feedback Profile: This link does the same thing as clicking the 
feedback score.
 
• Ask Seller a Question: Clicking this link hooks you up with eBay’s 
e-mail system so you can ask the seller a question regarding the item. 
If the seller uses Skype (eBay’s voice-over-Internet phone service), 
you may be able to click a nearby icon and chat live or call the seller 
with an immediate question.
 
• View seller’s other items: This link takes you to a page that lists all 
the seller’s current auctions and fixed-price sales. If the seller has an 
eBay store, a link to it appears here as well. I give you a step-by-step 
guide on how these links work later in this chapter.
 ✦ Description bar: In this section, you find the item description on the 
Description tab. It will state “revised” if the seller has made any revi-
sions to the description during the run of the listing. There may also be 
a colorful header with links to the seller’s eBay store. Also, if the seller 
is bonded through BuySAFE, that info will appear in the item description 
area. Read all this information carefully before bidding.
 
 By clicking the Shipping and Payments tab, you’ll find some other 
important data on the typical listing page, as shown in Figures 4-4 and 4-5.

• Whether the seller is charging flat shipping or is offering more than 
one shipping option through a shipping calculator.
 
• Who pays (usually the buyer).
 
• Whether insurance is offered.
 
• Which states have to pay sales tax (if any) and the sales tax rate.
 
• Whether the seller is willing to ship to your area. (Sometimes sellers 
won’t ship internationally, and they’ll let you know here.)
 
 Be sure to also check the item description for other shipping information 
and terms.

 ✦ Item-related links: From here you can e-mail the item to tip off a friend 
on a good find, get some advice from an antiques or collecting expert, 
or run the auction by someone who’s been around the eBay block a 
few times and ask for strategy advice. You also have a link to a printer-
friendly version of the page and an additional link you can use to ask the 
seller a question.
 
Be sure to use the Watch This Item feature when shopping around. 
Organization is the name of the game on eBay, especially if you plan to bid 
on multiple auctions while you’re running auctions of your own. I figure 
you’re in the bidding game to win, so start keeping track of items now.
Bidding on Auctions
To give you a sense of the auction process, here’s a real-world example 
of my addictions put to the eBay test. I searched and found an item that I 
wanted, a “New York Pizza.” After reading the seller’s feedback (and skip-
ping lunch), I wanted the item even more! None of this seller’s previous 
buyers were unhappy with the product. As a matter of fact, no one seems 
able to say enough about the quality of their food. Yum! (If I buy the pizza for 
research for this book, it makes my pizza a tax write-off, no?)

Book I
Chapter 4
Understanding 
eBay Sales
65
Bidding on Auctions
The pizza’s starting bid is $9.95, and the auction ends in over four days. So I 
need to observe several things about the auction. How many more are up for 
sale? A simple search shows that only one is up for auction. What did they 
sell for in the past? I run a completed auctions search, and see that they’ve 
sold for up to $20. (Shipping is free — this is as good as Domino’s!)
You have to make some decisions. I have observed that these pizza auc-
tions have an active bidding pattern, so at this early stage I bid the minimum 
amount just to get the item to show up as one of the items in the All Buying 
area of the My eBay page.
 
Bidding can be like games of poker. If you want to win a one-of-a-kind item, 
don’t show your hand to other bidders. Simply mark the auction to watch. 
However, this strategy isn’t necessary for an item that will be sure to be 
listed again, like the New York Pizza.
When it comes to auctions, the highest bid wins. Remember this, please. 
People are constantly boo-hooing because they’ve been outbid at the last 
minute (or sniped, as I explain in Chapter 6). You can’t be outbid if you’re 
the high bidder!
Automatic bidding
Bidding on eBay goes up by prescribed increments. But what if you’re not 
able to sit in on an auction 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, upping your bid 
every time someone bids against you? (You mean you have a life?)
You do receive e-mail messages from eBay to let you know that you’ve been 
outbid, but eBay’s computers are often busy doing other things and you 
might not get the notice in time to place a new competitive bid.
If you’re interested in an item but you don’t have the time to follow it closely 
from the beginning of the auction to its conclusion, you can place a proxy 
bid using eBay’s automatic bidding system to place your bid for the highest 
amount you’re willing to pay for an item — without spending your valuable 
time constantly following the auction.
 
Instead of waiting it out with eBay’s automatic proxy bidding, you can also 
go to the seller’s eBay store to see whether a duplicate item is for sale at a 
fixed price. Or, if the seller has set a Buy It Now price and (again) you’re too 
impatient to wait until the end of the auction to win, click Buy It Now and go 
from there.

66
Bidding on Auctions
Placing a proxy bid
Before you place your proxy bid, you should give serious thought to how 
much you want to pay for the item. When you place an automatic bid (a proxy 
bid) on eBay, eBay’s bidding engine places only enough of your bid to outbid 
the previous bidder. If there are no previous bidders and the seller has not 
entered a reserve price, your bid appears as the minimum auction bid until 
someone bids against you. Your bid increases incrementally in response to 
other bids against yours. Table 4-1 lists eBay’s bidding increments.
Table 4-1 
eBay’s Bidding Increments

Next Bid Increased By ($)

No one will know how much your proxy bid is — unless someone outbids 
you and becomes the high bidder.
To place a proxy bid in an auction, follow these steps:
 1. Type your maximum bid in the appropriate box, or click the Place Bid 
button, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 
 A confirmation page appears, and you have one last chance to back out.
 2. If everything is in order, click Confirm Bid. Or, if you get cold feet, 
click Back to Item.
 
 After you’ve placed your bid, the next page lets you know whether 
you’re the high bidder.
 3. If you’re not the high bidder in an auction, just scroll down the 
acknowledgment page to the rebidding area and place another bid.

Understanding reserve prices
You’ll often come across auctions that have the words Reserve not met next 
to the bid amount. By placing a reserve on the auction, the seller ensures 
that the item will not sell until the bidding reaches the mysterious reserve 
figure.
 
If you’re really interested in an item with a reserve price, e-mail the seller 
and politely ask how much the reserve is. Some sellers guard the reserve 
amount like the crown jewels; others graciously reveal the figure. The point 
of the reserve is to protect their investment and get qualified bidders, not 
waste your time.
Private auctions
Private auctions are handled the same way as plain-vanilla auctions, except 
no one but the buyer and seller knows who the winner is. As a matter of fact, 
all bidders’ names are hidden from investigation from anyone other than the 
seller.
After you’ve been on eBay a while, you might see the same group of names 
bidding on the same auctions as you. I like bidding in private auctions 
because they’re handy for snaring items secretly, without my regular com-
petitors knowing that I’m bidding on the item. (See Chapter 6 for bidding 
strategies.)

68
Buying an Item Outright
Multiple-item auctions
A multiple-item, or Dutch, auction allows a seller to auction multiple identical 
items. You can bid on one or as many of the item as you want. When the 
total number of items has been bid upon at the opening price, the next bids 
have to beat the previous bids by one bidding increment.
When the auction is over, all winning bidders (those with the highest bids) 
win their items at the lowest bid price. I know that sounds ridiculous, but 
that’s the way it works. I’m only reporting this — it must have taken a 
creative mind to come up with this theory of auctions. If you want a more 
in-depth description of the Dutch process, go to eBay and read their 
description:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/buyer-multiple.html
To place a bid in a Dutch auction, you must input the amount of items you 
want to bid on and the amount you want to bid per item.
Buying an Item Outright
Although eBay’s success was built on auctions, eBay also allows sellers to 
handle outright sales. You can make a direct purchase
 ✦ By using the Buy It Now feature in an eBay auction
 ✦ In a fixed-price sale 
 ✦ In one of eBay’s stores
Buy It Now
You may have already looked at auctions and seen a Buy It Now price 
located below the minimum or starting bid amount. That little indicator 
means that if you want the item badly enough, and the Buy It Now price is 
within your budget, you can end the auction right then and there by buying 
the item for the stated amount.
 
Before using the Buy It Now option (because you think you’ve hit upon a bar-
gain), be sure to check the seller’s shipping charges. Many sellers set a low 
Buy It Now price but place a high shipping amount on the item to make up 
their missing profits. If the shipping amount isn’t listed, be sure to e-mail the 
seller and ask for the shipping amount. A Buy It Now transaction is final; you 
can’t withdraw your commitment to buy. It’s best to know what you’re get-
ting into beforehand.

Book I
Chapter 4
Understanding 
eBay Sales
69
Buying an Item Outright
If you decide that you want to buy, scroll down to the bottom of the page 
and click the Buy It Now button. An eBay confirmation page appears. If 
you still want to make the purchase, you can click Confirm to tell eBay 
that you’re willing to pay the purchase price. Then all you have to do is go 
through the checkout process and pay the seller.
 
You can still place a bid on an auction that has a Buy It Now option. When 
you do, the option to immediately buy disappears and the item goes into 
auction mode. If the item has a reserve, the Buy It Now option doesn’t 
disappear until the bidding surpasses the reserve amount.
Fixed-price sales
eBay also offers items for sale without the option to bid. These fixed-price 
listings may be for a single item or for multiple items. When multiple items 
are offered (see Figure 4-7), you can buy as many as you like.
 
Figure 4-7:

or up to 
three of this 
item in one 
transaction.
 
Shopping eBay stores
eBay stores are the secret weapon for knowledgeable eBay shoppers. First, 
of course, you can consistently find great deals. But you can also help small 
businesses make it against the behemoths. Sellers open eBay stores to 
make searching merchandise easier for buyers; stores also help save sellers 
money because sellers don’t need to set up private e-commerce Web sites. 
Translation? Sellers can list items in their eBay stores for even lower fees, 
passing their savings on to you, the savvy bargain hunter.

70
Buying an Item Outright
 
Before you buy any item from a listing on eBay, check to see whether the 
seller has the small, red stores icon next to his or her user ID. If so, be sure to 
click the icon before you bid on the item. Most sellers run auctions for items 
to draw people into their eBay stores, where you may be able to find more 
interesting merchandise you can buy, have the seller put it in the same crate 
along with your auction item, and save on shipping.
You can get to the eBay Stores hub from the eBay home page by clicking the 
eBay Stores link under the search in the top bar or by typing the following 
Web address:
www.ebaystores.com
At the center of the eBay Stores hub page, as shown in Figure 4-8, you see a 
small group of store logos. These logos change every few minutes as eBay 
rotates its anchor stores through the area. Store owners pay a considerable 
amount to have their stores listed as anchor stores.

Next to the store logos is a list of clickable links to stores. These are Popular

cottage-industry sellers — by browsing through the categories on the left 
side of the page.

Strolling through an eBay store
When you finally arrive at the eBay store of your choice, you see a page that 
looks similar to the one in Figure 4-9. An eBay store displays not only the

Most eBay stores have a column on the left side of the home page that dis-
plays the following:
 ✦ Store search: Below the store name banner is a column topped by a 
search box that allows you to search all the items this seller has for sale.
 ✦ Store Categories: eBay store owners may assign their own custom cat-
egories to the items they sell to better organize things within the store. 
You may click individual categories to see items in that classification 
from that seller.
 ✦ Display: You can decide how you’d like to view the items in the seller’s 
store. Figure 4-10 shows you the store in gallery view and the remaining

 ✦ Store policies: This area shows the terms and conditions of the seller’s 
auctions.
 ✦ About the seller: The last entry in this section is the seller’s About Me

At the top and bottom of the store home page, you’ll see a variety of things:
 ✦ The store name: This is the name the store owner has chosen for the 
store. Each eBay store has its own address that ends in the eBay store’s 
name, like this: www.stores.ebay.com/insertstorename. For 
example, my store’s URL is 
www.stores.ebay.com/marshacolliersfabulousfinds.com
 
 Because www.ebaystores.com also gets you to the eBay Stores hub, 
an alternative URL for my store also works:
www.ebaystores.com/marshacolliersfabulousfinds
 ✦ Seller’s user ID and feedback rating: Some stores choose to put this on 
the home page; others replace it with graphics. Next to Maintained by 
are the seller’s user ID and the ubiquitous feedback rating.
 ✦ Add to My Favorite Stores: If you click this link, the store is added to 
the favorites page in your My eBay area.
 ✦ Sign up for Store newsletter. If you’d like to receive promotional e-mail 
from your favorite stores, click here and e-mails can be sent to you from 
the seller through eBay’s e-mail system. Your e-mail address will not be 
given to the seller, and you can discontinue the e-mails at any time.
 ✦ Store logo and description: In the middle of the page is the store’s 
graphic logo, and to the right of that is the seller’s description of the 
store. (This is the area that is searched when you search Stores by store 
name and description.)

Aside from owning PayPal (the world’s largest online payment service), eBay 
runs some special categories that make up a good deal of the business on eBay.
Real estate
Since the founding of our country, land has been valued as a great commodity; 
passed from generation to generation. As Gerald O’Hara so eloquently put it, 
“it’s the only thing that lasts.” (Remember that scene from Gone with the Wind?) 
People buy land for investment, vacations, or retirement. It’s no longer common 
for a family to spend their entire life in one home. Real estate, although a major 
purchase, is becoming more and more an everyday transaction.
The smart people at eBay are sly trend-spotters, so they opened an official 
category for real estate transactions in the fall of 2000. You can access 
eBay’s Real Estate category through the category link on the left side of the 
home page or by going directly to

Because substantial legal restrictions are involved in real estate transactions, 
sellers can choose to list their properties either as auctions or in the form of 
advertisements, depending on the laws in their areas.
 
When you participate in a listing that is in an ad format, you do not place 
bids. At the bottom of the item’s description page is a form for you to fill out 
that’s sent to the seller. After the seller receives this information, he or she 
can contact you, and the two of you may negotiate privately. When you 
browse the Residential Homes category, a small ad icon in the Bids column 
indicates items listed as advertisements. Most residential home sales are 
handled in this manner. Land and timeshares are typically sold in the 
auction format.
 
Because of a wide variety of laws governing the intricacies and legalities in 
real estate transactions, the auction format may be nonbinding. Before get-
ting involved in any real estate transactions on eBay, I suggest you read the 
official rules, which you can find on the following page:

Cruising eBay Motors
Buying a car — that’s one purchase I don’t enjoy making. Please don’t 
misunderstand. I love cars and have a personal attachment to every car 
I’ve owned. It’s just that each time I’m approached by a car salesperson, 
I get intimidated. The minute the salesperson says “I’ve got to check with 
my sales manager to see if I can do that,” I know I’m a goner. And when I’ve 
finally decided on the car model I want, I still have to face the deal, when the 
finance manager tries to sell me warranties, alarms, and extras that I never 
wanted or needed. I feel the need to run out of the dealership — and I 
usually do.
If this feeling is familiar to you, I would like to introduce you to the sweetest 
deal of the 21st century, eBay Motors (see Figure 4-10). eBay Motors is 
the largest auto mall in the universe and is consistently ranked the No. 1 
automotive site on the Web by Nielsen//NetRatings.
For some of us, eBay Motors is a magnificent fantasy site. I have a friend 
who browses the Volkswagen bus category; his eyes glaze over with hope 
and awe as he reads each listing. I’m sure he’s reliving his hippie days of the 
late ‘60s. Another friend reads the Ferrari and Lamborghini listings; he pooh-
poohs all the aftermarket changes to the classics. My best friend checks out 
the vintage Thunderbirds and pictures herself as Suzanne Somers flirting 
with the guys in American Graffiti. Then of course there’s my fantasy car; 
the buttercup yellow Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible driven by Teensy in 
Ya-Ya Sisterhood. (I’ve yet to find one on eBay in that color — but then again, 
I couldn’t afford one if I did find it!)

Motors 
home page.
 
Many of the cars on eBay Motors are private-party sales, bank cars (repos-
sessions), and cars that have been cherry-picked by wholesalers and dealer 
overstocks. In addition, professional car dealers sell rare, hard-to-find cars 
to a marketplace that draws between 4 and 5 million visitors per month. You 
can’t get that many people through the door at a local dealership! Dealers 
put up the rare colors and limited-edition vehicles because this is an auction 
site — the rarer an item, the more likely bidders are to get excited. The more 
excited bidders are, the more they lose their heads — and the higher the 
price goes.
With an average of seven to eight bids per sale, eBay Motors is a competitive 
environment for the most desirable cars. Dealers can sell cars for less on 
eBay because it costs them less to sell. (They don’t have to pay the finance 
manager to twist your arm to buy the extras.)
You can enter the eBay Motors site in two ways. Click the eBay Motors link

The truly amazing part about eBay Motors is 
that it has more than just the usual cars and 
vans. In fact, the rule seems to be that if it has an 
engine, you’ll find it here. Here’s a description
of the Other Vehicles categories:
 ✓ ATVs: Within the ATV subcategory of 
Powersports, you’ll find a wide selection of 
new and used 4x4s and 2x4s, three-wheelers
and four-wheelers. I even found a few 
six-wheel amphibious vehicles! Bidding in 
this category is active and the items move 
quickly.
 ✓ Aircraft: Anything that flies can be found 
here, from hot-air balloons to military 
trainer jets. Browsing this category is 
amazing. Who could imagine that with a 
click of your mouse (and enough money) 
you could own your own Bell helicopter 
or Gulfstream jet? If you’ve ever dreamt of 
taking up flying, this might be the category 
to get your hobby started!
 ✓ Boats: This category was so full that I 
got seasick just browsing! It has its own 
subcategories of Fishing Boats, Personal 
Watercraft (Sea-Doo, Yamaha, Kawasaki, 
and so on), Powerboats, Sailboats, and 
Other (kayaks, canoes, pontoons, tenders,
and dinghies). I know boats, and I saw 
some great deals in this category. There 
were some beautiful Bass boats and 
Boston Whalers at incredible prices. A 
dozen or so Bayliners caught my eye, 
especially the 47-foot Pilot House 
Motoryacht with a starting bid of 
$290,000.00 (sigh). It was also nice to see a 
wide selection of prices for sailboats. With 
some time spent shopping in this category, 
you can find just about anything you want 
within your price range.
 ✓ Buses: No kidding. You want to start your 
own bus line? Here’s the place to find the 
buses — and it seems that plenty of people 
are interested in them! There’s active bidding
on old school buses in this category (and 
I thought the American family was getting 
smaller!).
 ✓ Commercial trucks: Since commercial 
trucks are something I know jack about, 
I went to some experts who browsed the 
site and examined the deals. Here’s their 
review for those in the know. The items are 
good quality and of the type they’d like to 
find at commercial truck auctions. They tell 
me the prices are bargains and that they’ll 
be visiting the site regularly from now on —
sounds like a good recommendation to me!
 ✓ Scooters and minibikes: Aside from what 
you’d expect to find here, this is the home 
for beautiful vintage and new Vespa motor 
scooters.
 ✓ Snowmobiles: I’ve never lived in a snowy 
part of the country, so I can only imagine 
how much fun these bad boys are. You’ll 
see everything from top-of-the-line new 
ones to gently used private sales.
 ✓ Other: How about a 1947 Coca-Cola vending
truck — complete with fountain, cotton-
candy machine, and propane-powered 
hot-dog cooker! Sounds like a carnival 
on wheels! Well, okay, it doesn’t run, but 
hey — it’s only $3000! There’s also a Shelby 
Cobra kit, with no motor or tranny, but you 
need a hobby, don’t you? I also found a Think 
Neighbor electric vehicle; a sandrail dune 
buggy four-seater; go-karts, and car haul-
ers. There’s nothing you can’t find on eBay!

On the eBay home page, take a look at the long list of links on the left. Below 
the major category-listing links are a few links to even more eBay special 
areas.
These specialized categories have been put together by the eBay gurus to 
encompass areas of interest that cover more than one category. On the eBay 
home page, you’ll currently find the following big three (eBay will no doubt 
add more in the future):
 ✦ Business & Industrial
 ✦ Collectibles
 ✦ Giving Works (Charity)
These supercategories come in handy when you’re looking for cross-
category merchandise.
Business & Industrial
If you’re looking for anything to outfit a business, Business & Industrial 
category is the place to go. Shown in Figure 4-11, it covers everything from 
tractor parts to welding equipment to computers. You can browse the sub-
category of your choice and see what’s available.

Giving Works: Giving back to nonprofits
Many charitable organizations are selling their wares on eBay to raise 
money for their fine work (see Figure 4-12). You can get some rare and 
unusual items here, such as the annual NBC Today Show Green Room 
autograph book. This one-of-a-kind book has signatures and notes from the 
famous guests of the Today Show. One of these Green Room books sold for 
$87,500! The superhot auction was for lunch with Warren Buffet (the CEO of 
Berkshire Hathaway); it raised $250,000.
eBay has partnered with the leader in online charitable auctions, 
MissionFish, which has been helping organizations turn donations into cash 
through online auctions since 2000. MissionFish works with regular eBay 
sellers to raise money for nonprofit organizations.

When you list an item on eBay, you can choose a nonprofit from a certified 
list and designate a percentage of the proceeds (from 20 to 100%) to donate. 
The item appears in the search results with a Charity Auction icon. When 
you go to the item page, you’ll see the name of the nonprofit, some informa-
tion about it, and the percentage of the final bid that the seller is donating. 
You can search eBay for your favorite nonprofits by name.

W
hen you’re shopping on eBay, you’re faced with hundreds of items, 
perhaps even hundreds of listings for the same item. How do you 
decide where to place your order or your bid? In this chapter, I show you 
the tools on eBay that guide you to a safe and positive transaction.
Understanding and Giving Feedback
One of eBay’s strong suits has been the formation of a sense of community 
through its use of message boards, chats, and feedback. Many experts say 
the reason eBay has succeeded where dozens of other dot-com auction 
sites have failed is that eBay has always paid close attention to the needs 
of its users.
Even in the early days, the concept was clear. Pierre and his employees 
figured that if users complained openly (for all other members to see), feed-
back would be more genuine — not so much flaming as constructive. “Do 
unto others as you’d have them do” prevailed as a philosophy; above all 
else, Pierre encouraged buyers and sellers to give each other the benefit of 
the doubt and to conduct themselves professionally.
It soon became clear to eBay’s three employees that they did not have time 
to adjudicate member disputes. Thus the feedback system was born. But 
the pièce de résistance of feedback policy, the part that makes eBay work, is 
the fact that Pierre and his staff encouraged users to give positive feedback 
as often as they give negative or neutral feedback.

80
Understanding and Giving Feedback
The benefits of the feedback policy are immediately clear. Before even plac-
ing a bid with a seller, a buyer (you) can check the experience other eBay 
buyers have had doing business with this seller. You can see whether items 
in a seller’s previous auctions shipped quickly, whether items were packed 
carefully, whether communication was clear and frequent, and so on. You 
now have more information about an eBay seller then you have when you 
walk into a new store in your neighborhood!
The types of feedback
 
Every eBay member has a feedback rating. Buyers rate sellers (more on that 
below), and sellers rate buyers — no one is immune. Although sellers can no 
longer leave negative or neutral feedback for a buyer, a seller still might 
comment on how quickly you paid for an item, how well you communicated, 
or how you reacted to a problem.
Leaving feedback for the seller comes in three exciting flavors:
 ✦ Positive feedback: Someone once said, “All you have is your reputa-
tion.” Reputation is what makes eBay function. If the transaction works 
well, you get positive feedback — and whenever it’s warranted, you 
should give it right back.
 ✦ Negative feedback: If there’s a glitch (for instance, it takes six months to get 
your Charlie’s Angels lunchbox, or the seller substitutes a rusty Thermos for 
the one you bid on, or you never get the item), you have the right — some 
would say obligation — to leave the seller negative feedback.
 ✦ Neutral feedback: You can leave neutral feedback if you feel so-so about 
a specific transaction. It’s the middle-of-the-road comment that’s useful 
when, for example, you bought an item that has a little more wear and 
tear on it than the seller indicated, but you still like it and want to keep it.
 
Keep in mind that a Neutral feedback will affect the seller’s feedback per-
centage (and reputation). The feedback percentage (next to the feedback 
number) is calculated based on the total number of feedback ratings 
received in the last 12 months. This does not include repeat feedback from 
the same buyer in the same week.
Leaving feedback for a buyer isn’t quite as colorful. A seller can leave only 
Positive feedback for a transaction — or none at all. If I’ve dealt with a particu-
larly difficult buyer, there is a good chance that I won’t leave any feedback at all.
 
You’re not required to leave feedback, but because it’s the benchmark by 
which all eBay users are judged, you should always leave feedback 
comments whether you’re buying or selling. Every time you complete a 
transaction — the minute the package arrives safely and you’ve checked the 
contents, whether you’re a seller or a buyer — you should go to eBay and 
post your feedback.

Understanding and Giving Feedback
The magic feedback number
You know how they say you are what you eat? At eBay, you are only as good as 
your feedback says you are. Your feedback is made up of comments — good, 
bad, or neutral — that people leave about you (and you leave about others). In 
effect, people are commenting on your overall professionalism. (Even if you’re 
an eBay hobbyist with no thought of using eBay professionally, a little business-
like courtesy can ease your transactions with everyone.) These comments are 
the basis for your eBay reputation. You wouldn’t be caught dead in a store that 
has a lousy reputation, so why on Earth would you want to do business on the 
Internet with someone who has a lousy reputation?
When you get your first feedback, the number that appears next to your user 
ID is your feedback rating, which follows you everywhere you go on eBay, 
even if you change your user ID or e-mail address. It sticks to you like glue.
Click the number next to any user ID and get a complete look at the user’s 
feedback profile. When you do, here are some points to recognize about the 
user’s magic feedback number:
 ✦ This number is a net figure of the positive and negative comments that 
were left for that eBay user. For example, if you get 50 positive com-
ments and 49 negative comments, your feedback rating is 1.
 
 For every positive comment you receive, you get a plus 1. For every 
negative comment, you get a minus 1. Negative comments deduct from 
your total of positive comments, thereby lowering the number beside 
your user ID. Theoretically, if you play nice, your feedback rating grows 
as you spend more time using eBay.
 
 
 Anyone with a –4 rating has his or her eBay membership terminated. 
And don’t make automatic assumptions just because someone has a 
high feedback rating. You should always click the number after the name 
to double-check the person’s eBay ID card. Even if someone has a total 
of 1000 feedback messages, 250 of them could be negative.
 ✦ This number shows more than how good a customer or seller you are. 
As it grows, the feedback number also tells how experienced you are at 
doing business on the site. 
 ✦ This number ignores neutral comments. A neutral comment is neither 
negative nor positive; it doesn’t change the number that appears after 
your user ID. Neutral comments are used most often when someone is 
not completely happy with a transaction, but not so unhappy that they 
choose to destroy someone else’s reputation over the situation.
 
eBay riddle: When is more than 1 still 1? Gotcha, huh? The answer is, when 
you get more than one feedback message from the same person in the same 
week. Confused? This example should help: You can sell one person 100 
different items, but even if the buyer gives you a glowing review 100 times, 

82
Giving Detailed Star Ratings Properly
your feedback rating doesn’t increase by 100. In this case, the other 99 feed-
back comments appear in your feedback profile, but your rating increases 
by only 1. There’s something else: Say you sell to the same eBay user twice. 
The user can give you positive feedback in one case and negative feedback 
in another case — neutralizing your feedback by netting you a 0 feedback 
rating from that person. eBay set up the system this way to keep things 
honest.
 
Members may affect your score by one point per week. If they leave you 
great feedback for multiple transactions spread from one week to another — 
you will get credit (hopefully) for two positives. To get credit for selling mul-
tiple items to one bidder, the bidder must leave feedback. For feedback 
purposes, eBay defines a week as Monday through Sunday, Pacific Time.
Giving Detailed Star Ratings Properly
In addition to a feedback comment and rating (positive, negative, or neutral), 
buyers can leave detailed seller ratings, too. After the buyer types a com-
ment, he or she is prompted to rate the seller with one to five stars on four 
different factors of the transaction. Figure 5-1 shows the specific rating fac-
tors, and Table 5-1 outlines what the stars mean.

As I buyer, I lean more with 
being very satisfied that I got 
enough communication from 
the seller, or not. If I get one 
e-mail, I’m usually satisfied. But 
if I haven’t heard from a seller 
until the item reaches my door, 
I’m definitely rating in the 2-star 
range.
How quickly

ship the

1 = Very slowly
2 = Slowly
3 = Neither slowly or

4 = Quickly

Now, here I have another issue: 
As a buyer, you need to check 
the postmark on the package you 
receive. If the seller ships the 
next day or the next — you’ve 
got to click 5 (Very Quickly), 
no matter how long the postal 
service took to get it there. 
How reason-
able were 
the shipping 
and handling 
charges?
1 = Very unreasonable
2 = Unreasonable
3 = Neither unreasonable 
or reasonable
4 = Reasonable
5 = Very reasonable
When I purchase an item, I 
know what the shipping cost 
will be. The only surprise here is 
when you get an item in a small 
envelope and you’ve paid $9.00 
for shipping — or if you paid 
for Priority Mail and it comes in 
another class of service. This is, 
to me, pretty black-and-white. 
It’s either going to be reason-
able or not.
Here are some other items to keep in mind when you’re deciding on the 
Detailed Star Ratings for sellers:
 ✦ Shipping takes time: As a buyer. you can choose Ground or Priority 
Mail (for the most part), and you’ve got to realize that Ground shipping 
can take up to 10 days. This isn’t the seller’s fault. So before leaving this 
rating, make sure to always check the postmark or the date on the ship-
ping label.

84
Becoming a Star
 ✦ Shipping costs money: Sellers have to add a little charge to cover the 
costs of tape, boxes, and packing materials. As a buyer, you’ve got to keep 
that in mind. If you are unfamiliar with postage rates, you should also 
know that a package costs a lot more to ship across the country than to 
ship to the next state. So do a little homework and evaluate shipping costs 
before you buy. If the shipping is too high, go to another seller.
 ✦ Ratings affect the seller’s costs: If your seller is a PowerSeller, you 
should also know that your star ratings affect the fees he or she pays to 
eBay. Being a good seller (with high DSRs) can save as much as 20% on 
Final Values Fees, so your rating is a very serious matter. Visit Book VIII, 
Chapter 5 for the lowdown on how these ratings affect the PowerSeller’s 
pocketbook.
Becoming a Star
Yes, eBay loves the stars. When you first join eBay, it seems like everyone 
on eBay has a star next to the user ID except for you. It’s so unfair isn’t it? 
Well, not really. The stars of many colors are awarded based on the amount 
of your feedback rating. When you receive a feedback rating of 10, you get a 
bright new gold star (just like in school).
You may notice stars of other colors — even shooting stars; Table 5-2 gives 
you the lowdown on what each star color represents.
Table 5-2

Leaving Feedback with Finesse
Leaving Feedback with Finesse
Writing feedback well takes some practice. It isn’t a matter of saying things; 
it’s a matter of saying only the appropriate things. Think carefully about what 
you want to say — because once you submit feedback, it stays with the 
person for the duration of his or her eBay career. I think you should always 
leave feedback, especially at the end of a transaction, although doing so isn’t 
mandatory. Think of leaving feedback as voting in an election: If you don’t 
leave feedback, you can’t complain about lousy service.
eBay says to make feedback “factual and emotionless.” You won’t go wrong 
if you comment on the details (either good or bad) of the transaction. If 
you have any questions about what eBay says about feedback, click the 
Community link in the navigation bar and on the resulting page click the 
Feedback Forum link at the top of the page.
In the Feedback Forum, you can perform the following feedback-related tasks:
 ✦ Leave Feedback: Here, you see all pending feedback for all transactions 
within the past 90 days — the ones for which you haven’t left feedback. 
Fill them in, one at a time. Then, with one click, you can leave as many 
as 25 feedback comments at once.
 ✦ View a Feedback profile: Clicking here allows you to type any eBay 
member’s ID to see that person’s feedback profile (the same as if you 
clicked the number next to the member’s name).
 ✦ Reply to Feedback received: If you’ve received feedback that you’d like 
to respond to, click this link.
 ✦ Follow up to Feedback left: Here, you may also leave follow-up feedback 
after the initial feedback should situations change.
 ✦ Make Feedback Public or Private: This is where you can decide to show 
your feedback profile to the public or keep it to yourself. Remember, if 
you make your feedback profile private, you will hinder your future busi-
ness on eBay.
On this page, you also have more links that explain the ins and out of the 
eBay feedback system. Here are the details on a few:
 ✦ Feedback Help: A link that talks you to an exclusive help area for feed-
back questions.
 ✦ Feedback Policies: Learn about Feedback policies and the various forms

Leaving Feedback with Finesse
 
In the real world (at least in the modern American version of it), anybody 
can sue anybody else for slander or libel; this fact holds true on the Internet, 
too. Be careful not to make any comments that could be libelous or slander-
ous. eBay is not responsible for your actions, so if you’re sued because of 
negative feedback (or anything else you’ve written), you’re on your own. The 
best way to keep yourself safe is to stick to the facts and don’t get personal.
 
If you’re angry, take a huge breather before you type your complaints and 
click the Leave Comment button. If you’re convinced that negative feedback 
is necessary, try a cooling-off period before you send comments. Wait an 
hour or a day and then see whether you feel the same. Nasty feedback based 
on emotion can make you look vindictive, even if what you’re saying is true.
How to get positive feedback
If you’re selling, here’s how to get a good 
reputation:
 ✓ Establish contact with the buyer (pronto!) 
after the auction ends.
 ✓ After you’ve received payment, send out 
the item quickly.
 ✓ Make sure that your item is exactly the way 
you described it.
 ✓ Package the item well and ship it with 
care.
 ✓ React quickly and appropriately to 
problems — for example, the item’s lost or 
damaged in the mail or the buyer is slow 
in paying.
If you’re buying, try these good-rep tips:
 ✓ Send your payment fast.
 ✓ Keep in touch via e-mail with the seller.
 ✓ Work with the seller to resolve any 
problemsin a courteous manner.
How to get negative feedback:
If you’re selling, here’s what to do to tarnish 
your name big time:
 ✓ Tell a major fib in the item description. 
(Defend truth, justice, and legitimate 
creative writing — see Book III.)
 ✓ Take the money but “forget” to ship the 
item.
 ✓ Package the item poorly so that it ends up 
smashed, squashed, or vaporized during 
shipping. (To avoid this pathetic fate, see 
Book VII.)
If you’re buying, here’s how to make your status 
a serious mess:
 ✓ Bid on an item, win the auction, and never 
respond to the seller.
 ✓ String the seller out with constant claims of 
“the check is in the mail.”
 ✓ Ask the seller for a refund because you just 
don’t like the item.

Safety tips for giving feedback
And speaking of safety features you should know about feedback, you may 
want to study up on these:
 ✦ Remember that feedback, whether good or bad, is sticky. eBay won’t 
remove your feedback comment if you change your mind later. Be sure 
of your facts and carefully consider what you want to say.
 ✦ Before you leave feedback, read what other people had to say about that 
person. See whether what you’re thinking is in line with the comments 
others have left.
 ✦ Your feedback comment can be left as long as the transaction remains 
on the eBay server. This is usually within 60 days of the end of the auc-
tion. After 60 days have passed, you may still be able to leave feedback if 
you have the transaction number.
 ✦ Your comment can be a maximum of 80 letters, which is really short 
when you have a lot to say. Before you start typing, organize your 
thoughts and use common abbreviations to save precious space.
 ✦ Before posting negative feedback, try to resolve the problem by e-mail 
or telephone. You may discover that your reaction to the transaction is 
based on a misunderstanding that can be easily resolved.
 ✦ eBay users generally want to make each other happy, so use negative 
feedback only as a last desperate resort.
 
If, as a buyer, you leave a negative or neutral comment that you later regret, 
you can change it. You can go back to follow up and leave an explanation or 
a more positive comment and change the initial feedback. If you write a nice 
e-mail to the other person in the transaction and are able to solve a problem, 
make the change. See the “eBay will consider removing feedback if . . .” 
sidebar.
The ways to leave feedback
Several ways are available to leave feedback comments:
 ✦ If you’re on the user’s feedback page, click the Leave Feedback link; the 
Leave Feedback page appears.
 ✦ In the Buy — Won or the Sold area of your My eBay page, click the Leave 
Feedback link next to the transaction.
 ✦ Go to the listing and click the Leave Feedback link.

88
Leaving Feedback with Finesse
 ✦ In the Feedback Forum, click the Leave Feedback link to see a list of all 
your completed auctions from the last 60 days for which you haven’t left 
feedback.
 ✦ On your My eBay page, scroll down and on the left side you will see the 
Shortcuts heading. This will take you to your pending Feedback list.
 ✦ Click the Community link, in the main navigation bar, and then click 
eBay Feedback Forum. On the next page that appears, click the Leave 
Feedback link.
Mincing words: The at-a-glance guide 
to keeping feedback short
eBay likes to keep things simple. If you want to compliment, complain, or take the middle road, you 
have to do it in 80 characters or less. That means your comment needs to be short and sweet (or 
short and sour if it’s negative, or sweet and sour if you’re mixing drinks or ordering Chinese food). 
If you have a lot to say but you’re stumped about how to say it, here are a few examples for any 
occasion. String them together or mix and match!
Positive feedback:
 ✓ Very professional
 ✓ Quick e-mail response
 ✓ Fast service
 ✓ A+++
 ✓ Good communication
 ✓ Exactly as described
 ✓ Highly recommended
 ✓ Smooth transaction
 ✓ Would deal with again
 ✓ An asset to eBay
 ✓ I’ll be back!
Negative feedback:
 ✓ Never responded
 ✓ Never paid for item
 ✓ Check bounced, never made good
 ✓ Beware track record
 ✓ Item not as described
Neutral feedback:
 ✓ Slow to ship but item as described
 ✓ Item not as described but seller made 
good
 ✓ Paid w/MO (money order) after check 
bounced
 ✓ Poor communication but item came OK

Leaving Feedback with Finesse
To leave feedback for a seller, follow these steps:
 1. Enter the required information.
 
 Note that your item number is usually filled in, but if you’re placing feed-
back from the user’s feedback page, you need to have the number 
at hand.
 2. Choose whether you want your feedback to be positive, negative, or 
neutral.
 3. Type your feedback comment.
 4. Fill in your star ratings by clicking the stars next to the questions 
(as I discuss in the earlier section, “Giving Properly Detailed Star 
Ratings”).
 5. Click the Leave Feedback button.
Only under certain, special circumstances will 
eBay remove feedback:
 ✓ eBay is served with a court order stating 
that the feedback in question is slanderous, 
libelous, defamatory, or otherwise illegal. 
eBay will also accept a settlement agree-
ment from a resolved lawsuit submitted by 
both attorneys and signed by both parties.
 ✓ The feedback in question has no relation to 
eBay — such as comments about transac-
tions outside eBay or personal comments 
about users.
 ✓ The feedback contains a link to another 
page, picture, or JavaScript.
 ✓ The feedback is comprised of profane or 
vulgar language.
 ✓ The feedback contains any personal iden-
tifying information about a user.
 ✓ The feedback refers to any investigation, 
whether by eBay or a law-enforcement 
organization.
 ✓ The feedback is left by a user who supplied
fraudulent contact information when 
registering on eBay.
 ✓ The feedback is left by a person who can 
be identified as a minor.
 ✓ The feedback is left by a user as harassment.
 ✓ The feedback is intended for another 
user, when eBay has been informed of the 
situation and the same feedback has been 
left for the appropriate user.
eBay used to permit Buyers and Sellers to 
mutually withdraw feedback once they agreed 
the transaction went OK. This is no longer 
the policy. To check on the current feedback 
removal policies, go to

You Have the Last Word — Responding to Feedback
You Have the Last Word — Responding to Feedback
After reading feedback you’ve received from others, you may feel compelled 
to respond. If the feedback is negative, you may want to defend yourself. If 
it’s positive, you may want to say thank you.
 
Do not confuse responding to feedback with leaving feedback. Responding 
does not change the other user’s feedback rating; it merely adds your 
response below the feedback comment in your own feedback profile.
To respond to feedback, follow these steps:
 1. Click the Leave Feedback link of your My eBay page, to the scroll to 
the bottom of the next page and click the Feedback Forum link.
 
 You’re transported to the Feedback Forum page.
 2. Click the Reply to Feedback Received link.
 3. When you find the feedback you want to respond to, click the Reply link.
 4. Type your response.
 
You have another recourse if, as a seller, you receive negative or neutral 
feedback. eBay’s Feedback Revision policy enables buyers to change feed-
back rating, comments, and DSRs under certain circumstances. First, the 
seller must address the cause for negative or neutral feedback to the buyer’s 
satisfaction. Then, the seller can send a Feedback Revision request to the 
buyer (with a limit of 5 requests per 1000 feedback earned during a 12-month 
period), and the buyer has the option to accept or decline that request. For 
how-to information on feedback revision, go to
pages.ebay.com/help/feedback/revision-request.html
Scrutinizing a Seller’s Reputation
You’ve finally found an item you’d like to buy. Don’t place that bid just yet! 
Studying the seller’s feedback will supply you with a good deal of informa-
tion about the reputation of your potential trading partner.
 
The more expensive your transaction, the more intense your investigation 
may need to be. An unblemished feedback rating may not be as significant 
on a $9 purchase as it is for a $200 purchase.
I want you to be thoroughly educated in how the feedback system works. I’m 
not trying to be bossy. I’m just saying that buyers and sellers (especially those 
of us who have been using eBay for several years) take this stuff seriously. If 
you’re just a dabbler, however, I can understand why you might want to opt

Scrutinizing a Seller’s Reputation
Privacy in feedback may not be a good thing
I believe in the adage, “Keep your business 
private,” except when it refers to feedback. 
In your eBay dealings, you may come upon a 
seller with private or hidden feedback. Most 
users show their comments, and eBay’s default 
setting is for public viewing of feedback. This 
way, everyone at eBay can read all about you.
If you want to make your feedback a private 
matter, you need to go to the Feedback Forum 
(click the Feedback Forum link on the bottom 
of the eBay home page or from the Community 
link in the navigation bar). On the resulting 
page, click the Make Your Feedback Profile 
Public or Private link, and you’ll see the page 
shown here.
Hiding your feedback comments is a bad idea. 
You want people to know that you’re trustwor-
thy; being honest and upfront is the way to go. 
If you hide your feedback, people may suspect 
that you’re covering up bad things. It’s in your 
best interest to let the spotlight shine on your 
feedback history.
Your feedback is your reputation, your money, 
and your experience as an eBay member. Keep 
in mind that all three are always linked.
for the “light” version of the eBay feedback system and save the high-octane 
rendition of a feedback investigation for when you decide to buy that yacht 
or the British crown jewels.
Conducting a “light” seller examination
As you look at the items for sale on eBay (both in auctions and in fixed-price 
sales), you’ll notice that along with every auction listing you can find infor-
mation about the seller in eBay’s Seller Information box. Figure 5-2 shows 
you four Meet the Seller boxes; notice the differences in their reputations.
The Meet the Seller box gives you a very small picture of the seller’s feed-
back reputation. It only shows the seller’s ID and feedback rating, including 
his or her star award level. (Check out Chapter 4 to get the lowdown on the 
Meet the Seller box.)

92
Scrutinizing a Seller’s Reputation
 
Figure 5-2: 
Meet the 
seller boxes 
from four 
different 
sellers, 
including 
me.
 
Consider a quick glance at the Meet the Seller box to be the lightweight ver-
sion of a feedback investigation. A perfunctory glance at this box might be 
okay if your purchase is for an item that’s worth a few dollars to you — and 
if the seller’s information box shows you 99% to 100% positive feedback (as 
in two of the four examples in Figure 5-1). However, if the Meet the Seller box 
looks closer to the second or fourth example, and you’re looking at a pricier 
item, it’s time for a more thorough analysis.
 
Even though the seller in the second example has a high overall feedback 
rating, the percentage of positive comments is a little lower, and suggests 
that further examination might be a good idea.
Making a full-scale seller investigation
When you consider buying a more expensive item, be sure to click the 
seller’s feedback number when you visit the auction-item page. Clicking the 
number will show you the member profile: the Feedback Summary and the 
DSR ratings, shown in Figure 5-3 and 5-4.
 
Figure 5-3: 
A sample 
member 
profile.
 
After you click the feedback number, you should examine some important 
details if you want to be a savvy, security-minded shopper.

Detailed Seller Ratings
Feedback summary
On the left side of the page you will see Recent Feedback Ratings and on the 
right, the seller’s member profile. You will see the counts of feedback com-
ments divided by time periods: 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months. Note the 
following significant entries:
 ✦ Positive Feedback comments: You may notice that the actual number 
of positive comments is higher than the positive figure. This is because 
every eBay community member can comment only once on another 
member and have it count in the feedback rating. (The net rating was 
previously based on comments from unique users.)
 
 For example, when you buy an item from me and we leave each other 
feedback (glowingly positive, I’m sure), and then next month I buy some-
thing from you, the feedback we leave on the second transaction (again, 
glowingly positive) these days it not only feels good, it counts. In the 
old days, it didn’t count toward our total feedback rating (though it did 
appear on the feedback summary page). Since then eBay has changed 
that policy; all feedback entries count as long as they’re left in different 
weeks.
 ✦ Neutral comments: Neutral comments are usually left when a party 
wasn’t thrilled with the transaction but nothing happened that was bad 
enough to leave a dreaded, reputation-ruining negative comment. You 
may also notice that some long-time eBay users have neutral comments 
that were previously converted from users no longer registered.
 
 For a very short while, eBay had a policy that when a member was 
suspended (yes, members do get suspended) or the member chose to 
cancel his or her eBay membership, eBay turned all the feedback that 
member ever left or received (whether it was positive or negative) into 
neutral feedback.
 
 This policy didn’t last long because the eBay members put up such a 
fuss that eBay listened and stopped the practice. Unfortunately, eBay 
didn’t rescind the neutrals that had been put in place.
 ✦ Negative comments: The number of negative comments may also vary, 
just as the positives do, for the same reason.
Detailed Seller Ratings
This is where all those little stars you place when leaving Feedback show up. 
You’ll be able to see how many ratings have been left for each category and 
where the Average Rating lies, as in Figure 5-4.

Member profile
Also part of this comprehensive feedback page is the eBay member profile, 
which carries historic information about the member: Think of your feed-
back profile as an eBay report card. Your goal is to get straight As — in this 
case, all positive feedback. Unlike a real report card, you don’t have to bring 
it home to be signed; here’s what you find on it:
 ✦ User ID: The eBay member’s nickname appears, followed by a number in 
parentheses — the net number of the positive feedback comments the 
person has received, minus any negative feedback comments.
 ✦ Member links box: This area contains data and links. The important 
piece of data is the date the person signed up as a member of the eBay 
community. Below that are the links: the country from which the seller 
is registered, links to the member’s eBay store (if the seller has one, of 
course), his or her other auctions (where you can see whether the seller 
is experienced in selling the type of item you’re looking to buy), his or 
her ID history (where you can view the seller’s past user IDs, if any), and 
the seller’s About Me page.
 ✦ Contact member: Click the Contact Member button to view an e-mail form 
allowing you to send an e-mail to the member through eBay’s e-mail system.
 ✦ Recent ratings: In a snapshot, you can see the seller’s recent eBay his-
tory for the past month, six months, and twelve months. This data is 
useful because often the last couple of months’ transactions tell the tale. 
If a previously reliable eBay seller has decided to join the Dark Side, 
here is where the evidence will show up first. A number of new negative 
comments from different buyers constitute a definite danger sign (even 
if the seller has an overall high rating)!

Book I
Chapter 5
Checking Out the 
Seller and Leaving 
Feedback
95
Detailed Seller Ratings
 
 
 If the last few transactions are negative in the recent reviews, think 
twice about doing further business with the seller, but that doesn’t mean 
you should count the seller out completely. If the item is really a must-
have, click the ID of the person (or persons) who left the negative feed-
back and ask politely for details so you can make your own decisions. 
Sadly, many buyers leave negative feedback for a seller before giving the 
seller an opportunity to make things right, so by getting the details, you 
can make your own decisions.
 ✦ Bid retractions: A history of bidding on items and then changing one’s 
mind is a danger signal more for sellers than for buyers. As a buyer, you 
may, under certain circumstances, retract your bid (see Chapter 6). Just 
note that each time you retract your bid from an auction, the retraction 
shows up in this area. Sellers often check this area to determine a bid-
der’s reliability.
 
Be careful when you retract a bid. All bids on eBay are binding, but under 
what eBay calls exceptional circumstances, you may retract bids — sparingly. 
Here are the circumstances in which it’s okay to retract a bid:
 ✦ If you’ve mistakenly put in the wrong bid amount — say, $100 instead 
of $10
 ✦ If the seller adds to his or her description after you’ve placed your bid, 
and the change considerably affects the item
 ✦ If you can’t authenticate the seller’s identity by reaching him or her by 
phone or by e-mail
 ✦ If a bid has been placed in your name by someone other than you
 
You can’t retract a bid just because you found the item elsewhere for less, 
or you changed your mind, or you decided that you can’t afford the item.
Reading feedback reviews
Scrolling down the feedback history page, you’ll be able to read the actual 
reviews left by other eBay members. In Figure 5-5, you’ll see a sample of my 
current feedback. You see each the member’s user ID, along with his or her 
feedback rating and comment.

96
Detailed Seller Ratings
If you notice that the seller has a small Me icon 
next to his or her user ID, click the icon to learn 
more about the seller. Every eBay member 
may have his or her own home page on eBay 
called the About Me page (you can have one, 
too). The About Me page is where members 
talk about themselves, their businesses, and 
their collections. For example, you can find my 
About Me page at
http://members.ebay.com/
aboutme/marsha_c
I came across the About Me page in the figure 
when I was looking at an auction for a Limoges 
plate. This is a great example of how eBay 
members show their personalities and build 
trustworthy person-to-person (rather than 
computer-to-computer) relationships with 
other members of the eBay community.
Check the seller’s About Me page
 
If a new seller (without a lot of feedback) does 
the smart thing — puts up an About Me page 
and talks about his or her eBay goals and 
business — you may feel more comfortable 
about doing business with that person.
By default, you see the All Feedback Received tab. You may use the other 
tabs at the top of the page to sort the comments as follows:
 ✦ Feedback as a Seller: These are comments from people who bought 
something from this seller.

Book I
Chapter 5
Checking Out the 
Seller and Leaving 
Feedback
97
Detailed Seller Ratings
 ✦ Feedback as a Buyer: When you buy and play by the rules, you get some 
positive feedback.
 ✦ All Feedback: A conglomeration of all feedback left for the particular 
member, regardless of whether that person was a buyer or a seller in a 
transaction.
 ✦ Feedback Left for Others: Checking the type of feedback someone 
leaves about others can give you an insight into his or her personality. 
When considering making a big purchase, I always check this area; it 
helps me know the type of person I’m dealing with. When you read feed-
back that makes nasty slams at the other person, or if the person uses 
rude words or phrases when leaving feedback, it’s a clue that you may 
be dealing with a loose cannon.
 
Figure 5-5:

Here’s what else you see:
 ✦ The date the feedback was left, along with the transaction number. If the 
transaction is 90 days old or less, there is a clickable link to the transac-
tion called View Item.
 ✦ Seller or Buyer on the right side of each comment. Seller means that the 
feedback was left by the seller in the transaction, and Buyer means it 
was left by a buyer.

98
Comparing Items Before Buying
Many independent eBay sellers are experienced buyers as well as sellers — 
they have an excellent grasp of how eBay feels from a customer’s point of 
view, and know how to handle any of your concerns.
 
Here are some tips for assessing feedback, depending on the situation:
 ✦ When buying from a seller who sells the same item repeatedly, use the 
clickable links to past transactions to see whether other buyers of the 
same item were pleased with their purchases.
 ✦ When you come across neutral or negative feedback, look for the seller’s 
response. A seller or a buyer may respond to the feedback by clicking 
the Reply to feedback received link at the bottom of the feedback page.
 
 
 The feedback system relies on the expectation that members give each 
other the benefit of the doubt. When you come across negative (or neu-
tral) feedback about a seller, look for the seller’s response and see 
whether the problem was resolved before making your final judgment. 
You may even see a follow-up feedback comment from the buyer saying 
that everything has been settled.
Comparing Items Before Buying
By examining the results of your eBay search, you can get some useful infor-
mation as to which item is the best deal.
In Figure 5-6, I performed a search for the Poodle Hat CD from Weird Al 
Yankovic. (This CD features his famous “eBay Song,” a parody of the 
Backstreet Boy’s version of “I Want It That Way.” It’s hysterical!).
By looking at the result I can identify certain facts about each listing:
 ✦ Item title: A clickable link to the listing and a link to watch this item.
 ✦ Price: The current bid or the Buy It Now price.
 ✦ Shipping cost: The seller’s shipping cost to your ZIP code is posted for 
comparison, provided the seller input the flat shipping fee when the 
item was posted for auction or sale. If you don’t see a shipping cost, you 
have to click the title to read the description.
 ✦ Bid or Buy it Now: See the number of bids that have been placed on 
an item or if the item is available for a flat sales price. This information 
gives you a quick snapshot of the costs for the item you’re searching for.
 ✦ Time Left: The countdown to the end of the auction or fixed-price sale 
listing.

Getting Protection on eBay
One thing’s for sure in this world: Nothing is for sure. That’s why insurance 
and bonding companies exist. Several forms of protection are available for 
eBay users:
 ✦ Insurance that buyers purchase to cover shipping (see Book VII, Chapter 3)
 ✦ eBay Motors Vehicle Purchase Protection
 ✦ PayPal buyer protection
 ✦ BuySAFE bond
 ✦ Verified Rights Owner program
For more information on how to acquire various protections for your buyers, 
see Book VIII, Chapter 2.
eBay Motors Vehicle Purchase Protection
A major benefit of buying a car on eBay is that you are covered against 
certain losses associated with some types of fraud. To qualify (this is the 
easy part), you simply need to purchase the car on eBay. (See? I told you it 
was simple.)

100
Getting Protection on eBay
The Protection Plan gives you some pretty specific protections, such 
as these: 
 ✦ You pay for a vehicle and never receive it. 
 ✦ You send a refundable deposit for a vehicle and never receive it. 
 ✦ You pay for a vehicle and receive it but suffer losses because 
 
• The vehicle was determined by a law enforcement agency to have 
been stolen at the time of the end of the listing. 
 
• The vehicle has an undisclosed or unknown lien against its title. 
 
• The vehicle make, model or year is different than what was 
described in the seller’s listing at the time you placed your bid or 
offer. 
 
• A title is required for the vehicle by your state and the seller’s state 
but you did not receive a title from the seller and it is not possible to 
obtain a title from the appropriate DMV. 
 
• The vehicle has a title with an undisclosed salvage, rebuilt/rebuild-
able, unrebuildable, reconstructed, scrapped/destroyed, junk, 
lemon, manufacturer-buyback, or water-damage brand at the time of 
the end of the listing. (This protection is not available for vehicles 
listed in the Dune Buggies, Race Cars, or Trailers categories.) 
 
• The vehicle is less than 20 years old and has more than a 5,000-mile 
odometer discrepancy from the mileage as stated in the seller’s list-
ing. (This protection is only available for vehicles listed in the Cars & 
Trucks and RVs & Campers categories.) 
 
• The vehicle had undisclosed engine, body, transmission, and/
or frame damage at the time of purchase that will cost more than 
$1,000 to repair. The cost of repair to any one of those components 
must exceed $1,000. For vehicles in the Boats (engine and hull only), 
Buses, Commercial Trucks, and RVs & Campers categories, the cost 
of the undisclosed engine, body, transmission, or frame damage 
must exceed $1,500. Vehicles in the Race Cars category are not eli-
gible for this protection (gee, I wonder why).

PayPal buyer protection
Aside from safety, PayPal offers an even better reason to pay through their 
service. If you’ve purchased your item through a PayPal-verified seller, you 
may be covered for your purchase up to $2,000.

like you. No one at eBay owns the items, and no one at eBay can guarantee 
that any item is as described in auction listings. That means you could, theo-
retically, buy a “genuine” Kate Spade purse on eBay for $24, and immediately 
realize when it arrives that the purse is counterfeit. That’s not eBay’s fault. 
(Shame on you for thinking you could get that kind of deal on a new Kate 
Spade purse — but if you can, for real, e-mail me and let me know where.)
Just because eBay doesn’t take the blame for its fraudulent sellers’ handi-
work doesn’t mean that eBay doesn’t care if you get duped. Their VeRO 
(Verified Rights Owner) program connects eBay with companies or persons 
who care to protect their intellectual property rights (such as a copyright, 
trademark, or patent) against possible infringements in eBay listings. VeRO 
members send proof to eBay that they own the specified intellectual prop-
erty. In return, they can report infringements to eBay — and eBay’s listing 
police will end the counterfeit listings. This is not an automatic service, 
however, and the property owners are responsible for finding their own 
infringements on the site.
Many VeRO members have their own About Me pages. To see a list of links 
to these pages, go to
http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/vero-aboutme.html
SquareTrade membership
Although the SquareTrade Seal used to be a 
way to assure the buyer that a seller main-
tained quality standards; these days it’s more 
of a membership plan. The seller pays $9.50 a 
month to get a very official-looking seal that is 
updated daily.
The other benefit to sellers is that they can sell 
high-quality warranties from Square Trade to 
their buyers. The warranties are commission-
able to the seller, and can easily outweigh the 
monthly membership fee.
It’s unlikely that a SquareTrade seal holder is 
going to defraud you. SquareTrade checks sell-
ers’ feedback and reports on a daily basis to 
be sure they’re playing within the eBay rules. 
SquareTrade yanks back its seal of approval if 
anything fishy is going on.

A
 few years ago, on the day after Christmas, I was on The Today Show 
with Matt Lauer talking about after-holiday bargains on eBay. This 
wasn’t the first time I’d been on the show with him; but this time Matt 
seemed very interested in getting a deal on a child’s lamp that I happened to 
be selling. He and his wife had just had a baby, and everyone likes a bargain.
If everyone likes a bargain, then I’m not like everyone — because I love 
bargains! When I was teaching classes at eBay’s own eBay University (yes, 
there really was one), my favorite class to teach was Buying and Browsing, 
because I love the thrill of the chase and the acquisition of a good deal with-
out all the haggling.
Often, the first thing that people ask me is how they can stop getting outbid 
at the last minute of an auction. I always say the same thing — become an 
expert sniper and bid higher than the other guy!
Okay, but how? In this chapter I give you my tips and a few I picked up from 
other wise shoppers along the way.
 
eBay treats every bid — other than bids on some real estate sales or incor-
rectly placed bids — as binding. If you win an auction and do not go through 
with your commitment by purchasing the item, the seller will file an Unpaid 
Item (UPI) notice on you. If you establish a history as a nonpaying bidder 
with eBay (that is, you repeatedly back out of purchasing what you bid on), 
you have a strong chance of getting suspended from the community.
How much an item sells for depends on how many people see the item and 
how badly other bidders want it. You may think of the retail price or book 
value as a standard for pricing, but neither may be accurate when it comes 
to shopping on eBay. In fact, I say everything has three prices:

104
Understanding the Bidding Action
 ✦ The price a retailer charges for an item at the store
 ✦ The price everyone says something is worth
 ✦ The price an item actually sells for on eBay
Understanding the Bidding Action
Okay, you’ve found the perfect item to track (say, a really classy Elvis 
Presley wristwatch), and it’s in your price range. You’re more than inter-
ested — you’re ready to bid. If this were a live auction, some stodgy-looking 
guy in a gray suit would see you nod your head and start the bidding at, say, 
$2. Then some woman with a severe hairdo would yank on her ear, and the 
Elvis watch would jump to $3.
eBay reality is more like this: You’re sitting at home in your fuzzy slippers, 
sipping coffee in front of the computer. All the other bidders are cruising 
cyberspace in their pajamas, too, but you can’t see ’em. (Be real thankful for 
little favors.)
When you’re ready to jump into the eBay fray, find the bidding form (shown 
in Figure 6-1) at the bottom of the auction item page or click the Place Bid 
button at the top of the auction page. If the item includes a Buy It Now 
option, you see that next to the bid form.

Understanding the Bidding Action
Placing your bid
To fill out the bidding form and place a bid, first make sure that you’re 
registered. (For help in registering, see Chapter 3.) After you make your first 
bid on an item, you can instantly get to auctions you’re bidding on from your 
My eBay page. Follow these steps to place a bid:
 1. Sign in to your eBay account.
 2. Click the Buy It Now button on your selected item’s page and enter 
your maximum bid in the appropriate box.
 
 The bid needs to be higher than the current minimum bid.
 3. If this is a multiple-item auction you will see a Quantity line and a 
number indicating that there is more than 1.pf the item Enter the 
quantity of items that you’re bidding on.
 
 (If it’s not a multiple-item auction, the quantity is always 1.) Figure 6-2 
shows a multiple-item auction bidding form.
 
Figure 6-2: 
The 
multiple-
item auction 
bidding form 
requires you 
to enter the 
quantity of 
the items.
 
 
 
 You don’t need to put in the dollar sign, but you do need to use a deci-
mal point — unless you really want to pay $1049.00 instead of $10.49. If 
you make a mistake with an incorrect decimal point, you can retract 
your bid (see “Retracting Your Bid in an Emergency,” at the end of this 
chapter).
 4. Click Place Bid (or Buy It Now if you’re making a direct purchase).
 
 The Review and Commit to Buy page, as shown in Figure 6-3, appears on 
your screen, filling it with all the costs involved in purchasing the item. 
This is your last chance to change your mind: Do you really want the 
item, and can you really buy it? To quote the form, “You are agreeing to 
a contract . . . You will enter into a legally binding contract to purchase 
the item from the seller.” The bottom line is this: If you bid on it and you 
win, you buy it.

106
Understanding the Bidding Action
 5. If you agree to the terms, click Commit to Buy.
 
 After you agree, the Bid Confirmation screen appears.
 
Figure 6-3: 
The serious 
part — 
Commit to 
Buy.
 
 
eBay’s computer sends you an e-mail confirming your bid, if you’ve indicated 
that you want confirmation e-mails. However, eBay’s mail server can be as 
slow as a tree-sloth marathon (yours would be, too, if you had a few million 
auctions to track), so don’t rely on eBay to keep track of your auctions. After 
all, this is your money at stake.
 
eBay considers a bid on an item to be a binding contract. You can save your-
self a lot of heartache if you promise to never bid on an item you don’t intend 
to buy. Don’t make spurious bids on the silly assumption that because you’re 
new to eBay, you can’t win; if you do that, you’ll probably win simply 
because you’ve left yourself open to Murphy’s Law. Therefore, before you go 
to the bidding form, be sure that you’re in this auction for the long haul — 
and make yourself another promise to figure out the maximum you’re willing 
to spend — and stick to it.

http://pages.ebay.com/education/tutorial/course1/bidding/
Bidding to the max with automatic (proxy) bidding
When you make a maximum bid on the bidding form, you actually make 
several small bids — again and again — until the bidding reaches where you 
told it to stop. For example, if the current bid is up to $19.99 and you put 
in a maximum of $45.02, your bid automatically increases incrementally so 
you’re ahead of the competition — at least until someone else’s maximum 
bid exceeds yours. Basically, you bid by proxy, which means the automatic-
bid feature stands in for you so your bid rises incrementally in response to 
other bidders’ bids.

Book I
Chapter 6

107
Understanding the Bidding Action
No one else knows for sure whether you’re bidding automatically, and no one 
knows how high your maximum bid is. And the best part is that you can be 
out having a life of your own while the proxy bidding happens automatically.
The bid increment is the amount of money by which a bid is raised, and 
eBay’s system can work in mysterious ways. Buyers and sellers have no 
control over the bid increments that eBay sets. The current maximum bid 
can jump up a nickel or a quarter or even an Andrew Jackson, but there is 
a method to the madness, even though you may not think so. To determine 
how much to increase the bid increment, eBay uses a bid-increment formula 
that’s based on the current high bid. Here’s an example:
 ✦ A 5-quart bottle of cold cream has a current high bid of $14.95. The bid 
increment is $0.50 — meaning that if you bid by proxy, your automatic 
bid will be $15.45.
 ✦ A 5-ounce can of top-notch caviar has a high bid of $200. The bid 
increment is $2.50. If you choose to bid by proxy, your bid will be 
$202.50.
Table 6-1 shows you what kind of magic happens when you put the proxy 
system and a bid-increment formula together in the same cyber-room.

The Secret’s in the Timing
A bricks-and-mortar auction, such as those held by Sotheby’s or Christie’s, 
ends when the bidding ends. No auctioneer is going to cut off the feverish 
bidding for that one-of-a-kind Van Gogh, right? As long as someone is bid-
ding, all systems are go. The last bidder standing wins. Auctions on eBay, 
however, close at a prescribed time. Because of this fundamental difference 
in the way eBay runs its auctions, you need to do some special work to make 
sure that you can make the most strategically timed bid possible.
 
You can find out what time an auction ends by simply looking at the auction 
page. Note that eBay runs on Pacific Time and uses a 24-hour clock (00:00 to 
24:00 versus the more familiar 1:00 to 12:00).

Book I

109
The Secret’s in the Timing
To get the serious deals, you need to synchronize your computer’s clock 
with eBay’s. To find out what eBay’s official time is, go to
http://viv.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?EbayTime
Then compare eBay’s time with your computer’s clock. On most Windows-
based computers, the time is in the lower-right corner of the screen on the 
taskbar.
To change the time on your computer’s clock, follow these steps:
 1. Open your Internet browser and visit the following site:
 
 http://viv.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?EbayTime
 
 The official clock at the eBay mothership appears, in the form of the 
Official Time page. Keep the browser open.
 2. Right-click your computer’s taskbar and choose Adjust Date/Time.
 
 The Date/Time Properties window appears.
 3. Click the Internet browser to activate it, and then click the browser’s 
Refresh button.
 4. After the page refreshes, immediately type the official eBay time into 
your computer’s clock, and then click OK.
If your computer is running the Windows XP or Vista operating systems, 
the box that appears when you right-click the taskbar has a third option: 
Internet Time. In this window (see Figure 6-4) you can synchronize your 
computer’s clock to the Microsoft time server or the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology’s atomic clock.

The Secret’s in the Timing
Going, going, gone
Although many people list their auctions to end 
at all hours of the day and night, the amount of 
bidders in cyberspace is higher during certain 
hours. Between the hours of 23:00 (that’s 11:00 
p.m. Pacific Standard Time) and 03:00 (that’s 
3:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time), things run a 
bit slowly on eBay. If you’re online at that time, 
you may be able to take advantage of some 
very serious bargains. So swallow a shot of 
espresso and have fun if you’re a night owl.
Going, going, gone is the name of the game my 
daughter and I used to play when we wanted to 
go shopping for fun on eBay. Visit your favorite 
eBay category and have fun.
You can choose to view the auctions that are 
going to end in the next few hours by using the 
Search Options on the left side of the page. 
Here you can cruise the auction closing while 
the world is asleep, and bid to your heart’s con-
tent to get some great bargains.
Using the lounging-around strategy
Sometimes the best strategy at the beginning of an auction is to do nothing 
at all. That’s right; relax, take off your shoes, and loaf. You may want to make 
a token bid (the very lowest you are allowed) or mark the page to watch in 
your My eBay area. I generally take this attitude through the first six days of 
a week-long auction I want to bid on, and it works pretty well. I do, however, 
check in every day to keep tabs on the items I’m watching on the My eBay 
page, and I revise my strategy as time goes by.
 
The seller has the right to up the minimum bid — if the auction has received 
no bids — up to 12 hours before the auction ends. If the seller has set a ridic-
ulously low minimum bid and then sees that the auction is getting no action, 
the seller may choose to up the minimum bid to protect his or her sale. By 
placing the minimum token bid when you first see the auction, you can foil a 
Buy It Now from another bidder (because Buy It Now is disabled after a bid 
is in place) or prevent the seller from upping the minimum.

Book I
Chapter 6
Bidding to Win
111
Shopping the Machiavellian Way
 
If you see an item that you absolutely must have, mark it to watch on your 
My eBay page (or make a token bid) and revise your maximum bid as the 
auction goes on. I can’t stress enough how important this is.
As you check back each day, take a look at the other bids and the high 
bidder. Is someone starting a bidding war? Look at the time when the com-
petition is bidding and note any patterns, such as lunchtime bidding. If you 
know what time your major competition is bidding, you can bid after he or 
she does (preferably when your foe is stuck in rush-hour traffic).
Using the beat-the-clock strategy
You should rev up your bidding strategy during the final 24 hours of an auc-
tion and decide, once and for all, whether you really have to have the item 
you’ve been eyeing. Maybe you put in a maximum bid of $45.02 earlier in 
the week. Now’s the time to decide whether you’re willing to go as high as 
$50.02. Maybe $56.03?
No one wants to spend the day in front of the computer (ask almost anyone 
who does). Just place a sticky note where you’re likely to see it, remind-
ing you of the exact time the auction ends. If you’re not going to be near a 
computer when the auction closes, you can also use an automatic bidding 
software program to bid for you; see “Succeeding by Sniping,” later in this 
chapter, for details.
In the last few minutes
With a half hour left before the auction becomes ancient history, head for the 
computer and dig in for the last battle of the bidding war. I recommend that 
you log on to eBay about 10 to 15 minutes before the auction ends. The last 
thing you want is to get caught in Internet gridlock and not get access to the 
eBay Web site. Go to the items you’re watching and click the auction title.
With 10 minutes to go, if there’s a lot of action on your auction, click reload 
or refresh every 30 seconds to get the most current info on how many 
people are bidding.
Shopping the Machiavellian Way
When you’ve shopped eBay for a while, you will know the user IDs of many 
of the people who win against you in auctions. Don’t be surprised that 
other people in the eBay universe have the same quirky interests as you. 
Of course, even if that gives you something in common, you may come to 
dislike them if they outbid you often enough. It’s a wretched feeling, being 
outbid, especially when it happens at the last minute.

112
Shopping the Machiavellian Way
The user ID of the person the item would belong to if the auction ended right 
now is listed on the auction-item page (assuming someone has bid on the 
item). Take a look at this name because you may see it again in auctions for 
similar items. If the high bidder has lots of feedback, he or she may know the 
ropes — and be back to fight if you up the ante.
eBay has made this tactic a bit more difficult by changing the Bidder’s ID to 
a symbol (see Figure 6-5) that consists of numbers and asterisks. But once 
an auction is over, the winner’s ID is revealed (note that in the figure I have 
smudged out this particular actual winner’s ID, but you get the drift).
I remember once hearing a comedy routine about how much quicker it is to 
shop in a supermarket from other people’s carts rather than running from 
aisle to aisle — and eBay is no different. When you get to know the IDs of 
your bidding competitors, you can run bidder searches on them.
 
Figure 6-5:

Your two cents does matter — at least on eBay. 
Here’s why: Many eBay members round off 
their bids to the nearest dollar figure or choose 
familiar coin increments such as 25, 50, or 75 
cents. But the most successful eBay bidders 
have found that adding 2 or 3 cents to a routine 
bid can mean the difference between winning 
and losing. So I recommend that you make your 
bids in odd amounts, like $15.02 or $45.57, as 
an inexpensive way to edge out your competi-
tion. For the first time ever, your two cents may 
actually pay off!

Shopping the Machiavellian Way
For example, say meanguy123 outbids you in an auction for rare antique 
glockenspiels. You can run a bidder search on the old meany and find out 
what else he has been bidding on lately — and how much he bids.
You can find out the following information when you run a bidder search:
 ✦ The items the bidder tends to be interested in: Might as well let your 
competition do the legwork of finding good auctions for the items you like.
 ✦ What time of day the bidder likes to make bids: You can get a sense of 
whether the bidder is in another part of the country (or the world) and 
use the time difference to your advantage.
 ✦ Other bidding habits: Some bidders like to place an initial bid at the 
beginning of the auction and then swoop in at the end and snipe. Or they 
never bid until the end of the auction. Or they never snipe. No matter 
what strategy your competition chooses, you can come up with a coun-
ter-strategy to improve your likelihood of winning.
 ✦ How high the bidder tends to like to bid: This is a key to enable you to 
win the auction by as few pennies as possible. Does the bidder end with 
.27? End yours with .32. Also, if the bidder is accumulating items one at 
a time, you really have a good picture of exactly how much he or she will 
bid. Information is power!
Bidding in odd increments is just one of the many strategies to get you 
ahead of the rest of the bidding pack without paying more than you should. 
 
Many of the strategies in this chapter are for bidders who are tracking an 
item over the course of a week or more, so be sure you have time to track 
the item and plan your next move. Also, get a few auctions under your belt 
before you throw yourself into the middle of a bidding war.
Investigating the opposing bidder is not snooping! It’s totally legal and 
acceptable. (Okay, maybe it’s a little sneaky.) When you’ve checked out your 
competition’s shopping cart, you can swoop in and bid or snipe back if you 
like the other items this bidder is interested in. Isn’t it easier to let someone 
else do the legwork and find the bargains for you?
You can run a bidder search by doing the following:
 1. Click the Advanced Search link, which appears next to the Search box 
that appears on almost every eBay page.
 2. In the Search links area on the left, click the Items by Bidder link.
 3. Enter the user ID of the bidder you want to check out.
 4. To check the bidder’s previous auction wins, click to add a check 
mark in the Completed Listings Only box (see Figure 6-6).

 By studying the bidding history, you can see how high the bidder is will-
ing to bid on certain items. This is invaluable information if you want to 
get a drift of how high you have to bid to win the next auction.
 5. Tell eBay whether you also want to see the person’s bid even if he or 
she is not the high bidder.
 
 Selecting the Even If Not the High Bidder option means that you want to 
see the bidder’s activity in every auction, even if the person is not the 
current high bidder. I think you should check all the bidder’s auctions 
to see how aggressively he or she bids on items. You can also see how 
badly a bidder wants specific items.
 
 If the bidder was bidding on an item in the past that you’re both inter-
ested in now, you can get a fairly good idea of how high that person is 
willing to go for the item this time. Figure 6-7 shows you how this looks.
 6. Choose the number of items you want to see per page.
 7. Click the Search button.

My Favorite Bidding Strategies
 
You may find that relying on the bidder search can give you a false sense of 
knowledge and confidence. Others may use the bidder search to become 
familiar with your habits, too. And many savvy buyers have two eBay user 
IDs and alternate between them to confuse those who try to follow their bid-
ding patterns. Sniping can also help because no one will know you’re inter-
ested in the auction until you win the item. Mix your bidding patterns up a 
bit to keep the competition wondering!
 
I keep links in my browser to bidder searches from some of my favorite bid-
ders. When I’m in the mood to shop, I just look at what they’re bidding on.
My Favorite Bidding Strategies
There used to be a time when I would tell beginning eBay members my favor-
ite methods of bidding and winning, and if there was an eBay employee in 
earshot, you could see him or her wince. Things are considerably different 
these days. For example, eBay used to officially oppose the use of third-
party payment options — until they purchased PayPal. And when sniping 
swept the online auction community and became de riguer, the eBay Powers 
That Be didn’t endorse the practice. Finally, after some agonizing, the eBay 
insiders admitted that sniping does work in winning auctions.
As a matter of fact, eBay’s instructors are now pitching many of the strate-
gies that I’ve been talking about for years — because they work! While edit-
ing this book, my editor even reminisced about just how much the eBay 
“party line” has changed since I wrote my first book on eBay in 1999.
Hunting for errors
Some of my best buys on eBay were the result of searching for misspellings. 
Many sellers are in a hurry when they set up their auction listings, and to err 
is human (and to win, divine). I am more than willing to forgive sellers for 
their mistakes because the payoff for bargain hunters is, well, a bargain.
Think of alternate spellings when you search for an item. A favorite of mine 
is Von Furstenburg for Von Furstenberg. Usually, I search for the correct spell-
ing and find a bunch of items where the bidding can get steep. But when I 
search for the misspelled version, I may find identical items that have no 
bids, because I’m the only one who has found the listing.
You can search for both the correct and incorrect spellings by using a search 
such as (furstenberg,furstenburg). Book II gives you lots more search tricks.

My Favorite Bidding Strategies
I was also successful during the holiday season of 2002, when those com-
puter animated cats were popular (and going for extremely high prices on 
eBay, because they were sold out everywhere across the country). The 
brand name was FurReal. I searched for spellings like fur real and furreal and 
found many bargains.
eBay smartened up and now sometimes shows alternative spellings — but 
not always (what is the right way to spell L’Occitane?).
A couple of our favorite misspellings are neckless (instead of necklace) — 
currently 117 items up for sale and vidio (instead of video) — currently 14 
on the site. I accidentally ran a search for a popular electronics game and 
noticed (as shown in Figure 6-8) that there were 2 items with the error. Note 
that eBay suggested the proper spelling of Nintendo, with 2,691 items.
 
Figure 6-8: 
Look! A

Use asterisks as wildcards in your search, especially if you’re not sure of the 
spelling of a word. You can also find some nuggets when searching for the 
plural of an item. (Check out Book II, Chapter 1.)
Researching your item
Sometimes we (that’s me and you) find what we think is an incredible deal 
on eBay. It may well be, especially if we know that the retail price is, say, $80 
and we’re seeing a Buy It Now or an auction closing at $40. If a low, low price 
works for you, just go ahead and buy the item if you want it right away. To 
find the best price for any item on eBay, do your homework to find out what 
similar items on eBay tend to sell for.
When you conduct your eBay research, the best strategy is to look at the 
prices achieved in previous sales. Do a search for completed auctions. Then 
check an auction’s bid history by clicking the Bid History link on the auction 
item page (the link appears next to the number of bids). You’ll be presented 
with the screen like the one in Figure 6-9. This will at least give you an idea of 
how many people are duking it out for the item, if not their actual IDs.

My Favorite Bidding Strategies
 
Figure 6-9: 
I don’t know 
who they 
are, but 
their bids 
sure seem 
persistent.
 
Pay attention to the times when bidders are placing their bids, and you may 
find that the people bidding in the auction are creatures of habit — making 
their bids about once a day and at a particular time of day. They may be log-
ging on before work, during lunch, or after work. Whatever their schedules, 
you have great info at your disposal in the event that a bidding war breaks 
out: Just bid after your competition traditionally logs out, and you increase 
your odds of winning the auction.
Early in an auction, there may not be much of a bidding history for an item, 
but that doesn’t mean you can’t still check out the dates and times a bidder 
places bids. You can also tell whether a bidder practices sniping (discussed 
later in this chapter) if his or her bid is in the last few seconds of the auc-
tion. You may have a fight on your hands if the bidder uses sniping.
Multiple-item (Dutch) auction strategy
Multiple-item (Dutch) auctions are funky. (Yes, funky is a technical term.) 
Each winner pays the same amount for the item, and multiple-item auctions 
don’t have a supersecret reserve price. But winning a multiple-item auction 
isn’t all that different from winning other auctions. Therefore, wait until the 
closing minutes of the auction to bid and then follow my sage advice for 
optimum success.

Quick Bidding Tips
Here are the key things to remember about a multiple-item auction:
 ✦ The seller must sell all the items at the lowest winning price at the 
end of the auction, no matter what.
 ✦ Winners are based on the highest bids received. If you up the ante, 
you could win the auction and pay only the lowest winning price, which 
may be lower than your bid. Confused yet? Say the minimum bid for 
each of ten Elvis watches is $10 and 20 people bid at $10, each person 
bidding for one watch. The first ten bidders win the watch. But suppose 
you come along at the end of the auction and bid $15 as the 21st bidder. 
You get a watch (as do the first nine people who bid $10), and you get 
the watch for the lowest successful bid — which is $10! Get it?
 ✦ Know where you stand in the pecking order. You can see a list of high 
bidders (and their bids) by clicking the Bidders List link on the auction 
page, so you always know where you stand in the pecking order.
 ✦ Avoid being the lowest or the highest high bidder. The highest bidder 
is sure to win, so the usual bidding strategy is to knock out the lowest 
high bidder. The lowest high bidder is said to be on the bubble — on the 
verge of losing the auction by a couple of pennies. To avoid being the 
bidder on the bubble, keep your bid just above the second-lowest 
winning bid.
 
 
✦ If you want to buy more than one of an item up for auction, make sure 
you have that number of successful high bids as the auction draws to a 
close. Huh? Remember, winners are based on the highest bids. If you’re in a 
multiple-item auction for ten items and place five $15 bids, nothing guaran-
tees that you’ll win five of the item. Nine other people who want the item 
could bid $20 apiece. Then they each win one of the items at $15, and you 
end up with only one of the item. (At least you still pay only $15 for it.)
Quick Bidding Tips
When you get a tip, double-check who it’s coming from. Visit eBay’s com-
munity boards and chats, and listen to what the others have to say. Before 
taking anything to heart and changing the way you do things, check the tip-
givers’ experiences. Are they really experienced on eBay? Or are they just 
touting the current company line or passing on the latest misinformation? I 
love buying from eBay sellers who are also buyers, because they respect and 
understand what it’s like to be a buyer on eBay!
Here are a few short tips that I know really work:
 ✦ Shop eBay.ca, eh! That’s right. If you’re in the U.S., why not bid on auc-
tions on the eBay Canada Web site? In fact, if you’re an international 
bidder and are willing to pay shipping from the U.S., you’ll have no prob-
lem handling Canadian shipping charges.

Quick Bidding Tips
 
 If you’re an American resident, all you have to do is think about the con-
version between the U.S. and Canadian dollars — oh yes, there are bar-
gains to be had. From the eBay home page, scroll down the left side of the 
page and click the Canada link. Or you can visit www.eBay.ca. Be sure the 
seller has reasonable shipping to the United States before you bid.
 ✦ Place your bids in odd figures. Many eBay bidders place their bids in 
the round numbers that match eBay’s proxy system. You can win by a 
few cents if you place your bids in odd numbers like $10.97 or $103.01.
 ✦ Don’t get carried away in a bidding war. Unless the item is rare, odds 
are that a similar item will show up on eBay again someday soon. Don’t 
let your ego get in the way of smart bidding. Let your opposition pay 
too much!
 ✦ Don’t freak out if you find yourself in a bidding war. Don’t keel over 
if, at the split-second you’re convinced that you’re the high bidder with 
your $45.02, someone beats you out at $45.50.
 ✦ Watch for item relistings. If you see an item that you want but it has too 
high an opening bid (or too high a reserve), there’s a good chance that 
no one else will bid on the item, either. Put that auction into your Watch 
area of My eBay. Then, after the auction ends, double-check the seller’s 
auctions every so often to see whether the item has been relisted with a 
lower starting bid and a lower (or no) reserve.
 ✦ Combine shipping when possible. When you purchase an item, check 
the seller’s other auctions and see whether you’re interested in making 
a second purchase. If you see something else that appeals to you, e-mail 
the seller to see whether he or she will combine the items in shipping. 
That way, you can make two purchases for a smaller single shipping bill.
 ✦ Never bid early, but if you do, bid high. The only time this bidding 
early business works is if no one else is interested in the auction. 
Usually, though, the tactic will gear up another eBay user to outbid you 
because suddenly the item is valuable to at least one person. If you must 
bid before the auction’s close, bid high. As a matter of fact, bid a couple 
of dollars more than you might want to pay. (I mean literally a couple, 
not a couple hundred.)
 ✦ Try for a Second Chance offer: If you get outbid and miss the chance to 
increase your bid on an auction item, you’d be smart to e-mail the seller 
and ask whether he or she has any more of the item. You may get lucky, 
and the seller can send you a Second Chance offer for your high bid.
 
 A seller may send a Second Chance offer to underbidders in their auc-
tion under three circumstances: when the winner doesn’t go through 
with the winning bid, when the reserve price wasn’t met, or when the 
seller has more than one of the items that were sold. Any purchase you 
make in this manner will be covered under PayPal’s Buyer Protection 
Program, and you will have the opportunity to leave feedback.

Succeeding by Sniping
Succeeding by Sniping
Sniping is the fine art of outbidding your competition in the very last seconds 
of the auction — without leaving them enough time to place a defensive bid. 
Sniping is my number one favorite way to win an auction on eBay. When I 
first touted this method in 1999, it was a fairly new idea. Now everyone knows 
about sniping, and it’s pretty much an accepted bidding method.
 
Bidders (that is, losing bidders) whine and moan when they lose to a sniper, 
but they should remember one thing: The high bidder always wins, whether 
you’re sniping or using the automatic bid system. If you’re going to snipe, 
assume that the current bidder has a very high-dollar proxy bid in the works.
Some eBay members consider the practice of sniping unseemly and 
uncivilized — like when dozens of parents used to mob the department-
store clerks to get to the handful of Cabbage Patch dolls that were just 
delivered. (Come to think of it, whatever happened to those collectibles?) 
Of course, sometimes a little uncivilized behavior can be a hoot.
 
Sniping is an addictive, fun part of life on eBay. I recommend that you try it. 
You’re likely to benefit from the results and enjoy your eBay experience 
even more — especially if you’re an adrenaline junkie.
Sniping techniques for the beginner
Here’s a list of things to keep in mind when you get ready to place your 
snipe bid:
 ✦ Know how high you’re willing to go. If you know you’re facing a lot of 
competition, figure out your highest bid to the penny. You should have 
already researched the item and figured out its value. Raise your bid 
only to the level where you’re sure you’re getting a good return on your 
investment; don’t go overboard. Certainly, if the item has some emo-
tional value and you just have to have it, bid as high as you want. But 
remember, you’ll have to pay the piper later. You win it, you own it!
 ✦ Know how fast (or slow) your Internet connection is. Before you start 
sniping, figure out how long it takes to get your bid confirmed on eBay. 
Test it a few times until you know how many seconds you have to spare 
when placing a bid.
 ✦ Don’t lose heart if you lose the auction. Remember, this is a game.
 
Although sellers love sniping because it drives up prices and bidders love it 
because it’s fun, a sniper can ruin a week’s careful work on an auction strat-
egy. The most skillful snipers sneak in a bid so close to the end of the auc-
tion that you have no chance to counter-bid. Losing too often, especially to 
the same sniper, can be a drag.

Book I
Chapter 6
Bidding to Win
121
Succeeding by Sniping
 
If your Internet connection is slow and you want to do some sniping, make 
your final bid two minutes before the auction ends and adjust the amount of 
the bid as high as you feel comfortable so you can beat out the competition. 
If you can make the highest bid with just 10 seconds left, you most likely will 
win. With so many bids coming in the final seconds, your bid might be the 
last one eBay records.
This stuff is supposed to be fun, so don’t lose perspective. If you can’t afford 
an item, don’t get caught up in a bidding war. Otherwise, the only person who 
wins is the seller. If you’re losing sleep, barking at your cat, or biting your nails 
over an item, it’s time to rethink what you’re doing. If it’s taking up too much 
of your life or an item costs too much, be willing to walk away — or log off — 
and live to bid another day.
To snipe a bid manually (without a sniping service), first make sure you’re 
signed in. Then follow these steps to snipe at the end of the auction:
 1. In the last few minutes of the auction, locate the item you want to win 
and press Ctrl+N to open a second window on your Internet browser.
 
 Keep one window open for bidding, as shown in Figure 6-10.
 
Figure 6-10: 
My manual 
sniping 
system in 
action.
 
 2. Continuously click the reload or refresh button that appears in the 
last few minutes of an auction, just above the Place Bid button.
 
 By reloading the item continually, you’ll be aware when you’re in the last 
60 seconds of bidding. You also can see instantly whether anyone else is 
doing any last-minute bidding.

122
Succeeding by Sniping
 3. In the bid box of the second browser, type your maximum bid and 
then click the Place Bid button.
 
 You then face a page that, when you press the button, finalizes and con-
firms your bid on the item. Do not click the Commit to Buy button yet.
 4. As the auction nears its end, confirm your final bid by clicking the 
Commit to Buy button.
 
 You know when the auction is almost over because you’re reloading 
your first browser continually. The longer you can hold off bidding 
before the auction ends, the better.
If you really want an item bad enough, you may want to set up a backup for 
your snipe. Try my three-screen system, in which you can place a backup 
high bid in case you catch another sniper swooping in on your item immedi-
ately after your first snipe.
Obviously, if you win with the first snipe, the second window is unnecessary. 
But if you lose the first one, that second window feels like a real lifesaver! 
If you’re outbid after two snipes, don’t cry. The winner paid way more than 
you were willing to pay. It’s not much consolation, but rarely is an item so 
rare that you only see it come on the auction block once in a lifetime.
Auto-sniping your auctions
My daughter says that I can make almost anything high maintenance, and 
she may very well be right. When it comes to eBay bidding and winning, a 
bunch of software programs and Web sites can help automate your shop-
ping and feedback process. I like that they will bid for me whether I’m near a 
computer or sleeping peacefully.
Here is one that I have used successfully: BidRobot. Shown in Figure 6-11, 
BidRobot deftly places sniping bids for you from its servers. It’s won many 
an auction for me while I’ve been on the road or busy writing. The service 
is one of the least expensive out there, charging a low flat rate. Get a three-
week free trial (all you can snipe for three weeks!) at
www.bidrobot.com/cool
They also have a BidGroup feature to use if you’re bound and determined to 
get the lowest price for an item. This is accomplished by planning a bidding 
schedule at a set price. The bidding continues until you win your item (or 
not). Here’s how it works.
  1. Search for your item. Search for your specific item on eBay. You may 
find a large number of eBay auctions that offer your item.
  2. Select the auctions you’d like to bid on. Review the listings (checking 
the seller’s feedback, description and PayPal Buyer Protection availabil-
ity) and select six different listings.

Figure 6-11:

Web site.
 
 3. Create your first snipe. Type your first snipe bid in the pale yellow Bid 
section at the very top of the BidRobot bid screen Click also to indicate 
that you want to create a group of bids with the other five auctions.
 4. Group the other auctions. To bid on other seller’s auctions, scroll down 
until you find the Pending Bid Group that contains your first item bid. 
Then use the form in that BidGroup area to add more snipe bids for 
other auctions in that specific BidGroup You may add bids for as many 
additional auctions to this group as you like 
 5. Winning. If you win any one of the auctions in your BidGroup, the 
remaining bids in that specific group will not be placed. This is automatic.
Before you place a bid, be sure that you know 
the item’s street price, which is the price that 
people actually pay — not the MSRP (manufac-
turer’s suggested retail price). You can use the 
Internet to check prices for many items. In fact, 
several consumer Web sites are dedicated 
to serving savvy consumers by offering this 
information. You can find prices for computer 
items at www.pricewatch.com. Prices 
for almost everything else can be found at 
this Google site: www.google.com/
products. You may be comfortable paying 
slightly more than the street price because eBay 
is so easy to use — after all, the item is delivered 
to your door and you don’t have to go to a bricks-
and-mortar store to shop for the item.

Retracting Your Bid in an Emergency
Retracting Your Bid in an Emergency
We’re all human and we all make mistakes. Luckily for everyone, eBay 
members are allowed to retract bids under certain circumstances. You may 
retract your bid if you meet one of the following criteria:
 ✦ You accidentally typed the wrong bid amount: Say you typed $900 but 
you meant $9.00. Oops. In a case like this, you can retract the bid, but 
you’d better rebid the proper amount (that original $9.00) immediately, 
or you may be in violation of eBay’s policies.
 ✦ The seller has added information to the item description that changes 
the value of the item considerably: The bull that was let loose in the 
seller’s shop has changed the mint condition of the Ming vase you just 
bid on? No problem.
 ✦ You can’t reach the seller through eBay’s e-mail or through the tele-
phone number you got from eBay’s find members area: Seller gone 
AWOL and you have a question about an item you’ve bid on? You can 
use eBay’s e-mail system by clicking Ask the Seller a Question in the 
Seller Information box on the auction page. Or to get the seller’s tele-
phone number, click the Advanced Search link (at the top-right corner of 
most eBay pages) and then click the Find a Member link (on the left side 
of the page). Next, input your transaction number and the seller’s user 
ID. After checking to make sure that you’ve begun a transaction with this 
person, the good people at eBay will send the seller’s telephone number 
in an e-mail message to your registered e-mail address. Your phone 
number will also be e-mailed to the seller.
 
Every time you retract a bid, it appears in the feedback area or your eBay 
feedback page.
Here are a couple of additional restrictions to retracting bids:
 ✦ You can retract a bid only if it was placed during the last 12 hours of 
an auction. If you bid more than once in the last 12 hours of the same 
auction, you can retract it within one hour of placing it. In this case, only 
that bid will be retracted; any other bid placed before the last 12 hours 
of the listing remains valid.
 ✦ When you retract a bid because of a bidding error, you wipe out any 
of your previous bids in the auction. To reinstate yourself as a bidder, 
you must bid again immediately.

Book I
Chapter 6
Bidding to Win
125
Retracting Your Bid in an Emergency
If you want to retract your bid within the last 12 hours of the auction and 
you placed the bid before the last 12 hours, you must send an e-mail to the 
seller asking him or her to cancel your bid. It is up to the seller whether to 
cancel your bid. A bid retraction isn’t a guarantee that you will get out of 
purchasing the item. Sometimes, sellers simply don’t have the opportunity 
or time to cancel a bid. That means you have to buy the item.
You’ll probably never need this link, but to retract your bid (or find more 
information), go to
http://offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RetractBidShow
You can find your way to the Bid Retraction form also by clicking the Buying 
Related links on your My eBay All Buying page.
 
eBay vigorously investigates members who abuse bid retractions. Too many 
bid retractions and you may find yourself suspended from the system.

T
he thrill of the chase is over, and you’ve won your eBay item. 
Congratulations — now what do you do? You have to follow up on 
your victory and keep a sharp eye on what you’re doing. The post-auction 
process can be loaded with pitfalls and headaches if you don’t follow 
proper procedure. Money, like a full moon, does strange things to people 
sometimes.
In this chapter, you get a handle on what’s in store for you after you win an 
auction. I clue you in on what the seller is supposed to do to make the trans-
action go smoothly and show you how to grab hold of your responsibilities 
as a buyer. You find out about proper post-auction etiquette, including the 
best ways to get organized, communicate with the seller professionally, and 
send your payment without hazards. I also brief you on how to handle an 
imperfect transaction.
 
Throughout the bidding process, the dollar amounts of items you’re winning 
appear in green on your My eBay: All Buying page. If you’ve been outbid, 
they appear in red.
After the auction ends, there’s no marching band, no visit from a camera 
crew, no armful of roses, and no oversized check to duck behind. In fact, 
you’re more likely to find out that you’ve won the auction from the seller 
or the All Buying: Won section of your My eBay page than you are to hear 
it from eBay. eBay tries to get its end-of-auction e-mails (EOAs) out pronto, 
but sometimes there’s a lag. After you win, you can go back to the item and 
see a checkout link on the item page. For a look at all the contact informa-
tion in the end-of-auction e-mail, see Figure 7-1.

If you can receive text messages on your cell phone, eBay will send EOA 
notices to your phone. Find out your wireless e-mail address from your cell-
phone provider — it’s usually available from the provider’s home page (for 
example, www.sprint.com or www.t-mobile.com). Then go to your My 
eBay page, find the My Account: Personal Information area, and click the 
Change link. After you’ve entered your contact information there, click the 
Change My Notification Preferences link and select which notifications you 
want sent to your mobile phone. That way, no matter where you are, you’ll 
know when you have won an auction (and need to get payment out ASAP)!
Checking Out
When you buy something in a store, you need to check out to pay. eBay 
isn’t much different. eBay’s checkout is a convenient way to pay for your 
completed auction or Buy it Now sale with a credit card or eCheck through 
PayPal. You may also use checkout to exchange information with the seller 
and pay for your item using a money order, a check, or another payment ser-
vice that the seller accepts.
Checkout is integrated directly onto the item page so that you can win and 
pay for an item in less than a minute, as shown in Figure 7-2.

When you click the Pay Now button, you are taken to the checkout page. 
You can make an immediate payment only if the seller accepts PayPal. If 
the seller accepts other types of payment, such as a personal check or a 
money order, you can indicate which type of payment you want to use and 
this page will send the seller your shipping information. If the shipping cost 
is based on your ZIP code, or the seller offers discounts on buying multiple 
items, you can make any such changes on the page and recalculate the total. 
Then you can go ahead and send the payment.
When I talk to people about why they don’t buy on eBay, the most frequent 
answer is that they’re afraid of giving out their credit-card information. The 
second most common reason is that they don’t want to send money to strang-
ers. In addition to all the eBay safeguards that I mention in previous chapters, 
the next section gives you the inside scoop on how to stay safe when sending 
your payment to the sellers. You may be surprised to know that there are dis-
tinct levels of safety in how you can send a payment to a seller.
Using Your Credit Card Safely
The safest way to shop on eBay is to use a credit card. In most cases, your 
credit-card company will stand behind you if you encounter problems using 
your card online.
Knowing your credit-card company’s policy
Before you start bidding, find out how your credit-card company handles 
fraud claims. The major credit-card companies — American Express, 
Discover, MasterCard, and Visa — have different policies regarding how 
they stand behind your online purchases:

130
Using Your Credit Card Safely
 
✦ American Express: American Express offers “ironclad protection” for 
online shoppers. The company claims that there’s “no fine print and no 
deductible” if you need to rely on American Express to help you fight a 
fraudulent transaction.
www.americanexpress.com/cards/online_guarantee
 
✦ Discover: Discover offers 100% fraud protection. The company offers 
a secure online account number, which generates a single-use card 
number each time you shop online so your account number is never 
transferred over the Internet.
www.discovercard.com/customer-service/security/
create-soan.html
 
✦ MasterCard: The program offered by MasterCard is called Zero Liability 
and is offered if MasterCard deems your account in good standing, you 
haven’t broadcast personal account information online frivolously, and 
you haven’t reported more than two “unauthorized events” in the past 
12 months.
 
 It appears that MasterCard’s policy is conditional and that they ( not you) 
are the final judge when it comes to determining fraud, so be careful.
http://www.mastercard.com/us/personal/en/
cardholderservices/zeroliability.html
 
✦ Visa: Visa seems to like the phrase zero liability, as well. Your liability 
for unauthorized transactions is $0. A new program, called Verified by 
Visa, lets you set up your own private password that you use with your 
Visa card anytime you use it online at participating merchants.
http://usa.visa.com/personal/security/visa_security_
program/zero_liability.html
 
Every once in a while, check your statement, visit your credit card compa-
ny’s Web site, or call the credit-card company’s customer-service depart-
ment to verify its current fraud-protection policy for online purchases.
 
Never — really, I mean never ever — send your credit-card information to 
anyone through e-mail. E-mail is the most insecure way to send information. 
As your e-mail makes its way from your computer to the recipient’s desktop, 
it makes a whole lot of micro-stops along the way. These stops may take just 
nanoseconds, but your information is open for reading by outside parties (at 
least those who have the right expertise) at any stop along the journey.
Adding a layer of protection with 
an online checkout service
Many eBay sellers use an independent online checkout service that allows 
them to process shipping information, combine purchases, give an exact 
shipping total, and receive credit card payments. If the seller uses such a 
service, you probably see a clickable link in the e-mail that’s sent to you at 
the end of the auction. The link leads you to an online checkout page.

Paying with PayPal
When you come to the point in the checkout process where you must input 
your credit-card information (see Figure 7-3), look for the following:
 
✦ Find the small closed padlock icon or the key icon: These icons tell 
you that the site hosting the checkout is secure. You can find these 
icons in the lower-right corner of your browser window.
 
✦ Check the URL for an s: The URL (Web-site address) may change from a 
prefix of http:// to https:// (the s stands for secure).
 
✦ Look for SSL: You may also see the initials SSL in the Web site’s 
address or somewhere on the page. SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer.
 
 Any, some, or all of the preceding items indicate that the Web site uses 
security encryption methods. Translation? No one but you and the mer-
chant can read or view your payment information.

Paying with PayPal
PayPal is my preferred method of payment on eBay. I’ve been happily using 
PayPal since the company was introduced to eBay, and I’ve always had posi-
tive results. Well, okay, not always. No service can make a slow or lazy seller 
into the picture of efficiency. The advantage of PayPal, though, is that you 
don’t have to get your hands dirty.
For example, I once had a problem with a slow-shipping seller. Luckily, I had 
paid him using PayPal. I filed a complaint through PayPal and I got my mer-
chandise shipped out within a day!
The folks at eBay know a good thing when they see it, so they acquired PayPal 
late in 2002. Now PayPal payments are integrated into eBay’s checkout process.

132
Paying with PayPal
Registering at PayPal
When you register to use PayPal, you have to give your name, address, 
phone number, and e-mail address. You also have to make up a password.
 
Make your password more than six characters, and use numbers and 
letters — revisit Chapter 3 for more information on registration security.
You have to select a security question. The safest is your pet’s name, your 
city of birth, or the last four digits of your Social Security Number. You have 
to click to put a check mark next to the paragraph that says you have read 
and agree to PayPal’s User Agreement and Privacy policy. (There are links 
so you can read them.) When you’re convinced that you understand what 
PayPal’s all about and what it expects of you, click Sign Up.
PayPal sends you an e-mail confirming your registration. The e-mail arrives 
almost instantaneously to the e-mail address you used at registration, and 
the message contains a link. When you receive the e-mail, click the link 
to visit the PayPal site. Enter the password that was used to create your 
account. Bingo — you’re in.
Giving PayPal credit card or checking 
account information
Of course, you also have to add a credit card number to your PayPal account if 
you want to pay for anything with a credit card (or plan to sell on eBay). If you 
don’t have a credit card — or would like to occasionally pay for things directly 
from your bank account — you have to register your checking account.
To be a good consumer, you need to take 
responsibility for your transactions. Be sure 
you understand your credit-card terms and 
conditions when it comes to third-party pay-
ment services. Each credit-card company 
has its own agreement with PayPal — and 
each company has a different view of how 
to handle PayPal transactions. For example, 
Visa and MasterCard treat PayPal as the mer-
chant of record in your transactions, mean-
ing that PayPal ends up as the responsible 
party if you don’t receive the merchandise or 
if you dispute the transaction. If you register a 
complaint about a charge made on your Visa 
or MasterCard, the credit-card company just 
yanks the money from PayPal, and it’s up to 
PayPal to settle things with the seller.
At the time of this writing, Discover and 
American Express treat PayPal transactions 
somewhat like a cash advance — a money 
transfer of sorts. I just checked a couple of my 
past Discover and American Express bills, and 
the PayPal charges look like any other charges. 
The only difference is how these credit-card 
companies handle their level of liability in 
third-party payment services. PayPal backs 
your purchases for $200 to $2000 – depending 
on the seller’s experience.

I can see you beginning to squirm; you’re not comfortable giving that type of 
information to anyone, much less putting it out on the Internet. Relax. PayPal 
uses military-strength encryption technology to keep your account informa-
tion safe, so don’t be afraid to give up your data.
To register your credit card, you’ll have to input the name on the card (the 
last name is already filled in with the name you registered on the account), 
the expiration date, and the card-verification number — the three-digit 
number on the back of the card, imprinted next to the last few digits of the 
card number in the area where you sign. (American Express verification 
numbers are on the front of the card.) PayPal also asks you to supply a bill-
ing address.
 
On an American Express card, the card-verification number is the four-digit 
number on the right side of the face of the card.
When you enter all the information PayPal needs, click the Add button. 
PayPal submits your information to your credit card company for confirma-
tion. This process may take a minute or so, but eventually your credit-card 
company says you are who you say you are, and the card is added to your 
PayPal account. You can register four active credit cards.
Registering your checking account is just as easy. You supply the informa-
tion from the bottom of one of your checks, as shown in Figure 7-4.

Getting PayPal-verified
When PayPal has the information it needs, it makes two small deposits into 
that account. (When I say small, I mean small!) After a week or so, call your 
bank or check your account online and find out the amount of these two 
deposits. When you have the amounts, sign on to the PayPal Web site with 
your password, and type the amounts in the appropriate place. Voilà! Your 
account is registered — and, not coincidentally, you’re verified! PayPal has 
confirmed that you hold an active account with your bank. All banks are 

134
Paying with PayPal
required to screen their account holders, and verification authenticates your 
identity to anyone who does business with you.
Here are some benefits of being PayPal-verified:
 
✦ No spending limit (Whoopie!).
 
✦ Higher level of account security. 
 
✦ Better buyer and seller confidence. Verified status shows other PayPal 
members that you have passed PayPal’s security checks. 
 
If you don’t want to give up your bank-account number, you can become ver-
ified by applying for and being accepted for a PayPal Plus credit card or 
PayPal Buyer Credit.
Ways to pay through PayPal
The easiest and most efficient way to pay for eBay purchases is by credit 
card. If you are not a PayPal-verified buyer, you still have your credit card’s 
fraud-protection guarantee behind you.
eBay sees to it that PayPal is incredibly easy to use because PayPal is the 
official payment service at eBay. After the auction is over, a link to pay 
appears. If you prefer, wait until you hear from the seller. 
You may also send money directly from your bank account (either savings 
or checking) through instant transfer or eCheck.
 
✦ Instant transfer: An instant transfer is immediately debited from your 
bank account and deposited into the seller’s account — so you’d best 
be sure you have the funds in your account to back up the purchase 
now (not tomorrow, not next week). PayPal requires you to back up an 
instant transfer with a credit card, just in case you’ve miscalculated 
your account balance.
 
✦ eCheck: You may also write an eCheck, which is just like writing a 
check, only you don’t write it with a pen. Like regular, plain-vanilla paper 
checks, eChecks take three to four days to clear, and do not post to the 
seller’s account as paid until then. The seller won’t ship your item until 
PayPal tells the seller that the check has cleared your bank.
 
✦ Credit card: You can use your American Express, Discover, Visa, or 
MasterCard to make your payment through PayPal. The cost of the item 
is charged to your card, and your statement reflects a PayPal payment 
with the seller’s ID.
 
Sellers will not ship your item until the eCheck clears, so if you’re in a hurry, 
don’t use this option.

Making a PayPal payment
After you win an auction, buy an item in a Buy It Now transaction, or pur-
chase an item from an eBay store, it’s time to pay. You can pay immediately 
by clicking the Pay Now icon on the item page.
On the next screen, as shown in Figure 7-5, you see an invoice type page. 
Double-check that all the information is correct. If insurance is optional, and 
you don’t want shipping insurance, just delete the amount. If you’re entitled 
to a multiple-item discount, you can put that in too. If you are unclear about 
how much to pay, there’s a link you can use to ask the seller for a total.
 
Figure 7-5: 
Reviewing 
your

before 
making your

Assuming that you’ve already become a registered (verified) PayPal user, 
you see a place at the very bottom of the page to input your e-mail address 
and password. Fill in this info, and click the button that says Continue.
A page appears and you must decide whether you want to pay by credit card 
or bank transfer. If you have a balance in your PayPal account, you must use 
that money to make your payment; so withdraw your PayPal balance first if 
you want to pay with a credit card. Finalize all the details of your transaction 
by filling in any open blanks and indicating your payment choice. You can 
even send a note to the seller along with your payment.
If you want some information to go to the seller regarding your transaction, 
send the information in a separate e-mail message. The Note to seller is buried 
in a much longer e-mail message that PayPal sends to the seller, and it’s hard 
to find. (PayPal sends sellers an e-mail within a few hours saying that it has 
received your payment.) So any important messages should be sent sepa-
rately. Put your transaction number or item name in the Subject line.

Sending Payment Promptly and Securely
Sending Payment Promptly and Securely
How many times have you heard the saying “The check is in the mail”? Yeah, 
I’ve heard it about a thousand times, too. If you’re on the selling end of a 
transaction, hearing this line from the buyer but not getting the money is 
frustrating. If you’re on the buying end, it’s bad form and may also lead to 
bad feedback for you.
Being the good buyer that you are, you’ll get your payment out 
pronto. If you’ve purchased an item and intend to pay using PayPal, do 
it immediately — why wait? (The sooner you pay, the sooner you get that 
charming gold-trimmed Flying Monkey decanter you won!)
On October 20th, 2008 eBay changed their policies and checks or money 
orders will no longer be allowed on eBay
 
Most sellers expect to get paid within seven business days after the close of 
the auction. Although this timeline isn’t mandatory, it makes good sense to 
let the seller know that payment is on the way.
 
Send your payment promptly. If you have to delay payment for any reason 
(you have to go out of town, you broke your leg), let the seller know as soon 
as possible. Most sellers understand if you send them a kind and honest 
e-mail. Let the seller know what’s up; give him or her a date by which the 
money can be expected, and then meet that deadline. If the wait is unreason-
ably long, the seller may cancel the transaction. In that case, you can expect 
to get some bad feedback.
Here are some tips on how to make sure that your payment reaches the 
seller promptly and safely:
 
✦ If you’re paying with a credit card without using a payment service and 
want to provide the number over the telephone, be sure to request the 
seller’s phone number in your reply to the seller’s initial e-mail and 
explain why you want it.
 
✦ You can safely e-mail your credit card information over the course of 
several e-mails, each containing four numbers from your credit card. 
Stagger your e-mails so that they’re about 20 minutes apart and don’t 
forget to let the seller know what kind of credit card you’re using. Also, 
give the card’s expiration date.
 
Buyers routinely send out payments with no name, no address, and no clue 
as to what they’ve purchased. No matter how you pay, be sure to include a 
copy of the eBay confirmation letter, a printout of the auction page, or a 
copy of the e-mail the seller sent you. If you pay with a credit card through 
e-mail or over the phone, you should still send this info through the mail just 
to be on the safe side.

Contacting the Seller
Contacting the Seller
eBay rules and regulations state that buyers and sellers must contact each 
other by e-mail within three business days of the auction’s end. For example, 
if an item closes on a Saturday, you need to make contact by Wednesday.
Most sellers contact auction winners promptly because they want to com-
plete the transaction and get paid. Few buyers or sellers wait for the official 
eBay EOA e-mail to contact each other. If you’ve won an item and intend to 
pay through PayPal, it’s de rigueur for you to use the Pay Now link on the 
item page as soon as possible after you’ve won.
If you need to contact the seller before sending payment, you have several 
ways to find contact information:
 
✦ Click the Ask Seller a Question link on the auction page, which takes 
you to the Ask Seller a Question form.
 
✦ Click the Site Map link, located above the navigation bar on every eBay 
page, and then click the Find a Member link. On the resulting page, click 
the link to find Contact Information.
 
✦ Click the Advanced Search link (at the top-right corner of all eBay 
pages), and then click the Find Contact Information link (on the left side 
of the page).
If you don’t hear from the seller after three busi-
ness days and you’ve already tried sending an 
e-mail, you need to get more contact informa-
tion. Remember back when you registered and 
eBay asked for a phone number? eBay keeps 
this information for times like this.
To get an eBay member’s phone number on a 
transaction you’re participating in, go back to 
the Advanced Search: Members: Find Contact 
Information link. Fill out the Contact Info form by 
entering the seller’s user ID and the number of 
the item that you’re buying, and then click the 
Search button. If all the information is correct, 
you automatically see a request-confirmation 
page and eBay generates an e-mail message 
to both you and the other user.
eBay’s e-mail message includes the seller’s 
user ID, name, company, city, state, and coun-
try of residence, as well as the seller’s phone 
number and date of initial registration. eBay 
sends this same information about you to the 
user you want to get in touch with. Most sellers 
jump to attention when they receive this e-mail 
from eBay and get the ball rolling to complete 
the transaction.

Leaving Responsible Feedback
Within the first three business days after an auction or a Buy it Now trans-
action, limit yourself to using the Ask Seller a Question form. The seller (if 
signed in) sees the buyer’s e-mail address on the item page after the sale is 
closed.
 
eBay doesn’t tolerate abuses of its contact system. Make sure that you use 
this resource to communicate with another user only about a specific trans-
action in which you are participating. To use contact information to com-
plete a deal outside eBay is an infringement of the rules. If you abuse the 
contact system, eBay can investigate you and kick you off the site.
Leaving Responsible Feedback
Almost any eBay seller will tell you that one of his or her pet peeves about 
the eBay feedback system is that new community members tend to leave 
neutral or (even worse) negative, feedback the moment a shipment arrives 
and something is wrong. In this section, I tell you what you need to know to 
avoid getting a bad rap for being too hard on sellers.
Chapter 5 gives you the long version of leaving feedback on eBay; please 
read it for detailed information on the new seller ratings. These DSRs 
(detailed star ratings) allow buyers to get more specific with their transac-
tion feedback.
 
The DSR part of the feedback system asks you to rate sellers by filling in one 
to five stars. Why be judgmental? If the transaction went through as prom-
ised, why not give the seller five stars? A 5-star rating doesn’t cost you any-
thing as the buyer, and if the seller is a PowerSeller, it can affect a discount 
they receive on their eBay fees.
Late Delivery
A late delivery is not always the seller’s fault. Before dinging a seller’s repu-
tation for slow delivery, check the postmark on the package’s label. You’ll 
often find that the seller followed through with his or her shipping promise, 
but the package was held up in transit. The shipping services may deserve 
a 1-star rating, but if the seller shipped right away, why not give that person 
five stars for a good-faith effort?
Missing or damaged shipment
When a package leaves the seller’s hands, it is literally (and completely) 
out of his or her hands. If UPS, Federal Express Ground, or Federal Express 
Air ships your package, the tracking number can track the item. Tracking 
offered by the U.S. Post Office can be casual (at best) and is often not 
scanned until the package is delivered to your door, thus negating the track-
ability (for lack of a better term) of the package. Here are a few things to 
remember:

Book I
Chapter 7
Completing the 
Transaction
139
Leaving Responsible Feedback
 
✦ Be sure you know when the seller plans to ship the merchandise, so 
there’s less question about when it will probably arrive. If this informa-
tion isn’t stated in the auction description, use the Ask Seller a Question 
link to find out — before you buy — determine whether the shipping 
schedule matches your needs.
 
✦ If you do not pay the seller extra money to purchase insurance before 
your item is shipped, it’s unfair to hold the seller responsible for dam-
aged or lost shipments. Period. End of story.
 
✦ Open your packages immediately upon receipt. A seller can’t make a 
claim on an item that you report damaged in shipping a month after it 
arrives, so leaving negative feedback for the seller at that point is unfair. 
Most shippers insist that any and all damage be reported within five 
days of receipt. Also, if damage has occurred, keep all packing materials 
for inspection by the carrier. If you fail to save these materials, the car-
rier may not accept your claim and you will have no further recourse.
 
✦ A seller can’t do much about a missing package. Sellers can’t even make 
a claim on a postal shipment until 30 days have passed since mailing.
 
✦ If the item never arrives, only the sender can file a claim with the ship-
ping company and must produce all shipping receipts. Notify the seller 
immediately by e-mail or telephone upon receiving a damaged shipment. 
Leaving negative feedback before contacting the seller is just plain 
unjust. 
Item doesn’t meet your expectations
If the item arrives and isn’t as described in the item description, e-mail the 
seller. Communication is a good thing — and most sellers want to preserve 
their reputations. Give the seller the opportunity to work things out with 
you. Keep in mind these facts:
 
✦ If a new item in a manufacturer’s sealed box arrives damaged, the 
damage could have happened at the manufacturer and the seller 
wouldn’t even know about it.
 
✦ A seller may not be as experienced in a particular collectible as you are. 
If you didn’t ask all the necessary questions before bidding, you may 
have received what the seller assumed was a collectible. It’s up to the 
buyer to ask questions before placing a bid.
 
✦ If you receive the wrong item, the seller might have simply mixed up 
labels. Don’t jump to leave negative feedback. Just notify the seller, who 
will no doubt work out the mistake with you.
Most important, sellers should be given the chance to prove they care. 
If you feel that you’re a victim of fraud, you can apply for PayPal’s Buyer 
Protection (see Chapter 5).

Leaving Responsible Feedback
Choosing your words carefully
Good sellers should be rewarded, and potential buyers should be informed. 
That’s why no eBay transaction is complete until the buyer fills out the feed-
back form. Before leaving any feedback, remember that sometimes no one’s 
at fault when transactions get fouled up. Here are some handy hints on what 
kind of feedback to leave for a seller:
 
✦ Give the seller the benefit of the doubt: Selling on eBay is a source of 
income, and most are honest, hard working people. If the transaction 
could have been a nightmare, but the seller tried to make it right and 
meet you halfway, that’s an easy call — leave positive feedback.
 
✦ Whenever possible, reward someone who seems honest or tried to 
correct a bad situation. For example, if the seller worked at a snail’s 
pace but you eventually got your item and you’re thrilled with it, you 
may want to leave positive feedback with a caveat. Something like “Item 
as described, good seller, but very slow to deliver” sends the right feed-
back message.
 
✦ If the seller worked at a snail’s pace but packaged the item adequately 
and the item was kinda-sorta what you expected, you may want to 
leave neutral feedback. That is, the experience wasn’t bad enough for 
negative feedback but didn’t deserve praise. Here’s an example: “Really 
slow to deliver, didn’t say item condition was good not excellent, but 
did deliver.” Wishy-washy is okay as a response to so-so performance; at 
least the next buyer will know to ask specific questions.
 
✦ If the seller doesn’t ship your item or the item doesn’t match the 
description and the seller won’t make things right, you need to leave 
negative feedback. But never write negative feedback in the heat of the 
moment — and never make it personal. Life’s interesting enough without 
taking on extra hassles.
Remember that you cannot retract feedback. You are responsible for your 
words, which will remain on the eBay site forever (with your user ID next to 
them for all to see). Be sure to leave a simple, factual, and unemotional state-
ment. Important things to mention in your feedback are
 
✦ How satisfied you are with your purchase
 
✦ The quality of the packaging
 
✦ The promptness of shipping
 
✦ The seller’s professionalism
 
✦ The level of communication
If you must leave a negative feedback comment, know that there is karma in 
this life. If you couldn’t resolve things without a problem, chances are the 
seller wasn’t happy with the trading experience either. Try to work things 
out first!

e
Bay is more than just an Internet location for buying and selling great 
stuff. Most of all, eBay is about people. Today, “social marketing” is the 
buzzword — and eBay wants the world to know that it has created (and 
works hard to maintain) a community. And prime real estate in this commu-
nity costs nothing! As in real-life communities, you participate as much as 
works for you. You can get involved in all sorts of neighborhood activities, 
or you can just sit back, mind your own business, and watch the world go by.
As you’ve probably heard by now, one of the main ways to participate in the 
eBay community is through feedback (which I explain in detail in Chapters 
5 and 7). In this chapter, I show you some other ways to become part of the 
community. You can socialize, get information from other members, leave 
messages, or just read what everybody’s talking about on eBay’s message 
boards, chat boards, and corporate announcement board. I include tips on 
how to use all these places to your benefit. The tools in this chapter help 
you solidify your place in the community that is eBay.
Your Home on eBay: About Me
Want to know more about the people behind those user IDs? Thousands of 
eBay members have created personal Web pages on eBay called About Me 
pages. eBay users with active About Me pages have a Me icon (with a blue 
lowercase m and a red lowercase e) next to their user IDs.
If you’re on eBay, you need an About Me page. Checking out the About Me 
page of people you conduct business with gives you an opportunity to get 
to know them. Because eBay is a cyberspace market, you have no other way 
to let prospective bidders know that you’re a real person. (Don’t you shop

at some stores because you like the owners or people who work there?) 
The About Me page takes a first step toward establishing a professional and 
trusted identity at eBay.
The About Me page enables you to personalize yourself as a bidder to sellers 
and as a business to prospective bidders. (See Figure 8-1 for an example.) 
Your About Me page also becomes your About the Seller page if you have an 
eBay store.
 
Figure 8-1:

example of

An About Me page benefits you also when you buy. Sellers usually like to 
know about their bidders to build confidence in their trading partners. See 
an example of a personal My eBay page in Figure 8-2.
If you don’t have an About Me page, put this book down and set one up 
immediately. It doesn’t have to be a work of art; just get something up there 
to tell the rest of the community who you are. You can always go back later 
and add to (or redesign) it.

The About Me page can also be a deal-maker or a deal-breaker. Once I was 
looking around eBay for some extra-long printer cables, and I found several 
sellers selling just what I wanted. One of the lower-priced sellers had a low 
feedback rating because he was new on eBay. But he had an About Me page, 
so I clicked. I found out that the seller was a computer technician by trade 
and that he and his son made these computer cables together as a family 
business at home in the evenings. The money they made went to pay for 
their father-son trips to see their favorite baseball team play. What a great 
family enterprise! Better yet, he guaranteed the cables. As you might have 
guessed, I bought the cables, and we both got positive feedback.
Planning and Building an About Me Page
When you plan your About Me page, consider adding the following:
 
✦ Who you are and where you live.
 
✦ Your hobbies. If you collect things, here’s where to let the world know.
 
✦ Whether you run your eBay business full-time or part-time, and whether 
you have another career. This is more integral information about you; 
let the world know.

Planning and Building an About Me Page
144
 
✦ The type of merchandise that your business revolves around. Promote it 
here; tell the reader why your merchandise and service are the best!
 
✦ Your most recent feedback and a list of your current auctions.
To create your page, click the Me icon next to any user’s name, scroll to 
the bottom of the About Me page that appears, find the line that reads “To 
create your own About Me page, click here,” and click. You can also click the 
About Me link on the My Account: Personal Information page on My eBay. Or 
go to
pages.ebay.com/community/aboutme.html
Then follow the simple formatted template for your first page and work from 
there.
 
When you begin to sell on eBay, your About Me page is an important sales 
tool — so take your time when you create your page. A well-thought-out 
About Me page improves your sales because people who come across your 
auctions and check out your About Me page can get a sense of who you are 
and how serious you are about your eBay activities. They see instantly that 
you’re no fly-by-night seller.
Before you create your About Me page, I suggest that you look at what other 
users have done. eBay members often include pictures, links to other Web 
sites (including their personal or business home pages), and links to just 
about any Web location that reflects their personalities. If your purpose is to 
generate more business, however, I recommend that you keep your About 
Me page focused on your auction listings, with a link to your Web site.
The page can be as simple or as complex as you want. You may use one of 
eBay’s templates as presented or gussy up the page with lots of pictures and 
varied text using HTML.
 
Sellers with many auctions running at once often add a message to their 
About Me pages indicating that they’re willing to reduce shipping charges if 
bidders bid on their other auctions as well. This direct tactic may lack 
nuance, but it increases the number of people who look at (and bid on) your 
auctions.
Gathering your thoughts
There are several things you must think about prior to setting up your page:
 
✦ Title: Come up with a title for your page. It should be as simple as a wel-
come greeting.
 
✦ Subtitle: This consists of a few words below your page title that elabo-
rate on your page theme.

Book I
Chapter 8
Participating in 
the Community
Planning and Building an About Me Page
145
 
✦ Introductory paragraph: This paragraph can tell a little about you and 
your hobbies or interests. You can also talk about the items you sell on 
eBay, but most of all it should reflect your personality.
 
 In the paragraphs of the About Me page, you can use HTML to add 
images or fancy text. The titles, however, are standard and won’t permit 
HTML coding.
 
✦ Second subtitle and paragraph: Here you can elaborate on your inter-
ests and business on eBay. Add more information. Pictures are good too!
 
✦ eBay activity: Decide what you’d like to show on the page — how many 
of your most recent feedback comments and whether you’d like to show 
your current listings on the page.
 
 Don’t get carried away by showing your last 100 feedback messages; 
doing so takes up too much space. Display either 10 or 25 and leave it at 
that. If visitors want to know more about your feedback rating, they can 
click your feedback number. (After all, they clicked your Me icon to get 
here, and that’s next to your feedback number.)
 
✦ Links: There are strict policies governing the use of links on eBay these 
days. You can link to your own Web site, but only from your About Me 
page. Visit Book III, Chapter 2 for all these details. 
If you’ve been an advanced user on eBay for a while, consider adding the fol-
lowing to your existing My eBay page:
 
✦ Your logo: If you’ve designed a logo for your eBay business, be sure to 
put it on the page.
 
✦ Returns policy: Outline your standard returns policy for your customers.
 
✦ Shipping policy: Explain how you ship and when you ship. Offer dis-
counts on shipping for multiple purchases through your eBay store.
 
✦ Searchable index to your eBay store: Let your customers search your 
store by apparel size, brand name, or item. You can accomplish this 
with HTML coding.
 
✦ Payment methods: Let your customers know what payment methods 
you accept.
Setting up the page
To create your About Me page, do the following:
 
1. Click the Site Map link at the upper right of every eBay page.
 
 The Site Map page appears.
 
2. In the Connect area, click the About Me link.

3. If you haven’t signed in, type your user ID and password in the appro-
priate boxes.
 
 You’re taken to the About Me page, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
4. Click the Click Here button.
 
5. Decide whether you want to use eBay’s easy step-by-step process or 
enter your own HTML code, and then click Continue.
 
 Because entering HTML code assumes you really know what you’re 
doing, I suggest that you choose the step-by-step process.
 
6. Enter the following information:
 
• Page title: Type the title of your About Me page (for example, 
Welcome to Larry Lunch’s Lunchbox Place).
 
• Welcome paragraph: Type a personal, attention-grabbing bit of

• Another paragraph: Type text for the second paragraph of the page, 
such as Vintage, Modern, Ancient, or I Collect All Kinds of Lunchboxes. 
Then maybe talk about yourself or your collection (such as, I used to 
stare at lunchboxes in the school cafeteria . . . only more, you know, 
normal).
 
• Picture: If you’re adding a picture, type a sentence describing it, for 
example: This is my wife Loretta with our lunchbox collection.
 
• Picture URL: Type the Web site address (URL) where people can find 
your picture. See Book V, Chapter 5 to find out how to upload digital 
images to your own (probably free) image area.
 
• Feedback: Select how many of your feedback postings you want 
to appear on your About Me page. (You can opt not to show any 
feedback, but I think you should put in a few comments, especially if 
they’re complimentary, as in, “Larry sent my lunchbox promptly, and 
it makes lunchtime a blast! Everybody stares at it. . . .”)
 
• Items for Sale: Select how many of your current auctions you want 
to appear on your About Me page. If you don’t have any auctions run-
ning at the moment, you can select the Show No Items option.
 
• Favorite Links: Type the names and URLs of any Web links you want 
visitors to see, for example, a Web site that appraises lunchboxes. (“It’s 
in excellent condition except for that petrified ham sandwich. . . .”)
 
7. After you’ve finished entering this information (and are happy with 
how it looks), click Continue at the bottom of the page.
 
 Don’t worry if you’re not absolutely wild about your page on the first 
pass. The important part is to get it published. You can go back and 
make changes as often as you want.
 
8. On the About Me Preview and Submit page, click the button that cor-
responds to the layout option you want.
 
 You are presented with three layout options, as shown in Figure 8-5.

9. Scroll down the page and check out what your About Me page will 
look like.
 
 If you don’t like your current layout, go back up the page and change the 
layout.
 
10. If you don’t like what you see, click the Back button and do some 
more editing.
 
11. When you’re happy with your masterpiece, click the Submit button.
 
 You did it. Now anyone in the world with access to the Internet can find 
your personal About Me page on eBay.
 
Don’t forget to update your About Me page often. A good About Me page 
makes bidders eager to know more about your auctions. An out-of-date 
About Me page turns off potential bidders. If you choose to update, you need 
to edit it using HTML. If you don’t use HTML, you have to create an entire 
new page.
 
You can link to your About Me page from your Web site or from your e-mail 
because all About Me pages have their own personal URLs. You can find 
your About Me page by typing members.ebay.com/aboutme/ followed by 
your user ID. Here’s the URL for my page (shown in Figure 8-6):

Reaching the World through Your My World Page

Reaching the World through Your My World Page
If blogging is the key to the new Web, then your My World page is the hub of 
your eBay user interaction. Your About Me page is there for customers, and 
the My World page is mostly used by the eBay community. People like to 
know about other people, and the My World page shows your world, 
your way.
Although my editors would love for me to give you a long, drawn out, step-
by-step list to show you how to get to your My World page – I won’t. It’s all 
too simple: Just click your user ID on your My eBay page (or any page for 
that matter) and you’ll arrive at your own (ready-to-fill-out) My World page. 
To visit the hub (okay, here’s the URL), just go to
http://myworld.ebay.com/
You’ll arrive at the My World hub as shown in Figure 8-7.
 
Figure 8-7: 
The My 
World Hub 
page.
 
If you go to the hub, click the View My World button. After you click through, 
you see a page ready to edit. Here’s the lowdown on what you can do:
 
✦ Edit Image. By clicking here, you’ll come to a page that allows you to 
automatically upload a picture from your computer, or use one of the 
handy (but unexciting) eBay-supplied avatars to appear on your My 
World page.

✦ Items for Sale. Here you can choose which and how many of the items 
you have for sale to show on your page.
 
✦ Add Content. Here you can add things about your eBay life that you’d 
like everyone to see.
 
• Favorites. Pick up your favorite searches, sellers, and stores, and 
show them here.
 
• Bio. This link takes you to a form where you can write up a quick and 
simple bio of yourself.
 
• Neighborhoods. Once you get going on eBay, if you have a little 
time, you might just want to joining these special interest groups. I 
am a member of Coffee Lovers (7,250 members), Photography (1,996 
members), and Star Trek (256 members — hey, everybody needs to 
escape reality now and then).
 
• Reviews and Guides. If you’ve written reviews of items on the site, 
or written a guide on how to do something (anything), you can have 
these reviews show up on your My World page.
 
• Guest Book. Use this feature to enable people to leave you messages 
on your page. Visit my My World page at

The navigation bar has a handy Community link that connects you to the 
people and happenings on eBay. eBay has more than 100 million members — 
a bigger population than some countries — but it can still have that small-
town feel through groups, chat rooms, and discussion boards. Start on the 
main page by clicking Community on the navigation bar. Now you can access 
more than three dozen category-specific chat and discussion boards, a 
bunch of general chat and discussion boards, and help discussion boards.
But there’s a whole lot more to the eBay community, as you find out in this 
section. Take a little time to explore it for yourself.
News and chat, this and that
The Community Overview page is not quite like The New York Times (“All 
the News That’s Fit to Print”), but it is the place to go to find all the news, 
Neighborhoods, chat rooms, and message board links. Figure 8-9 shows you 
what the page looks like.
Hear ye, hear ye! eBay’s announcement boards
If you were living in the 1700s, you’d see a strangely dressed guy in a funny 
hat ringing a bell and yelling, “Hear ye, hear ye!” every time you opened 
eBay’s announcement boards. (Then again, if you were living in the 1700s, 
you’d have no electricity, no computer, no fast food, or anything else you 
probably consider fun — like eBay!) In any case, eBay’s announcement 
boards are the most important place to find out what’s going on (directly 
from headquarters) on the Web site. And no one even needs to ring a bell.
You have your choice of two boards: the general announcement board and 
the system announcement board. The general announcement board is where 
eBay lists new features and policy changes. Visiting this page is like reading 
your morning eBay newspaper, because eBay adds comments to this page 
almost every day. You find out about upcoming changes in categories, new 
promotions, and eBay goings-on. Reach this page by clicking the link or 
going to the following
www2.ebay.com/aw/marketing.shtml

Because the general announcement page carries announcements almost 
back to the beginning of eBay time, let me give you a quick way to find what 
you’re looking for. Suppose you want to find out about any new Feedback 
changes. Just use your browser’s Find feature by pressing Ctrl+F. Type feed-
back in the box that appears, and you’ll quickly find the announcements 
you’re looking for.
Figure 8-10 shows you eBay’s general announcement board, complete with 
information that could affect your listings.
 
When you look at some of eBay’s URL addresses, you may notice a subfolder 
named /aw/. The aw harkens back to the day when eBay wasn’t eBay — but 
was AuctionWeb instead (way back when I joined up).
eBay reports outages and system glitches on the system announcement 
board, at the following address:
www2.ebay.com/aw/announce.shtml
eBay uses this board also to update users on glitches in the system and 
when those may be rectified (should you wonder whether the problem is 
lurking on your computer or on the eBay system).

Community Overview page.
Help! I need somebody
If you ever have specific eBay questions, several eBay discussion help 
boards on the Community: Chat page can help you. You can also go directly 
to the chat rooms to pose your question to the eBay members currently in 
residence.
Boards work differently from chat rooms. Chat rooms are full of people who 
are hanging out talking to each other, all at the same time. Users of discus-
sion boards, however, tend to go in, leave a message or ask a question, and 
pop out again. Also, to get an answer in a message board, you need to start a 
thread by asking a question. Title your thread with your question, and you’ll 
no doubt get an answer to your query posted swiftly. Take a look at the tech-
nical issues discussion board in Figure 8-11.
 
You can get most eBay-related questions answered by going to eBay’s 
Answer Center, which you get to by clicking the Answer Center link in the 
Connect area. You then see questions covering almost any topic you can 
think of regarding listings on eBay. Just post your question and some kindly 
eBay member will probably suggest an answer.

Figure 8-11: 
One of 
the handy 
discussion 
boards on 
eBay.
 
 
eBay newbies often find that the boards are good places to add to their 
knowledge of eBay. As you scroll on by, read the Q & A postings from the 
past; your question may already be answered in an earlier posting. You can 
even ask someone on the board to look at your auction listing and provide 
an opinion on your descriptions or pictures.
Community chat rooms
Because sending e-mail to eBay’s customer service people can be frustrat-
ingly slow if you need an answer right away (they get bombarded with a 
gazillion questions a day), you may want to try for a faster answer by post-
ing your question on one of the community message boards.
 
You can always tell whether an eBay staff member is replying on a board 
because the top border line of his or her post is in pink (not gray, as with 
regular users). They’ve earned the nickname “Pinks” on the boards.
 
Knowledgeable veteran eBay members or customer-service “pinks” (if 
they’re around) generally answer posted questions as best they can. The 
answers are the opinions of members and are certainly not eBay gospel. 
Most questions are answered in about 15 minutes. If not, repost your ques-
tion — but make sure you do so on the appropriate board; each board has a 
specific topic of discussion.
Members who post on these boards often share helpful tips and Web sites 
and alert other members to scams. Newbies may find that lurking (reading 
without posting) on some of these boards helps them find out more about 
how eBay works. Occasionally, an eBay staffer shows up, which is kinda like 
inviting Bill Gates to a meeting of new Windows users. eBay staff members 
are usually hounded with questions.

Playing Nice with Other eBay Members

If a new policy or some sort of big change occurs, the boards are most likely 
going to fill pretty quickly with discussion about it. On slow days, however, 
you may need to wade through personal messages and chatting with no con-
nection to eBay. Many of the people who post on these boards are longtime 
members with histories (as well as feuds) that can rival any soap opera. On 
rare occasions, the postings can get abusive. Getting involved in personality 
clashes or verbal warfare gains you nothing. Duck the crossfire and look for 
the useful stuff.
No matter how peeved the users of a chat room or message board may get — 
and no matter how foul or raunchy the language — no one on eBay ever sees 
it. eBay uses a built-in vulgarity checker that deletes any (well, okay, as many 
as possible) words or phrases that eBay considers offensive or obscene.
 
The one cardinal rule for eBay chat boards and message boards is: No doing 
business on the board. No advertising items for sale! Not now. Not ever. eBay 
bans any repeat offenders who break this rule from participating on these 
boards.
User-to-user (General) discussion boards
In addition to chat boards, eBay also has discussion boards, in which the 
topics are deliberately open-ended — just as the topics of discussion in 
coffeehouses tend to vary depending on who happens to be in them at 
any given time. Check out these areas and read ongoing discussions about 
You know you need help, but you don’t know 
which area is best for you. Here’s my take on 
which boards are most helpful:
 ✓ Auction listings board: This discussion 
board is a catch-all for many subjects. 
If you don’t see a board specific to your 
question (or if you post to another board 
and get no reply), try this one — it’s always 
hopping with lots of peeps (people).
 ✓ Photos/HTML board and images/HTML 
board: Good help from other eBay mem-
bers for those with specific questions 
about using HTML and posting pictures in 
your auctions.
 
 You can access a new board from any 
other board by scrolling the drop-down list 
at the top of each board page.
 ✓ Discuss eBay’s newest features chat: This 
board (also known as DNF) is where you 
find many of the folks devoted to protesting 
eBay’s policies and new features. Brace 
yourself — conversation on this board 
can become nasty. Keep in mind, however, 
that many of the regulars on this board are 
extremely knowledgeable about eBay.

eBay’s latest buzz. It’s a lot of fun and good reading. Post your opinions to 
the category that suits you. Here are few of my favorites:
 
✦ The eBay Town Square: A potpourri of various subjects and topics.
 
✦ The Soapbox: The place to voice your views and suggestions to help 
build a better eBay.
 
✦ Night Owls Nest: A fun locale for creatures of the night and their unique 
postings. (As I’m writing this, for example, there’s a thread with spirited 
advice to a community member who needs help with his “gassy” cat.)
 
✦ The Park: An interesting place where community members join in for 
fun ideas.
Checking Out Other Chat Rooms 
About a dozen chat rooms on eBay specialize in everything from pure chat 
to charity work. In this section, I describe a few of these boards.
Café society
The eBay Café (eBay’s first message board from back when eBay was mostly 
selling Pez candy dispensers) and AOL Café message boards attract mostly 
regulars chatting about eBay gossip. Frequent postings include the sharing 
of personal milestones and whatever else is on people’s minds. You can also 
find useful information about eBay and warnings about potential scams.
Holiday board
Although eBay suggests that this is the place to share your favorite holiday 
memories and thoughts, it’s really a friendly place where people meet and 
chat about home and family. Stop by for cybermilk and cookies next time 
you have a few minutes and want to visit with your fellow auction addicts.
Giving board
eBay isn’t only about making money. On the Giving board, it’s also about 
making a difference. Members in need post their stories and requests for 
assistance. Other members with items to donate post offers for everything 
from school supplies to clothing.
 
If you feel like doing a good deed, conduct a member-benefit auction or 
donate directly to those in need. For information on how to participate, visit 
the eBay’s GivingWorks at
www.ebaygivingworks.com

When you visit the eBay boards, you may notice 
that many experienced posters to the board 
have cute little smiley icons, called emoticons, 
next to their posts to show emotion. The follow-
ing table shows how you too can doll up your 
posts with a little emotion.
You can type the keyboard shortcuts or use 
the HTML image links to display your chosen 
icon. Be sure not to put spaces between the 
characters in the key combinations. Using 
HTML is pretty easy; for example, <img 
src=”http://groups.ebay.com/
images/emoticons/blush.gif”> 
gets you the blushing smiley.

Emergency contact board
The Emergency contact board is no Rescue 911, but if your computer 
crashes and you lose all your info, this board is the place to put out an all-
points bulletin for help. If your ISP goes on vacation, your phone line is on 
the fritz, or you’re abducted by aliens and can’t connect to your buyers or 
sellers, use a friend’s computer to post a message on the emergency contact 
board. A dedicated group of eBay users frequent this board, and they will try 
to help you by passing on your e-mails to the intended parties. Talk about a 
bunch of givers!
 
Recently a bidder posted to say that her computer had crashed and that she 
was in the process of moving. She asked her sellers to be patient and she 
would get to them as soon as possible. The friendly regulars of the emer-
gency contact board looked up her bidding history and e-mailed the sellers 
whose auctions she’d won in the last week. Then they forwarded her the 
e-mails they’d sent on her behalf. The sellers understood the situation and 
did not leave negative feedback for the lack of communication.

If you’re having trouble contacting other eBay members, posting for help 
from other members to track ’em down often gets the job done.
If you think you may be the victim of a rip-off, check the emergency contact 
board. The buyer or seller may have left word about an e-mail problem. On 
the flip side, you may find out that you’re not alone in trying to track down 
an eBay delinquent who seems to have skipped town. Posting information 
about a potentially bad eBay guy is (at the least) bad manners on most 
boards. If you wrap it in the guise of an emergency contact, however, you 
can clue in other members about a potential problem. Stick to the facts and 
make the post as honest and useful (and non-inflammatory) as you can.
To access the emergency contact board, follow these steps:
 
1. From the eBay navigation bar, click the Community link.
 
 You are brought to the Community hub page.
 
2. In the Connect area, click the Chat Rooms link.
 
 You are now on the main Chat page.
 
3. Scroll down the Chat page and click Emergency Contact.
 
 You see a board full of messages from all the desperate sellers and 
buyers trying to locate each other.
eBay international chat boards
People from all around the world enjoy eBay. If you’re considering buying or 
selling globally, visit the international boards. They’re a great place to post 
questions about shipping and payments for overseas transactions. Along 
with eBay chat, the international boards have discussions about current 
events and international politics.
 
Got a seller or bidder in Italy? Spain? France? Translate your English 
messages into the appropriate language through the following Web site:
babelfish.yahoo.com
If you venture into unfamiliar foreign tongues, I suggest you keep things 
simple. Don’t try to get fancy with your verbiage — stick to standard phrases 
that can translate literally with minimum hassle.

Sharing Knowledge in Category-Specific Chat Rooms
Want to talk about Elvis, Louis XV, Sammy Sosa, or Howard the Duck? More 
than twenty category-specific chat boards enable you to tell eBay members 
what’s on your mind about merchandise and auctions. You reach these 
boards by clicking Community on the main navigation bar and then clicking 
Chat Rooms in the Connect area.
Discussions mainly focus on merchandise and the nuts and bolts of transac-
tions. Category-specific chat boards are great for posting questions on items 
that you don’t know much about.
 
You’ll get all kinds of responses from all kinds of people. Take some of the 
help you get with a grain of salt, because some of the folks who help you 
may be buyers or competitors.
These boards are also great for finding out where to go for more information 
and to conduct research on specific items. You can also find helpful sources 
for shipping information about items in that category (such as large furni-
ture in the Antiques section or breakable items on the Glass chat board).
 
Don’t be shy. As your second-grade teacher said, “No questions are dumb.” 
Most eBay members love to share their knowledge.
Joining eBay Groups
If you’re the friendly type and would like an instant group of new friends, 
I suggest you click the Groups link in the Connect area. Here you can find 
thousands of user groups hosted on eBay but run by eBay community mem-
bers. They may be groups consisting of people from the same geographic 
area, folks with similar hobbies, or those interested in buying or selling in 
particular categories.
eBay groups may be public clubs (open to all) or private clubs (invited mem-
berships only) with their own private boards, accessible only by members of 
the group.
Joining a group is easy: Just click any of the links on the main Groups page, 
and you’re presented with a dizzying array of groups to join. Your best bet is 
to participate in chats or discussions and find other members that you’d like 
to join up with.

hink of walking into a store and seeing thousands of aisles of shelves con-

around the site, and you instantly understand the size and scope of what’s for 
sale. You may feel overwhelmed at first, but the clever eBay folks have come 
up with lots of ways to help you find exactly what you’re looking for.
Working eBay’s Search Engine
Anyone can find an auction on eBay. Finding bargains or researching sell-
ing prices accurately, on the other hand, requires some finesse. The key is 
understanding how to search the site for hidden treasures. Just as knowing 
how to browse the categories is important, knowing how to work the search 
engine expertly will help you find your item for the lowest price.
The best part about shopping on eBay is that you can find just about every-
thing, from that esoteric lithium battery to new designer dresses (with 
matching shoes) to pneumatic jackhammers. New or used, it’s all here — 
lurking in the millions of daily listings. But finding the nuggets (deals) can be 
like searching for the proverbial needle in the haystack. The search secrets 
in this chapter will put you head and shoulders above your competition for 
the deals.
Going where the Search button takes you
The single most important button on any eBay page is the Search button. 
When you type some keywords and click this button, you’ll be presented 
with a list of items matching your keywords on eBay.

Working eBay’s Search Engine
166
Should you want a more advanced type of search, click the Advanced Search 
link next to the Search button. You’re whisked to the Advanced Search: Find 
Items page, which will have your search options in a box on the left side of 
the page, as shown in Figure 1-1. Three categories of searches are available, 
and each enables you to search for information in a different way.
 
To enhance your search, ask the search engine to check both item titles and 
item descriptions. Select the check box next to Search Title and Description 
to open up your search. You’ll get more hits if you select the Search Title 
and Description check box, but you may also get too many items that are out 
of your search range.
Tips to keep in mind before you search
When searching on eBay, don’t forget the 
following:
 ✓ Ignore capitalization of proper names: 
eBay doesn’t care whether you capitalize. 
In other words, the search engine doesn’t 
distinguish between caps and noncaps.
 ✓ Don’t use noise words: and, a, an, or, or 
the are called noise words. In searches, 
these words are interpreted as part of 
your search unless you enclose them in 
quotes. Let’s say we want to find items 
from the 1939 classic film, Gone with the 
Wind. I got 1,401 hits from Gone with the 
Wind and 1,486 hits with a search for gone 
wind. Many sellers drop the noise words 
from their titles, so use as few keywords 
as you can to expand your search.
 ✓ Don’t search just within specific cat-
egories: Although a category-specific 
search narrows your results, you also 
might miss a great deal of items. Take a 
look at “Understanding eBay’s Category 
Hierarchy,” later in this chapter.
 ✓ Think of possible synonyms: For example, 
while searching for a ladies watch, I found 
the following synonyms and abbreviations 
for ladies: lady’s, ladys, lds, and femmes.
 ✓ Use the asterisk symbol to locate misspell-
ings: I’ve often found some great deals by 
finding items incorrectly posted by the sell-
ers. Here are a few examples:
 
 Rodri*. In this search I look for items by the 
famous Cajun artist George Rodrigue. His 
Blue Dog paintings are world renowned 
and valuable. By using this search, I man-
aged to purchase a signed Blue Dog litho-
graph for under $200. (I resold it on eBay 
later that year for $900!)
 
 Alumi* tree. Remember the old aluminum 
Christmas trees from the ’60s? They’ve had 
quite a resurgence in popularity. You can 
buy these “antiques” in stores for hun-
dreds of dollars, or you can buy one on 
eBay for half the price. You can find them 
even cheaper if the seller can’t spell alumi-
num.
 
 Cemet* plot. If you’re looking for that final 
place to retire, eBay has some great deals. 
Unfortunately, sellers haven’t narrowed 
down whether they want to spell it cem-
etery or cemetary. This search will find 
both.

Figure 1-1: 
The various 
searches 
available 
in the 
Advanced 
Search 
area.
 
Under the Items field, you can choose the following types of searches:
 
✦ Find Items: Search by keywords or item number. Type the keywords 
that describe an item (for example, Superman lunchbox or antique pocket 
watch) and click Search, and you can see how many are available on 
eBay.
 
✦ On eBay Motors. Looking for something related to wheels or an engine? 
Click here to see the form specifically designed for eBay Motors 
searches.
 
✦ By Seller: Every person on eBay has a personal user ID (the name you 
use to conduct transactions). Use the Items by Seller search if you liked 
the merchandise from a seller’s auction and want to see what else the 
seller has for sale. Type the seller’s user ID, and you get a list of every 
item that person is selling.
 
✦ By Bidder: User IDs help eBay keep track of every move a user makes 
at eBay. If you want to see what a particular user (say, a fellow Star Trek 
fan) is bidding on, use the Items by Bidder search. Type a user ID in the 
By Bidder search box, and you get a list of everything the user has won.
 
✦ By Item Number: Every item that’s up for auction on eBay is assigned an 
item number, which is displayed next to the item name on its page. To 
find an item by number, just type the number and click Search.
The second search field is Stores. Once you click the link to search in Stores, 
you can search by two options:
 
✦ Stores with matching items: eBay stores have their own search engine. 
Listings of items in eBay stores will appear on a regular search for items 
only under select circumstances.

Working eBay’s Search Engine
168
 
✦ Store name only: If you know an eBay store name or description, you 
can type a store name — or portion of a store name — and find the store 
you’re looking for.
The final search area is Members:
 
✦ Find a Member: Here you can type the user ID of any eBay member to 
view his or her feedback profile, About Me page, or user ID history.
 
✦ Find Contact Information: When you are in a transaction with someone, 
you can type the person’s user ID and the number of the transaction to 
receive an e-mail containing the phone number of your trading partner. 
This works only if you have a current bid or have bought an item.
Performing a basic search in Advanced
It’s your choice — you can make your search as complex (or confusing) as 
you wish by using the gazillions of options on the Advanced Search page. 
You can also choose to keep it somewhat basic. I know, it sounds a tad 
bizarre, but the basic Find Items search is a bit more advanced than typing a 
few keywords into a box. You do have more options.
When you click Advanced Search on any eBay page, you are brought to the 
Advanced Search page. On this search form you’ll see innumerable boxes. 
You can fill out some or all of them. The more information you type into this 
form, the more concise your search can be.
To illustrate this, let’s do a basic search as you might do from the Search 
box. It’s a lot easier to find your items in the simple method. Stumped on 
what words to use in your search? Consider the item you’re trying to find. 
Look at it and determine which words best describe it. Suppose that your 
favorite china pattern has been discontinued and you want to search eBay 
for some missing pieces. To quickly find the pieces, follow this process:
 
1. Determine the manufacturer’s name.
 
 Since I’m looking for a plate, I turn over the plate I have to look on the 
back for the manufacturer’s name — it’s Dansk!
 
 If you don’t have all the information you need, check out the manu facturer’s 
Web site or a Web site that specializes in the item you’re look ing for.
 
2. Determine the name for the series, collection, pattern, or design.
 
 Sometimes an item has more than one name. For example, I’m searching 
for Bistro (the name of the collection) and Maribo (the pattern name).
 
3. Narrow your search even further, if possible or necessary.
 
 For example, I need to replace a salad plate.

Book II
Chapter 1
Researching 
on eBay
169
Working eBay’s Search Engine
169
 
4. Enter the words for your search.
 
 I typed Dansk Bistro Maribo salad into the keyword box. If someone has 
listed an item with all those words in the title, I’ll be lucky and pull up 
some winners. However, it’s more likely that the words in your initial 
search are buried in the description.
 
5. After you get your search results, you can narrow your search by 
searching in a category.
 
 Use the drop-down list at the top of the results to limit your search to a 
particular main (or top-level) category, for example, instead of search-
ing all eBay categories. This might be a good idea if you know for sure 
where the item is listed. 
 
 But items often cross over different categories. When they do, eBay lists 
(on the left side of the page) the actual categories where the search 
items were found. From my search results (pictured in Figure 1-2), I 
can see that my salad plates are listed in the sub-category of Pottery & 
China. In this instance, I’m lucky that they are listed in only one area, so 
it’s clear that I’ve found exactly what I’m searching for.
 
 Because my search turned up fewer than 20 items, eBay displays — 
below the core eBay Buy-it-Nows and Auction listings — the items that 
both match my search and can be found in eBay Stores.
 
 I often leave this option alone so that my search encompasses all catego-
ries. Sometimes sellers (when listing many items at once) make mistakes 
and list in the wrong category. That’s when you can find a real deal.

plates.

6. Tell eBay how you want the results arranged by using the drop-down list.
 
 For example, if you want to check out auctions in order of how soon they’re 
closing, choose Items Ending Soonest. (This is my favorite option — you 
might miss the deal of the century while you’re sifting through hundreds of 
listings in another order.) In the Sort By area, choose one of the following 
options:
 
• Best Match: This is eBay’s default when you search for an item. It’s 
the latest invention on searching. No one really knows exactly what 
this means. eBay describes it this way:
 
 Along with the listing keywords and other information, one of the most 
important elements in this calculation is the historical buyer behavior 
on the site for similar searches.
 
 Er, I always prefer my searches as Ending Soonest, but “Best Match” 
in my searches doesn’t work that way.
 
 I can tell you that sellers, according to their information on the 
“seller dashboard,” are raised and lowered in search according to 
buyer satisfaction and detailed seller ratings (DSRs). Also, offering 
free shipping (as long as you’re in good standing) will bring your 
items higher up in Best Match searches.
 
 Here’s another reason, that, as a buyer, you might not want to penal-
ize a seller just because “I don’t give anyone five stars.” Those Star 
ratings mean a whole lot to sellers; please be generous when you’ve 
had a good transaction. (Rant over).
 
• Time: Ending Soonest: Auctions closing first appear at the top of the 
results.
 
• Time: Newly Listed: The most recently posted auctions are listed first.
 
• Price + Shipping: Lowest First: Auctions are listed based on the 
combined cost of shipping to your ZIP code and the price of the item. 
They are listed as lowest priced to the highest priced.
 
• Price + Shipping: Highest First: This search, too, is based on the 
combined cost of shipping and the current cost (or high bid) on the 
item. Items are listed from highest- to lowest-priced. 
 
• Price: Highest First: This sort of ignores the shipping costs and goes 
right to the heart of the search; the price of the item. This is useful 
when you’re searching for, say, a 1967 Corvette and you want to buy 
a car, not a Hot Wheels toy.
 
• Distance: Nearest First: If you’re looking for a bunny-style, wrought-
iron boot scraper or something as huge as a stove, you might want 
to buy from a seller who is close by to save shipping costs (you may 
even be able to pick up the item).
 
• Category: This groups the items in your results by category.

7. Use the next drop-down list to select how you want to view the results.
 
 You’ve got three choices:
 
• List View: The standard eBay format of the gallery picture on the left 
and the listing information to the right.
 
• Gallery View: Here (as shown in Figure 1-3) you see the search 
results in little boxes. I don’t find this method as efficient because 
each listing takes up more space on my viewable page — and I have 
to scroll more to view all the results. I also find it more difficult to 
compare listings at a glance, because so few show up on each screen.
 
• Snapshot View. I dunno, call me crazy, but looking at a bunch of pic-
tures without pricing (as in Figure 1-4) seems pretty useless.
 
8. Select how many items you want to see on a page.
 
 eBay searches default to 50 items per page. You may want to see more 
or less depending on the speed of your connection. In list view the 
options are 25, 50, 100, and 200.
 
9. After you’ve filled in all your search parameters, click the Search 
button.
 
 A list of auctions appears, in the order you selected in the Sort By area.
 
The eBay search engine is more sophisticated than ever. If you want to per-
form a super-quick search by keyword or item number, just type it in any of 
eBay’s search boxes throughout the site.

If you want to search completed items to get an idea of what the salad plate 
has sold for before, select the check box next to Completed Listings Only. 
This search returns results of items that have already ended. This is my 
favorite search option on eBay; I use it as a strategic bidding and pricing 
tool. How? If you’re bidding on an item and want to know whether the prices 
are likely to go too high for your pocketbook, you can use this search option 
to compare the current price of the item to the selling price of similar items 
from auctions that have already ended. You can go back about two weeks.
Refining even the most basic search
You can refine your search even further by clicking the Advanced Search 
link next to the Search box at the top of your search results page. This link 
throws quite a few more options into the package. Don’t be intimidated; you 
need to understand just a few more bells and whistles.
All the options from the basic search are available on the Advanced Search 
page, plus a few more:
 
✦ Words: You can choose to search
 
 All of these words
 
 Any of these words
 
 Exact Phrase
 
 Exact Match only
 
 To save yourself a lot of grief, photocopy Table 1-1. It features shortcuts 
you can use in the basic Search box to get the same results as the above 
options — and more.

✦ Exclude words from your search: If you’re looking for some silver flat-
ware, and you want it to be solid, not plated, you could type plated. That 
search would exclude any item listings that contain the word plated.
 
✦ Items Priced: Here’s where you can narrow your search to a specific 
price range. I don’t recommend using this option because you never 
know what you might miss.
 
✦ From Specific Sellers: If you want to locate an item being sold by up to 
ten sellers, you can type their user IDs here, separating each user ID by 
a comma or a space. If you want to find items excluding certain sellers, 
click the drop-down list and list the offending sellers in the text box.
 
✦ Location: You can elect to see your results from all items on eBay or you 
can search by country.
 
• All Items Listed on eBay.com: Search all of eBay, no matter which 
country.
 
• Items Available To: Select a country from the drop-down list and 
the search engine looks for items from sellers willing to ship to that 
country.
 
• Items Located In: Use the drop-down box to find items from the 
country you specified.
 
✦ Currency: If you have a yen to pay for your item with a foreign currency 
(so to speak), you can search for sellers who accept the following:
 
• Any currency
 
• U. S. dollar
 
• Australian dollar
 
• Canadian dollar
 
• Euro
 
• Indian rupee
 
• New Taiwan dollar
 
• Pounds sterling
 
• Swiss franc
 
✦ Multiple Item Listings: If you’re looking for a gaggle of stuffed geese, you 
can input a number and indicate whether you want At Least, Exactly, or 
At Most that many. You may alternatively indicate that you’re looking 
for any listing listed as a lot.
Next, you can select to display only particular items:
 
✦ Auctions only: If you love the thrill of bidding, you can limit your search 
to auctions only. (But why? There may be a better deal in Buy It Now.)

Working eBay’s Search Engine
174
 
✦ Buy It Now items only: This option comes in handy when you simply 
must purchase something immediately. This would work well for the 
pair of tickets you’ve found to The Producers or when you’re about to 
run out of your favorite moisturizer and don’t have time to make it to 
the store within the next week to pick some up.
 
 You can isolate Buy It Now items also by clicking the Buy It Now tab, 
which appears at the top of the search results.
 
✦ Locate Items Near You: If you’re selling or buying something big that 
you can’t (or don’t want to) ship or pick up, this option allows you to 
select a mileage range of 10 to 2000 miles. You may also type in a ZIP 
code or select a popular city.
 
✦ Items being sold for charitable organizations: If you’re looking for 
items being sold only to benefit nonprofits, you may indicate that here.
Should you not want to go through this tedious, step-by-step check-mark 
thing every time you want to make a thorough search, you might want to 
memorize the shortcuts in Table 1-1. These shortcuts can be typed in any 
simple search box on any eBay page to get a specialized search.

“stuart little” is more likely than 
stuart little to return items about 
the mouse because the former 
returns the words in the exact 
order you request.
Asterisk 
Serves as a wild-
card, good to use to 
include singular and 
plural of an item.
budd* returns items that start 
with budd, such as Beanie Buddy,

Searching for items by seller
The next search option in the Items search area is to find items by seller. 
After spending time on eBay, you’ll find that you have favorite sellers. You 
can always access a seller’s other items for sale by clicking the View Seller’s 
Other Items link on the listing page.
 
If you intend to follow the auctions of certain sellers, it’s a good idea to store 
their links in your My eBay page. (For more on that, see Chapter 5.)
Here’s a way to see whether one of your competing sellers has an item like 
yours up for sale:
 
1. Click the Items by Seller link.
 
2. On the resulting page, type the eBay user ID of the person you want to 
find out about.
 
 If you’re a buyer looking for items from a seller you’re doing business with 
and you only have the seller’s e-mail address, you can just type that in.
 
3. If you want to see auctions that this specific seller has conducted in 
the past, select the Include Completed Listings option.
 
 You can choose to see all current and previous auctions, as well as 
auctions that have ended in the last day, last week, or past 15 days, as 
shown in Figure 1-5.
 
 If you want to see the auctions that are closing right away, select Time 
Ending Soonest.

4. Show close and exact User ID matches.
 
 Sometimes you may not remember the exact User ID of someone. For 
example, I am marsha_c. You might not remember the underscore 
between the a and the c. When you click this option, you see all IDs that 
are similar to mine (although without the underscore, my ID doesn’t 
show up at all).
 
5. Click the Search button.
Searching for items by bidder
Also on the main search page is the Items by Bidder option. Sellers and 
buyers alike use it when an auction is going on to figure out their strategies. 
You may be wondering why you’d ever want to run a bidder search. Well, 
when you’ve been outbid by the same person several times, you might not 
need to ask that question. If you want an item badly enough, you’ll become 
interested in the bidding patterns of others. (See Book I, Chapter 6 for more 
bargain-shopping secrets.)
When researching your competition, always check out other bidders’ com-
pleted auctions as well as the times they’ve been outbid. This will give you a 
good grasp of their bidding modus operandi.
A bidder search is similar to a seller search, except you can add a few 
bidding filters. You can select to see every item the bidder has won.

Searching stores
The next search link area allows you to search eBay Stores. If you look back 
at Figure 1-3, you’ll see a Stores section on the left side of the page. You have 
a couple of options when you search from this area:
 
✦ Items in Stores: The search engine goes through all items listed in all 
eBay stores to find your selected keywords in the item title. (Searching 
eBay stores from the eBay search page allows you to search item titles 
and item descriptions as well as completed items.)
 
✦ Find Stores: The search engine searches only the store names and the 
brief store descriptions posted by the sellers.
When you are presented with your search 
results, you may notice tiny icons next to some 
of the items. Here’s a key to what those little 
pictures mean.
Icon 
What It Means
 
 The listing is new. The icon 
stays the first 24 hours an 
item is listed.
 
 The seller has included a 
picture along with the item 
description, and you must  
open the item listing to see 
the picture.
 
 The seller may perform gift 
services for that item, such 
as wrapping and shipping 
to another address.
 
 The item is listed with a 
gallery photo (may show up 
in a category search). 
Gallery photos are the small 
pictures of the item that you 
see next to a listing when 
you run a search.
 
 You may purchase the list-
ing for a set price without 
having it go into an auction.
 
 The item is being sold 
through a live auction. Click

appears on the eBay 
Motors site.

When you run a search for an item on eBay, you’ll see a column of yellow 
boxes on the left side of the results page. If you scroll down to the bottom, 
you’ll see the heading Matching eBay Stores. This area offers links to eBay 
stores that also carry the item you’re looking for.
Working with Search Results
With the growth of eBay, search results have become more and more com-
plex. The results page will give you lots of extra clues for narrowing your 
quest and homing in on exactly what you want. This is especially handy 
when you’ve performed your search through the small search boxes on 
most eBay pages, rather than initiating your search from the “official” Search 
page hub. Take a look at Figure 1-6, and note some of the important links.
At the top of the search results are tabs that can narrow your search in a 
way that may better suit your shopping plans. You can use the tabs to sort 
your results in three ways:
 
✦ All Items: This is the default view of the results page and the best way to 
see every item that matches your search.
 
✦ Auctions: Click this tab if you want to see only items up for auction.
 
✦ Buy It Now: If you’ve placed a search for an item that you want to buy 
now, this is for you. Click this tab and you’ll see the items that match 
your query that can be bought immediately.
You can also sort your results by listings ending soonest, newly listed items, 
the lowest or highest price plus shipping, the nearest location, and PayPal 
items first, Best Match or Category. All these options are available on the 
main search page, but you can sort on the results page as well.
Matching eBay Stores
When your search nets only a few items (for example, my search in Figure 1-3), 
eBay will give you some help by adding some store results under “Some of 
the matching items found in other eBay areas.” Below this headline, you’ll see 
stores listed, along with the price they charge for items that match the search.
Also, all eBay searches include links to stores that carry your item. These 
links are in the Matching eBay Stores area (on the bottom left). You’ll also 
see a link to all stores that match your search.

Rather than going through the pages of all results, I look at the category list 
on the left, and see a category that looks promising: Health & Beauty.
If I click the Health and Beauty category, I’ll have only 20 results. My search 
results can be refined even further by choosing one of the subcategories 
within Health and Beauty.
Search options
Below the Matching Categories area are check boxes that allow you to fur-
ther refine your search. Here are some of the handy options:
 
✦ Buying Options: Accomplishes the same thing as clicking the Buy It Now 
or Auction tab at the top of the results page.
 
✦ Gift items: Click here to see items with little blue box icons, which indi-
cate that the seller thinks this a good gift item and has paid eBay extra 
to let you know that.
 
✦ Completed Listings: The perfect search to do your research on how an 
item will sell for — or how much you should expect to pay.
 
✦ Free Shipping: You can isolate your search to only those sellers who 
offer free shipping. But why? They may have hiked their pricing to

Finding eBay Members
With millions of eBay users on the loose, you may think it’s hard to track 
folks down. Nope. eBay’s powerful search engine kicks into high gear to help 
you find other eBay members in seconds.
The search page also has links to find people or get info about them from 
eBay:
 
✦ Find a member: This link takes you to the main Find Members page, 
where you can search for specific About Me pages. You can also look at 
the feedback profile of a user and view user ID histories of fellow eBay 
members.
 
✦ Find contact information: If you’re involved in a transaction with some-
one, you can click this link to have the person’s phone number e-mailed 
to you. Because this information is confidential, you must be involved 
in a transaction with the person. You’ll be asked to type the other mem-
ber’s user ID and the transaction number you’re dealing with before this 
information is sent out.
 
✦ Find user ID: If you know a friend’s e-mail address, you can input it on 
this page to find out whether he or she is registered on eBay.
 
 To protect privacy and prevent possible harassment, you’ll have to be in 
a transaction with your friend before you get any information. 
 
The first nine of your favorite searches appear in a drop-down list on every 
page in the search-hub area.
Understanding eBay’s Category Hierarchy
Understanding eBay’s categories was a lot easier when there were just a 
few. I remember thinking that the quantity of categories was daunting when 
the site boosted the number up to the unthinkable 4000. Now that the total 
number of categories is approaching the 20,000 mark, the time has come to 
either abandon all hope of understanding them or to take things in hand and 
appreciate the elegance and organization of a system that’s just beyond the 
realm of comprehension. You may never totally understand the category 
structure, but that’s okay — what’s important is knowing which categories 
the sellers use most frequently.
 
As I write this book, eBay is adding, combining, and subtracting categories 
every two weeks to simplify the category structure. eBay works hard to keep 
the site in an organized fashion, but the constant reorganizing that’s 
necessary can be a little daunting for new users.

Understanding eBay’s Category Hierarchy
182
How the structure works
Go ahead, ask me what I’m interested in. Let’s see, I like art, golf, photog-
raphy, fashion — I won’t bore you with the rest, but it sounds like a fairly 
benign list, doesn’t it? I’m sure your list of interests is straightforward too. 
Right?
Well, not quite. Say you like golf as much as I do. You might just click the 
Sporting Goods category link on the home page, figuring you’ll find Golf on 
the next page as a link.
Surprise! The Sporting Goods category is made up of approximately 1200 
sub-, sub-sub-, and sub-sub-subcategories of everything from golf balls to 
Pittsburgh Penguins jerseys. (Golf alone has 87 subcategories.) This hasn’t 
been done to confuse you. It’s just that there are so many areas that your 
sports interest might take you. To accommodate the countless auctions that 
sports aficionados, collectors, and participants list, eBay had to create a lot 
of small areas.
Drilling down to your item
Depending on what you’re looking for, things can get confusing. For example, 
suppose I want to find a category with items relating to my dog, a somewhat 
obscure breed called schipperke. You might think I have it made. I mean, 
how could a category for such an esoteric breed of dog be anything but very 
simple?
Schipperkes have their own category in the main category of Collectibles 
on eBay. (eBay has categories in Collectibles for more than 120 breeds of 
dogs. Know anybody who collects dogs? See what I mean about mystifying?) 
Currently, 104 schipperke items are listed in the category.
But there are more auctions. When I ran a title search on Schipperke, I came 
up with 91 items, as shown in Figure 1-8. When I selected the check box to 
include descriptions, I got 124 listings. When I followed my own advice (ear-
lier in this chapter) and entered a search for schipperk*, I found 129 items. 
When I searched for shipperke (misspelled), I found 2 more.
Items for schipperke (and its misspellings) were listed in all these categories:
Collectibles: Animals: Dog: Schipperke
Collectibles: Animals: Dog: Other 
Collectibles: Animals: Dog: Schnauzer
Collectibles: Animals: Dog: Basset Hound
Collectibles: Animals: Dog: Rottweiler
Collectibles: Housewares & Kitchenware

I hope you realize where I’m going with all this. Even though I chose an 
arcane item, searching only through the specific category designated for it 
would have affected my search significantly. I would have missed some of 
the more interesting items.

f you don’t know what your item is worth, then as a seller you may not 
get the highest price. If you don’t know how to make your item easy to 
find, it may not be noticed by even the hardiest of collectors. If you don’t 
know the facts or what to say, your well-written title and detailed descrip-
tion (combined with a fabulous picture) may still not be enough to get the 
highest price for your item.
Knowing your item is a crucial part of successful selling on eBay. An item 
may be appraised or listed in a book for a high value, but what you care 
about is the price at which the item will actually sell. Imagine someone 
uncovering a hoard of your item and, not knowing the value of it, dumping 
it on eBay with low Buy It Now prices. This scenario would drive down the 
value of the item within a couple of weeks. Great for buyers — but not so 
great for sellers.
 
The best advice you can follow as you explore any free-market system is caveat 
emptor — let the buyer beware. Although you can’t guarantee that every one of 
your transactions will be perfect, if you research items thoroughly before you 
bid, you won’t lose too much of your hard-earned money — or too much sleep.
Researching Collectible Auctions
If you’re just starting out on eBay, chances are you like to shop and you also 
collect items that interest you. You’ll find out early in your eBay adventures 
that a lot of people online know as much about collecting as they do about 
bidding — and some are serious contenders.

Welcome to my version of grade school, with-
out the bad lunch. One of the keys to estab-
lishing value is knowing an item’s condition, 
typically referred to as an item’s grade. The 
following table lists the most common grading 
categories that collectors use. The information 
in this table is used with permission from (and 
appreciation to) Lee Bernstein.
Category (Also 
Known As)
What It Means
Example
Mint (M, Fine, 
Mint-In-Box [MIB], 
10)
A never-used collectible in 
perfect condition with com-
plete packaging (including 
instructions, original attach-
ments, tags, and so on) iden-
tical to how it appeared on 
the shelf in the original box.
Grandma got a soup 
tureen as a wedding 
present, never opened it, 
and stuck it in her closet 
for the next 50 years.
Near Mint (NM, 
Near Fine, Like-
New, 9)
The collectible is perfect but 
no longer has the original 
packaging or the original 
packaging is less than per-
fect. Possibly used but must 
appear to be new.
Grandma used the soup 
tureen on her 25th anni-
versary, washed it gently, 
and then put it back in the 
closet.
Excellent (EX, 8)
Used, but barely. Excellent 
is just a small step under 
Near Mint, and many sellers 
mistakenly interchange the 
two, but Excellent can have 
very minor signs of wear. 
The wear must be a normal, 
desirable part of aging or so 
minor that it’s barely notice-
able and visible only upon 
close inspection. Damage of 
any sort is not “very minor.” 
Wear or minor, normal fac-
tory flaws should be noted. 
(Factory flaws are small 
blemishes common at the 
time of manufacture — a tiny 
air bubble under paint, for 
example.)
Grandma liked to ring in 
the New Year with a cup 
of soup for everyone.

How can you compete? Well, in addition to having a well-planned bidding 
strategy (covered in Book I, Chapter 6), knowing your stuff gives you a win-
ning edge. I’ve gathered the opinions of two collecting experts to get the info 
you need about online collecting basics. I also show you how one of those 
experts puts the information into practice, and I give you a crash course on 
how items for sale are (or should be) graded.
 
The values of collectibles go up and down. Star Wars items are a perfect 
example. Values skyrocketed during the release of the latest movie, but then 
settled to a considerably lower level. A published book of value listings is 
valid only for the moment the book is written. If you stay on top of your 
market in a few specialties, you’ll be aware of these market fluctuations. If 
you’re looking for the highest price for Star Wars items, for example, instead 
of looking to liquidate excess inventory, I’d hold those items until the next 
film is released.
Grading is subjective. Mint to one person may 
be Very Good to another. Always ask a seller 
to define the meaning of the terms used. Also, 
be aware that many amateur sellers may not 
really know the different definitions of grading 
and may arbitrarily add Mint or Excellent to 
their item descriptions.
Category (Also 
Known As)
What It Means
Example
Very Good (VG, 7)
Looks very good but has 
defects, such as a minor 
chip or light color fading.
If you weren’t looking for 
it, you might miss that 
Grandma’s tureen sur-
vived the ’64 earthquake, 
as well as Uncle Bob’s 
infamous ladle episode.
Good (G, 6)
Used with defects. More 
than a small amount of color 
loss, chips, cracks, tears, 
dents, abrasions, missing 
parts, and so on.
Grandma had the ladies 
in the neighborhood over 
for soup and bingo every 
month.
Poor (P or G-, 5)
Barely collectible, if at all. 
Severe damage or heavy 
use. Beyond repair.
Grandma ran a soup 
kitchen.

Following Collectible-Buying Guidelines

Following Collectible-Buying Guidelines
Buying collectibles on eBay can be a unique market unto itself. But still, cer-
tain rules apply. Here are a few things to keep in mind when buying 
collectibles on eBay:
 
✦ Get all the facts before you put your money down. Study the descrip-
tion carefully and make your bidding decisions accordingly. Find out 
whether all original parts are included and whether the item has any 
flaws. If the description says that the Fred Flintstone figurine has a 
cracked back, e-mail the seller for more information.
 
✦ Don’t get caught up in the emotional thrill of bidding. First-time 
buyers (known as Under-10s or newbies because they have fewer than 
ten transactions under their belts) tend to bid wildly, using emotions 
instead of brains. If you’re new to eBay, you can get burned if you just 
bid for the thrill of victory without thinking about what you’re doing.
 
 I can’t stress how important it is to determine an item’s value before you 
bid. But because value is such a flighty thing (depending on supply and 
demand, market trends, and all sorts of other cool stuff), I recommend 
that you get a general idea of the item’s value and use this ballpark figure 
to set a maximum amount of money you’re willing to bid for that item. 
Then stick to your maximum and don’t even think about bidding past it. If 
the bidding gets too hot, there’s always another auction. To find out more 
about bidding strategies, Book I, Chapter 6 is just the ticket.
 
✦ Know what the item should cost. Buyers used to depend on price 
guides — books on collectibles and their values — to help them bid. But 
price guides are becoming a thing of the past. Sure, you can find a guide 
that says a Lion King Broadway poster in excellent condition has a book 
price of $75, but if you do a search on eBay, you’ll see that they’re 
actually selling for $20 to $30.
 
 When your search on eBay turns up what you’re looking for, average the 
completed prices that you find. Doing so gives you a much better idea 
than any price guide of what you need to spend.
 
✦ Timing is everything, and being first costs. In the movie-poster busi-
ness, if you can wait three to six months after a movie is released, you 
get the poster for 40 to 50 percent less. The same goes for many new 
releases of collectibles. Sometimes you’re wiser to wait and save money.
 
✦ Be careful of presale items. You may run across vendors selling items 
that they don’t have in stock at the moment but that they’ll ship to you 
later. For example, before the second Harry Potter film came out, some 
vendors ran auctions on movie posters they didn’t have yet. If you had 
bid and won, and for some reason the vendor had a problem getting the 
poster, you’d have been out of luck. Don’t bid on anything that can’t be 
delivered as soon as your payment clears.

✦ Being too late can also cost. Many collectibles become more difficult to 
find as time goes by. Generally, as scarcity increases, so does desirabil-
ity and value. Common sense tells you that if two original and identical 
collectibles are offered side by side, with one in like-new condition and 
the other in used condition, the like-new item will have the higher value.
 
✦ Check out the seller. Check the seller’s feedback rating (the number in 
parentheses next to the person’s user ID) before you buy. If the seller 
has many comments with very few negative ones, chances are good that 
this is a reputable seller.
 
 If you miss winning an auction and are offered a side deal, beware! Side 
deals off the eBay site are strictly prohibited. If you conduct a side deal 
and are reported to eBay, you can be suspended. Not only that, but 
buyers who are ripped off by sellers in away-from-eBay transactions 
shouldn’t look to eBay to bail them out. They’re on their own. Second-
chance offers, on the other hand, are eBay-legal — and safer.
Quizzing the seller
You should ask the seller certain questions when making a collectible pur-
chase. Assume that the object of your desire is a collectible GI Joe action 
figure from 1964 to 1969. In this section, I list some questions you should 
ask. The information here can give you an idea of what to ask when deter-
mining your maximum bid on other collectibles as well (or whether an item 
is even worth bidding on). As you imagine, the more you know before you 
place a bid, the happier you’re likely to be when you win.
This checklist can save you considerable hassle:
 
✦ Find out the item’s overall condition. For GI Joe, look at the painted 
hair and eyebrows. Expect some wear, but overall, a collectible worth 
bidding on should look good.
 
✦ Be sure the item’s working parts are indeed working. Most GI Joe 
action figures from this period have cracks on the legs and arms, but the 
joints should move and any cracks should not be so deep that the legs 
and arms fall apart easily.
 
✦ Ask whether the item has its original parts. Because you can’t really 
examine actual items in detail before buying, e-mail the seller with 
specific questions relating to original or replacement parts. Many GI 
Joe action figures are rebuilt from parts that are not from 1964 to 1969. 
Sometimes the figures even have two left or right hands or feet! If you 
make it clear to the seller before you buy that you want a toy with only 
original parts, you’ll be able to make a good case for a refund if the item 
arrives as rebuilt as the Six Million Dollar Man.

Following Collectible-Buying Guidelines

✦ Ask whether the item has original accessories. A GI Joe from 1964 to 
1969 should have his original dog tags, boots, and uniform. If any of 
these items are missing, you will have to pay around $25 to replace each 
missing item. If you’re looking to bid on any other collectible, know what 
accessories came as standard equipment with the item.
 
✦ Know an item’s value before you bid. A 1964 to 1969 vintage GI Joe in 
decent shape, with all its parts, sells for around $400 without its original 
box. If you are bidding on a GI Joe action figure and are in this price range, 
you’re okay. If you get the item for less than $350, congratulations — 
you’ve nabbed a bargain.
 
✦ If you have any questions, ask them before you bid. Check collectors’ 
guides, research similar auctions on eBay, and visit one of eBay’s cat-
egory chat rooms.
Hey, experts have been buying, selling, and trading collectible items for 
years. But just because you’re new to eBay doesn’t mean you have to be a 
newbie for decades before you can start bartering with the collecting gods. I 
wouldn’t leave you in the cold like that — and neither would eBay. You can 
get information on items you’re interested in, as well as good collecting tips, 
right on the eBay Web site. Visit the category-specific discussion boards in 
the Community area. You can also search the rest of the Web or go the old-
fashioned route and check the library.
 
Keep in mind that there truly are several prices for an item. The retail (or 
manufacturer’s suggested retail price — MSRP) price, the book value, the 
secondary market price (the price charged by resellers when an item is 
unavailable on the primary retail market), and the eBay selling price. The 
only way to ascertain the price an item will go for on eBay is to research 
completed auctions.
Useful publications
So what if your item isn’t for sale on eBay and hasn’t been for 14 days? 
What’s the first thing to do? Check out your local newsstand for one of the 
many publications devoted to collecting. Go over to Yahoo! Yellow Pages 
at yp.yahoo.com. Type your ZIP code to limit the search to your part of 
the country and type a search for newsstand and news stand. You can also 
search for Magazines — Dealers in your area. Let your fingers do the walking 
and call the newsstands in your area and ask whether they have publica-
tions in your area of interest. If no newsstands are listed in your area, visit 
the local bookstore.

Because you’re all so Internet-savvy (what’s better than getting the infor-

magazine Web sites that I mention in the preceding section. In this section, I 
give you a few more fun online sources where you might be able to get more 
insight about your items.
Web sites
Many Web sites devoted to different collectible areas list prices at recently 
completed auctions. These auctions are the best evaluation of an item’s 
value because they’re usually directed toward specialists in the collectible 
category. Most of the participants in these auctions really know their stuff.
You may have to poke around the following Web sites to find the prices 
realized at auction, but once you do, you’ll have the Holy Grail of estimated 
values. Look for links that point to auction archives. Many of these sites will 
consign an item from you as well, and sell it to their audience:

If you’re researching prices to buy a car on eBay, look in your local newspa-
per to get a good idea of prices in your community. You should also check 
out sites on the Internet. I’ve had many of my friends (and editors) visit the 
various sites, and we’ve settled on www.nadaguides.com because it seems 
to give the most accurate and unbiased information.
Online search engines
If you don’t find the information you need on eBay, don’t go ballistic — just 
go elsewhere. Even a site as vast as eBay doesn’t have a monopoly on infor-
mation. The Internet is filled with Web sites and Internet auction sites that 
can give you price comparisons and information about cyberclubs.
Your home computer can connect to powerful outside servers (really big 
computers on the Internet) that have their own fast-searching systems 
called search engines. Remember, if something is out there and you need it, 
you can find it right from your home PC in just a matter of seconds. Here are 
the addresses of some of the Web’s most highly regarded search engines or 
multi-search-engine sites:
 
✦ Google (www.google.com)
 
✦ MSN (www.msn.com)
 
✦ Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com)
The basic process of getting information from an Internet search engine is 
pretty simple:
 
1. Type the address of the search-engine site in the Address box of your 
Web browser.
 
 You’re taken to the Web site’s home page.
 
2. Find the text box next to the button labeled Search or something 
similar.

Online Sources of Information
194
 
3. In the text box, type a few words indicating what interests you.
 
 Be specific when typing search text. The more precise your entry, the 
better your chances of finding what you want. Look for tips, an 
advanced search option, or help pages on your search engine of choice 
for more information about how to narrow your search.
 
4. Click the Search (or similar) button or press Enter on your keyboard.
 
 The search engine presents you with a list of how many Internet pages 
have the requested information. The list includes brief descriptions and 
links to the first group of pages. You’ll find links to additional listings at 
the bottom if your search finds more listings than can fit on one page 
(and if you ask for something popular, like Harry Potter, don’t be sur-
prised to get millions of hits).
 
Always approach information on the Web with caution. Not everyone is the 
expert he or she would like to be. Your best bet is to get lots of differ ent 
opinions and then boil ’em down to what makes sense to you. And 
remember — caveat emptor. (Is there an echo in here?)
Online appraisals
I’ve had a bit of experience with online appraisals, which seem tempting at 
first glance. At second glance, though, I realized that unless the person doing 
the appraisal could actually see and feel the item, an accurate appraisal 
couldn’t be performed. Also, you have no guarantee that the person at the 
other end is really an expert in the field that relates to your item.
I had a few items e-appraised by a prestigious (and now defunct) online 
appraisal company, and the appraisals seemed a bit off. Then I took one 
item, a painting, to Butterfields (now Bonhams) in Los Angeles — and found 
that the value of the painting was ten times what my e-appraisal had said.
 
The bottom line here is that if you have an item of real value that’s worth 
appraising, it’s worth getting appraised in person. Most large cities have 
auction houses, and many of those auction houses have monthly consign-
ment clinics (a way for auction houses to get merchandise for their future 
auctions). If you bring an item to the auction house, you aren’t legally bound 
to have the auction house sell your item for you (but it may not be a bad 
idea). All you’ll get is a free verbal appraisal; the auction house won’t fill 
out any official paperwork or anything, but at least you’ll get an idea of what 
your item is worth. Real appraisals are expensive, performed by licensed 
professionals, and accompanied by a formal appraisal document.

Authentication services
Some companies provide the service of authenticating (verifying that it’s the 
real deal) or authenticating and grading (determining a value based on the 
item’s condition and legitimacy). To have these services performed on your 
items, you’ll have to send them to the service and pay a fee.
Following are a few excellent sites for grading coins:
 
✦ Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS): www.pcgs.com. PCGS is 
considered to be the top of the line in coin grading. This company’s stan-
dards are strict, but coins graded by PCGS usually sell for higher prices.
 
✦ American Numismatic Association Certification Service (AMNACS) — 
sold to Amos Press in 1990: www.anacs.com.
 
✦ Numismatic Guaranty Corporation of America (NGCA): www.ngccoin.
com/ebay_ngcvalue.cfm. The site offers eBay users a discount and 
features a mail-in grading and certification service for your coins.
 
✦ PCI Coin Grading Service (PCI): www.dominiongrading.com. PCI, the 
longstanding coin-grading service, was sold in early 2008. The new name 
is DGS, or Dominion Grading Service.
 
To catch up on the latest pricing on American coins, go to www.pcgs.com 
(Figure 2-2). This site has an elaborate online price guide for all coin grades.

Stamp collectors (or those who have just inherited a collection from Uncle 
Steve) can get their stamps “expertized” (authenticated) by the American 
Philatelic Society. Visit this site for more information:

For comic books, Comics Guaranty, LLC (CGC) at

will seal (enclose in plastic to preserve the quality) and grade at a discount 
for eBay users.
Sports cards and sports memorabilia have a bunch of authentication ser-
vices. If you got your autograph or memorabilia direct from the player or 
team, you can ensure its authenticity. Having the item authenticated may or 
may not get you a higher price at eBay. Try these sites:
 
✦ Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA): www.psacard.com.
 
✦ Online Authentics: www.onlineauthentics.com. Reviews autographs 
by scans online or by physical review.
The best way to find a good authenticator in your field is to search the 
items on eBay and see who is the most prominent authenticator listed in 
the descriptions. For example, in the coins area, coins from certain grading 
services get higher bids than those from other services. You can also go to 
an Internet search engine (such as Google or Yahoo!) and type the keywords 
coin grading (for coins). You’ll come up with a host of choices; use your 
good sense to see which one suits your needs.
 
Remember that not all items need to be officially authenticated. Official 
authentication does add value to the item, but if you’re an expert, you can 
comfortably rate an item on your own in your auctions. People will know 
from your description whether you’re a specialist. Your feedback will also 
work for you by letting the prospective bidder or buyer know that your mer-
chandise from past sales has been top-drawer.

✓ Brushing up on your writing skills
✓ Writing perfect e-mail messages
✓ Writing to the seller
B
usiness, bah! eBay’s supposed to be fun! But business is business and 
if you’re in business, you must remember that your customers are 
number one and customers deserve “five-star service.” Businesses become 
successful by providing fantastic customer service and selling quality mer-
chandise. You have to move in the same direction. The image that you proj-
ect through your e-mails and listings identifies you to bidders as a good guy 
or a bad guy. No kidding. Your e-mails should be polite and professional. 
Your listings shouldn’t make prospective buyers feel like you’re hustling 
them, sneaking in hidden fees, or being pushy with severe rules for bidding.
You don’t have to have the most beautiful auctions on eBay to succeed. 
Instead, you need products that sell — and you need to take the time to 
build good customer relations! This is what gives the little guy the advan-
tage over the mega-company that branches onto eBay. In this chapter, I 
cover some ways — from writing effective auction descriptions to sending 
cordial e-mails — to let your customers know that they’re number one in 
your book.
Communicating in Writing Takes a Little Effort
Perhaps English class wasn’t your favorite, but good grammar, proper spell-
ing, and punctuation in your communications portray you as a pro. Before 
writing this book, even I hooked up with some grammar and punctuation 
sites to brush up on my writing skills. (Okay, I also have brilliant editors 
covering up my transgressions. . . .)
Throughout the rest of this section, I provide some examples of effective 
e-mails. Study these and also check out a few business letter books, such as 
Writing Business Letters For Dummies by Sheryl Lindsell-Roberts (published 
by Wiley). And don’t forget good manners. You don’t want to be too formal, 
but you do want to be personable and polite.

Responding Appropriately to Initial Buyer Inquiries 
Responding Appropriately to Initial Buyer Inquiries 
The first written communication you might have with a prospective buyer 
is an inquiry e-mail. A bidder can ask you a question about your item by 
clicking the Ask the seller a question link on the auction or sale page, which 
generates an e-mail addressed to you, as shown in Figure 3-1. Often these 
questions are brief.
 
Figure 3-1: 
A question 
from an 
eBay 
member 
regarding 
one of my 
listings.
 
At least 20% of the time that I send an inquiry to a seller, I don’t get a 
response — guaranteeing that I won’t be buying that product. I refuse to buy 
from someone who doesn’t even care to respond to a question. When I do 
get responses, more often than not it’s a terse, brusquely written note. Many 
people choose not to use punctuation or capitalization in their e-mails. How 
professional-looking is that? Not very. Sellers who take the time to write a 
short, considerate reply that includes a greeting and a thank you for writing 
get my money.
You should respond quickly, clearly, and politely — and with a sales pitch 
whenever possible. Remind the soon-to-be bidder that you can combine sev-
eral wins to save on shipping costs. And by all means, use this opportunity 
to point out other auctions you have that may also interest the writer. (Now 
that’s customer service.)

Responding Appropriately to Initial Buyer Inquiries 
Replying online or personally
When a prospective buyer or bidder has a question, you will know about it 
in two ways: through e-mail and as a clickable link on your My eBay page. 
You’ll get the e-mail from eBay alerting you that a question has been asked. 
Using this service goes a long way to protect your privacy. In the past, your 
only option was to respond through your regular e-mail, thereby revealing 
your e-mail address to a stranger.
Now you can click the Respond Now button in the e-mail and go directly to 
the online question to post your response, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
Figure 3-2: 
Answering 
a question 
through 
eBay.
 
Type your answer and indicate whether you want the reply posted on the 
page for other prospective customers to see. You can also indicate that your 
personal e-mail address should be withheld from your reply mailed to the 
questioner from eBay’s mail server. If you’re in a hurry and need to make a 
short, factual reply, this is an excellent option — but it doesn’t give you the 
punch that a personal e-mail can.
You can also go directly to the item page, where you’ll see the notice that 
you have a question to answer (see Figure 3-3). Click the link and you’ll be 
brought to the page where you can respond to the question (the same page 
the e-mail links to).

know that

If you’ve responded to a question and indicated that you want it posted on 
the item page, the response to your question will appear at the bottom of 
your description, as shown in Figure 3-4.

Making your response friendly, 
helpful, and productive
When answering a question, a brief and straightforward response is good. 
For example, I wrote the following note in response to a question regarding 
the condition of the Christmas tree in one of my auctions:
Hello,
Yes, the aluminum Christmas tree in my auction is in excellent condition. The 
58 branches are full and lush and will look great for the holidays. Please write 
again if you have any more questions or concerns.

Don’t forget to check my other auctions for a color wheel and a revolving tree

Isn’t that nice? The note addresses the question in a respectful and personable 
manner. Writing a note like this doesn’t take long. You should be doing it.
 
Putting your eBay store URL in your signature is a great way to get new cus-
tomers to view your other merchandise.
Personalizing the Buyer’s Notification 
Have you ever received a bulk-generated, boilerplate buyer’s confirmation 
letter? The seller hasn’t bothered to fill in half the blanks, and you’re almost 
insulted just by having to read it? Receiving a note like this after you’ve 
requested that the seller combine purchases (and the letter pays no atten-
tion to your request) is especially annoying. E-mails can cross, but a per-
sonal approach goes a long way with customers.
 
I’m not saying you shouldn’t automate your eBay business. I’m merely sug-
gesting — strongly recommending — that you take the time to personalize 
even your canned e-mail responses. If you decide to send automated 
responses, choose a program (such as eBay’s Selling Manager, described in 
Chapter 5) that allows you to customize your e-mail, combine multiple wins, 
and apply the correct shipping costs the first time.
When you sell an item, you receive a notification from eBay, as shown in 
Figure 3-5. When you get this e-mail, simply click on the yellow, Send an 
Invoice button to send an invoice to your buyer. Here are some ideas to keep 
your communications safe, efficient, and professional:
 
✦ Send the invoice from your My eBay page: For security’s sake, go 
directly to your My eBay page, find the sale, and send the invoice from 
there. That way, you won’t accidently be fooled into clicking a link in a 
phishing e-mail (a message that’s not from eBay and is designed merely 
to steal your user ID).
 
✦ Combine purchases when you can: If the buyer has purchased more 
than one item from you, you’ll see a note from eBay indicating such. Be 
sure to click to combine purchases so you can combine shipping and get 
your payment quickly.

202
Personalizing the Buyer’s Notification 
 
Figure 3-5:

e-mail to the

sale.
 
 
✦ Include special offers: At the end of a buyer’s notice letter, offer your 
buyer some special discounts or other offers from your eBay Store. 
Include a few items this particular winner may be interested in (based 
on the current win) and include a link to your site. Also include the 
reminder that you can combine postage — and that you look forward to 
a response.
 
If you want to send the invoice from your My eBay page, just click the Send 
Invoice option from the drop-down menu in the Items I’ve Sold area, verify 
all the information, and click Send Invoice. If you select the Copy Me check 
box on this invoice, you receive a copy. The buyer’s copy has a link, 
enabling the buyer to pay directly through PayPal. Figure 3-6 shows what the 
invoice e-mail looks like.

Keeping the Good E-Mails Going
Keeping the Good E-Mails Going
If you’ve got a good transaction going (and the majority of them are good), 
the buyer will either pay immediately through PayPal or reply to your e-mail 
within three business days. (Most replies come the next day.) If your buyer 
has questions regarding anything in your invoice, you’ll get those inquiries 
now. Most of the time, all you get back is, “Thanks. I’ll pay as soon as I can.” 
Hey, that’s good enough for me.
If any last-minute details need to be worked out, usually the buyer asks to 
set up a time to call or requests further instructions about the transaction. 
Respond to this communication as soon as possible. If you can’t deal with it 
at the moment, let the buyer know you’re working on it and will shoot those 
answers back ASAP. Never let an e-mail go unanswered.
 
When you list an item on eBay, you have the option of indicating that you 
will accept Skype Chat or IM. So be sure you set up a free Skype account at 
www.skype.com. You can use this account as a free way to contact your 
buyer through the Skype system — using your computer’s speakers and 
microphone.
As soon as you get the hang of sending e-mail, you can add an eBay link that 
takes the buyer right to the Feedback Forum with just a click of the mouse. 
Buyers and sellers can also get to the Feedback Forum from the final listing 
page by clicking the Leave Feedback link.
The payment reminder
Writing a payment reminder can get sticky. You don’t want to aggravate the 
buyer, but time is wasting and you could spend this time reposting your 
item. When writing a payment reminder, you need to be firm but pleasant. 
Real things can happen in people’s lives. Family members get sick, people 
just plain forget, or your buyer has suffered a computer problem. (That sort 
of thing happens. Okay, it was also my excuse when I forgot to send a 
payment — feel free to use it.)
When you honestly forget to send a payment, nothing is more humiliating 
than someone debasing you through e-mail. So remember that people do 
make mistakes, and check the winner’s feedback before you send the letter. 
If you can garner from the feedback that this winner has a habit of not fol-
lowing through on bids, you can definitely be a bit firmer in your wording.
Always set a clear deadline for receiving payment, as shown in the following 
letter:

204
Keeping the Good E-Mails Going
Hello,
You won an auction of mine on eBay last week for the Emilio Pucci book. 
Your payment still has not shown up in my PayPal account. Perhaps sending 
payment has slipped your mind considering your busy schedule. I know it can 
easily happen.
Please e-mail back within 48 hours and let me know whether you want to go 
through with our transaction. I’d like to put the item back up for sale if you 
don’t want it.
Thank you for your bid,
Marsha Collier
 
How firm you choose to get with a nonpaying bidder is up to you. I’ve dealt 
with a few nonpaying bidders on eBay. Some people who tend to overbid are 
indeed violating the contract to buy, but legitimate reasons might explain 
why someone hasn’t followed through on an auction. You must decide which 
method to take — and how far you want to stretch your karma (what goes 
around comes around). Assess each case individually, and don’t go postal 
until you know the whole story.
The payment received and shipping notice
I know that you probably aren’t going to send out a payment received letter 
for every transaction, especially when they’re paid through PayPal. But it 
would surely be nice if you did. Staying in constant communication with 
your buyers will make them feel more secure with you and with buying on 
eBay. You want them to come back, don’t you?
When you receive payment and are ready to ship, sending a short note like 
the following (again — eBay makes this easy with Selling Manager Pro) helps 
to instill loyalty in your customer:
Hi there, (insert name of winner),
Your payment was received and your item will ship tomorrow. Please e-mail 
me when it arrives so that I can hear how pleased you are with your purchase.
When the transaction is over, I hope you will leave five-star, positive feedback 
for me because building a good reputation on eBay is very important. I’d really 
appreciate it, and I’ll be glad to do the same for you.
Thank you for bidding & winning,
Marsha Collier

Communicating from the Buyer’s Perspective
 
Say thank you — I mean it! What do all the successful big-name department 
stores have in common? Yes, great prices, good merchandise, and nice dis-
plays. But with all things being equal, customer service always wins, hands 
down. One department store in the United States, Nordstrom, has such a 
great reputation that the store happily took back a set of snow tires because 
a customer wasn’t happy with them. No big deal, maybe — until you notice 
that Nordstrom doesn’t even sell snow tires!
The “Your item is on the way” e-mail
You can always send the automatic e-mail from your shipper announcing 
the shipment tracking number. I prefer sending the e-mail from PayPal (see 
Chapter 4) by inserting the tracking number into the PayPal payment record. 
This way you cover two bases: Your buyer is notified of shipping, and PayPal 
has the record that you’ve shipped an item.
These e-mails aren’t very personalized (although you can personalize them 
somewhat), so I follow up through eBay’s Selling Manager Pro program, with 
another, more personal note:
Subject: Your book is on the way!
Hi, (insert buyer’s name)!
You will be receiving another e-mail from PayPal with the package’s delivery 
confirmation number and information on the mode of shipment.
Thank you for buying my item. If there is any question when the package 
arrives, PLEASE e-mail me immediately. Your satisfaction is my goal, and I’m 
sure any problem can be easily taken care of. Please let me know when the 
package arrives so that we can exchange some very positive feedback!

Communicating from the Buyer’s Perspective
Top-notch sellers know that communication is the key to a successful trans-
action, and they do everything they can to set a positive tone for the entire 
process with speedy and courteous e-mails.
A good e-mail (or invoice) from a professional eBay seller should include the 
following information:
 
✦ Confirmation of the winning price

206
Communicating from the Buyer’s Perspective
 
✦ The address for sending payment or a phone number for credit card 
processing
 
✦ A review of the shipping options and price 
 
✦ Confirmation of escrow (if offered in the auction)
 
✦ The timeframe in which the item will be shipped
When you read the seller’s invoice, be sure to compare the terms the seller 
laid out in his or her e-mail with those on the auction page. If you see sig-
nificant differences, address them immediately with the seller — before you 
proceed with the transaction. Unless you’re paying immediately through 
PayPal, when you e-mail the seller a reply, you should do the following:
 
✦ Let the seller know when you intend to make your payment.
 
✦ Include your address, name, and user ID.
 
✦ Include the item’s title and number so the seller knows what you’re 
referring to and can get your item ready to ship as soon as the payment 
arrives.
 
✦ Include your phone number if you plan to pay with a credit card on 
a secure Web page. If there’s a problem with the credit-card number 
you’ve given, the seller can contact you promptly to let you know.
 
✦ Request that the seller e-mail you any shipping information, such as 
tracking numbers and an approximate arrival date.

n the early days of eBay, online auctions were a scary place. You could 
send a check to your trading partner, but the wait for the product could 
be interminable. There was little feedback in the beginning, so you couldn’t 
separate the good sellers from the bad. The most widely accepted form of 
payment was the money order. Somehow, in our small (but growing) com-
munity, we weren’t afraid to send money orders to strangers. Heck, some 
sellers even shipped merchandise before they received payment! Things 
were a lot simpler, if riskier, in the old days.
Then, rising like a beacon on the horizon, came x.com. A bright man named 
Elon came up with the concept of e-mailing money; you could even beam 
cash to someone’s Palm Pilot! There was no charge for using this service, 
which was even more amazing! The best part about signing up for the pro-
gram was that they gave you a $10 credit just to join. You also received a 
$10 bonus for each friend you got to join. (The maximum any user could get 
in bonuses was $1000, but hey, that’s no small change!)
With numbers like that, the early eBay (née AuctionWeb) crowd signed up 
quickly. x.com quickly became the most widely used service on the Internet, 
the first mover-and-shaker in online, person-to-person payments.
eBay countered, acquiring Billpoint in the spring of 1999 in the hopes of 
launching their own payment service in a partnership with Wells Fargo. In a 
disaster of bad timing, the service was not available to eBay members until 
the second quarter of 2000. Meanwhile, x.com — now reborn as PayPal — 
was growing by leaps and bounds and quietly taking over the market.

208
Understanding How PayPal Works
PayPal went public in February of 2002 to an encouraging Wall Street. The 
feud between PayPal and Billpoint heated up. The number of customers 
who signed up with Billpoint couldn’t keep pace with the numbers joining 
PayPal. PayPal posted a profit, while Billpoint was losing millions per year. 
In October 2002, eBay bit the bullet and acquired PayPal in a deal valued at 
$1.5 billion. Billpoint was then simply phased out of the site.
If you’ve read any of my other books, you know that I’ve been a huge fan of 
PayPal from the beginning. PayPal is one of the safest and least expensive 
ways for a vendor to accept money over the Internet. For a small retailer, 
PayPal fees can be much more cost-effective than a credit-card merchant 
account (as I explain in the next section).
Understanding How PayPal Works
Joining PayPal is just the beginning. No, they don’t give $10 bonuses for 
signups anymore, but the benefits far outweigh any fees they charge to 
sellers. Also, there’s no charge to send money to anyone. As of this writing, 
small sellers can still accept money from eBay sales and not incur any fees.
 
Before planning on a free ride from PayPal, double-check the PayPal Web 
site, www.PayPal.com, for any changes in fees and policies.
 
You may register up to eight e-mail addresses with a PayPal account. 
However, you may not register an e-mail address that is already registered 
with another PayPal account.
Sending money through PayPal
You have several ways to fund the money you send to another party through 
PayPal:
 
✦ Instant transfer: Sending money this way means the money is immedi-
ately credited to the recipient’s account. That person can then transfer 
the money to his or her personal bank account without delay. If you 
want to send a transfer, you must have a credit or debit card registered 
with PayPal as a backup for your funds — just in case your bank denies 
the transfer. It’s just like writing a secure check — without exposing any 
of your personal information (such as your checking-account number) 
to another party.
 
✦ eCheck: Sending an eCheck isn’t as “instant” as an instant transfer. Just 
like writing a check from your checking account, it can take up to four 
days for the eCheck to clear. You do not need a backup source of funds 
when you use eCheck.

Book II
Chapter 4
Simplifying Payment 
with PayPal
209
Understanding How PayPal Works
 
✦ PayPal balance: If someone sent you money through PayPal or you’ve 
sold something on eBay (and your buyer has paid you through PayPal), 
you have a balance in your PayPal account. This balance is first applied 
to any purchases you’ve made. Then when your account has no balance, 
you can choose to pay by credit card. It’s simplest to keep your books 
balanced if you withdraw any PayPal balance to your business checking 
account before you make a purchase.
 
✦ Credit card: Charge it! Putting your PayPal purchases on a credit card is 
a good idea. Not only are you protected by PayPal, but your credit-card 
company also backs you up in case of fraud.
 
You can register multiple credit cards on your PayPal account and select a 
different one for different types of purchases. That way, you can place per-
sonal purchases on one account and business purchases on another. It 
makes end-of-year bookkeeping a lot easier!
Figuring out payment types
PayPal breaks types of payments into categories based on what you’re 
paying for. You can pay for almost anything in the world on the PayPal 
system (as long as the recipient has an e-mail address). A few things that 
you can’t pay for with PayPal include anything related to gambling, adult 
content or services, multi-level marketing, and buying, or selling prescrip-
tion drugs from noncertified sellers. I recommend if you’re planning to 
accept payments for something that may be a tad questionable, visit the 
PayPal help area to be sure your item is currently in the clear.
After you sign into your PayPal account, you can send money through 
PayPal in the following ways:
 
✦ Paying for eBay items: When you pay for an eBay item, you’re taken to 
a page where you can input the item number and your eBay user ID, so 
the payment will integrate directly with eBay’s user records.
 
✦ Goods (other): From this area, you can send money to anyone in the 
world for goods purchased anywhere other than in an online auction.
 
✦ Service/Other: You can send payment for a service performed for you 
or your business, such as Web design, bookkeeping, psychic readings, 
or whatever.
 
✦ Cash Advance: Use this when you need to send money to your kid in 
college or pay back your roommate for saving you from great embar-
rassment when you left your wallet at home on a double date.
 
When you’re using the cash-advance feature, consider using a payment 
method other than credit card to avoid possible credit-card fees for a cash 
advance.

PayPal’s Protection Plans
PayPal’s Protection Plans
Safety: Isn’t that what paying for things online is all about? Safety for the 
buyer and safety for the seller are primary concerns in the minds of those 
dealing on eBay. PayPal has created protection policies for both parties.
PayPal buyer protection
As a buyer who pays for eBay items through PayPal, you can be covered 
against fraud for up to at least $200. Many sellers (check the seller’s informa-
tion on the item page) qualify by PayPal to give up to $2,000 worth of buyer 
protection. You have to be sure that the seller’s item has the correct stand-
ing with PayPal (as shown in Figure 4-1) in the Buy Safely box to get this 
buyer protection.
 
Figure 4-1: 
The amount 
of PayPal 
Buyer 
Protection 
can vary 
from seller 
to seller.
 
In this protection program, fraud is loosely defined as nondelivery of items 
or when you receive an item that’s significantly different from the way it was 
described. Sorry — this doesn’t cover you when you’re merely disappointed 
with an item when you open the box. Oh yes, remember that it also won’t 
cover downloadable software or digital items — even if you buy them on eBay. 
When you’re browsing eBay, notice that some listings have the PayPal icon, 
and some have no icon. When a listing has a PayPal icon, the seller accepts 
PayPal as payment, and you’re covered under PayPal buyer protection. 
Figure 4-2 shows a detail of eBay listings with the PayPal icon displayed.
 
Even if PayPal’s buyer protection doesn’t cover your item, PayPal still has 
basic coverage for all transactions if you’ve been defrauded. The PayPal 
protection shield in the Seller’s information box (or in the listing) merely 
tells you that the seller maintains a level of professionalism and safety in his 
or her sales.

PayPal’s Protection Plans
 
Figure 4-2: 
Some eBay

Following are a few rules for using the buyer-protection system and making 
claims:
 
✦ Number of claims: You may make only one claim per PayPal payment. 
 
✦ Timing: Your claim must be made within 45 days of your PayPal payment.
 
✦ Participation: You must be ready and willing to provide information and 
documentation to PayPal’s buyer-protection team during the claims 
process.
When you provide protection for your buyers, you show that you’re a 
professional — and you make it more comfortable for them to purchase 
from you. For sellers to qualify to offer buyer protection in their listings, 
they must
 
✦ Have a minimum of 50 or more eBay feedback comments
 
✦ Have at least 98% positive eBay feedback
 
✦ Use a Verified Premier or Verified Business Account PayPal account to 
accept payments
 
✦ Have a U.S. or Canadian PayPal account
 
✦ Select PayPal as a payment option when listing an item on eBay
 
✦ Have a PayPal account in good standing
For eBay’s International sites, PayPal has different limits. See the Table 4-1

PayPal seller protection
Don’t think that sellers get left out of this protection thing. You do have 
some protection against unwarranted claims made on your eBay sales; it’s 
called (logically enough) seller protection.
To see whether your transaction is covered under seller protection, follow 
these steps:
 
1. In your payment received e-mail from PayPal, click the View the 
Details of the Transaction link.
 
2. Sign into your PayPal account.
 
3. Scroll down the Transaction Details page to the buyer’s shipping 
address.
 
 You’ll see whether the shipping address is confirmed. (PayPal confirms 
the address by making sure that the credit card billing address matches 
the shipping address.) If it is, you must ship to that address to be pro-
tected.
When your transaction is protected, should any fraud be involved (a stolen 
credit card or identity hoax), you will not lose the money. PayPal guarantees 
the transaction.

PayPal’s Protection Plans
 
PowerSeller benefit! As an eBay seller, you are eligible for expanded seller 
protection. Items sold by PowerSellers on eBay and paid for with PayPal will 
be covered against claims, charge backs, reversals for unauthorized pay-
ments, and merchandise not received. Expanded Protection is free to sellers 
and eliminates the need for confirmed addresses. 
 
If you receive a PayPal payment that ships to an unconfirmed address, drop 
the buyer a note and ask about the address. Usually you’ll get a reply that 
makes you feel comfortable, and you’ll ship. Remember that you will not be 
covered under seller protection if you ship to an unconfirmed address.
Surprise! There are a few other rules and restrictions. For sellers to be 
protected, they must
 
✦ Have a verified Business or Premier account: You must have an 
upper-level PayPal account to be covered.
 
✦ Ship to a confirmed address: You must ship to the buyer’s address 
exactly as displayed on the transaction details page.
 
✦ Ship within seven days: The item must leave your place of business 
within seven days of receiving payment. In the case of a pre-sale or 
customized item, you must post delivery time in your listing.
 
✦ Accept single payment from a single account: You must have accepted 
one payment from one PayPal account to pay for the purchase. (No 
multiple-account payments for an item.)
 
✦ Ship tangible goods: Seller protection is not available for services, 
digital goods, and other electronically delivered items. 
Being PayPal-verified is an important rating for 
both seller and buyer. It means that someone 
has checked and you really are who you say 
you are. Becoming verified isn’t a big deal. 
All you have to do is register your checking 
account with PayPal. (Remember when you 
opened an account at the bank? They got 
information about you to be sure you were you, 
didn’t they?)
PayPal will make two teeny (less than $1) 
deposits into your checking account. After 
these have been transferred to your account, 
you can log back in to your PayPal account and 
confirm the two amounts. That’s it — and you 
get free pennies too!
If you live outside the United States, you 
become verified by adding a credit card to your 
account and enrolling in the Expanded Use 
program, which is a similar confirmation 
scheme.
What’s this PayPal-verified business all about?

214
Sorting Out PayPal’s Accounts
 
✦ Provide proof of shipping: You need to provide reasonable proof-of-
shipment that can be tracked online. The transaction details page must 
show that you shipped to the buyer’s address. A delivery confirmation 
suffices for items valued up to $250. 
 
 If you use an automated shipping solution such as endicia.com, you also 
just copy and paste the delivery confirmation numbers onto the PayPal 
page. PayPal will send an e-mail to the buyer with the information for 
their records.
 
 For items worth $250.00 or more (£150.00 or more for the U.K.), you 
must have a signature from the recipient as proof of receipt.
 
✦ Not impose surcharges: Imposing a surcharge on the buyer is against 
eBay policy anyway.
 
✦ Cooperate with the complaint investigation: If a complaint is filed, you 
must provide complete information about the transaction within seven 
days of a request from PayPal.
 
 If PayPal is required by the buyer’s issuing credit-card company to 
respond immediately to resolve a chargeback situation, you must pro-
vide all information within three days.
At this writing, seller protection is available only for U.S. and Canadian sell-
ers transacting with U.S. buyers, and for U.K. sellers transacting with U.K. or 
U.S. buyers. Check back with the PayPal site for any changes in this policy.
Sorting Out PayPal’s Accounts
PayPal has three types of accounts to accommodate everyone from the casual 
seller to the professional business: Personal, Business, and Premier accounts.
PayPal Personal account
When you begin your career with PayPal, you may want to sign up for 
a Personal account. With this basic account from PayPal, you can send 
and receive money (non-credit-card payments) for free. PayPal Personal 
accounts are for only one person and not for a business. (You can’t have a 
joint Personal account, either.)
Business and Premier accounts
The PayPal professional seller (business and premier) accounts allow you 
to accept credit card payments, get a debit card, and participate in PayPal’s 
high-yield money market fund. A premier account is held in an individual’s 
name (although it may still be for a business); a business account can be 
held in a business name and allows multiple login names. At these account 
levels, you have access to a customer service phone number.

Book II
Chapter 4

Extracting Your Payment History from PayPal
A fee is levied on all money you receive through PayPal at this level, but the 
costs are reasonable. (Just ask anyone with a brick-and-mortar business that 
accepts credit cards.) PayPal has a standard rate and a merchant rate, as shown 
in Table 4-2. The merchant rate has three tiers, based on your monthly sales 
volume. When you open your account, you’re charged the standard rate. After 
your sales grow and you’ve been receiving more than $3000 per month through 
PayPal for three consecutive months, you can apply for a merchant account.

rate.
Extracting Your Payment History from PayPal
I’ve been running a home-based business since the mid-1980s. Because I came 
from a corporate background working in the newspaper business, I’ve always 
known that recordkeeping is important. But recordkeeping has always been 
the bane of my existence. When I began my home-based business, the first 
thing I did was to hire a lawyer and a CPA to teach me what I had to do.

216
Deciding What Info You Need from PayPal
Recordkeeping means keeping track of everything: Every penny, sou, farthing, 
or ruble that you spend or take in. In the United States (and in most other 
countries), we have a little thing called taxes. We all have to turn in tax returns 
of several sorts when we run a business — and they’d better be correct. There 
may come a day when you receive a letter from a State or Federal tax agency 
asking to take a look at your books. This is simply a nice way of saying the 
dreaded word, audit.
 
The best defense against an audit is to have backup records. The more records 
you have proving your business income and expenses, the less painful your 
audit will be. One excellent piece of information to have at your fingertips is 
your PayPal history.
Besides meeting tax-reporting requirements, keeping good records keeps 
you on top of your business dealings. (See Book IX for more about how good 
recordkeeping helps your business succeed.) PayPal helps you with this 
all-important recordkeeping by providing reports on your buying and selling 
activity with these features:
 
✦ 24/7 availability: PayPal allows you to customize and download your 
transaction reports at any time. You might want to consider downloading 
your reports on a monthly or quarterly basis — as well as generating 
one big report at the end of the year. 
 
 Or you may want to download the reports to coincide with your state 
sales-tax payments (for backup documentation) or to keep a record of 
your monthly totals.
 
✦ Various formats: You can download reports in several formats. The 
most flexible is a comma-delimited file that you can open and edit in a 
spreadsheet program, such as Excel or Microsoft Works.
Deciding What Info You Need from PayPal
PayPal is great when it comes to giving you control over your reports. You 
can narrow your downloads to incoming transactions for a one-day period 
or see all transactions for the year or more!
You may need all the information that PayPal gives you. If that’s what you 
want, great. But PayPal can give you information overkill. I go over some of 
the options here so you can decide which types of information are important 
to keep in your permanent record.
All your downloadable PayPal reports can contain the following informa-
tion by default. When you actually go to download, you can pick and choose 
what data you really need to have on hand:

Book II
Chapter 4
Simplifying Payment 
with PayPal
217
Deciding What Info You Need from PayPal
 
✦ Date: The date each PayPal transaction occurred.
 
✦ Time: The time the payment was made.
 
✦ Time zone: The time zone used for recording transactions in your 
PayPal account.
 
✦ Name: The name of the person to whom you sent money or from whom 
you received money.
 
✦ Type: The type of transaction that occurred: deposit, withdrawal, ATM 
withdrawal, payment sent, payment received, and so on.
 
✦ Status: The status of the transaction (cleared, completed, denied, and so 
on) at the time you download the file.
 
✦ Gross: The gross amount involved in the transaction (before any fees 
are deducted).
 
✦ Fee: Any PayPal fees charged to the transaction.
 
✦ Net: The net dollar amount of the transaction. This is the total received, 
less any PayPal fees.
 
✦ From e-mail: The e-mail address of the sender.
 
✦ To e-mail: The e-mail address of the recipient.
 
 If you use different e-mail addresses to classify different types of sales, 
this can be a good sorting point for your reports. For example, I receive 
payments for my personal auctions to one e-mail address, and payments 
for my business to another.
 
✦ Item ID: That strange combination of letters and numbers that PayPal 
assigns to each transaction. Decide whether this is important for your 
records. (I don’t use it.)
 
✦ Item title: The title of the auction related to the transaction.
 
✦ Shipping amount: The amount the buyer paid for shipping. It’s a good 
idea to use this field because it helps you separate merchandise revenue 
from shipping revenue.
 
✦ Auction site: If you’re collecting money from other auction sites through 
PayPal, you might want to include this link so that you can sort your 
sales by auction site.
 
✦ Item URL: The Internet address of the auction or transaction. (For eBay, 
the URLs are on the site for up to 90 days — here you can go back a 
year.)
 
✦ Closing date: The date the transaction closed. The record will always 
contain the date the payment posted to your PayPal account, whether 
you indicate a closing date here or not.

218
Downloading and Customizing Your Reports
 
✦ Shipping address: The address to which the item was shipped.
 
✦ Counter party status (verified versus unverified): A record of whether 
your buyer was PayPal verified.
 
✦ Address status (confirmed versus unconfirmed): Shows whether the 
address you shipped to was confirmed.
 
✦ Sales tax: Information about sales tax you collected.
Customizing and Downloading Your Reports
To get your reports from PayPal, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to www.PayPal.com and log in to your account with your e-mail 
address and password.
 
 After you’re logged in, the top of your page displays various tabs, as 
shown in Figure 4-3.
 
Figure 4-3: 
The PayPal 
navigation 
bar.
 
 
2. Click the My Account tab.
 
3. Mouse over the History item on the navigation bar and click 
Download History on the resulting drop-down menu.
 
 You land on the Download History page. Before you start clicking any-
thing, consider customizing your reports.
 
4. Scroll down the page to indicate your level of customization.
 
 You can customize the fields you require in your download through the 
links at the right.
 
5. Select the fields you want to include by putting a check mark in the 
box next to the desired data.
 
 For details on the different options, see the list before this set of steps.
 
6. Click Save.
 
 You’re returned to the Download History page, as shown in Figure 4-4. 
Your customization is saved for future report downloads.

 If you’re a seller in the U.K., your page will look slightly different than 
the one pictured. Your dates will be in the format of DD/MM/YY.
 
7. Type the dates that you want to span in the downloaded report.
 
8. Select a format for your download from the following:
 
• Comma-delimited file: This type of file downloads with the .csv 
extension. You can open a comma-delimited file easily in Microsoft 
Excel or Microsoft Works, using the All Files option, as shown in 
Figure 4-5. (Microsoft Works doesn’t have a direct .csv importer, 
but the file will open with the All Files *.* command.)

Downloading and Customizing Your Reports
 
• Tab-delimited file: This file downloads with the .txt extension. 
It can be opened not only in a spreadsheet program but also as a 
text file in Windows Notepad or a word processing program such as 
Microsoft Word for Windows.
 
• Quicken or QuickBooks file: These files download in the native 
format, ready to import into these Intuit bookkeeping programs. Just 
remember: After these files are imported, they’re in there for good.
 
 Saving these files for spreadsheet use does not limit you in the future as 
to what version of which program will open what. The .txt and .csv 
files are universal files that can be opened on any PC with basic spread-
sheet capabilities.
 
 By opting for a spreadsheet file as your record of customers, you’re not 
bogging down a bookkeeping program with hundreds and eventually 
thousands of records of one-time buyers. Even a robust program like 
QuickBooks will max out at around 14,000 customers!
 
9. Click the Download History button.
 
 If you’ve asked for a long timeframe (such as a year), go make yourself a 
cup of joe. When you come back, your file will be ready to download.
Saving and Editing Your Reports
When your computer is ready to receive the downloaded file (which may 
take a while — especially if you have a dial-up connection), a window like 
the one shown in Figure 4-6 pops up.

Downloading and Customizing Your Reports
Click the Save button to save the file to a folder on your computer. In the 
next screen, select the folder where you want to save the file. 
 
I recommend setting up a folder that contains only Internet and eBay 
sales files.
After the file is saved, you can open it. Figure 4-7 shows a downloaded 
history file opened in Microsoft Works. In this format, you can re-sort the 
columns, total the sales, and delete unnecessary columns.
 
Figure 4-7: 
The 
downloaded

This file is now part of your eBay business archive, should the day come that 
you need to produce it. Be sure to back it up, just in case.
 
Some CPAs recommend that you keep these files for up to seven years. To 
be safe, check with your own tax professional, who understands the needs of 
your particular tax situation.

e
Bay offers you an amazing variety of tools. Because the site is con-
stantly changing, few of us know where all these tools are and how to 
use them. It’s always an eye-opener when I poke around the site and find a 
new cool tool or neat shortcut.
Aside from the tools I tell you about in this chapter, the most important 
shortcut I can give you is to remind you to sign in and select the box that 
says “Keep me signed in on this computer unless I sign out” before you 
attempt to do anything on eBay. This will permit you to do all your business 
on eBay without being bugged for your password at every turn.
 
Your computer holds your sign-in information for an entire day (unless you 
sign out). If you have more than one user ID or share a computer with other 
people, be sure to sign out when you’re finished. For your protection, you 
still have to type your password for actions involving financial or personal 
information. To specify the tasks for which you want eBay to remember your 
sign-in information, go to the eBay Preferences area of the My eBay page.
 
Although I love (and use) eBay’s management tools, many solid third-party 
services and tools are available. Book VIII clues you in on some of my favorites.

Signing In to Get Going
Signing In to Get Going
Before you do almost anything on eBay, it’s best to sign in. What would be 
more of a disaster than to find an item you want, at the price you’d love 
to pay, with only two minutes to go — and not be signed in? You must be 
signed in to bid, sell, or buy, so do it!
 
1. Click the Sign In link at the top of any eBay page.
 
 (If you’re already signed in, the link will read Sign Out.) You’re sent to 
the Sign In page.
 
2. Type your user ID and password, as shown in Figure 5-1.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Signed in 
and ready to

 Type your registered eBay user ID, not your e-mail address. Your user ID 
and e-mail address are no longer interchangeable on the site.
 
 If you ever forget your eBay password, you can click the Having prob-
lems with signing in? Link or go to the following:
http://cgi4.ebay.com/ws1/eBayISAPI.
dll?ForgotYourPasswordShow
 
 If you remember the answer to the question you were asked during the 
eBay registration process, you can create a new password immediately.
 
3. Click the Sign In button.
 
 You’re now signed in and ready to do almost anything on eBay! You are 
brought to your My eBay Summary page.

Taking Advantage of My eBay
The number one tool available at no cost to every eBay user is the My eBay 
page. This area of the site is unmatched for its organizational ability in help-
ing you with your buying and selling activities. After you’ve registered on the 
site, you have a My eBay page automatically, so let’s delve into exactly what 
it can do for you.
I call My eBay a page, but it’s really an area — a group of several pages held 
together with links. The My eBay area gives you complete control of every-
thing you are doing (or would like to do) on eBay.
 
You have to sign in to the site before you can use the My eBay area. To get 
to your My eBay page, click the My eBay link on the eBay navigation bar, 
which is at the top of every eBay page.
My eBay is divided into six areas: My Summary, All Buying, All Selling, My 
Messages, All Favorites, and My Account, as described in Table 5-1. You can 
visit each area by clicking links in the My eBay Views box, on the left side of 
the page. The top link of each My eBay area presents you with a summary 
of the activity in that area. The links below the top link take you to specific 
data, without having to scroll through a long page.

the feedback you’ve left and received, and an area where you can 
respond to feedback; and finally, preferences you can specify so 
that eBay performs just as you want it to.
On the left side of the My eBay Activity All Selling is a box with convenient 
links to services and to answers you may need while doing business on 
eBay (see Figure 5-2). You can choose to specify which links appear here by 
clicking the Edit Shortcuts link. Clicking this link presents you with a box of 
options to select for showing on your page (Figure 5-3).

Until you set your preferences (as to which page you want to automatically 
open your My eBay area to — see further on), you land on the My Summary 
page. Mine is shown in Figure 5-4 (note that when you subscribe to Selling 
Manager (which I do and you should too) it will replace the All Selling box.
The My Summary page gives you a snapshot of your current eBay business. 
It provides data about your buying and selling business, and supplies links 
to the items.
The Buying Reminders area tells you about
  
✦ Items you’re watching that close today
 
✦ Items you’re bidding on that close today
 
✦ Items you’ve been outbid on (for which you may need to up your bid)
 
✦ Feedback that you need to leave for items you’ve won
In the Selling Reminders area, you find info on

✦ Buyers who have requested totals for their purchases
 
✦ How many items you are awaiting payment on

My eBay: All Buying Page
Should you subscribe to any of eBay’s paid services such as Picture Manager 
or eBay Stores, there will also be a link to your subscription area. In addi-
tion, a link is provided to any important notices from eBay regarding 
changes in its policies or services.
My eBay: All Buying Page
The All Buying page is the hub for keeping track of your bids, your wins, items 
you’re watching, and any items you didn’t win. This area of My eBay helps you 
control everything you’re currently shopping for on the site. I check this page 
several times a day to see the progress of items I’m interested in.
Watching link
Have you ever seen an auction that made you think, “I don’t want to bid on 
this just now, but I’d like to buy it if it’s a bargain”? Clicking the Watching 
link from the My eBay Views box will bring you to the Watching page (see 
Figure 5-6), one of the most powerful features of the My eBay area. This page 
lists each auction with a countdown (time left) timer, so you know exactly 
when the auction will close. When a listing on your watch list gets close to 
ending, you can swoop down and make the kill — if the price is right.
 
Figure 5-6: 
Sit back and 
observe at

Are you interested in an item? You can observe the bidding action — the 
number of bids and how fast the price is rising (or not) — without showing 
your hand to the competition.

230
My eBay: All Buying Page
Also a handy marketing tool, the Watching page allows you to store list-
ings from competitive sellers. That way you can monitor the status of items 
similar to ones you plan to sell later — and see whether the items are selling 
high or low, helping you to decide whether it’s a good time to sell.
You’ve probably seen the Watch this item link at the top of each listing page. 
If you’re watching items (eBay allows you to monitor 200 listings at a time), 
you’ll see a notation on the page, indicating how many auctions you’re cur-
rently watching.
 
The watch-list function helps me keep my bargain-hunting quiet. Everybody 
knows when you’re bidding on an item; nobody knows when you’re watching 
the deals like a hawk. When you’re looking for bargains to buy and resell, you 
may not want to tip off the competition by letting them know you’re bidding.
Active Buying link
When you place a bid, eBay registers it in the Active Buying area, as shown 
in Figure 5-7, and displays a clickable link to the item.
 
Figure 5-7: 
Keeping 
track of your 
bidding.
 
Make the bidding page a daily stop on eBay, so you can see the status of 
your bids:
 
✦ Bid amounts in green indicate that you’re the high bidder in the auction.
 
✦ Bid amounts in red indicate that your bid is losing. If you want to 
increase your bid, simply click the auction title to go to the auction.

My eBay: All Buying Page
 
✦ Dutch auctions appear in black. To determine whether you retain high-
bidder status in a Dutch auction, you have to go to the actual auction.
 
✦ The My Max Bid area reminds you of the amount of your highest bid; if 
you see a bid that surpasses your own, you’ll know it’s time to throw in 
another bid to stay in the game.
 
✦ As auctions on which you’ve bid end, they are transferred to the Won or 
Didn’t Win page, based on your success or failure in the bidding process.
 
You can make notations on your bidding or item-watching. Just click the 
drop-down menu next to the item you want to annotate, click the Add Note 
button, and then add the information.
Won link
Clicking the Won link in the Buy area in the My eBay Views box displays all 
the items you’ve won as far back as the last 60 days, as shown in Figure 5-8. 
The default is 31 days, which should suffice for most transactions. The Won 
page is a great place to keep track of items that you’re waiting to receive 
from the seller. It’s also a convenient way to keep track of your expendi-
tures, should you be buying for resale.
If you do not see pictures next to your items, just click Customize at the 
upper right and make them appear.

My eBay: All Buying Page
Helpful features on the Won page include the following:
 
✦ Drop-down menu: Click the drop-down menu next to any item you’ve 
won, and you’ll be able to perform a plethora of tasks.
 
✦ Seller’s user ID: This link sends you to the seller’s Member Profile (feed-
back) page, where you can send an e-mail to the seller.
 
✦ Listing title: A link to the listing. I always use this when an item arrives 
so I can be sure that the item I received is exactly as advertised.
 
✦ Item number: The item number for your records.
 
✦ Item sale date: A convenient way to see whether your item is slow in 
shipping. After a week, it doesn’t hurt to drop the seller an e-mail to 
check on the shipping status.
For the newbie seller, the tools on the Selling 
pages are great. They’re simple and get right 
to the point. To run their auction business, 
small sellers can use the All Selling page with 
the Sell an Item form for individual listings and 
everything should be sufficient.
On the Selling page, you can view details for 
your active listings, including:
 ✓ Links for listings: Each listing has clickable 
links you can use to go instantly to an item 
page.
 ✓ Item number: In case you need an item 
number to contact a bidder or send auc-
tion information to a friend, you’ll find the 
item number here.
 ✓ Current price: This is the starting price of 
your item (if you have no bids) or the cur-
rent price based on bids received.
 ✓ Reserve price: This handy feature reminds 
you of the reserve price that you’ve set on 
an item. There’s nowhere else to check 
this.
 ✓ Quantity available: Here’s where you can 
see how many of the item are still available 
for purchase on the site. When an eBay 
store item is listed, this feature shows you 
how many are left, as well as the original 
quantity you listed.
 ✓ # of bids: When you see that the price is 
rising on an item, check out this column to 
see how many bids have been placed to 
date.
 ✓ Start date: This is the date the listing was 
posted on eBay.
 ✓ End date: This is the date the listing will end.
 ✓ Time left: In this column, you can check 
how much time is left (to the minute) in your 
listing.
 ✓ Action: This is the handiest column of all. 
Here you have a link that lets you list a sim-
ilar item. This is particularly handy if you 
want to use a template again for another 
item. It also allows you to revise a listing, 
add to the description, end a listing, or edit 
promotions if you have a store.
Visit Book III, Chapter 5 for an in-depth look at 
how the My eBay: All Selling area can help you 
manage your eBay business.

My eBay: Organize Links
 
✦ Sale price and quantity: Helps you keep track of the money you’ve spent. 
 
✦ Drop-down menu: This area displays a drop-down list where you can 
pick different commands based on the status of your transaction. You 
can choose to pay for the item through PayPal, view the payment status 
on paid items, mark the item paid if you paid through other payment 
methods, or leave feedback after you’ve received the item and are satis-
fied that it’s what you ordered.
 
✦ Icons: Each item’s listing has three icons that appear dimmed until the 
selected action is taken. A dollar sign indicates whether you’ve paid for 
the item, a star indicates that you’ve left feedback, and an envelope indi-
cates whether feedback has been left for you.
 
After you receive an item and leave feedback, click the box to the left of 
the item listing, and then click the Delete button to remove the selected 
completed transactions from view.
Didn’t win link
Sniff . . . the Didn’t Win area is a very sad place. This My eBay section lets 
you know when you’ve been outbid and lost an item. This option isn’t there 
to rub your nose in all the auctions you’ve lost — it’s a handy tool that lets 
you search the seller’s other items for something similar, or search the cat-
egory for a similar item.
My eBay: Organize Links
If you sell and have an interest in a few categories, look no further than the 
My eBay Organize zone, which gives you some links for checking out what’s 
hot and what’s not. Saved searches helps you track trends and find some 
bargains to resell on eBay.
Saved Searches link
A tool that comes in handy for sellers as well as buyers is the Searches link 
(in the Organize area of the My eBay Views box). You can list as many as 100 
saved searches. When you want to check one out, simply click the search 
name. If there are items matching your search, they will appear as icons in 
the search list. If not, the search box will appear empty (see Figure 5-9).
Are you always looking for certain things on eBay? For example, maybe you 
plan to search frequently for a Callaway Seven Heaven Wood — whatever. 
Add it to your list of saved searches and you won’t have to retype Callaway 
Seven Heaven Wood more than once. (Now there’s a blessing!) By organizing 
your saved searches, you can search for your favorite items with a click of 
your mouse on the title links.

234
My eBay: Organize Links
 
Figure 5-9: 
Some of 
my favorite 
searches 
(this month).
 
You can view saved searches, change them, delete them, or indicate that you’d 
like to receive e-mail notification when a new item is listed. To add an item to 
the list, run a search from the search box on any eBay page and click the Save 
This Search link that appears at the top of the search results. The next time you 
reload your My eBay Saved Searches page, your new favorite will be listed.
 
Be sure to use all the search tricks and shortcuts I show you in the table in 
Chapter 1, because these searches are not performed in the search box. 
These are single-line searches that you normally would perform from the 
small search boxes on the eBay pages.
To set up a favorite search, click the Add new Search link on the results page 
of any eBay search. You’re forwarded to eBay’s Search page. Type your key-
words and perform your search. When the results appear, click the Add to 
Favorites link at the top of the page, and your search will be saved to your 
My eBay All Favorites page.
If you choose to receive e-mail when your search locates a new listing, you 
can request that you receive notification over periods that range from seven 
days to a year. You’re allowed to receive new listing e-mails on 30 of your 
100 searches. Just click the drop down menu in the far-right of the row (refer 
to Figure 5-9). eBay sends its robot to check listings each night, so you’ll get 
a notification of new listings the next morning.

My eBay: Account tab
Keeping track of favorite searches is a valuable tool when you’re looking for 
particular items to resell and want to find them at bargain-basement prices. 
Be sure to take advantage of asterisks (wildcard characters) and alternate 
spellings so you can catch items with misspellings in the title. These are 
your best bets for low prices.
Saved Sellers link
When you’ve been on eBay for awhile, you will find that certain sellers carry 
a type of merchandise that interests you. By saving their user IDs in the 
Saved Sellers area, you’ll be able to revisit their current auctions without 
having to run a seller search from the search area. Remember that the pur-
pose of the My eBay page is to have all your controls in one area.
From a seller’s point of view, Saved Sellers is where you can keep a list of 
people who sell items similar to what you sell. You can check up on them 
and see what they’re selling, when they’re selling it, and for how much. It’s 
a helpful tool that can prevent you from listing an item right next to one of 
their auctions.
Saved Sellers is handy also when your competition is selling an item that you 
plan to sell, but at a deeply discounted price. When that happens, don’t offer 
yours until they sell out of the item, at which time the price will most likely 
go back up — supply and demand, remember? I have a few quality whole-
salers and liquidators under Saved Sellers, too, and search for lots that I can 
resell at a profit.
To add a seller to your Saved Sellers list, (if they have a store), you can click 
the link in the store header). When you search for a seller in the Advanced 
Search, you see a Seller Information box at the bottom of the left side page 
links. In that box, just click Add to Saved sellers, and they will appear on 
your list. You may add a maximum of 100 sellers to your list.
My eBay: Account tab
The Account tab lets you know how much you owe eBay and how much 
they’ll charge your credit card that month. This is a quick and easy way to 
check your most recent invoice, payments and credits, and your account; all 
these links are located in one area. You can also access your PayPal account 
to see, for example, when deposits were sent to your checking account.

236
My eBay: Account tab
It’s also a place where you can find a drop-down menu that links to the many 
areas that affect your selling and account (you can see mine in Figure 5-10). 
Below, I’ll show you some of the important links you’ll find on this page.
 
Figure 5-10: 
The 
Account 
summary 
page.
 
Personal information link
Click the Personal Information link (below My Account in the My eBay Views 
box) to get to the Personal Information page. This page holds all the links 
to your personal information on eBay. This is where you can change your 
e-mail address, user ID (without losing your feedback), password, and credit-
card information — and edit or create your About Me page. You can also 
change or access any registration or credit-card information that you have 
on file at eBay. There’s even a link you can use to change your home address 
on record.
Keeping all your contact information up-to-date on eBay is important. If they 
should ever find that any of the contact information is wrong, they may sus-
pend your membership.
Another link, Change my notification preferences, allows you to input your 
text-messaging number for your cellular phone, for example:
areacodeandnumber@messaging.nextel.com

My eBay: Account tab
That way eBay can notify you on your cell phone when you get outbid or 
when you win an item.
 
Adding a wireless e-mail address for your cell phone may seem like a great 
idea: eBay can send end-of-auction notices right to your WAP-enabled cell 
phone. The trouble is, sometimes these messages are sent hours after the 
listing ends. So don’t count on receiving timely updates.
Manage subscriptions link
Click the Manage subscriptions link (below My Account in the My eBay 
Views box), and you’ll be able to see just which additional selling tools 
you’re paying for. From here, you can upgrade, downgrade, or unsubscribe.
eBay Preferences link
You’ll find two links below My Account, Notification and Site preferences. A 
nifty feature of the eBay Site Preferences area (see Figure 5-11) is the oppor-
tunity to customize (under General Preferences by clicking the Show then 
Edit link) how you see your My eBay pages. If you run many listings, you can 
show as many as 200 items on these pages.
 
Figure 5-11: 
My eBay 
Site 
Preferences 
page.
 
You may as well select everything and go through each option every once in 
a while. This way you’ll have things set up just the way you want them while 
conducting business at eBay. 

238
My eBay: Account tab
Seller Dashboard
Since customer service is what it’s all about when building and maintaining a 
business on eBay, this space should be a regular stop for you. It’ll keep you 
apprised of how you’re doing with your customer service. Your average DSR 
(Detailed Seller Ratings) will appear in a box at the top of the page. 
 
If you’re a PowerSeller, the Seller Dashboard is a very important place — 
because this is where you can keep track of your Final Value fee discount 
(which is based on your ratings). Take a look at my page in Figure 5-12 for an 
example. Rolling over the lines on the chart will give you even more info on 
how you compare to other sellers on eBay.

Feedback link
In Book I, I talk all about the importance of feedback to the eBay community. 
In the Feedback area of the My eBay; My Account page, you can keep track 
of all your feedback duties.
When you click the Feedback link, you can see your items awaiting 
Feedback, and a link on the right will take you to the Feedback Forum, where 
you can perform many feedback-related functions:
 
✦ Find all item listings from the last 90 days that you haven’t left feedback 
for. (For shame!)
 
✦ Review and respond to feedback left for you. Responding to feedback is 
especially important, especially if the feedback is less than stellar. Every 
story has two sides.

✦ See all feedback you have left for others. If you want to re-examine feed-
back that you’ve left, this is the place.
Below these boxes is a listing of all your feedback dating back to your first 
transaction on eBay.
Ramping Up with Selling Manager
When you’ve been bitten by the selling bug, it’s a natural transition to go 
from a monthly listing of a few items to 50 or more. That means, dear reader, 
that you are officially running an eBay business. Congratulations!
This has a good and a bad side. The good is that you’re making considerably 
more cash than you did before hooking up with eBay. The bad? It’s time to 
start investing in tools to keep your business professional.
The first tool that can help smooth your transition makes the process of 
running eBay auctions and sales consistent — Selling Manager. This section 
tells you what Selling Manager does, but Book VIII goes into more of the pro-
gram’s intricacies.
Book III, Chapter 4 gets into eBay’s free Turbo Lister program (it gets your 
items on the site without having to go through the slow, sometimes tortur-
ous Sell Your Item form). As with Turbo Lister, Selling Manager is a suite of 
tools for managing your selling business from any computer (as long as it 
has an Internet connection). eBay gives you 30 days to try out the service 
for free, and thereafter charges $4.99 per month. (Believe me, the time that 
Selling Manager saves you is well worth the fee.)
 
I’ve run well over 100 auctions in a single month, successfully managing 
them with Selling Manager. I use it along with PayPal’s tools and QuickBooks. 
This approach provides a professional solution for my medium-sized eBay 
business.
First glimpse of Selling Manager
To subscribe to your free Selling Manager trial program, follow these steps:
 
1. Below the eBay navigation bar, which is at the top of every eBay page, 
click the Site Map link.
 
2. In the second column of the Site Map, under the Selling Tools head-
ing, click the eBay Selling Manager (or Selling Manager Pro) link.
 
3. Read the information on the Selling Manager hub page, and then click 
the Subscribe Now link.

240
Ramping Up with Selling Manager
You’re now subscribed to Selling Manager. If you have an eBay store, it’s 
free; if not, eBay adds a $4.99 fee to your monthly bill. eBay automatically 
populates Selling Manager with your information from the My eBay: All 
Selling page. The All Selling link will change to Selling Manager when it’s all 
set up.
With Selling Manager, you can click the link to view a summary of all your 
auction activities.
The Summary page lists at-a-glance statistics so you can quickly see what’s 
going on with your sales, at any time — from any computer. Links to other 
pages in the Selling Manager tool also appear on the Summary page.
 
If you plan to exceed 100 transactions a month, consider using Selling 
Manager Pro, which costs $15.99 per month. The Pro version has bulk 
feedback and bulk invoice-printing features and incorporates inventory 
management.
Scheduled listings link
The Scheduled Listings link on the Summary page takes you to any auction, 
fixed-price listing, or store listing you’ve sent to eBay through Turbo Lister 
(or listed on the Sell an Item page) and scheduled as pending for a later 
starting date or time. You can view these pending listings also through links 
on the Summary page that narrow the listings down to Starting Within the 
Next Hour and Starting Today.
When you enter the Scheduled Listings area by clicking the Scheduled Listings 
link on the Summary page, you can go directly to the listing. If you want to 
promote your listing-to-be in a banner ad (or create a link to it from elsewhere 
on the Internet), you can do so using the URL of the pending listing.
From the Pending Listing page, you can confirm all information about the 
sale, as well as make any changes to the listing or to the scheduling time.
Active listings link
Click the Active Listings link on the Summary page, and you can observe the 
bidding action just as you can from the My eBay All Selling page. The color-
coding that indicates bidding activity is the same as that on the My eBay All 
Selling page, and your listings are accessible with a click of your mouse.
You have the option to show only auctions, only store listings, or only fixed-
price items on the Active Listings page. You can also search your own list-
ings by keyword or item number.
 
For more about active listings, visit the Summary page, which includes links 
to items ending within the hour and those ending within the next 24 hours.

Selling Manager replaces the All Selling area 
of your My eBay page with its own sum-
mary of your current transactions (see the 
figure). Many sellers (even PowerSellers) 
rely on Selling Manager to handle their eBay 
management chores. I subscribe to Selling 
Manager Pro, so you’ll see some additional 
options on the screenshot below. Visit Book 
VIII, Chapter 1 to decide which version is right 
for you).
eBay’s Selling Manager
From Selling Manager, you can
 ✓ View listing status: You can see which 
sales activities you’ve completed and what 
you still have to do.
 ✓ Send custom e-mail and post feedback: 
Customize your e-mail templates and set up 
stored feedback comments to help you run 
through the post-sales process quickly.
 ✓ Relist in bulk: Relist multiple sold and 
unsold listings at once.
 ✓ Maintain sales records: See individual 
sales records for every transaction, includ-
ing a history of the transaction status.
 ✓ Print invoices and shipping labels: Print 
labels and invoices directly from sales 
records.
 ✓ Download sales history: Export your sales 
records to keep files on your computer.
 ✓ Keep track of items that qualify for relist-
ing: Relisting an item that hasn’t sold may 
qualify for a listing fee refund when the 
item sells upon the second listing. There’s 
a link in Selling Manager that will show you 
what qualifies.

Ramping Up with Selling Manager
Sold listings link
The Sold Listings feature (which you get to by clicking the link on the 
Summary page), is where Selling Manager really shines. You’ll find quite a 
few links here, including these:
 
✦ Awaiting payment: This is where items that have been won or bought 
are listed before a payment is made.
 
✦ Awaiting payment, buyers eligible for combined purchases: When a 
customer buys more than one item from you, the transactions will show 
up here. By clicking this area you can easily combine the items into a 
single invoice, to give the buyer the benefit of a reduced shipping cost.
 
✦ Awaiting Shipment: If you input the fact that a buyer has sent payment, 
or if the buyer pays using PayPal, the transaction automatically moves 
to this category.
 
✦ Paid and waiting to give feedback: Once an item is paid for, a reference 
to it appears here so you can keep track of the feedback you need to 
leave.
 
✦ Paid and shipped: These are (you guessed it) items that the buyer has 
paid for and that you’ve indicated as shipped on the transaction record.
 
✦ Dispute Console: This is the sad category where buyers who don’t pay 
go if, after all your attempts to get action, they have not responded and 
sent payment. (If they don’t cough up within ten days after you file a 
Nonpaying Bidder Alert, the listing moves to this category automatically.)
Archived Listings link
From the Archived Listings link, you can access completed items that closed 
within the last four months. You can also download this information to your 
computer. These are good records, so download them and keep them.
Seller tools
The Seller Tools box on the left side of the Summary page contains a powerful 
group of links that allow you to download and export your sales history to your 
computer. You also have links to PayPal, the Selling Manager Discussion Board, 
My eBay Store, and the good old My eBay All Selling page — in case you get 
nostalgic for the old, pre-Selling Manager days.

Selling Manager makes many selling pro-
cesses considerably easier. The number to the 
right of the Paid and ready to ship link on the 
Summary page indicates that you have items 
ready to ship. To see the details on these items, 
just click this link. You see each transaction; 
a bold dollar-sign icon to the right of a listing 
confirms that a payment has been made.
To indicate that you’ve shipped an item, click 
the record number next to the item and scroll 
down to the Sales Status & Memo area. Click 
Save, and the record moves from the Paid and 
Ready to Ship page (under Sold Listings) to the 
Paid and Shipped page.

S
elling on eBay is a grand idea. You clean out your garage, sell things 
you would have thrown away anyway, and make a profit. What a 
wonderful marketplace! You can make money in your spare time and 
enhance your lifestyle with just a few clicks on your keyboard and mouse.
When you decide to sell on eBay in earnest, however, you can run into 
problems. Few eBay sellers have a background in retailing or marketing, and 
eBay is all about retailing and marketing. In this chapter, I give you tips on 
pricing strategies. The first item on the agenda is to understand all the fees 
involved with running an e-business on eBay.
Keeping an Eye on Where the Pennies Go
It doesn’t seem so much: $.25 to list an item, plus a small Final Value Fee. Of 
course, a few cents (maybe dollars) go to PayPal. One by one, these minute 
amounts tend to breeze by even the most experienced seller. You don’t 
really see your eBay fees, because they’re not directly deducted from your 
sales. eBay bills you at the end of the month. It’s easy to lose track of your 
costs unless you are keeping very good books (more on that in Book IX).
 
All those nickels, dimes, and quarters add up. The hundreds (thousands?) 
of people who are selling items on the site for $1 can’t be making much of a 
profit — not even enough for a pack of gum! To avoid this low-profit trap, 
you must be keenly aware of every penny you spend of eBay listing fees, 
eBay Final Value fees, listing options, and PayPal fees.

Keeping an Eye on Where the Pennies Go
Becoming complacent and blithely ignoring your eBay costs as you list items 
for sale is easy to do. As a person in business for yourself, you must always 
take into account outgoing costs as well as incoming profits. The cost of 
your initial listing is just the beginning of your advertising budget for that 
item. You have to factor in the cost of all the options and features you use as 
well. After all that, a Final Value Fee is paid to eBay after the item sells. (For 
fees regarding your eBay Store, check out Book VIII, Chapter 6.)
 
In this section, I review the costs for listing an auction on eBay. But if you use 
a credit-card payment service, they also charge a fee. Later in this chapter, I 
examine the costs of the most popular credit-card payment services.
Insertion (listing) fees
Your insertion fee (that is, fee for listing an item) is based on the high-
est dollar amount of two things: your minimum opening bid or the dollar 
amount of your reserve price. If you start your auction at $.99 and have no 
reserve, the listing fee is $.15 ($.10 if you’re selling media: books, DVDs, CDs, 
or video games). But if you start your auction at $.99 and set an undisclosed 
reserve price of $50.00, your auction costs $2.15 to post. When you place a 
reserve on your item, you’re charged an insertion fee based on the amount of 
the reserve price — plus the charge for the reserve option.
For a summary of eBay insertion fees, see Table 1-1. (I talk about the fees for 
eBay Motors later in this chapter and in Chapter 2.)

If your item doesn’t sell, don’t think you can get your insertion fee back. It is 
nonrefundable. You do have the option of relisting your unsuccessful auction 
item and if your item sells with the second listing, your initial listing fee will 
be refunded. If it doesn’t sell the second time, you will be charged again. 
Writing a better title, starting with a lower opening bid, or adding a snappier 
description and better pictures will help in selling the item. Maybe you 
should think about changing the category as well.
 
Whether you’re listing one item with a starting bid of $1000.00 or 100 items 
for $5.00 each in a Dutch auction, your insertion cost per auction is never 
more than $4.00.
Reserve-price auctions
In a reserve-price auction, you’re able to set an undisclosed minimum price for 
which your item will sell, thereby giving yourself a safety net. Figure 1-1 shows 
an auction in which the reserve has not yet been met. Using a reserve-price 
auction protects the investment you have in an item. If, at the end of the 
auction, no bidder has met your undisclosed reserve price, you aren’t obligated 
to sell the item and the high bidder isn’t required to purchase the item.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Wow! I bet 
this auction 
has a hefty 
reserve!
 
For example, if you have a rare coin to sell, you can start the bidding at a low 
price to attract bidders to click your auction and read your infomercial-like 
description. If you start your bidding at too high a price, you might dissuade 
prospective bidders from even looking at your auction, and you won’t tempt 
them to even bid. They may feel that the final selling price will be too high 
for their budgets.

250
Keeping an Eye on Where the Pennies Go
Everyone on eBay is looking for a bargain or a truly rare item. If you can 
combine the mystical force of both of these needs in one auction, you have 
something special. The reserve-price auction enables you to attempt — and 
perhaps achieve — this feat.
The reserve-price auction is a safety net for the seller but often an uncom-
fortable guessing game for the prospective bidder. To alleviate buyer anxi-
ety, many sellers put reserve prices in the item description, allowing bidders 
to decide whether the item will fit into their bidding budgets.
 
You can’t use the reserve-price option in a Dutch (multiple-item) auction.
Placing a reserve price on one of your auctions means that the item will not 
sell until the bidding reaches the reserve price. When your reserve-price 
item does sell you’ve sold your item at a profit (let’s hear it for optimism!) 
The reserve fee is based on the reserve price you set, as outlined in Table 
1-2, so be sure to set the reserve high enough to cover the fee and still give 
you a profit.
 
Put your reserve price at the top of your listing description. That way, 
there’s a good chance the buyers will know what they’re in for. You could 
also offer free shipping in a reserve auction to take the edge off.
If your auction goes above the target sales 
price and you have more of the item in stock, 
you can offer items in stock to your underbid-
ders. The figure shows you where you can click 
the Make Second Chance Offer button to offer 
the item to underbidders for their most recent 
high bids.
You will be charged only Final Value Fees — 
not a second relisting (insertion) fee — if the 
person purchases the item.
Second chance to sell!

it sells, the initial listing fees are credited and you won’t have to pay a

eBay’s Optional Listing Features
eBay listings have many options and upgrades. Figure 1-2 shows how even 
a random search on eBay listings can yield examples of some very popular 
listing options.
 
Figure 1-2: 
A category

showing

When you come to the point in listing your item that brings you to eBay’s 
optional listing features, you see the headline, “Get more bids with these 
optional features! Make your item stand out from the crowd!” Sounds pretty 
good, doesn’t it? But getting carried away by these options is easy — and 
can lead to spending all your expected profits before you earn them.
In eBay University’s Advanced Selling) class, I quote auction success rates 
for the different features, but in the real life of your business, success varies 
from auction to auction and category to category. If you take the boldface 

252
eBay’s Optional Listing Features
option and then your auction appears in a category full of boldface auction 
titles, the bold just doesn’t have the punch you paid for. Your auction would 
stand out more without the bold option. It’s the same with highlighting. 
Certain categories are loaded with sellers who go overboard in the use of the 
highlighting feature — all the auction titles appear in a big lavender blur.
I recap the cost of the various eBay listing options in Table 1-3. Weigh the 
pros and cons in terms of how these options affect your eBay business. Will 
spending a little extra money enhance your item enough to justify the extra 
cost? Will you be able to make the money back in auction profits? You must 
have a good understanding of what the options are — and when and how 
you can use them to fullest advantage.

ware that can help you make up your auction budgets.)

Home-page featured auctions
A user who goes to www.eBay.com first arrives at the eBay home page. A 
Featured Items area appears in the middle of the home page; below this area 
are links to six home-page featured auctions, as shown in Figure 1-3. When 
you click the See all featured items link, the home page’s featured-items page 
appears, as shown in Figure 1-4. Most of these items are fixed-price listings 
that feature hundreds of items at a time. Many also feature items that list for 
more than $1000.

The home-page featured-auction option will set you back $59.95 for a single 
item. For big-ticket items, you’ve found the perfect location to draw an audience 
that may easily earn you back your $59.95. People who are new to eBay come 

254
eBay’s Optional Listing Features
in through the front page; this is prime real estate. The six auctions featured on 
the home page rotate at random throughout the day, but there’s no guarantee 
that your listing will be among them.
If someone searches your keywords or browses through your category, 
auctions featured on the front page appear at the top of the page (along 
with Featured Plus auctions, which I describe next). But you must keep 
in mind how much you’re paying for this option. Unless your auction will 
bring you more than a few hundred dollars, this feature probably isn’t 
worth the additional cost.
Featured First
Featured Plus is an option that can be used with much success. When you 
choose the Featured First option, your item may be listed at the top of the 
page when a shopper searches for keywords or browses category listings. 
Although your listing doesn’t appear on the eBay home page (see the pre-
ceding section), it may rotate at the top of your selected category’s home 
page or item search (see Figure 1-5).

You get extra exposure for $24.95 for up to 10 days and $74.95 for up to 30 
days, but you must still consider your listing’s budget. How much do you 
expect your item to sell for? Will the $24.95 cost benefit your listing’s expo-
sure enough to justify the expenditure? Be sure that your item will bring you 
more than a few hundred dollars before choosing this option.
Subtitle
You may use 55 characters for your item’s title. Title search is the de facto 
search standard on eBay. From the statistics I’ve seen on my own auctions, 
more than 90% of searches were made for title only, versus title and descrip-
tion. But how can you make your item stand out when it shows up with hun-
dreds of other items that look the same? Use the subtitle option!
Notice the subtitle under one of the listings in Figure 1-6. This is your oppor-
tunity to add additional text to your listing, readable by prospective buyers 
as they scan a search or browse a category. It works very well if you are one 
of several sellers selling the same item at a similar price — it sets your list-
ing apart from the others. A caveat: This additional text will be picked up in 
a search only if the person chooses to search both titles and descriptions. 
The additional text does not get pulled up in a title-only search. The fee for 
this is $.50.
 
Figure 1-6: 
I try to set 
my more 
expensive 
items apart 
from the 
competition 
by using 
subtitles.
 
When your item has something special about it or could use some extra 
description, the subtitle option allows you more space to give the browsing 
shopper vital information.

256
eBay’s Optional Listing Features
Highlight
I was excited when eBay announced the highlighting option. Ever since 
college, I can’t read a book without my trusty neon-yellow highlighter. 
Highlighting makes anything stand out on a white page of text. This works just 
as well on eBay as it does on paper — except eBay uses a lavender-colored 
highlighter — ick!
Unfortunately, as with anything in life, less is more. If you choose to list your 
item in a category in which all the sellers decide to use the highlighting option, 
the only listings that will stand out will be the ones without highlighting.
The highlight feature will set you back $5. Does your budget allow for that? 
To give your listing title a punch for a smaller amount of money, consider 
the Bold option or, even better, the Border option.
Border
Using a border around your listing immediately draws attention to it when 
someone is doing a search or browsing a category. At $4, it’s a deal compared 
to the highlight, which costs $5. However, use this option only when your 
expected final price warrants such expenditure.
Listing Designer
eBay comes up with options to fill the needs (or wants in this case) of users. 
Some sellers enjoy putting colorful graphics around their descriptions. Listing 
Designer will include pretty graphics and help you design your description, 
placing pictures in different places on the page. But if you have a good 
description (creatively done with HTML color and emphasis) plus a good 
picture (inserted creatively with the HTML code I give you in Book V), your item 
will draw bids just the same as if you spent $.10 extra (per listing) for the Listing 
Designer option.
If you want your descriptions surrounded by graphics, make sure they aren’t 
too intensive. Otherwise, the pages will load too slowly for dial-up users. 
Also, you can develop your own template or buy one from savvy eBay graph-
ics gurus who sell their services on the site.
 
You can use a graphics template to brand your listings on eBay, giving them 
a uniform look. If you want to use a template, decide on one and make it 
your trademark.
Boldface
The Boldface option is one of my favorites and probably the most-used 
option in the eBay stable. A listing title in boldface type stands out in a 

Book III
Chapter 1
Be Sure Your 
Listings Make Cents
257
eBay’s Optional Listing Features
crowd, unless . . . you got it, unless it’s in a category loaded with boldface 
titles. If the $2 that eBay charges for this benefit is in your auction budget, 
odds are it will get you a good deal more views than if you didn’t use it.
Applying boldface to your item title spices it up and pulls it off the page right 
into the reader’s eye. Unfortunately, bold adds an additional $2 to your list-
ing cost, so you better be in a position to make a good profit from the item. 
Also make sure your research shows that it can sell for your target price.
View counter
Counters have become a popular free option in the online world. Placed 
on your auction by an outside service at your request, the counter ticks up 
each time someone loads your page from eBay. A counter can impress bid-
ders and convince them they’re viewing a hot deal. It can also impress other 
sellers to run out and sell the identical item.
 
A counter is a terrific tool for marketing your auctions — sometimes. If you 
have an auction with no bids and a counter that reads a high number, 
newbie bidders may be dissuaded from taking a flyer and bidding on your 
auction. Their thinking goes something like this: If that many people looked 
at this auction and didn’t bid, something must be wrong with the item. 
They’ll tend to doubt their own instincts as to what is and isn’t a good deal. 
In a situation such as this, however, what might be going on is that savvy 
bidders are just watching your auction, waiting to bid at the last minute.
 
A private counter shields the numbers from the eyes of casual lookie-loos. 
The figures are available only to you through a password-protected login 
page. Private counters come in different flavors. Some of the most helpful 
private counters offer a breakdown of visitors hour-by-hour. This type of 
smart counter is available from several online services. eBay offers you a 
free counter, but it’s not a smart counter.
Gallery Plus
eBay bills the gallery as its miniature picture showcase, and indeed it is. 
By adding a gallery photo, a thumbnail image (96 x 96 pixels) of your item 
appears next to your listing when the user browses the category view or 
search results, which can reap you many benefits. If you’d like your picture 
to pop up to a humongous 400x400 when a prospective buyer mouses over 
your Gallery picture in a search, you’ll have to pay an extra $.35.
Figure 1-7 shows how a Gallery Plus item looks in a search result. Gallery 
Plus pictures are not necessary if you’re selling a stock item that looks the 
same in anyone’s listing, such as a CD, a book, or an electronic product. But 
if it’s in your budget, and you have a good picture of a unique item, see if it 
works for you.

attention 
to unique 
items.
 
 
When you take advantage of the Gallery Plus, be sure to crop your photo 
tight to the subject. For more help with your images, see Book V.
Buy It Now
The Buy It Now feature, shown in Figure 1-8, has a few significant benefits. If 
you have a target price for the item you’re listing, make that your Buy It Now 
price. You can also use this option during frenzied holiday shopping times 
or with hot items. Try posting a slightly higher-than-normal price and per-
haps you’ll get a bite, er, sale.
The Buy It Now feature disappears when someone bids on the item or, if 
you’ve placed a reserve on the auction, when a bidder meets your reserve 
price. You can’t use Buy It Now with a Dutch (multiple-item) auction.
 
To use this feature, you must have a feedback rating of at least 10, have a 
PayPal account in good standing, or be ID-Verified. (ID Verify is eBay’s sec-
ondary form of identification, permitting you to participate on the site with-
out submitting a credit card.)

If your item will sell for a low price, remember my golden rule: Before paying 
for a feature, ask yourself whether it’s in your listing budget.
eBay Picture Hosting
If you are shopping the site or even researching your competitor’s auctions, 
you’ll notice that some sellers put small pictures of the items they’re selling 
at the top of their auction page. That picture is called the preview picture. 
What a great selling point this is. The prospective buyers can see your item 
the second they click the page! Best of all, there’s no additional cost to the 
seller.

260
Adding the Final Value Fees
You should definitely take advantage of this offer. Additional pictures (easily 
uploaded to your item page) cost $.15 each. If you want to add a group of 
photos (1 to 6), you can purchase a picture pack for $.75. If you have even 
more photos (7 to 12), the deluxe picture pack will set you back $1.00.
 
Always use the free Gallery picture — after all, it’s free! But why not save 
extra fees by uploading your own additional pictures for your auction at no 
extra cost? See Book V, Chapter 5 for full instructions on how to do this on 
your own without incurring any extra charges.
Adding the Final Value Fees
eBay’s version of the Hollywood back-end deal is the Final Value Fee. Big 
stars get a bonus when their movies do well at the box office; eBay gets a 
cut when your auction sells. After your auction ends, eBay charges the Final 
Value Fee to your account in a matter of minutes.
 
This chapter gives you the lowdown on Final Value Fees for auction type list-
ings. If you’re thinking of listing a Fixed Price item, the closing costs are 
entirely different. Check Book III, Chapter 3 for the breakdown of Fixed Price 
Final Value fees.
An ad in the Real Estate category is not charged a Final Value Fee. Successful 
auctions in the eBay Motors category are charged a flat Final Value Fee. (See 
Chapter 2 for information on fees in both categories.)
Even a rocket scientist would have trouble figuring out exactly how much 
eBay receives at the end of your auction. To help you calculate how much 
you’ll owe eBay, see Table 1-4.
Table 1-4  
Final Value Fees For Auction Type Listings

Final Value Fee
$.01–$25.00
8.75% of the selling price

8.75% on the first $25, plus 3.5% on selling prices of $25.01 to 
$1000.00, plus another 1. 5% on selling prices over $1000.00
Final Value Fees (FVFs) are charges on the sale price for your item and do not 
include whatever you charge for shipping. Thank goodness eBay hasn’t raised 
the FVF fees lately — they’re hard enough to calculate as it is! So how do all 
these percentages translate to actual dollar amounts? Take a look at Table 1-5, 
where I calculated the Final Value Fees on some sample selling prices.

Book III
Chapter 1

261
Adding the Final Value Fees
If you try to work out your own Final Value Fees, you may get an extreme 
headache — and come up with fractional cents. Know that eBay rounds up 
fees of $0.005 and more and rounds down below $0.005. These roundings 
are performed on a per-transaction basis, and generally even out over time. 
For more details, check out eBay’s account-rounding explanation (perhaps a 
strong cocktail would help while reading it) at
http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/rounding-account-
balance.html
Table 1-5 
Sample Final Value Fees for Auction Listings
Closing Bid
To Find Your Final Value Fee
$0.01–$25.00
Multiply the final sale price by 8.75%. If the final sale price is 
$25.00, you owe eBay $2.19 ($25 × 0.0875).
$25.01–$1000.00
You pay $2.19 for the first $25.00 of the final sale price. 
Subtract $25.00 from your final closing bid and then multiply 
this amount by 3.5%. Add this total to the $2.19. The sum is 
what you owe eBay. If the final sale price is $1000.00, you 
owe $34.12 ($975 × 0.035) plus $2.19, or $36.31.
$1000.01 and over
You owe $2.19 for the first $25.00 of the sale price and $34.12 
for the price between $25.01 and $1000.00. This amount 
is $36.31. Now, subtract $1000.00 from the final sale price 
(you’ve already calculated those fees) and multiply that 
amount by 1.5%. Add this amount to $36.31. The sum is the 
amount you owe eBay. If the final sales price is $3000.00, you 
owe $30.00 ($2000 × 0.015) plus $36.31, or $66.31.
 
If you’re starting to get dizzy just reading these examples, perhaps doing 
your own calculations isn’t for you. It’s certainly not for me — this stuff 
makes my eyes glaze over! Later in this chapter (see the section “Totaling 
Fees with our eBay Fee Calculator”), I describe a cool spreadsheet devised 
by Patti Louise Ruby (my Tech Editor and co-author on eBay Listings That 
Sell For Dummies). This spreadsheet is downloadable, works with Microsoft 
Office Excel, and can handle all these calculations for you.
 
Because of the sliding percentages, the higher the final selling price, the 
lower the commission eBay charges. Math can be a beautiful thing, when 
applied for your benefit.
 
eBay doesn’t charge a percentage Final Value Fee on an auction in the Real 
Estate category as in other categories. You pay a flat FVF of $35 for 
Timeshares and Land and no FVF for Commercial or Residential. But in the 
Automotive category, you pay a flat Successful Transaction Services Fee of 
$125 for vehicles and $100 for motorcycles if your auction ends with a 
winning bidder (and the reserve has been met).

262
Selling Variations in Auctions
When selling a vehicle (car, truck, or RV) through eBay Motors, you’re get-
ting a great deal. You pay $0 to list your item, and the transaction services 
fee is only $125 when the item sells.
Selling Variations in Auctions
An auction is an auction is an auction, right? Wrong! eBay has four types of 
auctions for your selling pleasure. Most of the time you’ll run traditional auc-
tions, but other auctions have their place, too. After you’ve been selling on 
eBay for a while, you may find that one of the other types of auctions better 
suits your needs. In this section, I review these auctions so you fully under-
stand what they are and when to use them.
Traditional auctions
Traditional auctions are the bread and butter of eBay. You can run a tradi-
tional auction for 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 days, and when the auction closes, the high-
est bidder wins. I’m sure you’ve bid on several and won at least a few. I bet 
you’ve also made money running some of your own.
You begin the auction with an opening bid, and bidders will bid up your 
opening price into a healthy profit for you (I hope).
Best Offer
If you’ve got a fixed-price listing, you can opt to insert a button under your 
sales price that will encourage buyers to Make an Offer on your item. This 
is probably one of the oldest sales methods around. (In some countries, it’s 
an insult to buy something at the posted price; haggling is part of their retail 
culture.) 
So, if you love the thrill of haggling (I don’t, really), you can insert the Make 
an Offer button in your listings at no extra charge. See Figure 1-9 for an 
example. When someone makes an offer on one of your items, eBay sends 
you an e-mail asking that you reply regarding whether the proposed price is 
acceptable to you. 
Multiple-item (Dutch) auctions
When you’ve purchased an odd lot of 500 kitchen-knife sets or managed 
(legally, of course) to get your hands on a truckload of televisions that you 
want to sell as expeditiously as possible, the multiple-item auction is what 
you’ll want to use. In the multiple-item (Dutch) auction, which can run for 1, 
3, 5, 7, or 10 days, you list as many items as you’d like and bidders can bid 
on as many items as they’d like. The final item price is set by the lowest suc-
cessful bid at the time the auction closes.

For example, suppose you want to sell five dolls on eBay in a multiple-item 
auction. Your starting bid is $5 each. If five bidders each bid $5 for one doll, 
they each get a doll for $5. But, if the final bidding reveals that two people 
bid $5, one person bid $8, and another bid $9, all bidders win the doll for the 
lowest final bid of $5.
The following list highlights the details of the multiple-item auction:
 
✦ The listing fee is based on your opening bid price (just like in a tradi-
tional auction), but the fee is multiplied by the number of items in your 
auction, to a maximum listing fee of $4.00.
 
✦ The auction’s Final Value Fees use the same scale as in a traditional auc-
tion, but they’re based on the total dollar amount of your completed 
auctions.
 
✦ When bidders bid on your Dutch auction, they can bid on one or more 
items at one bid price. (The bid is multiplied by the number of items.)
 
✦ If the bidding gets hot and heavy, rebids must be in a higher total dollar 
amount than the total of that bidder’s past bids.
 
✦ Bidders may reduce the quantity of the items for which they’re bidding 
in your auction, but the dollar amount of the total bid price must be 
higher.

Selling Variations in Auctions
 
✦ All winning bidders pay the same price for their items, no matter how 
much they bid.
 
✦ The lowest successful bid when the auction closes is the price for which 
your items in that auction will be sold.
 
✦ If your item gets more bids than you have items, the lowest bidders are 
knocked out one by one, with the earliest bidders remaining on board 
the longest in the case of tie bids.
 
✦ The earliest (by date and time) successful high bidders when the auc-
tion closes win their items.
 
✦ Higher bidders get the quantities they’ve asked for, and bidders can 
refuse partial quantities of the number of items in their bids.
Restricted access auctions
eBay won’t allow certain items to be sold in nonrestricted categories, so you 
must list them in the adult only area of eBay. eBay makes it easy for the user 
to find or avoid these types of auctions by making this area accessible only 
after the user enters a password and agrees to the terms and conditions of 
the area, as shown in Figure 1-10.

Selling Variations in Auctions
Items in the adults-only area are not openly accessible through the regular 
eBay title search, nor are they listed in Newly Listed Items. Anyone who 
participates in adults-only auctions on eBay, whether as a bidder or a seller, 
must have a credit card on file on eBay for verification.
 
Do not attempt to slip an adults-only auction into a nonrestricted category. 
eBay doesn’t have a sense of humor when it comes to this violation of 
policy, and may relocate or end your auction. eBay might even suspend you 
from its site.
Private auctions
The eBay search page features an area where you can conduct a bidder 
search. You can find a list of the items that you’ve bid on in the past 30 days. 
Anyone not signing in on your eBay account sees a list of only the items 
you’ve won — but that’s no real help. One December, my daughter told me 
that she didn’t want a particular item — something that I had just bid on — 
for Christmas. My creative daughter had been regularly perusing my bidding 
action on eBay to see what I was buying for the holidays! A private auction 
would have kept my shopping secret.
Private auctions also work well for the buyers who avail themselves of the 
psychics, card readers, and fortune teller’s listings on eBay and don’t want 
their friends to think they are . . . well, you know. Sometimes it’s just best to 
keep things quiet.
eBay private auctions don’t place bidders’ names on the auction listing. No 
one needs to know just how much you choose to pay for something. As a 
seller, you have the option (at no extra charge) of listing your auction as a 
private auction.
 
The private auction is a useful tool for sellers who are selling bulk lots to 
other sellers. It maintains the privacy of the bidders, and customers can’t do 
a bidder search to find out what sellers are paying for the loot they plan to 
resell on eBay.
The private auction can save you the potential embarrassment associated 
with buying a girdle or the tie that flips over to reveal a racy half-nude 
female on the back.
Although the private auction is a useful tool, it may intimidate the novice 
user. If your customer base comes from experienced eBay users and you’re 
selling an item that may benefit by being auctioned in secret, you might want 
to try this option.

PayPal Gets Its Cut
PayPal Gets Its Cut
When you’ve sold your item, do you think that’s the end of the fees? Nope! 
If your customer pays using PayPal, you’re faced with additional fees. 
However, having a PayPal premier or business account is important for 
building your commerce for these reasons:
 
✦ eBay buyers look for the PayPal option because it offers them a high 
level of protection against fraud.
 
✦ Most customers prefer to pay with a credit card, either to delay the 
expense or to have complete records of their purchases.
 
✦ From a seller’s point of view, using PayPal can be cheaper than having a 
direct-merchant credit-card account.
 
✦ PayPal helps with your paperwork by offering downloadable logs of your 
sales that include all PayPal fees. eBay fees are not included; you’re on 
your own for those.
 
A business account requires the account to be registered in a business 
name. A premier account allows you to do business under your own name.
Check out Book II, Chapter 4, which covers the PayPal services and fees in 
depth.
Totaling Fees with our eBay Fee Calculator
I don’t have the time (or the inclination) to total the applicable fees and 
expenses for every item I put up on eBay. But I do not recommend such lazi-
ness to anyone trying to earn a living on eBay.
Not quite adult enough. . . .
I was surprised to see a private auction listed 
on one of my favorite eBay seller’s list. She 
usually doesn’t sell items like “Fringe Black 
BRA 36B SEXY SEXY SEXY,” so I looked through 
this seller’s past auctions. I saw that she didn’t 
get any bids when she listed the bra in the 
restricted (adults-only) area of eBay in the 
category Everything Else: Mature Audiences: 
Clothing, Accessory. When she put the bra 
up for private auction in the category Clothing 
& Accessories: Women’s Clothing: Lingerie: 
Bras: General, she got five bidders and sold 
the item. I guess it wasn’t sexy enough for the 
“adult” crowd!

Totaling Fees with our eBay Fee Calculator
To combat the laziness that I fear will drastically affect my bottom line, my 
dear friend Patti Louise Ruby designed a fee calculator that helps me make 
better business decisions on pricing my items — and it can do the same for 
you! You can download the program from my Web site www.coolebay-
tools.com/eBayFeeCalculator. Here’s how it works:
Here are the steps for using the spreadsheet:
 
1. Download the eBay Fee Calculator spreadsheet and open it in 
Microsoft Excel.
 
2. At the bottom of the spreadsheet, click the appropriate tab to select 
the type of listing and/or category of the item you want to calculate 
fees for.
 
 You’ll see a worksheet similar to the one shown in Figure 1-11.
 
Figure 1-11: 
It’s nice 
not to have

3. Fill in the business information as prompted in the first section on the 
left of the tab. For each prompt, click the box in the second column to 
display a drop-down list with a choice of acceptable answers.
 
 Info to enter includes:
 
• Whether you have an eBay Store
 
• Whether you subscribe to either Selling Manager or Selling 
Manager Pro
 
• Whether you have a PayPal account, and what level of payments you 
process per month through PayPal.

Setting Sensible Shipping Costs
Buyers who visit the eBay site are bargain shoppers. They want to get their 
items at the lowest possible prices. They’re also more cognizant about the 
“hidden” expense buried in the item’s shipping and handling fees. When you 
set these fees, you must take into account every expense involved in your 
packing and shipping. You can’t make your shipping area a losing proposition.
After you know all the eBay fees involved in 
selling your item, you can play around with 
the pricing and figure out how much your 
Buy It Now (or target selling) price should be. 
Remember to include the following costs when 
pricing your items:
 ✓ How much you paid for the item you want 
to resell
 ✓ The Freight In amount (the cost of shipping 
the item to you)
 ✓ The cost of shipping the item to your 
buyer
Forewarned is smart

Setting Sensible Shipping Costs
However, too many eBay sellers have increased their shipping prices to 
outrageous amounts. I’ll bet those sellers think they’ve found a cute way to 
save a couple of cents off their Final Value Fees (after all, Final Value Fees 
aren’t charged on shipping costs). But when the shipping fee equals a third 
of the item’s cost, a prospective bidder may think twice about placing a bid. 
Of course, if the item is big or the buyer wants it fast, he or she may feel 
better about paying higher shipping costs.
 
eBay penalizes sellers who charge high shipping fees and rewards sellers 
who offer Free Shipping by giving them better visibility in the Best Match 
search results. Try listing your item with the minimum shipping amount 
included in your selling price. Then offer buyers a second shipping option 
for Priority Mail (faster shipping) at a charge. Your item will still get the 
benefit of eBay’s Free Shipping search preference.
Business is business, and when you’re on eBay to make a profit, every penny 
counts. In this section, I tell you how to evaluate all the costs involved with 
packing and shipping the items you sell. I also show you how to use the tools 
at your disposal — such as eBay’s shipping calculator — to make the best 
decisions about how much to charge your buyers for shipping costs.
For information on organizing your shipping area, be sure to read Book VII.
 
When calculating shipping costs, don’t assume that all you have to worry 
about is just the cost of your postage. You also have per-item costs for 
boxes, padded mailers, shipping tape, labels, and pickup or service fees 
from your carriers. Now and again, you may even pay the college kid across 
the street five bucks to schlep your boxes for you. Expenses show up in the 
strangest places.
In addition to adding up the packing and shipping supplies, you need to 
amortize the monthly fees from any online postage shipping services. When 
you occasionally pay for a pickup from the carrier, you need to add that 
expense to the shipping charges, too. The following list runs down some of 
the expenses involved:
 
✦ Padded mailers: Select an average-size padded mailer that works for 
several types of items you sell. Selecting an average size for all your 
products works well because it’s cheaper to buy in quantity. Even if 
a few of your items could fit in the next-size-down mailers, buying the 
bigger size by the case gives you a considerable discount. Why keep five 
sizes of mailers in stock in quantities of 100 if you don’t have to? If you 
don’t use all the bigger ones, you can always sell them. And besides, 
padded envelopes don’t go bad.
 
 Don’t be misled by packaging suppliers’ claims of low-cost mailers. They 
usually don’t include the shipping costs in these price estimates.

270
Setting Sensible Shipping Costs
 
 When you price your cost-per-piece, be sure to include (as part of your 
cost) what you have to pay to get the item shipped to you. For example, 
if you purchase your mailers — say #4s (9
1⁄2 x 14
1⁄2) — by the hundred, 
they may cost you $.40 each. If you buy a case of 500, they may cost only 
$.28 each. By buying in quantity, you save $.12 per mailing envelope! The 
more business you do, the more significant the savings.
 
 One of my favorite sources (with really reasonable prices and free ship-
ping) is RoyalMailers.com. They carry every size imaginable, and if you 
use my Web site’s name as your discount code, you get an additional 
10% off your order. Just go to 
 
 www.royalmailers.com/coolebaytools.
 
✦ Packing peanuts: I must admit that storing all those packing peanuts is a 
real drag. But here is where buying in bulk equates to huge cost savings. 
I just checked one of my favorite vendors, www.bubblefast.com, and 
found a free-shipping offer. From Bubblefast, you can purchase
 
 3.5 cubic feet for $9.98 = $2.85 per cubic foot
 
 7 cubic feet for $19.10 = $2.73 per cubic foot
 
 14 cubic feet for $36.40 = $2.60 per cubic foot
 
 As you can see, 14 cubic feet turns out to be the most economical deal. 
eBay sellers like Bubblefast, sell packing peanuts for half what they 
cost when you purchase them from a brick-and-mortar retailer. (That’s 
because a store you can walk into has to use up square footage to store 
these babies, which means a higher cost.)
 
 Here, in a nutshell (sorry, I couldn’t resist), is my solution to peanut 
storage. Fill a drawstring-type trash bag with peanuts, and then tie the 
drawstring. Screw cup hooks into the rafters of your garage and hang 
the bags from the rafters. You can store a bunch of peanuts there! Be 
sure to recycle!
 
✦ Packing tape: You need a stock of clear packing tape. The common size 
for a roll is 2 inches wide by 110 feet long. I searched eBay and found 
these deals, the following prices include shipping:
 
 6 rolls = $17.07 = $2.85 per roll
 
 12 rolls = $26.94 = $2.25 per roll
 
 18 rolls = $29.94 = $1.66 per roll
 
 Again, compare prices before buying.
 
✦ Boxes: I won’t take you through the various costs of boxes because hun-
dreds of sizes are available. Shop eBay (but often the shipping prices are 
too high), and also check out www.uline.com for boxes at reasonable 
prices. For the example, let’s just say a typical box will cost $.55 each.

Setting Sensible Shipping Costs
 
✦ G&A (general and administrative) costs: For the uninitiated (transla-
tion: you never had to do budgets at a large corporation), G&A rep-
resents the costs incurred in running a company. But the principle is 
familiar: Time is money. For example, the time it takes you to research 
the costs of mailers, tapes, and boxes on eBay is costing you money. 
The time it takes you to drive to the post office costs you money. You 
won’t actually put a figure on this just now, but it’s something you need 
to think about — especially if you spend half an hour at the post office 
every other day. In effect, that’s time wasted. You could be finding new 
sources of merchandise instead.
 
✦ Online postage service: If you’re paying around $10 a month for the con-
venience of buying and printing online postage, that’s an expense too. If 
you ship 100 packages a month, that amortizes to $.10 per package.
 
 If you’re questioning whether you need an online postage service, here’s 
my two cents: Being able to hand your packages to the postal carrier 
beats standing in line at the post office.
Table 1-6 shows you the cost for mailing a tiny padded envelope cushioned 
with packing peanuts.

how to use QuickBooks to easily and simply track your shipping costs.

Finer Points of Selling

Y
ou can buy the “inside secrets” of eBay from lots of places. Some e-book 
sellers try to convince you that only they have the surreptitious bits of 
knowledge — gleaned from years (months?) of experience on the site — that 
reveal what’s Really Going On. Truth be told, the online retail market changes 
so quickly that eBay can barely keep up with it — the profile of the online 
shopper changes constantly. How likely is it that anybody has the ultimate 
answer? Sure, you hear mysterious rumors of the way to sure-fire profits (cue 
up the X-Files theme in the background). Start an auction at a certain day and 
time, and you’ll automatically make more money? Puh-leez! The only one who 
rakes in profits with that information is the guy who’s selling it to you!
I’ve interviewed many eBay high-volume sellers (called PowerSellers) and 
almost all agree that popular eBay theories are bunk. However, the sellers 
do have some practical preferences for when and how they conduct their 
eBay transactions. This chapter gets to the gist of these preferences and the 
corresponding best practices.
Selling Strategies
The basic plan for running an auction is the same for everyone, except for 
decisions regarding the timing of the auction and the starting price. If you 
speak to 20 eBay sellers, you’ll probably get 20 different answers about 
effective starting bids and when to end your auction. Until you develop your 
own philosophy, I’d like to give you the tools to make a sound decision. 
What works for one seller may not work for another.
You can also successfully promote your auctions online and offline, and you 
can legally offer your item to the next highest bidder if the auction winner 
doesn’t come through with payment. I discuss a few of these ideas in this 
section.

274
Selling Strategies
 
The ideas in this technique come from my own experience and discussions 
with current eBay PowerSellers. These ideas are merely suggestions of meth-
ods and starting points that work for others. You definitely need to test 
them out to find out which practices work — for you and for the types of 
items you sell.
Starting the bidding
The most generally accepted theory about starting bids is that setting the 
bidding too high scares away new bids.
 
Some sellers begin the bidding at the price they paid for the item, including 
expected eBay and PayPal fees, thereby protecting their investment. This is 
a good tactic, especially if you bought the item at a price far below the cur-
rent going rate on eBay.
To determine the current going value for your item, I recommend using the 
completed auctions search, which I explain in Book II, Chapter 1. If you know 
that the item is selling on eBay for a certain price and that there is a demand 
for it, starting the bidding at a reasonably low level can be a great way to 
increase bidding and attract prospective bidders to view your auction.
 
Years of advertising experience can’t be wrong. If your item is in demand and 
people are actively buying, start the bidding low. Retail stores have done this 
for years with ads that feature prices starting at $9.99 or $14.98. Note that 
WalMart ends prices in $.97 or $.54 when they’re on sale in a store, but on its 
Web site, the items’ prices end evenly at $.00. Even television commercials 
advertising automobiles quote a low starting price. (To get the car as shown 
in the ad, of course, you may end up paying twice the quoted price.)
When sellers know that they have an item that will sell, they begin their bid-
ding as low as a dollar or even a penny. Because of the eBay proxy bidding 
system (which maintains your highest bid as a secret, increasing it incremen-
tally when you’re bid against), it takes more bids (due to the smaller bidding 
increments) to bring the item up to the final selling price.
The downside is that new bidders who aren’t familiar with the system may 
bid only the minimum required increment each time they bid. This can be 
frustrating, and they may quit bidding because it might take them several 
bids to top the current bid placed by someone who is familiar with the proxy 
bid system. Very few of us know the proxy increments by heart, so as a 
refresher, I give you the goods in Table 2-1.

Auction length
Another debatable philosophy is auction timing. People are always asking 
me how long to run auctions and what’s the best day to end an auction. 
You have to evaluate your item and decide which of the following is the 
best plan:
 
✦ One-day auction: Did you just get a load of an item that sells as fast as 
you post it on the site? Although a Buy It Now feature on any auction can 
bring great results, that works only if the item is hot! hot! hot! If people 
are bidding the item up — and they really gotta have it — you may do 
best by starting the bidding really low and listing the item with a one-
day format.
 
 When you list in a one-day format, your listing goes right to the top of 
the listings Ending Soonest list. Most savvy shoppers view their searches 
by listings ending first (rather than the eBay default of Best Match). With 
a one-day format, you can pretty much choose the time of day your item 
will be at the top.
 
 This format can be very successful if you have an item that’s the hot 
ticket for the moment on eBay. I used this format when I sold some 
Friends TV-show memorabilia. The 24-hour auction opened midday 
before the final show and ended the next day — at a healthy profit!

276
Selling Strategies
 
 If the competition starts their auctions at $.99 with a reasonable Buy It 
Now price, you’ll find that bidders foil many of their Buy It Now offers. 
Retaliate by listing the item with a starting bid just a dollar or so below 
your Buy It Now price (and make that price at least $.50 below the com-
petition’s), and you’ll find your items will be snapped up quickly.
 
✦ Three-day auction: If, the item’s price will shoot up right after you post 
it, a three-day auction works just fine. And it’s great for those last-minute 
holiday shoppers looking for hard-to-find items.
 
 A three-day auction is good, for the same reasons that a one-day auction 
is good — only it’s better for the faint of heart and nervous Nellies (like 
me) because it gives your item more time to sell.
 
 Another good use of a three-day auction is when you already have a 
seven-day auction up on the site and the bidding is going crazy. You’ve 
reached your sales goal by the middle of a seven-day cycle. Once the 
seven-day auction is in the last couple of days of the listing, put up a 
three-day auction.
 
 With the Buy It Now feature, you can pretty much accomplish the same 
thing as a short-term auction. When you list your item for sale, set a 
price at which you are willing to sell the item immediately; this is your 
Buy It Now price.
 
✦ Five-day auction: A five-day auction gives you two days more than a 
three-day auction and two days less than a seven-day auction. That’s 
about the size of it. If you just want an extended weekend auction or 
your item is a hot one, use it. Five-day auctions are useful during holiday 
rushes, when gift buying is the main reason for bidding.
 
✦ Seven-day auction: Tried-and-true advertising theory says that the 
longer you advertise your item, the more people will see it. On eBay, 
this means that you have more opportunities for people to bid on it. The 
seven-day auction is a staple for the bulk of eBay vendors. Seven days is 
long enough to cover weekend browsers and short enough to keep the 
auction interesting.
 
✦ Ten-day auction: Many veteran eBay sellers swear by the ten-day auc-
tion. Sure, eBay charges you an extra $.40 for the privilege, but the extra 
three days of exposure (it can encompass two weekends) can easily net 
you more than your extra cost in profits.
 
 A ten-day auction is good for special collectibles or an expensive item 
that normally doesn’t get listed on the site by the hundred. Putting up a 
ten-day auction (start Friday night so you get exposure over two week-
ends) is a near-perfect way to attract bidders.

Knowing What Day to End an Auction
 
Your auction closes exactly one, three, five, seven, or ten days — to the 
minute — after you start the auction. Try not to begin your auctions when 
you’re up late at night and can’t sleep: You don’t want your auction to end at 
two in the morning when no one else is awake to bid on it. If you can’t sleep, 
prepare your listings ahead of time with the Turbo Lister program (which I 
discuss in Chapter 3) and upload them for future launching when the world 
is ready to shop.
The specific day you close your auction can also be important. eBay is full of 
weekend browsers, so including a weekend of browsing in your auction time 
is a definite plus. Often, auctions that end late Sunday afternoon through 
Monday close with high bids.
You’ll need to do some research to determine the best times to run your 
auctions and for how long. In Book VIII, Chapter 3, I show you how to com-
bine your search-engine research with a special kind of statistical counter 
to help you identify the best closing time for your items. (See Chapters 1 
and 2 in Book II for the details about using the search engine as a valuable 
research tool.) The best person to figure out the closing information for your 
auctions is you. Use the tools and over time you’ll work out a pattern that 
works best for you.
Knowing What Day to End an Auction
Back when eBay counted its listings by the hundreds (and then low thou-
sands), it clearly made a difference what day of the week you chose to end 
an auction. That is, when the number of buyers and sellers on eBay was rela-
tively small, matching your auction time with the bidders’ online habits was 
important. Now that eBay spawns as many as 18 million listings a day with 
countless buyers and lookie-loos visiting the site, you find the eBay netizens 
looking for bargains at virtually all hours of the day and night. So for a tradi-
tional auction, you can choose almost any ending time and know that you’ll 
still have some healthy bidding action.
 
The wildcards in the mix are the Buy It Now and fixed-price transactions, 
which have become wildly popular — and successful. Although they don’t 
always follow a daily pattern of sales, they can still follow the preferred auc-
tion-ending days you find in this section.
To figure out when to end an auction, you need to know when to start it. 
Figures 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 are the top preferred timelines for running a sale 
on eBay.

the top-ranked ending day for auctions by eBay sellers.

Knowing What Day to End an Auction
I can’t list everyone’s opinions on the subject — that would probably con-
fuse you anyway — so here are the item-ending days ranked in order from 
most to least popular:
1.  Sunday
2.  Monday
3.  Thursday
4.  Tuesday
5.  Wednesday
6.  Saturday
7.  Friday
 
Be sure to coordinate these dates with what you sell. Some buyers (say, men 
who buy golf goods during lunch hour and women who buy collectibles 
while their husbands are out golfing on weekends) can throw these days a 
curve.
 
A definite time not to close your auctions? Experience has taught many 
sellers never to close an auction on a national holiday. Memorial Day, the 
Fourth of July, and Veteran’s Day may be bonanza sales days for retail 
shops, but eBay auction items closing on these days go at bargain prices.
Just before the Pirates of the Caribbean movie 
premiered, Disneyland gave out exclusive 
movie posters to their visitors. My daughter, 
savvy eBayer that she is, snagged several 
copies to sell on the site. She listed them (one 
at a time) when the movie opened and couldn’t 
get more than the starting bid, $9.99, for each 
of them.
When we searched eBay for pirates poster, 
we found that the very same posters with a 
misspelled title, Pirates of the Carribean, were 
selling for as high as $30 each. We immediately 
changed her auctions to have the more popular 
(misspelling) Carribean in the title and quickly 
saw those dollar signs! After selling out her ini-
tial stock, she found another seller who had ten 
for sale — in one auction — with the proper 
spelling in the title. She bought those as well 
(for $5 each) and sold them with misspelled 
titles in the listing for between $15 and $27!
Pirates of the Caribbean, er, “Carribean”?

Knowing What Time to Start Your Auction
Knowing What Time to Start Your Auction
The only way to figure out when to end your auction is by planning when 
to start it. An auction beginning at 12:00 will end at that same time on the 
ending day.
eBay time is military time in the Pacific time zone. Table 2-2 converts the 
eBay clock to real time for your time zone. Make a photocopy of this table 
and keep it by your computer. (Even after all these years, it still takes too 
much time to decipher eBay time without a printed chart.)
If you ever need to check your time zone or want to know exactly what time 
it is in eBay-land, point your browser to
/viv.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?EbayTime
and you’ll see the map pictured in Figure 2-4.

eBay time; check the table for a translation):
1.  18:00 to 22:00
2.  21:00 to 0:00
3.  15:00 to 18:00
4.  13:00 to 16:00
Here are the worst eBay times to end an auction:

Selling Even More with Fixed-Price Sales
Selling Even More with Fixed-Price Sales
Recently eBay has put a lot behind new item and fixed-price sales. In the new 
era of e-commerce, many people like to come to a site to buy items outright 
at a given price as well as participate in auctions. 
eBay Stores are a great way to have fixed-price items, but to get a better 
placement in eBay’s search engine, you can list fixed-price items on the regu-
lar eBay site.
Fixed-price listings have a different pricing structure on the site. Any fixed-
price listing — regardless of starting price or number of items for sale — 
costs 35 cents for a 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, or 30-day listing, or a Good Till Cancelled 
listing. Great news, eh? If you’re selling media, the cost is even lower. Any 
items in the categories of Books, Music, DVDs & Movies and Video Games 
are charged only 15 cents per listing for the same durations!
Sounds great, huh? Well, there’s a catch (you knew there’d be a catch, didn’t 
you?). Final Value Fees for these items are higher, and the fees vary by cat-
egory. Table 2-3 gives you the details.

Making Money in Other eBay Zones
There’s more to eBay than just the auction site. Don’t lose a selling 
opportunity by not checking into the other viable areas described in this 
section.
eBay’s half brother: Half.com
Half.com, founded in July of 1999, was the brainchild of Joshua Kopelman. 
He observed the insufficiencies of retailing in the area of used mass-market 
merchandise and went to work on developing a new outlet for secondhand 
merchandise. Kopelman’s site was so successful that eBay bought out Half.
com after its first year of business. Half.com ranks as one of the Internet’s 
most visited sites.
Selling at Half.com is different from selling at your eBay (or other online) 
personal store because you’re selling in a fixed-price marketplace. Your item 
is listed head-to-head against more of the same item from other sellers. Half.
com isn’t a home for your store; you might say that each item has its own 
store, complete with competing sellers.
The Half.com home page is shown in Figure 2-5. Half.com currently lists 
more than 15 million items, including books, CDs, DVDs, video games, and 
game systems. Because Half.com is part of eBay, your feedback follows you 
to the site.

From a seller’s point of view, the best features of Half.com are these:
 
✦ The item listing is free.
 
✦ The item stays on the site until the item is sold or until you take it down.
Just like your My eBay Page, half.com has a very user-friendly area where 
you can control your selling. You’ll find it under My account: Inventory. Take 
a look at how clear cut it is in Figure 2-6. You can change the prices for your 
books right there — no need to access individual listings!
 
Figure 2-6: 
My Half.com 
Inventory 
page.
 
Half.com charges a commission after your item sells, as shown in Table 2-4. 
Commissions for items sold in the Books, Music, Movies, Games, and Game 
System categories are a percentage of the selling price of the item. The ship-
ping cost is not added to the selling price.

Making Money in Other eBay Zones
To list an item for sale at Half.com, you first need to locate the item’s 
Universal Product Code (UPC) or, if you’re selling a book, the International 
Standard Book Number (ISBN). In case you’re wondering what an ISBN is, 
turn this book over and find the bar code on the back. The number written 
above it is this book’s ISBN.
 
If you don’t want to bring all your books, CDs, movies, or games to your 
computer, scan your items using an inexpensive handheld scanner (make 
sure it’s a model that holds memory).
When someone searches on Half.com for an item, such as a book, a listing 
of all sellers who are selling that book appears. The listings are classified by 
the book’s condition — categorized as Like New or Very Good — depending 
on what the seller entered. The list price of the book is included, as well as a 
comparison of selling prices on the eBay site.
 
If you don’t have an item’s outer box with the UPC, search Half.com from any 
of its pages for your particular item (including its brand name). When your 
search comes up with the exact item, copy down the code number and use it 
with your listing, or click the Sell Your Stuff link on the item page.
You’ll find that by using the UPC or ISBN in your listing, Half.com comes up 
with an image of your item, so you don’t even have to take a picture for your 
sale. When an item is out of print, Half.com may not have an image to upload 
with the listing. In this case, the text Image not available appears in the area 
where the picture would appear. (Half.com allows you to upload your own 
picture.) If your item doesn’t have a code, you can upload your own photo 
and even add a 1000-word description. Half.com has an amazing database of 
items in the books, music, movie, and video game categories to help you find 
the specs of whatever item you want to list.
When a prospective buyer searches and finds an item for books or coded 
items, a box appears in the corner of the listing with a price comparison of 
the item from various other online sales sites.
For example, if you’re selling a paperback book for $37.00, here’s what happens:
 
1. Buyer buys your paperback, which is priced at $37.00.
 
2. Half.com charges the buyer $3.49 for Media Mail shipping and handling 
costs.
 
3. You pay Half.com a 15% commission, which is $5.55 on a $37.00 item.
 
4. You get a shipping reimbursement of $2.64.
 
 See Table 2-5 for Half.com shipping reimbursements.
 
5. Half.com sends you a net payment of $34.09.

Automotive? Go eBay Motors
Anything and everything automotive can go in the eBay Motors category 
(see Figure 2-7), and it will sell like giant tires at a monster truck rally. 
Following are just a few of the car-related items that fit in this category.

Car parts
Got used car parts? eBay has an enormous market in used car parts. One 
seller I know goes to police impound sales and buys wrecks — just to get 
some valuable parts that he can resell on eBay.
New car parts are in demand, too. If your local auto-parts store is blasting 
out door handles for a 1967 Corvette (a vehicle for which it’s hard to find 
parts), it wouldn’t hurt to pick up a few. Sooner or later, someone’s bound 
to search eBay looking for them. If you’re lucky enough to catch the trend, 
you’ll make a healthy profit.
Cars
Yes, you can sell cars on eBay. In fact, used-car sales have skyrocketed 
online thanks to all the people who find eBay to be a trusted place to buy 
and sell used vehicles. Selling vehicles on eBay is a natural business for you 
if you have access to good used cars, work as a mechanic, or have a contact 
at a dealership who lets you sell cars on eBay for a commission or on a 
consignment basis. (For the ins and outs of consignment selling, check out 
Book IV, Chapter 3.)
To complete your sale, eBay Motors features a free passenger-vehicle pur-
chase protection that covers up to $20,000 (with a $100 buyer co-pay should 
you have a claim), one-click access to Carfax reports, vehicle inspection 
and escrow services, and vehicle shipping quotes from Dependable Auto 
Shippers. Access eBay Motors and its services from the eBay home page or 
by going directly to www.ebaymotors.com.
Selling a car on eBay Motors is a bit different from selling on regular eBay, 
mainly in the area of fees. To encourage sellers to list and sell vehicles on 
the site, eBay has set up a tiered system of fees. The first four vehicles you 
list in a 12-month period are charged no listing fees, but have a slightly 
higher transaction fee when the sale is successful. Take a look at Tables 2-6 
and 2-7 for significant differences.

*There is no final value fee for selling on eBay Motors. Instead, you pay the transaction service fee 
when your item gets a bid (or if you’ve used a reserve, when bidding meets your reserve price).
Although many people who have found the vehicle of their dreams on eBay 
are more than happy to take a one-way flight to the vehicle location and 
drive it home, shipping a vehicle is a reasonably-priced alternative. You can 
make arrangements to ship a car quickly and simply.
Here are just a few things to keep in mind if you plan to sell cars on eBay:
 
✦ To sell a vehicle on eBay Motors, you must enter the Vehicle 
Identification Number (VIN) on the Sell Your Item page. This way, pro-
spective buyers can access a Carfax report to get an idea of the history 
of the car.
 
✦ An item that you’ve listed on eBay Motors will appear in any search, 
whether a potential buyer conducts a regular eBay search or a search in 
eBay Motors.
 
✦ If your reserve isn’t met in an eBay Motors auction, you may still offer 
the vehicle to the high bidder through the Second Chance option. 
(More information on that later in this chapter.) You may also reduce 
your reserve during the auction if you feel you’ve set your target price 
too high.
Real estate: Not quite an auction
eBay Real Estate at pages.ebay.com/realestate isn’t quite an auc-
tion. Because of the wide variety of laws governing the sale of real estate, 
eBay auctions of real property are not legally binding offers to buy and sell. 
However, putting your real estate on eBay (see Figure 2-8) is an excellent 
way to advertise and attract potential buyers. When the auction ends, nei-
ther party is obligated (as they are in other eBay auctions) to complete the 
real estate transaction. The buyer and seller must get together to consum-
mate the deal.

section.
 
Nonetheless, eBay real estate sales are popular and the gross sales are grow-
ing by leaps and bounds. You don’t have to be a professional real estate 
agent to use this category, although it may help when it comes to closing 
the deal. If you know land and your local real estate laws, eBay gives you the 
perfect venue to subdivide those 160 acres in Wyoming that Uncle Regis left 
you in his will.
For less than the cost of a newspaper ad, you can sell your home, condo, 
land, or even timeshare on eBay Real Estate in the auction format. You can 
also choose to list your property in an ad format, accepting not bids but 
inquiries from prospective buyers from around the world. On the Sell Your 
Item form, you must specify special information about your piece of real 
estate.
In Tables 2-8 and 2-9, I provide a listing of fees that you can expect to 
encounter on eBay Real Estate.

There are a lot of shoulds in this world. You should do this and you should 
do that. I don’t know who is in charge of the shoulds, but certain things just 
make life work better. If you follow the advice on these pages, your eBay 
business will thrive with a minimum of anguish. If you’ve ever had a listing 
pulled by eBay, you know that anguish firsthand and don’t want to have it 
again.
In the real world, we have to take responsibility for our own actions. If we 
buy a television set for $25 from some guy selling them out of the back of a 
truck, who do we have to blame when we take it home and it doesn’t work? 
You get what you pay for, and you have no consumer protection from a 
seller of possibly “hot” TVs. Responsible consumerism is every buyer’s job. 
Lawsuit upon lawsuit gets filed — and some are won — when someone feels 
they’ve been ripped off, but my best advice is that if you stay clean in your 
online business, you’ll keep clean.
eBay is a community, and the community thrives on the five basic values 
below:
 
✦ We believe people are basically good.
 
✦ We believe everyone has something to contribute.

292
Selling by the Rules
 
✦ We believe that an honest, open environment can bring out the best 
in people.
 
✦ We recognize and respect everyone as a unique individual.
 
✦ We encourage you to treat others the way that you want to be treated.
eBay is committed to these values, and it says so right on its Web site. eBay 
believes that community members should “honor these values — whether 
buying, selling, or chatting.” So should we all.
Is what you want to sell legal?
Although eBay is based in California and therefore must abide by California 
law, sellers do business all over the United States. Therefore, items sold at 
eBay must be governed by the laws of every other state as well. As a seller, 
you’re ultimately responsible for both the legality of the items you sell and 
the way that you transact business on eBay. Yes, you’re able to sell thou-
sands of different items on eBay. But do you know what you aren’t allowed 
to sell?
 
The eBay User Agreement outlines the rules and regulations regarding what 
you can and can’t sell, as well as all aspects of doing business on eBay. If you 
haven’t read it in a while, do so. You can find it at the following address:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html
These policies can change from time to time. As an active seller, you should 
make sure that you’re notified of any changes. You’ll be notified when eBay 
makes changes to the User Agreement, through your eBay Message Center.
By now, you should have a firm grasp of the rules and regulations for list-
ing auctions. But in addition to knowing the rules for listing items, you must 
consider the items themselves. In this section, I detail the three categories 
of items to be wary of: prohibited, questionable, and potentially infringing. 
Some are banned, period. Others fall in a gray area. You’re responsible for 
what you sell, so you’d better know what’s legal and what’s not.
If you’re found in violation of eBay’s listing restrictions, you may be penal-
ized in a variety of ways, including
 
✦ Listing cancellation.
 
✦ Limits on account privileges.
 
✦ Account suspension.
 
✦ Forfeit of eBay fees on cancelled listings.
 
✦ Loss of PowerSeller status.

Selling by the Rules
 
You may think it’s okay to give away a regulated or banned item as a bonus 
item with your auction. Think again. Even giving away such items for free 
doesn’t save you from potential legal responsibility.
Prohibited and Restricted items
A prohibited item is banned from sale at eBay. You can’t sell a prohibited 
item under any circumstance. Take a look at the following list. A little 
common sense tells you there’s good reason for not selling these items, 
including liability issues for the seller. (For example, what if you sold alcohol 
to a minor? That’s against the law!)
Restricted items involve more shades of gray. They may involve the sale of 
dangerous or sensitive items that may not be prohibited by law. EBay sets 
these limitations as a result of input by members of the eBay Community 
and others. eBay has a strong Offensive Material Policy which covers mer-
chandise that “promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial or religious intol-
erance, or items that promote organizations with such views.” As you can 
imagine, this is a slippery slope for some sellers.

over 21.

Questionable items
Determining whether or not you can sell a questionable item is tricky. Under 
certain circumstances, you may be able to list the item for sale at eBay. To 
fully understand when and if you can list a questionable item, visit the links 
that I highlight in Table 2-10.

Potentially infringing items
Potentially infringing items follow a slippery slope. If you list a potentially 
infringing item, you may infringe on existing copyrights, trademarks, regis-
trations, or the like. Get the idea? These items are prohibited for your own 
protection.

296
Knowing eBay’s Listing Policies
Items falling under the “potentially infringing” category are generally copy-
righted or trademarked items, such as software, promotional items, and 
games. Even using a brand name in your auction as part of a description 
(known as keyword spamming) may get you into trouble.
 
Repeating various un-trademarked keywords can get you in trouble as well. 
eBay permits the use of as many as five synonyms when listing an item for 
sale. A permissible example of this might be: purse, handbag, pocketbook, 
satchel, and bag. Adding many un-trademarked keywords would cause the 
auction to come up in more searches.
Knowing eBay’s Listing Policies
eBay does not sell merchandise. eBay is merely a venue that provides the 
location where others can put on a giant e-commerce party (in other words, 
sell stuff). To provide a safe and profitable venue for its sellers, eBay must 
govern auctions that take place on its site. eBay makes the rules; you and I 
follow the rules. I like to think of eBay as the place that lets you hold your 
senior prom in its gym. When I was in school, my classmates and I had to 
follow the rules or see our prom canceled. If we don’t agree to follow eBay’s 
rules, a safe and trusted eBay community can’t exist.
When alcohol becomes collectible
Many people collect rare and antique bottles 
of liquor or wine. I even sold a bottle of Korbel 
champagne whose bottle artwork was designed 
by Frank Sinatra on eBay in 1998. Korbel bot-
tles have featured artwork by designer Nicole 
Miller and comedienne Whoopi Goldberg as 
well as designs by Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra, 
and Jane Seymour.
People also collect Jim Beam bottles, Dug 
decanters, and miniatures that are even more 
valuable when they’re full. You can sell these 
on eBay as long as you fulfill the following 
requirements:
 ✓ The value of the item is in the collectible 
container, not its contents.
 ✓ The auction description should state that 
the container has not been opened but any 
incidental contents are not intended for 
consumption.
 ✓ The item must not be available at any retail 
outlet, and the container must have a value 
that substantially exceeds the current retail 
price of the alcohol in the container.
 ✓ Sellers should take steps to ensure that 
the buyer of these collectibles is of lawful 
age in the buyer’s and seller’s jurisdiction 
(generally 21 years old).

Knowing eBay’s Listing Policies
eBay has some hard-and-fast rules about listing your items. One rule is that 
you must list your item in the appropriate category (that only makes sense). 
In this section, I highlight a few other rules that you should keep in mind 
when listing. What I discuss isn’t a definitive list of eBay listing policies and 
rules. Take time to familiarize yourself with the User Agreement (which 
details all eBay policies and rules) at the following address:
pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html
I recommend that you check the eBay User Agreement regularly for any 
policy changes.
Offer limited choices in your auctions
Your auction must be for one item only: the item that you specifically list in 
your auction. It’s against the rules to give the bidder a choice of completely 
different items in the same listing, but you can offer sizes, colors, or con-
figurations of the same item. eBay protects you with its purchase-protection 
program, which covers all online eBay transactions. When you give your bid-
ders a choice, it’s an illegal sale on eBay and therefore not covered. Anything 
that’s negotiated outside the eBay system can lead to either misrepresenta-
tion or fraud. You don’t want to be caught up in that sort of grief and misery.
If eBay catches you offering a choice, they will end the auction and credit the 
insertion fee to your account.
No limit on duplicate listings
Remember the old supply-and-demand theory from your economics class? 
When people list the same items repeatedly, they drive down the item’s 
going price while ruining all the other sellers’ opportunities to sell the item 
during that time frame.
eBay allows you to list as many identical listings as you want... and why not? 
You pay a separate listing fee for every item. The powers that be at eBay 
aren’t daft; they know that buyers using Search would be deluged with these 
identical item listings from the same seller. But sellers who want to “game” 
the system in this way, by listing a huge number of the same item, need to 
think twice. eBay policy states that the display of multiple identical items 
from the same seller will be limited to one in Search results. So what’s the 
point?
If you’re going to list an item that many times, at the very least be sure to 
list it in different categories. That’s a rule, but it also makes sense. Nothing 
drives down the price of an item faster than closing identical auctions, one 
after another, in the same category. eBay also requires that you list your 
item in a category that’s relevant to it.

298
Knowing eBay’s Listing Policies
 
If you have multiple copies of something, a better solution is to run a 
multiple-item (Dutch) auction for the total number of items you have for 
sale. Or perhaps run two multiple-item auctions in different (but appropriate) 
categories.
 
If you list many identical auctions, eBay will show only one at a time in 
search.
State it up front: Presale and drop-shipping listings
eBay doesn’t like it when you try to sell something that’s not in your hands 
(known as a presale listing — whether or not it’s a drop-ship item). In many situ-
ations, being the first seller to put a popular item up for sale can get you some 
high bids. And if you can guarantee in your auction description that the item 
will be available to ship within 30 days of the purchase or the auction closing, 
you can run a presale. However, if you’re not completely sure that you’ll have 
the item in time, I don’t recommend that you even attempt a presale listing.
If you know that you’ll have the item to ship — and it won’t be lost on its 
way to you — you may list the item with the following requirement: You 
must state in your auction description that the item is a presale. You’ll 
The Chanel-style purse
I once listed a quilted leather women’s purse 
that had a gold chain strap, which I described 
as a Chanel-style purse. Within two hours, I 
received an informational alert from the eBay 
listing police. I described the item to the best 
of my ability, but found that it became a poten-
tially infringing item. 
My use of the brand name Chanel caused my 
auction to come under the violation of key-
word spamming (more on that in the section 
“Potentially infringing items”).
In its informational alert, eBay described my 
violation:
 
 “Keyword spamming is the practice of 
adding words, including brand names, 
which do not directly describe the item you 
are selling. The addition of these words 
may not have been intentional, but includ-
ing them in this manner diverts members to 
your listing inappropriately.”
Ooops! You can see how my ingenuous listing 
was actually a violation of policy. Think twice 
before you add brand names to your auc-
tion description. Thankfully, the eBay police 
judge each violation on a case-by-case basis. 
Because my record is clear, I merely got a rep-
rimand. Had my violation been more deliberate, 
I might have been suspended.

also have to use a little HTML here because the text must be coded with an 
HTML font no smaller than font size 3. The presale policy also applies to 
drop-shipping.
 
Before you set up such an auction, check out the Federal Trade Commission 
30-day rule covering these matters, which you can find at the following 
address:
www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/mailorder.htm
Ix-nay on the bonuses, giveaways, raffles, or prizes
Because eBay sells to every state in the United States, it must follow explicit 
laws governing giveaways and prizes. Each state has its own set of rules and 
regulations, so eBay doesn’t allow individual sellers to come up with their 
own promotions.
If your auction violates this rule, eBay might end it and refund your 
listing fee.
The eBay Verified Rights Owner program
eBay can’t possibly check every auction for 
authenticity. But to help protect trademarked 
items, it formed the Verified Rights Owner 
(VeRO) program.
Trademark and copyright owners expend large 
amounts of energy to develop and maintain 
control over the quality of their products. If 
you buy a “designer” purse from a guy on the 
street for $20, it’s probably counterfeit, so don’t 
go selling it on eBay.
eBay works with VeRO program participants to 
educate the community about such items. They 
work also with verified owners of trademarks 
and copyrights to remove auctions that infringe 
on their products. If eBay doesn’t close a suspi-
cious or blatantly infringing auction, then both 
you and eBay are liable for the violation.
To participate in the VeRO program, the owners 
of copyrights and trademarks must supply eBay 
with proof of ownership. To view the VeRO 
program information, go to

vero-rights-owner.html
To report a violation of something, you have 
legal rights to download this form on eBay:

Note: eBay cooperates with law enforcement 
and may give your name and street address to 
a VeRO program member.

Search and browse manipulation 
by keyword spamming
Keyword spamming happens when you add words, usually brand names, 
to your auction description that don’t describe what you’re selling (for 
example, describing that little black dress as Givenchy-style when Givenchy 
has nothing to do with it). Keyword spamming manipulates the eBay search 
engine by including an unrelated item in the listing for a copyrighted or 
trademarked item, and then diverting bidders to an auction of other mer-
chandise. Sellers use keyword spamming to pull viewers to their auctions 
after viewers have searched for the brand name. To attract attention to their 
listings, some sellers use not or like along with the brand name, such as like 
Givenchy.
Here are the problems with keyword spamming:
 
✦ It’s a listing violation and causes your auction to fall under potentially 
infringing items for sale on eBay. The wording you choose when you run 
this kind of auction manipulates the eBay search engine and prospective 
bidders.
 
✦ It’s frustrating to the potential buyers trying to use the search engine to 
find a particular item, and unfair to other eBay sellers who’ve properly 
listed their items.
Keyword spamming can take many forms. Some merely mislead the 
prospective bidder while others are legal infringements. A few of the most 
common are
 
✦ Superfluous brand names in the title or item description.
 
✦ Using something like “not brand X” in the title or item description.
 
✦ Improper trademark usage.
Preselling: Not worth the hassle
A seller I once knew presold Beanie Babies 
on eBay. She had a regular source that sup-
plied her when the new toys came out, so 
she fell into a complacent attitude about list-
ing presales. Then her supplier didn’t get the 
shipment. Motivated by the need to protect her 
feedback rating (and by the fear that she’d be 
accused of fraud), she ran all over town des-
perately trying to get the Beanies she needed 
to fill her orders. The Beanies were so rare that 
she ended up spending several hundred dollars 
more than what she had originally sold the toys 
for, just to keep her customers happy.

✦ Hidden text — white text on a white background or hidden text in HTML

✦ Drop-down lists.

Limited linking from your auctions
Few issues set sellers to arguing more than eBay’s rules on linking. In your 
auction item description, you can use the following links:
 
✦ One link to an additional page that gives further information about the 
item you’re selling
 
✦ A link that opens an e-mail window on the prospective buyer’s browser 
so that the buyer can send you an e-mail
 
✦ Links to more photo images of the item you’re selling
 
✦ Links to your other auctions on eBay and your eBay store listings
 
✦ One link to your About Me page, besides the link next to your user ID 
that eBay provides
 
Now here’s the “big secret” from one of those get-rich-quick, high-dollar 
eBay seminars. You can link to your own, personal e-commerce Web site 
from eBay. But only from your About Me page!

Chapter 3: Listing Your 
Items for Sale
In This Chapter
✓ Getting ready to set up your auction
✓ Filling in the Sell an Item form
✓ Starting your auction
✓ Making changes after your auction has started
A
re you ready to make some money? Yes? (Call it an inspired guess.) 
Are you on the threshold of adding your items to the hundreds of 
thousands that go up for auction at eBay every day? Some auctions are so 
hot that the sellers can quadruple their investments. Other items, unfortu-
nately, are so stone-cold that they may not even register a single bid.
In this chapter, I explain all the facets of the Sell an Item page — the page 
you fill out to get your auction going on eBay. You get some advice that can 
increase your odds of making money, and you find out the best way to posi-
tion your item so buyers can see it and bid on it. I also show you how to 
modify, relist, and end your auction.
Getting Ready to List Your Item
After you decide what you want to sell, find out as much as you can about it 
and conduct a little market research. Then you should have a good idea of 
the item’s popularity and value.
Before you list your item, make sure that you have the following bases 
covered:
 
✦ The specific category under which you want the item listed: Ask your 
friends or family where they’d look for such an item — and remember 
the categories you saw most frequently when you conducted your 
market research with the eBay search function.

304
Getting Ready to List Your Item
 
 To find out which category will pay off best for your item, run a search 
and then select the Completed listings option. See how many fixed-price 
listings and auctions of that item are running (and whether people are 
bidding on it). Then scroll down to the left of the page and, under Seach 
options, click the box next to Completed listings and perform your search. 
Sort your results by Price: highest first, and then look over the transactions 
to see which categories they’re listed in. For more information on how to 
get ahead of the crowd through eBay’s search, visit Book I.
 
✦ What you want to say in your auction item description: Jot down your 
ideas. Take a good look at your item and make a list of keywords that 
describe your item. Keywords are single descriptive words that can 
include
 
• Brand names
 
• Size of the item (citing measurements if appropriate)
 
• Age or date of manufacture
 
• Condition
 
• Rarity
 
• Color
 
• Size
 
• Material (fabric)
 
• . . . and more
 
✦ Get an idea of what picture (or pictures) of your item you want to put 
inside your description: Pictures help sell items, but you don’t have to 
use them if you’re selling media items (eBay will supply them for you). 
(If you want to know more about using pictures in your auctions, see 
Book V.)
 
✦ The price at which you think you can sell the item: Be as realistic as 
you can. (That’s where the market research comes in.)
The Sell an Item form is where your auction is born. Filling out your auction 
paperwork requires a couple of minutes of clicking, typing, and answering all 
kinds of questions. The good news is that when you’re finished, your auction 
is up and running.
 
Before you begin, you have to be registered with eBay as a seller. If you still 
need to do so, go to Book I and fill out the preliminary cyber-paperwork. If 
you’ve registered but haven’t provided eBay with your financial information 
(credit card or checking account), you’ll be asked for this information before 
you proceed to sell. Fill in the data on the secure form. Then you’re ready to 
set up your listing.

Deciding on a Sales Format
Just like the dizzying menu in a Chinese restaurant, you have four ways to 
sell an item on eBay. Four ways may not seem to be very dizzying, unless 
you’re trying to decide just which format is the best for you.
Here’s what you need to know about each type:
 
✦ Online auction: This is the tried-and-true traditional sale format on 
eBay. You can combine this auction with the Buy It Now feature, for 
those who want the item immediately. Often, if you’re selling a collect-
ible item, letting it go to auction may net you a much higher profit — 
remember to do your research before listing.
 
✦ Fixed-price listing: A fixed-price sale is easy for the buyer to complete; 
it’s just like shopping at the corner store. The only problem is that many 
potential buyers may lean toward an auction because of the perception 
that they may get a better deal.
 
✦ Sell in your eBay store: Book VIII, Chapter 6 covers eBay stores — a 
convenient place to sell items related to your auctions or fixed-price 
items.
 
✦ Advertise real estate: If you don’t want to put your property up for auc-
tion and you’d like to correspond with the prospective buyers, this is 
the option for you.
Say, for example, that you want to list a good old-fashioned eBay auction. 
You want to sell your item for a fixed price but are also willing to let it go to 
auction.
To find eBay’s Sell an Item page from the eBay home page, you can use 
either of these methods:
 
✦ Click the Sell link on the navigation bar at the top of the page, and you’re 
whisked to the Sell an Item page. eBay allows you to input keywords 
which help you select your category and download the Sell an Item page 
in seconds. 
 
✦ You can also start your listing from your My eBay page. Just look under 
the Favorite Links and scroll down the page to the Sell My Item link.
Getting Your Sales Specifics In Order
Yes, the Sell an Item form looks daunting, but filling out its many sections 
doesn’t take as long as you may think. Some of the questions you’re asked 
aren’t things you even have to think about; just click an answer and off you 
go. Other questions ask you to type information. Don’t sweat a thing; all the 
answers you need are right here. 

306
Getting Your Sales Specifics In Order
When listing your item, here’s the info you’re asked to fill out (each of these 
items is discussed in detail later in this chapter):
 
✦ User ID and password: If you’re not signed in, you need to do so before 
you list an item for sale.
 
✦ Category: The category where you’ve decided to list your item 
(required).
 
✦ Title: The name of your item (required).
 
✦ Description: What you want to tell eBay buyers about your item 
(required). After you’ve written a brilliant title for your listing, prospec-
tive buyers click and scroll down to your description. Do they have to 
dodge through pointless verbiage, losing interest along the way? Or do 
you get right down to business and state the facts about your item?
 
✦ eBay Picture Services or image URL: The Web address of any pictures 
you want to add (optional). Note that you get a free preview picture at 
the top of your auction. Book V has more information on using images in 
your auction.
 
✦ The Gallery: You can add your item’s picture to eBay’s photo gallery. 
eBay charges nothing for this service, so why not do it?. (You can find 
more on the other Gallery options later in this chapter.)
 
✦ Gallery image URL: The Web address of the JPG image you want to 
place in the gallery (optional). If you’re using eBay Picture Services, the 
first photo you upload is resized for the Gallery.
 
✦ Item location: The region, city, and country from which the item will be 
shipped (required).
 
✦ Quantity: The number of items you’re offering in this auction is always 
one, unless you plan to run a multiple-item, or Dutch, auction (required).
 
✦ Minimum bid: The starting price you set (required).
 
✦ Duration: The number of days you want the listing to run (required).
 
✦ Reserve price: The hidden target price you set. This is the price that 
must be met before this item can be sold (optional). eBay charges you a 
fee for this feature.
 
✦ Private auction: You can keep the identity of all bidders secret with 
this option (optional). This type of auction is used only in rare circum-
stances (such as when you’re selling psychic readings and your custom-
ers might not want their proclivities made public).
 
✦ Buy It Now: You can sell your item directly to the first buyer who meets 
this price (optional).

Book III
Chapter 3

307
Getting Your Sales Specifics In Order
 
✦ List item in two categories: If you want to double your exposure, you 
can list your item in two categories. Note that double exposure equals 
double your listing fees (optional).
 
✦ Home page featured: You can place your auction in a premium view-
ing section, with the possibility that your listing will cycle through the 
direct links on the front page (optional). eBay charges from $39.95 for 
this feature.
 
✦ Featured Plus!: You can have your auction appear at the top of the cat-
egory in which you list it (optional). eBay charges $19.95 for this feature.
 
✦ Highlight: Your item title is highlighted in the auction listings and 
search listings with a lilac-colored band, which may draw eBay mem-
bers’ eyes right to your auction (optional). eBay charges $5 for this fea-
ture.
 
✦ Border: Within the listings, your item will be surrounded by a bordered 
box. Not a bad option for $3.
 
✦ Boldface title: A selling option to make your item listing stand out. eBay 
charges $1 for this feature (optional).
 
✦ Free counter: If you want to avail yourself of view counters, indicate so 
here (optional).
 
✦ Ship-to locations: Here’s where you can indicate where you’re willing to 
ship an item. If you don’t want the hassle of shipping out of the United 
States, check only that option. You can select individual countries as 
well (optional).
 
 You may want to consider whether you really want to be in the interna-
tional shipping business. Buyers pick up the tab, but you have to deal 
with customs forms and post office paperwork. Depending on what 
you’re selling, shipping internationally just may not be worth the invest-
ment in extra time. But remember that if you don’t ship internationally, 
you’re blocking a bunch of possible high bidders. Give it a try and see 
how it works for you.
 
✦ How you will ship: Select the options that apply as to how you plan to 
ship the item.
eBay is a person-to-person marketplace. 
Although many sellers are businesses (like 
you), the perception is that sellers on eBay are 
individuals (versus businesses) earning a living. 
The homespun personal approach goes a long 
way to being successful when you’re selling on 
eBay. One of the reasons many buyers come to 
eBay is that they want to support the individu-
als who have the gumption to start their own 
small enterprise on the site.
Meeting your customers

308
Selecting a Category: The How and Why
 
✦ Shipping and handling charges: When prospective buyers know the 
shipping cost in advance (assuming it’s a realistic price), they’re more 
likely to bid right then and there. If they have to e-mail you with ques-
tions, they may find another auction for the same item — with reason-
able shipping — and bid on that one. Winning bidders can pay you 
instantly through PayPal when they have all the costs. See information 
on eBay’s handy shipping calculator, later in this chapter.
 
✦ Payment instructions: Here’s the place you optionally put any after-sale 
information. If you want them to pay in a different manner, mention that 
as well. This information appears at the top of your sale when the sale is 
completed, at the bottom of the auction while it’s active, and in the end-
of-auction e-mail.
 
✦ PayPal and immediate payment: Fill out this area if you want to require 
the high bidder to pay through PayPal immediately when using Buy 
It Now. Add the Immediate Payment option if you know the shipping 
amount and would like the winner to pay with a click of the mouse 
(optional).
 
Since I’m talking here about listing an item for sale, I briefly go over some 
high points on strategies — but be sure you also check out Chapter 1 to get 
some serious insight on listing strategies.
Selecting a Category: The How and Why
Many eBay sellers will tell you that selecting the exact category isn’t crucial 
to achieving the highest price for your item — and they’re right. The bulk of 
buyers (who know what they’re looking for) just input search keywords into 
eBay’s search box and look for their items. Potential buyers, though, will 
select a category and — just as if they were going to the mall — peruse the 
items and see whether one strikes their fancy.
On the first page of the Sell an Item form, you need to select the main cat-
egory for your item. After you select your main category, you land on the 
official working portion of the Sell an Item page.
With tens of thousands of categories, finding the right place for your item 
can be daunting. You need to apply some marketing techniques when decid-
ing where to place your auctions. You can list an item in two categories, but 
you have to pay double for that. Does your budget allow for it?
Consider these ideas and techniques for finding the right category for 
your item:

Selecting a Category: The How and Why
 
✦ Check out other sellers’ successes: To find where other sellers have 
successfully sold items that are similar to yours and see the prices the 
items sold for, you can perform a completed item search from the More 
Search Options page. In the Search box, type your item keywords, select 
the box to search Completed and then indicate to have your results 
sorted by highest prices first. After you have your results, select the 
completed listings with the highest priced bids. At the top of the auction 
page, you’ll see the listed category. You may find that your item is listed 
successfully in more than one category.
 
✦ Find out who’s currently selling your item (and where): Check the 
active listings; are lots of people selling your item? If you see that you’re 
one of forty or fifty selling the item, you need to get creative as to where 
to list yours. Evaluate the item and its potential buyers. In what catego-
ries would someone shopping for your item search?
 
 Here’s where your creativity can come into play. Who says that a box of 
Blue Dog (the famous doggie icon painted by Cajun artist George 
Rodrigue) notecards belongs only in Everything Else: Gifts & Occasions: 
Greeting Cards: Other Cards? If you use the Find Suggested Categories 
tool (in a yellow shaded box) in the upper-right corner of the Select 
Category area, you may find some other creative places to list your item.
 
✦ Use subcategories to catch in-the-know buyers: Most bidders scan for 
specific items in subcategories. For example, if you’re selling a Bakelite 
fruit pin, don’t just list it under Jewelry; keep narrowing your choices. In 
this case, you can put it in a costume jewelry category that’s especially 
for Bakelite. I guarantee that the real Bakelite jewelry collectors out 
there know where to look to find the jewelry they love.
As part of the Sell an Item form, eBay gives you a tool to find where the 
bulk of sellers are selling your item. The first thing you can do is to put 
your keywords (three or four) in the List Your Item for Sale intro box and 
click Start Selling. Figure 3-1 shows you how easy it is to see where your 
item is being sold.

as shown in Figure 3-2.

You can also select your own category by using the standard category selec-
tion tool, just click the Browse Categories tab. eBay offers you a wealth of 
choices in a handy point-and-click way. If you’re unfamiliar with the types of 
items you can actually find in those categories, you may want to check out 
the category before you choose one to describe your item. Figure 3-3 shows 
you how to narrow down the subcategory listings on the Sell an Item page.

Selecting a Category: The How and Why
To select a category, here’s the drill:
 
1. Click one of the main categories.
 
 On the next pane, you see a list of subcategories.
 
2. Select the most appropriate subcategory.
 
 eBay makes it easy to narrow the category of your item: Just keep 
clicking until you hit the end of the line.
The Internet is crowded with items for sale. 
Many major portals seem to now include auc-
tions as part of their site. You wonder, should 
you sell there? The bottom line is that most 
bidders go to eBay. Why? Because more com-
puters and electronics are sold on eBay than 
at Buy.com; more used cars are sold on eBay 
than at Autotrader; and more toys are probably 
sold at eBay than at KBKids. Even the United 
States post office has found a niche on eBay, 
selling the contents of undeliverable packages 
in odd lots.
Whether you’re selling auto parts, toys, fine art, 
or land, you too must find your niche on eBay. 
Sounds easy enough. After all, deciding where 
to put your stuff for sale is straightforward, 
right? Not necessarily. After taking a look at 
the eBay Category Overview page, you can see 
that the inclusion of more than 8000 subcatego-
ries complicates this task.
Consider the example of a Star Trek toy. Star 
Trek toys are becoming increasingly popular 
with the continuing saga in the new series and 
movies. The easy choice is to list the item under 
Toys: Bean Bag Plush: Action Figures: Star 
Trek. But what about the category Collectibles: 
Pop Culture: Science Fiction: Star Trek? This is 
the when you must decide whether you want to 
list in two categories (and pay more) or count 
on the fact that your beautifully written listing 
title will drive those using the search engine 
directly to your item.
So you aren’t into selling Star Trek toys? 
Suppose you’re selling a VHS of the movie The 
Red Violin. Would listing it in Movies: Videos: 
General be the right choice? Or would you hit 
the proper audience of category browsers in 
Music: Musical Instruments: String: Violin, 
Viola? A book on 1960s fashion? Better in 
Books: Antiquarian, Rare: General or in Books: 
Nonfiction: Collectibles? Actually I have my 
best luck going directly to the fans of ’60s 
fashion in the category Collectibles: Vintage 
Clothing, Accessories: Clothing: Women: Other 
Women’s Clothing.
Believe it or not, popularity of categories varies 
from time to time. Potential buyers may search 
one category more than others, and their pref-
erences depend on which way the wind blows. 
News stories, the time of year, hot trends, or 
whether Katie Couric makes a comment about 
something can change a particular category’s 
popularity. Keeping up on these trends is some-
times tough, so you must do some research.
So how can you possibly know the best cat-
egory for your item? Research your items on 
a regular basis by using my favorite tool: the 
awesome eBay search engine. After you’ve 
found the right category for the item you’re 
listing, give it a try. But be sure to occasionally 
try alternatives as well because the popularity 
of different areas of the site can come and go 
with time.

Listing Your Items in Two Categories
 
3. Continue selecting subcategories until you’ve narrowed your item 
listing as much as possible.
 
 You know you’ve come to the last subcategory when you don’t see any 
more right-pointing arrows in the category list.
 
If you’ve chosen to list an item, bid on an item, or even just browse in the 
Everything Else: Mature Audiences category, you need to follow separate, 
specific guidelines because that category contains graphic nudity or sexual 
content that may offend some community members. You must
 
✦ Be at least 18 years of age (but you already know that all eBay 
customers must be 18 or older)
 
✦ Have a valid credit card
 
✦ Complete a waiver stating that you’re voluntarily choosing to access 
adults-only materials
If you have adult or erotica items that you’d like to sell in a private auction, 
see the “I Want to Be Alone: The Private Auction” section, later in this 
chapter.
Listing Your Items in Two Categories
Suppose you’ve found two perfect categories in which to list your item. eBay 
allows you to list an item in two categories, but does that mean it’s the best 
marketing decision for your auction? That depends. When you list an item 
in two categories, you must pay two listing fees. Depending on the time, the 
season, the availability of your item, and how much you paid for it, you may 
or may not have the budget for listing an item twice. In addition, many eBay 
buyers are savvy in their use of the search engine. If they search for your 
item by using the search engine rather than by browsing the categories, list-
ing the item in two categories might be a needless expense.
 
You can change your category mid-listing, starting it in one category and 
ending it in another. And at the end of an auction in which your item doesn’t 
sell, you can use the relisting feature to run the auction again in another 
category.
 
Even when you’ve been selling a particular item for a while — and doing well 
with it — you might be surprised to hear that changing to another related 
category can boost your sales. A little research now and then can go a long 
way to increasing your eBay sales.

Creating the Perfect Item Title
Creating the Perfect Item Title
After you figure out what category you want to list in, eBay wants to get 
down to the nitty-gritty — what the heck to call that thing you’re trying 
to sell.
 
Think of your item title as a great newspaper headline. The most valuable 
real estate on eBay is the 55-character title of your item. The majority of 
buyers do title searches (in my research, around 98% of searches are per-
formed by title only), and that’s where your item must come up to be sold! 
So the onus is on you to give the most essential information right away to 
grab the eye of the reader who’s just browsing. Be clear and informative 
enough to get noticed by eBay’s search engine. Figure 3-4 shows examples of 
good titles. Note how some sellers beefed up the titles by using the Subtitle 
option.
 
Figure 3-4: 
These item 
titles are 
effective 
because 
they’re 
clear, 
concise, 
and easy on 
the eyes.
 
Here are some ideas to help you write your item title:
 
✦ Use the most common name for the item.
 
✦ If the item is rare or hard to find, mention that.
 
✦ Mention the item’s condition and whether it’s new or old.
 
✦ Mention the item’s special qualities, such as its style, model, or edition.
 
✦ Avoid fancy punctuation or unusual characters, such as $, hyphens, and 
L@@K (or WOW), because they just clutter up the title — buyers rarely 
search for them.

314
Creating the Perfect Item Title
 
Don’t put any HTML tags in your title. (HTML stands for HyperText Markup 
Language, which in plain English means that it’s the special code you use to 
create Web pages.) As a matter of fact, despite what you may have been 
told, you don’t need an extensive knowledge of HTML to have successful, 
good-looking auctions on eBay. Later in the chapter, I list a few HTML codes 
to use in your description. And in Book V, I give you some serious HTML 
tutoring and tips on where you can find some easy programs that produce 
the minor HTML coding that you may want to use to dress up your auctions.
Ordinarily, I don’t throw out French phrases just for the fun of it. But when 
making a profit is an issue, I definitely have to agree with the French that 
choosing or not choosing le mot juste can mean the difference between 
having potential bidders merely see your auction and having an all-out bid-
ding war on your hands. Read on for tips about picking the best words to let 
your auction item shine.
Look for a phrase that pays
Here’s a crash course in eBay lingo that can help bring you up to speed on 
attracting buyers to your auction. The following words are used frequently 
in eBay auctions and can do wonders to jump-start your title:
 
✦ Mint
 
✦ One of a kind (OOAK)
 
✦ Vintage
 
✦ Collectible
 
✦ Rare
 
✦ Unique
 
✦ Primitive
 
✦ Well-loved
There’s a science to figuring out the value of a collectible (called grading). 
Do your homework before you assign a grade to your item. If you need more 
information on what these grades actually mean, Book II, Chapter 2 provides 
a translation.
eBay lingo at a glance
The common terms and the phrases just mentioned aren’t the only market-
ing standards you have at your eBay disposal. As eBay has grown, so has the 
lingo that members use as shortcuts to describe their merchandise. Table 
3-1 gives you a handy list of common abbreviations and phrases used to 
describe items. (Hint: “Mint” means “may as well be brand new,” not “cool 
chocolate treat attached.”)

(continued)
Keywords! Keywords! Keywords! I can’t stress 
enough that keywords are essential in your 
title. Keywords are single words that people 
would naturally use to search for an item. For 
example, if you’re selling a shirt, common key-
words for your title might include
 ✓ Color
 ✓ Size
 ✓ Fabric
 ✓ Men’s, women’s, or child’s
 ✓ Manufacturer’s name
 ✓ Is the item NWT (New With Tags)?
Another great place to find common keywords 
searched for on eBay is in eBay’s fairly hidden 
directory of keywords, which is shown in the 
figure. You can find this page at http://

html. In addition, some super programs will 
check your auctions to see which keywords 
are doing the best job for you. Check out Book

Creating the Perfect Item Title
Normally, you can rely on eBay abbreviations to get your point across, but 
make sure that you mean it and that you’re using it accurately. Don’t label 
something MIB (Mint in Box) when it looks like it’s been Mashed in Box. 
You’ll find more eBay abbreviations on my Web site, www.coolebaytools.
com. (Click the Tools tab, and then click the FWIW: eBay Terms link.)
Don’t let your title ruin your listing
Imagine going to a supermarket and asking where you can find the stringy 
stuff that you boil instead of asking where the spaghetti is. You might end up 
with mung bean sprouts — delicious to some, but hardly what you had in 
mind. That’s why you should check and recheck your spelling. Savvy buyers 
use the eBay search engine to find merchandise; if the name of your item is 
spelled wrong, the search engine can’t find it. Poor spelling and incompre-
hensible grammar also reflect badly on you. If you’re in competition with 
another seller, the buyer is likelier to trust the seller hoo nose gud speling.
 
In my travels, I meet so many interesting people with lots of great stories 
about their forays on eBay. One of my favorites is the story told to me by a 
lovely lady in Salt Lake City. She brought to my class her biggest eBay bar-
gain. She won a Shaquille O’Neill signed basketball on eBay for 1 cent! Yep, 
one red cent (plus shipping). I’ll bet that seller had a rude surprise when his 
listing closed! Oh, you want to know why such a valuable collectible sold for 
so little? The seller couldn’t spell Shaquille and listed the item as Schackeel.
 
If you’ve finished writing your item title and you have spaces left over, 
please fight the urge to dress the title up with lots of exclamation points and 
asterisks. No matter how gung-ho you are about your item, the eBay search 
engine may overlook your item if the title is encrusted with meaningless 
**** and !!!! symbols. If bidders do see your title, they may become annoyed 
by the virtual shrillness and ignore it anyway!!!!!!!! (See what I mean?)
Another distracting habit is overdoing capital letters. To buyers, seeing 
everything in caps is LIKE SEEING A HYSTERICAL SALESPERSON SCREAMING 
AT THEM TO BUY NOW! All that is considered shouting, which is rude and 
tough on the eyes. Use capitalization SPARINGLY, and only to finesse a par-
ticular point or feature.
Giving the title punch with a subtitle
A new feature on eBay is the availability of subtitles. eBay allows you to 
buy an additional 55 characters, which will appear under your item title in a 
search. The fee for this extra promotion is $0.50, and in a few circumstances, 
it is definitely worth your while. Any text that you input will really make your 

318
Creating Your Item Description
item stand out in the crowd — but (you knew there would be a but, didn’t 
you?) these additional 55 characters won’t come up in a title search. So if 
you have all those words in your description, the words will be found either 
way with a title and description search. Keep in mind that a subtitle essen-
tially doubles your listing fee.
Creating Your Item Description
After you hook potential bidders with your title, reel ’em in with a fabulous 
description. Don’t think Hemingway here; think infomercial (the classier the 
better). Figure 3-5 shows a concise description of a silver dollar for sale. You 
can write a magnificent description, as well — all you have to do is click the 
box and start typing.
 
Figure 3-5:

description 
can 
mean the 
difference 
between 
success and 
failure.
 
Composing the description
Here’s a list of suggestions for writing an item description:
 
✦ Write a factual description. Do you carefully describe the item, stating 
every fact you know about it? Do you avoid the use of jargon? Does the 
description answer almost any question a potential buyer might ask? If 
not, do some revising.

Book III
Chapter 3
Listing Your Items 
for Sale
319
Creating Your Item Description
 
✦ Accentuate the positive. Be enthusiastic when you list all the reasons 
everyone should bid on the item. Unlike the title, the description can 
take up as much space as you want. Even if you use a photo, be precise 
in your description — tell the reader, for example, the item’s size, color, 
and fabric. Refer to “Creating the perfect item title,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for ideas on what to emphasize.
 
✦ Include the negative. Don’t hide the truth of your item’s condition. 
Trying to conceal flaws costs you in the long run: You’ll get tagged 
with bad feedback. If the item has a scratch, a nick, a dent, a crack, a 
ding, a tear, a rip, missing pieces, replacement parts, faded color, dirty 
smudges, or a bad smell (especially if cleaning might damage the item), 
mention it in the description. If your item has been overhauled, rebuilt, 
repainted, or hot-rodded (say, a “Pentium computer” that was a 386 
till you put in the new motherboard), say so. You don’t want the buyer 
to send back your merchandise because you weren’t truthful about 
imperfections or modifications. This type of omission can lead to a fraud 
investigation.
 
✦ Include some friendly banter. You want to make the customer feel com-
fortable shopping with you. Don’t be afraid to let your personality show!
 
✦ Update your My eBay page. Let people know a little about you and 
who they’re dealing with. When customers have to decide between two 
people selling the same item and all else is equal, they’ll place their bids 
with the seller who makes them feel secure.
 
✦ Limit the number of auction rules (or terms of sale). Some sellers 
include a list of rules that’s longer than the item’s description. Nothing 
turns off a prospective buyer like paragraph after paragraph of rules and 
regulations. If you really must put in a litany of rules, use the following 
bit of HTML to make the size of the text smaller: <font size=-1>.
 
✦ Choose a reasonable typeface size. Many users are still looking at eBay 
on an 800 x 600 display. If you design your auctions at 1024 x 768, your 
typefaces may be way too large for the average user. Forcing a user to 
scroll leads to frustrated customers.
 
✦ Quote a shipping amount. Many bidders pass up auctions that don’t 
disclose the shipping charges. Make use of eBay’s shipping calculator 
to give your customers a fair shake at the shipping costs. If many others 
are selling the same item you’re selling, quoting reasonable shipping 
costs will help you reel in a buyer.
 
✦ Keep photos a practical size. Many users still connect with a dial-up 
Internet connection, and if they have to wait more than a few seconds 
for your large pictures to load, they may go elsewhere for the item.

320
Creating Your Item Description
 
✦ Be precise about all the logistical details of the post-auction transac-
tion. Even though you’re not required to list any special S&H (shipping 
and handling) or payment requirements in your item description, the 
majority of eBay users do. Try to figure out the cost of shipping the item 
in the United States and add that to your description. If you offer ship-
ping insurance, add it to your item description.
 
✦ Promote yourself, too. As you accumulate positive feedback, tell poten-
tial bidders about your terrific track record. Add statements like “I’m 
great to deal with. Check out my feedback section.” You can even take 
it a step further by inviting prospective bidders to your About Me page 
(where you may also include a link to your personal Web site — if you 
have one).
 
✦ Be concise and to the point — don’t ramble! As my sixth-grade English 
teacher user to say, “Make it like a woman’s skirt: long enough to cover 
the subject, yet short enough to keep it interesting.” Too many sellers 
these days drone on and on, causing bidders to have to scroll down the 
page several times. You can quickly lose your audience this way. They’ll 
look for a listing with a less complicated look.
 
✦ Wish your potential bidders well. Communication is the key to a good 
transaction; you can set the tone for your auction (and your post-
auction exchanges) by including some simple phrases that show your 
friendly side. Always end your description by wishing bidders good luck, 
inviting potential bidders to e-mail you with questions, and offering the 
option of providing additional photos of the item if you have them.
Jazzing it up with HTML
When you input your description, you have the option of jazzing things 
up with a bit of HTML coding, or you can use eBay’s HTML text editor, 
described in Book V, Chapter 3. If you know how to use a word processor, 
you’ll have no trouble touching up your text with this tool. Table 3-2 shows 
you a few HTML codes that you can insert into your text to help you pretty 
things up.

You can go back and forth from the HTML text editor to regular input and 
add additional codes here and there by selecting the View/Edit HTML check 
box (when you’re in the HTML text editor). I prepare all my auctions ahead 
of time in an HTML composer in the Mozilla SeaMonkey suite (see Book V, 
Chapter 3 for more details) and save them in my computer as plain TXT files. 
That way, my auctions are always retrievable for use (I just copy and paste) 
no matter what program or form I’m using to list them.
 
Occasionally, sellers offer an item as a presell. These sellers are either drop-
shipping an item or don’t yet have the item in stock but expect to have it. If 
you’re offering this kind of item, make sure that you spell out the details in 
the description. eBay policy states that you must ship a presell item within 
30 days of the auction’s end, so be sure you’ll have the item within that time 
span. Don’t forget to include the actual shipping date. I have found that put-
ting an item up for sale without having it in hand is a practice fraught with 
risk. The item you’re expecting may not arrive in time or may arrive dam-
aged. I’ve heard of one too many sellers who have had to go out and pur-
chase an item at retail for a buyer to preserve their reputation when caught

Listing the Number of Items for Sale
in this situation. By the way, this is not only eBay’s regulation. The Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC) calls this the 30-day rule, and they are serious 
about enforcing it. (For more about presells, check out Book III, Chapter 2.)
Listing the Number of Items for Sale
Unless you’re planning on holding a multiple-item (Dutch) auction, the 
number of items is always 1, which means you’re holding a traditional 
auction. If you need to change the quantity from 1, just type the number 
in the box.
 
A matching set of cuff links is considered one item, as is the complete 
37-volume set of The Smith Family Ancestry and Genealogical History since 
1270. If you have more than one of the same item, I suggest that you sell the 
items one at a time, because you will more than likely get higher final bids 
for your items when you sell them individually.
Whether you list your items individually in auctions, fixed price listings or 
together in a multiple-item auction, eBay won’t show more than ten auctions 
from a single seller at one time in search results.
Setting Bids, Prices, and Reserves
What do a baseball autographed by JFK, a used walkie-talkie, and a Jaguar 
sports car have in common? They all started with a $.99 minimum bid. eBay 
requires you to set a minimum bid, the lowest bid allowed in an auction. You 
may be surprised to see stuff worth tens of thousands of dollars starting at 
just a buck. These sellers haven’t lost their minds. Neither are they worried 
someone could end up tooling down the highway in a $100,000 sports car for 
the price of a burger.
Starting with a low minimum is also good for your pocketbook. eBay charges 
the seller an insertion, or placement, fee based on your opening bid. If you 
keep your opening bid low and set no reserve, you get to keep more of your 
money. (See Chapter 1 for more about eBay fees.)
 
Before you set a minimum bid, do your homework and make some savvy 
marketing decisions. If your auction isn’t going as you hoped, you could end 
up selling Grandma Ethel’s Ming vase for a dollar. See “Making Midcourse 
Corrections,” later in this chapter, on how you can make changes in your 
listing if you’ve made some egregious error.
Setting a minimum bid — how low can you go?
Setting an incredibly low minimum is a subtle strategy that gives you more 
bang for your buck. You can use a low minimum bid to attract more bidders

Setting Bids, Prices, and Reserves
who will, in turn, drive up the price to the item’s real value — especially if, 
after doing your research, you know that the item is particularly hot. 
 
The more bids you get, the more people will want to bid on your item 
because they perceive it as hot. A hot item with lots of bids draws even more 
bidders the way a magnet attracts paper clips.
 
When putting in your minimum bid, type only the numbers and a decimal 
point. Don’t use a dollar sign ($) or a cent sign (¢).
If you’re worried about the outcome of the final bid, you can protect your 
item by using a reserve price (the price the bidding needs to reach before 
the item can be sold). Then you won’t have to sell your item for a bargain-
basement price because your reserve price protects your investment. The 
best advice is to set a reserve price that is the lowest amount you’ll take for 
your item, and then set a minimum bid that is ridiculously low. However, 
use a reserve only when absolutely necessary because some bidders pass 
up reserve auctions. (For more info about setting a reserve price, see “Using 
your secret safety net — reserve price,” later in this section.)
Going with a Buy It Now price
eBay’s Buy It Now (BIN in eBay-speak) is available for single-item auctions. 
This feature allows buyers to purchase an item now. Have you ever wanted 
an item really badly and you didn’t want to wait until the end of an auction? 
If the seller offers Buy It Now, you can purchase that item immediately. Just 
specify the amount the item can sell for in the Buy It Now price area — the 
amount can be whatever you want. If you choose to sell a hot item during 
the holiday rush, for example, you can make the BIN price as high as you 
think it can go. If you just want the item to move, make your BIN price the 
average price you see the item go for on eBay.
In most categories, when your item receives a bid, the BIN option disappears 
and the item goes through the normal auction process. If you have a reserve 
price on your item, the BIN feature doesn’t disappear until a bidder meets 
your reserve price through the normal bidding process. To list an item with 
Buy It Now, you must have a feedback of 10 or be ID verified.
The Buy It Now price will remain, if there is a bid that doesn’t reach 50% of 
your BIN price in certain categories:
 
1. Parts & Accessories (eBay Motors) 
 
2. Tickets 
 
3. Clothing, Shoes & Accessories
 
4. Cell Phones & PDAs

324
Setting Bids, Prices, and Reserves
Using your secret safety net — reserve price
Here’s a little secret: The reason sellers list big-ticket items such as Ferraris, 
grand pianos, and high-tech computer equipment with a starting bid of $1 
is because they’re protected from losing money with a reserve price. The 
reserve price is the lowest price that must be met before the item can be 
sold. It is not required by eBay but can protect you. For this feature, eBay 
charges an additional fee that varies depending on how high your reserve is.
For example, say you list a first-edition book — John Steinbeck’s The Grapes 
of Wrath. You set the starting price at $.99 and the reserve price at $80. That 
means people can start bidding at $.99, and if at the end of the auction the 
book hasn’t reached the $80 reserve, you don’t have to sell the book.
As with everything in life, using a reserve price for your auctions has an 
upside and a downside. Many choosy bidders and bargain hunters blast past 
reserve-price auctions because they see a reserve price as a sign that pro-
claims “No bargains here!” Many bidders figure they can get a better deal on 
the same item with an auction that proudly declares NR (for no reserve) in 
its description. As an enticement to those bidders, you see lots of NR listings 
in auction titles.
 
If you need to set a reserve on your item, help the bidder out. Many bidders 
shy away from an auction that has a reserve, but if they’re really interested, 
they will read the item description. To dispel their fears that the item is way 
too expensive or out of their price range, add a line in your description that 
states the amount of your reserve price. “I have put a reserve of $75 on this 
item to protect my investment; the highest bid over $75 will win the item.” A 
phrase such as this takes away the vagueness of the reserve auction and 
allows you to place a reserve with a low opening bid. (You want to reel ’em 
in, remember?)
 
On lower-priced items, I suggest that you set a higher minimum bid and set 
no reserve.
If bids don’t reach a set reserve price, some sellers e-mail the highest bidder 
and offer the item at what the seller thinks is a fair price. Two caveats:
 
✦ eBay can suspend the seller and the buyer if the side deal is reported to 
Trust and Safety. This activity is strictly prohibited.
 
✦ eBay won’t protect buyers or sellers if a side deal goes bad.
You can, however, offer an underbidder a second chance offer or relist the 
item for another whack at the buying public.
 
You can’t use a reserve price in a multiple-item (Dutch) auction.

Timing Your Auction: Is It Everything?
Timing Your Auction: Is It Everything?
Although I discuss auction length in depth in Chapter 2, it’s important to 
mention a bit more here. eBay gives you a choice of auction length: 1, 3, 5, 7, 
or 10 days. Just click the number you want in the box. If you choose a 10-day 
auction, you add $0.40 to your listing fee.
 
My auction-length strategy depends on the time of year and the item I’m sell-
ing, and I generally have great success. If you have an item that you think 
will sell pretty well, run a 7-day auction (be sure to cover a full weekend) so 
bidders have time to check it out before they decide to bid. However, if you 
know that you have a red-hot item that’s going to fly off the shelves — such 
as a rare toy or a hard-to-get video game — choose a 3-day auction. Eager 
bidders tend to bid higher and more often to beat out their competition if 
the item’s hot and going fast. A 3-day auction is long enough to give trendy 
items exposure and ring up bids.
 
No matter how many days you choose to run your auction, it ends at exactly 
the same time of day as it starts. A 7-day auction that starts on Thursday at 
9:03:02 a.m. ends the following Thursday at 9:03:02 a.m.
Although I know the folks at eBay are pretty laid-back, they do run on mili-
tary time. That means they use a 24-hour clock set to Pacific time. So 3:30 
in the afternoon is 15:30, and one minute after midnight is 00:01. Questions 
about time conversions? Check out www.timezoneconverter.com or look 
at the table in Chapter 2. And so you don’t have to keep flipping back to that 
page, I also include a printable conversion chart of eBay times on my Web 
site (www.coolebaytools.com).
If you have five Dennis Rodman Wedding Dolls, 
37 Breathalyzers, or 2000 commemorative pins, 
and you want to sell them all at once to as 
many bidders as quickly as possible, sell them 
as multiple quantities in a fixed-price sale. (You 
can also sell the whole shebang in one lot in 
the Wholesale Lot category.) If you’re not sure 
how much you can get for the items, you can 
always try a multiple-item (Dutch) auction.
eBay has requirements for starting a Dutch 
auction. You have to be an eBay member for at 
least 14 days with a feedback rating of 30 (if you 
have a PayPal account your feedback can be 
as low as 15) or higher or go through ID Verify. 
Visit eBay’s help area for more information on 
how to conduct this type of auction, and check 
out Chapter 1 for more info on how a multiple-
item auction works. You can also go directly

I Want to Be Alone: The Private Auction
 
Occasionally, eBay conducts a mandatory outage for database maintenance, 
which means that it closes up shop on a Friday from 1 a.m. to 3 a.m. Pacific 
time (that’s 4:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time). Never post an auction right 
after this outage. eBay regulars won’t be around to bid on it. Also, search 
updates often run 12 to 15 hours behind on Friday and Saturday, following 
scheduled maintenance.
With listings running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you should know when 
the most bidders are around to take a gander at your wares. Here are some 
times to think about:
 
✦ Saturday and Sunday: Always run an auction over a weekend. People 
log on and off eBay all day to look for desired items.
 
✦ Holiday weekends: If a holiday weekend’s coming up around the time 
you’re setting up your auction, run your auction through the weekend 
and end it a day after the “holiday” Monday. This gives prospective bid-
ders a chance to catch up with the items they perused over the weekend 
and plan their bidding strategies.
 
 Don’t end an auction on the last day of a three-day holiday. People in the 
mood to shop are generally at department stores collecting bargains. If 
eBay members aren’t shopping, they’re out enjoying an extra day off.
 
✦ Time of day: The best times of day to start and end your auction are 
during eBay’s peak hours of operation, which are 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. 
Pacific Time, right after work on the West Coast. Perform your com-
pleted auction research, however, to be sure that this strategy applies 
to your item, because this timing depends on the item you’re auctioning.
 
Unless you’re an insomniac or a vampire who wants to sell to werewolves, 
don’t let your auctions close in the middle of the night. Not enough bidders 
are around to cause last-minute bidding that would bump up the price.
I Want to Be Alone: The Private Auction
In a private auction, bidders’ user IDs are kept under wraps. Sellers typically 
use this option to protect the identities of bidders during auctions for high-
priced big-ticket items (say, that restored World War II fighter). Wealthy 
eBay users may not want the world to know that they have the resources to 
buy expensive items. Private auctions are also held for items from the Adult/
Erotica category. (Gee, there’s a shocker.)

Adding Visuals to Highlight Your Item
 
The famous sign that was pictured in almost every piece of Disney promo-
tion (for the first 40 or so years of Disneyland’s existence) was put up for 
sale on eBay in 2000. Rumor has it that the sign was purchased by actor 
John Stamos for a high bid of $30,700. Unfortunately for John, the Disney 
auctions did not use the private auction feature. After news of the winner’s 
name hit the tabloids, the entire world knew John’s eBay user ID! He had to 
change his ID in a hurry to end the throngs of lovey-dovey e-mail messages 
headed to his computer!
Adding Visuals to Highlight Your Item
With so many listings posted daily on eBay, you need some way to get your 
listing noticed. Adding visual interest to catch a potential buyer’s eye is one 
way. As you fill out the Sell an Item page, take advantage of the visual ele-
ments that eBay offers.
Put me in the gallery
The gallery is an auction area where you can post pictures that are accessi-
ble from the listings. When you use the gallery, a postage-stamp-size version 
of your image appears next to your listing in the category or search. Many 
buyers enjoy browsing the gallery catalog-style, and it’s open to all catego-
ries. If you choose to go this route, your item is listed in both the gallery and 
in the regular text listings. (I explain how to post your pictures in Book V.)
The best thing about using a gallery picture in your listings is that it 
increases the space your listing takes up on a search or category page — 
plus it’s free! If you don’t use a gallery picture and have just an image in your 
auction, all that will be next to your listing is a teeny, tiny camera icon.
A picture is worth a thousand words
Clichés again? Perhaps. But an item on eBay without a picture is almost a 
waste of time. If you haven’t set up photo-hosting elsewhere, you can list 
one picture with eBay’s Pictures Service for free, as shown in Figure 3-6. 
Additional pictures will cost you $.15 each.
Avail yourself of eBay’s one free picture; when you do, eBay will give you a 
free top-of-the-listing-page picture. I use it and recommend it! Also, you can 
put all the additional pictures you want in your auction description for free. 
See Book V for the necessary coding and instructions.

Listing Designer
How many times have you seen an item on eBay laid out on the page all 
pretty-like with a fancy colorful border around the description? If that sort 
of thing appeals to you, eBay’s Listing Designer can supply you with borders 
for almost any type of item for $0.10. Will the pretty borders increase the 
amount of bids your auction will get? It’s extremely doubtful. A clean item 
description with a couple of good, clear pictures of your item is all you need.
Listing the Payment Methods You’ll Accept
Yeah, sure, eBay is loads of fun, but the bottom line to selling is the phrase 
“Show me the money!” You make the call on what you’re willing to take as 
money from your auction’s high bidder. eBay offers the following payment 
options — just select the ones that you like:
 
✦ Money order or cashier’s check (acceptable as payment only for 
Vehicles and some categories in Real Estate, Mature Audiences, and 
Business & Industrial): From a seller’s point of view, this is the safest 
method of payment. It’s the closest thing you can get to cash. As a seller, 
you want to get paid with as little risk as possible. The only drawback? 
You have to wait for the buyer to mail the money.
 
✦ Credit cards: If you accept credit cards, using PayPal is the cheapest 
and most convenient way to go. If you have a merchant account through 
a retail store, be sure to select the little check boxes next to the credit 
cards you accept.

Book III
Chapter 3

Where You Are and Where You’ll Ship To
 
 Offering a credit card payment option often attracts higher bids to 
your auctions. These higher bids usually more than cover the small 
percentage that credit card payment services charge you to use their 
services.
 
 Some sellers who use credit-card services try attaching an additional fee 
(to cover their credit-card processing fees) to the final payment. 
However, that’s against the law in California, home of eBay, and there-
fore against eBay’s rules. So forget about it. eBay can end your auction if 
it catches you.
 
✦ Personal check (acceptable as payment only for Vehicles and some 
categories in Real Estate, Mature Audiences, and Business & Industrial): 
This is an extremely popular option, but it comes with a risk. The check 
could bounce higher than a lob at Wimbledon. If you accept personal 
checks, explain in your item description how long you plan to wait for the 
check to clear before sending the merchandise. The average hold is about 
ten business days. Some sellers wait as long as two weeks. Accepting 
eChecks through PayPal leaves all the bookkeeping and waiting to PayPal; 
you don’t have to call the bank for confirmation.
 
 Cut down on the risk of bad checks by reading the bidder’s feedback 
when the auction is underway. Be wary of accepting checks from people 
with negative comments. (I explain all about feedback in Book I.) Never 
ship an item until you’re certain the check has cleared the buyer’s bank.
 
✦ Online escrow: An escrow service acts as a referee, a neutral third 
party. Escrow companies typically charge 5% of the sale price, and the 
buyer usually pays for this service. Unless you’re selling an expensive 
item, offering escrow is overkill. On big-ticket items, however, escrow 
may make the difference between a sale and a pass. If you do offer 
escrow, the winning bidder should inform you right after the auction if 
he or she intends to use it.
 
Most sellers offer buyers several ways to pay. You can choose as many as 
you want. When the auction page appears, your choices are noted at the top 
of the listing. Listing several payment options makes you look like a flexible, 
easygoing professional.
Where You Are and Where You’ll Ship To
When listing an item for sale on eBay, you come to the area where you need 
to input your payment and shipping information. You have the option of 
using a flat rate, where you simply input your flat shipping charges. The 
charges appear in a box at the top and the bottom of your item description.

330
Where You Are and Where You’ll Ship To
But how you handle shipping — and its associated cost for your buyers — 
depends on what you’re shipping (how big it is), where you’re shipping it, 
and the carrier you decide to use. So take a bit of time to consider your loca-
tion and your shipping options before you fill out this section.
eBay has some new rules about how much you can charge for shipping in 
certain categories. Some greedy sellers would charge egregious amounts for 
shipping their items to avoid paying Final Value Fees on their extra profits, 
so eBay cracked down and made maximum shipping limits. Table 3-3 gives 
you the current shipping charge limits as of October 31, 2008.

Filling out the item location
eBay wants you to list the general area and the country in which you live. 
That way, you give the bidder a heads-up on what kind of shipping charges 
to expect. Don’t be esoteric (listing where you live as The Here and Now isn’t 
a whole lot of help), but don’t go crazy with cross-streets, landmarks, or 
degrees of latitude. Listing the city and state you live in is enough.
 
If you live in a big area — say, suburban Los Angeles (who, me?), which 
sprawls on for miles — you may want to think about narrowing your region a 
little. You may find a bidder who lives close to you, which could swing your 
auction. If you do a face-to-face transaction, choosing a public place is a 
good idea. (I like doing my trades at Starbucks.)
Setting shipping terms
Ahoy, matey! Hoist the bid! Okay, not quite. Before you run it up the mast, 
select your shipping options. Here are your choices:
 
✦ Ship to the United States only: This option is selected by default; it 
means you ship only domestically.
 
✦ Will ship worldwide: The world is your oyster. But make sure that you 
can afford it.
 
✦ Will ship to United States and the following countries: If you’re 
comfortable shipping to certain countries but not to others, make your 
selections here. Your choices appear on your auction page.
 
When you indicate that you will ship internationally, your auction shows up 
on the international eBay sites, which is a fantastic way to attract new 
buyers! eBay has lots of good international users, so you may want to con-
sider selling your items around the world. If you do, be sure to clearly state 
in the description all extra shipping costs and customs charges.

334
Where You Are and Where You’ll Ship To
Traditionally, the buyer pays for shipping, and this is the point at which you 
must decide how much to charge. You also have to calculate how much this 
item will cost you to ship. If the item weighs under a pound, you may decide 
to charge a flat rate to all buyers. To charge a flat rate, click the Flat Shipping 
Rates tab on the Sell an Item form and fill in the shipping amount. Before you 
fill in the amount, be sure to include your charges for packing (see Book VII 
for more info on how much to add for this task) and how much the insur-
ance charges will be.
 
Offering a flat shipping fee for international shipping can be dangerous, 
unless you offer shipping to only one foreign country. That’s because the 
rates to each country are different. You might prefer to put shipping-fee 
information in your description. (See the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book 
for instructions on how to type foreign currency symbols.)
 
eBay buyers love seeing a flat shipping fee. If you can find it in yourself to 
find a reasonable midway point, a fixed shipping price may just beat your 
competition. Figure 3-7 shows you the Sell an Item form’s area to fill in for a 
flat shipping rate.
 
Figure 3-7: 
The Flat 
Shipping 
Rates form.
 
Using eBay’s shipping calculator
When your item weighs two pounds or more, you may want to use eBay’s 
versatile shipping calculator to determine your flat shipping-and-handling 
cost or to quote a calculated shipping cost. Using the shipping calculator 
has these advantages:
 
✦ It accounts for variable rates: Because UPS and the U.S. Postal Service 
now charge variable rates for packages of the same weight, based on 
distance, using the calculator simplifies things for your customers (and 
you). Be sure you’ve weighed the item.

✦ It includes your handling amount: The calculator allows you to input 
a handling amount and adds it to the overall shipping total — but does 
not break out these amounts separately for the customer. 
 
✦ It calculates the cost of insurance: The calculator also conveniently 
calculates the proper insurance amount for the item.
Figure 3-8 shows how simple the calculator is. You may select up to three 
levels of shipping per item.

You can check out the associated costs by clicking the Show Rates button, 
which shows you all shipping costs, so you can decide to ship with either 
the U.S. Postal Service or UPS. I always test my packages from a California 
ZIP code (because that’s where I live) to a New York ZIP code. Doing this 
gives me an estimate for Zone 8, which is the most expensive option (coast-
to-coast by distance) when shipping in the U.S.

5. In the Packaging & Handling Fee box, type your packaging fees.
 
• When adding your packaging and handling charges, don’t worry that 
the buyers will see these individual fees. eBay combines this amount 
with the shipping cost and shows the total as one shipping price.
 
• If you selected the U.S. Postal Service as your carrier, be sure to add 
the cost of a delivery confirmation (if you use one) when you figure 
your packaging and handling fee.
 
6. Select the appropriate options in the Shipping Insurance and Sales 
Tax drop-down lists.
 
 If you require the buyer to pay for insurance, or even if insurance is 
optional, be sure to indicate it. eBay’s calculator will give the buyer the 
actual insurance cost, based on the final bid.
After you’ve input all your information, you can forget about it because eBay 
takes over. Check out Book VII for more information on shipping options and 
how to mechanize the process.
Checking Your Work and Starting the Sale
After you’ve filled in all the blanks on the Sell an Item page and you think 
you’re ready to join the world of e-commerce, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Review button at the bottom of the Sell an Item page.
 
 You waft to the Verification page, the place where you can catch mis-
takes before your item is listed. The Verification page shows you a 
condensed version of all your information and tallies how much eBay is 
charging you in fees and options to run this auction. You also see a pre-
view of how your auction description and pictures will look on the site.
 
 You also may find the Verification page helpful as a last-minute chance 
to get your bearings. If you’ve chosen a general category, eBay asks you 
whether you’re certain there isn’t a more appropriate category. You can 
go back to any of the pages that need correcting by clicking the appro-
priate tab at the top of the Verification page. Make category changes 
or any other changes and additions, and then head for the Verification 
page again.
 
2. Check for mistakes.
 
 Nitpick for common, careless errors; you won’t be sorry. I’ve seen eBay 
members make goofs such as the wrong category listing, spelling and 
grammatical errors, and missing information about shipping, handling, 
insurance, and payment methods.

338
Making Midcourse Corrections
 
3. When you’re sure everything is accurate and you’re happy with your 
item listing, click the Submit My Listing button.
 
 A Listing Confirmation page pops up. At that precise moment, your sale 
begins, even though it may be a couple of hours before it appears in 
eBay’s search and listings updates. If you want to see your auction right 
away and check for bids, your Auction Confirmation page provides a 
link for that purpose. Click the link, and you’re there. You can also keep 
track of your auctions by using the My eBay page.
 
All listing pages come with this friendly warning: Seller assumes all responsi-
bility for listing this item.
Some eBay veterans just gloss over this warning after they’ve been wheel-
ing and dealing for a while, but it’s an important rule to remember. Whether 
you’re buying or selling, you’re always responsible for your actions.
 
For the first 24 hours after your sale is underway, eBay stamps the Item page 
with a funky sunrise icon next to the listing in the category listing page or 
search results page. This is just a little reminder for buyers to come take a 
look at the latest items up for sale.
Making Midcourse Corrections
If you made a mistake filling out the Sell an Item page but didn’t notice it 
until after the listing is up and running, don’t worry. Pencils have erasers, 
and eBay allows revisions. You can make changes at two stages of the game: 
before the first bid is placed and after the bidding war is underway. This 
section explains what you can (and can’t) correct — and when you have to 
accept the little imperfections of your Sell an Item page.
Making changes before bidding begins
Here’s what you can change about your auction before bids have been 
placed, as long as your auction does not end within 12 hours:
 
✦ The title, subtitle, or description
 
✦ The item category
 
✦ The item’s Minimum Bid price
 
✦ The item’s Buy It Now price (or adding a Buy It Now price)
 
✦ The reserve price (you can add, change, or remove it)
 
✦ The duration of your listing

Book III
Chapter 3
Listing Your Items

339
Making Midcourse Corrections
 
✦ The URL of the picture you’re including with your auction
 
✦ A private-auction designation (you can add or remove it)
 
✦ Accepted payment methods, the item location, and shipping terms
When you revise a listing, eBay puts a little notation on your page that reads: 
Description (revised).
To revise an auction before bids have been received, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the item page and click the Revise Your Item link.
 
 This link will appear only if you’ve signed in on eBay. If the item hasn’t 
received any bids, a message appears on your screen to indicate that 
you may update the item.
 
 You’re taken to the Revise Your Item page, which outlines the rules for 
revising your item. At the bottom, the item number is filled in.
 
2. Click Revise Item.
 
 You arrive at the Revise Your Item page which looks suspiciously like 
the Sell an Item form.
 
3. Click the link that corresponds to the area you’d like to change.
 
4. Make changes to the item information.
 
5. When you’ve finished making changes, click the Save Changes button 
at the bottom of the page.
 
 A summary of your newly revised auction page appears on your screen. 
If you’ve incurred any additional fees, the amount is listed at the bottom 
of the page. If you want to make more changes, click the Back button of 
your browser and redo the Update Your Information page.
 
6. When you’re happy with your revisions, click Submit Revisions.
 
 You’re taken to your newly revised auction item page, where you see 
a disclaimer from eBay that says you’ve revised the auction before the 
first bid.
Making changes after bidding begins
If your auction is up and running and already receiving bids, you can still 
make some slight modifications to it. Newly added information is clearly 
separated from the original text and pictures. In addition, eBay puts a time 
stamp on the additional info in case questions from early bidders crop up 
later.

340
Making Midcourse Corrections
After your item receives bids, eBay allows you to add to your item’s descrip-
tion. If you feel you were at a loss for words in writing your item’s descrip-
tion or if a lot of potential bidders are asking the same questions, go ahead 
and make all the additions you want. But whatever you put there the first 
time around stays in the description as well.
Follow the same procedure for making changes before bidding begins. When 
you arrive at the Revise Your Item page, you can only add to your descrip-
tion, add features, or add additional payment information. Your initial listing 
will not be changed — only appended.
 
Don’t let an oversight grow into a failure to communicate — and don’t ignore 
iffy communication until the listing is over. Correct any inaccuracies in your 
listing information now to avoid problems later on.
Always check your e-mail (or your My eBay page) to see whether bidders 
have questions about your item. If a bidder wants to know about flaws, be 
truthful and courteous when returning e-mails. As you get more familiar with 
eBay (and with writing auction descriptions), the number of e-mail questions 
will decrease. If you enjoy good customer service in your day-to-day shop-
ping, here’s your chance to give some back.

Chapter 4: Using eBay’s 
Turbo Lister
In This Chapter
✓ Knowing the requirements
✓ Downloading the software
✓ Preparing your listing
N
ot much in this world is free, but for now, eBay offers you a free, con-
venient tool you can use to list your items for sale: Turbo Lister. This 
powerful software helps you organize your items for sale, design your ads, 
and list them. It organizes your items for future relisting as well by saving 
your initial item input and allowing you to create folders for storage. Your 
items disappear from the program only if you delete them.
I like Turbo Lister because it’s simple and easy to use, with a built-in 
WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) HTML editor that makes prepar-
ing your eBay listings offline a breeze. You can also copy and paste in your 
pre-made templates made in SeaMonkey (see Book V Chapter 3). After 
you’ve input your items and are ready to list, you can just click a button and 
they’re all listed at once. You can also stagger listings and schedule them 
for a later date for a fee. In this chapter, you get an inside look at how Turbo 
Lister works.
 
Although using Turbo Lister is free, you’re still responsible for any fees you 
incur when listing an item on the site.
Features and Minimum Requirements
Turbo Lister is robust software with the following features:
 
✦ Self-updates: Turbo Lister automatically updates itself regularly from 
the eBay site and includes any new eBay enhancements so your listings 
always take advantage of eBay’s latest features. Whenever you invoke 
the program, it loads and then immediately checks with the eBay server 
for updates. This can be a bit laborious (especially if the servers are 
busy or you have a slow Internet connection), so if you plan on listing 
items at a particular time, be sure to open Turbo Lister earlier, giving it 
a few minutes to work its updating magic.

342
Features and Minimum Requirements
 
✦ Templates: Predesigned templates are built into the program’s Listing 
Designer. If you use one of eBay’s multitude of colorful themes or lay-
outs, you will be charged an additional $.10 on top of your listing fees. 
You can use a template of your own design to jump-start your ad design 
without incurring extra charges by pasting the template into the HTML 
view. You can even use templates from other sources (such as those in 
Book V), as long as they are in HTML format.
 
✦ WYSIWYG interface: If you choose to design your own ads from 
scratch, you can do it with Turbo Lister’s easy-to-use WYSIWYG (what 
you see is what you get) layout design.
 
✦ Bulk listing tool: Prepare your listings whenever you have the time. 
When you’re ready to launch a group of them, just transfer them to the 
upload area, and, well, upload them.
 
✦ Item preview: You can preview your listings to be sure they look just as 
you want them to.
 
✦ All item listing capabilities are available offline: By using Turbo Lister 
(and its constant auto-upgrading), you don’t sacrifice any of the features 
available to you when you list on the site using the Sell an Item form.
Although this software is definitely useful, you have to decide whether it’s 
really for you. The first thing to check is whether your computer meets 
Turbo Lister’s minimum requirements.
 
✦ Your computer must be a PC, not a Mac (sorry, Mac users). You have to 
have the Windows 2000, XP, or Vista operating system.
 
✦ The processor must be at least a Pentium II. The faster your processor, 
the better.
 
✦ You must have at least 128 MB of RAM (and that’s a bare minimum).
 
 The more RAM you have, the better things work.
 
✦ You should have at least 250 MB of free space on your hard drive to run 
the installation.
 
✦ A monitor setting of at least 800 x 600 resolution, 256 colors (8-bit). Keep 
in mind the software interface looks a lot better with 16-bit color and 
1024 x 768 resolution. All monitors today have this capability, so you 
should be just fine here.
 
✦ Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 or later.
 
To check your version of Internet Explorer with the browser open, click the 
Help menu and then choose About Internet Explorer. On the top line, your 
Internet Explorer version number is listed.

Downloading and Starting Turbo Lister
Downloading and Starting Turbo Lister
To use Turbo Lister, you must first download it at
pages.ebay.com/turbo_lister
After you install Turbo Lister on your computer, you can list your sales on 
the easy-to-use form. What could be simpler?
From any eBay page, click the eBay site map from the link above the naviga-
tion bar. (Most everything on eBay is on the site map.) Scroll down to Selling 
Tools, and then click Turbo Lister.
After you get to the Seller Tools page, download Turbo Lister. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Download Now link.
 
 The requirements for using Turbo Lister appear at the bottom of 
the page.
 
2. Click the Turbo Lister Web Setup link.
 
 The Windows Security warning appears, cautioning that you’re about to 
download something foreign to your computer.
 
3. Click Yes.
 
 Clicking Yes downloads Turbo Lister. Clicking No doesn’t. Just trust me 
(and eBay) and click Yes.
From this point on, installation is automatic. Voilà! Turbo Lister is on your 
computer!
Note that this procedure first downloads a small setup version of the pro-
gram that checks your computer for preinstalled files. When that task is 
finished, Turbo Lister checks back with mothership eBay and automatically 
downloads any files it needs.
After you’ve installed the program, you’ll see a new icon on your desktop; a 
little green man juggling magic pixie dust over his head. This is the icon for 
Turbo Lister. Double-click it and you’ll see the Turbo Lister splash screen 
with eBay’s tips of the day. This will pop up every time you open the pro-
gram, which can get annoying. It doesn’t do anything for you and wastes 
precious seconds of your time. If you want to avoid it, select the check box 
labeled Do not show me this screen again, and then click Start Here. The 
splash screen will be forever banished.

344
Preparing an eBay Listing
When the program is open, the first thing you do is to set up a new Turbo 
Lister file:
 
1. Select the Start option from the opening screen, and click Next.
 
2. Fill in your eBay user ID and password, and then click Next.
 
 Turbo Lister now wants to connect back to eBay to retrieve your eBay 
account information.
 
3. Make sure your Internet connection is live, and then click the Connect 
Now button.
 
 In a minute or so, a small window opens asking you to give eBay permis-
sion to access your eBay data, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Linking your 
account to 
Turbo Lister.
 
 
4. Click I Agree, if you do; otherwise click the No Thanks, Please Return 
Me to eBay Turbo Lister link.
 
5. Click Finish.
 
 The program fires up and is ready to list.
Preparing an eBay Listing
Now that you have Turbo Lister at hand, you can prepare hundreds of eBay 
listings in advance — and launch them with a single mouse click. Or, if you 
want to start your auctions at a particular date and time, you can select a 
scheduled item launching format. (More on that later.)

Preparing an eBay Listing
Follow these steps to list an item for sale:
 
1. Click the New button (the one with the sunburst symbol) in the upper-
left corner.
 
 This is where you decide what you wish to create. Most of the informa-
tion requested is identical to the eBay Sell an Item form.
 
2. Select the Create New Item from the drop down menu.
 
 A page appears, as shown in Figure 4-2, ready for you to enter your title, 
subtitle, and lots of other information.
 
Figure 4-2: 
All of eBay’s

information 
is on one 
page (with 
links).
 
 
 You can save bunches of time if you write your titles and descriptions in 
Notepad or Word, at your leisure, before you go into Turbo Lister. You 
can use your own templates or use the Design View to doll up your text.
 
3. In the Title box, enter the title.
 
 If you want to use a subtitle, type that as well. Subtitles are handy 
for adding selling points that accompany your title in search results. 
(Entering a subtitle for your auction costs an additional $.50.)
 
4. Select your category from the Category drop-down list and then click 
Select.

346
Preparing an eBay Listing
 
 You are presented with a screen that lists all eBay categories in a hierar-
chal format. The main categories are listed with a plus sign next to them. 
When you find your main category, click the plus sign, and subcatego-
ries are displayed, as shown in Figure 4-3. To drop even lower into the 
world of nether-categories, keep clicking plus signs next to subtopics. 
You know you’ve hit the bottom rung of the category ladder when you 
see only a minus sign.
 
Figure 4-3: 
Select 
the final 
category.
 
 
5. If you have an eBay Store, select a category for the item in your store 
from the drop-down list.
 
 This area is automatically populated from your eBay Store when eBay 
updates your Turbo Lister installation.
 
6. Continue filling in the blanks and choosing from lists. When you’re 
finished, click Save.
If you have items listed on eBay (that you’ve 
listed through the Sell an Item page or with 
eBay’s relisting feature), you can import those 
listings into Turbo Lister for future use and 
relisting. Just click the Synchronize button 
on the toolbar. In a moment or two, you’re 
presented with a complete tally of everything 
you have listed for sale on the site. You’ll also 
see (if you’ve indicated you want this informa-
tion) sold and unsold items. All these listings 
automatically import into Turbo Lister, and you 
can then save your listings as templates or for 
uploading at a later date.

Designing Your Listing
Designing Your Listing
When it comes to designing your listing, you have several options. eBay’s 
Turbo Lister makes it a snap to design your item listing with a few easy 
features:
 
✦ WYSIWYG HTML design form: When in the Create new item form, 
this feature is somewhat hidden. By clicking on the words Description 
Builder, a new window will pop up to reveal the form. You can base your 
ad on this very easy-to-use design tool. In Design View, it has a toolbar 
similar to the formatting toolbar in Microsoft Word (see Figure 4-4), so 
the buttons should be familiar. 
 
Figure 4-4: 
The design 
toolbar. 
 
 
✦ Templates and themes: I’m sure you’ve seen eBay listings with nice 
graphics in the borders. These come from eBay’s easy-to-use theme 
templates, which are listed on the left side of the screen. You may select 
any of these colorful templates to doll up your listing. Themes make the 
listing look pretty, but they may draw attention away from the selling 
strength of your pictures. Remember that your good description and a 
quality photo will sell your item. Also keep in mind that eBay charges an 
additional $.10 to use these themes in your listing. You don’t have to use 
any of the themes; just be sure not to select the box next to Use Designer 
(shown in Figure 4-5).
 
✦ Layout: These options are available only if you are going to pay for using 
Designer. You may select from Standard, Photos Left, Photos Right, One 
Photo Top, Photos Bottom, or Slide Show.
 
 When you use eBay Picture Services, the first picture is free. By using 
your first free picture, you can have a great-looking header picture at the 
top of your listing page. Additional pictures are $.15 and a slide show 
will cost you the princely sum of $.75.
 
 eBay has graciously included a photo-icon tool that allows you to 
include your own images from the Web without paying eBay their requi-
site $.15 a picture. Figure 4-5 shows me adding a URL to tell Turbo Lister 
where my pictures are. There’s also a command to insert a hyperlink 
into your description (see Figure 4-6) so you can have the prospective 
buyer e-mail you with a click of the mouse.

Filling In Item Specifics
 
✦ HTML view: If you have a smattering of HTML knowledge, you may want 
to edit your listing design in HTML view. You can also insert your hosted 
images by entering supplementary coding into the HTML view. (See 
Book V for additional information about coding and inserting your pic-
tures in the description area.) Also, if you have your own predesigned 
template, you can copy and paste the HTML for the template into the 
HTML view box.
 
At any time during the design process, click the Preview tab to see what 
your listing looks like in an Internet browser.
 
Be sure to add at least one more picture using eBay’s Picture Services so 
you can use the free header picture. Just click one of the boxes labeled Click 
Here to Insert Picture, and select any picture on your computer’s hard drive. 
When your picture appears in the Turbo Lister box, click Next.
 
At the end of the Create New Item form is a Save as Template button. Suppose 
you’ve finally designed a simple template that you’d like to use over and over 
for your auctions. (I have two pet templates — one with a vertical picture and 
one with a horizontal picture. They may be simple, but I use them again and 
again.) You can save any listing you’ve created as a template — and then 
merely substitute the new text the next time you want to use that template 
format.
Filling In Item Specifics
Now it’s time to get all the little details into your listing, such as the number 
of days to run the listing and your shipping and payment information. You 
do all this in the Selling Format side of the page, as shown in Figure 4-7
eBay fills in much of this information for you. To edit the information per-
taining to an option, such as Payment Methods or Item Location, click the 
Edit button in the appropriate area. Clicking the Change button displays a 
small menu for adding text or changing defaults. After you’ve made your 
changes, click OK.

350
Organizing Your Listings
 
Save time by saving repetitive text as the default. For example, when you 
want all your listings to have the same information in Payment Instructions 
or Payment Methods, select the Save for Future Listings check box in the 
detail area that appears when you click Edit. This saves the information as 
the default. You can always change the information on a case-by-case basis 
when listing another item.
After you’ve filled out all the information in the areas, click Save.
 
Figure 4-7:

your listing

final details.
 
Organizing Your Listings
After you’ve put together a few listings, your Turbo Lister item Inventory will 
look something like Figure 4-8. Just click the link on the left to get there. Note 
that you can add folders to the folder list to save inventories for different 
categories of items.

To create a folder and move items into it, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Turbo Lister program.
 
2. Near the top of the screen, click the arrow just to the right of the New 
button and select the command to create a new folder.
 
3. Give your new folder a name, and then click OK.
 
 The folder appears in the folder list on the left side of the screen.
 
4. To move a listing to a different folder, highlight the listing and drag it 
to the folder.
 
 To move multiple listings at once, press the Control key or the Shift key 
and then click the listings.
You can look at all your items, including those in folders, by clicking the 
Inventory link. To see the contents of a particular folder, just click the folder 
name.

Uploading Listings to eBay
Uploading Listings to eBay
After you’ve input a few listings, you may want to upload them so they will 
become active on eBay. Turbo Lister makes it easy to upload items from 
your items Inventory on your computer to eBay.
 
1. Highlight the listing you want to upload.
 
2. If you want to schedule the listing to upload at a later date or time, 
select the Schedule option (at the top of the screen) and choose a date 
and time.
 
 You’re charged an additional $.10 fee for any item you choose to sched-
ule for a Scheduled listing.
 
3. Click the Add to Upload button, which is at the top of the item list.
 
 Your listing is copied to the listings Waiting to Upload tab, as shown in 
Figure 4-9.

4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 to upload additional listings.
 
 You can define the order in which your listings upload to eBay by high-
lighting the item you want to move on the listings Waiting to Upload 
page and then clicking the up or down arrow at the top of the list.
 
5. To send items to eBay to be listed immediately, click Upload All to 
eBay.
 
 eBay calculates your fees before posting the listings; you can approve or 
cancel the upload before the listing goes live on the site.
 
6. Approve the upload and your items will be live on the site!

✓ Keeping track of payments
✓ Relisting items
✓ Working with bidder-management tools
F
or the beginning seller, the My eBay page will ease your way into selling 
by giving you complete control of your auctions. When you start run-
ning more listings than you can handle comfortably with My eBay, you may 
want to consider upgrading your My eBay page to Selling Manager.
This chapter explains how you can get the most out of the My eBay: All 
Selling page, and how it can benefit your business.
Managing Your All Selling Area
eBay provides some smooth management tools on your My eBay, All Selling 
summary page. You can track items you currently have up for sale and 
items you’ve sold. The All Selling page is a quick way to get a snapshot of 
the dollar value of your auctions as they proceed. Although this page isn’t 
as good for marketing information (detailed counters are best — see Book 
VIII), it is a pretty good way to tell at a glance how your items are faring.
The All Selling home page, which is shown in Figure 5-1, has several areas:
 
✦ Scheduled: If you’ve scheduled listings to begin at a later time, they’re 
listed here.
 
✦ Active Selling: In the middle of the page, these give you a clear idea of 
what is going on with your eBay sales.
 
✦ Sold: Further down, you’ll see the list of items you’ve (thankfully) sold.
 
✦ Unsold: Here is the netherworld of unsold items. It’s time to relist, 
sell similar, or put them in your store. (Find out how in the section 
“Relisting Items without Extra Work,” later in this chapter.) If you

continue to scroll waaaay down the page, you’ll see far too much infor-

page to go to each individual area on its own page.

Dealing with the My eBay: Active Selling Page
eBay’s All Selling area allows you to customize various pages. Also, hidden 
features allow you to perform “paperwork” tasks. These features are avail-
able in different areas, so before I tell you what each page can do, you 
should be familiar with the pages.
Dealing with the My eBay: Active Selling Page
With Active selling page, shown in Figure 5-2, you can keep an eye on 
your store’s item listings, your fixed-price sales, and the progress of your 
auctions. 
 
Figure 5-2: 
The Active 
Selling 
page.
 
The general layout
At the top of the page, you’ll see a tote board that gives you an idea of your 
sales during the past 31 days. eBay also shows the total items currently up 
for sale. The total dollar amount of the items that have been bid on appears 
with these totals. At the left side of each listing, eBay has a column for icons.
Depending on how you customize the view (which I describe in the next sec-
tion), you can see how many bids your auctions have, whether your reserves 
have been met, and how much time remains before the auction closes. By 
clicking an auction title, you can visit the auction to make sure your pictures 
are appearing or to check your counter.

358
Dealing with the My eBay: Active Selling Page
 
Don’t be frustrated if you don’t have a ton of bids. Many, many people watch 
auctions and don’t bid until the last minute, so you may not see a lot of bid-
ding activity on your page. Be sure to customize your page and select the # 
of Watchers option so you can get a grip on how many people are interested 
in your item. 
Customizing your display
To customize what you see when you go to your My eBay Page, just click the 
General Settings link. Some of us prefer the Summary page to show up first, 
and others prefer to see the Active Selling page. It’s up to you. Click the link 
in the upper right to set your options. After you click it, you see the screen 
shown in Figure 5-3. 
Optionally, you can select whether or not you want the item ID, listed-on 
date, picture, and so on to appear alongside the item on the page. Also, if 
you scroll to the bottom of the listing page, you’ll see a tool that will allow 
you to indicate the number of items you would like to view per page. You 
can choose from 10 (default), 25, 50, 75, 100 (and if you love to scroll) 200 
items per page. Otherwise you’ll click the links that can take you to the next 
page of your listings.

Aside from selecting the format of the items you’d like to see you can 
perform several actions via the drop-down menus at the top of the Active 
Selling page:
 
✦ View: You can further filter the listings you see. To select only items 
with bids, open offers (on the Best Offer format), items without bids, or 
Reserve not met.
 
✦ Store Category: If you have an eBay Store, you can view the listings by 
your own named store categories. 
 
✦ Sort By: As in any easy Search, you can choose to see those listings with 
Time left: Ending Soonest, Newly Listed, or sort by Price; lowest first or 
highest first.
 
If you have an eBay Store, you’re entitled to use Selling Manager — for free 
— which is quantum leaps better than using the All Selling page. The only 
caveat is that eBay expects you to request to use it. To do so, choose 
Sell➪Seller Tools in the eBay navigation bar. On the resulting page, you can 
sign up for Selling Manager, and the sign-up page will reflect your no-charge 
status.
Taking action when necessary
Make sure you pay attention to the Action drop-down list that appears at 
the end of each listing (refer to Figure 5-2). This menu has powerful menu 
options that allow you to do the following:
 
✦ Sell Similar: List an item similar to the one on your page.
 
✦ Search in Want It Now: Clicking here takes you to the Want It Now area 
that relates to the category your item is listed in. I’m not sure why you 
would ever want to do this.

✦ Revise: Change a listing that has no bids.
 
✦ Add to Description: Add text to your listing’s description after the list-
ing has bids.
 
✦ End Item: When the dog plays tug-of-war with your item, you can end 
the listing.
 
✦ Add note: If you want to add a notation (which only you can see and 
only on this page), select the check box to the left of the item and then 
click the Add Note button at the top of the listings. Just type your com-
ment on the page that appears and click Save.
 
Auctions that appear in green have received one or more bids (and met any 
reserves you’ve set). Auctions in red haven’t received any bids or the reserve 
price hasn’t been met. Dutch auctions aren’t color-coded and appear in black.
Getting Excited About the My eBay: Sold Page
Clicking the Sold link (on the left side of the page in the Summary box under 
the Sell header) takes you to a list of all the items you’ve sold.
The Sold page keeps your sales in a concise place, as shown in Figure 5-5. 
I use it in lieu of fancy auction management software. If you’re selling hun-
dreds of items, your list will probably be too long to monitor individual auc-
tions — but you can view the total current price of the items that will sell.

Getting Excited About the My eBay: Sold Page
The Sold items page has the following features, which I’m sure you’ll find 
helpful in completing your transactions:
 
✦ Check box: Select a check box to perform a task on one or more of the 
items, such as remove from the list, add a note, or print a shipping label.
 
✦ Buyer’s user ID and feedback rating: The eBay ID of the winner of the 
sale. Click it to go to the user’s Member Profile, where you can use eBay’s 
e-mail sever to contact the buyer (or just use the drop-down menu to 
Contact Buyer). (You can also customize this area to display the buyer’s 
e-mail address instead of his or her user ID for identification.)
 
✦ Quantity: If the sale was for multiple items, the number of items is dis-
played here.
 
✦ Item title: A direct link to the auction. You can click this link to check 
on your auction and see the other bidders, should you want to make a 
second chance offer.
 
✦ Item ID number: An optional setting that I don’t use, it’s the listing 
number for your records.
 
✦ Sale price: The final selling price for your item.
 
✦ Total price: The final selling price plus the shipping amount.
 
✦ Sale date: Keep an eye on the end date so you can be sure you get your 
payment as agreed.
 
✦ Action: Here’s where you find a hidden drop-down list that works with 
the icons to the right, offering links to various actions you can take:
 
• Mark as paid: If the customer hasn’t paid using PayPal, you can indi-
cate the method of payment (after you receive it).
 
• View payment status: See a copy of the payment receipt (if the buyer 
paid using PayPal) or see a notation you inserted regarding other 
payment methods.
 
• Print shipping label: You can print a shipping label from here. See 
Book VII for more professional options.
 
• Leave feedback: Leave feedback with a single click once you’ve 
heard that the item arrived safely and your customer is happy.
 
• Mark shipped: After you’ve shipped the item, click here to indicate 
that it’s on the way.
 
• Second chance offer: Click here to make a second chance offer to 
one of your underbidders if you have multiple items for sale.
 
• Sell similar: When you want to list a similar item (or relist a sold 
one) you can do it quickly here.
 
• Relist: Here you can relist your item on the site.

Trying Again with the My eBay: Unsold Page
 
 Not all the action links appear on every item; they appear based on 
the progress of the item in the sales process.
 
✦ Icons: My eBay has several icons that appear dimmed until you perform 
an action with the Action command. You may also click the icons at the 
top of the list to sort your listings by auctions completed, although most 
sellers prefer to keep the listings in the default chronological order.
 
• Shopping cart: The buyer has completed checkout (supplying a 
shipping address and a planned payment method).
 
• Dollar sign: The buyer has paid using PayPal, or you’ve noted that 
the buyer has paid with a different form of payment (such as a 
money order or a personal check) on the drop-down list within the 
sale record.
 
• Shipping box: You’ve indicated that the item has shipped.
 
• Star with Pen: You’ve left feedback for the buyer.
 
• Star in an envelope: The buyer has left you feedback. A plus sign (+) 
indicates a positive comment, and a minus sign (–) indicates a nega-
tive comment.
Trying Again with the My eBay: Unsold Page
The Unsold page, shown in Figure 5-6 indicates the items that didn’t sell. To

✦ Sell Similar, if the item hasn’t sold after two listings. This option starts 
the cycle in eBay’s computer fresh as new.
 
✦ Relist as Store Inventory, if you have an eBay store.
 
✦ Add to List, for items that you for some unknown reason would like to 
add to a list. You can use eBay’s suggestions for Wish List, Research, or 
Gift List. You can also make up your own.
Notifying Winners and Sending Invoices
Thank goodness — somebody submitted a winning bid on one of your items 
in an auction. It’s a good feeling. When I get those end-of-transaction e-mails 
from eBay, I whisper a silent yeah! Then I hold my breath to see whether the 
buyer will go directly to PayPal and make the payment. Usually, that’s what 
happens. More and more buyers are getting savvy and understand about 
paying immediately after winning an item.
New buyers and those who buy or win multiple items from you (my favorite 
kind of buyer!) usually wait to hear from you regarding payment and ship-
ping. Many newbies feel more comfortable hearing from you and knowing 
who they’re doing business with. Also, in the case of multiple purchases, 
you have to recalculate the postage. The sooner you contact the buyer, the 
sooner you’ll get your payment.
Notifying winners
eBay sends out an end-of-transaction e-mail to both the buyer and the seller. 
The e-mail is informative to the seller and a welcome e-mail for the buyer.
Figure 5-7 shows you a typical, “yippee, you won” e-mail. It’s brightly colored 
and joyful, probably designed to evoke some strong level of excitement in 
the buyer.
Both e-mails have similar information; the e-mail to the buyer has a Pay Now 
button, as shown in the figure. The seller’s e-mail has a link to create an 
invoice to send the buyer. Either of these linked forms includes:
 
✦ Item title and number.
 
✦ The final bid or Buy It Now price.
 
✦ Quantity.
 
✦ Seller or buyer’s user ID and e-mail address.
 
✦ Ship-to ZIP code.

364
Notifying Winners and Sending Invoices
 
✦ A link to update your ZIP code.
 
✦ A link for viewing the item. This link is good for up to 90 days. Note 
that this is the only place you get this link, and unless you subscribe to 
eBay’s Selling Manager, you’d better keep hold of it. Sold items remain 
on your My eBay page for 60 days, but the items disappear from the 
eBay search engine within 2 weeks.
 
✦ A buyer’s link to complete checkout to let the seller know how the buyer 
intends to pay.
 
✦ Links to e-Bay help and feedback.
 
Figure 5-7: 
Lucky you! 
You’re a 
winner!
 
That’s a lot of information, and I’ll bet the average user just glances over 
it and either deletes it (bad idea) or files it in a special folder in his or her 
e-mail program.
 
If you think eBay’s notification is good enough, it’s time to rethink your 
customer service policy. An e-mail to the buyer at this point is important. 
Customer contact is the key to a good transaction. If the buyer sprints 
directly to PayPal and sends you some money to pay for a purchase, a 
special e-mail from you is required. Thank the buyer for the payment and 
mention when the item will ship, as detailed in the next section, “Thanking 
them kindly.”

Book III
Chapter 5
Managing Your 
Sales on My eBay
365
Notifying Winners and Sending Invoices
Thanking them kindly
Now’s the time to let the customer know just how darned tickled you are 
that this person spent hard-earned money with you. Your thank-you e-mail 
is a quasi invoice and informational note. What should go in it? Well, try to 
keep in mind what your mother said — always say “please” and “thank you.” 
After thanking the buyer for purchasing your goods, be sure to cover the 
following points (this is where the “please” part comes in):
 
✦ Item name: You don’t want the buyer to forget what was purchased.
 
✦ Payment terms: Let the buyer know what forms of payment you accept 
and how long you intend to wait for your money.
 
✦ Payment address: Be sure to tell the buyer where you want the payment 
sent (should the item be from a category that permits alternate forms of 
payment).
 
✦ PayPal button: Inserting a PayPal button in your e-mail is a snap and may 
pay off in some rapid payments; see Book II, Chapter 4 for instructions.
 
✦ Return policy: Will you accept returns? Under what circumstances? 
It’s okay if you don’t accept returns, but be sure that you had that 
information in your item description before the purchase was made.
 
✦ Reminder to print the e-mail and enclose it with payment: Veteran 
eBay sellers can tell you stories about the money order that arrived with 
no item number, no return address, and no e-mail address — basically 
no clue as to what the payment was for.
 
✦ Store pitch: If you have an eBay store, mention it here. If not, just be 
sure to tell buyers that you’re happy to have them as customers and you 
look forward to serving them again.
 
✦ Feedback pitch: Most PowerSellers that I know include a small pitch at 
the closing of the e-mail for leaving feedback about you on eBay. Remind 
the customers to e-mail you immediately if there’s a problem when the 
order arrives. Stress how you want them to be happy with their pur-
chases. That may stave off a knee-jerk negative that beginners tend to 
leave when an item arrives cracked. (They shoulda bought insurance — 
it helps to require it on fragile items.)
That ought to do it. Including this information will make your newbie buyer 
or old-time veteran feel at home doing business with you.
Thanks for the money!
Sometimes you have to beg for payment. On the other hand, when some 
blessed buyer pays immediately through PayPal, it’s time to show your 
gratitude by sending a “thanks for the money” e-mail. The e-mail can be 
short and sweet and to the point. Be sure to

366
Tracking Payments in All Selling
 
✦ Thank the customer for the purchase and swift payment.
 
✦ Let the customer know when the item will ship.
 
✦ Let the customer know when feedback will be left. I leave feedback only 
when the buyer has received the item and is happy with the transaction.
Tracking Payments in All Selling
You’ve created a winning ad, run a successful auction or sale, notified the 
winner, and sent off an invoice. Now it’s time for the big payoff: getting the 
money in hand for your item. eBay and PayPal work in concert to offer sev-
eral tools to notify you when a payment is made.
Once again, the Sold items area of My eBay comes to the rescue. As if by 
magic, every time one of your buyers makes a payment through the PayPal 
service, your My eBay page indicates that the item has been paid by chang-
ing the dollar-sign icon from dimmed to solid. Take a look back at Figure 5-5, 
and note the items that have been paid using PayPal.
PayPal also sends you a payment received e-mail — but I have a few caveats 
about using this form of notification.
 
If you do not receive any form of notification of a payment received from a 
buyer, check your PayPal account before going through the trouble of send-
ing a nonpaying bidder notice. A new eBay buyer may have misspelled your 
e-mail address or applied the payment to an incorrect item number. If this is 
the case, you’ll have to e-mail the buyer and ask the person to cancel any 
payment made and pay for the item with the correct item number and your 
correct e-mail address.
To confirm the information about a payment shown on the Sold page of My 
eBay, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the drop-down list next to the item’s listing, and select the View 
Order Details option.
 
 The Order Details page appears, as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
2. For further information, click the View PayPal payment link, at the 
top of the page.
 
3. Sign into PayPal with your password and click Continue.
 
 The PayPal Web site’s payment-details screen appears, giving you com-
plete information on the purchase.
After you’ve finished viewing this page, you may click the Return to Log 
button at the bottom of the page to go to your account history page. From 
here, you can transfer the money to your bank account.

Relisting Items without Extra Work
One of the most efficient ways to run an eBay business is to stock the same 
item in quantity. After getting some eBay experience under your belt, you’re 
bound to find several items that you’re comfortable selling. And if you follow 
my suggestions in Book IV, you’ll buy multiples (dozens? cases? pallets?) 
of the items at a seriously discounted price. When you have all these items 
lying around the garage, your goal is to get them into buyers’ hands at a 
profit.
In Book VIII, I talk about opening an eBay store. But in addition to your own 
store, you must be running auctions on the eBay site. Why? Auctions are the 
key to drawing buyers into your store. Stores are not only added potential 
sales but a distinct marketing tool for your personal eBay brand.
 
I know several sellers who bought items in such bulk that they’re stocked 
with the item to sell once a week for the next few years! That’s a good thing 
only if the product is a staple item that will always have a market on eBay.

368
Relisting Items without Extra Work
Relisting after a sale
Yeah! Your space-age can opener with a built-in DVD player sold! Since you 
have three dozen more to sell, the quicker you can get that item back up on 
the site, the sooner you’ll connect with the next customer.
When bidders lose an auction on eBay, one of the first things they do is 
search for somebody offering the same item. The sooner you get an item 
relisted, the sooner a disappointed underbidder will find your listing. Of 
course, relisting the item also makes it available to other interested bidders 
who may not have bid on the item before.
 
When you offer an item for bidding and it reaches well beyond your target 
price, why not offer another one with a Buy It Now option? True, this may 
slow (or possibly end) further bidding on the first item, but if you’ve 
exceeded your target price and folks are hot for your item, sell it to them 
now! That kind of initiative is what eBay is all about.
If at first you don’t succeed
Boo! Your Dansk Maribo dinner plate didn’t sell. Don’t take it personally. 
It’s not that someone out there doesn’t love you. It doesn’t mean your mer-
chandise is trash. It’s just that this particular week, no one was looking for 
Maribo plates (go figure).
Often eBay shoppers shop with no discernable pattern. No one may want 
your item at a certain price one week, and then you may sell five or six the 
next week. It happens to me all the time.
When relisting, you often need to make adjustments. Perhaps the keywords 
in your title aren’t drawing people to your listing. To help you figure out 
whether the problem is you or the market, search for other, similar items 
to see whether anyone is buying. If there’s just no bidding activity (perhaps 
you’re selling bikinis in January?), perhaps that item needs to be retired 
from eBay for a while.
Consider some other variables. Are other items selling on the site with a 
lower starting price? If you can comfortably lower your price, do so. If not, 
wait until other sellers run out of the item. Then put yours up for auction — 
you may just get more bidding action if you’re one of the few sellers offering 
the same item.
I have quite a few items that I purchased by the case — right along with a 
bunch of other eBay sellers. They desperately dumped theirs on the site, 
without paying any attention to the competition. I waited and got my target 
price for the item the following season.

Relisting Items without Extra Work
 
eBay is a supply and demand marketplace. If the supply exceeds the 
demand, prices go down. If you have an item that sells as fast as you can list 
it, prices go up.
Okay, time to relist (rather Sell Similar)
eBay gives you many ways to relist an item. Because this chapter features 
My eBay, I’ll cover that method here. When you upgrade to Selling Manager, 
the procedure is a bit different; visit Book VIII, Chapter 1 for details.
Figure 5-9 shows the seller’s version of a sold item (only the seller sees this 
when he or she is signed in), which (at the very bottom of the page) includes 
Sell One Like This link. Rather than go to each item’s page to relist, however, 
get off the auction page by clicking the Track Your Items in My eBay link and 
go to your My eBay page. The relisting process will be much faster.
 
Figure 5-9: 
Yeah! My 
item sold!
 
 
Relist is best used for unsold items, so you might benefit from a listing fee 
refund if your item sells a second time. The Sell Similar process is used for 
sold items because it starts a new item cycle with eBay — if the item doesn’t 
sell, you can relist it for the unsold-item refund.

eBay Bidder-Management Tools
To sell a similar item, from the Sold page on My eBay, click the drop-down list 
next to the listing and select the Sell Similar option. Now the review step of the 
Sell an Item form appears. You can make any changes you want — or not!
You can go to the All Selling: Unsold items page of My eBay to relist unsold 
items for a possible listing fee credit (in the case of auctions) in the same 
fashion (see Figure 5-10).

eBay Bidder-Management Tools
Most eBay users don’t know the extent of eBay’s seller-specific services. And 
sometimes sellers are so involved with their auctions that they don’t take 
the time to find out about new helper tools. So I’ve gone deep into the eBay 
pond to dig up a few excellent tools to help you with your online business. 
Even if you’ve used some of these before, it might be time to revisit them 
because eBay has implemented quite a few changes during the past year.
Canceling bids
Did you know that you don’t have to accept bids from just anyone? Although 
many people include notices in their auction descriptions attempting to 
qualify bidders ahead of time, this doesn’t always prevent them from bid-
ding on your auction. Alas, part of the business is watching your bidders. 
With bidder-management tools, you can save yourself a good deal of grief.
You could have any number of reasons for wanting to cancel someone’s bid. 
Here are a few more legitimate reasons for canceling a bid:
 
✦ The bidder contacts you to back out of the bid; choosing to be a nice 
guy, you let him or her out of the deal.
 
✦ Your bidder has several negative feedbacks and hasn’t gone through 
with other transactions that he or she has won.
 
✦ You’re unable to verify the bidder’s identity through e-mail or the phone.
 
✦ You need to cancel the auction.

Book III
Chapter 5
Managing Your 
Sales on My eBay
371
eBay Bidder-Management Tools
 
When you plan to cancel someone’s bid, you should first e-mail that person 
and clearly explain why you’re doing so. Your bid cancelation appears in the 
auction’s bidding history and becomes part of the auction’s official record. 
For that reason, I recommend that you leave a concise, unemotional, one-
line explanation on the cancelation form as to why you’ve canceled the bid.
Many eBay sellers bemoan the fact that inter-
national buyers bid on their items, when the 
items clearly state that they do not ship inter-
nationally. Also, they get upset when a bidder 
with minus-level feedback wins an item.
Quit whining and do something about it! On 
your My eBay➪My Account➪Site Preferences 
page, you can set defaults that will affect your 
bidders. On this page, scroll to Site Preferences: 
Buyer Requirements.
Click the Edit link to change your preferences. 
On the Buyer Requirements page (see the 
figure), you may indicate whom you do not 
want to be permitted to bid on your items. If 
any of your bidders fall into that category and 
attempt to bid, they will see a notice saying 
they are unable to bid.
In the case of international buyers, I have found 
that they e-mail me to ask me to ship to them. I 
check their feedback, and if it’s clear to me that 
they know the ropes, I can put their user ID on 
my Blocked Bidder Exception list and they’re 
free to win my item.
eBay preferences settings

372
eBay Bidder-Management Tools
To get to the bid cancelation form, start on the eBay Site Map (the link at the 
right hand side of the page – just below the navigation bar, Under the Selling 
activities head, find the link to Cancel Bids on your listing. You’ll now be 
able to access the bid-cancelation form. You can get to the cancelation form 
directly by typing the following in your browser:
http://offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?CancelBidShow
Ending your listing early
You may decide to end a listing early for any number of reasons. If any bids 
are on your auction before ending it, you are duty-bound to sell to the high-
est bidder. So before ending an auction early, it’s polite to e-mail everyone 
in your bidder list, explaining why you’re canceling bids and closing the auc-
tion. If an egregious error in the item’s description is forcing you to take this 
action, let your bidders know whether you’re planning to relist the item with 
the correct information.
After you’ve e-mailed all the bidders, you must then cancel their bids by 
using the bid cancelation form; for the link to this form, see the preceding 
section “Canceling bids.”
 
When ending a listing that has bids, the seller has the option of canceling all 
bids or leaving the bids, thus making the high bidder the winner of the 
closed listing.
To end a listing, use the drop-down list next to the listing on the Active 
Selling page. Select the drop-down menu next to the item and click the End 
Item link to end your listing. You can also go directly to
http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?EndingMyAuction
Following are some legitimate reasons for ending your sale:
 
✦ You no longer want to sell the item. Your account may be subject to a 
nonselling seller warning unless you have a good reason.
 
✦ An error occurred in the minimum bid or reserve amount. Perhaps 
your spouse really loves that lamp and said you’d better get some good 
money for it, but you started the auction at $1.00 with no reserve.
 
✦ The listing has a major error in it. Maybe you misspelled a critical key-
word in the title.
 
✦ The item was somehow lost or broken. Your dog ate it?

Book III
Chapter 5
Managing Your 
Sales on My eBay
373
eBay Bidder-Management Tools
 
I don’t recommend canceling an auction unless you absolutely have to 
because it’s just bad business. People rely on your auctions being up for the 
stated amount of time. They may be planning to bid at the last minute, or 
they may just want to watch the action for a while. Also, if you have bids on 
the item, you may be in violation of one of eBay’s policies and be branded as 
a nonselling seller.
Blocking buyers
If you don’t want certain buyers bidding on your auctions, you can remove 
their capability to do so. Setting up a list of bidders that you don’t want to 
do business with is legal on eBay. If someone that you’ve blocked tries to 
bid on your auction, the bid won’t go through. A message will be displayed 
notifying the bidder that he or she can’t bid on the listing and should contact 
the seller for more information.
You can block as many as 1000 users from bidding on your auctions. 
However, I recommend that you use this option only when absolutely 
necessary. Situations — and people — change, and it’s best to try to clear up 
problems with particular bidders.
You can Block Buyers from the Managing Bidders and Buyers page, 
located at
http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/manage_bidders_ov.html
You can reinstate a bidder at any time by going to the Buyer Blocking box at
http://cgi1.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?bidderblocklogin
and deleting the bidder’s user ID.

PayPal Particulars
PayPal (see Figure 6-1) is a reliable payment service that allows buyers to 
safely click and pay with a credit card, eCheck, or PayPal balance, directly 
from eBay, after they’ve won an auction or made a purchase. It’s conven-
iently integrated into all eBay transactions, and if your auction uses the Buy 
It Now or Smart Logo feature, you can have buyers immediately pay for their 
purchases with PayPal payments.
You must register a special account to accept PayPal payments and you 
must have a premier- or business-level account to accept credit-card pay-
ments. Buyers may join when they win their first auctions and want to pay 
with PayPal, or they can go to www.PayPal.com and sign up. The story is 
slightly different for the seller. For convenience, you should set up your 
PayPal account before you choose to accept PayPal in your auctions or sales.

Here are more than a few particulars about PayPal accounts:
 
✦ eBay sales payments are deposited into your PayPal account. Choose 
one of several ways to get your money:
 
• Have the money electronically transferred directly into your regis-
tered checking account.
 
• Receive payment by check (PayPal charges $1.50 for the check).
 
• Keep the money in your PayPal account for making payments to 
other sellers.
 
• Withdraw the cash from an ATM with a PayPal debit card.
 
•  Use the PayPal debit card and get 1.5% cash back on purchases 
made with the card.
 
• Shop online with a virtual MasterCard debit card that carries your 
balance to any Web site that accepts MasterCard.
 
✦ PayPal has its own feedback system, the Seller Reputation number. 
The number after a user’s name reflects the number of unique PayPal-
verified users with which the user has conducted business. The higher 
the number, the more likely the user is experienced and trustworthy. 
Clicking the number displays a report like the one shown in Figure 6-2.

✦ As a seller with a premier or business account, you can choose to 
accept or deny a payment without a confirmed address. A confirmed 
address means that the ship-to address indicated by the buyer is the 
same as the billing address on the credit card the buyer chose to reg-
ister with PayPal. On the Accept or Deny page, information about the 
buyer is shown — including verification status, account-creation date, 
and participation number.
 
✦ PayPal assesses your account $10 for any chargeback. The fee is waived 
if you’ve fulfilled the requirements in the PayPal seller-protection policy.
 
 To specify whether you want to accept a credit card payment from a buyer 
without a confirmed address, log on, go to your account, and then click the 
Profile tab. Next, scroll down the Selling Preferences area and click Payment 
Receiving Preferences. At the top of the page that’s displayed, you have the 
option of choosing to accept, not accept, or decide on a case-by-case basis 
payments from users without confirmed addresses. 
 
✦ The PayPal seller protection policy protects you against chargebacks, 
unauthorized card use, and nonshipments. To comply with this policy, 
you must do the following:
 
• Have a verified business or premier account: Allow PayPal to con-
firm with your bank that your checking account and address are 
your own.
 
• Keep proof of shipping that can be tracked online: Here’s where 
those delivery confirmation things really come in handy. You can also 
input your tracking or delivery confirmation numbers on the PayPal 
site, and they will send an e-mail to the buyer with that number.

• Require signature receipt on items valued at more than $250.00.
 
• Ship tangible goods: PayPal doesn’t cover goods transmitted elec-
tronically.
 
• Accept only single payments from a single account: Don’t let a 
buyer try to pay portions of a purchase from different e-mail address 
accounts. Someone who’s trying to pay using several accounts may 
be attempting to defraud you.
 
One of the truly brilliant features of PayPal is that you can download your 
sales history and your deposit history to your computer. Although they also 
offer files that integrate with QuickBooks (more on QuickBooks in Book IX), 
the standard downloads are feature-rich. Rather than importing just sales 
figures, you see each and every detail of your transaction — dates, names, 
addresses, phone numbers, amounts, and more. Even fees and taxes (if you 
charge sales tax) are broken down separately, making your bookkeeping a 
breeze. The download imports into Microsoft Works (which comes on 
almost every new computer) and Excel. Downloading your history will help 
you calculate income taxes and sales taxes, reconcile your accounts, predict 
sales trends, calculate total revenues, and perform other financial reporting 
tasks. It will also give you an excellent customer database.
The Deposits download will give you detailed information for all the deposits 
that you receive: payments, transaction and deposit fees, refunds, rebates, 
and any adjustments made to your account. To find out more about down-
loading, check out Book II, Chapter 4.
Registering with PayPal
If you aren’t registered with PayPal yet (what’s holding you up?), you’ll find a 
convenient link on your My eBay: All Selling page in the Selling links area. To 
register, just click the PayPal link. The PayPal Seller Overview page appears, 
as shown in Figure 6-3. Click the Sign Up button, and you arrive at the begin-
ning of the PayPal registration process. Tell them what country you’re from, 
fill in the basic required information, and you’re in.
The convenience of PayPal’s integration with eBay shines when you put the 
Smart Logo option in your auctions. Winners just click a link that pops up on 
your auction page immediately after the auction closes. When you list auc-
tions, you preset the shipping and handling charges that appear in the ship-
ping box at the bottom of the page. When winners click the Pay Now button 
(see Figure 6-4), they’re taken directly to a payment page set up with your 
information. It’s just as easy as when they purchase something through Buy 
It Now (as shown in Figure 6-5).

The buyer can add optional insurance or combine other items, as shown in 
Figure 6-6. When the final total amount is correct, the buyer is brought to 
PayPal to pay for the item. The payment is deposited in your PayPal account 
and held until you choose how you want to withdraw it.

Because credit-card and identity theft is so prevalent on the Internet — and 
such an expensive burden to e-commerce — PayPal uses the extra security 
measure provided by Visa and MasterCard called CVV2. This system requires 
you to input the 3 additional numbers (immediately following the regular 
16-digit number) from the back of your credit card. Because merchants aren’t 
allowed to store these numbers, but merely use them for security and

The Auction and Merchant Tools
verification purposes, the numbers are presumably protected from hackers. 
However, in the unlikely event that your credit card doesn’t have these num-
bers yet, PayPal still allows you to use your card by verifying it through a pro-
cedure known as random charge. PayPal charges about $1 to your card and 
asks you to disclose the PIN number printed on your statement. Then PayPal 
knows that you control the card and didn’t steal it.
 
Withdraw your funds from the PayPal account on a regular basis; you 
need that money to operate your business. Don’t let it become a temporary 
savings account — unless you choose the PayPal Money Market fund 
account (check out www.PayPal.com for more details). Realize that any 
money you have in your account can be extricated for a chargeback, and 
chargebacks can be applied as many as 60 days after the transaction. For 
more about chargebacks, see Chapter 7.
The Auction and Merchant Tools
When you’re logged into your PayPal account, you’ll see two tabs at the top 
of the screen labeled Merchant Tools and Auction Tools. The merchant tools 
are mostly for use on your business Web site (discussed in Book VIII). One 
that you might find handy is the e-mail invoice tool, discussed later in this 
chapter. What you need for your eBay sales are the auction tools. Click the 
Auction Tools tab, and the screen shown in Figure 6-7 appears.

Payment Tracking Information
It seems PayPal acknowledges that their merchants are more than likely also 
sellers on eBay. (Ya think?) In the Auction Tools page, you’ll find lots of links 
to all the information you’d ever care to know for example, Add PayPal to 
Your Listings. This link goes to your PayPal preference settings for your auc-
tion accounts. Here you may insert PayPal logos manually or automatically 
in your eBay sales pages.
On this page you see a list of your PayPal registered eBay user IDs. By 
clicking the on/off links, you can turn on and off Automatic Logo Insertion, 
Winning Buyer Notification, and PayPal Preferred.
You may also add another eBay user ID (if you have more than one). To add 
another user ID, click the Add button. To change any of your eBay pass-
words, click the Edit Password button.
Payment Tracking Information
PayPal is the premier tool for verifying that a payment has been made. 
Although PayPal has numerous methods for confirming payment, you need 
to make the final confirmation.
Payment notification through e-mail
When you receive a payment through PayPal, they send you a payment 
confirmation e-mail. The e-mail is a good tip-off that you’ve received a 
payment. Notice I said good, but not infallible.
In these days of spoofed e-mail sent by scammers to remove money from 
hard-working people’s wallets, I rarely rely solely on e-mail confirmation. 
When I receive one of these e-mails, I open my Internet browser and go right 
to PayPal’s secure server at
https://www.PayPal.com
When I get to the PayPal Web site, I can confirm with certainty that the 
payment has been made by looking at my PayPal Account Overview.
The Outlook Payment Request Wizard
Have you ever done business with someone who asks you, “How do I pay 
by PayPal?” Or how about when someone wants to purchase multiple items 
from your Web site and you need to send a combined invoice?

Y
our hard work finally pays off. The hours spent in selecting your items, 
photographing them, and writing brilliant auction copy all come down 
to one thing: getting paid. At first thought, you might be happy to take any 
form of negotiable paper, bonds, and stocks (okay, no dot-com stock). 
However, receiving and processing payments takes time and patience. The 
more payment methods that you accept, the more you have to keep track 
of. Narrow the payment choices you offer and you’ll have less bookkeep-
ing hassle. Throughout this chapter, I detail the various payment options 
(including how to handle payments from international buyers) and how 
each affects your business.
Watching for Changes in Policy
In early 2009, eBay plans policy changes regarding how sellers may accept 
payments for their items. All sellers must accept some sort of paperless 
payment and may accept checks or money orders for items listed in only 
certain categories.
If you’re selling in the following areas of eBay, you can still accept old fash-
ioned, paper payments:
 
✦ eBay Motors 
 
• Cars & Trucks
 
• Motorcycles
 
• Powersports

Accepting the Simple Money Order
 
• Boats
 
• Other Vehicles & Trailers
 
✦ Business & Industrial
 
• Agriculture & Forestry ➪ Tractors & Farm Machinery
 
• Construction ➪ Heavy Equipment, Trailers
 
• Restaurant & Catering ➪ Concession Trailers & Carts ➪ Concession

• Healthcare, Lab & Life Science ➪ Imaging & Aesthetics Equipment
 
• Industrial Supply, MRO ➪ Fork Lifts & Other Lifts
 
• Manufacturing & Metalworking ➪ Manufacturing Equipment
 
• Office, Printing & Shipping➪ Commercial Printing Presses
 
✦ Real Estate
 
✦ Everything Else➪ Mature Audiences
I highly recommend that you watch eBay’s announcements pages for any 
changes in policy. If you violate this new payment policy, eBay may end your 
listing, and you’ll have a ding on your eBay permanent record (kinda like get-
ting detention in high school — but dangerous to your income).
Accepting the Simple Money Order
I begin my discussion of payments with money orders and cashier’s checks 
because I think they’re just the greatest way to receive payment. Money 
orders and cashier’s checks are fast, cheap, and negotiable (just like cash). 
Cashier’s checks are purchased at a bank and are generally debited imme-
diately from the winner’s checking account at purchase. For some unknown 
reason, banks take it upon themselves to charge a minimum of $5 to issue a 
cashier’s check. This is a pretty steep charge to the winner, which is why I 
suggest money orders.
Money orders cost less than a dollar and are available almost anywhere. 
After a quick survey of my neighborhood, I found money order deal-
ers galore. All the stores I spoke to charge 99 cents for a money order in 
amounts up to $500. In this section, I detail just four vendors (both online 
and off) that offer money order services. Table 7-1 shows a cost comparison 
of these vendors.

If you want money orders, you should familiarize yourself with the various 
charges so that you can recommend the most reasonable amount to your 
auction winners. Asking buyers to pay a large fee to pay you is unfair — 
unless they’re international. In that case, paying by money order through an 
issuer such as American Express (with offices in most countries) is the best 
way for them to pay you. International buyers deal in the currency of their 
own countries; when they purchase a money order and send it in dollars, 
you’re paid with cash in good old American greenbacks.
 
Many sellers bring their money orders to the post office when they ship 
their packages and cash them for their petty cash funds or to pay for 
outgoing postage.
Pay Me When You Get This
I can’t say enough about COD — to discourage you from using this payment 
method. But I’m gonna try! Even though soliciting a C.O.D. payment is a 
violation of eBay policy, sometimes a buyer will want an item quickly and 
ask for the item to be shipped in this fashion (for any number of creative 
reasons). 
You give your package to the post office, UPS, or FedEx, who collects the 
payment after delivering the package. Sound straightforward and easy? What 
happens when the carrier tries to deliver the package and the recipient isn’t 
home? Your item can sit with the shipper for a week or two, during which 
time the buyer may decide that he or she doesn’t want to pick up the item 
from the shipper. If you’re lucky, you’ll get the item back in two to three 
weeks. The cash-on-delivery service is also expensive. In addition to post-
age, the post office charges $5.50 for COD service.

392
The Check Is in the Mail
Another bad part of COD? You might wait a month to receive payment, even 
when the addressee is home the first time and accepts delivery. Do yourself 
a favor and don’t offer COD as a payment option. You’re only asking for trou-
ble. You’re not a bank, and you’re not in the finance business. Even if you 
are, get your money up front.
The Check Is in the Mail
Personal checks are the easiest way for buyers to make payments: They just 
dash off a check and put it in the mail. It doesn’t always work out so easily 
for the seller. You have to deposit the check into your bank account first and 
then wait for the check to clear. Believe it or not, in these days of electronic 
transfers, wiring funds, and international money transfers, you still might 
wait more than two weeks for a check to clear.
Paper checks
After you deposit a check, your bank sends it to a central clearinghouse, 
which sends it to the signatory’s bank clearinghouse. Then the individual 
bank decides whether the check can be paid. You may think that a way 
around the system is to call the bank and see whether the account currently 
has sufficient money in it. The account may have sufficient funds when you 
call, but the check will bounce if the depositor withdraws money before the 
check gets through the system. 
 
Don’t forget the 24-hour turnaround rule: Even if the bank has the money 
and you’re standing there with the check, the bank can deny payment within 
24 hours after telling you the money is in the account, leaving you with a bad 
check.
Even though everything seems to be electronic these days, the paper rout-
ing of old-fashioned checks can take two weeks or longer. The only bad 
check I’ve ever received as an eBay payment was deposited. After waiting 
ten business days, I shipped the item. On the eleventh business day, I got 
the bounced check back from the bank. The buyer clearly knew that the 
check had bounced but didn’t notify me. Luckily the buyer made good on 
the check.
 
If you find yourself with a check bouncing higher than a superball and an 
uncooperative buyer, remember that it’s against the law to pass bad checks.

The Check Is in the Mail
For example, if a California or Indiana resident passes a bad check, you are 
legally able to collect three times the amount of the bad check!
Bottom line? Warn your winners that you may hold the check for more than 
two weeks before you ship. I make exceptions for buyers I’ve successfully 
done business with before or those with an impeccable feedback rating.
Dealing with personal checks isn’t worth the potential grief they can cause. 
Try to get an eCheck or an instant transfer through PayPal (as described 
in the next section), or have your winners pay with credit cards through a 
payment service (as described in the “I Take Plastic” section, later in this 
chapter).
eChecks and instant transfers
Despite the attached fees and a short waiting period, accepting a PayPal 
eCheck or an instant transfer is a nice, clean transaction. After indicat-
ing that they want to pay with an eCheck, buyers must register their bank 
accounts with PayPal and give PayPal the information required.
When a buyer pays with an electronic check, it takes as many as four 
days to clear. An instant transfer, on the other hand, credits your account 
immediately — as long as the buyer has a credit card or bank debit card 
as a backup funding source. PayPal allows you to accept eChecks for up to 
$10,000 but will charge you up to $5 fee per transaction.
Accepting cash payments
In concordance with eBay’s new policies, the 
only way you are allowed to accept cash for 
an item is for an in-person transaction. I’m 
sure you’ve received cash from some of your 
winners. I don’t like cash. If the buyer doesn’t 
send the exact amount due, you have to call the 
buyer, who may claim that the correct amount 
should be there. And mail can be stolen. We 
had a rash of mail thievery where I live; people 
were stealing envelopes right out of mailboxes. 
All of a sudden, you must have lost the differ-
ence — and you have no recourse with cash.
Postal inspectors are constantly battling this 
problem, but you won’t know your mail is being 
stolen until you’ve missed enough mail — usu-
ally bills and outgoing checks. Explaining to a 
buyer that the money never arrived is difficult. 
You can e-mail, phone, talk, and discuss, but 
the bottom line is that you haven’t received your 
money and the buyer insists that you have.

Hold This for Me — in Escrow
Hold This for Me — in Escrow
Escrow.com, eBay’s official escrow service, makes it more comfortable for 
the buyer to proceed with transactions over $2000, which is the upper limit 
for PayPal buyer protection. Buyers gain peace of mind by using escrow 
because they know the transaction will be completed securely and easily. 
(A less expensive way to reassure your buyer when you’re participating in 
high-dollar transactions is called a bonded auction. See Book VIII, Chapter 2 
for the details.)
As a new user, you or your buyer must register to use the service. When you 
want to offer escrow as a payment option in one of your listings, be sure to 
indicate such on the Sell an Item form so that it appears on the listing page. 
After the sale closes, the seller should initiate the escrow by going to the 
Escrow.com site or to eBay.
To initiate escrow go to www.escrow.com. On the home page, shown in 
Figure 7-1, register or sign in under the Start an Escrow Now heading. On the 
following page, you start the process by typing the eBay item number.

Hold This for Me — in Escrow
To proceed with escrow, the process goes something like this:
 
1. The buyer sends payment to Escrow.com.
 
 Escrow.com accepts most credit cards (including American Express and 
Discover), cashier’s checks, money orders, wire transfers, and personal 
or business checks. A check is subject to a ten-day delay.
 
2. After the buyer makes the payment, Escrow.com asks the seller to ship 
the item to the buyer. 
 
 When the buyer receives the merchandise, the inspection period begins 
promptly at 12:01 a.m. the next weekday and continues for a time previ-
ously set by the buyer and seller.
 
3. If the merchandise passes inspection, the buyer notifies Escrow.com 
that the merchandise is approved, and then Escrow.com releases pay-
ment to the seller. 
 
4. If the buyer doesn’t feel that the merchandise is what was represented 
in the listing, the buyer must return the item to the seller in its origi-
nal condition, adhering to the Escrow.com shipping requirements. 
 
 The buyer also must log on to the Escrow.com Web site to input return 
shipping information. In the event of a return, the seller has the same 
inspection period to ensure that the item was returned in its original 
condition. 
 
5. After the successful return of the merchandise is confirmed, Escrow.
com refunds the buyer (less the escrow fee and, if agreed upon ahead 
of time, the shipping fee).
Either the buyer or the seller can pay the escrow fee; the two can even split 
the cost. But you need to decide who will pay the fee up front and indicate 
this in your listing. The buyer is responsible for paying the escrow fee for 
all returns, no matter who had initially agreed to pay the fees. In Table 7-2, I 
include a listing of escrow fees. (Credit cards are not accepted for payment 
for amounts over $5,000.00.)

Sadly, escrow service has also become one of the most highly publicized 
scams on the Internet. Unscrupulous sellers set up fake escrow sites, sell a 
bunch of high-dollar items to unsuspecting buyers, and then direct the 
buyers to the faux-escrow Web site to set up what they think will be an 
escrow account. The buyers send their money (thinking the transaction is 
safe), and after the fraudulent sellers collect a bunch of money, they shut 
down the Web site and abscond with the money! Small wonder that many 
buyers are gun-shy of using escrow to pay for expensive items. Consider 
bonding your transactions to lure higher bids and confer a guarantee to the 
buyer. (Read the details of bonding in Book VIII, Chapter 2.)

As people become more comfortable using credit cards on the Internet, 
credit cards become more popular for eBay payments. Plus, major credit-
card payment services have made insured eBay payments available to their 
registered users — making credit cards safe for the buyer and easy for you. 
And credit-card transactions are instantaneous; you don’t have to wait for a 
piece of paper to travel cross-country.
For all this instantaneous money transfer, however, you have to pay a price. 
Whether you have your own merchant account (a credit-card acceptance 
account in your business’s name) or take credit cards through a payment 
service (more on this in a minute), you pay a fee. Your fees can range from 
2 to 7 percent, depending on how you plan to accept cards and which ones 
you accept. Unfortunately, many states have made it illegal to charge a 
credit-card surcharge to make up this difference. You have to write off the 
expense of accepting credit cards as part of your business budget.
 
The fees to the seller for accepting credit cards for brick-and-mortar stores 
are much less than those for online, mail, or phone orders. In most promo-
tional material, the vendor usually quotes the “swiped card” rates. Since you 
won’t have the buyer’s card in hand to swipe, be sure to inquire with your 
provider for the proper rate before signing any papers.
 
I have to explain the downside of accepting credit cards for your online sales. 
To protect yourself, please be sure to check the bidders’ feedback — both the 
feedback they’ve received and feedback they’ve left — before accepting any 
form of credit-card payment for a high-ticket item. Some buyers are chronic 
complainers and are rarely pleased with their purchases. If someone like that 
isn’t satisfied with your item after it ships, he or she can simply call the credit-
card company and get credit for the payment; you’ll be charged back (that is, 
your account will be debited) the amount of the sale. For more info, see the 
“Forget the buyer: Seller beware!” sidebar.

Credit-card payment services
Person-to-person payment systems, such as eBay’s PayPal, allow buyers to 
authorize payments from their credit cards or checking accounts directly to 
the seller. These services make money by charging percentages and fees for 
each transaction. It’s all done electronically through an automated clearing-
house — no fuss, no muss. The payment service releases only the buyer’s 
shipping information to the seller; all personal credit-card information is 
kept private. This speeds up the time it takes for the buyer to get merchan-
dise because sellers are free to ship as soon as the service lets them know 
that the buyer has made payment and the payment has been processed.
From the seller’s point of view, person-to-person payment service transac-
tion fees are lower than the 2.5 to 3.5% (per transaction) that traditional 
credit-card companies charge for merchant accounts. (Get the details in the 
“Your very own merchant account” section, coming up.) So even traditional 
retailers may switch their online business to these services to save money. 
Throughout this section, I discuss the top payment services and how each 
works.
 
Before you decide which credit-card payment service to use, get out your 
calculator and check out Web sites for current rates. Calculate your own 
estimates; don’t rely on a site’s advertised samples. Charts on the Web sites 
tend to leave out certain minor fees. I’ve also found that for promotional 
purposes (I assume), comparison charts quoting the competition’s prices 
tend to include optional fees.
 
When you pay the fee to your payment service, the total amount of your 
transaction — including shipping fees, handling charges, and any sales tax 
that you charge — incurs a fee. The payment service charges a percentage 
based on the total dollar amount that’s run through its system.
ProPay payments
There’s a new eBay Certified Provider that’s a payment provider; ProPay. 
Before you get too excited, recognize that ProPay services are offered to 
eBay PowerSellers in the silver, gold, platinum, and titanium levels. ProPay’s 
eAuction Account is integrated with the eBay checkout process so that sell-
ers can receive payments as easily as with PayPal.
Of course, there’s nothing free in this world, and so the eAuction Account 
has an annual fee of $24.00. ProPay will reimburse this fee (as a credit to 
their processing charges) after a seller processes over $3,000 with ProPay 
during the first six months following account activation. 

398

Transaction fees are determined by the seller’s PowerSeller tier. For Visa, 
MasterCard, and Discover processing, the fees are as follows:
 
✦ Silver: 2.7 percent and $0.30 USD per transaction.
 
✦ Gold: 2.4 percent and $0.30 USD per transaction.
 
✦ Platinum: 2.4 percent and $0.30 USD per transaction.
 
✦ Titanium: Possibly negotiable.
(Transaction fees for processing American Express are higher.)
Your very own merchant account
If your eBay business is bringing in more than $10,000 a month, a credit card 
merchant account may be for you. However, I recommend that you look at 
the costs carefully. I get at least one e-mail a week soliciting me to set up my 
own merchant account, and each one offers lower fees than the last. But fees 
are often hard to calculate and even harder to compare. Charges are buried 
in the small print. Even those who advertise low fees often don’t deliver. Be 
sure to look at the entire picture before you sign a contract.
 
The best place to begin looking for a merchant account may be your own 
bank. Your bank knows you, your credit history, and your business reputa-
tion — and has a vested interest in the success of your business. If, for what-
ever reason, your credit isn’t up to snuff, I recommend building good credit 
before pursuing a merchant account; as your business grows, your credit 
rating is your feedback to the offline world.
If your bank doesn’t offer merchant accounts for Internet-based businesses, 
find a broker to evaluate your credit history and hook you up with a bank 
that fits your needs and business style. (As a last resort, join Costco, as 
detailed in the following section.) These brokers make their money from 
your application fee, from a finder’s fee at the bank that you finally choose, 
or from both.
After you find a bank, you’re connected to a processor (or transaction clear-
inghouse). Your bank merely handles the banking; the clearinghouse is on 
the other end of your Internet connection when you’re processing transac-
tions, checking whether the credit card you’re taking is valid and not stolen 
or maxed out.
The next step is setting up your gateway, the software (ICVerify or 
PCAuthorize, for example) with which you transmit charges to the clear-
inghouse. Some gateways use HTML Web sites and take the transactions 
directly on Web-based forms (Cybercash or VeriFone, among others). Web-
based gateways connect your Web forms to real-time credit-card processing.

In Table 7-3, I highlight various possible costs associated with setting up and 
maintaining a merchant account. Remember that not all merchant accounts 
pass these charges along. Some may charge just a few; others may take a 
bunch of little snipes at your wallet.
In the following list, I define some of the fees listed in Table 7-3:
 
✦ Setup fee: A one-time cost that you pay to your bank or your broker.
 
✦ Discount rate: A percentage of the transaction amount (a discount from 
your earnings that goes to the bank) taken off the top, along with the 
transaction fee, before the money is deposited into your account.
When a buyer disputes a sale, he or she can 
simply call PayPal or the credit-card company 
and refuse to pay for the item; you lose the sale 
and possibly won’t be able to retrieve your 
merchandise. A payment service or merchant 
account will then charge back your account 
without contacting you and without negotiat-
ing. Technically, the buyer has made the pur-
chase from the payment service — not from 
you — and the payment service won’t defend 
you. I’ve heard of chargebacks occurring as 
long as two months after the transaction. And 
no one is standing at your side, forcing the 
buyer to ship the merchandise back to you. Just 
like eBay fraud protection — see Book I, 
Chapter 5 — the credit-card companies skew 
the rules to defend the consumer. As the seller, 
you have to fend for yourself; see the same 
chapter on how to report fraudulent buyers. 
You usually have no way to verify that the ship-
ping address is actually the one the credit card 
bills to. So, to add to your problems, the card 
may actually be stolen.
PayPal confirms through AVS (address veri-
fication service) that the buyer’s credit-card 
billing address matches the shipping address; 
PayPal gives you the option to not accept pay-
ments from buyers whose addresses don’t 
match. PayPal offers seller protection against 
spurious chargebacks under certain circum-
stances:
 ✓ Credit-card chargebacks from fraudulent 
card use
 ✓ Credit-card chargebacks for false claims of 
nondelivery
 ✓ Buyer complaints for false claims of non-
delivery
If the issuing bank resolves a chargeback in 
the buyer’s favor, PayPal charges you $10 if 
you are determined to be the one at fault, but 
waives the fee if you meet all the requirements 
of the PayPal seller protection policy.
Here’s some good news: Major credit-card 
companies are trying to curb online fraud for 
their merchant accounts. Visa has the new 
Verified by Visa acceptance, which takes 
buyers to a Visa screen (through software 
installed on the merchant’s server) and veri-
fies their identity through a Visa-only pass-
word. MasterCard uses SET (Secure Electronic 
Transactions), a similar encrypted transac-
tion verification scheme. These systems are 
expected to substantially reduce fraud and 
chargebacks.

✦ Transaction fee: A fee per transaction, paid to the bank or to your gate-
way; the fee pays for the network.
 
✦ Gateway or processing fee: Your fee for processing credit cards in real 
time, paid to the Internet gateway.
 
✦ Application fee: A one-time fee that goes to the broker (or perhaps to 
the bank).
 
✦ Monthly minimum processing fee: If your bank’s cut of your purchases 
doesn’t add up to this amount, the bank takes it anyway. For example, if 
your bank charges a minimum monthly fee of $20, and you don’t hit $20 
in fees because your sales aren’t high enough, the bank charges you the 
difference.

If you’re comfortable with all the information in the preceding list and in

thing a broker offers — carefully. Be sure you aren’t missing any hidden 
costs.
If you run your business solely on the Internet, you’ll have to be approved 
for an Internet commerce account. In this case, you should already have the 
following:

Costco has gotten together with Elavon (née Nova Information Systems), one 
of the nation’s largest processors of credit-card transactions, to offer Costco 
executive members a discounted Internet credit-card processing service. See 
Table 7-4 for a list of fees. Costco executive membership brings the cost of 
a Costco membership up from $45 to $100, but you get the benefit of receiv-
ing 2 percent back for most purchases (not including tobacco, gas, food, and 
some other purchases).

’ll bet it’s no surprise to you that most eBay sellers lack a solid retail 
education. Most of us come from different walks of life, and all we know 
about retailing is shopping — that’s probably how we first found eBay. Now 
that game is about to change. The more we choose to sell, the more our busi-
nesses grow, and the more we need to know about the business of retail.
eBay sellers use many types of business models. Some sellers are constantly 
on the prowl for new products and stock their merchandise as soon as they 
find a deal. Others follow the trends and try to get stock of the latest and 
greatest gizmo that they hope will sweep the country (and eBay). And sell-
ers who run their businesses by selling for others are constantly beating the 
pavement for new customers to serve. Then there’s the new eBay e-tailer. 
Just like a brick-and-mortar retailer, today’s eBay e-tailers have to keep 
up on the trends so they can stock up on the most popular items for the 
coming seasons.
Taking Aim with a Six-Month Marketing Plan
The eBay e-tailer buys merchandise to sell on eBay. E-tailers are always 
looking for new wholesalers, but the e-tailers usually specialize in a par-
ticular type of stock item, such as dolls, sports cards, lighting fixtures, or 
apparel. Their eBay business is organized; they sell their merchandise and 
then buy more to replenish their stock. But is this the best way to handle 
things? It definitely works for most sellers, but those who studied retailing 
know that there’s a better way.

408
Pulling Together Your Inventory Data
One of the first things one learns when studying retail buying is the use of 
a six-month merchandise plan. It’s the ultimate tool in the arsenal of a suc-
cessful retail buyer. Although it was originally designed for brick-and-mortar 
retailers, I’ve adapted it here for eBay e-tailers.
Here’s what establishing a six-month merchandising plan gives you:
 
✦ A clear, concise look at your business activity: After you fill out the 
plan, you’ll be able to combine it with the reports generated by your 
bookkeeping program to get a clear, concise picture of your eBay busi-
ness. (I explain proper bookkeeping in Book IX.) This is a business 
and not a guessing game, and handling your business in a professional 
manner will save you a great deal of time and money.
 
 I admit that running by the seat of your pants is fun and exciting, but it’s 
not a solid business practice. One of the reasons I started my own busi-
ness is that an unorganized business format appealed to me. To my 
dismay, I soon learned that organization and planning really did make a 
difference in my bottom line.
 
✦ A basis for growth plans: Anyone who has participated in management 
in a corporation knows about the annual plan. Every year, management 
gets together (with Ouija and dart boards) to projects sales, expenses, 
and profits for the coming year. From this annual exercise, the budget 
for the coming year arises. These are the magic numbers that form 
everyone’s annual raises — along with the company’s plans for growth.
 
✦ A set of attainable and repeatable goals: So, assuming that eBay sell-
ers are online retailers, retail evaluation could help eBay sellers make 
sound business decisions. Making a merchandise plan is a good step in 
that direction. A merchandise plan covers six months at a time and sets 
sales goals. It also helps estimate how much money must be spent on 
merchandise (and when) so that a particular season’s success can be 
replicated and magnified.
Pulling Together Your Inventory Data
You need a few numbers to get your merchandising plan on paper. If you 
aren’t using bookkeeping software yet, you must put together a report that 
reflects the dollar value of your existing inventory. (Book IX, Chapters 2 and 
3 will give you more insight.) If you are using bookkeeping software, you can 
get these numbers easily from the program’s Inventory Valuation report:
 
✦ BOM: The value, in dollars, of your beginning-of-month inventory
 
✦ EOM: The value, in dollars, of your end-of-month inventory

Book IV
Chapter 1
Understanding 
Online Retailing
409
Using the Formulas That Calculate Your Data
 
 The EOM figure for a specific month is the same as the BOM figure for 
the following month. For example, the end-of-month figure for April is 
the same as the beginning-of-month figure for May.
 
✦ Gross sales: Total revenue from sales (not including shipping and 
handling)
 
✦ Markdowns: Total revenue of merchandise you have sold on eBay below 
your target price
To put together your six-month plan, you need to have sales history for a 
six-month period. To get a good historical picture of your sales, however, it’s 
preferable to have at least an entire year’s worth of figures.
 
Your six-month plan can be based on your total eBay sales or only one seg-
ment of your business. For example, if you sell musical instruments along 
with many other sundry items, but you want to evaluate your musical-instru-
ment sales, you can use just those figures for a six-month plan for your 
music department.
What you’re going to establish is your inventory turnover — that is, measure 
how much inventory sells out in a specified period of time. The faster you turn 
over merchandise, the sooner you can bring in new merchandise and increase 
your bottom line. You can also evaluate whether you need to lower your start-
ing price to move out stale inventory to get cash to buy new inventory.
 
When you prepare your six-month plan, set out the months not by the regu-
lar calendar but by a retail calendar, which divides the year into the seasons 
of fall/winter (August 1 through January 31) and spring/summer (February 1 
through July 31). This way, if you want to refer to top national performance 
figures in trade publications or on the Internet, you can base your figures on 
the same standardized retail seasons.
Using the Formulas That Calculate Your Data
Okay, I can admit that bigger minds than mine came up with standard for-
mulas for calculating business success. These formulas are used by retailers 
around the world. If you’re not pulling the figures from a bookkeeping pro-
gram, you can make the calculations as follows:
 
✦ EOM stock = BOM stock + Purchases – Sales
 
✦ BOM stock = EOM stock from the previous month
 
✦ Sales + EOM – BOM = monthly planned purchases
You can make your calculations in dollar amounts or number of units of the 
item. To figure out how much of an item to buy, you must know how much 
you have left in stock.

410
Marketing to Your Customers
Prepare a chart for your own business, similar to the one shown in Table 1-1. 
Study your results and find out which months are your strongest. Let the 
table tell you when you might have to boost your merchandise selection in 
lagging months. It will help bring your planning from Ouija board to reality.

Marketing to Your Customers
When you’re in business, you can’t just consider yourself a retailer; you have 
to be a marketer too. eBay enables sellers in the United States to market 
across a massive geographic area. I’m sure you know how large the area is, 
but what about the people you sell to? You’ve heard of advertising being tar-
geted to the lucrative 18-to-49 age demographic, but what about all the other 
age groups? Who are they? If you learn about your customer, you’ll know 
how to sell to them. It’s all about targeting.
Decide who buys what you want to sell — or, better yet, decide with whom 
you want to deal. If you don’t want to deal with e-mails from teenage gamers, 
for example, perhaps you shouldn’t be selling items that Gen N (defined in a 
moment) is gonna want.

Knowing the Current Market
Marketers often provide blanket definitions about the population based on 
their stages in life, what they’re expected to buy, and which activities they 
participate in. The marketing generations are formed less by biological dates 
than by life experiences and influences. We all know that outside influences 
make a big difference in how we look at things; they also affect how and why 
we buy things.
Table 1-2 gives you the population figures of the United States. With the 
knowledge from this table, you can better decide just how many people will 
be shoppers for your products in the future. The 2000 census pegged the 
country at a total population of 281,421,906: 49.1% male and 50.9% female.

Knowing the Current Market
Just as successful stockbrokers know about individual companies, they also 
need to know about the marketplace as a whole. Sure, I know about the 90 
Webkinz out there, and so does nearly everyone else. To get a leg up on your 
competition, you need to know the big picture as well. Here are some ques-
tions you should ask yourself as you contemplate making buckets of money 
by selling items at eBay:
 
✦ What items are currently hot? If you see everyone around you rushing 
to the store to buy a particular item, chances are good that the item will 
become more valuable as stocks of it diminish. The simple rule of supply 
and demand says that whoever has something everyone else wants 
stands to gain major profits.

412
Knowing the Current Market
 
✦ Do I see a growing interest in a specific item that might make it a big 
seller? If you’re starting to hear talk about a particular item, or even an 
era (’70s nostalgia? ’60s aluminum Christmas trees? Who knew?), listen 
carefully and think of what you own — or can get your hands on — that 
can help you catch a piece of the trend’s action.
 
✦ Should I hold on to this item and wait for its value to increase, or should 
I sell now? Knowing when to sell an item that you think people may want is 
a tricky business. Sometimes you catch the trend too early — and find out 
that you could have commanded a better price if you’d waited. Other times 
you may catch a fad that’s already passé. It’s best to test the market with a 
small quantity of your hoard, dribbling items individually into the market 
until you’ve made back the money you spent to acquire them. When you 
have your cash back, the rest will be gravy.
 
✦ Is a company discontinuing an item I should stockpile now and sell 
later? Pay attention to discontinued items, especially toys and novelty 
items. If you find an item that a manufacturer has a limited supply of, you 
could make a tidy profit. If the manufacturer ends up reissuing the item, 
don’t forget that the original run is still the most coveted and valuable.
 
✦ Was there a recall (due to non-safety issues), an error, or a legal proceed-
ing associated with my item? If so, how will it affect the value of the item? 
For example, a toy recalled for reasons other than safety may no longer be 
appropriate, but it could be rare and collectible if sealed and intact.
 
Some people like to go with their gut feeling about when and what to buy for 
resale at eBay. By all means, if instinct has worked for you in the past, factor 
instinct in here, too. If your research looks optimistic but your gut says, “I’m 
not sure,” listen to it; don’t assume you’re just hearing that lunchtime taco 
talking. Test the waters by purchasing one of the prospective items for 
resale at eBay. If that sale doesn’t work out, you won’t have a lot of money 
invested, and you can credit your gut with saving you some bucks.
If you’re talented in any way, you can sell your 
services on eBay. Home artisans, chefs, and 
even stay-at-home psychics are transacting 
business daily on the site. What a great way 
to make money on eBay — make your own 
product!
Many custom items do well on eBay. People 
go to trendy places (when they have the time) 
such as Soho, the Grove, or the Village to find 
unique custom jewelry. They also go to eBay. 
There’s a demand for personalized invitations, 
cards, and announcements — and even return 
address labels. Calligraphic work or computer-
designed items are in big demand today, but no 
one seems to have the time to make them. Savvy 
sellers with talent can fill this market niche.

Catching Trends in the Media
Catching Trends in the Media
Catching trends is all about listening and looking. You can find all kinds of 
inside information from newspapers, magazines, television, and, of course, 
the Internet. Believe it or not, you can even find out what people are inter-
ested in these days by bribing a kid. Keep your eyes and ears open. When 
people say, “That Taco Bell Chihuahua is everywhere these days,” instead of 
nodding your head vacantly, start getting ideas.
In newspapers
Newspapers are bombarded by press releases and inside information from 
companies the world over. Look for stories about celebrities and upcoming 
movies and see whether any old fads are making a resurgence (you can sell 
items as retro chic).
Read the accounts from trade conventions, such as the New York Toy Fair or 
the Consumer Electronics show. New products are introduced and given the 
thumbs up or down by journalists. Use the information to help determine 
the direction of your area of expertise.
On television
No matter what you think of television, it has an enormous effect on which 
trends come and go and which ones stick. Why else would advertisers sink 
billions of dollars into TV commercials? For example, one Oprah appearance 
for an author can turn a book into an overnight bestseller. Tune in to morn-
ing news shows and afternoon talk shows. The producers of these shows are 
on top of pop culture and move fast to be the first to bring you the next big 
thing. Take what they feature and think of a marketing angle. If you don’t, 
you can be sure somebody else will.
Catch up with youth culture . . .
. . . or at least keep good tabs on it. If you remember cranking up The 
Beatles, James Brown, or The Partridge Family (say what?) until your par-
ents screamed, “Shut that awful noise off,” you may be at that awkward time 
of life when you hardly see the appeal of what young people are doing or lis-
tening to. But if you want tips for hot auction items, tolerate the awful noise 
and listen to the kids around you. Children, especially preteens and teens, 
may be the best trend-spotters on the planet.

Finding eBay’s Soon-to-Be-Hot Sellers
Check out magazines
Magazines geared to the 18-to-34 age group (and sometimes to younger 
teens) can help you stay on top of what’s hot. See what the big companies 
are pitching to this target audience (and whether they’re succeeding). If a 
celebrity is suddenly visible in every other headline or magazine, be on the 
lookout for merchandise relating to that person. (Are we talking hysteria-
plus-cash-flow here or just hysteria?)
Visit social Web sites
So, you say you haven’t been to My Space or Facebook, and you haven’t 
started to Twitter? Wow, you’re living in the days of black-and-white televi-
sion! This is the place to be. The “social Web” as it’s called is branded with 
the top of the top; the most happening things and products. Visit these sites 
and you’ll soon have a clue to what the “cool kids” are doing now.
Finding eBay’s Soon-to-Be-Hot Sellers
Everyone wants to know what the hot ticket is on the eBay site. They want 
to know what’s selling best so that they can run out, buy it, and make big 
money on eBay. Whoa, there, big fella.
As you may know, I’m not a believer in the notion that eBay is a get-rich-
quick program. Nobody has or can give you secret information that magi-
cally transforms you from a garage seller to a warehouse tycoon overnight. 
You get there by studying the market and finding out what works and what 
doesn’t. There are no shortcuts. That said, here’s where you can find infor-
mation on what’s hot or what’s going to be hot on the site.
Hot on the home page
New shoppers to the site generally enter from the home page. In case you 
haven’t noticed, eBay runs promotions smack dab in the center of the 
home page — immediately drawing the attention of anyone who drops in 
to browse the site, as shown in Figure 1-1. Featured items link to an eBay 
search for such items.

Now wouldn’t you be the smart one if you were to list items that coincided 
with the hot items on the site? Oh yeah — and I’ll tell you where you can find 
out what eBay will be listing on the home page ahead of time.
You can click the Sell drop-down menu on the navigation bar and find the 
link to eBay’s What’s Hot area. Or you can go directly to the following:
pulse.ebay.com/
You’ll find a current list of items that account for the most popular searches 
on the site. Use the drop-down category menu (see Figure 1-2) to select the 
leaders within the particular category you plan to list.

eBay Marketplace Research
eBay maintains an area that evaluates item sales on an ongoing basis. Click 
the Sell drop-down menu and choose Seller Tools & eBay Stores. On the 
resulting page, click eBay Marketplace Research from the Choose a Topic 
list on the left; the page you land on is shown in Figure 1-3. Or visit the page 
directly by going to
pages.ebay.com/marketplace_research/ 
Here eBay sellers (and buyers, if they so wish) can access up to 90 days 
of eBay data on completed items. By doing so, you’ll get a firm grip on the 
demand for items you’re planning to sell — with charts trending the average 
bids per item, number of completed items, and more. You’ll also have access 
to the top searches within a category — or the entire site — to see what 
buyers are searching for.
There’s much more available these days since eBay smartly partnered with 
Terapeak, a service I have used for ages. This company developed an eBay 
toolset that can really dig deep and do research for you. You’ll be amazed 
at the data you’ll see — especially once you’ve narrowed down the items 
you’re interested in selling to just a few. Too much research can cause your 
eyes to glaze over and make you see funny spots in front of your face. That 
doesn’t happen to you? OK, perhaps it’s just me.

Checking Out the Buzz on Yahoo!
The eBay site is the world’s host for popular culture. If it’s hot, people come 
to eBay to look for it. You should also look on the Internet to find the buzz. 
By buzz I mean the latest gossip, rumor, or thing that’s talked about at the 
water cooler at work. Something that’s the buzz can become a trend — and 
trends are those periodic waves of people buying the latest gotta-have items. 
They’re what you look for to follow into the world of eBay.
You can find the beginnings of buzz in any news report or on your Internet 
provider’s home page. Yahoo!, for example, has Yahoo!’s Buzz Index, at 
buzz.yahoo.com. It’s a compilation of items that have received the larg-
est number of searches on their system. You can see what’s new on the list,

Chapter 2: Buying Merchandise 
Like the Pros
In This Chapter
✓ Taking the mystery out of finding merchandise
✓ Getting the best wholesale deals
✓ Finding unusual (and cheap) deals
I
’m often asked, “Where do I find merchandise to sell on eBay?” This, 
of course, is followed by “What can I sell to make the most money on 
eBay?” Good questions. But what successful sellers have an answer they 
want to give to the competition?
When eBay PowerSellers have a good, solid source of merchandise, they’re 
not likely to share the name of that source with anyone — nor would any 
brick-and-mortar retailer. (Think about it for a minute.) When I was teach-
ing a class for advanced sellers at eBay Live (eBay’s user convention), I was 
asked the question in an auditorium-size room filled with PowerSellers. I 
answered a question with a question: Were there any PowerSellers in the 
audience who would like to share their sources with the rest of the group? 
You could have heard a pin drop. So I upped the ante — “I’ll pay anyone $10 
for one solid source” — still silence. Business is business.
The bottom line here is that all successful sellers tweak out their own 
sources. What works for one may not work for another. Methods for finding 
goods that I include in this chapter are gleaned from my own research, as 
well as from interviews with successful online retailers.
Tips for the Modest Investor
If you’re interested in making money in your eBay ventures but you’re start-
ing with limited cash, follow this list of eBay inventory dos and don’ts:
 
✦ Don’t spend more than you can afford to lose. If you shop at boutiques 
and expensive department stores, buy things that you like to wear your-
self (or give as gifts) in case they don’t sell.
 
✦ Do try to find something local that’s unavailable in a wider area. For 
example, if you live in an out-of-the-way place that has a local specialty, 
try selling that at eBay.

420
Buying for Retail: The Basic Course
 
✦ Don’t go overboard and buy something really cheap just because it’s 
cheap. Figure out who would want the item first.
 
✦ Do consider buying in bulk, especially if you know the item sells well on 
eBay or is inexpensive. Chances are good that if you buy one and it sells 
well on eBay, the item will be sold out by the time you try to buy more. If 
an item is inexpensive (say $.99), I always buy at least five. If no one bids 
on the item when you hold your auction, you’re only out $5. (Anyone out 
there need any Bicentennial commemorative coffee mugs?)
As an eBay seller, no doubt you’ll receive tons of spam (unsolicited e-mails) 
guaranteeing that the sender has the hottest-selling items for you to sell on 
eBay. Think about this for a second. If you had the hot ticket, wouldn’t you 
be selling it on eBay and making the fortune yourself? These people make 
money by preying on those who think there’s a magic way to make money 
on eBay. There isn’t. It takes old-fashioned elbow grease and research.
Buying for Retail: The Basic Course
If you’re not sure what you want to sell for profit at eBay — but you’re a 
shop-till-you-drop person by nature — incorporate your advanced shopping 
techniques into your daily routine. If you find a bargain that interests you, 
chances are you have a knack for spotting stuff that other shoppers would 
love to get their hands on.
When you’re new at eBay selling, you probably want to get your feet wet 
first, before shelling out large sums for wholesale merchandise. Some great 
deals are available in the open market for resale!
Joining the hunt for e-Bay inventory
Check your favorite eBay category and see what the hot-selling item is. 
Better yet, go to your favorite store and make friends with the manager. 
Store managers will often tell you what’s going to be the new hot item next 
month. After you’re armed with the information you need, search out that 
item for the lowest price you can, and then give it a shot on eBay.
Keep these shopping locales in mind when you go on the eBay hunt:
 
✦ Upscale department stores, trendy boutiques, outlet stores, or flagship 
designer stores are good places to do some market research. Check out 
the newest items and then head to the clearance area or outlet store and 
scrutinize the bargain racks for brand-name items.

✦ Discount club stores such as Sam’s Club and Costco made their mark 
by selling items in bulk to large families, clubs, and small businesses. In 
case you haven’t noticed, these stores have recently upscaled and sell 
just about anything you could want. And both Sam’s Club and Costco 
have Web sites: auctions.samsclub.com and www.costco.com.
It would be simple if you just bought merchan-
dise from a manufacturer. But that’s rarely the 
case. A full team of players participates in the 
wholesale game, and each player performs a 
different task, as follows:
 ✓ Manufacturers: Buying directly from a 
manufacturer may get you great prices, but 
it may not be the place for a beginner to 
start. Manufacturers usually require large 
minimum orders from retailers. Unless you 
have a group of other sellers (perhaps a 
friend who owns a retail store?) to split 
your order with, you may have to make 
your purchase from a middleman.
 
 An exception to the large-quantity require-
ment may be in the apparel industry. 
Because apparel has distinct, rapidly 
changing fashion seasons, a quick turn-
over in merchandise is a must. Apparel 
manufacturers may allow you to make 
small purchases towards the end of the 
season to outfit your eBay Store. It never 
hurts to ask.
 ✓ Wholesalers: Here’s your first step to 
finding your middleman. Wholesalers 
purchase direct from the manufacturer in 
large quantities. They sell the merchan-
dise to smaller retailers who can’t take 
advantage of the discounts from manufac-
turers for large orders.
 
 Find a wholesaler who is familiar with 
(or better yet, specializes in) the type of 
merchandise you want to sell. Obviously, 
someone who specializes in prerecorded 
DVDs and videos will not have a clue about 
the fashion market — and vice versa. 
 
 Don’t forget to check local wholesalers, 
as described in the “Finding merchandise 
locally” section.
 ✓ Manufacturer’s reps: These are gener-
ally the type of people you’ll meet at trade 
shows or marts. They represent one or 
many noncompeting manufacturers and 
selling their merchandise to retailers for a 
commission.
 ✓ Jobbers or brokers: These independent 
businesspeople buy merchandise any-
where they can at distressed prices. 
They deal mostly in liquidation or salvage 
merchandise. To find out more about this 
source, see Chapter 3.
Don’t forget to negotiate. Almost everything 
in the wholesale merchandise world is nego-
tiable. Although merchandise may have a set 
price, you may be able to get a discount if you 
offer to pay on delivery or within ten days. Ask 
whether they can help you out with shipping 
costs and perhaps promotions. They just may 
give you a discount if you promote their prod-
uct through banner ads. Ask, ask, ask. The 
worst they can say is no.
Figuring out who’s who in the industry

422
Buying for Retail: The Basic Course
 
 In another book, I talked about a special on the Costco Web site, www.
costco.com, for a new Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs DVD. For $18.49, 
you could pre-order the Snow White DVD and get a second Disney DVD 
for free. When there’s an offer like this, you can sell two items on eBay 
for the price of one. If I had followed my own advice — bought a case 
of this deal and held some for future sales — I’d be in the money today. 
It seems that Disney movies are released for a limited time only. That 
original DVD set now sells on eBay for around $40.
 
 If you were smart enough to get on the Costco site on the date of the 
Wii Fit game launch, you could have bought the item for its retail price 
of $89.99. Due to the rarity of the item, it’s price soared as high as $475 
on eBay. (Now, that’s a tidy profit.) They’re still selling steadily at $125. 
Even if you make $40 a sale, you’re in the money, so always be on top of 
what’s gonna sell big!
 
 When an item is new but has some collectability, I suggest you buy in 
bulk, sell some of the item to repay your investment, and save the bal-
ance for later. This has paid off for me a good many times with Disney 
films, Barbies, and Andy Warhol dinnerware.
 
✦ Dollar stores in your area. Many of the items these places carry are over-
runs (too many of something that didn’t sell), small runs (too little of 
something that the big guys weren’t interested in stocking), or out-of-date 
fad items that need a good home at eBay. I’ve found profitable books, 
Olympics memorabilia, and pop-culture items at this type of store.
 
 It’s not unusual for dollar-store warehouses to sell direct to a retailer 
(that’s you). Find out where the distribution warehouse is for your local 
dollar store chain and make contact. The 99¢ Only stores, for example, 
have a wholesale unit called Bargain Wholesale that runs out of their 
City of Commerce, California offices. They sell directly to retailers, dis-
tributors, and exporters.
 
✦ Thrift stores are packed with used — but usually good-quality — items. 
And you can feel good knowing that the money you spend in a nonprofit 
thrift shop is going to a good cause. Some branches of Goodwill and the 
Salvation Army receive merchandise from a central warehouse. Ask the 
manager (whom you’ve befriended) when the truck regularly comes in.
 
 Goodwill Industries is definitely gearing up for the 21st century. You can 
shop at its online auctions and get super values on the best of their mer-
chandise. Don’t forget to check the going prices on eBay before you buy. 
Have fun at www.shopgoodwill.com.
 
✦ Garage, tag, moving, and estate sales offer some of the biggest bargains 
you’ll ever come across. The stuff you find at estate sales is often of a 
higher quality. Keep an eye out for “moving to a smaller house” sales. 
These are usually people who have raised children, accumulated a 
houseful of stuff (collectibles? old toys? designer vintage clothes?), and 
want to shed it all so that they can move to a condo in Palm Springs.

Chapter 2
Buying 
Merchandise Like

Buying for Retail: The Basic Course
 
✦ Liquidation and estate auctions are two types of auctions where you 
can pick up bargains. Before you go to any auction, double-check pay-
ment terms and find out whether you must bring cash or can pay by 
credit card. Also, before you bid on anything, find out the hammer fee, 
or buyer’s premium. These fees are a percentage that auction houses add 
to the winner’s bid; the buyer has the responsibility for paying these 
fees.
 
 When a company gets into serious financial trouble, its debtors (the 
people to whom the company owes money) obtain a court order to liq-
uidate the company to pay the bills. The liquidated company then sells 
its stock, fixtures, and even real estate in a liquidation auction. Items 
sell for just cents on the dollar, and you can easily resell many of these 
items on eBay. Look in the phone book under Auctioneers: Liquidators 
and call local auctioneers’ offices to get on mailing lists.
 
 Estate auctions are the higher level of estate garage sales. Here you can 
find fine art, antiques, paper ephemera, rare books, and collectibles of 
all kinds. These auctions are attended mostly by dealers, who know the 
local going prices for the items they bid on. But because they’re buying 
to sell in a retail environment, their high bids will generally be the 
wholesale price for your area. And local dealers are buying what’s hot 
to resell in your city — not what’s going to sell across the country. That 
entire market will be yours.
 
✦ Newspaper auction listings are an excellent source of merchandise for 
resale, particularly the listings of liquidations and estate auctions (usu-
ally appear on Saturday) and the daily classified section, which often 
has ads that announce local business liquidations. Do not confuse any 
of these with garage sales or flea-market sales (run by individuals and 
a great source for one-of-a kind items). Liquidation and estate sales are 
professionally run, usually by licensed liquidators or auctioneers, and 
involve merchandise that may be new but is always sold in lots (in a 
quantity).
 
 If your local newspaper has a Web site, use its online search to view the 
classifieds for major liquidations, estate auctions, or other similar deals. 
Right there online, you can often find just what you are looking for 
locally. To find the paper’s Web site, run a search on Google like the one 
shown in Figure 2-1.
 
✦ Going-out-of-business sales, some of which run week by week, with 
bigger discounts as time goes by. Don’t be shy about making an offer on 
a quantity of items.
 
 Going-out-of-business sales can be a bonanza, but be careful and don’t 
be misled. Many states require businesses that are putting on a going-
out-of business sale to purchase a special license that identifies the busi-
ness as really going out of business. Some store ads may read “Going 
Out for Business” or some similar play on words, so you need to be sure 
that you’re going to the real thing.

✦ Flea markets or swap meets in your area may have some bargains you 
can take advantage of.
 
✦ Gift shops at museums, monuments, national parks, and theme parks 
can provide eBay inventory — but think about where to sell the items. 
Part of your selling success on eBay is access. People who can’t get to 
Graceland may pay handsomely for an Elvis mini-guitar with the official 
logo on the box.
 
✦ Freebies are usually samples or promotion pieces that companies 
give away to introduce a new product, service, or, best of all, a media 
event. Hang on to these! If you receive handouts (lapel pins, pencils, 
pamphlets, books, interesting napkins, flashlights, towels, stuffed toys) 
from a sporting event, premiere, or historic event — or even a collect-
ible freebie from a fast-food restaurant — they could be your ticket to 
some eBay sales. For example, when Return of the Jedi was re-released in 
1997, the first 100 people to enter each theater got a Special Edition Luke 
Skywalker figure. These figures are still highly prized by collectors and 
when the next part of the Star Wars saga was released, the prices on this 
figure went up yet again.
 
 When you go to the cosmetic counter and buy a way-too-expensive item, 
ask for tester-sized samples. Name brand cosmetic and perfume samples 
of high-priced items sell well on eBay. Also, look for gift with purchase 
deals. If it’s a specialty item, you can usually sell it on its own to some-
one who’d like to try a sample, rather than plunge headlong into a large 
purchase. Less-special items can be grouped together as lots. Be sure to 
put the brand names in the title.

One of my mottoes is “Buy off-season, sell on-season.” You can get great bar-
gains on winter merchandise in the heat of summer. January’s a great time 
to stock up on Christmas decorations, and the value of those trendy vintage 
aluminum trees doubles in November and December. Cashmere sweaters, 
too! In the winter, you can get great deals on closeout summer sports mer-
chandise. It’s all in the timing.
Looking for resale items on eBay
Another place to find items to sell is on eBay itself. Look only for good-
quality merchandise to resell. Remember that the only way to make a living 
on eBay is to sell quality items to happy customers so that they’ll come back 
and buy from you again.
Be sure to search eBay auction titles for the following keywords: resale, 
resell, “case of” (see Figure 2-2), “case quantity”, “lot of”, “pallet of”, closeout, 
and surplus. Use the quotation marks anywhere I’ve included them here 
because this forces the search engine to find the words in the exact order.

Buying Wholesale
Also be sure you check out the wholesale categories on eBay. After noticing 
how many sellers were buying from other sellers, eBay set up wholesale sub-
categories for almost every type of item. You can find the wholesale items in 
the category list on the left side of the page after performing a search, or just 
go to the eBay home page, scroll down the list of categories, and select your 
favorite category to sell. You’ll be brought to the Category hub page; scroll 
down to find the links to Wholesale Lots, as shown in Figure 2-3. Then click 
the category of your choice to find some great deals.

Buying Wholesale
After you get the hang of finding items in stores to resell on eBay, it’s time 
to move to the wholesale source. As a side note, I want you to know that 
although my eBay business is based on wholesale merchandise, I still love 
going to the sources mentioned in the last section and finding great deals to 
resell. It’s become a fun hobby! Don’t we all love to find a piece of merchan-
dise that we know we can sell for a profit?
One of my editors is going to kill me for men-
tioning one of her favorite eBay merchandise 
sources, but here it is: Tuesday Morning, which 
has more than 500 stores scattered over the 
United States. They sell first-quality designer 
and brand-name closeout merchandise at 
deep, deep discounts — 50% to 80% below 
retail. The key here is that the store sells rec-
ognizable brand names, the kind of items that 
eBay shoppers look for. I’ve seem items at 
their store from Samsonite, Thomas Kinkade, 
Limoges, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Madame 
Alexander, and even Barbie! Find your local 
store at their Web site, www.tuesday

sures newsletter, you get advance notice of 
when the really good stuff arrives at the store.

Okay, you want to set up shop on eBay. You kind of know what type of mer-
chandise you want to sell, but you don’t know where to turn. Anyone in the 
brick-and-mortar world who plans to open a new store faces the same quan-
dary: finding merchandise that will sell quickly at a profit.
Merchandise that sits around doesn’t give you cash flow, which is the name 
of the game in any business. (Cash flow = profit = money to buy better, or 
more, merchandise.) I spoke to several successful retailers and they all gave 
me the same answers about where they began their quest. The upcoming 
sections give you a look at the answers these retailers shared.
Setting up to buy
Purchasing wholesale merchandise may require that you have your state’s 
resale license, which identifies you as being in the business. Be sure that you 
have one before you try to purchase merchandise directly from another busi-
ness. Also, when you have a resale number and purchase merchandise from 
another business — known as a business-to-business (B2B) transaction — you 
probably won’t be charged sales tax when you purchase your stock because 
you’ll be paying sales tax when you sell the items. Go to Book IX, Chapter 1 to 
find out how to get that magic resale number.
When you have your resale number, you can go anywhere you want to 
buy merchandise. If you want to buy direct from a manufacturer, you can. 
Unfortunately, many manufacturers have a minimum order amount, which 
may be more than you want to spend (and you’d get more of a particular 
item than you’d ever want at once). To remedy that, see whether you can 
find independent retailers who buy in quantity — and who will (perhaps) 
let you in on some quantity buys with manufacturers. I often buy in with a 
couple of local shops when they purchase their orders.
 
To gain access to legitimate wholesale sources, you must be a licensed 
business in your city or county. You also usually have to have a resale 
permit and tax ID number from your state. (See Book IX, Chapter 1 for details.)
Finding merchandise locally
Always remember that the cost of shipping the merchandise to you adds a 
great deal of expense. The higher your expense, the lower your return may 
be. The more you buy locally to resell, the more profit you can make.
The first place most potential retailers go is to their local wholesale district. 
You can find yours in your yellow pages (remember that giant brick of a 
book they drop in your driveway once a year?) under the name of your item. 
For example, suppose you want to sell women’s apparel. Look up Women’s 
Apparel in the yellow pages and find the Wholesale subcategory. Bingo! 
Immediate merchandise sources, within driving distance of your home! Also

be sure to check the directories in neighboring communities as well. The 
value of this printed (and usually overlooked) resource is immeasurable 
when you’re starting up a business.
Regional merchandise marts
Your next stop — should you be lucky enough to live in a major metropoli-
tan area — is to find out whether there’s a merchandise or fashion mart near 
you. These are giant complexes that hold as many as several thousand lines 
of merchandise in one area.
Merchandise marts are hubs for wholesale buyers, distributors, manufactur-
ers, and independent sales representatives. They have showrooms within 
the property for manufacturers or their representatives to display their cur-
rent merchandise. Under one roof, you may find both fashion and gift mer-
chandise for your eBay business.
See Table 2-1 for a representative sprinkling of the many marts across the 
country. This is not a comprehensive list, just one to get your mind moving. 
You can contact the individual marts for tenant lists and more information. If 
you’re a legitimate business, the marts will be more than happy to teach you 
the ropes and get you started.

Buying Wholesale
My favorite, the California Market Center (whose Web site is shown in Figure 
2-4), even has a special program for new buyers, offering tons of useful infor-
mation to help newbies get going.

When you go to each mart’s Web site, you’ll find hundreds of links to whole-
sale sources. Many marts also send you a directory of the manufacturers 
represented in the mart.
Wholesale trade shows
By checking out the links to the marts listed in Table 2-1, you’ll also end up 
with links to the thousands of wholesale trade shows that go on across the 
country each year. Trade shows are commonly held in convention centers, 
hotels, and local merchandise marts.
A super source for finding gift shows is the greatrep.com Web site, shown 
in Figure 2-5. Here you find a list of all the major gift shows — with clickable 
links to contact information for the show coordinators. For more on great
rep.com, see the “Buying Online for Resale” section later in this section.
 
When visiting a show or a mart, view all merchandise before you place an 
order. Bring a notebook with you to make copious notes of items you find 
interesting and where you find them.

Professional trade shows and marts are not 
open to the general public, and they want 
to keep it that way. When you attend these 
venues, they want to be sure that you repre-
sent a business. Following is a list of items that 
you may be asked to provide, as proof that you 
are a retailer:
 ✓ Business cards
 ✓ A copy of your current resale-tax 
certificate or state tax permit
 ✓ Current occupational or business tax 
license
 ✓ Proof of a business checking account or 
a letter of credit from your bank (if you’re 
applying for credit)
 ✓ Financial statement
 ✓ Cash and checks
Be sure to check with the organization spon-
soring the trade show or mart before attending 
so that you’ll have everything you need. Don’t 
let this list scare you — wholesale marts are 
fun, and the organizers and vendors will do 
everything they can to help you make your 
retailing venture a success!

These trade shows are gargantuan bourses of hundreds of wholesale ven-
dors all lined up and ready to take your orders. The vendors have samples of 
the merchandise in the lines they carry and are delighted to answer all your 
questions about their products, credit applications, and minimum orders. 
These shows are designed to move products to retailers like you!
Few trade shows are more exciting than the Consumer Electronics Show 
(CES), sponsored by the Consumer Electronics Association. If you buy break-
through technologies to sell online, this show is a must! You’ll find the latest 
in everything high-tech, including digital imaging, electronic gaming, home 
electronics, car audio, home theater, and satellite systems. You’ll see what’s 
new — but more importantly, you’ll see what will be passé in a hurry — 
great merchandise to sell (in a timely way, of course) on eBay!
CES draws more than 100,000 buyers each year, and the vendors are there to 
sell their goods to you. Visit the CES Web site at www.cesweb.org to get an 
idea of the excitement that the show generates.
 
See whether the item is selling on eBay before you make your purchase. 
Bring a laptop and conduct research either on the spot or later in the day for 
next-day purchases. Getting a good deal is one thing — selling it on eBay is 
another.
Buying Online for Resale
I’ve come across many legitimate sources of goods on the Internet. But the 
Internet is loaded with scam artists; it’s up to you to check vendors out for 
yourself before spending your hard-earned money. Even if I mention sell-
ers here, I want you to check them out as if you know nothing about them. 
I can’t guarantee a thing; all I know is that at the time of this writing, they 
were reliable sources for eBay merchandise.
Kijiji and Craigslist
If you haven’t visited either of these site, you’re missing quite a bit! Both 
sites feature free local classifieds. You’ll find anything and everything listed 
here, and you never know when there will be something worthwhile to 
resell. These sites are always worth at least a once-a-week visit. Much of the 
stuff on these two sites is listed by people who are either too lazy or too 
afraid to sell on eBay.
Craigslist has been well known to the Internet cognoscenti for years, and 
Kijiji (shown in Figure 2-6) is eBay’s new offering in the “free classifieds” 
arena. You can find the sites at
www.kijiji.com
www.craigslist.org

B2B wholesale clearinghouses
Legitimate online sites for retailers are rare. Many of the business to business 
(B2B) merchants and wholesale directories reflect nothing but flea market 
goods and highly marked-up drop-shipping items. Don’t be disappointed! That 
Because the online world can be fraught with 
problems, keep in mind the following:
 ✓ Protect your e-mail address. Check every 
site you sign up with for a privacy policy. 
Watch out for wording like this in the 
Privacy Policy: ‘’Our Privacy Policy does 
not extend to our affiliated sellers or adver-
tisers. They are free to maintain their own 
privacy policy independent of us.’’ Again, 
get an anonymous e-mail address to spare 
yourself spam.
 ✓ Look for the About Us page. Be sure the 
site has an address and a phone number. 
Call the number to see whether it is a “real” 
business, not a fly-by-night. While you’re at 
it, see how you’re treated on the phone.
 ✓ Look for safety seals. Seeing the Better 
Business Bureau Online, TrustE, or 
SquareTrade logo on the Web site can bol-
ster trust in the company.
 ✓ Check out the shipping costs. Sometimes 
the shipping can cost more than the item. 
Before placing your order, make sure you 
know all the shipping costs and terms.
You must have a Federal tax ID number (that’s 
your identification to do business) to even 
register on most legitimate wholesale sites. 
Finding wholesale Web sites with this restric-
tion is a good thing. It’s another way to verify 
that you’re dealing with a true wholesale sup-
plier.
Tips for buying wholesale online

434
Buying Online for Resale
doesn’t mean you can’t find a deal on some great merchandise. The benefit of 
the Internet is that you have access to many sources. The challenge is to find 
the good, solid, reliable sources of information, like the following:
 
✦ MadeInUSA.com: One of the best ways to find an item to sell is to find 
that item in your everyday life. If you have the manufacturer’s name but 
no contact information, go to the MadeInUSA Web site (see Figure 2-7), 
which has a huge database of manufacturer contact info.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Search 
more than 
400,000 
manu-
facturers 
at this Web 
site.
 
 
✦ Greatrep.com: Here’s a Web site directory where buyers (that’s you) 
can hook up with manufacturer’s representatives that carry lines of 
merchandise in the wholesale giftware, home furnishings, and furniture 
industries. It’s fantastic! After you register (and provide your state resale 
license), you have access to their listings of thousands of manufactur-
ers. In the listings you may find out how much they require for a mini-
mum order and you can request a catalog.
Buying directly from online wholesalers 
Following are a few sources that have some unusual merchandise. I’ve 
bought from almost all of them.
Liquidation.com
If you like auctions (and I know you do) check out Liquidation.com. This 
is a massive all-auction Web site that has incredible deals on all types of 
merchandise, as shown in Figure 2-8.

435

Figure 2-8: 
The 
Liquidation.
com Web 
site.
 
One of the things that I love about this site is that most individual auctions 
provide a link to the manifest — a list of every piece of merchandise in the 
lot. If you click the View Manifest link at the top of the auction page, you see 
a piece-by-piece list of the items included in the lot you’re bidding on.
It’s best to buy from vendors closer to your geographic area because 
after you add the shipping fee, you might be paying too much for your lot. 
Liquidation.com has a shipping calculator to help you know ahead of time 
how much your shipping may be.
Oriental Trading Company
The Oriental Trading Company has been in business for a long time. I used 
to buy from their catalog for school and charity affairs. This site offers every-
thing from crafts to costumes to party goods — and all priced perfectly for 
resale on eBay. Use your practiced eye (and completed search) to ferret out 
the unique items that will sell. Visit them at www.orientaltrading.com.

Big Lots Wholesale
If you’re familiar with the Big Lots stores scattered around the country, you 
have an idea of what you can buy at biglotswholesale.com. A quick 
click to their Web site showed me that they were loaded with great deals on 
everything from health and beauty items to toys to lawn and garden tools. A 
seller’s tax ID number is required to get pricing on this site.

C
onsignment sales are the up-and-coming way for you to help non-techie 
types by selling their items on eBay. Lots of sellers do it, and several 
retail locations base their business on it. You take property of the item from 
the owner and sell it on eBay. You’re responsible for taking photos and mar-
keting the auction on eBay — for a fee. In addition to the money you earn 
selling on consignment, you also get excellent experience for future auctions 
of your own merchandise.
Getting Organized to Sell for Others
To set up your business for consignment sales, you should follow a few 
guidelines:
 
1. Design a consignment agreement (a contract), and send it to the owners 
of the merchandise before they send you their items. Doing so ensures 
that all policies are set up in advance and that no questions will arise 
after the transaction has begun.
 
2. Have the owners sign and give the agreement to you (the consignor) 
along with the item.
 
3. Research the item based on past sales so you can give the owners an 
estimated range of what the item might sell for on eBay.
 
4. Photograph the item carefully (see Book V for some hints) and write a 
thoughtful, selling description.
 
5. Handle all e-mail inquiries as though the item were your own; after all, 
your fee is generally based on a percentage of the final sale.
Traditional auction houses handle consignment sales in a similar fashion.

438
Compete with the Trading Posts
Compete with the Trading Posts
Several chains have opened up across the country with retail locations 
accepting merchandise from the general public. By becoming an official 
Trading Assistant, you can compete with the big boys in your own area.
The best part is that if you’re running your eBay business out of your home, 
from a garage, or from a low-rent industrial office, you’re a step ahead of 
the big guys who have to pay high rents in fancy neighborhoods to get their 
drop-in business. They also have to hire people who are familiar with run-
ning auctions on eBay — and aren’t you already set up for that?
Don’t worry about the competition! You may hear about the many brick-
and-mortar eBay consignment stores that are opening up. (As a matter of 
fact, one company is selling franchises for this business for up to $15,000!) 
You already know how to sell on eBay, why would you need a franchise? Use 
your good sense (and positive feedback) to build your own eBay consign-
ment store.
Following are some of the chains that sell goods on eBay for consumers:
 
✦ AuctionDrop, www.auctiondrop.com
 
✦ iSold It, www.i-soldit.com
 
✦ Instant Auctions, www.InstantAuctions.net
 
✦ eSavz.com, www.eSavz.com 
Retail locations have a much higher cost of business than you do. They 
need to be open for set hours a day and have several employees on duty 
at all times. Many of these stores won’t accept an item worth less than $75. 
There’s still a lot of profit left for you in the realm of under-$75 items.
Table 3-1 shows the fees charged by various consignment chain stores, as of 
this writing.

In addition to the fees shown in Table 3-1, these chain stores also charge for 
all eBay and PayPal fees (of course). There’s also a $5.00 minimum commis-
sion per item. Check out these sites regularly so you can keep up with the 
competition in your own area.
What do you charge for all your work? I can’t give you a stock answer for 
that one. Many sellers charge a flat fee for photographing, listing, and ship-
ping that ranges from $5 to $10 plus as much as a 30 percent commission 
on the final auction total (to absorb eBay fees). Other sellers base their fees 
solely on the final sale amount and charge on a sliding scale, beginning at 
50 percent of the total sale, less eBay and payment-service fees. You must 
decide how much you think you can make on an item.
Table 3-2 gives you some ideas based on the input I’ve received from some 
successful eBay consignment sellers. (These percentages may be in addition 
to the listing fee and gallery charges.)

to see what they charge.
Becoming an eBay Trading Assistant
What is an eBay Trading Assistant? Simply put, an eBay Trading Assistant 
sells merchandise for people on eBay. A more complex definition is that a 
Trading Assistant sells items on consignment for those who are not familiar 
with the eBay site or simply don’t want to bother to learn the ropes.
The first thing to take into consideration before becoming a Trading 
Assistant is to be sure you are familiar with the eBay site and its rules and 
regulations and — most of all — are experienced in selling items at a profit. 
To be a successful Trading Assistant, you need to know how to research 
items on eBay and how to parlay keywords into winning auction titles.

440
Becoming an eBay Trading Assistant
The Trading Assistants hub appears on the eBay site at
www.eBay.com/tahub
To find a Trading Assistant in your area, click the link on the hub page and 
you’ll be taken to a search page (see Figure 3-1). Potential customers can 
search for a Trading Assistant to sell their items by city and state, postal ZIP 
code, eBay ID, or name.
 
Figure 3-1: 
The Find 
a Trading 
Assistant 
page.
 
This page is promoted on the eBay site to new users and in eBay promo-
tions. Being listed on this page will help your customers find you.
eBay makes it very clear that whether you fulfill the requirements for 
Trading Assistant or not, being a Trading Assistant is a privilege. If eBay 
receives complaints about your services, they have the right to remove you 
from the Trading Assistant directory. Following are eBay’s requirements:
 
✦ Listings: You must have sold at least ten items in the last three months.
 
✦ Feedback rating: You must maintain a minimum rating of 100 or higher, 
with a minimum of 98-percent positive comments.
 
✦ Activity: You must have continued to sell (at least ten items in the previ-
ous three months).

✦ Follow Terms. eBay offers a style guide that outlines the use of the 
eBay brand. eBay takes the use of its name and graphics seriously, so if 
you intend to become a Trading Assistant, you must hold them in high 
honor. You can see the details at
ebaytradingassistant.com/index.php?page=userAgreements&type=
taSG
 
You may notice on the directory-search screen that there’s an option to 
search for buySAFE bonded sellers. This is a real selling point when it comes 
to doing business with strangers. A seller who’s bonded is basically backed 
by insurance. (See Book VIII Chapter 2 for more on joining buySAFE.) Note 
that in Figure 3-2, buySAFE bonded sellers are listed first (here, in a search of 
Los Angeles, California).

As a Trading Assistant, you acquire merchandise and sell it on eBay on con-
signment. You are also responsible for the following:
 
✦ Consulting with consignors about their items.
 
✦ Researching the value of the item. Many non-eBay users may have 
unreasonable expectations of the price their items will sell for. It’s your 
duty to check this out beforehand and explain the realities to them.
 
✦ Coordinating the listing. Take digital photos and write a complete and 
accurate description of the item.
 
✦ Keeping a close accounting of fees and money collection.

442
Becoming an eBay Trading Assistant
That’s not much in the way of requirements, so get ready to become a TA.
 
Becoming a Trading Assistant does not make you an employee, agent, or 
independent contractor of eBay. Make sure you refer to yourself as an 
independent business.
When you sign up as a Trading Assistant, you have to fill out a form describ-
ing your business to prospective customers. Think through the things you 
want to say before posting them. Your information here works like an ad for 
you. Following are the items to put on your Trading Assistant listing page:
 
✦ Personal information: This includes your eBay user ID, your real name 
and address, and the languages spoken. Your personal information 
appears in the listing, such as the one from a professional Trading 
Assistant, borntodeal, shown in Figure 3-3.
 
Figure 3-3:

Assistant 
Contact 
Information 
box.
 
 
✦ Category specialty: If you specialize in a particular category, be sure to 
mention it. You may indicate eBay home page categories.
 
✦ Service description: In this area you can say as little or as much as 
you like about your eBay experience and the services you provide. 
Remember that the more you communicate in advance, the more suc-
cessful you’ll be.
 
 Here is a sample service description (also look at the Specialties and 
Services in Figure 3-4):
 
 I’ve been active on the site since 1996 and am an eBay PowerSeller. I 
specialize in selling all types of eBay items and am particularly famil-
iar with the fashion category. I can handle large numbers of listings. 
Please contact me so that we can discuss your particular needs and 
time availability.
 
 I can visit your home within 15 miles from my place of business to 
inventory the items. I will list, ship, and provide you with an itemized 
list of all items sold with the sale price and my fees.

✦ Policy description: Ensure that consignees understand your policies. A 
sample description follows:
 
 I will list your items for two listing cycles, spread up to 30 days. If 
items do not sell, they will be returned to you. Items must be in my 
possession to be submitted to eBay unless contractual arrangements 
are made in advance. I handle all correspondence and shipping. A 
consignment contract is required. I also do independent consulting 
specializing in Internet auctions and their application to your 
business.
 
✦ Fee description: This is where you need to do some research. Search 
your ZIP code on the Trading Assistants Directory page and see what 
other fees are being charged in your area. After you have an idea of what 
you want to charge, you can put that information here.
Take a look at the descriptions for the Trading Assistant shown in Figure 
3-5. There’s no question about how this seller handles his business once you 
read this text. See if you can come up with text that will sell your services 
without being overbearing.
 
You can provide incentives for higher-value items by charging lower com-
missions (such as “40 percent if the item sells for less than $50, but 30 per-
cent if the item sells for more”). Also, charging a higher percentage and 
including fees allows an easier fee discussion with the client (for example, 
“40 percent and all fees included versus 30 percent and you pay all the fees, 
which include . . .”).

444
Promoting Your Business
 
Figure 3-5:

Many Trading Assistants also quote transaction fees for listing with a 
reserve (knowing it probably won’t sell because the consignor doesn’t have 
a fair guess at the market valuation).
When you’ve decided everything you need to list, click the Trading Assistant 
Requirements and Sign-up link on the Trading Assistant home page (men-
tioned at the beginning of this chapter). Fill out the forms and, just like 
magic, you’ve become a Trading Assistant!
Promoting Your Business
When I was working in the newspaper advertising business, we had a saying 
about someone who opened a new store: If all the advertising they do is 
their Grand Opening ad and nothing after, it won’t be long before you’ll be 
seeing the Going-Out-of-Business sale ad. The same is true with your Trading 
Assistant business.
Adding the Trading Assistant logo to your listings
Your best customers may come from people who see your existing items 
when browsing eBay. Why not show all viewers that you’re a Trading 
Assistant by including the Trading Assistant logo in your listings. When pro-
spective customers click the link, as shown in Figure 3-6, they’ll be sent to 
your Trading Assistant Information page (just as if they searched for you in 
the directory).

Promoting Your Business
 
Add the Trading Assistant logo when your regular eBay business is slow, and 
take it out when you’re overly busy. That way, you can control the amount 
of work you have.
To add the link to your listings, you have to use a little HTML. Don’t panic. 
It’s easy. You can easily download the code from the Trading Assistant’s 
secure area, or just use the following code. Add this HTML code at the end 
of your listing description, replacing marsha_c with your eBay User ID:
<p align=”center”><img src=”http://pics.ebaystatic.com/aw/pics/logos/logoUS_R_
TA_RGB_141x106.jpg” alt=”I am a Trading Assistant on eBay” width=”141” 
height=”106” border=”0” longdesc=”TA Logo” /></a></p>
<p align=”center” class=”style3”><a href=”http://ebaytradingassistant.com/
directory/index.php?page=profile&ebayID=
marsha_c” target=”_blank”>I am a Trading Assistant - I can sell your stuff 
on eBay!</a></p>
That’s all. Now the link and button shown in Figure 3-6 appear in your eBay 
listings.
Posting flyers
Why not design a flyer that you print on your own printer. Put it up at the 
supermarket, the car wash, the cleaner — anywhere and everywhere flyers 
are allowed.
Even if you don’t see flyers in a retail location, ask the owner of the business 
if you can put one up — maybe even offer a discount to the business owner 
for selling their items on eBay in exchange!
To get to the eBay Trading Assistant logos and Toolkit, sign into your eBay 
Trading Assistant account and go to
ebaytradingassistant.com/tahome/index.php?page=resource
On this page, you can find the current graphical offerings from eBay.
You might want to make a flyer like the one shown in Figure 3-7, and include 
small tear-off strips where you can place your contact information. When 
people see your promotion, they can just snip off your phone number (or 
e-mail address) and contact you when they get home.

Handling Your Business Professionally
How you conduct your business can demonstrate to your customers that 
you’re a responsible person. You need to present a professional appearance 
when you meet your client, and you should have a professional attitude in 
your dealings.
Being professional also means anticipating possible problems. In addition 
to being very clear about financial issues with your clients (especially fees 
and the realistic selling value of your clients’ merchandise), you may want to 
consider getting additional insurance to cover the merchandise you’re hold-
ing in your home.
You may also want to consider designing a few forms to reinforce your 
clients’ awareness that this is your business and that you know it well. For 
example:

Book IV
Chapter 3

People’s Stuff

Handling Your Business Professionally
 
✦ Inventory form: This form lists the entire inventory you receive from the 
client and should include as detailed a description of the item as your 
client can supply. Also, include the minimum amount (if any) the client 
will accept for the item — this will be your reserve price if necessary.
 
✦ Sales agreement: Professional Trading Assistants have their clients sign 
a sales contract. Read on for some good suggestions about what to put 
in your contract. You may want to have a lawyer look at your contract 
before you use it.
The following information was graciously supplied by eBay’s successful 
Trading Assistants, Kate and Phil Bowyer. It includes quotes from their own 
Trading Assistant contract that cover many things you might overlook when 
you put together your own contract. This, of course, is not a full agreement, 
but it provides some of the salient points.
Be sure to include an explanation of the consignment process:
 
✦ The Consignor will bring item(s) to the Seller, who, upon both parties 
signing this contract, will take possession of the items for the duration 
of the auction.
 
✦ Acceptance of any item consigned will be at the Seller’s sole discretion.
 
✦ The Seller will inspect the item(s) for quality and clean if necessary (a 
fee may apply).
 
✦ The Seller will take quality photographs and write an accurate descrip-
tion of item(s).
 
✦ The Seller will research eBay for similar items to assure proper pricing.
 
✦ The Seller will start the auction(s) and handle all aspects of the sale 
including correspondence with bidders.
 
✦ The Seller will collect payment from the winning bidder (“Buyer”) at the 
end of the auction and will ship the item(s) in a timely manner, once 
funds have cleared.
 
✦ The Seller will follow up the sale by contacting the Buyer to make sure 
the Buyer is satisfied with the transaction.
 
✦ Once the Seller and Buyer are satisfied with the transaction, payment 
will be made to the Consignor.
 
✦ The Seller will keep the Consignor aware of the auction progress by tele-
phone or e-mail and by supplying the Consignor the auction number(s) 
to track the item(s) themselves.
 
✦ The Seller will return unsold item(s) to the Consignor upon payment of 
outstanding fees.

448
Handling Your Business Professionally
It’s also a good idea to provide the consignor with a statement of items sold, 
summarizing the total purchase price, all fees, and the amount the consignor 
receives.
 
✦ Outline your fees: “The Consignor will be billed the actual rates and 
fees as incurred for all services, to include the Seller’s 00% Commission. 
Any services or upgrades requested by the Consignor will carry the 
exact fee and will be deducted from payment, or after three (3) failed 
auction listings, will be due to the Seller payable in cash. If the auc-
tion sells, these fees will be subtracted from the winning bid before the 
Consignor receives payment.”
 
 Be sure to include a copy of current eBay fees: listing, options, reserves, 
PayPal, and final value fees.
 
✦ Outline the terms of your commission: “The Seller’s commission for 
this service is a percentage based on the auction’s winning bid. If the 
auction does not sell, the Consignor is only responsible to pay the appli-
cable insertion and reserve price auction fees. An Unsold Reserve fee 
of $0.00 [fill in your amount] will be due to The Seller for a reserve price 
auction that does not sell.”
 
✦ Be sure you don’t guarantee the item will sell. “If an item does not 
sell, the Seller will re-list it two additional times. The Seller may contact 
the Consignor to discuss combining individual items into lots to attract 
buyers. The Consignor’s verbal consent, or e-mail consent, will be docu-
mented in the Consignor’s file and will serve as a revision to this con-
tract. After a third unsuccessful listing, the Consignor will be billed for 
the fees associated with all three auctions, plus a $5.00 surcharge. Items 
will be returned to the Consignor upon payment of those fees. Items not 
claimed within 14 days from the end of the final listing will become the 
property of the Seller.”
 
✦ Protect yourself and your eBay reputation: “The Consignor of 
said item(s) consents to the sale of said item(s) based on the terms 
described in this agreement. The Consignor also attests that said item(s) 
are fully owned by the Consignor and are not stolen, borrowed, misrep-
resented, bogus, etc.”
 
 You might also mention that you will only sell the item if eBay policies 
allow the item to be sold.
 
 “The Seller will do everything possible to secure the safety of the 
Consignor’s item(s), however, the Seller is not responsible for any 
damage to the item, including fire, theft, flood, accidental damage or 
breakage, and acts of God. The Consignor releases the Seller of any such 
responsibility for any unforeseen or accidental damage.”
 
 I choose to protect myself additionally, because reputation on eBay is 
paramount. I have a small business rider on my homeowner’s insurance 
that covers merchandise in my home up to $5,000. It’s an inexpensive 
addition to your policy — definitely worth looking into.

Book IV
Chapter 3

People’s Stuff
449
Handling Your Business Professionally
 
✦ Ending a sale prematurely: “If such an instance arises that the 
Consignor demands the item(s) to be pulled, the Consignor will pay a 
cancellation fee of $75. Items will not be surrendered to the Consignor 
until this fee is paid in cash.”
 
✦ Protect yourself from possible shill bidding: An important line you 
should add protects you from possible shill bidding. How about: “The 
Consignor also agrees not to place a bid on an auction that the Seller has 
listed for the Consignor (hereafter “Shill Bid”) on eBay, nor to arrange 
for a Shill Bid to be made on the behalf of the Consignor by a third party. 
If the Consignor or an agent of the Consignor submits a Shill Bid on an 
auction listed by the Seller, the Consignor agrees to pay all fees, com-
missions, and penalties associated with that auction, plus a $75.00 fine, 
and the Seller may refuse to grant auction services to the Consignor in 
the future.”
Again, I strongly suggest that you get professional advice before putting 
together your own contract or agreement.

and Drop-Shipping
In This Chapter

✓ Practicing safe shopping
✓ Drop-shipping without drop-kicking your customers
Y
ou’re likely to find various levels of quality when you look for 
merchandise to resell on eBay. Receiving a box of ripped or stained 
goods when you expected first-quality merchandise can be disheartening. 
If you take the time to evaluate the condition of the merchandise you’re 
interested in buying, you save time (and money) in the long run. But to 
make that evaluation, you need to know what the industry language tells 
you about the quality of the merchandise. 
In addition to qualifying the goods you buy, take the time to qualify the 
processes and partners you use. For example, drop-shipping (shipping goods 
straight from the stockpile to the consumer) has become a popular method 
for moving merchandise sold on eBay, but it comes with many caveats. For 
example, eBay has a policy about preselling items, so be sure to check it 
out — and make sure your drop-shipper has the merchandise ready to go 
when you place your order. Use this chapter to become a savvy buyer of 
goods to resell and an effective mover of those same goods. 
Know the Lingo of Merchandisers
To help ensure that industry jargon won’t trip you up, this section describes 
the lingo you need to know and offers pointers on making the right deci-
sions about your merchandise and methods. Here are some terms you’re 
likely to come across:

452
Know the Lingo of Merchandisers
 
✦ Job lots: A job lot simply refers to a bunch of merchandise sold at once. 
The goods may consist of unusual sizes, odd colors, or even some hid-
eous stuff that won’t blow out of your eBay store if a hurricane comes 
in. Some of the merchandise (usually no more than 15 percent) may be 
damaged. Super discounts can be had on job lots — and if the lot con-
tains brand names from major stores, you may be able to make an excel-
lent profit.
 
 A good way to find a jobber (someone who wants to sell you job lots) on 
the Internet is to run a Google search on wholesale jobber. Another 
great place to find a jobber is in the phone book or industry newsletter 
classifieds.
 
✦ Off-price lots: If you can get hold of top-quality, brand-name items in off-
price lots, you can do very well on eBay. These items are end-of-season 
overruns (more items were made than could be sold through normal 
retailers). You can generally find this merchandise toward the end of the 
buying season.
 
 Many eBay sellers, without having the thousands of dollars to buy mer-
chandise, make friends with the salespeople at manufacturers’ outlet 
stores (where the merchandise may land first). Others haunt places like 
TJ Maxx, Marshall’s, and Burlington Coat Factory for first-rate deals.
 
 Search the classified ads of genuine trade publications for items to buy 
in bulk. Publications such as California Apparel News have classifieds 
that are accessible online. Visit its Web site at www.apparelnews.net 
and click Classifieds (see Figure 4-1). Subscribing to the online publica-
tion will no doubt get you quicker access to the choice sample and mer-
chandise sales.

✦ Liquidations: All eBay sellers think of liquidations as the mother lode of 
deals. And, yes, they may be the mother lode of deals if you can afford to 
buy and store an entire 18-wheeler truckload of merchandise. That takes 
a great deal of money and a great deal of square footage, plus the staff to 
go through each and every item.
You can find great deals on refurbished elec-
tronic merchandise on eBay. Unfortunately, 
refurbished merchandise gets an unneces-
sarily bad rap. Very smart people may tell you 
to be wary of refurbished merchandise. Great 
advice . . . I guess. I tell people to be wary of all 
merchandise. 
The way I figure it, refurbished merchandise 
has been gone over by the manufacturer 
twice — new merchandise has been gone over 
only once! I buy refurbished merchandise all 
the time. Let me explain what refurbished mer-
chandise is and why it can be such a bargain. 
Refurbished merchandise can fall into one of 
these categories:
 ✓ Canceled orders: This is merchandise in 
perfectly good shape. Say a customer 
makes a special order and then changes 
his or her mind, or the order is somehow 
mucked up (“I ordered a PC. You sent me 
a Mac!”). Something has to be done with 
the merchandise. Enter you, the savvy 
shopper.
 ✓ Evaluation units: An evaluation unit is 
a piece of equipment that is sent to a 
member of the media or to a corporation 
for testing or review. Evaluation units must 
be returned to the manufacturer, and the 
manufacturer may decide to unload them.
 ✓ Store returns: This is probably pretty obvi-
ous to you, right? Joe Customer buys some-
thing in a store, takes it home and opens it, 
only to decide that he doesn’t really want 
it. By law, as soon as the box is opened, 
a piece of merchandise can never be sold 
as new again, even if the merchandise was 
never used.
 ✓ Defective units: This is a piece of 
merchandise deemed defective by either 
the store or by the user and returned to the 
manufacturer.
 ✓ Overstocks: When manufacturers come 
out with a new model, they may take back 
the older models from retailers in an effort 
to encourage them to stock more of the 
newer, faster, cooler model.
Whenever an item is returned to the manufac-
turer for any reason and the original box has 
been opened, the item (whether it’s a television, 
a computer, a camera, or some other technical 
device), must be reconditioned to the manu-
facturer’s original quality standards. Any non-
functioning parts are replaced with functioning 
components and the item is repackaged. The 
manufacturer usually gives refurbished items 
a 90-day warranty.
When buying refurbished goods, be sure the 
original manufacturer was the one doing the 
reconditioning. I’m sure that some technical 
geeks can fix things just fine in their garage, 
but you don’t have the same level of protection 
(as in, you don’t have a warranty from a reliable 
source) if you buy a piece of equipment that 
wasn’t fixed by the manufacturer.

Salvage: Liquidation Items, Unclaimed Freight, and Returns
 
 The merchandise can be an assortment of liquidations, store returns, 
salvage, closeouts, shelf pulls, overstocks, and surplus goods. Some 
items may be damaged but repairable; others may be perfectly salable. 
As much as 30% or more of a truckload may be useless. Buying liquida-
tion merchandise is a gamble but can have advantages. By buying a full 
truckload, you have a wide breadth of merchandise, you pay the lowest 
amount for it, and some of it may be good for spare parts. Just make 
sure beforehand that you have a place to put it all.
 
Save yourself some money. Don’t go on eBay and buy some wholesale list for 
$5. You can get the same names by running a Google search on the term 
wholesale. Every true wholesaler Web site has a dealer login page, so try 
searching for dealer login along with a category name, such as dealer login 
jewelry.
Salvage: Liquidation Items, Unclaimed Freight, 
and Returns
The easiest to buy for resale, salvage merchandise is retail merchandise that 
has been returned, exchanged, or shelf-pulled for some reason. Salvage can 
also encompass liquidation merchandise and unclaimed freight. Generally, 
this merchandise is sold as-is and where-is and may be in new condition. 
To buy this merchandise directly from the liquidator in large lots, you must 
have your resale (sales tax number) permit and be prepared to pay the ship-
ping to your location.
Several types of salvage merchandise are available:
 
✦ Unclaimed freight: When a trucking company delivers merchandise, a 
manifest accompanies the freight. If, for some reason, a portion of the 
shipment arrives incomplete, contains the wrong items, or is damaged, 
the entire shipment may be refused by the merchant. The trucking com-
pany is now stuck with as much as a truckload of freight. The original 
seller may not want to pay the freight charges to return the merchandise 
to his or her warehouse (or accept blame for an incorrect shipment), 
so the freight becomes the trucker’s problem. The trucking companies 
arrive at agreements with liquidators to buy this freight in the various 
areas that the liquidators serve. This way, truckers are never far from a 
location where they can dump, er, drop off merchandise.
 
✦ Returns: Did you know that when you return something to a store or 
mail-order house, it can never be sold as new again (in most states 
anyway)? The merchandise is generally sent to a liquidator who agrees 
in advance to pay a flat percentage for goods. The liquidator must move 
the merchandise to someone else. All major retailers liquidate returns, 
and much of this merchandise ends up on eBay or in closeout stores.

Salvage: Liquidation Items, Unclaimed Freight, and Returns
 
 If you’re handy at repairing electronics or computers, you’d probably do 
very well with a specialized lot. You may easily be able to revitalize dam-
aged merchandise, often using parts from two unsalable items to come 
up with one that you can sell in like-new working condition.
 
✦ Liquidations: Liquidators buy liquidation merchandise by truckloads 
and sell it in smaller lots. The merchandise comes from financially 
stressed or bankrupt companies that need to raise cash quickly.
 
 The liquidation business has been thriving as a well-kept secret for 
years. As long as you have space to store salvage merchandise and a 
way to sell it, you can acquire it for as low as ten cents on the dollar. 
When I say you need storage space, I mean lots of space. To buy this 
type of merchandise at bottom-of-the-barrel prices, you must be will-
ing to accept truckloads — full 18-wheelers, loaded with more than 20 
pallets (4 feet x 4 feet x 6 or 7 feet) — of merchandise at a time. Often 
these truckloads have manifests (a document containing the contents of 
the shipment) listing the retail and wholesale price of each item on the 
truck. If you have access to the more-than-10,000-square-feet of ware-
house that you’ll need to unpack and process this amount of merchan-
dise, you’re in business.
 
 I’m a fan of Liquidatation.com and often find myself scrolling their home 
page to see the current offerings (see Figure 4-2). Buying from them at a 
good price can mean healthy profits.

Salvage: Liquidation Items, Unclaimed Freight, and Returns
 
✦ Seasonal overstocks: My motto is “Buy off-season, sell on-season.” At 
the end of the season, a store may find its shelves overloaded with sea-
sonal merchandise (such as swimsuits in August) that it must get rid 
of to make room for the next season’s stock. These brand-new items 
become salvage merchandise because they’re seasonal overstocks.
 
✦ Shelf-pulls: Have you ever passed up one item in the store for the 
one behind it in the display because its box was in better condition? 
Sometimes the plastic bubble or the package is dented, and you’d rather 
have a pristine one. That box you just passed up may be destined to 
become a shelf-pull. The item inside may be in perfect condition, but it’s 
cosmetically unsalable in the retail-store environment.
 
Some liquidation items, unclaimed freight, and returns may be unsalable. 
Although you’ll acquire many gems that stand to bring you profit, you’ll also 
be left with a varying percentage of useless items.
Liquidation merchandise can be new, used, or 
trashed. Searching through a liquidator’s eBay 
auctions is like digging through the “Final Sale” 
bin at a store, where prices are marked down 
to absurd levels. 
Liquidators buy merchandise from companies 
that are in financial distress and need to raise 
cash quickly. The kinds of issues companies 
face can vary — the why isn’t important. All 
you need to know is that you can get access to 
some astonishing deals because some of it is 
sold in lots on eBay. 
Merchandise arrives by the truckload. From 
there the merchandise is unloaded, inspected, 
and sorted — and then the fun begins. Some 
of the merchandise can be put together in 
wholesale lots (the goods are grouped by the 
pallet or by the case and sold to wholesalers or 
retailers), and some of the merchandise may 
be put aside to be sold to sellers for resale on 
eBay.
Buying items from liquidators can be a risky 
enterprise. There’s no warranty, and no one 
you can complain to if something is wrong with 
the item. All items are always sold as is and 
where is. Essentially, what you see is what you 
get; if it works, it’s a bonus. 
Here are some tips for buying this type of item:
 ✓ Look for “sealed in the box”: Look at the 
picture and read the description carefully. 
If the description states that the item is 
sealed in the manufacturers packaging, 
you have a pretty good chance that the 
item is in new condition.
 ✓ Don’t spend a bundle: This kind of goes 
without saying, right? It’s supposed to be 
a bargain.

Staying Safe When Buying Online
Some liquidation sellers sell their merchandise in the same condition that 
it ships in to their location, so what you get is a crapshoot. You may lose 
money on some items while making back your money on others. Other sell-
ers who charge a bit more will remove less desirable merchandise from 
the pallets. Some may even make up deluxe pallets with better-quality 
merchandise. These loads cost more, but if they’re filled with the type of 
merchandise that you’re interested in selling, you’ll probably write better 
descriptions and subsequently do a better job selling them.
 
Before you glaze over and get dazzled by a low, low price on a lot, check the 
shipping cost to you before you buy. Many so-called wholesalers will lure 
you in with bargain-basement prices, only to charge you three times the 
normal shipping costs. Do your homework before you buy!
Staying Safe When Buying Online
 
Nobody offers a quality or fitness guarantee when you buy liquidation mer-
chandise. You could end up with pallets of unsalable merchandise, and you 
must steer quickly away from anyone who guarantees that you’ll make 
money. Remember that liquidation merchandise is always sold as-is.
 
Unfortunately, this market is rife with unscrupulous sellers who are middle-
men. They buy the truckloads, go through everything with a fine-tooth 
comb, and pull out all the saleable merchandise. Then they repack the pal-
lets and sell them to unsuspecting newbies who think that they may get a 
good deal.
When buying online, it’s hard to know about the company you’re deal-
ing with because you’ve probably just found them after performing a Web 
search. When you find a source from which you want to buy merchandise by 
the pallet, check out a few things before spending your hard-earned cash:
 
✦ Get an anonymous free e-mail address from Yahoo! before signing up 
for any mailing lists or newsletters. Some Web sites that offer these 
publications make most of their money by selling your e-mail address to 
spammers. If you give them an anonymous e-mail address, the buckets 
of spam will never end up in your real mailbox. (I learned about that the 
hard way.)
 
✦ Raise your shields if the wholesalers also link their Web sites to mis-
cellaneous make-big-profits-on-eBay Web sites. They may be making 
most of their money from commissions when the e-book of “road-to-
riches secret tips” is sold to you.

458
Dealing with Drop-Shippers
 
✦ Be sure the site has a phone number. Give them a call and see how 
you’re treated. It’s no guarantee of how they’ll treat you if you’re 
unhappy with a purchase, but you may get a human being on the phone 
(rare and precious these days).
 
✦ Look for a physical address. Do they have a place of business or is the 
company running out of some guy’s pocket cell phone? (Often it’s not a 
good sign if there’s no place to hang a sign.)
 
✦ Ask for references. Seeing the Better Business Bureau Online, TrustE, 
or SquareTrade logo on the Web site can bolster trust in the company. 
(They have to qualify for those seals.)
 
✦ Before you purchase anything, go to eBay and see whether that item 
will sell — and for how much. Often you find hundreds of listings for an 
item with no bids. Check completed auctions and be sure that the item 
is selling for a solid profit over what you expect to pay for it (including 
shipping).
 
✦ Never buy anything just because it’s cheap. That was true in Thomas 
Jefferson’s day and is still true today. Be sure you can actually sell the 
merchandise. (I also learned this the hard way.)
 
✦ Guarantee: Does the source guarantee that you will make money or that 
you can make money by buying the right merchandise? Remember that 
no one can guarantee that you’ll make money.
 
✦ References: Does the supplier offer on its Web site references that you 
can contact to find out some usable information on this seller’s items 
and the percentage of unsalable goods in a box or pallet?
 
✦ Look for FOB. That means freight on board. You will be charged freight 
from the location of the merchandise to your door. The shorter the dis-
tance, the cheaper your freight costs.
 
Before doing business on any Web site, be sure its owners have a privacy 
policy that protects your personal information. Also check for an About Us 
page and make sure the page talks about the business and the people behind 
it. I hate to be repetitive, but be sure you can reach a human being on a 
phone or in person (with a street address) if need be.
Dealing with Drop-Shippers
A drop-shipper is a business that stocks merchandise, sells the merchandise 
to you (the reseller), but ships it directly to your customer. By using a drop-
shipper, you transfer the risks of buying, storing, and shipping merchandise 
to another party. You become a stockless retailer with no inventory hanging 
around — often an economical, cost-effective way to do business.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Liquidation and 
Drop-Shipping
459
Dealing with Drop-Shippers
The following steps outline the standard way to work with most drop-
shippers on eBay:
 
1. Sign up on the drop-shipper’s Web site to sell their merchandise on 
eBay or in your Web store. Check out their terms before you sign up to 
be sure there’s no minimum purchase.
 
2. Select the items from their inventory that you want to sell. The supplier 
gives you descriptive copy and photographs to help make your sales job 
easier.
 
3. Post the item online and wait (fidgeting with anticipation) for someone 
to buy it.
 
4. As soon as your buyer pays you for the item, e-mail the drop-shipper (or 
fill out a special secure form on their Web site) and pay for the item with 
your credit card or PayPal.
 
5. Relax while the drop-shipper ships the item to your customer for you.
 
6. If all goes well, the item arrives quickly and safely.
You make a profit and get some positive feedback.
 
The drop-shipper’s Web site provides you with descriptions and images. 
Fine. But you and everybody else who sells that item on eBay will have the 
same photos and descriptive copy. Do yourself a favor and get a sample of 
your item, take your own pictures, and write your own description. Then at 
least you have a chance at beating the competitive sameness on eBay.
Drop-shipping works especially well for Web-based retail operations. Web 
stores can link directly to the drop-shipper to transmit shipping and pay-
ment information. When you’re selling on eBay, it’s another thing. There’s 
more competition and you can’t list hundreds of items at no additional cost.
Listing items on eBay costs money and may build up your expenses before 
you make a profit. You can’t just select an item from a drop-shipper and 
throw hundreds of auctions on eBay without losing money. That is, unless 
your item is selling like gangbusters at an enormous profit. If that were the 
case, believe me, there would be another eBay seller buying directly from 
the manufacturer and undercutting your price.
 
I must interject that I bought (for research) several drop-shipper lists from 
eBay sellers. I am saddened to report that I couldn’t find any that fulfilled my 
security requirements for doing business with an unknown business online. 
The drop-shippers whose merchandise I could track had a penchant for 
flooding the eBay market by selling the same item to too many sellers — 
thereby driving down the price. I also found little brand-name merchandise 
available. If any of my readers find a reputable drop-shipper who allows 
room for profit on eBay, please e-mail me through my Web site. I think this is 
a business that could work, but only if the right businesses were involved.

Dealing with Drop-Shippers
 
It’s one thing to sign up for a free newsletter — or even to register with a 
particular site — but it’s something else to have to pay to see what the drop-
shipper intends to offer you. You should not pay anything in advance for the 
opportunity to check out a drop-shipper’s merchandise.
Finding a good drop-shipper
Thousands of Web companies are aching to help you set up your online 
business. Some of them are good solid companies with legitimate back-
grounds, but others are just trying to get your money. These guys hope you 
don’t know what you’re doing; they’re betting you’ll be desperate enough to 
send them some cash to help you get your share of the (har, har) “millions 
to be made online.”
Consider the following when you’re choosing drop-shippers to work with:
 
✦ Skepticism is healthy. When you come across Web sites that proclaim 
that they can drop-ship thousands of different products for you, think 
twice. Thousands? I don’t know many stores that carry thousands of 
items — if they do, they have vast square footage for storage and 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest in merchandise. Most drop-
shipping services don’t. A much smaller offering of merchandise may 
indicate that the drop-shipper has the merchandise ready to ship and 
isn’t relying on ordering it from someone for you.
Some middlemen, wholesalers, and liquida-
tors specialize in selling to online auctioneers 
through a drop-ship service. Some crafty eBay 
sellers make lots of money selling lists of drop-
shipping sources to eBay sellers — I hope not 
to you. Dealing with a drop-shipper means that 
you don’t ever have to take possession of (or 
pay for) the merchandise. You’re given a photo 
and, after you sell the item, you give the vendor 
the address of the buyer. They charge your 
credit card for the item plus shipping, and then 
ship the item to your customer for you. 
This way of doing business costs you more and 
lowers your profits. Your goal as a business 
owner is to make as much money as you can. 
Because the drop-shipper is in business too, 
they’ll mark up the merchandise (and the ship-
ping cost) so they can make their profit. 
Be careful when using a drop-shipper. Ask for 
references. See whether a zillion sellers are 
selling the same merchandise on eBay — and 
not getting any bites. Also, what happens if a 
drop-shipper runs out of an item that you’ve 
just sold? You can’t just say “oops” to your 
buyer without getting some nasty feedback. 
It’s your online reputation at stake. If you find a 
solid source and believe in the product, order 
a quantity and have it shipped to your door. 
Don’t pay for someone else’s mark-up just for 
the convenience of having them ship to your 
customers.

Dealing with Drop-Shippers
 
✦ Look out for long lines of distribution. Drop-shippers are often middle-
men who broker merchandise from several sources — for example, from 
other middlemen who buy from brokers (who in turn buy from manufac-
turers). The line of distribution can get even longer — which means that 
a slew of people are making a profit from your item before you even buy 
it “wholesale.” If even one other reseller gets the product directly from 
the distributor or (heaven forbid) the manufacturer, that competitor can 
easily beat your target selling price. Verify with the drop-shipper that 
they stock the merchandise they sell.
Coping with the inevitable out-of-stock
What happens when you sell an item and you go to the distributor’s site 
and find that it’s sold out? Before your heart stops, call the drop-shipper. 
Perhaps they still have one or two of your items around their warehouse and 
took the item off the Web site because they’re running too low to guarantee 
delivery.
If that isn’t the case, you’re going to have to contact your buyer and ’fess up 
that the item is currently out of stock at your supplier. I suggest calling your 
customers in this situation; they may not be as angry as they might be if you 
just e-mail them. Offer to refund the money immediately. Somebody else’s 
foul-up may net you bad feedback, but that risk goes along with using drop-
shipping as a business practice.

elcome to the cyberworld of imaging, where pictures aren’t called 
pictures, but images. With a digital camera or a scanner and soft-
ware, you can manipulate your images — crop, color-correct, and add spe-
cial effects — so they grab viewers by the lapels.
Sellers, take heed and read why you should use well-made digital images in 
your auction pages:
 
✦ If you don’t have a picture, potential bidders may wonder whether 
you’re deliberately hiding the item from view because you know some-
thing is wrong with it. Paranoid? Maybe. Practical? You bet.
 
✦ Fickle bidders don’t even bother reading an item description if they 
can’t see the item.
 
✦ Taking your own pictures shows that you have the item in your pos-
session. Many scam artists take images from a manufacturer’s Web site 
to illustrate their bogus sales on eBay. Why risk being suspect? Snap a 
quick picture!
 
✦ Everyone’s doing it. I hate to pressure you, but digital images are the 
custom on eBay, so if you’re not using them, you’re not reaching the 
widest possible number of people who would bid on your item. From 
that point of view, you’re not doing the most you can to serve your 
potential customers’ needs. Hey, fads are driven by conformity. You 
may as well use them to your advantage.
So which is better for capturing images: a digital camera or a digital scan-
ner? As with all gadgets, here’s the classic answer: It depends. For my 
money, it’s hard to beat a digital camera. But before you go snag one, decide 
what kind of investment (and how big) you plan to make in your eBay auc-
tions. If you’re already comfortable with 35mm camera equipment, don’t 
scrap it — scan (or find a digital SLR — single lens reflex). The scoop on 
both alternatives is coming right up.

Setting Up Your Studio
Setting Up Your Studio
Taking pictures for eBay? No problem! You have a digital camera, and you 
know how to use it. Just snap away and upload that picture, right? Sorry, but 
no. There’s a good way and a bad way to take photos for eBay and, believe it 
or not, the professional way taught by many instructors isn’t necessarily the 
best way.
I recommend that you set up a mini photo studio for your eBay auction pic-
tures. That way, you won’t have to clean off your kitchen counter every time 
you want to take pictures.
 
If you must use the kitchen counter or a desktop, be sure to use an inexpen-
sive photo stage, which you can find on — where else? — eBay.
You need several basic things in your photo studio; the extras you should 
have are based on the type of merchandise you’re selling. An eBay generalist, 
someone who sells almost anything online — like me! — should have quite a 
few extras for taking quality photos. Check out a portion of my home photo 
studio in Figure 1-1. This setup works well for small as well as large items.

Alternatively, in Figure 1-2, I use a photo cube combined with either small 
clamp lights (shown), true color lamps, or tall floodlights. A photo cube 
works well for finely detailed and collectible objects — as well as any object 
that will fit in them. By using a translucent fabric cube, you can fully illumi-
nate your item and have no glare, harsh shadows, or detail burnout!

Hands down, the equipment for photographing jewelry and teeny, tiny items 
is the Cloud Dome (see “Other Studio Equipment” later in this chapter). It 
not only helps with lighting, but also holds your camera steady for difficult 
super-magnified (macro) shots.
What you find in this section might be more than you thought you’d need to 
produce good pictures. But your photographs can help sell your merchan-
dise, so you need to consider this part of your business seriously. Of course, 
if you sell only one type of item, you won’t need such a varied selection of 
stuff, but you should have the basic photo setup. Check my Web site (www.
coolebaytools.com) for more ideas.
Your #1 Tool: A Digital Camera
Digital cameras are mysterious things. You may read about megapixels (a 
million pixels) and think that more is supposed to be better, but that doesn’t 
apply to eBay applications or to Web images. Megapixels measure the image 

468
Your #1 Tool: A Digital Camera
resolution that the camera is capable of recording. For online use, all you 
need from a camera is 640 x 480 pixels (or, at the most, 800 x 600 pixels) 
because computer monitors are incapable of taking advantage of more 
pixels. If you use a higher-resolution picture, you’ll have a pixel-bloated pic-
ture that takes a looooong time to load online.
The camera you use for eBay is a personal choice. Would-be big-time sellers 
starting out in an eBay business (with no experience on the Internet) usu-
ally go out and buy the most expensive digital camera they can find. Maybe 
having lots of megapixels is a macho thing, but a camera with a bunch of 
megapixels is the last thing you need for eBay images.
You don’t need a million pixels, but you do need the following:
 
✦ Quality lens: I’m sure anyone who has worn glasses can tell the differ-
ence between a good lens and a cheap one. Really cheap cameras have 
plastic lenses, and the quality of the resulting pictures is accordingly 
lousy. Your camera will be your workhorse, so be sure to buy one from a 
company known for making quality products.
 
✦ Removable media: Most cameras can connect to your PC with a USB 
cable, and many sellers are happy with that type of connection. Others 
find that taking their camera to the computer and using cables and extra 
software to download pictures to the hard drive is annoying. Removable 
media eliminate this annoyance. Here’s a starter list of removable stor-
age media:
 
• CompactFlash memory card: This is a small medium, slightly smaller 
than a matchbook. You insert it into a media reader to transfer the 
data to your computer. CompactFlash cards come in different sizes, 
and hold from 16 MB to 16 GB.
 
• Secure digital card: The fairly new incarnation in mini storage is the 
secure digital card. This amazing little piece of technology (the size 
of a postage stamp) is one of the most durable of the small media. 
It’s encased in plastic, as is the CompactFlash card and the Memory 
Stick. It also uses metal connector contacts (rather than pins and 
plugs like other cards), making it less prone to damage. These cards 
can be set to hold up to 32 GB.
 
• Mini and micro secure digital cards: If the matchbook-size SD card 
wasn’t small enough, manufacturers decided to miniaturize them 
further — and increase the amount of data they can carry. The mini 
version is about the size of a postage stamp and the micro? When I 
first saw this card, I was afraid to touch it. It’s about the size of my 
pinky nail and can hold up to an astounding 12 GB (check out Figure 
1-3). The micro card can often be purchased with an adapter that will 
allow it to be inserted into a carrier so it can be used in any standard 
SD card slot.

many 
sizes and 
adapters for 
SD cards.
 
 
• SmartMedia cards: A SmartMedia card is slightly smaller than a 
CompactFlash card, is very thin, and has no plastic outer case. It’s 
used in only a few brands of digital cameras (such as Olympus). 
SmartMedia cards come in different data sizes, from 8MB to 128MB.
 
• Memory Stick: A tiny media card (about the size of a piece of chew-
ing gum and as long as a AA battery), the Memory Stick is a Sony 
device used in most Sony products. Memory Sticks now hold as 
much as 2 GB. One of the great things about a Memory Stick is that 
it can be used in numerous devices besides cameras, including PCs 
and video recorders.
 
• Mini CD, CD/RW, or DVD: These optical discs hold tons of pics for 
eBay. You can read them right in your computer’s CD or DVD reader. 
Check out your disc platter, and you’ll notice a smaller round inden-
tation; that’s what holds the mini disc.
 
 You insert any of these media directly into your computer, if your com-
puter has ports for them. Or get an adapter that connects to your com-
puter through a USB or parallel port. You can get appropriate readers on 
eBay for about $20.
 
 You may find that you use more than one type of medium with your digi-
tal camera. And because you can record any type of digital data on these 
types of removable media, you may find other uses for them. For exam-
ple, sometimes when I want to back up files (or move larger files) and 
don’t have access to my flash drive, I copy them onto one of my camera 
memory cards in the reader on my desktop computer and then transfer 
the files by plugging the card into the adapter on my laptop.
 
✦ Optical zoom versus digital zoom: Two characteristics to keep in mind 
when looking for a camera are convenience and optical zoom. Choose a 
camera that is easy to use and has the accessories you want. Also, make 
sure that the optical-zoom capabilities will help you capture the level of 
detail that your merchandise requires.

470
Your #1 Tool: A Digital Camera
 
 When shopping for your camera, find one with the highest-power opti-
cal zoom that you can afford. Optical zoom is magnified by the camera’s 
lens (using the camera’s internal optics), producing a vivid picture.
 
 Digital zoom is valuable with a camcorder when you’re shooting moving 
pictures, because the eye can’t focus as easily as the camera on moving 
results. When your camera uses digital zoom, it does the same thing 
as enlarging a picture in photo-editing software. The camera centers 
the focus over half the focal plane, and uses software interpolation to 
enlarge the picture. This makes your image slightly fuzzy.
 
✦ Tripod mount: Have you ever had a camera hanging around your neck 
while you’re trying to repackage some eBay merchandise that you’ve 
just photographed? Or perhaps you’ve set down the camera for a minute 
and then can’t find it? Avoid this hassle by using a tripod to hold your 
camera. Tripods also help you avoid blurring your pictures if your 
hands are a bit shaky. To use a tripod, you need a tripod mount, the little 
screw-hole that you see at the bottom of some cameras. Later in this 
chapter, I give you some tips on finding the right tripod.
 
✦ Macro setting capability or threading for a lens adapter: These fea-
tures will come in handy if you plan to photograph coins, jewelry, or 
small detailed items. A camera’s macro setting enables you to get in 
really close to items while keeping them in focus. Usually the macro 
mode can focus as close as 1 inch and as far away as 10 inches. A small 
flower icon in the camera’s menu normally signifies the macro setting. A 
threaded lens mount is an alternative that enables you to add different 
types of lenses to the camera for macro focus or other uses.
 
 The average camera’s focal length (focus range) is from 3 feet to infin-
ity. If you have a camera that says the macro focus range is set at 5.1 
inches, it means you can’t focus it clearly on an object any closer than 
5.1 inches. Macro pictures require a steady hand (or affix your camera 
to a Cloud Dome or at the very least to a tripod); any vibration can 
blur your image.
 
✦ Battery life: When you’re choosing your camera, be sure to check into 
the length of time the camera’s battery will hold a charge. The last thing 
you want to do is run out of juice at the wrong moment. Consider the 
following:
 
• Look for a camera battery with at least three hours of photo-taking 
time.
 
• Keep a spare battery on hand. I keep a Lithium CR-V3 battery (which 
replaces two AA batteries) in my purse so I’ll be prepared if my 
camera battery runs low while I’m on the road.
 
• Invest in a charger and rechargeable batteries. I have a rechargeable 
backup battery for my camera in the office. These batteries last a 
long time and are worth the investment.

Scanning Your Wares
 
 Cameras have presets for different focal ranges, and they’re usually set 
in meters. (There’s an m following the focus range number.) Just so you 
won’t forget, a meter is approximately 3 feet in distance.
 
✦ White-balance setting: This is a tricky feature. Most eBay digital pho-
tographers set the camera to Auto (if there is a setting) and hope for the 
best. If you can adjust the white balance, do so. Manufacturers use dif-
ferent presets. The list of options can include settings for incandescent 
lights, twilight, fluorescent lights, outdoor, indoor, or shade. All these 
lighting situations have different color temperatures, as I discuss in the 
“Lighting” section later in this chapter.
 
 It’s worthwhile to take the time to play with the various white-balance 
settings of your camera in the different places where you normally pho-
tograph eBay merchandise. Make notes on settings that give you the 
truest colors in your digital images.
 
✦ Autofocus and zoom: These options just make life easier when you want 
to take pictures, and should be standard features.
The bottom line is that you should buy a brand-name camera. I often still use 
an antique Sony Mavica FD92 for eBay pictures. (I use a Nikon CoolPix for 
shooting around as well.) The Mavica is way outdated, but it’s also loaded 
with all the bells and whistles I need for eBay photos. It stores images on a 
floppy disk (remember those?) or on a Sony Memory Stick, which I just pop 
out and insert in my computer. The camera’s storage convenience makes the 
Mavica FD series a favorite of eBay sellers.
I bet you could find a camera that fits your needs right now on eBay for con-
siderably less than $150. (The old Mavica FD series can be had dirt-cheap, 
and they’re still big sellers on eBay). Remember that many digital camera 
users buy the newest camera available and sell their older, low-megapixel 
cameras on eBay for a pittance. Many professional camera stores also sell 
used equipment.
Scanning Your Wares
Scanners have come a long way in the past few years. A once-expensive item 
can now be purchased new for a little more than a $100. If you sell books, 
autographs, stamps, or documents, a scanner may be all you need to shoot 
your images for eBay.
When shopping for a scanner, don’t pay too much attention to the resolu-
tion. Some scanners can provide resolutions as high as 12,800 dpi, which 
looks awesome when you print the image. But to dress up your eBay auc-
tions, all you need is (are you ready?) 72 dpi! That’s it. Your images will look 
great, won’t take up much storage space on your computer’s hard drive, and 

472
Scanning Your Wares
won’t take forever to load when a buyer looks at them. Basic scanners can 
scan images up to 1200 dpi, so even they are more powerful than you need 
for your eBay images. As with digital cameras, you should stick with a brand-
name scanner.
You should use a flatbed scanner, on which you lay out your items and scan 
away. I replaced my old scanner with an HP All-in-One, which is not only a 
scanner but also a printer, a fax machine, and a color copier! These nifty flat-
bed units are available new on eBay. I’ve seen HP models, new in box, sell for 
as low as $100.
A few tips on scanning images for eBay:
 
✦ If you’re taking traditionally processed photographs and scanning them, 
print them on glossy paper because they’ll scan much better than those 
with a matte finish.
 
✦ You can scan 3-D items, such as a doll, on your flatbed scanner and 
get some respectable-looking images. To eliminate harsh shadows, lay 
a black or white T-shirt over the doll or her box so that it completely 
covers the glass. This way, you will have a clean background and get 
good light reflection from the scanner’s light.
 
✦ If you want to scan an item that’s too big for your scanner’s glass, simply 
scan the item in pieces, and then reassemble it to a single image in your 
photo-editing program. The instructions that come with your software 
should explain how to do this.
 
✦ Boxed items are a natural for a flatbed scanner. Just set them on top of 
the glass, and scan away. You can crop the shadowed background with 
your photo-editing software.
The majority of eBay sellers use a 
digital camera or a scanner to dress up their 
auctions with images, but some just use 
what they already own — their digital video 
cameras! Yup, after filming your day at the 
beach, point your lens at that Victorian doll 
and shoot. Most new (and inexpensive) video 
cameras have a single-frame setting so you 
can create your digital image right from the 
camera. Then just hook up the USB cable and 
download a stream of images quickly!
I am totally enamored with my Flip Video 
camera and my wonderful Sanyo Xacti. I use 
them often to take eBay pictures. Check online 
for the lowest prices — the Flip Video is often 
under $100. Of course, then search eBay for 
the best prices and see where you get the best 
deal.
Don’t ignore your video camera!

What you find in this section might be more than you thought you’d need for 
photographing your items. But photographs can help sell your merchandise, 
so you need to take this part of your business seriously. Of course, if you sell 
only one type of item, you won’t need such a varied selection of stuff, but 
you should have the basic photo setup.
Tripod
A tripod is an extendable, three-legged aluminum stand that holds your 
camera. You should look for one that has a quick release so if you want to 
take the camera off the tripod for a close-up, you don’t have to unscrew it 
from the base and then screw it back on for the next picture.
The legs should extend to your desired height, lock in place with clamp-type 
locks, and have a crank-style geared center column so you can move your 
camera smoothly up and down for different shots. Most tripods also have a 
panning head for shooting from different angles. You can purchase a tripod 
from a camera store or on eBay for as low as $25.
Power supplies
If you’ve ever used digital cameras, you know that they can blast through 
batteries faster than sugar through a 5-year-old. A reliable power supply is a 
must. You can accomplish this in a couple of ways:
 
✦ Rechargeable batteries: Many specialists on eBay sell rechargeable bat-
teries and chargers. Choose quality Ni-MH (nickel metal hydride) batter-
ies because this kind, unlike Ni-Cad (nickel-cadmium) batteries, has no 
“memory effect.” That means you don’t have to totally discharge them 
before recharging.
 
✦ Lithium-ion batteries: The CR-V3 is a new kind of battery that takes the 
place of two standard AA batteries. Lithium batteries (also available in 
other sizes) are the longest lasting and lightest batteries available, but 
they’re also expensive. Then some smart guy figured out a way to put 
two batteries into one unit; considerably cutting the price. This new 
battery can average 650 photos before you have to change it. The CR-V3 
is available also in a rechargeable form, thereby extending the life even 
farther (and reducing your battery budget significantly).
 
If your eBay photo studio includes a camera on a tripod (and it should), you 
can charge your camera directly with the good old-fashioned AC adapter 
(you know, it’s the one that plugs into the wall).

474
Other Studio Equipment
Lighting
Trying to take good pictures of your merchandise can be frustrating. If you 
don’t have enough light and use the camera’s flash, the image might be 
washed out. If you take the item outside, the sun might cast a shadow.
The autofocus feature on most digital cameras doesn’t work well in low light. 
I’ve seen some eBay sellers use a flash and instruct their children to shine a 
flashlight on the item as they photograph it from different angles — all the 
while hoping that the color isn’t wiped out.
After consulting specialists in the photo business to solve the problem of 
proper lighting for digital cameras, I put together an inexpensive studio 
lighting set for online auction photography. Please check my Web site (www.
coolebaytools.com) for information on how to obtain this package. It’s 
the same one that I successfully use in my home photo studio (refer to 
Figures 1-1 and 1-2).
Professional studio lights can be expensive, but you might be able to find a 
set for around $150. (You need at least two lights, one for either side of the 
item, to eliminate shadows.) Search eBay for used studio lighting; I’m sure 
you’ll find a good deal.
If you’re photographing small items, you can successfully use an Ott-Lite or a 
less expensive, generic true-color version, as shown in Figure 1-4. The lamp’s 
bulb is a full-spectrum, daylight 5000K florescent tube, good enough for jew-
elry photography. This same light is used for grading diamonds.
 
The color temperature of a light, which ranges from 2500°K to 7800°K, is a 
number given to a lighting condition. The K after the number signifies the 
Kelvin temperature range. Actual daylight color temperature is about 
5500°K, and it’s best to get your lighting as close to that as you can. Using a 
bulb with a daylight number is important because it’s a pure neutral, which 
means that it throws no blue or yellow cast on your images.
Photo cube
How much do I love my photo cube? I could write a poem! It allows me to 
take the most detailed photos of antiques and specialty items at night in my 
home. It works incredibly well wherever I use it because my kit includes two 
floodlights (and it all packs up into a neat bag). The nylon cube diffuses the 
light so that there are no harsh shadows and I don’t burn out minute details 
with too much light. Take a look at the details in Figure 1-5.

(and wider) paper that comes in various colors and is suspended and 
draped behind the model and over the floor. (Ever wonder why you 
never see the floor and wall come together in professional photos?) 
Photographers also drape the seamless over tabletop shots. Some 
people use fabrics such as muslin instead of seamless.
 
✦ Fabrics: I recommend using neutral fabrics (such as white, light gray, 
natural, and black) for photographing your merchandise so the color of 
the fabric doesn’t clash with or distract from your items. Some of the 
photo cubes on eBay come with great low-wrinkle fabric backgrounds 
as well.
 
✦ Photo Stage: A photo stage is another valuable tool for taking pictures 
indoors or out. Textured ABS plastic is manufactured so you can set it 
in a curve shape (see Figure 1-6); the stage can be set on any surface 
and will permit you to take a clean picture without any extraneous back-
grounds. You can store it flat on a bookshelf till you need it next.

Cloud Dome
If you’re going to photograph a lot of jewelry, collectible coins, or other 
metallic items, you’ll become frustrated at the quality of your pictures. 
Metallic objects seem to pick up random color from any kind of light you 
shine on them for picture-taking. Bad results: Gold jewelry will photograph 
with a silver tone and silver will look gold-ish!
After conferring with lots of eBay photo gurus, I was told the secret of get-
ting crisp, clear, close-up pictures: use a Cloud Dome. It stabilizes your 
camera (just as if you were using a tripod) and filters all unwanted color 
tones, resulting in image colors that look like your item.

The Cloud Dome is a large plastic bowl on which you mount your camera. 
You take your pictures through the dome. The translucent white plastic dif-
fuses the light so your item is lit evenly from all sides, eliminating glare and 
bad shadows. Check out the manufacturer’s Web site at www.clouddome.
com to see some amazing before and after pictures.
The Cloud Dome also manages to get the best images from gems. You can 
actually capture the light in the facets! Pearls, too, will show their luster. 
Several eBay members (including yours truly) sell the Cloud Dome; I highly 
recommend it! In Chapter 2 of this minibook, I show you how to use it.
Props
To take good photos, you need some props. Although you may think it 
strange that a line item in your accounting program will read props, they do 
qualify as a business expense. (Okay, you can put it under “photography 
expenses” — props just sounds so Hollywood!)
How often have you seen some clothing on eBay from a quality manufac-
turer, but you just couldn’t bring yourself to bid more than $10 because it 
looked like it had been dragged behind a car and then hung on a hanger 
before it was photographed? Could you see how the fabric would hang on a 
body? Of course not.
Mannequin
If you’re selling clothing, you’d better photograph it on a mannequin. If you 
don’t want to dive right in and buy a mannequin, at least get a body form to 
wear the outfit. Just search eBay for mannequin to find hundreds of hollow 
forms selling for less than $20. If you sell children’s clothing, get a child’s 
mannequin form as well. The same goes for men’s clothes. If worst comes to 
worst, find a friend to model the clothes. There’s just no excuse for hanger-
displayed merchandise in your auctions.
 
I got my mannequin (Midge) at a department store liquidation sale here in 
Los Angeles. I paid $25 for her. Her face is a little creepy, so I often crop her 
head out of the photos. She has a great body and everything she wears sells 
at a profit. Many stores upgrade their mannequins every few years or so. If 
you know people who work at a retail store, ask when they plan to sell their 
old mannequins; you may be able to pick one up at a reasonable price.
Display stands, risers, and more
Jewelry doesn’t photograph well on a person’s hand and looks a lot better 
when you display it on a stand (see Figure 1-7) or a velvet pad. If you’re 
selling a necklace, display it on a necklace stand, not on a person. I bought 
my display stands from a manufacturer but had to wait several months to 
receive them. Apparently, this type of quality display stand is made to order, 
so I recommend searching for them on eBay (you’ll get them sooner).

Risers can be almost anything that you use to prop up your item to make it 
more attractive in a picture. Put riser pieces that aren’t attractive under the 
cloth that you use as a background. Keep a collection of risers and propping 
materials in your photo area so they’re always close at hand.
You wouldn’t believe what the back of some professional photo setups look 
like. Photographers and photo stylists think resourcefully when it comes to 
making the merchandise look good — from the front of the picture, anyway! 
Throughout my years of working with professional photographers, I’ve seen 
the most creative things used to prop up items for photography:
 
✦ Bottles of heavy stuff: A photographer I once worked with used little 
bottles of mercury to prop up small boxes and other items in a picture. 
Mercury is a heavy liquid metal — but also a poison, so I suggest you do 
the same with small bottles (prescription bottles work well) filled with 
other weighty stuff (how about sand?).
 
✦ Beeswax and clay: To set up photos for catalogs, I’ve seen photogra-
phers prop up fine jewelry and collectible porcelain with beeswax (the 
kind you can get from the orthodontist works great) or clay. Beeswax is 
a neutral color and doesn’t usually show up in the photo. However, you 
must dispose of beeswax afterward, often because it picks up dirt from 
your hands and fuzz from fabric.

Book V
Chapter 1

✦ Museum Gel or Quake Hold: These two products are invaluable when 
you want to hold a small object at an unnatural angle for a photograph. 
(They’re like beeswax and clay, but cleaner.) Museums use this putty-
like product to securely keep breakables in one place — even during 
an earthquake! Museum Gel can sometimes be difficult to remove from 
items (and can leave a residue), so that’s why I use Quake Hold putty for 
my eBay items.
 
✦ Metal clamps and duct tape: These multipurpose items are used in 
many photo shoots in some of the strangest places. For example, if your 
mannequin is a few sizes too small for the dress you want to photo-
graph, how do you fix that? Don’t pad the mannequin; simply fold over 
the dress in the back and clamp the excess material with a metal clamp, 
or use a clothespin or a small piece of duct tape to hold the fabric taut.

P
hotography has always been a passion for me. The hobby led me (at 
the age of 10) from developing film in a tiny storage-closet darkroom 
through my first side-advertising job for a camera store (yes, I was always 
a moonlighter) to a great professional gig taking photographs of NASCAR 
auto racing for magazines and newspapers. I worked also with professional 
catalog photographers and picked up some tricks for setting up pictures, 
buffing up the merchandise, and making everything look picture-perfect. In 
this chapter, I pass on the tips and shortcuts to you. Use these ideas to take 
great pictures that flatter your merchandise and help you sell!
Photo Guidelines
The idea behind using images in your auctions is to attract tons of potential 
buyers. With that goal in mind, you should try to create the best-looking 
images possible, no matter what kind of technology you’re using to capture 
them.
Point-and-shoot may be okay for a group shot at a historical monument, but 
illustrating your auction is a whole different idea. Whether you’re using a 
traditional film camera (so you can scan your developed photographs later) 
or a digital camera to capture your item, some basic photographic guide-
lines can give you better results:
 
✦ Do take the picture of your item outside, in filtered daylight, whenever 
possible. That way the camera can catch all possible details and color. 
If you can’t take your images during the day, use a good set of true-color 
lights, either on clamps or stands.

482
Photo Guidelines
 
✦ Do forget about fancy backgrounds; they distract viewers from your 
item. Put small items on a neutral-colored, nonreflective towel or cloth; 
put larger items in front of a neutral-colored wall or curtain. You’ll crop 
out almost all the background when you prepare the picture on your 
computer before uploading the image.
 
✦ Do avoid getting yourself in the photo by shooting your pictures from an 
angle. If you see your reflection in the item, move and try again.
 
 One of my favorite eBay pictures featured a piece of fine silver taken by 
the husband of the lady selling the piece on eBay. Silver and reflective 
items are hard to photograph because they pick up everything in the 
room in their reflection. In her description, the lady explained that the 
man reflected in the silver coffeepot was her husband and not part of 
the final deal. She handled that very well! To solve this reflective prob-
lem, take pictures of silvery objects in a photo cube.
 
✦ Do use extra lighting. You can do this with your camera’s flash mode or 
(even better) with extra photo lighting. Use extra lighting, even when 
you’re taking the picture outside. The extra lighting acts as fill light — it 
adds more light to the item, filling in some of the shadowed spots.
 
✦ Don’t get so close to the item that the flash washes out (overexposes) 
the image. The easiest way to figure out the best distance is by trial and 
error. Start close and keep moving farther away until you get the results 
you want.
 
✦ Do take two or three acceptable versions of your image. You can choose 
the best one later on your computer.
 
✦ Do take a close-up or two of detailed areas that you want buyers to see 
(in addition to a wide shot of the entire item), if your item relies on detail.
 
✦ Do make sure that the items are clean. Cellophane on boxes can get 
nasty-looking, clothing can get linty, and all merchandise can get dirt 
smudges. Not only will your items photograph better if they’re clean, 
they’ll sell better, too. Further in this chapter I give you some tips on 
cleaning specific items.
 
 
 If you’re selling coins, don’t clean them! If your coin is of any value at all, 
the price will plummet (and your selling reputation be ruined) once the 
savvy coin collector discovers your efforts.
 
✦ Do make sure that you focus the camera; nothing is worse than a blurry 
picture. If your camera is a fixed-focus model (it can’t be adjusted), get 
only as close as the manufacturer recommends. Automatic-focus cam-
eras measure the distance and change the lens setting as needed. But 
just because a camera has an autofocus feature doesn’t mean that pic-
tures automatically come out crisp and clear. Low light, high moisture, 
and other things can contribute to a blurred image. Double-check the 
picture before you use it.

Photographing the Tuff Stuff: Coins and Jewelry
 
Some eBay creeps, whether out of laziness or deceit, steal images from other 
eBay members. (They simply make a digital copy of the image and use it in 
their own auctions. This is so uncool because the copied image doesn’t actu-
ally represent their item.) This pilfering has happened to me on several 
occasions. To prevent picture-snatching, you can add your user ID to all 
your photos. The next time somebody lifts one of your pictures, it has your 
name on it. If you’re familiar with adding HTML code to your auctions, check 
out the simple Java code on my Web site (www.coolebaytools.com) that 
you can insert in your auction descriptions to prevent unscrupulous users 
from stealing your images.
Lifting another seller’s photos is against eBay’s rules, so be sure to report 
any photo-thieving sellers you find to eBay’s Security Center at
http://pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/
 
Avoid using incandescent or fluorescent lighting to illuminate the photos 
you take. Incandescent lighting tends to make items look yellowish, and fluo-
rescent lights lend a bluish tone to your photos. One exception is GE Reveal 
incandescent bulbs, which throw a good natural light. Halogen lights give a 
nice bright white, but they have a tendency to get very hot!
Photographing the Tuff Stuff: Coins and Jewelry
I’ve been selling on eBay since 1997 and thought I was pretty good at show-
ing off and selling my wares. But then I purchased a small lot of Morgan 
silver dollars to resell. I figured, no problem, I’d take my standard digital pic-
ture and sell away. Oops, my mistake. The digital pictures made my beautiful 
silver coins look gold!
Then came my next challenge: photographing some silvertone and goldtone 
costume jewelry. My setup — with its perfect positioning, beautiful lighting, 
and black velvet jewelry pads — looked stunning. The pictures should have 
been perfect. But the silvertone looked gold, and the goldtone looked silver. 
What’s the deal?
The deal is lighting — specifically, the need for ambient lighting. Ambient 
light (light that occurs naturally) is the best light for photographing many 
types of items, especially shiny items. I thought back to when I worked with 
catalog photographers who took pictures of jewelry — and I remembered 
the elaborate setup they used to produce the sparkling images you see in 
the ads. And although I can closely recreate the experts’ silk tents with 
photo cubes, the minimalist lighting and multiple light flashes per exposure 
of the professional photographer’s setup can’t be duplicated easily at home.

484
Photographing the Tuff Stuff: Coins and Jewelry
Enter the Cloud Dome, a giant bowl that you place upside-down over the 
object you want to photograph. This bowl evenly diffuses ambient room 
light over the surface area of the object. This way, you can produce quality 
digital images in average room lighting. The Cloud Dome also helps with the 
following:
 
✦ Eliminating camera shake: When taking close-focus, highly zoomed-in 
pictures, holding your camera steady is of utmost importance. Using a 
tripod is difficult with close-up pictures, so using a Cloud Dome is the 
best option because your camera mounts directly to the Dome and is 
held as still as if you were using a tripod.
 
✦ Consistent lighting: When you use flash or flood lighting alone (without 
a Cloud Dome) for pictures of metallic objects, your photographs can 
include shiny hotspots from reflections (off walls and ceilings), washed-
out areas from the glare of the lights, shadows, and loss of proper color. 
Shooting with the Cloud Dome
The Cloud Dome looks like a giant Tupperware bowl with a camera mount 
attached. Figure 2-1 shows a Cloud Dome being set up to photograph jewelry.
 
Figure 2-1:

Dome.
 
Follow these steps to take a picture with the Cloud Dome:
 
1. Attach your camera to the Cloud Dome’s mount with the lens posi-
tioned so that it peers into the hole at the top of the dome.
 
2. Place your item on top of a contrasting background.
 
 See the following section, “Tips for taking Cloud Dome pictures,” for 
ideas on choosing a background.
 
3. Place the dome with camera attached over your item.

4. Check the item’s position through your camera’s viewfinder or LCD 
screen.
 
 If the item is not in the center, center it. If you feel you need additional 
lighting to bring out a highlight, use a lamp outside the dome.
 
5. Focus your camera and shoot the picture.
Many items benefit from being photographed through a Cloud Dome, 
especially the following:
 
✦ Jewelry: I’ve found that taking pictures with the Dome keeps the gold 
color gold and the silver color silver. Also, using the Cloud Dome helps 
your camera pick up details such as engraving and the metal surround-
ing cloisonné work. It also gives pearls and gold their unique luster and 
soft reflection, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
Figure 2-2:

✦ Gems and stones: I’ve seen some beautiful pictures taken of gems and 
stones with the Cloud Dome. To achieve a special look, you can use a 
Cloud Dome accessory, a reversible gold-and-silver reflector. Especially 
when you use the silver side, facets of diamonds glisten as if they were 
in the pinpoint lights at the jeweler’s. You may also want to focus a 
floodlight or lamp on the outside of the dome for extra sparkle.
 
✦ Coins and stamps: The Cloud Dome allows you to hold the camera 
steady for extreme close-ups. It also allows you to photograph coins 
without getting any coloration that is not on the coin. For both coins and 
stamps, the Cloud Dome helps you achieve sharp focus and true color.

Photographing the Tuff Stuff: Coins and Jewelry
 
✦ Holographic or metallic accented items: If you’ve ever tried to photo-
graph collector cards, you know that the metal accents glare and holo-
grams are impossible to capture. Also, the glossy coatings confuse the 
camera’s light sensors, causing overexposed highlights.
 
✦ Reflective objects: Items such as silverware or even computer chips 
reflect a lot of light when lit properly for photos. The Cloud Dome dif-
fuses the light so that the pictures become clear. Check out the before 
and after photos in Figure 2-3.

Tips for taking Cloud Dome pictures
Surprisingly, there’s little learning curve to using a Cloud Dome. The simple 
steps in the preceding section attest to this fact. What may take you more 
time is discovering the tips and tricks that help you achieve professional-
looking results. This section should kick-start your discovery process:
 
✦ Focus, focus: Due to the focus limitations of many of today’s digital 
cameras, I found it best to use the Cloud Dome with the extension collar 
(often sold along with the dome), which allows you to have your camera 
17 inches away from the item if you’re photographing on a flat surface.
 
✦ Get in close to your item: When attempting macro (extreme close-up) 
photography, the Cloud Dome holds your camera still while you shoot 
the picture. If you prefer, after you’ve centered your item, stand away 
and take the picture using your camera’s self-timer.

Book V
Chapter 2

Photography

Prepping and Photographing Clothing
 
✦ Find upstanding items: If your item is vertical and doesn’t lend itself 
to being photographed flat, use the Cloud Dome’s angled collar, which 
allows you to shoot the item from an angle instead of from the top.
 
✦ Keep background where it belongs: When selecting a background for 
your item, choose a contrasting background that reflects the light prop-
erly for your item. Make it a solid color; white is always safe and black 
can add dramatic highlights.
Prepping and Photographing Clothing
When photographing apparel for eBay, the one rule is: Take the best picture 
you can and move on to the next item so that you can hurry up and list all 
the items for sale. Period.
And even though I’ve just said there’s only one rule, I also know that taking 
the best picture involves a bit of preparation on your part. Figure 2-4 shows 
the results of an eBay search for the keyword dress. Which of these items 
looks better — the ones laid out on the floor or those on a mannequin or 
model? A designer dress in this search probably would have sold for twice 
the amount if it had been on a mannequin!

488
Prepping and Photographing Clothing
 
One of the worst ways to photograph clothing is on a tabletop or folded on 
the floor. The camera misses essential details in the folded items, and you 
miss the opportunity to show off the clothing in all its glory — as worn on a 
body. To get the highest bids, give your clothing an authentic, lifelike 
appearance.
 
Scanning photographs from a catalog is just as much of a copyright violation 
as stealing a picture from the manufacturer’s Web site. eBay may end your 
listing if such a violation is reported.
Apparel photography can be tricky by all measures, especially when you 
don’t have a model. Using a model is a great idea if you have plenty of time 
to spare. When you work with a model (even if it’s a son or daughter or 
a friend), you’ll have to take many shots of them wearing the same item, 
because you want the model to look as good as the clothing, and vice versa. 
Not a timesaver.
What’s the best way to shoot fashion for eBay? Assembly-line-style. Henry 
Ford had it right. Have everything assembled in one area and the process 
can go smoothly and quickly. In this section, I tell you about how to prepare 
your studio, your props, and your clothing to get the best picture for the 
least effort. And best of all, the time you spend preparing the clothes to pho-
tograph also makes them customer-ready. Now, there’s a timesaver!
Cleaning and pressing essentials
Before you photograph your clothing, make sure the clothing itself imparts 
the image you want your buyers to see. For example, remove any loose 
threads and lint that has accumulated on the fabric.
Have the following items handy to help you with the cleaning and pressing 
chores:
 
✦ Garment rack: When you unpack your merchandise from the carton 
it was shipped to you in, it can look pretty ragged. And if you’ve pur-
chased some hanging merchandise and it’s in tip-top shape, you’ll want 
to keep it that way. Hanging the merchandise on a garment rack (see 
Figure 2-5) keeps it fresh-looking so it looks great when you get ready to 
ship.
 
✦ Steamer: Retail stores, clothing manufacturers, and drycleaners all use 
steamers. Why? Because steaming the garment with a steam wand is 
kinder to the fabric and takes wrinkles out in a hurry. Steam penetrates 
the fabric (not crushing it, as does ironing) and seems to make the fabric 
look better than before.

 Steaming is also five times faster than ironing (and not as backbreaking), 
so that’s why it’s truly the professional’s choice. Steaming garments is a 
breeze; see for yourself in Figure 2-6.

Prepping and Photographing Clothing
 
 A handheld travel steamer will work for beginners who sell one or two 
apparel items a month. While you can steam a garment with a profes-
sional-style steamer in a minute or two, you might have to work on a 
garment with a travel steamer for 15 minutes. If you’re thinking about 
selling a quantity of clothes on eBay, a professional-style, roll-base 
steamer is what you should look for.
 
 I use a Jiffy Steamer that I’ve had for quite a while. (I even bought it on 
eBay and got a great deal.) It’s the same kind they use in retail stores, 
only slightly smaller.
 
✦ Dryel: A popular, reasonably priced, home dry-cleaning product you 
use in your dryer, Dryel can be used with almost any type of garment 
(be sure to double-check the packaging before you use it). After going 
through a Dryel treatment, clothes come out of the dryer sweet and 
clean. The starter kit even comes with a spot remover. You can buy 
Dryel at your local supermarket.
 
 According to eBay rules, all used clothing must be cleaned before it 
is sold on the site. Even if the vintage garment you have up for sale is 
clean, it can always benefit by a roll in the dryer with Dryel. New 
garments, too, benefit; Dryel removes any smells that have clung to the 
garment during its travels.
 
✦ Spot cleaners: I recommend that you use spot cleaners only if you know 
what you’re doing. Some really great ones out there will remove a small 
spot, but you’d best practice on items that you’re not selling first.
Keep these tips in mind when steaming the 
clothes you sell on eBay:
 ✓ Always keep the steam head in an upright 
position so that the condensation inside 
the hose drains back into the steamer.
 ✓ Run the steam head lightly down the 
fabric.
 ✓ Hang pants by the cuff when steaming.
 ✓ Don’t let the steam head come directly in 
contact with velvet or silk; otherwise you 
may spot the fabric.
 ✓ Steam velvet (or any fabric with a pile) from 
the reverse side.
 ✓ Heavy fabrics may do better by steaming 
from the underside of the fabric.
 ✓ When you’re through steaming your clothes 
for eBay, try steaming your mattresses and 
furniture. Steaming has been proven to kill 
a majority of dust mites and their accompa-
nying nastiness.

Assembling your fashion photo studio
Photographing fashion right takes a little time, but the right tools make 
the project easier. Here’s a list of some of the items you’ll need when 
photographing clothing:
 
✦ Mannequin body double: You don’t want to deal with supermodels and 
their requirements for nonfat vanilla lattes, so you have to find someone 
who will model the garments and not give you any grief. Figure 2-7 pictures 
my mannequin, Midge, who has sold lots of dresses on eBay for me.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Midge 
modeling a 
vintage fur 
(photo was 
cropped 
before 
listing).
 
 
 Full-body mannequins can be purchased on eBay for about $100. (Dress 
forms for around $50). I bought Midge from a local store that was updat-
ing their mannequins. Major department stores often liquidate their 
display merchandise in auctions, so keep your eyes peeled in your local 
newspaper for auctions of store fixtures.
 
 Keep in mind that you needn’t spend a mint on a brand-new model. If 
your mannequin is used and has a few paint chips — so what?
 
 Following are some less expensive alternatives to a mannequin:
 
• Molded body form: Before you decide to jump in with both feet, you 
might want to try using a hanging body form — a molded torso that 
has a hanger at the top. You can find molded styrene forms on eBay 
for as little as $20. If you decide to stay in the apparel-vending busi-
ness, you can always upgrade to a full-size mannequin.

492
eBay Gallery of Horrors
 
• Dressmaker’s adjustable form: You can also use a dressmaker’s 
form to model your eBay clothing. The best part about using these is 
that you can adjust the size of the body to fit your clothing. You can 
often find new or good-condition used ones on eBay for under $60.
 
✦ Vertical photo lights on stands: To light your merchandise, you’ll do 
best to invest in some floodlights. You don’t have to spend a mint, but 
as you’ll see when you start taking pictures, the little flash on your 
camera can’t accentuate the good parts of your apparel. You may want 
to stop the flash on your camera from going off altogether when you 
take pictures of clothes, because too much light coming from the front 
will wash out the detail in the fabric.
 
 Place the mannequin in the middle of your studio area. Situate a flood-
light on either side, closer to the camera than to the mannequin. Your 
setup will be a V-shape, with your mannequin at the point, your flood-
lights at the top of each V-side, and you (or a tripod) holding the camera 
in the middle at the top of the V. Adjust the distance that you place your 
lights as needed. Be sure to tilt the light heads to pick up extra detail in 
the clothing.
 
✦ Clothespins: To fit your clothing on the mannequin, use clothespins to 
take up any slack in the garment (be sure to place the clothespins where 
the camera won’t see them). Before you think I’m crazy, I’ll have you 
know that clothespins were used in almost every apparel photo-shoot 
that I’ve participated in. Think about it: The clothing you’re selling will 
come in different sizes and may not always hang right on your mannequin.

This section shows you a bunch of big-time don’ts. We’ve seen images like 
these all over eBay at one time or another.
Mistake #1
Figure 2-8 shows a nice item, but the picture suffers from two major flaws:
 
✦ A glare from the camera’s flash shows in the cellophane on the item. 
This can be avoided by turning the item slightly at an angle so that the 
flash doesn’t give off such a bright glare.
 
✦ The price sticker is smack on the front of the item. Often you’ll buy 
things for resale that have stickers. Be a pro — use a commercial 
product (see Chapter 1) to remove stickers.

Mistake #3
I never knew how much colorful upholstery people had in their homes. I’ve 
seen items photographed on plaid, floral, and striped fabrics (see Figure

I’m sure the item in the box shown in Figure 2-11 is desirable, but who can 
make that judgment without seeing the item? Take the item out of the box. 
If the box is a crucial part of the deal (as in collectibles), be sure to mention 
that the box is included in the sale.
 
If you can’t open the box without ruining the value of the item, pull in for a 
macro close-up. When you have a quantity of the item, bite the bullet and 
open one up. A good picture gets you higher bids, and perhaps that loss of 
one item will be made up by the higher bids on the sales with good pictures.

Mistake #5
Can you say close-up? Use the zoom on your camera to fill the frame with a full 
picture of your item. Draw your camera close to the item so the prospective 
customer can see some detail. Don’t take a wide picture of the area around the 
item, like the shot shown in Figure 2-12. Don’t just rely on cropping the picture 
in an image-editing program; that only makes the image smaller.

I
must admit, the very thought of using HTML in my auctions used to ter-
rify me (pinky-swear you won’t tell the people at eBay). HTML. Doesn’t 
it sound so high-tech and geeklike? But HTML isn’t all that scary after you 
realize that it’s just a fancy name for HyperText Markup Language, an easy-
to-use language for creating online content. All you need to know is the 
markup part.
HTML uses tags to mark pages to include elements such as text and graph-
ics in a way that Web browsers understand. A Web browser sees the tags, 
and knows how to display the document (that is, the Web page). HTML also 
makes possible the whole work of links. When you click a link, you jump to 
another place: another Web page, document, or file, for example.
Luckily, you don’t have to know a lot of code to produce eBay auctions. 
My small grasp of HTML gets me only so far, so I usually use SeaMonkey to 
produce code for my Web site or eBay listings. I’ve developed my own tem-
plates so that all I have to do is replace the text with each new listing. This 
chapter shows you how to do that, too.
In addition, the Sell an Item form has an excellent (but basic) HTML genera-
tor that you use like a word processor to format text. I show you how to 
make this convenient tool do magic with your listings.

Writing Good Descriptions
Writing Good Descriptions
Many eBay sellers somehow think that putting dancing bears, flaming 
graphics, and background music in their auctions will bring in more bids. 
Unfortunately, that’s pretty far from the truth. People go to your auctions to 
find information and a great deal on something they want, not to be enter-
tained. They need to see the facts, placed cleanly and neatly on the page. 
The addition of music to your auction may cause another problem: An 
extremely s-l-o-o-o-o-w page load for those with dial-up connections. If loading 
your page takes too long, believe me, most people will go to another listing.
So what should you do to attract buyers? I spent most of my career in 
the advertising business, and the byword of good advertising is, “Keep it 
simple!” An organized and well-written selling description will outsell danc-
ing bears and pictures of your children every time.
 
When you write the descriptions for your auctions, be sure that you 
describe your items clearly and completely. Mention everything about the 
item; be honest and even mention flaws or damage. When you’re honest up 
front, you’ll have a happy bidder. Remember to include your terms of sale 
and specify what type of payments and credit cards you accept. Be sure to 
include your shipping charges, too. 
After you list all the facts, get excited and add a little flowery text in your 
description. Think infomercial! Think Shopping Channel! Whoopee! They 
make things sound so good that you feel that you must have whatever item 
they’re selling. You can do the same, if you just take the time. In Book III, 
Chapter 3, I give you basic pointers on writing the best auction descriptions 
possible.
HTML the Easy eBay Way
Luckily, you don’t have to know a lot of code to produce eBay auctions. The 
Sell an Item form has an excellent (but basic) HTML generator that has fea-
tures similar to a word processor, as shown at the top of Figure 3-1 (where 
you see ’em just below the Standard and HTML tabs). 
To apply any of these features (such as bold or italic) to your text, you 
simply highlight the text and click one of the buttons.
 
When inputting text, you may notice that eBay’s tool inserts a line space 
after text when you start a new paragraph. If you want the text to wrap (as in 
the headline of Figure 3-1) and not have a blank space between text lines, 
hold down the Shift key while you press the Enter (or Return) key. That 
forces an HTML line break instead of a paragraph break.

Starting at the top left in Figure 3-1, you see three drop-down lists. Click to 
the right of each box and the following options appear:
 
✦ Font name: Apply different fonts to your text. Play around with the dif-
ferent fonts to see which ones you prefer. Figure 3-2 shows you the fonts 
from which you can choose.

✦ Size: You can increase or decrease the size of the type. It reads in num-
bers, or point size. The smallest is 8-point and the largest is 36-point.
 
✦ Color: Want to add some color to your text? Just highlight the text and 
select black, blue, red, green, yellow, or brown from the plethora of 
colors available.
After these three drop-down lists, you see a row of buttons:
 
 
✦ Boldface text
 
 
✦ Italicize text
 
 
✦ Underline text

your text that eBay created based on your seller’s profile.

To add an insert to your description, simply place your cursor where you’d

You can even create custom inserts up to 4000 characters! Create inserts 
for frequently used text, such as promotional messages, custom policies, or 
warranty information. Just follow these steps:

When you want to dress up your auctions, you could use one of eBay’s 
graphic themes. (That would add an additional $.10 to your listing fee.) Or 
you could insert your own graphics into your listing, and it wouldn’t 
cost you any extra fees. But even if you use one of eBay’s lovely graphic 
designs, you still need to format your text. That’s where HTML coding 
comes in. 
 
You can also use HTML to insert multiple pictures into your descriptions to 
better promote your item. This won’t cost you extra, and you can still use the 
one free photo from eBay’s Picture Services for your top-of-listing picture. For 
information on how to upload your images to a server, see Chapter 5.

What HTML can do
Take a look at Figure 3-5. It contains an auction description I typed in the 
Notepad program (which you can find under Windows Accessories).
 
Figure 3-5: 
Raw auction 
text in 
Notepad.
 
If I add some appropriate HTML coding to the file, the auction page looks a 
whole lot different, as you can see in Figure 3-6. Pretty cool, huh? 
How HTML works
HTML uses a series of codes to indicate display information to a browser, 
such as when text should be bold or italic or when text is actually a link. 
Brackets are used to indicate commands. What’s within the brackets is an 
instruction rather than actual text; only the text of your description will 
appear on your page.
In the example that follows, the b and i in brackets indicate that text 
between them should be formatted bold and italic, respectively. Notice that 
there is both a start formatting and end formatting indication (<b> starts 
bold formatting and </b> ends it.) Here’s one example:
HTML start and end tags: <b><i></i></b> 
Tags with text between them: <b><i>eBay tools</i></b> 
The resulting text on your page: eBay tools

Table 3-1 lists many common HTML tags to get you started. Keep in mind 
that HTML is not case-sensitive, so feel free to leave your Caps Lock on if it 
makes you happy. But if you want to stay compatible with XHTML (the new 
standard for all kinds of devices), start getting in the habit of using lower-
case for your tags.

A few things to keep in mind about HTML:
 
✦ Don’t worry about pressing Enter at the end of a line. You must use a 
command to go to the next line, so pressing Enter on your keyboard has 
no effect on what the page looks like.
 
✦ Most HTML coding has a beginning and an end. The beginning code is in 
angle brackets. To end the formatting, you repeat the code in brackets, 
only this time with a slash to end the command </>.
 
✦ It’s not necessary to put the paragraph command at the beginning and 
at the end of the paragraph. This is one command that doesn’t need a 
close. Just put the command, <p>, where you want the breaking space. 
This applies also for a horizontal rule, <hr>. Just place the command 
where you want the line and it will appear.

506
Getting Friendly with HTML
 
✦ People have different fonts set up on their computers, so they may not 
have the funky font you want to display. Be sure to list alternate fonts 
for your text. If you don’t, different browsers may substitute other fonts 
that might look really funky on some readers’ pages!

Add Pictures to Your Listing for Free 
“How do I put pictures in my auction description?” Here’s the answer to the 
question I’m asked most when I teach a class on eBay. Many sellers have 
more than one picture within the auction description area. By putting extra 
images in the description, they don’t have to pay extra for eBay’s hosting 
services. This isn’t magic; you can do it too. Just add a tiny bit of HTML code 
in your auction description. Don’t freak out on me now, you can do this. 
Here is the HTML code to insert one picture in your auction:
<img src=http://www.yourserver.com/imagename.jpg>
Be sure to use the angle brackets (they’re located above the comma and the 
period on your keyboard) to open and close your code. 
When you want to insert two pictures, just insert code for each picture, one 
after the other. If you want one picture to appear below the other, use the 
HTML code for line break, <BR>. Here’s how to write that:
<img src=http://www.yourserver.com/imagename1.jpg> <BR>
<img src=http://www.yourserver.com/imagename2.jpg>
Using HTML Table Codes to Make Templates
Have you ever noticed how some people manage to have a photo on both 
the right or the left sides of their descriptions? It’s not that difficult to do. 
You add a little HTML code to the listing using a feature called tables. 
For example, Figure 3-7 shows a picture contained in a table on the left side 
of the description. (By the way, when the full version of this auction ran on 
eBay, with the kind cooperation of the people on The View, we raised more 
than $1000 for UNICEF!)

After you get the hang of it, tables aren’t so scary. As a matter of fact, if you 
want to use my templates for your listings, be my guest!
Creating Your Own HTML Template
Once you’re ready to take on eBay in earnest, it really helps to have a few 
auction-description templates all set up and ready to go. This is what the 
big guys, those top sellers on eBay, do (granted, some do a better job than 
others). Although it’s fun to play around with using different graphics as you 
sell on eBay — and I must admit, I’ve seen some cute ones — having a stan-
dard look to your ads establishes you as a serious, professional seller. After 
all, how often does eBay change its look? The answer is, not too often. The 
colors and the basic look remain the same because this is eBay’s (very valu-
able) brand.
What might go into a template? Well, you can insert your logo within your 
description, or put links to your About Me page or your store, for example. 
Your template can become your brand. Many auction-management services 
offer predesigned templates for your descriptions, but they often charge a 
lot of money for their services. Alternately, you can put together your own 
template, and update it occasionally. 
 
Keeping your look simple and showing off your product will bring in high 
bids. Getting carried away with graphics that have nothing to do with your 
item is distracting (unless you have a cute picture of your dog or cat — 
everyone likes a fluffy mascot).
In this section, I show you how to design simple templates using SeaMonkey. 
It’s a great free software suite that grows with you. I use it for the Composer 
module (a WYSIWYG — What You See Is What You Get — HTML editor). The 
more HTML you understand, the more you can do with Composer. In the 
next section, you use an HTML generator on my Web site to create a tem-
plate that you can customize with a little extra knowledge of HTML.
Downloading SeaMonkey
Few things in this life are absolute necessities, but photos in your eBay list-
ings definitely are! It’s a good idea to begin developing templates by building 
a simple one that includes a space for a photo.

510
Creating Your Own HTML Template
Because I like to use what the Internet offers for free . . . I use a Mozilla pro-
gram called SeaMonkey Composer to do just that.
SeaMonkey is a free, fully functional Windows or MAC Internet suite from 
Mozilla (the same folks who brought to you Firefox). It consists of a Web 
browser, an e-mail and news-client program, and an HTML editor. In other 
words, you can get all these programs in one. Many people enjoy replacing 
their Internet Explorer or Firefox with the feature-rich, faster, less-memory-
hogging SeaMonkey. I use it because I like HTML Composer. 
You can download the free suite at
www.seamonkey-project.org
Since SeaMonkey is a suite (meaning it has several programs all in one), 
you decide which program you want to run when you click the SeaMonkey 
icon. If you just want to use the HTML Composer (as I do), take the following 
steps:
 
1. After downloading the software, open it by double-clicking the 
SeaMonkey icon.
 
 You might just want to play with its superfast Web browser and maybe 
get a feel for its other features… but right now? I’m using the Composer. 
 
2. Click the Edit link in the toolbar.
 
3. Select Preferences and then Appearance.
 
 On the Appearance page, you can indicate which program you would 
like to see when you open the suite.
 
4. Put a check mark next to Composer and click OK.
 
 The next time you click the SeaMonkey icon, the Composer will open.
Adding text and graphics
After you open SeaMonkey Composer, you’ll see that it looks like an eBay or 
Word page layout, but it has far more features.
The most important for you to see are the four tabs at the bottom of the 
screen. These tabs enable you to view your template in several ways:
 
✦ Normal. This is your standard design mode, where you can highlight 
text — change it or color it — and add pictures or tables, as shown in 
Figure 3-8.
 
✦ HTML Tags. This view shows you your template with the symbols of the 
tags you have created. Check out Figure 3-9.

✦ HTML Source. Figure 3-10 shows the raw HTML code that you see when 
you click the Source tab. From this view, you can save the template to 
your hard drive and change the text at will through the Normal tab.
 
✦ Preview. This tab displays your work pretty much the same as the 
Normal setting, but it’s good to double check that everything is perfect 
before you save it.

In the following steps, you create a table that contains a photo on the left 
and text on the right:
 
1. Click the Table button on the toolbar or choose Tools➪Insert Table.
 
 An Insert Table screen appears..
 
2. If you want a photo next to your text, indicate 1 row with 2 columns, 
as in Figure 3-11. 
 
 This creates a table with two cells side-by-side.

then click the Image button on the toolbar. 
 
 (The Image button looks like a little picture.) The Image Tag dialog box 
appears. 
 
5. In the Image Properties box, type the Internet address (URL) where 
your image is stored. 
 
 You can get the URL from your image hosting service, website or by 
locating the image on the Internet and copying the URL from the top of 
your browser. If you want to alter the size of your image, you can also 
type the width or height (or both), in pixels, in the Dimensions boxes. 
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The HTML code for the image appears inside the text area.
 
7. Click the Row 1 Cell 2 on your screen, and enter the description text 
you want to appear next to the picture.
 
 For convenience, you can also open an auction description you’ve 
already written in Windows Notepad, and copy and paste it into the 
space.

mammoth paragraph.

make it look better — you can add HTML text attributes as follows:
 
1. Highlight the text you want to change.
 
2. Click the button on the toolbar for the text formatting style you want 
to apply. 
 
 The B button is for bold, I is for italic, and U is for underline. The format-
ting is applied automatically.
After some final tweaking, the final auction description looks like Figure 3-14. 
Choose File➪Save to save your HTML when you’re happy with the results. 
When you’re ready to use that auction description, just open the file, copy 
the code, and paste it into the eBay auction description area (be sure you’re 
typing in the area under the HTML tab) for the appropriate item.

Chapter 4: Getting Your 
Photos Ready for eBay
In This Chapter
✓ Getting the photo’s file size right
✓ Considering edits to your photo
✓ Touching up your photo
I
n this chapter, I show you how fast you can get the photos you take — or 
the scans you make — spruced up for eBay. No eBay seller should spend 
hours playing with and perfecting images for eBay listings (although some 
do). One pass through a simple image-editing software program gets any 
reasonable picture Internet-ready.
Then, after your pictures are, well, picture-perfect, look to Chapter 5 for 
some easy ways to upload your images to the Web.
Size Matters
The prime concern to have about the pictures you put on eBay is size — 
that’s right, in this case, size does matter. You need to limit the picture 
file size so you don’t bog down the prospective buyer’s viewing of your 
item page (especially if you’re using multiple pictures in the item descrip-
tion). Why? That’s easy. The larger your item’s picture files, the longer the 
browser takes to load the item page. And four out of five eBay users will 
click back out of a listing to avoid a long page load. (I’m guessing that you 
don’t want your listings to elicit that behavior.)
To get a better idea of the size for the images you use online, remember that 
no matter which camera setting you choose, your image should be designed 
to be viewed on a monitor. Low resolution is just fine because the average 
computer monitor isn’t an HDTV.
The average monitor resolution settings (in pixels) are
 
✦ 640 x 480 (VGA)
  
✦ 800 x 600 (Super VGA)
 
✦ 1024 x 768 (XVGA)

520
Size Matters
These settings determine the number of pixels that can be viewed on the 
screen. No matter how large your monitor is (whether 15, 17, or even 21 
inches), it shows only as many pixels as you determine in its settings. On 
larger screens, the pixels just get larger — and make your pictures fuzzy. 
That’s why most people with larger screens set their monitors for a higher 
resolution.
Remember that scanned images are measured in dpi (dots per inch). The 
average monitor displays scanned images at 72 dpi. Do not confuse this with 
pixel size.
 
Lots of people are checking eBay on their cell phones, and although they 
have higher resolution, the high-end iPhone is only 480-by-320-pixel resolu-
tion at 163 pixels per inch. Because higher resolutions make the screen 
images smaller, many users prefer their screens at the 800 x 600 size for eye 
comfort. They don’t want to squint!
If you use eBay’s Picture Services for your all eBay items, setting your image 
size is not a big issue. eBay Picture Services applies a compression algo-
rithm that forces your pictures into eBay’s prescribed size.
 
The more compression put into computer images, the less sharp they 
appear. So you might as well use your camera or image-editing program to 
set your images to a monitor-friendly size before uploading them.
Here’s a checklist of tried-and-true techniques for preparing elegantly slen-
der, fast-loading images to display on eBay:
 
✦ Set your image resolution at 72 pixels per inch. You can do this with 
the settings for your scanner. Although 72 ppi may seem like a super-low 
resolution, it only nibbles computer memory, shows up fast on a buyer’s 
screen, and looks great on eBay.
 
✦ When using a digital camera, set the camera to no higher than the 640 
x 480 format. That’s custom made for a VGA monitor. You can always 
crop the picture if it’s too large. You can even save the image at 320 x 
240. It will display well on eBay but take up less space, so you can add 
more pictures!
 
✦ Make the finished image no larger than 480 pixels wide. When you 
size your picture in your image software, it’s best to keep it no larger 
than 300 x 300 pixels or 4 inches square. These dimensions are big 
enough for people to see the image without squinting, and the details of 
your item show up nicely.

Book V
Chapter 4
Getting Your Photos 
Ready for eBay
521
Adding the Artist’s Touch
 
✦ Crop any unnecessary areas of the photo. You need to show only your 
item; everything else is a waste.
 
✦ Use your software to darken or change the photo’s contrast. When the 
image looks good on your computer screen, the image looks good on 
your eBay auction page.
 
✦ Save your image as a JPG file. When you finish editing your picture, 
save it as a JPG file. (To do this, follow the instructions that come with 
your software.) JPG is the best format for eBay; it compresses infor-
mation into a small file that builds fast and reproduces nicely on the 
Internet.
 
✦ Check the total size of your image. After you save the image, check its 
total size. If the size hovers around 40K or smaller, eBay users won’t 
have a hard time seeing the image in a reasonable amount of time.
 
✦ If your image is larger than 50K, reduce it. Small is fast, efficient, and 
beautiful. Big is slow, sluggish, and dangerous to your sales. Impatient 
eBay users will move on to the next listing if they have to wait to see your 
image — or (worse) it will lose quality during eBay’s image conversion.
Adding the Artist’s Touch
Pictures don’t always come out of the camera in perfect form. However, you 
can do a few tweaks to bring them into perfection range:
 
✦ Alter the size: Reduce or increase the size or shape of the image.
 
✦ Change the orientation: Rotate the image left or right; flip it horizontally 
or vertically.
 
✦ Crop the background: Sometimes there’s a little too much background 
and not enough product. Don’t waste precious bandwidth on extraneous 
pixels. To crop your image means to cut away the unnecessary part of 
the picture.
 
✦ Adjust the brightness and contrast: These two functions usually work 
together in most photo programs. By giving your picture more bright-
ness, the picture looks brighter (duh). Raising contrast brings out the 
detail, and lowering it dulls the difference between light and dark.
 
✦ Sharpen: If your camera was not perfectly in focus when you took the 
picture, applying a photo-editing program’s sharpening feature can help. 
If you sharpen too much, however, you can destroy the smoothness of 
the image.
If your image needs any more help than these alterations, it’s probably 
easier and faster to just retake the picture.

522
Image-Editing Software
Image-Editing Software
eBay sellers use a wide array of image-editing software. As a matter of fact, 
some listing software has built-in mini-editing capabilities. (See Book VIII for 
more on third-party software for eBay.) Choosing software for your images 
is like choosing an office chair. What’s right for some people is dreadful for 
others. You might want to ask some of your friends what they use — and 
take a look at it.
When you buy a camera, it will no doubt arrive with a CD that includes some 
type of image-editing software. Give the software a try. If it works well for 
you, keep it. If not, check out the two options I mention later.
 
Every image-editing software program has its own system requirements and 
capabilities. Study the software that comes with your camera or scanner. If 
you feel that the program is too complicated (or doesn’t give you the editing 
tools you need), investigate some of the other popular programs. You can 
get some excellent shareware (software that you can try before you buy) at 
www.tucows.com and www.shareware.com.
I used to be happy using Photoshop, but it’s a large and expensive program. 
It’s also a bit of overkill for eBay images. Two other new tools have caught 
my eye: LunaPic and Fast Photos.
Perfecting your picture in LunaPic
You need to know that I am lazy. When it comes to editing my images for 
eBay, I’m still looking for a magic wand. Sometimes I’m too lazy to open a 
program. So in my laziness, I browsed the Internet and found a free online 
photo-editing Web site, www.lunapic.com.
Although I prefer to use a program on my computer, LunaPic works great 
for quick, on-the-fly editing that I often need. You can even edit pictures on 
someone else’s computer because there’s no need to install software. Take 
a look at Figure 4-1. Here’s LunaPic, a Web site that makes photo editing as 
easy as getting a burger at the drive through window. 
Register on the site, and you have full photo-editing capabilities. Upload 
photos from your computer (or webcam) to the site, perform your touch-up, 
and then save and download! LunaPic has a full-featured toolset on the site; 
in it, you find tools to adjust brightness, contrast, and color, and to sharpen 
your images — and many more.

Quick touchup and FTP in Fast Photos
If PhotoShop is too expensive and complex (it really is for eBay purposes), 
you might be happy giving Fast Photos by Pixby Software a try. It’s a simple, 
all-in-one photo-editing program designed especially for e-commerce and 
eBay sellers. The developer of the software knew exactly what processes 
online sellers need for their images and included just those — and nothing 
else. There are tools for cropping, JPEG compression, sharpening, resizing, 
enhancing, rotating, and adding watermark text and borders.
The software is a PC application that runs on Windows XP, 2000, ME, and 98 
SE. For a 21-day free trial, visit their Web site at
www.pixby.com/marshacollier
 
I said that Fast Photos is all-in-one because it not only allows you to touch up 
your images quickly, but also has a built-in FTP program so that you can 
upload your images immediately after editing them.

524
Image-Editing Software
Editing an image for eBay in Fast Photos is simple:
 
1. Open the program.
 
2. Click Browse and find the directory containing your image.
 
3. Find the photo, click it (see Figure 4-2), and then click the Add to Tray 
button (near the top of the screen).
 
4. Choose Edit.
 
5. Click to perform any of the following tasks, as shown in Figure 4-3:
Microsoft Office Picture Manager is a soft-
ware program included with Microsoft 
Office suite starting with the 2003 edition. (It 
replaced Microsoft Photo Editor, which had 
been included with the Microsoft Office suite 
since Office 97). Picture Manager offers basic 
picture-editing features, and it may be a good 
place to start. If you have Microsoft Office, you 
find Picture Manager on your Start menu under 
Microsoft Office Tools. 
Microsoft Office Picture Manager gives you 
some basic tools: You can auto-correct, fix 
“red eye,” compress, resize, crop, and rotate. 
It’s all pretty basic, but if all you want to do is 
fix the colors and reduce the photo size before 
uploading the image to eBay, it may be all you 
need. Clicking the Auto Correct command 
works well to correct the quality of an image. 
Select the Export task pane, and you can 
choose the exact size for the final image.

• Rotate: If you’ve shot your picture sideways or upside-down, you can 
rotate it here.
 
• Crop: In Crop mode, a gray rectangle appears with corner dots. Click 
a corner dot, drag the rectangle until it closes in on your item, and 
then click Apply.
 
• Enhance: Brighten, darken, increase, or decrease the contrast and 
work with image gamma and color. Don’t worry — everything you do 
is visible on-screen and can be undone if you mess things up.
 
• Resize: You can resize your image to the standard eBay sizes or 
make the image a custom size.
 
• Sharpen: Is your image a little fuzzy? Click here to bring out the 
details.
 
• Add border: If you want a border or a drop shadow on your image, 
you can apply it here.
 
• Add text: Type your user ID so you can watermark your images 
(which helps dissuade those who try to use your images as their 
own).
 
• JPEG compress: By moving a sliding bar, you can compress the 
image as much as you dare. The more you compress, the less 
detailed the image will be. 
 
6. To save the changes you’ve made to your image, click Save As and 
give your file a name.
Now you can upload your newly edited image to the Web. Just choose 
Publish (on the toolbar).
To set up an FTP account for uploading, click the Add button on the Publish 
screen. The screen shown in Figure 4-4 appears. Input the data required for 
your FTP server, click OK, and then upload your image with a mouse click.
As I write this, the developer is adding a batch mode to the program so you 
can edit and upload entire groups of images at once. Check out Chapter 5 for 
more information on uploading your images.

In This Chapter
✓ Finding an online home
✓ Taking advantage of Picture Services

✓ Sending images to AOL
✓ Subscribing to Picture Manager
A
fter you get your image perfect (following the suggestions in Chapter 
4), it’s time to emblazon it on your auction for all the world to see. 
When most people first get the urge to dazzle prospective buyers with a 
picture, they poke around the eBay site looking for a place to put it. Trade 
secret: You’re not actually putting pictures on eBay; you’re telling eBay’s 
servers where to find your picture so that, like a good hunting dog, your 
auction points the buyers’ browsers to the exact corner of the virtual uni-
verse where your picture is. That’s why the picture has to load fast — it’s 
coming in from a different location. (Yeah, it confused me in the beginning 
too, but now it makes perfect sense. Uh-huh. Sure.)
Finding a Home for Your Pictures
Because your image needs an address, you have to find it a good home 
online. You have several options:
 
✦ Your ISP (Internet service provider): All the big ISPs — AOL, AT&T, 
Road Runner, and Earthlink — give you space to store your Internet 
stuff. You’re already paying for an ISP, so you can park pictures there at 
no extra charge.
 
✦ An image-hosting Web site: Web sites that specialize in hosting pic-
tures are popping up all over the Internet. Some charge a small fee; 
others are free. The upside here is that they’re easy to use.
 
✦ Your server: If you have your own server (those of you who do, well, 
you know who you are), you can store those images in your own home.

530
Using eBay’s Picture Services
 
✦ eBay Picture Services and Picture Manager: These are eBay-based 
tools that host your photo on eBay’s servers for a fee. (You may upload 
one image per listing at no charge.)
To most users, uploading pictures to their own Web spaces at their ISP 
remains a mystery. Many users are still convinced that they have to pay for 
an image-hosting service — but that’s rarely the case these days.
Using eBay’s Picture Services
 
I highly recommend that your first move be to take advantage of the one free 
picture per listing from eBay’s Picture Services. First, it’s available at no 
charge; second, Picture Services offers many other benefits.
At this point, I’ll go back to my basic assumptions about you. I assume you 
know how to list an item on eBay — or at the very least, you can make your 
way through the Sell an Item form and get to the Add Pictures step.
Once you arrive there, you need to upload a picture to eBay, whether or not 
you have pictures in your description. Why? Because the first picture is free 
(and why turn down anything free?), and because your uploaded picture 
becomes part of the ultra-important top area of the item page, as shown in 
Figure 5-1. This picture will also be the default for use as your all-important 
gallery image.

Using eBay’s Picture Services
Have you ever noticed that some items that you browse on eBay do not have 
this crucial picture at the top? That’s a shame, because these sellers are not 
availing themselves of eBay’s Picture Services and they’re losing sales as a 
result. Having that picture at the top of the page is a first-rate way to pull a 
buyer into your listing. (And did I mention that it’s free?)
I suggest that you use eBay Picture Services for your primary image but 
host other images of the item elsewhere. Why? Because the quality of your 
photos is better if you host them directly from a site. Really clear pictures 
on Picture Services are few and far between. Picture Services reformats 
your photo to fit in a layout 400 pixels wide by 300 pixels tall, and then com-
presses the file for quick viewing. This process can destroy the quality of 
your carefully photographed images if you haven’t saved them in a compat-
ible size. You’re running a business, so be businesslike and use the method 
that presents your photos in their best light.
Uploading your picture
In this section, I assume that you’ve already taken a picture, uploaded or 
scanned it, and saved it somewhere on your computer’s hard drive.
 
For organization’s sake, you might consider making a subfolder in your My 
Pictures directory called eBay Photos. That way you can always find your 
eBay pictures quickly, without searching through photos of your family 
reunion.
eBay offers two versions of Picture Services. The basic version, which is 
shown in Figure 5-2, allows you to upload eBay-ready images as they appear 
on your computer. If you want to rotate or crop the picture, you need 
Enhanced Picture Services. You’ll be using the advanced version in the steps 
that follow.

532
Using eBay’s Picture Services
When you reach the part of the Sell an Item form that allows you to add 
pictures, does the screen look like Figure 5-2? If you’re using Microsoft’s 
Internet Explorer browser (the only one supported now), scroll down and 
click the Add or Remove Options link. 
Clicking the Add or Remove Options link causes a window to pop up, as 
in Figure 5-3. Click the box next to Show eBay Enhanced Picture Services 
Options. (Also, why not click the Host Pictures on Your Server Instead of 
eBay Servers option in case you want to use that in the future?) Click Save.

If you’ve never used eBay’s Enhanced Picture Services before, a Windows 
security warning pops up, asking your permission to install a small program 
on your computer, as shown in Figure 5-4. This is safe (and the only way you 
can use eBay’s Enhanced Picture Services features), so click Install.

Then, to upload your picture, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Enhanced Picture Services screen (refer to Figure 5-3), click the 
Add Pictures button.
 
 A window pops up, prompting you to open an image file on your 
computer.
 
2. Navigate to the directory that holds your eBay images on your 
computer.
 
3. Click the image in the browsing window.
 
 The image name appears in the filename box.
 
4. Click the Open box.
 
 The selected image appears in the picture frame.
 
5. To rotate the image, click the circular arrow (at the upper right of the 
main image box).
 
6. To crop the image:
 
a. Click the crop box in the right corner of the larger image.
 
 Two squares appear at opposite corners of your main image.
 
b. Click the frame on the outside of your image, and move the bar until 
the offensive area is cropped out.
 
 You can do this from the sides, top, and bottom of the picture.
 
7. When you’re finished, click Continue.
 
 A pop-up window notifies you that your picture is being uploaded to 
eBay’s picture server.

534
Using eBay’s Picture Services
Sometimes Picture Services will shrink your image to a too-small size, but 
you can’t do much about it. Just be sure to reload the image any time you 
relist the item; otherwise the gallery image may just get smaller and smaller. 
eBay continues to improve Picture Services, so don’t give up on it. Use it for 
the free image, and be sure to upload secondary images from an outside site.
 
If you accidentally select the wrong picture, click the X in the lower-left 
corner to make the picture disappear so you can select a different one.
Understanding the costs
You may notice that you have the option to upload more pictures. eBay 
charges for the additional images (see Table 5-1). You can include more 
images at no extra cost by uploading them from a server (more on that 
later).

Using Your Free ISP Space
In this section, I show you some easy ways to upload your pictures to your 
Web site or to your ISP’s Web space. Doing so means you don’t incur extra 
fees from eBay for including multiple pictures in your listings.
Everyone who connects to the Internet from his or her computer has an 
Internet service provider, or ISP. You pay this company a monthly fee for the 
privilege of hooking up to the Internet using their servers. AT&T Worldnet, 
Earthlink, Road Runner, AOL, or a local provider in your area are examples 
of ISPs.
 
Many ISPs give you a minimum of 5 MB of space to put a personal home 
page on the Internet. You can usually store your images for your eBay sales 
there — unless your provider has some strict rules about not doing that (it’s 
a good idea to check first).
Internet providers may supply you with an image upload area, but they may 
require you to use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to upload your images. You 
may be able to find a free or shareware (requiring a small fee) FTP program 
on sites such as the following:
 
✦ www.tucows.com
 
✦ www.download.com (formerly cNet)
 
✦ www.shareware.com
 
If you use the Fast Photos image-editing program (described in Chapter 4), 
you get an FTP program as part of the software at no extra charge!
 
I’ve been using the Firefox browser and I really like it. It has a free FTP pro-
gram, FireFTP, that’s reliable and easy to use. FireFTP has never given me a 
whit of a problem, and I highly recommend it.
You can add FireFTP to your Firefox browser (MAC or PD) by visiting
fireftp.mozdev.org/

536
Using Your Free ISP Space
After you install the program, open it and follow these steps to upload a file 
to your ISP server:
 
1. Click Manage Accounts ➪New.
 
 The Account Manager appears.
 
2. Type in the name of your ISP in the Account Name box.
 
3. Where prompted, type the FTP address for your ISP account and then 
click Next.
 
4. Type the user name and password that you use to log in to your 
Internet account. Then click OK.
 
5. Click the Browse button (shown in Figure 5-6) to locate the directory 
on your computer where you store your eBay images.
 
6. Click OK, and you’re good to go.
 
Figure 5-6:

your default 
directory.
 
From this point on, every time you click the Connect button, FireFTP logs 
on to your Web space and displays the screen shown in Figure 5-7. Note 
that the left side of the program is open to the directory you selected as the 
default for your eBay images. The right side of the screen shows what is cur-
rently on your ISP-provided home page.
To upload an image, highlight it and click the transfer arrow in the center. 
Faster than I could take a screen shot (okay, I took it anyway, and it’s Figure 
5-8), the image is uploaded to my Web space!

Uploading Images to AOL
AOL handles image uploads a bit differently from other ISPs. (But those of 
you on AOL knew that already.) Many people love AOL because it provides 
an easy, step-by-step interface. As you probably imagine, uploading pictures 
is handled in that same AOL style.
To upload pictures to AOL, follow these steps:
 
1. Sign on to your AOL account.
 
2. Display the FTP area of AOL.
 
 Search keywords for ftp-click go by typing it in the text line. On 
the next page, click members ftp space. Then double-click members.
aol.com.
 
3. Click See My FTP Space.
 
 You’re sent to your AOL storage area.
 
4. Click Upload.
 
 A screen appears so you can name the file you want to upload, called 
the remote file.
 
5. In the Remote Filename box (see Figure 5-9), enter a name for your 
picture.
 
 Use all lowercase letters and no more than eight characters.
 
6. Click Continue.
 
 A window opens so that you can locate the file on your computer, as 
shown in Figure 5-10.
 
7. Locate the file, click its filename, and then click Open.
 
 Your file will whiz through the wires to the server at AOL, as shown in 
Figure 5-11.
You can now double-check that your file arrived safely by typing its URL in 
your browser as follows, and pressing Enter:
http://members.aol.com/yourscreenname/picturename.jpg
You use the URL when you insert the picture into your eBay item descrip-
tion, as follows:
<img src= http://members.aol.com/yourscreenname/picturename.

Using eBay’s Picture Manager
If you really can’t find a place to host your own pictures, you can store them 
with eBay’s Picture Manager. Go to your My eBay page, and click the Picture 
Manager link. The screen shown in Figure 5-12 appears.
 
Figure 5-12:

Picture 
Manager.
 
In the Picture Manager, you see any pictures you have uploaded, plus four 
buttons:
 
✦ Add/Upload: Click this button to display the basic uploader. (More on 
the basic and full-featured uploaders in a minute.)
 
✦ Web Links: When you put a check mark in the corner of one of the 
images and click the Web Links button, you are presented with the 
HTML code to copy and paste into your auction description. Should 
eBay decide to give you only the URL of the picture, be sure to write it in 
HTML code, as shown in Figure 5-13. 
 
 Standard: 400 x 300 (bottom of the page size)
 
 Header: 200 x 150 (header image size)
 
 Thumbnail: 96 x 72 (gallery size)
 
✦ Move: Move a picture into another folder.
 
✦ Rename: If you don’t like the name your camera gave the picture, you 
can rename the image here.
Two upload screens are available: basic and full-featured. The basic 
uploader screen appears when you click the Add/Upload button on the 
Picture Manager screen. The basic screen uploads your pictures one at a 
time, as in the basic Picture Services.

To see the full-featured uploader, click the Try the Faster Full-Featured 
Uploader for Free! link on the basic uploader screen. The full-featured ver-
sion works the same way as the advanced version of Picture Services.
 
 In the Upload window, you have a few additional options:
 
• Optimal picture size: Remember that eBay optimizes your pictures 
for faster display, which may affect the quality of the image. You can 
have eBay upload a copy of your original picture along with the opti-
mized version.
 
• Picture watermark: You can add a watermark with your user ID (up 
to 24 characters) or the eBay Picture Services logo. The watermark 
makes it more difficult for someone to lift your auction images.
 
• Upload to: If you set up separate folders in Picture Manager, you may 
select the folder you want to upload your images to.
If you have an eBay store, you get 1 MB of storage space for free. That’s 
enough for about 40 pictures! If you don’t have a store, you have to pay a fee 
to use this service. See Table 5-2 for eBay’s current charges for this service.

Chapter 1: Developing 
Your Web Site
In This Chapter
✓ Finding free Web space
✓ Choosing a host
✓ Deciding on the perfect name
✓ Registering the perfect name
Your eBay store is important to your business, but it doesn’t replace an 
e-commerce Web site. You should establish your own presence on the 
Web. And although you should link your site to eBay, don’t miss out on the 
rest of the Internet population.
You don’t have a Web site yet? The Web has so many sites with pictures of 
people’s dogs and kids that I just assumed you had your own site, too. The 
space for a Web site comes free from your ISP (I even have an embarrassing 
one with family pictures). One of these sites can be the practice site for your 
business. Take down pictures of the baby, and have a page to post pictures 
(and links) to items you’re selling.
You do have a Web site? Have you taken a good look at it lately to see 
whether it’s up to date? (I just looked at mine — ugh.) Does it link to your 
eBay auctions, eBay store, and your gallery?
Whether or not you have a Web site, this chapter has something for you. I 
provide a lot of detail about Web sites, from thinking up a name to choos-
ing a host. If you don’t have a site, I get you started launching one. If you 
already have a site, read the pointers about finding the best host. For the 
serious-minded Web-based entrepreneur (that’s you), I also include some 
important marketing tips.

Free Web Space — a Good Place to Start
Free Web Space — a Good Place to Start
Although I love the word free, in real life it seems like nothing is really free. 
Free generally means something won’t cost you too much money — but may 
cost you a bit more in time. When your site is free, you can’t have your own 
direct URL (Universal Resource Locator) or domain name. Most likely, a free 
Web site has an address such as one of the following:
www.netcom.com/~marshac
home.socal.rr.com/marshac
members.aol.com/membername
Having some kind of site at least gives you experience in setting one up. 
When you’re ready to jump in for real, you can always use your free site as 
an extension of your main business site.
When you signed up for Internet access, you had to sign on with an Internet 
service provider (ISP), which means you probably have your own Web 
space. Take a look at Table 1-1, where I compare some popular ISPs.

*Yahoo! GeoCities isn’t an ISP, but it is a reliable online community that gives each 
member online Web space. Membership is free. Extra megabyte space is available for 
purchase.
Most ISPs allow you to have more than one e-mail address per account. Each 
e-mail address is entitled to a certain amount of free Web space. Through 
the use of hyperlinks (small pieces of HTML code that, when clicked, route 
the clicker from one place to another on the page or on another Web site), 
you can combine all the free Web space from each e-mail address into one 
giant Web site.

Book VI
Chapter 1

Web Site

Paying for Your Web Space
 
If America Online (AOL) is your Internet provider, you may already know 
that AOL often has serious issues regarding its users getting e-mail from the 
rest of the Internet. You can’t afford to run a business in an area that has 
e-mail issues. Your AOL account gives each of your seven screen names 2 
MB of online storage space. You can best utilize this space by using it to 
store images for eBay, not to run a business site. Each screen name, at 2 MB, 
can store fifty 40K images. (For more information on how to use this space 
for your extra images, see Book V.)
 
Many ISPs have their own page-builder (HTML-generating) program that’s 
free to their users. Poke around your ISP’s home page for a Community or 
Your Web Space link.
For example, after poking around the RoadRunner ISP’s home page (www.
rr.com), I found and clicked the Member Services link, which led me to 
a page offering various options. I finally found a Personal Home Page link, 
which took me to a page that would walk me through setting up my own 
home page. After agreeing to the terms of service, I can simply log on and 
set up my home page. You can also use software that you keep on your own 
computer to build Web pages. Microsoft’s new Expression Web is an amaz-
ing program that allows you to build cohesive Web sites quickly. 
Keep in mind, that most of the free ISP Web space is backed up with free 
page builder software — so be sure to check there first. In lieu of getting 
involved in a huge (and expensive) program such as Microsoft Expression 
Web, you might want to consider using a quick and easy HTML genera-
tor such as the one in Mozilla’s free SeaMonkey. You can use this with the 
Firefox FireFTP upload extension for a complete Web hookup. See Book V 
Chapter 3 for more information on the SeaMonkey program.
Your first Web pages may be simple, and that’s okay. You have to get used 
to having a Web site before you can really use it for commerce. Put up a 
home page that links to a few product-related pages and your eBay auctions, 
and, voilá, you’re in business. If you’re feeling more adventurous about your 
Web site, check out the next section, where I describe a handful of Web-site 
hosts.
Paying for Your Web Space
If you’ve been on the Internet for any length of time, you’ve been bombarded 
by hosting offers through your daily spam. A Web-hosting company houses 
your Web-site code and electronically doles out your pages and images to 
your Web page’s visitors.

548
Paying for Your Web Space
 
If you take advantage of PayPal’s free Pay Now buttons or shopping cart, you 
can turn a basic-level hosted site into a full-on e-commerce store without 
paying additional fees to your hosting company. The PayPal tools are easily 
inserted into your pages with a snippet of code provided by PayPal.
Before deciding to spend good money on a Web-hosting company, check it 
out thoroughly. Go to that company’s site to find a list of features offered. 
If you still have questions after perusing the Web site, look for a toll-free 
number to call. You won’t find any feedback ratings like you find on eBay, 
but the following are a few questions to ask (don’t hang up until you’re satis-
fied with the answers):
 
✦ How long has the company been in business? You don’t want a Web 
host that has been in business only a few months and operates out of 
the founder’s basement. Deal with someone who’s been around the 
Internet for a while (hence knows what he or she is doing). Is the com-
pany’s Web site professional-looking? Does the company look like it has 
enough money to stay in business?
 
✦ Who are some of the company’s other clients? Poke around to see 
whether you can find links to sites of other clients. Take a look at who 
else is doing business with the hosting company and analyze the sites. 
Do the pages and links come up quickly? Do all the images appear in a 
timely manner? Web sites that load quickly are a good sign.
 
✦ What is the downtime-to-uptime ratio? Does the Web host guarantee 
uptime (the span of time its servers stay operational without going down 
and denying access to your site)? Expecting a 99-percent-uptime guaran-
tee is not unreasonable; you’re open for business — and your Web host 
needs to keep it that way.
 
✦ How much Web space do you get for my money? MSN (Microsoft 
Network Internet-access service) gives you 30 MB for free; you’d better 
be getting a whole lot more if you’re paying for it!
 
✦ What’s the host’s data transfer limit? Data transfer is a measurement 
of the amount of bytes transferred from your site on the server to the 
Internet. In July 2001, my site had 93,000 hits; in July 2004, it had more 
than 500,000. Each hit transfers a certain amount of bytes from your 
host’s servers to the viewer’s computer.
 
✦ Does the Web host offer toll-free technical support? When something 
goes wrong with your Web site, you need it corrected immediately. You 
must be able to reach tech support quickly without hanging around on 
the phone for hours. Does the Web host have a technical support area 
on its Web site where you can troubleshoot your own problems (in the 
middle of the night)?

Book VI
Chapter 1

Paying for Your Web Space
 
 Whenever you’re deciding on any kind of provider for your business, take 
a moment to call its tech-support team with a question about their ser-
vices. Take note of how long you had to hold and how courteous the 
techs were. Before plunking down your hard-earned money, you should 
be sure that the provider’s customer service claims aren’t merely that — 
just claims.
 
✦ What’s the policy on shopping carts? In time, you’re probably going to 
need a shopping cart interface on your site. Does your provider charge 
extra for that? If so, how much? In the beginning, a convenient and 
professional-looking way to sell items on your site is to set up a PayPal 
shopping cart or PayPal Pay Now buttons. When you’re running your 
business full-time, however, a shopping cart or a way to accept credit 
cards is a must.
 
✦ What kind of statistics will you get? Visitors who go to your Web site 
leave a bread-crumb trail. Your host collects these statistics, so you’ll 
be able to know which are your most and least popular pages. You can 
know how long people linger on each page, where they come from, and 
what browsers they’re using. How your host supplies these stats to you 
is important. 
 
✦ Are there any hidden fees? Does the Web host charge exorbitant fees 
for setup? Charge extra for statistics? Impose high charges if your band-
width suddenly increases?
 
✦ How often will the Web host back up your site? No matter how redun-
dant a host’s servers are, a disaster may strike, and you need to know 
that your Web site won’t vaporize. Redundancy is the safety net for your 
site. Ask how many power backups a company has for the main system. 
Perhaps it has generators (more than one is good) and more.
 
If you have a Web site and you’re like me, you’re always looking for other 
hosts that offer more bang for your buck. It takes time to look behind the 
glitzy promotional statements and find out the facts behind each company. 
Go to www.tophosts.com and click the link to their current top Web hosts. 
Table 1-2 provides a comparison of some host service costs. In the rest of 
this section, I fill you in on the details about the four Web-hosting companies 
listed in the table. Make sure you check out their Web sites since the fea-
tures offered change almost as often as eBay does to get the most current 
information.
 
Keep in mind that 200 MB of disk storage space can host as many as 6000 
HTML pages.

ReadyHosting
ReadyHosting is a little guy who’s worked hard. The company has been 
hosting Web space since June 2000 and is a C-net Certified Award Winner. 
More than 150 new sites sign up with the service each day. Sites are hosted 
on servers running state-of-the-art software, and each site comes with a 
Cart32 e-commerce shopping cart. Cart32 integrates directly into Microsoft 
Expression Web (if you’ve got it), holds inventory, validates credit cards, 
and more. For details, check out
www.readyhosting.com
Web.com 
Web.com is a big company with big sophisticated equipment, and it hosts 
a bunch of the big guys on their own private servers. Web.com has been 
in the hosting business since 1995 and hosts sites for millions of small and 
medium-sized businesses.
For little guys, Web.com offers shared hosting, and that’s probably what 
you’ll be using for quite a while. With shared hosting, your site resides with 
others on a single server, sharing all resources. Web.com even offers an 
eBay Store integrator at no extra cost in the basic package.

If your Internet sales gross more than $100,000 a year, you might have to 
look into dedicated hosting, in which your site is on a server of its own and is 
managed by the technical experts at your hosting company.
One of the best features of the company is its 24/7 toll-free technical sup-
port: Its online support gives extensive advice on how to solve problems on

In the never-ending battle of the giants, Google 
is now offering free Web space and $10 Domain 
registration (per year). Private registration 
is important these days because it prevents 
anyone from looking up who owns your Web 
site — and then deluging you with spam and 
other “offers.”
New domains are instantly configured with a 
complete array of Google applications: person-
alized Gmail, Google Calendar, instant messag-
ing, online document editing, and more. It’s also 
loaded (at no charge) with other features.
 ✓ Full DNS control and management so you 
can move your domain settings to another

 ✓ Private registration at no additional cost to

 ✓ Free domain locking to protect you from

If Web.com is big, Microsoft is gargantuan; it’s the leader in everything 
related to personal computing (as if you didn’t know that). To grab a piece of 
the e-commerce market, Microsoft is making a strong push with its improved 
Office Live Small Business Center (formerly bCentral) site — which has 
always been a home for business Internet utilities — and has now come full 
circle to hosting Web sites and promoting e-commerce. Figure 1-1 shows the 
Office Live Small Business site.

Office Live’s goal is to get all small businesses on the Web — for FREE. Yes,

line, when you want to add the e-commerce tools you’re offered, it’s going to 
cost you. Availing yourself of the Web hosting is an easy procedure. You can 
find out the details of Microsoft’s current offerings at
http://smallbusiness.officelive.com/
Office Live Small Business handles everything you need — free templates, 
design, and Domain setup. Your domain name is free for the first year; after 
that, you will be charged $14.95 annually. Your domain name will automati-
cally renew each year unless you cancel prior to the renewal date.
You even get integrated e-mail and free registration. You can get up to 100 
e-mail accounts for free for the first year, and you pay $14.95 per additional 
year.

Yahoo! Web-site services
Yahoo! is trying to do a little bit of everything these days. I’m never sure 
which direction it’s going. When Yahoo! took over GeoCities (one of the orig-
inal free Web site hosts) a few years back, my family Web site became a free 
Yahoo! site. Considering that I have a free site, I must admit that the services 
that Yahoo! offers have been top-drawer, disproving the notion that you get 
only what you pay for. But then again, I’m not running a business from the 
site; it’s just a bunch of family pictures.
When you subscribe to one of Yahoo!’s Web-hosting plans, you can access 
their free design software, which allows you to be up and running with the 
basic site quickly. Thank goodness you don’t have to know any HTML to use 
it. The download includes access to more than 300 stock templates that you 
can customize any way you want. If you don’t want to the online tool, you 
can use Microsoft Web Expression (or any other HTML composer) to design 
your site. Figure 1-2 shows the Yahoo! Small Business Web site.

Naming Your Baby
Naming Your Baby
What to name the baby, er, Web site? It’s almost as much of a dilemma as 
deciding on your eBay user ID or eBay store name. If you don’t have an existing 
company name that you want to use, why not use the same name as your eBay 
store? Register and lock it up now so that you can keep your brand forever.
Name your site with a word that identifies what you do, what you sell, or 
who you are. And be sure you like it — because once it’s yours and you begin 
operating under it and establishing a reputation, it’ll be with you 20 years from 
now when you’re still selling online! (I know, it should only happen!)
A few Web sites offer wizards to help you decide your domain name. A 
particularly intuitive one can be found at the following:
http://snapitnow.com/
In a small, Web-based form, you input your primary business type and key-
words that describe your business. The wizard then displays a large number 
of options and also lets you know whether the options are available. Very 
convenient.
 
Before you attempt to register a name, you should check to be sure it isn’t 
anyone else’s trademark. To search an updated list of registered United 
States trademarks, go to the following and use the electronic trademark 
search system:
www.trademarksearchforfree.com
 
After a search, you may want to trademark your site name. www.legal
zoom.com is an online service that can help you with that. It offers online 
trademark applications and also refers you to an attorney if you’d like to use 
one; just go to their site for further information.
Suppose you’ve come up with a brilliant name 
for your site and your business gets really big 
and famous. Then someone else uses your 
Web site’s name but registers it as a .net — 
while yours is a .com. To avoid this situation, 
make sure you register both domains (.com 
and .net) and park them with your registrar. 
That way any permutations of your domain will 
point to your active Web site. For example, 
www.ebay.net and www.ebay.org are 
registered to (guess who?) ebay.com. You 
can check the owner of any domain name at 
any of the Web-hosting or registrar sites.

Registering Your Domain Name
Registering Your Domain Name
Talk about your junk e-mail. I get daily e-mails advising me to Lose 40 
pounds in 40 days, accept credit cards now, and of course REGISTER 
MY NAME NOW! The last scam seems to be geared to obtaining my e-mail 
address for other junk mail lists rather than trying to help me register my 
Web site. Choosing a select registrar (the company that handles the register-
ing of your site name) is as important as choosing the right Web host. You 
must remember that the Internet is still a little like the Wild West — and that 
the cyber-equivalent of the James Gang might be waiting to relieve you of 
your hard-earned cash. One of the ways to protect yourself is to understand 
how the registry works (knowledge is power), so read on.
Before you decide on a registrar for your domain name, take a minute to 
see whether the registrar is accredited by ICANN (Internet Corporation for 
Assigned Names and Numbers — the international governing body for domain 
names) or is reselling for an official ICANN-accredited registrar. (You’ll have 
to ask who they register with.) The Accredited Registrar Directory is updated 
constantly, so check the following for the most recent list:
www.internic.com/regist.html.
For a comparison of registration fees, see Table 1-3.

You’ll usually get a substantial discount from the more expensive registrars 
when you register your domain name for multiple years — a good idea if you 
plan on staying in business. Also, if you register your name through your 
hosting service, you might be able to cut the prices in Table 1-3 in half! The 
only drawback is that your prepaid registration might go out the window if 
you choose to change hosting companies.

556
Registering Your Domain Name
 
If you’re registering a new domain name but already have a site set up with 
your ISP, you need a feature called URL forwarding, or Web address forward-
ing. This feature directs any hits to your new domain name from your exist-
ing long URL address. Some registrars offer this service, but watch out for 
hidden surprises — such as a free offer of the service, which means they’ll 
probably smack a big fat banner at the bottom of your home page. Your reg-
istrar should also have some available tech support. Trying to troubleshoot 
DNS issues is a job for those who know what they’re doing! Remember, 
sometimes you do get what you pay for.
ICANN requires every registrar to maintain a 
publicly accessible whois database that dis-
plays all contact information for all domain 
names registered. Interested parties (or, for 
that matter, fraudsters) can find out the name, 
street address, e-mail address, and phone 
number of the owner of the site by running a

A
fter you set up your Web site and eBay store, it’s time to let the 
world know about it. Having spent many years in the advertising 
business, I can spot businesses that want to fail. They open their doors 
and expect the world to beat a path to them and make them rich. This 
doesn’t happen — ever.
You must take a proactive approach to letting the world in on the goodies 
you have for sale. This means spending a good deal of time promoting your 
site by running banner ads, buying keywords on Google, and getting your 
URL into a search engine. There are no shortcuts.
About a trillion (at least!) people out there want to take your money for 
advertising your Web site. There are affiliate programs, link exchanges, 
banner exchanges — the list just goes on! As with all transactions regarding 
your Web site, knowing who you’re dealing with is the key to success. If you 
want to run your banner on someone else’s site, don’t spend money; ask to 
do an exchange. The more advertising that you can get for free, the better. If 
you decide that you want to pay for advertising, I recommend that you wait 
until after you’ve made a profit selling merchandise from your site. 
A simple link to your Web site from your eBay About Me page will draw 
people to your site initially. You’ll be pleasantly surprised.
Engaging Banner-Ad Exchanges and Services
The way banner ad exchange services work is simple. First, to design a full-
size banner ad in your graphics program, you need to design to a designated 
size — according to the following standards:

558
Engaging Banner-Ad Exchanges and Services
 
✦ 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high
 
✦ GIF format (no JPEGs)
 
✦ Nontransparent
 
✦ File size less than 10 KB (10,240 bytes) 
 
✦ If animated, the animation stops at seven seconds and doesn’t include 
loops
Aside from the “standard” banner size, many sites will offer options for ads 
in different sizes. Once you decide on a service for your banner, check which 
of these standard sizes are accepted. See Table 2-1 for the standard sizes.

Engaging Banner-Ad Exchanges and Services
The exchange service displays your banner on other sites. When Web-
surfers click your banner, they’re taken to your site, where they’ll see all 
the great stuff you have for sale. You can even target what type of sites you 
want your banner to appear on as well. Remember that this is an exchange. 
Someone else’s banner will appear on your pages in exchange for showing 
yours on other sites.
You can also purchase space for your banner on a cost-per-click basis. When 
you pay, your Web banner is displayed whenever a Web page that refer-
ences the banner is loaded into a Web browser. This practice is what the 
technorati call an impression. When viewers click the banner, they’re sent 
to your Web site. The act of a viewer clicking the ad is called a click-through, 
and you pay per click-through. (Get it? Cost per click?) 
Banner design
If you think that designing an eye-catching banner ad is beyond your graphic 
talents, you’ll be happy to know that many excellent graphic artists on the 
Internet can produce one for you at a reasonable price. Type banner design 
into any search engine, and you’ll come up with a ton of listings (also use 
the animated banner search on eBay as described in Chapter 1). To find a 
designer who matches your needs, look at samples (and pricing) on their 
Web sites. Figure 2-1 shows the banner ad that I bought it on eBay for one of 
my books. 
 
Figure 2-1: 
One of my 
animated 
banner ads.
 
When planning your banner, keep a few points in mind:
 
✦ Go online and study the banner ads. Visit the major search engines and 
portals and see how the pros do it.
 
✦ Decide on what you want to say. A banner ad is like a mini-billboard. 
There’s no room for a lot of text and graphics; to get attention you have 
to keep it simple.
 
✦ Write down key phrases that describe your business. Then write and 
rewrite them again, shortening the verbiage. The shorter the message, 
the better — as long as it gets your point across.
 
✦ If you must use an image or graphic, settle on one. Having more than 
one picture in your banner can be distracting. Remember: You only have 
a couple of seconds to get the customer’s attention.

Trying Affiliate Programs
Finding banner advertising networks
Go to your favorite Web search engine and do a search for banner ad, or 
banner ad exchange. I ran these searches on Google and found tons of offer-
ings. Take a look at the various companies that show up and find the one 
that fits your needs. Be sure the company you select gives you stats on your 
banner views, your page visits, and your click-through ratio (the number of 
times people click your banner and visit your site compared to the number 
of times your banner is displayed).
Trying Affiliate Programs
An affiliate program is a partnership between your Web site and an online mer-
chant (a company that sells goods or services). It allows you to earn money 
when visitors from your site click through to the merchant’s Web site or when 
a visitor clicks through to the other party’s site and makes a purchase. 
 
An affiliate program can represent a value-added service to your Web site’s 
visitors or, when carried to an extreme, can dilute your own site’s message 
by cluttering your pages with banner ads many find more annoying than 
useful. I’m certain you’ve been to Web sites that had more ads than their 
own message. Those sites aren’t giving their customers anything to visit.
Carefully consider the companies with whom you want to affiliate. Be sure 
their core product ties into the theme of your Web site. Also be sure that 
they’re not in competition with you. Wouldn’t it be a bummer if your customer 
found that an item you’re selling was available on the affiliate’s site for less?
Companies can arrange affiliate links between you and other sites. The 
Cadillac (Rolls-Royce? Mercedes?) of these is LinkShare. 
LinkShare 
LinkShare hosts a password-protected Web site that offers affiliates a choice 
of hundreds of top-quality merchant programs. On this site, affiliates can 
join new programs, get links to put on their sites, and then see reports about 
how their links are performing and how much they’ve earned.
Here’s what LinkShare offers its affiliates:
 
✦ Commission potential: When a visitor clicks a link or banner that you’ve 
inserted on your site and goes to a merchant’s site (say, American 
Express), LinkShare keeps track of all the transactions that the visitor 
makes. If that visitor buys something on the merchant’s site, you get a 
commission. In some cases, you can be compensated even if your visi-
tor doesn’t buy anything; you’re paid just for having driven traffic to the 
merchant’s site. 

Book VI

Trying Affiliate Programs
 
✦ Program help and updates: LinkShare also provides affiliates with 
customer service, notifies affiliates about new programs and new 
opportunities, and offers resources for affiliates to learn about how to 
get the most out of their programs.
 
✦ Name-recognition clout: You can also include text links to affiliates in 
your e-mails and newsletters. Gussying up your site with some top-name 
vendors (you must be approved by each vendor) can give your site 
some clout. 
Sign up with LinkShare at www.linkshare.com. When your site is 
approved, you can start making some extra money!
eBay’s affiliate program
I’ve heard that Web site owners have made tens of thousands of dollars a 
year with the eBay affiliate program, the eBay Partner Network. The affiliate 
program pays like this:
 
✦ For new active eBay registrations: For every person who goes to eBay 
from your Web site (using the specified link or banner), registers with 
eBay for the first time, and places a bid on an item, you can get up to 
$30. Not a bad return.
 
 Tables 2-1 and 2-2 show the current payment schedules. For a registra-
tion to be considered active, the user must place a bid on an item or use 
Buy It Now to buy within 30 days of their initial registration. The rates in 
both tables are effective as of this writing.
 
✦ For winning bidders: You also get paid when someone bids on an item 
after clicking through from your link. This payment is based on monthly 
winning bids. You can actually get a percentage of eBay’s fees (insertion 
fee and the Final Value Fee) based on purchases made through your 
click-through. Nice!

The eBay affiliate program pays for one bid or Buy It Now per click from 
your Web site. Your site links must be used as a navigation point from which 
the buyer comes to the eBay site before every bid or Buy It Now. 
To check the current information and sign up for the program, visit 
ebaypartnernetwork.com
Some eBay affiliates have issues with the program. To educate yourself 
before you sign up, I suggest you read the public-affiliate message board at 
forums.ebay.com/db1/forum.jsp?forum=118 
so you’ll be familiar with any issues that may affect you or your site. 
Remember, there’s no free lunch.
 
An alternate idea is to put links on your site to your eBay store (read further 
in this chapter). Any purchases made from the special links on your Web 
site in your eBay store net you a 75 percent Final Value Fee credit. Read all 
about this little-known discount in Book VIII.
Cost-per-Click Advertising with Google
Wouldn’t it be cool if you could run ads all over the Internet at a low price? 
You can!
One excellent example is Google’s cost-per-click (CPC) offering, AdWords. 
Being a regular user of the Google index, I began to notice small ads on the 
right side of my searches under a headline called Sponsored Links. I thought 
they were expensive links from high-dollar operations — until I found out the 
truth. If you take a look at the results of a Google search in Figure 2-2, you’ll 

Book VI
Chapter 2
Marketing Your 
Web Site and eBay 
Store
563
Cost-per-Click Advertising with Google
see the ads that companies bought to show up on searches for my name on 
the right. (By the way — notice that my eBay Store shows up in the Google 
search on my name.)
 
Figure 2-2: 
Okay, I 
Googled 
myself.
 
People use Google more than 300 million times a day. Google AdWords allow 
you to create these profitable little ads. You choose keywords to let Google 
know where to place your ads. Certainly you can come up with some rel-
evant keywords to promote your Web site or eBay Store! (If you’re stumped, 
try the 30-day free trial of Sellathon mentioned in Book VIII.)
The coolest part of the deal is that you pay for the ad only when someone 
clicks it (similar to eBay banners, which are described in Chapter 1). Want to 
know more? Go over to www.adwords.com. Once you’re there, you can go 
over the details and set up your own campaign.
For your campaign, keep the following in mind:
 
✦ Keywords and keyword phrases: Come up with a list of keywords that 
would best describe your merchandise. Google allows you to estimate, 
based on current search data, how often your selected keyword will 
come up every day. Google will also estimate your daily cost based 
on the current amount of clicks on that word. That can be a shocking 
number. Don’t worry — not everyone who sees your ad will click it — 
but if they did, eeyow!

564
Cost-per-Click Advertising with Google
 
✦ CPC (cost-per-click): You determine how much you’ll pay for each click 
on your keywords. You can pay as little as $.05 or as much as $50.00 a 
click. The dollar amount you place on your clicks makes the basis for 
how often your ad appears.
 
✦ CTR (click-through rate): This statistic reflects how many people click 
your ad when they see it. If your CTR falls below .5% after 1000 impres-
sions, AdWords may slow or even discontinue your ad views. When 
one of your keywords isn’t passing muster, it will be indicated on your 
reports.
 
 Without showing my keywords, Figure 2-3 shows you a month’s worth 
of keyword analysis for my account. You can see clearly that some key-
words are doing their jobs and others aren’t. To keep my account cur-
rent, I evaluate my CTR every month and delete the laggers.
 
Figure 2-3: 
AdWords 
keyword 
statistics.
 
 
✦ Daily budget: You can set the cap in dollars on how much you’ll spend 
a day. Otherwise, if you had some really hot keywords, you could spend 
thousands on clicks!
Setting up an AdWords account takes a while and some thinking. So wait 
until your mind is clear (Saturday morning?) and sit down at the AdWords 
site with a cup of coffee.
Google gives you excellent step-by-step instructions after you’re signed in at 
www.adwords.com. This is the general process:

Book VI
Chapter 2
Marketing Your 
Web Site and eBay 
Store
565
Cost-per-Click Advertising with Google
 
1. Decide whether you want to target your ads geographically.
 
 You can pinpoint your market if you’d like, or you can blast the entire 
world. Choose from a list of 14 languages, 250 countries, or as far down 
as 200 United States regions.
 
2. Create your ad.
 
 This is not as easy as I thought! You can create only three lines of ad 
text with a total of 95 characters. Be as concise as possible. Don’t throw 
in useless adjectives. Figure out the perfect 95 characters that will sell 
your site to the world. You must also supply the URL for your Web site 
or eBay Store. 
 
3. Select your keywords.
 
 Type your keywords and key phrases in the box provided. You can use 
Google’s Keyword Suggestion tool to help you out. Because this is your 
initial pass and won’t be etched in granite, take some wild stabs and see 
what happens.
 
4. Choose you maximum CPC (cost per click) and then click Calculate 
Estimates.
 
 Here’s where the sticker shock gets you. The displayed data lets you 
know which keywords you can afford to keep and which ones must 
be discarded. If you want to change your CPC amount, do so and click 
Recalculate Estimates. The Traffic Estimator calculates how much, on 
average, you’ll end up spending in a day.
 
5. Specify your daily budget.
 
 There will be a prefilled amount that would ensure that your ad stays on 
top and gets full exposure every day. (No, Mr. Google, I do not want to 
spend $50 a day on my keywords.) Set a cap on your budget and Google 
will never exceed it. You may make it as low as you want; there’s no 
minimum spending amount.
 
6. Enter your e-mail address and agree to the terms.
 
7. Enter your billing information.
 
 You’re minutes away from your ads going live on the Google index.
Interestingly, your ads may also appear on other places on the Internet 
through Google’s Webmaster’s program. Take a look at Figure 2-4. My ad 
ended up on my book’s listing page on Amazon because one of my key 
phrases is eBay For Dummies (and my targeting is considered relevant).

For Dummies (also from Wiley Publishing).
Getting Your Site into a Search Engine
For people to find your site (and what you’re selling), they must be able 
to locate you. A popular way people do this is by searching with a search 
engine, so you should submit your site to search engines. Go to the search 
engines that interest you and look for a link or a help area that will enable 
you to submit your site. Be sure to follow any specific instructions on the 
site; some may limit the amount of keywords and the characters in your 
description.
To submit your URL to search engines, you need to do a little work (noth-
ing’s easy, is it?). Write down 25 to 50 words or phrases that describe your 
Web site; these are your keywords. Now, using as many of the words you 
came up with, write a description of your site. With the remaining words, 
create a list of keywords, separating each word or short phrase with a 
comma. You can use these keywords to add meta tags to the header in 
your HTML document for your home page. Meta tags are identifiers used by 
search-engine spiders, robots that troll the Internet looking for new sites to 
classify on search engines. Specifying a meta tag in HTML looks like this:
<META NAME = ìinsert your keywords here separated by commasî 
CONTENT = ìshort description of your siteî>
 
If you have a problem coming up with keywords, check out Yahoo! GeoCities 
handy meta tag generator, which you can use for free:
http://geocities.yahoo.com/v/res/meg.html
Not to be outdone, Google also have a free generator as part of the AdWords 
program:

Have Yahoo! Search Submit do the work
Search Submit Basic is part of Yahoo’s search-marketing services. It handles 
your site submissions in non-sponsored search results on Yahoo! (as well as 
on other portals such as AltaVista and AllTheWeb), saving you the trouble of 
going from site to site. For $49 a year, the service will submit and resubmit 
as many as five URLs as often as you’d like. You even get access to a page 
online where you can check the status of your site’s performance.
Visit http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/srchsb/ssb.php for more 
information and to sign up.
 
Most Web-hosting companies provide this service (of submitting URLs) to 
their clients. Double-check to be sure that your Web-hosting company 
doesn’t offer a similar service free or, at the very least, at a discount.
Get listed on Yahoo! 
Yahoo! is one of the more difficult sites to list with, although you can get a 
free listing if you fill out all the forms correctly and wait six to eight weeks 
(see Figure 2-5). You can find instructions for the free listing at 
https://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/submit

Catch attention on Google
Have you ever Googled your eBay Store? I did, by searching for the name of 
my eBay Store and including the word eBay in the search parameters. Figure 
2-6 shows you the results. 
 
Figure 2-6: 
Wow! My

(even on the 
Canada and 
UK eBay

You, too, should Google your Web site and eBay store to see whether it’s 
listed. If it isn’t, you’re missing out on a huge opportunity for free promotion. 
Google runs spiders (just picture the way a spider runs — swiftly and all 
over the place) that scour the Internet on a monthly basis looking for data to 
become part of the Google index.
Thousands of sites (and you do know that since your eBay store has a 
unique URL, it’s considered to be a Web site) are added to the Google index 
every time their spiders crawl the Web. 
If your eBay store isn’t listed, go to www.google.com/addurl/, as pic-
tured in Figure 2-7. When you get to this page, type your eBay store URL. To 
find your store’s URL, click the red store tag next to your eBay user ID to go 
to your store, and then copy and paste the URL (in the address line of your 
browser) into the URL line on the form. When I went to my eBay store, I got 
this URL:

What’s the zeitgeist?
It’s all about the zeitgeist. And what the heck, 
you may wonder, is a zeitgeist? Zeitgeist comes 
from the German (originally geist der zeit) words 
zeit meaning time and geist meaning spirit. It’s 
the all-embracing intellectual atmosphere of a 
distinct time period. In today’s terms? It’s the 
buzz.
Similar to the Yahoo! Buzz, the Google zeitgeist 
keeps current and historic data on the site. The 
zeitgeist is based on the total number of que-
ries on a particular subject in a certain period 
of time. It’s updated on a weekly, monthly, and, 
when called for, daily basis, and can be found at

From that page, you can also see the zeitgeist

(invaluable information if you’re selling on eBay 
internationally) including the United Kingdom, 
Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Australia, and Japan. This page 
also links to historical zeitgeist data.
The zeitgeist page is where you can get the 
nuggets of thought for your marketing and sell-
ing plans. The zeitgeist also has information 
for previous periods. If you take a look at the 
figure, you’ll find some obvious data (hindsight 
is 20/20). If you were selling items based on any 
of the popular queries or brands in 2007, it’s 
fair to say you did very well. Check out the zeit-
geist. It could be your crystal ball into stocking

Chapter 3: Using PayPal 
to Increase Your Sales
In This Chapter
✓ Setting up a PayPal store 
✓ Cashing in on PayPal referrals
✓ Using PayPal tools to collect money outside eBay
W
hen you think of PayPal, you might think of it as just a payment ser-
vice on eBay, but it’s much, much more. Did you know that PayPal 
has shops? Yes! It’s another place to sell your wares online. PayPal also has 
some great tools for your Web site. In this chapter, I give you the informa-
tion you need to be fully PayPal-enabled!
Setting Up Shop at PayPal
Before PayPal joined eBay, it was pulling out every trick in the book to get 
members. The company was founded with a desire to give its customers 
plenty of extras for their loyalty — and it offers tons of tools to enhance 
the seller’s online selling experience. The tools and the prices charged by 
PayPal are unmatched by any other online payment service. 
Joining PayPal shops
The best part of joining PayPal shops is that there’s no cost to you. A PayPal 
shop is not a separate online store but a link from the PayPal mall (so to 
speak) to a unique group of shops. More than 40 million PayPal members 
may browse this area at any time, so why not avail yourself of this free mar-
keting opportunity? 
The shop can link to your eBay store, or you can link to your PayPal-enabled 
business Web site. Think of it as a way to double your store’s visibility on 
the Web without spending more in fees. Your store will be listed in the 
PayPal Shops directory, as shown in Figure 3-1.

Shops hub 
page.
 
Notice that the PayPal hub has categories (on the left side of the page) and a 
shop search. The categories whittle down into subcategories; they work just 
like those on eBay (minus the sub-subcategories).
I used the search box to find some pretty things and came up with the 
search results shown in Figure 3-2. Notice the number next to each store 
name. No, it’s not the seller’s feedback rating; it’s the PayPal seller reputation 
number.

PayPal shopping invitations
As a PayPal shop owner, you have an additional benefit. When a customer 
sends you payment from an area other than your Web site (hmm, sound like 
your sales on eBay?), PayPal displays an invitation to shop at your store! A 
sample invitation is shown in Figure 3-3.
 
Figure 3-3: 
An invitation 
from PayPal 
Shops.
 
That’s a cool deal, don’t you think? Who would have figured you’d get help 
for your outside Web site from an eBay company? But, as with any cool 
deal, you must meet a few requirements before you can set up your shop at 
PayPal:
 
✦ Verified premier or business account: You must maintain one of the 
higher-level PayPal accounts.
 
✦ Registered credit card: You must maintain a current credit card regis-
tered to your PayPal account.
 
✦ Confirmed checking account: You must have at least one confirmed 
checking account tied into your PayPal account.
 
✦ Money market fund: You are required to sign up for the PayPal money 
market fund. This means you must supply PayPal with your Social 
Security number or the Federal ID number for your business.
 
PayPal does not send out Federal 1099 forms on your PayPal sales. That 
income is coming from your buyers, and because you’re not paid by PayPal, 
they won’t issue a 1099 for your PayPal sales.

574
Setting Up Shop at PayPal
 
PayPal offers you FDIC pass-through insurance. PayPal deposits your money 
as part of pooled accounts in several banks: Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 
Comerica Bank — California, USA, and Bank of America, N.A. In the very 
unlikely event that any of these major banks should fail, your money would 
be covered under the FDIC pass-through deposit insurance, along with any 
other deposits you have at that bank, up to $100,000. FDIC pass-through 
deposit insurance protects you only against the failure of the bank in which 
PayPal places your funds; it does not protect you against PayPal’s (very 
unlikely) insolvency.
After you’re committed to the idea that you’d like a PayPal shop (and 
assuming that you’re qualified), the application process is easy. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Give your PayPal shop a name.
 
 The name doesn’t have to match your Web site. Give your shop a smart 
marketing name, something that will catch a person’s eye while brows-
ing the stores.
 
2. Give PayPal the URL that you want to link your PayPal shop to.
 
 This can be your eBay store or your own e-commerce, PayPal-enabled 
Web site.
 
3. Type a short description of your Web site.
 
 Be as descriptive as possible and make it interesting!
 
4. Select the two categories from the PayPal Shops category list that best 
describe your store.
 
5. List up to ten keywords to describe your store to search engines.
 
 Be smart! Find out which are your best keywords with the Google key-
word tool at 
https://adwords.google.com/select/
main?cmd=KeywordSandbox
Featured Shop consideration
After you set up your PayPal shop, you can apply to be selected as a fea-
tured shop — with your logo — on the PayPal logout page (the page that 
appears when you sign off from PayPal).
To apply, you must include another brief Web-site description, along with all 
the reasons you’d make a great selection as the featured shop.
 
PayPal then selects their shops from the applications, basing their choice on 
the quality of the site and how well and prominently PayPal is integrated 
into it. Not a bad deal!

Cashing In on the PayPal Merchant Referral Program
Just think: If only a few of the 150 million PayPal members click through to 
your Web site when they’re exiting their transactions, you could be rolling 
in orders! 
Site statistics
Every month, PayPal sends statistics on hits to PayPal shopkeepers. Don’t 
worry; these statistics aren’t a bunch of useless information — they’re all 
about your Web-site hits! Take a look at a sample in Figure 3-4. Remember 
that this report only counts hits as placed through links from the PayPal 
Shops area, not any independent hits you get from the Internet.
 
Figure 3-4:

Cashing In on the PayPal Merchant Referral Program
And you thought the days of getting money for referring people to PayPal 
were over? Hah! PayPal has set its sights a little higher. Now they want 
business-account referrals rather than personal users.
You can send invitations to use PayPal in your e-mails using a custom link, 
or you can place a banner on your Web site. You receive $10 if a merchant 
you refer uses any of PayPal’s Web-site tools. You can earn more after your 
referral sells $1000 worth of products or services.
It’s kind of like multilevel marketing. After the referral posts the initial $200 
in sales, you receive a percentage of your referral’s revenue, up to a maxi-
mum of $1000, for the first twelve months of the referral’s PayPal account. 
The residual payout equals .5% of the merchant’s net (non-eBay) sales.
 
No spamming!!!
To get in on this good deal, go to the little navigation bar at the bottom of 
the page and click Referrals. After you arrive at the target page, you’re pre-
sented with two links, as shown in Figure 3-5. One is a referral link for e-mail, 
and the other is a big honking PayPal banner that you can put on your Web 
site. (HTML custom coding is generated for you — just copy and paste it into 
your Web page.)

If you think that PayPal is only for your eBay business, think again! Before 
eBay purchased PayPal, approximately 15 percent of PayPal’s revenues 
came from online gaming. When eBay took over in late 2002, PayPal no 
longer received revenue from this arena. And there’s good news for us: 
Today they offer the same tools to process PayPal payments on your own 
personal or business Web sites.
Aside from your eBay Store, you can sell directly from your Web site or your 
AOL HomeTown page. In time, as your eBay business grows into your own 
Web site, you’ll find that using PayPal as your payment provider is a great 
deal. You pay the same transaction fees — to PayPal only — for processing 
your credit-card sales.
 
Build business by including your Web site URL in your e-mail signature, let-
ting the world know you’re open for business 24/7. Your About Me page can 
also include links to your e-commerce-enabled Web site — it’s fully in line 
with the eBay rules!

In this section, you discover how to make your own Web site an extra rev-
enue builder. I’m going to use my Web site as the example. It’s a basic Web 
site, but people can (and do) shop there from time to time. Remember: Any 
sale you make from your own Web site involves no eBay fees and means 
extra income for you.
Making the PayPal payment 
option available on your site
After you get a few items in your garage or business location that you stock 
in quantity, you’ve got the makings of your own Web store. Don’t let the 
thought of this spook you. You can do this!
The first step is to create a Web site. When you have the site up and running, 
Buy Now buttons are the most basic way to enable sales through PayPal from 
your site. These buttons are easy to insert — you don’t have to be a computer 
whiz to create the links because PayPal makes this almost automatic.
There’s no fee to use this service (other than the processing fee when some-
one buys an item). All you need is a verified PayPal Premier or Business 
account.
When someone buys something from your Web site, the procedure is the 
same as when someone pays for an eBay item. You receive an e-mail from 
PayPal telling you that a Web payment (versus an eBay payment) has been 
received. The e-mail subject includes the item number you’ve assigned in 
your code (it can also be an item name, as shown in Figure 3-6).

e-mail when

Creating a button on the PayPal Web site
 
If you want to save a bunch of time, try to use the sample coding in the 
“Coding for do-it-yourselfers” section. Just customize the HTML coding (with 
your Web site details) and put it into your Web page. If it doesn’t work (or 
you’re too nervous to do real coding), follow the next set of instructions for 
placing the PayPal button on your site.
To create a payment button on your Web site, first log on to the PayPal Web 
site. From there, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Merchant Services tab, at the top of the page, as shown in 
Figure 3-7.
 
Figure 3-7: 
The first 
step in 
creating a 
button.
 
 
2. Click the Buy Now Button link.
 
 The Buy Now Buttons page for selling items on your site, as shown in 
Figure 3-8, appears.
 
3. Indicate the type of item you want to Accept payments for. Your 
choices are
 
• Products: If you’re selling physical merchandise.
 
• Services: If your customer is buying a psychic reading, bookkeeping, 
or some other service from you.
 
• Subscription and recurring billing: If you’re selling subscriptions to 
a newsletter or collecting dues for a membership.
 
• Donations: If you have a Web site and you’d like to get donations — 
here’s the right button. (Asking ain’t getting.)
 
• Gift Certificates: If you’re selling gift certificates to your store.

Figure 3-8:

button.
 
 
4. Decide what kind of button you want. For this, you have two choices
 
• Add to Cart: If you’re selling lots of item and you’d like to encourage 
your buyers to make multiple purchases.
 
• Buy Now: When your customers will pick only one item from a 
number of choices.
 
 In this example, I choose the Buy Now button.
 
5. Enter your item information, including the item name, ID, price, 
currency, default buyer’s country, and weight.

580
Generating Sales Using PayPal
 
 Here’s a list of all the items you’re asked to enter in the Create Buy Now 
Button section. Refer to this list when you examine the full sample code 
shown later in this chapter. It will help explain what goes into each 
input type field. Some of this information is optional:
 
• Item name/service: Input your item (or service) name.
 
• Item ID/number: Give your item an ID number or name.
 
 I recommend that you use a number and abbreviated name, which 
appear in the subject line of the e-mail that PayPal sends when some-
one makes a purchase. 
 
• Price: Enter the item price here. 
 
• Currency: Decide what currency you’re willing to accept for your 
purchases. (If you’re in the U.S., go for the dollars.)
 
• Buyer’s Default Country: If you accept international orders, specify 
here whether you want your buyer’s payment page to default to a 
specific country. If you don’t specify, buyers can choose for them-
selves. But I selected the United States to make it faster for most 
purchasers.
 
• Weight: Weight of the packaged item when it’s ready to mail.
 
6. Select a button in the Customize Button section. 
 
 Choose a Buy Now button to insert on your page. If you don’t like the 
ones pictured, click the Customize Appearance link to see more options, 
as shown in Figure 3-9.
 
 I like using the buttons that include the different credit card icons so 
that folks who aren’t familiar with PayPal will know that they can use 
any credit card. You also have the opportunity to design your own 
button, but hey, why make extra work for yourself right now? Just set up 
a standard button and get fancy later.

7. Continue to scroll down the page and make choices or fill in informa-
tion as prompted.
 
 You see the following prompts and options:
 
• Button Encryption: Decide whether you want your button to be 
encrypted (increasing security by ensuring that the item’s details 
cannot be changed by a third party). 
 
 Encrypting your button may seem like a simple “yes” answer, but 
keep this in mind: If you want to be able to customize your button 
(adding more options) by changing the HTML code, you won’t be 
able to do that if you encrypt. I don’t encrypt my buttons. If someone 
sends the incorrect amount for an item — by some nefarious behav-
ior — I can just send it right back to them through PayPal.
 
 In the future, PayPal plans to allow users to encrypt buttons and add 
dynamic options. Watch for that!
 
• Shipping Method Option: From this area, select a flat shipping and 
handling charge or one based on a percentage of the item’s price. 
 
 Unfortunately, PayPal doesn’t supply a cool shipping calculator. 
You can put a postal shipping chart on your item page and let your 
buyers insert the proper shipping amount, or you can enter a ship-
ping amount on this page that lands somewhere in the middle of the 
highest (farthest away) and lowest (closest) zone to your shipping 
location. You’ll lose a little on some but make it up on others.
 
• Sales Tax Options: Select your state and enter the appropriate sales 
tax to be applied to your in-state purchases. If you already have a 
sales-tax provision in your PayPal profile, it will be listed here auto-
matically. PayPal will apply the sales tax for sales shipped within 
your state.
 
8. After you make your selections and choose a button to insert, click 
Create Button Now. 
 
9. If you want to add options, click Add More Options.
 
 On the next page, you can add extended options for your button. 
Included (definitely use these!) are the following:
 
• Item options: If your item has options (if, for example, it comes in 
different sizes or colors), you can create a custom drop-down list for 
your payment page so the customer can choose; just type the offered 
options in this box.
 
• Insert your logo: To add a logo to your payment page, type the URL 
where the file is stored. PayPal will place the logo on your payment 
page. 
 
 The logo you use must be sized at 150 x 50 pixels or PayPal won’t 
accept it.

582
Generating Sales Using PayPal
 
• Payment landing page: If you want your customers to land on a 
specific page after they’ve made a payment — setting up a thank-you 
page on your Web site is a nice idea, for example — enter that URL 
here. Figure 3-10 shows a portion of my Web site’s basic thank-you 
page. The page also has links to take the buyer back to my Web site.
 
Figure 3-10: 
Thanks for 
buying my 
item!
 
 
• Cancel Transaction page: If you want to include a page where people 
are taken if they cancel the transaction before completing it, you can 
insert that address here. If you don’t specify a page, they will land at 
a PayPal Web page that allows cancellation of the transaction.
 
• Quantity: If you’d like your customers to be able to purchase more 
than one of your item at a time, you may indicate that here. The 
buyers will then be able to fill in a number in a quantity field.
 
• Shipping address: Click Yes if you’d like the customer’s shipping 
address. I guess it would be kind of useless not to ask for a shipping 
address when you’re expected to ship the item somewhere, huh? It 
does kind of take the guesswork out of things to include this field!
 
• Optional instructions: If you’d like your buyers to be able to write 
you a note, click Yes in this field.
 
10. Click Preview.
 
 You see a sample of the page your customer will see after making a Web 
payment to you. 
 
11. If the page is okay, click the Create Button Now button. 
 
12. If you want to go back and edit, click the Edit button.
That’s all there is to creating your first Buy Now button and the payment 
page that appears when it’s clicked. When you get the hang of it, I’m sure 
you’d rather code your own. It’s really easy (even I can do it) and consider-
ably faster. Read on.
Coding for do-it-yourselfers
Yes, there’s an easy way and a formal way to do everything. Because I am 
unreasonably busy, I did my Web site PayPal buttons the easy way — with-
out a bunch of options.

The items I sell on my Web site can’t be combined in one box. Each has to be 
shipped in an individual box, and postage must be charged for each item. I 
therefore don’t use the shopping cart method. 
Figure 3-11 shows a payment button on one of the pages on my site. When 
the mouse “rolls over” the payment button, a PayPal message appears. 
 
Figure 3-11:

When you click the payment button, you land on my Cool eBay Tools 
PayPal payment page (shown in Figure 3-12, complete with custom logo). 
The PayPal payment page is a secure page (as indicated by the lock icon) 
directly from PayPal. The URL for the page begins with https; the s at the 
end indicates that the site is secure.

In This Chapter
✓ Organizing your stock
✓ Keeping inventory
✓ Packing up
✓ Buying stamps without a trip to the post office
T
he more items you sell, the more confusing things can get. As you 
build your eBay business, the little side table you use for storing eBay 
merchandise isn’t going to work anymore. You must think industrial. Even 
part-time sellers can benefit by adding a few professional touches to their 
business areas.
In this chapter, I emphasize the importance of setting up and organizing 
your back office. I cover everything from stacking your stock to keeping 
inventory to getting those indispensable packing materials and saving time 
by buying postage online. Organization will be your byword. Dive right in. 
The sooner you read this chapter, the sooner you can build your eBay back 
office and get down to business.
The Warehouse: Organizing Your Space
Whether you plan to sell large items or small items, you need space for 
storing them. As you make savvy purchases, maintaining an item’s mint 
condition will be one of your greatest challenges. In this section, I cover the 
details of what you’ll need to safeguard your precious stock.
Shelving your profits
Before you stock the shelves, it helps to have some! You also need a place 
to put the shelves: your garage, a spare room, or somewhere else. For 
the home-based business, you have a choice between two basic kinds of 
shelves:

590
The Warehouse: Organizing Your Space
 
✦ Plastic: If you’re just starting out, you can always go to the local closet-
and-linen-supply store to buy inexpensive plastic shelves. They’re light 
and cheap but they’ll buckle in time.
 
✦ Steel: If you want to do it right the first time, buy steel shelving. The 
most versatile steel shelving is the wire kind (versus solid steel shelves), 
which is light and allows air to circulate around your items. Steel wire 
shelving assembles easily; I put mine together without help. You can 
combine steel-wire shelving units to create a full wall of shelves. Each 
shelf safely holds as much as 600 pounds of merchandise.
 
To save you time, dear reader, I researched the subject and found some 
readily available, reasonably priced shelves. Just go to Target or Costco and 
look for Seville Classics four-shelf commercial shelving, sold in 36- and 
48-inch-wide units. Believe it or not, Seville Classics also has an eBay store 
(but you have to pay for shipping). Look for them at 
stores.ebay.com/Seville-Classics
You can easily convert a garage or a spare room to a professional and func-
tional stock room. Figure 1-1 shows a portion of my stock area.

Box ’em or bag ’em?
Packing your items for storage can be a challenge. For smaller items, pick 
up some plastic bags in sandwich, quart, and gallon sizes. When items are 
stored in plastic, they can’t pick up any smells or become musty before you 
sell them. The plastic also protects the items from rubbing against each 
other and causing possible damage. If you package them one item to a bag, 
you can then just lift one off the shelf and put it directly into a shipping box 
when the listing is over.
Your bags of items will have to go into boxes for storage on the shelves. 
Clear plastic storage boxes, the kind you often find at superstores, are great 
for bulky items. They’re usually 26 inches long, so before you buy these big 
plastic containers, make sure that they’ll fit on your shelving comfortably 
and that you’ll have easy access to your items. Using cardboard office-type 
file storage boxes from an office supply store is another option. These card-
board boxes are 10 x 12 x 16 inches, which is a nice size for storing medium-
size products. At around $1 each, they’re the most economical choice. The 
downside is that you can’t see through cardboard boxes, so if your label falls 
off, you have to take the box off the shelf and open it to check its contents. 
Smaller see-through plastic boxes with various compartments (such as the 
type home-improvement stores carry for storing tools) work great for stor-
ing very small items.
 
When using these large plastic bins, it’s always a good idea to tape a pad of 
Post-it notes on the end of the box so you can quickly identify the contents. 
You can use regular sticky labels, but changing them will leave large 
amounts of paper residue over time, and that makes your storage look 
sloppy and icky.
Speaking of bins, Figure 1-2 shows you the bins in the small parts area of the 
warehouse of eBay seller banderson-at-fuse. His setup isn’t exactly what the 
home seller will need, but it sometimes helps to see how the big guys do it.

Keeping Track of What You Have
Savvy eBay sellers have different methods of handling inventory. They use 
everything from spiral-bound notebooks to sophisticated software pro-
grams. Although computerized inventory tracking can simplify this task, 
starting with a plain ol’ handwritten ledger is fine, too. Choose whichever 
works best for you, but keep in mind that as your eBay business grows, a 
software program that tracks inventory for you may become necessary.
Most of these systems wouldn’t work for a company with a warehouse full of 
stock — but will work nicely in an eBay sales environment. Many sellers tape 
sheets of paper to their boxes to identify them by number, and use that as a 
reference to a simple Excel spreadsheet for selling purposes. Excel spread-
sheets are perfect for keeping track of your auctions as well, but if you’re 
using a management service or software, you don’t need both for physical 
inventory.
When you’re running a full-time business, however, you have to keep Uncle 
Sam happy with a dollars and cents accounting of your inventory, so keep 
your inventory records in a standardized program such as QuickBooks (dis-
cussed in Book IX). I describe a variety of auction management software and 
Web sites, many of which include physical inventory tracking features.

Keeping Track of What You Have
Figure 1-3 shows some of the merchandise stocked at an eBay seller’s 
warehouse.
You may also want to use Excel spreadsheets for your downloaded PayPal 
statements, to hold information waiting to transfer to your bookkeeping 
program. I post my sales each time I make a PayPal withdrawal (a couple of 
times a week). I keep the PayPal downloads only for archival purposes.

Planning: The key to good organization
When I had to put my eBay merchandise in 
order, I was busy with my regular business, so 
I hired a friend to organize my eBay area. This 
decision turned out to be one massive mistake. 
My friend organized everything and put all my 
items in boxes — but didn’t label the boxes to 
indicate what was stored in each. To this day I 
still haven’t recovered and don’t know where a 
bunch of my stuff is!
A bit of advice: Think things out and plan where 
you’ll put everything. Organize your items by 
theme, type, or size. If you organize before 
planning, you might end up with organized dis-
organization.

594
The Shipping Department: Packin’ It Up
In my eBay business, I keep my inventory record in QuickBooks. Each time I 
purchase merchandise for my business, I post it in the program. When I post 
my sales each week, QuickBooks automatically deducts the sold items from 
my inventory. I then do a physical inventory as product stock runs low.
The Shipping Department: Packin’ It Up
In this section, I review some of the things you must have for a complete, 
smooth-running shipping department, such as cleaning supplies and packing 
materials. The handling fee portion of your shipping charges pays for these 
kinds of items. Don’t run low on them — and pay attention to how you store 
them. They must be kept in a clean environment.
Pre-packaging clean up
Be sure the items you send out are in tip-top shape. Here are a few everyday 
chemicals that can gild the lily:
 
✦ WD-40: This decades-old lubricant works very well at getting price 
stickers off plastic and glass without damaging the product. And if the 
plastic on a toy box begins to look nasty — even when stored in a clean 
environment — a quick wipe with a paper towel and a dash of WD-40 will 
make it shine like new. It also works well for untangling jewelry chains 
and shining up metallic objects.
 
✦ Goo Gone: Goo Gone works miracles in cleaning up gooey sticker 
residue from nonporous items.
 
✦ Vamoose. Is there a smoker in your house? Cigar or cigarette smoke 
can permeate most items. Even if you’re an occasional smoker, this 
product is worth its weight in gold. It’s a chemical miracle that totally 
removes these stale, smoky smells. Read up about it on the Web at 
www.vamooseproducts.com.
 
✦ un-du: This amazing liquid easily removes stickers off cardboard, plas-
tic, fabrics, and more without causing damage. It comes packaged with a 
patented miniscraper top that you can use in any of your sticker-
cleaning projects.
Packing materials
The most important area where sellers drop the time-and-money ball is in 
shipping. I buy hundreds of items from eBay and have seen it all when it 
comes to packing, padding, and shipping. I’ve seen money thrown out the 
window by e-tailers that have used incorrect packing materials, which are 
expensive for the seller and often increase the shipping cost of the package 
for the buyer due to the final weight.

The Shipping Department: Packin’ It Up
The packing materials that you use for your shipments can either make or 
break your bottom line in the shipping income/expense column of your 
business reports.
Many sellers remark, “The buyer pays shipping, so what do I care what it 
costs? I pass on all those expenses to my buyers.” Well, yes and no. Prudent 
packing can be a boon to your business because having lower shipping costs 
can often make the difference between a sale and no sale (and your shipping 
charges affect your position in eBay’s search). This is especially true when 
several people have the same item up for sale, with a minuscule difference in 
the item’s selling price. Reasonable shipping charges can make the difference.
Pay attention to packing. It’s only expensive if you don’t know what you’re 
doing. You can ship your items in quality packing, keep buyers happy, and 
still make a dollar or so on each item for your handling fees.
Buying your shipping materials online is trés economical. eBay shipping 
supply e-tailers make their living selling online. Their overhead is much 
lower than any retail outlet. Even after paying shipping to get the bubble 
wrap to your door, you save money and time. Most of these sellers ship the 
same day they get your order.
 
Only use as much packing material as necessary to get the item where it’s 
going intact. This saves time, money, and space.
Using void fill
Nope! Void fill is not a new drug to prevent hunger pangs when dieting. Void 
fill is the industry term for the stuff you use to fill up space in shipping boxes 
to keep items from rolling in transit. (It’s really the modern term for the old-
fashioned word dunnage.)
Clothing can often pick up odors that you just 
don’t notice. I recently bought a designer dress 
on eBay from a seller who had the typical dis-
claimer in her description: “No stains, holes, 
repairs, or odors. Comes from a smoke-free, 
pet-free home.” 
Unfortunately, the minute I opened the box I 
could smell the musty odor of an item that had 
been stored for a long time.
To prevent that stale storage odor, keep a 
package of Dryel Fabric Care System around. 
This is a safe, do-it-yourself dry cleaning 
product. Just toss your better eBay cloth-
ing items in the patented Dryel bag with the 
special sheet and toss it in the dryer as per 
the instructions on the box. Your garment will 
come out smelling clean — and wrinkle free. 
For more information, visit their Web site at 
www.Dryel.com.

The Shipping Department: Packin’ It Up
There are many forms of void fill, and the best kind depends on the item 
you’re shipping. Here are the most popular types, and a description of their 
plusses and minuses.
So that you can always be sure that your items will arrive at their destina-
tions in one piece, you’ll want to keep the following on hand at all times:
 
✦ Air packing pillows: I found out about these nifty little pillows when 
I received books from a major online bookseller. Buying air packing 
pillows from sellers on eBay is economical, mainly because the manu-
facturing and shipping costs are low. What these folks are essentially 
shipping you is 99 percent air (something the post office hasn’t yet fig-
ured out how to charge for). You can find air pillows in the Business and 
Industrial category.
 
 Air packing pillows are perfect for filling in the area around smaller 
boxed items that you want to double box. They are also handy if you 
have breakables that you’ve prewrapped in bubble wrap; just use the 
pillows to fill out the box. They’re crushproof and can support plus or 
minus 150 pounds without a blowout.
 
✦ Bubble wrap: Made up of air-filled cushions of polyethylene, bubble 
wrap is supplied in rolls of different widths and lengths (see Figure 1-4). 
It shines for those who wrap delicate, breakable items. When wrapping 
an item with bubble wrap, wrap it one way and then the other, and 
then affix some packing tape to make your item an impenetrable ball. 
Depending on your product, you may have to carry two sizes of bubble 
wrap to properly protect the goods. Bubble wrap is reasonably priced 
(check out the many vendors on eBay) and adds next to no weight to 
your packages.

 When you purchase bubble wrap, be sure you buy the perforated, or 
tear-off, kind. Cutting a giant roll of bubble wrap with a box cutter can be 
a dangerous proposition.
 
✦ Plain old white newsprint: In the right shipping situation, plain white 
newsprint is fantastic. eBay sellers dealing in glass, china, and breakable 
knick-knacks often use white newsprint to wrap each piece before plac-
ing it in a box full of packing peanuts.
 
 White newsprint is cheap and easy to store. The bad news? It’s heavy 
and sellers often use too many sheets to wrap the items they pack. If 
you feel you must use newsprint, I suggest you buy it by the roll and use 
a table-mounted roll cutter to cut the exact size you need. (This is the 
kind of thing you may have seen in old-style butcher shops and delis.) 
This setup helps you to avoid using too much paper.
 
✦ Styrofoam packing peanuts: Every serious eBay seller has to have a 
stock of packing peanuts. When properly placed in a box, peanuts fill 
every nook and cranny and cushion your shipment to make it virtually 
indestructible. They’re handy for padding Tyvek envelopes and filling 
boxes so that items don’t shift around. A bonus: They’re cheap and if 
you recycle them, they don’t hurt the environment.
 
 When packing with peanuts, the key is to not go short in the land of 
plenty. Use enough peanuts to fill the box completely; leaving any air-
space defeats the point of using the peanuts in the first place.
More packing supplies
Your shipping department needs just a few more items. Don’t forget to 
include the following at the outset of your packing career:
 
✦ Plastic bags: Buy plastic bags in bulk to save money. Make sure you buy 
various sizes and use them for both shipping and storing. Even large 
kitchen or trash bags are good for wrapping up posters and large items; 
the plastic protects the item from inclement weather by waterproofing 
the item.
 
✦ Two- or three-inch-wide shipping tape: You’ll need clear tape for 
securing packages and to place over address labels to protect them 
from scrapes and rain. I once received a package with an address label 
soaked with rain and barely legible. Don’t risk a lost package for want of 
a few inches of tape.
 
✦ Hand-held tape dispenser: You need a way to get the tape off the roll 
and onto the box. Using a tape dispenser can be a bit tricky to the unini-
tiated, but once you get than hang of it, you’ll be sealing up boxes in no 
time flat!

Shipping in mailing envelopes
You’ll be shipping your stuff in an envelope or a box. Don’t be quick to dis-
count shipping in envelopes. Any item under 13 ounces can be shipped via 
First Class mail — and that can represent quite a savings.
Mailing envelopes come in many types of materials. Some are sturdier than 
others. Here’s what many eBay sellers use:
 
✦ Polyvinyl envelopes: If you’ve ever ordered clothing or bedding from 
any of the television-shopping clubs, this is what they came in. Polyvinyl 
envelopes are lightweight and puncture- and tear-resistant. They are the 
most durable envelopes available. Who says you have to ship in boxes?
 
✦ Tyvek envelopes: You know those really cool, indestructible white 
envelopes you get from the post office or FedEx? They’re made of 
DuPont Tyvek, a spun-bonded olefin fiber. Tyvek has all the benefits of 
vinyl envelopes, plus it breathes (allows air to reach your product) and 
has a higher strength-to-weight ratio than other envelope materials. 
(That “ratio” business means it’s very strong, yet feather-light.)
 
✦ Bubble-padded mailers: These envelopes are lined with small bubbles, 
similar to bubble wrap. They’re great for shipping a variety of items and 
are the most popular with eBay sellers (see Figure 1-5).
Storing shipping supplies is the tricky part. I 
store peanuts in the bags they were shipped 
in (note the ones in the figure) or in 33-gallon 
plastic trash bags, and then hang the bags on 
cup hooks around the garage ceiling. (By the 
way, bags of peanuts make great bumpers in 
the garage.) To store my bubble wrap from 
Bubblefast, I hung a broomstick with wire 
from the rafters. I made the broomstick into a 
dispenser (of sorts).

 Bubble-lined mailers come in different materials:
 
• Plain-paper bubble mailers are the cheapest way to go, but they can 
be damaged in the mail if you use them to ship heavy items. The 
way around that problem is to wrap cheap, clear packing tape once 
around the envelope in each direction.
 
• Vinyl bubble mailers aren’t expensive and are a super protective way 
to ship. They’re 15 percent lighter than paper bubble mailers and are 
water-resistant.
Printing labels on your printer is convenient 
until you start sending out a dozen packages 
at a time — then cutting the paper and taping 
the label gets too time-consuming. Plus, those 
cut-out labels are not professional. I highly rec-
ommend you do yourself a favor and get a label 
printer. Yes, they can be expensive, but you 
can find some great deals on eBay. I bought 
my heavy-duty, professional Eltron Zebra 2844 
thermal label printer on eBay for one-fourth the 
retail price. (Search eBay for zebra 2844.) It’s 
saved me countless hours. Another good label 
printer for beginners is the Dymo LabelWriter.

 If you send items that can fit nicely into bubble-padded envelopes, 
use them. This type of envelope is perfect for mailing small items or 
clothing using First Class mail. The envelopes are available in quantity 
(an economical choice) and don’t take up much storage space. Table 1-1 
shows you the industry-standard sizes of bubble envelopes and their 
suggested use.

Boxing your items
Depending on the size of the items you sell, you can purchase boxes in bulk at 
reliable sources. Because you have a resale number, look in your local yellow 
pages for wholesale boxes (you still have to pay tax, but the resale number 
identifies you as a business and often can result in lower prices). Try to pur-
chase from a manufacturer that specializes in B2B (business-to-business) 
sales. Some box companies specialize in selling to the occasional box user.
 
You also need to know a little about what it takes to make a sturdy box. The 
de facto standard for quality in general-use shipping boxes is 200-pound 
double-wall corrugated.

You can get six sizes of Priority Mail boxes imprinted with the eBay logo 
from the United States Postal Service Zone on eBay at ebaysupplies.
usps.com. However, think twice before you do this. What would look more 
inviting to a postal thief? A plain package? Or one that is clearly an eBay pur-
chase? I polled some major PowerSellers on this subject and they recom-
mend against using them.
To order your boxes, labels, forms, and just about anything else that 
you’ll need to ship Priority Mail, go to the Postal Store (see Figure 1-6) at 
http://shop.usps.com/. Orders can take a month or so to arrive, so be 
sure to order early.

In 1999, the United States Postal Service announced a new service: 
information-based indicia (IBI), postage that you can print on envelopes and 
labels right from your PC. In this section, I give you the lowdown on the main 
Internet postage vendors: Endicia.com, Stamps.com, and the post office’s 
own Click-N-Ship.
 
I’m a savvy enough consumer and businesswoman that I don’t believe in 
paying for extras — nor do I believe in being a victim of hidden charges. The 
online postage arena — while providing helpful tools that make running your 
eBay business easier — is fraught with bargains, deals, and introductory 
offers. I urge you to read these offers carefully so you know what you’re get-
ting yourself into: Evaluate how much it will cost you to start and to maintain 
an ongoing relationship with the company. Although you may initially get 
some free hardware and pay a low introductory rate, the fine print might tell 
you that you have agreed to pay unreasonably high monthly prices six 
months down the line. I always double-check pricing before getting into any-
thing, and I urge you to do the same.

Click-N-Ship from the USPS
Your old pal the United States Postal Service has Web tools that enable you 
to print your postage and get Priority Mail delivery confirmation free of 
charge (that’s right — no more $.65 each). You can’t print postage for Media 
Mail, Parcel Post, or First Class mail through this service. One caveat: This 
is a no-frills online service, and you often get what you pay for. You have to 
download software to your computer to use this service, and you can’t print 
the labels on a label printer. (You can print two or more labels on 8
1⁄2 x 11 
label sheets. You may also print on regular 8
1⁄2 x 11 paper.)
Click-N-Ship has the following benefits:
 
✦ Online address book: The address book stores up to 1000 addresses.
 
✦ E-mail ship notification: You can send recipients an e-mail notifying 
them that a package is on its way.
 
✦ Shipping cart: You can print up to ten domestic labels with a single 
credit card transaction.
 
✦ Shipping history section: Your shipping history for the past six months 
is stored online for easy access.

At the beginning of PC graphics in the early ’90s, I attended a cutting-edge 
industry trade show. I had a successful graphics-and-advertising business, 
so I was interested in the latest and greatest innovations to bring my busi-
ness off the light table and onto my computer. In a smallish booth were a 
couple of guys peddling new software that enabled artists to design direct-
mail pieces from the desktop. Wow! What an innovation! Their inexpensive 
software even let you produce your own bar-coding for the post office. I fell 
in love with that software and used it throughout my graphics career.
Yes! Some things are free! If you print elec-
tronic postage for just one Priority Mail or

✦ Print postage for all classes of mail, including international: From 
Anniston, Alabama, to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, the DAZzle software not 
only prints postage but also lists all your shipping options and appli-
cable rates. For international mailing, it also advises you as to any prohi-
bitions (for example, no prison-made goods can be mailed to Botswana), 
restrictions, necessary customs forms, and areas served within the 
country.
 
✦ Print customs forms: You no longer have to go to the post office with 
your international packages. Just print the customs form from the 
DAZzle software and give the package to your letter carrier.
 
✦ Free delivery confirmations on Priority mail: Delivery confirmations 
may be printed also for First Class, Parcel Post, and Media Mail for only 
$.16 each (a savings of $.57 from post-office retail purchases).
 
✦ Mailpiece design: Endicia Internet postage is based on DAZzle, an 
award-winning mailpiece design tool that lets you design envelopes, 
postcards, and labels with color graphics, logos, pictures, text mes-
sages, and rubber stamps. You can print your mailing label with postage 
and delivery confirmation on anything from plain paper (tape it on with 
clear tape) to fancy 4 x 6 labels in a label printer from their extensive list 
of label templates.
 
✦ Integration with insurance: If you’ve saving time and money using U-PIC 
(a private package insurer — see Chapter 3) or Endicia’s own insurance, 
you can send your monthly insurance logs electronically at the end of 
the month — a service integrated into the DAZzle software. There’s no 
need to print a hard copy and mail in this information.
 
✦ No cut-and-paste necessary: Endicia integrates with most common 
software programs. With their DAZzle software open on your computer, 
highlight the buyer’s address from an e-mail or the PayPal site and press 
Ctrl+C. The address automatically appears in the DAZzle postage soft-
ware. No pasting needed.
Endicia.com offers two levels of service. All the features just listed come 
with the standard plan. Their premium plan adds customizable e-mail, 
enhanced online transaction reports and statistics, business reply mail, 
return shipping labels (prepaid so your customer won’t have to pay for the 
return), and stealth indicias.
 
The stealth indicia (also known as the postage-paid indicia) is an awesome 
tool for the eBay seller. By using this feature, your customer will not see 
the exact amount of postage you paid. This allows you to add reasonable 
shipping and handling costs and not inflame the buyer when they see the 
final label.

With all these features, you’d think that endicia’s service would be expen-
sive, but it’s not. The standard plan is $9.95 a month, and the premium 
plan is $15.95 a month. For a free 60-day trial just for my readers, go to my

PayPal shipping services
PayPal continues to add great features for sellers. Now you cannot only buy 
postage and ship with UPS through PayPal but also print labels on your own 
printer. If you ship lots of items and use a different service for printing your 
postage, PayPal allows you to input the tracking information on the site. Just 
click the Details link for the transaction, and then click the Add button that 
appears, as shown in Figure 1-9. Input the USPS, UPS, or other shipping com-
pany’s tracking or delivery-confirmation information, and PayPal sends an 
e-mail to your buyer with that information.
The information you added appears in both the record of your PayPal trans-
action and the buyer’s record in their account, as shown in Figure 1-10. (You 
can check the information by clicking the Details link again.)
PayPal shipping services work great when you’re just starting out in your 
eBay business — but after you get rolling, you need a mailing service that 
includes e-mail and recordkeeping, such as Endicia.com or Stamps.com. 
The issue connected with using PayPal for shipping is important: When you 
process your shipping (UPS or USPS) on PayPal, the shipping amount is 
deducted from your PayPal (sales revenue) balance.

If you’re starting a business in earnest, you need to keep track of your online 
expenses separately. Allowing PayPal to deduct your shipping costs from 
your incoming revenue creates a bookkeeping nightmare. You need to have 
exact figures for expenses and income — and it helps keep confusion to a 
minimum when your deposits (withdrawals from your PayPal account to 
your bank) match your sales receipts. If you want to ship through PayPal, be 
sure you withdraw your sales amount to your checking account before you 
process your shipping. That way your shipping can be charged to your busi-
ness credit card for easier tracking.
To purchase postage and print your label for a specific purchase, click 
the Print Shipping Label button next to the payment record in your PayPal 
account overview, as shown in Figure 1-11. You’ll be taken through a step-by-

on your printer.

Stamps.com
Stamps.com purchased 31 Internet postage patents from e-stamp, making its 
services a combination of the best of both sites. (e-stamp discontinued its 
online postage service late in 2000; I was a big fan.) Many eBay sellers moved 
their postage business over to Stamps.com.
Stamps.com works with software that you probably use every day, such as 
Microsoft Word, Outlook, and Office; Corel WordPerfect; Palm Desktop; and 
Quicken. Here are some features you might enjoy:
 
✦ Use your printer to print postage: If your printer allows it, you can 
even print your envelopes along with bar-coded addresses, your return 
address, and postage. This saves quite a bit in label costs.
 
 The Stamps.com Envelope Wizard permits you to design your own enve-
lopes, including a logo or graphics. You can purchase a box of 500 #10 
envelopes for as little as $4.99 at an office-supply store. (Endicia.com 
provides a more robust envelope-graphics wizard.)
 
✦ Have Stamps.com check that your addresses are valid: Before printing 
any postage, the Stamps.com software contacts the USPS database of 
every valid mailing address in the United States. This Address Matching 
System (AMS) is updated monthly.
 
✦ Have Stamps.com add the extra four digits to your addressee’s ZIP 
code: This nifty feature helps ensure swift delivery while freeing you of 
the hassle of having to look up the information.

Purchasing postage is as easy as going to www.stamps.com and clicking

Stamps.com, you don’t need any extra fancy equipment, although most intro-

a seller on eBay or through Office Depot.
 
Because Office Depot delivers any order more than $50 free the next day, it’s 
a great place to get paper and labels. Better buys on scales, though, can be 
found on eBay, especially if you search postage scale. I use a super-small, 
13-pound-maximum scale manufactured by Escali that I bought on eBay for 
only $29.95, complete with a five-year warranty.
Stamps.com charges a flat rate of $15.99 per month. The site regularly 
offers sign-up bonuses that include as much as $20.00 free postage or a free 
5-pound-maximum digital postage scale. To find the Stamps.com deal of the 
month, visit its Web site.

I
 think the best part of eBay is making the sale and receiving payment. 
After that comes the depressing and tedious process of fulfilling your 
orders. You shouldn’t feel bad if this is the point that makes you pause and 
sigh. Order fulfillment is one of the biggest problems (and yuckiest chores) 
that face any mail-order or online enterprise.
But as an eBay businessperson, you must attend to these tasks, however 
much you’d rather not. In this chapter, you explore your shipping options. 
I give you the lowdown on the three major carriers — FedEx, UPS, and the 
U.S. Postal Service — so you can see who fits your requirements. (For the 
scoop on insurance coverage, see Chapter 3.) 
Shipping: The Heart of Your Business
Shipping can be the most time-consuming (and dreaded) task for eBay sell-
ers. Even if the selling portion of your transaction goes flawlessly, the item 
has to get to the buyer in one piece. If it doesn’t, the deal could be ruined — 
and so could your reputation.
The best way to avoid shipping problems is to do your homework before-
hand, determine which method is likely to work best, and spell out in your 
item description exactly how you intend to ship the item. I always say 
“Buyer pays shipping, handling, and optional insurance” in my item descrip-
tion, and that’s what I charge, although I can make allowances if the buyer 
wants a specific method of shipment within reason. 

612
Shipping: The Heart of Your Business
Shipping is the heart of a mail-order business like yours and can make or 
break a successful transaction. Don’t even think of selling an item without 
evaluating your shipping options:
 
1. After the sale, get the package ready to ship.
 
 You don’t have to seal the package right away, but you should have it 
ready to seal because the two critical factors in shipping are weight and 
time. The more a package weighs and the faster it has to be delivered, 
the higher the charge. The time to think about packing and shipping is 
before you put the item up for auction.
I just had to share this with you! The figure 
shows a picture of an envelope I received on 
an eBay purchase. I had to e-mail the seller 
to find out how and why she used so many 
stamps.
The seller is a collector of U.S. postage. She 
checks out eBay auctions and buys deals on 
old sheets of mint state stamps. United States 
stamps, no matter how old, are always good, 
so she buys these stamps at discount and uses 
them on her eBay packages. However, she did 
mention that when she brings her packages to 
the post office, all the clerks scatter to take a 
break!
As a footnote, I just checked eBay and found a 
whole lot of United States postage stamps sell-
ing for under face value! Like a 1997 NM Mars 
Rover (Pathfinder) $3.00 Sheetlet that went for 
$1.80. The hint to finding these deals is to search 
for the type of stamp — but don’t include the 
word stamp in your keyword search — and 
then select the Stamps category. I guess some 
sellers will never learn.
U.S. postage at a big discount!

2. Know your carrier options.
 
 In the United States, the three main shipping options for most eBay 
transactions are the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS. See the section 
“Shopping for a Shipper” (try saying that five times fast) for informa-
tion on how you can get rate options from each service, painlessly and 
online. 
 
3. Before quoting the shipping fees, make sure that you include all 
appropriate costs.
 
 I recommend that you charge a nominal handling fee (up to $1.50 isn’t 
out of line — even more under special circumstances) to cover your 
packing materials, which can add up quickly as you start making mul-
tiple transactions. You should also include any insurance costs and 
delivery-confirmation costs. (For more on insurance and delivery confir-
mation, see Chapter 3.)
 
 eBay’s policy reads:
 
 “Sellers may charge a reasonable shipping and handling fee to the final 
price of their item, provided that this fee is disclosed up front in the list-
ing. A shipping and handling fee can cover the seller’s reasonable costs 
for mailing, packaging and handling the item. Shipping and handling fees 
cannot be listed as a percentage of the final sale price.”
 
 It’s best to post a flat shipping amount (or use the eBay online shipping 
calculator) to give buyers an idea of how much shipping will be. This 
way, buyers can include this cost when they consider their bidding 
strategies. Figure out what the packed item will weigh and then estimate 
shipping costs; the online calculators can help.
 
 Keep in mind, though, that if your idea of a reasonable handling fee 
doesn’t gel with your buyers, you may end up with a ding in your DSR 
feedback rating for shipping fees.
 
 If the item is particularly heavy and you need to use a specialized ship-
ping service, be sure to say in your listing description that you’re just 
giving an estimate and that the final cost will be determined prior to 
shipping. Optionally, you could tell the bidder how much the item 
weighs, where you’re shipping from, and what your handling charges are 
(a few bidders don’t mind doing the math).
 
 Occasionally, shipping calculations can be off target, and you may not 
know that until after you take the buyer’s money. If the mistake is in 
your favor and is a biggie, notify the buyer and offer a refund. But if ship-
ping ends up costing you a bit more, take your lumps and pay it. You 
can always let the buyer know what happened and that you paid the 
extra cost. Who knows, it may show up on your feedback from the 
buyer! (Even if it doesn’t, spreading goodwill never hurts.)

614
Shopping for a Shipper
 
4. E-mail the buyer and congratulate him or her on winning; reiterate 
your shipping choice and how long you expect shipping will take.
 
 Make sure you’re both talking about the same timetable. If the buyer 
balks at either the price or the shipping time, try working out an option 
that will make the buyer happy.
 
5. Send the package.
 
 When should you ship the package? Common courtesy says it should 
go out as soon as the item and shipping charges are paid. If the buyer 
has followed through with his or her side of the bargain, you should do 
the same. Ship that package no more than a day or so after payment (or 
after the E-check clears). If you can’t, immediately e-mail the buyer and 
explain the delay.
 
Send a prompt follow-up e-mail to let the buyer know the item’s on the way. 
In this e-mail, include when the item was sent, how long it should take to 
arrive, any special tracking number (if you have one), and a request for a 
return e-mail confirming arrival after the item gets there. I also include a 
thank-you note (a receipt would be a businesslike addition) in each package 
I send out. I appreciate when I get one in an eBay package, and it always 
brings a smile to the recipient’s face. It never hurts to take every opportu-
nity to promote goodwill (and future business and positive feedback).
 
More often than not, you do get an e-mail back from the buyer to let you 
know the item arrived safely. If you don’t, it doesn’t hurt to send another 
e-mail (in about a week) to ask whether the item arrived in good condition. It 
jogs the buyer’s memory and demonstrates your professionalism as a seller. 
Use this opportunity to gently remind buyers that you’ll be leaving positive 
feedback for them. Ask whether they’re satisfied, and don’t be bashful about 
suggesting they do the same for you. Leave positive feedback right away so 
you don’t forget.
Shopping for a Shipper
When you’re considering shipping options, you must first determine what 
types of packages you’ll generally be sending (small packages that weigh 
less than two pounds or large and bulky packages) and then decide how 
you’ll send your items. Planning this before listing the item is a good idea.
Deciding on your carrier can be the most important decision in your eBay 
business. You need to decide which one is more convenient for you (located 
close to your home base, provides pick up service, gives better customer 
service) and which is the most economical. Settling on one main shipper to 
meet most of your needs is important because all your records will be on 
one statement or in one area. However, you might also need a secondary 
shipper for special types of packages. 

Book VII
Chapter 2

615
Shopping for a Shipper
Shipping can make or break your customer service. Whoever delivers the 
package to the buyer is an extension of your company. Professional labels, 
clean boxes, nifty packing peanuts — those are the things you control. Safe 
and timely delivery falls into the hands of complete strangers, but the buyer 
will blame you for the tardiness or sloppiness of the shipping. Your bottom 
line isn’t the shipper’s, and no matter how many refunds they offer when 
they don’t meet their promised schedules, it won’t help when you have irate 
customers. Simple equation: Irate customers = lousy feedback.
So, what’s a seller to do? Do you use the shipper that other sellers rave 
about? Perhaps opt for convenience or low price? Once you decide on a 
shipper, how often do you re-evaluate its services? 
The rest of the chapter will help you with this decision.
Meeting your front line
Who constitutes the front line of your eBay business? My shipping front line 
is Scott, the UPS man; Tim, the Post Office carrier; and Jorge, who picks up 
for FedEx Ground. I know the front-line guys because they help my eBay 
business run smoothly. They don’t leave deliveries outside under a bush, and 
they always deliver packages to my neighbor if I’m not home. They pick up my 
sundry packages with a smile and a lighthearted “They’re sure buying things 
on eBay, aren’t they?” I respond with a smile and a bit of friendly chitchat.
Wait, are you telling me that you don’t get the same service? Have you ever 
taken a moment to chat with your delivery person? When you personalize a 
business relationship (such as addressing them by name), you become more 
than a street address, you become . . . well . . . a person. When you’re no 
longer a number, you become a fellow human being with needs and wants. 
Believe it or not, people want to make other people happy.
I leave a signal when there are packages to be picked up, and every one is 
picked up. When somebody delivers a big box, it goes to the back door near 
my studio, so I don’t have to drag it through the front door and across the 
house.
Try building a relationship with your shipping front line. I’ve invited them 
to company holiday parties and offered them a cool drink on a hot summer 
day. The result? My shipping is the easiest part of my business.
Location, location, location
What happens if you have to drop off your packages for shipment? It’s 
important to consider the closest local drop-off point for your carrier. Each 
of the major carriers has a search feature on its Web site to find the nearest 
drop-off location. You input your address or zip code, and the feature tells 
you the locations closest to you.

616
Shopping for a Shipper
To get the location lowdown quickly, go to the following sites:
 
✦ FedEx: www.fedex.com/us/dropoff
 
✦ USPS: www.usps.com/locator/welcome.htm/
 
✦ UPS: www.ups.com/dropoff
 
Be sure to read the details about each location online. Different fees may be 
involved in dropping off packages. Some locations may accept certain types 
of packages and not others. Read the fine print.
Comparing prices
The consensus is that a particular method of shipping is cheaper for large 
items and another is cheaper for small packages. Each method has its own 
peculiarities. 
Take a look at Table 2-1 and compare the pricing for certain types of pack-
ages. Know that there are extras for some services, so become familiar with 
the variations and hidden costs. For example, FedEx and UPS include track-
ing numbers for delivery confirmation, but USPS charges extra (delivery 
confirmation is $.45 for Priority Mail and $.55 for Media Mail, First Class, and 
Parcel Post).

You, Too, Can Use Federal Express
 
There are further discounts when printing your USPS postage electronically. 
Priority Mail will save an average of 3.5 percent for customers who use elec-
tronic postage.
 
Table 2-1 should get you thinking about your carrier, especially when you 
realize that USPS charges only a tad more money for 2- to 3-day Priority Mail 
service over Parcel Post.
You, Too, Can Use Federal Express
Federal Express (or FedEx, as it’s known to everyone) is world-famous for 
its reliable service. It’s the number-one choice for all major companies 
who “Absolutely, positively have to get it there on time.” FedEx also has a 
reputation for some of the highest costs in the business — but only to the 
untrained eye. FedEx acquired Roadway Package Service (RPS) and formed 
FedEx Ground, which has a separate division called FedEx Home Delivery 
that delivers to residences. For the services they provide, you’ll be happy to 
pay what you do. Read on.
FedEx Ground and Home Delivery
When FedEx’s Home Delivery began, their slogan was “The neighborhood 
friendly service that fits the way we live, work, and shop today.” Although I 
rarely get warm fuzzies from my package delivery, this slogan brought mean-
ing to the philosophy behind their service: to bring professional shipping to 
your home residence. Now FedEx Home Delivery is part of FedEx Ground, 
and offers low rates and high-quality service. They’re the only shipper that 
offers a money-back guarantee on home service. They deliver until 8:00 p.m. 
and on Saturdays, but not on Mondays.
When it comes to shipping heavy or big stuff, 
you have a few options. Because I like using 
FedEx, I check with FedEx Freight first. My hus-
band once purchased four large heavy-equip-
ment tires on eBay, and there was no way they 
could go with a regular carrier. We told the 
seller to place the tires on a pallet and secure 
them. They were picked up by FedEx Freight. 
Shipping was reasonable, but the caveat was 
that the shipment had to be delivered to a place 
of business, not a residential location.
The www.freightquote.com Web site 
negotiates rates with several major freight-
forwarders. Before attempting to sell a heavy 
item, sign on to their Web site with the weight 
and dimensions of your shipment, and they’ll 
give you a free quote on the spot.

home page.
 
Even if you have a current Federal Express account, you need to sign on to 
add the Ground service (which includes Home Delivery). Registering for 
Ground service is even easier than registering on eBay, so give it a shot. 
(Check the next section to see how easy it is.)
I opened my FedEx Ground account through a link on the FedEx home page, 
and got the skinny on how to use the service. FedEx Home Delivery gives 
you a service schedule to let you know how long it will take your package to 
arrive at its destination (see Figure 2-2). The online calculator allows you to 
choose the option of home delivery, so you don’t even have to look up alter-
native rates and charts.
Here are a few fast facts about FedEx Ground services:
 
✦ You print your own labels and barcodes for your packages and track 
them online.
 
✦ FedEx Home Delivery works on a zone system based on your ZIP code 
and how far the package is going. Refer to the FedEx Home Delivery zone 
chart or get the cost online through the online calculator.
 
✦ Each shipment is covered for $100.00 in declared value. Additional insur-
ance is $.60 per $100.00 or a fraction thereof.

✦ Residential deliveries are limited to 70-pound packages.
 
✦ Daily pick-up service adds an additional weekly charge of $8.00 to $12.00

✦ Dropping off packages at Federal Express counters (this includes all 
those handy FedEx Kinko’s locations) incurs no additional charge.

To find the closest drop-off location for your FedEx packages, go to www.
fedex.com/us/dropoff and type your ZIP code. Check that the location 
accepts Ground, and check the cutoff times.
Signing up with FedEx
You sign up for a FedEx account only once, but it’s a two-step process. First 
you sign up for a Web site login, and then you sign up for an actual, for-real 
FedEx account. After you have a fedex.com login and account, you’ll be able 
to ship your items quickly from your own private FedEx Web space.
To get a FedEx account and be able to ship right away, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to www.fedex.com/us.
 
2. On the left side of the screen, click the FedEx Ground link.
 
 The FedEx Ground page appears.
 
3. From the FedEx Ground page, click the Ship tab, at the top.
 
 You’ll land at the login page. If you’ve previously signed up for an 
account with a password and user ID, you can log in immediately here. 

620
You, Too, Can Use Federal Express
 
4. If you’re signing up for a new account, click the Sign Up Now! link.
 
5. On the resulting registration page, type the following information:
 
• User ID: Make up an ID you’ll remember. (I tried my eBay user ID and 
it was already taken — I guess they have lots of customers.)
 
• Password: Come up with a password you’ll remember. For tips on 
selecting safe passwords, see Book IX, Chapter 4.
 
• Password reminder: Input your password reminder question and 
answer. This way, if you ever forget your password or have to prove 
your identity to FedEx, you’ll have a mind jogger.
 
• Contact information: Type your name, company name (optional), 
address, city, state, e-mail address, and phone number.
 
• Agree to the terms of use: If you want to ship via FedEx, you must 
agree to their terms. Click the link provided if you want some boring 
legalese to read. When you decide to play by their rules, click I 
Accept.
 
6. Read the FedEx License Agreement (I’m sure you’ll read every word) 
and then click Yes, indicating that you accept the Agreement.
 
 Next you’re asked whether you have a FedEx account number.
 
7. Click the Open a FedEx Account link. 
 
8. Follow the prompts and input your credit-card information.
 
 Finally, you’re presented with your very own nine-digit FedEx account 
number! 
If you want to ship something now, click Start Using FedEx Ship Manager. 
Otherwise, log in later when you’re ready to ship.
FedEx online
FedEx has one of the most intuitive online applications for shipping. The 
FedEx Ship Manager interface will turn your computer into a one-person 
shipping shop. You can search for rate quotes, track packages, and use the 
shipping notification option to send tracking information e-mails to your 
recipients.
To ship your item from the FedEx Web site, just go to the online Ship 
Manager by clicking the Ship tab. You’ll be presented with a simple, all-in-
one online waybill, similar to the one you fill out by hand. Figure 2-3 shows 
you what it looks like.
 
You can copy and paste addresses from your PayPal account into the online 
form. Just highlight the text you want to copy and press Ctrl+C. To paste the 
text, place your cursor in the area you want to fill and press Ctrl+V.

When you’re filling out the form, note some important entries:
 
✦ Service type: If you’re shipping to a residence, use the FedEx Home 
Delivery option from the drop-down list.
 
✦ Dimensions: Be sure that you know the proper dimensions for the pack-
age you’re sending.
 
 If you sell repeat items in your eBay business, why not measure the 
boxes ahead of time and keep a list near your computer so you’ll know 
the size? (For example: Light kit 14 x 12 x 26.)
 
✦ FedEx Ship Alert: Select the e-mail option to send the buyer (and your-
self) a notice that the package was shipped. Add a personal message so 
that the e-mail won’t have a cold automated feel to it.
After you fill out the form, you can click the Courtesy Rate button at the 
bottom to get a shipping-cost estimate (not including any special discounts).
 
When shipping with FedEx online, if your package is valued over $100.00 and 
you use U-PIC for your insurance (see Chapter 3), put $0 in the Declared 
Value box. Make note of the package on an insurance log and submit it to 
U-PIC. (FedEx charges $.60 cents per $100.00 in value but U-PIC charges only 
$.15 per $100.00.)

I’m a big fan of the U.S. Postal Service. Just ask my wonderful letter (er, mul-
tiple parcel) carrier, Tim. I use the post office for the bulk of my eBay sales 
because it’s convenient. In my eight years selling items on eBay, they’ve 
never lost a package. 
The USPS is open to everyone. You don’t have to set up an account to use its 
services. To get a basic idea of what you’ll pay to send a package, you can 
access a rate calculator on the USPS Web site (www.usps.com), shown in

test materials, sound recordings, scripts, and computer-
recorded media such as CD-ROMs and diskettes.
Read on for details on the most popular forms of mail used by eBay sellers.
First Class
Good old regular mail — in particular, First Class — is the way we send bills 
and letters. It works also as an economical alternative for eBay items up to 
13 ounces. When you print your postage online with some services, you can 
get a delivery confirmation for First Class mail for only $.18.
Too many sellers make the jump to Priority Mail because they don’t take the 
time to think about the weight of their items. It doesn’t have to ship in an 
envelope to go via First Class mail.
Priority Mail
The 2- to 3-day Priority Mail service is the most popular form of shipping for 
eBay packages. You can get free cartons, mailing tape, and labels from the 
post office. (See Chapter 1 for a complete list of what the USPS supplies for 
your mailing needs.) You can also print postage online through endicia.com 
or stamps.com (see Chapter 1 again).

624
Shipping with USPS
The Priority Mail rates are perfect for 1-pound packages ($4.80 flat-rate 
cross-country) and 2-pound packages (from $4.80, based on distance). They 
also have a flat-rate Priority envelope in which you can jam in as much as 
possible (regardless of the package’s final weight) for $4.80. 
Because USPS rates are based on distance and weight, you can save money 
by using their new flat-rate Priority Mail boxes. I’ve been able to jam quite 
a bit into them and it’s a deal at a flat rate of $9.80 (and $12.95 for an even 
larger Flat Rate box) anywhere in the United States.
The Priority Mail rates (including free shipping materials) are attractive until 
you get into heavier packages. Also, if you don’t print your postage online, 
delivery confirmation costs you an additional $.65 for Priority Mail ($.75 for 
Parcel Post and Media Mail). Delivery confirmation tells you only if the pack-
age was delivered; it doesn’t trace the package along its route.
Parcel Post
If you want to use the USPS and have a heavy package (up to 70 pounds) that 
doesn’t fit the requirements for Media Mail, use Parcel Post. Since the 2008 
rate changes, USPS Parcel Post rates can be highly competitive when you 
compare them to the UPS or FedEx Ground rates.
Media Mail
To stay new and hip, the post office has renamed its old Book Rate to Media 
Mail, causing many eBay sellers to mistakenly miss out on this valuable mail-
ing tool. The savings are immense. The drawback is that you must mail only 
books, cassettes, videos, or computer-readable media. Transit time on Media 
Mail is at least 7 to 10 days, but the cost savings on heavy packages may be 
worth it — as long as your customers realize how long transit time can be. 
Understanding the costs
The Postal Service levies additional charges for some often-used services 
but also gives free services to online postage customers:
 
✦ Pickup: If you have a postal license and print your own postage from an 
online service (see Chapter 1) or print direct from eBay or the PayPal 
site, the post office offers free pickup, as shown in Figure 2-5. You have 
to give your packages to your carrier at the time of your regular delivery 
or schedule a pickup on the USPS site at 
http://www.usps.com/shipping/carrierpickup/welcome.htm

✦ Insurance: This guarantees that you’re covered if your package doesn’t 
arrive safely and will reimburse you up to the value you declare when 
purchasing the insurance, up to a maximum of $5000.00. If your package 
gets lost or severely mangled in shipping, the Postal Service will, after a 
thorough investigation (see Chapter 3), pay your claim. Fees start at $1.70 
for packages up to $50.00. For discounted insurance, read Chapter 3. 
 
✦ Delivery confirmation: Delivery confirmation provides you with proof 
of delivery or attempted delivery. You can purchase delivery confirma-
tion for $.65 (for Priority Mail) or $.75 (Parcel Post) at the post office 
when you mail a package. They provide you with a tracking number that 
you can check online at
www.usps.com/shipping/trackandconfirm.htm
 
 You can also verify a package’s delivery by calling a toll-free number, 
800-222-1811.

Getting on the UPS Bandwagon
Today’s UPS is a $30 billion company focusing on enabling commerce 
around the world. Every day UPS delivers more than 13.3 million packages 
and documents — I’m sure much of which represents eBay transactions. 
 
UPS considers neither Saturday nor Sunday to be delivery days. So when 
your package is quoted for a 5-day delivery and the 5 days cross over a 
weekend, add 2 days to the delivery schedule. (The USPS and FedEx Ground 
deliver on Saturday.)
Here are some quick facts about UPS:
 
✦ Shipping with UPS requires that you pay a different rate for different 
zones in the country (zones 1–8). The cost of your package is based 
on its weight, your zip code (where there package ships from), and the 
addressee’s ZIP code (where the package is going). To figure out your 
cost, use the handy UPS cost calculator shown in Figure 2-6.
 
✦ UPS offers a chart that defines the shipping time for your ground 
shipments.
 
✦ Each package has a tracking number that you can input online to verify 
location and time of delivery.
 
✦ Delivery to a residence costs over $1.00 per pound more than delivery 
to a commercial location.
 
✦ UPS delivers packages Monday through Friday.
The United States Postal Service is the nation’s 
largest transportation entity, delivering to 
close to 130 million addresses per day. The 
USPS sought partners who could help with 
long-haul transportation of the mail; the USPS 
would handle the local delivery. In 1996, DHL 
SmartMail signed on as a forwarder of mail. 
They ship mail — envelopes or parcels — from 
high-volume shippers.
Many high-level PowerSellers take advantage 
of the DHL SmartMail service. When you’re 
sending out hundreds of small items a day, you 
can save big time using this service for your 
shipping. For more information, visit their Web 
site at
 
 http://www.smartmail.com/
service_services.asp
Just type your ZIP code and the site will 
generate a custom zone chart for your mailing 
location.

Comparing costs
Although we always complain when the U.S. Postal Service raises their rates, 
you should know that all other shipping carriers raise their rates every year.
 
Annual rate increases are why being lulled into complacency can be danger-
ous. Evaluate your shipping charges and your shipper’s fees every year to 
keep up with the increases and possible cuts into your bottom line.
UPS charges a different rate for home delivery than they do for deliveries to 
a business. In their last rate increase, residential delivery took the biggest 
hit. The premium for Home Delivery rose 22 percent; the previous year it 
was 4.5 percent. That’s a raise from $1.10 to $1.95 in just two years.
While we all think that UPS Ground is cheaper than the post office, it’s not 
true in every case. Check out Table 2-3 for a summary of FedEx and UPS rate 
increases.

Every UPS package is automatically insured for up to $100 assuming you 
declare a value. Insurance up to the first $300 is $1.80. After the first $300, it 
runs $.60 per $100. The post office charges extra for the service, but you can 
save money either way by using a private insurance policy for your packages 
(see Chapter 3).
The de-facto standard for eBay shipping is Priority Mail. Compared to UPS 
3-Day Select, Priority Mail is the clear cost-saving winner if you must ship 
packages for swift delivery.
For heavier packages, UPS is considerably cheaper than Parcel Post for 
packages over 6 pounds. After your packages pass that point, and if time is 
not of the essence, UPS may be the best way to go.
Variable UPS rates
When you ship via UPS and are trying to figure out how to get the best rates, 
you have quite a conundrum. UPS basically has three rates for small-time 
shippers:
 
✦ Retail rate: This is the rate you pay when you go to the UPS Customer 
Center and they create the label for you. It’s the most expensive. With 
the eBay/PayPal solution, you can save yourself some bucks by printing 
your own bar-coded labels and dropping the packages at the Customer 
Center or giving the packages to a UPS driver. 
 
✦ On demand rate: Use UPS for the rare large box or heavy shipment. An 
on demand, or occasional, shipper can call UPS for a next-day pickup. 
You have to pay an additional $4 per package for the driver to pick up 
from you if you don’t feel like bringing the package to the UPS local 
counter.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Shipping without 
Going Postal
629
Getting on the UPS Bandwagon
 
✦ Pickup account: When you hit the big time, you’re able to get the lowest 
UPS rates and have a driver make daily stops to pick up your packages. 
Fees for a pickup account run from $7 to $16 per week (based on the 
amount of packages you ship each week) over the cost of your package 
shipping. 
Saving by getting heavier packages picked up
Are you suffering from the delusion that it costs a bundle to have regular 
UPS package pickup service? (I was, too.) Surprise, it doesn’t, as you’ll see.
As shown in Table 2-4, fees for UPS pickup service are on a sliding scale 
from $7.00 to $16.00, based on the amount of postage that you use in a week. 
Shipping seven 10-pound packages coast-to-coast or eight 5-pound packages 
would easily meet the weekly minimum of $60.00 in postage. If you’re selling 
heavier items on eBay, UPS service with package pickup wins over the post 
office, hands down!

If you have daily pickup service, you’d net a savings of close to $2 per pack-
age, as shown in Table 2-5. You must print your labels directly from the UPS 
Web site and have a preprinted manifest ready for the driver.

Shipping Directly from PayPal
I consider PayPal to be de rigueur (a must have, to all you non-French speak-
ers) for all eBay sellers. By using PayPal, a seller can streamline the buyer’s 
shopping experience, making it simple to buy, click, and pay. Those out in 
the eBay world who haven’t used PayPal find using the service to be a life-
changing experience. Along with all the timesaving tools PayPal supplies 
for the seller, they now offer online shipping services for items through the 
United States Postal Service or UPS at no extra charge. This is a convenient 
system for those who don’t ship many packages each week because there’s 
no need to use additional software or sign up with an additional service. 
But (I hate the buts — don’t you?) the PayPal postage system can make book-
keeping a nightmare for large-scale shippers. That’s because PayPal with-
draws the postage amounts directly from your PayPal account balance. This 
is problematic because your books won’t balance: Your final deposits won’t 
match your posted eBay or Web sales. 
 
You can make this work more efficiently by posting your PayPal sales to 
your bookkeeping program and then withdrawing your money before pro-
cessing your shipping. Then simply charge your shipping to a credit card, 
which will help you balance your books at month’s end. 
When you’re ready to deal with shipping, you simply sign on to your PayPal 
account and handle it right on the site. To begin the shipping process, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Log in to your PayPal account page.
 
2. Click the Ship button next to the item in the row. 
 
 You arrive at the page shown in Figure 2-7.

3. Choose which method of shipping you’d like to use: U.S. Postal Service 
or UPS.

PayPal shipping with the USPS
If you plan to use the ever-popular United States Postal Service, printing 
your postage and label through PayPal gives you a free delivery confirmation 
with Priority Mail. A delivery confirmation is available also for Media Mail, 
Parcel Post, and First Class mail for a minimal charge.
After you’ve chosen USPS as your shipper, you’ll see a confirmation page simi-
lar to the one shown in Figure 2-8. At the top of the page (not pictured) your 
mailing address and the ship-to address are listed. After you’ve confirmed that 
this information is correct, fill out the details of the form, including
 
✦ Service type: Choose the level of mailing service you want for your pack-
age from this drop-down list. Priority Mail is usually the standard.
 
✦ Package size: From this drop-down list, select the type of package 
you’re sending. Keep the following in mind:
 
• Package/thick envelope: Your package or envelope qualifies for this 
status if the length and girth (all the way around) is no more than 84 
inches.
 
• Large package: Your package is larger than the preceding category, 
but doesn’t exceed 108 inches in combined length and girth.

632
Shipping Directly from PayPal
 
• USPS flat-rate envelope: These are handy Express and Priority Mail 
envelopes (available free from the USPS; see Chapter 1 for informa-
tion on how to get them delivered to your door). They allow you to 
ship whatever fits into the envelopes at a flat rate, no matter how 
much the package weighs. (If you really stuff them, you can always 
reinforce your envelope with clear shipping tape — I do!)
 
✦ Weight: Here you enter the weight of your package. 
 
✦ Delivery confirmation: Confirmation is free with Priority Mail.
 
✦ Signature confirmation: Signature confirmation provides you a signa-
ture and date of delivery and is available for many levels of service. If 
you’d like a signature confirmation for your package, it will add $1.30 to 
the postage cost. You can request proof of delivery from the USPS online 
or on the phone.
 
 Don’t forget that — if you ship an item with a value over $250 — PayPal 
requires signature confirmation for the item to be covered under the 
PayPal Seller Protection program.
 
✦ Display value of postage on label: If you’d prefer not to show the 
amount of the postage on the label, do not check this box. That way, 
whatever handling fees you charge your customer are transparent.
 
 On the other side of the coin, if you’re trying to be a good seller (so you 
can receive great DSR ratings), you might not want to hide how much 
you actually pay for shipping. That way, the customer can see that you 
haven’t padded the shipping fees to pad your wallet.
 
✦ E-mail message to buyer: Customer service to the fore! Type a nice note 
letting customers know you appreciate their business. This might also 
be a good place to ask them to e-mail you immediately if there are any 
problems with the item when it arrives (a good defense against knee-jerk 
negative feedback).
 
✦ Item(s) being shipped to your buyer: In this area you see the item 
number and name of the item you’re shipping.

PayPal shipping with UPS
Shippers such as UPS charge different rates based on how often you use 
their services. If you’re shipping many packages a week, it might be best if 
you print your labels directly from the UPS site. All PayPal UPS shipments 
are charged the Occasional Shipper rate. If you only use UPS once in a while, 
the PayPal method will work perfectly for you. 
If you’ve selected UPS as your shipper on the PayPal Shipping page, you will 
be brought to a page with these choices:
 
✦ UPS account: You can open a new UPS account immediately online or, if 
you have an existing UPS account number, you may type it in this field.
 
 To open a new account you’ll have to verify your company data (it’s 
already entered here from your PayPal account information) and let UPS 
know approximately how many packages you ship a week. 
 
✦ Shipping payment information: You also have to indicate whether 
you’d like to pay for your shipping with your PayPal account, or if you’d 
like the shipping billed to your existing UPS account.

Chapter 3: Insuring Your 
Item’s Delivery
In This Chapter
✓ Knowing your insurance options
✓ Addressing your packages correctly
✓ Filing a claim with the major carriers
W
hen someone buys an item from you, the buyer assumes that the 
item will be shipped in 24 to 48 hours. A little-known rule of the 
online world is the Federal Trade Commission’s 30-day mail-order rule. This 
rule applies to all online sales, as well as mail-order businesses. It states 
that unless you state a specific shipping time, all items must be shipped 
within 30 days.
Adopted in 1975, the FTC rule proclaims
 
✦ You must receive the merchandise when the seller says you will.
 
✦ If you are not promised delivery within a certain time period, the seller 
must ship the merchandise to you no later than 30 days after your 
order.
 
✦ If you don’t receive the merchandise within that 30-day period, you can 
cancel your order and get your money back.
This rule must be part of the reason why eBay won’t allow items on the site 
for presale (or drop-shipping) unless you can guarantee that the item will 
be shipped within 30 days. In each of those cases, you must indicate in your 
description that the item is a presale or drop-ship.
Another thing comes to light here. Note that the rule states that the mer-
chandise must be delivered in 30 days. The rule doesn’t say “unless the 
item gets lost in the mail.” This means that you, the seller, are responsible 
for your packages arriving at their destinations. This makes insurance more 
important than ever, especially on expensive items.

638
Insurance Options
Insurance Options
When you’re shipping a large amount of merchandise on a regular basis, 
you’re going to have to deal with the issue of whether you offer buyers insur-
ance against damage or loss. Either way, you (the seller) are responsible for 
getting the product to the buyer. The lost-in-the-mail excuse doesn’t cut the 
mustard, and having a delivery-confirmation number doesn’t guarantee any-
thing, either.
 
You may think that it’s the buyers’ responsibility to pay for insurance. If they 
don’t, you say, it’s their hard luck if the package doesn’t arrive. This is far 
from the truth; buyers who don’t receive an item that they’ve paid for can 
file a fraud report against you. Buyers can also have the payment removed 
from your PayPal account, and you have no defense against this.
Again, you’d best realize that the responsibility for delivering the goods is 
in the seller’s hands. So offering insurance to your buyers is good business, 
and including insurance with every shipment is excellent business.
Self-insuring your items
Some sellers on eBay self-insure their packages. In other words, they take 
the risk and use money out of their own pockets if they have to pay a claim. 
In this sense, self-insuring is considered seller’s jargon, not an official legal 
status (only licensed insurance agents can offer insurance).
These sellers are usually careful about packing their items to prevent 
damage. (Check out Chapter 1 to find out about choosing and finding pack-
ing materials.) They also purchase delivery confirmation when using the 
Postal Service.
 
Savvy self-insurers usually do not self-insure items of high value. If you sell 
mostly lower-priced items (under $100) and decide to self-insure, consider 
making an exception when you do occasionally sell an expensive item. Bite 
the bullet and pay for the shipping insurance; doing so could save you 
money and hassle in the long run.
How do you afford to self-insure? Well, tack an additional $1.00 onto every 
item’s postage amount as part of your handling fee. The more items you sell 
and ship, the more that little dollar-per-item profit builds up and gives you 
a fund that you can use to cover the rare instance of a damaged or missing 
item.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Insuring Your 
Item’s Delivery
639
Insurance Options
 
This method of building your self-insurance fund may be a risky proposition — 
especially if you get hit with two expensive lost items in a row! But if you sell a 
lot of items for under $100, you might find that this works for you.
Insuring through the major carriers
All the major shippers are in the shipping business (duh), not in the insur-
ance business. Insuring is an annoying — but necessary — sideline to their 
package transit businesses.
Most carriers, other than the United States Postal Service, cover all ship-
ments automatically (and at no extra charge) for the first $100 of package 
value. By the way, the package value of an item sold on eBay is the final bid 
(or Buy It Now) amount. Of course, you can always buy additional package 
insurance for your shipped items. Should a package get lost or damaged, 
making a claim opens an entirely new can of worms.
Table 3-1 shows you what the major carriers charge for their additional 
insurance.
Sure, “lost in the mail” is an excuse we’ve all 
heard hundreds of times, but despite every-
one’s best efforts, sometimes things do get 
damaged or misplaced during shipment. The 
universe is a dangerous place; that’s why we 
have insurance. I usually offer to get insurance 
from the shipper if the buyer wants to pay for it, 
and I always get it on expensive, one-of-a-kind, 
or very fragile items. In my item description, I 
spell out that the buyer pays for insurance.
The major shippers offer insurance that’s fairly 
reasonably priced, so check out their rates at 
their Web sites. But don’t forget to read the 
details. For example, many items on eBay are 
sold MIMB (mint in mint box). True, the condi-
tion of the original box often has a bearing on 
the final value of the item inside, but the U.S. 
Postal Service insures only what is in the box. 
So, if you sold a Malibu Barbie mint in a mint 
box, USPS insures only the doll and not the 
original box. Pack carefully so your buyer gets 
what’s been paid for. Be mindful that shippers 
won’t make good on insurance claims if they 
suspect that you caused the damage by doing 
a lousy job of packing.
Alternatively, when you’re selling on eBay in 
earnest, you can purchase your own parcel-
protection policy from a private insurer. When 
you use this type of insurance, combined with 
preprinted electronic postage, you no longer 
have to stand in line at the post office to have 
your insured packaged logged in by the clerk 
at the counter.

Getting private shipping insurance
If you think that printing your own postage is slick, you’re gonna love 
Universal Parcel Insurance Coverage (U-PIC), a service that automates the 
post-office-insurance hassle because you can handle your insurance elec-
tronically. You can insure packages that you send through USPS, UPS, FedEx, 
and other major carriers. If you use its insurance on USPS-shipped packages, 
you can save as much as 80 percent on insurance rates.
U-PIC caters to individual eBay sellers amidst its many big-business clients. 
Here are some great features of the U-PIC service:
 
✦ No time wasted standing in line at the post office: The U-PIC service is 
integrated into online postage solutions such as endicia.com (described 
in Chapter 1).
 
✦ Quick payments on claims: If you have a claim, U-PIC pays it within 7 
days of receiving all required documents from the carrier.
 
 As with any insurance policy, assume that if you have many claims 
against your packages, you can be dropped from the service. (This 
thought only gives me more impetus to package my items properly — I 
never want to be banished to the counter lines again!)
 
✦ Blanket approval: U-PIC is approved by all major carriers. And turn-
about is fair play: All carriers covered must be on the U-PIC approved 
carrier listing.

using U-PIC may save you between 65 and 90% on your insurance costs. 
Table 3-2 outlines the U-PIC standard rates that apply when you ship with 
major carriers, and Table 3-3 compares U-PIC and USPS insurance rates. UPS 
charges $.60 per $100.00 package value (after the initial $100.00) with a $1.80 
minimum, but U-PIC charges only $.20 per $100.00 of package value. FedEx 
charges $.60 per $100.00 of package value with a $1.80 minimum. By using 
U-PIC, you can insure your FedEx packages for $.20 per $100.00 value.

Visit the U-PIC Web site (see Figure 3-1) and poke around. However, to get 
the best information, give them a phone call at their toll-free number. Your 
U-PIC sales representative will explain to you exactly how to declare value 
based on your present system. At the end of each shipping month, you fax, 
e-mail, or snail-mail your shipping reports to U-PIC.

To apply for your own U-PIC policy — with no charge to apply and no mini-
mum premium — go directly to the application on their Web site at
http://delta.u-pic.com/Apply/rtp.aspx
They’re a great bunch of people — tell ’em Marsha sent ya!
To apply for the U-PIC service, you must fill out a Request to Provide (RTP) 
form. You must answer questions about who you are, how many packages 
you send, how many insurance claims you’ve filed in the past two years, and 
your average value per package.
After you fill out the online form and agree to the policy (Evidence of 
Insurance), a U-PIC representative will contact you within 48 hours. The rep-
resentative will answer your questions and help you decide which of their 
programs will work best for your eBay business:
 
✦ The occasional shipper program is for the person who ships one to 
five packages per month. You can pay for your insurance online using a 
credit card, but the rates are not as attractive as those for the standard 
program.
 
✦ The offline standard program is the service for eBay businesspeople 
who ship a large number of packages per month. At the end of each 
shipping month, you generate an insurance report and use it to calculate 
your premium. You can pay the premium by check or through PayPal.

Avoiding Mistyped Addresses
To place a claim with U-PIC on a USPS shipment, you must do so no sooner 
than 21 days on a lost shipment and no later than 90 days after the date of 
mailing. You must supply the following:
 
✦ A signed letter, stating the loss or damage from the consignee
 
✦ A copy of the monthly insurance report you turned in to U-PIC reflecting 
the insured value
 
✦ A completed U-PIC claim form (one claim form per claim)
 
✦ A copy of the original invoice or the end-of-auction form
 
Because you’re paying for private insurance, U-PIC suggests that you include 
in the package a copy of your insurance policy (or at the very least a note 
explaining that you have an insurance policy covering your shipments) so 
that your buyer doesn’t think you’re overcharging (which makes some folks 
a bit cranky).
 
U-PIC will also insure international shipments. The cost to insure interna-
tional USPS parcels is only $1.00 per $100.00, with no deductible.
If you’re a high-volume shipper, you can negotiate an even lower rate with 
U-PIC. To reach U-PIC, call them toll-free at 800-955-4623.
Avoiding Mistyped Addresses
Lost packages are the bane of all carriers. The post office has been dealing 
with this problem since they opened the Dead Letter Office in 1825.
The Postal Service’s Dead Letter Office employees (I’ll call them DLOs) are 
the only people legally permitted to open lost mail. When an address label 
gets smooshed, torn, wet, or otherwise illegible — which means the box 
can’t be delivered — it finds its way into the hands of the DLOs, who open 
the package with the hope of finding enough information to get it to the 
rightful owner.
 
Make sure that you always include a packing slip — like the kind you print 
from Selling Manager or My eBay — inside your packages. The packing slip 
should have both your address and the buyer’s address so that if the label is 
illegible, the packing slip will identify the owner and the package can be 
delivered.
Of course, having the buyer’s address correct on the label is critical to begin 
with. The following ideas and practices will help you create accurate ship-
ping labels:

644
Avoiding Mistyped Addresses
 
✦ Cut and paste the buyer’s address: The safest way to correct address-
ing is to cut and paste the buyer’s address information from an e-mail or 
the PayPal payment confirmation or download. If your buyer’s address 
shows as unconfirmed through PayPal, send a quick e-mail to your 
buyer to verify. People do make mistakes, even when writing their own 
addresses.
 
✦ Don’t depend on the carrier to correct an address: No carrier is going 
to tell you whether the address you have is incorrect. The only time I’ve 
had inaccurate addresses corrected is when I used the DAZzle software.
 
✦ Use software or online services to check your buyer’s address: It’s 
good business practice to confirm the viability of an address before you 
send your item. Software such as DAZzle (from endicia.com, which I 
discuss in Chapter 1) corrects most common addressing errors such as 
misspelled city or street names. If you have a question about a ZIP code, 
you can check it at the post office Web site at www.usps.com/zip4. 
See how it corrected the city (and questions the address) in Figure 3-2?
 
Figure 3-2: 
Address 
verification 
in DAZzle’s 
Dial-A-ZIP.
 
 
If you have the Google toolbar (which I highly recommend in Book VIII), or 
go to www.google.com, you can type any UPS, post office, or FedEx track-
ing number and find the current tracking information from the carrier’s Web 
site. Just copy and paste the tracking number into the Google search box 
and start your search. You’ll come to a page that presents a link to track 
packages — with your number and carrier showing. Click the link and you 
end up at the carrier’s site with all the current tracking information! Nice!

Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
If you’ve been selling or buying on eBay for awhile, odds are you’ve made 
a claim for lost or damaged packages. The process is often grueling — with 
all the paperwork that’s involved — and the decision of the carrier is final. If 
you don’t agree with the carrier, you could try small claims court. But realize 
that you’ll lose a day of work — and when you’re in court, you’ll face all the 
legalese you find in the teeny-tiny print on the carrier’s terms of service.
I understand the hassles because I’ve had to make several claims myself. I’d 
like to help you avoid similar unpleasant experiences, or at least make them 
less unpleasant. I present information about the U.S. Postal Service first 
because their claim process is more stringent than that of the other carriers. 
With any carrier, however, you need to gather the same type of backup infor-
mation before making a claim.
Filing a claim with the post office
Making a claim with the post office: Oh man, talk about a hassle. But making 
a claim with any carrier isn’t a bowl of cherries on any day! Before making 
a claim with the USPS, check to make sure your package was covered by 
Several years ago, I purchased an original-
wardrobe uniform tunic from the Star Trek 
series that was framed and autographed by 
Leonard Nimoy. When it came, in an appropriate
large box surrounded with lots of Styrofoam 
peanuts and bubble wrap, it also sported a 4” x 
4” hole in the side, and it looked like someone 
had taken a sword to the box! Not only that, but 
there was a sad sound of glass tinkling when I 
shook the box. Oh, yes — the delivery man had 
dumped the box, rung the bell, and run.
The carrier couldn’t argue about the damage. 
The claim department tried to give me the line 
that the item was packed incorrectly. (Does 
that mean it was sent with a big hole already 
in the side of the box?) Then they offered me 
a partial payment. Gee, I really wanted the 
glass-particle-infested, ripped tunic now. It 
took a while, but the damages were so obvi-
ous that the carrier had to give in and agreed 
to send a check to the seller. Upon hearing this 
decision, the seller refunded my payment. (I 
wonder how long the seller had to wait for his 
payment?)
There was also a dress that I sold and shipped 
Priority Mail. It never arrived. I had a boiling-hot 
buyer on the other end, but luckily, I had proof 
of mailing in the form of a delivery confirma-
tion to show her. I nagged the post office about 
the package, but as you’ll read in the section, 
“Filing a claim with the post office,” you have 
to wait 30 days for a package to be officially 
declared lost. On the 29th day, the box was 
returned to me with no explanation or fanfare, 
and just a return-to-sender stamp on the front.
A couple of claim stories

646
Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
postal insurance, purchased at the time of mailing. If you use private 
insurance instead, you make a claim with your insurance carrier, not the 
post office.
When a package is lost in transit, you must wait a minimum of 30 days after 
the mailing date before you make the claim. If an item arrives at the buyer’s 
door damaged, you may make a claim with the post office immediately.
There’s always a question as to who makes the claim:
 
✦ Damaged or lost contents: Either the seller or the buyer can file the claim.
 
✦ Complete loss: When a package has not turned up within 30 days, the 
seller files the claim.
First, you must get a copy of PS Form 1000, Domestic Claim or Registered Mail 
Inquiry. Go to the post office or download it at
http://www.usps.com/forms/_pdf/ps1000.pdf
Fill out the form with all the details required and bring your backup 
information.
To make a damage claim, you must produce evidence of insurance. This can 
be either of the following documents:
 
✦ Original mailing receipt: The receipt that was stamped at the post 
office counter when the item was mailed.
 
✦ Original box or wrapper: This must show the addresses of both the 
sender and the recipient along with whatever tags or stamps the post 
office put on the package to say it’s insured.
 
If only the box or wrapper is presented as proof of insurance, the post office 
will likely limit the claim to $100.
You must also produce evidence showing the value of the item when it was 
mailed. The following list shows some of the documents accepted by the 
post office for damage claims (however, they may ask for more thorough 
proof):
 
✦ Sales receipt or descriptive invoice
 
✦ Copy of your canceled check or money order receipt
 
✦ Picture and description of a similar item from a catalog if your receipt 
isn’t available

Book VII
Chapter 3
Insuring Your 
Item’s Delivery
647
Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
 
✦ A letter from the seller stating the value of the item
 
✦ Your own description of the item, including date and time the item was 
purchased and whether it is new or vintage
For missing packages, you (the seller) need a letter from the buyer (dated 30 
days after the package was mailed) stating that the buyer never received the 
package.
If your buyer is too cranky to cooperate, go to the post office where you 
mailed the package. Ask for a written statement that there is no record of the 
delivery being made. Postal employees can look up the insurance or delivery 
confirmation numbers to find whether the delivery took place, but the post 
office will charge you $6.60 for their efforts. That amount will be reimbursed 
if the post office pays your claim and doesn’t locate your package under a 
bale of hay in Indiana.
If all goes well and your claim is deemed legit, you should get your payment 
within 30 days. If you don’t hear from the post office within 45 days (maybe 
the payment got lost in the mail?), you have to submit a duplicate claim 
using the original claim number.
 
Note to self (and to you): Always make a copy of any form you give to the 
government.
Filing a claim with UPS
Whoa! The stories of filing claims with UPS are legendary. Almost any eBay 
seller can tell you quite a story. I must admit that making a claim with UPS 
is a good deal easier than making a claim with the post office. After they file 
and accept your damage claim, you get a check within five days.
For damaged packages, UPS recently streamlined the process, although the 
buyer must make the claim. You can (if you really want to) call 1-800-PICK-
UPS (cute, eh?) to file your claim. The better idea is to go directly to the 
online reporting instructions at
www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/service/tracking/claims.
html
Be sure you make your report to UPS within 48 hours of delivery.
On the online claim form, you’ll be asked to input all information about the 
package and the damage. UPS seems to be familiar with its own handiwork 
because you get to select your particular type of damage from a menu.

648
Making a Claim When Shipping Goes Bad
After you’ve filled out and submitted the form, just sit on your haunches and 
wait for the UPS claims department to contact you.
 
I recommend that you print your form after filling it out so you can keep all 
claim reference information in one place.
After the buyer makes the claim, UPS sends a Damage/Loss Notification 
Letter form to the seller. The seller must fill out the form to state the item’s 
value and attach supporting documentation. The form can then be faxed 
back to UPS for final verification.
 
Save the damaged item and all the packaging that it came in. UPS may send 
an inspector out to look at the package before they approve a claim.
If a UPS shipment appears to be lost, the seller must call UPS to request a 
package tracer. If UPS is unable to prove delivery, the claim is paid.
Filing a claim with FedEx
Filing a claim with FedEx is similar to the UPS procedure, except FedEx gives 
you a little more leeway as to time. Instead of the 48-hours-after-delivery 
deadline, you have 15 business days to make your claim. (This extra time 
sure helps out when a package is delivered to your house and you’re out of 
town.) FedEx processes all Concealed Loss and Damage claims within five to 
seven days after receiving all the paperwork and information.
As with UPS, keep all packaging, along with the item, in case FedEx wants to 
come and inspect the damage.
When the post office pays your claim, it will 
usually ask to keep your item. Your item and 
thousands of others will end up at one of the 
Mail Recovery Centers across the country. 
Here it joins the other lost and salvage mail to 
be sold, usually at auction. The post office used 
to run these auctions on eBay under the user 
ID usps-mrc-everythingelse. I used 
to buy some great case lots from them and turn 
around and resell them on eBay!
Now the post office sells the stuff at live 
auctions. If you’d like to attend one, check their 
Web site at www.usps.com/auctions for 
dates and times. The post office always has 
good stuff for sale and usually in good quantity.

surplus (such as an old truck or supplies),

You can make your FedEx claim in a couple of ways:
 
✦ By fax: You can download a PDF claim form with instructions at
www.fedex.com/us/customer/claims/Claims.pdf
 
 Fill out the form and fax it to the number on the form.
 
✦ Online: Fill out the online claim form on a secure server at
https://www.fedex.com/us/claimsonline
 
 You must have a FedEx login to begin your claim. (See Chapter 2 on how 
to get this.) You still have to mail or fax your supporting documentation. 
When you file online, you can also choose to receive e-mail updates from 
FedEx regarding your claim (good idea).
 
The claim payment will be sent to the seller, so it’s up to the seller to make 
restitution with the buyer. As the seller, you should refund the money as 
soon as the claim is approved.

O
nce the selling bug has bitten you, it’s a natural transition to go from 
listing a few items a month to 50 or more. And that, dear reader, 
means you are officially running an eBay business. Congratulations!
There’s a good and a bad side to this. The good is that you’re making con-
siderably more cash than you did before hooking up with eBay. The bad? 
It’s time to start investing in some tools to keep your business professional.
The first tool that can help smooth your transition makes the process of 
running eBay auctions and sales consistent — Selling Manager.
Book III gets into eBay’s free Turbo Lister program (it gets your items on the 
site without putting you through the slow, sometimes-torturous Sell an Item 
form). As with Turbo Lister, Selling Manager is a suite of tools for managing 
your selling business from any computer (as long as it has an Internet con-
nection). eBay gives you 30 days to try out the service for free, thereafter 
charging you $4.99 per month. Believe me, the time that Selling Manager will 
save you is well worth the fee.
 
I’ve run well over 60 listings at a time, successfully managing them with 
Selling Manager Pro. I use it along with PayPal and QuickBooks (see Book IX 
for more about this method). This approach provides a one-stop, profes-
sional solution for my medium-size eBay business.

Trying Out Selling Manager
Trying Out Selling Manager
To download your free Selling Manager trial program, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Site map link on the eBay navigation bar, which is at the top 
of every eBay page.
 
2. In the middle column of the Site Map, under the Selling Tools head-
ing, click the eBay Selling Manager link.
 
3. Read the information on the Selling Manager hub page.
 
4. Click the Subscribe Now link.
You’re now subscribed to your 30-day free trial. eBay automatically popu-
lates Selling Manager for you with your information from the My eBay Selling 
link. The Selling link is changed to Selling Manager.
Later in the chapter, I tell you about Selling Manager Pro. But for now, just 
know that there are a few differences. Selling Manager Pro gives you every-
thing you get with Selling Manager, plus automatic listing and relisting of 
items, automated payment, shipping status, and feedback to buyers.
You can click the Selling Manager link to view a summary of your auction 
activities. Figure 1-1 shows my current Selling Manager Pro Summary page.

The Summary page lists at-a-glance statistics so I can see what’s going on 
with my sales quickly, at any time — from any computer. Links to other 
pages in the Selling Manager tool are also included.
 
If you plan to exceed 75 transactions at a time, consider using Selling 
Manager Pro; it has bulk feedback and bulk invoice-printing features. You 
can also go off-eBay to a third-party solution.
Selling Manager Features
A versatile program, the standard version of Selling Manager allows you to 
monitor or automate many of the more tedious eBay tasks. The My eBay 
Views section on the left has nine main headings.
At a Glance
We all like to know how we’re doing, and the At A Glance area allows you 
to do just that. A bar chart (see Figure 1-2) that shows sales for the last 24 
hours, last 7 days, and last 30 days is integrated with eBay so there’s no lag 
time from selling to viewing.

Seller Dashboard summary
The Seller Dashboard gives you a good way to check your status on eBay. As 
shown in Figure 1-3, the dashboard covers the all important results of the DSR 
ratings you get from your buyers. It also keeps you apprised of whether you’re 
following eBay’s policies or, instead, have violated any in the recent past. 
If you’re a PowerSeller, you also see your DSR-based Final Value Fee dis-
count (more on that in Book VIII, Chapter 4) as well as your PowerSeller 
standing. If you’re not a PowerSeller, these areas will indicate just that.

656
Selling Manager Features
At the bottom of the Seller Dashboard Summary is a link that takes you to 
the official dashboard. Click it, and you see a page like the one in Figure 1-4. 
Here you can find out the details of what makes you a good seller in eBay’s 
eyes — and your customers’ eyes, too.

Don’t obsess about your dashboard. Okay, I did (and still do sometimes). 
Check it once a week. Bottom line: If you’re doing the best job you can, 
there’s not much more you can do to change things. If your dashboard indi-
cates a problem with your sales; once a week is good enough to evaluate and 
make the necessary changes to your system.

Listing Activity
An important box on the Selling Manager page is Listing Activity. You’ll get 
some valuable information there. It references what you did — or didn’t — 
sell, along with even more stats on your sales. The next sections describe 
the activities you can view.
Scheduled listings
The Scheduled Listings link on the Summary page takes you to any auc-
tion, fixed-price, or store listing you’ve sent to eBay through Turbo Lister 
(or listed on the Sell an Item page) and scheduled for a later starting date 
or time. You can also view these pending (scheduled) listings through links 
that narrow them to listings that start within the next hour — or start today.
When you enter the Scheduled Listings area (by clicking the Scheduled 
Listings link), you can go directly to any of your listings If you want to pro-
mote your listing-to-be in a banner ad (or create a link to it from elsewhere 
on the Internet), you can do so using the URL of the pending listing. (See 
Book VI for more information on promoting your eBay business.)
From the Scheduled Listings page, you can confirm all information about the 
sale, as well as make any changes to the listing or to the scheduling time.
Active listings
Click the Active Listings link on the Summary page, and you can observe 
the bidding action just as you can from the My eBay Selling page. The color-
coding that indicates bidding activity is the same as on the My eBay Selling 
page. (If the current price is in green and bolded, your item has a bid and the 
number reflects the high bid. The current price is in red if there are no bids 
in an auction.) Your listings are accessible with a click of your mouse.
You have the option to show only auctions, store listings, or fixed-price 
items on the Active Listings page. You can also search your own listings by 
keyword or item number.
 
For more about active listings, visit the Summary page, which includes links 
to items ending within the hour and within the next 24 hours.
Ended listings
You can really access your Ended listings from the links on the left side 
of the page. But the important link here is the link to Eligible for Relist Fee 
credit. This link will conveniently take you to the listings that you can relist, 
and if they sell the second time, eBay will refund you initial listings fees. 

658
Selling Manager Features
 
You need to know that to be eligible for relisting credit, the item gets only 
one shot at reselling. If it’s been relisted twice, you need to start the listing 
again by using the Sell Similar link. The Sell Similar link (versus the Relist 
link) starts the transaction in a new cycle for the eBay servers, thereby 
making it eligible for the relisting credit if it doesn’t sell.
Sold
The Sold Listings feature (which you get to by clicking the Sold Listings link 
on the Summary page), is where Selling Manager really shines. You’ll find 
quite a few links here, including these:
 
✦ Awaiting payment: This is where items that have been won or bought 
are shown before a payment is made.
 
✦ Buyers Eligible for combined purchases: Here you’ll see when a buyer 
buys more than one item from you (yay!) and you need to combine the 
items into a single invoice. Otherwise the buyer may pay you once for 
each transaction — and then you’ll incur extra transaction fees from 
PayPal. Also, combined purchases help if you want to give your good 
customers a break on shipping.
 
✦ Awaiting Shipment: Once a buyer has sent payment through PayPal, the 
transaction automatically moves to this category.
 
✦ Paid and Shipped: After an item is paid for, a reference to it appears 
here so you can keep track of the feedback you need to leave.
 
✦ Dispute Console: This is where you turn in non-paying buyers and start 
an Unpaid Item Dispute.
My eBay Views links
On the left side of the My eBay page, you see more links for Selling Manager: 
Unsold items (for relisting), Archived items, and eBay’s Picture Manager 
photo-hosting solution. From the Archived link, you can access completed 
items that closed within the last four months. You can also download this 
information to your computer. There are good records here, so you should 
download and keep them. For more on what you can do with these records, 
see Book IX.
Seller tools links
Scroll down the page and you’ll see the Seller Tools box on the left side of 
the Summary page. It’s a powerful group of links that allow you to download 
and export your sales history to your computer. You also have quick links 
to PayPal, Picture Manager, Accounting Assistant (see Book IX for more on 
Accounting Assistant), My eBay Store, and the good old My eBay Selling 
page — in case you get nostalgic for the old, pre-Selling Manager days.

Manage My Store
If you have an eBay store, you’ll see a box with all the links you need to 
manage your store, as shown in Figure 1-5. You can access reports, e-mail 
marketing tools, Markdown Manager, and more. (See Book VIII Chapter 6 for 
more on the eBay Store tools.)

I hate to see items in the Sold Listings Past Due 
area of the Summary page, because it means 
there’s a good chance I’m not going to get paid 
for an item. I always keep an eye on my Sold, 
Awaiting Payment items and send out a pay-
ment reminder when three days has passed. 
If seven days pass without payment, the item 
drops into Sold Listings Past Due: Unpaid and 
becomes eligible for an unpaid item reminder.
 ✓ Eligible for unpaid item dispute: This is 
where the items awaiting payment fall 
when they become eligible for you to file 
a Non-Paying Bidder alert. This happens 
when 7 days have passed without a pay-
ment being received.
 ✓ Disputes awaiting your response: After 
you’ve filed an unpaid-item reminder, the 
item goes into this area. It links to a dispute 
page that lists all outstanding disputes. The 
buyer has the right to answer your dispute 
here — and you can answer that answer.
 ✓ Eligible for Final Value fee credit: This is 
the sad category where buyers from the 
Non-Paying Bidder column go if, after all 
your attempts to get action, they haven’t 
responded and haven’t sent payment. (If 
they don’t cough up within 10 days after 
you file a Non-Paying Bidder Alert, the list-
ing moves to this category automatically.)
 ✓ Items not received or not as described. 
Here’s where you can see if a buyer has 
ratted you out to eBay for an item that hasn’t 
shown up when expected. (Surprisingly, 
some buyers think their items should arrive 
within 48 hours of winning.) Or it could be 
lost in the mail. This is the area where you 
can see the disputes against you.

Auto-Sending Invoices
Auto-Sending Invoices
One of my favorite features of Selling Manager is that I can follow the prog-
ress of my sales from the Summary page. When an item has been won or 
paid for using PayPal, I can click the appropriate link to see the list of items 
ready for an action (such as shipping!). Figure 1-6 shows my Sold Items: Paid 
& Waiting to Ship area in Selling Manager.
Selling Manager has seven e-mail templates 
that you can quickly and easily customize. 
These templates allow you to add auto text, 
information that eBay’s server fills in for that 
particular transaction. Note in the figure the 
drop-down list, which provides shortcuts to 
edit the eBay-supplied templates. When a 
winner buys an item, I have a preformatted 
winning buyer-notification letter I created 
from one of these templates. When a winner 
pays immediately using PayPal, I also have a 
payment-received e-mail.

Notice the record number next to the winner’s e-mail address. To send an 
e-mail or invoice, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the record number to the left of the buyer’s e-mail address.
 
 The sales record for that transaction appears. You see the items sold 
to that buyer, as shown in Figure 1-7. If the buyer has made more than 
one purchase, you’ll see a notation stating as much. You then have the 
option to click the link to combine purchases in the sales record.

 If you want, you can personalize the e-mail by altering one of the tem-
plates that Selling Manager supplies. (See the “Selling Manager’s cus-
tomizable e-mail templates” sidebar for details.)
 
4. When you’re ready to send the e-mail, click Send.
Tracking Payments
Selling Manager makes many selling processes considerably easier. Take a 
look your Selling Manager Summary page. From here, you can see how many 
buyers have paid for their purchases — and, sadly, how many haven’t.
If you’re expecting payments, be sure to check the Summary page several 
times a day. When a buyer makes his or her payment using PayPal, eBay will 
update your records. (PayPal also sends you a payment received e-mail, but 
this type of notification is often late.)
After you ship the item, you can indicate that on the Sales Status & Notes 
screen, shown in Figure 1-8. The transaction information in Figure 1-8 is 
available when you click the record number next to the item that’s been 
shipped. If you ship the item, input that info, and click Save, the record will 
move from the Sold Listings, Paid and Ready to Ship page to the Paid and 
Shipped page. This change will also be reflected on the Summary page.

Relisting
Relisting
Wouldn’t it be better if you could select a whole bunch of items and relist 
them all together? Step up to Selling Manager for a one-click option.
You can access items that have not sold, logically enough, from the Unsold 
Items area (as shown in Figure 1-9). Relisting is accomplished with a click of 
the mouse!
 
Let me stress the difference between Relisting and Sell Similar. You need to 
relist an item that hasn’t sold so you can get a refund on your listing fees if it 
sells the second time. (This doesn’t work on the third try.) When an item has 
been sold, you use the Sell Similar link to start the listing in a new cycle in 
eBay’s master computers. That way, if it doesn’t sell, you’ll be able to relist 
and take advantage of the possible refund.
To relist an item (or Sell Similar) through Selling Manager, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the Unsold Items listings.
 
 To do so, click the links in the Selling Manager box on the left of the 
page (or just link through the summary).
 
2. Select the items to relist (or Sell Similar) by selecting the check box 
next to each item’s Title.
 
 You may select any or all of the items listed on the page.
 
3. Click the Relist button (or the Sell Similar button).
 
 The Relist Multiple Items page appears.

5. Submit the items by clicking the Submit Listing button.
Figure 1-10 shows a portion of the Relist Multiple Items page that includes a 
complete review of the details of each item. If you proceed at this point, the 
items will be relisted exactly as you had them listed before. At the bottom of 
the list, eBay recaps all relisting fees.

Selling Manager Reports
I like Selling Manager because it gives you the opportunity to keep all your 
selling information in one place. It also provides a downloadable report in a 
spreadsheet format that you can archive for your business records. Here is 
the information you can expect to find in the report:
 
✦ Sales record number: The number assigned to the transaction by Selling 
Manager for identification purposes.
 
✦ User ID: The eBay user ID of the person who purchased the item 
from you.
 
✦ Buyer zip: The buyer’s ZIP code.

Selling Manager Reports
 
✦ State: The state the buyer resides in.
 
✦ Buyer country: The country your buyer lives in.
 
✦ Item number: The eBay number assigned to the item when you listed it 
for sale on the site.
 
✦ Item title: The title of the listing as it appeared on eBay.
 
✦ Quantity: The number of items purchased in the transaction.
 
✦ Sale price: The final selling price of the item.
 
✦ Shipping amount: The amount you charged for shipping the item.
 
✦ Shipping insurance: If the buyer paid insurance, it’s listed next to his or 
her sales record.
 
✦ State sales tax: If you’ve set up Selling Manager to calculate sales tax 
for your in-state sales, and sales tax was applied to the item when it was 
sold, that amount is listed here.
 
✦ Total price: The GSA (gross sales amount) for the transaction.
 
✦ Payment method: The method of payment used by the buyer. This is 
inserted automatically if the item is paid through PayPal, or manually 
inserted by you into the sales record if paid by another method.
 
✦ Sale date: The date the transaction occurred on eBay.
 
✦ Checkout: The date of checkout. This is usually the same as the transac-
tion date.
 
✦ Paid on date: The date the buyer paid for the item.
 
✦ Shipped on date: The ship date you entered in Selling Manager.
 
✦ Feedback left: Whether you left feedback for the buyer is indicated by a 
Yes or No in this column.
 
✦ Feedback received: The feedback rating left for you by the buyer (posi-
tive, negative, or neutral).
 
✦ Notes to yourself: If you input any personal notes regarding the transac-
tion in the sales record, they appear here.
 
Keep in mind that Selling Manager reports are available on the site for only 
four months, so be sure to download your information regularly.
Notice that there is no column reflecting the eBay fees you paid for listing 
and selling the item. If you have plenty of time on your hands, you can create 
another column and input the fees from your eBay invoice for each item. 
Save time by posting the monthly total once a month in your bookkeeping 
program.

Save.
 
 After the file is downloaded, you’ll see a confirmation with your new 
filename.
 
It’s a good idea to create a directory on your computer with a name such as 
eBay Sales. In this directory, you can store all the reports you download 
from eBay, PayPal, or any other online service. Be sure to include this direc-
tory when you perform regular data backups.

With simple spreadsheet commands, you can customize the look of your 
report. For example, if the column for Buyer Country is unnecessary for your 
records (you ship only within the United States, so the information is not 
useful), you can delete the column in to quick steps:
 
1. Highlight the column by clicking the column letter.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Delete.
 
 Voilá! The offending column is no more.
 
All spreadsheet tasks mentioned here can be performed in similar fashion in 
Microsoft Works or Excel.
The spreadsheet generated by Selling Manger is much more useful if you 
total the columns. That way, you can see your total sales at a glance. To 
total a spreadsheet column:

1. Click in the blank box at the bottom of the column you want to total.
 
2. Click the AutoSum button.
 
3. Click and drag over the cells you want to sum.
 
4. Press Enter, and the total appears.
If you want to total the columns next to the one you just totaled, you don’t 
have to re-input the formula. Just highlight the results cell from your last 
formula, and highlight cells in the same row that you want to contain totals 
of the columns. Then choose Edit➪Fill➪Right, as shown in Figure 1-14. This 
copies the formula to the connecting cells and all the columns are totaled.

Book VIII: Power Selling

Chapter 2: Managing Your 
Business with Third-Party Tools
In This Chapter
✓ Deciding among the available tools
✓ Checking out auction management services
✓ Figuring out what tasks you can automate
✓ Getting bonded for good measure
W
hen you get to the point of running up to 20 auctions at a time, I 
highly recommend that you begin to use a management tool. At this 
level of activity, using eBay’s Selling Manager will suit you nicely, and I go 
over how Selling Manager works in Chapter 1. But when your eBay business 
begins to push 100 listings a week, I recommend that you get additional help 
in the form of an auction-management service or software.
Whether you use an online service or software residing on your own com-
puter is a personal decision. You may find it easier to use an online system 
because you can log on to your selling information at any time from any 
computer. But if you have a slow Internet connection or pay usage fees by 
the hour, managing your eBay business online can become impractical.
Most desktop-based software packages have features that enable you to 
do your work on your computer and then upload (or download) your data 
when you go online. If having multiple locations to work from is not impor-
tant, and you run your eBay business from a single computer in your office, 
you may feel more comfortable with a desktop-based software product.
In either case, if your business has reached the level where you need an 
auction-management tool, congratulations! In this chapter, I want to save 
you some time finding the service or software that’s right for you. I outline 
some of the tasks that an auction-management product should provide, and 
compare prices of several services.

672
Choosing Your Auction-Management Tools
Choosing Your Auction-Management Tools
If you searched the Internet for auction-management services and software, 
you’d come up with a bunch. For simplicity’s sake, I’ve chosen to examine 
just a few of these services in this chapter. After speaking to many sellers, 
I’ve found online services that offer two important features:
 
✦ Uptime reliability (uptime is vital here; you don’t want the server that 
holds your photos going down or mislaunching your auctions)
 
✦ Software that’s continually updated to match changes to eBay
Using a site or software to run your auctions takes practice, so I suggest that 
you try any that appeal to you and offer free preview trials. As I describe 
these different applications, I include a link so you can check them out 
further.
 
Some software and services work on a monthly fee; others work on a one-
time purchase fee. For a one-time-purchase software application to truly 
benefit you, it must have the reputation for updating its software each time 
eBay makes a change in its system. The programs I discuss in this chapter 
have been upgraded continually to date.
 
Most services have a free trial period. Be sure that you don’t spend a bunch 
of your precious time inputting your entire inventory, only to discover you 
don’t like the way the service works. Instead, input a few items to give the 
service a whirl.
There’s a huge difference between auction-listing software and sites and 
auction-management products. For many a seller, listing software like eBay’s 
Turbo Lister (see Book III, Chapter 4) may just do the trick. Combine that 
with eBay’s Selling Manager (a management program) and your eBay busi-
ness will be humming along just fine.
When your business activity level increases and you turn to an auction-
management solution for your eBay business, you should look for certain 
standard features (described next). Also consider what information manage-
ment features you currently have through your bookkeeping program (see 
Book IX). You have the data there, regardless of whether you use it in a man-
agement solution.
Many of the products listed have several pricing tiers, so Table 2-1 provides 
the link to the product’s pricing page. I’ve also listed the minimum price for 
each company’s management products. Some offer less expensive options 
for listing your auctions (with templates and all kinds of swell bells and 
whistles), but the price shown in the table is for the minimum management 
product.

Have you ever purchased anything on eBay 
only to be directed off the eBay site to check-
out? I’ve always hated this — and the check-
out didn’t work for me about 50% of the time. I 
felt more secure with my purchases when the 
checkout and payment was performed all on 
eBay and PayPal. 
Sellers used this third-party checkout to mech-
anize their e-mail lists and to upsell you to more 
items — which would not be covered by the 
Fraud Protection because they were bought off 
the eBay site.
eBay’s Trust and Safety department took the 
buyers’ woes to heart, and to give the site a 
better buyer experience, announced they may 
discontinue third-party checkout in mid-2009. 
Some of the official reasons for the phase-out 
are as follows:
 ✓ Lack of trust by buyers in “off-eBay” 
checkout
 ✓ Lack of consistency in the checkout pro-
cess among eBay providers
 ✓ Higher-than-anticipated failures during the 
checkout process
At one time, third-party checkout was a highly 
touted and well used “feature” of auction-man-
agement providers. It also easily enables the 
buyer to use a credit card for payment rather 
than using PayPal. PayPal/eBay checkout cur-
rently provides for all of this while keeping the 
buyer in a trusted environment.
Third-party checkout phases out?

674
Looking for Essential Features
 
Never choose auction-management tools on the sole basis of price. Go to the 
various Web sites and take a look at everything they offer for the price 
stated. You may find out that a service charging a bit more may just be 
worth it because of all the extra tools offered.
Looking for Essential Features
Here are some must-have features to look for when you evaluate the offer-
ings of auction-management services and products:
 
✦ Image hosting: Some Web sites dazzle you with high-megabyte storage 
numbers. Keep one thing in mind: If your average eBay image is around 
40 K, you could store 128 pictures in a 5MB storage space and about 
2500 images in a 100MB storage space. Unless you’re a big-time seller, 
you really don’t need that much space. Your eBay images should be 
archived on your computer (how about in a folder called eBay Images?). 
Images for current listings should be on the hosted site — only while the 
transaction is in progress. After the buyer has the item and all is well, 
you can remove the images from the remote server.
eBay endorsement is something I’ve wanted to 
talk about for a long time. I get e-mails upon 
e-mails from people asking me about one com-
pany or another, telling me a particular com-
pany is
 ✓ Recommended by eBay 
 ✓ Endorsed by eBay
 ✓ Owned by eBay (because the eBay logo 
appears in the Web site)
None of the above is ever true. There is a 
Certified Provider program from eBay where 
eBay qualifies businesses who want to do 
business with the eBay community. Note that 
I used the word qualify. That does not mean 
endorse.
By having the Certified Provider program, eBay 
manages to keep the very worst of the worst 
from aligning themselves with eBay. The initial 
requirement (as stated by eBay) is “Participants 
(in the program) must have extensive experi-
ence with eBay, pass a strict certification exam 
and provide a number of proven customer ref-
erences that are checked by eBay.”
That description (again) does not say endorsed, 
approved, or any other title implying formal 
authorization by eBay. It only says that par-
ticipants have passed an eBay exam, proved 
references, and paid their fee. The best way 
to check out one of eBay’s providers is to find 
other sellers who’ve done business with them 
and get their feedback (not necessarily the 
ones the provider supplies to you). Whenever 
I do business with someone who gives eBay 
advice, I run a Google search on the compa-
ny’s name (or their eBay User ID) and the word 
fraud to see whether they’ve been involved 
in any fraudulent activities that haven’t been 
made widely public.

Exploring Advanced Features
 
 You probably already have free image hosting on your ISP’s Web site, as 
noted in Book V.
 
✦ Designing listings: The basis of most of these products is a good listing 
function. You’ll be able to select from supplied templates or design your 
own and store them for future use. An important feature now coming into 
use is a spell checker. There’s nothing worse than a misspelling in a listing!
 
✦ Uploading listings: Most products have a feature that launches a group 
of listings to eBay all at once. They may also allow you to schedule auc-
tions to get underway at a prescribed time.
 
 You can also expect to be able to put together your listings at your 
leisure offline and upload them to your service. Most products archive 
your past listings so that you can relist at any time. Many services also 
offer bulk relisting.
 
✦ E-mail management: You can expect to be provided with sample e-mail 
letters (templates) that you can customize with your own look and feel. 
The services should also offer auto-generated e-mails for end-of-auction, 
payment received, and shipping.
 
✦ Feedback automation: Post feedback in bulk to a number of your com-
pleted listings, or leave predesigned feedback for each, one by one. 
Some products support automatic positive feedback that kicks in when a 
buyer leaves you positive feedback.
 
✦ Sales reports: Some services (even the least expensive) offer you some 
sort of sales analysis. Be sure to take into account how much you really 
need this feature, basing your estimate on data that you may already 
receive from QuickBooks, PayPal, eBay Stores, or SquareTrade.
Exploring Advanced Features
Depending on the type of business you run, you may need some of the more 
advanced features offered by management products:
 
✦ Inventory tools: Management products may allow you to create inven-
tory records for your different products, such that you can click a 
bunch of them to list them automatically. When an item is sold, the tool 
deducts the item from your inventory automatically.
 
✦ Sales-tax tracking and invoicing: With full management, you can expect 
your sales tax to be calculated into your invoices and complete line-item 
invoices to be sent automatically. Multiple items, when purchased by 
the same buyer, will be combined.
 
✦ Consignment tracking: If you’re a Trading Assistant, be sure to look 
for a product that enables you to separately track the products you sell 
for different clients. You should also be able to produce reports of 
consignment sales by customer.

676
Opting for Online Auction Management
 
✦ Shipping: Most of the services will give you the option of printing your 
packing lists and shipping labels directly from the product. Some of the 
larger services integrate with the major shippers, allowing you to go 
directly to particular shippers’ sites and ship your items using their 
software.
Table 2-2 gives you the dollars and cents of subscribing to the various online 
and offline services. To put together this table, I disregarded lower subscrip-
tion levels, where companies offered only listing products. These are the 
lowest prices for products that are truly management tools.

Opting for Online Auction Management
You may want to run your business from any computer, anywhere in the 
world. If that’s the case, you might do best with an online service. Auction-
management Web sites handle almost everything, from inventory manage-
ment to label printing. Some sellers prefer online (or hosted) management 
sites because you can access your information from any computer. You 
might use every feature a site offers, or you might choose a bit from column 
A and a bit from column B and perform the more personalized tasks manu-
ally. Read on to determine what service might best suit your needs.
Although quite a few excellent online services for automating sales are avail-
able, I have room here to show you only a few. Many services are similar in 
format, so in the following sections I point out some of the highlights of a few 
representative systems.

Opting for Online Auction Management
 
When you use an online service, your information resides on a server out 
there in cyberspace; if you’re a control freak, that may be a bit much to bear.
 
When selecting a service, look for a logo or text indicating that the service is 
an eBay Certified Developer, Preferred Solution Provider, or API licensee. 
These people have first access to eBay’s system changes and can implement 
them immediately. Others may have a day or so lag time to update their 
software.
ChannelAdvisor Marketplaces
ChannelAdvisor’s founder Scot Wingo got into the auction business around 
the turn of the century. His first foray into the eBay world was AuctionRover 
(founded in July 1999), a site that had tools to perform an extensive eBay 
search, list auctions, and check pricing trends. The company’s cute Rover 
logo was fashioned after Wingo’s Border Collie, Mack.
Fast forward to today. ChannelAdvisor is a highly popular management 
service for all levels of eBay sellers. They supply listing and management 
services to everyone from Fortune 1000 companies to the little old lady 
next door. How? They offer two levels of software: MarketplaceAdvisor 
Premium for midsized to large businesses and higher-level PowerSellers, and 
MarketplaceAdvisor for small businesses and individuals. These powerful 
software suites help eBay sellers successfully manage and automate the sale 
of their merchandise.
Starting at the entry level, you can get the MarketplaceAdvisor for $29.95 a 
month. Here’s what they offer the beginning-level seller:
 
✦ Listing design and launching: Create your listings with their standard 
templates or use your own HTML to design auction descriptions. List 
your items immediately or schedule a listing. ChannelAdvisor will 
launch the auction when you tell it to.
 
✦ Item and inventory management: If you want to keep your inventory 
online, you can create it on the MarketplaceAdvisor system. If you 
want to input your inventory offline, you can import it from their Excel

Vendio
I have fond memories of the early days on AuctionWeb (the forerunner of 
eBay). Some are especially about the other folks I met when we were all 
beginning. The site (originally AuctionWatch), was founded in summer of 
1998 as a message board for online sellers. In 1999, when I was struggling to 
get out the first edition of eBay for Dummies, Mark Dodd and Rodrigo Salas 
were laying hands on multiple millions from venture capitalists to begin a 
new auction-service site. 
Hard work pays off, because today that site is Vendio — and it has served 
more than a million sellers over the years to improve their bottom line. One 
of the things that make Vendio (shown in Figure 2-2) unique is their range of 
offerings. In addition to auction management, Vendio has a full complement 
of research tools and other offerings. Each tool, should you choose to use it, 
is offered a la carte.

Here are just a few features of their auction-management suite:
 
✦ Item and inventory management: Keep track of your items and launch 
with a click from their site.
 
✦ Image hosting: For eBay auctions, image hosting is based on how much you 
need at a time. For $2.95 a month, you can store up to 3 MB of pictures.
 
✦ Auction reporting: Generates accounts receivable, item history, and 
post-sales reports from the Reports area. Reports include customizable 
views of your sales data, item and auction data, accounts receivable, 
and sales tax.
 
✦ Templates and listing: Over 160 very professional templates. You can use 
their predefined color templates or use your own home made templates. 
 
✦ Post-auction management included in Basic Sales Manager: Sends out 
automated e-mail to your winners, linking them to your own branded 
checkout page. If customers want to pay with PayPal or your own mer-
chant account, they have to link from there. Vendio combines multiple 
wins for shipping and invoicing. You have the option to set six different 
feedback comments, which you choose at the time of posting.
 
Vendio offers a fully customizable Store you can place in your own Web 
space — at no additional charge. When you set up yours, all your items are 
seamlessly integrated. To get current information and sign up for a free trial,

Meridian
Meridian Software was developed by eBay Shooting Star PowerSeller Joe 
Cortese. Through his own experience on eBay, he developed this service 
to fulfill all the needs of an eBay seller, at a very reasonable price of $9.95 a 
month.
As a high-volume eBay seller, he was looking for an easier way to handle his 
3000 unique auctions a month. You can apply the same technology to your 
auctions. Meridian features enterprise-level listing and more:
 
✦ Item and inventory management: Includes calendar- and time-based 
scheduling (that is, dates and times for launching auctions), automated 
auction launching and relisting, the capability to import past or current 
auctions, and the capability to import auction data from a spreadsheet 
or database.
 
✦ Image hosting: Offers space for storing pictures. You can upload bulk 
images to its Web site or FTP your images directly.
 
✦ Auction reporting: Generates current running auction statistics — the 
total number and dollars of current and past auctions — and an item-
ized report of each auction.
 
✦ Post-auction management: Allows you to send (manually or automati-
cally) a variety of customized e-mails to winners and nonpaying bidders. 
Your invoices can link directly to PayPal.
 
✦ Consignment tools: For sellers who sell for others (see information on 
eBay’s Trading Assistants program in Book IV, Chapter 3), Meridian 
offers complete tracking and inventory by consignor. 
The post-auction management features also include the ability to send auto-
matic feedback and to create mailing labels for each sale. So that feedback 
isn’t posted until you’re sure the transaction is successfully completed, you 
have the option of disabling the automatic feedback feature. Visit their Web 
site (pictured in Figure 2-3) at

Offline Auction-Management Software
You may be like many sellers and prefer to run your business from a fixed 
location. In this case, you probably feel more comfortable with downloadable 
software that will handle most of your auction business chores on your own 
computer. I happen to like the option of being able to reference my old auc-
tions on my backups. Luckily, some valuable auction software programs are 
available to perform all the tasks you get from the online services. To those 
who would rather have the software at home, there are some solid choices 
other than the ones I examine in this section. You might also want to visit 
these other sites to check out their quality auction-management software.

682
Offline Auction-Management Software
You can accomplish almost all the same tasks on your own computer as you 
can with online services.
Following is a description of a few of the leading products.
Auction Wizard 2000
Way back in 1999, Standing Wave Software developed a product that would 
handle large inventories and meet the needs of the growing eBay population. 
Enter Auction Wizard. In 2000, the company introduced a more robust ver-
sion, Auction Wizard 2000, to meet the challenges presented by changes on 
eBay.
This software is a tour-de-force of auction management whose pieces are 
integrated into one program. Some of its special features enable you to
 
✦ Handle consignment sales. Keep track of consignment sales by consign-
ees, including all fees.
 
✦ Edit your images before uploading. The software allows you to import 
your images, and crop, rotate, or resize images for your auctions.
 
✦ Upload your pictures with built-in FTP software while you’re working 
on your auctions, eliminating the need for another piece of auction-
business software.
The program interface is straightforward. I always plunge into new programs 
without reading the instructions, and I was able to use the program right off 
the bat. I’m still not a whiz at it, but that’s probably because Auction Wizard 
2000 has so many features that I haven’t had the time to study them all.
To begin using the software, simply download your current eBay auctions 
directly into the program. When your auctions close, send customized 
e-mails (the program fills in the auction information) and manage all your 
end-of-auction business. Some sellers launch their auctions using Turbo 
Lister, and then retrieve them and handle the end-of-auction management 
with Auction Wizard 2000 (see Figure 2-4).

Selling Manager and Selling Manager Pro
If you would prefer to manage your listings directly on eBay, you might just 
want to give eBay’s Selling Manager and Selling Manager Pro a look. Figure 
2-5 below shows you my Selling Manager Pro page for today (it changes by 
the minute). If you haven’t read Chapter 1 in this book, take a moment to

confuse easily and having everything laid out for me makes my business a 
whole lot easier.

Turbo Lister
I like Turbo Lister because it’s simple and easy to use. It has a built-in 
WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) HTML editor, and makes prepar-
ing my listings offline easy. Then, when I’m ready, I just click a button and 
they’re all listed at once. You can also stagger listings and schedule them for 
a later date (for a fee).
For all the details on Turbo Lister, see Book III, Chapter 4.

Finding More to Automate
Now that eBay has become a world marketplace, a single-page auction or 
item listing is becoming an increasingly valuable piece of real estate. Millions 
view your sale, and the more auctions and fixed-price items that you can list, 
the better your chance to make a good living. Time is money: You need to 
post your auctions quickly and accurately.
Posting auctions, keeping records, cataloging inventory, managing photos, 
and gathering statistics are all tasks that you can automate. The more your 
business grows, the more confusing things can become. Automated tools 
can help you keep it all straight. But remember: The more paid tools you 
use, the more expense you may be adding to your business. Always keep 
your bottom line in mind when evaluating whether to use fee-based software 
and services.
You’ll have to perform certain office tasks, no matter how few (or how 
many) auctions you’re running. Depending on your personal business style, 
you may want to automate any or all of the following tasks. You may choose 
to use a single program, a manual method, or use some features from one 
program and some from others. For those who aren’t ready for the auto-
mated plunge, I offer alternatives here. Where appropriate, I insert refer-
ences that guide you to places in this book (or on the Web) where you can 
find more information about the automated services I discuss.

Setting up an auction photo gallery
Until you get your own eBay store, setting up a photo gallery is a great alter-
native. That way, if your customers have a high-speed connection, they can 
browse your auctions through photographs. Some auction-management 
sites can host your gallery. Some charge for this service; others do not. The 
best part is that you can produce your own gallery without any fancy pro-
grams or auction-management software, and at no additional cost to you.
To make your own gallery on eBay without installing fancy scripts in your 
listings, you need to do three things:
 
1. Include eBay gallery photos with all the listings you want to appear in 
your gallery.
 
 Be sure to put your user name in the text of your item’s descriptions. 
 
2. Test the following URL in your browser, substituting your own user ID 
in place of the bold italics: 
http://shop.ebay.com/merchant/yourUserID
 
 Figure 2-6 shows a sample of what you’ll see.
 
Figure 2-6:

3. After you’ve checking your gallery, insert the following HTML into 
your auction to include a link to your gallery:
<a href=”http://shop.ebay.com/merchant/yourUserID”> 
<B>Click <I>here</I> to view YourUserID Gallery</B> 
</a >
 
 You can also use this in your e-mails to customers to show them just 
what’s for sale at that very moment.
Sorting auction e-mail
A vital function of any auction software or system is the ability to customize 
and send e-mails to your winners. Many sellers use the default letters, which 
tend to be a bit — no, incredibly — impersonal and uncaring. You must 
decide whether you want the program to receive e-mail as well.
Most computer-resident auction-management programs (programs installed 
on your own computer versus going online to do your business) have their 
own built-in e-mail software. When you download your winner information 
from eBay, the program automatically generates invoices and congratulatory 
e-mails.
How to handle your auction-related e-mail is a personal choice. Although 
I currently use eBay’s Selling Manager to send auction-related e-mails, 
I receive auction e-mail through Outlook, using a separate folder titled 
“Auctions” that contains subfolders for eBay Buy and eBay Sell.
Automating end-of-auction e-mail
If you want to set up e-mails to be sent automatically after an auction ends, 
you must use a software application. The software should download your 
final auction results, generate the e-mail, and let you preview the e-mail 
before sending it out. Many of the online sites discussed previously in this 
chapter send out winner confirmation e-mails automatically when an auction 
is over. 
 
If you want to use this option, be sure that you set your preferences to 
preview the e-mail before sending.
Keeping inventory
Many eBay PowerSellers depend on the old clipboard or notebook method — 
crossing off items as they’re sold. If that works for you, great. Others prefer to 
use an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of inventory.

Book VIII
Chapter 2

Finding More to Automate
Most of the auction-management packages detailed in this chapter handle 
inventory for you. Some automatically deduct an item from inventory when 
you launch an auction. You have your choice of handling inventory directly 
on your computer or keeping your inventory online with a service that’s 
accessible from any computer, wherever you are.
I handle my inventory on my desktop through QuickBooks. When I buy mer-
chandise to sell, and I post the bill to QuickBooks, it automatically puts the 
merchandise into inventory. When I input my sale, it deducts the items sold 
from standing inventory. I can print a status report whenever I want to see 
how much I have left — or have to order.
Composing HTML
Fancy auctions are nice, but fancy doesn’t make the item sell any better. 
Competitive pricing and low shipping rates work in your favor — especially 
with eBay’s Compare Items feature in Search. Also, a clean listing with as 
many photos as necessary goes a long way to sell your product. Some soft-
ware and services offer a large selection of templates to gussy up your auc-
tions. But you must think of your customers; many of them are still logging 
on with dial-up connections, which are notoriously slow. The use of simple 
HTML doesn’t slow the loading of your page, but the addition of miscel-
laneous images (decorative backgrounds and animations) definitely makes 
viewing your auction a chore for those dialing up. And forget background 
music — it really slows things down!
Don’t fret; you can make do by repeatedly incorporating two or three simple 
HTML templates, cutting and pasting new text as necessary. Most auction-
management programs offer you several template choices. I recommend that 
you stick with a few that are similar, giving a standardized look to your list-
ings, which is just the way major companies give a standardized look to their 
advertising and identity. Your customers will get used to the look of your 
auctions and feel comfortable each time they open one.
I use SeaMonkey (a free program from the people who brought us Firefox) to 
generate much of my code for auction descriptions. Visit Book 5 Chapter 3 
for more information on this handy program).An important line of code that 
everyone seems to forget is the one that inserts a picture into your auction 
description. On the Sell an Item page, click the tab to view in HTML mode, 
and insert the following line below where you’d like your image to appear in 
your description:
<img src=”http://www.yourserver.com/imagename.jpg”>

688
Finding More to Automate
Be sure to substitute your own server and image name. If you want to put 
one picture above another, type <P> and then repeat the HTML line with a 
different image name.
If you’re in a rush and need a quick and easy HTML generator, go to my Web 
site at www.coolebaytools.com and click Tools. In addition, Book V has 
sample HTML code for auction descriptions, as well as a chart of all the code 
you’ll ever need for an eBay auction.
One-click relisting or selling similar
Using auction software or an auction service speeds up the process of 
posting or relisting items. After you input your inventory into the software, 
posting or relisting your auctions is a mouse click away. All the auction man-
agement software packages that I detailed previously in this chapter include 
this feature.
 
If you buy your items in bulk, you might want to take advantage of eBay’s 
free relisting tool. By clicking the Sell Similar link (see Figure 2-7) on any suc-
cessful listing on your My eBay Sold area, you can automatically relist your 
items. Sell Similar starts the listing as new, so if it doesn’t sell you can avail 
yourself of the Relist feature. This way, if the item sells the second time, 
your listing (insertion fees) for the first listing will be credited.
 
Figure 2-7: 
The Relist 
and Sell 
Similar 
buttons live 
near the top 
of the My 
eBay Sold 
Items page.
 
Although eBay says that Sell Similar is for relisting items, it works also when 
listing a duplicate of an item that has sold successfully. The only difference 
is that you aren’t credited for the unsold auction listing fee.
 
One savvy seller I know uses the eBay Sell Similar feature to post new list-
ings. She merely clicks the Sell Similar link, and then cuts and pastes her new 
information into the existing HTML format. That’s why her items all have the 
same feel and flavor.

Scheduling listings for bulk upload
If you want to schedule the unattended launch of your auctions without 
incurring eBay’s $.10 fee, you must use an online management service 
(check out the “Online auction-management sites” section). If you can be at 
your computer to send your auctions to eBay singly or in bulk, you can use 
the Turbo Lister application, which eBay offers at no charge.
Hosting photos
If all you need is photo hosting, and you’ve checked out your ISP but they 
don’t give you any free Web space to use (please check Book V for a list of 
ISPs and the amount of Web storage space they give to their customers), you 
can always use eBay’s Picture Services to host an additional picture in each 
auction at $.15 an image.
Checking out
When someone wins or buys an item, eBay’s checkout integrates directly 
with PayPal. If you’re closing less than 100 auctions a day, that’s all you 
need. eBay and PayPal will also send an e-mail to you and the buyer so that 
you can arrange for payment.
A personalized winner’s notification e-mail can easily contain a link to your 
PayPal payment area, making a checkout service unnecessary.
Printing shipping labels
Printing shipping labels without printing postage can be the beginning of a 
laborious two-step process. I recommend two companies, Endicia.com and 
Paypal.com; they can print your labels and postage all in one step. Check out 
Book VII, Chapter 1 for information on how this works.
Some sites, as well as eBay’s Selling Manager, print your winner’s address 
label without postage. That works well if you don’t mind carrying your pack-
ages to the post office for postage. (Why would you do that? A burning need 
to stand in line, I guess!)
Tracking buyer information
Keeping track of your winners isn’t rocket science. You can do it in an Excel 
spreadsheet or a Word document, both of which are exportable to almost 
any program for follow-up mailings promoting future sales. If you choose 
to have an online management service do this for you, be sure that you can 
download the information to your computer (in case you and the online ser-
vice part ways someday).

690
Bonding
Generating customized reports
Sales reports, ledgers, and tax information are all important reports that you 
should have in your business. Online services and software supply different 
flavors of these reports.
PayPal allows you to download your sales data into a format compatible 
with QuickBooks, a highly respected and popular bookkeeping program. You 
can also choose to download your data in Excel spreadsheet format (the 
downloads also work in Microsoft Works). PayPal reports are chock full of 
intensely detailed information about your sales and deposits. Putting this 
information in a standard accounting software program on a regular basis 
makes your year-end calculations easier to bear.
Submitting feedback
If you’re running a lot of listings, leaving feedback can be a chore. One 
solution is to automate the submission of feedback through an online service 
eBay’s Selling Manager Pro. But timing the automation of this task can be 
tricky.
 
Don’t leave feedback for an eBay transaction until after you’ve heard from 
the buyer that the purchase is satisfactory. Leaving positive feedback imme-
diately after you’ve received payment from the buyer is too soon. After you 
receive an e-mail assuring you that the customer is satisfied, manually leav-
ing feedback by going to the feedback forum (or the item page) can be just 
as easy — if not easier — as bulk-loading feedback.
Bonding
Competition for the buyer’s dollars is fierce on eBay. New users arrive at the 
site with three predetermined concepts about eBay:
 
✦ They’re going to find fun and unique items.
 
✦ They’re going to get a deal.
 
✦ There’s a good chance they’ll get ripped off.
For those of us selling on eBay, that last comment hits us right in the gut. Most 
of us work hard to make each customer’s experience a good one on the site, 
and hate it when the 1/100 of 1 percent of bad sellers get all the publicity.
You can counter the public’s misconception that eBay sellers are dishonest 
in two ways: by getting a SquareTrade seal and (ultimately) by getting your 
listings bonded through BuySAFE. In this chapter, I explain both programs 
and show you how they can boost your bottom line — and help you avoid 
getting negative feedback.

Bonding
Bonding your sales with buySAFE
When it comes to high-dollar transactions on eBay, in the past the only 
thing a seller could throw into the sale was escrow. Escrow is a great way to 
protect the buyer, but it ties up the seller’s money for considerably longer 
than necessary. The only approved escrow company currently on eBay is 
escrow.com.
Lately there have been many scandals in the online escrow arena. Fraudsters 
put up bogus Web sites, offer expensive items for sale online, and then run 
the escrow through their bogus site. The buyer, thinking everything is legit, 
sends his or her money. After the money arrives, however, the Web site is 
taken down, the bad guys disappear with the money. Escrow has gotten 
a bad reputation with buyers. The issue is so serious that if you go to the 
escrow.com Web site area at https://escrow.com/fic, you’ll find helpful 
information on how to recognize escrow fraud.
There’s finally a viable alternative to escrow. Something that will make the 
customer feel good about spending buckets of money on your site. Bonding. 
It’s all about potato chips, beer, and Monday Night Football. (No, wait, that’s 
male bonding.) The bonding we’re talking about here refers to guaranteeing 
that a seller will perform as advertised.
All about bonding
A bond warrants that the person (or business) performing the task will com-
plete his or her part of the deal as contracted.
 
A bond is not insurance. Insurance assumes that a loss is a possibility. A 
bond guarantees that a buyer will not suffer a financial loss.
The buySAFE company (an eBay certified developer) has come up with a tra-
ditional bonding plan exclusively for eBay sellers. buySAFE procures surety 
bonds through companies such as Liberty Mutual (one of America’s largest 
financial services provider) to bond eBay sellers’ transactions. The bond 
provides that Liberty Mutual will refund the item sale price or replace the 
item if the seller does not perform as promised in the item listing.
The bond can protect buyers when
 
✦ The bonded seller fails to deliver the item
 
✦ The seller delivers an item different from the one described and pic-
tured in the item listing
 
✦ The seller offers a return or refund policy but refuses to honor it
 
✦ The seller fails to use the shipping method as described in the item 
listing and the item arrives damaged (as when the buyer pays for insur-
ance, but the seller fails to insure the package)

692
Bonding
 
✦ The seller refuses to follow the payment policy described in the item 
listing
 
✦ The seller experiences financial setbacks and does not fulfill the condi-
tions of the sale
A bond basically guarantees that the seller will perform, period. Bonding 
your auctions tells your prospective bidders that you care about the buyer, 
and that you’re a professional seller. This assurance easily can translate into 
more bids and higher final selling prices.
The best part? The seller receives his or her money through regular chan-
nels and doesn’t have to ship the item until paid. No waiting around for 
weeks to get your money because, as is the case with an escrow, you’re at 
the mercy of the system.
I thought bonding was just for high-dollar transactions, but not so! I’ve heard 
from small-time sellers that their total number of bids and their final selling 
price increased by one-third after bonding all their items (even the $5 sales!) 
with the buySAFE seal.
When one of your items is bonded, a seal is displayed, like the one shown in 
Figure 2-8. If prospective buyers click it, they see the details of what the seal 
represents.
 
Figure 2-8: 
This item is

Seller bonding on eBay
You may be wondering whether getting your items bonded on eBay is a big 
deal. It’s not really. Here’s how it works.
Your auctions can get bonded up to a total prescribed dollar amount. The 
total amount of bonded auctions cannot exceed this figure. Think of the 
maximum like a line of credit. You can draw against it until you’ve maxed out 
your line. (The maximum bond coverage per item is $25,000!)

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Managing Your 
Business with 
Third-Party Tools
693
Bonding
To become bonded, you must meet some minimum requirements:
 
✦ $1000 a month in eBay sales
 
✦ An eBay feedback rating of 100
 
✦ eBay feedback that’s 98-percent positive
 
✦ An eBay business based in the United States (but not in the state of 
Hawaii)
If you fulfill those requirements, you then fill out a form on the buySAFE Web 
site, which asks you information about yourself and your business. After 
applying, you undergo a thorough qualification process that evaluates your 
online sales experience and reputation; verifies your identity; and analyzes 
your financial stability. Then you must also legally commit to either honor-
ing their terms of sale or repaying any losses that you may inflict.
 
Yes, you may have great feedback, but bonding is not about the people who 
are already buying from you — the point is to attract new buyers with a 
signal that proves you’re professional and rock-solid.
Bonding items
After you receive approval and know your total bonding amount (based on 
how you were qualified), you may choose which of your auctions to bond 
and which not to bond.
The auctions you choose to bond cost you 1% of the final selling price. If the 
bonded item sells for, say, $3.00 (shipping, handling fees, and taxes are not 
included in the bonded total), your fee is $.03. You pay nothing in advance, 
there are no hidden fees or commitments, and there is no minimum fee. You 
don’t pay a fee if a bonded item doesn’t sell.
A sample Bonded Seller’s Log In page at buySAFE is shown in Figure 2-9. At 
a glance, you can see any of your items that aren’t bonded, as well as check 
your total bonding limit, bonds outstanding (bonds on a sold item are kept 
open for 30 days), and the total of your bonded transactions. Note that live 
help is also available, should you have a question during business hours.
To take a look at your bonded transactions, click the Bonded Transactions 
tab, as shown in Figure 2-10. Here you can see any open items with bonds 
and view any problems that may have arisen.
If you click the item title, you can see the details of an open auction, as 
shown in Figure 2-11.

What happens when something goes wrong?
When a buyer feels slighted in a transaction, that customer is still yours to 
solve the problem with. If the customer contacts buySAFE, he or she is sent 
directly back to you.
If, for some reason, the customer still insists on help resolving the issue, he 
or she may fill out a problem transaction report on the buySAFE Web site, 
stating the problem and what the seller can do to resolve the issue. On your 
Seller Services page, you’ll see a red View Problem button. Click it to display 
the Problem Summary page, and then click the Problem button to see the 
buyer’s comments.
An e-mail is sent to you, and your response is recorded. If nothing has been 
solved after two e-mail exchanges, a professional mediator (a claims repre-
sentative) joins in to solve the problem.
There is no charge for the mediation. The mediator may contact both the 
buyer and seller by phone to get both sides of the story. A bond from a 
surety company, such as Liberty Mutual, is a legal obligation to protect both 
parties. The bond protects the seller from false allegations and the buyer from 
losing his or her money. If no compromise happens, the mediator will make

Bonding
Liberty Mutual is regulated by each state’s insurance department and is held 
accountable by them for adequately investigating each claim. 
 
Bonding is the only licensed and regulated form of seller guarantee.
Although bonding is new to eBay, it has proven to be successful with many 
sellers. If you’d like to give it a whirl, go to

Chapter 3: Studying Your Statistics
In This Chapter
✓ Using a quality tool to increase sales
✓ Finding out when people visit your auctions
F
rom my background in advertising, I know that good-quality research 
can make the difference in whether a business endeavor is a success or 
a failure. In my books and lectures, I always advocate the necessity of doing 
at least the minimal research on any item’s eBay availability and current 
selling pricing.
I also recommend using certain advanced counters (those that break 
down Web-page visits to hours and days, rather than showing only totals), 
because just the number of people who click your page doesn’t tell you 
much. Wouldn’t it be nice to know not only how many people visited your 
listing, but also which page sent them there and what city they come from?
The problem with gathering this kind of information is that the coding and 
programming involved is probably beyond the skill set of even top-level 
eBay sellers. After all, they’re merchants, not computer programmers. 
In this chapter, I tell you about eBay’s Store Traffic Reports, eBay Sales 
Reports Plus, and an online service called ViewTracker that gives you all 
the research you can use. eBay Traffic Reports and Sales Reports Plus are 
automatic (and free) for every eBay Store owner. (If you don’t have an eBay 
Store, Sales Reports Plus can be purchased separately by subscription for 
$4.99 a month.
Best of all, this information, while important for your sales efforts, remains 
noninvasive for your potential customers. For example, in ViewTracker, you 
may find out the timeslots and keywords used by your listing visitors, but 
you find out nothing that compromises their identities.
 
The information service presented in this chapter doesn’t turn your com-
puter into a data-mining robot. It merely gives you the information available 
to every Web site on the Internet. That is, it gives you information such as 
geographic location, which follows the IP address of all eBay users who visit 
your listings. This service is not an invasion of privacy like the data-mining 
cookies explained in the sidebar “Flushing out the moles.”

698
eBay Sales Reports Plus
Companies such as Mediaplex and DoubleClick make a living by placing 
cookies on your computer as you browse the Internet. These cookies follow 
your browsing trail and report your comings and goings to their motherships. 
Mediaplex and DoubleClick sell that information to the big guys so they can 
better figure out who their customers are. If you never want Mediaplex to 
track your Internet browsing, go to www.mediaplex.com/mojo_privacy_
statement.shtml, scroll down the page to the Click Here to Install 
Mediaplex Opt-Out Cookies link. Click it and you will automatically be opted 
out on the computer you’re using. To disengage DoubleClick from your Web 
roaming, visit http://optout.doubleclick.net/cgi-bin/dclk/
optout.pl to opt out. I’ve found that page working only intermittently, so 
you can also go to www.doubleclick.com/privacy/ and scroll down to 
the many opt-out links.
eBay Sales Reports Plus
eBay offers a useful tool to track your sales in one place. No longer do you 
need to download sales files, place them on a spreadsheet, and start to 
cipher — its all done for you. You can view the report at any time from your 
My eBay page, and see an instant graphic chart of your sales progress. Take 
a look at my current Sales Reports Plus report in Figure 3-1.
You’ll get the following sales information:
 
✦ Total sales: The total revenue generated by sales of your items by month.
 
✦ Month-to-month sales growth: The percentage of increase (or decrease) 
of your gross revenue from month to month. It may also be viewed from 
week to week.
 
✦ Ended listings: The total number of listings completed during the month.
 
✦ Ended items: The number of items represented in your ended listings. 
(Store and fixed-price listings usually represent multiple quantities.)
There’s no place to hide on the Internet: Every 
one of your keystrokes and visits to Web sites 
can be traced back to you. There’s big money 
in this data as well. If you’ve ever used a pro-
gram like Spybot Search & Destroy (a program 
that finds data-mining programs that have been 
placed on your computer when you visit certain 
Web sites), you know how much more data sites 
want about their visitors. My daughter down-
loaded the free version of Spybot and found 632 
data-mining cookies slowing down her com-
puter! Spybot can be downloaded for free from 
many sites; just Google Spybot to find it.

Thank goodness eBay also supplies data on fees. eBay fees (for listing, 
options, and Final Value) can often get out of control and cause a seller’s 
profits to spiral downward quickly. Here you can see your total eBay fees 
(less any credits) as well as your total PayPal fees. Sadly, you’ll have to work 
out the fees as a percentage of your sales yourself:
Fee percentage = (net eBay and PayPal fees / total sales) * 100
You’ll also get to see how many unpaid item reminders you filed, how many 
final value fee refunds you claimed, and the percentage of unpaid items as a 
percentage of your total sales. You will not see the actual dollar figure.

You can also access this data segregated by auctions, fixed-price sales, and 
store items.
Lastly, you can see which days of the week were most successful for you and 
your average price per item. You get this data in chart format, as shown in 
Figure 3-2, and in text. Although nothing can replace using a quality book-
keeping program such as QuickBooks, these reports can give you good sales 
data at a glance.

Using Sellathon ViewTracker
Using Sellathon ViewTracker
ViewTracker from Sellathon answers the most popular questions I’m asked 
by eBay sellers. Before ViewTracker, when trying to figure out the exact time 
and day to end an auction, you had to do a considerable amount of research 
by running test auctions on the eBay site. Now you can follow the body 
clocks of your buyers and find out when they search for your type of item.
You will also find out (I just love this!) which keywords the visitor’s browser 
was using when he or she came to your listing. This information is crucial 
when writing titles — and planning keyword campaigns.
Here’s a partial list of the type of data you can get by using the ViewTracker 
system:
 
✦ Sequential number of the visitor. Is this the 19th visitor or the 104th — 
and did this person come back again?
 
✦ Date and time the visitor arrived at your auction.
 
✦ Visitor’s IP address. (By clicking the IP address in the Sellathon screen, 
you can see only those visits originating from this IP address.)
 
✦ What city, state, and country your visitor is from.
 
✦ Whether the reserve price was met when the visitor arrived.
 
✦ When the item receives a bid (and how many have been placed to that 
moment).
 
✦ Whether the current visitor is the high bidder, a bidder who has been 
outbid, or not a bidder.
 
✦ Whether the visitor has chosen to watch this listing in his or her My 
eBay page.
 
✦ Whether your visitors browsed a category, searched a category, 
searched all of eBay, used eBay’s Product Finder utility, or came from 
See Seller’s Other Items page or some other page.
 
• If they were browsing, which category were they browsing when they 
clicked your listing?
 
• If searching, what search terms did they use to find your item?
 
• If they were searching when they came upon your item, did the 
visitors search titles only, or titles and descriptions?

702
Using Sellathon ViewTracker
 
✦ Whether the user elected to view Auctions Only, Buy It Now, or both.
 
✦ Whether the user refined his or her searches using specific parameters, 
including these: Show/Hide pictures, Sellers that accept PayPal, Price 
Range, International Availability, Regional Searching, Gallery View, and 
Show Gift Items.
 
✦ Was there a preference in the way the visitor sorted his or her search 
results? Did the search sort items from high price to low price?
Amazing stuff, eh? By applying the information from ViewTracker, you can 
change tactics to help your little business become a big one. You’ll be able 
to customize your items to match your very own eBay market.
 
Setting up your account is painless. After you give your contact information 
to Sellathon (and make up a new user ID and password for the site), you are 
presented with a small amount of code to add to your listing’s description. 
It’s that easy.
Checking out your data
In this section, I show you a portion of the data screens from my 
ViewTracker account. But keep one thing in mind: I’ve been busy writing 
this book, so I haven’t had much time to list tons of items on eBay. The few 
I have listed (I have to keep up my status as a PowerSeller!) will give you a 
good idea of what you’ll see.
When you first log on to ViewTracker, you’ll be presented with your General 
(Combined items) page. Here you’ll see a couple of statistics. Keep in mind 
that ViewTracker constantly tracks your items in real time, so the data may 
change by the minute as you’re changing screens within the program!
After you log on to your account, you see a snapshot of your current sales 
activity and a graph showing your views (hits) over the past 24 hours, as 
shown in Figure 3-3.
On the initial home page, you’ll see some other very interesting data:
 
✦ The total value of all bids placed on your auctions, the number of people 
watching your items, the average visits per auction, and the total hits on 
all your items.
 
✦ A listing of your live and expired auctions. You can click links here to get 
general information on all your auctions, or click the folder to view infor-
mation on individual items.
Although I don’t really want to give away any of my deep dark secrets, I can 
show you a few screens of data from my expired (closed items) so you know 
what to look for. The first, in Figure 3-4, shows the most active time of the 
day for my auctions by hits.

The next graph you access is the most active day of the week. Figure 3-5 is a

data would be when you analyze data from auctions from a similar category. 
For example, golf equipment, DVD, women’s apparel — you get the picture. 
Remember, this data covers all my listings; this isn’t for one particular item 
(although you can get that data as well).
Figure 3-4 was captured mid-day on the last days of August 2008. Compare 
that to Figure 3-6, which was taken in Spring 2004. Note the differences in the 
hit pattern. The comparison clearly demonstrates how important it is to stay 
on top of these statistics.

There is also a chart that shows you the way people came to your auctions. 
This is the best way to see whether things you’ve been doing to boost sales 
are working. For example, are you taking the best advantage of targeting your 
cross-promotions? Does your Web site send people to your eBay listings?
Other data graphs are available, but the very best is the Top Search Terms 
Used to find your items. This chart will give you definitive data so you’ll 
know which keywords to include in your titles. (Sorry, I’d love to show you 
my top keywords, but that’s a secret! When you work up a list of your own, 
you’ll know exactly where I’m coming from.)

shows you data from a quick auction that ended with a Buy It Now transaction.

Book VIII: Power Selling

Chapter 4: Becoming a PowerSeller
In This Chapter
✓ Qualifying for PowerSeller status
✓ Moving up the tiers
✓ Understanding the benefits
W
hen you browse through the items on eBay, you’re bound to notice a 
PowerSeller icon next to a member’s user ID. To the uninitiated, this 
may look like an award given to a used car salesman for bullying hundreds 
of people into expensive car leases — but it’s not. The eBay PowerSeller 
status is given only to those sellers who uphold the highest levels of profes-
sionalism on the site. Take a look at mine in Figure 4-1.
 
Figure 4-1: 
My proudly 
displayed 
PowerSeller 
icon.
 
eBay refers to PowerSellers as “pillars of the community.” I say they’re 
smart businesspeople. PowerSellers have to maintain certain monthly levels 
of gross merchandise sales (total dollar amount of eBay sales — GMS in 
eBay-speak), and they get there by providing good items for sale and excel-
lent customer service.
You may notice that many sellers on the site with feedback ratings in the 
tens of thousands do not have the PowerSeller embellishment on their auc-
tions. That’s not because they’re not good people; it’s just that some of their 
transactions may have gone awry and resulted in negative feedback. In this 
case, be sure to check the seller’s feedback and thoughtfully evaluate it. 
Many times buyers do not read the seller’s policies before they buy — and 
then give negative feedback (as in the case of buyers not reading the seller’s 
warnings when buying liquidation merchandise).

708
First Steps to PowerSeller Status
First Steps to PowerSeller Status
To become a PowerSeller on eBay, you must fulfill the following 
requirements:
 
✦ Be an active eBay member for at least 90 days
 
✦ Sell a minimum of $1,000 in sales or 100 items per month, for three 
consecutive months
 
 Or
 
 a minimum average of items sold on the site per month for the past 
three months
 
✦ Sell a minimum of $12,000 or 1,200 items for the prior twelve months
 
✦ Have a minimum overall feedback rating of 100
 
✦ Maintain at least a 98 feedback percentage
 
✦ Keep your eBay account current
 
✦ Comply with all eBay policies
 
✦ Maintain a maintain a rating of 4.5 or higher for the past 12 months in all 
four Detailed Seller Ratings (DSRs)
 
✦ Run your business by upholding eBay’s community values (see sidebar).
eBay sends you a notification when you qualify. If you feel you have qualified 
and may have accidentally deleted the e-mail, find the PowerSeller’s page 
from the Site Map link and attempt to log in.
PowerSeller Tiers
Being a PowerSeller gives you membership in an exclusive club. That club 
has five levels of membership, depending on your monthly sales, as shown 
in Table 4-1. Each PowerSeller tier gives the seller more privileges from 
eBay. One of the most valuable benefits is that when an issue needs to be 
addressed with eBay, PowerSellers can access priority customer-service 
support.

The eBay community values aren’t taken lightly 
by the eBay community and eBay employees. 
The values were set out early on by the com-
pany’s founder, Pierre Omidyar.
 ✓ We believe people are basically good.
 ✓ We believe everyone has something to 
contribute.
 ✓ We believe that an honest, open environ-
ment can bring out the best in people.
 ✓ We recognize and respect everyone as a 
unique individual.
 ✓ We encourage you to treat others the way 
that you want to be treated.
All eBay sellers are expected to uphold these 
tenets in all their dealings on the site. Okay, no 
snickering from the peanut gallery; we all know 
that quite a few sellers don’t follow these pre-
cepts. But then, they’re not PowerSellers, are 
they?

There’s no official indication of it, but I’ll bet if you’re a Diamond level 
PowerSeller that John Donahoe (eBay’s CEO) will arrange babysitting for you 
when you’re in a jam. Now I don’t know it to be gospel . . . but I’m just sayin’ . . .
It’s a serious matter to comply with eBay policies, but PowerSellers get a 
little leeway. They also get to know exactly how much “leeway” they can get 
away with. Table 4-2 below shows how much eBay allows the various levels 
of PowerSellers to get away with.

PowerSeller Program Benefits
As a PowerSeller, you have access to some super-secret places on the 
eBay site reserved for PowerSellers! There’s a PowerSeller newsgroup, 
PowerSeller discussion board, and even special items at the eBay store. All 
this magic is accessed by the screen shown in Figure 4-2, at
pages.ebay.com/powerseller
You must log in to this area, and only PowerSellers are allowed to enter.
eBay has come to value that quality sellers give people the best buying 
experience on the site. So they’ve devised a plan (tied into those gnarly 
Detailed Seller Ratings) to reward PowerSellers who play by the rules. In 
addition to receiving premium support, eBay PowerSellers get other benefits:
 
✦ Increased visibility in Best Match search: Now eBay gives the advantage 
to the listings of the upper half of sellers in terms of buyer satisfaction. 
Sellers with detailed seller ratings above 4.7 in the last 30 days will 
receive 5 to 25 percent more exposure than the average seller. 
 
✦ Discounts on Final Value Fees: Now, this is a reward I can appreciate. 
eBay discounts the Final Value Fees on the monthly bill to PowerSellers 
who maintain high standards. (Your DSR ratings must be 4.6 or higher 
in all four categories to get the discount). See Table 4-3 for the discount 
amounts.

have the opportunity to purchase exclusive health insurance.
 
✦ Approved use of PowerSeller logo: eBay supplies PowerSellers with 
special templates so that they may print custom business cards and 
stationery that includes the official PowerSeller logo.
 
✦ Unpaid Item Protection: PowerSellers not only get Final Value Fee 
and listing credits when faced with a non-paying buyer, they also get a 
credit for any Listing Upgrade Fees (for example, Buy It Now, Bold, or 
Subtitle) — you know, all that extra fluff.
 
✦ Reseller Marketplace: This is a super-secret benefit for PowerSellers — 
and certainly reason enough to become one. eBay runs a site (just for 
PowerSellers) that sells liquidations and wholesale merchandise to 
PowerSellers. The home page is pictured in Figure 4-3.

Chapter 5: Opening 
Your eBay Store
In This Chapter
✓ Figuring out the lure of the online shop
✓ Understanding the costs
✓ Setting up an eBay Store
✓ Marketing and making a sale
I
f you’re doing well selling your items on eBay auctions, why open an 
eBay Store? Well, have you used the eBay Buy It Now feature in one of 
your listings? Did it work? In an eBay Store, all items are set at a fixed price 
and remain online until canceled (or listed for as few as 30 days), so it’s kind 
of like a giant collection of Buy It Now featured items. Get the idea?
Opening an eBay Store can expand your business. eBay is stressing the 
fixed-price format on the site these days, and buyers are looking for that 
format. The more that savvy buyers learn about eBay Stores, the more 
popular they become. The more popular they become, the more people buy 
from them. Simple. An eBay Store provides you with your own little corner 
of eBay where you can leverage your good relationships with your custom-
ers and sell directly to them. But eBay Stores are not a total solution, and 
having an eBay Store isn’t a one-way ticket to Easy Street.
I get e-mails all the time from people who open an eBay Store and are not 
successful in moving merchandise. Why? Because running an eBay Store 
takes an extra level of effort. Simple. No matter how many money-back 
guarantees you receive from online spammers promising magical success 
on eBay, the only magic is putting your shoulder, nose, and whatever else 
to the grindstone — and exerting the effort necessary to bring customers to 
your store.
 
If you’re just beginning on eBay, the best advice I can give is to hold off on 
opening an eBay Store until your feedback rating is over 100. Participating in 
transactions on eBay is a natural teacher because you’ll see mistakes that 
sellers make when they sell to you. Some sellers will send you e-mails that 
are plain unfriendly, and you’ll have a true understanding of how quality 
customer service will help you build your business. You’ll also learn from 
your own mistakes and be able to provide better service to your customers.

714
Locating Your Special Place Online
Locating Your Special Place Online
When you’re opening a store, you have just three main rules to remember 
and apply: location, location, location. If you were going to open a brick-and-
mortar store, you could open it, for example, in the corner strip mall, at a 
shopping center, or even somewhere downtown. You’d have to decide in 
what location your store would do best; that goes for an online store as well. 
You’ll find tons of locations to open an online store, including online malls 
(when you can find them) and sites such as Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and (of 
course) eBay.
You have to pay rent for your online store, but opening and running an 
online store isn’t nearly as expensive as a store in the real world (where you 
also have to pay electrical bills, maintenance bills, and more). Plus, the ratio 
of rent to sales makes an online store a much easier financial decision, and 
your store’s exposure to the buying public can be huge.
 
eBay wants you to succeed as well. After all, the more you sell, the more 
eBay earns in Final Value Fees.
Checking Out Online Stores Galore
Amazon.com, WalMart, and eBay make up the big three of online stores. 
They’re the top locations and get the most visitors. According to comScore 
Media Metrix, in July 2008 these sites garnered an astounding number of 
unique visitors (counting all of one person’s visits to the sites just once a 
month):
 
✦ WalMart: 31,637,000 Think about this when you consider whether 
people are still shopping the Web looking for bargains.
 
✦ eBay: 120,173,000
 
✦ Amazon.com: 58,462,000 (it sells books, CDs, DVDs, and lots of other 
merchandise).
No doubt feeling competition from Yahoo! Small Business and Amazon.com, 
eBay decided to open its doors (in July 2001) to sellers who wanted their 
own stores. The fixed-price stores were a normal progression for eBay in its 
quest to continue as the world’s marketplace. And eBay Stores make sense: 
They’re a benefit to all current eBay sellers, and open doors to new shop-
pers who don’t want to deal with auctions.
eBay itself is a kind of online store that specializes in selling your stuff, not 
theirs. It doesn’t stock a stick of merchandise and it isn’t in competition with 
you. In addition to its staggering number of visitors, eBay offers you the 
most reasonable store rent, as shown in Table 5-1.

Amazon ended their reasonably-priced zShops in October 2006, to move 
sellers to their more expensive Amazon WebStores. I don’t think it’s going 
to take a rocket scientist to convince you that having a space in eBay Stores 
(see Figure 5-1) is an excellent bargain. Keep in mind that eBay is based on 
merchandise sales, and the public actively shops eBay Stores. I know the 
stores aren’t based on auctions, but Buy It Now items are as easy to handle 
as auctions. To review prices and rules before opening your store, go to

Deciding to Open a Store
So you think it’s time to open a store, eh? If you feel it in your gut and you’re 
ready to take the leap, here’s what you need to know. eBay has few require-
ments when it comes to opening an eBay Store:
 
✦ Registered user: You need to be a registered seller on the eBay site with 
a credit card on file.
 
✦ Feedback rating: You must have a feedback rating of 20 or higher, or 
be ID Verified, or have a PayPal account in good standing. .You can also 
qualify without the 20 feedback if you are ID Verified — but you really 
won’t have enough experience to run your store.
It doesn’t get much easier than that! Personally, I like to add these additional 
prerequisites to back you up for success:
 
✦ PayPal account: You need to have a business or premier (personal) 
PayPal account (and if you have that, you’re PayPal Verified) to accept 
credit cards. Accepting credit cards is a necessity for building sales, and 
PayPal is integrated into the site, as well as being widely accepted by 
buyers.
 
 Be sure you understand how a PayPal account works so you can decide 
on the types of payments you will accept — and from which countries 
you intend to do business.
 
✦ Sales experience: Having selling (and buying) experience over and 
above the 20 transactions required by eBay is a big plus. The best 
teacher (aside from this book) is the school of hard knocks.
 
✦ Merchandise: Opening an eBay Store with only one each of ten items 
isn’t a good idea. You need to have enough merchandise to support con-
sistent sales in your store.
 
✦ Devotion: You need to have the time to check into your eBay business 
at least once a day, and the time to ship the purchased merchandise in a 
prompt manner.
 
The items listed as store inventory will not come up in an eBay search 
unless eBay can come up with thirty or less of the item searched for. The 
only way new buyers can find your store inventory is by clicking the Find 
Items in eBay Stores link in eBay Search, by searching items on the store hub 
page (as shown in Figure 5-2), or by clicking from one of your auction pages 
to see what else you have on sale.

Choosing Between Store Types

Stores hub.
 
Choosing Between Store Types
All eBay Stores are on a level playing field. They’re all equally searchable for 
the eBay Stores hub page, so you can be right up there with the big guys and 
compete. The only cost differential is the type of store you want to open.
All eBay Stores have the following in common:
 
✦ Listings: All your eBay listings, whether auction, fixed-price, or store 
inventory, will appear in your eBay Store.
 
✦ Custom URL: Your eBay Store will have its own Internet address that 
you can use in links in promotional material — even to promote your 
store on the Internet.
 
✦ Store search: When customers visit your eBay Store, they will be able 
to search within your listings for their desired item — with your own 
personal search engine.
 
✦ Cross-promotions: You have the ability to insert thumbnail promotions 
for your store items within each of your items for sale on the regular 
eBay site.
 
✦ Seller reports: You’ll receive monthly reports on your store sales via 
e-mail.

718
Choosing Between Store Types
Although you will need to pay a small fee for each listing, eBay Store rental is 
available on three levels:
 
✦ Basic store: For $15.95 a month, you get your own eBay Store with all 
the benefits.
 
✦ Featured store: You get all the benefits of a basic store, plus there will 
be a link to your store from the store category page and randomly on 
the eBay Stores hub page. You also get more advanced sales reports. 
This type of store will set you back $49.95 per month.
 
✦ Anchor store: This is a top-of-the-line store on eBay. For $299.95 a 
month, your store logo rotates with others on the eBay Stores hub page. 
Your logo also randomly appears on eBay’s home page. When prospective 
buyers are browsing eBay Store categories, you logo will show up at the 
top of the pages.
 
There is no limit to the number of items you put up for sale in the basic 
store. An anchor store can have as few or as many items as the basic store.
Many high-level PowerSellers find that the basic eBay Store fulfills their needs.
 
When people visit your eBay Store, they have no way of knowing whether 
you have a basic, featured, or anchor store. The design of your store is up to 
you — you can make it as fancy as you want.
Yes! The honchos at eBay are really smart. By 
promoting your eBay Store on your Web site 
and linking to your eBay Store, you can save 75 
percent of your Final Value Fees on the items 
you sell through the referral link. It’s a win-win 
situation. You draw people to your eBay Store, 
where you can have a more robust layout and 
features, and save on fees — and eBay gets 
more visitors coming to the site!
To get the referral bonus, you must set up a 
special link consisting of your eBay Store URL 
and some code. Here’s my referral link, with 
the referral code in boldface text:
http://stores.ebay.com/marshac
olliersfabulousfinds?refid
=store
This code can also be used in promotional 
e-mails that you send out. The only bad thing 
is that customers have to purchase the item 
during the same browser session as when they 
enter your store from outside eBay.
It’s definitely worth a try! Check out the figure 
to see a part of one of my eBay invoices; it 
shows how the savings can stack up!

Knowing the Fee Structure
Knowing the Fee Structure
When you have an eBay Store, other fees are involved (are you surprised?) 
in addition to the rental fee: listing fees, options fees, and final value fees. 
First up, the listing fees, which are shown in Table 5-2.
Table 5-2 
Store Inventory Listing Fees

Listing your items for a l-o-o-o-n-g time may be tempting as a way to auto-
mate your listings — and it’s a good strategy. However, after someone makes 
a purchase from an item listing, you can no longer make description 
changes; you can only update inventory. If you have a new picture or new 
ideas for a title or a description, you must close that listing and relist the 
item with the new information. Also, if you have an unpaid item, you must 
close the store listing to file for your Final Value Fee refund. 
Items in an eBay Store carry a similar fee structure as items listed on the 
eBay site, but the actual numbers and percentages are different. The differ-
ence in cost helps you decide which items to put in your store, your auc-
tions, or on your Web site. Knowing the prices in Tables 5-3 and 5-4 up front 
helps you to decide what you need to get for each item in the different sales 
formats.

For a more detailed description on how to calculate fees, see Book III, 
Chapter 1.
 
The basic eBay Store gives you free use of Selling Manager. The only hook is, 
they don’t just hand you the privilege; you have to go to the Selling Manager 
sign-up page and sign up. You’ll see that as a store owner you won’t be 
charged, but you must go through the Sign Up process to avail yourself of 
these great tools.
Mind your underscores and hyphens
If you want to use your eBay user ID for your 
store name, you can — unless it contains a 
hyphen (-) or an underscore (_). Remember how 
eBay recommends that you break up words in 
your user ID with a dash or an underscore? Uh 
oh, that’s no good for an eBay Store name. I’m 
in that situation. My user ID is marsha_c — 
but without the underscore, it translates into a 
user ID that someone else has already taken! 
Even though it hasn’t been used since 1999, 
someone else has it, which means I can’t use 
it. (marsha_c is probably a crummy name for 
a store anyway!) A favorite seller of mine — 
mrswarren — realized that mrswarren isn’t a 
good name for a store, either. So she named 
her store Pretty Girlie Things, which suits her 
merchandise to a T.

Selecting Your eBay Store Name
You’ve decided to take the plunge and open an eBay Store. Have you 
thought of a good name for your store? Your store name doesn’t have to 
match your eBay user ID, but they’re more recognizable if they relate to each 
other. You can use your company name, your business name, or a name that 
describes your business. I recommend that you use the same name for your 
eBay Store that you plan to use in all your online businesses. By doing so, 
you’ll begin to create an identity (or as the pros call it, a brand) that custom-
ers will come to recognize and trust.
 
Your online eBay Store should not replace your Web site (see Book VI); it 
should be an extension of it. When people shop at your eBay Store, take the 
opportunity to make them customers of your Web site through your store’s 
About the Seller page (which is also your About Me page on eBay). Good 
deal!
Setting Up Shop
It’s time to get down to business. Go to the eBay Stores hub and click the 
Open a Store link , on the right side of the screen (refer to Figure 5-1). This 
takes you to the Seller’s hub of eBay Stores. If you click all the links you see 
here, you get the eBay company line about how good an eBay Store can be 
for your business. You already know how good an eBay Store can be for 
your business, so skip the propaganda and get right down to business (but 
don’t forget to check for any policy changes that may affect your store’s 
operations).
 
Before you click that link to open your store, ask yourself two questions:
 
✦ Can I make a serious commitment to my eBay Store? A store is a com-
mitment. It won’t work for you unless you work for it. You have to have 
the merchandise to fill it and the discipline to continue listing store and 
auction items. Your store is a daily, monthly, and yearly obligation.
 
 When you go on vacation, you need someone else to ship your items; 
otherwise your customers may go elsewhere. You can use the eBay 
Store’s Vacation Feature and eBay will either close your items or put up 
a notification letting your customers know that you’re on vacation until 
a specified date.

722
Setting Up Shop
 
✦ Will I work for my eBay Store even when I don’t feel like it? You have 
to be prepared for the times when you’re sick or just don’t feel like ship-
ping, but orders are waiting to be shipped. You have to do the work 
anyway; it’s all part of the commitment.
eBay gives you the venue, but it’s in your own hands to make your mercan-
tile efforts a success. If you can handle these two responsibilities, read on!
Subscribing to Stores and selecting a name
If you’re serious and ready to move on, click the white Open a Store bar in 
the top center of the page (refer to Figure 5-2). Because you’re always signed 
in on your home computer, you’re escorted to Subscribe to eBay Stores and 
eventually a page reminding you that eBay Stores fall under the same User 
Agreement that you agreed to when you began selling on eBay. 
eBay wants to ease you into this store thing. Make you feel comfortable, 
so you’ll get the easy stuff first. Figure 5-3 below shows you the initial sign 
up screen, where you get to select the level of store you want. It’s an easy 
choice, start small with the $15.95 version. Come to think of it, many sellers 
have been running the basic version for years and have been very happy 
with it.
You’ve decided on a store name, right? Because here’s where you need to 
type it in. Your eBay Store name can’t exceed 35 characters. Before you 
type it, double-check that you aren’t infringing on anyone’s copyrights or 
trademarks. You also can’t use any permutation of eBay trademarks in your 
store’s name.

After you’ve clicked the page’s proverbial Continue button, eBay has a little 
page to show you a couple of benefits of opening your store. With the basic 
store you get Selling Manager and Sales Reports Plus for free. You don’t have 
to do anything but click Continue because eBay already inserted the check-
marks in the selection boxes for you. If for some reason they don’t appear, 
put a check by clicking each of the boxes and click, duh…. Continue.
The resulting page is where they start to get serious. It shows your monthly 
charges and the User Agreement (see Figure 5-4). Here eBay changes their 
friendly Continue button to Subscribe. That’s to let you know that this is seri-
ous. Once you click Subscribe the clock starts to tick on your monthly fees.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Why not 
give the 
User 
Agreement 
a read 
before 
checking 
the box?
 
 
Don’t subscribe to a store unless you’re ready to get started immediately. 
Fees start the day you sign up, so why not read this chapter first and get 
centered as to what you want to do.
Once you get to the Store Design pages, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a color theme.
 
 eBay provides some elegant color and graphics themes, as shown in 
Figure 5-5. Until you have the time to go hog-wild and design a custom 
masterpiece, you can choose one of the 14 clearly organized layouts, 
either predesigned or with easily customizable themes. You can always 
change the color scheme or layout for your eBay Store later. Don’t select 
something overly bright and vibrant; you want something that’s easy on 
the eyes, which is more conducive to a comfortable selling environment.

724
Setting Up Shop
 
Figure 5-5: 
Selecting a 
theme for 
your store.
 
 
 You have the option of selecting a store theme that doesn’t require you 
to insert a custom logo or banner. I vigorously recommend against skip-
ping the logo. You need to establish a unifying brand for your online 
business.
 
2. Click Continue.
 
3. Type a short description of your store.
 
 When I say short, I mean short. You have only 300 characters to give a 
whiz-bang, electric description of your store and merchandise. You can’t 
use HTML coding to doll up the description, and you can’t use links. Just 
the facts please, and a little bit of dazzle.
 
 Write your copy ahead of time in Word. Then, still in Word, highlight the 
text and choose Tools➪Word Count. Word gives you the word count of 
the highlighted text. Check the character count with spaces, to be sure 
your text fits.
 
 The description is hugely important. The keyword information you put 
here is referenced when someone searches eBay Stores and descrip-
tions. Also, if the store header contains your description (as in the 
Classic style themes), search engines such as Google and Yahoo! look in 
this description for the keywords to classify your merchandise and list 
your store.

4. Select a graphic to jazz up the look of your store.
 
 You can use one of eBay’s clip-art style banners or create a custom 
310by-90-pixel one. If you use one of eBay’s graphics, you must promise 
(hand over heart) that you won’t keep it there for long. (See the text 
after this set of steps for info on designing your own graphics — or 
hiring someone to do it.)
 
 Now you’re getting somewhere. At this point, your eBay Store is just 
about ready to roll. You are about to open an eBay Storefront.
 
5. Click Accept.
 
 Your store is now live on the Internet with nothing up for sale — yet.
 
6. Click the supplied link to get in the trenches and customize your store 
further.
If you’re wondering in which category your store will be listed on the eBay 
Stores home page, it’s up to you. eBay checks the items as you list them in 
the standard eBay category format. For example, if you have six books listed 
in the Books: Fiction and Nonfiction category and five items in the Cameras 
& Photo category, you’ll be in the listings for both categories. Your custom 
store categories (read on) are used to classify items only in your store.
Establishing a store logo
If you use one of eBay’s prefab graphics, people shopping your eBay Store 
will know that you aren’t serious enough about your business to design a 
simple and basic logo. I’ve had many years of experience in advertising and 
marketing, and I must tell you that a custom look will beat clip art any day. 
Your store is special — put forth the effort to make it shine.
If you have a graphics program, design a graphic with your store’s name. 
Start with something simple; you can always change it later when you have 
more time. Save the image as a GIF or JPG file, and upload it to the site where 
you host your images (your own Web site, your ISP, or a hosting service).
 
To get a reasonably priced custom graphic for your eBay Store, search eBay 
for eBay (banner, banners). (Don’t add a space after the comma.) When I 
conducted that search, I found 86 Buy It Now listings for people who are will-
ing to design a custom banner for under $20 — certainly worth the price in 
the time you’ll save. Be sure you like the samples of the seller’s designs and 
are comfortable with the terms before you buy.

Running Your Store
Running Your Store
You can customize your store at any time by clicking the Manage Your 
Store link, which is at the bottom of your store’s page and in the upper-right 
corner of the eBay Store’s hub page. The page shown in Figure 5-6 appears, 
with headings describing important tasks for your store.
 
Figure 5-6:

Store design and marketing
The Store Editing/Branding list of the Manage Your Store page (refer to 
Figure 5-6) has the following links for performing the major tasks required 
for your store:
 
✦ Store Builder: You can go back to the Store Builder (the original store 
setup area) to change the name of your store or the theme of your 
pages. You can also change the way your items are displayed: gallery 
view (as in Figure 5-7) or list view (as in Figure 5-8). Neither view is 
inherently better, but I like the gallery view because it shows larger 
thumbnails of your items.

 You should also select the order in which your items will sort: highest-
priced first, lowest-priced first, items ending first, or newly-listed first. I 
like “ending first” as my sort, so buyers can get the chance to swoop in 
on items closing soon.
 
✦ Custom pages: Most successful eBay sellers have a store policies page. 
Figure 5-9 shows you the one for my store. When you set up a policies 
page, eBay supplies you with a choice of layouts. Just click the Create 
New Page link to see the template that you want to use, as pictured in 
Figure 5-10. Don’t freak out if you don’t know HTML; eBay helps you out 
with an easy-to-use HTML generator as in the Sell Your Item form.

 Following are some important policies to include:
 
• Indicate to what locations you’ll ship. If you won’t ship items over-
seas, it’s best to say so.
 
• Specify the sales tax you plan to collect. If your state doesn’t 
require you to collect sales tax, leave the area blank. If it does, select 
your state and indicate the proper sales tax. Most states won’t 
require you to collect sales tax unless the sale is shipped to your 
home state. Check the links in Book IX, Chapter 1, to verify your 
state’s sales tax regulations.
 
• State your customer service and return policy. Fill in the informa-
tion regarding how you handle refunds, exchanges, and so on. If 
you’re a member of SquareTrade (see Chapter 4), mention here that 
you subscribe to its policies. Be sure to include whatever additional 
store information you think is pertinent.
 
 You can also set up a custom home page for your store, but this isn’t a 
popular option. It’s best to let your visitors go right to the page that lists 
what you’re selling, don’t you think?
 
Figure 5-10: 
eBay Store 
page-

templates.
 
 
✦ Custom categories: Here’s where you really make your store your own. 
You may name up to 300 custom categories that relate to the items you 
sell for your store.

730
Running Your Store
 
✦ Custom listing header: Do this. Don’t ask questions, just do it. The 
custom listing header display is one of the best tools you can use to 
bring people into your store. Click the link and select the option to show 
your custom listing header on all your eBay auctions and fixed-price 
sales. This will encourage shoppers to visit your eBay Store when they 
browse your eBay listings.
 
 When customizing, be sure to include your store logo as well as a store 
search box. In Figure 5-11, you can see how the store header looks at the 
top of an eBay listing.
 
Figure 5-11:

Promotions
eBay has added some excellent ways to promote your store. As an eBay 
Store owner, you have access to promotional tools that other sellers can’t 
use. The most valuable of these is the cross-promotions box — and there’s 
no charge for using it! The cross-promotions box appears after a buyer 
places a bid on or purchases an item from an eBay seller.
The beauty of having a store is that the cross-promotions box appears twice: 
once within your regular listings and again, with a different assortment of 
items (if you want), after someone buys an item. Best of all? You get to select 
which items are shown with your individual auctions.
Figure 5-12 shows you a cross-promotions box that appears when someone 
views one of my auctions.
You can set up the promotions so they default to show other items from 
related store categories, or you can go in and set them up yourself for indi-
vidual auctions. Again, every listing has two sets of options: one for when a 
user views your listings and the other for when someone bids or wins your 
item.

Making a sale
From the buyer’s point of view, shopping at an eBay Store is much different 
than winning an auction. eBay Stores feature fixed-price sales; the buyer 
will get the merchandise as soon as you can ship it (instead of waiting for 
the auction to run its course). Even though your auctions show up on your 
store’s home page, all regular listings in your eBay Store are Buy It Now 
items.
When a buyer makes a purchase from an eBay Store, here’s what happens:
 
1. The buyer clicks the Buy It Now button on the listing page. The Review 
Payments page appears, where the buyer can review the purchase. This 
page contains the shipping amount that you specified when you listed 
the item.
 
2. The buyer provides shipping information (required). When eBay notifies 
you that a sale has been made, you have all the information you need.
 
3. The buyer reviews the transaction and then clicks the Confirm button. 
The information about the sale is e-mailed to you, and the buyer 
receives confirmation of the sale.
Your eBay Store is an essential backup to your auctions. It’s a great place 
to put out-of-season items, accessories for the items you sell actively, and 
even consignment items between relistings. Considering the price of an eBay 
Store, you have to make only a few sales per month to pay for it. And when 
your sales start to build, your efforts will be greatly rewarded!

f you’ve played around on eBay, had some fun, and made a few dollars, 
good for you — enjoy yourself! Once you start making serious money, 
however, your business is no longer a hobby. It’s time to consider some 
issues such as business structure, tax planning, and licenses.
When you’re concentrating on fulfilling multiple orders and keeping your 
customers happy, the last thing you need is a G-man breathing down your 
neck. Worst case scenario: How about getting audited in December when 
you haven’t been keeping good records all year? I know this sounds like 
stripping the fun out of doing business on eBay, but taking a bit of time and 
effort now can save you a ton of trouble later on (and will save you money 
in penalties).
Giving Your Business an Official Name
In most states in the U.S., you can find funny liner ads in the classified 
section of the local newspaper. They’re called fictitious name statements. 
No, the statements aren’t fictitious, but in effect, the names are — and as 
such, they need to be registered with your state before you can open a 
bank account in a business’s name. They let the state know who owns and 
operates a business. In California, you must file a fictitious name statement 
within 40 days of the commencement of your business. (Other state laws 
vary, so check the Web sites listed later in this chapter for more information 
on your state’s requirements.) Your statement must also include a physical 
address where the business is operated — not a post-office-box address.
 
Before you assume that registering a name isn’t required in your state, 
check with your state’s business code. (Links to all 50 states are presented 
later in the chapter.) Some states, such as Indiana, require that you register 
the assumed name of your business with the Secretary of State.

736
Taking Care of Regulatory Details
In the states requiring publication, your fictitious name statement must be 
published in an adjudicated (officially approved) newspaper for a certain 
amount of time. Ostensibly, this is to let the community know that a busi-
ness is starting and who owns it. The newspaper supplies you with a proof 
of publication, which you keep in your files as a record of your filing. You 
generally have to renew the statement after a prescribed number of years.
After you have your officially stamped proof of publication, you can bring that 
to the bank and open an account in your business name, which is an impor-
tant step in separating your personal living expenses from the business.
Taking Care of Regulatory Details
Let me give you some important advice to make your life easier in the long 
run: Don’t ignore city, county, state, and federal regulatory details. Doing so 
may seem to make life easier at the get-go, but if your business is successful, 
one day your casual attitude will catch up with you. The usual attitude of gov-
ernment is that “Ignorance of the law is no excuse.” You must comply with all 
the rules and regulations that are set up for your protection and benefit.
Business license or city tax certificate
Business licenses are the official-looking pieces of paper you see behind the 
register at brick-and-mortar businesses. Every business must have one, and 
depending on your local laws, you may have to have a city license or a city 
tax registration certificate. Yes, even if you’re running a business out of your 
home and have no one coming to do business at your home, you may still 
need this. If you don’t have one, the authorities may charge you a bunch of 
penalties if they ever find out. Avoiding this step isn’t worth that risk.
All kinds of expensive services on the Internet 
are more than willing to handle the work for 
you for a fat fee. Don’t spend too much of your 
money if you don’t have to. If newspaper publi-
cation is required, look in the phone book for a 
small community newspaper (if they still exist 
in your part of the world) and call them to see 
whether they handle this type of legal ad. Most 
small newspapers are 90-percent supported 
by the money they make on filing legal ads. 
They’re the experts on this type of filing. Plus, 
you get to help out another small business in 
your community. Every 5 years, it’s a good thing 
to file your company’s DBA (Doing Business 
As) with the nice gray-haired lady at the local 
newspaper office.
If there’s no small-time newspaper near where 
you live, go to my Web site (www.coolebay
tools.com) for a discount for the LegalZoom 
Web site (www.legalzoom.com). They 
will handle your DBA filing professionally and 
quickly (and you don’t have to drive around).
Don’t waste your money!

State sales tax number
If your state has a sales tax, a sales tax number (the number you use when you 
file your sales tax statement with your state) is required before you officially 
sell anything. If sales tax applies, you may have to collect the appropriate 
sales tax for every sale that ships within the state that your business is in.
Some people also call this a resale certificate because when you want to 
purchase goods from a wholesaler within your state, you must produce this 
number (thereby certifying your legitimacy as a seller) so the dealer can sell 
you the merchandise without charging you sales tax.
To find the regulations for your state, try the following terrific site that 
supplies links to every state’s tax board, which should have the answers to 
your questions:
www.taxadmin.org/fta/link/forms.html
Don’t withhold the withholding forms
If you’re going to be paying anyone a salary, you’ll need an employer identifi-
cation number (EIN), also known as a Federal tax identification number. Every 
business has one. It’s like a Social Security Number for a business, identifying 
your business on all government forms: a nine-digit number assigned to all 
businesses for tax filing and reporting. You may also need one for your state.

740
Selecting a Business Format
If you have regular employees, you need to file withholding forms to collect 
the necessary taxes that you must send to the state and the IRS on behalf 
of your employees. You’re also expected to deposit those tax dollars with 
the IRS and your state on the date required, which may vary from business 
to business. Many enterprises go down because the owners just can’t seem 
to keep their fingers out of withheld taxes — which means the money isn’t 
available to turn in when the taxes are due. (This is another reason you 
should have a separate bank account for your business.)
No need to dawdle. Why not get the number while you have the time:
 
✦ There’s no charge to get your employer ID number (EIN).
 
✦ An employer ID number can be assigned by filing IRS form SS-4. Go to 
the IRS Web site to apply online:
www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=102767,00.
html
 
 Or if you’d rather mail in the form, the details and downloadable form 
are available as a PDF file.
 
✦ State employer ID numbers for taxes may depend on your state’s 
requirements. Visit the following for an overview of the requirements for 
every state in the country:
www.taxadmin.org/fta/forms.ssi
Selecting a Business Format
After you’ve fulfilled all the regulatory details, you need to formally decide 
how you want to run your company. You need to set up a legal format and 
you need to make a merchandise plan. (For more on merchandise planning, 
visit Book IV, Chapter 2.)
When you have a business, any type of business, it has to have a legal format 
for licensing and tax purposes. Businesses come in several forms, from a 
sole proprietorship all the way to a corporation. A “corporation” designation 
isn’t as scary as it sounds. Yes, Microsoft, IBM, and eBay are corporations, 
but so too are many individually run businesses.
Each form of business has its pluses and minuses — and costs. I go over 
some of the fees involved in incorporating later in this chapter. For now, 
I detail the most common types of businesses, which I encourage you to 
weigh carefully.

Book IX
Chapter 1

and the Feds
741
Selecting a Business Format
 
I’m not a lawyer, so be sure to consult with a professional in the legal and 
financial fields to get the latest legal and tax ramifications of the various 
business formats.
Sole proprietorship
If you’re running your business by yourself part-time or full-time, your busi-
ness is a sole proprietorship. Yep, doesn’t that sound official? A sole propri-
etorship is the simplest form of business; you don’t need a lawyer to set 
it up. Nothing is easier or cheaper. Most people use this form of business 
when they’re starting out. Many people often graduate to a more formal type 
of business as things get bigger.
 
If a husband and wife file a joint tax return, they can run a business as a sole 
proprietorship (but only one of you can be the proprietor). However, if both 
you and your spouse work equally in the business, then running it as a part-
nership — with a written partnership agreement — is a much better idea. 
(See the next section, “Partnership,” for more information.) A partnership 
protects you in case of your partner’s death. In a sole proprietorship, the 
business ends with the death of the proprietor. If the business has been a 
sole proprietorship in your late spouse’s name, you may be left out in the 
cold.
Being in business adds a few expenses, but many things that you spend 
money on now (relating to your business) can be deducted from your state 
and federal taxes. A sole proprietorship can be run out of your personal 
checking account (although I don’t advise it). The profits of your busi-
ness are taxed directly as part of your own income tax, and the profits and 
expenses are reported on Schedule C of your 1040 tax package. As a sole 
proprietor, you’re at risk for the business liabilities. All outstanding debts 
are yours, and you could lose personal assets if you default. Also, as your 
business becomes profitable, this business format forces you to pay an addi-
tional self-employment tax.
Also, you must consider the liability of the products you sell on eBay. If you 
sell foodstuffs, vitamins, or nutraceuticals (new-age food supplements) that 
make someone ill, you may be personally liable for any court-awarded dam-
ages. If someone is hurt by something you sell, you may also be personally 
liable as the seller of the product.
 
In a sole proprietorship, as with any form of home-based business, you may 
be able to get an insurance rider to your homeowner’s insurance policy to 
cover you against some liabilities. Check with your insurance agent.

742
Selecting a Business Format
Partnership
When two or more people are involved in a business, it can be a partnership. 
A general partnership can be formed by an oral agreement. Each person in 
the partnership contributes capital or services and both share in the part-
nership’s profits and losses. The income of a partnership is taxed to both 
partners, based on the percentage of the business that they own or upon 
the terms of a written agreement. Any losses are also split. The partnership 
must file its own tax return (Form 1065) reporting the business financials to 
the IRS.
You’d better be sure that you can have a good working relationship with 
your partner: This type of business relationship has broken up many a 
friendship. Writing up a formal agreement when forming your eBay business 
partnership is an excellent idea. This agreement is useful in solving any dis-
putes that may occur over time.
 
In your agreement, be sure to outline things such as
 
✦ How to divide the profits and losses
 
✦ Compensation to each partner
 
✦ Duties and responsibilities of each partner
 
✦ Restrictions of authority and spending
 
✦ How disputes should be settled
 
✦ What happens if the partnership dissolves
 
✦ What happens to the partnership in case of death or disability
One more important thing to remember: As a partner, you’re jointly and 
severally responsible for the business liabilities and actions of the other 
person or people in your partnership — as well as your own. Again, this is a 
personal liability arrangement. You are both personally open to any lawsuits 
that come your way through the business.
The partnership has to file an informational return with the IRS and the 
state, but the profits of the partnership are taxed to the partners on their 
personal individual returns.
LLC (Limited Liability Company)
A limited liability company, or LLC, is similar to a partnership but also has 
many of the characteristics of a corporation. An LLC differs from a partner-
ship mainly in that the liabilities of the company are not passed on to the 
members (owners). Unless you sign a personal guarantee for debt incurred, 
the members are responsible only to the total amount they have invested 
into the company. But all members do have liability for the company’s taxes.

Book IX
Chapter 1
Getting Legal 
with the State 
and the Feds
743
Selecting a Business Format
You’ll need to put together an operating agreement, similar to the partner-
ship agreement. This also will help establish which members own what per-
centage of the company for tax purposes. Most states will require you to file 
Articles of Organization forms to start this type of business.
An LLC is taxed like a sole proprietorship, with the profits and losses passed 
on to the members’ personal tax returns. An LLC may opt to pay taxes like 
a corporation and keep some of the profits in the company, thereby reduc-
ing the tax burden to individual members. Although members pay the LLC’s 
taxes, the LLC must still file Form 1065 with the IRS at the end of the year. 
This gives the IRS extra data to be sure that the individual members prop-
erly report their income.
 
Some states levy additional special or minimum taxes on an LLC. Be sure to 
check with your state’s business department.
C-corporation
A corporation has a life of its own: its own name, its own bank account, and 
its own tax return. A corporation is a legal entity created for the sole purpose 
of doing business. If you’re a sole proprietor and you’re incorporating, one 
of the main problems you face is realizing that you can’t just help yourself 
to the assets of the business. Yes, a corporation can have only one owner — 
but that owner is the shareholder(s). If you can’t accept that you can’t write 
yourself a check from your corporation — unless it’s for a specified salary or 
You just knew legal services would go online 
eventually, didn’t you? If you’re thinking of set-
ting up one of the business formats described 
in this chapter, you might be interested in put-
ting things together online. Real lawyers are 
there to help you at www.legalzoom.com. 
They handle legal document preparation for 
business incorporation, partnerships, and more 
for low prices. This online venture was devel-
oped by a group of experienced attorneys, co-
founded by Robert Shapiro (yes, that Robert 
Shapiro — of O.J. fame).
They feature an amazing online law library that 
can answer many of your questions and help 
you make informed decisions. Documents are 
prepared according to how you answer online 
questionnaires. LegalZoom checks your work, 
and e-mails your documents or mails them 
printed on quality acid-free paper for your sig-
nature.
LegalZoom handled the trademark for my name, 
and I couldn’t believe how easy the process 
was. They had step-by-step instructions and 
FAQs to handle my silliest of questions. I got 
my paperwork quickly and the entire process 
was not only inexpensive but painless. You 
may want to also at least do a phone consul-
tation with an attorney in your area, perhaps 
one who is a member of the local Chamber of 
Commerce.

for the reimbursement of legitimate expenses — then you may not be cut out 
to face the responsibility of running your own corporation.
The state in which you run your business sets up the rules for the corporations 
operating within its borders. You must apply to the Secretary of State of the 
state in which you want to incorporate. Federal taxes for corporations presently 
range from 15 to 35 percent (see Table 1-2), and they’re generally based on your 
net profits.

Employee owners of corporations can use the company to shelter income 
from being taxed by dividing the income between their personal and corpo-
rate tax returns. This is frequently called income splitting; it involves setting 
salaries and bonuses so that any profits left in the company at the end of its 
tax year will be taxed at only the 15-percent rate.
It’s kind of fun to compare what you pay and how much you’d pay in taxes if 
you left profits in a small corporation, so check out Table 1-2 for the rates.
 
Considering that the individual Federal tax-rate percentages for incomes up 
to $75,000 annually go as high as 30.5 percent, the trouble of keeping a cor-
poration for your business may be a huge money-saver.
Most states also have their own taxes for corporations. In Table 1-3, you see 
the basic tax for C Corporations (assuming your corporation makes money 
after payroll and other expenses). Please check with your tax professional 
as many states have Franchise Taxes, Inventory taxes (and goodness knows 
what else) as well.

Often, in small corporations, most of the profits are paid out in tax-
deductible salaries and benefits. The most important benefit for a business 
is that any liabilities belong to the corporation. Your personal assets remain 
your own, because they have no part in the corporation.

ookkeeping, bah! You’ll get no argument from me that bookkeeping 
can be the most boring and time-consuming part of your job. You may 
feel that you just need to add your product costs, add your gross sales, and 
bada-bing, you know where your business is. Sorry, not true. Did you add 
that roll of tape you picked up at the supermarket today? Although it cost 
only $1.29, it’s a business expense. How about the mileage driving back and 
forth from garage sales and flea markets? Those are expenses, too. I suspect 
that you’re not counting quite a few other “small” items just like these in 
your expense column.
I must confess that I enjoy posting my expenses and sales after I actually 
get into the task. It gives me the opportunity to know exactly where my 
business is at any given moment. Of course, I’m not using a pencil-entered 
ledger system; I use a software program that’s easy and fun. In this chapter, 
I give you the lowdown on the basics of bookkeeping and emphasize the 
importance of keeping records in case Uncle Sam comes calling. Keep 
reading: This chapter is required.
Dealing with a Professional
Have you ever wondered why big businesses have CFOs (chief financial 
officers), vice presidents of finance, CPAs (certified public accountants), 
and bookkeepers? It’s because keeping the books is the backbone of a 
company’s business.
Do you have a professional going over your books at least once a year? You 
should. A paid professional experienced in business knows what to do when 
it comes to your taxes. Due to the complexity of the tax code, not just any 
paid preparer will suffice when it comes to preparing your business taxes. 
Here’s a list of possible people who can prepare your tax returns.

Dealing with a Professional
750
 
✦ Tax preparer (or consultant): This is the person you visit at the local 
we-file-for-you tax office. Did you know that a tax preparer could be 
anybody? There is no licensing involved. H&R Block hires as many as 
100,000 seasonal workers as tax preparers each year. Where do these 
people come from? I’m sure that some are experts on the tax code, but 
the sheer number of tax preparers and the lack of regulation can make 
using a we-file-for-you tax office a risky proposition for businesspeople 
who want to minimize their tax liability.
 
 A United States General Accounting Office report estimated that, in 
1998, American citizens overpaid their taxes by $945 million because 
they claimed the standard deduction when it would have been more 
beneficial to itemize. Half of those taxpayers used a paid preparer 
who clearly was not cognizant of the full tax law as it applied to these 
individuals. Scary, huh?
 
✦ Volunteer IRS-certified preparers: The AARP (American Association of 
Retired Persons) does an outstanding job of assembling nearly 32,000 
tax preparers to serve the needs of low-to-middle-income taxpayers 
(special attention going to seniors). Their goal is to maximize legal 
deductions and credits, resulting in “tangible economic benefits” for 
their clients. These volunteers have to study, take a test, and become 
certified by the IRS before they can lend their services to the cause.
 
 In recent years, AARP volunteers served a total of 1.85 million seniors in 
the United States. My mother was a retired corporate comptroller, and 
she volunteered in this program for many years. (She was disappointed 
when she made her lowest score on the IRS test — a 94%!) They staff 
more than 8500 sites around the United States. To find the one near you, 
call 1-888-AARP-NOW (1-888-227-7669) and select Tax-Aide Information 
or go to www.aarp.org/money/taxaide.
 
✦ Public accountant: A public accountant, or PA, must fulfill educational, 
testing, and experience requirements and obtain a state license. PAs 
must take an annual course to maintain their status.
 
✦ Enrolled agent: Often called one of the best-kept secrets in accounting, 
an enrolled agent is federally licensed by the IRS. (CPAs and attorneys 
are licensed by the state.) EAs must pass an extensive annual test on 
tax law and tax-return preparation every year to maintain their status. 
(They also have to pass annual background checks.) Enrolled agents are 
authorized to appear in place of a taxpayer before the IRS.
 
 Many EAs are former IRS employees. To find an enrolled agent near you, 
go to the www.naea.org Web site and enter the Taxpayer’s area.
 
✦ Certified public accountant: Certified public accountants (CPAs) must 
complete rigorous testing and fulfill experience requirements as pre-
scribed by the state in which they practice. Most states require a CPA to 
obtain a state license.

 CPAs are accountants. They specialize in recordkeeping and reporting 
financial matters. Their important position is as an advisor regarding 
financial decisions for both individuals and businesses. CPAs must take 
an annual course to maintain their status.
Keeping the Books: Basics to Get You Started
Although posting bookkeeping entries can be boring, clicking a button to 
generate your tax information is a lot easier than manually going over pages 
of sales information on a pad of paper. That’s why I like to use a software 
program, particularly QuickBooks (more about that program later).
I suppose that you could use plain ol’ paper and a pencil to keep your books; 
if that works for you, great. But even though that might work for you now, it 
definitely won’t in the future. Entering all your information into a software 
program now — while your books may still be fairly simple to handle — can 
save you a lot of time and frustration in the future, when your eBay business 
has grown beyond your wildest dreams and no amount of paper can keep it 
all straight and organized. I discuss alternative methods of bookkeeping in 
Chapter 3 in this minibook. For now, I focus on the basics of bookkeeping.
Tracking everything in and out
To effectively manage your business, you must keep track of all your 
expenses — down to the last roll of tape. You need to keep track of your 
inventory, how much you paid for the items, how much you paid in shipping, 
and how much you profited from your sales. If you use a van or the family 
car to pick up or deliver merchandise to the post office (I can load eight of 
the light kits that I sell on eBay in our car), you should keep track of this 
mileage as well. When you’re running a business, you should account for 
every penny that goes in and out.
Bookkeeping has irrefutable standards called GAAP (Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles) that are set by the Financial Accounting Standards 
Advisory Board. (It sounds scary to me too.) Assets, liabilities, owner’s equity, 
income, and expenses are standard terms used in all forms of accounting to 
define profit, loss, and the fiscal health of your business.
Accounting for everything — twice
Every time you process a transaction, two things happen: One account is 
credited while another receives a debit (kind of like yin and yang). To get 
more familiar with these terms (and those in the following list), see the 
definitions in the chart of accounts in Chapter 3 in this minibook. Depending 
on the type of account, the account’s balance either increases or decreases. 
One account that increases while another decreases is called double-entry 
accounting:

752
 
✦ When you post an expense, the debit increases your expenses and 
decreases your bank account.
 
✦ When you purchase furniture or other assets, it increases your asset 
account and decreases your bank account.
 
✦ When you make a sale and make the deposit, it increases your bank 
account and decreases your accounts receivable.
 
✦ When you purchase inventory, it increases your inventory and decreases 
your bank account.
 
✦ When a portion of a sale includes sales tax, it decreases your sales and 
increases your sales tax account.
Manually performing double-entry accounting can be a bit taxing (no pun 
intended). A software program, however, will automatically adjust the 
accounts when you input a transaction.
Separating business and personal records
As a business owner, even if you’re a sole proprietor (see Chapter 1 in this 
minibook for information on business types), you should keep your business 
books separate from your personal expenses. (I recommend using a program 
such as Quicken to keep track of your personal expenses for tax time.) 
By isolating your business records from your personal records, you can 
get a snapshot of which areas of your sales are doing well and which ones 
aren’t carrying their weight. But that isn’t the only reason keeping accurate 
records is smart; there’s the IRS to think about, too. In the next section, I 
explain Uncle Sam’s interest in your books.
 
Okay, posting bookkeeping can be boring. But at the end of the fiscal year, 
when you have a professional do your taxes, you’ll be a lot happier — and 
your tax preparation will cost you less — if you’ve posted your information 
cleanly and in the proper order. That’s why using a program such as 
QuickBooks (see Chapter 3 in this minibook) is essential to running your 
business.

One of the reasons we can have a great business environment in the United 
States is because we all have a partner, Uncle Sam. Our government regu-
lates business and sets the rules for us to transact our operations. To help 
you get started with your business, the IRS maintains a small-business Web 
site (shown in Figure 2-1) at the following address:
www.irs.gov/businesses/small
In this section, I highlight what information you need to keep and how long 
you should keep it (just in case you’re chosen for an audit).

Supporting information
Aside from needing to know how your business is going (which is really 
important), the main reason to keep clear and concise records is because 
Uncle Sam may come knocking one day. You never know when the IRS will 
choose your number and want to examine your records. In the following list, 
I highlight some of the important pieces of supporting information (things 
that support your expenses on your end-of-year tax return):
 
✦ Receipts: Dear reader, heed this advice: Save every receipt you get. If 
you’re out of town on a buying trip and have coffee at the airport, save 
that receipt — it’s a deduction from your profits. Everything related to 
your business may be deductible, so you must save airport parking 
receipts, taxi receipts, receipts for a pen that you picked up on your way 
to a meeting, everything. If you don’t have a receipt, you can’t prove the 
write-off.
 
✦ Merchandise invoices: Saving all merchandise invoices is as important 
as saving all your receipts. If you want to prove that you paid $400 and 
not the $299 retail price for that PlayStation 2 that you sold on eBay for 
$500, you’d better have an invoice of some kind. The same idea applies 
to most collectibles, in which case a retail price can’t be fixed. Save all 
invoices!

Records Uncle Sam May Want to See
754
 
✦ Outside contractor invoices: If you use outside contractors — even if 
you pay the college kid next door to go to the post office and the bank 
for you — you should get an invoice from them to document exactly 
what service you paid for and how much you paid. This is supporting 
information that will save your bacon, should it ever need saving.
 
✦ Business cards: It may sound like I’m stretching things a bit, but if you 
use your car to look at some merchandise, pick up a business card from 
the vendor. If you’re out of town and have a meeting with someone, 
take a card. Having these business cards can help substantiate your 
deductible comings and goings.
 
✦ A daily calendar: This is where your Palm or other handheld digital 
organizer comes in. Every time you leave your house or office on a 
business-related task, make note of it in your Palm. Keep as detailed a 
hoard of minutiae as you can stand. You can use your computer or Palm 
desktop to print a monthly calendar. At the end of the year, staple the 
pages together and include them in your files with your substantiating 
information.
 
✦ Credit-card statements: You’re already collecting credit-card receipts 
(although mine always seem to slip through the holes in my purse). If 
you have your statements, you have a monthly proof of expenses. When 
you get your statement each month, post it into your bookkeeping pro-
gram and itemize each and every charge, detailing where you spent the 
money and what for. (QuickBooks has a split feature that accommodates 
all your categories.) File these statements with your tax return at the 
end of the year in your year-end envelope (shoebox?).
I know that all this stuff will pile up, but that’s when you go to the store and 
buy some plastic file-storage containers to organize it all. To check for new 
information and the lowdown on what you can and can’t do, ask an accoun-
tant or a CPA. Also visit the IRS Tax Information for Businesses site, shown 
in Figure 2-2, at
www.irs.ustreas.gov/businesses
How long should you keep your records?
How long do you have to keep all this supporting information? I hate to tell 
you, but I think I’ve saved it all. I must have at least ten years of paperwork 
in big plastic boxes and old files in the garage. But you know, I’m not too 
extreme; the period in which you can amend a return or in which the IRS can 
assess more tax is never less than three years from the date of filing — and 
can be even longer.

The IRS wants you to save anything related to your tax return for three 
years. But if you take a look at Table 2-1, the IRS may want backup documen-
tation for up to six years. So for safety’s sake, keep things for six years, if 
only to prove you’re innocent. (As an aside, because I’m paranoid, I still keep 
everything for the maximum mentioned by the IRS: seven years.)

Even though I got the information in Table 2-1 directly from the IRS Web site 
and literature (Publication 583, “Starting a Business and Keeping Records”), 
it may change in the future. You can download a PDF copy of the booklet by 
going to the following address:
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p583.pdf
If Adobe Acrobat Reader isn’t installed on your computer, you can download 
the software (it’s free) from the IRS Web site. It doesn’t hurt to store your 
information for as long as you can stand it and stay on top of any changes 
the IRS may implement.
Getting the Most from Your Reports
After you’re up and running with your eBay business, you can look forward 
to having lots of reports to evaluate. Of course, you get a plethora of reports 
from PayPal, eBay, and so on, but the most important reports are those you 
generate from your bookkeeping program (software such as QuickBooks). I 
use the QuickBooks software package to manage my business records, and it 
keeps several common reports (Balance Sheet, Accounts Payable, P&L, and 
so on) in an easily accessible area. If you check out the Reports tab in your 
bookkeeping program, I’ll bet you find similar items. Before your eyes glaze 
over, though, check out this section for straightforward descriptions of 
these reports and the information they provide.
Similar sales and financial reports are common to all businesses, and review-
ing them on a monthly basis can help you stay on top of yours.
 
To get your business reports when you need them, you must post your sales 
receipts regularly — and thereby update the “money in” and “inventory out” 
figures. Post your payments at least weekly (especially on your company 
credit card — post those transactions the minute you make purchases) — 
and reconcile your checkbook the moment your bank statement arrives.
What does posting and reconciling tasks get you? The opportunity to press 
a button and get a complete picture of your business. From the reports you 
generate, you find out whether your business is profitable, what products 
are selling, and if you’re spending too much money in a particular area. 
Keeping your books up to date allows you to find problems before they 
become unmanageable.
 
If you run your sales and financial reports only quarterly rather than 
monthly, a problem — such as not pricing your items high enough — could 
be mushrooming out of control before you can detect and correct it.

Understanding the balance sheet
Your balance sheet provides the best information on your business. It pulls 
data from all the other reports and gives you a complete look at the financial 
condition of your business.
Your balance sheet shows all your assets:
 
✦ Cash in bank: The money in your business bank account.
 
✦ Accounts receivable: If you’ve invoiced anyone and not received 
payment as yet, that amount is reflected here.
 
✦ Inventory assets: This is the value of the merchandise you’ve purchased 
for resale but have not sold yet.
 
✦ Other assets: Things your business (not you) owns, such as furniture 
and vehicles. These are not considered in the current asset figure.
 
✦ Accumulated depreciation: This is deprecation on your assets, 
either produced by your accounting program or given to you by your 
accountant.
Your balance sheet also shows your liabilities:
 
✦ Accounts payable: Money you owe vendors and money due on unpaid 
credit cards show up here.
 
✦ Sales tax: The money you’ve collected on sales tax (that is due to your 
state) is a liability.
 
✦ Payroll liabilities: If you haven’t made a bank deposit covering the 
money you’ve withdrawn from employees (withholding taxes, Social 
Security, Medicare, and so on), it shows up here.
Your equity shows up in the (literal and figurative) bottom line. It will 
include the initial investment in your business and the net income total from 
your profit-and-loss statement.
 
An important business ratio — the net working capital ratio — is drawn from 
your balance sheet. Subtracting your current liabilities from your current 
assets gets you the dollar amount of your net working capital. But to get the 
net working capital ratio, divide your current assets by your current liabili-
ties. Any value over 1.1 means you have a positive net working capital. If you 
need a loan from a bank, this is the first figure the loan office will look for.
Tracking your accounts payable
When bills come in, post them in your accounting program. This will 
generate the accounts payable report. Accounts payable is the area that 
shows how much you owe and when it’s due. This is crucial information 
for meeting your obligations on time.

Getting the Most from Your Reports
758
When you pay an outstanding bill, the bookkeeping program deducts the 
money from your checking account and marks the bill as paid. It will no 
longer appear on this report.
Knowing your sales tax liability
One of the vendors you’ll owe money to is your state. In California, it’s the 
State Board of Equalization. Every time you post an invoice or sales receipt 
that charges sales tax, that amount shows up in the sales-tax liability report. 
You run this report on a timeframe determined by the state; you may be 
required to report monthly, quarterly, or yearly. Also, how often you report 
may depend on your total in-state sales. Just make sure you match your 
reporting with your state’s requirements.
Analyzing your profit and loss statement
If your accountant asks for your income statement, he or she is asking for 
your profit-and-loss statement, or P&L. This report lays out clearly every 
penny you’ve spent and brought in. You can set these reports to generate by 
any period of time; usually eBay sellers produce them by calendar month.
A summary P&L itemizes all your income and expense accounts individually 
and totals them by category. This way, you’ll be able to isolate individual 
areas where you may notice a problem, such as spending too much in 
shipping supplies.
Please use the following list of income and expense accounts as a guide, and 
not as gospel. I am not a tax professional, and I suggest that when you set 
up your own income and (especially) expense accounts, you go over them 
with a licensed tax expert. Here’s a glimpse at the kinds of accounts and 
categories you see on a P&L statement:
 
✦ Income: Every dollar you bring in is itemized as income. For many 
sellers, this can break down into several individual accounts. These 
figures are automatically generated by your bookkeeping program from 
the sales receipts you input. The total of all these income areas is 
subtotaled at the bottom of this area as total income.
 
• Sales: This totals eBay sales and shipping income in separate totals. 
These figures subtotal as total sales.
 
• Web site advertising: If you’re a member of any affiliate programs or 
have a newsletter that takes advertising, this income posts here.
 
• Consulting: Income from consulting or teaching others.

Book IX
Chapter 2
The Joys of Taxes 
and Business 
Reporting
Getting the Most from Your Reports
759
 
✦ Cost of goods sold (COGS): This area itemizes by category all the costs 
involved in your eBay (and Web site) sales only. None of your business 
operating expenses, such as your telephone bill, show up here; they’re 
farther down on the report. Your eBay COGS may subtotal in different 
accounts, such as
 
• Merchandise: The cost of merchandise that you bought to resell.
 
• eBay fees: Here’s where you post your eBay fees from your credit-
card statement.
 
• PayPal fees: This figure is automatically generated from your sales 
receipts.
 
• Shipping postage: The totals of the amounts you spend for shipping 
your eBay items.
 
• Shipping supplies: The costs of padded mailers, bubble wrap, tape, 
and boxes. When those items are paid for, the bookkeeping program 
inserts the totals here.
 
• Outside service fees: If you pay for photo hosting or third-party 
management tools, they appear here.
 
 Cross-reference your cost of goods sold to your sales reports. You’ve 
expensed inventory bought, but your merchandise may be sitting 
idle in your storage area. The COGS report works with other reports, 
such as inventory reports (also generated by QuickBooks), sales 
reports, and P&Ls, to give you a solid picture of where your business 
is going.
 
 Your cost of goods sold is subtotaled under the heading total COGS.
 
✦ Gross profit: Your bookkeeping program magically does all the 
calculations — and you’ll be able to see in a snapshot whether your 
eBay business is in good, profitable health. This particular figure 
is the gross profit before you figure in your company expenses (often 
called G&A, for general and administrative costs).
Now come your expenses. Listed in individual accounts, you have subtotals 
for your various business operating expenses, as follows:
 
✦ Payroll expenses: The total amounts you pay your employees.
 
✦ Taxes: Broken out by state and federal, the taxes you’ve paid to the 
regulating agencies for running your business.
 
✦ Supplies: Computer and office supplies. How much paper goes through 
your printer? Not to mention those inkjet cartridges, pens, computers, 
telephones, copiers, and network equipment. All those expenses 
appear here.

Keeping Your Records and Data Safe
760
 
✦ Seminars and education: Did you buy this book to educate yourself on 
your eBay business? It counts. Have you attended a seminar to educate 
yourself on eBay? Going to eBay Live? Those count too.
 
✦ Contract labor: This is the money you pay to anyone who is not an 
employee of your company, such as an off-site bookkeeper or a com-
pany that comes in to clean your office. The federal government has 
stringent rules as to who classifies as an independent contractor. Check 
this Web site for the official rules:
www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=115041,
00.html
 
✦ Automobile expenses: This is where you post expenses, such as park-
ing, gas, and repairs for an automobile used for your eBay business. If 
you have only one vehicle that you also use for personal transportation, 
your tax person may have you post a percentage of its use in this area.
 
✦ Telephone: Do you have a separate phone line for your business?
 
✦ Advertising: Expenses you incur when running advertising campaigns, 
such as in Google AdWords or in your eBay banner program.
Your expenses will come to a whopping total at the bottom. Then, at the 
very bottom of the page, will be your net income. This is your bottom-line 
profit. I wish you all a very positive bottom line!
Keeping Your Records and Data Safe
If the hazard of not backing up your computer isn’t a tired subject, I don’t 
know what is. Whenever you hear someone talking about their latest com-
puter crash, all the person can do is stare blankly into the distance and say, 
“I lost everything!” I admit it’s happened to me — and I’m sure that you’ve 
heard this cry from others (if you’ve not uttered it yourself): “If only I’d 
backed up my files!”
What about a natural disaster? It can happen, you know. When I went to 
sleep on January 16, 1994, I didn’t know that the next day, when I attempted 
to enter my office, everything would be in shambles. My monitors had 
flown across the room, filing cabinets turned over, and oh, did I mention 
the ceiling had collapsed? The Northridge earthquake taught me some solid 
lessons about keeping duplicate records and backed-up data copies in an 
offsite location.
If a computer crash or natural disaster has happened to you, you have my 
deepest and most sincere sympathy. It’s a horrible thing to go through.

Book IX
Chapter 2
The Joys of Taxes 
and Business

Backing Up Your Data
761
 
What’s another horrible thing? A tax audit: It can make you feel like jumping 
off a cliff if you’ve been filing your hard documentation with the shoebox 
method. (You know, one box for 2005, one for 2004, and so on.) Filing your 
receipts and backup documentation in an organized easy-to-find format can 
pay off in future savings of time (and nerves).
I want to tell you up front that I don’t always practice what I preach. I don’t 
always back up my stuff on time. I have a new box of backup software 
sitting on the floor next to me, and the box of receipts is getting fuller. But 
I’m gonna preach anyway about good practices for backing up your com-
puter data and safeguarding the hardcopy documents that you inevitably 
will have. (I just really hope there are no disasters before I finish writing 
this book!)
 
Taking the time to organize and safeguard your data and records now may 
save you days, weeks, or months of work and frustration later.
Backing Up Your Data
I’m not specifically suggesting that you go out and buy backup software 
(though I think it’s a good idea). I am suggesting that you back up the eBay 
transaction records and other data on your computer somehow. Consider 
the following points when choosing how to back up the data you can’t afford 
to lose:
 
✦ Regularly back up at least your My Documents folder onto a CD or exter-
nal hard drive. (You can find external 250GB hard drives for under $100 
on eBay, so there’s really no excuse not to make some sort of backup.)
 
✦ Backup software can make your backup chores less chorelike. Most 
packages enable you to run backups unattended and automatically, so 
you don’t have to remember anything. (Western Digital external hard 
drives come with their own sync software to handle this for you.)
 
✦ Backup software doesn’t have to be expensive. I just visited one of my 
favorite shareware sites, www.tucows.com, and searched the term 
backup Windows. This query returned more than 300 matching records!
 
 There’s no need for me to recommend a particular brand of backup 
software; almost any brand you buy will do a good job. When you search 
tucows or Amazon, read the customer comments and let these help 
direct you to the software that’s right for you.
 
✦ Consider making monthly backups of the info from your PayPal account. 
You can download the data directly from the site and can archive 
several years’ worth on one CD.

Saving Your Backup Paperwork
762
Saving Your Backup Paperwork
Business records are still mostly paper, and until such time as the entire 
world is electronic, you’ll have some paperwork to store. You can buy 
manila file folders almost anywhere. A box of 100 costs less than $10, so 
expense is no excuse for lack of organization. If you don’t have filing 
cabinets, office-supply stores sell collapsible cardboard boxes that are the 
perfect size to hold file folders. You can buy six of these for around $8.
And just what do you need to file in your new organized office? Here are a 
few important suggestions:
 
✦ Equipment receipts and warranties: You never know when some 
important piece of your office hardware will go on the fritz, and you’ll 
need the receipt and warranty information so you can get it fixed. 
Also, the receipts are backup documentation for your bookkeeping 
program’s data.
 
✦ Automobile expenses: Gasoline receipts, parking receipts, repairs — 
anything and everything to do with your car. You use your car in your 
eBay business (for example, to deliver packages to the post office for 
shipping), don’t you?
 
✦ Postal receipts: Little slips of paper that you get from the post office. If 
you use an online postage service, print a postage report once a month 
and file it in your filing cabinets or boxes as well.
 
✦ Credit-card bills: Here in one location can be documentation on your 
purchases for your business. Make a folder for each credit card; file 
every month after you pay the bill and post the data.
 
✦ Merchandise receipts: Merchandise purchased for resale on eBay. 
Documentation of all the money you spend.
 
✦ Licenses and legal stuff: Important! Keep an active file of anything legal; 
you will no doubt have to lay hands on this information at the oddest 
moment. It’s reassuring to know where it is!
 
✦ Payroll paperwork: Even if you print your checks and such on the 
computer, you should organize state and federal filing information in 
one place.
 
✦ Canceled checks and bank statements: The only ways to prove you’ve 
paid for something.
 
✦ Insurance information: Policies and insurance proposals should all be 
kept close by.
I’m sure you can think of some more things that can benefit from a little bit 
of organization. When you need the information quickly, and you can find it 
without breaking a sweat, you’ll be glad you kept things organized.

✓ Taking care of bookkeeping with QuickBooks
✓ Using QuickBooks efficiently
W
hen you meet with one of the professionals described in Chapter 2 
in this minibook, you’ll need to bring a complete and accurate set 
of books. To prepare accurate books, you can use a bookkeeper (who 
will use accounting software) or you can learn how to use professional 
accounting software yourself. Don’t be a wussy; you can do this. Lots of 
people successfully using bookkeeping software today knew nothing about 
bookkeeping before they set up their own accounts. I’m one of them.
 
When your business gets so busy that you have no time to post your book-
keeping, you can always hire a part-time bookkeeper to come in and do 
your posting for you. I found mine on elance.com. We fax and e-mail data 
every month.
I researched various Web sites to find which software was the best selling 
and easiest to use. I had many discussions with CPAs, enrolled agents, 
and bookkeepers. The software that these professionals most recommend 
for business is Intuit’s QuickBooks. (Thank goodness that’s the one I use.) 
QuickBooks is considered the best, which is why I devote so much of 
this chapter to it. Some people begin with Quicken and later move to 
QuickBooks when their businesses get big or incorporate. My theory? Start 
with the best. It’s not that much more expensive; on eBay, I’ve seen new, 
sealed QuickBooks Pro 2004 software for as low as $135 and QuickBooks for 
as low as $65.
QuickBooks: Making Bookkeeping Uncomplicated
QuickBooks offers several versions, from basic to enterprise (company-size) 
solutions tailored to different types of businesses. QuickBooks SimpleStart 
and QuickBooks Pro have a few significant differences. QuickBooks Pro adds 
job costing and expensing features and the capability to design your own 
forms. QuickBooks SimpleStart does a darn good job, too, so check out the 
comparison at quickbooks.intuit.com and see which version is best for

you. I use (and highly recommend) QuickBooks Pro, so that’s the version I 
describe in the rest of this section. If you’re just purchasing QuickBooks 
Pro, you may have an updated version that works a bit differently. But the 
accounting basics that the software provides for your business don’t change.
 
Stephen L. Nelson wrote QuickBooks 2009 For Dummies (published by 
Wiley). His book is amazingly easy to understand. I swear that neither Steve 
nor my publisher gave me a nickel for recommending his book. (Heck, I even 
had to pay for my copy.) I recommend it simply because it answers — in 
plain English — just about any question you’ll have about using the program 
for your bookkeeping needs. Spend the money and get the book. Any money 
spent on increasing your knowledge is money well spent (and may be a tax 
write-off). And (oh yeah) be sure you file the receipt.
I update my QuickBooks software every few years, and the product improve-
ments continue to save me time in performing my bookkeeping tasks. If you 
find that you don’t have time to input your bookkeeping data, you may have 
to hire a bookkeeper. The bonus is that professional bookkeepers probably 
already know QuickBooks, and the best part is that they can print daily 
reports for you that keep you apprised of the condition your business is in. 
Also, at the end of each year, QuickBooks will supply you with all the official 
reports your enrolled agent (EA) or certified public accountant (CPA) will 
need to do your taxes. (Yes, you really do need an EA or a CPA.) You can 
even send them a backup on a Zip disk or a CD-ROM. See how simple book-
keeping can be?
QuickBooks Pro
When you first fire up QuickBooks Pro, you must answer a few questions 
to set up your account. Among the few things you need to have ready — 
before you even begin to mess with the software — are the following starting 
figures:
 
✦ Cash balance: This may be the amount in your checking account (no 
personal money, please!) or the amount of money deposited from your 
eBay profits. Put these profits into a separate checking account to use 
for your business.
 
✦ Accounts receivable balance: Does anyone owe you money for some 
auctions? Outstanding payments make up this total.
 
✦ Account liability balance: Do you owe some money? Are you being 
invoiced for some merchandise that you haven’t paid for? Total it and 
enter it when QuickBooks prompts you.

If you’re starting your business in the middle of the year, gather any previ-
ous profits and expenses that you want to include because you’ll have to 
input this information for a complete annual set of diligently recorded 
books. I can guarantee that this is going to take a while. But you’ll be 
thanking me for insisting that you get organized. It just makes everything 
work smoother in the long run.
QuickBooks EasyStep Interview
After you’ve organized your finances, you can proceed with the QuickBooks 
EasyStep Interview, which is shown in Figure 3-1. The EasyStep Interview is 
designed to provide a comfort level for those with accounting-phobia and 
those using a bookkeeping program for the first time. If you mess things up, 
you can always use the Back arrow and change what you’ve input. If you 
need help, simply click the Help button and the program will answer many of 
your questions. Hey, if worst comes to worst, you can always delete the file 
from the QuickBooks directory and start over.

For the whirlwind tour through the QuickBooks EasyStep Interview, just 
follow these steps (which are only a general guideline):
 
1. Start QuickBooks, and choose the Create a New Company option.
 
 You’re now at the EasyStep Interview.
 
2. On the first page of the interactive portion of the interview, type your 
company name (this becomes the filename in your computer) and the 
legal name of your company.
 
 If you’ve filed a fictitious name statement (see Chapter 1 in this mini-
book), the fictitious name is the legal name of your company.
 
3. Continue to follow the steps, answering other questions about your 
business, such as the address and the type of tax form you use.
 
4. When QuickBooks asks what type of business you want to use, choose 
Retail: General.
 
 If you have a business other than your eBay sales — perhaps consulting 
or teaching others — you may want to just leave the company box blank 
in QuickBooks, specify no business option, and build your own chart 
of accounts from the one they give you — that’s what I did.
 
 QuickBooks doesn’t offer an online sales business choice, so 
Retail:General is the closest to what you need (see Figure 3-2). With 
the chart of accounts that I feature in the following section, you can 
make the appropriate changes to your accounts to adapt to your eBay 
business.
 
5. When QuickBooks asks whether you want to use its chosen chart of 
accounts, choose Yes.
 
 See Figure 3-3.You can always change the accounts later. If you want to 
spend the time, you can input your entire custom chart of accounts 
manually (but I really, really don’t recommend it).
QuickBooks integrates with PayPal
PayPal can provide your payment history in 
QuickBooks format. They even offer a settle-
ment and reconciliation system download that 
breaks up your PayPal transactions into debits 
and credits. A handy feature! One warning, 
though: These are only financial transactions. 
When you use QuickBooks to its fullest, you 
will have your inventory in the program. When 
you purchase merchandise to sell, QuickBooks 
sets up the inventory — and deducts from it 
each time you input an invoice or sales receipt. 
This way your inventory receipts follow GAAP 
(more about GAAP in Book I). Later in the chap-
ter, I show you the procedures for posting your 
weekly (or daily) sales in QuickBooks by using 
sales receipts.

6. Answer some more general questions, which I’m sure you can handle 
with the aid of the intuitive QuickBooks help feature.
 
7. When the preferences pages appear, I recommend that you select the 
“Enter the bills first and then enter the payments later” option.
 
 That way, if you input your bills as they come in, you can get an exact 
idea of how much money you owe at any time by just starting the 
program.
 
8. Click the box to indicate that you collect sales tax.
 
9. On the Sales Tax preferences page, indicate the agencies for which 
you collect sales tax, and then set up the tax-collecting information, 
as shown in Figure 3-4.

Figure 3-4:

your

information.
 
 
10. Decide whether you want to use QuickBooks to process your payroll.
 
 Even if you’re the only employee, using QuickBooks payroll information 
makes things much easier when it comes to filling out your payroll 
deposits. QuickBooks automatically fills in federal forms for your 
quarterly tax processing and prints the appropriate form — ready for 
your signature and mailing.
 
11. Answer a few more questions, including whether you want to use the 
cash basis or accrual basis of accounting.
 
 The accrual basis posts sales the minute you write an invoice or post a 
sales receipt, and posts your expenses as soon as you post the bills into 
the computer. Accrual basis accounting gives you a clearer picture of 
where your company is financially than cash basis accounting does. The 
cash basis is when you record bills by writing checks — expenses are 
posted only when you write the checks. This way of doing business may 
be simpler, but the only way you’ll know how much money you owe is 
by looking at the pile of bills on your desk.
 
12. If you’re comfortable, just click Leave and then input the balance of 
your required information directly into the program without using the 
interview.
 
If you’re new to bookkeeping, you may want to go through the interview 
step-by-step with a tutor at your side. For more details, remember to 
check out QuickBooks 2009 For Dummies — this book can teach you almost 
everything you need to know about QuickBooks.
Setting Up a QuickBooks Chart of Accounts
After you’ve finished the EasyStep Interview and have successfully set up 
your business in QuickBooks, the program presents a chart of accounts — 
essentially an organization system, rather like file folders, that keeps all

Using Bookkeeping 
Software

related data in the proper area. When you write a check to pay a bill, it 
deducts the amount from your checking account, reduces your accounts 
payable, and increases your asset or expense account if that’s appropriate.
You have a choice of giving each account a number. These numbers, a kind 
of bookkeeping shorthand, are standardized throughout bookkeeping. 
Believe it or not, everybody in the industry seems to know what number 
goes with what item. To keep things less confusing, I like to use titles as well 
as numbers.
To customize your chart of accounts, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
 
2. Click the Accounting icon (on the left).
 
3. Click the Company preferences tab and indicate that you’d like to use 
account numbers.
 
 An editable chart of accounts appears, as shown in Figure 3-5. Because 
QuickBooks doesn’t assign account numbers by default, you’ll need to 
edit the chart to create them.

4. Go through your QuickBooks chart of accounts and add any missing 
categories.
 
 You may not need all these categories and you can always add more 
later. In Table 3-1, I show you a chart of accounts that a CPA wrote for an 
eBay business. To get an idea of how you can customize the chart of 
accounts, also look at Figure 3-6, which shows you the chart of accounts

Opting for QuickBooks on the Web
If you want to handle everything on the Web, use QuickBooks online service 
(they have a Basic and a Plus product), shown in Figure 3-7. The online 
QuickBooks program offers fewer features than the home version, but if your 
accounting needs are simple, it may be a solution for you. Before you decide, 
however, consider that while your accounting needs may be simple now, 
they may not be so simple later.
Intuit’s charges start at $9.95 a month for the service, which is comparable 
to buying the QuickBooks Pro version. The online version also requires you 
to have a broadband connection to the Internet so that you’re always online 
(dial-up connections need not apply). The online edition doesn’t include 
integrated payroll, purchase orders, online banking, and bill payments.
 
Figure 3-7: 
QuickBooks 
for the Web.
 
Having QuickBooks Report on Your eBay Business
QuickBooks can give you up-to-the-minute reports about the status of your 
eBay business and keep track of everything — including payroll and sales-
tax liability — in the background. Here are a few things that I like about 
using QuickBooks to streamline an online business:
 
✦ Inventory reports: As you purchase inventory, aside from deducting the 
money from your checking account and expensing your merchandise 
account, QuickBooks adds the purchased merchandise to your inven-
tory. Every time you sell an item, QuickBooks deducts the item from 
your inventory. QuickBooks has many other reporting features for your 
inventory and end-of-year reporting for taxes.

Having QuickBooks Report on Your eBay Business
776
 
 Figure 3-8 shows you a part of an inventory report that I pulled out of 
the program. You can see how valuable the data is. With a click of my 
mouse, I can see how much I have left in stock and the average number 
of items I’ve sold per week.
 
Figure 3-8: 
A portion 
of my 
inventory-
tracking 
report.
 
 
✦ Sales-tax tracking: Depending on how the program is set up (based on 
your own state sales tax laws), you can request a report that has all your 
taxable and nontaxable sales. The report calculates the amount of sales 
tax you owe. You can print this report for backup information of your 
sales-tax payments to the state.
 
✦ Payroll: Whether you use the online payroll service to prepare your 
payroll or input the deductions yourself, QuickBooks posts the appro-
priate withholdings to their own accounts. When it comes time to 
pay your employees’ withholding taxes, QuickBooks can generate the 
federal reporting form (all filled in) for submitting with your payment.
 
✦ Sales reports: QuickBooks gives you a plethora of reports with which 
you can analyze your sales professionally. One of my favorite reports 
is the Sales by Item Summary. This report gives you the following 
information for every inventoried item you sell, in whatever time period 
you choose:
 
• Quantity sold
 
• Total dollar amount sold
 
• Percentage of sales represented by each item
 
• The average price the item sold for
 
• COGS (cost of goods sold) by item

Book IX
Chapter 3
Using Bookkeeping 
Software
Posting Sales in QuickBooks the Collier Way
777
 
• Average cost of goods sold by total sales per item
 
• Gross profit margin in dollar amounts
 
• Gross profit margin expressed as percentage
 
Depending on how you post your transactions, you can analyze your eBay 
sales, Web-site sales, and brick-and-mortar sales (individually or together). 
You can also select any date range for your reports.
Posting Sales in QuickBooks the Collier Way
Some online auction-management services integrate with QuickBooks. This 
integration means that your individual transactions can be downloaded into 
the QuickBooks program, setting up a new customer for each of your sales.
Although this process is quick and easy, inputting each sale as a new 
customer will make your database huge in no time. QuickBooks is a large 
program to begin with, and if you’re going to use it (and update it) for 
several years, the database will become even larger.
If you’ve ever worked with large files, you know that the larger the data file, 
the more chance there is for the data to become corrupt. That’s the last thing 
you want. Besides, QuickBooks will max out with over 14,000 customers — 
and you can easily get that many in several years on eBay.
 
To keep track of your customers, you can use an additional copy of your 
PayPal monthly report and combine the download with cash sales into an 
Excel (or Microsoft Works) spreadsheet to build your customer database.
Posting sales to match deposits
In this section, I show you a procedure I developed to process my PayPal 
sales. I’ve run it past several accountants and QuickBooks experts, and it’s 
garnered rave reviews. I’m sharing it with you because I want you to be able 
to run your business smoothly. Lots of sellers use this method. It shortens 
your inputting time.
Rather than posting an invoice in my QuickBooks software for every cus-
tomer (for those few customers who need formal invoices), I can print them 
on demand from eBay’s Selling Manager or PayPal. I input my sales into a 
customer sales receipt as shown in Figure 3-9. Whenever I make a PayPal 
deposit into my business checking account — which is every few days, 
depending on how busy sales are — I post my sales into QuickBooks. This 
way, the total of my sales receipt equals the amount of my PayPal deposit. 
(If you’ve ever tried to reconcile your PayPal deposits with your sales and 
your checking account, you know how frustrating it can be.)

Posting Sales in QuickBooks the Collier Way
778
 
Figure 3-9: 
My 
customer 
sales 
receipt.
 
In my QuickBooks account, PayPal is the customer. It makes no difference 
who bought what; the only thing that matters is which item sold (to deduct 
from inventory) and for how much (to post to my financial data).
Customizing the sales data
The program gives you the flexibility to customize forms, and Figure 3-9 
shows my customized sales receipt for PayPal sales. PayPal is a taxable 
customer when sales are made in the State of California, and the appropriate 
sales tax is applied automatically. I added the following when I customized 
the form:
 
✦ PayPal fees: I set up PayPal fees as a credit against sales. (In Figure 3-9, 
you can see they are applied as a negative.) This helps to match the 
total amount of the sales receipt to my PayPal deposit. It also gives me a 
discount line in my sales reports that tracks my total paid in PayPal fees. 
The PayPal fees line appears also in the cost of goods sold area of my 
financial statements.
 
 In case you’re wondering about eBay fees, they have their own line in 
my chart of accounts. I charge eBay fees to my company credit card. 
When the credit card expenses are posted, I post the eBay expense to 
the eBay fees account, which appears under “cost of goods sold” in my 
financial reports. (Earlier in the chapter, I show you how to set up 
QuickBooks for eBay and include a suggested chart of expense and 
income accounts.)

Book IX
Chapter 3

✦ State: I type the two-letter state abbreviation of the shipping location 
with each item. This serves as backup information for my State Board 
of Equalization (the California sales tax board) and also allows me to 
run reports on what has sold in which states.
 
✦ Date: The date at the top of the sales receipt is the posting date. The 
date in the product posting indicates the date the PayPal payment 
was posted.
 
✦ Class: Every item posted in QuickBooks can be part of a class to make 
it easier for you to isolate certain types of transactions. I set up two 
classes of PayPal sales: California sales and out-of-state sales. California 
sales are classified as taxable, and out-of-state sales are classified as 
nontaxable. QuickBooks calculates the tax liability automatically.
 
✦ Tax classification: When I type the first two letters into the class area 
(OU for out-of-state sales and CA for in-state sales), the tax line changes 
automatically to Tax or Non-Tax. QuickBooks would do this whether I 
show this field in the sales receipt or not, but by having it appear, I can 
use it as a secondary reminder to post the taxable class properly.
By inputting my eBay sales data in this way, I streamline the process in 
several ways. I post data to only one program once. From this sales receipt I 
get updated inventory reports, accurate sales tax data, and accurate 
expense and income tracking. It also eases the process of reconciling my 
checking account.
Using eBay’s Accounting Assistant Software
I guess eBay figured out that sellers needed help with their accounting soft-
ware. The company developed Accounting Assistant (see Figure 3-10) for use 
with QuickBooks software, which is available to eBay sellers who subscribe 
to Seller’s Assistant or Selling Manager or who have an eBay store.
You can download the software from the following site:
http:// pages.ebay.com/accountingassistant/
As of this writing, Accounting Assistant is new to eBay and they haven’t 
worked out all the kinks. But keep an eye on the software because it shows 
great promise for streamlining the posting of your sales.
 
Accounting Assistant will work with only the premium versions of 
QuickBooks: QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, or QuickBooks 
Enterprise.

Chapter 4: Keeping Your 
Business Secure Online
In This Chapter
✓ Fighting spam
✓ Choosing a good secret question and password
✓ Reporting hacked accounts to eBay
O
nline security is something everybody worries about, but few people 
do anything about it. When people’s accounts are hacked into, they 
whine and moan about online security, but they don’t give a moment’s 
thought to why using a user ID as a password wasn’t the best choice.
Even if you avoid such classic blunders, you have to keep your wits about you 
online. Sad to say, some people out there are trying to dupe you; it’s time to 
take charge of our own security and fight back in the best ways we can. Some 
scams pretend to be from eBay, PayPal, Citibank, and others — and try to bilk 
you out of your personal information. I show you a fairly foolproof way to 
recognize those. I also show you how spammers get your e-mail address. 
Even if you never give it out, they have ways of getting it from you. I hope to 
teach you how to be a little more savvy about which e-mails you open and 
how to fight back.
Staying Away from Spam
Every morning when I get to my computer, I have to allow about five min-
utes to clear the spam out of my e-mail. It used to take up to a half hour, 
considering that I flip on my computer and am greeted by close to 200 
e-mails every day. Read on to see how I’ve cut my spam-scanning time!
Spam has become so sneaky. Everyone is scurrying to get the latest in 
antispam software, but I’ve found that antispam software was causing me to 
lose e-mail that I needed, because it seems that the word eBay is a favorite 
of spammers. I want news on eBay, but I don’t want to get those make-a-
fortune-on-eBay e-mails. Nor do I want to help out dear Mr. Felix Kamala, 
son of the late Mr. A.Y. Kamala. It seems his family lost millions in Zimbabwe 
to a scammer in the government, and he wants me to help him get his secret 
stash of “Fifteen million five hundred thousand united state dollars.” He was

going to give me 20% just for helping him — how thoughtful! (In case you 
didn’t know, this e-mail is part of what the FBI calls the Nigerian e-mail 
scam — also called the 419 scam — named after the African penal code vio-
lated with this crime.)
 
A fine member of the Internet community collects these e-mails and posts 
them on his Web site, www.potifos.com/fraud. Check out the page when 
you have a minute — it’s quite funny!
For the record, I’m also very comfortable with the size of my body parts; I 
don’t want to buy drugs from some stranger over the Internet; and I don’t 
need another mortgage from the Internet.
Keeping Your E-Mail Address Quiet
Have you ever signed up for anything on the Internet? Before you signed up, 
did you check to see whether the site had a posted privacy-policy page? You 
probably didn’t. After you type your name in a box on the Internet on a site 
with no-spam or privacy policy, you’re basically giving your privacy away, 
because you’re considered an opt-in customer. Opt in means that you asked 
to be on a list, and the site that now has your e-mail address can sell it to 
spammers.
Take a look at Figure 4-1. It’s a portion of an ad that should really scare you. 
It’s an eBay auction for a CD containing 140,000,000 opt-in e-mail addresses. 
Yes, you can buy access to all those potential suckers for only $29.99.
 
Figure 4-1: 
A tempting 
offer to 
violate 
people’s 
privacy.
 
Just opening your e-mail can give you away as well. Spammers will often 
make up return e-mail addresses to mask their true location (as you can tell 
by some of the “From” addresses). If you open and view their e-mail, the 
e-mail sends a notice to the spammer’s server, and then they know that the 
e-mail address is valid. This practice can also be masked in the HTML to 
occur when the e-mail consists of merely a picture — when it goes back to 
grab the picture for your e-mail, it reports that your e-mail address is good.

Recognizing Spam
Recognizing Spam
Much of the spam you get can be recognized by the subject line. I used to 
check my e-mail once I downloaded it to my computer. That’s a dangerous 
procedure, though, considering that some e-mails do their job even if you 
don’t respond. Now I’m using a program called MailWasher Pro. The com-
pany also makes a free version, described next.
Finding spam before it finds you
When I flip on my computer in the morning, I open MailWasher and see a 
barrage of trash in my mailbox, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
Figure 4-2: 
The free 
version of 
Mail
Washer.
 
MailWasher lists your e-mail directly from your ISP’s server. It does not 
download the e-mail to your computer. By using MailWasher, you can delete 
the offending e-mails from your mailbox, and then bring only the ones you 
want into your e-mail program.
As you can see from Figure 4-2, I can find out the following:
 
✦ Who sent the e-mail: I’m not really acquainted with Lavonne N. Bingham 
(note that her e-mail address ends in .be — that’s Belgium). I’m also 
not familiar with Viola Cantu, who strangely has jsavcxy as her e-mail 
ID at Yahoo. Not to mention my buddy, chun-she, otherwise known as 
carrie@t-online.de. (Hmmm, Germany? Don’t know anyone there 
either.)

784
Recognizing Spam
 
✦ E-mail subject: Just in case chun-she really does know me, he or she 
should know that I can’t read the Cyrillic subject line (see the high-
lighted row in Figure 4-2). I’m pretty sure I can delete that one. And 
although Velma sent me an e-mail letting me know how much I’d “enjoy” 
something, I’m really too busy to enjoy anything just now, so I guess I’ll 
delete that e-mail too.
 
✦ To: The To line can be a definite tip-off that an e-mail is spam. If someone 
has e-mailed to a name other than my own or to an e-mail box at my Web 
site (with news about mortgages), I can assume that the e-mail wasn’t sent 
by someone I know. For example, one e-mail was sent to Yvette. I have no 
Yvette at this e-mail address! There are no dummies here either.
 
✦ Attachments: If there’s an attachment from someone I don’t know, I delete 
the entire e-mail. As a matter of fact, I delete most e-mails with attach-
ments. If a friend wants to send me something, they can always resend it.
MailWasher allows you to put check marks next to suspect e-mails. You can 
merely delete them, or you can bounce them back to whence they came and 
blacklist them (so they’ll always be marked for deletion if they e-mail you 
again).
My e-mail program is set to get e-mail from the server only when I ask it to, 
so after I delete all the spam, I can click Send/Receive and feel considerably 
safer.
I use the Pro version of MailWasher (see my Web site for details), which can 
scan more than one e-mail account. However, I suggest that you download 
the free version for one e-mail account and see whether you like it before 
paying $39.95 for the Pro version. You can download the free version at 
www.mailwasher.net.
Checking out nefarious e-mail
What? It seems I’ve received an e-mail from PayPal. They say my account 
needs to be renewed. Oh my! I certainly don’t want to lose my PayPal 
account.
Or how about an e-mail from PayPal that says:
We recently reviewed your account and suspect that your PayPal account 
may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party. Protecting the 
security of your account and of the PayPal network is our primary concern. 
Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have temporarily limited access 
to sensitive PayPal account features.
Click below in order to regain access to your account:
Uh-huh. Right. As in, STOP RIGHT THERE!

Recognizing Spam
 
Take a good look at the e-mail. Who is it addressed to? When PayPal sends 
you an e-mail, the opening line says “Dear (your registered name).” In my 
case, a real e-mail from PayPal read, “Dear Marsha Collier.” These spam 
e-mails are usually addressed to “Dear Valued User” or “Dear youremail
address.com.” PayPal will never address an e-mail to your e-mail address!
Responding to these e-mails is tantamount to giving away your information 
to a stranger. Let me give you a tip on another way to double-check these 
e-mails. Open the e-mail, as I have in Figure 4-3. Note: This trick works only 
with HTML e-mail. (An e-mail is in the HTML format if you can right-click it 
and see a View Source option.)
 
Figure 4-3: 
Viewing the 
source on 
an e-mail.
 
Right-click your mouse and choose View Source. The Notepad program 
opens, and you see the e-mail in HTML text. Scroll to the bottom. In the 
example, I scrolled to the line that says Please follow the link below followed 
by a URL, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: 
The HTML 
coding for 
the link URL 
address.
 

786
Fighting Back!
Take a good long look at the figure. You’ll see the link to the URL in the 
e-mail. But look just before it in the source code and you can see that you’re 
really being redirected to http://66.223.44.203/cgi/index.htm — 
not to the PayPal secure URL!
Okay, I investigated so I could show you what’s going on (but don’t try this 
at home, friends; it’s risky). When I clicked the link, I came to a duplicate of 
the PayPal Log In page — or is it? A quick glance at the address bar of my 
browser confirmed I’d been misdirected, as shown in Figure 4-5. If I were 
really on PayPal, the URL address would have read like this:
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run.
Note that the real PayPal URL begins with https, not http. The s in https 
stands for secure.
 
Figure 4-5: 
My address 
bar with the 
misdirected 
URL.
 
 
Even checking the URL may be misleading if you’re using Internet Explorer 
as your browser. Bad-deed-doers can exploit a vulnerability in the browser 
to display a fake URL in the address and status bars. To avoid these 
Microsoft glitches, be sure to keep your Windows critical updates, er, up to 
date. Visit http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com regularly and install 
any critical security updates.
If you still question whether your PayPal or eBay account has a problem, 
close the e-mail and go directly to the site and log in at the real URL. If your 
account does have a problem, you’ll know right away.
Fighting Back!
There’s quite a bit that you can do to help stop spam. For openers, don’t 
believe that link at the bottom of some spam you’ve received that says 
“Click here to have your name removed from the list.” Have you ever clicked 
one of those? I have. Oops. I found out that those links are the gold standard 
for collecting valid e-mail addresses! If you respond to the spam in any way, 
shape, or form, they know they have a valid address — and watch the spam 
to your mailbox increase!

Book IX
Chapter 4
Keeping Your

787
Keeping Your Password (and Accounts) Secure
Never — I repeat, never — click one of those links again.
 
When signing up for some sort of newsletter with an organization you’re new 
to or unsure of, use an anonymous Yahoo! or HotMail address. It’s easy 
enough to sign up for one, and if spammers get hold of that address, they 
will not be privy to your private address.
Also, no matter how curious you are about enlarging certain parts of your 
anatomy, don’t even open the e-mails you receive on those topics. And cer-
tainly don’t respond.
Last, report spammers. Several legitimate sites take reports and forward 
them to the appropriate authorities. Don’t bother trying to forward the spam 
to the sender’s ISP. These days they’re mostly forged with aliases, and all 
you’ll do is succeed in clogging up the e-mail system. Here are a couple of 
places you can go to report spammers:
 
✦ Federal Trade Commission: Yes, your tax dollars are at work. The FTC 
would like you to forward the most annoying spam to uce@ftc.gov, 
where it will become available for law enforcement. (Especially in the 
case of e-mail trying to get your personal information.)
 
✦ spamcop.net: They’ve been around since 1988 and report spam e-mails 
to ISPs and mailers. They have a reporting link on their home page and 
work hard to get spammers out of the loop.
Keeping Your Password (and Accounts) Secure
When was the last time you changed your passwords? I mean the whole enchi-
lada: eBay, PayPal, your online bank account? Hey, I’m not the keeper of the 
shoulds, but you should change your critical passwords every 60 days — rain 
or shine. That’s not just me saying that. It’s all the security experts who know 
this kind of stuff. The world is full of bad-deed-doers just waiting to get their 
hands on your precious personal information. Password theft can lead to your 
bank account being emptied, your credit cards being pushed to the max, and 
worst of all, someone unsavory out there posing as you.
You’ve seen the commercials on TV poking fun at the very real problem of 
identity theft. If you ask around your circle of friends, no doubt you’ll find 
someone who knows someone who’s been in this pickle. It can take years to 
undo the damage caused by identity theft, so a better plan is to stay vigilant 
and protect yourself from becoming a victim. It can also take a lot of money — 
a Utica College study found that it costs the average victim of identity theft an 
actual dollar loss of $31,356.

Keeping Your Password (and Accounts) Secure
In this section, I give you some tips for selecting good passwords and other 
personal security information. I also show you the type of passwords to stay 
away from and what to do if (heaven forbid!) your personal information is 
compromised.
Reporting hacked accounts
If someone gets hold of your personal information, the most important thing 
to do is report it immediately. If you see any items that aren’t yours on the 
Items I’m Bidding On or the Items I’m Selling area of your My eBay page, it’s 
time to make a report — and fast!
Okay, you know that something hinky is going on with your eBay account 
because you never placed a bid on the Britney Spears stage-worn T-shirt (did 
you?). And you can’t imagine that your spouse did either (but double-check 
just to be sure). Here’s what to do immediately:
 
✦ Change your personal e-mail account password with your ISP: Go to 
your ISP’s home page (for example www.earthlink.net) and look 
for an area called Member Center or something similar. In the Member 
Center, access your personal account information — probably through 
a link called something like My Account. You should be able to change 
your password there.
 
✦ Change the e-mail account password on your home computer: Don’t 
forget to change the password on your computer’s e-mail software as 
well (Outlook, Firefox, and the like), so you can continue to download 
your e-mail from the server.
Perhaps you discover that your private information has been compromised 
when you suddenly can’t log in to your eBay or PayPal account. If this hap-
pens on eBay, follow these steps to request a new password:
 
1. Go to the eBay Sign In page.
 
 Don’t type your password. You just tried that and it doesn’t work.
 
2. Click the Forgot Your Password link, as shown in Figure 4-6.
 
 Doing this takes you to http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBay
ISAPI.dll?ForgotYourPasswordShow. Those silly security ques-
tions that you answered when you registered for eBay become very 
important now.
 
3. Answer at least one of the questions you see on the page and provide 
your registered phone number and ZIP code.
 
4. Click Continue.
 
 eBay will e-mail you instructions for resetting your password.

page.
 
 
5. When the e-mail arrives, follow the steps and change your password.
 
 If you don’t get eBay’s e-mail telling you how to change your password, 
that means some fraudster may have changed the contact information in 
your eBay account. See the sidebar “Freaking out is not a good thing” for 
instructions on what to do.
 
6. If all goes well and you can change your password, go to the link pic-
tured in Figure 4-7 to change your password hint (the secret question 
that lets the system know you’re you).

Keeping Your Password (and Accounts) Secure
Choosing a good secret question
If you read the harrowing procedure in the “Freaking out is not a good 
thing” sidebar, you know that having someone sabotage your eBay account 
is something you never want to go through. But if your secret question is 
easy to figure out, a hacker can find it even easier to wreak havoc on your 
account.
 
Your password is only as secure as the secret question, so don’t relate your 
password and secret question to each other in any way. For example, do not 
make your secret question a clue to your password — and especially don’t 
make your password answer the secret question. Better yet, think of your 
secret question as a separate, auxiliary security device for your account.
Figure 4-8 shows eBay’s Create a Secret Question and Answer page, which 
you can access from your My eBay Preferences page. It shows several sug-
gested questions.
 
Figure 4-8: 
Create 
your secret 
question.
 
Here are some tips for setting a secure secret question:
 
✦ Never use your mother’s maiden name. That is most likely the secret 
that your bank uses as your challenge question. (They usually ask when 
you open the account.) So that is definitely out — you don’t want to give 
anybody that word.

Freaking out is not a good thing
If you can’t seem to get a new password for 
your eBay account, and you’re unsuccessful 
at finding a Live Chat link, there’s still hope. 
Remain calm, follow these steps, and take 
notes as you go:
 1. Go to any eBay page, scroll all the way to 
the bottom, and click the Security Center 
link (see the figure).
 4. Click Report Problem.
 5. On the following page, find the boldface 
headline that reads Contacting eBay. Click 
the E-mail us to report that you cannot sign 
in to your account link.
 
 An e-mail form appears.
 2. When you get to the Security Center, click 
Report Problem.
 
 The Contact Us form appears.
 3. Highlight the type of your problem, as 
pictured in the figure.
 6. Fill in the e-mail form and send it.
 
 Be sure to tell eBay who you are (name, 
address, and phone number), your user ID 
and e-mail address, and a brief summary of 
the situation.
 
✦ Select a question and provide a creative answer:
 
• What is your pet’s name? Give an answer like Ralph the Rhino or 
Graak the Pterodactyl or something creative. Don’t give your actual 
pet’s name (or species). Anyone who knows you is likely to know 
your pet’s name.
 
• What street did you grow up on? Name an unusual landmark from 
your hometown. Don’t use a street name.

792
Keeping Your Password (and Accounts) Secure
 
• What is the name of your first school? Make up a good one — 
perhaps Elementary Penguin Academy? School of Hard Knox?
 
• What is your father’s middle name? Make up a goodie or skip it.
 
• What is your school’s mascot? There’s a lot of creativity that can go 
on here. How about Red-and-white-striped zebra? Pink elephant?
Your bylaws for selecting answers to a secret question are two: be creative 
and be sure you remember the darned thing!
Avoiding easily-hacked passwords
Poorly chosen passwords are the number-one loophole for hackers. If you 
think that hackers are just a small group of hypercaffeinated teenagers, think 
again. It’s now also the domain of small- and big-time crooks who hack into 
an account, spend a few thousand dollars that belong to someone else, and 
move on.
I searched Google for hacking software and came up with over 2 million 
matches. Many of these Web sites offer an arsenal of free hacking tools. 
They also provide step-by-step instructions for beginners on how to crack 
passwords. The Internet can be its own worst enemy.
Here are some industrial-strength tips for setting a secure password:
 
✦ Number of characters: Compose your password of more than 8 
characters.
 
✦ Case sensitivity: Because passwords are case-sensitive, take advantage 
of the feature. Mix lowercase and uppercase in your passwords.
 
✦ Letters and numbers: Combine letters and numbers to make your 
passwords harder to crack.
 
✦ Proper words: Don’t use proper words. Think of the title of your favorite 
book. Make your password the first two letters of each word with 
numbers in the middle (not sequential).
 
It should go without saying, but what the heck: Don’t use any of the sample 
passwords shown here. It’s safe to say that lots of people will be reading this 
book, and anything seen by lots of people isn’t secret. (I know you know 
that, but still.)

793
Keeping Your Password (and Accounts) Secure
Any beginning hacker (or tech-smart teenager) 
can figure out your password if it falls into the 
following categories. Don’t use ’em! They are 
pathetically easy!
 ✓ The obvious: The word Password. D’oh!
 ✓ Birthdays: Don’t use your birthday, your 
friend’s birthday, or John F. Kennedy’s 
birthday. Not only are these dates common 
knowledge, but so is this truism: A series of 
numbers is easy to crack.
 ✓ Names: Don’t use your first name, last 
name, your dog’s name, or anyone’s name. 
Again, it’s common knowledge and easy to 
find out. (Most people know my husband’s 
name; it’s been in many of my books!)
 ✓ Contact numbers: Nix on any Social 
Security Number (if they get hold of that 
one — watch out!), phone numbers, your 
e-mail address, or street address. (Got the 
white pages? So do they . . . .)
 ✓ Any of the lousy (easily cracked and most 
frequently used) passwords in the table: 
The words in this table have been gleaned 
from password dictionaries available from 
hackers. Note that this is not a complete 
list by any means; there are thousands of 
common (lousy) passwords, and “unprint-
able” ones are a lot more common than 
you may think. If you really care to scare 
yourself, Google the phrase common 
passwords.
Stay smart: Don’t be a make-it-easy!

Chapter 5: Networking Your Office
In This Chapter
✓ Setting up your network
✓ Getting secure, Internet style
T
he first time I spoke to my editors about putting information in my 
books about networking, they scoffed at me. Bah! People who work at 
home don’t need networks (as if networks were solely for big companies 
with lots of cubicles). The more I spoke to the eBay community, the more I 
saw the need for networks — and the more people asked me about them.
I started writing about eBay in 1999, and now it’s almost 10 years later. A lot 
of technology has washed under the bridge, and many advances have been 
made. Setting up a network in 1999 meant spending hours (maybe days) 
changing settings, testing, checking computers, and cursing. That was if you 
were lucky enough to finally get it right. Otherwise — as was the case for 
most home users, including me — you’d give up, take the whole thing as a 
loss, and go on with your life.
Lucky for us non-techie types, Microsoft has made Windows considerably 
more home-network-friendly than in the old days. Also, more pleasant 
modes of networking (other than having miles of Ethernet cables snaking 
around the walls of your house) came to the fore of technology.
By networking your home (or eBay office) you’ll save time by having the 
flexibility to work from different rooms or locations. You can also list auc-
tions out by the pool (or in your backyard) in summer!
This chapter is a quick and dirty discussion of home networks installed 
on Windows-based PCs. I give you a lesson on what I know works for most 
people. (Hey, if it doesn’t work, don’t e-mail me — head back to the store 
and get your money back!)
 
At this point, I want to remind you that I’m not a super techno-whiz, even 
though I do host a Computer and Technology Radio show (just like I’m not 
a lawyer or an accountant). For more information about anything you’d 
think to ask about home networking, I defer to Danny Briere, Pat Hurley, 
and Edward Ferris, authors of Wireless Home Networking For Dummies 
(published by Wiley).

796
The What and Why of Networks
The What and Why of Networks
What is a network? A network is a way to connect computers so that they 
can communicate with each other — as if they were one giant computer 
with different terminals. The best part is that a network enables high-speed 
Internet connection-sharing, as well as the sharing of printers and other 
peripherals. By setting up a computer network, one computer might run 
bookkeeping, another might run a graphics server, and others might be used 
as personal PCs for different users. From each networked computer, it’s pos-
sible to access programs and files on all other networked computers.
Today’s technologies allow you to perform this same miracle on the home 
network. You can connect as many computers as you like, and run your busi-
ness from anywhere in your home — you can even hook up your laptop from 
the bedroom if you don’t feel like getting out of bed.
Now for the whys of a home network. A network is a convenient way to run 
a business. All big companies use them, and so should you. You can extend 
your DSL line or Internet cable connection so that you can use it anywhere 
in your home — as well as in your office.
In a network, you can set certain directories in each computer to be shared. 
That way, other computers on the network can access those directories. 
You can also password-protect certain files and directories to prevent 
others (your children or your employees) from accessing them.
Variations of a Home Network
You have a choice of four types of home networks: Ethernet, powerline, 
home phoneline, and wireless. See Table 5-1 for a quick rundown of some 
pros and cons of each.

Variations of a Home Network

Cons
Wireless network**
Pretty fast; wireless (no 
ugly cords to deal with)
Expensive; may not 
be reliable because of 
interference from home 
electrical devices
*Connects computers over a maximum of 328 feet of cabling.
**Several flavors of wireless are available. See “Hooking up with wireless,” later in this chapter.
The home phoneline network is growing because the new 3.1 version sup-
ports coax (you know, coaxial — like what your cable TV uses). In fact, a 
recently released report on home networking shows HomePNA, the latest 
version of phoneline networking, grew at its highest rate in 2007, and kept 
that up through 2008. Ya know why? It’s the technology that cable compa-
nies use to get a telephone line to your home through a cable TV connection. 
But it’s hardly used for home networking (see sidebar further on).
The wireless network is the hot ticket — and it’s highly touted by the tech-
norati. There may be interference with a wireless signal because it runs with 
the same 2.4GHz technology as some home wireless telephones. My primary 
network is a hybrid, combining Ethernet and wireless.
With broadband over powerline, you get high-speed Internet directly into 
your home electrical system. Just plug in your powerline boxes (more on 
that later) and you’re up and running!
All networks need the following two devices:
 
✦ Router: A router allows you to share a single Internet IP address among 
multiple computers. A router does exactly what its name implies; it 
routes signals and data to and from the different computers on your 
network. If you have one computer, the router can act as a firewall or 
even a network device leading to a print server (a gizmo that attaches to 
your router and allows you to print directly to a printer without having 
another computer on).
 
✦ Modem: You need a modem for an Internet connection. You get one 
from your cable or phone company and plug it into an outlet with cable 
(just like your TV) or into a phone jack with the phone line for DSL. The 
modem connects to your router with an Ethernet cable.
 
If you have broadband, you don’t even need to have a main computer turned 
on to access the connection anywhere in the house. If you keep a printer 
turned on (and have a print server), you can also connect that to your router 
and print from your laptop in another room — right through the network.

Variations of a Home Network
 
Before touching your network card or opening your computer to install any-
thing, touch a grounded metal object to free yourself of static electricity. 
(Otherwise a spark could go from your hand to the delicate components on 
the network card or other computer card — which renders the card use-
less.) Better yet, go to an electronics store and purchase a wrist grounding 
strap (a cord with a gator clip), which you clip to a metal part of the com-
puter before touching anything inside it. The idea is to send the static elec-
tricity away from the components for safety.
Using a powerline network
An ingenious invention, a powerline network uses your existing home pow-
erlines to carry your network and your high-speed Internet connection. You 
access the network by plugging a powerline adapter from your computer 
into an electrical outlet in the wall. Powerline networks have been around 
for a while and are in the second round of technological advances.
Hooking up a powerline network is so easy that it’s a bit disappointing — 
you’ll wonder why it isn’t more complicated. Most installations work immedi-
ately right out of the box. Figure 5-1 shows you the base setup. Other rooms 
need only a powerline bridge adapter hooked up to the computer with an 
Ethernet cable to a network card.
To set up a powerline network, you’ll need the following (in addition to a 
router and modem):
The best part of networking today is that you 
can combine more than one type of network to 
form a fully functional, professional data-trans-
fer medium with Internet access — through-
out the house. In my house, I used to have an 
Ethernet/home phoneline/wireless combina-
tion. Home phoneline networks (10Mbps net-
works that operate over existing phone lines 
without the need for additional wiring, routers, 
or hubs) aren’t popular with consumers. It’s not 
that they didn’t work flawlessly; they did. It just 
seems that I’m the only one in the United States 
with enough free phone jacks in my home and 
office to make it work.
After the downfall of phoneline networking, the 
geniuses began to think, “What does the aver-
age home have lots of outlets for?” Hmmmm, 
how about electricity? Duh, how about running 
the network through a home’s electric outlets? 
And behold, the powerline network was born.
Now we have wireless networks too — and 
they’re life-changing when they work. It’s 
funny to see a whole new generation of people 
moving around tweaking antennas to try to get 
a good signal. It reminds me of television when 
I was a kid. (Maybe I should put some tin foil 
around the wireless antenna?)
So many networks, so little time

✦ Electrical outlets: I’ll bet you have more than one in each room.
 
✦ An Ethernet card for each computer: Many new computers already 
have an Ethernet card. If yours doesn’t, you can get inexpensive 
Ethernet cards for around $10 each.
 
✦ Powerline Ethernet bridge for each computer: You plug an Ethernet 
cable from your computer into the powerline Ethernet bridge, a small box 
(about the size of a pack of cigarettes) that plugs into any two- or three-
prong electrical outlet. See Figure 5-2.

The benefits of this nifty little system are as follows:
 
✦ It’s inexpensive. The requisite powerline magic box costs around $40, 
but you’ll need one for each computer.
 
✦ It’s fast — as fast as (or faster than) other network connections. You 
could stream DVD movies from one room to another.
 
✦ The networking connection is made through your existing electrical 
wiring. It doesn’t consume extra electricity.
 
✦ Installation is easy. Just plug a cable into your computer, and connect 
the cable to the powerline box. Plug in the powerline box.
 
✦ If your computer has an Ethernet jack, you don’t need to open up your 
computer. Most new computers come with an Ethernet jack.
If you have a high-speed Internet connection, no doubt you received a 
modem when you signed up. Because it’s not common to connect the 
modem directly to your computer (a router does the network routing for 
you), you may already have a router.
The integration works like this:
 
✦ The high-speed connection comes in through your DSL or cable line.
 
✦ The cable (or DSL) line plugs into your modem.
 
✦ An Ethernet cable goes from your modem into a router.
 
✦ One “out” Ethernet cable connection from the router goes to a local 
computer.
 
✦ Another “out” Ethernet cable goes to the powerline adapter.
 
✦ The powerline box plugs into a convenient wall outlet.
When you want to connect the computers in other rooms to the network, 
just plug in a magic powerline box.

Variations of a Home Network
Hooking up with wireless
Wireless networking (also known as WiFi or IEEE 802.11 networking) is the 
hot technology for all kinds of networks. It’s an impressive system when it 
works, with no cables or connectors to bog you down.
As a matter of fact, I was in New York recently, staying on the 16th floor of a 
hotel. I turned on my travel laptop to check e-mail and my laptop found sig-
nals for nine wireless networks! I had to call the front desk to find out which 
one was the hotel connection. The whole world seems to be wireless.
Just so you know, I wouldn’t have been able to connect to the other net-
works. Wireless networks are protected by their own brand of security. The 
original technology, called WEP (or wired equivalent privacy), led the way 
in home Wi-Fi security. WEP encrypted your wireless transmissions and 
prevents others from getting into your network. Sadly, it got so that a high 
school kid could crack this system, so now home users are using WPA (Wi-Fi 
Protected Access) and even WPA-2.
WPA utilizes a “pre-shared key” (PSK) mode, where every user on the net-
work is given the same passphrase. In the PSK mode, security depends on 
the strength and secrecy of the passphrase. So, to link your laptop or 
desktop to a wireless network with WPA encryption, you need the pre-
determined passphrase. Just enter it during setup — on every computer that 
uses the network — and you should be good to go.
 
Most Wi-Fi hotspots you may come across may not have any encryption, and 
some may be free for all to use.
The different flavors of wireless
If you’ve ever used a wireless telephone at home, you’ve used a technology 
similar to a wireless network. Most home wireless phones transmit on the 
radio frequency band of 2.4 GHz and have the option to choose from several 
channels automatically to give you the best connection.
The two prevalent forms of wireless networks also work on the 2.4GHz band, 
and you will need to preset the channel when you set up the system. But 
there are basically three types of wireless:
 
✦ 802.11a: This is a wireless format that works really well — fast with 
good connectivity. It’s used when you have to serve up a wireless con-
nection to a large group of people, as in a convention center or a dormi-
tory. It’s fast, delivering data at speeds as high as 54 Mbps (megabits per 
second). It also runs at the 5GHz band (hence its nickname, WiFi5), so 
it doesn’t compete with wireless phones or microwave ovens for band-
width. It’s also very expensive.

802
Variations of a Home Network
 
✦ 802.11b: My laptop has a built-in 802.11b card, so I can connect to the 
ever popular hotspots in Starbucks and airports. It’s the most common 
wireless type and is used on the most platforms right now. The b version 
is slower than the a version and can transfer data at only 11 Mbps. It’s a 
solid, low-cost solution when you have no more than 32 users per access 
point.
 
 The lower frequency of 2.4 GHz drains less power from laptops and 
other portable devices. Also, 2.4GHz signals travel farther, and can work 
through walls and floors more effectively than 5GHz signals.
 
✦ 802.11g: This is the next incarnation of Wi-Fi-based on the 2.4GHz band. 
It speeds data to a possible 54 Mbps and is backward-compatible with 
802.11b service.
 
✦ 802.11n: The newest mode builds on the previous standards by adding 
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). MIMO is a technology that uses 
multiple antennas (usually built into the router) to carry more informa-
tion than previously with a single antenna. It uses the 5GHz band (versus 
the 2.4 it used previously). It also increases speed through your TCP/IP 
connection to 100 Mbps.
 
 For maximum speed, your entire network needs to be an 802.11n 5GHz 
network. In my house, an all-802.11n network doesn’t work at full speed 
because I have existing laptops on 802.11b/g. I run a mixed 802.11b/g/n 
network until I replace all my laptops with 802.11n. Until I do that, my 
system runs at the old, pokey 54 Mbps.
Setting up your wireless network
With a wireless network, you have to hook your computer (a laptop works 
best) to a wireless access point to perform some beginning setup tasks such 
as choosing your channel and setting up your WPA passphrase.
When you complete the setup and turn on your wireless access point, you 
have a WiFi hotspot in your home or office. Typically, your new hotspot 
will provide coverage for at least 100 feet in all directions, although walls 
and floors cut down on the range. Even so, you should get good coverage 
throughout a typical home. For a large home, you can buy signal boosters to 
increase the range of your hotspot.
Simplified, this is how you configure your network:
 
1. Run a cable from your DSL or cable line to your modem.
 
2. Connect an Ethernet cable from your modem to your router.
 
3. Type in the passphrase to all computers on the network.
Take a look at this network diagram from Netgear in Figure 5-3.

The home phoneline network
The technology that used to allow me (and millions of other users) to run 
a network through my home phone line now drives much of the ability to 
receive Internet, digital TV, and telephone on one line.
Obviously, this system is fast and reliable (320 Mbps), it carries tons of data 
to homes each day. Unfortunately, the newest of this technology is not avail-
able for the home user — yet. Keep your eyes peeled for this, because a 
high-speed wireless/HPNA 3.1 network will really rock.
Using a hybrid network
You may find that a wireless network may not work throughout your home. 
That’s easy to correct. You can combine different networks, allowing you to 
have wireless connectivity in some rooms of your house and in your back-
yard, and a wired network inside your house.

804
Internet Security and Your Home Network
I had an old-fashioned home-phoneline network coming from my router, 
along with a wireless access point. All the components were the same 
brand (Netgear), so there was no compatibility problem. I still go the single-
brand route, so no matter where I go (or if my family wants to log on to the 
Internet), we can hook up with ease.
Internet Security and Your Home Network
A dial-up connection exposes your computer to the Internet only when you 
dial up and get connected. Most broadband Internet connections are always 
on — which means your computer is always exposed. You should shield 
your computer with a strong firewall and an antivirus program.
Exposing your computer’s vulnerabilities
When you’re connected to the Internet, you’re exposed not only to hackers 
but also to threats such as Trojan horses, programs that can get into your 
computer when you innocently view an infected Web site. Once inside your 
computer, the Trojan horse, like ET, phones home. From there, an evil-deed-
doer, who now has a direct line to your computer, may be able to wreak 
havoc with your precious data.
Visit the Web site for Gibson Research Corporation, at www.grc.com. 
Gibson Research is the brainchild of an early PC pioneer, Steve Gibson, 
who’s renowned as a genius in the world of codes and programming. Steve 
is the expert when it comes to exposing the vulnerabilities of systems over 
the Internet. A few free diagnostic programs on this site will check your com-
puter’s vulnerability to Internet threats.
Shields Up and LeakTest test your computer and terrify you with results that 
expose the vulnerability of your Internet connection.
Adding antivirus and firewall software
You’re going to need antivirus software to protect you from the idiots who 
think it’s fun to send destructive code through e-mail. The most popular 
antivirus products (because they’re bundled with new systems) are Norton 
and McAfee. I also like a product called Panda Security.
