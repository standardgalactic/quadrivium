Preface
Preface
Portfolio analysis is the part of financial mathematics that is covered in existing textbooks mainly from 
the financial point of view without focussing on mathematical foundations of the theory. The aim of 
this book is to explain the foundations of portfolio analysis as a consistent mathematical theory, where 
assumptions are stated, steps are justified and theorems are proved. However, we left out details of 
the assumptions for equilibrium market and capital asset pricing model in order to keep the focus on 
mathematics. 
Part 1 of the book is a general mathematical introduction with topics in matrix algebra, random variables 
and regression, which are necessary for understanding the financial chapters. The mathematical concepts 
and theorems in Part 1 are widely known, so we explain them briefly and mostly without proofs.
The topics in Part 2 include portfolio analysis and capital market theory from the mathematical point 
of view. The book contains many practical examples with solutions and exercises.
The book will be useful for lecturers and students who can use it as a textbook and for anyone who is 
interested in mathematical models of financial theory and their justification. The book grew out of a 
course in financial mathematics at the Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand.

Terminology
--
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. 
--
A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m√ón-matrix (m by n matrix). 
--
An n√ón-matrix is called a square matrix.
--
A 1√ón-matrix is called a row matrix.
--
An m√ó1-matrix is called a column matrix.

For a matrix A the element in row i, column j is denoted aij. So A = [aij ] is the short notation for the 
matrix A.
Denote 0 a column of all zeroes (the length is usually obvious from context).
A square matrix A = [aij ] is called symmetric if aij = aji for any i, j.

Cramer‚Äôs Rule. If m = n and det A ‚â† 0, then the system (1) has a unique solution given by: 
xi = ‚àÜ
‚àÜi  (i = 1,‚Ä¶, n), where ‚àÜ = det A and ‚àÜ i is the determinant obtained from det A by 
replacing the i-th column by the column B.
Theorem 1.3. If m < n, then a homogeneous system of m linear equations with n unknowns 
has a non-zero solution (that is a solution different from 0).
Theorem 1.4. Suppose X0 is a solution of system (1). Then

Theorem 1.5. If an n√ón-matrix S is positive definite, then it is invertible and S ‚Äì1 is also 
positive definite.
Proof
By the Sylvester criterion det S > 0, so S is invertible by Theorem 1.2.
Consider an n√ó1-matrix x ‚â† 0 and denote y = S ‚àí1 x. Then y is also an n√ó1-matrix. If y = 0,  
then S ‚àí1 x = 0, S (S ‚àí1x) = 0 and x = 0. Contradiction. Hence y ‚â† 0. 
S is symmetric, so S ‚àí1 is also symmetric. yT S y = (S ‚àí1x )T S (S ‚àí1x ) = xT (S ‚àí1) T I n x = xT S ‚àí1 x . 
So xT S ‚àí1x = yT S y > 0 because S is positive definite. Therefore S ‚àí1 is positive definite. ‚òê

Orthogonal Projection

2.1	
Orthogonal Projection onto a Subspace
Denote R the set of all real numbers. Denote Rn the set of all ordered sequences of real numbers of length n.
A non-empty set L with operations of addition and multiplication by a real number is called 
a linear space if it satisfies the following 10 axioms: 
for any x, y, z ‚ààL and Œª, Œº ‚ààR:
1) (x + y)‚ààL;
2) Œªx‚ààL;
3) x + y = y + x;
4) (x + y) + z = x + (y + z);
5) there exists an element 0‚ààL such that (‚àÄx‚ààL)(0 + x = x);
6) for any x‚ààL there exists ‚àíx‚ààL such that ‚àíx + x = 0;
7) 1‚ãÖx = x;
8) (ŒªŒº) x = Œª(Œºx );
9) (Œª + Œº) x = Œªx + Œºx;
10) Œª(x + y) = Œªx + Œªy.
In this chapter we consider a Euclidean space L, that is a linear space with scalar product. In this space 
(x, y) denotes the scalar product of vectors x and y; || x || = (
)
x,x
 is the norm of the vector x. 
Vectors x and y are called orthogonal (x ‚ä• y) if the scalar product (x, y) = 0.
Suppose x is a vector in L and W is a linear subspace of L. A vector z is called the orthogonal 
projection of x onto W if z‚ààW and (x ‚àí z) ‚ä• W.
Then z is denoted Proj W x.

Orthogonal Projection onto a Vector
The orthogonal projection of a vector x onto a vector y is Proj W x, where W = {ty | t‚ààR}. 
This projection is denoted Proj y x.
The length of Proj y x is called the orthogonal scalar projection of x onto y and is denoted 
proj y x.

Minimal Property of Orthogonal Projection 
A subset Q of a linear space B is called an affine subspace of B if there is q‚ààQ and a linear 
subspace W of B such that Q = {q + w | w‚ààW }. Then W is called the corresponding linear 
subspace. 
It is easy to check that any vector in Q can be taken as q.
Lemma 2.1. Consider a consistent system of m linear equations with n unknowns in its matrix form: 
AX = B. The set of all solutions of the system AX = B is an affine subspace of Rn and its corresponding 
linear subspace is the set of all solutions of the homogeneous system AX = 0.
Theorem 2.2. Let Q = {q + w | w‚ààW } be an affine subspace of L. Then the vector in Q with 
smallest length is unique and is given by the formula: 
xmin = q ‚àí Proj W q.

Denote z = Proj W q, then xmin = q ‚àí z. 
Consider any vector y‚ààQ. For some w‚ààW, y = q + w. By Theorem 2.1.1), z is the vector in W closest 
to q and ‚àí w‚ààW, so we have 
|| y || = || q ‚àí (‚àí w) || ‚â• || q ‚àí z || = || xmin ||.
The equality holds only when ‚àíw = z, that is when y = q + w = q ‚àí z = xmin . 
Since xmin is unique, it does not depend on the choice of q. ‚òê

Numerical Characteristics of a Random Variable
Consider a probability space (‚Ñ¶, ‚Ñë, P) where Œ© is a sample space of elementary events (outcomes), ‚Ñë 
is a œÉ-field of events and P is a probability measure on the pair (Œ©, ‚Ñë). We will fix the probability space 
for the rest of the chapter.

A function X: Œ© ‚Üí R is called a random variable if for any real number x,  
{œâ ‚àà Œ© | X (œâ) ‚â§ x} ‚àà ‚Ñë. 
--
The distribution function F of a random variable X is defined by F(x) = P{X ‚â§ x} 
for any real number x.
--
A random variable X is called discrete if the set of its possible values is finite or 
countable.

where x1, x2, x3,‚Ä¶ are all possible values of X and pi = P(X = xi ), i = 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶ 
Example 3.1. A player rolls a fair die. He wins $1 if a three turns up, he wins $5 if a four turns up and 
he wins nothing otherwise. Denote X the value of a win. 
Here the sample space is Œ© = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. ‚Ñë is the set of all subsets of Œ©. The function X is defined 
by: X(1) = X (2) = X (5) = X (6) = 0, X (3) = 1, X (4) = 5.
Clearly X is a discrete random variable.
Since the die is fair, the probability of getting any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 equals

Define a binary relation ~ for random variables: X ~ Y if P{œâ | X(œâ) ‚â† Y(œâ)} = 0. Next two lemmas are 
about this binary relation.
Lemma 3.1. The defined relation ~ is an equivalence relation on random variables.
Proof
a)	 For any random variable X, X ~ X because {œâ | X(œâ) ‚â† X(œâ)} = ‚àÖ, the empty set. So ~ is 
reflexive.
b)	 For any random variables X and Y, X ~ Y implies Y ~ X because {œâ | X(œâ) ‚â† Y(œâ)} = 
= {œâ | Y(œâ) ‚â† X(œâ)}. So ~ is symmetric.

c)	 Assume that for random variables X, Y, Z, X ~ Y and Y ~ Z. Then 
{œâ | X(œâ) ‚â† Z(œâ)} ‚äÜ {œâ | X(œâ) ‚â† Y(œâ)} ‚à™{œâ | Y(œâ) ‚â† Z(œâ)} and 
0 ‚â§ P{œâ | X(œâ) ‚â† Z(œâ)} ‚â§ P{œâ | X(œâ) ‚â† Y(œâ)} + P{œâ | Y(œâ) ‚â† Z(œâ)}= 0 + 0 = 0. So ~ is transitive. ‚òê 
In other words, two random variables X and Y are equivalent (X ~ Y) if they are equal with probability 1.
Lemma 3.2.
1)	 For any random variables X1, X2 and Œª‚ààR : 	
X1 ~ X2 ‚áí (ŒªX1 ) ~ (ŒªX2 ). 
2)	 For any random variables X1, X2, Y: 	
X1 ~ X2 ‚áí (X1 + Y) ~ (X2 + Y). 
3)	 For any random variables X1, X2, Y1, Y2: 	
X1 ~ X2 & Y1 ~ Y2 ‚áí (X1 + Y1) ~ (X2 + Y2).
Proof
1)	 is obvious.
2)	 follows from the equality { œâ | X1(œâ) + Y(œâ) ‚â† X2(œâ) + Y(œâ)} = { œâ | X1(œâ) ‚â† X2(œâ)}.
3)	 follows from 2) and the fact that ~ is an equivalence relation. ‚òê
Denote [X] the equivalence class of a random variable X. 
Operations of addition and multiplication by a real number on equivalence classes are given 
by the following: [X] + [Y] = [X + Y] and Œª‚ãÖ[X] = [ŒªX].
Lemma 3.2 makes these definitions valid.
In the rest of the book we will use the notation X instead of [X] for brevity remembering that equivalent 
random variables are considered equal.

4.1	
Euclidean Space of Random Variables
Define H = {X | X is a random variable on (Œ©, ‚Ñë, P) and E(X 2) < ‚àû}. Thus, H is the set of all random 
variables on the probability space, whose squares have finite expectations. A similar approach is used 
in the textbook by Grimmett and Stirzaker (2004).
Lemma 4.1. 
1)	 For any X‚ààH and Œª‚ààR:‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ E(X 2) < ‚àû‚ÄÉ ‚áí‚ÄÉ E[(Œª X)2] < ‚àû.
2)	 For any X, Y‚ààH:‚ÄÉ ‚ÄÉ E(X 2) < ‚àû & E(Y 2) < ‚àû‚ÄÉ ‚áí‚ÄÉ E[(X + Y)2] < ‚àû.
Proof
1)	 It follows from the fact that E[(Œª X)2] = Œª2 E(X 2). 
2)	 Since 2XY ‚â§ X 2 + Y 2 , we have 0 ‚â§ (X + Y)2 = X 2 + Y 2 + 2XY ‚â§ 2X 2 + 2Y 2 and this implies 
E[(X + Y)2] < ‚àû. ‚òê
Lemma 4.1 shows that the set H is closed under the operations of addition and multiplication by a real 
number.
Theorem 4.1. The set H (where equivalent random variables are considered equal) with the 
operations of addition and multiplication by a real number is a linear space.
Proof
H is a linear space means it satisfies the following 10 axioms: for any X, Y, Z ‚ààH and Œª, Œº ‚ààR,
1)	
(X + Y)‚ààH;
2)	
ŒªX‚ààH;
3)	
X + Y = Y + X;
4)	
(X + Y) + Z = X + (Y + Z);
5)	
there exists an element 0‚ààH such that (‚àÄX‚ààH)(0 + X = X);
6)	
for any X‚ààH there exists ‚àíX‚ààH such that ‚àíX + X = 0;
7)	
1‚ãÖX = X;
8)	
(ŒªŒº) X = Œª(ŒºX );
9)	
(Œª + Œº) X = ŒªX + ŒºX;
10)	 Œª(X + Y) = ŒªX + ŒªY.

Regression
In probability theory it is proven that for any random variables X and Y their sum X + Y is a random 
variable, and for any real number Œª the product ŒªX is also a random variable. Together with Lemma 4.1 
this proves the conditions 1) and 2). 0 in condition 5) is the random variable that always equals 0. The 
remaining conditions are quite obvious. ‚òê
For any X, Y‚ààH, define œÜ(X, Y) = E(XY). We have: E(X 2) < ‚àû and E(Y 2) < ‚àû.
Since

, then E(XY) < ‚àû. So the definition œÜ(X, Y) is valid for any X, Y‚ààH.
Theorem 4.2. For any X, Y‚ààH and Œª‚ààR,
1.	 œÜ(Y, X) = œÜ(X, Y);
2.	 œÜ(ŒªX, Y) = ŒªœÜ(X, Y);
3.	 œÜ(X + Y, Z) = œÜ(X, Z) + œÜ(Y, Z);
4.	 œÜ(X, X) ‚â• 0 ;
5.	 œÜ(X, X) = 0 ‚áí X = 0.
Proof
Properties 1‚Äì4 follow directly from the definition of œÜ and properties of expectation.
5. If œÜ(X, X) = 0, then E(X 2) = 0 and X = 0 with probability 1. ‚òê
Theorem 4.2 implies the following. 
(X, Y) = E(XY) defines a scalar product on the linear space H.
H with this scalar product is a Euclidean space.
In simple cases we can construct a basis of the linear space H. The following example illustrates that.
Example 4.1. Consider a finite sample space ‚Ñ¶ = {œâ1, œâ2,..., œân } with the probabilities of the outcomes  
pi = P(œâi) > 0, i = 1,..., n. In this case we can introduce a finite orthogonal basis in the Euclidean space H.

Regression
Since I 2 = I and E(I) = 1, we have I‚ààH.
Lemma 4.2. For any X‚ààH, E(X) and Var(X) are defined.
Proof
Consider X‚ààH. The scalar product (X, I) is defined, since I‚ààH. (X, I) = E(XI) = E(X), so E(X) is defined. 
Since X‚ààH, E(X 2) is defined. Therefore Var(X) = E(X 2) ‚àí E(X) 2 is defined. ‚òê
Lemma 4.3. Let X‚ààH have parameters E(X) = Œº and Var(X) = œÉ 2, œÉ ‚â• 0. Then
1)	 || X || =

Proof
1)	 || X || 2 = (X, X) = E(X 2) = Var(X) + E(X) 2 = œÉ 2 + Œº 2, so || X || =

2)	 follows from 1) because E(X ‚Äì Œº) = 0 and Var(X ‚Äì Œº) = œÉ 2. ‚òê

X 2 and Y 2 are also independent, so E(X 2 Y 2) = E(X 2) E(Y 2) and || XY || 2 = E(X 2 Y 2) =

Regression
Regression means ‚Äúestimating an inaccessible random variable Y in terms of an accessible random variable 
X‚Äù (Hsu, 1997), that is finding a function f (X) ‚Äúclosest‚Äù to Y. f (X) can be restricted to a certain class of 
functions, the most common being the class of linear functions. We describe ‚Äúclosest‚Äù in terms of the 
distance d defined in Section 4.1.
Theorem 2.1 shows that Proj W Y is the vector in subspace W that minimizes distance d(Y, U) from the 
fixed vector Y to vector U in W. In statistical terms, Proj W Y minimizes the mean square error 
E((Y‚àíU) 2 ) = d 2(Y, U) for vector U in W.
Theorem 4.3. The conditional expectation E(Y | X) is the function of X closest to Y. 
Proof
It is based on the following fact:
E(Y | X) = Proj W Y
for W = { f (X) | f: R ‚Üí R and f (X)‚àà H}.
Grimmett & Stirzaker (2004) prove this fact by showing that E(Y | X)‚ààW and that for any h(X)‚ààW, 
E[(Y ‚àí E(Y | X))‚ãÖ h (X)] = 0, that is (Y ‚àí E(Y | X)) ‚ä• h (X). ‚òê
By choosing different W in Theorem 2.1 we can get different types of regression: simple linear, multiple 
linear, quadratic, polynomial, etc.
4.3	
Regression to a Constant
When we want to estimate a random variable Y by a constant, we use a subspace W = {aI | a‚ààR} of the 
space H. 
Theorem 4.4. For any Y‚ààH with E(Y) = Œº:
1) Proj W Y = ŒºI, we denote ŒºI as Œº;
2) Œº is the constant closest to Y.

Regression
Proof
1)	 By Lemma 4.6.8), Proj I Y = ŒºI. So (Y‚àíŒºI) ‚ä• I and (Y‚àíŒºI, I) = 0.
For any vector aI‚ààW, (Y‚àíŒºI, aI) = a (Y‚àíŒºI, I) = 0, so (Y‚àíŒºI) ‚ä• aI. By the definition of orthogonal 
projection, ŒºI = Proj W Y.
2)	 By Theorem 2.1, Proj W Y = ŒºI is the vector in W closest to Y, and W is the set of constant 
random variables. So ŒºI is the constant random variable closest to Y. ‚òê
Theorem 4.4 shows that the expectation E(Y) is the best constant estimator for the random variable Y.

Proof
Denote W = {a + b X | a, b ‚ààR}. Since Proj W Y ‚ààW, we have Proj W Y = Œ± + Œ≤ X for some Œ±, Œ≤ ‚ààR. We 
just need to show that Œ± and Œ≤ are given by the formula (5). 
For Œµ = Y ‚àí Proj W Y = Y ‚àí (Œ± + Œ≤ X), we have Œµ ‚ä• 1 and Œµ ‚ä• X, since 1, X‚ààW. 
So (Œµ, 1) = 0 and (Œµ, X) = 0, (Œ± + Œ≤ X, 1) = (Y, 1) and (Œ± + Œ≤ X, X) = (Y, X), which leads to a system of

Corollary. Denote ≈∂ = Œ± + Œ≤ X the best linear estimator of Y from Theorem 4.5. The corresponding 
residual Œµ = Y ‚àí ≈∂ has the following properties: 
1) ¬µ Œµ = 0, 2) Cov (Œµ, X) = 0.
Proof
1)	 Œµ ‚ä• 1, so E(Œµ) = 0.
2)	 Œµ ‚ä• X , so E(Œµ X) = 0 and Cov (Œµ, X) = E(Œµ X) ‚àí E(Œµ) ‚ãÖ E(X) = 0. ‚òê
According to the Corollary, the residuals (estimation errors) equal 0 on average and are uncorrelated 
with the predictor X; this is another evidence that ≈∂ is the best linear estimator of Y. 
Example 4.5. Create a linear regression model for a response variable Y versus a predictor variable X if 
ŒºX = 2, œÉX = 1, ŒºY = 3 and Cov(Y, X) = ‚àí2.

According to Theorem 4.5, Œ≤ =

Hence ≈∂ = 7 ‚àí 2X is the linear function of X closest to Y; Y = 7 ‚àí 2X + Œµ. ‚òê

Answer: Y = 1.4 + 0.32 X + Œµ.

A portfolio is a group of financial assets held by an investor.
 
Consider a portfolio consisting of assets A1, A2,‚Ä¶, AN. 
The proportion (or weight) of asset Ak (k = 1, 2,‚Ä¶, N) in the portfolio equals

Example 5.2. Ben invested $20 in stock A1, $30 in stock A2 and $50 in stock A3. What are the stocks‚Äô

2)	 The $ return for A1 equals $50√ó0.02 = $1, the $ return for A2 equals $30√ó0.10 = $3, and the 
$ return for portfolio x equals $1 + $3 = $4. The % return for x equals 
 = 0.05 = 5%.
Another way to calculate % return: 0.625√ó2% + 0.375√ó10% = 5%. ‚òê
The % return r from an investment is treated as a random variable.
The expected return from the investment is ¬µ = E(r). 
The variance Var(r) and standard deviation œÉr are used as measures of the investment‚Äôs 
risk.

For asset G calculate: 1) the expected return, 2) variance, 3) standard deviation. 
Solution
Denote r the return from asset G; r is a random variable.
1)	 The expected return is ¬µ = E(r) = 20 √ó 0.3 + 12 √ó 0.5 + 4 √ó 0.2 = 12.8%.
2)	 The variance is œÉ 2 = Var(r) = (20‚Äì12.8) 2 √ó0.3 + (12‚Äì12.8) 2 √ó0.5 + (4 ‚Äì12.8) 2 √ó0.2 = 31.36.

Short Sales
In the previous examples all proportions in the portfolios are positive. However, the case of negative 
proportions is also possible; it means short sales.
A short sale (or short position) represents the ability to sell a security that the seller does 
not own.

The purpose of it can be profiting from an expected price decline of the asset. In this book we will ignore 
all transaction costs.
In contrast to a short position, a long position involves simply buying and holding an asset. In this case 
the proportion of the asset in the portfolio is positive.
Example 5.5. Margaret invested $30 in stock A1, $40 in stock A2 and uses someone else‚Äôs stock A3, which 
is worth $20 (a short sale). What are the stocks‚Äô proportions in this portfolio?

Minimizing Risk
To measure the risk of an investment we will use the standard deviation of its return, since standard 
deviation expresses the variability of the return values of the investment.

Which asset should an investor choose?
Solution
The expected returns are,
for asset A1: ¬µ1 = 3 √ó 0.4 + 8 √ó 0.6 = 6, for asset A2: ¬µ2 = 5 √ó 0.8 + 10 √ó 0.2 = 6.
The variances are,
for asset A1: 	
œÉ1
2 = (3 ‚Äì 6) 2 √ó 0.4 + (8 ‚Äì 6) 2 √ó 0.6 = 6,
for asset A2: 	
œÉ2
2 = (5 ‚Äì 6) 2 √ó 0.8 + (10‚Äì 6) 2 √ó 0.2 = 4.
Thus, the assets have the same expected returns. The variance is lower for the asset A2 and so is the 
standard deviation. The investor should choose asset A2, since it has less risk. ‚òê
Example 5.8. Suppose the returns of assets A1 and A2 from Example 5.7 have the covariance œÉ12 = ‚àí1.

4) Which portfolio is the best?
Solution
We have found parameters of the assets in Example 5.7. 
For asset A1: ¬µ1 = 6, œÉ1
2 = 6. For asset A2: ¬µ2 = 6, œÉ2
2 = 4.
1)	 x = 0.5r1 + 0.5r2 , 
¬µ x = 0.5¬µ1 + 0.5¬µ2 = 0.5 √ó 6 + 0.5 √ó 6 = 6,
œÉx
2 = Var(0.5r1 + 0.5r2 ) = 0.52 œÉ1
2 + 0.52 œÉ2
2 + 2 √ó 0.5 √ó 0.5 √ó Cov(r1 , r2) = 
= 0.25 √ó 6 + 0.25 √ó 4 + 0.5 √ó (‚àí1) = 2.
2)	 y = 0.4r1 + 0.6r2,  
¬µ y = 0.4¬µ1 + 0.6¬µ2 = 0.4 √ó 6 + 0.6 √ó 6 = 6,
œÉy
2 = Var(0.4r1 + 0.6r2) = 0.4 2 √ó 6 + 0.6 2 √ó 4 + 2 √ó 0.4 √ó 0.6 √ó (‚àí1) = 1.92.
3)	 z = ‚àí0.2r1 + 1.2r2, 
¬µ z = ‚àí0.2¬µ1 + 1.2¬µ2 = ‚àí0.2 √ó 6 + 1.2 √ó 6 = 6,

4)	 All three portfolios have the same expected return of 6. Portfolio y has the lowest variance

2 = 1.92. Portfolio y is the best, since it has the lowest risk. ‚òê

is the covariance matrix of the asset returns. 
We will assume that all expected returns Œº1 ,‚Ä¶, ŒºN are defined and the covariance matrix S exists with 
det S > 0. The positivity of the determinant of S is equivalent to the fact that the random variables r1,‚Ä¶, 
rN are linearly independent (see properties of covariance matrix in Section 3.3). This also implies that 
r1,‚Ä¶, rN are linearly independent as vectors in the Euclidean space H described in Section 4.1.

Envelope of Financial Assets
Generally portfolios with higher expected returns carry higher risks. However, it is possible to identify, 
among all portfolios with the same expected return, a portfolio with lowest risk, i.e., a portfolio with 
lowest variance.
A portfolio is called an envelope portfolio if it has the lowest variance among all portfolios 
with the same expected return.
An envelope portfolio minimizes risk for a given targeted return.
The set of all envelope portfolios is called the envelope of the assets A1, ‚Ä¶, AN and is 
denoted Env(A1, ‚Ä¶, AN).

Portfolios are combinations of at least two assets, so only the case N ‚â• 2 is meaningful.
The problem (6) can be solved as a calculus problem in coordinate form using partial derivatives and 
Lagrange multipliers. Instead we will apply orthogonal projection in the Euclidean space K to produce 
an invariant geometric solution.
Since E(x) = Mx, the last two equations in (6) have this matrix form:

In case N = 2 for any ¬µ‚ààR there is only one portfolio with expected return ¬µ. We will consider the case 
N ‚â• 3.
Denote Q and W the sets of all solutions of the systems (7) and (8), respectively. By Lemma 2.1, Q is 
an affine subspace of K and W is its corresponding linear subspace with dimension N‚àí2 (since U and 
M are independent). The affine subspace Q can be written as Q = {q + w | w‚ààW} for any solution q of 
the system (7).
Theorem 5.3. For any ¬µ‚ààR, there is a unique envelope portfolio with expected return ¬µ. It 
equals:
x¬µ = q ‚àí ProjW q,
where q is any solution of (7).
Proof
An envelope portfolio x with expected return ¬µ is a solution of the system (7) with smallest variance and 
|| x ||2 = (x, x) = E(x2) = Var(x) + [E(x)] 2 = Var(x) + ¬µ 2.
So the smallest variance means the smallest length, since E(x) = ¬µ is fixed. Next apply Theorem 2.2. ‚òê
Theorem 5.4. Let v1,..., vN‚àí2 be an orthogonal system of solutions of the system (8). Then
1) for any y‚ààH, (y, vk) = Cov(y, vk), k = 1,..., N‚àí2;
2) the envelope portfolio with expected return ¬µ equals:

Proof
1)	 Each vk is a solution of (8), so E(vk) = M vk = 0.

For any y‚ààH, (y, vk) = E(y‚ãÖ vk) = Cov(y, vk) + E(y) ‚ãÖE(vk) = Cov(y, vk) + E(y) ‚ãÖ 0 = Cov(y, vk). 
2)	 The system v1,..., vN‚àí2 is an orthogonal basis in W, so the result follows from Theorems 5.3

Principle of Two Fund Separation 
Principle of Two Fund Separation. Let x and y be two envelope portfolios, x ‚â† y. Then the 
envelope equals the set {Œ≥x + (1‚àí Œ≥) y | Œ≥‚ààR}.
Proof
We need to prove that Env(A1, ‚Ä¶, AN) = {Œ≥ x + (1‚àí Œ≥) y | Œ≥‚ààR}.
Denote ¬µ1 = E(x) and ¬µ2 = E(y). Fix an orthogonal system v1,..., vN‚àí2 of solutions of the system:

Mean-Variance Analysis 
6.2	
Efficient Frontier
A portfolio is called an efficient portfolio if it has the highest expected return among all 
portfolios with the same variance.
An efficient portfolio maximizes expected return for a given risk.
The set of all efficient portfolios is called the efficient frontier of the assets A1, ‚Ä¶, AN and is 
denoted EF(A1, ‚Ä¶, AN ).
6.3	
Mean-Variance Relation 
To each portfolio of assets A1,‚Ä¶, AN we assign a pair (œÉ, ¬µ) of its standard deviation and expected return. 
The set of all such pairs is called the feasible set of the assets A1, ‚Ä¶, AN. The feasible set is represented 
by a figure on (œÉ, ¬µ)-plane. There is no one-to-one correspondence between portfolios and points of 
the feasible set because two different portfolios can have equal means and equal standard deviations.
Theorem 6.1. 
1)	 The envelope is represented on the (œÉ, ¬µ)-plane by the right branch of the hyperbola:

3)	 The portfolio xmin with lowest risk corresponds to the vertex of the curve (13); it has the 
mean ¬µ0 and the variance A.
4)	 The efficient frontier is represented on the (œÉ, ¬µ)-plane by the top half of the curve (13):

Figure 6.1.
Proof
1) Denote x¬µ the envelope portfolio with expected return ¬µ and denote œÉ 2 its variance. We will use 
Theorem 5.4. 
The system (7) of linear equations from Section 5.5 can be solved using Gauss-Jordan elimination, so 
any solution q is a linear function of the parameter ¬µ. From Theorem 5.4.2) it follows that the envelope 
portfolio x¬µ is also a linear function of ¬µ: x¬µ = c + b¬µ, where c and b are some vectors independent of 
¬µ, b ‚â† 0.
So œÉ 
2 = Var(x¬µ) = x¬µ
T Sx¬µ = (c + b¬µ)T S (c + b¬µ) = cTS c + ¬µ2 bT Sb + ¬µ (cTSb + bTSc). 
The relation between ¬µ and œÉ for envelope portfolios is given by this second-degree equation:
	
	
	
¬µ2 bTSb + ¬µ (cTSb + bTSc) ‚àí œÉ 2 + cTSc = 0. 
(14)
Comparing this with the general equation of a second-degree curve:
a11 u2 + 2a12 uv + a22 v2 + 2a13 u + 2a23 v + a33 = 0

Since the matrix S is positive definite, for any real number t: (c + bt)T S (c + bt) > 0. Hence for any t, 
t 
2 bTSb + t (cTSb + bTSc) + cTSc > 0. So the discriminant of this quadratic is negative: 
(cTSb + bTSc)2 ‚àí 4 (bTSb) (cTSc) < 0.
This implies I3 < 0. Also we have I2 < 0, therefore the equation (14) defines a non-degenerate hyperbola 
with the real axis parallel to OœÉ. This follows from properties of second-degree curves (see, for example, 
Il‚Äôin and Poznyak, 1985). The equation (14) can be transformed to a canonical form by completing the 
square for ¬µ, so the result has the form (13).

Mean-Variance Analysis 
2) Since the curve (13) represents the envelope portfolios, all other portfolios have higher variances, so 
their corresponding (œÉ, ¬µ)-points lie to the right of the curve.
3) From the equation (13) we see that the right vertex of the hyperbola has coordinates (
)

; it 
corresponds to the portfolio with lowest risk.
4) As Figure 6.1 shows, each feasible value of œÉ (except the vertex value) corresponds to two points on 
the envelope and two values of ¬µ. The point with a higher ¬µ is on the efficient frontier. ‚òê

Mean-Variance Relation for 2-Asset Portfolios
Previously we assumed that at least two values of the expectations ¬µ1,‚Ä¶, ¬µN are different. In case N =2 
this means ¬µ1 ‚â† ¬µ2. We will keep this assumption but not the assumption det S > 0. For N = 2 we will 
consider the case det S > 0 and then the case det S = 0. We will assume œÉ1 > 0 and œÉ2 > 0, which means 
the returns r1 and r2 of the assets A1 and A2 are not constant.

Mean-Variance Analysis 
Denote œÅ the coefficient of correlation between the returns of assets A1 and A2. As stated in Section 3.3, 
det S = 0 ‚áî r1 and r2 are linearly dependent ‚áî | Cov(r1, r2) | = œÉ1 œÉ2 ‚áî | œÅ | = 1. Thus, 
	
	
	
	
 det S = 0 ‚áî | œÅ | = 1. 
(19)
In case N = 2 for any ¬µ‚ààR there is only one portfolio with expected return ¬µ, so the envelope is the 
same as the feasible set.
The feasible set of the assets A1 and A2 depends on the value of œÅ as the following theorems show. 
Theorem 6.2. Suppose N = 2, ¬µ1 ‚â† ¬µ2 and œÅ ‚â† ¬±1. The feasible set and envelope of A1, A2 
are both represented on the (œÉ, ¬µ)-plane by the right branch of the hyperbola:

Example 6.5. Asset A1 has expected return of 3 and standard deviation of 2. Asset A2 has expected return 
of 1 and standard deviation of 1. For the following values of correlation coefficient œÅ find the feasible 
sets of assets A1, A2 and sketch them on the same graph. 
1) œÅ = ‚àí1,

Risk-Free Asset
A risk-free asset is an asset with a constant return; it is denoted F. 
The return of the asset F is denoted f.
For any portfolio x the difference (Œºx ‚àí f ) is called the risk premium of x.
Thus, E(f ) = f, Var(f ) = 0.
For example, government bonds are considered risk-free assets because the government can always raise 
taxes to pay its bills.

As in the previous chapters, we will consider portfolios of assets A1,‚Ä¶, AN, which are represented by 
vectors in the N-dimensional space K with the basis r1,‚Ä¶, rN of the asset returns. Portfolios of assets 
A1,‚Ä¶, AN, F are represented by vectors in an (N+1)-dimensional space, where the asset returns r1,‚Ä¶, rN, 
f make a basis. In this basis f =

Lemma 7.1. f ‚ààEnv(A1, A2,‚Ä¶, AN, F). 
Proof
œÉf = 0 and 0 is the lowest possible value for standard deviation, hence f is on the envelope. ‚òê
For any portfolio x of the assets A1,‚Ä¶, AN define two rays R1x and R2x on the (œÉ, ¬µ)-plane starting at point 
(0, f ): R1x is passing through point (œÉx, ¬µ x) and R2x is passing through point (œÉx, 2f ‚àí¬µ x). 
Clearly, they are defined by the following equations,
R1x:

Proof
1)  ‚áí  Suppose x is a portfolio of A1,‚Ä¶, AN  and y = Œªx + (1‚ÄìŒª)f . Denote œÉ = œÉy  and Œº = Œºy. Then 
Œº = ŒªŒºx + (1‚ÄìŒª)f,  œÉ2 =  Œª2œÉx
2  and œÉ = |Œª| œÉx. 
We will consider 2 cases: Œª ‚â• 0  and Œª < 0.
a) Œª ‚â• 0.
Then œÉ = ŒªœÉx , Œª =

2) Due to (1), it is sufficient to prove:
y is a portfolio of A1,‚Ä¶, AN, F ÔÉ≥ y = Œªx + (1‚ÄìŒª)f  for some Œª‚ààR  and portfolio x of A1,‚Ä¶, AN  (23)
Proof of (23)
‚áí  Suppose y is a portfolio of A1,‚Ä¶, AN, F. Then y = k f + y1r1 +...+ yN rN, where k + y1 +...+ yN = 1. 
So y1 +...+ yN = 1‚Äìk. Denote Œª = 1‚Äìk and x =

Since for each value of expected return there is exactly one envelope portfolio, the tangency point t from 
Lemma 7.3 corresponds to a unique portfolio in Env(A1,‚Ä¶, AN); this portfolio will also be denoted t.
Theorem 7.1. Suppose f ‚â† ¬µ0 and t is the tangency point from Lemma 7.3.

Proof
We use Lemma 7.2. Since point t is on the hyperbola, the portfolio t is a portfolio of A1,‚Ä¶, AN. The rays 
R1t and R2t are given by:
R1t:

The first one is the tangent line to hyperbola. For any portfolio x of A1,‚Ä¶, AN, the rays R1x and R2x are 
between R1t and R2t. This proves the theorem. 
See detailed pictures for cases f > ¬µ0 and f < ¬µ0 in following Lemma 7.5 and Theorem 7.2. ‚òê
Lemma 7.4. Suppose f = ¬µ0.

Though it is not obvious from the definition, the market portfolio depends on the value of the risk-free 
return in a market, since the market values of risky assets depend on it.
Market portfolio is a theoretical concept. In practice they often use proxies such as S&P 500 in the US 
or FTSE100 in the UK to represent the market portfolio. S&P 500 stands for Standard and Poor 500, the 
index consisting of 500 largest US stocks. FTSE100 is a stock market index made up of the 100 largest 
UK registered companies.
In this book we consider only an equilibrium model of a financial market. This model assumes that 
investors can freely buy and sell assets, and the prices of financial securities at any time rapidly reflect 
all available relevant information; so the market is balanced and functions well.
In case f < ¬µ0, in the equilibrium model the market portfolio m and the tangency portfolio 
t are the same.
Example 7.1. Suppose the risk-free return is 2% and the market portfolio has expected return of 10% 
and standard deviation of 15%. If you invested 0.2 of your wealth into the market portfolio and the rest 
into the risk-free asset, what are the expected return and risk of your investment?
Solution
¬µm = 10, œÉm = 15, f = 2, x = 0.2m + 0.8f. 
So ¬µx = 0.2¬µm + 0.8f = 0.2√ó10 + 0.8√ó2 = 3.6%.
Since f is constant, we have œÉx = 0.2œÉm = 0.2√ó15 = 3%. ‚òê

1. Suppose the risk-free return is 10% and the market portfolio has expected return of 20% and standard 
deviation of 25%. If you invested 0.4 of your wealth in the market portfolio and the rest in the risk-free 
asset, what are the expected return and risk of your investment?
Answer: ¬µx = 14% and œÉx = 10%.
2. Assume the same parameters for the risk-free asset and market portfolio as in Exercise 1. If you 
invested 1.2 of your wealth into the market portfolio and the rest into the risk-free asset (a short sale), 
what are the expected return and risk of your investment?
Answer: ¬µx = 22% and œÉx = 30%.

Finding Market Portfolio and CML Equation
Theorem 7.3. 1) Env(A1,‚Ä¶, AN, F) ={Œªm + (1‚àíŒª)f | Œª‚ààR}. 
2) EF(A1,‚Ä¶, AN, F) ={Œªm + (1‚àíŒª)f | Œª ‚â• 0}.
Proof
1) y = Œªm + (1‚ÄìŒª)f ‚áî (œÉy, Œºy)‚àà R1m ‚à™ R2m ‚áî y‚àà EF(A1,‚Ä¶, AN, F).
The first equivalence follows from lemma 7.2.1) and the second equivalence follows from Theorem 7.1.1).
2) follows from 1) because EF(A1,‚Ä¶, AN, F) is represented by CML and points on CML correspond to 
portfolios Œªm + (1‚ÄìŒª)f with Œª ‚â• 0. ‚òê 
The CML is the ray R1m passing through the points (0, f ) and (œÉm, ¬µm):

Here the top half of the right branch of the hyperbola represents the efficient frontier of the N risky 
assets. CML represents the efficient frontier of the N risky assets combined with the risk-free asset F (see 
Theorem 7.2.3). For best expected returns investors should invest in the portfolios along CML, that is the 
portfolios of the form Œªm + (1‚àíŒª) f. The investors who tolerate risk will invest in the market portfolio 
m or the portfolios above m (with Œª > 1). The risk averse investors will have a higher proportion of the 
risk-free asset f, which means investing in the portfolios below m (with 0 ‚â§ Œª < 1); so these investors 
will have a lower risk but also a lower expected return.

Example 7.2. The market portfolio has expected return of 20% and standard deviation of 8%. The risk-
free return is 4%.
1) Write the equation of the CML.
2) Efficient portfolio x has expected return of 16%. 
a)	 Find its standard deviation.
b)	 If the total value of portfolio x is $1000, how is this value allocated?
Solution
¬µm = 20, œÉm = 8, f = 4.
1) The CML passes through the points (0, f ) and (œÉm, ¬µm ), which are (0, 4) and (8, 20). So 
CML:

CML: ¬µ = 2œÉ + 4 (œÉ ‚â• 0).
2) a) Portfolio x is efficient, therefore it is on the CML. So ¬µx = 2œÉx + 4, 16 = 2œÉx + 4, œÉx = 6%.
b) Since x is on the envelope, it has the form x = m + (1‚àíŒª) f by Theorem 7.3.1). Its expected return 
equals ¬µx = Œª¬µm + (1‚àíŒª) f, 16 = Œª‚ãÖ20 + (1‚àíŒª) ‚ãÖ4, Œª = 0.75 and x = 0.75m + 0.25f. So $750 is invested in 
the market portfolio and $250 is invested in the risk-free asset. ‚òê

Regression in Finance. Beta Coefficient
Linear regression was covered in Section 4.4. In the world of N risky assets A1,‚Ä¶, AN and a risk-free asset 
F all portfolios are regressed to the market portfolio m. The market portfolio is not risk-free, so œÉm ‚â† 0. 
Theorem 7.6. For any portfolio x the following holds.
1) x = Œ±x + Œ≤x m + Œµ, where

The regression line Œ±x + Œ≤x m is the linear function of m closest to x. So the coefficient Œ≤x is 
the average rate of change of x‚Äôs return with respect to the market return.
2) For the residual Œµ, ¬µŒµ = 0 and Cov(Œµ, m) = 0.
3) The variance œÉx
2 represents the total risk of portfolio x;
Œ≤x
2œÉm
2 is the systematic risk (or market risk) of x, the risk that affects most investments;
œÉ Œµ
2 is the unsystematic risk (or asset-specific risk) of x, the risk that affects only a small 
number of investments. 
The total risk of x is a sum of the systematic risk and unsystematic risk: 
œÉx
2 = Œ≤x
2œÉm
2 + œÉŒµ
2 .
Proof
1) and 2 follow directly from Theorem 4.5 and its Corollary. 
3) œÉx
2 = Var(x) = Var(Œ±x + Œ≤x m + Œµ) = Var(Œ≤x m + Œµ) = Œ≤x
2 Var(m) + Var(Œµ) + 2Œ≤x Cov(Œµ, m) =
= Œ≤x
2œÉm
2 + œÉŒµ

These are some examples of factors of systematic risk: 
--
unexpected drop in interest rates;
--
inflation; 
--
release of government figures on GDP (gross domestic product).
These are some examples of factors of unsystematic risk for a particular company: 
--
appointment of a new president of the company; 
--
news about the company‚Äôs sales figures.
The regression line x = Œ±x + Œ≤x m is called the characteristic line of portfolio x.
Œ≤x is called the beta coefficient (or just beta) of portfolio x.
Thus, Œ≤x is the slope and Œ±x is the y-intercept of the characteristic line.
Beta measures the response of the portfolio‚Äôs return to a change in the market return. For example, if 
a portfolio has Œ≤ = 2 and the market goes up by 10%, then this portfolio‚Äôs return will increase by 20% 
on average.

Since ŒºŒµ = 0, we have Œºx = Œ±x + Œ≤x Œºm. So the expected return Œºx depends only on Œ≤x, not œÉŒµ ; that is Œºx 
depends only on systematic risk.

Beta coefficient is used for ordinal ranking of assets according to their systematic risk, due to the previous 
theorem. 
An asset with Œ≤ > 1 is called an aggressive asset (it is more volatile than the market 
portfolio).
An asset with Œ≤ < 1 is called a defensive asset (it is less volatile than the market portfolio).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Capital Market Theory 
The graph of CAPM equation on the (Œ≤, ¬µ)-plane is called the Security Market 
Line (SML). 
The slope of SML is (¬µm ‚àí f ), which is called the market risk premium. It is the 
risk premium of the market portfolio. 
The CAPM estimates how expected return depends on systematic risk. The CAPM model says that in 
a balanced market (the equilibrium model) all portfolios of the N risky assets have their (Œ≤, ¬µ)-points 
on the Security Market Line. Mean-variance analysis and CAPM are used by brokers, pension-fund 
managers and consultants when formulating investment strategies and giving financial advice.
Example 7.7. The market portfolio has a standard deviation of 10%. Portfolio x has a standard deviation 
of 20% and a correlation coefficient of 0.65 with the market portfolio. Find the beta of the portfolio x.

Example 7.8. Portfolios x, y and z have the following characteristic lines and coefficients of correlation 
with the market portfolio:
x = 2 + 1.5m, œÅx,m = 0.9; y = 3 + 2.1m, œÅy,m = 0.7; z = 4 + 0.8m, œÅz,m = 0.6.
1)	 Which portfolio has the most systematic risk?
2)	 For each portfolio find the percentage of systematic risk and unsystematic risk.
3)	 For each portfolio determine whether it is aggressive or defensive.
Solution
1)	 Œ≤x = 1.5, Œ≤y = 2.1, Œ≤z = 0.8. Portfolio y has the highest beta, hence y has the most systematic 
risk.
2)	 By property 5), the proportion of systematic risk of portfolio x equals

3)	 Œ≤x = 1.5 > 1, Œ≤y = 2.1 > 1, so portfolios x and y are aggressive. Œ≤z = 0.8 < 1, so portfolio z is 
defensive. ‚òê

1)	 Find the proportion of each stock in portfolio x.
2)	 Find the beta coefficient for x.
3)	 If the market portfolio has expected return of 7% and the risk-free return is 2%, what is the 
expected return of portfolio x? Use CAPM model.
Solution
1)	 The total value of the portfolio is 2000 + 3000 + 5000 = $10,000. The proportions are:
