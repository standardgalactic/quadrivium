Show that the kinematic viscosity has the primary dimensions of L2T-1.
Solution:
The kinematic viscosity is defined as the ratio of the dynamic viscosity by the density of the fluid.
The density has units of mass (kg) divided by volume (m3); whereas the dynamic viscosity has the units 
of mass (kg) per meter (m) per time (s).

A rectangular block of wood, floats with one face horizontal in a fluid (RD = 0.9). The wood’s 
density is 750 kg/m3. Determine the percentage of the wood, which is not submerged.
[Ans: 17%]
Solution:
:HLJKW
)
:
For stable condition 
Upthrust = weight force or 	
F = W
The Upthrust due to Buoyancy = rseawater g Vx
The total weight of submersed wood = rwood g VL
Therefore the portion of block that is NOT submerged is
1- Vx/VL = (rwood / rwater ) = 1 - 750 / 900 = 17%

An empty balloon and its equipment weight 50 kg, is inflated to a diameter of 6m, with a gas 
of density 0.6 kg/m3. What is the maximum weight of cargo that can be lifted on this balloon, 
if air density is assumed constant at 1.2 kg/m3?
[Ans: 17.86 kg]
Solution:
)
:
Since the system is stable according to Newton’s second law of motion: 
Upthrust 	
	
= Weight force + Payload
The Upthrust is F	
= r x g xVL = 1.2 x 9.81 x(px(4/3)x33) =1331.4 N
Weight of balloon gas 	 = r xVL = 0.6 x 9.81 x(px(4/3)x33) =666 N
Weight of equipment	
= 50 kg = 50x9.81 = 490.5 N
Therefore the payload that can be lifted 
P 	
= F - W
	
= 1331.4 – (666 + 490.5) 
	
= 175 N = 17.9 kg.

A 20 mm dam pipe forks, one branch being 10 mm in diameter and the other 15 mm in diameter. 
If the velocity in the 10 mm pipe is 0.3 m/s and that in the 15 mm pipe is 0.6 m/s, calculate the 
rate of flow in cm3/s and velocity in m/s in the 20 mm diameter pipe.
(129.6 cm3/s, 0.413 m/s)
Solution:
Total mass flow into the junction = Total mass flow out of the junction
ρ1Q1 = ρ2Q2 + ρ3Q3 
When the flow is incompressible (e.g. if it is water) ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ

A buoy is attached to a weight resting on the seabed; the buoy is spherical with radius of 0.2m 
and the density of sea water is 1020 kg/m3. Determine the minimum weight required to keep 
the buoy afloat just above the water surface. Assume the buoy and the chain has a combined 
weight of 1.2 kg.
Ans (33 kg)

Chapter Three Tutorial Problems
Since the system is stable and motionless, Newton’s second law of motion reduces to:
Weight = Upthrust (Buoyancy)
Fb = Fg
Volume of sphere 	
= (4.pi/3) x R3 = 0.0335 m3
The Upthrust is	 FB	
= rfluid x VL x g =1020 x 0.0335x9.81= 335.3 N
Weight 		
	
= 9.81 x(1.2 + Load )
Hence the payload 	
= (335.3 / 9.81) – 1.2 = 32.98 kg

the following when the craft is cruising at 700 km/h:
1.	 the lift coefficient

(a) An airplane wing has a 7.62m span and 2.13m chord. Estimate the drag on the wing (two 
sides) treating it as a flat plate and the flight speed of 89.4 m/s to be turbulent from the 
leading edge onward. 
(b) Determine the reduction in power that can be saved if the boundary layer control device is 
installed on the wing to ensure laminar flow over the entire wing’s surface.
For air, take density as 1.01 kg/m3, and kinematic viscosity as 1.3x10-5 m/s2.

Assuming the ideal gas model holds, determine the velocity of sound in 
a)	 air (mwt 28.96) at 25°C, with g = 1.4, 
b)	 argon (mwt 39.95) at 25°C, with g = 1.667.
Ans: [346 m/s, 321.5 m/s]
Solution:
For air at 25 oC
R = 8314.4/ 28.96 = 287.096 J/kgK
a= [γ R T]1/2 = (1.4 (287.096 J/K kg) (298K))1/2     = 346.029 (m/s)
For Argon
R = 8314.3 / 39.95 = 208.117 J/kgK
a= [γ R T]1/2 = (1.667 (208.117 J/K kg) (298K))1/2     = 321.536 (m/s)
4.2	
An airplane can fly at a speed of 800km/h at sea-level where the temperature is 15°C. lf the 
airplane flies at the same Mach number at an altitude where the temperature is -44°C, find the 
speed at which the airplane is flying at this altitude. 
Ans: [195m/s]
Solution:
a= [γ R T]1/2 
= (1.4 x287x(273+15))1/2     
= 346.17 (m/s)
V1= 800 km/h = 800 x 1000/3600 = 222.222 m/s
M = V/a = 222.222 / 346.17 = 0.642 
a2 = [γ R T]1/2 
= (1.4 x287x(273-44))1/2     
= 303.33 (m/s)
Hence
V2 = M x a2 = 303.33 x 0.642 = 195 m/s

A hydro-electric power plant based on the Loch Sloy in Scotland has an effective head of 250 
metres. If the flow rate of 16 m3/s can be maintained, determine:
a)	 the total power input to the turbine assuming a hydraulic efficiency of 98%; and
b)	 the pressure difference across the turbine.
Ans: (38 MW, 2.4 MPa)
Solution:
The power available from water is
P 	
= ρ Q g h x h     
	
= 1000 x 16 x9.81 x 250 x0.98 
	
= 38455.2 kW which is 38 MW.

Trigonometry will mean the sensitivity can be improved 
by reading the longest side of a triangle.
Read (Lx Sin(theta)) instead of reading (h)
 / 3 marks
Use different size (cross-sectional 
area) for either side of the 
manometer.
Help is derived from the continuity law, or displaced 
volume on either side to remain the same, A. z = constant, 
so z2 can be much larger if A2 is smaller than A1.
 / 3 marks
Use different fluids with appreciably 
different density values.
This uses the conservation of mass, for the displaced 
column on either side of the manometer.

Solution
The free body diagram shows that the body is affected by 3 forces.
Newton’s second law of motion states that when the object is moving at steady state then the net force 
on the object must be zero
Hence F g = Fb + Fd	
Since the parachute is open, the buoyancy force will be negligible and only due to the body of the person, 
which is small in comparison to the parachute size. Fb = 0
