Get Refunded for a Used Gift Card
This method will allow you to get a refund for any gift card 
after using it.
• Buy a gift card to anywhere, but you would be better off getting 
it at a popular place.
• Sign up for an account on Ebay if you don't have one already.
• Create a new listing with the following format:
Title: $(Amount) (STORE) GIFT CARD CHEAP
Description: My son bought this for me, But I don't need it anymore. 
This is a $(Amount) Gift card and is in mint condition.
Tiny letters at the bottom of the description: (This gift card is used 
and for collectors purposes only)
Many people are collectors of gift cards. This can benefit you in 
TWO ways.
1. Dumb people will buy it thinking it has money on it.
2. Collectors will buy it and add it to their collection.
This is my simple method. Hope you enjoy!
